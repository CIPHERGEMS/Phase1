Goin’ Crazy,The Fifth ,2013.0,"Every single morning
Wake up in the afternoon (Yeah)
Cover up the mirror
Just to get a better view (Yeah)
Been around the world and never even left the room (Ah)

And I, I can't figure out
Why?
So I just scream and shout

I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe I'm going crazy
Going crazy, Going crazy
I believe I'm losing my mind

Everybody's looking at me, but I don't see them
Living for the weekend, caught in the deep end
Tryin'a tread water, do it for my unborn daughter
Lamb to the slaughter, life's getting shorter
Tryin'a get high off a quarter
I'm fly in a saucer, my life is a corker
Star, pop bottles, date top models
Middle finger in the air, not a care, going full throttle
Where's the love though?
Nobody cares about that, where's the club? Where's the drugs though? Front row
Follow the flow, Megaupload
Feel the adrenaline rush, who's the mug though? I don't know

I
I can't figure out
Why?
So I just scream and shout?

I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe I'm going crazy
Going crazy, Going crazy
I believe I'm losing my mind

Living in a bubble, my life is a puzzle
I'm caught in the rubble, now pass me a shovel
Now pass me a shot, and make it a double
I'm a whole lot of trouble and I don't do subtle
It's all or nothing, I don't wanna juggle
No crabs in a bucket, I don't wanna huddle
I've got my own name, tryn'a figure out the whole game
Going insane, 150 in the slow lane
Getting ahead of myself
My God, already thinking how can I better myself
Should I be somebody else? Should I be pacing myself?
My car's a rocket, and if I get too carried away, I wouldn't know when to stop it

I
I can't figure out
Why?
So I just scream and shout?

I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe I'm going crazy
Going crazy, Going crazy
I believe I'm losing my mind

Tryna get a hold of
Tryin'a get a hold of you
Yo, I'm goin in fearless, man, I'm wildin out
Don't even try and get a hold of me
Tryin'a get control of
Tryin'a get control of me
Yo, I've lost it, its gone
I'm tryna warn - hey, listen!
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe I'm going crazy
Going crazy, going crazy
I believe I'm losing my mind",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-goin-crazy-lyrics
I Don’t Need a Reason,The Fifth ,2013.0,"All I do is flex, I don't need a reason
All I want is sex, I don't need a reason
Fly out on a jet, I don't need a reason
Every day's a never ending summer season
All eyes on me

160, blink and miss me
Super nifty, riding swiftly
Rolling through the sticks
Leather extra crispy, effortlessly
Power steering, accurately, ready for action, actually
Mellow, relaxed and cocking my snapback
Not taking no God damn back chat
Just racking up fat stacks
No ring, no chain, no fat chaps
I don't get no sleep, no cat naps
And everybody wanna be on my black sack
But I don't slack
You don't really wanna see me get abstract
I'll switch up the place like have that
Don't care about none of that rap crap
Steer clear of the rat trap
Some say that I lack tact
But I'm on the map
And I'm setting the pace, I'm on track
So get out my face, I'm on slapping
I'm on scrapping, so stop yapping, what's crackalacking?
Don't follow fashion, just keeping it G
With these hoes, macking, and that's what's happening
What?
That's what's happening

All I do is flex, I don't need a reason
All I want is sex, I don't need a reason
Fly out on a jet, I don't need a reason
Every day's a never ending summer season
All eyes on me

God bless me, nobody can't test me
Everyday life can't stress me, stay on the ball like Messi
Money and women are the only things that impress me
I stay fly and sexy
Life is a game of chess, and all the girls wanna check me
How much do you wanna bet me, that I never ever let a female sweat me?
Get me
I ain't gotta talk no more, cause soon as I walk in the door everybody stops doing what they're doing, don't know what they're pausing for, don't know what they're gawping for
Bad boy from the LDN, what the world's been calling for, been balling for
And your girl gets wet, stays up in the morning for
Don't know what you're stalling for
Get with the programme, I got the flow and I've got the dough and money to blow
And, this ain't a slow jam, ready to rock and I'm ready to roll, I'm gripping at the Trojan
Never gonna get caught slipping, never gonna get caught tripping
Never too soft on the women
If it ever gets too hot in the kitchen, I'm dipping, I ain't gonna stand there dripping, I'm missing

All I do is flex, I don't need a reason
All I want is sex, I don't need a reason
Fly out on a jet, I don't need a reason
Every day's a never ending summer season
All eyes on me

International, flex and go
When I'm at home, I stay low
Yo, lay in the cut, they can't see me bro
And I'm living it up, they can't be me though
Get on the mic, I get easy dough
When I'm cutting the cheques, cause I'm C.E.O
Keep on fronting, like you don't know
I stay repping the Manor, and that's E3, Bow
Stay with a brownin', get around the town, you better hold it down
I'll leave you breathing slow
Overstand, cause I ain't even clowning, I'll leave you drowning from head to toe
Wet, why you trying to put me in check?
I play for keeps, you better know I don't pet
Knock your head off your shoulders, no sweat, watch your step

All I do is flex, I don't need a reason
All I want is sex, I don't need a reason
Fly out on a jet, I don't need a reason
Every day's a never ending summer season
All eyes on me",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-i-dont-need-a-reason-lyrics

Don't touch it
Don't. Who told you to touch it? I will fucking kill you
Don't ever touch that fucking shit again

I'm a fiend for a big dirty bassline
When I hear one I have a great time
A bit of bottom end's all what I require
I let the bassline take me higher
My friends think that it's a bad habit
But I'm just like fuck you, damn it
If you take my bass away
I'll blow your fucking face away (easy!)
You might think I'm over the top
But when I hear that bassline drop (What!)
I just can't control my actions
But I still feel satisfaction
So don't come around here whinging
I just wanna hear the bassline rinsin'
Or we can just skank out all day
If not get the fuck out my way

The other day I got an ASBO order
And I think it's well out of order
All my neighbors throwing a fit
So I told them suck my dick
And I told them I got the power
And I turn the music up louder
All night till six in the morning
Old bastards, they just boring
You know me, I'm the bassline father
Nobody can't tell me nada
And the police turned up and they took me
We drove out to the 
nick
 and they booked me
When they said they'd give me a caution
If I didn't give them no distortion
But I said don't bother, I'm guilty
And my bassline's fucking filthy

Dance Wiv Me,Tongue n’ Cheek,2008.0,"Oh, oh
Ooh, baby
Come and dance with me

What's up darlin'?
I been keeping my eye on your movement
I can't see no room for improvement
Why you all over there on your Jack Jones?
You need to let me get behind your backbone
'Cause I'm the man for the job, let me work it
I won't waste no time, I'll make it worth it
One hundred percent, I'll make it perfect
You got a body to die for, let me merk it
Now it's murder on the dance floor
I wanna take this further than the dance floor
I ain't forceful but I'm still hardcore
You're gonna give me everything I ask for
It's not a long ting, you're the boom ting
Maybe more than a hotel room ting
I'll never know if I just walk past
I really wanna dance so I guess I'll just ask

She ain't no ho
Look at those thighs, it's in her eyes, she's good to go
She can satisfy my mind, body and soul
Come and dance with me, come and dance with me
Come and dance with me, come dance with me
I see you glance at me, that's why I'm asking, B
So let's party, B, come and dance with me

If I'm out on my own, then I can look at you looking at me
If I'm out on a date, then I just shut my eyes, then I can't see
Get away from the bar, tell your boyfriend hold your jar
And dance with me
I see you glance at me, that's why I'm asking, B
So let's party, B, come and dance with me

Yo, it goes on and on
I see you get excited like this is my song
You think I wanna get involved, you are not wrong
'Cause I been waiting for this moment all night long
So I creep, creep, creep back to your seat
I got my left eye checking out your scenery
I got my right eye right where it needs to be
Don't matter how I look at it, you look good to me
Still, I'm looking for the perfect view
The way I see it, that's right next to you
I know you've probably heard it before but still
I love it when you flex like that for real
So don't stop doing what you do when you do it
I just wanna be a part of it when you do it
I'll feel like a wally if I don't pursue it
And I can't go through it, so let's get to it

She ain't no ho
Look at those thighs, it's in her eyes, she's good to go
She can satisfy my mind, body and soul
Come and dance wiv me, come and dance wiv me
Come and dance wiv me, come dance wiv me
I see you glance at me, that's why I'm asking, B
So let's party, B, come and dance with me

I know you didn't come out to stand and stare
You bought new shoes and you did up your hair
You made a real effort tonight and it shows
I can tell by your face you don't wanna be alone
'Cause the mood is right and the time is now
And if you can't do it, I'll show you how
All you gotta do is get loose, let go
Just throw a couple shapes, put your skills on show, oh
Put your skills on show

If I'm out on my own, then I can look at you looking at me
If I'm out on a date, then I just shut my eyes, then I can't see
Get away from the bar, tell your boyfriend hold your jar
And dance with me
I see you glance at me, that's why I'm asking, B
So let's party, B, come and dance with me
If I'm out on my own, then I can look at you looking at me
If I'm out on a date, then I just shut my eyes, then I can't see

[Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal & 
Jeanine Jacques
]
Yo
If that girl knows where you stay, that's poor
Some whore banging on your door, what for?
Pregnant? What're you talking about? Be sure
Fifteen, she's underage, that's raw
And against law, 5 years or more
Now she wants a score and half of a draw
That's the kind of threat that you can't ignore
That whore got you pinned down to the floor
But it's your own fault, you said three magic words (
I love you
)
When that's the one for the birds
When you said that she forgot other boys
It's over, you better start buying the toys
There was no intention of her being wife
Now she knows this, she's ending your life
It's a real shame you got had by the whores
It's a shame that kid probably ain't yours
[Chorus: Dizzee Rascal & 
Jeanine Jacques
]
That girl' some bitch ya know
She keep calling my phone, she don't leave me alone
She just moan and groan, she keep ringin' me at home
These days I don't answer my phone
That boy some prick, you kna'
All up in my hair, thinks that I care
Keeps following me here, keeps following me there
These days I can't go nowhere
Ain't that your girl?
Nah, it ain't my girl
I swear that's your girl?
'Course it ain't my girl
She got juiced up
 (Oh well)
She got jacked up
 
(Oh well)
I swear that's your man?
I ain't got no man
You was with that man?
He was just any man
He got hotted up
 
(Oh well)
He got whacked up 
(Oh well)

Alright, she's a bad girl, I'm a boss though
Captain Roscoe
 
with a crossbow
She came she got picked off yo
Nah it's not a love ting, get lost ho
Dizzee Rascal come down like snow
With freezing cold flows like Moscow (Yo)
Dumb ho, get me upset, guns blow
Bitch, no, you're not ready for skid row
Bleed know Dizzee Rascal did grow
Big feet for the force on my big toe
I got no chaps, no chains, not much dough
Get juiced but you don't get love though
No slap but you might get a co-co (Yo)
Jambo coming through like Rambo
Love ting takes two like tango
But she ain't my wifey, she can go

Listen, I like your girl so you better look after your girl
Or I might just take your girl (Uh), and make your girl my girl
Switch your girl with Michelle
Switch Michelle with Chantelle
Play Chantelle with Shanell
Lyrical clientele 
but I ain't a bocat, I don't like the smell
I'm gonna go through a shell and make a boy feel unwell (Yo)
That girl's from school, that girl's from college (Uh)
That girl gives brains, that girl gives knowledge
That girl gives head, 
that girl gives shines
That girl gives BJs at all times
She looks decent, she looks fine
But don't talk about wifey she's not mine
She got batteried, 6 in a line (Uh), believe me that's not a good sign

Fix up, look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out, get dark (Woo)

Duck down, lay down, just calm down
Fix up, look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out, get dark (Woo)
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down, just calm down

I hear the sound (Yeah)

I've heard the gossip from the street to the slammer
They're tryna see if Dizzee stays true to his grammar
Being a celebrity don't mean shit to me (Woo)
Fuck the glitz and glamour, hit 'em with the Blitz and Hammer (Woo)
Because they're talking 'bout rushing
Talk behind my back but to my face, they say nothing
Stand up in the dance, keep a firm steady stance
Keep the beanies touching, keep the beanies hot flushing (Woo)
Flushing MCs down the loo
If you don't believe me, bring your posse, bring your crew
Feel free to hate 'cause I ain't tryna be your mate
Be serious, you wouldn't last an hour in my shoe (Woo)
It's an Air Force One (Woo)
Trainers by the truck load, trainers by the tonne
Don't be dazed when I catch you by your J's
Chump, best to act like Forrest Gump, best to run (Woo)

Oi look (Woo)
I stay sweet as a nut, sweet like Tropicana
When the hammer hits, your head splits like banana
You're not ready for this boy
You better send your best soldiers, this is Captain Roscoe (Woo)
More destructive and troublesome than ever
I'll probably be doing this, probably forever
Fellas wanna stop me, they'll probably come together
It's probable they'll stop me, probably never (Woo)
Yo, topboy, topman, or top ah topper
Come to me with an attitude, come a cropper
I'm old school like Happy Shopper
I fight old school, bring your bat and your chopper (Woo)
And a first aid kit (Woo) and some antiseptic, this could get hectic
I'm a don, accept it, you got a bright future
Don't let my gun affect it

Fix up, look sharp

""Roger roll, Discovery""

Ain't no point in playin' it safe
Gotta know your role, better state your case
When it all falls down better know your place
Just gimme three feet and an ounce of
Space, space, space
Space, you should wanna embrace
Space, space, space
""Discovery. Go at throttle up.""

Rip up and ravage, make it a habit for damage
Whole lotta baggage, you will not manage, I'm the full package
Why do they talk like I am not established? That is so callous, they are the saddest
Why are they so full of malice? Making up fallacies, I'm in my palace blazing up the chalice with Alice
'Cause I'm a gyalist and I'm the baddest, it's not a travesty
Call me ""Your Majesty,"" sometimes it feels like world's on my phallus
Push out my chest and I big up my status
Where's all the trappers? Where's all the clappers?
I am not shaken, no need for maracas
Or apparatus, put in the work and spend money on motors and slappers
Why are we frontin' like it even matters?
Why do they make me feel guilty for gettin' this money like my soul's in tatters?
Sittin' here tryna realign my chakras
Driving me crackers, you bloody spackers should get off my knackers
Give me the gas and the matches, I've been through hell and I swallowed the ashes, running this ting for so long as it happens, I'm knackered
All of my enemies broken and shattered, sprinkling hate, they're all over the shop and they're scattered
Chatting my name till this day and I'm flattered, I am not easily rattled
Don't follow the cattle, so quiet your chatter or you will get battered
Can't find enough time to dine on these rappers, all of these MCs are looking like tapas
Fuck all the swine and their bodily gases, roll with the rastas, Babylon's calling me, nobody's fooling me
I do not roll with the masses, but big up the Junglist massive
I am not timid and I am not passive, messing with me? You must be on some acid
Don't want the racket, I will get erratic, all my problems disappear like it's magic
It'll be tragic

Ain't no point in playin' it safe
Gotta know your role, better state your case
When it all falls down better know your place
Just gimme three feet and an ounce of
Space, space, space
Space, you should wanna embrace
Space, space, space
Yeah, uh

Don't pet or pander, leave 'em hanging
I'll be damned, man to man
Hit him with an open hand, release the anger
WorldStar, you could get dealt with on camera
Understand my grammar, I don't stutter, lisp or stammer
Watch me blaze the beat, I must admit it hit just like a hammer
It's a banger for the mandem on the street and in the slammer
Bang your doors, bang your doors for the cause
Breaking laws, breaking jaws, open paws
Poker board, taking scores, and be sure
Never let a bredda get one over yours
Never put money over whores, maybe or it's crazy flawed, it's a myth, life's a gift, made me pause, catch my drift, smoke a spliff and get in them draws
Paid the cost to be the boss, ball and floss, Jesus died, he nailed himself into the cross
Still couldn't please these backwards shit cunts, why would I take a loss?
Giving a toss, know your worth, hold your turf, fuck the earth, and shake it off
Breddas on my line talkin' 'bout, ""Yo, Raskit, break me off""
They’re wafer soft, I'm taking off

""Three, two, one, zero, and lift off""
""Lift off of Kepler-41b. The first flight of the Orbiter Discovery and the shuttle has cleared the tower

Ain't no point in playin' it safe
Gotta know your role, better state your case
When it all falls down better know your place
Just gimme three feet and an ounce of
Space, space
Space, you should wanna embrace
Space, space, space

Alright, lift off and the clock has started
Yes sir, reading you loud and clear
Roger, Zero-T, and I feel fine, capsule is turning around
We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-space-lyrics
Holiday,Tongue n’ Cheek,2009.0,"Get your passport and your bikini
You need a holiday, come see me
I know you're tired of the same old scenery
And I could change all that so easily
Don't worry 'bout a thing, girl, take a chance
I'll take you to the south of France
Like Cannes, and if anybody can, I can
We could both shop in the Milan
I just hope you understand
I hope you see it clear
It really don't matter how far or near
'Cause there's no distance
That could stop my persistence
Just a few days of the year
Plus I've got clout, so let's ride out
We ain't gotta fly, we can just drive out
We can have a rave or we can hide out
Won't tell nobody, let them find out

If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away
Drive away, get away
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away
Drive away, take a holiday
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby

Don't watch my passport photo, I know I look a bit loco
And I know that my Spanish is so-so
But let's try keep that on the low-low
Cause we're going Ibiza
I've got friends that really wanna meet ya
With champagne and a whole lot of reefa
It's all good darling, a Blue Marlin will please ya
And I'll never let your belly get empty
Even when your belly full you're still sexy
We can ride speed boats, we can ride jet skis
I'll show you the time of your life if you let me
I just want to put a smile on your pretty face
If I didn't it would just be your pretty waste
You do look like a girl with a bit of taste
So I couldn't take you just any place

If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away
Drive away, get away
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away
Drive away, take a holiday
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby

I know you're really busy and I know you got plans
But are you really too busy for a sun tan?
I ain't talking about walking down the high street
I'm talking about laying on a bright white beach
With a Pina Colada or whatever you'd rather
White wine, that's fine, just give me a lager
Then after we'll take a truck to the night spot
The hot spot, the top spot, party around the clock
And when we get there it's strictly VIP
No need for ID, security know me
No waiting in line, no high entry fee
Don't worry about nothing when you're beside me
I'll get you lively and loosen you up
Have a bit of champagne, it'll boost you up
I wanna move you up, I wanna take you away
So have a word, darling, what do you say?

If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away
Drive away, get away
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away
Drive away, take a holiday
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-holiday-lyrics
Love This Town,The Fifth ,2013.0,"New York, LA, Tokyo, Berlin, Miami, Rio, Milan, Ibiza
I love all these places, but there's no place like home
I love my city

I go hard in the city of London
I get a lot of love
, 
all smiles when I step in the function
I’m a local boy, I’m from the east side
Now I’m jet settin, I’m reppin, I’ll do it worldwide
When I was a kid there was a rough ride
Barely had the money for a bus ride, now I’m on the upside
Having a ball with all the breders I grew up with
A couple of women I’m in the club with
Bottle the bubbly, feeling lovely, women are hugging me
Nobody could tell me nothing and nobody can never trouble me
It’s all good, pure positive vibes
For the most part everybody’s just tryna live their lives
We’re not afraid to die, only the strong survive
You don’t know if you don’t try, the stakes are high
And it’s the city where I earned my crown
God knows that I love this town

The city lights are extra bright
They shine for us tonight
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town
Let me buy you another round
And show you how my peeps get down
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town

It’s just one big melting pot
Every creed colour and race, we got the lot
And I love to shop, there's not a brand that can't be copped
No more than a couple of stops
Where should I begin?
Might see me in the west side getting it in
Might see me on the north side getting a trim
South side of the river in a race car having a spin, I just win
And I’m never gonna lose with the city to guide me
Got the vibe of the city inside me and the streets are lively
Got a whole lot of love and I'm connect it
It’s 7 million people behind me, don’t try me
‘Cuz right now we’re gonna rave it up
Set the roof on fire and blaze it up
And we’re in it to win it
There’s no limit so we raise it up
We got the dancefloor shaking like, woo

The city lights are extra bright
They shine for us tonight
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town
Let me buy you another round
And show you how my peeps get down
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town

I fuckin' love this town

The city lights are extra bright
They shine for us tonight
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town
Let me buy you another round
And show you how my peeps get down
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-love-this-town-lyrics
Pagans,Pagans EP,2014.0,"Ascended masters of angels of light, but you're actually deceiving demonic spirits , which can not only hurt somebody externally, they can destroy their spirits as well

I don't speak queen's English but I'm still distinguished
I don't need no suit or tie to let you know I mean business
I know you're into this
Even even if you were deaf, blind and dumb and awkwardly rhythmless
I'm like syphilis ain't no denying this wickedness
Any attempt would be grimy and hideous
Young and I'm black and I'm ignorant
But I'm still frivolous
Meaning I'm nigga-less
More than the way I feel strength in my pigments
What does it matter? Just give me my dividends
Switching up syllables
 mixing with criminals
Keep up appearance but keeping it minimal
Bredders be getting too over familiar
Quizzical, touching your physical
Hands on my bread with a spoon in my cereal
Not on my watch cause I'm a hard rock
Come through in a hard top
With your girl in the passenger seat, she getting hard cock
I didn't even let the car stop
Don't even worry what cars I've got
You should be concerned with what you are not
I dictate the pace and set the bar a lot
You get parred a lot
Sorry pardon what?
I can't hear you bro you sound weary bro
Talk shit but you won't come near me though
And I'm far from sweet I'm no Cheerio
I switch up the place real quick like hear we go
Leave your body all black with a whole lot of indigo
Six feet below
No heads up, no intro
No info I get it in bro

Cold world with a whole lot of schemers
It don't stop for the dreamers
You could fuck around and get took to the cleaners
I know man that would do a lot of dirty
Put a lot of work in
Just to ride Benz and Beamers
Devious creatures
Try to steer clear of the preachers
Screaming out 'God can't reach us'
Nothing they can teach us, leave us
Looking for a girl with over the top features
Couldn't care less about Jesus
Couldn't give a fuck about a thesis
Looking for the easiest next top model
Or another shit TV series
Raised by MTV generation
Not a lot of patience
Update Facebook status, no hesitation
How they gonna deal with the wolves of the nation
How they gonna recognize pros and cons with no education
How they gonna win with no dedication
All you really care about is Playstation
World Star Hip Hop humiliation
Everything built on a weak foundation
Whole lot of time being wasted
Whole lot of shit champagne being tasted
Everybody in the club acting basic
Everybody wanna be a star let's face it
Gassed by the money and the fame let's chase it
Gotta get it quick gotta get it by all means
Wanna be a big timer like the guy from New Orleans
Got big dreams, but they absurd, and they obscene
Pregnant on TV at sixteen
Don't know what this shit means
Yo, can't trust these no-good, two-faced cut-throat Pagans living in Babylon
Wanna sell me lies, wanna bleed me dry, wanna see me live like a vagabond
Like I worked this hard and I come this far just to them waffle and babble on
Don't want your help, don't need your advice who rattled your cage
Know one of these days won't cease to amaze
Bunch of lost souls they ain't tryna get saved
They're just tryna get paid, wanna jump on my wave
Turn back around, jump right in my grave
Do me a favour, don't do me no favours
I don't need no savior cause I do it major
Now it's back to the paper I'll deal with the pagans later",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-pagans-lyrics

Feel so good I might rock my sliders
Walk through the manor givin' out high 5's (Hey)
I'll mix some big dirty riddim for the riders
Drop a couple jewels for the minors (YG's)
Can't forget the OG's and the old timers
Might go find me a couple fine diners
Couple entrées and a couple appetizers
No I don't drink Appletiser (No way)
Feel so good I might buy me
A German whip with the ceiling gone
Make a turn and dip with the bass on max (Whoo)
Yeah they heard my shit, yeah they heard my shit
(I know you heard it) Streaming, no CDs
No burners skipped, got the playlist
There I don't burn and rip, on the M25
Yeah I swerve and slip, yeah I swerve and slip

Might tell my man ""Pull out the jet"" (What)
I wanna go China, try out Tibet
I might go bed and forget (Wake up!)
Feel so good I might try a bit of camping
Feel so good I might try a bit of lamping (What)
Feel so good that I parked on a
Double yellow line and I don't mind if I get a clamping (Whoo)

Feel so good I might find me a wifey
Buy her some diamonds, have her all icey
But I love a hood girl, 'cause your so feisty
You ain't gotta be so pricey (Love ya)
Cooking up a curry, or mutton and ricey
Cooking up something all pepper and spicey (Hmm)
Put it on my plate, yeah that'll do nicely
You ain't gotta be so shiesty
Feel so good but I still want a prenup
Now I gotta just pre without a feel up (Hmm)
Tell a DJ that I demand a wheel up
And you know I blew the scene up (What)
Why you so vexed boy, chill out and heal up
All I do is make moves and rate my tea cup
Have a Kit Kat rude boy, best you ease up
Take time and get ya P's up (Oi)

Screwface means I'm not amused
Screwface means I just wanna walk, not talk
Screwface means I just wanna leave
When I activate my screwface, give me space
Screwface means let me breathe
I got sick flows, make an MC have to walk on his tip-toes
Life ain't always nice, that's how shit goes
And you know we're going on black 'cause we're blick rows
And I can't be seen with these sick hoes
Where did I stay last night? I think your chick knows
We were knock-knocking the boots and we kicked toes
Your girl's the same as all bimbos, freaks and nymphos
I've got an idea, make dough on the spot, I mean right here
Nike Air, got paper for the whole year
You can bring drama 'cause I got no fear
And my head feels so clear
Move to the mic, MCs are like ""oh dear""
Some try catching me up but they're not near
Not ever, not now and not here, way too hot here

Money Right,Don’t Gas Me - EP,2018.0,"Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww, shhhhhit
Yeah, yeah
Raskit and Skepta
Yutes in the end tryna get that cash
Yeah, goin' on dirty, goin' on stank

You throw a penny up the wall, pick the money up off the floor
You drip it, you flip it, tell the plug you need some more
Second time tonight, tell him you need a better price
He said the weight is heavy, tell him you need the exercise
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right (greaze)
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right

Hey, stop that, start that, get that (what?)
No, we ain't ducking no get back, it's Rascal and Skeppy
With something peppery for your headback
Ain't no disrespect better dead that
Come through stuntin' in somethin' all jet black
Mandem hustlin', crumblin', rollin' and bunnin' that jetpack
Stumblin, lungs are lookin' all jet black
Old school east side brother I rep that
You go check that you'll get your neck snapped
All of them setbacks
Kept me on the tip of my creps and I can't forget that
Forget my cheque and you will regret that
I get the cheque and they can't affect that
You better check that, this all correct up get that cheque back and I'll protect that

You throw a penny up the wall, pick the money up off the floor
You drip it, you flip it, tell the plug you need some more
Second time tonight, tell him you need a better price
He said the weight is heavy, tell him you need the exercise
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right (greaze)
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right

Go on then, go on then, we don't play (nah)
It's Skeppy and Raskit back with a brand new track yeah the London wave (smoke)
Everyday man follow me surfin' online tryna catch the wave (the wave)
Get baptised, make your whole crew capsize
Been bullying crews for days (greaze)
Tell that pussyhole stop talking rubbish
Man came in with the thuggish ruggish (greaze)
You cannot talk about the roads to a guy that's fuckin' done it (done it, done it)
Yeah, running around the street with a bally for the money
Baby fathers got the yutes with the swammy in the buggy (woah)

I'm the alpha omega, please, take what's older I slay you freeze
Lay you out where you stay that's greaze
I don't ramp I don't play and I do not bend
And I do not sway with ease, they can't sway me away from Ps
I want all of the smoke I'm wheezy and I smoked about 1000 trees
Breathe easy you know my steez, E3 and Meridian Gs
Way I move so ghost I'm local but I'm thinkin' I'm overseas
Trying to seize some vitamin D, dotting the Is and crossing the Ts
You're a joker you can't be serious if you say you aren't from my trees

You throw a penny up the wall, pick the money up off the floor
You drip it, you flip it, tell the plug you need some more
Second time tonight, tell him you need a better price
He said the weight is heavy, tell him you need the exercise
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right

Ha-ha, just like that
They never saw it coming
We don't talk for the sake of talkin', we just get it done
Yutes in the ends, tryna get that cash
East, North, South, West, big up your chest
Goin' on dirty, goin' on stank",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-money-right-lyrics
You Got the Dirtee Love,Tongue n’ Cheek: Dirtee Deluxe Edition,UnKnown,"Everybody wants to be famous
Nobody wants to be nameless, aimless
People act shameless, tryna live like entertainers
Want a fat crib with the acres
So they spend money that they ain’t made yet
Got a Benz on tik that they ain’t paid yet
Spend their pay cheque in the West End on the weekend
Got no money by the end of the weekend
But they don’t care 'cause their life is a movie
Starring Louis V, paid for by yours truly
Truthfully, it’s a joke, like a bad episode of Hollyoaks
Can’t keep up with the cover notes
So they got bad credit, livin’ on direct debit in debt
They still don’t get it
'Cause they too busy livin’ the high life, the night life
Huggin’ the high when livin’ it large and they all say
[Chorus: Florence Welch & 
Dizzee Rascal
]
Sometimes it seems that the going is just too rough
And things go wrong no matter what I do 
(That's right)
Now and then it seems that life is just too much
But you’ve got the love I need to see me through

Check it, yo, let me take you down to London city
Where the attitude’s bad and the weather is–
Everybody’s on a paper chase, it’s one big rat race
Everybody's got a screw face, so many two-face
Checkin' their high just like they're ready to ride
I’m on the inside looking at the–
So it’s an accurate reflection
City wide, north, east, west and the south side
Everywhere, I go there’s a goon on the corner
Guns and drugs 'cause the city’s like a sauna
And it’s getting warmer, and out of order
Tryna put a struggling mother to a mourner
Mr. Politician, can you tell me the solution?
What’s the answer? What’s the conclusion?
Is it an illusion? Is it a mirage?
I see youngens die because they tryna live large
And they all say
[Chorus: Florence Welch & 
Dizzee Rascal
]
Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
(Put your hands up)
I know I can count on all of you 
(That's right, that's right)
Sometimes I feel like saying, “Lord I just don’t care” 
(Woah)
But you’ve got the love I need to see me through
(Check it, check it, come on, come on)
You got the love 
(Who’s got the love?)
You got the love 
(Who’s got the love?)
You got the love 
(That’s right, that's right, that's right, that's right)
You got the love 
(Who’s got the love?)
You got the love 
(Who’s got the love?)
You got the love 
(Check it, yo)

Yo, we're living in the days of the credit crunch
Give me the dough, I’m tryna have a bunch
But I can't have rice for lunch
It's not there, ain't enough to share
It ain't fair, never dreamed that he could be rare
Who cares, who dares to make a change?
Everybody's in the club trying to make it rain
But not for famine, just for the sake of having
15 minutes of fame and everywhere’s the same
Again and again, I see the same thing
Everybody acting like they their plane sailin’
But I see rough seas ahead, maybe a recession
And then a depression in whatever profession
This is my confession, I can’t front, I’m in the forefront
Living for money, ready to start like a bungee jump
With no rope, but I ain’t tryna see the bottom
Because that's where I came from, I ain’t forgotten
[Chorus: Florence Welch & 
Dizzee Rascal
]
You got the love 
(Who’s got the love?)
You got the love
You got the love 
(That’s right, that's right, that's right, that's right, and again)
You got the love 
(C'mon, c'mon)
You got the love 
(Woahhhh)
You got the love 
(Woo!)
Who’s got the love? Who's got the love?
Who's got the love? Come on
And again, c'mon
Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on all of you
Sometimes I feel like saying, “Lord I just don’t care""
But you’ve got the love I need to see me through",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-you-got-the-dirtee-love-lyrics
Ghost,Raskit,2017.0,"Close, close, wanna get close on the coast
Ghost, ghost don’t pose and I don’t post
Close, close, wanna get close on the coast
Ghost, ghost

Pickin' me a winner
Picky hair an’ I was a little bit thinner
3310 with a customised ringer
I was tryna holla at Lavinia but she weren’t ina
Cos I was a sinner, thought I was a minger
Never had a Bimmer
Rollin’ through the ends on a stolen aprillia
Waiting for the Dominos guy to deliver for a free dinner
Thought I knew it all I was just a beginner, never was a singer
I was on pirate radio way before I heard Mike Skinner
Wagwan killer, yeah, that’s my nigga
Talk about race but its just way bigger
I ain't gonna waste no time on Twitter
Done with the jibba, cry me a river
Say it to my face or say it to my trigger
You go figure, or reconsider, Indian giver
Lookin’ for a chocolate girl with a hint of vanilla
And she can bring a Indian with her
I just want a bosom for a pillow
An’ I got a little bit o skrilla
We can get a boat and we can get a villa
Or we can be on South Beach ruining your liver
All killer, no filler

I don’t wanna brag or boast
I don’t cater and I don’t host
When they ask what I do I say I do the most
Then I get ghost, on the coast like I am supposed
Don’t pose and I do not post
And that’s why these girls wanna play me

Close, close, wanna get close on the coast
Ghost, ghost don’t pose and I don’t post
Close, close, wanna get close on the coast
Ghost, ghost

They ain't put food on my table, I rock the cradle
Big dirty stinkin’ logo I rock the label
I’ve been doin’ this since cable
I was on the graveyard shift in the studio
Only popped out for a salt beef bagel
I was on the roads when it was unstable
I’m not an angel, beef had more than a plate full
But I ain’t hateful, born in the 80s, year of the 8 ball
Come back 18, could've been a facial, would've been painful
Raised in the 90s, it was still racial, bloody disgraceful
Why are these yutes so bloody ungrateful
Talk about grime like I ain’t a staple
I was on the mic when you was in play-school
Stabbed six times yo it could have been fateful
Would have been 6 foot deep
On my bredrin’s T-shirt lookin’ distasteful
Would have been wasteful
Never would have seen the Caribbean in April
Shackin’ up with Rachel, givin’ her a face-full
Never would have been seven figures deep
Walkin’ down the street with a gorgeous freak in a chief
Screamin’ ""come out the way fool""

I don’t wanna brag or boast
I don’t cater and I don’t host
When they ask what I do I say I do the most
Then I get ghost, on the coast like I am supposed
Don’t pose and I do not post
And that’s why these girls wanna play me

Nutcrackerz,Nutcrackerz,2015.0,"Cause man ain't bumping him or you
Man ain't bumping him either
Man ain't come for him
Man ain't come to grin neither
Man ain't comforting geezers, ease up
Man ain't jumping in neither
Man just jumpy and eager beavers
Shit ain't sunken in neither
Man just old school from Gloucester Grove
When man had comfortable Fila
Back when Aston didn't even live there
It was Josh and Makeda
Back when gangsters weren't even shooting
Man took chunks with that cleaver
Back all Super Dee, Stone Love days
Yep, Jamrock Sound, Metro Media

Back in the day when I was broke
I was on Bow Road and looking out for eaters
Back in the day before I had seven figures
Our bredders were begging me for features
Back in the day before bloggers and tweeters
Before they knew I was a genius
They were the days when I was excluded
From school for fucking with my teachers
I was so damn facetious
I would leave em with fevers
Seizures, bunch of holes in my sneakers
Back in the day before I had that
Brand new Range Rover, looking devious
Previous, I was moving mischievous
None of my girlfriends were divas
Making moves was the easiest
Please don't make me get deeper
I was linking Kamika
Ice Rink and that Creeper
Had em dropping in caesars
Jesus, bunch of unstable geezers
Bunch of peelers and dealers
Demons, they were holding them beaters
We were owning them speakers

Man came back with that classic crack shit
Man came back with that Raskit
Rolled up with them Rottweilers
And came back with Bullmastiffs
Quickly grab them six brownings
Women grab me two taxis
There's a negative and a plus side
Hollow's back with new batteries
Hold up, coming back for you fassies
Better run home, call that prat the new Lassie
Them two straps are too massive
Jumped out, pap pap pap with two maccies
Quick, jump back in front seat and back seat
Pricks get bought Ribena and Capri

Don't gas me
I was on the back streets, couldn't catch me
On a jack spree
They looking at me like ""why you wanna rap me?"", that's crappy
I was ashy, not flashy
They couldn't hack me
All-black in my Nike Air tracky
And I went all out on a fassy
And I didn't make beats on a lappy
What you know about Rex in Stratty? Exactly
Had a yatty, in Hackney
Big batty, a bit scatty
But I was happy
Cause she cooked saltfish and ackee
She didn't clap me
So I've gotta give thanks to Selassie
Shy FX and UK Apache

The speaker blowing, better keep it going
Mention Hollowman when your speaker flowing
Get that mozzarella cheese, get the pizza going
Seen your gully side, now your weak is showing
My nigga Dizzee Ras, they say he's a poet
They hear we drop a track, niggas tippy-toeing
Don't come around a man with your pissy poems
I've got bitches on my dick and their lippy showing",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-nutcrackerz-lyrics
Heart Of A Warrior,The Fifth ,2013.0,"I will fight till I take my last breath
I got the heart of a warrior
The heart of a warrior
I’ve been down, I’ve been out and I bled
I got the heart of a warrior
The heart of a warrior
I’ll never back down

Born fearless, leavin when it’s delirious
Superstar and super serious
Runnin the game like I was born gearless
Deeper guy, I got the beat to live em earless
Still I know that they still hear us
Only rap, we make an appearance
So I shout, shout, let it out
Remain tearless ‘cause I’m careless
Doing it for the man dem in the hoodies and the new eras
Young ragamuffin, can't tell me nothing
Miss me with that huff and puffing
You ain't ready to buck and get stuck in
You're just doing a lot of chuckin
I’m just doing a lot of talkin'
Are you sick or something?
Are you thick or something?
You should think of ducking
Hit you with that nunchukka
I Bruce Lee your fly kick
Jump up and Tom pop and I’ve got something
Nigga they comin hard for they food
Don’t wanna see me switch and lose my cool
‘Cause I be up with that fool, hard but you have to smooth, I be actin a fool
I be actin a fool… I be actin a fool… I be actin a fool… I be actin a fool…


When the bumper clean shake the earth right underneath
Pick up the devil sides and let them call me thunder feet
If you want a war I’m not the one to meet, I’m not sure I’m the sweet
I’m like a tropic in the summer, come with heat
Not to blow my own brass but I’m having a blast
Spendin my paper fast
Think I’m movin around, start havin a laugh
Competition’s lookin over bars and I’m last nice
Be fragile, reppin the underclass
Miss me with your problems cuz I can’t be yours
Who Jeremy call, I look at the wall
You star, we size em all
You like to profile, you just a child that’s in denial
Now you’re on trial
You should bring the mind with me while we’re flexin
Good with nothing but a swagger and the crooked fall
Hentai but never get rinced out cuz I stay fresh out
No doubt, don’t say no
I’m giving a proper, keep a pitch out
I’m sittin here, I don’t think about her
I’m black tie, I’m tweeted up
It’s amazing what you can when you put your finger up


Now now I was way through the fire
Yea yea I got the eye of the tiger
So tell me, what’s gonna stop me now
God knows that I put in the hours
I can’t lose now, I got the power

Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He's a pussyhole, he's a chief leave him
Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He ain't got your back if it's beef leave him
Why you rolling with that pussyhole
Moving with that pussyhole
You know that he's a pussyhole
I showed you he's a pussyhole
He's always been a pussyhole
So he will always be a pussyhole
You're still with that pussyhole
You must be a pussyhole

As the bredda always chatting like he's strong
Sneaky fake fuck always running to his brother when it's on
Hardly backs the beef, last one swinging
First one running making them stories he's a chief
Bringing breddas to the ends, acting up
Putting on a show trying to talk funny to his friends
But his really not a don they know it
And you know it, something must be seriously wrong
Cause your parring, his mum calls you darling
But his brothers got you shotting
And we know where you're stopping
I heard you both have beef with an older breh
You took a spark and he just stood there
Now that boys a pussyhole say it ain't true
It started because of him and ended with you
And it's that kind of shit that's gonna continue
But I guess it don't matter if that's what you're into

Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He's a pussyhole, he's a chief leave him
Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He ain't got your back if it's beef leave him
Why you rolling with that pussyhole
Moving with that pussyhole
You know that he's a pussyhole
I showed you he's a pussyhole
He's always been a pussyhole

You're still with that pussyhole
You must be a pussyhole

The Sun's the biggest star in the sky
But naturally its gotta make room for the moon every night
Every friend got his time limit
Even relationships
Everything's sunny when the friendships tight
A friend in need is a friend indeed
But a friend with no money and no weed
Could flip the script at a ridiculous speed
And make a best friend and ex friend for the P
A couple years ago in my road youth days
I was into pirate radio I guess it was a phase
There was this one particular MC man
He was an older in my ends and I thought he was the dan
So I started rolling with him kind of like a little brother
My cousin used to say he was a pussy undercover
I didn't think that it was nothing more than jealousy
But I wish I woulda listened every time he told me

Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He's a pussyhole, he's a chief leave him
Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He ain't got your back if it's beef leave him
Why you rolling with that pussyhole
Moving with that pussyhole
You know that he's a pussyhole
I showed you he's a pussyhole
He's always been a pussyhole
So he will always be a pussyhole
You're still with that pussyhole
You must be a pussyhole
Pussyhole, Pussyhole
Pussyhole, Pussyhole

Stay away from those pussyholes, you can have it all
Live endlessly tremendous forever ball
Stand up for something or for anything you'll fall
But definitely know when not to lose your cool
Cause it ain't what you show, it's what your concealing
Put a smile on the deepest negative feeling
Stand tall even when their hating and their scheming
Then watch your money rise right to the ceiling
Stand tall even when their hating and their scheming
Yea watch your money rise right to the ceiling

Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He's a pussyhole, he's a chief leave him
Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He ain't got your back if it's beef leave him
Why you rolling with that pussyhole
Moving with that pussyhole
You know that he's a pussyhole
I showed you he's a pussyhole
He's always been a pussyhole
So he will always be a pussyhole

Jack an’ nab
Had to snatch and grab
I was black and sad
Couldn’t even catch a cab
Sittin’ in the pad
Thinkin’ I was bad
Like a chav
I was savvy
Had the gab
I was shabby
Never had the swag
GAP jacket turned into a bag
It was fab
Just a slightly dodgy fad
At the time it was the greatest swag I had
Old dear used to nag
Every time I brought a slag into the pad
I was glad
Caught the clap I couldn’t blag
I wave the flag
Now I wrap it when I shag
Listenin’ to makaveli
Thinkin’ I was rags

Sippin Alizé
Not the Hennessey
It made me gag
Now I’m older Thug Passion really sounds like just a dodgy porno mag
That is not a jab

With his brother Bills
Back when rap was all about the skills Canibus, Sticky Fingaz, Eminem and Cypress Hill
Had the time to kill
Sit and chill
Debate about who had the sickest verse
Who your favourite was and who was ill
Strictly for the thrill
Yeah I’m Dylan but they used to call me Dyl
Before the the deal
Mr Mills fell in love with Natalie
She had a wavy pair of lils
Gave me chills but she was crazy
Always all up in my grill
No she wasn’t from the grill
She was Bajan then occasionally
Brought her bredrin down from Gypsy Hill
Who I really didn’t feel
If I had to keep it absolutely real
Then she didn’t feel me either
Doubt she’ll leave me in her will
Went to PFC and watched my bredrin jump up on the counters
Stab the boss across the till
It was probably over nil
Overkill
Must have dropped a dodgy pill
This is not a bloody drill
Somebody call the ambulance
The bloods about to spill

So Solid next it was a good sign
More Fire blew
But Heartless crew they had the good vibes

On the grind
Cookin’ grime
On the champagne dance shoot
Thinkin’ I was lookin’ fine
Saw the rise and the decline
The extortion and the devils on the sidelines
Bitchin’cos they couldn’t get the shine
It was deep and I could peep
They tried to creep up from behind
Talkin’ ‘bout they want a piece
So I went and bought a piece
It was a (nine)
Told myself nobody’s ever takin’ mine
I’ll go blind if they ever cross the line
But I never wanted pressure from the swine
Got me thinkin’ bout my struggles
And the mountain that I had to climb

Jezebel,Boy in da Corner,2003.0,"Yo, look, look, look
They call her Jezebel, you might find her in your neighbourhood
Always in some shit, up to no good
Constant boasting, bragging to her friends
Juiced every boy in the ends
Didn't finish school, she went truant every day
Always on the link, different boy every day
Missed mathematics, she was doing acrobatics
But not gym class, she was getting doggy fast
Yo, they call her Jezebel, friends call her sket behind her back
She never knew the plot, she was born off track
Tight top, short skirt, thinks she's too nice
Hates love, but she's been deep in twice
Pars with hoes, she can't keep her legs closed
Always on the creep, now she's in too deep
Now she faces neglect, abuse and rape
Man said that he'd kill her if she tried to escape

Whats your name? I've seen you about
I think you're choong, boom ting
(I really hope you're not a grim
I really hope you're not a jezzy, jezzy)
Where you from, hot stuff? Buff ting
(I really hope you're not a grim
I really hope you're not a jezzy, jezzy)
I've seen you about

I really hope you're not a Jezebel)

You might find her at a house rave
For the fifth time, she's getting wined from behind
Had a bit to drink so she's acting kinda slow
She came with Natasha but she's leaving with Joe
Ricky loves Jezzy but Jezzy loves bling
Ricky means well but Ricky ain't got a thing
Joe's got a name and Jezzy loves fame
She wants a man to show so it's all about Joe
They call her Jezebel, on her way to get wocked out
Get batteried and get kicked out
Jezzy weren't expecting more then four
But what could she say? She just did it anyway
Messed up, caught a kind of STD
Gonorrhoea, Herpes, no, VD
Left bitter, left angry, left vexed
But still loved sex, passed it on to the next

Whats your name? I've seen you about
I think you're choong, boom ting
(I really hope you're not a grim
I really hope you're not a jezzy, jezzy)
Where you from, hot stuff? Buff ting
(I really hope you're not a grim
I really hope you're not a jezzy, jezzy)
I've seen you about
I think you're tromp, boom ting
(I really hope you're not a grim
I really hope you're not a jezzy, jezzy)
I know your face, where you from, hot stuff? Buff ting
(I really hope you're not grim
I really hope you're not a Jezebel)

Pretty but ain't got a brain
Got no shame, got juiced on the train
Went from daddy's little girl to daddy's heart attack
House wreck aside, she could never go back
Raised in the church not knowing anything
Then learned about boys and ruined everything
Age sixteen, she was never full grown
She was in a family, now she's got one of her own
Two kids, even worse, two little girls
Two more of her, that's two Jezebels
Two fatherless kids, one single mum
No longer young, but the boys still come
Yo, wishin' she could take it back to the old school
And make better choices, oh, what a fool
Bottle by her side, she wonder, man
If only she was six years younger, damn",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-jezebel-lyrics
Something Really Bad,The Fifth ,2013.0,"Yo, I had a hell of a night
I was out of my mind
Turned up I was high as a kite
A jolly fellow
I was showing my bright whites
And getting trippy under the strobe lights
I’m loving the nightlife
And getting jiggy keeping the vibe right
Setting my mind alight
Getting the party hype
Pretty little thing in my eyesight
She’s my type
Something’s telling me
She ain’t uptight
She’s giving me the eyes like
What are you waiting for
I’m looking at her back like
Cool say no more
I save my jaw but I ain’t playing
Are you fucking yeah?
I’m saying it raw
She didn’t take no offence
I was straight in the door
I guess I hit her with an offer
That she couldn’t ignore
It all happened so fast
Like I met her before
But I was so damn high
How could I be sure
Now we’re in my hotel room taking a tour

Let’s get into something really bad
Love me baby love me love me bad
I love it when the good girls act so bad
I love it when the bad girls do it like that
Let’s get into something really bad
Love me baby love me love me bad
I love it when the good girls act so bad
I love it when the bad girls do it, do it, like, like that
Get freaky, let’s get freaky
Get freaky, let’s get freaky

Now it’s totally on
Pour a couple more drinks
Put some Jodeci on
Put a towel under the door
And put the privacy on
We’re stinking up the whole place
The weed’s overly strong
We should be getting undressed
Now take off your thong
I’ll help you with your bra strap
And then I hit you with the long and the strong
And you can make as much noise
Till your vocals are gone
It feels right coz it’s totally wrong
But we’re just living the good life
Like everyone should, right?
I’m giving her good pipe
We’re having a good night
I’m pretty sure one day
She’ll be a good wife
And that’s a good luck
But it’s not in my foresight
But that don’t matter now
We’re gonna fuck till the sunlight
I hit her from the back
Now I’m gripping the bumper tight
Whole lot of banging
I ain’t bragging
You would think it’s a gunfight
I’m happy that you’ve come
Now give me the light


Yo I come clean
You can swallow you ain’t gotta spit
And you ain’t gotta go home
But I gotta split
And if it’s all the same
I’m really glad you came
You kept me entertained
I weren’t doin shit
I got a couple things
That I gotta do today
But I’m great and I’m really glad
I woke up with you today
I probably said a couple things
I don’t usually say
And I know you’re not a ho
You don’t usually play
You would never just leave
You would usually stay
Never had a one night stand
That’s okay
Ain’t got to explain
Nothing wrong with sharing long
It’s just an exchange",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-something-really-bad-lyrics
Brand New Day,Boy in da Corner,2003.0,"Yo, MC's better start chatting about what's really happening
Because if you ain't chatting about what's happening
Where you living? What you talking about?
'Cause you know and I know, it's gonna be a hot summer (Yo)
And you know what (It's Live-O), it's gonna be an even hotter winter (It's Live-O)
And I ain't even talking about the weather (Dizzee Ras', roll deep on these)
Dizzee Rascal, uh

Looks like I'm losing friends, there's a lot of hostility in my ends
We used to argue, always make up and be friends (Uh)
Now we settle disagreements with the skengs (Yo)
Looks like I'm losing mates, there's a lot hostility near my gates
We used to fight with kids from other estates
Now eight millimetres settle debates (Woo)
Looks like I'm losing sight 'cause I'm looking at the future, it ain't bright
So I look out my window and pray every night
I thank God for my friends, but they ain't tight (Yo)
Looks like I'm losing hope, 'cause I climb this mountain without rope
But I know I'm the captain of my boat (Uh), so I steadily sail and hope not to float (Live-O)

But it's a brand new day (Yo), new opportunities, what can I say? (What can I say? Uh)
I plan to make my paper (Yo), put some away for a off key day (Uh, put it away)
But it's a brand new day (Yo), new opportunities, what can I say? (Live-O, yo)
I plan to make my paper (Uh), put some away for a off key day (Uh, yo)
Yo, demand collect, cash up front and direct (Uh)
Pay money, pay respect, don't insult my intellect
No, demand collect, cash up front and direct
Pay money, pay respect (Yo), don't insult my intellect (Yo)

When we ain't kids no more will it still be about what it is right now?
Like fighting for anything, anytime and acting without a care anywhere (Yo)
And when we ain't kids no more (Uh), will it still be about what it is right now?
Like bank scams, street robbery, shotters plotters
 or 
H.M.P
And when we ain't kids no more, will it still be about what it is right now? (Yo)
Pregnant girls who think they love, useless mans with no plans
And when we ain't kids no more, will it still be about what it is right now?
'Cause negative signs just keep showing up (Showing)
Some of us better just start growing up (Yo)

But it's a brand new day (Live, uh), new opportunities (Yo), what can I say? (Live, what can I say?)
I plan to make my paper (Yo), put some away for a off key day (Uh, put it away)
But it's a brand new day (Uh, yo), new opportunities (Roll Deep), what can I say? (Get me? What can I say?)
I plan to make my paper, put some away for a off key day (Uh)
Yo, demand collect, cash up front and direct (Yo)
Pay money, pay respect (Get me?), don't insult my intellect (What?)
Demand collect, cash up front and direct (Uh)
Pay money, pay respect, don't insult my intellect

When I look at my life, I can't help but think
'Cause I could've resorted to drugs and drink
Everyday was the same as the day before
We were never quite sure of what's in store
Every day I wake up I can't help but feel
Uncertain of life, I mean this is real
Mad thoughts skip around my head like dancers
I know it's long to question, but I need answers
The who's? The what's? The how's? The when's? The why's?
You can at look in my face and see the pain in my eyes
Tears ready to fall like the rain in the skies
So hold back, put my feet down and rise
'Cause guys wanna test my words
So I can't just cater for second or third
Plus I know predators only go for the weak
And that's long so I gotta stay strong, you get me?

But it's a brand new day (Uh), new opportunities, what can I say? (Uh, what can I say?)
I plan to make my paper (Uh), put some away for a off key day (Yeah, put it away)
But it's a brand new day (Uh), new opportunities, what can I say? (What can I say? Uh)
I plan to make my paper (Uh), put some away for a off key day (It's Live-O)
Yo, demand collect (Demand collect), cash up front and direct (Uh uh-huh)
Pay money, pay respect (Pay respect), don't insult my intellect (No-no, no)
Demand collect (Uh-huh), cash up front and direct (Pay me man)
Pay money, pay respect (Yo), don't insult my intellect

Uh
Get me?
It's real like that
We're not fucking about
Yo
You're know we're going on dirty, going on skank
Summers gonna be real man

Sirens,Maths + English,2007.0,"Blud when you hear them sirens coming
I can hear them sirens coming
Better run when you hear them sirens coming
I can hear them sirens coming

One-to-the-two-to-the-three-to-the-four
Limehouse police knocking at my door
Twelve black boots on my bedroom floor
What they want with Rascal I'm not sure
Took me to the station 8:30
For a fight that I had recently
Say they got me on CCTV
And a pussyole boy's told on me
Can't understand why these brers keep snitching
Can't understand why these brers keep bitching
Now I'm hot tempered, feel like switching
Can't stand still, trigger finger itching
Gotta stay calm, gotta keep my cool
If I go jail, I'll be a damn fool
Gotta rise up, gotta stand up tall
Can't let them see the end of Dizzee Rascal


Yo man, let's take it back to 
that old-school storytelling shit
Get me?

One day I was with my bredren Adar roaming the street
On the main road, hungry looking for something to eat
Not no burger and no chips, shit that's easily digested
It's that shit that if you re caught you'll be easily arrested
We was on a robbing spree, I forgot to mention Clayton
Was this bredder rolling with us, he was scared and it was blatant
He was prang but back to the story, Adar spotted a man
Straight ahead of us in the distance with his 
wifey
 holding hands
So we followed them through this little alleyway into the flats
When we thought the time was perfect, we crept up and we attacked
I took the first swing, unexpected causing panic
We was ruthless causing agony in public, it was tragic
Me and Adar lost the plot, acting like we was from Hell
Beat this bredder to the floor, moved his wifey up as well
Clayton stood back shaking, wishing that he'd never came
Then from out of nowhere was Alicia screaming out my name
She went my school, she saw it all, and by this time, she's crying
And to make it worse I'm hearing sirens, I ain't even trying to hang around


I can hear them sirens coming
I can hear them sirens coming
I break the law, I will never change
I break the law, I will never change
I break the law, I will never change
Step into my zone, get your whole face re-arranged

See me on the telly but I ain't no actor
Running through the street bait-faced, it's a jackwa
Broad daylight, no shame like a lunatic
Rain, hail, sleet or snow, I ain't new to it
Show me what you got, better give it up quickly
Lay them on their back if they chat back swiftly
Better mind out when they come through the manor, man
Keep them on their toes like Hammer, man
It's no joke, man, woman, and child I'm seeking
See, no sex, no age, I'm creeping
Anything for the dough, code of the 
wheelers
Duck from the feds and I roll with the dealers
Par with the hard heads and young offenders
No, my life ain't nothing like EastEnders
Step into my zone, get your whole face re-arranged
I break the law, I will never change",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-sirens-lyrics
Wot U Gonna Do?,Raskit,2017.0,"Wot u gonna do when your money ain't long?
Wot u gonna do when your name ain't strong?
Wot u gonna do when they won't play your records?
And you don't get booked 'cause your buzz is all gone?
Sittin' there tryna' write the same old song
Tryin' to work out where it all went wrong
Wot u gonna do when your fans don't care
'cause they're all grown up and they all moved on?
Wot u gonna do when it goes downhill?
Callin' up girls, but they don't wanna' chill
Wot u gonna do when you wanna roll out?
But they don't wanna know cause they ain't no thrill
If looks could kill, how would it feel?
Ain't on the guest list, ain't on the bill
What you gonna do when you clock it was all your fault?
You were too busy keeping it real
Wot u gonna do when the walls close in?
Wot u gonna do when it all goes grim?
Wot u gonna do when it's all on top and they still wanna know if you're on this ting?
Everybody wants to take shots at the king
Wot u gonna do, sink or swim?
Wot u gonna do, theres a whole lot of love and a whole lot of hate and the line is thin?
Wot u gonna do when it ain't all sweet?
Wot u gonna do now when your kids gotta eat?
Wot u gonna do, cause you got too far
You're a star, you can't go back to the streets?
Can't disappear, kick back for a week
It's actually peak!
Wot u gonna do, keep quiet or speak?
Ain't nobody gonna shed no tears, get back on your feet

Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do when it's all on you?

Wot u gonna do when it ain't all about you?

Wot u gonna do, you don't set no trends, drop no gems?
Wot u gonna do, you ain't got not friends, no one to fend gotta make amends?
Wot u gonna do, when there's no top tens
Wot u gonna do, when you gotta downgrade, no chauffeured Benz?
People lookin' at it like ""Raah, swear down what's good? Never thought I'd see you in the ends""
Deep breath and takin' a pause
Gonna end up breakin' fools
Looks like nobody is down for the cause
Wot u gonna do, when the tax man is banging at your door and you know you've been breaking the rules?
Should have read that payment clause
Wot u gonna do, when the cheques don't come and your lawyer dips out, stops takin' your calls
Wot u gonna do, when the sun don't shine?
Can't unwind, when you're online
Everybody sayin' that ""You're past your prime.""
Wot u gonna do, when you know MC's keep cattin' your flow but you can't get signed?
Wot u gonna do, when you get locked up cause you ain't got money for the parking fine?
Wot u gonna do, when it all goes sideways
Gotta work weekend shifts at Mac D's, and you can't party on a Friday
Wot u wanna do is just fly away
Wanna get ghost on the highway
Wot u gonna do, when you ain't that guy and the girls don't stop and say ""Hi babe?""
Better just stay on the grind mate

Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do when it's all on you?
Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?

Trust me, trust me, trust me, yo

Keepin' it trill
In the home of the brave
Chillin' wit' the OG
UGK
Rollin' up swishers, and I smoke till I faint
Draped up whilst hitting them switches in the car all covered in candy paint
I'm rollin' round H-Town
Where Texas mandem hold me down
I'm rollin' round H-Town where
Where Texas mandem hold me down
I'm tollin' round H-Town
Where Texas mandem hold me down
I said, rollin' round H-Town

I'm rollin' round H-Town
Texas mandem hold me down
Actin' an arse, yeah I fool around
You know it's all mad when I'm in town
No I don't drink that purple juice
DJ Screw got me feelin' loose
Might put a diamond in my tooth
I've got a lot of money, that's my excuse
Sitting in the slab with Trill OG
Holding a smoke in a big old tree
Looking for a girl with a big old B
And she can swallow these nuts ASAP
I've got an attitude like Pimp C
These hoes ain't getting no sympathy
And breddas better not talk shit to me
Cause that's a good way to get an injury
Whole lot of goons and whole lot of guns
Now we're in the strip club, throwing up a lot of ones
There's a whole lot of titties and a whole lot of bums
Yeah the down south breddas, they're a whole lot of fun
And I'm always on a hype when I come, there's a whole lot of sure and I never wanna leave, the party's never done
We just take it to the parking lot, and then we laugh a lot, until they call the cops, yo


Man, got a call from a boy from the boy from London
Young Diz, what it do my G?
Said he wanna come down to the states
You already know that's cool with me
I'm in H-town posted up
Let's get some drinks, toast it up
Hit up the scene and light up some green
And burn that purp till we roasted, what
Pick rudeboy up the Jag
Fresh as fuck and we got the swag
And we rollin' clean
And we acting bad
And these boys wanna hate, why you mad?
Gladiators stay on deck
You don't want them boys catch your wreck
Cause they'll bus your face
And they'll break your neck
You better back up bitch and show respect
Before your ass get checked


When I pull up in the city in a back of a slab
I got a late night bitch saying come out the cab
I'll have a whole trunk going off like jabs
Nigga everything paid, I ain't got no tabs
Do this here for Texas, that's my city
Diamonds all in my chain, they cost like 50
Yeah, I'm up in the gutter where niggas play gritty
Ain't nothing here pretty
We bad like Diddy
Everything screwed up where I'm from, slow it up
R.I.P. Big Moe, everybody pouring up
When I throw the hood up, everybody shown up
If I make it out the gate, everybody blowing up

The Other Side,Raskit,2017.0,"Tell the barber stop fuckin' with my hairline
Got mine fitted to the side when I wear mine
Why these boys keep reachin' for my plate
Knowin' I don't wanna share mine?
Why these boys keep lyin' when they swear blind?
Why they talking like I never made bare grime?
Talk tools like I never had a spare 9
Why they reachin' for my pockets like it's their grind?
They better recline, 
don't don't need a co-sign from the mayor
Cos I got a pretty penny, I ain't beggin' in my spare time
Why these bitches wanna hit me with the bare whine?
Tell me hit it bareback, these bitches ain't even worth the airtime
Why these singers always gotta use Melodyne?
Why these rappers on their phone on the radio
They ain't got prepared lines?
Why you gotta keep gassin' up their dead rhymes?
Why I gotta be a hater when I tell the truth?
Why I gotta like your shitty fire in the booth?
If you're really spittin' fire where's the bloody proof?
I ain't hatin' on the youth, if you ain't got the juice
What's the bloody use?
Cos I'm used to the true spitters on the roof
East side of the river that's the bloody roots
Had to put in work like a pair of muddy boots
Too big for my boots that's the truth
No excuse for you new recruits
Bunch of dilutes, and a few flukes
I've been out of the loop
Gotta pepper MCs with a few nukes
Bunch of fashion MCs think they're too cute
Bunch of rubbish MCs stick em in a chute
Chuck em out of a helicopter with no parachute
I had to jump through hoops
I'm a true brute, it ain't up for dispute

How bad do you want it?
Do you really, really want it?
How bad do you want it?
Do you really, really want it?
How bad do you want it?
Do you really, really want it?
Do you really, really want it?
If you want it then I'm on it

Why these bredders beggin' a re-union?
Why's the Godfather touchin' on the kids?
Why you actin' like you never knew and he's movin' new again?
There ain't ever gonna be another crew again
So tell Willy that I don't need a pen pal
Stop writin' me these letters
Cos I don't know what to do with them
It ain't ever gonna be '03 or '02 they don't do it how I did it
Somebody tell me what I've gotta prove again
I was runnin' round the manor like a hooligan
I was linkin' up with Gavin he was slewin' them
Would have been a mad ting if he blew
All these little grime kids ain't got a clue
I ain't even got a problem with the newer gen
But all these rappers that you're begging I will ruin them
And tell Mega he can make all the noise that he wants
But I'll put him on his arse in a swamp with a few of them
They're still talkin' about my old wars
Folklore still talkin' bout my old bars
Got my thinkin' that it's all I'm really known for
I ain't runnin' from no-one I fought my own wars
C1 NORTHSTAR, thats a war lord
If they only knew the way, flip the scoreboard
And tell Wes that he's pukka and a mukka
He's still a mad man, and a nutter and the heat I just can't afford
Coz I'm on tour, they want an encore
Yeah sure that's what I'm on for
Tell the promoters that they gotta put me on more
I'm like an elevator stoppin' at the wrong floor
I ain't got no regrets, if I did have a set
It would be that I never flew Concorde
Now my flow is complete 'cah I don't want no raasclaat beat

The dopest, flyest
OG, pimp hustler, gangster player
Hardcore motherfucker living today
To be honest I’m totally and completely on his dick
And you know this, MAN

Dem boy not ready yet, trend they can never set
Inside outside, inside outside
Stop dat, start dat, get dat
Yo, you know, going on dirty going on stank (Yo)

Roll deep on these (Uh)
Put these MC’s on deep freeze (Freeze)
Hit these, whip these and rip these
Come like Busta, we flip these
So please don’t rap with these (Nah)
Fearless, angry, sick MC’s
Don’t like Christine’s or Britney’s
Lalas or Tinky Winkys
And this one's strictly for pickneys
Old school afro dry white knees
Barclays, Halifax, we stick these
Endless gunshots, you lick these
Trick these CIDs with ease
Touch mic, MC's jump like fleas
Player haters get chopped like trees
Come a boy rascal, to a boy miseries

It seems to be cars and cash and (Uh) girls and peds
And manners on flame (Uh), better keep your eyes out for them feds
It seems to be phones and bling and raves and weed (Weed)
And pay up what you owe or else them boys will make you bleed
Seems to be DJ's and MC's and gold and Nike's
We roll deep for the money; we don’t want no technicalities
It seems to be love and war and hate and life
Harsh life, hustle life, thug life, street life

So far from clean (So far)
Play kiss chase with your aunt Maureen
Get rhymes, get heard, get seen
Dizzee run things like Idi Amin
Keep vigilant, keep on guard
We chuck grenades at Scotland Yard
Retard gets kicked hard, real hard
Leave death threats in your birthday card

Dream,Showtime,2004.0,"How am I gonna pull this off man without sounding dumb?
This is too sensible for me man
How you gonna have a dream come true?

I used to dream about crazy little things like fame
In the days hanging outside the off-licence
We used to run around the streets, reckless with no shame
Mainly up to no good, a whole world of nonsense
And when the girls would walk by we would try to catch their eye
And if they didn't show face we would act immature
Had a thing for 
south
 and Hackney girls since I was a kid
A couple of west girls on my radar I was raw
And I was dead sure that I knew it all
The whole world against me attitude, I nearly blew it all
I find it a real big struggle gettin' through it all
I swear I didn't wanna listen cause I sure didn't care
Not knowing for reality, I'd have to prepare
Cos money don't grow on no stick, well it's rare
Me and boy was still looking less and less the lick
Plus I was growing up, life was looking like a scare

Happy talky talky happy talk
Talk about things you like to do
You got to have a dream
If you don't have a dream
How you gonna have a dream come true?

I used to love music, it was like my hidden hobby
But I couldn't get on on local radio back then
So I went to North London, I trot to Tottenham to be precise
And got some air time on Heat FM
Then it escalated, I was getting ratings here and there
And carried on until eventually I was everywhere
I started doing all the hot spots, Ministry, Caesar's Palace, P area time in MV
I did the grim and the glam
I did the poor and the posh
I didn't hang around, I wanted my money in a rush
Mind frame in the studio at this stage
No time to chat, I didn't wanna N-gage
I found myself a new hustle it was beautiful
And unlike the one before, a bit more suitable
The more challenging it got, the more I fought it
Made an album, over 100,000 people bought it
Thank you


To all the youngers cotchin' on the stairs in the flats
With the superstar soccer-lings, Beckham in the makings
You can go far if you put your mind to it
You're a star, don't wait to be told, just do it
Try to keep school in your plans
 
don't be worrying about your mans
They'll be there in the end if they're real, if they ain't
Don't be making no effort to impress
Cause you'll find out where you are, just do what you feel
Young babymothers, yo I got your back as well
Young babyfathers, hold it down for your girl
I ain't trying to preach but for what it's worth
That kid's the next generation Planet Earth
Big shout to the world cause I've been all around
And when I'm gone I'm always thinking about my hometown
I'm from the LDN there's no forgetting that
And the big UK I stay reppin' that

You love that
You tell me you don't love that",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-dream-lyrics

London city forever, you know I still creep
Ain't no stopping me ever your best move
Live O Ghetto, I rep it with no redemption
World wide critics acclaim I'm big news
Showtime main event you can't defeat
Dizzee Ras, not on your Nelly I can't lose

East side boy I make da paper rise
Never been anything like these faker guys
Big up my north west, south east ties
Every section where my connection lies
East side boy I make the crowd go loops
Never had a desire for shiny suits (Nope)
Big up my Midlands, up north troops
Any place my face gathers up groups

Get your backs up, backs up, back off the wall

Don't give it half-hearted, give it all
Pull up your socks and stand up tall
Backs up, backs up, back off the wall
Sounds of the Youngstar and Dizzee Rascal
Don't give it half-hearted, give it all
Pull up your socks and stand up tall

You can't run the marathon without training
Or stretch the art form without straining
Too much hype not enough braining
Whole lot o' money, little maintaining
Whole lot o' complaining, no plan (What?)
Little more, no less then ten grand
Blinging, ice sitting nice in your hand
Too much platinum, not enough land

East side boy I make the paper rise
Never been anything like these faker guys
Big up my Ireland, Scotland ties
Every section where my connection lies
East side boy I made the crowd go loops
Never had a desire for shiny suits (Nope)
Big up my Europe, USA troops
Any place my face gathers up groups

Pull up your socks and stand up tall

To my east-side crew get paper
To my west-side crew get paper
To my south-side crew get paper
I tell the player hater, ""see you later""
To my north-side crew get paper

Don't be dumb, come with your gun, I ain't fun
When I come I'm coming to stun, you get bunned
Midnight, broad daylight fight, dogfight
You don't really want it with Dizzee, I get busy
You don't really want me to pop, I get fizzy
Real fizzy bill up a zoot, we smoke whizzy
He knows, she knows, we're tough negros
Forever ready and I'll be ready forever
You don't wanna try a ting, I'll put holes in your leather
So please never ever try try and be clever
I'll be wetting MC's like rainy weather
To the two faced get your screw face laced in
Get chased and get placed in the bin
Get a slicing, battering, working
Dizzee boy don't stop til it's hurting

Pretty lil' brown things, all about my timin'
London City got 'em handin'
Catch 'em branin', get the pussy though I'm panin'
So I get these star techniques outstandin'
Did it in a council flat on the landin'
I'm not rappin', neither puffin' and pantin'
On a one night stand thing
Just like Shauna, she didn't even gimme no drama
After the show, she was on my banana
After my seeds like a farmer
Let 'em all out in her mouth; I'm a charmer
Couldn't care less about karma or Carmen
Got 'er titties out in the bottom off my garden
I'm a bad boy, I don't beg no pardon
Pick 'em up and then I discard 'em

I had this pretty lil' girl in Sweden
Yeah, she was kinda short but she was easin'
I like that kinda girl, you didn't even need to ask her name
Could you believe it?
She was suckin' my dick, you should have seen it
Got up and tried to kiss me in between it, 'low it
Could you imagine my disappointment?
Sprayed her in her mouth then watched her kiss her boyfriend
Yo, ask Angie 'cause she familiar
Got out my dick at the back of the cinema
Jamie Foxx, you know the kingdom one
She dealt with my dick 'til my kingdom cum
I'm a movie star, I'm quite unique on the camera
Wasn't quite like Green Street but I hammered her
I'm a player and a manager
Have a whole lot of game and a whole lot of stamina

I get freaky, freaky, freaky
And I get nasty, nasty, nasty
Do anythin' that you want me to
Just ask me, ask me, ask me

I know a couple white girls outside Yardley's
Give a couple of light skins tings like Harvey
Plus Barbie, that's my blond ting
She gimme brain in my car, no long ting
She ain't scared, she's on this ting
And she's always up for a bonkin'
Yo, my love life looks like Flava Flav's
I got girls for days, I got dark skin, pink, yellow, brown and beige
Come like a rainbow on a rainy day, non-discriminate
Long and strong and the sex is brilliant
Please make sure to contact Brazilian
Don't stop 'til I can't cum like William
So I keep drillin' on facsimilian

I get freaky, freaky, freaky
And I get nasty, nasty, nasty

But I'm lookin' for hour booties mostly
Eighteen to twenty-one
Anyone under the age don't fit the bill
But to all my independent ladies bring that pussy at will

Couple of stacks'll make the ratch go click-clack

I'll kill you
I'll kill everything you stand for
Cause you're a bitch and a manwhore
I'll settle the damn score and more
About my own beef, I don't care about a gang war
Ain't hard to shoot
It ain't hard to fall
So what you waiting for?
I'll break your jaw
I'll take the law into my own hands
You wanna fuck me up? I've got my own plans
Keep running your cakehole
I'll have you buried in the ground like a potato
You better lay low
Fall back when I say so
I'll have you dressed all white wearing a halo
All I really give a damn about is the pesos
I let the devil take over
Believe I'm colder
And the chip on my shoulder
Is more bigger and bolder
And I'm out of control so don't say I never told ya
(Ma'am, are you alright?)
Think I'm some kind of cunt?
Think that I won't pull some kind of stunt?
Think that I won't leave some kind of lump?
Pull out the pump like it's that time of month?
And don't think I'm some kind of monk
Or a peacemaker, a deceased hater is the best kind
Don't wanna see me go blind
Don't cross the line
Cause it's about that time
No defence, I ain't sitting on the fence
I bust a head if I really want to vent
Or I could just kick back, be a gent
Or put a price on your head

Stop chatting the place up
Don't mean I have to start smacking your face up
If I weren't doing this I'd be jacking the place up
Laced-up, on row, somebody's getting drapsed-up
Ready to take stuff
So pick up the pace
I stay on your case
Stacking my papes up
Keep a firm grip on the tool
I never break up
And I stand tall, I'm cool
I can never shake up
Feeling foolish if you raise up
A pool of blood, you got blazed-up
You got ahead of yourself
Just steady yourself
And you think you're heavy
But your really not ready
Just settle yourself
I suggest you fix up
If you skitz out it'll all be tits-up
R.I.P. you don't wanna get ripped-up and zipped-up
All cause you're running your lips up
Don't bother getting a mix up
Just stay in your lane
I'm fucked in the head
That's the way of my brain
And I'm insane
We ain't the same
So refrain from chatting my name for capital gain
Cause this ain't a game
When you're dead
They'll say it's a shame
Talking 'bout all you could have been if you weren't slain
And you've only got yourself to blame
So forget the fame
If you think I just entertain
No defence, I ain't sitting on the fence
I bust a head if I really want to vent

She's not having it, thinks he's some prick
He don’t believe it, wants it just the how it was in school
He keeps callin' night or mornin'
Break of evenin', break of dawnin'
He keeps ringing up, she keeps hanging up, oh, what a fool
She is the best friend of the ex-girlfriend of her old school friend
Who is the close friend of this best friend
Best friend likes this boy called Blue
Best friend loves him, best friend needs him
But the ex-girlfriend of the old school friend
Who is the close friend of his best friend likes him too
So the ex-girlfriend of the old school friend
Who is the close friend of his best friend
Sits with best friend who by now has slept with Blue
Now the ex-girlfriend don’t want to pretend
That she ain't slept with that boy Blue
'Cause he was a friend of her ex-man too

What's all this love ting talk?
Holding hands everywhere that you walk?
She turned you bocat and now you lick toes
And she's not faithful, everybody knows
She keeps saying that she loves you
What made you think that was true?
Just let a baiders walk through
I guarantee that'll be the end of you, look
True say that girl's the boom ting, man
But she's trouble, she'll make your head spin, man
Slow down back off the love ting, man
You don't wanna be left hurtin', man
Cut the sweet talk, it ain't workin', man
And move on, she's already blurted, man
You ain't the first, you won't be her last man
You feel worse, 'cause you know you're too fast man

Business Man,Raskit,2017.0,"Ayy!
You know what they say
They say God helps those who help themselves and the Devil makes work for idle thumbs
Fuck it

No boy can’t run me, sun me
Any given Sunday
Move like Crocodile Dundee
Daggar in my undies
Lookin’ for a chick like Chun-Li
Thick in the hips not dumpy
Bumpers bumpy
Ready for the Rumpy Pumpy
Pum pum junkie
Side guys lookin’ all grumpy
Thinkin’ I’m cunt
Lookin’ at me stuntin’
Wishin’ they could jump me
Leave me all lumpy
Crooked and stumpy
Bet you any money that you wouldn’t get 1p
You silly monkey
MTV gotta punk me
Don’t be a numpty
Don’t get comfy
Try me it’ll get funky
Couldn’t take me for a flunky
Now I just slump in the country
Country bumkin
Lookin’ all chunky
I ain’t got a monthly
Done with the mortgage
Coulda had a bigger house
But I got it figured out
So I bloody bought it
I ain’t gotta forfeit
They ain’t got a audit
But I’ll endorse it
Stay in your lane rudeboy
Don’t force it
Runnin’ on ice when you know you gotta walk it
I walk the walk and I talk it
Talk is cheap everybody could afford it
You can still kill a fine wine if you cork it
Tastes like horse shit
I call the bullshit, sort it
I don’t report it
Won’t see me in the dock or on the pulpit
See me in the tinted whip with a sport kit
No spare tire an' the boots in the front with a tool kit
Didn’t import it
I ain't gotta make no noise
If I want something done I will sort it

I’m a business man
I got a business plan
I got the wickedest brand
I’m so gifted and
You just sit and jam
I keep the business ran
You got it twisted fam
Go handle your business man
I’m a business man
I got a business plan
I got the wickedest brand
I’m so gifted and
You just sit and jam
I keep the business ran
You got it twisted fam
Go handle your business man

Don’t take no losses
Roll with the bosses
I’m my own boss and I don’t sit sippin’ on coffee in a office
Cuttin’ across, cuttin’ them costs
Sittin’ on profit
Plus I’m a pro and a prophet
Who’s gonna stop it?
Custom whistle I cop it
I’m lookin’ stocky and they do not stock it
Raisin’ the stock and I’m off like a rocket
All kinda P in my pocket
Back in the day had a bee in my bonnet
Moronic
Nowadays companies comin’ to me and I tell ‘em my fee and they’re on it
Take it or leave it or I do not want it
Spare me the sonnet
If you could pree what I pree you would probably vomit
Gotta admit it’s ironic
Gotta iron out all the pros and dosy sheep
Dressed in wolf’s clothing
Only keep cool and composed I’m rollin’ so
Cold I feel frozen
Chosen now my ego is swollen
Head above shoulders
Tryna keep a hold of my soul
While holdin’ on to my goals
My goal is go, go and unload
And holdin' on to old flows a no go
Pogo, not me I stay low I’m solo
All my foes are so old and over
I ain’t even involved I’m global
Good as gold I don’t phone up soldier
No gold in my molar
Older, bigger, bolder, bipolar, owner
All I know is I don’t owe ya

I’m a business man
I got a business plan
I got the wickedest brand
I’m so gifted and
You just sit and jam
I keep the business ran
You got it twisted fam
Go handle your business man

But it's no pressure I can take this boi
And if I don't win I'll break dis boi

Stop chattin shit just pass the pad, pass the pad, pass the pad
Hey no it's winner stays on blud pass the pad, pass the pad, pass the pad
Don't be a prick blud pass the pad, pass the pad, pass the pad
High talk and ghetto conspiracies
Psychotic weed dealers smokin trees
Heated arguments all about the football
We're up all night like we're nocturnal
I can't be bothered to do anything but chill
And fuck the world outside that's how I feel
I've got a whole lot of time to kill
So fuck these bitches I'm just keepin it real

Do It!,Boy in da Corner,2003.0,"Oh, it's real out here
Like no one understands sometimes
If people could see what's really going on
Like people are just, just going mad in front of me, you get me?
Everyone's growing up too fast, I swear
Feds don't understand us, adults don't understand us
No one understands us
We just live do what we do like, it's real
It's Raskit (Yo), shout out to all the mandem
Yo, I'm repping, I'm trying (Listen, yo)

Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep forever
I spend my whole life tryna pull myself together
Tryna reassure myself that I ain't going mad
I gotta come to a conclusion, it's now or never
Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep for years (Years)
I've been through anger, pain, blood, sweat and tears
You'd think that any kid in my position would be glad
Quite the opposite; more worries - more fears
Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep for days (Days)
It's like I've lost the love, I'm only in it 'cause it pays
I find myself back on road, things are getting bad
More and more I'm going back to my old ways
Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep for good
And if I had the guts to end it all, believe I would
It's getting boring always being miserable and sad
Shit, I would love to be polite, I really wish I could
But life's pressures often get me down
Sometimes I feel there's not a lot to smile about, so I frown
And I talk a big whole heap of badness
Because my life's a big whole heap of madness
I've seen a lot, maybe more than I can take (Real)
Under pressure everyday trying not to break
But I'll survive 'cause it's what I do best, get me?
I'm a challenger, put me to the test

Sleep tight, everything will be alright
By the end of the night will be the day, just pray that you see it (See it)
Strong you gotta be it, if you wanna get through it
Stretch your mind to the limit, you could do it
Sleep tight, everything will be alright (It's gonna be alright)
By the end of the night will be the day, just pray that you see it
Strong you gotta be it, if you wanna get through it (Don't watch no one)
Stretch your mind to the limit

It's almost like I've got the world on my shoulders sometimes
Yo, I struggle sometimes, you know I'm hating petty crimes
But we lived in hard times
No one to turn to and no one to talk to
Life's like a doorway, everybody walk through
Everybody's talking, but nobody's listening
Everyday some new shit, week out and week in
All this negativity, why they tryna get at me?
All up in my life, rah, where'd you get the energy?
I don't feel well, but you still bother me
You're giving me a headache man, you might as well just clobber me
Blud lately I've been lonely, but you only phone me
When you want a favour, then you wonder why I'm moany
Don't really ask much, so I don't owe much
Don't receive a lot of love, so I don't show much
But the little that I do I put it in this song for you
Handle your business 'cause I do, listen

Sleep tight, everything will be alright
By the end of the night will be the day, just pray that you see it
Strong you gotta be it, if you wanna get through it
Stretch your mind to the limit, you could do it
Sleep tight, everything will be alright
By the end of the night will be the day, just pray that you see it
Strong you gotta be it, if you wanna get through it
Stretch your mind to the limit, you could do it

Shout to all the youngas
E3, do your thing, but swear to use school
Get me, you come out of school, it's real out here

Wherever you want, man (Wherever the fuck you want)
Swear to fucking God, man

Liar liar, pants on fire, you're not gangsta, you're not street
You just make yourself sound gangsta when you're rappin on the beat
You ain't got yourself in no life-threatening situations yet
You're no dealer, you're not balling, you just get yourself in debt
You're a fan of hip-hop, wanking when you hear them rappers talk
Love to sit and listen, but we know that you don't walk the walk
What's with all the fake aggression? I can see that it's not true
I know killers, I know gangsters, and they never heard of you
You ain't robbed nobody, shanked nobody, you ain't bust no gun
You ain't seen no ghetto action, who do you think you foolin, son?
You should pull ya trousers up, you know it ain't your type of look
You're no playa, you're no pimp, I think that you should read a book
And seckle, find yourself a pretty girl and settle
You know that if it's on that you ain't drawing for no metal
I know them rap songs got you thinking you're some kind of G

Well it's big Bun B and I'm back again
Talking that shit on the track again
Too many motherfuckers be lying
About selling, buying and trafficking
I'm like really though what's happening
You boys talk about that crack again?
Cause we don't believe you, need more people
Y'all might as well just pack it in
Show me the paper you're stacking in
Show me the blocks you got on hold
Show me your workers, show me your shooters
Lemme see the neighborhood you control
Lemme see if you a boss, and if motherfuckers is scared of you
And if somebody trying to take your shit
Let me see what you prepared to do
Are you ready to go to war? Are you ready to shoot to kill?
Are you really gon' man-up or bitch-up? Just tell the truth for real
Are you ready to take a life?
Walk up to 'em and squeeze the trigger?
I don't think so 'cause you ain't built like that
So just be easy, nigga
'Cause you know you ain't 'bout no drama
And you know that you really don't want it

We don't play around no oh
We don't play around no oh
5am screaming louder than rock stars
We don't play around no oh
We don't play around no oh

I don't wanna tell you how to have a good time
I wanna show you how a good time looks like
Tell whoever's in your house don't wait up
We're gonna party and we're gonna do it all night
I got something in my pocket that'll blow your mind
I got something in a glass that'll free you up
So why you're standing there looking all stupid?
I'll bet you any money I could get you pop flop
I never wanna hear no half why excuses
All I wanna do is stand upto the music
Everybody's getting loose and this an exclusive
All the women over there they're looking intrusive
Pull your socks up a little, opposite of useless
Go and offer them a glass and a couple juices
Haters say they wanna roll y'all we can do this
If you wanna have a good time then approve it


We gon drink, hands high
When we in the club tonight
Hands up that's right
When we in the club tonight
Make no mistakes
When we go, we go hard

Now you're getting all hot, drop don't stop
Have you feeling like you're gonna pass her all up
Did you ever think that you could ever get this hot?
Everybody looking at you and they're all in shock
Cause you're getting jiggy with it all over the shot
But you never thought that I could make you drop on lock
But you never thought that I could make you want ambra
Skippy on the beat, shuffling your feet
I know you feel sweet
But you don't wanna hump it
You don't wanna clash, you're gonna damn rush
I'll pull up them MJ blues in a flash
And I'm fightin off a birthday rush
How you know I'm looking for the birthday lash?
Gonna get high on my birthday stash
I just wanna have a good time but guess what?

Make no mistakes

Focus,Raskit,2017.0,"Future
The future of your nation
The future of your world
The future of your existence
Will all be decided now
Will all be decided here
There will be no second chances
Know yourself

Trying to navigate through
Positivity I'm only trying to gravitate, to
Spit fire when I salivate, true
And if I fall from grace land flat on my face will it validate, you
Black man with an attitude, whats, new
Looking out for the boys in, blue
And the green eyed monster, too
Trust few, these fools wanna push my buttons get checked on a rebound, then sue
I've got other shit I've gotta, tend, to
On my backside like the rents, due
Never really knew what a pen, could, do
Pent up and my problems, grew
Put pen to the paper, then, blew
Can't rush me like I just, blew
Got jet lag like I just, flew
In a pent house with a nuts, view
(?) said you bussed, who
I weren't buskin on the bus or tube
Just another sus and dusty dude
I ain't giving fucks so just, move
I ain't in a rush I just, cruise
You're a dumb fuck and you're not (?)
You numbnuts had enough, clues
No patience wanna just, cut, cues
I'll do anything, but, snooze
No ex-cuse, or such Ruse
I'll do anything, but, lose
Dont get it con-fused

I ain't stush
Thats focus on my moosh
I don't need no kush I push and one in the hand's worth two in the bush
I ain't stush
Thats focus on my moosh
I dont need no kush I push and one in the hand's worth two in the bush

Im not needy
I got everything i want in the game so easy
Why be greedy, i know you see me
I never thought i'd see the end of the CD
I never thought i'd see social media replace the TV
I want a TV looking all steely, so they can't read me
Whats the point if i can't even be me
You won't see me in the green mankini sipping a bellini
But wouldn't it be dreamy if i had money like Chuck Feeney spending it freely
In Santorini
I dont drink martini
I'm not Martin Shkreli
But I'm a scheming meanie
Step on the scene blacked out in a beanie giving out orders like Mancini, routinely
Big man and im setting the scenery
Set up the place all set in my ways won't let up the G in me
Sincerely
Got to keep it G thats the theory
No really
These breddas aing G i can see it so clearly
I swear on everything that i hold dearly
I try and keep all my nearest and dearest all cheery
You better hear me
I pay my taxes up-front yearly
Im from the L-D-N where the sky is dreary
Ive lost count of the times that i let it endear me
And all the locals cheer me
Its all love but you won't see me getting all teary
Test me it will get very eerie

I ain't stush
Thats focus on my moosh
I dont need no kush I push and one in the hand's worth two in the bush
I ain't stush
Thats focus on my moosh
I dont need no kush I push and one in the hand's worth two in the bush

Money talks (It don't stop)
Dirty cash, I want you
Dirty cash, I need you, whoa-oh (Let's go)

Everybody wants to be famous
Nobody wants to be nameless, aimless
People act shameless tryna live like entertainers
Want a fat crib with the acres
So they spend money that they ain't made yet
Got a Benz on tik that they ain't paid yet
, spend their pay cheque
In the West End on the weekend
Got no money by the end of the weekend
But they don't care 'cause their life is a movie
Starring Louis V, paid for by yours truly
Truthfully, it's a joke, like a bad episode of 
Hollyoaks
Can't keep up with the cover notes
So they got bad credit livin' on direct debit
In debt but they still don't get it
'Cause they too busy livin' the high life, the night life
Huggin’ the highway, livin' large, and they all say

Money talks, mmm-hmm-hmm

Dirty cash, I want you
Dirty cash, I need you, whoa-oh

Dirty cash, I want you

Let me take you down to London city
Where the attitude's bad and the weather is shitty
Everybody's on a paper chase, it's one big rat race
Everybody's got a screw face
, so many two-face
Checkin' their high just like they're ready to ride
I’m on the inside looking at the outside
So it’s an accurate reflection
City wide, north, east, west and the south side
Everywhere I go there’s a goon on the corner
Guns and drugs got the city like a sauna
And it’s getting warmer
, and out of order
Tryna put a struggling mother to a mourner
Mr Politician, can you tell me the solution?
What’s the answer? What’s the conclusion?
Is it an illusion? Is it a mirage?
I see young'uns die because they're tryna live large, and they all say

I've no excuse
I just want you to use me (Woo)
Take me and abuse me
I got no taboos (I got none)
I'll make a trade with you

Do anything you want me to

Yo, we're living in the days of the credit crunch
Give me the dough, I'm trying to have a bunch
But I can't have raps for lunch, it’s not there ain’t enough to share
I never dreamed that it could be rare
Who cares who's there to make a change?
Everyone's in the club tryna to make it rain
But not for famine, just for the sake of having
15 minutes of fame and everywhere's the same
Again and again, I see the same thing
Everybody acting like they're plain sailing
But I see rough seas ahead, maybe a recession
And then a depression, in whatever profession
This is my confession, I can't front, I'm in the forefront
Livin' for money ready to start like a bungee jump
With no rope, but I ain't tryna see the bottom
Because that is where I came from, I ain't forgotten

Yo! I’m young, free, I’m running amok
And I just got paid so I'm really gonna live it up
I’m on that Superman flex
Tryna think about which part of the world I'm gonna holiday next
A lot of chilling and a whole lot of sex
I need a girl to keep my thingy erect
And I ain't silly cos I always keep my Jimmy protected
So I don’t ever worry bout getting infected
My only concern is that vibe stays jiggy
So you ain’t gotta worry bout spending no money if you’re ridin with me
I'll put it all on the card, the register's out of paper
And think about what it cost me later
I think that we should start in Jamaica
Or maybe Antigua, 
I know a couple spots in Ibiza
Everybody’s watchin me cuz I’m a over achiever
And I could really do with a breather
Girl give me one

Plus I got money to blow, that’s why I’m letting you know
All you really need is just the bare necessities
So pack em and I’m ready to go
So what you’re waitin for? I’m ready to roll
And I can tell that you're excited, you ain’t telling me no
I've got a friend with a boat so you we can float in the Caribbean Sea
Or we could drive by the coast, top down, catching the breeze
And now I wanna speed, I'm takin it easy
I want you to enjoy the scenery
We ain't in a hurry, don’t need to rush and scurry
Don’t even worry yourself, you look lovely
Enjoy the sun, you think this is fun

All these bottles, getting drunk up in here tonight
Even my money high, talking sky high
You want some, space god

Won’t there be no more bottles?

Can’t forget Mak 10 murderin’ them decks
He'd just drop the ting we didn’t even know what’s next
I was with Reggie, 
never even heard of Ghetts
What you know about them real south London vets?
Imperial Gardens I was way out of my depth
Brickie on the right, Pecknam on the left

All I see is shooters I don’t know about the rest
Can’t forget them ghetto boys servin’ up that stress
Bunch of blue borough boys turnin up La'Fez
Turnin’ up with heads
Someone’s gonna turn up dead, yeah

I was in the dance with no vest on my chest
Bredders lickin’ shots just to vent and express
Bredders lickin’ shots just to let me know I’m blessed

For the ends I rep, Instead I got respect
Coulda just been wet, didn’t know what to expect
Weren’t no speculation if they had the tings on deck
Thinkin’ what the heck
Might as well take heed
Take time and breathe
I ain’t tryna bleed
Love is all we need
Seems like they agreed
But you know know about peak unless you went Rumble Stampede
Real peak indeed
And if you’re lookin’ beef then I suggest you take the lead
And roll up your sleeves
Or get jooked with speed
I’ve seen the hardest, coldest bredders beg, holler and plead
Like you won’t believe
And North West is greaze
Hotter than Belize
I went to 
Tudor Rose
 thinkin’ it would be a breeze
But all I saw was G’s
Bredders on their knees
Screaming ""Why d’you take my boy away?
God help him, please!""

Do it how they didn't wanna do it, now they really wanna try to do that, but I'm telling them no
I'm in a predicament where imitators wanna take my style and have bit of my flow
This copy-catting of my lyrics and my chatting better stop before the gunshots blow
Do you really want it? 'Cos I really wanna give it, if you do just let me know
And I show, arrogance and elegance
But no, tolerance for nonsense
I bring, violence, I'm a nuisance
Kill a MC, leave no evidence -I've got brains and intelligence
But no conscience, no innocence
We roll in the darkened silence
We're presidents in any residence, and I swing for your chin with no hesitance
I'm a captain, you'd better bring your regiments
And you're a failure, don't have no relevance
I'm a champion, winner and victor
Prick you're so not ready, so silly, so heading for the golden gates
No, really you monkeys are playin' with apes
Now guerilla warfare is the purpose I carry this stick for
Plus I've had enough of these little cheap comments from fake MC's
, bad minders, and sket ladies
Talking about how it used to be? Well it's a brand new day so leave me be
I don't need you, so you don't need me, your opinion don't interest me
Don't like me? That's fine by me
'Cause from Holly Street to Hollywood, it's all good
From New York to York Hall, it's all cool
You're a fool if you think I'm gonna cease
Now honestly could there really be peace?
It don't seem that way, too tough
Stop with the games, I play too rough
You must be smoking too much puff, divert or be deceased
UK rapper stabbed in Napa, cause of gossip, cause of chatter
""He's still breathing, he's still a dapper""
Retaliate with gun clapper
Truthfully, I can't see very well
Don't flatter yourself, you're any girl
Them boys should've sent me to hell, now prepare for the beast

You people are gonna respect me if it kills you

Endless speculation I'm facin'
Constant controversial relations to gun crime at Garage events, with so many claims and no evidence
Suggesting I'm the reason for the U.K. gun-clap season
I'm legal, may I stress, for the fool, for the sake of
Trident intelligence
Go ahead, check my files all day
Bit of criminal damage and TDA, might be a little bit of violent disorder but I ain't never been locked away
Got a few mates that have been convicted
Yeah, so what? It's the hand life dealt them
We weren't blessed with the system's TLC
Government should've tried to help them
(Look, I've) been a law breaker, ain't tryna hide it
As for the sentence, ain't tryna ride it

But to the pricks who think I'm slackin', please dont ever be fooled, I'm packin'
This is a welcome and it's a warning, please don't ever just think I'm rapping
You know the score, I'm raw from day, still Dylan the villain from round the way
Feel free to quote anything I say, please don't ever just think I'm chattin'

But they don't understand that they don't got a chance
Cause I got other plans for us tonight
You got em falling like rain you break it down
Cause they never seen an arse like that
Ouch!
Arse like that
Ouch!
Arse like that

Your buff is done, your arse is retarded
A lot of junk in your trunk but far from garbage
You're a keeper, come and ride in my 2 seater
Late night creeper, I'm pleased to meet ya
Hate to see you go, love to see you leave
Figure I can't perceive
Wondering how you achieved such a beautiful body, I can't believe
So sorry I'm lost for words, I could hardly breathe
God give me strength, your bumper is a blessing
Jiggling it all over the shop, you ain't messing
I wanna get closer, suppose I'd better step in
You got the kind of body I won't be forgetting
Pleasing my senses, I ain't being pretentious
There's a lot of incentive why you're being defensive
I'm a bedroom bully, let me beat it up
Stop playin, girl let me heat it up, what's up?

 x2
Wind that bum bum, move that bum bum
Shake that bum bum, grind that bum bum
Let me smack it up, back it up
Let me smack it up, back it up

You got em falling like rain you break it down
You're like a heart attack yeah
No wonder no man around you can act sane
When you're moving like that
But they don't understand that they don't got a chance
Cause I got other plans for us tonight
You got em falling like rain you break it down

She Knows What She Wants,Raskit,2017.0,"She don't wanna play no games with me

Play her own way
She is not a ponce
Looking nonchalant
Looking confident I wanna be her confidant
With a big badonk-a-donk
The ba-donkas looking tonk
I'll give her the wonky bonk (oi!)
But not before I take her to a boujee restautant
Yeah a boujee restautant
With the fancy condiments
And get her what she wants
Coz she knows what she wants
She wants a fancy fella with the manners and the charm
She wants a fancy fella in the new designer garms
She wants a fancy fella that'll be boppin arm-in-arm
Be her knight in shining armour and she'll never come to harm
He'll get a private jet and take her shopping in Milan
Or fly her to Dubai and have her staying at The Palm
She wants a fancy fella who's a gentleman and calm but I'm not a fancy fella so I'll tell her wagwan

Got me shaggin' in the flat
She ain't lackin' in the back
Keeps the kitty cat intact
Yeah the kitty cats a rap
I can rap about her baps or
I can rap about the way she tries to hit me with the facts
Trying to hit me with the stacks
Trying to hit it then relax
Take a cheeky little nap
I'm a cheeky chap but if if ever cheat I'll get a slap
She wants a fancy fella who is loyal and is true
Who takes her out for strolls and can forget about the crew
She wants a fancy fella that her parents can approve
And can make a brave suggestion when she don't know what to do
She wants a fancy fella that'll treat her like a boo and not treat her like a bird coz she's had a cock or two
She wants a fancy fella that'll properly pursue but my name is Dizzee Rascal and I'm just passing through

Road Rage,Tongue n’ Cheek,2009.0,"What? Where you from? What?
Get out the fucking way you prick
Who you talking to?
What? Get out the fucking car then
Get out the car then
Fucking pussyole
Yeah, fuck you too
Your mum!

Beep beep, coming through
Move over, yeah, you
Don't argue, just blur
Hurry up or you're gonna get hurt
You don't wanna see road rage (nah)
You don't wanna see road rage (nah)
You don't wanna see road rage (move)
I'll put you in an early grave

TDA, TDA
I'll break in your car then I'll take it away
That's how I used to roll, back in the day
I only did it for a laugh, I didn't even get paid
And I couldn't give a shit about a junction
Couldn't care less about a red light's function
Drive sort of like I'm drunk, I'm swerving, swerving
Got two wheels and the car been mervin
On the tarmac, fall back
On my stereo, full blast,
 2Pac
Holla if you hear me cause I'm only gonna be bouncer
Knock down all of these, let down all of these
Run down all of these chumps
Drive faster when I see speed bumps
Good enough stance?
I'm a smart guy, but if you see me drive you'll think I'm a God's like

Beep beep, coming through
Move over, yeah, you

I'll put you in an early grave

Neeyow, mind out
If you don't listen to me you'll find out
I don't indicate, I just swing about
Taking up two lanes, playing dare devil games
I don't give a shit cause my car is tinted
And If I get caught, I don't care, I'm minted!
Driving in the fast lane, ready for the violence
Had six points before I even had the licence
Now I'm legit and I couldn't give a rat's arse
All I see is flashlights cause I drive too fast
But I'm still a trooper, in my Mini Cooper
Went head to head, had a crash with a police car
Didn't get arrested, didn't have to kick off
I was alright but their car got writ' off
Just another day in the life of a lunatic
Rub me up the wrong way and you'll see me start losing it

Beep beep, coming through
Move over, yeah, you
Don't argue, just blur
Hurry up or you're gonna get hurt
You don't wanna see road rage (nah)
You don't wanna see road rage (nah)
You don't wanna see road rage (move)
I'll put you in an early grave

Move, when you see me coming down the road
Mind out, when you see me coming down the road
Couldn't give a shit when I'm driving down the road
This is a warning, you've been told
Like, neeyow, move over, neeyow, move over
Neeyow, move over, neeyow, move over
Travel with my lights in the day time
Everybody looking at me crazy - what?
I put my middle finger in the sky, I'm fucked
If I see flashing lights I just might not stop
Let's go for a joy ride, speed through the ghetto
I say ""good bye"" before I even say ""hello""
I'm far from mellow, I don't want a chat
I get out my car and I give you a slap
Never mind all that cause you really ain't ready though
I'm so high I just want to hear my stereo
But I got my girl moaning in my left ear
There's a lot of stress so you better steer clear
Car just cut me up, I didn't take kindly
Plus I got this other silly bastard behind me
Had another beer, got to keep yourse'n smiley
Blimey, now I got to get grimey like...

Everywhere,Showtime,2004.0,"I ain't on a hype ting
Just out here trying to do the right thing
And even though you know I don't mind fighting
When I will, it's cash money like lightning
You know I (gotta get that dough) I ain't ramping
(Gotta get that dough) damn right
(Gotta get that dough) I ain't ramping
(Gotta get that dough) straight up

Hot taste, charisma, stylie, we got plenty
Cruising in the Punto on the way to Bentley
Evidently far from gently eating up the roll
We act immaturely in a hurry to be old
In fact we'll leave you poorly, catch a beating like a cold
Go ahead profile and flex like you're big, bad and bold
Go ahead go round your next to get hit, had and showed
Stay out the paper chase, floppy fellas fold
Neglect the rules, respect the codes, follow the guide lines
Life's been ugly so far but these are fine times
I write below the belt, I bust average fine rhymes
I always had to be a star, my city saw the signs
I try not to be stupid with my fame
But constantly I sense fassies being clever with my name
Indirectly call my name like they're calling my bluff
So sadly I often sense the need to get rough

I'm here, there, I'm everywhere, I can't be seen
I'm all over, ya nahmean?
I'm here, there, I'm everywhere, I can't be seen
It's all over, ya nahmean?
I'm here, there, I'm everywhere, I can't be seen
I'm all over, ya nahmean?
I'm here, there, I'm everywhere, I can't be seen
So move over, ya nahmean?

Full of strife, that's life, deal with how bad it is
Reminisce, reflect, revise on how bad it could have been
Abuse time and find out how mad it is
Time waits for nobody, handle your biz
Extortionists would love to man-handle this
I'm ignorant, refuse to understand what extortion is
Jack me and get what? Jack me and get where?
Get zilch times zero, times nothing plus air
Yeah, I'm way beyond care
Hate me or love me, try not to stare
Your thoughts and your opinions try not to share
I show interest on an occasion that is rare
Plus I ain't in the hype, I'm above it and I cause it
Can't put a stop to the track but I can pause it
So play your role, act tough, put on your show
I'll let the ratchet be your audience, bullets will applaud it


My name is Dizzee Dizz, I handle my biz
My spreaders talking gangsta, don't know what a gangsta is
They ain't ready yet, I don't claim a set
But if you test I'll leave you with something you will regret
I'm 5'10"", slim, chocolate skin
I'll punch you in your nostrils, I'll punch you in your chin
But I ain't mad, I'm a lovely lad
I'll give you the loveliest beating that you've ever had
Rude boy, home boy better chill
You know I don't watch no face cause I'm real
I don't care if you're sick, I don't care if you're ill
My foot will add a nice frill to your ice-grill
Son dun-duddy, I don't find shit funny
If you ever try and go against the flow of my money
Word is bond, what's really good, I'm really hood
Take this song as a caution, you really should


Try copy we
Hit her with the G, condo energy
Lyrical tank, lyrical pedigree
Bastard or wee on girl Emily
How bad they wanna try copy we?
Hit them with the G, condo energy
Lyrical tank, lyrical pedigree

Spend Some Money,The Fifth ,2013.0,"I'm just tryin to spend some money
These cops tryin to take it from me
(Give me that, give me that, give me that)
I'm just tryin to spend some money
(Come on, come on, come on)
These girls tryin' to take it from me
I'm up in the club with them, I'm just like what's up
Getting bottles with my niggas like we don't give a fuck
I'm just in the club, with the bottles like what's up
Spending all my fucking money like we don't give a fuck

Hot boy, chillin on South Beach
I got a pocket full of money and I don't speak
I let the money do the chit chat, all I do is kick back
In fact everything's intact
So I'm living it large, life large and in charge
I go hard, no time to recharge
I don't stop, I just come forth
All I see is pretty women and a lot of bottles on the rocks
I've got the premises on lock
Under the middle with a flush, actin out like I'm out
I get the party started, or so I'm told
And I feel top notch, I got the top spot
So let the bass drop, and let the drums kick
Get before a man to boost and then bump it
All the bottles are empty cause we drunk it
And I'm wasted, mission accomplished


Yea yea
Move ho, I'll be in the club, stop picking them leaves
Young niggas both sides of me, lookin like Cluedo
Bitch this is Audemars, not a Hublot
If these niggas a beat then we sumos
This the new Eubank and Frank Bruno
White girls getting pregnant like Juno
Private jet so let me go Pluto
Yeah it's a grand whole life, freakin cinematic
I'm in the SLS, fuck it if I'm in the traffic
Great stone then I lay with those 20 ratchets
Black rock star, bitches call me Lenny Kravitz

I'm just tryin to spend some money
These cops tryin to take it from me
(Give me that, give me that, give me that)
I'm just tryin to spend some money
(Come on, come on, come on)
These girls tryin' to take it from me
I'm up in the club with them, I'm just like what's up
Getting bottles with my niggas like we don't give a fuck
I'm just in the club, with the bottles like what's up
Spending all my fucking money like we don't' give a fuck

Grey Goose in my tummy
I'm tryin to do the doggy but it just looks funny
Still I look like money, dress to impress
Looking for some double D, breast in a low pot dress
And then I put that body to the test
North to south east, to west I progress, I'm the best
I know I ain't settling for less
She knows what I want, she ain't gotta second guess
Took her to the hotel, she was with her home girl
Had to get rid of your girl like oh well
Baby it's a cold world, get in the jacuzzi
Smoke some of this and get woozy
Think her name was Jane but it could've been Julie
Really don't matter cause I still let her do me
Really a truly, it was all that
I paid for the rat ta ta ta ta, from the back now

I'm just tryin to spend some money
These cops tryin to take it from me
(Give me that, give me that, give me that)
I'm just tryin to spend some money

They wanna sheg it, copy and edit (ugh)
Pull out the suttin and watch them leg it

How come everything is so generic?
Why I can't pay with stacks and I gotta use direct debit?

That I've been on form since I was a spawn, before I was born
Brains and brawn, I'm sharp like a thorn
Dusk till dawn I lay on my own lawn
Yawn Fool I like to stay warm
I stay cool when caught in a storm
Never out worn, I just out-perform
You've been warned, don't get ripped apart and get torn
I've been touring and I’ve been mourning all through the morning
RIP to Stomin, that’s Shaun
Paigons try and play me like a pawn
I could start pawnin' all of this jewellery, and build a school
And there'll still be scorned
They're too normal, I'm not the norm'
They're too pussy, I'm not the porn
Why's your pussy smell like a prawn? (Oi)
I've been thinking 'bout taking a uni course
You might see me coolin’ the dorm
Might get a law degree and get sworn (Why)

Wanna Be,Maths + English,2007.0,"So you wanna be a gangster?
Tell me just one thing
What you know about being a hard-man?
Your mum buys your bling
Your pockets getting bigger but you couldn't pull the trigger if you need to
Cause you haven't got it
So you might as well quit

I'm moving, couldn't be losing
Nothing but a success thing, I'm proving
Nothing to you half-heart wasters
Standing there yap-yap-yapping on cruising
Nobody dictates, I'm choosing
Where I go, what I do with my life, stupid
And I hold my own, I'm Raskit
You better watch your tone, you spastic
'low it, you're not heartless
Nothing but a lot of hot air, you're harmless
I keep getting my paper regardless
Your words don't faze me, I'm marvelous
Age 22, zero tolerance
And I ain't got no time for the nonsense
You wanna see me, come to my concerts
And we can do it on stage with a audience


Beef, stripes, guts, glory
All these hype bredders in the club bore me
I wish when I'd come through they'd ignore me
I really can't deal with another war story
Bredders in my face with a fist full of paper
Trying to make out they're a big money maker
Talking all loud (Better know man a hustler)
I ain't got time, rudeboy, see you later
And I can't forget these groupies following
Fronting, raving, ranting, hollering
Yeah, I know I shouldn't be complaining
But these Jezebels do my brain in

That chain don't make you a big man (Nah mate)
I know you think you're a big man (What mate?)
But really you're just a waste, man ('low it)

Yo, let me wrap it up while I've still got time
Ain't nobody telling about no Grime
Cause I know where I stand with it, I'm fine
Handle your biz, I'm handling mine
Everybody chatting 'bout black-on-black crime
All I see is the blind leading the blind
I wanna leave all the pettiness behind
You don't really want to see me cross that line
Leave me alone or you'll be sorry
Beef ain't nothing new to me, you wally
Why don't you just kick back, be jolly
Stay at home with a cup of tea, watch Corrie
I'm not listening anyway, man
Who rattled your cage anyway, man
Ain't no slacking with this young man

Tell them boys there ain’t no discussion
Tell them boys I heard it all before
It ain’t new to me you gotta show me suttin’
Act up fore I blow or suttin’
Blow for blow
Toe to toe
I run my own show
But I am not known for duckin’
Tell my homeboys to roll me suttin’
Standin’ out in the cold is cuttin’
Reminiscing on back in the day before Isle of Dogs and E3 was shootin’ broad day and riskin’ lives over nothin’
Them boys were like older cousins
Went away I came back I heard it went mad but I could not speak cos it was too peak I had to just hold my tongue in
Shoulder shruggin’
Lookin’ over my shoulder
Told ‘em slow your roll when the roads are gunnin’
On top and the show was runnin’
These times it was over-numbin’
All's fair when it's love and war
Bredders actin’ all cold an' cunnin’
I was focussed on my dough was comin’
Deep down I knew my soul was bunnin’
Sting a bee in a sling they stung him
Couple shots came through went wrong
Held one, he survived the stunnin’
Payback gotta at least gotta get one in
No point tryna talk ‘em down
Can’t tell these negros nuttin’

Slow your roll and get dough
Slow your roll and get dough

Slow your roll and get dough
Slow your roll and get dough

Youngers takin’ up arms
Youngers out to do harm
Like it’s Afghanistan
Switchin' up garms
Kickin’ up drama
Gotta handle these qualms
Chip at the top of their arm
Someone ring the alarm
Ringin’ shots on the calm
Nothin' left in their eyes
Lost the love and the charm
Ain’t no Quran
And they’re mentally scarred
They ain’t wishin’ on stars
They ain’t readin’ no psalms
Or prayin for peeps, they’re playin’ for keeps
Futures bleak
They keep the heat in their palms
Compete and beef for postcodes and streets they don’t even own yards
Best believe they go hard
So bredders got locked up
Cos there ain’t no pot luck
The developers rocked up
Settin’ up shop got the whole place locked and it all went and it all got copped and the hood got chopped and the natives cropped and the ends got boxed up, then the price got knocked up
Foreign investment raising the stock up
So the rent got propped up
And it kept gettin’ topped up
So the heart got ripped out and rinsed out
Some got shipped out, got kicked out
Few of them stayed but the rest just dipped out
Took the quick route
Power, money and big clout is what it’s about

Slow your roll and get dough
Slow your roll and get dough
Slow your roll and get dough
There’s more to life than you know
Slow your roll and get dough
Slow your roll and get dough
Slow your roll and get dough

I've heard their talk, that Dizzee Rascal's so rude
People talking don't even know me
I do what I want, you get me? (And ask no one for nothing, you get me?)
I ain't everyone's friend
Okay, I don't wanna get vexed
That's why I'm just trying to keep my cool, you get me?
I don't want to lose it, I can't believe I got people chattin' shit
Left, front, and centre (It's not a bad day)
I'll never watch what I say
I say what the fuck I want, I don't care who you are (Nah man)
I don't care who I offend or nothing
I won't be silenced
Listen, look

I'm showing you my life's more deep than you think (Uh-huh)
At nights, I get a little less sleep than you think (Really?)
Something keeps me up, I can't even get a wink (Huh)
And there's no point in trying, so I lay there and blink
I'm showing you, I feel more stressed than you see (Yeah)
But my business is my business and I keep it all to me
I've done a lot of work for you to see me where I be
But lately I sense you don't want to set me free
And lately, there's been controversy seen around my name (Okay)
But fuck you cause I ain't playing your game (Naw)
My attitude, my language - they ain't used to it (Okay)
But I ain't UK garage so (Get me) get used to it
'Cause I was raised an only child, not a brother, not a sis
And raised around hate, not a hug, not a kiss (Naw)
Before this I was just a failure in the mist
And I made it through the front, I can't let you take a piss, so

I don't wanna get vexed (Vexed)
And I don't wanna lose my cool (Cool)
But I ain't gonna let that boy come around, try take me for no fool (Fool)
I ain't gonna let that boy come around, I'm reaching for my tool (Tool)

I'll probably have him thinking I'm fake, I'll make his family sad

I do the fuck what I want, that's how I got here
And I'll be damned if I let you fussies interfere
And if I had my way, you wouldn't even get near
I don't need your help, do I make myself clear?
I know it sounds rude, that's because it's meant to be (Okay)
I plan to be the rudest boy in this industry (Okay)
Ain't two-faced, and I ain't known to gloat (Okay)
If I don't like you, then I'll tell you to your throat
I don't know what you want, I don't know what you expect
But if I don't know you, don't ask me for respect
I don't give it easily, I don't give it much
And I ain't got a heart, so don't ever try and touch
All these pigs runnin' 'round like I owe them (Okay)
Before I got big, I didn't even know them (Okay)
I'll be doing this for a whole lot a' years (Okay)
And I'll be standing tall and straight when the smoke clears
So

I don't wanna get vexed (Vexed)

But I ain't gonna let that boy come around, try take me for no fool (Fool)
I ain't gonna let that boy come around, I'm reaching for my tool (Tool)
I ain't gonna let that boy get flash, I'll smash his head on the wall

I ain't gonna let that boy come around and run his gums you're mad (You're mad)
I'll probably have him thinking I'm fake, I'll make his family sad

Yo
I'm the type of boy that takes the bump with the grind (Okay)
And I'm the type of boy to take your girl from behind (Okay)
I'm the type of boy your girl wants me to be (She told me)
So don't act a prick, 'cause it don't suit me (Okay)
You could bore me up and you can even shoot me (Okay)
But if your girl's lettin' off, then it's my duty (Okay)
I ain't trying to keep your wifey, truthfully (Okay)
But it ain't my fault your girlfriend's a groupie
Be careful what you ask for, you could change your mind (Okay)
And what you're looking for, you won't like what you find (Okay)
If you're looking for the gossip, if you're looking for the chat
I'll remind you that curiosity killed the cat (Okay)
Plus
Girls are telling lies, and they spreading like the plague (Okay)
What else can I do except keep myself made (Okay)
I don't know why these girls are trying to attack me, (Okay)
But I'm a rude boy, I won't let nobody trap me, so

I don't wanna get vexed (Vexed)
And I don't wanna lose my cool (Cool)
But I ain't gonna let that boy come around, try take me for no fool (Fool)
I ain't gonna let that boy come around, I'm reaching for my tool (Tool)
I ain't gonna let that boy get flash, I'll smash his head on the wall
So, I don't wanna get vexed (Vexed)

Patterning Vibez,Don’t Gas Me - EP,2018.0,"Yo I woke up this morning
I had a little stretch, had a little yawn
Looked up (lovely), I see the sun shining, I could hear the birds tweeting (tweet, tweet, tweet), and I thought yo, I’m gonna make this day count rude boy
Chorus
Catching a vibe, out here patterning vibes
Catching a vibe, out here patterning vibes
Catching a vibe, out here patterning vibes
Catching a vibe
Verse 1
Woke up and I felt all vibey
Woke up and I felt all lively
Woke up I was like cor blimey
Got a whole lotta vibe inside me
My nuts were a little bit grimy
My guts were a little bit slimy
Washed up and made myself tidy
Now I’m spick and I’m span and I’m shiny
Then I said Jesus lord please guide me
Don’t let these pussyholes try me
Don’t wanna see me get fiery
But I know that you won’t deny me
Let me know everything is irie
He said dun know that I’m your guy G
I said amen and thank you kindly
Then I hopped in the whip all smiley
Chorus
Catching a vibe, out here patterning vibes
Might get ghost for the weekend grab one yattie and go for a ride
Catching a vibe, I’m so happy inside
I don’t know about them man there but I’m so gassed I’m alive

Now that I’ve caught this I ain't gonna let go until the whole nights through, coz I’ve been waiting for so long to catch a vibe with you yeah, so if you wanna catch my wave, maybe you will come my way, yeah yeah
Verse 2
Creeper, and I feel like a right proper geezer
Hold on let me get a little deeper
Let me tell you how my day gets sweeter

Got a ting I just poke I don’t tweet her
Roll up to the spot then I beep her
Roll up to the spot on time like the reeper
Open the door and I greet her
I say waguan my senorita
You look like a right little keeper
Wanna get you a berry then feed ya
Better buckle up tight coz I need ya
Like your birthday the way I’m gonna treat ya
Got a whole lot of bass in my speaker
And your probably with a rassclart overachiever

Dummy (16 for the Juice),Raskit,2017.0,"Doing it for the family
It don't really matter if you say you're not a fan of me
Telling me that you're miffed they're having trouble understanding me
Telling me that I'm this and that I'm questioning my sanity
Wondering why my attitudes so shabby, it's a tragedy
Wonder why I always use profanity, randomly
Telling me there ain't no need for me to be so angry
I should be a happy chap and put my feet upon a canopy
Can it be I'm just another rapper with an attitude?
Telling me that I need to settle down and show some gratitude
Telling me that I ain't the only rapper on the map that's from the manor
Matter of fact there's been a couple that it's happened to
And they've made a stack or two
Now I've got to battle through
And I'm lacking manners when I'm saying a should grab a few
I ain't got no worries I ain't even in a hurry
If I thought I couldn't do it I would pick another avenue
Haven't you heard it's not a sprint its a marathon
Every now and then you've got to let a bredda tag along
Used to wear it like a badge of honour now I think about tomorrow am I gonna and I gotta sing a sadder song
Looking in the mirror all I see is the dapper don
Telling me that I need to leave the leeches and the hangers on
Devil is a liar and it's got me running through the fire on my 22 inch tyres so I'm cracking on

I'm doin' it, I'm doin' it
I ain't preein' or pursuing it
Two two man are slewing it
Don't watch me who are you in it
I'm don it I'm doing it
Won't let them pussy boys ruin it
They say I love what I do with it
But what's love got got to do with it?

Money, money, money
Got these breddas acting up, I got these bitches being funny
Money, money, money
Got these breddas acting up, I got these bitches being funny
Money, money, money
Got these breddas acting up, I got these bitches being funny
I ain't being funny
I would be another dummy if it wasn't for the money

Doing it for the legacy
Been had the flavour look at everybody eating off my recipe
'Cause they know my style is a necessity
Now it's getting messy, it's unnecessary that I hang around
I think that people should see less of me
I ain't saying that I'm ready to accept a lesser fee
I'm talking bout a hysterectomy
I've been birthing all these little breddas and I must admit I got to quit before I split, it's over-stretching me
Put the pride aside
They told me that's a better vibe when it is applied
But I can't decide
The enemy can only conquer what he can divide
You can deny it if you want they'll have you looking like a plonker if you let it slide
You take 'em for a ride run and hide
And I consider myself a monster (?) in addition, and the consequences, I'll survive
I'll never take a dive
So here's a high five
And you'll be on your way
And have a great day
What can I say that would be great and make my day I would appreciate if you just go astray and stay away ok
Or you can blaze a J
You'll never see the day that Dizzee Rascal fade away
I'll always have another clever play on the way clear as day never grey
I will never sway
Everybody want a piece of the fillet till they gotta pay

I'm doin' it, I'm doin' it
I ain't preein' or pursuing it
Two two man are slewing it
Don't watch me who are you in it
I'm don it I'm doing it
Won't let them pussy boys ruin it
They say I love what I do with it
But what's love got got to do with it?

Money, money, money
Got these breddas acting up, I got these bitches being funny
Money, money, money
Got these breddas acting up, I got these bitches being funny
Money, money, money
Got these breddas acting up, I got these bitches being funny
I ain't being funny
I would be another dummy if it wasn't for the money

Money, money, money
Got these breddas 
acting up

Creeper (Freestyle),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yo, I, roll deep on these
Put these emcees on deep freeze
Hit these, whip these and rip these
Come like Busta, we flip these
Please, don't ramp with these
Fearless, angry, sick emcees
Don't like Kristy's or Britney's
Lala's or Tinky Winky's
This one's strictly for pickneys
Old school Afros, dry white knees
Barclays, Halifax, we stick these
Endless gunshots, we lick these
Trick these, CID's with ease
Touch mic, emcees jump like fleas
Player haters get chopped like trees
Avoid Rascal to avoid injuries

And I hit 'em like a lightning bolt
Five thousand volt, it's your own fault
Stand still, I'll put your whole crew to a halt
Cover emcees like pepper and salt
Gunman bullets go right through your coat
Nine milli, take Billy for a billy goat
Lay low, roll deep on a river boat
Cuttin' edge, Dizzee Rascal, cut throat

Rewind a wind-re, late to the sound
This soundboy's straight to the front line
Fuck her to the left, right, front or behind
Never nice, gotta be cruel to be kind
Dry lips sippin' on a dry white wine
Feel funny, take a draw of this, feel fine
Husband, I'll make your wifey be mine
Get pussy, get poom, get feline

Lyrical staff
Never could they ever take me for a chav
Scholar in the English, scholar in the Math
Dizzee ain't no riff raff
Hit 'em with the rise
Move, kick, uppercut, jab
Don't make me lose my rag
I'm a troublesome lad
Barefoot Shaolin lad
Lyrically far from swag
And I'm far from clean, I'll
Play kiss chase with your aunt Maureen
Get rhymes, get heard, get seen
Dizzee run tings like Idi Amin
Keep vigilant, keep on guard
We chuck grenades at Scotland Yard
Retard, get kicked hard, real hard
Leave death threats in your birthday card

Weights in the gym
Glass full of Alizé, right to the brim
Roll deep, so deep, they can't swim
Doin' it for Keisha, doin' it for Kim
He wants arms out, he wants to swing
If you try a ting, get a punch in the chin
Rascal is here, you better start worryin'
Get a hidin', beatin', turfin'
Didn't wanna care, so
Left that boy in the gutter somewhere
When I talk live-o, when I talk rare
I'll make you wish you were born elsewhere
I've gotta wash that girl out my hair
She's old news, everyone's been there
No we're not equal, no we're not fair
That girl's anything, she gets air

Take time pussy yout
Samurai, separate legs from feet
Twenty two inch blade, nothin' ain't sweet
Leave an emcee on the floor in the street
And that boy can't compete
Dizzee don't play fair, Dizzee might cheat
Draw for your handgun, draw for your heat
Dizzee boy, make a big boy look petite
Sex, play, then work
Girls say Dizzee Rascal is a jerk
Do it for the Bentley, do it for the Merc
Wanna make cash money like Young Turk
And that boy got hurt
Never knew that his girlfriend was a flirt
Sex in the alleyway, sex in the dirt
Sent her home in a black torn up skirt",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-creeper-freestyle-lyrics

All I do is grind hard get p and I spend, and it ain't never gonna end

Sharper than a dagger
Bigger and I’m badder stand tall I don’t need a bloody ladder why they try’na act like I don’t matter why I gotta be the topic of your bloody chitter chatter why they talk about my profit like I had it on a platter why they talking like I never was a jacker, I was just another (what you sayin)
Young rapper try’na pattern up a strategy, a little bit of patter I ain't looking for a pat on the back
I want a pat and a stack, I pay a whole lot of tax and if they knew what I was stacking they would have a panic attack (woah)
You’re a small fry Imma family pack
I’m try’na stack into the sky and keep the family fat
And that’s that as a matter of fact I move like I’ve got a battery pack
And I do not lack miss me with the yackety yack
You’ll have me with your favourite rapper and I shat on the track
And you was looking for your yattie she was sat on my lap

This long clip seesaw is big enough to floss ?with the sword? (wow)
I don’t know why they wanted a war I ball out with hooligans on scrappin at home and abroard you weren’t there you was home with your broad
Tell 'em when I'm cheffin' this beef I ain't messin' Gordon Rams' couldn’t handle the sauce
Big boy sets surrounded by 20 dead MC’s feelin' like I'm trapped in a morgue turn man into a corpse, bury man alive with the Fantastic Four what you expect when you man gas up a torch (go on!)
?Sets? on my arm mic in my left blade in my right never ever have my back to the doors Luke Skywalks when I cut a man with force you don’t want me battling
Batterin, when I grab a snake and rattle it
Firing so many shells for the top the ground looks like a gravel pit wanna see what I've got 'til I unravel it
Look how they stutter and babblin'
You went on backing it when it gets messy then don’t tackle it
Take whose chain I bought you ain't having it
Never caught that line but claim you're trap innit for all it's not that innit, you ain't got the belly you're chattin' it
If I left the money your grabbin' it
Skateboard MC you’ve been on the grind for years without stacking it every year attacking it that’s why I'm busy

I never say anything at all

Big bag of that veggie
Two zoots and the bevvy
Got me calm focused and ready

Buff ting called shelly
Pretty, perky and leggy
And she knows the crew already
Its about to get sweaty
Neck game so tekkie
Took the nut and didn't spit it out
All them other girls are so petty trust
Everything is golden
Shout out to Hulk Hogan
You know your still my brother
And my door is always open
Reputation is broken
What you said was potent
Got me wishing and hoping
I'll be more than just your token
I was rolling round roman
Everything was stolen
My boy was shootin' that brown and white and it was highly crack in his colon
No homo strolling
Feinds asking who's holding
Fake face no joking
Smokin' bolder in the open like

Just like I'm supposed to
Even if i weren't supposed to play they still put my name on the poster
Pop tarts in the toaster
On my old dear's sofa
Trying to figure out combos on street fighter for the ultra
Had a girl from Malta
I would squeeze and grope her
Used to make my toes curl but never made it to the altar and its kosher
Love and blessed vibes, spread them blessings far and wide 'cause I'm a blessed guy
And i can testify
I confess my my testosterone levels extra high
Plus I'm extra fly
Lyrical exercise
Got them petrified
Still running my enterprise
I don't ramp and i don't play no need to emphasise
There whining about how shitty there life is in the crisis but I'm decisive
No I don't emphasise

Yo! Look!

Dylan's on a hype now
I see he's doin' quite alright
I see his video the other night
How did he get a record deal
Chattin' like he's super-real
I see you on roman road market on saturday
You got battered 
Stabbin' in napa
What's the word on the street
Did he really slap her?
Is true that Wiley skipped the country left him?
Did he punch Mega in the face for tryin to test him?
I know he won a mercury award and brought it back to the estate
I know some breddahs in the manor hate an frequently debate
The way he makes moves
How he's steppin is he reppin
Cause they know he goes to Hackney
And they wonder what he's gettin
Plus I know he had that (
well street yat
)
The other day I see him leavin' Natalie's flat
He used to work dat south girl
Da mouthy one
What's his name's cousin
Still I know a couple girls are on it
I could name a dozen
But he ain't no player
Hes jus gettin' all the gash
Cause now they know he's got a little
Cash and a stash
That will keep him looking' pretty for the future in a flash
But little do they know he's only looking' for the lash
Cause Dylan's on a hype now!
Got his face on his t-shirt name on his trainers the iiidiot
He got a new era cap wit his logo
My bredrin's saw him tryin' on tracksuits in soho
I'm buyin' jackets from Benenni in LA
I heard he went to broadway
Limo driven through Queens
Is he livin' out his dreams is he ballin' - be truthful
Cause he ain't sittin' on the wall like he used to
He was on a thug tip at one point
He used to peel on bow road an take the foes (?) to Bethal Green
Next thing I hear him on the pirate radio scene
He used to do Deja, Ritz, and even Flava
Bought records off target and mixed for Adar (adar?)
Then worked his way to A list
It's funny cause the olduns used to dismiss
They never for a second anticipated this
No guts - no glory
Dylan took a risk took the piss now
Fellers wanna ask nigga if I reminisce on ..
Days when Dylan weren't all so criss
Still (crystal), they know Dylan put the game in a twist and
Dylan's on a hype now!
Worldwide interviews and business trips
Invitations to premieres and new flicks
And all the chicks got his name on their lips
A couple gunman kinda got him on the brain
And also the coppers wanna put him on frame
They're constantly watchin' so he better maintain
But he's getting' major money so he can't complain!

Too many man talk nuff blah blah

Yo, look...

I come direct and I inject
And I'm expecting your respect
I'm a baller, you've been checked
I'm the kinda kid you can't detect on the road
You know out and about
I'll put my elbow in your mouth
You're a fassy, there's no doubt
I bet my sword will make you shout
I'm intense you best see sense
I'll have you hanging from a fence
Then laugh at your expense
And maybe chuck you fifty pence
Snitch you make me switch
You sound and look just like a bitch
Whether you're poor, or whether you're rich
I'll leave you lying in a ditch
'cos I'm from ragged raggo rags
You 'ain't raggo rags like me
I'll behave when I emcee
Ragged raggo raggedly
We easily be the worst
Bust academics first
Batty crew emcee's get academically reversed
I'm academically perverse
I'm academically perverted
Batty crew emcee's get academically diverted
Some return, we clearly get burnt get hurt

You don't want the beef
You don't want the grime

Come to the manor get killed

Raised in the gutter I was told I should fight
I create and cause confusion from the left to the right
I'm sweet as a nut, I'm doing alright, cosy and comfortable
'stead of trying to avoid the sergeant, PC, and the constable
Raised in the gutter I was told I should pop
I create and cause confusion from the bottom to the top
I'm doing okay, I'll honestly say this year I'm flying through
I could easily find myself in jail but I 'ain't trying to
I keep it clear and frank
Relax with the pressure
I'm dirty and I'm stank
But 'ain't nobody fresher
My haters make enquiries, make it obvious they care
When it comes to my location they would love to be aware
But I could be in the manor, could be overseas
Could well be definitely making P's
Could be live at Wembley warming up for Jay Z's
Still I'm definitely certain that you can't see me...",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-learn-lyrics

Got my spider sense tinglin’
I’m just out here minglin’
All I see is politicians runnin’ round tryna keep their pockets jinglin’
Sounds like I’m singlin’
Can’t forget about the back scamps and the swindlin’
No point in lingerin’
Everybody’s gotta eat
Somebody’s gonna cheat

Kids are tryna be street
It’s peak
Get swept off of their feet before them condos are complete

Jumpin' round like orangutans on the table
With their sparklers
And their champagne all publicised
Why you always gotta sumarise
Why can’t you just live life in the moment?
And act like this glamour life ain't just a bunch o lies?
But I’m wide awake I can’t fake no more
Wide awake I can’t take no more
It was fun while it lasted
But it’s the kind of shit I can’t rate no more
Kind of shit you get carried away and start movin’ lose
And get posted up on your Instagram and fans hate you for
Cos the excess just vexes
The world’s more complex than being first name on the guest list

Named Lexus I’m restless

Dirtee Stank
Life's too short to be livin' with stress
I'm too young to be all depressed
I can't complain, I'm highly blessed
And there's one thing that I want to get off my chest
I'm free as a bird, I'm high as a kite
I could do what I want, and I'm doing alright
That's why I just might celebrate tonight
And if you ain't down with it, then get on your bike
To sank elsewhere, who the hell cares
I'm in great shape, you need health care
If you can't say something nice, then keep quiet
Or come to the club, there's girls there
I'm goin' to rave 'til six in the mornin'
I can already hear the bassline callin'
Just make up your mind, stop stallin'
And don't be half assed, 'cause I'm all in
So if your wallet ain't fat, don't worry about it
Your car don't work, we can go without it
We don't need wheels, just the will to party
I'll take you there, don't doubt it

'Cause the middle of the dance floor's cool with me
I wanna shock tonight
I wanna rock tonight
Come love, let me be the robot tonight
So many damn girls lookin' hot tonight
So before I leave here, I wanna cop tonight
So I can't just stand up against the wall
Try'na play it cool, feelin' like a fool
Like I'm scared to dance, 'cause I ain't scared at all
So there's no point lookin' all miserable
So I've got a big grin on my face
And my hands on a pretty girl's waist
Beer budget and champagne taste
But I feel like I'm running this place

Show the world you can shine (that's right!)

I wouldn't be nowhere else if I could
I don't ever wanna go home, let's stay
Party all night and party all day
What do you say? Tell me you're on it
Drink 'til we can't stand up, then vomit
Quicker than a comet, I feel like a star
Everyone waves, they know who we are
So much love, so much dread
Tell me you don't feel like a tomboy
In fact don't tell me nothing, just skank
'Cause I got a shawty and shizz in the bank
No need to thank, the pleasure is mine
We should try do this again some time
And if your wallet ain't fat, don't worry about it

Bad Behaviour,Tongue n’ Cheek,2009.0,"I'm doin' it major with the bad behavior (x8)
I'm a popular player, these girls know how I do
If they ain't comin' alone I'm happy leaving with two
I act like I ain't got a clue, but I know the cue
And if I'm totally honest, it really ain't nothin' new
I'm on the club scene looking for love
I mean looking for women that's thrillin' or willin' to get in the tub
Champagne, bubble bath, sex, and all the above
She could powder her nose, but I'll be skippin' the drugs
I might have a little smoke, plus a little joke
I hope if I ask nicely, she'll give me deep throat
If not, there's the front door, don't forget your coat (Move!)
Don't come back, I don't ever want to see you, beau
Back to the club, I'm bobbin' and weavin'
Grab a girl, it's nothin' long, we're leavin'
Goin' to my hotel room for a meetin'
Wake up the neighbors, no body sleepin'!
Doin' it major, I'm doin' it major
Money money money and bad behavior
Doin' it major, I'm doin' it major
Lookin' for a girl that'll do me a favor

Doin' it major with the bad behavior
Doin' it major with the bad behavior
Doin' it major with the bad behavior
Bad behavior, bad behavior
I live the super star life: young, rich, and I'm famous
Got no time for no body talkin' out of their anus (No!)
Lookin' for a lady willin' to get after some capers
It's a no-brainer, even if I was brainless
All I know is money, guns, clothes, cars, and women
And God knows that that's a recipe for sinnin'
But on the flip side it's a recipe for winnin'
I do 130 in a Porche Turbo grinnin'
I'm speedin', I'm burnin' rubber
With my super star girl I'm a super star lover
Three's not a crowd, there's room for another
There's queer sister and her lesbian lover
The girl's in luck, I'm untucked, it don't stop
Missionary, doggy, and whatnot, they all drop
Seven years on the chart and I'm still hot
Wanna know how I'm doin' it? I'll tell you what:

I get a blow job drivin', slippin' and slide
In between the traffic in the bus lane gettin' high
I'm over the limit but I'm overly in it
And if I see police, I'm gonna have to wing it
I'm breakin' the law, breakin' the law
Put the pedal to the floor 'till it can't take it no more
And if you ever try a thing, then I'm breakin' your jaw
Put my hand behind your head and smack your face on the floor
I want a two-way mirror with a midget behind it
And I hid the camera so no body could find it
In my sex dungeon we could make a movie
With my favorite groupie, yeah, she's a beauty
She's a pretty young thing, yeah, she's a cutey
Double D breasts and her bottom is juicy
Got me runnin' round the place like Kriss Akabusi
With my wanger hangin' out, cause I'm ballin' loosely (Ballin'!)

Bubbles,Maths + English,2007.0,"I'm a young raggo bredder from the LDN
In my Nike Air bubbles and they cost 110
Got these beanies on my line and they all want the leng
I'm a ghetto superstar, come straight from the ends
And I walk it like I talk it, blud, I ain't just hype
Making moves for the money everyday and everynight
Best to believe I keep it tight
Best to believe I'm moving right
Keep my business on the low, you best to believe I'm outta sight
I like money-money-money, girls-girls, cash-cash
I let the champagne splash
Yo, I'm not a gangbanger but I'm good with a mash
Make you scratch your head and wonder, is he really that flash?
But it really doesn't matter, cause you know I keep it moving
Middle of the dance floor, lean-up, grooving
Baby cocked her bumper out, you know I gotta wind it
When we leave the club, I'm gonna really get behind it

Nike Air bubbles on my feet looking fresh
And my brand-new garms on, dressed to impress
Got my phone line popping, all these beanies got a crush
Keep something in my pocket in case these bredders try and rush
Nike Air bubbles on my feet looking fresh
And my brand-new garms on, dressed to impress
Got my phone line popping, all these beanies got a crush
Keep something in my pocket in case these bredders try to rush

Brown eyes, 5'10, dark skin
I'm Mr Dizzee Rascal, why you even asking?
The undercover lover, girls call me buff ting
But used to keep a balaclava resting on my chin
And it's an ends ting, hustle-hustle, bling-bling
I'm not waiting around to hear the fat lady sing
The point of what I'm saying is the answer within
But life's a jungle, everybody wants to be the the king
But it's alright though, I got my eyes on the prize
Money in my grill, bigger picture in my eyes
Hands around my testicles, middle finger risen
Every step that I take is a step with precision
I'm precise, precisely why my future's looking nice
The penthouse is lovely, it's a shame about the price
But you only live twice, that's on the real
No matter where I am, I'll always be the real deal


Education starts with discipline, I'm listening
But conversations kinda muffled since I got rich n ting
Verbal turd indirectly spoke, I never heard a thing
Underground or overground, what's the difference, I'm the king
Not divine right, it's my hindsight, I see it all
Because I ain't afraid to spread my wings and fly, you're a fool
Talking like you're mighty and you're high, but I know you're small
There's no logic in your gossip, just the writings on the wall
Over-ignorant, you ain't gully, you just play thug
Far from the realest, O-Dog, Menace, you're a mug
If you're deep, why have you gotta roll 50 to the club?
Blood, who do you think you are fooling with that fake crew love?
These streets don't care for no long-term plan
These roads don't give a damn about any man
I try and show these bredders, they refuse to understand
So I'll just keep doing what I'm doing while I can, man",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-bubbles-lyrics

Help me raise my profile and my money
Don't get it confused
I will never lose
Standardly, i'll always get my dues
You ain't never gonna catch me sleeping
I will never snooze
But you still might catch me kicking back
On a luxury cruise
With a freaky model
Blowing me like a didgeridoo
Is it the shit that we do
On a regular
I'm telling ya
Try play me for my money
And i'll put a shell in ya

Still a name brand
And I ain't part of no chain gang
Call me Lewis Hamilton I got my own lane man
Speeding down the motorway, my cars never been towed away
Traffic wardens take my autograph and then they go away
I think I might quit music, should I disappear with no delay
And open up a shop with all the clothes that I just throw away
You know I stay
Bad the the bone
Pockets fully blown
Sippin' on Patron
I'm like their favorite handbag
Girls don't want to leave me alone
Plus I'm pussy prone
Always on the bone
Always in the zone
Love 'em and I leave 'em
Put 'em in the taxi home
That's what time it is

Won't tell you what I paid for it because it's frightenin'

Can’t Tek No More,Tongue n’ Cheek,2009.0,"""Can't tek no more of the... We can't tek no more of the... ""
Dizzee Rascal, Shy FX, dun kno
It's all too much fam...
Kids on the road start young these days
Walk street with a knife and gun these days
No fun these days
Do dirt, end up on the run these days
Whole lot of pain, suffering, and badness
Whole lot of madness
Too many grieving mothers and sadness
It ain't safe in the manor no more
Take one false step and you could get bored
Kids caught up in the hype and the nonsense
Do what they hear in the songs and the TV
Picking up bust and making up fuss for the sake of money cause it looks so easy
But they don't understand, they can't comprehend
Cause they're too caught up trying to rep their ends, for the reputation
And pass it on to the next generation
""Can't tek no more of the... We can't tek no more of the... ""
We're heading in to a recession
No banks, no loans, no mortgages
One step away from a depression
Can't even work out the cause of it
But everybody gotta forfeit
Wanna buy a house but they just can't afford it
And it's so unfortunate
Money lenders are extortionate
So you gotta move in with your mates or mum
Ain't gotta place of your own, now your glum, feeling dumb
It's a crowded house and you can't have fun cause when you have sex they can hear when you cum
Gotta pay council tax and it kills
Not to mention the rent and bills
And you hate how it feels
Until... you go to the club and you pop some pills
""Can't tek no more of the... We can't tek no more of the... ""
Look around everywhere is a crisis
Pure extortion at petrol prices
Cost of living is already large then they hit you with a congestion charge
8 whole sterling
Just to drive into town I'm hurting
Hole in my pocket and my wallet is burning
But I fork out from the money I'm earning
Stomach is turning
If I don't pay on the day
Gotta pay 60 pounds another day
Keeps going up every time I don't pay
Them government boy will tow it away
Still can't take the bus or the train
It's a pain in the arse and a strain on the brain
Price of a ticket is just insane
But sooner or later there's gotta be a change
""Can't tek no more of the... We can't tek no more of the... ""
So much war in the world today
Too many women and kids get blown away
I say ""what's the cause of it?""
Money as usual
Poor and the innocent suffer as usual
None of it's useful, just brutal
Can't understand why there can't be truth
And the government make it necessary
To put the countries obituary
Cause war pays the bills
Doesn't matter how many innocent people killed
Just as long as pockets are properly filled
And a profit is made and they can chill
Just keepin' it real
Don't wanna blow it outta proportion
But it looks like straight up extortion
So this is a caution
Don't just stand there, do something 'bout it
This is important, this is important, this is important, this is important, this is important, this is...

Graftin’,Showtime,2004.0,"So what d'you think you know 'bout London city now aye
What'cha think you know ?
Big Ben tells the time (stand up, stand up)
Above the London roads that hold the grime (the grime)
Young hustlers we graft all the time
Non stop UK wot

East London, ghetto, west London, ghetto, north London ghetto, south London
East London, ghetto, west London, ghetto, north London ghetto, south London

Yo as I hustle in the city for a paper stack
Lord knows I got the devil on ma back
It's a cold world, I gotta stay on track
Dog eat dog, others gain if you lack
In the LDN, where I learn to attract
Clientele, I can show you where it's at
First things first, get a plot 'n' a flat
Next up, get a black hoodie and a hat
Living in the big brother's camera view
Keep an eye out for the boys in blue
Straight 5 years, getting caught, that's you
Sitting in a cell, still wondering who
Couldn't keep quiet, now you're on a diet
Mash potatoes, cauliflower and stew
Pissed off with not a lot to do
And the word on the street don't ever seem new
And none of it don't ever seem true
Endless hype, who do you believe?
And will it relieve the loneliness at night
(You) Remain deceived if you're convinced it might
You know full well what the streets are like
Few more Merc's, couple more ranges
Other than that, not a lot else changes

Sky looks grey in London city
We stay graftin', 'cos we're gritty
Hustle hustle constantly, hustle hustle hustle constantly
Sky looks grey in London city
We stay graftin', 'cos we're gritty
Hustle hustle constantly, hustle hustle hustle constantly

I used to roll money up against the wall
Never did wanna play hopscotch
Now I'm pinnacle parking, laughing
'Cos I'm dark in a white man's cotch
And I've been doing this since Tamagotch'
I G.I. Joe anybody in my face, invadin' my space
I'll klingon star, bring it on star, WATCH!
By the end of the hours on the clock, I'll end your days
You'll think I'm crazed when I give you the midnight rock
End of sentence...full stop
Now what you gonna say about that
I'll put all your plans on lock
Make you put all your mans on the spot
I'm totally everything that you're not
I'm totally mad, you've lost the plot
To even consider getting me got
Carried off to a hospital block in shock
On the table, ready to operate, never mate
I dictate and delegate, who's heavyweight
I'm king of the ring, make moves in any state
LDN we do our thing

Sky looks grey in London city
We stay graftin', 'cos we're gritty
Hustle hustle constantly, hustle hustle hustle constantly
Sky looks grey in London city
We stay graftin', 'cos we're gritty
Hustle hustle constantly, hustle hustle hustle constantly
Damn right, yeah
Young hustlers, London city stand up
I'm a show you, its gritty out ere
Yeah man serious...
I swear to you, it ain't all teacups (nah man)
Up in Buckingham Palace (nah man)
I'm a show you how gritty it is out here (yeah man)
Serious
You gonna know
You gonna understand

Temptation,Maths + English,2007.0,"Gotta keep my head above water
Gotta stay head-strong, keep rolling on
No point getting caught in the hype is long
Like I don't know right from wrong
So I gotta be real
Nothing to prove, I'm still
Big in the hood, I feel
So in control, I'm chill
No one ain't knocking off Dill
So I stay top on the bill
I'm the main event, the headliner
Went from jungle DJ to rhymer
Never thought I would be the big timer
But I still par it like, yo, it's a minor
Cause I still rep my ends, still check my friends
Can I keep it up? I guess it all depends
If I can keep my mind right
Don't get tempted by the limelight
I think I'll be alright

Temptation leads like your naughty mate
The one that used to get you in bother
The one you can never bring yourself to hate

Can't avoid the temptation
But I know I gotta change my ways
And keep my nose clean, gotta fix up
Take a look at my life cause I ain't sixteen
And I ain't no boy, ain't no kid
The world ain't flat and the picture's big
Certain things that I gotta get rid
And a whole lot more that I gotta get with
So I gotta stay and roam on my own
Gotta move on, I can't stay at home
Cause I know what's there is all the same
Crack, cocaine and ghetto fame
Cold hard cash and a bit of a name
And I've see it all, so I need a change
Lost too many bredrens to the game
And you could say temptation's to blame


We used to be tight
Me and my naughty friends
Caused pure madness in the ends
I mean day and night
We robbed, we stole, we loved to fight
Smoking, drinking, joyriding
Drugs, thugs, not law-abiding
Reckless youngsters, no direction
No sign of correction
But then I switched it up, changed my ways
Got in the area like, ""Oh my days""
But not my naughty friends, they're not fazed
Can't believe that this music pays
See no reason why we can't do
All the things that we've always done
Still in my heart I know that's just wrong
But it's hard to fight the temptation, son",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-temptation-lyrics
Life Keeps Moving On,The Fifth ,2013.0,"Some people sayin it's the end of days
We're on the brink of Armageddon, only thing that we can do is pray
If that's the case then fuck it anyway
If I ain't promised tomorrow I'm gonna live for today
No point in stressin or riskin a dream up over only for a rumour
Cause sooner or later everybody's gonna meet their maker
Til then you'll find me in the Cayman Islands or Jamaica
Drinking rum with a chaser, laughin because the groove is greater
I'm getting wasted on a boat but I ain't seasick
I'm busy tryna convince this girl to let me see her bits
I'm tryna convince her even more that she should see mine
You think I'm being a sexist, this is just I politic
I know some people find it hard to swallow it
But I just catch a vibe and then I follow it
Don't mean that I'm a hollow prick
I just ain't thick enough to think that I can live forever
So until my last endeavour I'd die for whatever, whatever

No matter what you say
No matter what you say
Life keeps moving on
No matter what you do
Just do what you're doing
Life keeps moving on
(Because) Life keeps moving on

Some people spend their whole lives tryna please the world
Some men go crazy or go broke tryna please a girl
Some women give away their booties for diamonds or pearls
I just kick back, I take a look and I say oh well
Cause it's my skin off my nose, I just want money or clothes
I'm happy, no lucky hoes, I'm layin stacks on my toes
Ain't got no time for enemies and I don't care about foes
Everyone knows and it shows that I'm bringin them O's
That means I'm fuckin the midgets, that means I'm countin them figures
Over the night I consider myself an everyday jigga but bugger
My car's cold, it will make you shiver
I know, go crazy bitch, turn the music up, I'll make you quiver
Speeding through the city, it's a part bass bangin
Trip tonic, thinkin supersonic
Leave alright that's how you getting fly
Sayin ah fuck it cause it's only caution
If I die tomorrow you straight up having a blast

No matter what you say
No matter what you say
Life keeps moving on
No matter what you do
Just do what you're doing
Life keeps moving on
(Because) Life keeps moving on

Forget that nostalgia shit cause I ain't got time
Don't care what happened yesterday, today is damn fine
There's no blast from the past that can top what I got
Til this present day I still shine
So when they told me recline I kindly declined
Whatever's in front of me positively behind
I will never rewind, meaning I would never ever be grind
Just to say you cry, now I look forward to 2 times
I love a bit of free time with a weeb done
She might be Scottish, either way she's hottish
I know that ain't even a word, maybe I've lost the plottish
Maybe I'm crazy or maybe it's just another one
Living between the wars, revolutions and the earthquakes
The recessions, pollutions, and political fakes
All I need is my mace, my mama couple sunny breaks
And if the world ends tomorrow I'm straight

No matter what you say
No matter what you say
Life keeps moving on
No matter what you do
Just do what you're doing
Life keeps moving on

Paranoid,Maths + English,2007.0,"Rinse me out, use me up, cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up, cuss me down, fuck me up
They wanna rinse me out, use me up, cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up, cuss me down, fuck me up

Sometimes when I'm on my own
And there ain't no one around I feel all alone
Laying in my bed I'm a nervous wreck
And I wind myself up until I'm vexed
Keep telling myself they're out to get me
And I ain't sure who, so I make it up
Come to my own conclusions I'm crazy
Start thinking up all kinds of stuff
Like, fuck my girl, I know she cheating
That golddigger bitch just thieving
Act like I don't care but I'm grieving
Start switching up for no reason
Told myself I ain't got no friends
Fuck my people, fuck my ends
No rational thought, I'm low
I'm paranoid, all I know is they wanna

Rinse me out, use me up, cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up, cuss me down, fuck me up
They wanna rinse me out, use me up, cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up, cuss me down, fuck me up

And then I think about beef
Over the years I've had so much grief
Whole lot of drama in and out of East
Won't let anyone take me for a sheaf
And mans say they got my back
But it's really all just chat
Cause when it all gets on top
They leave me alone to scrap
And I went to the ends, heard whispers
Old friends chatting bout kidnapping
Now they hurt my pride and ego
I don't care about rap, Im strapping
But the olders told me ignore it
Cause I really ain't got time for it
And the ghetto, I already saw it
I'm in the world now, I gotta explore it
I can't let 'em

Rinse me out, use me up, cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up, cuss me down, fuck me up
They wanna rinse me out, use me up, cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up, cuss me down, fuck me up

No guts, no glory, no get, no gain
No love, no pain, I'm going insane
It's all too much for the brain
I'm so paranoid, I feel strange
And it's so long-range
Been too long, I gotta make some change
Fuck the world, I'd rather take some blame
Or I could just buy a platinum chain
Diamond rings and and other shiny things
Maybe the bling'll help me maintain
Or at least that it help to explain
What's my path, am I in the right lane?
Why I feel so left out in the rain?
Why's it hard, it should be simple and plain
All I see when I'm in this game
Everybody wanna..

Rinse me out, use me up, cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up, cuss me down, fuck me up
They wanna rinse me out, use me up, cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up, cuss me down, fuck me up",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-paranoid-lyrics
Excuse Me Please,Maths + English,2007.0,"Sometimes I think the whole world's gone crazy
The shit I see, it don't cease to amaze me
I get baffled everytime I try and suss it
And now I've had enough, so excuse me please, fuck it

Can somebody tell me what this world's about
Can somebody tell me what this life's about
I just can't work it out
No sense, no logic, I can't get a grip of it
I do my best to understand it but I've never got it
I watch the people slug it out and struggle in the system
But the end result's the same whether a Muslim or a Christian
There's so much hate in the world we're fighting, what are we fighting for?
When the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting ignored
Lord


I took it there and now it's time to take it further
If a policeman kills somebody, is that policeman still a murderer?
He's got a worthy cause, I guess that gives him some immunity
Or is he just another lost soul in our community?
To take a life's a serious thing and only God can judge it
Would he look at it like it's for the safety of the public?
And if you don't wanna pay the price you really shouldn't thug it
I know I am playing with fire but fuck it, I love it
Cause

Fuck it, ya get me?
I don't give no...
Is it me?
It must just be me
You know, know what I mean?
There's no point even going through it, man
It is the fuck what it is, I guess
You know what I mean?
Fuck it!

Who's in charge of the stupid place?
I wanna punch his stupid face
Yeah, it ain't right but it's a shame
Gotta be someone I can blame
Someones gotta have answers, someone's written a masterplan
Cause I can't see no sign of God's involvement, this has gotta be man
So much madness in the world
So much evil and confusion
But there's so much good as well
So there's got to be some solution
So that means there must be hope
Maybe room for revolution
So that means there must be hope
Maybe room for revolution

Fuck it, ya get me?
Shout to my people out there
Wonderin what it is really all about
I guess we'll never know

Watch Your Back,The Fifth ,2013.0,"So you wanna be a bad man but you're barely a bad boy
Keep going and the way you keep going
Not before long you'll see you'll only gonna be a sad boy
Yea you're hot right now but you ain't the only my boy
Keep it up, you'll get stabbed, boy
It will be very inconvenient
You'll be coughin up blood like a idiot
And your recovery won't be immediate
And the healing pain – you'll be feeling it
If you don't wanna die cold just come off the road
It's simple, it don't take a genius
I know your body on lock and you use the hardest
You're on this ting and your game's the largest
But everything you stand for is retarded
The grim reaper will disregard it
You wear your face on a t-shirt? Fine
But I ain't gonna put your face on mine
I fuck a few, no I ain't got time
So you'd better just welcome your mind
You've got a brain, start using it
You've got a chance at life, stop abusing it
It will be a damn waste just losin it
But if you wanna be a G go through with it

You'd better watch your back
'Cause your so called friends ain't got yo back
And the haters will gonna try hold you back
And they're dying, waiting to stab your back
And you're only gonna wanna go get em whacked
When you go too fast no turning back
What's done is done, can't take it back
So you better wise up and face the facts

Way you proving, think you're on top but you're really losing
Cruising for a bruising, it ain't amusing
It won't be a joke when you're on the news 'cause of the way you're movin
There's no excusing, you should be choosing life in a Jacuzzi instead you're screaming sue you
What you know about LA shootings?
If you ain't been States, you ain't even been to too here(?)
Can't do a drive-by with no car
And if you shoot you ain't gonna get far
You're bait, everybody knows who you are
So you might as well say it's a par
If you're doing it to impress the hoes
Same hoe when you're locked up will fuck yo bro
Should be walkin, start touchin toes
Suckin slow, aloud in yo face, what the fuck do you know?
Every time I look at my Hublot
It reminds me I'm a boss so you go
I'd let you get your stars strapped but you ain't got a clue tho
I know you're gonna make it, who knows?
But keep your head in your books and stay away from them crooks
And mind your mouth, it don't mean that you're shook
And the gangsta shit, it ain't quite what it looks
So quit the half and take note for the hook off(?)

You'd better watch your back
'Cause your so called friends ain't got yo back
And the haters will gonna try hold you back
And they're dying, waiting to stab your back
And you're only gonna wanna go get em whacked
When you go too fast no turning back
What's done is done, can't take it back
So you better wise up and face the facts

Yo cousin! I know you're not budgin
It makes no difference to me, I'm buzzin
My floss comin down, a dozen it's really laughin
It's like you in a hurry to die, why you rushin
You're only gonna suffer when it all comes crashin'
And it called your bluffin, he could a hard something
You still facin the fact, ain't nobody's laughin
Make a wrong move and you're gonna get tucked in
Gonna rushed in, A&E, feelin' disgustin'
You can't go piss cause you're ain't even plugged in
The key to life is not a fuck thing
Ain't no trust in fucks, there's no love king
Crime don't pay unless you do the big
And if you do your bid be ready to deal with
The bullshit, stress, the haters and the pigs
So don't be so fast and try being a kid, just live

You'd better watch your back
'Cause your so called friends ain't got yo back
And the haters will gonna try hold you back
And they're dying, waiting to stab your back
And you're only gonna wanna go get em whacked
When you go too fast no turning back
What's done is done, can't take it back
So you better wise up and face the facts",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-watch-your-back-lyrics
Good,The Fifth ,2013.0,"I wanna get away, I wanna disappear
To somewhere where the sun is shining and the water's clear
Nobody talking bullshit in my ear
Just lots of cheery people drinking beer
On the coast and the dearest could be near
And lots of smiley faces, cocktails and chasers
Penthouses in high places
No problem, hate you, just wakin, I'm bakin for my delevation
Love makin the penetration
The kind of vacation that I wanna be taking
I just wanna see some palm trees and take shopping sprees
If I'm lacking what I see I'm copping or dropping Ps
No stopping me whilst looking for investments on properties
Some hotties don't wanna please
Some beaches with cool breezes – that's what I need
Strike up a conversation
No complication, no confrontation
Nobody tryna get up off they station
Just a lot of rehabilitation, no hesitation
Every day is just one big celebration

You know I gotta think I'm fly girl
Even when I put your smiles up girl
We just tryna kill some time ah
Something kinda like fine wine
See you ain't gotta see my shine now girl
Promising to multiply it girl
I ain't gotta act all wild, I'm good
You already know my style

(Now everybody get your hands up high)
We'll have a real good time
Real good time
We're gonna feel so fine
(Get your hands up high)
Feel so alive
We'll have a real good time
Real good time
We're gonna feel so fine
If you're runnin back to bed let me know that we can get it right

Fresh fruit, fresh juice, vitamin boost
I'm looser than a goose, I'm not a recluse
I'm socializing, looking over the horizon, feeling so alive
I'm mesmerized, I'm stopping over the ocean ready to take a dive
Or take five and get back, can sit back
I'm fresher than a Tic-Tac with nothing else to distract me
Exactly what the fuck to all the refs, I'm being away in the corner
Do I drop a form or taking a flight?
You with? It will be warmer
Now it's hotter than the sauna, 2 block of water
And just to keep me cool
I'm getting a massage in my quarters, feeling like a moola
All I need in comfort me, now girl what's the stop with me?
Then hit the time and get her back, eat or munch with me
When in doubt we'll keep it moving
Pay the bill and see a movie
After that we'll hit the club and keep it super groovy
Feelin kinda woozy cause of the liquid we're abusing
Boy it's really quite amusing, plus we're vibing with the music

You know I gotta think I'm fly girl
Even when I put your smiles up girl
We just tryna kill some time ah
Something kinda like fine wine
See you ain't gotta see my shine now girl
Promising to multiply it girl
I ain't gotta act all wild, I'm good

Bang Bang,The Fifth ,2013.0,"I'm sick and tired of running, I'm sick and tired of fronting
I just wanna be myself, I'm sick and tired of stunting
I'm sick of strangers in my life, From girl to girl I'm jumping
Don't know what I'm living for no more but I wanna die for something
There's more to the life than big bully, I'm out here tryna fight my cooling
Every day, same shit, burn the union
Cop bars from evening til morning
Sometimes still feels like I'm fooling, go up to the eye of storm
I never thought that I could be so corny
Why wasn't there nobody to warn me
Why couldn't I see the signs? How could I not read between the lines
Thought I could somehow be divine
But it feels like God left me behind
But that's not true, I'm so blessed
That's Mos Def, I'm so fresh
And I don't wanna protest but I feel so soulless, I'm a hopeless

It's a bad time, but I'm I until I die
That's every motherfuckin day
Real good shot for a spot at the top
Girl if I go bang bang
So bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang
Girl if I go bang bang
So bang bang bang bang bang bang motherfucker
Girl if I go bang bang
Now do it

I'm likely most conceded, but I ain't the flashy type
Can't really take the media, don't like the flashy lights
Can't stand the nosy people cause they're so full of spite
Won't let nobody judge me, I know what's wrong and right
Might have some line of addiction, I'm so cool out to the mix
I'm so full of contradiction when I spend time and money with chicks in Switzerland
And if they will go fix it
Got my foot in the shoe if it fits it
But this time I done said I'm a real good misfit, runnin around time like a dipstick
Don't watch the main so I'm clueless
Out of all and I'm ruthless
I try to hold it down but I'm useless
And I can't stand the fault, the world knows my movements
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Feels like I'm blazing, the love and the passion inside
I'm ready to flash and I'm ready to ride
I'm likin the vibe


I work my ass off, nothing given on a silver platter
I get more money then I blow it like it doesn't matter
A bunch of stuff I'll probably never use, just booze and clatter
Don't put me on no pedestal because I'm just a rapper
And that's just me being truthful
And it hurts but it feels so beautiful
It's a lot more suitable
Don't want no blood on my chemicals
So hard to kids and hide yo wife
And please don't make me say it twice
I'm cold as ice, I'm so not nice
And I'm just out here tryna live my life

Not tryna be in a hype
But I feel so glad that I'm tryna see the light
Inside I can feel the fire
When I ignite it'll be alright",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-bang-bang-lyrics
Showtime,Showtime,2004.0,"Hello, hello and welcome
My name's Dizzee Rascal
They call me Rascola or sometimes
They call me Rasket
Formally The Boy in da Corner
If you're here for the first time
I'd like to tell you a bit about
What this is, this is, you know
Whatever you make it
Whatever you perceive it to be
Serious, aha
Dizzee Rascal, London's finest

This journey starts 6 years ago
In run-down housing estate in Bow
East London south-east UK
Was a young man lets call this young man Ray
Frustrated with being around the way
Would say ""I'm bored"" until one day
Gathered up sum change and in exchange
Got turntables off Tony
Not only were they whack, they were wooden
But he took 'em
Cause it was a bargain and it was a good'un
And he said to himself ""who wouldn't?""
Why not, then he took a little trot to DJ Targets spot
Stood outside of the door and knocked
Asked what jungle records you got
Must be something you wanna get shot, off, blot
Didn't buy beats, he ready to quit, gave him the whole lot
Then Ray had little click, they were hot
Young gun soldiers, but it all flopped
Still it didn't make Ray wanna give up the fight
Ray just picked up the mic, would write
Lyrics while excluded
No glitz and glamour included
Like crime for money, dough
Crime pays, didn't you know
Even though Ray come across slow
Broke shit down, brung another new flow
Made beats in the back room
Teacher gave him a little spare time
Then they got a little bit of radio airtime
1 AM till 3, be in school by 9
This was clearly a positive sign
Learning bout beats breaks and bars
Didn't chat about champagne and cars
More concerned with you know, the grime
Made it a touch difficult to shine
Among these so-called underground stars
Some resented him thus presenting
Him with pure dumbness like retards
It didn't matter, Ray would say, ""OK""
I'm gonna be a real star one day
Went through dramas along the way
But he stood firm pressed on with the wordplay
Went through dramas along the way
But he stood firm pressed on with the wordplay
Went through dramas along the way
Let's take a look at Ray today
Today, today, today, today, today...

Don’t stop til you see daylight, look (Daylight)

Tip-toes
Life ain't always nice
That's how shit goes
You know we're goin' on black
'Cause we're blickrows
And I can't be seen with these
What did I say last night? I bet your chick knows
You were not knockin' the boots how we hit toes
Your girl's the same as all
Bimbo's, freak's and nimpho's (Yo, look)
I got an idea, make dough on the spot
I mean right here
Now give girls the paper for the whole year
Bring drama 'cause I don't know fear
And my head feels so clear
Move to the mic, MC's are like, ""oh dear""
Some try catching me but they're not near
Not ever, not now, or not here way too hot here, yo

Didn’t wanna care
Left that boy in a gutter somewhere (In the gutter)
Talk live-O, wanna talk breh (Breh)

Big mouth, loudmouth, watch that
Pretty girl, buff girl, doggy dat (What?)

Bad minders get a backslap, what?
Call the shots like top cat (Yo)

Guns in the air
Feds on the case but we don’t care (Look)

Hats off, baseline, trim, no fade
He's hot, somebody get first aid
You ain't great, go to your bed dismayed
Get angry, get crossed, get paid
Get jacked, get hotted up with a spade
Bloodclart, wanna be on top, get sprayed
Dizzee Rascal can't get air raid
Look, ain't dirty, I'm filthy copaid
Watch wifey, she's easily swayed
That girl's prepaid, you will get played
Talk rough or you might get betrayed
Yo, Roll deep on these
And, put these MC's on deep freeze (Freeze)
And, hit these with these, and rip these
Come like faster, we flip these
So, please don't ramp with these (Nah)
Fearless, angry, sick MC's
Don't like Christine's or Britney's
Lala's or tinky winky's and
This is strictly for pickney's
Oldschool Afro's, dry white knees (Look)
 factories, stick these
Endless gunshots, we lick these
And trick these, CID""s with ease

Hardback (Industry),Maths + English,2007.0,"Hard back, stern face
Play your position and know your place
Only move when the money's calling
Take my advice, you'll be balling
You need a hard back, stern face
Play your position and know your place
Only move when the money's calling
Take my advice, you'll be balling

First up it's important that you keep your shit original
Try and keep that copycat shit to a minimal
People want something that they never heard before
If it's been done, leave it, they don't wanna hear no more
Secondly here's another clever thing that you can do
Find yourself a good manager who's really got a clue
Cause there're so many to choose from, they all look the part
But it's difficult to come across the ones that's really smart
And can stand firm and steady when the label's talking shit
Well-respected, keeps it gangsta, but does everything legit
And dependable, you can trust to handle your biz
And can really make sure of what the situation is
Next up, find a record label that ain't full of pricks
One that lets you breathe artistically but makes you come with hits
Congratulations, now you got your a deal, you're set to go
Let me fill you in just a couple of things you need to know


Next up, change your number, change your phone and change your chip
Cause there's gonna be a lot of people ringing talking shit
Whether bredrens wanting money, cause now suddenly you're rich
Or some dumb hating fassies trying to take you for a bitch
Yeah I know it's minor now and you can handle it, it's nothing
But eventually you're really gonna wanna do something
And that's counter-productive, beefin over bullshit
You can never stop them dumb-bredrens tryin to pull shit
Plus you're in the limelight well-paid verbalist
Which leads me on to my next subject - journalists
These are the people that can pull your name about
So be careful what you're saying when you're talking out your mouth
Aand avoid being ignorant, tone down the thug shit
Come to interviews buzzin, tone down the drug shit
Keep your eye on the ball, mind on the drop
And before you know you had the whole world on your knob


Here's something that I should've stressed early on
Don't go spending all your money till it's gone
Cause the tax man's gonna want his paper when it's due
And there's nobody above the tax man, especially you
And another thing, buy a house before you buy a car
Don't tell no one where you are, even better if you're far
Everybody knows you're a gangsta and that Porsche looks great
But do you really want it sitting on that council estate
Differently watch where you choose to socialize
Keep an eye out for trouble, watch for devils in disguise
And please don't be fooled by no pretty females
Play it safe, never let them know your full details
I ain't saying be para', I'm just saying be sure
You can never know if that bitch is braggin' what she saw
And aside from makin money keep lovin what you do
I ain't saying nothin what cause the rest is up to you

Yeah, you dun' know
Just a little guideline there for all my real man dem from the roads
Trying to get into this music ting, yeah
Big shout out to my bredrin DJ Semtex
Hang tight Cage
Big-up the Newham Generals, yeah
We do it liveo
Hang tight UGK
It's a London thing
International, worldwide, you don't care, you dun' know
UK, Dirtee Stank is the label
What!

'Nuff madness
You can't tell me nothing
And I've done pure badness
'Nuff badness
You can't tell me nothing
And I've had a lot of drama
'Nuff drama
You can't tell me nothing
Just look in my eyes, it's all too clear
But it don't matter, cause I'm still here

D-the-i-the-zz-the-e-the-e, straight from the LDN
I don't wanna hear no talk about streets and all that thug from way back when
Been a bad boy, I'll destroy your joy, gotta toy that'll put that shit to a end
That and I walk the walk cause I talk the talk, you got a problem, step to me then
Otherwise don't pretend, stop, breathe, count to ten
Keep on chatting or get the leng
I stand up tall, I don't bend
So if you got a crew, go get your men
We can meet up, say where and when
I'll be on time like Big Ben
Couldn't ever take me for a speng
And I ain't saying it again


I like to move it, move it
You want beef prove it
You got a problem, don't excuse it
You got a 9mm, it's your prerogative, use it
You got a temper, lose it
If not just bounce to the music
That's a better choice anyway, choose it
Cause you know that you can't refuse it
Watch the beat, how I bruise it
Wild out and nod your head, stupid
I ain't cupid, no love lost
I get paid in the end whatever the cost
I'm the boss, still work with me
Don't stand looking pretty like Kate Moss
Put your hands up like you couldn't give a toss
Either way you know I'm gonna get my point across

Get me?
I'm still fucking here
I don't give a shit
I don't answer to none of you pussyholes
I live my fucking life, yeah
I live my fucking life
Fuck you
(Oi rudeboy, what's all the hyping for?)
These pussyholes don't want no war
They are just acting, I've seen it before
They are just acting, I've seen it before
(Rudeboy, what's all the hyping for?)
These pussyholes don't want no war
They are just acting, I've seen it before
They are just acting, I've seen it before

Finally, fuck who's listening
The world don't owe me shit and the feeling's mutual
I just wanna be neutral but I ain't no prick
So no, I don't smile when I see you, grin when I greet you
If it weren't business I'd beat you
And I'd rather be a asshole than a pussyhole
You're a bitch and I see through
So fuck you and fuck your ego
Cause I really was a poor little negro
Don't need no chain or a throwback
I'm really from the streets and you know that
But I really would rather be touring
Cause most players on the roads ain't scoring
But now it's Maths & English, I'm focused
And it's Dirtee Stank, so take notice

Imagine,Showtime,2004.0,"Imagine if I showed you one day I was leaving the hood
Would you call me a sellout? Would you say it's all good?
Would you follow if you could?
Or would you just tell me get the hell out?
And imagine if I showed you that I found another way
Of getting dough without doing dirt - let's blurt
Would you love me for giving me some hope
Or resent me cos your pride got hurt?
Imagine if we never grew up on a council estate
And was country manor raised with a spoon in our mouth
Would we still be making fuss about the East and the South
Would we shiver at the robberies, murder and the crack
And thank god that we didn't have to live like that
Just the image on the TV as we're comfortably sat
Sipping wine, room lit by the summer sunshine
Not a worry in the world as we casually chat
Oblivious to how we would be living on the flipside
No experience, not a clue about a rough ride
No harassment, no boy dem on our backside
That would be *amazing*, still
I know you wonder would make you any less real?
What's the current spot you're standing in, offering?
If you had a better offer would you go for the kill?
Snap out of your daydream, how do you feel?
Does it all seem worthwhile for ya?
Try and put it in perspective
Retrospective of your profile and your honour
Do you wanna hang about, or are you a goner?
Come along, think fast, it's decision time
You've been living in the grime, don't you wanna climb?
The ladder of life, the wall of enlightenment
Or are you looking for the hype and excitement?
Cos with so much drama in the LDN
It's kind of hard trying to find legal money to spend
Generation genocide looks possible
The rate at which we draw for the skeng and pretend
That we don't know who the real enemy is
Who should be held responsible, instead we defend
A couple square meters of pavement, in the end
What would be achieved my friends?",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-imagine-lyrics

Where I asked him to get out of my FACE
Then I get a live late night phone call
And I leave him there

Pissed 'cause its gone past business hours on the clock this
So they could look good and tell tales
It's all jiggy and we look like pals

I know you're tired of the same old scenery
And I could change all that so easily
Don't worry 'bout a thing, girl, take a chance
I'll take you to the south of France
Like Cannes, if anybody can, I can
We can go shopping in Milan
I just hope you understand, I hope you see it clear
It really don't matter how far or near
'Cause there's no distance that can stop my persistence
Just a few days of the year
Plus I've got clout, so let's ride out
We ain't gotta fly, we can just drive that
We can have a rave or we can hide out
And won't tell nobody, let them find out
If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away
Drive away, get away
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away
Drive away, take a holiday
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
Don't watch my passport photo
I know I look a bit loco
And I know that my Spanish is so-so
But let's try keep that on the low-low
'Cause we're going Ibiza
I've got friends that really wanna meet ya
With champagne and a whole lot of love
It's all good, darling, a Blue Marlin will please ya
And I'll never let your belly get empty
Even when your belly's full you're still sexy
We can ride speed boats, we can ride jet skis
I'll show you the time of your life if you let me
I just want to put a smile on your pretty face
If I didn't it'd just be your pretty waist
So you look like a girl with a bit of taste
So I couldn't take you just any place
If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away

We can do what you want to, baby
If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away
Drive away, take a holiday
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
I know you're really busy and I know you've got plans
But are you really too busy for a sun tan?
I ain't talking about walking down the high street
I'm talking about laying on a bright white beach
With a Pina Colada or whatever you'd rather
White wine, that's fine, just get me a lager
Then after we'll take a truck to the night spot
The hot spot, the top spot, party around the clock
And when we get there its strictly VIP
No need for ID, security know me
No waiting in line, no high entry fee
Don't worry about nothing when you're beside me
I'll get you lively and loosen you up
Have a bit of champagne, it'll boost you up
I wanna move you up, I wanna take you away
So have a word, darling, what do you say?
If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away
Drive away, get away
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away

Today they're gonna know I'm a star
They better know I ain't having a bar
I'm gonna take it to the next level foot on the pedal
I'm goin' for the gold medal got my hand on my heart
And I swear down I'm gonna go hard
Until I'm dearly departed, I'm so excited
I think it's bout time I had a little celebration and you're all invited
I couldn't give a damn not even the slightest
My swags on point and my flows the tightest
I'll never sell my soul god helped me write this
Plus I know what a fight is
I been through the struggle
In and out of trouble
Couple of close calls
But you can't hear the pain anymore in my vocals
It ain't even because of the pro tools
In total I feel so complete with life its sweet
You gotta scream
Scream it from your heart
Feel it from your soul
Scream it from your heart, if you mean it
Feel it from your heart
Scream it from your soul
Feel it from your heart, if you need it
I feel like rocky on the steps
I coulda drowned in the blood and the sweat
But instead I show the world I don't pet
A world wide athletic champion on deck
Nobody can't mess with my rep
Nah I'm a seasoned vet
And I'm the best I'm as good as it gets
I'm the champion now
So I don't care who they call next
I've earned my respect
Now they're loving the way I flex
Run up in the offices they're writing a major check
So it doesn't matter about the butterflies in my solar plex
Never the nervous wreck, cool and calm
Keep sharp and focused and stay out of harm
Plus I can't be rocked
You know I'm far too hot to be given the drop
Stay better then I'm never gonna give up the top spot
I'm keeping the spot locked
I'm throwing the keys now everybody sing with me, scream
Scream it from your heart
Feel it from your soul
Scream it from your heart
If you mean it (scream)
Feel it from your heart
Scream it from your soul
Feel it from your heart
If you need it, ha ha ah, ha ha ah
Boy it's lonely at the top
But it's overcrowded at the bottom
And where I come from's overly rotten
I'm from the east side I ain't forgotten
But it's bigger than that
World wide peoples livin' is wack
It's bigger than grime and bigger than rap
People living in crap
No fresh water out of the tap
Plus they're being attacked what kinda living is that
Look anywhere in the map
Too many young boys stuck in the trap
Too many young boys running round strapped, ready to clap
Too many young girls fall in the gap
They're fallin' for chat from dumb cats that need to fall back
Think about life cause there ain't no re run
No DVD no second season
When you're the future flame maybe you could be one
Till then let chorus be sung, scream",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-scream-lyrics

Sometimes I'm lost, look up at the sky
Sometimes I feel to cry, but somehow I still get by
Sometimes I'm lost, askin' myself why
Sometimes I feel to cry, but somehow I still get by

We grew up in the ghetto, saw real life pain
Real life struggle, wiv real life strain
Real life kiddies, wiv real life guns
'N' real life mothers lose real life sons
Gang wars erupting on the dance floor in Seasons
Beef after beef, jus' to be da top geezers
Big arm slash, hit da 
Stratford Rex
Ghetto high brudas, gotta maintain reps
What's that all about, I ask my self before I swing
More time, I'm beefin' over any little thing
Beef in any area, region or vicinity
My ghetto frame of mind makes me prone to hostility
To many brethrens locked up, too many young baby mothers
Each 'n' every crew n colour, ghetto sisters and brothers
If you know your from da slums, keep reppin' no doubt
Stay ghetto if you must, just remember to get out

Sometimes I'm lost, look up at the sky
Sometimes I feel to cry, but somehow I still get by
Sometimes I'm lost, askin' myself why
Sometimes I feel to cry, but somehow I still get by
Sometimes I feel to cry, look up at the sky, get by",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-get-by-lyrics
Da Feelin’,Maths + English,2007.0,"Summer in the city such a very special time
If you put aside the traffic, air-pollution and the grime
You'll be pleased to be reminded that the girls are looking fine
And apart from money that's the only thing that's on my mind
Short skirts, belly-tops, fake tans
String-vests with the bra underneath for the mans
Getting hard off of half of a glimpse, I got plans
To be scooping up a couple of buff tings if I can
If I can't then I'm still live
I'll go and check my little yachty by the seaside
Cause I know she's live, plus she's a delight
She gives me hospitality, she treats me right
That's what I need, right?
And if not, I'm on a little mission to Los Angeles
To check my Beverly Hill honey to see if she can handle this
Pimping ain't no easy thing and some of these chicks are scandalous
But I'm a player and I say I gotta be the man for this
I love it!

You won't believe some of the shit I've seen, man
Trust me
Yo, I ain't even gonna go through it
But differently I wanna send out a shout out to all my people out there, yeah
Big shout to the man dem, the ladies
You know you gotta put in your grind if you wanna get what you really want out of life
Trust me, you only get one run

I don't believe in fate
Life is what you make it, make it great
I'm trying to elevate, concentrate on getting my paper straight
Survive the great escape, from the ends I used to congregate
Until I could no longer wait, I had to find a purpose
Otherwise I would've been worthless, making fuss on the estate
Ignorant to what the earth is offering when I should take
Every chance and every opportunity to try and make
Every second and every breath of life something to celebrate
So I've been around the world now, rose to the occasion
Boast different folks, different strokes, black, white and Asian
All these ladies look incredible, still got me gazing
Riding jet-skis and powerboats, feel so amazing
Club-hopping in Ibiza, I've got Pacha on lock
Pull up right outside the entrance in a Hummer, people clock
Then they stop, stare and wonder who I am and who I'm not
I just take it in my stride, but I ain't never felt this hot
And I love it, love it

It's all good man, ya get me?
Yo, you know you gonna catch me out Ibiza again, yeah
I gotta go there again
Get the Hummer out
We're driving down the streets knocking down motorbikes, it's nothing
Turn up at the club
Girls everywhere
It's all vibes though, man
Yo, big shout to my man like Paddy, yeah
Hang tight Shy FX - you done know!
Big up Cajun
Yeah man, I gotta big up the man like Scope
Big shout to T-Power, yeah
Hang tight Alexis, yeah
Yo, Dirtee Skank's the label, man

World Outside,Maths + English,2007.0,"I got shit I wanna share with you
Couple things explaining reasons why I can't be there with you
Back in the day we parred and thought we'd never split paths
Didn't see no definite ending to the madness and the laughs
Never thought I would pack in the jackin' for something more solid
I ain't changed, I just found a better way to steer my knowledge
Running around hype and criminal antics fed me for a while
But studio gave me a lot more creative style
And took me to another world beyond the estate
Some kind of haven from the beef and some of the stress, mate
I wouldn't call it no escape, the roads are in my heart
Making it that more difficult for me to climb the chart (for real)
But it's the sacrifice I made, it's all good, star
Same reason I ain't always in the hood star
I do my thing, you know I'm grafting like I always was
It just ain't quite like it was, simply cause

There's world outside of the manor and I want you to see it
I can see it, I can see it
Can you see it? (x3)

Money, cars, guns and women most males desire
I gonna stay red-blooded til I expire
Not caught up in the hype, I'm caught up in the scheme of things
Seen a couple of figures but I still dream of things
Like the kind of shit money can't connect me with
Unconditional love I won't regret to give
I'm young, black, rich and ruthless, I swear, star
Still if you need a helping hand you know I'm there, star
I'm from the street, you're from the street, we all done dirt
Now it's time to flip the script, fuck the suffering and the hurt
Cause I've seen the bigger picture, it's all good
There really is a world outside of the hood

I know there's more than this man
There has to be more than this man
Nah there's gotta be more than this man
Standardly
There's gotta be somewhere other than this man",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-world-outside-lyrics

No flow, no show, no go, okay, it's off to work, I go, okay
On top above all I flow Fabian way, beyond control

Put my lifetime of grime in rhymes
Rudeboy, these are turbulent times
Some of you invest in Glocks or nines
I've seen no definite stop signs
On top above all and real, ain't afraid to show how I feel
Ain't afraid to kill bill, keep in touch with the stainless steel
Ain't too many doing it like bill

Long jeopardy in this fucked up game
Extreme levels of pleasure and pain

Forever grow, forever king
Trying without bling bling
Whatever long term hustler forever doe
Forever glow, superstar I've gone clear
To ever iroe solo your never near, I'm sincere
But fear, whatever name up for year I'm here 
Forever ill stick it and steer
Forever whatever the postcode or path

Dig real deep through the depths of my mind
Dig real deep through the depths of my mind
D-D-Dig real deep through the depths of my mind
Lord knows what I’ll find when I reach (rewind)
D-Dig real deep through the depths of my mind
Dig real deep through the depths of my mind (‘cause I)
Dig real deep through the depths of my mind
Lord knows what I’ll find when I reach reach
Hook:
(‘cause I got) so much to say, in so little time
In such a short space I’ve got so much to do
But if I can’t find a way around, I’ll find a way across
And if I can’t a way across, I’ll bore straight through X2
Verse 1:
I find myself in a pickle
This music game is fickle
Surrounded by big dogs that I consider lickle
As they try-‘n’ step I tickle…
… feet-of the giants and my appliance of knowledge makes waves from a ripple
On my shoulder is a chip(‘ll)
Some love it, some hate the idea
I still publicly thug it
Squeeze a dollar from a nickel
My outlook: feel free to judge it
I’ll be damned if you budge it
Got my name on my chequebook – sole trading
I ain’t even old ageing but question if my souls fading
I’m maintaining
‘cause I can’t say I’m ?????
But who’s to say I’ll make unless I fake it
And if I phonify myself, will it bonify my wealth
It’s painstaking I’ve got my head aching
Stressed out ‘cause I let my money rake in
Hook
Verse 1:
Through my trials and tribulations, I skip across the nation
High sky flier I see no limitations
Only God’s creations and devil’s temptations
I seek to reap the benefits of my publications
So show me where’s the money, spare me the congra-tu-lation
Forget the industry’s bewilderment and fascination
Everybody wanna be ghetto but nobody wanna be poor
All you follow fashion dummies ain’t eating no more
You can dirty stank to thank me, you can start with cheque
But I you choose to blank, I take it to the next step
I couldn’t be a fool I keep it gully to the n..????
Rewind and recall, I demand and collect

Verse 3:
To all my UK road youts
Stick on your hustle boots (yeah)
Steady on trudge along
Operation get the wong
In and out, come and gone
Find yourself a craft, harness it and make it strong
Perfect it
Before you know they’ll respect it
Remember, it’s your movie so direct it
Never let nobody tamper with it or correct
And by any means do what you gotta to protect it
‘cause there’s money to be made, it’s a cold world too
Nobody got your best interest at heart like you
So any obstacles you come across, find your way around
But if you feel it can’t be found
BORE STRAIGHT THROUGH

You can say I sideswipe, 
you can say I'm overrated
You can slag me off to every female I've ever dated
You can say I'm kinda meek, you can say I'm just a prick
Just say you what you want and what you will but say it quick

Cos I'm flyin, I ain't got time
You must makin moves, why you watchin mine?
You got so much to say about my grime
You must be UP THERE, I see you up there

You can I'm arrogant, you should probably say I'm vain
You can say my head swole since I see a little fame
You can say I left the hood, my success was a mistake
You can say I'm under pressure, you can say I'm bound to break
You can never say I'm fake, cos I always keep it real

Don't make no more inquiries, fuck you is my only statement
The only answer I'm about to give you:
Fuck you and whoever came with you
Fuck them and anybody related, fuck if I get me frustrated
Cos I ain't the type to hype and rare
Hope I scare em, make 'em fear me

Don't need no rubber, dog, don't need no west-end club
Cheap scrub, tried to holler at me acting like it's love
Fake fucks, say they claiming blood, say they claiming crip
No rap sheet on their ear, lots of bullshit coming out their lips

I do it at my leisure, I make it look easy
I do it at my leisure, you breddas can't see me
I do it at my leisure, I couldn't give a toss man
I do it at my leisure, cause I'm my own boss man",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-leisure-lyrics
Driving With Nowhere to Go,Maths + English,2007,"Wake up in the morning
For another average day
I've got plans to spend my hours
In another average way
I'll get ready, eat my breakfast
Call my average ghetto friends
For another average ghetto situation in the end
But it seems I needn't bother
I can hear my mobile ringin'
'Sin my bedroom– ""What you want?""
""Nuffin' blood, I'm just chillin'. What you want?""
""Nuffin' either, ain't you got no links or nuttin'?""
""Na but get me from my yard
""We'll find some on da roads or sum'in'.""

Drive that motor fulla smoke
And the smell stickin' to my clothes
I'm broke and everybody knows
I'm drivin' with nowhere to go
It's clear that I'm puttin' on a show
Waitin' for the day that I'll blow
'Til then you can catch me on the roads
Drivin' with nowhere to go

Now we're in the motor
And we're driving five up
And I'm seriously hoping
That the feds don't drive up
If they do they'll smell the smoke
And find some objects made for hurtin'
And some brown and some white
Cause I know my ???'s working
Plus they'll know this car is stolen
And that ain't no lucky guess
Cos' there's no one sittin' in it
Ever passed the drivin' test
TDA - joy ridin' -
Just anotha common number
But if flashing lights appear
I'm the first to do a runner


Now I'm drawin' on da zoo
And I'm feeling all mong
We've been drivin' for a while
I don't know how long
But I'll tell you this for free
I ain't even tryin' to talk
And for now I'm feelin' thankful
That I haven' got to walk

Anyway, we're just cruisin'
In the same ol' places
In the same ol' manner
With the same ol' faces
Where the same old p'lice
Give the same ol' chases
And I can't see change
'Cause there ain't no traces",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-driving-with-nowhere-to-go-lyrics

Pussyole (Old School),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Rudeboy, don't watch that
'Cause if it's arms house, I'll rock that
And if it's on top, you know I got that
Come through with a big baseball bat
Like blood, don't make me get old skool
Blood, don't make me get old skool
Blood, don't make me get old skool
Blood, don't make me get old skool
Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He's a pussy'ole, he's a chief, leave him
Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He ain't got your back, if it's beef leave him
Why you rollin' with that pussy'ole?
Movin' with that pussy'ole?
You know that he's a pussy'ole
I showed you he's a pussy'ole
He's always been a pussy'ole
So he'll always be a pussy'ole
But you're still with that pussy'ole
You must be a pussy'ole
That's that bredder always frontin' like he's strong
Sneaky fake fuck always runnin' to his brother when it's on
Hardly backs the beef, last one swingin'
First one runnin', makin' up stories, he's a chief
Bringin' bredders to the ends, actin' up
Puttin' on a show, tryin' talk funny to his friends
But he's really not a don, they know it
And you know it, so something must be seriously wrong
'Cause you're parrin', his mum calls you darlin'
But his brother has got you shottin' with no way of stoppin'
I heard you both had beef with an older brer
You took a spark and he just stood there
Now that boy's a pussy'ole, say it ain't true
It started because of him and ended with you
And that's the kind of shit that's gonna continue
But I guess it don't matter if that's what you're into
Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He's a pussy'ole, he's a chief, leave him
Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He ain't got your back, if it's beef leave him
Why you rollin' with that pussy'ole?
Movin' with that pussy'ole?
You know that he's a pussy'ole
I showed you he's a pussy'ole
He's always been a pussy'ole
So he'll always be a pussy'ole
But you're still with that pussy'ole
You must be a pussy'ole
The sun the biggest star in the sky
But naturally it's gotta make room for the moon every night
Everything's got its time limit, even relationships
Everything's sunny when the friendship's tight
A friend in need is a friend indeed
But a friend with no money and no weed
Can flip the script at a ridiculous speed
And make a best friend an ex-friend for the P
A couple of years ago in my road youth days
I was into pirate radio, I guess it was a phase
There was this one particular MC man
Was a older in my ends and I thought he was the don
So I started rollin' with him kind of like a little brother
My cousin used to say he was a pussy undercover
I didn't think that it was nothin' more than jealousy
But I wish I would've listened every time he told me
Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He's a pussy'ole, he's a chief, leave him
Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He ain't got your back, if it's beef leave him
Why you rollin' with that pussy'ole?
Movin' with that pussy'ole?
You know that he's a pussy'ole
I showed you he's a pussy'ole
He's always been a pussy'ole
So he'll always be a pussy'ole
But you're still with that pussy'ole
You must be a pussy'ole
Pussy'ole, pussy'ole
Pussy'ole, pussy'ole
Stay away from them pussy'oles, you can have it all
Live endlessly, tremendous, forever ball
Stand up for something or for anything you'll fall
But differently, know when not to lose your cool
'Cause it ain't what you show, it's what you're concealin'
Put a smile on the deepest negative feelin'
Stand tall even when they're hatin' and they're schemin'
Then watch your money rise right to the ceilin'
Stand tall even when they're hatin' and they're schemin'
Then watch your money rise right to the ceilin'
Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He's a pussy'ole, he's a chief, leave him
Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He ain't got your back, if it's beef leave him
Why you rollin' with that pussy'ole?
Movin' with that pussy'ole?
You know that he's a pussy'ole

Close, close, wanna get close on the coast
Ghost, ghost
Pickin' me a winner
Picky hair an' I was a little bit thinner
3310 with a customized ringer
I was tryna holla at Lavinia but she weren't ina
'Cos I was a sinner, thought I was a minger
Never had a Bimmer
Rollin' through the ends on a stolen Aprillia
Waiting for the Dominos guy to deliver for a free dinner
Thought I knew it all I was just a beginner, never was a singer
I was on pirate radio way before I heard Mike Skinner
Wagwan killer, yeah, that's my nigga
Talk about race but its just way bigger
I ain't gonna waste no time on Twitter
Done with the jibba, cry me a river
Say it to my face or say it to my trigger
You go figure, or reconsider, Indian giver
Lookin' for a chocolate girl with a hint of vanilla
And she can bring a Indian with her
I just want a bosom for a pillow
An' I got a little bit o' skrilla
We can get a boat and we can get a villa
Or we can be on South Beach real nigga liver
All killer, no filler
I don't wanna brag or boast
I don't cater and I don't host
When they ask what I do I say I do the most
Then I get ghost, on the coast like I am supposed
Don't pose and I do not post
And that's why these girls wanna try play me
Close, close, wanna get close on the coast
Ghost, ghost don't pose and I don't post
Close, close, wanna get close on the coast

Ah, ghost
And I'm not talkin' about power
I was in HMP and I couldn't stop daydreaming about sweet and sour
I told them when I hit road this time, it's gonna rain and shower
I paint pictures with words like Vincent Van Gogh
When he painted the sunflower
Back when Dizzee made dreams, it was our age tryna make dreams come true
And in them things it would channel you
And I would roll deep with a pack of yutes
Weed and Rizla, pillar zoot
Drank cray like sizzla', that's the roots
Back then, man wore bubble coats into school and Timberland boots
Talkin' about back when man had the cowboy ting
And the middle bit would spin
And if you made it bang near anything metal
All you would hear was ping, ping
Ghost, made man look like nearly headless Nick
This one's gonna get messy like Lionel
Three way lops, that's a hat-trick
How are you a bad boy with no weapons
That's like Harry Potter with no broomstick
How are you a trap star with a knife
But then can forget there's 36 in a brick
Please don't glamorize jail like being on the wing makes you the Kidd
Ghost, that means in the background with a million quid
Close, close, wanna get close on the coast
Ghost, ghost don't pose and I don't post
Close, close, wanna get close on the coast

Scared Men Can’t Win,DirteeTV.com Vol. 2,2014.0,"Scared men can't win (oh no, fuck it)
Scared men can't win (oh no, fuck it)

Cold-blooded and heartless
I spar with lost souls in the darkness
I shine bright regardless, and hit 'em with the sharpness
I don't wanna be another carcass
A lot of broken dreams and war stories
Obsessed with freedom or glory
Sick state of mind, still I stay on the grind
Can't keep the feeling up, surely
No god, no love, no loyalty, money spoilt me
And I've seen more dirt than a toilet seat
Everybody wanna live like royalty
But nobody wanna pay the price, they wanna take a free slice
It's weak to be nice, and cool to be cold as ice
So I just roll the dice, looking for snake eyes
With breddas who take lives so you better take five

When I touch down, it's danger
Don't believe in babies in mangers
I put my trust and my faith in the stainless
Mother is god, devil is me
Cradle to the grave, been so FT
Ain't no man's slave, I make my own P
Yeah, I've got a good link so it does come cheap
Well that ain't for you, it's only for me cuh
You're a mess like a  in a black dress
Me and them ain't blessed, you can never try test
Not even with a vest cause I aim for the neck
Or aim for the head, fuck chest
Real life come like a game of chess
Man will get G checked if they don't move correct

Chatting and rapping about how you're gunning with a snub
You're a fool, you ain't no donny in the ends
You're a dead man walking, don't put money on my head
I won't let them trouble me again
The next time I come around bucking up a skeng
I'm ready to ride, ready to die like Machiavelli
Sparta marching, causing a storm like Halle Berry
Lines and rhymes, striking mine

Gettin red, I let my nuts hang
Wear a lot of red but it ain't no gang
Chased by the Feds but it ain't no thang

92 carrots in my chain
Jumpin out a red-candy thin
Never snitch, never tell
Get caught up, go back to jail
Before I tell them hoes shit
Fuck the law, they can eat my dick

Go to the pen and get with them punks
Then come home tryin to act tough

Dun kno Dizzee was a big drawer
Six shooter like be Hova
Wanna test I'ma run 'em over
In a blacked out, big body Range Rover
Outside, inside, shut your trap
Come for the war so I come to attack
I ain't gonna lie, I ain't got a six pack
I've got a bad temper and a baseball bat
Red ski mask and a black doggy hat
Gonna make a boy run like roll and rat
Going on filthy, going on black
Bust an MC like David Plack
Streetwise, hang with a gang of fat guys
Baptise, make a whole crew capsize
Slap guys if they wanna tell pork pies

Rascal's chucking MC's like stones
Bad boy forever like Sean Puffy Combs
Inside, outside, running all zones
Set trend, get girls like Tom Jones
Break bones, make a housewife leave home
Yeah his wifey don't leave me alone
That boy's arrogant, send for the chrome
Come barefoot like Fred Flintstone, yo
You got a big gun? Come bring it out
Butterfly knife? Come alone fling it out
We can just do it old school, swing it out
I suggest you best start winging out
Who's that, what's that boydem about?
Yeah man, quick man, start spreading out
Kidnap, take 'em Rascal's hideout
Cold sweat, tie you up, get burnt out

He say, she say stop (We ain't havin' it)

Check this Wiley Kat, Dizzee Rascholar
E3 LON, doing it proper
Can't stop-a, 'cause we got it on lock-a
Come into the darnce it's all chock-a-block-a
And now they wanna see me flop-a
Up north, half an hour in a chopper
Flying in a helicopter
Me and my crew, we bring horror
Live for today and I live for tomorrow
Wiley, I hit em with a master flow
Fast, slow, me and Rascal too cold
The return of the 9mm kid
The creeper kid, the MC beater kid
Technique shaolin, them no ready for this
'Cause I'm hotter on the riddim, do you get my gist?
As I creep through the mist on my tai-chi fists
If you wanna start war then I'm ready for this, yo

Buss up the floor, you don't cut no slack
Dancehall King, you're not at all laid back
Make up for what the uvva girls lack
Look so good, you got me going off ch...ch.ch, track

See a bit of sweat drippin' down your thigh
But somehow, you still stay high an' dry

U can’t tell me nuffini,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Cause I've been through madness, 'nuff madness
You can't tell me nothing
And I've done pure badness, 'nuff badness
You can't tell me nothing
And I've had a lot of drama, 'nuff drama
You can't tell me nothing
Just look in my eyes, it's all too clear
But it don't matter 'cause I'm still here
D, the I, the Z Z, the E, the E
Straight from the LDN
I don't wanna hear no talk about streets
And all that thug from way back when
Been a bad boy, I'll destroy your joy
Gotta toy that'll put that shit to an end
That and I walk the walk 'cause I talk the talk
You got a problem, step to me then
Otherwise don't pretend, stop, breathe, count to ten
Keep on chatting or get the length
I stand up tall, I don't bend
So if you got a crew, go get your men
We can meet up, say where and when
I'll be on time like Big Ben
Couldn't ever take me for a speng
And I ain't saying it again
Cause I've been through madness, 'nuff madness
You can't tell me nothing
And I've done pure badness, 'nuff badness
You can't tell me nothing
And I've had a lot of drama, 'nuff drama
You can't tell me nothing
Just look in my eyes, it's all too clear
But it don't matter 'cause I'm still here
I like to move it, move it
You want beef, prove it
You got a problem, don't excuse it
You got a 9mm, it's your prerogative, use it
You got a temper, lose it
If not just bounce to the music
That's a better choice anyway, choose it
'Cause you know that you can't refuse it
Watch the beat, how I bruise it
Wild out and nod your head, stupid
I ain't cupid, no love lost
I get paid in the end whatever the cost
I'm the boss, still work with me
Don't stand looking pretty like Kate Moss
Put your hands up like you couldn't give a toss
Either way, you know I'm gonna get my point across
Cause I've been through madness, 'nuff madness
You can't tell me nothing
And I've done pure badness, 'nuff badness
You can't tell me nothing
And I've had a lot of drama, 'nuff drama
You can't tell me nothing
Just look in my eyes, it's all too clear
But it don't matter 'cause I'm still here
I'm still here
Get me? I'm still fucking here
I don't give a shit
I don't answer to none of you pussy-holes
I live my fucking life, yeah
I live my fucking life, fuck you, what
Oi rudeboy, what's all the hyping for?
These pussy-holes don't want no war
They're just acting, I've seen it before
They're just acting, I've seen it before
Rudeboy, what's all the hyping for?
These pussy-holes don't want no war
They're just acting, I've seen it before
They're just acting, I've seen it before
Finally, fuck, who's listening?
The world don't owe me shit
And the feeling's mutual
I just wanna be neutral
But I ain't no prick
So no, I don't smile when I see you, grin when I greet you
If it weren't business I'd beat you
And I'd rather be a asshole than a pussy-hole
You're a bitch and I see through
So fuck you and fuck your ego
'Cause I really was a poor little Negro
Don't need no chain or a throwback
I'm really from the streets and you know that
But I really would rather be touring
'Cause most players on the roads ain't scoring
But now it's Maths and English, I'm focused
And it's Dirtee Stank, so take notice
Cause I've been through madness, 'nuff madness
You can't tell me nothing
And I've done pure badness, 'nuff badness
You can't tell me nothing
And I've had a lot of drama, 'nuff drama
You can't tell me nothing

Drivin’,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Wake up in the morning
For another average day
I've got plans to spend my hours
In another average way
I'll get ready, eat my breakfast
Call my average ghetto friends
For another average ghetto situation in the end
But it seems I needn't bother
I can hear my mobile ringin'
'Sin my bedroom– ""What you want?""
""Nuffin' blood, I'm just chillin'. What you want?""
""Nuffin' either, ain't you got no links or nuttin'?""
""Na but get me from my yard
""We'll find some on da roads or sum'in'.""

Drive that motor fulla smoke
And the smell stickin' to my clothes
I'm broke and everybody knows
I'm drivin' with nowhere to go
It's clear that I'm puttin' on a show
Waitin' for the day that I'll blow
'Til then you can catch me on the roads
Drivin' with nowhere to go

Now we're in the motor
And we're driving five up
And I'm seriously hoping
That the feds don't drive up
If they do they'll smell the smoke
And find some objects made for hurtin'
And some brown and some white
Cause I know my ???'s working
Plus they'll know this car is stolen
And that ain't no lucky guess
Cos' there's no one sittin' in it
Ever passed the drivin' test
TDA - joy ridin' -
Just anotha common number
But if flashing lights appear
I'm the first to do a runner


Now I'm drawin' on da zoo
And I'm feeling all mong
We've been drivin' for a while
I don't know how long
But I'll tell you this for free
I ain't even tryin' to talk
And for now I'm feelin' thankful
That I haven' got to walk

Anyway, we're just cruisin'
In the same ol' places
In the same ol' manner
With the same ol' faces
Where the same old p'lice
Give the same ol' chases
And I can't see change
'Cause there ain't no traces",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-drivin-lyrics
Is This Real?,Dream,2004.0,"It's hard to chill these days
It's hard to just lay back, chill
Know what I mean?
Alright, it's like you can't forget the feeling man
So hard to chill man, there's always suttin' y'know?
Always suttin'
And you know what
Smoking's just making me feel even worse man
Know dat
Whatever man
I ain't even smoke to chill
I mean what's real boy?
What's real?
Real's having your own back boy
Gotta have your back boy
Nobody got my back like me man
I'm out to get mine girl
I'm out to get mine

Yo
I started this on my own
I'll see this through on my own
Continue this alone
Probably best left alone
Cause I've learned life is real
I can't help how I feel
Wish I was made of steel
Haven't quit, never will
But I think to myself
Will I make it off the shelf?
Boom par , I want some wealth
Maintain mental health
So I sit getting high
Asking when, asking why
Sleep with my samurai
Ready for any guy
I can't believe this is life
Full of pain, full of strife
Could resort to suicide
But I must live my life
Gotta fight, gotta fend
Know the lick, know the trend
Looks like we're nearly men
Wish we could start again
'Cause we was kids, we was young
Used to love having fun
Now we look up to gun
And the aim's only one
Make money every day
Any how, any way
I try to choose the legal way
But I really gotta say

Sometimes I wonder is this real, is this real?
Can life alone affect the way I feel, way I feel?
Wish I could just lay back and chill
But I really need to know is this real, is this real?
Sometimes I wonder is this real, is this real?
Can life alone affect the way I feel, way I feel?
Wish I could just lay back and chill
But I really need to know is this real, is this real?

I get high to get by
Sitting in the street like ""Penny for the Guy?""
Police take snapshots of the drive-by
But I won't stick around, I'm camera shy
I get high to get by
Sitting in the street with my eyes in the sky
Friends all scatter, that girls act sly
And fellas want beef but they don't know why
I get high to stay calm
Sitting on the street with my face in my palm
Otherwise I would cause harm
With this knife on the hand on the end of my arm
I get high to stay wise
Sitting in the top floor of a high rise
They say I'm big but they don't know my real size
Whole teams take up the truth to the sky 
Truth is, somehow I climbed out of six car crashes last year
And every day it just gets more and more clear
That just maybe I'm meant to be here
And even though I got beef all over
I know one day it'll all be over
Stolen vehicles, guns, and crack
Roads and sections, the way I act
But yeah I still find time for my friends
And I hope they find time for each other
Treat that girl like she's your sister
Treat that boy like he's your brother
We done been through endless change, endless tragedy, endless trouble
Just stand firm and tall the end, no doubt we'll make it through the struggle

Sometimes I wonder is this real, is this real?
Can life alone affect the way I feel, way I feel?
Wish I could just lay back and chill
But I really need to know is this real, is this real?
Sometimes I wonder is this real, is this real?
Can life alone affect the way I feel, way I feel?
Wish I could just lay back and chill
But I really need to know is this real, is this real?",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-is-this-real-lyrics
Da feelini,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Summer in the city
Such a very special time
If you put aside the traffic
Air pollution and the grime
You be pleased to be reminded
That the girls are looking fine
And apart from money
That's the only thing that's on my mind
Short skirts, belly tops, fake tan
String vests with the bra underneath
So the man's getting hard off
Of half of a glimpse
I got plans to be scooping up
A couple buff tings if I can
If I can't then I'm still live
I go and check
My little yappy by the seaside
'Cause I know she's live
Plus she's a dealer
She gives me hospitality
She treats me right
That's what I need right?
And if not, then I'm on
A little mission to Los Angeles
To check my Beverly Hill honey
To see I she can handle this
Pimping ain't no easy thing
And some of these chicks are scandalous
But I'm a player and I say
I gotta be the man for this, I love you
I don't believe in fate
Life is what you make it
Make it great, I'm tryna elevate
Concentrate on getting
My papers straight
Survive the great escape
From the ends I use to congregate
Until I could no longer wait
I had to find the bruvas
Otherwise I would have been worthless
Making fast on the estate
Ignorant to what the earth is offering
When I should take
Every chance and every opportunity
To try and make
Every second and every breath
Of life something to celebrate
So I been around the world now
Close to the occasional boast
Different folks, different strokes
Black, white and asian
All these ladies look incredible
Still got me gazing
Riding jet skies, on power boats
Feel so amazing
Club popping in Ibiza
I got Pacha on lock
Pull up right outside the entrance
In the Hummer, people glare
Then they stop, stare and wonder
Who I am and who I'm not
I just take it in my stride
But I ain't never felt this hot and I love you",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-da-feelini-lyrics

Footsie
]
Yeah Foots you know you got me on this lemon ting
Yeah cuz, you keep on quitting
Yo cuz, I can't though man there's something in it man
It's the E7 lemon
I've been showing everyone about this shit I swear to you man
They can't understand man we need to break it down to them
Oi blud man go shoobs be lighting up on zoots and man don't know what's going on, man wanna throw their zoots away
[Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal & 
Footsie
]
Yo, I wanna leave that skunk alone but I don't wanna sit drunk at home on my own
I really wanna get in the zone and there's only one real answer - get Foots on the phone
Wagwan blud
Have you got that lemon zest, that citrus fresh, simply the best
I really wanna give it a test and see what all the fuss is about
I don't doubt it's bless
So then we link up, I get a sample
I take a deep breath, ""Hmm it's wonderful""
I take a few more now I feel comfortable
Pack full of vitamins I'm grateful
And now I feel loose, so glad I was introduced to that lemon juice
But if you still don't feel what I say 
Just take a puff of that yellow stuff and

Puff the magic lemon
Straight out of E7
Puff the magic lemon
Closest thing to heaven

I enjoy billing zoots just like I enjoy billing tunes
In my yard there's a cloud of fumes
You can smell the scent all around the room, it's lemon
Yeah you can tell that stinking smell it goes down well, it's lemon
Don't offer man sales, quiet as well just give me a bell, it's lemon
I'm a lemon head, bill a big zoot when I go to my bed
Knock me out, lick off my head
Wake up next morning still red
Rass, the zoot that I hold in my bed
Closed my mind, coulda ended up dead
It's the best ting since sliced bread
Just hear what the chorus says

Puff the magic lemon
Straight out of E7
Puff the magic lemon
Closest thing to heaven
You can get halfway there for a tenner
All the way there for a score
And you'll be laughing if you buy more
You can take your bredrin two eight scores

I'm puffing, I'm puffing, on that magical lemon
With all the mandem from E7
And I got a cat coming down from Devon
So I gotta make sure the Q weighs seven
Cats don't play when it comes to the lemon
There's no delay when it comes to the lemon
 the tick you better pay for the lemon
Let me school the cats about lemon
When you're feeling weak, when you're feeling sore
Bun a spliff, take a draw
When you finish that, make some money buy more
It's the only way, it's the only cure and
That little personal draw will stink out your yard like half a door
Why'd you think that I call it  four, indoors

Puff the magic lemon
Straight out of E7
Puff the magic lemon
Closest thing to heaven
Lemon

I smoke lemon all day till my eyes go yellow
I get so cocky I don't wanna say hello
That's why I stay chilled out and mellow
My favourite colour is yellow
Lemme bell up Footsie for one-o, gello or a half
'Cause lemon is good for your back and calf
Neck and heart (Good for your neckle!)
I smoke so much lemon my room is a mess
But I don't care 'cause everyting's bless
When I smoke lemon I don't get stressed
That's why a man see me puffing all bless
I don't want A class, everyting's bless
Who cares what high you think's the best
All I need is lemon for my chest
We just love it, it's the best!

Puff the magic lemon

Respect Us,Crunk & Grime,UnKnown,"Donsky? You call me Donsky? You know who you're talking to my friend?
My family, my children, my mother can hold her head up in any neighbourhood in this city when she walks down the block
I'm known, forget about it, I'm known all over the fucking world
Anybody ask, anybody (DJ Semtex)
 the wrong fucking  (Let's go, yo)

Do it how they didn't wanna do it, now they really wanna try to do that, but I'm telling them no
I'm in a predicament where imitators wanna take my style and have bit of my flow
This copy-catting of my lyrics and my chatting better stop before the gunshots blow
Do you really want it? 'Cos I really wanna give it, if you do just let me know
And I show, arrogance and elegance
But no, tolerance for nonsense
I bring, violence, I'm a nuisance
Kill a MC, leave no evidence
I've got brains and intelligence
But no conscience, no innocence
We roll in the darkened silence
We're presidents in any residence, and I swing for your chin with no hesitance
I'm a captain, you'd better bring your regiments
And you're a failure, don't have no relevance
I'm a champion, winner and victor
Prick you're so not ready, so silly, so heading for the golden gates
No, really you monkeys are playin' with apes
Now guerilla warfare is the purpose I carry this stick for
Plus I've had enough of these little cheap comments from fake MC's, bad minders, and sket ladies
Talking about how it used to be? Well it's a brand new day so leave me be
I don't need you, so you don't need me, your opinion don't interest me
Don't like me? That's fine by me
'Cause from Holly Street to Hollywood, it's all good
From New York to York Hall, it's all cool
You're a fool if you think I'm gonna cease
Now honestly could there really be peace?
It don't seem that way, too tough
Stop with the games, I play too rough
You must be smoking too much puff, divert or be deceased
UK rapper stabbed in Napa, cause of gossip, cause of chatter
""He's still breathing, he's still a dapper""
Retaliate with gun clapper
Truthfully, I can't see very well (Nah)
Don't flatter yourself, you're any girl
Them boys should've sent me to hell, now prepare for the beast

You people are gonna respect me
I bet I make you respect me
You people are gonna respect me
I bet I make you respect me
You people are gonna respect me
I bet I make you respect me
You people are gonna respect me
I bet I make you respect me
Hey, let's get this straight, now, I never fucked anybody over in my life, 
All I have in this world is my boss and my word, and I don't break 'em for no reason
Diverse, I swear

Endless speculation I'm facin'
Constant controversial relations to gun crime at Garage events, with so many claims and no evidence
Suggesting I'm the reason for the UK gun-clap season
I'm legal, may I stress, for the fool, for the sake of
Trident intelligence
Go ahead, check my files all day
Bit of criminal damage and TDA, might be a little bit of violent disorder but I ain't never been locked away (No way)
Got a few mates that have been convicted
Yeah, so what? It's the hand life dealt them
We weren't blessed with the system's TLC
Government should've tried to help them
(Look, I've) been a law breaker, ain't tryna hide it
As for the sentence, ain't tryna ride it
(I) stopped that so I could do this
I'm legit, you may as well kiss my A-S-S, P-L-E-A-S-E
I'm L-E-G-I-T, you ain't got nothing on me
But to the pricks who think I'm slackin', please don't ever be fooled, I'm packin'
This is a welcome and it's a warning, please don't ever just think I'm rapping
You know the score, I'm raw from day, still Dylan the villain from round the way
Feel free to quote anything I say, please don't ever just think I'm chattin'

You people are gonna respect me
I bet I make you respect me
You people are gonna respect me
I bet I make you respect me
You people are gonna respect me
I bet I make you respect me
You people are gonna respect me
I bet I make you respect me

Now we all get to know what it's like when  some assholes gonna step outta the dark and blow your head off
I want you to know what it's like to live that way
I don't wanna hurt you but I'll blow you away if I have to, you understand?
Respect me",https://genius.com/Dizzee-rascal-respect-us-lyrics
