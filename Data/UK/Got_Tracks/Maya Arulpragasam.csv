Goddess of word, bitches I’mma keep it banging

Let the bottom two, let my wisdom work it out
Big on the underground, can’t knock me down
Vicki Leekx bitches, back by dope demand
I sleep on my talent and I stand by it too
I can say lots with a little words or few like
Like Adam had 'em, yeh, me, the madame
Yeah I’ll introduce you to the dooms do dooms
Come let we go, do you like my perfumes?
Made it at home with some gasoline and shrooms
Oil and water are two extremes
We like fucking carpets, you fucking brooms
Why is your tattoo some ugly looking thing?
I got many designs they're downloading on Bing
My cousin got his G.C.S.E.'s decorating
He’s handy you might need him when I finish what I’m saying
Let's be frank, you my stan, I'm your stan
I don’t care what you smoke, what you fucking drank
I'm allowed to be pissed at mates who are yanks
Cause it’s not me and you, it's the fucking banks!

Bitch, my swag bitches, but you can’t touch this
So click, click, click, please get off my dick
Just ‘cause I know more don’t make me thick
I'm a overweight, heavyweight, female Slick Rick
If you need the trees then my shits got stick
I got bug spray, bucket, stick
Tons of the fun stuff, tons and tons of it

72 bottles at her birthday got drank
I must say people I got her to freaking thank
I'm a party fucking animal, if you ain't, scram!
My uncle jumped a boat, it took him to Iran
What started as a life now it got him banned
So I came in a hurry, not a white van
Learnt that Sam, Ram, Chan, are the same man
Corrugated iron wooden shacks
Gated mansions next to XX
Boys on motor bikes next to Maybachs
We got backpacks next to cats from Kyzack
Ex-convicts and diplomats
Rapper and Russians who don't pay tax
These cards are stacked and this is out crack
Rewind, pull it, and bring it all back

If I don’t get you now then I’ll get you by december
You're dancing styles out dated like tinga

I drift in deserts from bumper to bumper
We can rock a dress or we can rock a jumper
You want that pain so I set you on fire

It grew bigger than a politician
Yeah, history is just a competition
Do you wanna sign my petition?
It's for the people with dedication
Some people fuck it up, take vacations
Refugees learn about patience
Sometimes I have many visions
I don't even need a religion
I'm a new frontier, horizons
Yeah, I sail this ship to the thousands
Even aliens see the presentation
Yeah, tune up the dial on the station
And think of me sort of like Tarzan
And I'm swingin' this beat, salvation

I can feel when your heart beats, yeah

Send me your money and I'll send you my song

Lara Croft is soft when it comes to my stuff
She's made up, I'm real, that's enough
Dinosaurs died out and I'm still strong
A little bit of fun, yeah, I don't see it wrong
For something so good, yeah, I've waited too long
I rate that button just to play you this song

Hear me sound the bells

They call me Wally, this is where I'm at
I wear my NRL baseball cap
Parramatta's my team if you know what I mean
To be the captain, that's my dream

My name is Keith from Wilcannia Street
I walk on stilts to read the beat
When it crawls out, I shake a leg
This is my rhyme and that's what I said

First of all I wanna say
I don't really know why you act that way
My name is Maya and people always say
I act kinda strange like a dooba weh
I like fish and mango pickle
When I climb trees, them feet, them tickle
I'm broke this month, didn't pay rent
I had to jump town and my money's all spent (all spent)
I had to jump town and my money's all spent

All you old pigs better watch out for this bit
And I'm here at the game and I'm almost ten
I wanna be an actor like Jackie Chan

Lendal is my name; I like to do back flips
Listen to the words that come from my lips
Jump off the bridge and I'll play the didge
And when I catch a fish, I put it in the fridge

My name is Buddy, I can't stand still
Wilcannia to Dubbo to Broken Hill
I've been movin' around from town-to-town
And this is how I get down!

Rode the BMX when we walked through the bush
The boys fight to ride it, but I just let 'em push
Keith stole an egg from a lil' cuckoo
Kept it safe in his mouth, while he danced jookoo jookoo

There's only one ocean that got fish left
One day we'll have to be a really good chef
And I don't mean us in the bush making meth
Boys if you catch meth you catch your death
When I said that Keith sneezed and had a chick
Broke the little egg in his mouth in little bits

Whatever I'mma rap got fuel in the burner
Off the grid, staying off the radar

Pour yourself a shot of tequila

I'm a fighter and a lover like winter and summer

Got monkey brains and banana
I'll hit you with my antenna
I put soap in my eye
Make it red so I look rawr-rawr-rawr!
So I woke up with my Holy Quran
And found out I like Cadillac
So we're shootin' until the song is up
Little boys are acting up
And baby mothers are going crazy
And the leaders all around cracking up
We goat-rich, we fry
Price of livin' in a shanty town just seems very high
But we still like T.I
But we still look fly
Dancin' as we're shootin' up
And lootin' just to get by (Huh?)

Was it me and God in co-production?

There's 24 hours in a day
I used to spilt it 8, 8, 8
8 - work! 8 - sleep!
And 8 for play!
Now I give it all it takes
Now people on the Internet
A new life for the intellect
People judge me so hard cause I don't floss my titties out
I was born out of dirt like I'm porn in a skirt
I was a little girl who made good, well au revoir, adieu
I put people on the map that never seen a map
I've showed 'em something they've never seen
And hope they make it back!

Electic shadows in my ear got me dancing spinnin'
Northern lights on my mind all the colors rhyme
Loving me all the time keep that on your timeline
I keep my distance even though I shine
For me to tell you things you need to be the right kind
Even though it’s clear like a street sign
Some people don’t get it so I keep 'em in line
It’s good to take a minute and take it all in
It’s so important sometimes that I blow off steam
Got to get another sweater from my helicopter
Got to get a closer look at what they all stick at
Doesn’t need some lights that I used to trick out
I got them from a Chinese dude I went to check out
People need to get some and put some in your pocket
You might need some later when you finally unlock it


Lights on ring cameras and things
Flashing like bling love loving when I sing
Sparkles on the charcoal as a fire lit up
Headlights off a power in the city lit up

Is roll through the city star gazing with you

Lovalot,/\/\ /\ Y /\,2010.0,"They told me this is a free country
But now it feels like a chicken factory
I feel cooped up, I wanna bust free;
Got nothing to lose if you get me

Like a Taliban trucker eating boiled-up yucca
Get my eyes done like I'm in a black burka
Been through shit, yeah it's a fucka'
But now I make tunes, say ""shuck-a-lucka-lucka""
Shuck-a-lucka-la
Shuck-a-lucka-lee
Shuck-a-lucka-lucka-lucka-lucky, lucky me
If you check me, I check you
If they kick you then I'll back you
Say something new, say something cool
Give you my time, but I ain't no fool
Eck-a-eck-a I, break-a-break-a jaw
Every-every time someone steps on my toe

I fight the ones that fight me
I really love a lot, I really love a lot
I really love a lot, I really love a lot
But I fight the ones that fight me
But I fight the ones that fight me
I fight the ones that fight me
But I fight
(Tell me fi 'quint, me nuh 'quint my eye
Nookie clean, nookie tight, and that's no lie)
But I fight
(Tell me fi 'quint, me nuh 'quint my eye
Nookie clean, nookie tight, and that's no lie)
But I fight
But I fight the ones that fight me

Who's in town?
Them no like me, me no like them
Like Hu Jintao
Instead of them I got a new-found gem
Someone I can love up like men
Like Obama needs to love up Chen

Like a hand-me-down sucker throwing bombs out Mecca
Call the good will, get money to get better
Keep your head down like a Unicef worker
If you get hit you can't question the fucker
How come how come I? Yeah but yeah but why?
If I be the F, who the F be the I
If you met me then you'd get me
But if you get me will you get a fee
Shit's meant to be free, where's Bob Marley?
Cause I won't turn my cheek like I'm Gandhi

I fight the ones that fight me
I really love a lot, I really love a lot
I really love a lot, I really love a lot
But I fight the ones that fight me
But I fight the ones that fight me
I fight the ones that fight me
But I fight

Nookie clean, nookie tight, and that's no lie)

Everyone knows, I'm already good on the ground
Most of us stay strong, shit don't really bound us
Then I go on my own, making bombs with rubber bands

I have my heart down so I need a man for romance
Streets are making 'em hard so they selfish little roamers
Jumpin' girl to girl,
Make us meat like burgers
When I get fat I'll pop me out some leaders

Protocol to be a Rocawear model?
It didn't really drop that way, my legs hit the hurdle
Protocol to be a rocker on a label?
It didn't really drop that way, my beats were too evil

Now I put away paper for later so I'm stable
A better something better come, gotta get cable
Ghetto pops, food drops, stored up in my stable
Pop 'em up, pop 'em down, eat 'em off the table

The village got on the phone, said the street is comin' to town
They wanna check my papers, see what I carry around
Credentials are boring, I burnt them at the burial ground
Don't order me about, I'm an outlaw from the badlands

Put away shots for later, so I'm stable
Live in trees, chew on feet, watch Lost on cable
Bird flu gonna get you, made it in my stable

Looking in the mirror, mood emoji fire

I ride through the sea like a pirate
Just to flow with the water
Can't carry feelings
Like basket can't carry water
Ain't gonna tell ya
That I live strictly for the paper
Men are good, men are bad
And the war is never over

If you're from the front then you wanna survive

I stay humble cause the shit I've seen
Cause I already know there's only one me

And the water ran dry, fill it up with juice

Everything you go through at 17
Will it still count at 70?
If I'm coming from the streets then I'm getting money
But my deeds in the bank are worth plenty
I didn't choose the music but the music chose me
The art of hitting your speakers making it bleed
I've been thinking about what effects me
And the will to survive is always in me
Every glass of water grows what I be
And every glass of liquor gets me tipsy

Bullets in your store
Says ""I'm hunting for you all""

Shipping out speed boats

The stock market broke
Somewhere in Angola we're still craving for a goat
Send me a post
Yeah, send me something you wrote
School of the hard knocks
We don't like to boast
Go down the road
Their cars are rolling slow
Boys fighting laws
Got their AKs on show
Kids playing ball
They growing like they know
Wanna make that doe
Just to have something to show
Buy Tees and Gold
Bandanas and hoes
Freedom costs money and they're feeling really bored
Vitamins are low
Amphetamines high
Busting out shots
On rings and chicken pie

These seas are about to embrace us, 
on the land we get the tasers
And these waves might capsize us, 
and who the fuck is ISIS?

Murder is a martial art when she’s got murder on her mind
Drop nine murder killing machine
She killed all competition yeah she ruined this thing
And we come through killing the scene
I’ll kill you in your sleep, gonna kill you in your dreams
She’s a killa with a cold streak
I know you won’t be leaving here in one piece
So don’t get it twisted, looks are deceiving, she’s deadly
She will have your family greiving

My body is my temple, my mind I keep it zen
Oh, amen, here we go again
I'm praying for my sins, and I won't cheat again (*BLAZERS BLAZERS!)

These modern day prophets
Ain't no matter what they promise
I been the richest and the poorest
Here living in this concrete forest
I know what it is to have sex
And it ain't all about the ways that I can flex
And I try to live my life with no stress
Living in the light that's my address (*BLAZERS BLAZERS!)

If you got the key, show me where the door is
And I'm going through something, hope you notice
You might not see it on the surface
But I'm tryna live my life with a purpose (*BLAZERS BLAZERS!)

Oh, amen, ball again
My body is my temple, my mind I keep it zen
Oh, amen, here we go again
I'm praying for my sins, I hope we meet again (*BLAZERS BLAZERS!)

They say we're lustful creatures, and I'm hunting gods off till we 
Can you forgive me like Jesus, from the feeling insecure or jealous
In my baggy jeans and the headdress, on my knees begging, I'm tryna confess
Is there a certain set of things to tempt us?
Is the heat always relentless?

If you got the key, show me where the door is
And I'm going through something, hope you notice
You might not see it on the surface
But I'm tryna live my life with a purpose (*BLAZERS BLAZERS!)

Oh, amen, ball again
My body is my temple, my mind I keep it zen
Oh, amen, here we go again
I'm praying for my sins, I hope we meet again

IT TAKES A MUSCLE (PEARSON SOUND REFIX),UnKnown,UnKnown,"When everybody leaves you lonely, times are worse than sad
And the world is falling on your head
Just remember for all you know, good or bad come what may
You're gonna live tomorrow, if you don't die today
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love, yeah-eah-eah
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love
Now the fear got in me, it's cuttin' me deep
That's where it's gonna stay and never leave
Someone come lay my worry, someone come kill my pain
Someone come and put me on my feet again, yeah-yeah-yeah
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love, yeah-eah-eah
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love
We gotta love one another, that's what the good man say
But I got too much trouble going round my head
Someone come and pick up my love, take it all away
'Cause I could break down tomorrow if I don't die today
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love, yeah-eah-eah
It takes a muscle to fall in love

Hey!

Don’t bring your gun there
Don’t bother bother me
You can’t take me
You want me, pay me
You can’t 2Pac me
You can’t Biggie me
I’ve got a pikini with a bikini in Bequia
They wanna stop me
Galliano sack me
I’ll keep on coming back
Like your freaking acne
I am pro active
Brand new perspective
Back on a mac tip with matching red lipstick

Baby got back, I got front
You got a stack, I got a trunk
You got some junk, throw it in the bank
You think you get this but this ain’t what you think

Can't be stop, stop, stopped

Yeah, I'm gon' light the city up
Can't be stop, stop, stopped

Yeah, I'm gon' light the city up

I’m not on seven, I’m on eleven
The difference is kinda like Devon and Yemen
When I go Oman I say ""Yeah Man""
I open up a club and fill it strictly full of woman
My mama go to church she says ""Amen""
She also says ""Why are men teaming up with Demon?""
I love all men they all take me heaven
I can’t keep myself in check like a Mormon

Baby got back, I got front
You got a stack, I got a trunk
You got some junk, throw it in the bank
You think you get this but this ain’t what you think

Can't be stop, stop, stopped

Yeah, I'm gon' light the city up
Can't be stop, stop, stopped

Yeah, I'm gon' light the city up

Can’t be got I’m a
Cyber dog I
Fight the bots I
Free up a lot like
Chinese a chop chop
Put it in your hip hop pop
Encrypt and code it and I put it on your laptop
Bubble up poc poc
In my new bop bop
E’d up head up and I gon' beat a body up
This is immediate
We don’t need no media
Feel it, reel it, pull it
We gon' light the city up

Baby got back, I got front
You got a stack, I got a trunk
You got some junk, throw it in the bank
You think you get this but this ain’t what you think

Can't be stop, stop, stopped

Yeah, I'm gon' light the city up
Can't be stop, stop, stopped

Even Optimus Prime is an optimistic
I'm a natural chick, and my raps lipstick
Realistic to the game, unlike your magic trick
