Break Up (The OJ Song),MURS For President,2008.0,"I wanna hear your voice but I don't want you to call
I wanna see you, girl, but not see you at all
I wanna make up, but I still want to fight
I wanted to break up but it just don't feel right
""Sitting here waiting on you""

I hate you, you hate me, but still can't escape ""we""
And all the bullshit we've been going through lately
Heart broke, lovestruck
Telling y'all, ""It ain't me.""
Life without you, girl, is something that I can't see
I ain't gon' lie, say, ""I don't get lonely""
But there's only so much, I could kick it with the homies
And somebody told me that you already moved on
I broke up with you, you ain't supposed to get your groove on
Not now, at least wait a couple weeks
Got me looking like a chump with my business in the streets
Been a couple weeks, but it feel like you still there
No matter how I clean, I'm still finding your hair
Or some shit you forgot, or I'm standing in that spot
Where you came so hard, I didn't think that you would stop
But, quiet as it's kept, I know you miss me just a little
Washed my sheets when you left but still smell you on my pillow

And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of ""we""
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together cause I hate breaking up

You ain't call me last night, what you trying to be? Strong?
You'll call yourself stupid when you finally hear this song
Cause I would've took you back, I was waiting to, in fact
All you had to do was holler, girl, I would've just collapsed
And fell into a trap and started to relapse
And your ass never called so it just never happened
Now I'm thinking Jasmine, Tanya, Cheraine
Some ex's I can call that'll probably ease the pain
I tried to follow through, but I wound up calling you
Hanging up before a ring, girl, it's really all on you
But you wanna get into it, make me mad, push my buttons
Got us tripping over little stuff that don't mean nothing
I'm sick of the suffering, the fighting, the fussing
What happened to the love in the late night discussions
'Bout children, and family, the future, the plan
And now it's all over cause you couldn't understand me

And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of ""we""
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together cause I hate breaking up

Started missing you again last night
'Til I remembered all the reasons that your ass love to fight
It's like, dude
I really wanted this to work
But you, had to get your shit together first
And what's worse
I really wanted you to stay
But I needed you to leave cause we was fighting everyday
All right, not everyday, I know that's a lot on it
We was supposed to be companions
We was more like opponents
Don't this song make you wanna do it one more time?
Could I still be the only dude that's on your mind?
I'm too proud to beg, but I'm hoping that you not
I would take you back quick, girl, without a second thought
But I'm caught up in my pride and I can't make the call
Didn't want to break up, just a break, that's all
It's been a long time, I know I probably shouldn't have left you
Cause your the only woman that I wanna sleep next to

And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of ""we""
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together cause I hate breaking up
You say you're sick of me and I say I'm sick of you
But we crazy 'bout each other, girl, what we gon' do?
Said I needed you to leave, but I hate to see you go
Can't make up my mind, girl, I just don't know
I wanna make this work but I'm sick of the struggle
Girl, what I gotta do to make you realize I love you?
I ain't gon' lie, sometimes I just don't feel you
But find another man, and I just might kill you

Remember 2 Forget,"Love & Rockets, Volume 1: The Transformation",2011.0,"So, I don't know
Its like, you ever wish you had any amnesia, amnesia?
You know like you could forget whoever it was that ruined it for everyone else?
That one person, if you could just forget them, like you would have a happier life?
Huh, Remember

I keep forgetting to remember to forget
All the lies, and all the bullshit
All the reasons that we had to call it quits
Pieces to our puzzle that never seem to fit
Started out fast and ended so quick
For weeks on end I was so sick
So the next time I start to reminisce
Remind me to remember to forget

Last night I sat down to cry, over you
Then I stopped and asked myself ""Why? Over you?""
Then snapped out of it and got on with my day cause
My life been a lot better since the break up
You was only bringing me down
It was nothing but drama when I bring you around
All that attitude, so disrespectful
When I was with you my life was so stressful
Every little thing turned into an argument
We yelling till we don't even remember what started it
I wanted no part of it, I had to move on
Packed my bags headed straight to Tucson
And with you gone, now there's room for
Laughin', smilin' things I need to do more
Lets think about what we could've been
After all you put me through, I'll never be with you again


I quit you, you can't quit me
I was the one that set you free
Oh I see, you got somebody new
Do they know that you can never be true?
That they would never get to know the real you?
'Bout all the scandalous things you like to do?
Do they know you still call me and text me
Run back to me whenever things get messy?
I suggest we continue on our separate path
And quit telling me I'm the best you ever had
I knew that then, I know that now
But once you upgrade you can't go back down


Remind me, remind me, remind me
Someone remind me
Remind me, remind me, remind me
Somebody remind me",https://genius.com/Murs-remember-2-forget-lyrics
The Pain,Murs 3:16: The 9th Edition,2004.0,"The rain - rain - (rain) - on my face
In the rain - rain - to hide my pain - on my..
Hey I like to go out in the rain - rain - (rain)
On my face - in the rain - rain - to hide my pain - on my..
Hey I like to go out in the..

See I'm a single black male, dark hair, dark eyes
Long walks through a park and a lot of them lies
I'm a little bit jaded by a lot of what I see
So if you're still interested you should come get at me
Cause I'm tired of getting shot down, put down and dissed
I wanna be picked up, held tight and kissed
But things like these don't happen to dudes like me
Because I'm more Coldplay than I am Ice-T
They say that good girls love bad guys and that might be
But a bad girl with a good guy, that's unlikely
So what's a man to do to get to hold hands with you?
Do I talk shit and stand and look hard with my crew?
I don't know what to do, so I drown in my drink
It helps to numb the pain, cause when I sit and think about it
Eyes get clouded, thoughts get crowded (thoughts get clouded)
So I'mma sit right here, wait for you to talk about it
In the.. c'mon

Said she had a boyfriend, just trying to be nice
But I've heard the same lines from different women all night
Too easy let down, but don't let it get you down
Shit, that's what my boys told me, but end of the night
I was still sitting lonely, if only I could find 'em
Without all the drama, without the one-liners
Excuse me miss, hey mam, you got a man, what's ya name?
I'm in my mid-twenties so enough with the games
Simply put I think you're stunning, and what about some kids?
A couple dogs, a couple cars, a four bedroom crib?
Look, I'm not trying to jib, I'm just speaking from the heart
But we can start with a drink if you wanna play it smart
She looking at my boy who got two kids at home and
I know how it goes, here's his number telephone and
He does the girl's turf, and I know you're smelling on him
But every bitch needs a dog, so I guess that's why you want him

I try to be subtle, but even flirting got me shooked
I would never get a smile, all I got was dirty looks
And my self-esteem is low enough, I got teased growing up
And what I do, I beat 'em up, but that only made me tough
It didn't get me girls, or notes in class
Same girls who used to tell, when I would pinch their ass
But if another boy did it, then they would get gritty
So I pretended the handball was their face when I hit it
And I admit it's part the reason why I'm do em like I do
And women in my life, there has only been two
My mother being one, and the other one is done
So my philosophy on dating is; ain't no fun
Cause they come and they go, and even if they don't cum
They still have to go, girl I give the best head
But you just wouldn't know, cause you stuck up in some diddy
But even if you dissed me, I ain't mad
Go on do that yo with yo pretty as..
You looked better coming..
No wait, you looked better going than you did coming
Her ass is amazing. High five for Jesus
Keep making 'em like that
Just make 'em with half a brain so maybe they'll talk to me",https://genius.com/Murs-the-pain-lyrics
1st Love,MURS & The Misadventures of the Nova Express,2008.0,"I grew up on Wonder Years. She was Saved by the Bell
I was Boyz in tha Hood. She was ATL
Used to sell weed to her roommate, that's how we met
Old girl didn't smoke, but she had jokes on deck
No disrespect. It's just the way it was
She clowned cause I was broke and always said Cuz
I would clown her for always saying Shorty and Yall
She smiled every time I did my little Southern drawl
Calls became frequent, we'd hang out on the weekend
Started feeling like she's the one Ive been seeking
Didn't take it far. Third base at most
Never sealed the deal, but came real close
I knew that if I hit it, I would have to stay committed
And I was young, 21, man I just wasn't with it
Knew what was coming, and you can't run from it
When a feelings that strong between a man and a woman

She said she wanted more than a friendship
But I wasn't willing to bend
I said I wanted friends with benefits
But I was only trying to pretend
I didn't want you (want you), need you (need you)
Really wanna make you mine
I would never mislead you, look at how I treat you
But girl, you gotta give me some time
So the first time we did it, it was alright
But soon I was creeping to her room every night
Something like magic, I felt I had to have it
Just the right fix to kick my chick habit
You know its always better when youre lovers and close friends
It started getting deep. I kind of felt closed in
I went out and made a stupid mistake
I stopped returning calls, went on a few dates
Of course it got back to where I knew she'd be hurt
But she didn't even trip and that made me feel worse
She showed me all that love after I did her dirt
Now I'm feeling like Im the scum of the earth
She left for break, and didn't leave her number
I thought about her every single day that summer
A sucker, for trying to keep it on the under
Said next time I see her, I'mma tell her that I love her

She said she wanted more than a friendship
But I wasn't willing to bend
I said I wanted friends with benefits
But I was only trying to pretend
I didn't want you (want you), need you (need you)
Really wanna make you mine
I would never mislead you, look at how I treat you
But girl, you gotta give me some time
Woulda swore I was student the way I was waiting
For the new semester to begin
The very 
next
 day I ran up to campus
And ran into one of her friends
I made small talk; I didn't want to seem lame
Or too anxious, but when I said her name
The tears came. She started to break down
I can still see the look on her face now
Through the tears, I could hear Drunk driver
Crash, accident, there were no survivors
She trying to continue to describe it
But just couldn't take it and she ran off crying
Lying if I said I wasn't filled with regret
I cried for three hours sitting down on them steps
But even though youre gone, your memory lives on
And for all I did wrong, I dedicate this song
To my first love
This for my first love",https://genius.com/Murs-1st-love-lyrics
Bad Man!,Murs 3:16: The 9th Edition,2004.0,"Ready?
Uh-huh
A'ight...
After tonight
Don't leave your girl round me, heartbreaker for life
Ask my homeboy 9th

Got all your girlfriends thinkin' that I'm the (Bad Man!)
Never neglected you or disrespected you
Or lied to have sex, yet you say I'm the (Bad Man!)
Gave you dick, never fronted, pulled your hair when you wanted
Used to flip you on your stomach, said you wanted a (Bad Man!)
Now it's all drama, an unidentified caller
On the phone with my momma talkin' bout I'm a (Bad Man!)
How could somethin' so bad be so damn good?

All I wanted was to fuck, from the start I never lied
Now it hurts my heart to have to see you cry
Let you know from the jump, I was that type of guy
Now you all on my voice mail askin' me why
Never kissed you in public and I never held your hand
I never said I loved you so I never was your man
How can we break up when we never broke down
And committed to each other? We was fuckin' around
That's how people get hurt, and we both do dirt
Now we could put this all behind us and make things work
Or I could get behind you cause I like that skirt
Sorry 'bout that, got a one track mind
But if you say you don't wanna fuck me too, then you lying
Tryna fight it girl, shit bring your ass here
Who else can make you wet by doin' this in your ear
(See why you playin', all that bullshit you sayin')

Got all your girlfriends thinkin' that I'm the (Bad Man!)
Never neglected you or disrespected you
Or lied to have sex, yet you say I'm the (Bad Man!)
Gave you dick, never fronted, pulled your hair when you wanted
Used to flip you on your stomach, said you wanted a (Bad Man!)
Now it's all drama, an unidentified caller
On the phone with my momma talkin' bout I'm a (Bad Man!)
How could somethin' so bad be so damn good?

She got me screamin' in public, in the middle of the mall
I lightly touch her arm, what'd the bitch do?, fall
Now they call security, it's about to be drama
I would never hit a woman, I was raised by my momma
But I kinda feel bad even though I didn't do shit
Now I gotta waste time to find a new chick
Someone who understand a man's gotta be a man
I don't wanna have to lie just to get into your pants
And ain't nothin' wrong with a one night stand
That happens twice a week, plus I'm nice in the sheets
And you look like a freak, it'll be to your benefit
A nigga you can fuck, and a nigga you can kick it with
I'm sick of this phone tag text message foreplay
I like to be spontaneous, that's my forte
Let's go to my crib and have, sex in the door way
We'd talk all night if you had things your way

Got all your girlfriends thinkin' that I'm the (Bad Man!)
Never neglected you or disrespected you
Or lied to have sex, yet you say I'm the (Bad Man!)
Gave you dick, never fronted, pulled your hair when you wanted
Used to flip you on your stomach, said you wanted a (Bad Man!)
Now it's all drama, an unidentified caller
On the phone with my momma talkin' bout I'm a (Bad Man!)
How could somethin' so bad be so damn good?

She said this might make me look like a knight in shinin' armor
Great way to escape or get away from the drama
So I got a little momma, first, had to disarm her
Said she heard about us rappers, I still got to charm her
I'mma tell you what you wanna hear and make it the truth
Haven't been with a woman since I left Kamloops
Two months ago in Canada, ask my road manager
He'll tell you I'm a good guy, I wouldn't lie to you
Just because you look fly, look my bus cards are new
We'll shoot to my room, make the best out of twelve hours
We can wash that club smell out your hair in the shower
Turn down the power, lie down and make spoons
Or we can talk all night and listen to iTunes
You assume this the game that I spit to every girl
But I'm careful with my heart and who I let up in my world
(So, here's my number, call me anytime girl)

Just because I'm a musician she must think I'm a (Bad Man!)
All alone when she listens and I know what she's wishin'
But she won't pay attention cause she thinks I'm a (Bad Man!)
It's not as bad as you think, cause you had a few drinks
I'll hold you hair out the sink, you still think I'm a (Bad Man!)
I don't do this all the time, you are just that fine
Get that shit out your mind, I am not the (Bad Man!)

Everything,MURS For President,2008.0,"One, two
She was only fifteen, in love with bad R&B
She had to have vision because she saw the star in me
Encouraged me to write about the drama in my life
To most it seemed strange like something wasn't right
I used to fall a victim to them lunch room comedians
Something like an Outkast, started smokin' weed and then
I sorta fell into my own
Kinda felt at home when behind a microphone
But on the bus ride home
That didn't mean a thang
Harassed by thugs, on the corners they would hang
I got banged on
I got beat down
Carrying a golf club, walking up the street now
They respect me
They call me crazy
At least I'm not gettin' punked out on the daily
And when I look back I wouldn't change a thing at all
Where do you think I found the strength to be speakin' to y'all?

I take everything
Your hopes and your dreams and your hate and your lies
Mmm, mmm, mmm, in this life
I'll join everyone
From the old and the wise to the young as they fly
Ooh, when I die

God is love then hatin' is Satan
Zen-type patience, got me sittin' here waitin'
On the day when it's okay to love
When black men won't pretend that they are thugs
When teachers and doctors are treated like celebrities
You can get a job even if you got a felony
Check out my melody, let's live in harmony
We in this together, no man has autonomy
No man is an island, immune to the violence
This rap race is no place to raise a child in
What's wrong with smilin'? What's wrong with peace?
What's wrong with squashin' beef before they label you deceased?
Swallow your pride before you choke on your issues
I know you got family and folks that'll miss you
So don't misuse this gift you've been given
This life's but a dream you are blessed to be livin'

I take everything
Your hopes and your dreams and your hate and your lies
Mmm, mmm, mmm, in this life
I'll join everyone
From the old and the wise to the young as they fly
Ooh, when I die

And basically man, I'm just a dude who tries to do right
You know I try to make my tomorrows better than my yesterdays
Without hurting anyone else in the process
Cause if you leave the world a better place than it was when you got here, then we all win

Now, there's birth and there's death but the space in between
Is where the journey takes place and you give it all meaning
There's waitin' on us all, there's no need to pretend
No freedom in the feeling when you’re fearing the end
All good things come to it, walk, don't run to it
At times you want to end it all yourself, don't do it
Be original, be different
Be the one that stand up and shocks this system

I take everything
Your hopes and your dreams and your hate and your lies
Mmm, mmm, mmm, in this life
I'll join everyone
From the old and the wise to the young as they fly
Ooh, when I die
I take everything
Mmm, mmm, mmm, in this life
I'll join everyone
Cause all men die",https://genius.com/Murs-everything-lyrics
It’s Over,The Final Adventure,2012.0,"What up to Finn the human
What up to Jake the dog
What up to my ex, I hate it when you call
When I said goodbye, you must have thought that I was kidding
I was so serious, I wasn’t bullshitting
Did I forget to mention, there is no take backs
But now you see me happy, I know you hate that
You could be happy for me, that would be sort of strange
But hey, yay for you, I’m glad you changed
I’m sure someone else will find it real appealing
But in my life story, you chose to play the villain
No hard feelings, I wish you much success
I wish we could be friends but you’re a fucking mess
And I don’t need the stress, all I need is closure
And maybe I’ll evolve, but that’s when I get older
But now it's over, I told you to kick rocks
And keep your thirsty ass outta my inbox


This is the last time, it's over friends
Never been done before, never done again
Y'all already know how much fun it's been
So party on and we catch you on the other end
This one's for you
So party on and we catch you on the other end
Word up to Rapsody, word up to Ab-Soul
You ain't on Paid Dues? so I'm an asshole
I really wish I could put everybody on, kid
You don't like it, motherfucker get your own shit
That's what I did, and it worked for me
And now we're working on our eighth anniversary
So do you know what today is
It's the day you get up off your ass and make yourself famous
I don't owe you nothing, why you got your hand out
Why would I put food in a grown man's mouth
Ain't my fault your career didn't pan out
When I ignore you then you wanna go the Stan route
When your family outnumbers your fans
And you been trying, giving all that you can
It might be time for your ass to change plans
Homie, it's over you just don't understand that it's over

This is the last time, it's over friends
Never been done before, never done again
Y'all already know how much fun it's been
So party on and we catch you on the other end
So party on and we catch you on the other end
What up to The Beatles, what up to New Edition
The true greatest groups ever, look people listen
And if you listening, if you tuned in
It's been an epic saga, a tale of two friends
Two men with a passion for their craft
Met at North Carolina and they started on this path
They had some laughs, made a lot of cash
They would fight a little bit but they would put it in the past
As time passed, they became brothers
And they never let the game make em turn against each other
One did beats, one did rhymes and
Once it was complete, then they knew that it was time
They say that all good things must come to the end

To dinner and a movie because I really wanna be with ya

I said ""Man, you just seen me drop Leti off""
He balled up his fist acting like he 'bout to set it off
His homie rolled up, looking just like him
And just when I thought I was about to fight them (whoop!)
That's when the cops rolled up
Smelling like some sausage and coffee and donuts
But I'm happy that they saved me because it could of got crazy

Your favorite rapper gettin jacked for more than his sick flows
Home of the pornos, we mess up award shows
The weather's always warm so the women wear short clothes
Our beaches ain't the cleanest but the {​ahh}​ is the greenest
And we got the blonde bombshells and sick latinas
Then mix in the dark-skinned light-skinned sisters
Where you never have to wear your triple goose on Christmas
You can miss us with the blizzards and the winters
The hurricanes unless it's in some glasses with some actresses
Perfect frame, silicone or real it don't matter if she paid for it
Every single trend you can probably thank L.A. for it
Bandanas, facelifts, quick trips to Vegas
White t-shirt, Chuck Taylors or them K-Swiss
Poplockin, Crip walkin, chronic blunts, G-Funk
A place that everybody hate, but you gotta see once

Who never ran from anyone or sold cocaine
OGs in the city all knew his name
So here's a little story about the gang that he claimed

The hardest nigga I know, he from Okey Dog Crip
When he get up out the pen better hope he don't trip
Teriyaki or pastrami, he was always in some beef
A legend to this day, they talk about him in the streets
It's not a real hood, it's something that he made up
To piss gang-bangers off cause he never gave a fuck
He wore white Pro Wings, with pink and green strings
And dare anybody on the shore to say a thing
Seen him knock a lot of dudes out with one swing
By his side he always kept the baddest bitch you ever seen
Made his first million by the age of seventeen
Running credit card scams, never touched a triple beam
He was the king, everybody tried to trip on him
They would get confused when he Okey Dog Crip on 'em
Most of the time they would just start laughing
But they all got knocked out quick just for asking...

Where you, where you from?"" (what?)
""Where you from, homie?

Once knocked a nigga out, and he broke his own fist like this
In L.A you get hit up every day
The homie had to come up with something different to say
He like ""no matter what I say they gon' always want to fight
I'd rather get in to it over something that I like
And the one thing I love in this world above all
Is the Teriyaki burger that they make at Okey Dog""
All he needed was a cause that he could get behind
He was always down to squab cause he won every time
Ever since we was little he could fight very well
Seen him whoop a grown man and we was only 12
Kept to himself unless they bothered him first
But like I was saying at the top of this verse
He busted up his hand on a bitch nigga's head
All because he walked up to my homeboy and said...

""Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?"" (what?)
""Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?"" (what?)
""Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?""
""Okey Dog Crip, and y'all don't want none"" (yep)
""Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?"" (whoop)
""Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?"" (whoop, whoop)
""Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?"" (whoop)
""Okey Dog Crip, and y'all don't want none""

The hardest nigga I know, he from Okey Dog Crip
He pulled out a chopper, told me ""Focus in on this
This can make a man brave, this could make a man a slave
And once you pull it out ain't too many standing in your way
Trigger in your hand, you gotta understand
A lot of men use arms cause they ain't got hands
The shooter is respected much less than the gladiator
If you kill a nigga then his homies gon' get at you later
You square up, win some, lose some
I need to save the day like John Witherspoon, son""
Homie's almost out after 8 to 10 years
But I'mma say something that he might hate to hear
Look, now that I'm a grown man
Thirty something years and I'm out here tryna throw hands
It's green light for me to blast a motherfucker
So you better think twice before you ask a motherfucker

""Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?"" (what?)
""Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?"" (what?)
""Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?""
""Okey Dog Crip, and y'all don't want none"" (yep)
""Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?"" (whoop)
""Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?"" (whoop, whoop)
""Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?"" (whoop)

D.S.W.G. (Dark Skinned White Girls),Murray’s Revenge,2006.0,"She got that mocha-chino baby on the back of the bus
If you close your eyes and listen she would be one of us
Never did trust, her family at home
So she kicked it in the hood, raised her self on her own
She talk with that tone, but she white to the bone
You would swear she was black if you spoke on the phone
Some say its overgrown, but she don't give a damn
All the black girls think that she want they man
But it's not your fault that they attracted to you
That you blessed and got as much back as you do
Most white boys say that you're way too thick
And some brothers might say, you're the number one pick
You say , girl...Roll your eyes twist your neck
But it comes from the soul you don't mean no disrespect
And even when they check you, you just keep it movin'
Cuz in your heart you feel you ain't got nothing to be provin'

Whether chocolate or vanilla, or you're somewhere in between
A cappuccino mocha or a caramel queen
Rejected by the black, not accepted by the white world
And this is dedicated to them dark skinned white girls

Now she like The Smiths, The Cure, really into Morrisey
Heavy on the rock never fooled with the Jodeci
You would notice she was never really welcomed by the others
Hard to find a date when there was only ten brothers
In the whole damn school, and they thought she was weird
Cuz she wore her hair different, and she never joined cheer
A melancholy dolly with a Polly want-a syndrome
White step-father black daddy never been home
And when on the quad she could hear em' say
Look at how she walks, why she talk that way
But girl it's okay, your black is beautiful
No matter how you dress, or no matter what music you like
Forget what they say, you're doin' it right
No more grabbin' on your pillow as you cry through the night
Stand strong, hold your ground at any cost
And know that everyone who tries to put you down is lost


Now for you half-and-half and mixed girls, I know what the battle be
Every time you go out, it's what's your nationality
Everybody always wanna dig up in your background
You don't look _, now how does that sound
I couldn't tell you were...
Oh, is that right
Do you take it as a compliment or start up a fight
Venezuelan and Indian, Rican and Dominican
Japanese or Portuguese, quarter a Brazilian and
White and Korean, Black and Pinay
I could find out later it don't matter you're fly
It really don't make a difference to most of us guys
We just need an excuse to get close and say hi
I know they call you stuck up, you think you're too pretty
Spreadin' rumors about you, all throughout the city
So much attention, so many haters
But don't be bitter, you'll be better for it later and...",https://genius.com/Murs-dswg-dark-skinned-white-girls-lyrics
Silly Girl,Murray’s Revenge,2006.0,"You know what
Yeah the lil' stuff between your legs ain't gon' keep me
And neither is you callin' me every five minutes like you need to know what what I be doin'
I'm at where I'm at, and I'mma be where I'mma be
And that's about all you need to know
And you need to use your inside voice when you talk to me
Cause all that raisin' your voice with me in front of your friends
In the car and your cell phone it's not hot, it's not cute
It's not gettin' you anywhere, and it's about to get you fired so, calm it down

She thought that makin me wait, was the way to get me hooked
Now fellas, we all know the oldest trick in the book
What you do you wait around, waitin' 'til she breaks down
One day at the crib, she gon' let you break ground
Soon found out she was so real with it
One year, no love man who would deal with it
Me I fell for it, romancin', financin'
A couple years back I woulda told you there was no chance in hell
But oh well, here I was
That's how it be when you're fallin' in, umm
I wouldn't say that; maybe it was
Them trips to the gentlemen's club - oh well
That got me feelin I was givin but I wasn’t given back
Man that story 'bout that cow and that milk ain't a fact
Cause if you wait too long, the milk goes sour
And I like my love hot, no more cold showers so

Silly little girl, simple little girl
You didn't want me when I wanted you, you
I'm on to other girls, I don't want you in my world
And there's not a single thing that you can do, do
You're playin on my phone and you won't leave me alone
I think it's finally time for you to get a clue, clue
You told all your friends about the time we used to spend
Now I'm 'bout to run it all throughout your crew, crew

Ooh I called Pam, you know the one that always liked me
You tried to tell her that I had the drip, just to spite me
But she didn't buy it, guess what, was down to try it
And we did a lot more than kiss, I can't deny it
I took her to the Hyatt, tie her to the bed
And took Tasha to the Hyatt, oh yeah I went there again
And starin in my windows, is just not hot
Always thought you was a freak, never knew you liked to watch
And I'mma call the cops next time you come to my job
And my new girlfriend, she from the hood she down to squab
And when she take out them earrings, crunch time, punch time
Believe me I know, let me tell you 'bout this one time
I came home late, didn't call - wait that's not the point
She gets another fight she's goin back to the joint
So, don't waste her time we both know you can't fight
Now quit hidin' in them bushes and go home - goodnight


Yo, I knew this silly chick was diggin me
I said I had a girl, but if you keep it on the low then you can get with me
See I done switched the game up, now she ask when I'mma leave her
You know the answer last time that came up
Why you keep stressin, just keep undressin
This a headache I swear I never learned my lesson
Told myself about these undercover dealings - why
Cause these silly chicks end up always catchin feelings
And what I'm 'sposed to do
When a late night freak in the Jeep end up gettin a lil' close to you
Close to who - close to me
Nah my lil' thing on the side, this ain't how it's supposed to be
Supposed to hit it, quit it, hit it again
Chill for a while then flip it again
But she started actin crazy, I split to the end
She told the girls how I get down, now I'm hittin her friend, ha ha",https://genius.com/Murs-silly-girl-lyrics
Animal Style,"Love & Rockets, Volume 1: The Transformation",2011.0,"Fresh out of high school, glad cause he hated it
Everybody in the senior class'll call him gay but it
It never bothered him
, 
his name Johnathan
Best friend Julie, she was cool, she went to prom with him
The principal said prom was no place for a queer couple
If he showed up with a boy then it'd be real trouble
Empty threats, but what really got to him
Is that his boyfriend didn't wanna go to prom with him
Boyfriend Roderick, kept the secret closeted
Scared to come out into this world of zero tolerance
Kinda popular, played a lot of politics
Johnathan was book smart, just received a scholarship
Off to college, wanted Roderick to follow him
He see him in the halls but Rod would never acknowledge him
Away from school though, he was so affectionate
John had a good thing, no use in upsetting it
Besides in college everything would be different
Everyone is educated, no one would be tripping
, huh
He had it all figured out
Plus his parents were excited just to get him out the house
So they bought him a ticket, even bought one for Roderick
Said to leave the end of summer, they would pay for all of it
So excited on his way to work at In-N-Out
End of his shift, he drove straight up to Roderick's house
He hopped out, saw him with his crew
He walked right up, he was ready to share the news
It had been a few days, he forgot how much he missed him
So excited that he moved in and kissed him
Roderick dissed him, threw him to the floor
He said, ""you faggot! What'd you have to do that for?""
Looked at his homies, ""You know I'm not gay""
They just shook their heads, turned and walked away
(""Fuck. Fuck's wrong with you?"")
Now he's screaming at Johnathan, what the hell was wrong with him
John said, ""Okay, it's over? Let's be honest then
They never knew the real you, they not your real friends""
He drove away and vowed to never speak to him again
It had been a few weeks
Before John left for college, he thought that they should speak
Scared to do it, for fear of rejection
But either way, he knew the world would never accept him

(Dear America, when you tell gay Americans that they can't serve their country openly or marry the person that they love, you're telling that to kids too.)

Roderick was seventeen, in and out of jail since ten
Never knew his father or spent time with any other men
He started running in them circles with the hustlers
Gangbanging, dope slanging, had some loyal customers
Locked him up at a very young age
Found religion and it ended all his criminal ways
He also found his first boyfriend when he was locked up
Came home conflicted so he really didn't talk much
Felt beginnings of a double life
The chaplain back in juve used to tell him that it wasn't right
His bond with God was so strong
That was until he met John
And it felt so perfect
But suffering eternal damnation, was it worth it?
He still had to see him
It had been two years, he knew that he could never leave him
So he lived in fear of God's wrath
The preacher said God loves us all except fags
And that made him so mad he started packing his bags
Said he'd run away with John until it went all bad


The big incident
John slipped in front of his friends and started kissing him
Now everything was different
He shut him out, never thought about forgiving him
Until he got that text
John wanted to meet up the day after next
They met at In-N-Out, on his dinner break
But he was so mad that he couldn't look him in the face
Soon as he spoke, they both started crying
Said he missed him so much, he felt like he was dying
John said, ""I can't describe how much I missed you""
That's when Roderick pulled his pistol
He shot him right between the eyes
Then turned it on hisself cause he refused to live a lie
Suicide was against his beliefs
But knew it was the only way they'd ever find peace",https://genius.com/Murs-animal-style-lyrics
Eazy-E,"Love & Rockets, Volume 1: The Transformation",2011.0,"And if I hit the switch I can make the assssss drop

Growing up they said the west had no lyricists
Can you imagine growing up hearing this?
So I took my hip hop serious
Years later now the pen game is Furious
Styles from a Boy-N-The-Hood
Post G-Funk Era trying to do good
What about Quik, and Dub C
King Tee, Eiht, Kurupt and Suga Free
They Master Ceremonies and they Move Crowds
See, I'm from the west coast and I'm so proud
This where crack started and yeah we act retarded
Niggas be scrapping in the parking lot at Target
It's fucked up, but it's kind of funny
And we be set tripping and it ain't over money
Red and blue is like Muslim and Jew
And I don't ever think they'll stop but I'm praying that they do
In '92 we had a truce for a little bit
Until they started back tripping over little shit
I was young making sense of this crazy world
And my childhood hero had a Jheri curl

When Eazy-E was playing on the radio
I knew exactly how my day would go
California sunshine coming in
Singing gangsta rap with all my friends
The origins of California hip hop
Where you can pop, lock, or you can get shot
Black, white, latin, asian, living in this melting pot
Throw up your W and it don't stop

My cousins up north they hit me to the game
It's all California, but we ain't all the same
To G's up there they had a different swag
They was grinding out the trunk getting hella cash
B-Legit man, E-40 dude
Del and Heiro got their start up under Cube
Love to my Bay Area fam
'93 Til Infinity is still the jam
And over 20 year later
They still rocking for the stoners and the skaters
I used to watch videos by Plan B
Dream about hitting up the Hubba Ledge or EMB
Shout out to Tommy G and Ray Barbee
Cause there ain't no party like a Bay Party
When Mac Dre died, I was brokenhearted
Show some love to where the independent game started
The 6-1-9, shout out to Jay-O
Masters Of The Universe, doing it in DayGo
I came up on drive-bys and chronic smoke
And it was hella crazy, but it was kinda dope

When Eazy-E was playing on the radio
I knew exactly how my day would go
California sunshine coming in
Singing gangsta rap with all my friends
The origins of California hip hop
Where you can pop, lock, or you can get shot
Black, white, latin, asian, living in this melting pot
Throw up your W and it don't stop

It goes 6 In The Morning, police at my door
Fresh Adidas squeak across the bathroom floor
Ice was telling stories about an inner city war
He gave the world a taste and they came back for more
They said ""bitch"" and Fuck Tha Police
They said they'd never make a million talking about the streets
They said they'd never play it on the radio
Now all you hear is gangsta rap everyday and yo
We motherfucking pioneers
All of that shit started out right here
We didn't make it up but we made it famous
Then we spread it worldwide, go ahead and blame us
Growing up, gang culture taught us loyalty
And that everyone is equal, no royalty
So there's never been a king of the west coast
We got some OG's and we respect those
But anyone can get it if there's beef
And nobody's undefeated in the streets
I grew up on palm trees and gangsta rap
So pardon me, but I'm thankful for that
You know
Yeah, and I want to take a minute to give a shout out to pioneers who started this shit. Rest in peace Mixmaster Spade, Toddy Tee, Greg Mack, K-Day, KMEL Too $hort, Freddie B, Rappin' Ron & Diddley Dog. The Luniz, Shock G, Saafir, Casual, Del, Hobo Junction, I know I'm missing a gang of people, Kid Frost, Lighter Shade of Brown, Psycho Realm. Everybody that's a part of this great culture. Freestyle Fellowship, Cypress Hill, B-Real, Tha Dogg Pound. Did I miss anybody? I probably missed a gang of niggas man. Rest in peace to Eazy-E, Eric Wright. We out. West side

The Science,MURS For President,2008.0,"So I'm at the barbershop
And we talking about this new generation of hip-hop
And how, how lost you all are, man
But y'all have no science
So here you go

The systematic knowledge of the physical world
Gained through observation and experimentation
Usually beginning with a hypothesis
Or what some may call an estimation
Record your results from a series of tests
And what you're left with is a theory at best
Now let me give my hypothesis, an educated guess
On why my people on the whole seem to be such a mess
Genocide: the deliberate extermination
Of a race, culture, or an entire nation
Centuries ago they brought us here on a boat
Enslaved us, beat us, til our spirit was broke
Then they gave us freedom and a little bit of hope
Then they killed our leaders and they gave us dope (crack)
From the C.I.A. by way of Nicaragua
Shipped to Rick Ross, he’s the black Godfather
Now Oscar Blandón was his known supplier
He snitched on Rick so that he could retire
Ratted on Ricky so he got out quickly
Now this is where the situation gets a little sticky
Not a citizen of the U.S.A
He got released and got hired by the D.E.A
Then he got his green card from the I.N.S
But that should’ve never happened due to previous arrests
See our government seems to think that there is a difference
Between powdered cocaine and crack, for instance
You get five years for five grams of crack
But in the powdered form you have a hundred times that
Now who has the rock, and who has the powder?
Who’s the oppressed and who has the power?
They want you to fail so you wind up in jail
You know how much they make while you sittin in that cell?
Billions of dollars for inmate facilities
You sell yourself back into slavery willingly
It's not black and white, it’s so much more
It’s the rich stayin rich and the poor stayin poor
The poor white’s meth, the poor black’s crack
It’s not about race and once you realize that
We as a nation are free to move on
And become one people, a movement, strong

Droppin this science
Murs is a scientist
Droppin this science while they drop bombs

Now black people weren't the first to be enslaved
We were just the first to be treated this way
No education, you were killed if you could read
So you hid your intellect if you wanted to succeed
And what happens to a lie when you livin' it
You lose sight of who you are and start forgettin' it
So many of us to this day act ignorant
A mere shadow of our form of magnificence
Welfare: no independence
We become victims dependin' on the system
Looking for a handout waiting on some help
Dwelling on the past feeling sorry for your self
But you do what you can to make it out the trap
And that right there is the origin of rap
It wasn't always played on every radio station
It was us makin the best out of a bad situation
Inner city schools stopped teaching us instruments
We took turntables and started flippin' it
Stole electricity from the street lights
Plugged it into a system and made the beat hype
There was a mic but MC's weren't rulin'
It was more 'bout what the DJ was doin'
He say a few words (GO, GO) to keep the party movin'
The B-boys dancin' to the breaks and the grooves
And the break was the part where the record broke down
Where it was just a drum and a couple of sounds
You had two records you could go back and forth
To keep the groove goin' cause the break was so short
Now if that ain't' science I don't know what is
The ingenuity of these young black kids
The Bronx New York, Sedgwick & Cedar
Kool Herc earth hip-hop true believers
(Theory) Adversity produces opportunity
Anythings accomplished through strength and unity
The fate of the world is in the hip-hop community
The revolution's here and now with you and me",https://genius.com/Murs-the-science-lyrics
I Miss Mikey,Have A Nice Life,2015.0,"Days going by, I'm losing friends
You never know when it's gon' end
Some in the pen, some underground
Souls that are lost, hope they are found
If heaven's a place, I hope that they're there
Wherever they are, they know that I care
It's coming for me, so I get prepared
Look in my eyes, the fear isn't there
Cause I been aware, I live in the shadows
The valley of death, where I do my battle
One day Imma lose and then I'll be gone
I'm making these songs, so that I live on

Death is like, it's a crazy thing and I'm gonna talk about it
And  my mom, she...
She feared for me and my brothers because we seen more death that she's seen in her sixty-something years...

I miss Mikey cause, that's the way it is
You start to lose your friends and you don't wanna live
You gotta give it time, and the pain will pass
I miss Walker and Camu and the homie Poo
In the days past and days to come
You got to live your life and make each day your favorite one
In the days past and days to come
You got to live your life

You're put on this Earth for however long
It favors the weak and never the strong
They say it's a game, so I play along
Some say I'm king, some say a pawn
Live from the soul to the break of dawn
You never know the day you'll be gone
No matter the odds, I'm taking 'em on
Some say I'm right, some say I'm wrong
Wanna escape the path that you're on?
Erasing the pain by waving a wand
Some roll a J, some hit the bong
I let the beat play, then I make a song

Like standing at the wake or a repass
You know, niggas is smoking and drinking and all feeling the same pain
And we come from a culture where it's not, it's not all the way legit to share your feelings, so some of us don't even know how to connect on that level, you know?

I miss Mikey cause, that's the way it is
You start to lose your friends and you don't wanna live
You gotta give it time, and the pain will pass
I miss Walker and Camu and the homie Poo
In the days past and days to come
You got to live your life and make each day your favorite one
In the days past and days to come
You got to live your life

And I feel like sometimes that's the even, like the main, the reason that I got, I got married, is because I wanted to have the homies in, in dress-up for something that wasn't a funeral for once, 'cuz the only time we wear these fucking clothes and these fucking shoes and these shirts and these ties is, shit, is when when motherfuckers get put in the ground. Or for a court day, where a motherfucker get hit with numbers. Like, what the fuck man? You know? And then through all this shit, that's all, you know, death is a normal point, like everybody goes through that shit. Like on top of the fucking police fucking with you, on top of bitches ass niggas fucking with you, on top of,  you know what I'm sayin', your pops not being there or someplaces your mom and your father not being there and they throw it all on you.

Some of them be on Friendster tryna find a new wife
And still hit the block and slang rocks at night
But you could be dead wrong with your pockets right
Contrary to what the legendary B.I.G. had to say
You don't have to sell drugs or make the NBA
It's easy to get a grant and get an MBA
To achieve one goal there's more than one way

Cause he listens to Pac and his adrenaline doubles
Now I ain't got problems with you being yourself
But when you front and use the N word, it just don't help
I might not trip, and your friends'll laugh at you
But I know some real niggas that'll straight up slap you
Now you could be down, but let's act growed up
Cause we ain't the same color when police show up
My culture's not a trend, being Black is not in
But for you it's just a phase you're gonna have to transcend
While even if I tried, I could never blend in
To society's mainstream, American dream
Yeah, it's all one love, but remember one thing
This music is my life, not a cultural fling
It's an expression of the soul when we dance and sing
And you are blessed to have a chance to even glance the scene

Man I do the same music, they stop coming to shows
It's like they scared of the white boys in the front row
First I was like ""so?"" I'mma get my dough
But the numbers kept falling as my fan base would grow
And now I'm concerned so I gotta speak up
First the money was the only thing shutting me up
But now I don't care, don't support me, get mad
Why wouldn't you abort me, my own people have
I feel I should have the scans white rappers have
It's sad but that's the way it is
What's the reason that my album doesn't sell like his?
And don't front like you don't why the hell that is
It's because he's white, you can relate to his face
Through the years you've been taught that Black is unsafe
Plus it's only natural for your own to be embraced
Conscious or subconscious you can't say that ain't the case
Only reason it took so long to take place
Was up until now your only choice was 3rd Bass
Or others like Ice, wasn't really that tight
Now you got some white dudes who can truly rock the mic
You relate to their stories cause you share that past
Question is, why would you listen to MURS' Black ass?
I asked myself for a while but now I finally get it
Good music transcends all physical limits
It's more than something that you hear, it's something that you feel
When the author and experience and passion is real
Used to feel I should be silent, I was scared to do this song
But I want everyone aware of what is going on
Yes it is jazz and yes it is the blues
And yes it is the exact same way they did rock
But I refuse to watch the same thing happen to hip-hop
I refuse to watch that bullshit...",https://genius.com/Murs-and-this-is-for-lyrics
Walk Like A Woman,The Final Adventure,2012.0,"It all started with my very first Playboy
My stepfather snatched it away, say boy
Too late, it’s imprinted on my DNA
The next twenty years I’m out chasing T&A
The female figure had me infatuated
Didn’t quit being a virgin until I graduated
Got an older woman, she was a good teacher
Completely crazy bout the academy, your creatures
Chicks, broad, dames are the feminine synonyms
I couldn’t think straight homie, I was so into them
I can’t be the only one who used to sneak off
Grabbed the Target ad and hit the bathroom to beat off
Okay maybe I’m a bit off
It just didn’t take much for me to get off
Hanes Her Way, 
Janet Jackson videos
Patti LaBelle’s legs on Arsenio
Really though, it wasn’t all physical
They gotta be intelligent, confident and original
Someone to laugh with, someone to chill with
I never had sex with a chick I couldn’t build with
Never could cheat, never was pimping
Never was a player, just a big fan of women
Always tried to be honest so it wouldn’t get ugly
They were so lovey, used to study my fuck buddies
I wanted to buy em all Gucci and pearls
Honestly I was the biggest girl groupie in the world
I loved women but not like all guys
Take one look and I could tell a chick her bra size
The time of the month, I already know if she’s the
Type of girl that got a light or heavy flow
Wearing clothes or completely undressed
I love em all, I’m completely obsessed

But I’m so glad that you have found your dream
Oh I’m so glad that you would get a dream

When we first started dating I told you you were one of six
I was out there dating all kind of different chicks
Porn stars, prostitutes and twenty year olds
I was whiling out, not using any control
Self-control, birth control, I never took it personal
And if I got back with my ex you’d be the first to know
Of course she was awaiting, you was dating other people
We will be impatient like I’ll see you when I see you
And I got back with her and you back with him
And of course, me and her, we broke up again
Brought it to an end she was never no more
No more break-up song and no back and forth
But you were unsure so you tried to see us both
You lied to me and that’s what hurt me most
But instead of being mad I just took the blame
None of this had to happen if I wasn’t playing games
So we started over with a clean slate
Brand new knick, brand new wait
I forgot to tell her that we met on Myspace
And now you’re the reason there’s a smile on my face

And I’m so glad that I found you
Take my hand, let me put my arms around you
I’m so glad that I found you when I did
You changed me and gave me new reasons to live
I’m so glad that we found each other
My girl, best friend, then became my lover
I’m so glad that I finally found the one
So I locked you down, now there's nowhere to run

My heart is a yearning for you
Let me inside your love
My heart is a yearning for you
Let me inside your love

And she’s a hell of a lady
Always held me down, never came at me crazy
So I told myself, you mess this up she’ll find someone else
Call my Moms, it was time to make this official
Make this girl mine and she didn’t want a diamond ring
My baby, she was fly, she was into different kind of things
My birthstone was the white gold
A small price to pay cause the woman made my life whole
Ceremony in the wild west
She wore a white 
Jesse Johnson
 dress
Me an astronaut suit and some custom made single blend cowboy boots
Played bingo and danced all night
I swear to y'all, it was the greatest day of my life",https://genius.com/Murs-walk-like-a-woman-lyrics
No More Control,Have A Nice Life,2015.0,"Jogging through the junkyard, kicking the can
Never would I think I had the world in my hand
17 times, circumnavigate the globe
A traveler’s tradition, my religion is the road
Broke the mold, explored all the options
The quickest way to curate the cash, so I clocked in
On the job, no training wheels
Told my mama I'mma make it cause I say I will
Til the wheels fall off
Yes yes, y’all, 'till the beat it don’t stop
Between a rock and a hard place
Came up out the ghetto with my boys, no Scarface
But is my mind playing tricks?
If the world is really mine how I ain’t got shit?
Still they stop and they frisk
But it’s never gonna change till we stop and resist

Listen, listen, if you want it up
Till the sun is up, then you’re one of us
So listen, listen, and start letting go
If we’ve had enough, we don’t give a fuck
No more control, no no more
No more control, no no more
(Control, control, control, control)

Welcome to the world of drug dealers
Comic books, white girls, and real niggas
Skateboards, bandannas, and malt liquor
Japanese cartoons and straight killers
They tell us get out the ghetto and get rich
But when you really a rebel you don’t fit
We all tryna find our niche
Got to grab it by the throat and make the world your bitch
It’s the American way
Plug into the drive and let the narrative play
We obsessed with nothing but the best shit
Do it on your own or be a drone with a death wish
Defy definition, repress repetition
Get money, get high, get sex, the addiction
The depression, the stress, the affliction
Get ready, get set, go, we on a mission

Listen, listen, if you want it up
Till the sun is up, then you’re one of us
So listen, listen, and start letting go
If we’ve had enough, we don’t give a fuck
No more control, no no more
No more control, no no more
(Control, control, control, control)

They had a rally for police brutality up at the park
But when we killing ourselves don’t nobody want to march
We got to start to take a look in the mirror
If we don’t respect ourselves then they always gone fear us
If black lives matter then black lives matter
And the color of the killer shouldn’t even be a factor
Most of these rappers ain’t equipped to lead
Cause most of these rappers illiterate, can’t read
This is educated street music for the educated street movement
It’s fucked up what the police is doing
But motherfucker look what we doing

Listen, listen, if you want it up
Till the sun is up, then you’re one of us
So listen, listen, and start letting go
If we’ve had enough, we don’t give a fuck
No more control, no no more
No more control, no no more

Have a Nice Life,Have A Nice Life,2015.0,"God is great, and I'm grateful
I could never be so hateful
I got some cute kids and a woman who is faithful
Food up on my table, my bank account is stable
Royalty check, Strange Music is the label
Music on point, so now your boy is able
To be broadcast on your satellite and cable
''Radio friendly,'' the phrase used to offend me
But now I'm getting spins cause I knew I had it in me
Industry on envy, my foes wanna friend me
Money saying spend me, the homie saying give me
And I would still be rapping if I never made a penny
Believe it when I say it when I say it make it real
If I could do it all over I would still take the deal
For that type of opportunity a lot of kids would kill
But I would never murder, I would much rather yield
I don't wanna rule the realm
I just wanna ride the storm and let God take the helm
Tell my sons to be better than their old man was
And pray to get to do the things an old man does
I don't wanna hide my gray, I don't wanna dye my hair
Cause a lot of my homies died before they got there
I carry on the legacy, our only goal to set us free
And drop another classic after 30 years of pregnancy
Classic is creation, all creation is a classic
Especially when the track is tuned in to the master
The master being love and love being light
And everyone's got opinions, we all love being right
And we love what we learn, making wrong turns in life
I earn what I earn, I ain't concerned with the hype
Fight with a open heart, love with a open mind
You gotta trust that you know when to start and where to draw the line
And when it's your time, make peace with it
Never worry bout the perfect life, let the priest live it
Give it time, let it work itself out
Meditate on the better things, never dwell in self-doubt
Sitting here waiting on you
Because if love brought us up, what's hatin' gonna do?
So you should hate a few and try to love many more
And always let karma settle any score


Give me war, I give you peace
We give the most to those who need the least
You didn't speak up when they held me down
So you should keep your mouth shut while I hold the crown
And if you helped me down when I was down trotting
You'll always be around, you'll never be forgotten
I put the fame last and I made God first
Cause that's how my brother said relationships should work
Working overtime cause I'm hoping over time
That my work will respected and the world will know that I'm
The California kid that went and did the impossible
The coast crowned me king cause I conquered every obstacle",https://genius.com/Murs-have-a-nice-life-lyrics
Melancholy,A Strange Journey Into the Unimaginable,2017.0,"Uh hi, everyone
My name is Murs, and uh
Yeah, I've had a rough couple years
But uh, you know
I guess I was depressed
I don't feel depressed anymore
Uh, you know I'm just at this point where I'm not too high
And I'm not too low, I'm just here
And that's okay
And there's a word for that
It's called 'melancholy'
Yeah

They say that happiness is a choice
Well, I guess they get to choose
But all them so-called friends with they fake ass grins
Ain't never been in my shoes
Had my back up against the wall
'Bout to jump up off the edge
Just paid for a shrink but she made me think
That the problem's all in my head
So with that said, I went solo
On my own tryna face my fears
So I stopped popping pills, and it all got real
So I started writing this right here
And it took me years to get to this point
Where I don't wanna die every day
You can't put it in your mind to be down all the time
'cause the sun go shine anyway

I been walking down this road, eyes closed
Reaching for a future that I cannot hold
Blindfold, eyes closed
Reaching for a future that I cannot hold
And it takes a toll on my soul
Said it takes a toll on my soul
Walking down this road, eyes closed
Reaching for a future that I cannot hold
Don't mean to make you feel bad
Because you think that I'm sad
No need for you to feel sorry
Bro, I'm just melancholy
Don't mean to make you feel bad
Because you think that I'm sad
No need for you to feel sorry
Bro, I'm just melancholy

Now I heard they call me crazy, I just act like I can't hear
But they ain't had it this rough or even lost as much
As I did in just one year
Have you ever had the feeling like you don't wanna die
But like, wait, still not wanna be here
That fog roll in and them days get dark
And it start getting hard for you to see clear
I know that pain too well, I swear I been through hell
If I don't smile, oh well, just worry 'bout yourself
I tell 'em leave me 'lone, I'm just in my zone
But some people can't take the hint
When my life so strange, I been through so much change
Why would I need yo' two cents?
But everybody got they ideas
On how to make my pain go away
But opinions is just like a SoundCloud page
Everybody got one these days
So you can kill the interrogation
'Cause you only wasting your time
If you mind your business then I mind mine
And everything gon' be just fine

I been walking down this road, eyes closed
Reaching for a future that I cannot hold
Blindfold, eyes closed
Reaching for a future that I cannot hold
And it takes a toll on my soul
Said it takes a toll on my soul
Walking down this road, eyes closed
Reaching for a future that I cannot hold
Don't mean to make you feel bad
Because you think that I'm sad
No need for you to feel sorry
Bro, I'm just melancholy
Don't mean to make you feel bad
Because you think that I'm sad
No need for you to feel sorry

Whatup Tho,The Final Adventure,2012.0,"Long live the Kane back,
 fuck cocaine rap
Twenty years later, niggas stuck in the same trap
I'm tryna slide through the game on a hoverboard
They still buying pork rinds from the corner store
We more advanced how we handle ours
Riding through the lane with Noa James on the handlebars
Tryna push the bigger picture
Spinach, kale and celery sticks be the elixir
Yup 9th on the mixer, the final adventure
New jam only the true fans allowed to enter
Z-U-L-U the nation here to tell you
Be careful of the media and what they tryna sell you
I'm tryna sell too, have a million followers
But never sell out just to get my dollars up
This is for all of us, lovers and the free thinkers
Rosay sippers and the green tea drinkers yeah

What's up fam, what's up bro
This is the jam, whatup though
Whatup though, whatup though
Whatup though, whatup though

There ain't no difference between, a gangbanger
And Malcolm X, the same anger
Just misdirected now neighborhoods infected
So I gotta speak the truth, by the youth I've been selected
So presidential, still rep my residential
Nine double O one nine is my credential
True artist brought rap to the museum
Might bring the Raiders back to the Coliseum
They say he's so black that it's hard to see him
So I'm smiling in my pictures, word to Morgan Freeman
This for the Glory, the Almighty
Take 50 cent and make millions, word to Chris Lighty
This rap game truly is a blessing homie
So I gotta be a blessing through my testimony
I made it through, you can make it too
Give it all you got, nothing they can take from you


For the dark skinned white girls and the silly ones
For the fly chick working at the Cinnabon
What's good with a free Dr. Pepper though
Hook it up and be a guest at my next show
I'm bugging out, tryna make the speakers throb
Shout out to everybody out there tryna keep a job
It's love first, money under that
But ain't nothing wrong with you tryna get a hundred racks
Stacking good karma like rappers stack they cash up
Tryna get to heaven with a presidential tax cut
Always keep a smart chick, with a fat butt
Long as we around, you can never say that rap sucks
Won't react to hate, on some boss shit
Tryna reach the comic books while doing crossfit
Because the body is a temple
And all these tattoos is like stained glass windows",https://genius.com/Murs-whatup-tho-lyrics
GBKW (God Bless Kanye West),Captain California,2017.0,"He's running for his life
The fucked up thing, this happens every other night
They see him comin', they like, ""wassup cuz?""
He in his uniform from Target so they sayin' he's a blood
They know he ain't bangin', they do it for entertainment
Let off a couple shots and they all start to chase him
Heart racin', 'round the corner then he trip
That's when he felt the chrome to his head and heard the click

And every day he puts his backpack on
His headphones in and he plays that song
And now he doesn't feel so alone
Walkin' out the door, he pray to God he make it home
And he just want to make it home
A young black man tryna make it on his own
All this crazy that's going on
He's just trying to survive but they saying that he's wrong

So God bless Kanye West
And every other brother of color that's under stress
They wanna make you feel like you are less
Even though you didn't make it, gotta deal with this mess
Hold your head, and always do your best
It's a long race, you gotta pace your steps
And remember that you are blessed
It's because God loves us that he puts us to the test

He's running for his life
The fucked up thing is this week it happened twice
This time the eses, bald head and tattoos
Mad 'cause he datin' they cousin and he a black dude
Hopped in they Regal, they chased him down Pico
He tried to hide in the crowd amongst the other people
High off sherm so they don't give a shit
They rolled down the window and emptied the whole clip

And every day he puts his backpack on
His headphones in and he plays that song
And now he doesn't feel so alone
Walkin' out the door, he pray to God he make it home
And he just want to make it home
A young black man tryna make it on his own
All this crazy that's going on
He's just trying to survive but they saying that he's wrong

We in the struggle where the strong kill the strong
Bodies dropping in the ghetto all night long
Can't seem to find a way for us all to get along
It's like they the new Marvin Gaye, what's goin' on?

So God bless Kanye West
And every other brother of color that's under stress
They wanna make you feel like you are less
Even though you didn't make it, gotta deal with this mess
Hold your head, and always do your best
It's a long race, you gotta pace your steps
And remember that you are blessed
It's because God loves us that he puts us to the test

He's running for his life
The fucked up thing is tonight is the black and white
They rolled up and told him, ""freeze, don't run!""
And that might sound easy, but you see he's got a gun
You know he ain't tryna be on no tough shit
But every single night he was tired of gettin' fucked with
He dropped the gun and it let off a shot
So they returned fire as he ran down the block
This is a story with three different plots
In any of the three the hero could've been shot
Who really did the shooting don't matter a whole lot
Either way a young man was gunned down on his block
And now he laying in the hospital
After all these years of dodging so many obstacles
It don't matter if I tell you who's responsible
It sucks that we're living in a world where this is possible",https://genius.com/Murs-gbkw-god-bless-kanye-west-lyrics
Funeral For A Killer,The Final Adventure,2012.0,"And who cries when a killer dies
Is it justified when tears fill your eyes
The funeral for a killer, the death of a real nigga
And who cries when a killer dies
Is it justified when tears fill your eyes
The funeral for a killer, down to ride till he dies
With his finger on the trigger

Went to the casket, and I looked in
Same type of box that our enemies got put in
And he the motherfucker put em there
Came to say goodbye to my brother, but he wasn’t there
Staring at his mother in the front row
Black dress, hair the same color as the gun smoke
Homies in the back like ""look at what they done, loc""
Can’t even talk without feeling like I’m gonna choke
We’re all mad than the mother fucker
Side chick crying, doing bad than the motherfucker
Wife just sitting there, she ain’t shed a tear
Cause he put her through so much hell when he was here
And all I’m hearing is revenge and regret
One useless emotion and the other leads to death
But you ain't see enough of that yet
Try to tell em but you can’t talk sense to the deaf
They like fuck you cuz, you ain’t even from the set
Nigga fuck you too said it under my breath
Cause we don’t need no more drama
Feeling guilty cause I still get to hug my Momma


He loved his loved ones and he loved guns
But disrespect the fam that’s when the slugs comes
He caught a couple bodies but they deserve it though
He was a righteous dude as far as murders go
And he could switch quick between day and night
You crossed the line and do what had to pay the price
And we was friends just the ninth grade
True gangsta did everything the right way
So why I feel so wrong
With the homeboy gone days feel so long
That’s why we cry when the killer dies
Tattoo tears so we could see the world with clearer eyes


And this is for the realest dude I’ve ever known
I’m never writing you another song
It’s been a while since you’ve been gone
Mother and your brother, everybody barely holding on
I ain’t gonna say that you was never wrong
If you was here, then your girls would have a better home
Mural on the block, your name set in stone
You still living cause you died as a legend, homes",https://genius.com/Murs-funeral-for-a-killer-lyrics
Walk Like a Man,Murs 3:16: The 9th Edition,2004.0,"Now I used to walk with the gun now I walk like a man
And I walk what I talk and I walk, never ran
And I never say never but I mean hardly ever
And if shootin's the solution then you're not that clever
If you don't know shit then you still know better
Human life is so precious it could never be measured
Have you ever had it loaded and cocked back the heat?
Plottin' on the next nigga while he walkin' up the street
Trigger off safety spacin an opportunity
These niggas wanna waste me it ain't nothing new to me
Soon as he walked by I was ready to bust
But he just posted up like he was waitin' on the bus
Now I'm all pumped up with a steroid trigger
Cause most of y'all are easy just some paranoid niggas
Used to walk with a gun but I never did use it
What's the point of holdin' heat if you ain't gonna shoot it?
Stupid

It was a late night sunset me and him out
Lookin' at the ladies to come up on some trim
Everybody wildin' out cause the summer's bout to end
He had the Hypnotiq 
he was mixin' with the Henn
Off that mean green laid back with the deep lean on low pro shit
That's how we rolled on the scene
Two girls lookin' probably in they late teens
But these days you can't tell but I figured what the hell
So we yell out: ""Hey girl,"" they yell back
Maybe two in the front maybe two in the back
But they had this dark tint, couldn't see through the black
We roll up on 'em ask 'em ""where the party at?""
They just start to laugh and I knew it was a trap
But I couldn't roll out cause the strip was so packed
Now I'm lookin' at this nigga in his *red* and *white* hat
Start talkin' that *blood* shit like we was on some *cuz* shit
My nigga used to bang but we ain't on no thug shit
I tried to dismantle it but you know Los Angeles
This nigga kept talkin' so my boy had to handle it
He jumped out the lac snatched the dude out his hat
I put it in park jumped out to get his back
But as I did that, I heard two shots
I turned to my right and I see my dude drop
Time stopped. Couldn't believe what I seen
Was struck by reality when the two girls screamed
I saw his killer stand up he put the gun in his jeans
Saw him wince from the pain as the heat burned his waist
Then he turned up the block; disappeared without a trace
I remember his face but what I remember most
Was when I got to my knees and I held my nigga close
And asked not to leave us in the name of Christ Jesus
But he's gone and all I got left is his blood on my sneakers

It was a year to this day that my best friend died
For weeks I sat alone in my room and cried
And I tried to pretend everything was fine
But my soul couldn't rest until vengeance was mine

The day began with me standin' at his grave with his mother
His old girlfriend, his two younger brothers
We said a few words faces covered with tears
On how we missed him so much and we wished he was here
Then his girl said a poem put some roses on his stone
And we said our goodbyes and they all went home
I thought I'd use this time for me and him to be alone
I broke out the Hen' poured a little out for him
Told him who was gettin' married, who had went to the pen
How the homie named his newborn son after him
But as the sun went down our talk came to an end
So I said a quick prayer..amen
And I shook in the lac cross the railroad tracks
And I headed up La Brea, saw the homie Isaiah
I asked him what he doin' he was way out of bounds
He said he had a freak that lived on that side of town
But he always kept the heat just in case it went down
I clown, then I rolled down my window 'bout to light a ciga-
Hey! Is that that nigga... gimme your motherfucking gun right now
Man, drive around the block and post up for a minute
I hit you on the chirp, hit the corner nigga bend it
Splendid now with vengeance in my grasp
I couldn't dream of a better day for me to catch his ass
Slippin' while he dip into the ride by himself
I slid up behind him in the shadows hella stealth
He started to break hisself I said I didn't want a dime
Do you remember what you was doin' last year about this time?
He looked into my eyes with both shock and surprise
I split his face with the Glock right before he could reply
He cried as I pressed the heat against his cheek
Then I squoze two times for the homie rest in peace

It was a year to this day that my best friend died
For weeks I sat alone in my room and cried
And I tried to pretend everything was fine
But my soul couldn't rest until vengeance was mine
It was a year to this day that my best friend died
And for weeks I sat alone in my room and cried
And I thought that's what I wanted til the problem was confronted
Now I'm haunted by remorse that I wished I hadn't done it",https://genius.com/Murs-walk-like-a-man-lyrics

We live and we die life is full of surprises
And I can't get over the fact that your gone
I try to realize your not part of my life
But I still try to fight but it just don’t seem right
Cause your not here anymore
I can still see you walking out the door
Your just a memory of what used to be
Sitting with my head between my hands
I know ill never get you back again
I never meant to hurt you never meant to make you cry
Why am I surprised?
I am who I am because of you
I’m sorry for the pain I put you though
Maybe its all just a dream
But your still a part of me
I didn’t think you do it. You'd really leave me
If I did it would be different believe me
Its easy to say baby I’ma change
The very next day it was the back to the same
Going though my phone finding new names
I said it was business, I was so lame
You saw though it and held me down
A real queen, you held that crown
You made such an impression on my life
Natural progression was you to be my wife
We talked family, we talked kids
You thought I’d clam down. I never did
I bought you home things from the rode before
Malaysia, Australia, silk form Singapore
But what I give you this time you can't get rid of
So you left me tired of this sick love
Sitting with my head between my hands
I know ill never get you back again
I never meant to hurt you never meant to make you cry
Why am I surprised?
I am who I am because of you
I’m sorry for the pain I put you though
Maybe its all just a dream
But your still a part of me
Sitting here listing to the record you bought me
Kinda blue, original copy
You changed my life put me on to so much
I miss our talks more then your touch
Such a fool to lose such a good thing
You showed me parts of my city that I never seen
Parts of myself that I never knew existed
Then I got famous; I got it twisted!
You needed me! I didn't need you
Find you a man that can do what I do for you!
I flew you to Rome I paid for this home
How you coming at me like you grown?!
Forget what I did on tour
I said I loved you. You needed more
Why you tripping? You need to understand
Sometimes a man's gotta be a man
Sitting with my head between my hands
I know ill never get you back again
I never meant to hurt you never meant to make you cry
Why am I surprised?
I am who I am because of you
I’m sorry for the pain I put you though
Maybe its all just a dream
But your still a part of me
Walk in the house late, drunk, stumbling
I pass out you would come tuck me in
Where you at? Baby I need you
I never knew all the pain this would lead to
I’m sorry I lied, tried to deceive you
You said you'd leave but I didn’t believe you
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry
I’m so sorry, I’m sorry, girl
I’m sorry I’m sorry, I’m sorry
Baby I’m sorry",https://genius.com/Murs-a-part-of-me-lyrics
Surprises,Have A Nice Life,2015.0,"I’ve seen good men turn bad, and bad men do good
Rich men with nothing and poor man with gold
Nothing surprises me no mo'
I seen players get played out and fast girls go slow
Things I thought priceless, get bought or get sold
Nothing surprises me no more

When we first met she was just a kid
She was in love with everything I did
Used to come through drink 40's at the crib
Asked her to fuck the homie and of course she did
We would slide through the city in my Benz
Acting like we was just friends
After all that time we would spend
I would hate to see her with other men
I would get a little jealous I would hit her on the celly
We would smash all night listenin to R. Kelly
Could have locked it down but I just wasn't ready
She was too young whatn't nothing you could tell me
Had to let her go to know what I had
Type the shit to make a real good girl go bad
When I look back bro I get so mad
I seen a ho become the housewife I wish I had

I’ve seen good men turn bad, and bad men do good
Rich men with nothing and poor man with gold
Nothing surprises me no mo'
I seen players get played out and fast girls go slow
Things I thought priceless, get bought or get sold
Nothing surprises me no more

''Put me on ''Paid Dues'' Big Homie!
One Shot, let the whole world know me!''
So humble when he first approached me
So I looked out like I should I'm an OG
Put him on, put them on
Nowadays niggas can't pick up phones
Hurts my heart, I ain't mad tho'
I'm glad they got on and increased their cash flow
I ain't shamed, I ain't bashful
I could drop names, I could be that asshole
After all you'd think they'd be thankful
But hoes ain't loyal and niggas ain't grateful
I ain't hateful, way too blessed
Still getting mine so I ain't stressed
It's documented in the streets and they put it in the press
That I played a big part on why it's poppin' on the West
God bless

I’ve seen good men turn bad, and bad men do good
Rich men with nothing and poor man with gold
Nothing surprises me no mo'
I seen players get played out and fast girls go slow
Things I thought priceless, get bought or get sold
Nothing surprises me no more",https://genius.com/Murs-surprises-lyrics
The Worst,Have A Nice Life,2015.0,"Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
On the side, but your main chick tried to hate?
Let me tell you a story about my situation
I got caught up with this chick from a radio station
The thirteenth caller won a ticket to my show
At night is where I saw her there in the front row
She had big D cups and a very small waist
I looked into her eyes and wondered how did she taste
She came backstage to take a flick for the 'Gram
She whispered in my ear and put my dick in her hand
She said, ""Do you have plans for later on tonight?""
I said, ""Yes ma'am, but I sort of have a wife""
She looked and said, ""I know""
I said, ""But what does that mean?""
She said, ""I know means I know how not to be seen""
My mind said no, but my body said yep
So I probably put my number in her phone before she left

You, you, you bring the worst out of me, me, me
Baby why can't you see, see, see
What the fuck is going on with us
I wish I was stronger but
You, you, you bring the worst out of me, me, me
Baby why can't you see, see, see
What the fuck is going on with us
I wish I was stronger

Now she sliding in my DMs
AM and the PM
Delete, delete, delete
'Cause my girl don't need to see them
And every time I see her
It makes me want to leave her
Caught between these two chicks
I don't know which I prefer
I told her, ""You don't know how powerful you is
With just one text you destroy all of this
My kids, my wife, my life, my home
All of this is gone with just a message from your phone
I said, ""Think we should cut this off before it all goes sour
Because no side chick should have all this power""
I rolled out of my bed and hopped into the shower
And I was at her house in less than an hour
I was such a coward, I was so confused
I let it all continue because I didn't want to choose
And that's how you lose everything you ever dreamed of
Dudes out there takes this message here from me cause

You, you, you bring the worst out of me, me, me
Baby why can't you see, see, see
What the fuck is going on with us
I wish I was stronger but
You, you, you bring the worst out of me, me, me
Baby why can't you see, see, see
What the fuck is going on with us
I wish I was stronger

Do you know how I feel about you?
(No)
No?
(No)
I love you, but I also love my wife
Can, can, can you not text me in front of my wife?
(Yes)
Do you text me in front of my wife on purpose?
(No)
No?
(No, I really don't)
Are you sure?
(No, I'm positive)
So you want me to get a divorce?
(No, no)
No?
(Absolutely not)
No?
(No)
Do you want to be with me?
(Hmm, no)

You, you, you bring the worst out of me, me, me
Baby why can't you see, see, see
What the fuck is going on with us
I wish I was stronger but
You, you, you bring the worst out of me, me, me
Baby why can't you see, see, see
What the fuck is going on with us

Happy Pillz,....The End of the Beginning,2003.0,"[Intro: Aesop Rock & 
Murs
]
Murs, you should go get us some food
Alright
This'll be the best idea
What do you want?
Aesop's getting hungry
Well what do you want?
What's on your mind, Big Murs?
Shit, the end of the world with a wife at home I pretend is my girl
Did you take your meds today?
20 milligrams worth, but I'm still so amped I can kill a damn verse
What's on your mind Aes Rock?
Shit, the roaches in the kitchen that I scream on everyday
But for some reason they don't listen
Did you take your meds today?
Yeah, 20 milligrams worth, but I'm feeling so amped I can kill a damn verse
[Verse 1: Aesop Rock & 
Murs
]
I was cooling at the park with a couple of other Jukies
Our animated glitch suspended like milk money bullies
I calculate my comfort zone by how baggy the hoodie
I calibrate pyrotechnics on how crappy the jewelry
I keep it dirty
Like what? My vibes on that old ""Ha ha ha stick 'em""
Like a 1950-something wire hanger abortion victim
99 bottles of happy pills on the wall
Take 'em down, pass 'em 'round before me and Murs eat 'em all
I was cooling at the park with a couple of other Jukies
We were paused taking on all comers like some bookies
Rookies running up with they run-of-the-mill raps, fast
Hit 'em all up with hundreds of ill slaps
The Harlem backslap just happens to be my favorite
You take it from your shoulder then you take 'em to the pavement
We don't take shit but we take our medication
And we bust them raps back to Prozac Nation

I wanna go home, I need to take my happy pills again
I wanna go home, I need to take my happy pills again
I gotta go home, I need to take my happy pills again
I wanna go home, I need to take my happy pills again
[Verse 2: Aesop Rock & 
Murs
]
Blockhead!
This beat sounds like the theme song to the
Houston 500 Marathon Fuck-Fest
Get laughed at like dude last in line tryin' to fuck, that's suspect
Who's ante's up next?
Duck I'm Buckaroo Banzai kinda big pimpin'
With less money and women, money that's slippin'
Now it's Golden Eye with sniper rifles in the temple
Holding my bludgeoned-to-deranged cups, my triple doors tucked
Flip a little wrong tough, it's the right stuff or the wrong stuff
Wrong lyrically, I'm not stuff clutch
Upon the mic because you suck
This does sound like the beat from a porno flick
Before we get off of the stage go and warn those chicks
That we comin' with that oven-fresh DiGiorno dick
I wanna fill you up, then fill you up
Bang this dick into your stomach 'til you reveal your lunch
Shove my 8 into your face, make you taste your cunt
Nah, not really, cause my girl would surely kill me
I only rest my cock where my Xbox and wheels be

I wanna go home, I need to take my happy pills again
I wanna go home, I need to take my happy pills again
I gotta go home, I need to take my happy pills again
I wanna go home, I need to take my happy pills again
[Verse 3: Aesop Rock & 
Murs
]
Okay
Murs is my pharmacist, cupboards full of Klonopin
I'm a seratonin re-uptake inhibitor, bronze US monument
See me in hell cashing in on that ""see you in hell"" thing
Decompose like Dorothy, water bucket plus witch equals melting
And I seldom seen these weeks without the medicated crust
Settle uncivil circuits that make the cut
I'll tell you what, I'mma freak the fuck out
If someone doesn't let me use their phone
Yo, Murs, I gotta go home

Aes Rock is my pharmacist, he doesn't own a farm
But he owns a gang of pills that'll help and keep me calm
If you're taking this too serious, I'm just gonna bomb
I'm just screwing with your head
Like Tim Allen do with brain surgery inside his shed
I take the same meds as Iron Mike Tyson
My life is rollin' out of control
Don't need a license to drive myself crazy
Catch me on his next album as long as Aesop pays me

I wanna go home, I need to take my happy pills again
I wanna go home, I need to take my happy pills again
I gotta go home, I need to take my happy pills again
I wanna go home, I need to take my ass to bed

Go to sleep, go to bed
Go to sleep, go to bed
Go to sleep, take yo ass to bed
Motherfucker better go to sleep

Love & Appreciate,Murray’s Revenge,2006.0,"I get the feeling girl, you need someone
Who'd love and appreciate you
I get the feeling girl, you need someone
Who'd love and appreciate you

Now I was lost, confused, caught up in my feelings
When I first started finding other women appealing
Thinking that the grass is greener on the other side
I panicked
Settlin' down so young, wasn't how I planned it
Man it seemed like yesterday we was all about each other
Never in a million years would I need another lover
But you got too familiar
Not like I didn't feel ya
But sayin' something new when we make love, would it kill ya?
Nah baby girl, that's not an excuse
Cause I probably coulda put that gym membership to use
I put on the weight, you put on the breaks
Now we both sit around with that look on our face
You wonder who I'm seein' and I wonder who you seein'
But we too afraid to ask cause we both got our demons
The reason we should try to keep this thing together
Cause we stood by each other through all types of weather


Now all that taking you for granted done stopped
And the love that we standin' on is solid as a rock
Not for nothin', but a couple months back when we fought
I couldn't live with myself thinkin' that you were lost
But now we found common ground
The crib felt empty never havin' you around
Now we getting down and the sex is full throttle
Chilling on the couch watching 'Next Top Model'
Don't wanna be nowhere else
It was time for me to put the pimp game on the shelf
You help with the bills and I help with the meals
They say that I'm whooped but it's cool I know the deal
I found a real woman that'll stay down for me
Shoulda never had doubts cause I found you early
While my homeboys search, I have what I need
And I'm glad you agree",https://genius.com/Murs-love-and-appreciate-lyrics
Pussy and Pizza,Have A Nice Life,2015.0,"Early Sunday morning got the game on
I fell in love with every girl I came on
I know that ain't right, but it ain't wrong
If I lied about it, this would be a lame song
I'm half love, and half lust
But I'm all me and never gave a mad fuck
Shout to all the homies with bad luck
Woke up in the morning all alone, I know that sucks
But today is a new day
Put on some AXE body spray and some new J's
Do what you have to do to get you laid
And bring her back to the house Vikter Duplaix
Whatever you say about yourself is what counts
And if they ain't got no good vibes, tell 'em bounce
You can be anything that you dream about
And blow kisses to your haters when you see 'em out
 (x2)
Love money, music and my mama
Stay away from douchebags and the drama
Need a check with at least 3 commas
Gimme pussy and some pizza and there won't be no problems

I'm on top of the world eating donuts
It's a motherfucking cheat day, so what
I seen a girl in yoga pants with no butt
Rappers getting money but they can't seem to grow up
Come on guys, play with the big kids
I give a fuck about the way that you whip bricks
I'm just a humble dude with a big dick
And for 5 years, married to a thick chick
But you can still send me nudes
For when I'm bored and I ain't got shit to do
I know that rap is what I'm meant to do
I love my job but I hate doing interviews
I'm luckier than most, but not as much as some
And since I moved up out the hood, I don't fuck with guns
Live in the 'burbs, I wake up and run
See the world but remember where the fuck you from

Stay away from douchebags and the drama

Gimme pussy and some pizza and there won't be no problems",https://genius.com/Murs-pussy-and-pizza-lyrics
Yesterday & Today,Murray’s Revenge,2006.0,"(Yesterday I)
(And Today I'm)
(Yesterday I)
(And Today I'm)

I ain't, I ain't, I ain't getting out of bed today
9 to 5 to survive, theres gotta be a better way
Waking up early to punch in the clock
How I look, a grown man with my lunch in a box
But my kids need socks and shoes, I'm walking through
The office, boss yelling ""Who you talkin to?""
Dont you know on the streets I woulda- nevermind
The past is the past, I gotta leave it behind
But man, back on the block I was a bonafide hustler
Spot popping off until the police rushed us
Handcuffed us, I thought I was gone
Coulda cried, thinking I'd miss my son being born
But I was blessed, beat the case, now I'm tryna reform
But these white folks, make it so hard to move on
You gotta, jump through hoops, anger management coups
But the fact I'm still standing here today is proof that...

(Yesterday I) Felt the most hated
I thought I couldn't take it, they said I couldn't make it
(And today I'm) Feelin' brand new
I got nothin' to lose, I'm bout to make moves
(Yesterday I) Felt the most hated
I thought I couldn't take it, I fought until I made it
(And today I'm) Feelin' brand new
I got nothin' to lose, get out my way move

On to the next, it was all about sex
When I first met my little baby girl Anette
Shee was standing at the bus stop, sucking on a lolli-pop
Eyes collard green, lean, thicker then a pork chop
Stop- cause I don't eat swine
But this girl was so divine that I had to make her mine
Called her phone a few times, she thought I was funny
Fell for it like a dummy, it was all for the money
Gyeah...growing up in the hood
You would think Id understand,but I never understood
Why she really came around, when my dough wasn't good
Now you could call it puppy love cause I got dogged out
Now on all my note books I got her name crossed out
But she lost out, I just lost profit, when she left me in cold
Heart broke like like my pockets and...


You know them days you just got the blues
All stressed and depressed from just watchin the news
No matter what good you do it seems you always get screwed
Got you caught up in your feelings now you off in the mood
Shake that attitude and do what you can
Set a couple goals follow through with your plans
Time waits for no man and tomorrows not promised
So if shes still alive shoot a call to your momma
Cause the fighting and the drama, its just not worth it
Nobodys perfect, ain't none of us worthless
We all got a place, and we all got a purpose
Now I'm not taking y'all to sunday service
But ya clap your hands as you stand up and work it
Like your grandmama used to do that fan down at worship
Spread it, pop it, and wave it in my face
Put your hands around your waist, let me ride to the bass like...",https://genius.com/Murs-yesterday-and-today-lyrics

Left me standin here
On this lonely street to cry

This is a Living Legends, Justice League
Definitive Jux presentation
Brought to you by 9th Wonder aaand MURS

What up though, still givin' a fuck so
Open up your changer and get ready to dump those
Disc of the dudes that be soundin' the same
They get up on TV, steady clownin' for fame
Disrespectin' ancestors that was bound in them chains
But I'm around in the game so thangs is bound to change
I'm tryin to walk that thin line between intelligence and ignorance
Have a little fun while makin' music of significance
A nemesis to niggas just bumpin' they gums
I give a fuck where you from, it's where your heart at bitch
You gon' bite, little doggy, or just bark that shit?
A slave to the rhythm, 9th spark that whip
Cause my heart can't quit, I got something to say
Cause these niggas wanna act N.W.A
Niggas With Artillery and nothin' to spray
Just some non-writing assholes with nothin' to say

That's right motherfuckas
Old salty ass, sideways ass motherfuckas
Y'all fucked up now, huh? MURS, get em

I'm from where we leaving running and we hop outta cars
Jump out and beat you down in some new All-stars
No stars and stripes, just bars and pipes
And niggas just start shootin', they too hard to fight
I'm scarred for life, and charge this mic with bars of fright
Dare any one of you frauds to bite
I'm raw as life with loss of wife and cause of strife
Spittin' sharp wit like I floss with knives
Not contrived or conceited, on your radio repeated
I'm elitist and I leave this Red Hot like Kiedis
I'm a Californicator, and a street narrator
Steady runnin' rappers down until they meet their maker
Concrete caretaker to these weak imitators, 
they a
Screech to my Slater
, piece of beef to a gator or the
Heat versus Lakers, I'mma speak to ya later
And let 9th take me out with techniques and a fader

What's wrong wit y'all man?
The fuck is y'all thinkin' bout?
Damn, them motherfuckas is lame man, get ya shit right man

I'm from the home of Double K, nothin' but trouble gang
KWS's, LTS's, OFA's
And every other crew that used to rack cans and spray
And mob the RUD before the MTA
So don't hate what I say or talk down when I bust mine
Tryin' to make some green like the Culver city bus line
I'm unsigned and hyped, dump mines on sight
This Living Legend gang, what you punks rhymin' like?
I combine with 9th, sickest with these beats
I mean so sick like he's forgettin' to eat
A hard man to take down like Michael Vick on his feet
And anybody chose me they was thinkin' defeat
I'mma spit with this heat until I get my credit
I'm a verbal martial artist like I'm signed to Shady Records
And you bitches best respect it or I will destroy you
Have your whole crew screamin' out ""You're My Boy Blue!""",https://genius.com/Murs-3-16-lyrics

(You just want me to come in and just start rapping?)
It's Murs
9th Wonder
The Final Adventure
Back together for the very last time
Let's go
And I'd like to introduce to you
The newest talent
One of my favorite emcees in the whole fuckin' world
Rap

I swim through the lane olympic style
Backstroking consoling the crowd
Murder was the case and revenge was the way to get over clouds
Above my plane, they too plain to fuck with the child
Complain we fly now, 3:16's been
And they just want more of it like Rose and Joakim
Sweet Lord, I told 'em kill the board just like a pimp
And I slapped it out the back of the Denali on shiny rims
Shotgun was barreling out like caroling house
Door to door, spread the word that I'm sick and need House
MDs that rapper shit, I'm a Jamla emcee
And all I see is mofos who ain't flowing with me
The female Christian Bale try and fail to make the climb up
Took a leap of faith without the cape and they remind us
Of heroes, glowing like the candles in the shrine does
9th's a problem, I could probably even 99 up
To 100 even problems, ain't no bitch cause
I'm not one, my coming of age just like Bar Mitzvah
My mind like the Nolans when I'm holding sixteens
Flip flows like tides, touch deeper than dreams
Intercepting, what up ??, word to the team
My underground army like Bane's underground kings
Good versus bad, it's the story of the people
Gave you Walk Like a Man, taught to fight against the evils
It ain't just the movie that moved me, or the music
It was you, and the stories of heroes that we believe in
Murf and Beef Dog, this the last adventure
And for never they'll forget like 25th December
The gift they gave the world in these fifty songs
Now salute the kings until I'm queen like 50 home
It's R to the A-P back with the cold flow
The Final Last Adventure, after this, there's no more

Five albums in like eight years
Gonna end it on a high instead of late in our careers
Love for my fans, hate from my peers
Guess that rapping 'bout that trapping ain't as great as it appears
We made our own lane for the morally sane
We try to educate as well as entertain
The cost of living foul, everybody gotta pay it
What up tho? You know I had to say it
Humble but it's known that we are the best team
The closest thing the kids got to Keith and Preem (Rest in Peace Guru!)
'Nuff respect to the voice
Rappers full of BS but at least you got a choice
The dynamic duo, the hood's favorite pastime
Murs and 9th Wonder for the very last time
The dynamic duo, the hood's favorite pastime
Murs and 9th Wonder for the very last time",https://genius.com/Murs-get-together-lyrics
Two Step,Have A Nice Life,2015.0,"I always knew life could be super short
Ever since they busted out the super sport
Brevity, levity, bitter I could never be
Young for a nigga born in the late seventies
Heavenly, my wife cause she loves me in spite
Of all the crazy shit I be saying when we fight
Shout a kite to my nigga locked up, now Reese home
Making music for the kids, bitch we grown
Put your phone down, look me in the eye
Or you can talk that shit to another guy
I swear to God I would kick you in the button fly
And jump up and down on your skull 'til you fucking die
Y'all probably want to dance so ignore me
That club life ain't ever been for me
You basic bitches just bore me
If I got to buy you a drink you can't afford me

Gun shots on a good day
No ski masks, that's the hood way
Little kids wishing that they could play
Looking for a hook or something Jay-Z would say
I got two shots left in my .22 two step
Two shots left in my .22 two step
Two shots left in my .22 two step
Two shots left in my .22 two step

Deuce-deuce in my tennis shoe
Hood nigga brought a burner to the interview
Might catch a beef on the bus home
Tell them gang-bang bullies get the fuck gone
In my zone with a brand new playlist
Walked right past my ex, didn't say shit
Then I changed my mind like, ""Ay bitch
Tell your new boyfriend he can't fake this!""
Spent my last check on some new kicks
The rest at the movies on my new chick
I got fired on some bullshit
Snitch, fuck-boy that I never should've fooled with
And I ain't ever wrote a résumé
But I had my cousin make me one yesterday
I need more hours and some better pay
Back when I was hustling that was something I would never say

Gun shots on a good day
No ski masks, that's the hood way
Little kids wishing that they could play
Looking for a hook or something Jay-Z would say
I got two shots left in my .22 two step
Two shots left in my .22 two step
Two shots left in my .22 two step
Two shots left in my .22 two step

Ten toes down nineteen seventy-nine
Southern California dummy repping heavy with mine
These motherfucking actors are not odd to a factor
Killer Reese One is a cold black bastard
No master, no father, I raise me crazy
A nigga clean it up, when I had a couple babies
Well maybe, just maybe, you get the '08 me
Fresh out the county feeling crazy
No beers in eight months feeling turnt, don't play me
I used to be a mess my nigga
Only thing could kill me was stress my nigga
Had to give that shit a rest my nigga
I just did a couple years, none left my nigga
I can't do another stretch my nigga
So it's either shut it down, or it's death my nigga

Gun shots on a good day
No ski masks, that's the hood way
Little kids wishing that they could play
Looking for a hook or something Jay-Z would say
I got two shots left in my .22 two step
Two shots left in my .22 two step

Say girl Look, I’m the man with the plan
So baby girl won’t you hold my hand
Huh yo Baby girl won’t you hold my hand
Baby girl won’t you hold my hand
Aye, c’mon

I walked in with my pimp game strong
Baby girl, you know it’s been too long
You know I miss you much, them thick lips and that big ole butt
Your boyfriend, look he know he in trouble
He ain’t nothing but my new stunt double
And I’m the man you deserve
You know these squares can’t handle your curves
I only fucked up once, you know you love me, why did you wanna front
And I won’t see her no more, she’s just a chick that I met on tour
Now you playing hard to get like you did back when we first met
You know the truth when it’s told right
So baby girl grab my hand and just hold it tight


I was in grade three, she was a grade above
An older woman, it was crazy love
Didn’t know about the birds and the bees
I had just learned my ABC’s
Up behind her at the bus stop
Rubbing on her booty with my Batman lunch box
She was my date to the sock hop
I knew my time tables, plus I knew how to pop-lock
And it wasn’t a hard call
I bought her candy plus I beat her at dodgeball
Spray some TCB, overalls, one strap, I was BBD
Now I’m walking to her place

You can roll your eyes and stomp your feet
But your mouth might put your ass out in the street
Open your mouth again, the story never ends
Talkin' to me crazy like I'm one of your friends
I can't get a word in
You should try listenin'
I should call you Tyler Perry since you always dissin' men
If you keep on raisin' hell I'm gonna get up on my cell
So when the Police come, Miss Madea Goes To Jail
Well, well, well
Look who changed they tune
I think these fights go with the cycle of the moon
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm talkin' about PMS
And if we had more sex you wouldn't be so stressed
But you like to front like that time of the month
Ain't the reason why you got your panties all in a bunch
And that's figurative and literal
The shit you pull is pitiful
For one week a month you always make my life so miserable
So, here we go gettin' loud and obnoxious
When really what you need is some Motrin and chocolate
I'm only jokin'
On the low, kinda hopin'
That comedy will calm your ass down for the moment
I wanna turn the game on
You busy with the same song
Okay, I'm not right but look, I know I ain't wrong
You ain't goin' nowhere
Put them bags down
Got your hands in my face
Oh you think you bad now?
Okay
Let's just see where that gets you
Knock yourself out cause I'm not the one to hit you
And I ain't sleepin' on the couch
My neck's still hurtin' from the last time
We gotta talk now?
C'mon, can't it wait till halftime?
It's like your favorite past time
You yell and you scream
But nothing comes between a man and his favorite team
And look
Don't make me choose cause you just might lose
Now, take your ass to the other room, turn on the news
Wait, wait wait wait wait wait
I didn't mean it like that
I'm just excited from the game
C'mon baby come back
Look I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I got a little silly
But c'mon what really arguin' about now really?
You know I love you
You know you love me
But why does it always have to get so ugly?
Don't even want to hug me because you wanna stay mad
It's the crazy game that men and women play since way back
But men never win, so forget it man I'm out
Cause I already planned on sleepin' on the couch

You know what? Know what? Forget it, forget it. I'm finished. La la la la
Where's the remote? I'm takin' the good covers too
You can't take the good-you sleepin' on the sheets
And when you get cold don't try to snug up on me on the couch
Don't try to call me back in there later either. I'm out this mother!
 
Wait a minute what? What did you say you gonna do to my Impala?
I'll jump out this car so fast and drop kick you in the medulla oblongata
Okay I see you stupid just like your momma and them
Yeah I said it
And I was just as stupid as you for stayin' with you
Cause I regret it
So let me get in clean
Cause the game don't change, people do
These little niggas jumpin' out blastin' in them skinny jean
And the last thing I need is your ass to hassle
Yeah man she told the judge I hit her
She hit herself in the head with a bag of apple
And I told her, ""I hate goin' to your spot""
Cause her daddy can't say nothin'
Unless he put that thing on his neck that make him sound like a robot
And I sound retarded right?
I can't lie
One day a butterfly landed on a skull and brought tears to my eye
Think I'm ungrateful and she would never satisfy
Keep showin', they laugh at her cause her daddy got killed
Going to the hood tryin' to pay a nigga to pee on me
And you ever been with one or two bitches
Just you and her in the car
You know she farted but she lookin' at you like you did it
She kinda dirty to us
Man, I can't stand a woman, act polite, take a shit and never give a courtesy flush
One day we went to apply to a phat loan
She said, ""Ah yes."" Changed her voice up and said
""Bitch you don't ever talk like that at home""
But that's what woman do
Just like that, ""This is my husband."" Lie
I keep tellin' you, ""Quit tellin' people that cause I ain't nothin' to you.""",https://genius.com/Murs-let-me-talk-lyrics
Lemon Juice,Captain California,2017.0,"Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

You see me tryna holla at this little dime piece
Why you gotta put your lemon juice in my game?
Why you gotta squeeze that lemon juice in my game?
Hold up, homie, why you gotta get in my way?
Interception, offsides, this is my play
Why you gotta put your lemon juice in my game?
Why you gotta squeeze that lemon juice in my game?

Now once upon a time when I was looking very fly
I saw a girl almost as dope as me, she caught my eye
But before I could walk over to this girl and say a thing
I was interrupted by this nerd Curtiss King

Now excuse me pretty lady, don't want to come at you crazy
But if he gave you his number, I think you need to erase it
Oh no, I'm not a hater like that man is not a shaver
But look at his InstaGram, he wearing Adventure Time leggings

Now if Curtiss was a Jedi, his lightsaber would be clear
That means nonexistent like his fucking rap career
Look his breath got your face melted, please make your choice
Do you want a Blake Shelton or a reject from The Voice?

Hold up, listen to his language, ain't he so damn offensive?
When I look inside your eyes, I see the loyalist missus
Do you really need a man to give you fourth and some inches?
Having your couch smelling like spoiled oil and incense

Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

Why you gotta put your lemon juice in my game?
Why you gotta squeeze that lemon juice in my game?

Girl, forget you ever met him but you don't forget my number
He be forgettin' to forget, that's a goddamn conundrum
This nigga got a Scion, but me, I got a Kia
How he gotta charge his car before he even come to see ya?

Why you yellin', high yellow ass nigga, baby, please
Ain't you tired of these flaky emo Drake wannabees?
You piss colored dish scrubber, still livin' with your mother
How you got the nerve to diss a real motherfucker?

Hold up, girl, I'm so cold I freezer burn in a sauna
And Murs so old, he got a Walkman in his pocket
He probably even went to kindergarten with your mama
Sweet Lord, I mean for real, is he even worth the problem?

Cool story, bro, but let's state facts
Curtiss, you so light-skinned, you probably hate blacks
I'm getting sidetracked, baby, it's all about you
So is it him or it's me? Come on, what you wanna do?

Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

Couple racks ain't shit but for them that's a lot
They sucking cock for a bottle of Ciroc
Let the homies run through him then it's back to the block
Niggas making drops in my momma mailbox
'Cause I'm serving everything from the pills to the rocks

316 Ways,"Love & Rockets, Volume 1: The Transformation",2011.0,"The industry is dead, long live the king
Drop from a headshot, and it didn’t feel a thing
Woke up this morning with the world in my hand
Money in my pocket, fly girl on your man
On the other hand, I could never waste time
I’m a everyday victim of a random hate crime
It’s a scandalous game when you handle in vain
Every amateur and lame wanna slander your name
Fake love, fake hugs, fake thugs, fake blood
They turn around and sell it to the public like they answers
I’m just so appalled
Especially now I got as much dough as y'all
And I ain’t never had to kill nobody, never had to sell coke
Spend it while you can, cause we all go to hell broke
This morning had the world in my hands
So I gave it to the meek but y'all wouldn’t understand

I got an army of the righteous to defend me
God on our side, so we pray for the enemy
316, 316, 316 ways to kill the industry
Got an army of the righteous to defend me
God on our side, so we pray for the enemy
316, 316, 316 ways to kill the industry

316 ways to kill a hater dead
Thou shall not kill, so I let 'em motivate instead
Two commandments, die and pay taxes
Fight to stay righteous while I’m living in this bracket
Crooks in the castles, profits in the projects
Black man president, still the world’s a hot mess
So God bless everybody trying to do right
Shock G bless me, I’ma do what I like like
Walk on water, swag on holy
Microphone blessed by the based god homie
And Ski cooked up this heater
Rising to the top over all these bottom feeders
I don’t follow, I’m the leader
I write that OG, you could keep the retweeters
So the script’s authentic
Hip-Hop needed love, so I put some God in it


And I never fired one shot
Ain't no higher power than the one that I got
No napalm necessary
The rap game's now a cemetery
And I'm dancin' on your grave
You was born a free man, but died a industry slave
These 360 deals is craze
They call it 360 cause you trapped in a maze
And I'm amazed by the ignorance
Money made y'all a bunch of million dollar idiots
You still spending money on jewels
I took my money out to Africa to build more schools
And still got enough to take a cruise with my lady friend
Pull up to your spot in a drop-top Mercedes Benz
You see you give then you get back
But I'mma be dead before you lames ever live that",https://genius.com/Murs-316-ways-lyrics

Look, tell 'em I feel the same way
Yeah, anybody hit you up

I got a thing for you baby girl
But I don't seem to fit up in your crazy world
I'm that square peg in a round hole
I know what you're family sayin' on the down low
And all your homegirls highkey hate me though
They still use my login for the HBO
Amazon, Netflix, and some mo' shit
Don't even know why you listen to them broke chicks
And get your sister 'cause she slidin' in my DMs
Sayin' we should meet up at the gym and we should be friends
Yo mama smilin' at me but that don't mean nothin'
'Cause she still invite your ex to every family function

I know your friends don't like me
Tell 'em I feel the same way (same way)
I heard your brother wanna fight me
Tell him I feel the same way (I feel the same way)
Your sister say she never date me
Tell her I feel the same way (same way)
Seem like your whole family hate me

Close your ears to the nonsense
This our channel, we creatin' all the content
And they can leave their comments underneath
But best believe it's problems when I see them in the streets
We must protect our way
Can't nobody say nothin' bad about bae
They can talk crazy but it's just talk
But if I let them phase me it's my fault
I'm secure till you show me why I shouldn't be
I ain't never had a woman be this good to me, oh
But your brother gettin' put to sleep
I can't let him slide, I got too much hood in me

Now they slander your name and your label mates reppin’ Strange
All because you found a new lane, they really hate that you took away that wing
Now we can not keep it cordial
When you treat them with respect, they treat you horrible
When I was given all I gave up it was adorable
Now when I see you, I wouldn’t give the bitch a morsel
Threaten my life on the phone talkin’ that gang spray
How come my homies lookin’ forward to havin’ a bang day?
All this hatin’ when I was young until I became great
Tellin’ you people not to feel me, I feel the same way, fuck y’all

I know your friends don't like me

I heard your brother wanna fight me

Black Adidas sandals with the stripes
Socks pulled up I'm West Coast for life
On my way to the store on the little homies bike
And I don’t break a sweat I let the young niggas fight
I done earned my stripes no you might lose your life
On any given night
Them black and white cars
Them dudes inside ain't from streets like ours
So they hop out with their guns drawn
Make us lay down on the front lawn
Knights take pawns to the holding cell
We hope we make bail by dawn
That's what really goes on
Where's Bunchy Carter man it’s been too long
Geronimo Ji Jaga hope Obama free Asata we just doing what we gotta


Shout out to Tookie Williams, shout out to T. Rodgers
Shout out to all the homies locked down with no fathers
We had a lot of problems, seen a lot of drama
Some believe in Jesus, few of us believe in karma
We got daughters, a couple baby Mamas
But love can’t compete with the power of a dollar
You see over seas is what they building Impalas
While we’re working in the streets cause a job not promised
Graduate to a key become a street scholar
Cause red and blue rags are the new blue collar
It’s hard to swallow make me wanna holla
But you came hear my voice the radio don’t bother
Could play the positive I give you knowledge
On the whole west coast there ain’t no one Black college
Wonder why we got problems
Without knowledge of yourself it's impossible to solve em


The land of smog and earthquakes
Thought I’d be dead by my twenty first birthday
Fed cars, we ride dirty because the block's hot
Kevlar under Ibaka jersey's to block shots
When you enter a city that’s never known winter
Redistrict just so they can cut us out of the Staples Center
That’s less funding for schools
Now the kids with the guns make the rules
Hunger Games, Battle Royale, Lord Of The Flies
The city's re-born while more of us die
Gentrify, genocide, everywhere the rent is high
Watch a local business die then wonder why the tensions rise
We use music as release, as a Zulu I should teach so I do it over beats
The future's in our reach find solutions to the beef
Get every shooter in the streets to ride for universal peace",https://genius.com/Murs-tale-of-two-cities-lyrics
Freak These Tales,Murs 3:16: The 9th Edition,2004.0,"First let me ask for forgiveness, since I might go to hell
But I'm addicted to these girls, the way they fuck, feel, smell
And I been around the world in and out of hotels
Now I'm finally off tour I got some stories to tell
It all started with Mel my first time doin' it
Nervous, couldn't speak, I was scared I might ruin it
Something like a pulse she knew how to take it slow
Knew one false move and I could fuck around and blow
So I went with the flow, it went better than I planned
Finally found something better than cummin' in my hand
They say you come twice the first time, now I understand
I came once inside of her, then I became a man
The next couple of times weren't quite that memorable
Tamika, Lydia must've thought I was pitiful
Bustin' after two minutes, I thought that shit was typical
That was probably why they never got back at a nigga so

Once upon a time in a land around the way
There lived a couple of girls that would never give me play
Used to wear tight shirts and short skirts everyday
Everytime I tried to hit it they say, no way
Till one fine day in this land of L.A
We finally slipped up and she let me have my way
She kinda turned me out, changed my life I must say
Cause I haven't stopped chasin' these bars to this day

Now out the city walk come at this iddibittybitch
About 4'7..hmmm..4'11 with a switch
Now lets just say, ehh I think I got it backwards
But big things do come good in small packages
As for actresses in L.A. there's so many
Let me tell you about this freak named Small Town Jenny
After bad auditions, she was guaranteed to hit me
To fuck her on a break when she was waitressing at Denny's
Now there was Umi, female emcee
We talked most of the night about the M-I-C
When it was time for us to get down to B-I-Z
She let me stick it straight in her asshole, lyrically
I love chicks on E that you meet out at these raves
They use it as an excuse for them to misbehave
I met Rachel in the corner all emotional and mushy
Put my dick on her tongue, glowstick in her pussy
And


Alright I had a dancer named Candy stripper chicks
Said she only had to dance to get her family out the fix
Fine as hell, but the bitch made me sick
Cause after datin' two months she'd still make me tip
I know a fírme mexicana by the name of Iliana
She likes me dinky's and a wife beater not pyjama's
Caught her with another dude poppin' up by her casa
But I keep her on the team just to represent la raza
Now Lesbian Liz hasn't called a lot lately
She love to live the legends but she also loves the ladies
I had to let her go, before she led me to crazy
She was lousy in the sack, laid back and hella lazy
A couple of weeks back it was all about Meretta
Straight up hood rat always beggin' me for cheddar
Had to keep her hair did and her manicure was real
But now I'm fuckin' the Korean broad that used to do her nails

The Unimaginable,A Strange Journey Into the Unimaginable,2018.0,"What if I could ice down all of my tears
Would my face be covered in diamonds from ear to ear?
Would real niggas respect me then?
Will some of these white girls wanna be more than my friend?
If I could take all of my tears and cry them into a chain
I wonder how many million more followers I'd gain
I bet my socials would be super lit
It wouldn't even matter what type of vocals that I have to spit
I could turn all this salty water that fell from my eyes into some diamond karats
Then when I cry in public I could finally do so without having someone tell me I should feel embarrassed
'Cause I'm not and I cried a whole lot
When I filed a divorce and when the homie got shot
And not one time did I laugh at Tyrese's tears
'Cause when I was separated from my son I cried every day for almost a year
And at near the end of that year span I was filled with joy
'Cause my new fiance and I were expecting a baby boy
But after 40 weeks he was born without a heartbeat
Still we chose to march forward instead of retreat

I put one foot in front of the next
Even when it seemed impossible to take the next step
I put one foot in front of the next
Even when it felt like God had his foot on my chest
I put one foot in front of the next
Even when it felt like I couldn't take another breath
I put one foot in front of the next
'Cause life is just a battle in the shadow of death

We bury Pooh, and the very same day
They called us said they wanna take my baby away
I beat the case but I didn't beat the odds
I got so many questions when I finally meet God
""Like why you make it so hard? Why you even let me try?
Why my marriage couldn't work? Why you let my baby die?""
I apologize or not, you about to hear a lot
This is not really music, it's me dealing with my thoughts
It was breathe trauma (huh), breathe trauma (huh), breathe trauma (huh), breathe
It's hard to kill the drama when the trauma won't leave
So if karma does exist I find it hard to believe
'Cause if you reap what you sow, I didn't sow these seeds
I need a Grammy for the damage, platinum plaque as a bandage
A couple healthy kids before I start to understand it
But because the fans demand it and the label said I should
I put it all into these songs and the hopes its understood

I put one foot in front of the next
Even when it seemed impossible to take the next step
I put one foot in front of the next
Even when it felt like God had his foot on my chest
I put one foot in front of the next
Even when it felt like I couldn't take another breath
I put one foot in front of the next
'Cause life is just a battle in the shadow of death

I've been crawling up the side of a mountain
Problems, they got me falling back down
Know this, all the flames I'll put em down
And know I'ma climb out

But so many fascinated with this life of crime, hah
Look, I'm dying to be different
Down to die to make a difference
Music for the movement with a message upliftin'
Went from set-trippin' to trips around the world
Opportunities are oysters, you might find a pearl
You can't be scared to take that chance
Cause if you had to knock twice then you late for the dance
You gotta, move with urgency, assert with certainty
Ask me if I'm set to serve, I say, ""Certainly""
Higher than the kite, I'm high off life

Accepted it internally, had 9th interpolate it
He chopped it up and laid it in a session and he played it
I wrote, recorded to it, now look what we created
A hot mess, I'm hot off the press
You yesterday's news, dude you just not fresh
You cold coffee, you wet cigarettes
I'm a shot of espresso and hot morning sex
Early to rise and the last to fall
The best thing for black youths since the basketball
Word to Kurtis Blow, you gotta know +The Breaks+
And if you don't know your history, I know your fate
Uh, look
Been here a minute, be around a while longer
Every rhyme invented, my style got stronger
Grayskull Power when I spray soul showers
While you battle rap cats, just lay low cowards
Oh, you mad cause I'm stylin' on you
Love songs one minute, then I'm wildin' on you
That's The Pain you gotta Love And Appreciate
I'm a Bad Man, you Silly Girls need to get it straight
Ha, small guys, denying this is my world
Your girlfriend call herself a dark-skinned white girl
Got a 9th beat
Man come on
He hear me in the sample before he even through the drum on
Run-on sentence
I'm the best, period
He pull the track out, I'll black out I'm not hearing it
Nada, nothing, the negative zone
And if you can't do better, you should let it alone, hah
I want it more than you
I want it, I want it right now
I'm wanted in forty-eight states for this style
It's sicker than syringes, streamlined with strychnine
Vegan diet, healthy heart and soul with a sick mind
Inclined to flip split minds when I spit rhymes
So go ahead kick yours, hope I don't kick mine
At 50-yard line against the wind through the uprights
While you just choke and can't win cause you uptight
Ha! He came to the game with two emcees
Back when people said you can't make beats on PCs
Internet haters, major labels be damned
Soon produced the full-blown threat for the man
Now his phone blowin' up, he can't hold it in his hand
A few months back them fools didn't understand
Now it's Mary J and Erykah, Jean Grey, etc
The name 9th Wonder and he crushin' all competitors
I cross-train, toss brain fuel on hot tracks
Burn in intelligent infernos, you got that?
I speak clear like the sample is in triplicates
Get every crooked cop in Los Angeles to handle this
Insane, inspired, insider street analyst
Questioning authority who don't know what the answer is

Dream On,"Love & Rockets, Volume 1: The Transformation",2011.0,"If you ain't dreamin', what you doing?

I dreamt of this day ever since I was a small child
And when it finally came the sky was filled with rain clouds
But when she came out, it all cleared up
That's when his boy became a man and put his fears up
I teared up as we started to say our vows
No more ""me"", it's all about ""us"" now
And the children we bring into this union
Never thought I'd live to see my dreams come true, man

Look, all I know is marriage, pops and moms did it
Grandparents did it, both stayed committed
At least I think so, but I can't go a day without dreaming
Of seeing myself married to Hip-Hop without a queen
And I refuse to be that old, lonely dude at home watching porn
Forty plus lurkin' around the college dorms
And uh, speaking of kids, I got a kid on the way
Nah I'm kidding but I dream to have 2 one day
Yeah

What's a dream without a dreamchaser chasin' it
And what's a fear if you have no fear of facin' it
It's not a dream once reality replaces it
So dream on, dream on
What's a dream without a dreamchaser chasin' it
And what's a fear if you have no fear of facin' it
It's not a dream once reality replaces it
So dream on, dream on

I've never been that dude that was dreamin' about the limelight
I just wanted to have fun and keep my rhymes tight
And then the fame came, now I'm a big name
I opened up my heart, and started spittin' game
So influential, helping you reach your potential
I hit the booth and touch truth to the instrumental
But really, what does it all mean
If you can't help others to fulfill their dreams

New Orleans is moated murder and mardi gra
Ima' show em'
Through the verses I'm flowin' through the seas that I'm sowing
Showin', provin' and doublin' to excel is just the beginning
Picture me rockin' stadiums, going platinum we winnin'
I lead an army of solders and beautiful, brilliant women
To dream as big as I do and expose the people pretending
Ha, they ain't real man
They're just real lost
It's hard times but these cowards still soft


Look, I dream I please God everyday that I'm alive
I dream that even when I'm gone my music never dies
I hate when I backslide, I pray I change that
My dreams and God's purpose
I hope they're on the same track
And I remember way back in '06
With that gun on my head, man I thought I was dead
Speaking of dead, a man's not alive just because he's breathin'
No purpose equals no freedom
Rise up

I had a dream that God looked like me
Clarence, 13 exit I was G-O-D
Can I admit, that kinda went to my head
But really who is God if he can't bring back the dead
With that said, in my dreams we live forever
No divisions of religion because we all in this together
Wake up, cause death is closer than it seems
And too many of us die before we try to live our dreams",https://genius.com/Murs-dream-on-lyrics
Dance With Me,The Final Adventure,2012.0,"From the moment that I met her, I knew that she'd be mine
We were twins, best friends, perfectly aligned
I loved Carrie Bradshaw, she loved Hennessy
We were two halves of the same energy
She was from NY, I was from LA
She said that she liked me, just not in that way
And that was okay, I win her heart through friendship
But once I had that, there was the distance
I dated 'round the way, she dated local dudes
We had something but neither of us wanted to move
We knew we'd be together, we didn't know when
But long distance love, never thought it would end
The feelings never changed, until the call came
You were engaged, I was in pain
It was such a shame, the timing it just wasn't right
So I say good luck, and then I say goodnight

We back and forth, we in and out
Is this love? What's this about?
We forth and back, we out and in
Is this love? Or we just friends?
(Back and back and forth and forth
Back and back and forth and forth
We move back, we move, forth, we move out, we move in
Now they're playing our song and we dancing again

Then there she was, and I forgot
We were in love, she took your spot
Shot through the heart, I never thought I'd feel so good
I was appreciated, I was understood
She was from my hood, we hella hit it off
I had to lose your number, she said we couldn't talk
But I keep tabs on you through mutual friends
Kinda hoping that your engagement would come to an end
And then it did, but I didn't care
You were into me, I just wasn't there
I had a girl, and I couldn't leave her
But she could tell I loved you, so I had to leave her
You and I talked, we made a deal
If this shit ever end, we would be friends still
Deep down, I always knew I'd never be complete until
I knew this thing between you and I was really real


The first time we made love it was unreal
Let's go get them rings, it was a done deal
Wonder why we wasn't doing this the whole time
We named kids, looked at cribs, the whole nine
We planned the wedding, we told our friends
They said that we were happier than we had ever been
It was exactly like I thought it'd always turn out
A future so bright eventually it burned out
And there it went, down in flames
Too many differences, too much the same
We yell and scream, we cuss and fight
Relationships need balance and we were just too much alike
Now we only talk on funerals and birthdays
Probably should've never got together in the first place
But all the dancing and messing around
Helped me finally realize when it was time to settle down",https://genius.com/Murs-dance-with-me-lyrics
Transitions Az a Ridah,....The End of the Beginning,2003.0,"I won't deny ya, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck wit me!

Me, personally, I shop illegally
All you ladies out there c'mon, cuz whatever, don't front!
Y'know you them like them ridahz! (SHOW YO LOVE!!)

(Give it up) Now I heard that heaven is a halfpipe
Well, that's only half-right
You don't have to skate vert to find your heaven on this earth
You could skate a parking lot and see it all for what it's worth
Heelflip - 12 stairs, and still recieve your share
Hardware to the wood, no risers at all
On the low life skating before the blegals got involved
Now they got platinum chains to match they rangs
Understand I'm not hatin, I'm just sayin' that is strange -
That Hosoi's locked up, Tony Hawk's got a game
Although, everything's changed, I still love it the same
Sixteen years later, still doin my thang
This go out to all my ridahz who, don't gangbang

It used to be so fun, we rode from cops at the spots
Makin' magic, wreakin' havoc in yo' local parking lots
Now let's ride, for them 15-stair noseslides
Let's ride, for the homeys pullin' airs backside
Let's ride, ol' school, Dogtown, Bert Slide
Let's ride, for every time you bailed but got back up and tried
Now I first startin skatin back in 1986 (WHOO!)
And I still can't land a motherfuckin kickflip (I know that)
I just like to ride, kickturn, carve the bowl
And my most impressive flatland trick? Ollie the road
Though I'm not outta control, it's good for my soul
To go out and test my limits - no coach, no scrimmage
One of the few sports in life that promotes independence
So this is my ode, to everyone who roll
Two trucks and four wheels, those who ride everyday
To develop more skills, and there sure ain't thang in pain
Seven plaza woodgrain, do the same trick for weeks
'til it drives you insane (AHHH-RGH!)
But when you land that trick, it's spiritual bliss (Hummmmmm....)
When the vinyl meets the asphalt
Attempted it for weeks, you've been workin yo' ASS OFF!
And it's not about a girl, or some props for your boys
You do it fo' yourself and that sense of inner joy

Now you could ride for fun, flow, am, or pro (shit, I'm a pro)
It's like underground rap - it's not about dat dough!
Although it is nice to make loot at what you love
Said by me and James Craig (Whaddup?) talkin' life over grub
Or me and G-Mo's hosted outside the club
And if they don't let you wear yo' skate shoes, then FUCK them scrubs!!
Look, I don't play ball or organized sports
Catch me at the skate park, in some boarder-type shorts
It's a quarterpipe sport, 
skate is sorta like H.O.R.S.E
And we don't fear pain, it's a door to life source
And we could make our own fun, we don't, gotta find a court
It's as plain as this, we could skate a drainage ditch!
Ride with the homeys, pull the insane and shit
That'll never get filled, but still it makes you feel
Like a hundred thousand dollas when you hear yo' boys holla (WHOOO!!!)
And this is dedicated to my skateboard scholars
It used to be so fun, we rode from cops at the spots
Makin' magic, wreakin' havoc in yo local parking lots
Now let's RIDE!!

Now on the real though, we'll take a moment
To say, ""Rest In Peace"" to all ya favorite skate spots...
Like E.M.B...Lovepark...
Moment of silence...
Rest in peace, Keenan Milton...
Keep ridin...",https://genius.com/Murs-transitions-az-a-ridah-lyrics
I Used to Luv H.E.R. (Again),Fornever,2010.0,"Yes yes, y'all, and you don't stop
Yes yes, y'all, and you don't stop
Yes yes, y'all, and it don't stop
Well I (still love her)

I met this girl, when I was ten years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She was old school, when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular, not a church girl she was secular
Not about the money, those studs was mic checking her
But I respected her, she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas, had did her in the park
But she was there for me, and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
And just cool out, cool out and listen to her
Sitting on a bone, wishing that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be
Because we related, physically and mentally
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around
She was fresh yo, when she was underground
Original, pure untampered and down sister
Boy I tell ya, I miss her

Yes yes, y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat y'all, and you don't stop
Yes yes, y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat y'all, and you don't stop
Yes yes, y'all, and you don't stop
Well I (still love her)

Now periodically I would see
Old girl at the clubs, and at the house parties
She didn't have a body but she started getting thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became afrocentric
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids beads medallions
She was on that tip about, stopping the violence
About my people she was teaching me
Not preaching to me but speaking to me
In a method that was leisurely, so easily I approached
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
We met up, on the West coast, and that was cool
Cause I was in the streets smoking weed and ditching school
Picked up a bandanna, she started doing things another way
She got a lot of money in L.A
Late 80's economics had the West going wild
Circumstances forced her to change up her style
She said, afrocentricity, was good to have
But it wasn't representing what was popping on the ave
See, black people were still dancing like it was all good
She had to put it down for the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her, she was becoming well rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just having fun, not worried about anyone
And you could tell, by how her titties hung

Yes yes, y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
Yes yes, y'all, and you don't stop
Murs and 9th man, we gotta be the sure shot
Yes yes, y'all, and it don't stop
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
Yes yes, y'all, and it don't stop
Well I (still love)

Now, I might've failed to mention that this chick was creative
But once the man got to her he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy
Now she's common in commercials, she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs rocking jeans that's extra skinny
And on some dumb shit, when she comes to the city
Talking about popping bottles with models and all the strippers
Now she's a baller tryna see who's the richest
Had it all up with 808's and heartbreaks
Now she's too pretty to be digging in the crates
Stressing how wealthy and rich she is
She was richer in spirit, before she
Got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it
But I'm committed, it's just so many niggas hit it
That she's just not the same letting all these groupies do her
And make it rain on her, and try to auto-tune her
But I'mma take her back hoping that the shit'll stop
Cause who I'm talking bout y'all is hip-hop
I say she's just not the same letting all these groupies do her
And make it rain on her, and try to auto-tune her
But I'mma take her back hoping that the shit'll stop
Cause I (still love)


Yes yes, yes, woo!
Murs and beefgal, beef and Mursgal
Murs and beefgal, in the house
I said the hot dogs, is extra crispy
The hot dogs, is extra crispy, the hot dogs, is extra crispy
And if you don't cook the shit on a grill, nigga miss me",https://genius.com/Murs-i-used-to-luv-her-again-lyrics
The Problem Is...,Fornever,2010.0,"The problem is at the end of the day
No good things come my way
Feelin' some kind of way
I'll hustle every day
Can you tell me what the problem is?
What the problem is
What the problem is
Wanna know what the problem is
Can you tell me what the problem is?
 
The problem is we all out for self
In a world that's consumed by greed and wealth
It's a dog-eat-dog and we cannibals for capital
The will to survive in an animal is natural
But the desire to rule
In the pursuit of pure power is the path of the fool
We chase crown till we laying face down
Our worldly possessions keep weighing us down
It rain clouds, I move like a quiet storm
No shroud, stand proud, why should I conform?
Beyond the norm I exceed the hype
Beyond all the bullshit and the stereotypes
Throw this in your stereo, this is my life
When a day's so dark you would swear it was night
9th came with the beat to help me carry the light
So you can stand your ground whatever the fight
You work for yours like I work for mine
On some P. Rod shit, got a perfect grind
What's next from the west like I'm first in line
From the coast that's known for the surf and shine
Write rhymes like I'm trying to save the Earth in time
Before my girl get big and give birth to mine
I encourage you to live, put the worst behind
Never worry about the past, it ain't worth your time
 
The problem is at the end of the day
No good things come our way
We need some kind of way

Yeah, Sick Jacken, Psycho Realm baby
Let me start with what I know and let me put it in this flow
We got all the goods we need but got no money to grow
Hood got all the coke and weed but got no profit to show
Junkies got a tin of speed but their brain is moving slow
Education at an all-time low
, still catch an all-time high
Off the kush, Dr. Greenthumb grow
I ain't preaching, I'm just giving you a real twenty four
It's a cold world these streets don't feel anymore
There's no way of tellin'
What turn rebelling streets to three time felons
The people's government, the big time villains
Rob us blind, steal it, just the way it is
Take you for a gang of loot, but twenty dollars got you high and slankin'
Now tell me why's that, they blame the lies in rap
But what about the media bullshit? They disguising that
How we got access to ammo and any size of gat
But we can't get a decent school for us to knowledge at
It's called applied malice
They know they turn us into crime addicts
On the block chasing superficial status
Now do the mathematics
How many of us die in war
On the street or for oil, who's keeping score?
The same cops you pay to protect and serve us
And the country turns its back even though you fought for it in service
When it comes to my life it's never one problem
You never know about it till you walk the shoes that I'm in

The problem is at the end of the day
No good things come my way
Feelin' some kind of way

I'm 'bout to light it up like it's Independence Day
I do it underground, that's the independent way
I got a dinner date, I'm ten minutes late
With this chick that I met up on the internate
I mean the internet, I mean that fucking app
I mean a meth head, I met her in the fucking trap (huh?)
No, what the fuck is that?
I met her at a show (oh)
I'm like Jeezy, selling tickets like it's fucking snow
Or like I'm Yeezy, selling Yeezys, I'll be Goddamned
You gotta buy these VIP tickets, understand?
I mean a stream is just a dream unless you're front row
A million views, we lookin' good, but no dough
I'm in the booth whippin' merch like I'm in the kitchen

And counting so much money that my fingertips got papercuts
You play and talk to me, you sweet as lemonade or punch
Caped Crusader Captain saved a slut, I met your lady once
We fucked and now it turned into a weekly visit
Got her hooked like I was deep sea fishing
And she mean business, she says she love to ride it all night
I really get head and she got suction like a Dyson Upright
I seen the sunlight, woke up and play some Maxwell
She open wide and sat still
I fucked her throat and filmed it, now that's what I call a gag reel
Again and again we win, while all you do is catch L's
My father ain't a farmer but his son became a cash cow
Revolver's on as fuck if you a boxer or a black belt
Should've packed, yeah
Go back on my double time shit and I bet you I spazz out

So Close So Far,A Strange Journey Into the Unimaginable,2018.0,"Why would i hold a grudge against you
Or even pretend to I know it hurts your feelings
But its not like i meant to
Why would I offend you your the one that i'm in to
A queen so complex a king so simple
Two different types of affection
Life stay pulling us in different directions
Share the same roof but we losing affection
Saying Wi-Fi but we lacking that connection
We make up and keep it going
Every now and then we gotta reset the modem
Best friends still need to check in
And when i don't ask you about your day that's disrespecting
Truly neglecting playing Destiny 2
And its for you that i was destined
Waiting on tomorrow but tomorrow is today
And when tomorrow comes your already too far away

Feel so close, still so far apart
Coming real close, it might all fall apart
Cuz love takes work, that's on both of our parts
And when that love works its like a work of art

There she go there she go watch her shine
Its like god made a light that's all mine
I see you everyday but i don't tell you all the time
Sometimes you need distance to distinguish to divine
You kinda need that perspective
Our love is too pure for contrceptives
Remember when i text you that shit
Two week later you was pregnant as shit
Its a trip its been ten years
The same people with the same faults and same fears
But still i bring tears to your eyes
I should know you well enough that i should never make you cry
And sometimes it gets so bad you should know me well enough
That you should never make me mad
Its sad that when we give each other the blues
But as long as we fighting for love we never lose

Feel so close, still so far apart
Coming real close, it might all fall apart
Cuz love takes work, that's on both of our parts
And when that love works its like a work of art

So close, so far
Sometimes we can get real close to falling apart

Murs316

She had the fattest ass and a phone full of niggas' names
Small town chicks, yeah they say they run the biggest games
Met her on IG, she liked a couple of my pics
Next thing you know, I was Skyping with this chick
She said ""I'm not the type of girl who shows off her tits
But you can watch my face while I play with my clit"", ooh
Couple of them sessions earned her a plane ticket
Probably the flyest girl that had ever came to kick it
We went from LAX straight to the Grand Lux, then
Back to my crib, she pulled out some handcuffs
A little disappointed cause she wore a padded bra
But when she turned around - the fattest ass I ever saw
I flew her out a couple of more times that summer
'Til she stopped returning emails, changed her phone number
Wonder if she knew she had it, would she let me hit it raw
But I took a little penicillin, now the pain is gone

(The pain is gone)
But the memories remain, so it hurts a little bit when I come across your name
(The pain is gone)
Betrayal, lies and deceit, but I treated you so well, don't know why you would cheat
(The pain is gone)
The lesson's been learned, lust just misleads, trust must be earned
(The pain is gone)
And it wasn't that bad, but on some real shit it was, fuck you I'm still mad

So I called her back... Yeah I called her back
I swear my big sis damn near had a heart attack
But she was all of that, plus she apologized
Said she had learned a lesson, she was through with all the lies
How could I take her back? She's such a ratchet whore
Do you give up a Bentley because you scratch the door?
You find the diamond in the dirt, you don't make change
You shine that mo'fucker up and you buy a frame
Was I going insane, caught up in mindgames?
We was together three months before her mind changed
Supposed to move in, then she made excuses
""It's too much stress in LA"", she said she couldn't do it
Should've knew better, but I flew out
I drove the rental straight to her house, unannounced
She opened up the door, fat stomach, half naked
Come to find out, she was 6 months pregnant


It is. Nah, I ain't trippin'. Sorry  Mr. Brown, but yeah...",https://genius.com/Murs-the-pain-is-gone-lyrics

No fighting, no cussing, no Cuz and no Bloodin'
And sit yourself down and act like you got some sense

Now I step through the door in the flyest pair of Dunks
Quit lying, you ain't seen these at Foot Locker, chump
And I ain't about to argue shoe game with you punks
Who don't know Air Jordans from some Reebok Pumps
And out of twenty-three, thirteen was the hottest
If it's rare and it goes on your foot, then I got it
I’m at Undefeated off La Brea playin' modest
While you running up to eBay to empty out your pockets

Sock it, in the mouth if you don't wanna get clowned on
Metro-actin cats gettin frowned on, we sound on
Everything from ball to y'alls women
Ballers up in here and they bragging how they living
'Til they card get pulled, still at home with they mommy
Changing faces, Bull City, there's where you find me
Getting a low-down from the nigga innanet
You ain't done with my haircut, yet! I swear to God...

Now if your fade is as tight as we is on the mic
Just got your whip clean and your kicks on tight
'Bout to pull the flyest chick you ever pulled in your life
Then you doing what we doing and you doing it right

Ayo MURS, it ain't all about a cut to me
Wanna go somewhere, catch some comedy
And get the low-down on the drama, B
This lil' dude showing out, ""Who his mama be?!""
It's a lotta trash-talk - ""I dress better than him""
""Look better than them, you ain't got no style!""
Keep the pagers going wild with my new-new joints
Caught a glimpse in the mirror, can't keep me on point

Finally made it to Midtown, walked in the Legend's Isle
Got one waiting, so I gotta go second
Checkin it with Quan, cran and Goose
C-2 got his son in the shop running loose
To set the slang straight, ya girl is ya cape
And if she's blowing you out, then you gotta set her straight
Now everybody hate to wait, but it's so much fun
A bunch of dudes chilling, no beef, no guns

Now if your fade is as tight as we is on the mic
Just got your whip clean and your kicks on tight
'Bout to pull the flyest chick you ever pulled in your life
Then you doing what we doing and you doing it right

Now my barber named Lester, he from the N-O
Best fades in LA if you, didn't know
Tighter than Jamie, in the Kanye video
Still freestyle and getting Gs' when I rip a show
Especially when it's in the scope, you know I'm gettin low
Shout out to all my playas that be chillin in the Mo'
...Slim, you don't want it with him
Peel ya cap back to the fat meet with this pen

I been, in the chair, four bucks and some change
Can't keep takin breaks, cause he wanna go eat
Then he start taking breaks, cause he wanna go speak
I shoulda known better coulda went over to T, but
It's all gravy bread, put the money in his hand
Right now, got me cut like a new man
Caught up on my jokes, fashion to folks
Who I ain't seen since the last time we spoke

Now if your fade is as tight as we is on the mic
Just got your whip clean and your kicks on tight
'Bout to pull the flyest chick you ever pulled in your life
Then you doing what we doing and you doing it right

Decade and plus in the game, I got a name
While a lot of these commercial ass rappers should be ashamed
Sold your soul for that 15 minutes
You was in, you was on, you was hot, now you finished
I represent the real hip-hop
For my homies that still sell pills and load Glocks
I told them young dudes clean your money up
There's a recession and it's the perfect time for comin up!
You can listen to these rappers if you're dumb enough
Or smile, get money, have fun, be one of us
Why you acting tough for?
Wouldn't throw a cream-puff in a cupcake war
It's not real, it's all what you make it
All you got is your word and you're fucked once you break it

Life is a myth and time is an illusion
I'm a light shining through the confusion
We sell frequencies designed as music
All I do is kick rhymes, have fun, and do cool shit

If it wasn't for this hip-hop ish, I'd probably lose it
The real thinker: don't confuse me with Confucius
Cut on your blinker, get it right, I'm the prototype
I spit like I mix chemicals in beakers
Way before I heard my words thumping out a speaker
I knew I was too cool to play follow the leader
Everything I do goes over the head of overachievers
We can discuss this over lunch, it's over when I dump my thesis
Fuckin' punks, bunch of bitches: y'all should wear pumps
Square up, run to Orange County for a ""fair"" one
I'm out your frequency, don't speak to me
Reason be I'm like a deity, I'm the elite
MURS: bow our heads, bon apetit
Let's turn Paid Dues into Coachella and have a feast!
This rap game is full of lames driving themselves insane

This is grown-man talk
Head up high with pride is how I walk. Take notes from the source
It's ? analog and the 2-inch ?
You had to show and prove the skill to cop you a deal
Co-signs was void, shortcuts didn't exist
You had to go hard in the paint to score
Testing time to separate the weak from those
Who had abilities to transcend beats in other words, yo
You had rappers, and then you had emcees
? Melly Mel G Rap and O.C
Busy B, Starsky, Old Varsity
Sideways talk nowadays: larceny
Fast forward, present time, now it's something called 360 deal
Idiots ask where do I sign?

Better Than the Best,UnKnown,2007.0," 
We on? I still ain't got no Twix. Candy
""I can't help myself""
Man, that would be the best

My name is M-U-R-S
Hailing from the far west
Killafornia, California, L.A. Ahhh Yes
You may have heard of us
We all ain't murderers
Drive by shooters
You can kick it on the curb with us
We got blue skies
We got palm trees
We got boulevards
Beaches with a calm breeze
As far as MCs
I'm the best of 'em
Only five nine
Its above all the rest of 'em
I mean we got Dogg and we got Cube
Everybody with this blue and the red feud
Man these dudes always trying to kill somethin'
I'm putting words together hopin' that you feel somethin'
Tryin' to put that pride back into the black music
You can clap to it in your Lac or your Buick (do it)
I had to do it cause nobody else can
Couldn't beat anybody other than myself man
 
The best to ever do it
The best that ever did it
Murs is better than your favorite rapper, admit it
Better than your best
Y'all best to forget it
Murs is better than your favorite rapper admit it

Look
I'm shaking babies
And I'm kissing hands
Jumpin' in the crowd going crazy with my fans
I stand alone
Don't need anyone
But it takes two so I'm going home with anyone
And y'all ladies that's looking like Christina
Milian or Ricci I could really take either
Blond girls, black girls, Asian girls, whatever
I never met a girl that I didn't like ever
Double negative
That means I'm positively
The best rapper that you ever heard obviously
Never heard of me you didn't listen hard enough
Been moving weight on your block like a garbage truck
No trash rap
I'm moving past that
I won't crack rap just to get the ASCAP
I feel a change comin'
I got the game runnin'
Back to the lab now they all trying to say somethin'
 

I write songs
Y'all write 16s
Need to grow up, stop playin' with them kid's things
You gotta a permit
A license to kill
Was making y'all money when I didn't have a deal (for real)
In on the real
Still workin' for the white man
Even if you is moving that white, man
Ayyyyyyye
Y'all rhyme the same word
No matter what you say man its just absurd
Ohhhhhh
And I never been served
Not in the drive thru
Not even on the curb (Hell naw)
Not a warrant, not even a subpoena
Not even peanuts in a sold out arena
That's why you salty
The fans exalt me
Why you over yonder throwin' hate trying to halt me
Man I won't stop, my grind won't pause
I'm moving positive circles like a round of applause
 

Thank you for all for comin' out. I'd like to thank Nottz
I'd like to thank Vic for stayin' up late
I'd like to thank my bad ass god daughters for gettin' on my nerve all damn day
And me still comin' to work and doin' my job which is to be, the best
The bestest. That's a word, cause I said so. Thank you very much",https://genius.com/Murs-better-than-the-best-lyrics
Better Way,The Final Adventure,2012.0,"In 89 they threw me under the water
In the name of the Holy Spirit, Son, and the Father
From this day forward I would always have a partner
Someone to lean on as the times got harder
But as the days got darker
I began to question everything I was a part of
Why the preacher always driving something so nice
And why the leader of the choir ain’t got no wife
So many things that didn’t flow right
The ones who loved the most high always be the lowlifes
So I expanded on my own route
Read The Final Call, saw what Farakah was talking bout
When I first quit pork it made my mother shout
Did miss pepperoni, yo no doubt
But I held strong, I was so devout
A little man trying figure it all out

I pray for love, I pray for peace
I pray for you, I pray for me
I pray for the living, I pray for the deceased
I pray for the people that’s living in the streets
I pray for my friends, pray for my enemies
I pray for free healthcare and clean energy
Cause this my prayer, I say it every day
I pray for patience while we working towards a better way

Been around the world, traveled many oceans
I kept a clear heart and my mind open
Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines
One with nature, one with the divine
Find your god, find your peace
Find your truth and your beliefs
Weather you believe in God or the tooth fairy
Bump Brother Ali or watch Tyler Perry
Me, I grew up inside the Baptist church
But I still do yoga because I think it works
I believe in ancient aliens and in Jesus
I believe in helping mother Earth cause she needs us
I believe in understanding and tolerance
I believe in government without the politics
I believe you shouldn’t place your faith in one man
And remember the creator has a master plan",https://genius.com/Murs-better-way-lyrics
Can It Be (Half a Million Dollars and 18 Months Later),MURS For President,2008.0," ""could it be I stayed away to long""

For my supporters and fans, man I know ya'll been waiting
Now its finally here and thank you for your patience
The worlds gone crazy since the last time we spoke
Blood shed in war, the absence of hope
Shooting at the school, the economy is a joke
Homies on heroine, homies on coke
But can you even blame them when they're only trying to cope, damn!
All these rappers want to talk about is guns and dope
Don't they realize we all at the end of our rope
The future all depends on the power of our quotes
The power of our pen, the power of our vote
The power of your words, the power of your voice
The power of America is the freedom of choice
We choose to do nothing, we losing, we're suffering
Can it be that its time to do something
It’s not socialism, it’s not communism
It’s loving each other, realize there’s no difference
Its positive movement, gradual improvement
When no one else does, believe you can do it
My heart is a speaker, I bleed this music
The beats in my blood, I must transfuse it
If it wasn't for this, then I just might lose it, damn!
My goddaughters, Nadia, Symon
Diana know your fathers' never coming home
Claimed by the streets its another war zone
Tears in my eyes as I'm writing this song
Mommy working two jobs trying to do it on her own
No matter where I go or how far I roam
Know that I love you, you'll never be alone
Damn, you're so grown
From the independent hip hop scene
Now they talking like how I'm not a hip hop fiend
Needle in my arm, can't they see that I'm OD'N?
You'll never take the stripes of this triple OG'N
I blaze trails, created festival
Lost 50Gs on Paid Dues, is that acceptable?
What?
I'm not down for the cause?
Hold on Mike, I'mma need a few bars
I could've done a Nas and scream hip hop is dead
I got up off my ass and I did something instead
Signed with the devil spent my scene in the upper level
Killed the beast from within now I'm a born again rebel
Trying to save the youth from the way of the gun
And if I only save one then my job is done
So you can say what you will, but you should judge me none!
From my God, from my faith; I move place to place
Sometimes I thought if I should die, that'd be great
Drop on the spot man I didn't even care
I stopped talking to you, I stopped saying prayers
Numb from the liquor and the anti-depressants
Pressure from the label, studio stressin'
Almost lost my passion to pursue this profession
For myself for my soul when I'm out on the road
I give so much out to these kids I don't know
I thought I lost you with no one to talk to
But you're the one that opened up the doors that I walked through
I can't fault you only forgive you
I'm the only one that seen the pain that you been though
The drama the struggle that built all your issues
Its all just to make sure they never forget you
 ""Did I leave your mind when I was gone
Its not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at.""",https://genius.com/Murs-can-it-be-half-a-million-dollars-and-18-months-later-lyrics
Love & Appreciate 2,MURS For President,2008.0,"What you need is some love and appreciation
Gotta treat her like a queen before she walk away
Before it's too late, you gotta..sing it, you better treat her like a lady
Oh ahh, treat her like a lady, shes that special lady

Now it had to all start with a broken heart
Some dude got hurt and it was ripping him apart
So he, he made him a song
Cause he was tired of the pain and the getting done wrong
But how long will it last?
You can't keep comparing them to women from the past
It's time to move on
Open up your heart so you can sing a new song
You ain't a pimp you just pissed off
Meet the right woman and you get soft
Used to try and play hard
Now you buying chocolate and valentines cards
And man..that's a good thing
Showing these kids what the word love should mean

What you need is some love and appreciation
Gotta treat her like a queen before she walk away
Before it's too late, you gotta..sing it, you better treat her like a lady
Oh ahh, treat her like a lady, shes that special lady

Can't live with them, can't live without them
But I love a whole lot more than I hate about them
They look good feel good and smell even better
So why you acting like your mama didn't use that leather?
B word this, h bomb that
In the midst all of this I wonder where your moms at?
Cause if she ain't one, then tell me where the hate from
You just calm down and maybe you can date one
Buy some flowers, open up some doors
She needs some tampons, homie go to the store
Vitamin water, a bottle of motrin
Teddy bear, candy bar something, a token
Of affection, a step in that direction
Cause love is about progress not perfection

What you need is some love and appreciation
Gotta treat her like a queen before she walk away
Before it's too late, you gotta..sing..you better treat her like a lady
Oh ahh, treat her like a lady, shes that special lady

You love your homeboys, but you hate these ladies
Your gonna chose them over her, you crazy?
The ones you post up with, smoke blunts with
Y'all share the same spit, you might as well kiss
Now don't get me wrong, I love my dudes
But I'ma pick a girl anytime I gotta choose
I like mad, but I love orgasms
And I'm not trying to have the same problems your having
Cause your confused the scared little dude
Beatin' on your lady cause your in a bad mood
Your insecure, a little unsure
Don't know how to deal with the feelings so pure
It's called love, it's joy and pain
But you gotta take some risk to enjoy the game

What you need is some love and appreciation
Gotta treat her like a queen before she walk away
Before it's too late, you gotta..sing..you better treat her like a lady
Oh ahh, treat her like a lady, shes that special lady",https://genius.com/Murs-love-and-appreciate-2-lyrics
I Hate Your Boyfriend,MURS Rules the World,2000.0,"And This one Goes out to all the ladies
Yes You
The Ones at the Promenade out at the mall
Holding Your Mother Fuckin' Punk Ass Boyfriends HAND!!
The Fuck You comin' Dressed Like That with yo' muthafuckin' Man and
You don't expect nobody to look

Damn Did you see her?
Sweet JESUS!
I wish My Boys were here to see this
In their wildest dreams they couldn't possibly concieve this
A Vision of Perfection
A Godess A Venus
I Mean this girl has so much charm
Wait a fuckin' minute
What's that on her arm?
(Godamn!)
Can Someone tell me that really ain't a man
I don't mean to be rude but there is no way in hell that that really is your dude
Sorry to be a asshole but let me play my part
But let me take you and him to a sudden change of heart
You Might Say Whatever
But I know you feel better when you leave the show with me
And its nice to stay together
We Don't Even have to go to national T.V
We could cut to the chase and right now you leave with me
So Whaddya' Say?
Look, I know I'm not the shit the hottest joint in the ashtray
The Way Sad Shape Makes me leave you in a bad way
I'm lookin' like you future and your man has passed a day
So why don't you give him a pink slip
Thank him for his time
Give him a hug
And let him know this is his last day

Cause I hate your boyfriend
Because he can't possibly be Fuckin' you right
You know that I hate yo' boyfriend
Because I know you are tired of going to him every night
Because I hate your boyfriend
Cause he's always by your side steady fuckin' up my plans
You Know I hate your boyfriend
Cause of him you'll never have the chance to get a real man

(In funny voice) Hey Murs That's my Lady (End Funny Voice)
Man I didn't even know
But why'd you bring her half naked to my Hip-hop Show
Standin' in the front row just starin' at a nigga
Damn near forgot my verse just starin' at her figure
Seein' her buy a CD thought she'd get a cheaper price (hah!)
Tits and ass ain't a cupon although it is nice
To View and Pursuit Look Don't be mad at me
This is simply what I do
And while you
In the corner talking hip hop in the sidewalk with your boys
She was standing by the exit lookin' bored
So I had to bring the noise
Asked her how she like the show and what she does for a living
We talked for a while
And took and EMCEE to feel the ryhthm she was given
I gave my room number wondered if she'd come through
She said she'd drop off her friend and be there around 2
But then you came with the cuffs and rush her off the floor
Caught the first line of my rhyme before you hit the door
(Funny Voice) Her Murs that's my Lady(End Funny Voice)
If you have to say that than the woman isn't yours
And if you gotta say that Then the bitch ain't yours

You know I hate your boyfriend
Cause he's a no game cock blockin' ass bitch
You Know I hate your boyfriend
Cause he'd hate me if our positions were to switch
I Hate your boyfriend
Cause he's always by yourside steady fuckin' up my plans
Because I hate your boyfriend
Because of his punk ass you'll never have a real man

Now this verse is dedicated to your friends girl
You know that 5 and a half he thinks is a ten girl
Sayin' you would trade her for nothing in the world
But she ain't worth shit
Everytime you thought a ryhme the bitch is all on your dick
She's jes' playin' with his mind
Givin' you that look with pussy hugs all the time
Now let me take some time to explain the term
Pussy Hug means when a girl leans in
Arches her Back and her Pussy is the first thing to make contact
Then she slowly presses her tits against your chest
Then she finally wraps her arm around your neck
A blatant sign of disrespect
Its not hard to detect
Its something that your boy always neglects to check
And everyone saw what was comin' up next
That was him walking into you comin' on his neck
Now yo' boy's life is a wreck
He's makin' suicide threats
(Funny Voice) I can't live without her (end funny voice)
But when you know when you open up your eyes that's what you get

I hate your boyfriend
Cause he has no clue to what the fuck is going on
You know I hate your boyfriend
Cause if it wasn't for him I wouldn't have to make this song
Because I hate your boyfriend
Cause he's always by your side steady fuckin' up my plans
That's why I hate your boyfriend
Because of his punk ass you'll never have a real man
You know I HATE your BOYFRIEND

Real cute, spending loot, Fairfax
5'2, baby blue Air Max
Hair pulled back, nails did up
I said, ""Call me anytime you wanna get..huh""
Up north got a chick from Humbolt
White girl, dreadlocks with the good smoke
Got caught, went to jail trying to sell dope
Police asked me if I knew her I said, ""Hell no""
Had a lawyer broad, she kept me out of trouble
Cute face, brief case with a nice bubble
Seattle girl, get to snuggle with on rainy days
Had to leave, hadn't seen the sun in 80 days
So I made my way up to Van City
Sweated at the boarder, but the girls are so damn pretty
Really
There's beauty everywhere you go
But I found my love in the 5-2-O
:
And you could be my west side love
Together we gone show them how the west side does
Back when we was popping that's the best I was
Come on and let's show them about the west side cuz, uh
You could be my west side love
Together we gone show them how the west side does
Back when we was popping that's the best I was
Come on and let's show them about the west side blood
:
One chick from Oakland, she down for business
The other one from Frisco, they always set tripping
She like the 9er's the other like the Raiders
It's all about the Dodgers so I told them both ""Later""
In the 5-O-3, they always go nuts
I had this crazy broad put voodoo on my donuts
At El Cholo, I met this chicana chick
Short hair, named Bianca she was kinda thick
Couldn't deal with the brown and black politicking
She cut me off before her homeboys started tripping
I got a gangster chick, she's from the projects
Always wear a bandanna anytime we have sex
Punched my ex in the face and through up a gang sign
Some of y'all think I'm playing but I ain't lying
We broke up, she got back with her baby dad
But I still got love for her crazy ass
:
And you could be my west side love
Together we gone show them how the west side does
Back when we was popping that's the best I was
Come on and let's show them about the west side cuz, uh
You could be my west side love
Together we gone show them how the west side does
Back when we was popping that's the best I was
Come on and let's show them about the west side blood
:
East coast, west side Manhattan
Upscale, her fingernails platinum
Sex In The City, drinking cosmos and everything
Smoking cigarettes going hard for her wedding ring
Any size and shape around the world
Bonita Applebums
 or Around The Way girls
I love you all
You're so damn attractive
And if you need them I got crazy prophylactics
 :
Ha ha. I want to show love to-to-to really all the ladies (all of y'all) around the world, know what I'm saying (I love you)? Especially all up and down the west coast (west side). Out to 8-0-8 to far west coast all the Hawaiian, beautiful women (what up?). You know, fuck it. All the-all the beautiful girls everywhere (all of y'all. Every single one of y'all). If you're not from the west side (don't worry about it), don't worry, you know what I'm saying? Let one of the west coast niggas swag you the fuck out. We'll converse you baby. To all the esse homies, all the Blood homies, all the Crip homies. And once again, for all of y'all not from the west side, don't trip. Esse, esse, means 'friend' (It just means 'friend'. That's all). Ski Beatz (yeah). Old Weird Harold on the keys. And fuck D-Rich (ha ha). I'm out

Anybody can get (anybody, absolutely)
Ya already know what it is
So don't ask

You wake up to find no cereal inside of your box
You got a problem, them Strange rhymers out on your block
So good morning, get it in like it's 30 below
Another ¡MURSDAY! is here to come and dirty your soul
You see the haters get the genitals
Back up off the minerals
Rolling with the general and high off that medical
Rolling all around the world and still rocking a flip phone
Hip hop to the death, two-stepping in every zip code

Pull up in the lot without my kin and crash a shindig
Bitch we on the clock and this is all official business
I been on the radio and shit has got ridiculous
Got me in the mood to cause some motherfucking mischief
Override the system, drugs with some sick kids
You know what we on, we tryna make the fucking hit list
Write a couple songs and live forever in your pictures
Pick another fight before the kick us out the exit

Walk up in the party with our guns drawn
Might just leave a body on your front lawn
I don't give a fuck if they say we wrong
You better keep your hands up when they play this song
And keep your hands in the air
If you know the government don't care
If you got on $5 underwear
But you're feeling like a fucking millionaire
And can I get a hell yea? (Hell yeah)
Do It Big, Keep It Strange, don't care (Hell yeah)
Keep your eyes on the prize, don't share (Hell yeah)
Cuz we bout to take the crown this year (Hell yeah)

Second batter up, I never had a fuck
To give, if I did, shit, you was out of luck
I'm laser focused with mine like Scott Summers is
The Cyclops, X-Men, for you dumber kids
I read them funny books, they got the pictures in them
Still pull the thickest chick in the sickest denim
Then I spit this venom, like Eddie Brock does
Had the crowd raising eyebrows like The Rock does
Blood, Cuhs, it's all in the same gang
Just brothers in different colors, we need to change things
And this is Strange gang, talking 'bout my chain again
Mine's fine, I got it shined by my Asian friend
At the swap meet in the wrong hood
I'm the bad member but still make the song good
Good enough they had to sign me, better ask Trav
I'm fucking with these strong genetics like I'm in the lab

Walk up in the party with our guns drawn
Might just leave a body on your front lawn
I don't give a fuck if they say we wrong
You better keep your hands up when they play this song
And keep your hands in the air
If you know the government don't care
If you got on $5 underwear
But you're feeling like a fucking millionaire
And can I get a hell yea? (Hell yeah)
Do It Big, Keep It Strange, don't care (Hell yeah)
Keep your eyes on the prize, don't share (Hell yeah)
Cuz we bout to take the crown this year (Hell yeah)

Gun is out, everybody running out
Hearing people scream and shout (""OH MY GOD HE'S GOT A GUN!!"")
'Cause they run their mouth, they throwing this tongue about like having some kind of clout (It's negros, we better run)
He'on't want (he'ont want it)
He'on't need it (he'on't need it)
If they try to put a case on this, we gon' beat it (we gon' beat it)
Interrupted a groovy movie, so we said fuck it left it and ate at Ruby Tuesday's
Snotty white waitress said sorry, I'm so blunt
One of the homies singing YG's ""Fuck Donald Trump""
And she said ""Fuck Obama""
And we said ""Fuck yo mama""
And your granny too, 'cause we would never touch your nana, bitch
Manager say we gotta leave
Not before I get a shot, I get it then I'm appeased
And he said ""No""
So I got somebody shot off the bar quick, lifted it up and said ""Here's to you sucking my dick""

Walk up in the party with our guns drawn
Might just leave a body on your front lawn
I don't give a fuck if they say we wrong
You better keep your hands up when they play this song
And keep your hands in the air
If you know the government don't care
If you got on $5 underwear

It's all out war when you cross that line yeah
 Aye bruh imma keep it real for a second hold up

Too old for this shit, I'm almost 30
I might throw out my back, get my clothes dirty
Too much time on the grind for me to fail
To get into some beef, wind up in jail
Isaiah you had a good run
It's time to hang it up, man these pussys got guns
No more fair fights, no more fightin' for sport
Pick the wrong night N' get your life cut short
No honor, no respect for life
It's a issue when these bitches put pistols in fist fights
Cowards claim calibers, red beam silencers
All because they can't compete wit' real challengers
No gangs we don't hide behind colors
A real man shouldn't have to hide behind another
Take a loss like a man that's what bosses do
Cause you ain't a real boss till you lost a few

I stare without caring when I walk through the door
You see it in my eyes I been there before
I got my stories, I know you got yours
These are our scars, this is our war
I stare without caring while you looking at the floor
You see it in my eyes I been there before
I got my stories I know you got yours
These are our scars, this is our war
You got your pride and I got mine
It's all out war when you cross that line yeah

There's a code, it's rules and regulations
Passed down through time, and through the generations
Honor, discipline that's a warriors aim
The game has changed but the rules are the same
You never fight a man who doesn't wanna fight
Never fight other women unless it's blood and your wife
No knives no weapons unless he's bigger than you
If he a bully go bully then, split him in two
Your man lose pick em up take him home
Never fight another man's fight when he's wrong
Take these rules home, make em your own
For these are the steps towards taking the throne",https://genius.com/Murs-swc-lyrics

Everybody askin' me what's on my head

No matter what's said
I know my hair fly
Everybody stare when they walk by
Dreadlocks fallin all ova me
I'm pullin mo' freaks then jodasee
They stop what they doin just to notice me
The center of attention like I'm pose'd to be
Don't be made cause ya fade played out
Even A.I. wanna take his braids out (look at em)
Let it lock up
Throw ya block up
It's all peace
So put ya Glock up
It's big murs and rick rock
Everybody watch when I fall through tha spot
Dredlocks falling all over me
I got dredlocks falling all over me

NFL players got em under they helmets
Celebratin in tha endzone
Some people say they give you powers like Zeus
You say they ugly, but cha girl say they handsome
Ask ma man Pacman Jones in Atlanta
College graduates goin' down to the Bammas
You could speak proper or that country grammer (rite thur)
You could have none or you can have just one
But everybody know dreads have mo fun
Mac Dre had em
Ya boy sway got em
You could separate
Or twist em down to the bottom
Or let em go crazy; like I got mine
Some people got a hundred, I got about nine
Jesus Christ had...
Bob Marley had...
It may be a style, but it's not a fad
It's my heritage, it's the way that I wear it is
Jus like ma Great, Great Grandparents did
They used to tell us kids
That it was Shameful
How you tell a Lion not to let his Mane grow
Asians, Jamicans, even the Anglos
All Gettin Irie and lettin it Tangle
They it's strange so you won't except it
Groups And Culture, You will respect it
Pick up a book, learn about Selassie
You ain't Gotta Smoke weed to read Marcus Garvey
It's Rastafari
And we ain't all high
Jus tryna uplift
Fore' we all die
It's nothin to hide
You wear em with pride
And if you got em, then you gotta swing side to side. C'mon

Superhero Pool Party,A Strange Journey Into the Unimaginable,2018.0,"[Intro: Murs & 
Bishop
]
Bishop can I tell you a story for night night
Yea, okay
What do you want the story to be about
Umm I don't know
Can I tell you about the time papa had a superhero pool party
Yeah
Okay, are you ready?
Yeah
Whos your favorite superhero?
Black Panther
 and 
Spiderman
They weren't invited, fuck them

Superman just broke the diving board
Rugrats fighting with the baby from the Dinosaurs
Not the mama, Hook brought the drama
'Cause Rufio and Lost Boys fucking up some commas
Back To The Future, Marty and Doc Brown
Cursing Kanye 'cause he brought the Nike stock down
Soundwave tripping, he ain't nothing but a artifact
People buying vinyl but cassettes ain't coming back
Speaking of comebacks, I just saw Voltron
Rolling with the Thundercats, getting their smoke on
He passed the joint over to DJ Lance Rock
Who had his boombox bumping Welcome to Jamrock
Black Lightning came through with Static Shock
Talking bout they the comic book Biggie and Pac
I said shut the fuck up, where T'Challa and Storm go?
He said they in the bathroom making a porno

S to the U to the P-E-R
Too many bad guys at the bar
So the H to the E-R-O-E-S
Had to find another place to have a turn-up fest
I said a 3 to the 2 and 2 to the 1
Who said the good guys can't have fun?
1 to the 2 and 2 to the 3
We 'bout to have a superhero pool party

Wonder Woman rolled up with her girl Jean Grey
With some shitty-ass bean dip from Frito-Lay
She-Hulk saved the day with some bomb guacamole
Same color as her skin, with a plate of ravioli
Outta nowhere, Flash came and ate the whole plate
When I went to swing on him, he vanished without a trace
Iron Man pissed, he always been a foody
I said don't be mad, Marvel makes better movies
He was drinking with Starfire, trying to take her shirt off
I had to kick him out because he was being a jerk off
Then I heard a sound I never heard before
Like the whole house now was on the verge of war
Hulk was in the front yard fucking with Thor
Good thing I hired Wolverine to work at the door
I told 'em both to shut the fuck up, come in and have cupcakes
Just one night without fights for fucks sake

S to the U to the P-E-R
Too many bad guys at the bar
So the H to the E-R-O-E-S
Had to find another place to have a turn-up fest
I said a 3 to the 2 and 2 to the 1
Who said the good guys can't have fun?
1 to the 2 a 2 to the 3
We 'bout to have and superhero pool party

I told Batman no capes in the pool
And Catwoman tried to steal all my Infinity jewels
Look jewels, gems, I really don't give a fuck
Professor X fell out his wheelchair
, nobody picked him up
Aquaman asked me if he needed a hand
Popeye was trying to smoke all of his green out a can
Swamp Thing was 'shrooming with the Animal Man
And 
the Ninja Turtles just robbed the pizza man
Somebody told Shield and they sent Maria Hill
To investigate the Domino's crime
Now Starfire's topless and I can't stop it
But the Titans say she do it all the time
Johnny Blaze told Johnny Storm that he was more litty
I told both niggas that they wasn't fucking with me
Why you think Starfire keep pulling out her titties?
'Cause I got the hottest pool party in the fucking city
[Outro: Murs & 
Bishop
]
Spiderman was the best, because everyone liked him
When I tell him, everybody
But Bishop, Spiderman's not in my story
Yeah?
Yeah, I left him out, 'cause fuck Spiderman
Did Black Panther come?
Fuck Black Panther and Spiderman",https://genius.com/Murs-superhero-pool-party-lyrics
Marry Me,Sweet Lord,2008.0,"That's the way I always heard that it should be
You say you wanna marry me

I'm looking for the one
They tell me stop lookin'
And everywhere I look
I seen all the good ones tooken
Mistake, taken, so heart breakin'
They say be patient so I just keep waiting
Ring finger vacant
Ain't gotta be perfect but I'm hoing you adjacent
Close to it, go through it, baby that's whow most do it
Fake it 'til we make, then attach some hope to it
And let it flow on
Bow tie dunks, with my sport coat on
And we standing at the alter
I'm looking in your eyes
Hoping that I don't falter
Cause I adore you
Can't wait to explore you
Give you every luxury that I could afford to
You lead me and let me lead the way
As times goes on I love you more each day
(Will you marry me)

If you could
I'm down on one knee
Hoping that it's all good
To have you, to hold you, to cherish you forever
Build a family and some memories to treasure
The first day of the rest of our life
We stand together as husband and wife
Family and friends get together, throw rice
If you say yes, it will be so right
If you would...

(That's the way I always head that it should be
You say you wanna marry me)

Who want to treat you like a queen
Cook and clean
A Father MC to help you live the dream
The house, the children
A future worth building
Please and use the ark that I wanna be stilled in
A million kisses, a thousands roses
You're my everything, without you I'm hopeless
I go the extra mile to make sure you know this
Put you on a song, for the world to notice
And oh yes
It only gets better
What we have here is the truth, forever
What ever happens, my love is unchangin'
My shining star, my sun and the rainin'
The good, the bad, the hurt, the painin'
The times we drive each other insainin'
Won't always like you but never not love you
And solemnly swear to put nothing above you

Powerful,A Strange Journey Into the Unimaginable,2018.0,"(Powerful)
They call me slept on, guess I'm the one they dreaming 'bout
But when they finally woke, it'll be my name that they'll be screaming out
Been walking this path from an early age
Reading books by the Panthers, building up my rage
At age 14, rest soul on ice
Spook Who Sat By The Door, read that joint twice
Ice Cube, Brotha J and Ice T
These are the professors that would set my mind free
Fuck the police to the Easton cop killer
These were my textbooks, sorry it was not thriller
That pop music was filler, no disrespect to Mike
But I was fed up and focused, I was ready to fight
The power
With Flavor Flav and Carl Ridenhour now emerged my energy with Public Enemy for many hours
Towers of Babylon that radiate pollution
Are the same ones we'll be using to stream the revolution

Facts is facts and the fact is whack is whack
Nowadays they need to let the rappers rap
Facts is facts and the fact is trap is trap
Whip that work, but just let the rappers rap
Facts is facts, it's a fact that you stackin' racks
Get your money, but just let the rappers rap
Rappers act like rappers but they still singing
Autotune and making music with no meaning

I stand for the flag, and stand for my people
This is not a contradiction, I am not a fan of evil
Most of these rappers is evil as these politicians
Flexing on their own folks who ain't even got a pot to piss in
Still they loving on the bad guy
Try to be the hero, my people tell me to stand by (Stand by)
Cause I don't rap about the coonery
I'm Rogue One, standing like Diego in this lunacy
Ergo, my Earth go Urso, full circle
And we plant seeds amongst the weeds to make the Earth grow
Pollocks sprout as I spout this intelligence
Horrid in my aura, my intent is of intelligence
Radio once meant relevance, now irrelevant
It's all about the playlist, the playing field is levelling
If you got better ideas, then I am Edison
Electrifying and defining true music medicine

Facts is facts and the fact is whack is whack
Nowadays they need to let the rappers rap
Facts is facts and the fact is trap is trap
Whip that work, but just let the rappers rap
Facts is facts, it's a fact that you stackin' racks
Get your money, but just let the rappers rap
Rappers act like rappers but they still singing
Autotune and making music with no meaning

We live in this odd paradox right?
This juxtaposition of knowing too much and not enough
I got facts to quote ya, you just don't know when to shut up
When you can't un-understand
Know too much to leave it alone and not enough to trust the process of seeing too much
Art that builds cultures and chants down tyranny's power
And empowers powerless, homie how you gon' change the land with one tenth of your man's fanbase
Facts!
Am I too smart to be that dumb or too dumb to be that smart

H-U-S-T-L-E,Murs 3:16: The 9th Edition,2004.0,"Everybody out here wanna be hustlers, man
Buit they dont have any idea what I used to do
I used to do anything imaginable
A nigga like me was scared to go to jail
So I'd use my brain and just think up the most outlandish shit
Shit niggers would never do, I used to get dirty
Now these niggas out here just be out here queer hustling
Man these niggas got it all backwards
I'm gonna show 'em how I used to do it

A lotta people wanna knock what we do on my block
But we do what we do cause we ain't got a lot
And you might get shot if your tounges not watched
Casue dudes walk around with hand cannons in their crotch
Fucking up the way they walk, stuck to the strip like scotch
With the top notch Bosch that can cook clean rocks
See times is too hard for us to ever go soft
So the doc got me on prescription strength zoloft
So I can deal with the stress and I won't go off
But I'm on top, won't stop 'til the microphone drop
Rollin' four deep in the Cut like, what?
Hit you up and then roll off, we tryin' to get this dough boss
We don't do diamonds cause my dudes ain't show offs
Tryin' to keep it low so we don't see no cops
Wanna blow up, but I don't wanna go pop
Gotta blow up cause I can't let this dough stop

H-U-S-T-L-E (Hustler!)
You'll never find a dime that ain't mine motherfucker
Roll not to be broke and have to stroll like a sucker
So pay me what you owe me, and don't play with me homie (x 2)

I used to sell insense bottle 10 cents a dozen
Hit the strip and make 'em flip for a dollar a sack
Everyday before juinor high I bought a six pack
And sold 'em for a buck a piece down by the track
And I never sold crack, did aluminum cans
Used to get laughed at by you and your mans
But I never let it get, stay true to my plans
I used it all for the studio (Now you understand)
In the grocery store parking lot, like can I help you ma'am?
To the car with those bags, used to run that old drag
For a itty bitty tip, maybe a quarter or more
And when I wasn't doing that I was knocking at your door
Like, ""May I speak to the head of the household?""
Then give you the speech on how buying this candys keeping me out the
Streets
Cheap dirt hustles, no glorious tales, but it did keep my black ass from
Going to jail
And I'm a

H-U-S-T-L-E (Hustler!)
You'll never find a dime that ain't mine motherfucker
Roll not to be broke and have to stroll like a sucker
So pay me what you owe me, and don't play with me homie (x 2)

I can make a dollar out a dime when I hollar out a rhyme
From the school of hard knocks, so a scholar of the grind
Used to dub tapes myself, claim the quality was fine
But it sounded like shit, lots of hits, hella static
But for three plus two, them shits moved like magic
That's five well spent for true hip-hop addicts
And once they're friends heard it, then they all had to have it
So I took it on the road with little to no baggage
Just some draws and casettes, droppin' jaws with my sets
Once they saw the live show they had to take a piece home
Now I'm almost famous, used to be least known
But not to big to walk the streets alone
Stand in front of any venue witha box of cd's
And these kids love me I stay DTE
Down To Earth, and down to merch at any given moment
If there's money on the block, then where am I, Cause I'm a

H-U-S-T-L-E (Hustler!)

God’s Work,....The End of the Beginning,2003.0,"I stumbled out of bed, hungover, none sober
Like the Joes rushed my body and I was the sole Cobra
Still a soldier, grabbed a soda helped my stomach settle down
Then fell into the shower as to let the funk drown
Put Degree under my arms, turned off the alarm
You only set it to regret it
A million things to do but work is where I'm headed
The dreaded grindstone on the edge of my bed
I sit and let my mind zone on how fun last night was
Started with a light buzz that slowly progressed into a full blown fade
I was trying to get laid, but got no action
It was back to the crib for personal satisfaction
Triple X DVDs, I got a whole stack and
Was snapped out of my daydream by something that I seen
I left the tissue full of spunk on the floor by my jeans
It seems I have 15 minutes to make the 20 minute ride it takes to get to work
So I fly out the door while I'm putting on my shirt
Start the car and then I'm off to get in trouble with my boss
He runs his mouth like a bitch
Sometimes I wish he'd lay me off
So that I could lay him out
With one little punch right to his fat ass mouth
But now I'm assed out, cause these fools on the freeway
Be driving like they ain't got nowhere to go
You know those fucks in the fast lane moving hella slow
Got me yelling at my windshield, now it's like 10 'til
I want to call in, man I think it every day
But I'm not ballin', so I got to go get paid
And continue the charade of customer service
Since I don't get commission, my efforts seem worthless
""Thanks and have a nice day"" is what I got to say
Even if they were rude and gave me attitude
It's a shame what I have to do to get rent and food

I work hard, goddamn hard
To keep this roof over my head
And pay off these credit cards
I work hard, goddamn hard
So I could pay off all my debt
And get a house with a yard
I work hard, goddamn hard
To put that gas off in the tank
And make the payments on this car
I work hard, goddamn hard
So I could wild out every weekend
And buy drinks at the bar

Try being on the road for 45 days straight
Road manager's the driver and myself plus 8
Other motherfuckers and they're idiosyncratic
'Sop brought two-systems, he's a video fanatic
Sunspot got enough weed to give me contact for the month and a half
PSC got the gas and forever blowing up the spot with his rotten ass
Of course Grouch brought a task that'll fill his time plot
Trying to hook Pro-Tools to his new laptop
Eligh's on the last cot, a hypochondriac
So with him you never know if it's a fever or an act
Scarub's usually either reading, writing, or sleeping
And Bicasso needs to use somebody's cellies on the creeping
Me I'm simply dreaming, plotting schemes to get some money
Almost forgot about Arata but you know
As we tour throughout the country everybody starts to argue over
What we watch on TV and who drank the last brew, who's been hating on who
Maybe throw a punch or two until a virus breaks out
And how healthy can you be?
When you getting little sleep and all you eat is take out
But the show must go on when you livin' dusk 'till dawn
If I don't rap every night, I might lose a fan
So even if I got the flu I got a mic in my hand
And I haven't even spoke on the one night stands
Yeah that might sound fly to the average guy
But when you got a girl at home you got to let it pass you by
So I try to play the sidelines
Watch what they pull, but on a bus full of women, hard to stay faithful
So I cheat, not because I hate my girl, because I miss her
Even though she won't believe me when I say ""I only kissed her""
Been home a couple days and she still won't speak
Still, I got to hit the road again beginning of the week

I work hard
Goddamn hard
To keep this roof over my head
And pay off these credit cards
I work hard
Goddamn hard
So I could pay off all my debt
And get a house with a yard
I work hard
Goddamn hard
To put that gas off in the tank
And make the payments on this car
I work hard
Goddamn hard!",https://genius.com/Murs-gods-work-lyrics

You see my tattoos, figure why I bother

Hard workin' father, wife and two daughters
Strugglin', trying to keep our heads above water

I'm chicano, I'm not an illegal
Tryin' to live your American dream
But you keep judging me about how I wear my jeans
They're 42s, they're starched and they greased
I gotta education, I got proper speech
I'm from the streets, I'm not less of a man

Poppin' bottles in the club, I'm just chillin' at the house
Playin' war games with 4 dames in your name
Don't get high, stay fly and inside your lane
Tame as a derriere but it gets scarier
When you try to test the best in your area
Aerial attacks and burials and wax
Like an Annabelle tale, but scarier in fact

They told me real rap is dead, I had to laugh at that
How is it dead if Wu-Tang's Forever?

Wherever You Are,The Final Adventure,2012.0,"Met her at Montreal right outside a concert hall
Her name was Rose, my reply was no response at all
Half Moroccan and half French
Couldn’t keep talking, I panicked I was too tense
Froze up like Elaine
She smiled, broke the ice so I started to spit my game
I said Rose, that’s a pretty name
And if I never got to see your city it would be a shame
Be my personal tour guide
We could see the sites from the inside of your ride
Got to the bus around four or five
Walk me to the door, it was snowing outside
I guess the bus close enough to make contact
Whispered in her ear, she should give me her contact
Slipped me some paper then she started to fall back
Rocket mail dot com, how the fuck I’ma call that
Well fuck then, don’t call back
Blown off by this female
If this was 98 I had never heard of e-mail
Then she explain the details
Parent's strict, she wasn’t allowed to see males
Got home and copped me a laptop
From this basehead right outside of the crack spot
Plugged in the modem, got a Hotmail account
Time to see what the world wide web was all about
Send a message, she replied the next day
Welcome to the internet sweetie, now let’s play
We shared stories, we wrote essays
I remember every word like it was yesterday
Back and forth for like three months
Finally popped the question, asked her when we could meet up
Response seemed like it never came
And when it finally did I was forever changed
She said my heart belongs to you but my body to another
And should I refuse I’d bring shame to my mother
Words on the screen never brought such pain
Kept trying to reach her, all attempts were in vain
So I check my inbox for your name
Looked for the messages that never came
If we’ll never get together it would be a shame

Say ""cuz"" when I talk, pants sag when I walk
Bumpin KDAY,
 
just discovered hip-hop
I play Pop Warner and I love Transformers
But you see the big homey standin out on the corner
He got real guns, not the ones from G.I. Joe
He feared and respected like everywhere we go
Can't wait 'til I'm 10 and I get jumped in
You should see the tattoo he gave himself with a pen
He did in the pen like 3 years ago
And he just got home, now he bigger than befo'
Liftin weights in the yard he, way too hard
Been shot 5 times, even let me touch the scars
I can ride in his car when I get from the hood
A fresh Iroc with a dope Kenwood
Two 15's and his curl on sheen
A big booty freak with some airbrushed jeans
Don't dis put the hood in your childhood dreams
Growin up these days ain't as easy as it seems

We live life like death ain't a thing
Fear and respect we collect like kings
Relive stress with every breath I sing
And we all chase money cause we scared to chase dreams

19, almost 20 years old
Cut the baby curl, now I got an afro
Cornrows, some say french braids
Weed and robberies the only way I get paid
Couldn't slang crack, O.G.'s do that
So money hungry wouldn't front me a sack
That's why the old timers keep gettin jacked
I'm full time bangin ain't no turnin back
Dropped out of school, no G.E.D
But in these streets I'm a G-O-D
Enemies tell they B.G. stories 'bout me
A nightmare, when I'm off that P
That's why they always run when they see me in the street
Known to beat 'em down, straight take they heat
What about the police, man even they scared
When I see em hit the block I put 2 in the air
... Got my momma scared of me
And she's the only woman that would ever dare to love me
Respect from my peers, on the set 10 years
Bonafide so I hide my regrets and my fears
... On the front porch buzzin
High that's probably why I didn't even see 'em comin
5 rounds to the chest now I'm fightin for my life
Cause some fool from the other side, wanted stripes

If you from the hood then you just like me
Niggas kick in your door for a PS3
How the fuck do you expect me to be stress free?

Homeboy asked me if I been to the service
Standing on stage taking flicks got me nervous
All up in my face when I'm trying to be working
Sit your fat ass down behind that curtain
Bitch I'm from the land of the Bloods and the Crips
Niggas kill niggas just to fuck a bitch
You could lose your life for that busta shit
By the time I was nine, seen a bunch of shit
Lost more homies than a Iraq vet
Niggas skipping on groceries to buy that Tec
Lost a few friends to a rival set
And I'm still tryna process them side effects
Extra clips, extra clips
I see them niggas now when I'm set to trip
Gangbang party time, excellent
Not giving a fuck's a prerequisite
My testament is so trill
For the represent is so real
My residents got evidence I'm a legend in the ville
Pills to the crack game, stills in the rap game
Every nigga rapping tryna fill up that lane (gotta fill that lane)
Back to the backstage
Punk for the photo pass, 'bout to catch that fade
Fuck your badge
Now you wanna ask me why I'm so mad?
Get your ass beat for a photograph
Get the fuck out my dressing room 'fore I go bad
The homies laugh, I kept it moving
When they gon' learn that there's more to music
I do this shit so I could feed my kids
So they never have to know what a repo is
You really think you know how my people live?
You think you down because you know who Deebo is?
PTSD on my emo shit
Deep down in my heart, where the evil lives

Emptying the clip
You picked the wrong nigga to fuck with

I'm on some real time
Ain't no time to be dealing with these phony ass bitch boys
 my pocket and I stay with a

Used to push bricks, but now a nigga push bottles

Had a hood yelling ""bravo"" celebrating and whatnot
Happy cause he almost terrorizing the whole block
Breaking into homes, stealing anything they got
Nobody at his funeral, nobody cried a drop

These bitches wanna twerk, shake they booty

Epic Salutations,"Love & Rockets, Volume 1: The Transformation",2011.0,"Epic salutations
To all around the nation
Engaging in this form of energetic transformation
Hop on communication
The vibes we sending out
To all who thought the real was lost and had to live in doubt
I tried to finish out
I rarely replicate
Represented, reproduce my records at respected rates
Quality, quantity, qualified sonically
To coalite the classic catalog for the colony
Something like a pharmacy
Hardest dope I'm pushing out
This is something heavy for the stoners getting smoked out
Loc'd out, psycho, nitro-glycerin
Audio insulin for all of y'all that's listening
And you can listen in
While I'm tripping out
I'm Heaven bound, but I think I found a different route
A couple parsecs off of the main road
If you don't open up your mind then you can't go
I travel rainbows
Red, orange, yellow, green
Blue, indigo, violet, brightest lights you ever seen
Selassie of the posse
Making wine out of Rossi
Most high over money, Ted Dibiase
I take a million dollars
And gather all the scholars
To make a rocket ship out of old school Impalas
Ghetto interstellar west coast Cinderella
She riding shot gun and she rolling something hella
She passes it to me but I don't smoke is what I tell her
While I'm slanging moon rocks to these alien fellas
We 5,965 million
Miles away from Mars, among the stars, but I'm chilling
Laps around the sun, fingers rapped around a gun
And I'm shooting solar flares at your passengers for fun
That's how we have a good time on my planet
But you never came to visit, you didn't understand it
Take the boy out the hood, not the hood out of the rocket man
Trying to make the most out of this galaxy they lock me in
They can not box me in, I've traveled light years
Cartridges of courage cause we loaded up to fight fear
We might not win, but we never lose
With us or against us, you defenseless so you better choose
It's love or rockets dude
I use my rocket fuel to travel through the infinite and this is what I brought to you
Hardcore rap about nothing at all
Just some laser beams and quasars stuck in a jar
And this is all I've come up with so far
Living a lifetime on Earth and looking up at the stars",https://genius.com/Murs-epic-salutations-lyrics
Woke Up Dead,Have A Nice Life,2015.0,"Last night I had a dream that I woke up dead
A motherfucker put some money on my head
Cold sweat, wide awake in my bed
I guess I should've took my meds
I’m so sedated, self medicated
Hoping that the threats on my life are never predicated
If this is the price of fame, I should've hesitated
I don’t wanna die in the streets, I’m too educated
Type of shit you need a vest for
Type of shit that can’t be fixed with high test scores
Getting pressed more, as the fame builds
But my shrink keep prescribing me the same pills
Can’t kill a motherfucker just for lookin’ at me
Even though I know his ass is plottin’ when he lookin’ at me
Statute of limitations on a murder is
Non-existent. If I hit him, I’ll be serving years
 (x2)
This morning I woke up dead
Comatose, two shots to the head
Finally got me, that’s what they said
This morning I woke up dead

For years I've been having dreams that I get shot
Then them niggas go runnin’ up the block
Me and Terry just chillin’ at the spot
They pull up in the Cutlass, start bustin’, then I drop
Start running, I collapse on the corner
Neighbors start yellin’, somebody call the coroner
Standing over me, blood on my denim
Kinda like Omar did Snoop when he hit ‘em
Wreath wrapped up in blue ribbon
Nobody at the funeral, knew that I was Crippin’
Well I’m not, but on the block, who isn’t?
If you kick it on the spot, then it don’t make a difference
You can get shot just because you with 'em
And every cop thinkin’ that you fit the description
Gettin’ older as my life get’s shorter
Livin’ with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
 (x2)
This morning I woke up dead
Comatose, two shots to the head
Finally got me, that’s what they said
This morning I woke up dead

I asked my mama not to move up out the hood
She fucked around and she moved to Inglewood
And to her, everything is all good
‘Cause she doesn't understand, if she never understood
Niggas lookin’ at me all crazy
I’m standing on the corner with my baby
Ready for whatever, ‘cause that’s how the streets made me
Ain't a fuckin’ thing changed in this city since the ‘80s",https://genius.com/Murs-woke-up-dead-lyrics
Another Round,Captain California,2017.0,"She called first, then I called back
All the sudden feelings seem to resurface, in fact
I was on Cloud 9, I said ""It's about time""
I pulled up just to show you I was serious 'bout mine
You came to the car, and you came in the car
We didn't make it far, 'cause you was making it hard
To keep my hands off you
I wanted to talk too
I hate your ex, but I love the things that he taught you
Better than last time
Wetter than last time
Then went into the house to grab some drinks, it was half-time
Shaking my head, we went straight to the bed
Then started making so much noise, it's like we waking the dead
She said ""I never stopped feeling you, thought about killing you
Last time you left, it felt like my heart split in two""
I told her I'd fix her, didn't stop, I just kissed her
Put my head between her legs and showed her how much I missed her

And here we go for another round
It's like you build me up just to bring me down
When you broke my heart it didn't make a sound
Been through so much, I don't know if I could take it now

It's like I was made to love you (trouble)
Nobody can save me from you
One step closer, and I wanna go there
See you foreign sober, if you don't care
Let's go another round

I had to do it looking at the front door, then I finally had to walk through it
The main source of my joy and pain
They say that love fills the heart, but destroys the brain
Insane, crazy, thinking just maybe you would change your ways, but all you ever did was blame me
Like it's my fault that you had to cheat
Flipped the conversation all 'a sudden, now you mad at me
Three in the morning and you ain't come over yet?
It's like the nice guys always get the most disrespect
Your phone die? You didn't see my text?
See, I already know what you 'bout to say next
""Sex was so amazing that I didn't want to leave a fam""
It takes more than sex if you really wanna keep a man
Quicksand, when I struggle it gets deeper
And before I ever leave her, I would rather meet the reaper, damn

And here we go for another round
It's like you build me up just to bring me down
When you broke my heart it didn't make a sound
Been through so much, I don't know if I could take it now

It's like I was made to love you (trouble)
Nobody can save me from you

Gods Gone Crazy,Yumiko: Curse Of The Merch Girl,2012.0,"2012 the Mayan disaster
Keep one eye on your government the other on your pastor
Religious folks live in fear of the rapture
Me, I'm just thinking about what's going to happen after
Do we begin a new chapter?
Do I get to face off with God like Castor?
Will he answer all my questions?
Fully take my suggestions?
The reverend said never question, have faith
A man without faith is worthy of god's hate
But if god feels emotion is he safe to trust?
And if god does hate then does he hate us?
So much pain and suffering
So many people struggling but still have love for him
A miracle in and of itself
Living in poverty with spiritual wealth
It's hard not to be amazed by that
So do you live your life on faith or based on fact?
Was god watching when they shot my homie dead
In front of the church in the back of his head?
With that said, I'm still alive making bread
So I'm guessing its a blessing that his daughters stay fed
When things go bad then the devil gets the cred
But when everything is right it goes to god instead
Or is there even just one
A god of the sea and a god of the sun
We frown on polytheism
But in our schools we still teach Greek wisdom
What about the Egyptians?
They served many gods while charting the solar system
Are the gods just selfish?
Or too busy to help us?
Was Olympus just one big club
Where the gods got to party and the mortals got snubbed?
Are we just pawns to be pitied
While they play a divine game of vice city?
Are they really all the same?
Just one god with a bunch of different names
Who's to praise it and who's to blame?
To whom goes the glory and to whom the shame?
An Israeli walks into a masjid
AK 47 in hand blastin
Murder many while they were making salah
Turned around and left the temple, he was shot
Is Allah not victorious?
Is Yahweh not glorious?
Is it a sin to be curious?
The way religious separates us all makes me furious
We're at war, we're the half of the unseen
So much blood on our hands, we are unclean
Murdering in the name of your god is still murder
Call it crusade or jihad, it's still murder
Who deserves the right to decide
Whether one human being lives or it dies?
Is it in the eyes of a holy man?
A pedophile that's protected by the Vatican
So sick and self righteous
How can you place your faith in men like this?
When none of us knows for sure
And that's what makes a man of faith so pure
Never debate with such difficult men
It soon becomes a battle of invisible friends
When none of us will know until the end
And when you're gone you can't come back to tell your friends
You won't know until it's too late
Wasting time stressing guessing Armageddon's due date
I won't worship a god that hates
That won't support the right to abort after rape
Did we really come from apes?
Did the earth just take 6 days to create?
He rested on the 7th, I'mma rest on this
Without our belief then god don't exist
Is anybody out there?
Do the gods even care?
Are they even aware?
Or are they just caught up in their own affairs?
Is anybody out there?
Do the gods even care?
I swear it's just not fair
All I have is my doubt and some unanswered prayers
Yeah but basically man, I'm not trying, like, to get in anybody's faith or nothing. But why battle me over something none of us can prove? It's not like math. It's not a fucking science. It's literally your faith, so keep your faith and live a good life and leave me the fuck alone
Have the gods gone crazy?
Honestly yo it wouldn't amaze me
Cause with all I've seen lately
I've started thinking just maybe
Maybe they have lost their minds
Or are we just living at the end of times?
They say it's part of some grand design
Sometimes I be thinking that it's all in our minds
Have the gods gone crazy?
Honestly yo it wouldn't amaze me
Cause with all I've seen lately
I've started thinking just maybe
Maybe they have lost their minds
Or are we just living at the end of times?
They say it's part of some grand design
Sometimes I be thinking that it's all in our minds
Your holy books can't save me
The gods have gone crazy
The gods have gone crazy
The gods have gone crazy
Tell your pastor come debate me
The gods have gone crazy
The gods have gone crazy
The gods have gone crazy",https://genius.com/Murs-gods-gone-crazy-lyrics
Vows,A Strange Journey Into the Unimaginable,2018.0,"So you told me that you didn't want a card, or you didn't want a generic ass card so
I had to write somethin' in a card
But, instead of writin' something in a card  I wrote this

I met you on the road at a show in a small town
Who'da thought we'd be at where we are now
Never thought I'd be the type to find romance
Back in the day I was the dude who had no chance
Girls in school used to say no to slow dance
Dream was to find a girl like you so we could hold hands
And now we standin' at the alter
Quite a rocky road just to get to this part, huh?
I'm a Pisces, I went back and forth
You a Sagittarius, connected at the source
I was married and divorced  and you stayed away of course
Now it's ten years later and we're one with the force
Time got lost and we fell off track
You'd try some of this and I'd try some of that
But when love is the law, then the law is attract
Picked up the pieces now we back, back, back
On the scene, crispy and clean
Got a text from my ex, but she can't intervene
She seen the pictures of you on my socials
Then she went through the roof and went postal
But we finally made peace now I'm hopeful
'Cause I ain't got time for the loco
I take that back, 'cause I'm crazy 'bout you
That's why we exchangin' vows and I'm saying ""I do""

Do you take...
To be your lawfully wedded...
To have and to hold...
For better or for worse...
From this day forward...
For richer or for poorer...
'Til death do you part
I do

And if I say it's more than physical
Lie like I don't love it when I'm stickin' my dick in you
Just the tip, just the tip
You might make an honest man out a crip
And this is it, this is it
It's about to be the very last time I commit
I'm goin' down with the ship
So if you ever try to leave me you'll be one dead bitch
J-K, J-K, L-O-L
'Cause next time I see your pops, he'll probly tell me ""Go to hell""
Oh well, if I should go prematurely
It's just like all them other nights you had me comin' early
See, you laugh at all my jokes and shit
The type of stuff that other folks might deem inappropriate
So we eloped and got hitched
The ceremony was dope, it went like this

Do you take...
To be your lawfully wedded...
To have and to hold...
For better or for worse...
From this day forward...
For richer or for poorer...
'Til death do you part
I do

You put the seed in the hole, and the hole in the ground
The green grass grows and the belly gets round
And I found that the apple's not far from the tree
If we have another son, I hope he looks like me
Hope he has your heart, your style and your smile
And yeah it hit us hard when we lost our first child
Devastating, but it only brought us closer
We stuck together like a team is supposed to
I know them vultures they was talkin' shit, they was hatin'
For us to lie down and quit, yeah they was waitin'
We kept pushin', we expectin' again
And we ain't got time for them so called friends
Us against whomever, up against whatever
Just need that Rev Run, 'cause we tougher than some leather
Fake leather, 'cause you know with both Vegan
But if you ever said these vows, then you understand the meaning

Do you take...
To be your lawfully wedded...
To have and to hold...
For better or for worse...
From this day forward...
For richer or for poorer...
'Til death do you part
I do
A little piece of me
A little piece of you
Hopin' we can see it through
Hopin' we can see it through
I wrote this one for me and you
A little piece of me
A little piece of you
Hopin' we can see it through
Said I'm hopin' we can see it through
I wrote this one for me and you
A little piece of me
A little piece of you
Hopin' we can see it through
Said I'm hopin' we can see it through

Undefeated
Private parking
There ain't no walk of shame
Got that guard at the gate, there ain't no stalker games
And if she don't got brains
Then she don't got game
She's sucking dick for bottle service that's so fucking lame
 {x2}
I've 'bout mo' Taylor Swift than Beyonce
Don't need no meat on my entree
I guarantee what my rhymes say
Mos definitely that's Dante
Mos Def my nigga that's Dante
Mos definitely that's Dante
Mos Def my nigga
Mos definitely
Mos Def my nigga that's Dante

She got a Fat Booty
I'm so ecstatic
She got that New World Water, what's the Mathematics?
True Magic
She newly tatted
Plus she keep a head wrap
Erykah Badu status
Conscious flow
Fuck you obnoxious hoes
I want a chick with some knowledge and some perfect toes
That mani/pedi game gotta be righteous
Cross fit put a fat ass on white chick
Do them squats girl
And rap
Zero carbs, paleo she ain't got no fat
A strong woman?
That's The New Danger
Real niggas love her
Bitch niggas gotta hate her


She got a Fat Booty
It's black and tan
Coming straight outta Brazil, now I'm a Travellin' Man
Selfies in the mirror, looking healthy from the rear
She the type that got me on a flight twice a year
I say ""Brigada.""
She say ""De nada.""
Portuguese and Spanish, "", hold my enchilada.""
I wish Cube fucked J.Lo in Anaconda
So my black mamba could hit Sofia Vergara
Colombiana
Zoe Saldana
Watching 8thstreetlatinas, that's my favorite genre
But love my Black Star, she the X rated kind
Brown Skin Lady, if you ask her she won't say she mind

I want my people to be
To be, to be
I want my black people to be
To be, to be
I want my people to be
To be, to be
I want my people to be
To be, to be free

Skatin’ Through the City,Have A Nice Life,2015.0,"Way before Lupe, before O.F
I've been tryna ollie off the front porch steps
Crept through Lynwood, my city was not calm
Headed to South Gate, tryna see Mark Gon-zalez
I'm a novice tryna ollie the curb
If you're looking for some rocks then you can probably get served
Not by me, the homies up at the park
I thought I was Eazy-E, I swore I was Tony Hawk
Mark's getting jumped over colors, some real shit
Anyone fuck with us, we fuck him up real quick
Move to Covina in the SGV
That's where I'm at, my homie Tempie and my man Jeff D
Me, my little brother in rhyme, we used to steal shit
Claiming E-dub, so far from the realness
Back in Midtown I'm surrounded by real Crips
All I wanna do is smoke and skate on some chill shit
So much to deal with, riding that blue bus
I stay doing my thang, not giving two fucks
Had a couple tussles, got respect from my peers
Now they all leave me alone saying ''Cuz just weird''
 (x2)
Skatin' through the city like I own this bitch
In and out of traffic like I won't get hit
Stay the fuck out my lane when I'm on that shit
Skatin' through the city like I own this bitch

Still pushin' mongo nigga, I don't give a fuck
Me and the homies in the back of a pick-up truck
We skate pitches on fake bitches
Hoping that one day we blow up and make riches
Bending corners on my independence
Longboard or penny board, I handle business
I ain't trickin', I ain't tryna go pro
Really it's the quickest way to get to the sto', oh
You hear Wrek in the background
It ain't weird to ride a skateboard if you black now
Cubans in Miami and Chicanos in Watts
Meet up at the McDonalds then head out to the spot
Hella skate parks, no more runnin' from cops
You don't stop cause you're old, you get old cause you stop
Rest in peace Jay Adams and shout-out the homie block
Used to never go to Venice 'cuz I thought I'd get shot

Murs Day,Murray’s Revenge,2006.0,"Whattup though?
Murs, 9th Wonder
Murray's Revenge!
Y'all know what time it is
Shut your fat.. nah
Watch your mouth and lower your tone and keep your hand on that cell phone
We back

Now my day in the sun has come, the one chosen
To break up the ice that got the rap world frozen
Speak that slang that'll heat up the game
Now, roll down your window turn the beat up, it bang
... Feelin the breeze
Let the world know they still makin real MC's
So please, make a call, tell your friend, tell the hood
That we back and revenge never sounded so good
Questionin' 9th about choppin vocal samples
I chop you in your throat 'til you choke on the answer
Nice with this mic since I was broke and handsome
'Til I get my respect I'm holdin dope for ransom
From the West coast, everything I flow's an anthem
A&R's who slept are now throwin a tantrum
Hand 'em over boys, your jewels and your girls
Bow down to the sound cause ""Murs Rules the World""
... I'm better than your favorite rapper
But it don't take much these days for you to master the mic
Most of these rappers trapped in the hype
They makin whole albums, only half of it's tight
So they never really have an impact on your life
That's why 
3:16
 was genius
We all connected through this ""Minstrel Show"" man, I mean it
Until my days end I'm gettin paid my friend
Without pimpin my soul, the gangster limpin was old
So I ""Walk Like a Man"" and, talk to my fans
Clocked a few grand but you gotta understand
I got a little money and I, coulda bought a chain
But my momma woulda killed me, simple and plain
Exchange foreign currency, for legal tender
Now I'm back to end the era of the great pretender
So pull your pants up and, turn that noise down

Rhymesayers, minors to the majors
Stomp around a bird cage full of papers
Point lasers at the neighbors
Ever since the clock got punched on my first day of labor
Ain’t no shame in my game’s wagers
Spectator on the side catch a mouth full of flavor
Wasted, tryna walk a line like equator
Fuck the po-po, we blow dro with the mayor
Do me a favor, raise up away from my space
Out my face, occupy a different acre
Leak like a strainer, poisoned by the waiter
Drown in the dirt, eat a fuck for a chaser
Pardon me Barbie, this ain’t a party for you Kramer
Marking me the maker if I spark up the anger
Minneapple-bang, Twin Cities rap sanger

CES, Murs, Strange, we wrote the book

We get the place jumping
They ask Ubi to say something
He spat and they got nothing but flames from him
Raised up in the ring, stuck in a state of perpetual busting 8s off of puffing that dank
A runaway train off of the track, rocket attack
Roadside bomb blast, y’all talking in back, what?
The blizzard black coffin is shut, human assassin
Sarcophagus and a tomb, due to get wrapped up
I’m doing the MAC strut, rose grew in the black mud
Rap guns, I hold two, move and I pap one
Flow’s closed captioned, my text on the screen
Everything CES doing they affecting the scene
I’m repping with Dean, Killer City record machine
116 pounds anorexic to me, so get your weight up

Shadowboxing until clear channel mandates us, what?

Pray they melt, in a fire of hell, they might as well
All these students Zach Morris, well they saved by the bell
Said I’m psycho, made me a cell outside of the jail
Yeah I might glow, all because of my ghost in its shell
New millennium rap serpent, serving em with the venom
I’m the black mamba, you notice I’m murdering em
Then I’m up in them guts, pussy pardon me for the slaughter
Throw a hex on a bitch before I lead her to water
Oughta be, chained up in a cage, I’m in a rage
Eat a dick, bitch idiot,

Party crashing, straight through the window
Back in the days that bouncer stole my Nintendo
Insufficient funds when they printing out my balance
Never sold my soul but I rented out my talents
What about the girls? Save something for the girls
For a chance to push your lips, I would promise you the world
Midtown crook from the Ave. Meadow brooks
Broke the little ladys’ heart with just one look

1000 Suns,Captain California,2017.0,"What up, my name is Nick, they call me Murs though
Hate to stare but you was lookin' at me first though
So?
I ain't hearin' it
You ain't got a ring, then he probably not that serious
And I'm just curious, if you feel what I feel
Now she lookin' down at the ground so I know it's real
Don't know what to say, she bumped my tray and made my soda spill
You don't gotta mark your territory girl, that's overkill
I was already head over heels from your appeal
Now forget the napkin, I'mma have to show my poet skills
Roses are red, uh
Violets are blue
I've never been in a fight but I'll be violent for you
Tried and I'm true
Why would I be lyin' to you?
Type of dime that caught the eye of every guy in my crew
Diamond for you
Next I'm in a tie and a suit
After I dropped to one knee like I was tyin' my shoe
Sayin' I do

Like a thousand explodin' suns
My heart burns you're the only one
They said the odds were a million to none
That I would finally discover the one
Someone to be my best friend and have fun
Ooh girl, you're makin' my Adrenalin run
I know our journey here's only begun
The job of loving you will never be done

Fast forward
Ten years later
Got a couple princesses and a young pro skater
Could've waited but I went for it first night
Got ya fat, badges in the chat, MursHype
I'm the type to see what I wanna go for
When I first got you pregnant, didn't have the dough for it
But I hustled for it, just like Hov did
Now we got 3, but we got enough for 4 kids
I'm just kidding girl, you know I know we done with that
Tried to name all our kids after Thundercats
She wasn't havin' it, we settled on the X-Men
Now everyday is Comic-con with my best friends
Whole house full of weirdos
Plus she let my beard grow
If I haven't told you lately, lady you're my hero
My Spider-Gwen, my Wonder Woman, you're my Captain Marvel
My everything, my yesterday, today and tomorrow

Like a thousand explodin' suns
My heart burns you're the only one
They said the odds were a million to none
That I would finally discover the one
Someone to be my best friend and have fun
Ooh girl, you're makin' my Adrenalin run
I know our journey here's only begun
The job of loving you will never be done

She loves me, but I love her more
Left the block and fell in love with the girl next door
She loves me, but I love her more
Left the block and fell in love with the girl next door
I said
She loves me, but I love her more
Left the block and fell in love with the girl next door
She loves me, but I love her more
Left the block and fell in love with the girl next door

Soon as I get home from tour
She in a robe, naked at the front door
See-through silk with no drawers, from the kitchen to the shower to the bedroom floor
Soon as I finished she was beggin' for more
Been waitin' two months, I was ready for war
And we be goin' at it so hardcore
'Till the kids come knockin' on the bedroom door

She like California sunshine
I wrote a song for her one time
Everyday is like sunshine
I wrote this song for her one time
She like California sunshine
Wrote a song for her one time
Everyday is like sunshine

The Strangest,Have A Nice Life,2015.0,"I hope y'all motherfuckers glad I came
Strange Music won't ever be the same

""Ask-ask-ask-ask-why I'm the strangest""
""Better bang this""

What up though? It's Murs
This boom bap shit for all the Strangers
Let's go
Curtiss King on the beats
You know who that is on the hook

Straight out the underground into the mainstream
The California kid cliqued up with the Strange team
Swing like a couple hundred swords when I say things
Crowned in this rap Game of Thrones, I remain king
Fire breathing lyrics hotter than Khaleesi is, burn 'em
Now your favorite rapper's hotter than he think he is
- - - - -  Fill in the Dylan reference
The game ain't been the same since the icon left us
A stand up dude but ain't shit funny
When they say you ain't the greatest cause you ain't getting money
But back when I was broke I was doper than most of 'em
Known to grab the microphone snap like I broke something
Rappers coming at me, gun's blazing won't smoke nothing
They need to turn them into journalists trying to quote something
Murder they careers, I'm America's most wanted
Sprinklin' their ashes on a blunt, yelling, ""Smoke something.""


A lot of rappers say they different but they sound the same
Run around bite each others style without an ounce of shame
Me, I've been Strange before the dreadlocks grew out
Dropped the major labels, shook the liquor, took a new route
Clones attack the radio, so I align with the rebels
Underground recording in the basement of the devil
But rhyme at God level, I'm superior yet similar
People say they peep the DNA and see my signature
Menace throwing mics, I treat rap like its sacred
Young conscious brothers still trapped in The Matrix
Offer me the red or blue, I went and took the purple pill
Trippin it 'til Tech and Trav offered me the perfect deal
Now worth a mil, I work to kill for the snake and bat
Fans see the skill and beat is real, ain't no faking that
Take it back to '91, go platinum with the beads on
Back to resurrect this rap culture that they sleep on


We made !Mursday! the world favorite holiday
Thank you based God, namaste
Hallelujah, hope the lord is with you all the way
Hope you Have A Nice Life is what I'm trynna say
A million angels got my back, born from L.A
So you should really watch your mouth with what you trynna say
Since my last video I heard I'm kinda gay
I just ate my wife pussy, I'm OK
Nowadays everybody wanna share they song
Music ain't worth the megabytes that they shared it on
Rapping on the same track, them niggas went to Paris on
Get a couple clicks on Soundcloud and they swear they on
They ain't got the stamina to carry on
Can't sprint to the finish, it's a marathon
A year later, lookin' 'round like where they gone?
Disappear like panties on Nikki, when she wear a thong",https://genius.com/Murs-the-strangest-lyrics
Slob My Nob,MURS Rules the World,2000.0,"I would like to dedicate this song
To every girl who's sucked my dick ""thank you""
And from the bottom of my heart, girls I really mean that shit
All praises to your lips, for the many nights of bliss
I mean you gotta love somebody who puts their mouth where you piss
It's like this
Shit I would do it if I could
But girl you know I'd break my back tryin' to polish my own wood
So it's, all to the good girl, do it like a gee-o
You got them kinda lips that make nigga slap his P.O.,
Although I don't have one
If that's what you need, to keep you on your knees
Please believe you'll catch a bad one
Go back to what I said
I dedicate this song to every girl who's gave me head
Especially the ones
Who knew it was time to swallow without a word being said
And didn't get mad if I didn't give a warning
She just put it down her hatch, and kept on performing
You know, rockin' the mic, cleanin' the pipes
Or if she's a real head doctor she might say sumpt'n like
""Oh, fuck my face! I wanna see how I taste!""
Huh, and when the homies call
""Uhh, What up, though""
I simply let 'em know that Agent Scully's on the case
And hella broads be fake
Talkin' bout they don't swallow, they don't like how it tastes
I say it's no home trainin'
Kinda like leaving a table before you clean your plate
I wasn't born with this shit it took twelve years to make
And you gonna let it go to waste? ""hell no"" let me put it all in place
You put in all this work you might as well finish the race
C'mon, you don't leave work early on pay day
You get your check before you walk so go ahead
And jack the magic beans right up out the stalk
Then plant 'em down your throat, who knows
The next day your freestyles might be dope
Nope! I'm just kiddin' ""FUCK A NON-SWALLOW TRAMP!""
This song is a tribute to the cock suckin' champs
The deap throat divas with jaws like clamps
Lickin' ball like stamps, even when she's got the cramps
That's a No Limit Soldier, True Master of the P
But I make 'em say AHHH when I'm servin' ghetto D
I love the oral OG's, with rings in their tongue, shit I had to tell this one
You should move it to your tonsils cuz a niggas well hung
Huh, naaahh; I kill me, but check it out, feel me
I had this one broad who used to go at the job
Like a woman with no teeth versus corn on the cob
Wanted to stop her half way just to say good job
So if you got a girl and she dont slob your knob
I'm here to let your stupid ass know that your bein' robbed
And your dame is tired
Tell her to step into your office - ""YOUR FUCKIN' FIRED!""
And if by the next album, she's still not suckin'
I'mma make a new song with step by step instructions
Easy for her ass to follow, the moral of the story is
The mean bitches suck and the nice girls swallow
I said mean bitches suck and nice girls swallow
""Oooh, oooh, oooh! I knew I knew ya. Damn it to hell
I knew your face looked familiar to me. Man, back in the day
Your wife could suck the MEANEST
Well I know you know, you a lucky man.""
""You scum sucking son of a bitch!!!
That's my ho you talk..uh, my wife you talkin' bout!""
""Oooh, oooh, oooh! Now I remember
I even remember your name!
They used to call you Jawbone!""
""Aaaghhhh!!!""",https://genius.com/Murs-slob-my-nob-lyrics

Black g bags we can play what we wanna play
From this day, its only the exotic
Who'da thought this would blossom outta somethin so platonic
Used to sell chronic, young entrepenuer
You hustled in the streets while i did it on tours
From the whole rap world and our love behind doors
Like under baggy clothes you hid your allure
But i saw to the core and had to be yours
Come with me out on this journey ain't no askin what for
Whats more?
I know you feel the same way
So follow your heart forget what your brain say
Im a main stay on this temporary voyage
Bring your luggage and your baggage
Our past will destroy us
Fresh from the carosel
Love ain't a ferris wheel
Once we reach our peak we'll never descend
I love you to the finest angel to that heaven can send
I wanna hold you in my arms and never pretend
That our love ain't workin we was better as friends
I know it never works for others but we better than them =)
Cause in just one night we shared so much
You spoke and i listened but we didn't dare touch
Its been a couple months you never called to say whats up
So ill put it in this song when you hear it hit me up
Come with me lets take a trip to
Where we could get to
To open up our hands and let time slip through
I always know that i would get you
And now that im with you
Ain't no drama and no problems in the world i can't get through
I wanna know who could love you like this
Who really loves you? who could love you like this?
I wanna know who could love you like this.. i wanna know",https://genius.com/Murs-love-you-like-this-lyrics

Cigarettes and liquor

Run out and get your

Everybody's spending on

I got twenty little soldiers lined up in a row
What you want one homie? Man, psst, here you go
Killing myself, might as well kill you
Matter of fact, second thought, go ahead and take two
My hands and my breath smelling like straight doo doo
A couple years from now I'm gonna sound like Guru
I don't know what to do
I really need to quit
Teeth so yellow they could butter up some grits
I can't quit, it's the celebrity and fame
The stress and the strain from the whole rap game
Look, I know it's lame, but what's your excuse man?
Credit card, rent late, wife found a new man?
I understand, we all got our problems
You kill yourself slowly and you hope that'll solve 'em
It's in my genes man, my family tree
My mother smoke, my father smoke, they handed it to me
My little brother, he been smoking since the fourth grade
Smoke a stress blunt, then he chase it with some E&J
Drinking and smoke and it might stunt your growth
But he's 6'4"" and he's been doing both
So smoke all you want, go cigarette crazy
When cancer get your ass, don't go cryin' like a baby
Cause chemo radiation man, it ain't no fun
You better get your ass the patch or some Nicorette gum


Now have you ever been faded, intoxicated
Woke up at the crib and wonder how you made it?
Late to the job cause you so faded
You walk in at noon and try to masquerade it
Like, ""Aw man, I'm feeling under the weather.""
But your co-workers laughing cause they all know better
You got a hangover, and shit it ain't over
Not quite drunk, but you sure ain't sober
Weekend warrior, should have ate your Wheaties
Sunday Night Fever gave your ass the B.G's
The bubble guts, stomach all doubled up
Head feeling like you caught a Mike Tyson uppercut
You fucking up, get your shit together
You can't keep doing this bullshit forever
Running to the bathroom every five minutes
Every time that you throw up, you claiming that you finished
Then you swear you bout to quit
But as soon as Friday come, it's time to get lit
Tequilla shots, lemon drops, dancing on the table tops
You know when you're really drunk? (When?)
When you say you're not
""I ain't faded, why is everybody tripping?""
Pulled your dick out on the dance floor and started pissing
And you call yourself a grown man
You one step away from a twelve step program",https://genius.com/Murs-cigarettes-and-liquor-lyrics

But that's not me, I try to keep it lowkey

Now I know they all hatin', but I'm tired of the waitin
Gotta get it baby girl right now
Montague Piru and a Crip Capulet
Knew that we would start a war but I had no regrets
Madly in love so we had mad sex
But for some strange reason didn't get a last text
Wanna fake her death
A plan so clever
When it all settled down we would run away together
But I never got a text, so when I saw her dead I pulled the trigger on my pistol and I pointed at my head
When she woke up and saw I blew my brains out
She picked up the pistol and she went the same route
Star-crossed lovers shinin' bright in the afterlife
Still holdin' hands when they found us on that tragic night

I won't tell nobody, This could stay between us

Fingers on triggers that never go bang
Gang gang gang gang
Gang gang gang gang
Faking like they felons
But they do it for the fame
Ain't no Crips in Calabasas where they tell you that they hang
Say from a hood but got no turf to claim
Liar liar, watch they pants burst into flames
Aiming at the stars, false prophets and celebreties
Chop em all down with my murderous melodies

Burn it down Babylon
Running is decathalon
Paying never show they work

Faith without that shit
Ape shit, bat shit

Please deliver from me from

All who would wish me ill

You are my sword and shield

This is that divine speech
Careful 'cause the rhyme is heat
Might burn your virgin ears
Down to the white meat
Motherfuck a Hype Beast
Critics tryna slight me
Fight me, fight me, fight me, fight me
Fight me if you're man enough
Never had the stamina
You're barely even standing up
Nigga way too Xanied up
You could spit that candy stuff
While we raise to stand it up
Burn up in that Laker fire or you come and stand with us

Dear Lord
Please deliver from me from
All who would wish me ill
You are my sword and shield

Living Legend,MURS Rules the World,2000.0,"(scratching ""Livin' Legend"")

Watch me blow the top off of mics
When I rock it don't stop
Like the burnin' sensation when I drop off this mic
Can't stop this for life
The rappin' that is
If I came wack, it'd hurt me more than it'd hurt y'all
Like when parents slap their kids
What's about to happen is
(Nah, what had happened was)
I started making up these tapes, stackin' up my buzz
Rackin' up these dubs, steady packin up the clubs
Is there any other crew who does it quite like us?
Do they make 'em rush the floor?
Ya see that's what counts
Like a club DJ throwin' on More Bounce
And y'all know how we do it over here in L.A
Everybody and they mamma ?
And I say what I mean when I put it in a verse
Rhymes like ? your words would snatch a purse
From a blind senior citizen
You know the wack shit like Bob Denver known as Gilligan, I'm killin' 'em
Facin' twenty-five to life if I touch a pen again
So I thought I might quit, but then I thought again
At least I'm dyin' for a cause instead of Benjamins, uhh


Now I rock velour jumpsuits, no shirt on
Tryin' to get my flirt on, throwin' hurt on the mic
Like white on rice, 
Platinum on ice
. dots on dice
You may know some dope niggas and they may be polite but they not this nice
I got twice what they do
Imagine evertything they wrote and at the top a little two
He gon' have to spit a few if I only spit one
You mess with sixteen bars, I'm simply bar none, far from ordinary
Even by my fuckin' milk from the Legendary
Fairy dust M.C.s, time to get your wings clipped
When you're playin' Mr. Tough and you're sweet as Pixie Stix
Your fans, they suck it up, the truth must be exposed
I jump on stage and fuck em up
Jabroni's never stand a chance against rap entertainment's most electrifying man
Mics short circuit soon as they touch my hands
Sell my music on the streets to stay in touch with my fans
Man, my crew can't be beat!
We got this thing locked like the door on a white lady's automoblie
When she sees me cross the street
Flat out truth when I speak
With no time for plateaus I keep striving for the peak until I go insane
And it's as plain as the clothes on an undercover cop
That I got a fan base that'll never stop growing, been around for a while
And for y'all who not knowin...
And for y'all who not knowin' I'm a",https://genius.com/Murs-living-legend-lyrics
The Women of Scribble Jam,Scribble Jam Volume 2,UnKnown," 
Aye man. Yeah, man why don't you battle me man?
I heard you like, freestyle and stuff
Yo, man. I ain't tryin' to do no broads
Ayo, A-Train. Yo, A-Train, give me a beatbox man, c'mon
 
Murs change crews but he should change shoes
Quick, cause his girlfriend stinks when I kiss her
He probably brush his teeth with wood grain glue. stick
Hey Murs, what you think of me mister?

You finished? Yeah, great
Man find me a date
How come you never get me laid when I'm in your state?
Man, I have blue balls, so fuck a blue tape
I'm tryin' to find a b-girl that wanna to eat a tube steak

Cause they're all vegetarians and don't chew meat
They're rather have a Kansas City tofu treat
Or they're pregnant in the kitchen and they're pushin' out my babies
Battle me, quit lookin' at the ladies

But did you see that chick with my CD in her hand? (No)
I hope I'm the reason that she came to Scribble Jam
To watch the MC Battle while we hold hands
Wait, she's talkin' to Pace, hope I still gotta chance

Pace gets girls that ain't even in your roll call
Your beard looks like pubic hair on a troll doll
Those girl lines are from sixth grade son
I got 99 lines but a bitch ain't one
Hit me

Ohhh, that was vicious
Man, look at these bitches
Adidas sweatpants, tank tops so delicious
Man I'm out of town, it might not sound right
But fuck it, I might eat a little pussy tonight

Yo, we clash like Japaneses and American cinema
Little Murs practically, get a ?
So hey young homie, you look gay in Velcro
Probably masturbate to the Dave Chapelle show

The skyline chilly met a fly young Phillie
Asked if she was on the menu just tryin' to be silly
She smiled and she laughed so I had to ask her out
We fucked the shit out of each other on Mr. Dibb's couch

 It happens once a year in the city of Cinci
It's called Scribble Jam, a hip hop frenzy
 Some come for the shows
 Some come for the hoes
 But what happens on the road
 Stays on the road
 
My first time was last summer, fell in love with this shit
Never seen so many cute hip hop chicks
First night at Top Cats caught one that was thick
Aye Mac, you listenin' or still poppin' that shit?

Well I live to pop shit when I rap at Scribble Jam
And you, you're like Juice's sacrificial lamb
My mom even thinks you rap cheesy
Cause Shock G had the best verse on your last CD

Cause Your +Mom Iz A Thug+ and she'll fuck me up
Man, I'm tryin' to lay back and get sucked up
Shut the fuck up cause you really don't know me
That's how you got that black eye to go with that trophy

But I pawned that trophy like a Hanzo sword
Fuck it I don't wanna battletalk no more
Cause battle rap careers
Well usually they end
So Murs introduce me to your friends

Them two right there, drove in from Miama
The short one's Misha, the tall one Tammy
Get your mind of the mic and tell me which one you like
Should have done this with Slug but he was booked for the night

Naw, Slugs always drunk, talkin' at the after party
Give me Tammy in the Hollisters & Ambercrombie
And while you sittin' there talkin' to Misha
I'mma get us four shots of Tequilla
Sit tight

Man, tonight is the night I think I found my wife
Diggin' through them records over there to the right
The way her thongs stickin' up out her pants got me grinnin'
Hey Mac

What?

I only come to Scribble Jam for the women

Murs, you were right
I just found a diva with a dark muddy mind a purse full of spikes
All up in the rental van with my vixen
I only come to Scribble Jam for the women


 Ha ha ha. No doubt that was awesome
These girls are hot man. I'm glad you turned me onto them

Midtown,A Strange Journey Into the Unimaginable,2018.0,"Before Que went away for that bank shit
Before the hipsters moved in on that fake shit
I'm from Midtown without the gang politics
Jefferson to Pico, I represent for all of it
Mexicans and niggas know, I been letting niggas know
Screaming Cloverdale before I let the fuckin trigger go
But I let the trigger go, fuck being a criminal
Still rolling with some shiesty, hustlin' individuals
Bend the law till it almost break
Man y'all always 10 deep, nigga y'all so fake
That's why I don't bring the homies to alot of my shows
Can't be responsible when they start to throwin' blows
Can't stop real niggas from doing what they gotta do
My homies like to trip, talk shit, and wear alot of blue
Nowadays everybody on some different shit
Got the head up out the hood, the future's unlimited

It's on Pico everyday
Where OG stroll memory lane
Y'all niggas try to never just go
When the feets right up at your door

My nigga I'm from midtown
I'm from midtown
Homie I'm from midtown where they love to get down
Homie I'm from midtown
My nigga I'm from midtown
Homie, I'm from midtown where they love to get down
Homie, I'm from midtown, get down

Before Nipsey bought World on Wheels
Back when the little homes on the block had no chill (what up?)
I'm from midtown, roots in that asphalt
One of many roses push they way through them cracks y'all
That's what Pac said, yeah that's what Pac said
Piercing police tried to kill me, I am not dead
Before the grace of God, there go I
That means I could've been any of the homies that died
Guided by the most high, I am so far from worthless
I survive, I am present with a purpose
If only to make you nervous
And challenge status quo, I have done my service
Ay man, ay man, ay man, ay man
When I tell you where I'm from, what you gotta say then
I suggest that you respect my pride
Anything less, the whole set gon' ride

It's on Pico everyday
Where OG stroll memory lane
Y'all niggas try to never just go
When the feets right up at your door

I'm from midtown
Homie I'm from midtown where they love to get down
Homie I'm from midtown
My nigga I'm from midtown
Homie I'm from midtown where they love to get down
Homie I'm from midtown, get down

Hey look, man I know, that this beat is gangster as fuck
But I'm not, and I never have been
I'm all about peace and love and unity
And this song is about my dream and how
My whole career I just wanted everyone to get along
Man I know everybody from midtown from somewhere different
We don't all get along
But if we don't get it together you all
They about take this whole shit right out from under us
So yall don't gotta fuck with them niggas over there
But don't fuck with them niggas over there
You know what I'm saying?
It's about being at peace with yourself
And once you're at peace with yourself
Then you can be at peace with everybody else
And that doesn't mean we gotta shake hands and hang out and shit
But we gotta stop killing each other

Love,Yumiko: Curse Of The Merch Girl,2012.0,"What up doe? It's your boy Murs. And on behalf of Josh Blaylock, Jose Garcia and my homie Foundation...we'd like to welcome you...to Yumiko: Curse Of The Merch Girl. Huh. Welcome

In the beginning, the pages are void
The story here begins with a girl and a boy
Everything was bliss every moment was in joy
Never once thinkin' that it'd all be destroyed
But this boy had a band and this band had a buzz
They played a lot of local spots and rocked at every club
The girls around town thought that Dom was a scrub
But she saw Dom for the star that he was
Supported everything Dom did to the fullest
Stay when she shouldn't even put up with his bullshit
That's because she knew that he was brilliant
And even if he never made a million
He'd still be the father of her children
Nothing could come between them and the future they were buildin'
And pretty soon a record deal was in the works
But he told her not to worry she would always come first

And ain't love just beautiful?
Especially when the person's brand new to you
Before the bullshit that they put you through
They have you runnin' 'round doin' things you don't usually do
And ain't love just grand?
The true bond between a woman and a man
That brief time right before you understand
That this motherfucker's selfish and they don't give a damn
And ain't love so special?
Till them hard times start to test you
Now all they ever do is stress you
But started off tryin' real hard to impress you
And ain't love the shit?
Especially when you don't know who you fuckin' with
Soon as they violate your trust you're sick
So you throw it all away like ""fuck this shit""

The bus pulled up, the biggest they ever seen
Their first real tour, something right out a dream
Dom brought his girl she was part of the team
Besides, where would a king be without his queen?
And the crew didn't mind, she was around all the time
And separating the two of them would definitely be a crime
She cooks and she cleans, does it all for the band
But not for the team, she does it all for her man
Now they get to see each other like all of the time
But for Dom that's a little bit too much quality time
He used to hit the studio when she would go to work
Now every night they do a show she's there doin' merch
Really, he just wants a little space
Cause the groupies love his group they throwin' pussy in his face
He knows no one can take her place
He just wants to have a fun, he just needs a little taste",https://genius.com/Murs-love-lyrics

Standin' by the bar lookin' unimpressed
Walked up, asked her how she liked the set
Looked me up and down and she just said ""Meh""
Shock, shock, shock, shock
Then I looked at her, said ""You're not that hot""
Of course that's what got her
We fucked all night and watched Harry Potter (Whoo!)
Ironically, the pussy was magic
Had a girl at home but I had to have it
I flew her out to all of the markets
June, July, and all of August
'Bout to cut her off right before I got caught up
Then late one night at home she called up
Said that she was 'bout to have my kid
Talkin' 'bout her period late, guess what I did?

'Cause she already think I'm shady
Knew she was trouble when I got her number
Fucked her raw dog for the whole damn summer
Can I keep both? That's what I wonder
Oh my God, nigga, Ay Caramba

Chamber of secrets
When she told me she was 'bout to name it and keep it
It's our baby but it's her life
So if she wanna keep it, then it's alright
Now I'm knowin' there's no way to prevent
My girlfriend throwin' me out on the cement
It ain't the first time that she caught me creepin'
But this time I done jumped off the deep end
Ok, shit, maybe this might fly
Hopin' they'll try to be sisterwives
Like my man Bill Paxton and Big Love
Do a reality show and get big pub
When ma find out, she gon' beat my ass
'Cause word get around in the street so fast
I should've pulled out and put my dick in her mouth
Now I got nine months to try and figure it out

I love the way that you're walking (walking)
That sexy way that you're talking (talking)
Got everything that I'm missing (I'm missing)
Girl I love the way
Ohh baby I love the way, baby
The way you say my name (my name)
You make a man insane (insane)
Ain't here to play no games, I love the way
Ohh baby I love the way

The way we sleep together, we spoon so perfect
Make that girl I met last June seem worthless
The way your fingers fit right into my hand
Perfect height and age, perfect shade of tan
Sitting in the sand, watching sunset, simple
Dinner and a movie, quality tiempo
Laid back tempo, nothing too fast
Slow and easy making this relationship last
Laying in the bed, I'm warm and I'm cosy
Slide next to me, put your cold feet on me
The best part about you, the worst part about you
That's how I know I love you and I can't live without you

Ohh baby I love the way
I love the way that you're walking (walking)
That sexy way that you're talking (talking)
Got everything that I'm missing (missing)
Girl I love the way
Ohh baby I love the way, baby

Turn off the Xbox, get my attention
Kiss me, strip down, get down to business
Still ain't old, so many years later
Didn't think it could, only got greater
Inside and outside, I know every part of you
Know where you going before you even start to move
Now that don't mean I don't love
Every minute I'm spending in your arms when we hug
They say we boring, all we do is watch TV
You like cooking for me, your girl say it's cheesy
Corny, traditional, all day I'm missing you
Vision of us sitting on the couch and I'm kissing you
Ohh baby I love the way

Kicked out the kitchen, I always leave a mess
You know my strawberry Kool-Aid is the best
Yes I always love you, hope it never change
The way you kind of smile when you start to say my name
I love the way that you do you
And I hope you love the way that I'm doing you too

Verse One]:
I sink deeper
It's got me in the sleeper
I feel nothing, heart colder than a deep freezer
Numb to life so I'm numb to the pain
It's like it won't be happy till it drives me insane
My brain
Minus serotonin
Won't let me see straight, don't know where I'm going
Can't see the light, it's like it's got my eyes closed
And the pills that they give me, just another blindfold
I'm psycho
I can't sleep at night so
I read comic books, play X-Box and write flows
That help you through the tough times
But when it gets rough who's gonna help me get through mines?
Mind tricks the body, body thinks the minds crazy
But this sick mind makes the kid rhyme amazing
Do I really want to curify?
Attempt to purify? Could that be career suicide?
:
They say I'm only good when the session is depressing
So I crucify myself so that you can learn a lesson
They say I'm at my best when I'm at the most stressed out
It's like only see success when I'm wrestling with doubt
:
Huh, here it come again
It's like I'm running then
I fall flat, He laugh and I'm stuck within
A nightmare, my darkest dreams
A night terror where they can't hear me scream
The crowd screaming, they going insane
They think I'm just rapping but I'm really in pain
I'm so lame, stop drinking, stop smoking
Walking past women with their legs wide open
Heartbroken
She left but I'm hoping
She come back so I can split her rib cage open
Backstage, overcome with emotion
Twisting up a smile while my stomach does convulsions
I feel sick
Once sober, feel sicker
Try to save my liver, need to see the big picture
But praise be and pass me the elixir
Cause I seem to need liquor like a priest needs scriptures
The chapter reads verse 3:16
While I toke on this smoke like a skitzo fiend
AAAAAHHHHH
I'm in that mood again
Shadows on the sun
, demons moving in
Room getting dark, attitude is grim
Only had a couple friends and I’m losing them
When the shit gets deep, all you do is swim
Cause your deepest blue could be your truest sin
:
They say I'm only good when the session is depressing
So I crucify myself so that you can learn a lesson
They say I'm at my best when I'm at the most stressed out
It's like only see success when I'm wrestling with doubt

I used to squab everyday
Homie I used to get down
These days I pull punches where I hear them talking shit now
I blow the steam off just to get the dream off
These fools in the industry is thinking that it means 'soft'
Feeling like I need my pistol
If I shoot me a rapper does that make me official?
I got issues, but that's old news
Like
Back issues, I threw away them old shoes
Now stepping in a new direction
Giving you the last chapters of my Blues collection
With new success then, you loose affection
With friends you choose, you should use discretion
Friends become enemies and jealousy is an energy
That used to be love and love is too finicky
Tendencies is so suicidal
Talking bullets out the chamber with each of my recitals
:

And tell 'em to pick up ya people nigga
Don't call Farrakhan to squash it
Better yet call the sheriff
And the coroner's office
Tell 'em there's a dead body
In the corner of Lawson
In Austin, I would proceed with caution
These motherfucka's really think the 'Te done lost it
He sold a couple records now they think he flossin'
But I ain't stopped battling, I just stopped rattling
Off rhymes for free 'cuz y'all were making me nauseous
Understand fucka I'm gon win regardless
I still got the hunger pains from my apartment
When me and 9th were both splittin' cans of StarKist
Arguing about who LP was the hardest
And a hand full of CD's ready to burn
Some real hip hop for your listening nerves

Living Legends on the West coast, ready to shoot

The League done hooked up with a Cloverdale nigga so
Skip the Sidekick, I'm a Nextel nigga
If I hit ya on the chirp, with a verse you better roger that
Picture word-perfect from the land where the Dodgers at
Trying to get some money with some pussy on the side of that
Never have to ask where my killas or my riders at
But when fake gangstas try to find where them dollars at
Go to any city where there's pretty ma's to holla at
The illest in your state, one on the tour-date
And more-great, than your grandfather's father
'Te I know it gotta hurt a man they stand by the slaughter
Oughta be locked away when I rock this way
Get rocked on the airwaves but not for play
If my heart should stop and I drop today
I went against all odds and I got my way

Road Is My Religion,MURS For President,2008.0,"Yeah, and this one right here is dedicated to all the road warriors
To everybody that gotta go out on the road every year to make they money
The spring and the fall. The 45 city tours
We in Idaho one night and Portland, Oregon the next day
Up in Anchorage Alaska and then Australia for three weeks
It's like this...

I got my bags packed
Backpack sittin' by the front door
IPod, laptop, socks and drawers
The stuff that you need when you're out on tour
Home for one month then gone for two more
I'm a rolling stone that's gathering green
Cause my poems is known for packin' in teens
And from, show to show, I'm glad to be seen
But my home is home I'll lackin' that steam
But on the real, I got some bills to pay
My cable just got shut off the other day
Voicemail, got a million messages to play
Homies and the haters got a whole lot to say
And oh, I just love it because my life's so public
My business is in the streets and they think nothing of it
And no I'm not complainin', I'mma keep campaignin'
Till I reach my goal or I go insane

The road is my religion
I'mma keep on sinnin'
Hope to God I'm forgiven for the way that I'm livin'
The woes and the women and the wheels keep spinnin'
Still I won't be forgiven for the way that I'm livin'

I'm on a Delta Continental American flight
And I won't be long so you know I pack light
But still I might miss you and the way that I kiss you
Gotta know that I love you cause I left my heart with you
The night before I leave for a couple of weeks
Hear you cryin' in your sleep, taste the tears on your cheek
It's sweet but it's bitter, the emotion that it triggers
Makes me miss my woman and her home cooked dinner
I wish I never had to leave
Perform for these crowds with my heart on my sleeve
But you still believe and they say you naive
So I gotta keep the faith with every breath that I breathe
It needs to be said that it's just not easy
Every night, different city, different women want to please me
I keep it true and I walk on through
Say my prayers and go to sleep after talking to you


Standin' at the truck stop watchin' this
Redneck truck drivers look at me and spit
I'm like: This is it? This the life that I chose?
A hundred days at home, two hundred days on the road
But I guess I'm addicted because I really start to miss it
Don't know what I'm chasin' but I know I gotta get it
It ain't about fame or a couple of dames
Or a million different faces with a thousand different names
It ain't about praise or the hands being raised
To me it's just a job and I'm glad that it pays
And when the road starts to call in the spring and the fall
If I don't holla back then my skin starts to crawl
And when I get that itch I gotta pack my bags
Dress up or go home, hotels and jet lag
Can't lose my religion cause it's all that I have
I keep runnin' worldwide 'til I run out of gas


I'm so so sorry. To each and every girl I didn't call back
After we spent the night together. But you're beautiful
I love you. Man, you don't know about me. Mr. Dibbs!",https://genius.com/Murs-road-is-my-religion-lyrics

'93 at The Palace we was seein' Tribe
This Puerto Rican girl, she tried to G me
Now I know she jealous when she see me on the TV
(Ha!) Rap karma 101
She tried to play me out and used to treat me like a bum
And look, she probably still don't give a fuck
But now I'm living my dreams she never would've been enough

Whiskey and Patron
It's midnight and I'm gone
Just turned off my phone
Bitch, leave me alone
Whiskey and Patron
It's midnight and I'm gone
Just turned off my phone
Bitch, leave me alone

I know I'm mixing my liquors, but they both dark
And put the flash on that picture, because we both dark
Got the homies from 
Dago
, they live in North Park
619, Mitchy Slicky be the Mozart
My homies at 
Pokez
, they got them hot plates
Catch me after Comic Con on a hot date
5'10"", brown skin, and we mo' than friends
Underground, underdog, going for the win
Every city I go to, you know they love me
'Cause most rappers be bougie and acting ugly
They be acting all stuck up and I be showing love
Catch me out on my scouts and we going to the club
I only wear my chain on the special nights
Really peaceful and humble but been in hella fights
Right now I'm hustlin', ensuring my kids a better life
Ask your sister, she banged me, she say I'm hella nice

Whiskey and Patron
It's midnight and I'm gone
Just turned off my phone
Bitch, leave me alone
Whiskey and Patron
It's midnight and I'm gone
Just turned off my phone
Bitch, leave me alone

Vizzy ride a Seven beat like it got handlebars
Had to learn to handle liquor just to handle bars
In New York hoppin' in and out of yellow cars
Cause the kid turn styles without a metro card
Back when Don was young without a buck
Doin' Saki bombs with moms I like to fuck
Skin tone mixed like the drank in my cup
Take sour with the skunk you could taste through the blunt
Niggas fake from the jump when they in the studio
You take a shot at Don better be Julio
I be M.I.A. with M-i-l-a Kunis though
Drinkin' Jim Beam, girls tryin' to get a movie role
(Oooh) Been shootin' for stars like paparazzi
Comments comin' in I never went in kamakazi
I might've went ghost and Seven might've went Tommy
If you niggas can't find me I'm probably with a dime piece
Drinkin'-

It's midnight and I'm gone (Play, this song)

Lo-Fi Nights,A Strange Journey Into the Unimaginable,2018.0,"Verse 1:
Woke up and put the hose out
Live gang 5, 
Kenley J
 couldn't Close out
(?) and no winning
I'm hella sick of pretending
Like I just don't want to end it
If I can finish the pain
Without feeling the shame
I'd take a gun from the range
And put that shit to my brain
And bang (bang)
I grew up on the Bible
But I don't wanna lie bro
I'm feeling so suicidal
All these trials and tribulations
Remember that you're bigger than
The problems that you're facing
So you take 10 paces
Then turn around and shoot
All of your fears in their faces
Execute and assisinate
Low-fi shit unproductive as I procrastinate
Yeah, unplugging and still thuggin'
OG delivering truth to all the youngins
Chorus:
Low-fi night we living low-fi nights
Low-fi night we living low-fi nights
Low-fi night we living low-fi nights
Low-fi night we living low-fi nights
I'm too low-fi for your technology
My mind too wild for your psychology
My God too big for your biology
So I'ma keep on living my life with no apology
Verse 2:
Now once upon a time in the land with no reception
I came across a wire then I made my connection
I got in tune with myself
Baptized underneath the full moon for my health
If wealth is there in spirit
In poverty of the pocket
All I ask is that you pay me attention
And I'ma rock it
Got it got if I need it, if not than i don't need it
Force yourself to fall in love with your future
And then repeat it
The secret keep it simple
Results will be monumental
Most ultimate of warriors
Entering continental
Champion with champions
Place me up in the pantheon
""Only Gods Can Judge Me""
In songs is how I answer them
Scribbling these phrases on pages
And make em dance for them
Play me for your friends
But I'm probably too advanced for them
Ears to the underground
Call it noise cancelling
Pull the plug on the power it's time to channel in
Chorus:
Low-fi night we living low-fi nights
Low-fi night we living low-fi nights
Low-fi night we living low-fi nights
Low-fi night we living low-fi nights
I'm too low-fi for your technology
My mind too wild for your psychology
My God too big for your biology
So I'ma keep on living my life with no apology",https://genius.com/Murs-lo-fi-nights-lyrics
What Do You Know,....The End of the Beginning,2003.0,"*I know, I know, I know* (sample repeats)

Feel free to hate me and to doubt me, but until you stood behind my plate
And peep the way I truly swing, you could never out me
See, opinions are like rap careers: Everybody's got one
And most of 'em out to zip, even less if it's a hot one
Like the radio songs that make us sing along
Cause the beat is real heavy and the hook is real catchy
Make you nod your head steady, and you don't feel sketchy
'Til you're all by yourself, and you ridin' around
And realize to yourself how stupid it sounds
Mainstream or Underground, away team, home town
It boils down to the facts: Wack is wack
Camby can't hold Shaq
, and a party ain't a party if
You don't bring a sack
Or your own 12-Pack or this 12 on the wax
I detail every track to make a sentence sparkle
Giving thoughts to the thoughtful, 
but I don't know
How I know how to pull these diamonds outta charcoal
I just know

*I know, I know, I know*
Think you do when you don't cause uh
*I know, I know, I know*
Think I don't when I do but uh
*I know, I know, I know*
Think you do when you don't cause uh

It's knowledge of self, knowing what you can and you can't do
And knowing to play the hand that God chose to hand you
I plan to double down when my turn comes around
I suggest you do the same, you can't take these chips with you
So it's best to play the game while there's breath up in your frame
Judge to death be the name, so I modern-day confuse
For you Latter Day souls, promote the type of fun
That makes your Saturdays whole, grey matter turn gold
With the stroke of a pen, help your spirit verge free
Before it chokes from within, me I'm cloaked in my sin
So I decorate the shrow, so the tat on my arm
Is the badge of a proud, B-Boy gone wild
In the rap sense of child born in '78
So I know no other culture just to set the record straight
I'm a vandal B-Boyin', turntable destroyin'
Right now it's the skills with the mic I'm employin'
Cause I


I know tomorrow's not promised so handle business while you can
I know a friend's not a friend just because he lends a hand
I know a man's not a man, if he has to beat his woman
I know she'll push you to the point where you feel she had it comin'
I know you both love each other so a brawl would be senseless
I know this cause I lived it, and I mean every sentence
I know that 25 to Life is a very long time
I know that that's the reason that I have to go for mine
I know that waitin' on no man is the scheduled flight of time
I know that time is unfair when I listen to Sublime
I know that my time is comin' so I gotta keep runnin'
I know that our time is now so let's have a little fun and
I know you gotta feel me, or my fate is soon to seal me
I know that cigarettes and alcohol are out to kill me
I know I gotta quit, but not right know
I know I gotta quit, but I just don't know how; I just",https://genius.com/Murs-what-do-you-know-lyrics
A Friend’s Blues,Varsity Blues EP,2002.0,"Now when you're young, death can make you aware of your mortality
At times we feel invincible, lose sight of reality
Until it takes a loved one, residing in our circle
It'll hurt you cause you miss 'em
Once were close, down you're distant
And it hurts just to know that they could go at any instant
Gotta love 'em by the minute, now you realize this
It's sad it takes a loss to appreciate the gifts
So celebrate the occasion, just breathing is amazin'
To see the sun rise and set, at a days end
A chance to fix mistakes that we regret makin'
Find joy in the simple things, no time for complainin'
The sun will shine, it can't always be rainin'
I know it hurts deep, but you must maintain it
I seen it in my homeboys Terry and Tom
They've lost so many, yet they keep so strong
To lose a parent or a sibling and have the will to keep living
Takes so much strength, so I admire y'all
And one day hope to find out, what is (bias?) y'all
And I'm still mad, askin' why it happens at all
Some say that God takes them, and they lean on mythology
But I choose to believe that its divine lottery
I can't believe God's lookin' down, waitin' to slaughter me
I can't live in fear, and I can't live here
Forever, so I treasure every moment

And it's friendship, that I value the most
That kinship, the ones we hold close
And dear, and fear the most of losin'
But keep chewin'
The memories brewin', cause life keeps movin'on
And it's friendship, that I value the most
That kinship, the ones we hold close
And dear, and fear the most of losin'
But keep chewin'
The memories brewin', cause life keeps movin'on

We came together like family, like it was our first death
Unexpected, so quick, so sudden, the worst yet
Didn't get to know the girl, 'til years after her first breath
Still we loved her like a sister, as a depth of first steps
Got the call out of town, so alone I first wept
Deep pain, from the same place, is where this verse crept
Never slept in that bed again
The memory was too tragic, looked up and screamed goodbye
Knew you wouldn't be present at the wake, in your casket
Now you're askin' things change since you left, not really
We still playin' games, BSin', actin' silly
See she don't talk to her and, she don't like me and
Will we work things out, thats not likely
I mean where will we start
Do we mend friendships, or let things fall apart
Will we still be in touch, honestly I don't know
But you're in my heart forever

It's friendship, that I value the most
That kinship, the ones we hold close
And dear, and fear the most of losin'
But keep chewin'
The memories brewin', cause life keeps movin'on
And it's friendship, that I value the most
That kinship, the ones we hold close
And dear, and fear the most of losin'
But keep chewin'
The memories brewin', cause life keeps movin'on
And it's friendship, that I value the most
That kinship, the ones we hold close
And dear, and fear the most of losin'
But keep chewin'
Pour out a little brew and blow a blunt while your cruisin'
For friends that you're choosin', gotta love 'em 'fore you lose 'em
Stand strong when you do it, tough times, live through 'em
Don't give into 'em, stay goal pursuin' and
Doin' what your doin' cause life keeps movin' on",https://genius.com/Murs-a-friends-blues-lyrics
Intro,Murs 3:16: The 9th Edition,2004.0,"What up though
It's Murs, 9th Wonder
Murs 3:16, the 9th Edition
Shhhhhhh, shut your fat mouth, and listen

Anticipation got the deck stacked against me since the outset
9th got 'em fiending for an instrumental version of an album that ain't out yet
But now it's my outlet, and it feels so good
To them punk fans, when I'm still so hood
So hood it's ridiculous, still iniculous
That means 3 times doper than your favorite MC riding round with a chauffeur
These niggas need Jesus, fuck it, niggas need Oprah
All this killing and this pimping and these foul ways of living
See, everyone's forgetting that the struggle's not over
I got sober, then got drunk again
Got my boy from Carolina, picked up the pen
Threw my nuts on the finish line, I come to win
While you nuttin' to lose, I'll shake you out your shoes
With ease, with moves parallel to those and other three
Couldn't wait for George to make the new Star Wars scene
So I made my own episode 3:16
To answer all the rumors that been shooting through your group:
Yes 9th really does make these beats on Fruity Loops
But what does that matter? this is more than music
By buying this disc you have bought into a movement
Not a revolutionary, nothing but the truth I carry
Change if you wanna change, that karma is for you to carry
All I'm trying to do is lighten your load
So in between I'm getting faded, some of y'all getting blowed
But I couldn't fall off and lose sight of my goals
So I got sober, got drunk again

Risky Business,....The End of the Beginning,2003.0,"See, had the place to myself, my parents went outta town
So I had the music up and I was runnin' around
Singing to the beat of my favorite underground
Song at the time, let's just say it was MURS
I was rappin' in the mirror, I was knowin' every verse
I was doin' my thang until the doorbell rang
It was my homeboy Shock, a mellow type of fellow
That I knew from up the block, he walked in and said:

Yo, what's the deal MURS? First things first, you couldn'ta hit me
At a better time, them four cars behind me, they with me
All women, all dimes, the redhead she's mine
She wanna hump me, yo that's my brother Humpty

What's up yo? Pardon me, but I gots to go, where the bathroom at?
Y'all got liquor? Come on, Trina! Yo this house is fat
'Ey cat, you wanna hit this? Oops I shouldn'ta did that
I'll clean it up before your folks come home, yo where they at?

Man I don't believe you brought this nigga man I heard about his ass
The only fool dumb enough to flunk his P.E. Class
It's not that he's dumb, he's just loud and he's ignorant
Known for gettin' mad drunk and gettin' all belligerent
Man I'm sick of this I shouldn'ta told nobody
I mean three's company, but four cars makes a party
Mental note: lock the garage, hide the keys to dad's Rolls
Cause it's outta control, this bitch is taking off her clothes

Is your dad's Rolls blue? Cause I got bad news
Humpty took a cruise, and barbeque pit went in the pool
Turned the water grey, I would stay and help you clean up
But the neighbors say police are comin', I got to G up

Beep, beep, beep! Yo, I'm back MURS, where should I park it?
I brought the whole strip club with me, we bout to spark it
My girl hurled in your backseat, but yo it's cool
We got weed and some shrooms, is it cool to use your dad's room?

It's risky business, man what is this?
I'm caught up in a twist, and I'm tryin' to fix shit
It's risky business, man what is this?
I'm caught up in a twist, now I'm tryin' to fix it

What you mean my dad's room? Nigga is you crazy?
And what's up with them glasses, what'cha eye kinda lazy?
Anyways we gotta clean that shit up out the backseat
But first what's up with that blonde, you think she
Likes black meat?

She said she was a virgin to the brown, never splurged in the town
But she's down, cause you got her moist, like the Rolls Royce backseat
'Least I can do is help you clean it up cousin
What time is mom and dad comin'?

Yo, why y'all bein' responsible and shit? We gotta hook up
We tryin' to get these chicks upstairs, see what we can cook up
One of them got their toes blue, coochie shaved, so cool
My nose tryin' to be with those when the doors close fool

Exactly. Fuck the backseat I'm tryin' to smack cheeks
Until they turn reddish, and satisfy my fetish
Lay back and get some lettuce (Humpty: Yo, what'chu mean, head?) (Yeah)
That's what I said, then call it a wrap (Shock: But what about your parents?)
Well, they never called me back, I guess their flight got delayed
So we got time to get laid, ayo Hump could you watch for that white Escalade?
(Humpty: Did you even have to ask?) Well since you're on the task
I'mma head upstairs and get focused on some ass
And if I start to scream, do your best to ignore me
If my parents come in, just tell them the Burger King story
Just keep 'em entertained until I finish gettin' brained

Anyways,Have A Nice Life,2015.0,"Square as a box, I stay in my lane
My daddy left my family, cause of rock-cocaine
Ma's working hard, for us to maintain
If you didn't live it, it's hard to explain
From the outside, it looks insane
Once you touch that hard white, it's hard to make a change
We hoop the cop coups, we slang to have thangs
My homie slang 'caine, I chose the rap game

I coulda made a million flying birds up the interstate
Ice diamond medallion 'bout the size of a dinner plate
If I don't sell it to 'em, they gon' get it anyway
Gon' get it anyway
They gon' get it anyway
I coulda made a million flying birds up the interstate
Ice diamond medallion bout the size of a dinner plate
If I don't sell it to 'em, they gon get it anyway
Gon' get it anyway
They gon get it anyway
Everybody getting paid

Daddy ain't home, he selling dope on the corner
His best friend been turned informer
He got them clacks coming from Arizona
To you it's a movie, for him it's just normal
Enormous pounds of white
Child of the night
Counting 50 G's to himself every night
Racks on racks on racks
Hit the strip club, they show him straight to the back
That's the life, that he lives
Whenever in Miami he just live at live
Give it 3 years and he a Rico case
Ain't no telling how many years he gon' face
Coulda been me cause we from the same neighborhood
Every time he offer me some work I just say I'm good
So this rap shit better pan out
Or I'mma be the nigga asking for a handout


They bring it in on big boats
And arrest us for trafficking like a sick joke
It ain't a option for the rich folk
But for us it's live broke or flip dope
Live broke or flip coke
Live broke or flip dope
Forget hope and flip coke
Forget hope and flip dope

They gon' get it anyway
Anyway, anyway

Trevor an’ Them,Murs 3:16: The 9th Edition,2004.0,"Now there's one in my hood off Pico or some shit
Through the years it's been the epicenter for a lot of dumb shit
Let me tell you about this one trip to the store
On the early mornin' tip some time 'round four
I was standing by the magazines readin' a Maxim
When I heard a familiar voice to the the counter dude and ask him
To empty out the register (Nah, that can't be Trevor)
Excuse me, Tiny T-Bone from the neighborhood gang
Who if his head wasn't screwed on he would lose his brain
He was with two other dudes, never knew their names
I thought great, it was time for me to shake
But as I headed to the door I heard a voice say (""Wait!"")
When I turned around, he recognized me and I knew it
I was about to leave, that's when that nigga blew it
He lifted up his mask and said (""Hey Murs, it's me, Trevor"")
I said ""You dumb motherfucker do you use your brain, ever?""
Never mind, I turned around gave the deuce
Walkin' to the car feelin' like Q in Juice
Remember when he went in the bar and Blizzard let him loose?
Anyway here comes this nigga running, big bag of money
He hopped in ride, I said ""You God damn dummy
They got yo ass on tape"" (""But they didn't see my face"")
""Well they got my car and my fuckin' license plate
Man get the fuck on"" (""Murs, why you gotta hate?"")
""Hate nor love got shit to do with this
You better run for the fives come through this bitch
You know you got two strikes, you better use them new Nikes
To dodge all them blue lights"" He looked and said (""You right"")
Then he bolted up the street
Once he left my slight I gave a sigh of relief
But that was right before I peeped, this dumb motherfucker
Left the bag full of money sitting right there on my passenger seat",https://genius.com/Murs-trevor-an-them-lyrics
She’s So Lost (Yumi’s Blues),Yumiko: Curse Of The Merch Girl,2011.0,":
Her name is Yumi
The one they call ""Groupie""
Since she's at every single show they're assuming
She gotta be screwing, somebody in the band
But she's into the music, she ain't tripping off a man
The scene was itty bitty, and in this little city
You can't sing along to songs and be pretty
They threw on they skirts, she threw on some pants
They put on they heels, she slipped on some Vans
Her tone was tan, a beautiful blend
Latin/Asian/American with beautiful skin
Honestly she was born to date a lead singer
Never once worried about the trouble he would bring her
She was in love, he was in lust
But we know a starving artist is so hard to trust
He stole her heart, then took it for a spin
Now it seems the world is revolving around him
 {x2}:
And she's so lost
Forgot which way is up
Down so long it seems like she's stuck
Down for anything that'll change her luck
Once you hit rock bottom man, enough is enough
And she's so lost {echo}
:
And all she ever needed
Was someone to be believe in
Search so long for something to give it meaning
Only 19 and, for love she was fiending
Gave it all to him
For no good reason
And he was seasoned, so he took advantage
Scumbag, womanizer, fronting like he's manish
A little boy trying to figure it out
Overconfident, a complex littered with doubt
He was someone she never thought of living without
Until she found him with that bitch and his dick in her mouth
Now she wants to castrate him, throw his dick in his mouth
So she threw a few blows, started bitching him out
But he don't understand what she tripping about
Says that he only cheats because she's always flipping out
The road to womanhood, yet this is the route
But for now, a little girl trying to figure it out
 {x2}:
And she's so lost
Forgot which way is up
Down so long it seems like she's stuck
Down for anything that'll change her luck
Once you hit rock bottom man, enough is enough
And she's so lost {echo}",https://genius.com/Murs-shes-so-lost-yumis-blues-lyrics

I got my house shoes on and my white t-shirt
My basketball shorts, I'm about to get some Squirt
I brought my own cup with a little ice in it
Cause I might mix it up and get nice in a minute
They call me ghetto but I don't give a damn
Cause I'm standin' on the corner with my cup in my hand
Other hand down the front of my pants, scratchin' my balls
They sag a little bit so you might see my drawers
I'm on pause
Man, I'm in my chill mode
Just got paid and I got a little bill fold
I'm feelin' good man, you can't tell me nothin'
Then the homie Verbs roll up, yo what's up man?

Nothin' homie with the spokes I'm on move
Tryin' to get some jerky and some coconut juice
Yeah
I just cranked a couple miles and the sweat is droppin' down
I was set around your town
To Supowida and Pico
 made a right by some hills
And now I'm at the store with MURS, we fienda chill
But now a nigga awfully thirsty, that's for reals
So Verbs spins till your thirst quencher on the grill
But I ain't got no skrill
But homie can you spot like we workin' on the bitches
Make sure you get some Optimos and Swishers
I'm about to go the distance with this eye
And by the way my nigga can you get a can of Sprite?
 
 What you want from the store man?
Let a nigga know
But hurry up fool cause I'm ready to go
 I want a Snicker bar and a Dentyne Ice
 Well if you kick your boy down with some ends that'd be nice
 What you want from the store man?
Let a nigga know
But you need to hurry up cause I'm ready to go
I want some chips I want some drink
What you think this is?
You better your ass up and come and roll with the kid
 
Let me tell you how this ish went down
Eatin' bags of chips and I'm in Mid-town
Meetin' pretty ass broads that I met in Santa Mon-
Ica, oh yeah and MURS
And we ran out of the car
I have solutions
Let's walk to the store
She said it would be faster if we up and use my car
Aye aye aye aye, that would be a waste of gas and
These siddity girls actin' like they got classes
Two little group-ies
Actin' hella boushe
All they do is listen to Kid Cudi and Lupe
Hold up
I ain't even tryin' to clown but
What I'm tryin' to say is they from the other side of town

What's up man?
These chicks ain't never been to the hood?
They look a little shook like they think they too good
Like my neighborhood store ain't up to they standards
You can get a white tee or a new bandanna
A bag of Gummy Bears and some new tube socks
A pack of Trojan large and a fruit juice box
Some new 2Pac and some bootleg DVDs
Dominos, Doritos and some dirty magazines
What more do you need?
A nickel bag of weed?
My boy got them sacks but they got a couple seeds
And if that ain't good enough, you just ain't hood enough
Get your ass on before my home girls fuck you up
 
 What you want from the store man?
Let a nigga know
But you need to hurry up cause I'm ready to go
 I want some cupcakes
 Bring me up somethin' fool
You still owe me from the last time that shit ain't cool
 What you want from the store man?
Let a nigga know
But you need to hurry up cause I'm ready to go
 I want an Arizona (What?!)

Got all this money and you lookin' so depressed
Angry and mad
Man, I'm happy as hell
Might get a job if this record don't sell

What? Burger King? McDonalds? Better yet, Best Buy or Target
At least I'll get a discount

Oh well, I'll be employee of the month
You'll never see your boy on the tube with gold fronts
That ain't me
It never was
You gotta do you and let it do what it does
I'mma be happy
Fame won't trap me
Catch me doin' this for the money then slap me
There's more to life
I'm better than that
I'm trying to lift you up instead of settin' you, settin' you back (echos)

It's good game man. I wouldn't tell you nothing that wasn't good for you though
That wasn't going to help you grow


This is MURS and 9th Wonder signin' off
And you know we do it, we do, we do it realistic
So, it's his wife and my momma and my girlfriend and we goin' home
That's it. No party, no after party, no Crystal, no hoes
Just me and my morano, goin' home",https://genius.com/Murs-breakthrough-lyrics

Another beautiful day in mid-city LA
They rolled up, we popped him as he walked away
Pro game, man down, now all the neighbors standing round with they cameras out
Red team verse blue team
Been over thirty years it ain't a new thing
Another gun shot, another nigga died
Don't you know we got a lot bigger fish to fry?
Up north they just 
lynch
 Willie Sims
How come y'all niggas ain't trying to get them?
Unless somebody come to try and take your rims
You gon' call the homies and pull out the MAC-10s
I don't understand y'all dudes
White people see it on the news and they confused
While you choose to make war in this bitch, they invest, buy land and get rich

They moved out, but we moved in
Like fuck y'all niggas, no new friends
When they move back, we gotta move out
Now it's seven figures for a new house
Walk they dogs with nose in the sky
Tensions build the temperature rise
We ask why the rent is so high
G-E-N-T-R-I-F-Y

Ay, ay, could you put that camera down?
Y- what you mean it's a free country?
That's an expensive phone, right?
Yeah, it would suck if it got broke

Snapchat filters on the homicide
It's entertainment to them when one of us die
Wanted to hit 'em but I saw the big picture
If I hit 'em then I'm just an ""angry nigga""
Covered up his phone with my hand
Try to reason with him like a grown man
He didn't get it but he left because he feared me
Couple days later he won't even come near me
At night I saw him way across the street
Walking his dog, when he stopped to take a leak
On the corner with the candles and the flowers
The homie mama she been standing there for hours
Every night she would come down to mourn and cry
She saw the disrespect out the corner of her eye
That's when a homie grabbed him by the neck
I would be a snitch if I said what happened next

They moved out, but we moved in
Like fuck y'all niggas, no new friends
When they move back, we gotta move out
Now it's seven figures for a new house
Walk they dogs with nose in the sky
Tensions build the temperature rise
We ask why the rent is so high

Gentrify y'all, till we die y'all

Animals Dammit,Captain California,2017.0,"Next up on Animals Dammit
We explore the sudden emergence of Gorillas on the South West coast of North America
Definitely not native to this region
These creatures are already leaving an indelible mark on the urban landscape
Join us, as we journey deep in the jungle to expose this new phenomenon

Uh
This an animal's planet
I got animals dammit
My gorillas throw gang signs, y'all niggas can't handle it

Ha!

Deep in the jungles
Off of Nicolette
In front of Dorsey High with a marijuana cigarette
At the marketplace, very African
Sippin' on some liquor that I copped from the Pakistan
Shoelaces, red, gold, green
'Bout to hit up that parade for the Martin Luther King
Niggas at Louisiana Chicken sat trippin'
CK shirts on, Anti-Crippin'
Damn
I'm just try'na move these incense
This situation so intense
Still see the families barbecuein', drill teams in the middle of the street this is how we do it
This was 9-6 and that was the jam still
Back when niggas banged heavy metal like anvil
Droppin' off the cliff on the head of that coyote
Gettin' chased by the blue bird, just like cody
Get it? Forget it
I'm up at autobahn
Walkin' past people sellin' jewelry on they front lawn
Seen this rap nigga I used to have beef with
Walkin' in his tank top like he on some G-Shit
Just got his deal on some Crip wannabe shit
20 years later he was on some MTV shit
Anyways, I'm sidetracked on a tangent
Tryna finish tellin' you this story

Ha!

Saw my homies from my neighborhood comin' up the street
Dressed in all blue from the head to they feet
They didn't see me, but I seen them
I try to dip out that's when I hear the homie Demon he like
""What up Nick, cuz?""
I'm like ""Shit, fuck.""
These motherfuckers Goddamn
I just don't understand
Gettin' caught up with these niggas wasn't part of the plan
I act like I'm happy to see 'em
I dap 'em up
And in the back of my mind I know they about to act up
""Haaa, what y'all niggas doin' up here?""
(Nothin' cuz, heard some enemies was up here)
(You wanna leave Nick?)
(You got a problem? )
(Guess you only kick it with us when you got a problem)
I just had them tools at my school last week
I told them fools they're trippin', then they came up there mad deep
A friend in need is a friend indeed
So I tried to distract 'em and I offered 'em some weed
It didn't work, they seen them dudes at the chicken spot
All them blood niggas standin' up on the rooftop
Didn't take long before they spotted us
And any other day they would've been done shotted us
Too many people in the street to bear witness
And they all hopped down from the roof with a quickness
I seen one of 'em try to reach in his waist
So Colossus threw a barbecue grill in his face
Sparks flyin' everywhere, people is screamin'
That's when two of 'em tried to hop on Demon
And I seen a fist comin' out of my periphery
And all of the sudden the asphalt got slippery
I got hit
My feet slipped out from under me
Now I'm goin' down, down, down, like a submarine
Knocked out cold in the middle of Crenshaw
A nigga named Grit got credit for the pinfall
I woke up, slightly concussed in handcuffs
Bleedin' from my head, I could barely even stand up
Police askin' me what transpired
When I said I didn't know they was callin' me a liar
A call on they radio said shots fired
So they had to let me go 'cause a priority was hired
They drove off, tires screechin', lights flashin'
Homies pulled up and told me get my ass in
I got to the crib and I got me a ice pack
These niggas wanna smoke right before they go strike back
Now they got jokes, laughin' cause I got knocked out
I'm happy that I'm home, I give a fuck what they talkin' 'bout
On the couch with a concussion, niggas clownin' me but well
It's better than havin' a concussion in the county jail

This an animal's planet
I got animals dammit

One Uh Those Days,Captain California,2017.0,"I can't wait to quit this fuckin' job
Light up my cigarette
Exhale the negativity and hop on to the bus
I'm stinkin' like some french fries
I'm thirsty, I'm tired
Tomorrow I might cuss my boss out and get fired
Sittin' in the corner, mindin' my business
The fuck this bitch lookin' at? I know she hella trippin'
(Fuck you lookin' at?)
Got nothin' better to do than start problems on public transportation
What a pathetic existence
She's doggin' with persistence, uh
This bitch is comin' up to me, girl you don't wanna fuck with me
Waste no time, post up, blows thrown
The shit you gotta deal with in the big city just tryin' to go home
What a shitty day, can't wait to hit my sheets
I can't wait to get my car I'm fuckin' tired of these streets
(I'm fuckin' sick of this fuckin' bullshit)
Yo, today been hella breezy, receivin' hella tips
Next customer in line, I can't believe it's that bitch (Oh hell no)
I gotta be professional, so I ain't poppin' off
But don't trip, I'll put that special in that extra special sauce, hoe

Hope I don't go back to slangin' yayo
Roll a dollar, about to head up to Drayo's
Never had to lay low
Always had a halo
Plus I got a bitch to suck my dick when I say so
And Ayo
The fuck?
This nigga hit me up, out the side of his truck
I'm like.. what?
Nigga this midtown
Bust a U-Turn if you really wanna get down
Oh shit, he really 'bout to turn around
Hol' up
Let me turn my music d- I said, say my nigga
Oh shit, he pullin' out the hammer
A left-minded home, I was in my pajamas
See, I woke up late
Realized I hadn't ate
Went to my favorite place and thought that I would be straight
I hop back in my whip, tried to run the nigga over
Hopin' that he didn't see the plates on the Rover
Made a right on Cloverdale, then a left
Parked in the driveway, then ran up the steps
I grabbed my piece, hopped back in the streets
I know this young motherfucker don't really want beef
Look, I'm 30-something, still down to murder something
But when I stopped to think about it, it was all over nothing
So fuck it
I'm about to head to the crib
Then... Aww, shit
Look who it is!
I know this motherfucker ain't really gettin' tacos
I parked in the red, grabbed my shit and I walked slow
Right up behind him, I put my gun in his back
I said, ""Yeah my nigga, what was up with all of that?""
""Fuck what you wanna do, this what you gonna do.""
""Hands in your pocket, keep your eyeballs in front of you.""
Then this lady came and kissed him on the cheek
He said ""Hi, Mom"", and then they both start to speak
I said, ""Ah, shit. This young punk.""
""He gangbangin' when he 'bout to meet his mama for lunch?""
The line for the tacos was long anyways, so I walked off laughin'
It was one of those days

A Lean Story,A Strange Journey Into the Unimaginable,2018.0,"It was the year 2000 when I first sipped lean
My homie from D-town put me on the scene
This was way back, before it was a big thing
Before every rapper was a fucking dope fiend
My little brother went to PV, he put me up on that DJ Screw n' Pimp C
He was still free at the time, I was on tour with the legends tryna shine
I hit the club, looking for the plug
I was down deep in  tryna find this new drug
Met this dude, said he's from the northside
Said he knew a spot and he would give me a ride
Didn't think twice, he said that he was a fan
And I would do anything to get up out the van
Fifteen seater we was rolling ten deep
And I was sittin' bitch so I couldn't get sleep
I heard codeine was the thing to make you pass out
Got to the spot, he told me pull the cash out
I asked how much, he told me forty bucks
He came back with a baby food jar (what the fuck)
He said it was a deuce, I mixed it with the soda or I mix it with some juice
He just laughed and he told me be patient
Bent the corner, we was at the gas station
Got some ice in a styrofoam cup
A can of orange soda, it was time to grow up
I started sippin', headed back to the show
'Bout the time I hit the stage, everything was movin' slow
The front row was lit, the show was super thick
I walked straight to the edge of the stage and then I slipped
The rest of the show went on without a hitch
When it was over, I was sober, I was looking for a chick
Walking through the crowd, hey yo where is at?
Staring at this chick, she started staring at me back
Before I got the chance to go and start flirting
This bitch nigga stepped on my Jordan thirteens
I kept them on ice, since 1998
Just looked down and chuckled, then he laughed to my face
Laughed because I fell off the stage, he had jokes
So I knocked his ass out in front of all of his folks
Fucked around, out of town, and I couldn't got smoke
But sometimes it's like ""fuck it"", you gotta go for broke
One of his homies stepped up and got knocked out clean
While the dude who took me earlier to go and get the lean
Didn't make a scene
We pushed it to the car
Then headed to the spot, and we copped another jar
This time we bought a pipe, 'cause I owed them that
When people show you love, you always show it back",https://genius.com/Murs-a-lean-story-lyrics
Me and This Jawn,MURS For President,2008.0,"Me and this Jawn gotta thing goin' on
So many years it's been goin' so strong
Never did I think that we would make it this long
But it feels so right that it can't be wrong
Now we all grown, made a house to a home
Still get that feelin' when I call you on the phone
All we been through, I can't leave you alone
Said, it feels so right that it can't be wrong

I met you on valentine's through a pal of mine
I knew he liked you but he was outta line
I was nerdy actin', yeah, I was dirty mackin'
Said my piece then waited on your reaction
You said yes, I guess out of pity
Had me hella happy, I was skip around my city
She really likes me, I call right away
You waited 50 hours, I counted night and day
Once we talked I knew you were different
I had my work cut out for me from the beginning
I played Luther, all types of lullabies
I wrote you crazy poetry, competing with them other guys
I made you mix tapes, I wanted the exclusive
Playin' hard to get, so elusive
It wasn't love at first sight but I made you love me
Know you couldn't be happier that you gave it to me

Me and this Jawn gotta thing goin' on
So many years it's been goin' so strong

All we been through, I can't leave you alone

I must have my females crossed
Cause if you ain't the one then, baby, I'm lost
Picked you up and cut the other girls off
Now it's me and you against the world at any cost
I said I must have my females crossed
Cause if you ain't the one then, baby, I'm lost
Picked you up and cut the other girls off
Now it's me and you against the world at any cost
I walked on the wild side for ya
The boys on the block used to chase you round the corna
Claimin' some gang, I didn't care which
They was just mad, you wasn't they chick
We had a lotta, we had a few fights
But it was all done at the end of every night
We hit the boardwalk under the pier
Underneath full moons I would whisper in your ear
You're my sweetheart, girl, you're my everything
Worked two jobs just to get you this wedding ring
I haven't gave it to ya, I'm tryin' to save till ya
Least expect it and make it something major for ya
You're the best thing to happen in my life
Now it's time for you to get it crackin' as my wife
Beauty and brains, the package so right
Plus it don't hurt, you give me action every night

Me and this Jawn gotta thing goin' on
So many years it's been goin' so strong
Never did I think that we would make it this long
But it feels so right that it can't be wrong

Do it to her proper
She ain't never lie, come and bring it to your poppa

Kick the game like football and soccer

I cock it, I pop it, don't knock it so stop it
I got it I lock it, rocket, copped oxes

I got that NATO appeal

Too much skill

I'm Dodgered out, we rock the house
Smokin' on the front porch at my mama's house (let me hit that)
Come see me, we take life easy
The homie, fresh out, said he seen me on TV
That's what I do it for
This is for you and yours
We do it for the love
What the fuck you makin' music for?

What you do it for? What you makin' music for? Huh?

Celebrations to steal life
Reminiscing to feel right
Remember what it would feel like
Sometimes it's better than real life
So we celebrate the memories
You can't replace the energy
Everything how it was meant to me
Conduct your dreams like symphonies
Verse 1:
I got a red line BMX
Saved up 6 months for them to see me flex
My boys on my block gave me my respect
But what I really hope is that it would lead to sex
Bad brown babe name of Deeana
Had the keys to the boys hearts, played them like pianas
Or pianos, hotter than a Roman candle
With her sheer sun dresses and her open toe sandles
Queen of the school in her P.E. shorts
Life goal is making out by the hand ball courts
Then one day she found out I sold pot
She said, slide your girl a J and I'll show you what I got
I said, Not like that, what I want is your heart
But we can smoke a dime bag if you meet me at the park
And when I found out she can roll her own weed
I was in love, so in love, brother yes indeed
Chorus:
Celebrations to steal life

Remember what it would feel like

Verse 2:
We used to skate the court house in West L.A
Weekends, holidays, almost every day
I could, I was from the hood, but make that trip
2 hours back and forth, that was my favourite shit
No crips, no bloods, and no fake thugs
Just a bunch of skater kids, smoking on great bud
I sold drugs, but had plug on the music too
2 style (?) mixtapes, we laced the whole crew
A black dude, with some Jewish kids, bumping who
Snoop, Pharcyde, De La, just to name a few
I had a 'Fro, pro-Black like Spike Lee
But they got me back in to Ad-Roc and Mike D
MCA, rest in peace, ayo Mario C
He was a motherfucking beast
Bumping Ill Communication, sitting in my room
The So What You Want video made me take Shrooms

Done Deal,....The End of the Beginning,2003.0,"It's the end of the beginning
So I thought it only right that I bring along the
Motherfuckers I started this shit with
2003MG Melancholy Gypsys
MURS, Scarub, Eligh

To do it right in life is just an angle breakin'
Make or break myself in the matter of moments under discretion
With lessons upon the forefront, My life is in the breeze
Makin' my knees squeak beggin' my soul to please speak
Universal guides then listen, trouble sometimes blister my vision
But I've enlisted my mind for the full mission
Not bullshittin' on a stoop with a stool pigeon
Talkin' about ""What'chu gonna do in the future?""
""Movin' up the ladder with ass kissin'.""
I'm on my last mission in life
Dumping through the middle grounds like a junkyard dog in a prowl
Guarding my bow throwin' in the towel when it's right
Until then I'm walking towards the light with my sword drawn from a fight
Doing everything bad that happens has an opposite reaction
Keep my feet on traction, until my goals in life are right in front of my face
And I can smell, touch and taste what I've been workin' for
I'll be walkin' out the front door

It's a done deal, do it 'til it's done
Cause the movement don't stop 'til the rising sun
It's a done deal, let's have a little fun
Cause the movement don't stop 'til the rising sun

I'm talking done deal, closed case
Ain't no time for looking back on the road you take
You gotta claim your spot, nobody hold your place
Ain't no time to preach about time you chose to waste
You gotta mold your fate, hold your weight
All my peoples NY to the Golden Gate
Who know the rap about the breed and the gold is fake
How we all supposed to eat when they want the whole cake?
Niggas want all the dough, but never learn to bake
So they rise too fast and they burn the plate
But I'm concerned with fate, and watch the turns I take
Know this world is affected by the moves you make
So I ain't gotta stop moving just to prove you fake
Just spit these real raps to get this real estate
So I can steal your fanbase and steal your date
Won't have a soul mate until I meet my soul mate


It's like I'm type of walking towards heaven through hell
Everyday it's something new, I'll make it through; so many fell off
Whoever knew it cost so much to clutch a dream
In between the thumb and the index lies a small space for mistakes
The indication for almost
Sometimes you hold it until you face to magnify how
Close you came in life to something
That you measure up to
I know that pain like my enemy
Slap my ass when I'm born, and will hold my hand when it's the end of me
The lessons learned in between these two extremes feed me energy
I keep it moving with the force of a crane
Where the steel ball's just swinging at the end
All it takes is one pen to tap these words out like
Morse code over your eardrums
To speak to your spirit
Intoxicate you with my speech to crash crew like drunk driving
Whether it be freestyling or stage diving I float over these weak rappers
Like volcanic islands, I got a fire in me",https://genius.com/Murs-done-deal-lyrics
Murray’s Revenge,Murray’s Revenge,2006.0,"I'm a, hood legend, you should feel threatened
Front I'mma show you what's good in a second
The best in the business, I mean what is it?
The dopest MC to walk talk it and live it
A wide bright screen with a blockbuster signature
Every new line I speak should be in cinemas
Champion sound, I win with words
Like you finally talked your girl into sleepin with a friend of hers
Oh yeah, I'm off on a good one
Momma's so proud of what her boy from the hood done
Got off the meat and I got my mind right, I
Got out these streets I got my grind like I
Got on these beats I gotta come tight it's
Gotta be me, it's gotta be 9th
Your boy dropped some stuff and it was probably nice
But they need a little help, and a lot of advice
Quit while you're ahead, you ain't seein no bread and
Don't sleep on us, you can sleep when you're dead
And grateful, you didn't live life hateful
Change for the better like the weather in April
Food for the soul, go ahead and grab a plateful
A heart full of hate, is a waste and disgraceful
Uhhhh, don't it just turn your stomach
When a brother only wanna see another brother plummet?
Come wit'cha best and you can lose like the rest
Straight shots when I shoot how we do on the West
Yeah!

You know who we might be, man myth or MC
But Murs sums it up best now, wouldn't you agree?
I, stuck to the plate like it's And1 and straight
Sew the mic around your neck and then bounce it off your face
With grace, the ace in the hole, replacin the old
Cause the new generation got a taste for some soul
Hold on to opinions 'til I tell you to have one
That mic wasn't hot until the spot 'til I grabbed one
Off the stand now it's off the hook
And when the beat is this nuts, then I'm off the books
Meaning, off the head, freestylin makin bread
And I shoulda been in a movie but I made my own instead
Still pioneering with this independent hustle
And your mic cord is much too short for you to tussle
For the man that pro like 40-Water, poured in rememberance
Of every hood soldier that died in ghetto tenements
Innocent 'til proven guilty
Should I die don't look for the dude that killed me
Look for a brighter tomorrow, and in spite of the sorrow
Live every moment to the fullest so your life isn't hollow
And you can holla out my name from the top of the game
And since you passed homey I promise I'll do the same
For if a soul is avenged through the deeds of a friend
Then success has always been the best form of revenge

Same Ol Day,Captain California,2017.0,"Back against the wall ain't got no place to go
Feeling real good on a hood day, ya you know
Same 'ol thing with a brand new attitude
But when the sun don't shine at least you got the moon

We traded Kent for a catcher battin' 225
And a pitcher with an ERA that's way too high
Fuck my life, fuck my life, it's first world problems
I toss the K-Cup in the Keurig, I ain't worried bout 'em
It's hard not to get caught up
We must remember what the good book taught us
He never gives you more than you can handle
Absorb the bullshit and put it through the proper channel
Drop back and punt, that's what my mother say
Met me a new chick the other day
She was kinda cute in an ugly way
Feelin' hella good on an ugly day

Turn on the television, and I ain't even faded
I think my liver full of liquor I ain't even drank
I'm on some other shit, I made another plate
If you was me you probably wouldn't made it here today
My mama told me I was quiet in that belly cryin'
My daddy left before the skin on the chicken fried
We in the kitchen with the 'frigerator open wide
Ain't got no milk for drinkin', coffee black if I should cry
They wanna tell ya that I told ya
For me to preach I need ta show ya
I'm in a room full of roaches
Sometimes I'm scared to turn the lights on

Back against the wall ain't got no place to go
Feeling real good on a hood day, ya you know
Same 'ol thing with a brand new attitude
But when the sun don't shine at least you got the moon

I don't know where my next check's gon come from
But I ain't unemployed, I'm just pursuing other outcomes
Like tweaking on this bass drum, and tweaking off this aged rum
Collecting all my thoughts instead of collecting some pay stubs
Time capsules for my generation's heroes and villains
Stories told while the trees are burning, campfires in us
What make us stronger are mistakes that should've already killed us
I find out holiest of people sometimes are the sinners
But I ain't gon' point fingers or name names
Cause everybody take a stumble in the jungle with snakes
So blaze your trail baby, you'll get paid
And don't worry what they say cause at the end of the day...

It's just another who smothers all that you dreamed of
What do they know of this little humble to-be love
I'm running numbers and crunching up all my meal stubs
Just tryna get a second helping of the real stuff
This is perspective, sunny side of directive
But when the clouds get dark, my lady gets ultra protective
I got your back, you got mine, don't worry if they drop dime
Cause if we need to rock climb, I'll lift you, no stop signs
What're we supposed to do when we get pushed in the mud And stepped on?
And other things that boil our blood, we've kept on
No rock bottom stopping my flood, this is the last dam we got and I'm not planning to budge because...

Back against the wall ain't got no place to go
Feeling real good on a hood day, ya you know
Same 'ol thing with a brand new attitude

You & I,....The End of the Beginning,2003.0,"Whuddup'tho
Check it out, it's the end of the beginning
The end being of like10 years ago when I first started rapping
All I wanted to do was make shit
Get it to people; see what they thought
And see how they felt about it, get my props or whatever
Now it's the end of that
Cause now I gotta do in-stores, photo shoots, interviews
(You guys come over here!)
Check the head with the fucking reps, man
And now it's like, it's not about you and me anymore
My job is to get it to the people, not the people who diss me
But the people who are feeling me, give you the
Soundtrack for your life (For you)

Now when I came to the game I was wet behind the ears
All I had was some raps that I wanted y'all to hear
Straight low budget I was underground thuggin' it
You think I gave a fuck about a publicist? (NO!)
You think I gave a fuck if you dubbed this shit? (NO!)
Now the industry is runnin' this underground shit (What?)
The industry is runnin' this underground shit (Oh!)
Now what that means is my crew wants a street team
My crew wants a video so they can be seen
And that was my dream since I was pre-teen
But as I got older and the world got colder
Reality swooped and put the dreams over
Now I'm content with the mastery of words
Realize the importance is just being heard
By fans who love you and you love them
And honestly it's love that moves this pen

It's about me!
It's about you!

Now what I'm trying to say is fuck a middle man
I just wanna make music and get it in your hands
All the bullshit in between is senseless
Just to get to you I gotta hop a few fences
Interviews, record pools, managers, checker fools
Lawyers, logos, contracts, promos, photos
Conference, contracts, constant combat
The psycho cycle's burnin' me out
I just wanna rock the mic and turn the party out
Earn a little clout with the butter in my mouth
But all the politics and bullshit make me wanna shout
(MOTHERFUCKER!! *growling under his voice*)
So an unintelligible rebel with a flow
So if y'all wanna step to my level then fa'sho
Let's go, strap bombs, lap on, kick com
Do what you wanna do cause it's all about you

Look, I don't do it for my wealth I do it for myself
And the moment you pick this up up off the shelf
See, you chose me and that means a lot
Work hard for your money and this is what you bought
Divine expert so far my best work
Is yet to be seen, but I'm steppin' to the green
With a putter in my hand spreadin' butter over bland
Was just another fan, now I'm addin' to the plot
Not thinking I'm the man cause I have what I got
Knowing you can lose it all in just one shot
But like I said I'm on the green staying down to earth
L.A. is the set, MidTown's the turf
But I'm speaking to the world when I pound this verse
Right through this mic into your ears
Took less than a second for me to get here
So forget your fears, and peep this here

By the way, Christina get thicker for a nigga, c'mon

Varsity Blues,Varsity Blues EP,2002.0,"What up though?
Welcome to Varsity Blues
My personal therapy EP for colored boys

It's when you start to get a gut
And you don't go out as much
You and your own homeboys barely even stay in touch
You be doin' too much
You tryin' to build a career
Got a one bedroom and a fridge full of beer
You smokin' cigarettes like it's goin' outta style
Used to be strugglin now you gettin' dough in piles
On the real you haven't been truely happy in awhile
Yo mind ain't right cause you got issues on file
That you been building since a child and still haven't dealt with
Thanks to Hennessy and chronic you haven't felt shit
But once you sober up it's like your brain is blowin' up
You get headaches and can't sleep
You nervous for no reason
When everything is quiet you can hear ya heart beatin'
Start poundin' hella fast and you feel like you tweekin'
I'm speakin' to y'all who know what it's like
And might have to be on medication for the rest of ya life

It's for them varsity blues
To all of my dudes
Who hustle hard and never learnt the meaning of lose
It's for them varsity blues
To my backpackin' crews
Who hustle hard and never learnt the meaning of lose
It's for them varsity blues
To my rips and taboos(?)
Who hustle hard and never learnt the meaning of lose
It's for the varsity blues
To all of y'all who pay dues
Still hustle hard and never learnt the meaning of lose

It's when you been with the same girl for over a year
Knowing deep in your heart that marriage is ya greatest fear
How you supposed to settle down with all these ladies out here?
So many different types: Black, Latin, and White
Now ya girl might be tight, but she's not the only one
And this is your life and you got only one
To live, so live it up
Or do you give it up?
That's why I'm singin' the blues for y'all who know what's up
If your girl cheats on you, she's a whore, she's a slut
But if you do the same thing, you just bein' a man
Now we can truely understand what our fathers went through
I know you cheated on your girl and it's botherin' you
But she'll never find out cause she was out with the crew
And she can't be hurt by what she never knew
But deep down inside you wanna tell her the truth
But if you do, she might leave so what should you do?


It's varsity blues cause I landed in
Most every hood activity and rap Mid City
To retire from these streets that for years attempted killin' me
My hood and dead homies will forever live in me
Keepin' me inspired through the drama life's giving me
I willingly sacrifice my life on these beats
So when I play it back I kill the demons in my sleep
Or at least to understand why I am the way I am
Mean-spirited and angry and I don't give a damn
Mad at the world, that's why I never had a girl
Incapable of lovin' anyone who could betray me
She made out with my best friend, it sorta drove me crazy
Along with the store that I opened down in AZ
And at the same time I blew the engine on my Cadillac
Cost me seven Gs so you know that set me back
Which eqauls varsity blues and panic attacks",https://genius.com/Murs-varsity-blues-lyrics
Murray’s Law,Murray’s Revenge,2006.0,"And I'm the four-letter word that you don't bleep out
Got a question for you rappers rollin wit'cha heats out
Is this really where you wanna be when Jesus come back?
Lyin 'bout your life, over beats comin whack?
And you say I'm backpack, cause I don't have a gat
Man I just love life, and I'm dealin with the facts
I'm young, I'm gifted, I'm beautiful and black
And my momma didn't raise no fool like that
I understand that you broke, you tryin to get money
But you don't start gangbangin in your mid-20's
Don't know nothin 'bout the beef, or the gang that you claimin
You ain't even worth namin!
... But I got a right hook that'll vacate your Timberlands
Take this outside, set it straight like gentlemen
I do feel the music so I kinda respect it
But don't confuse ill lyrics with real street credit, c'mon

Wat'chu gon' do man, ha?
Get knocked out
I'm real official like a referee with a whistle boy
Get it right man
My man Murs yo shut these cats down, holla!

I got my wallet in my pocket and my money in my sock
Cause that's how it be when it's funny on the block
Like it be on TV when these dummies try to rock
With they secondhand flows like they runnin on a clock
In a one minute cycle, I'm done with the rifles
The tecs, the 9's, the killers, the psychos
... Look, now can we party?
And I want a Shirley Temple cause I don't drink Bacardis
... But in a minute I'mma probably
Try to holla at a hottie with a, nice shaped body
If she's into what I'm into we should worship at my temple
I'ma, grind from behind as we wind to the tempo
If she break it down slow, then it feel like mo'
That's a Mayfield line for all of y'all who don't know
All I do is have fun and bring life to the fans
And I, don't need a gun cause I'm nice with my hands, c'mon

Nice with my hands dawg, never seen the floor man
Ask somebody, check the stats!
Murs man, yo get at these fools though
Let 'em know what's good baby, woo!

We shocked the world last year when, nobody heard of me
My boy he got skills that's like, musical surgery
Me you know the deal I'm a lyrical emergency
We keepers of the real, just consider us security
Of the world, 9th, somethin like top flight
As long as we in control everything's alright
While the rest will steer you wrong with them songs that they thought up
I wrestle with these words but I'm never gettin caught up
... In the drama and the BS
Jumped up out the underground, you know I gotta be fresh
Rhymes runnin through my mind all day, I press eject
I gotta lay 'em down on these beats cause they need wreck
Yesssss, I'm back for the title
And I brought an iron fist, just to smack all your rivals
Woulda thought I ran track, the way I ran through my rivals
Man I swear I'm the truth, slap my hand on the bible
Let's go",https://genius.com/Murs-murrays-law-lyrics
Summer,Captain California,2017.0,"Six niggas in a G ride
Squadded up, headed to the East side
They try to clown 'cause we from West L.A
Them niggas think we boujie and we just for play
Got a AK
And a .38
Lower-Middle class niggas movin' up the murder rate
The other day they was talkin' real big
Caught me slippin' up the West field with my kid
At the bus stop, with my baby's mom
Tried to keep it cool
Said I didn't want no problems
They took off on me anyway
All I had was my hands and some pepper spray
My lady and my son had to run away
They should've killed me but I lived to fight another day
I know where they stay
I know where they be
Your best friend is your enemy's enemy
We pulled up
Got the drop on 'em
Them bitch niggas went and called the cops on us
We got pulled over 'bout a block away
They snatched the big homie, and took his AK

I can't wait 'till the Summer come
The big homie get another gun
Motherfuckers thought that they wanted some
Now we the niggas that they runnin' from
I can't wait 'till the summer come
The big homie get another gun
Motherfuckers thought that they wanted some
Now we the niggas that they runnin' from

Deuce-deuce in the chrome 4-5
These niggas talkin' peace but the beef won't die
You can find me in that chair, put the needle to my arm
'Fore I ever let another man do me harm
'Cause I remember
When they said that they was comin' for us
We kicked back and waited all summer for it
Them niggas had they chance
And now the big homie home, and yep
We got plans
And I ain't talkin' 'bout no Summer vacation
I'm talkin' bout fuckin' off my probation
I ain't talkin' 'bout Disney Land
I'm talkin' eight of us, deep in a mini-van
No volleyball, sun tans or surfboards
Just a bunch of niggas dead from a turf war
That's how my best friend missed his first tour
'Cause we act like our lives ain't worth more

I can't wait 'till the Summer come
The big homie get another gun
Motherfuckers thought that they wanted some
Now we the niggas that they runnin' from

You didn't think me and El was comin like this
Def Jux Motherfucker and we run this shit
Got you all up on your keyboard stunnin and shit
Oh you got a couple jokes now you funny bitch (HA HA)
Have you laughin all the way to the bank
On point make a cut like we holdin a shank
Got it all up on ya back like you walkin a plank
Try to do it like this bitch you know how to blame
Do it double time all up in yo face
Like piranhas when you drop fresh meat in the tank
Fell off of the game can't keep ya rank
Mad cause you try to rob shit but you ain't
Been around no bullshit where crews peel clips
Niggas that kill for fun
Wanna talk that ill shit sayin how you kill shit
Bullets still in ya gun
Koolaid in ya veins so now you gotta change clothes
Cuz you pissed ya pants
Saw me durango said you wanna tango
Now this is the dance
Where ya shoes at where ya crew at
Claim you do gats but you do rap
What you gonna bust a verse right before the guns burst
Push ya girl on the ground so that you can run first
Now you about to get rolled up hold up wait
Just an emcee that was tryin to make cake
Now you gotta gun all up in ya face
All of a sudden found god like runnin mase
Thought it be fun to spun on tape
Now you wish you would have stuck to drum n' bass
But you had to be hard on the blue ball
When you never gang banged a day in ya town
Try to be a man and run the streets and the jungle gym nigga stop playin
Around
Lay it down
(Chorus: repeat 3X)
This is the Dance!
You don't wanna be late cuz I'm over on weight betta get ya shit straight
This is ya Chance!
You don't have to be fake with a heart full of hate just try to say thanks
Murs fall up on the spot like what up bitch
Approached by this girl like shutup bitch
Than I grab the microphone and I cut up kids
Like a hot knife straight through a butter stick
Now I'm in the spotlight about to rock all night
Shot of tequila than a hot mamacita
We sex than we swallow what? nine margaritas
Body on point so I follow the leader
Need more tequila so I swallow the liter
How can life feel sweeter (can't)
So I passed out rolled up do it again
Won't neva roll up ya crew in the wind
High velocity high viscocity slippin right pass your animosity
Fans are constantly, askin me
Who said what and who has beef
My crew got stuck in we to musty
So try to weigh it out with the fruit laid out (stomp the bastard)
Thats just played out theres more to ya life than underground rap
What you waste all ya time and you wanna run it back
All on the message board runnin ya yap
At the end of the night only wanted to chat
Now you know that you got issues
That early in the morn you should look at some porn
And jack off right in the tissue
Than call it a night thats probley the life
Go to sleep with the girl that you callin ya wife
Wake up to the same shit different day
Everybody onto work and they on the way
Cause we all got bills and rent to pay
Lend to the earth wasn't meant to stay
So before I'm gone I wanna make a hit song that'll always get some play
Got the homey el producto workin in the cut so what you got to say
(El-P)
You wanna trace along the pattern of fair please rap
I wanna pattern how the drunk end mechanism I.D. jury breath commence fresh
Test the match, metal on the chestplate tech
Better win a smile right, wanna frown like god right
With a highlight primal fright in a primal life of a double ox razor blade fade like 88'
We hit advance from the whips and lazer face oh break two three
God to analog monkey not me rock hard and shit
The radio flyer kit, flyin with a boombox pack wit' clips
Faggots wanna ratta tat tatter this
And a PT cruiser he creed lucifer
Here comes the booster bruiser, betta get used to losin movement
They couldn't move like el, ox, murs, lif the bazooka trooped in so useless
So useless tip that'll have a little truth in it like (poof)
Deep space nine milli mechanism fist raise the roof again
Who stays on a move that says
Chick wanna shake ring hetero crawl thru the trenches
Revelation manifacture eat senses or the city
Or compositive battle turn logic pretty
All the hard edge tomorrow brings heads or home up in me come get me
I'm for this shitty dizzy spinning all this cuff and progress whose with me
Fabolous thunder bird word nerd unda that tom pill shit
Who heard kill quick
They been together since 96' they still ride ya dick
I refined ya style while wild ways from an error with an automan mix
Community watch groups and lace young kids
Niggas don't skip me
I don't answer to you george bush or the war time commitee
Dumber than a mongulary race movin shit
With a heart of hell scribblin bruisin shit
Every time you make a move in the industry start the new movement kid

She so bad
Niggas pull out their wallets when she walk past
She bad, she bad, she make a grown man wanna spend all his cash

At a young age she was certain
She didn't wanna be a virgin
So she started wearing tight skirts and
In the mirror always practicin' twerkin'
And when that started workin'
She became a whole different person
Started smokin', started drinkin', started cursin'
Went from PG to the X rated version
She used to be a mormon
Now she on the pole and performin'
She say them square niggas borin'

""I could break this bitch""
""Told her hit the streets, and hoe make me rich""

An Eye For An Eye,Yumiko: Curse Of The Merch Girl,2012.0,"Makes you
It makes you want to kill
It makes it hard to breathe
Just to much to deal, with
Go ahead and slit your wrists
Open up a vein til the pain don't exist
If this is all it takes to bring you to deaths door
Then what the fuck were you ever given breath for
Why waste energy on someone unworthy
Why even think about gettin' your hands dirty
So many members of the murder club
Live with regret, wish they never heard of love
Crimes of passion, mindless action
Makes you want to go grab a nine and blast 'em, huh
Hope you don't mind me askin'
What is of the game from this type of reaction
What type of satisfaction, do you hope to obtain
When you can't change what happened

Nothing hurts worse than a broken heart
Another love lost, life torn apart
Feeling like you should have known from the start
What was once light has become dark
Started off sweet with a bitter end
Now how you sit and think about is revenge
Gone insane can't contain yourself
Til the other half knows all the pain you felt

Never thought it would happen to me
So I never stopped to think what my reaction would be
It just seems so matter of fact
First they hurt you and then you hurt them back
But an eye for an eye leaves the world blind
A heart for a heart makes us unkind
Creates a world of the walking dead
Void of joy and purpose left to march ahead
Mindless zombies out for blood
The definition of death, life without love
How far will you go when push comes to shove
Why are you fighting for a feeling that never was
Hate for love becomes a love of hate
True vengeance knows not an expiration date
Become consumed by the hate you give
And soon you're the one left with a life unlived


Put a piece of steel right through the chest
Show 'em that you really meant to the death
Sounds harsh what did you expect
When someone shows you no regard and such disrespect
Matters of the heart aren't to trifle with
So it's not your fault you're on some psycho shit
You can't choose who you love or the life you get
But you can choose to move on and be alright with it
When things aren't working out as you planned
And it's so unfair that you don't understand
How she can leave you for another man
Or how he ended up with her, makes you wonder, damn
Did they ever love you in the first place
Unrecorded love that's the worst fate
So you stay up late plannin' and plottin'
To make sure your pain is never forgotten",https://genius.com/Murs-an-eye-for-an-eye-lyrics
Ninety Five,F’Real,1997.0,"Now most of us could waste a whole lifetime
Doin shit we don't believe in, so I'm retrievin words
Of gold to expose my soul on the sheets
Combined with the beat of song, complete, to compete
Nah cause most of y'all won't understand it
Takin this existance for granted
Never goin after what you really want
Cause you ain't got the heart
So your life never starts to have meaning
Fiending for somethin to fill that void
Annoyed with the surroundings you picked
Cause they don't seem to fit your person
Rehearsin what they said would make you happy
Until you realized one day, ""Damn they trapped me""
But who are they anyway? To tell you how to live
A college degree, then a career, the only decent way to raise kids
But I disagree, see I wasn't put here to make a living
My living makes me, so even if it takes me a lifetime
I'mma write rhymes that I feel
Some shit for when I'm fired, that shit for when I'm chill
And even if I never make that ticket to a meal
I'll still be a success cause my purpose will have been filled

It came to me like a vision
The decision was all mine, combined with the fact
The lack of points on my GPA made a college hard to find
Walk a line into this world, of the so-called real
Never backed by a deal, so there was no desire to appeal
To the masses of those, who seemed closed captioned
To the fractions of light, that glimmer in the dimmer night
Sight obscured, by this BULLSHIT~! we must endure
Pure thought caught before it can become manifest
Leavin us obsessed, with these objects that bring temporary joy
Decoys in the game just like these b-boys and fame
To get you to stop focus on the art
And start focusin upon makin the charts
Not to start pointin fingers
Cause I had the benefit of learnin from others mistakes
Those who helped make hip-hop what it is today
To go through the shit and cause me to say
What the fuck is the music business anyway? Paradox
Coca-Cola commercials advertisin dreadlocks
Government officials tryin to communicate with us through hip-hop
Which should only serve as a demonstration
That our generation holds control of this nation
But the creation of Hip-Hop Temples won't help
If the music don't stay up to par
So many rap superstars supernova, and just burn out
Get addicted to the cash then the label turn 'em out

I hadn't picked up the a in days, just been amazed
On how many motherfuckers actually think that this rhymin is a phase
Ain't ate a decent meal in days
So I guess that this dispels the rumors that this rhyme shit pays
Nowadays, it seems MC means anybody on the block who can make words rhyme
But I remember a time when I rapped, and no one noticed me
And now fools is blowin up, off some third grade poetry
And it's a damn shame that we let the game get so low
Where it's the dumbest motherfuckers representin hip-hop, wherever you go
And these fools take pride in bein ignorant
Not to say that I'm innocent; cause I buy these fools records too
So the label can get paid and bring out, another ignorant crew
And I know too many heads tryin to get college degrees
So how long, will we tolerate remedial MC's?
So please, realize
If somethin doesn't evolve or advance, it dies
You listen to the shit out now, and tell me where the future lies...

Tomorrow,Good Music,1999.0,"It's another day
And I'm tryin' to keep my beadie lit
Thinkin' I should quit
A thought I swiftly forget as I'm proceeding up the block
Right past the bus stop
Where this fool tried to mug me
A trendy ass punk, I could tell from his rugby
With no idea on what a real thug be
I mean, it's a nice day it's just the people that's ugly
Stroll straight into the store
Where I'm greeted by the clerk who used to treat me like a jerk
Until my brother damn near snatched him up by his shirt and now he's speakin' out of fear
Step into the rear
Grab an ice cold juice, really wish I had a beer
Give him the change like, ""Here.""
Thinkin' it's only a year till I can purchase my own Bud
Weiser/wiser than I was when every other word out my little mouth was, ""Cuz""
Thought that I could rule the world
Dickies and jheri curl
Not to mention
This snake skin belt
But had to put the nightmares back on the shelf
It don't take a genius to figure out that gang bangin'
Ain't good for your health
But shit, neither is the liquor
Keep 'em both in moderation
The trials and tribulations of a Mid-City nigga
 
I walk the streets
Wonder what's on the horizon
For life is but a game through these eye's I'm analyzin'
Realizin' one truth
That everything should change
Enjoy it while you can, cause nothin' stays the same

It's another day
Still tryin' to keep this beadie lit
The smog is way thick
Just breathin' in L.A
It's mandatory you inhale at least a pack a day
On my way to the Dell
When I hear this fool yell
""Do you know where I can get a sack?""
The fuck kinda question is that?
I don't know you from Jack
Yet, I'm supposed to take you to my homie so he can get caught up with it
I mean, I know you lookin' for it
But I'm not the one to stress on your mission to get lifted
Just like them base heads who keep askin' me for work
When I'm only tryin' to kick it
Only makes the block hot
Now I can't go a day without speakin' to the cops
What's your name, where you goin', where you been, where you from?
I knew addition to my problems
Can't calculate the sum
And can't stand the rain of Avalon as I travel on yet another mission
Minus the umbrella
My story's Cinderfella
The one you least expect to live happy ever after
Seein' only hope after ruins of disaster
Is the curse and the blessing of a Mid-City bastard
The curse and the blessing of a Mid-City bastard


Yes another day
But fuck all of that beadie shit
I'm really gonna quit once I put my mind to it
Hard times, I rhyme through it
So it's yours to borrow
As long as some of what I say helps you make it through tomorrow
Hard to deal with the sorrow
But what's life without it?
You can't enjoy the good times without the struggle
Can't appreciate the whole picture minus the puzzle
You didn't ask for the challenge
But go ahead and do it
Inside we got the talent, just need the courage to use it
This one, I had to lose it
I should have wrote it down
I guess I'll misquote it now but day to day
I hold it down tryin' to make this music timeless
The call and the duty of Mid-City's finest",https://genius.com/Murs-tomorrow-lyrics
Let It Burn,A Strange Journey Into the Unimaginable,2018.0,"I'm a super soula
Stayin' present 'till the movie over
If I could do it all over I would do it sober
Maybe not
Maybe so
Ate a couple shrooms never made it to the blow
But I sold a lot of dro
Started with some stress then invested in the grow
Need money, see money
Built a music empire with a little weed money
Kirby that's my main man
Started out of Stockton California with the same plan
God married he a changed man
Lotta new friends but I still got the same fans
They say damn that's amazing bro
Flip the blood money now the currency is crypto
Shout out to equipto
Fuck Ann Lee let my nigga run frisko

Glued to our phones now we all seein' lies

Nina Ross,Sweet Lord,2008.0,"We talk about Nina
We talk about Nina
We talk about Nina...Nina Ross

Ha ha ha ha ha
Check out this bizarre
Story that I got about this chick and her car
I met her at this bar in Philly called 'the mall'
True school party and I'm feelin like a star
I'm chilling with the boys
We out to make some noise
Searching for a misses, mission search & destroy
You know the hit & run
You smash then you dash
Or you could fall in love soon as you get that ass
But me I was just chillin'
That's really not my thing
Tonic with some lime and I'm scoping out the scene
Then I seen Miss Thing
I locked her in my sights
Vision of perfection, my obsession for the night
Is she black or she white
Or another slight mix?
Mexican or Asian, dark-skin white chick
I know that's my thing
I jumped on it quick
Thicker than a snicker, had to kick it to the miss
She said, ""My name is Nina""
I said, ""(spanish)
You know I'm a musician with a penchant for latinas""
She said, ""That's cool I'm black
South African in fact
I understand your Spanish but your accent is wack
Quick on the attack
I kept my composure
Should I fall back
Man, I pimped in closer
""My english is just fine
And your beauty is sublime
On this continent miss, you should constitute a dime
I'm cool with the rhyme, but slicker with the drag
In a few minutes, I'll be feelin on the ass""
For her, she just laughed, I caught her by surprise
I said, ""I need directions
I'm lost in your eyes""
She fell for it guys
Hook, line and sinker
Now I start to feel like this chick's not a thinker
All attitude
No apptitude
Imagine her condition after she's had a few


Bartender, bartender, come serve her up
And put it all on this card right here
(Word up)
I talk, I talk
She drank, she drank
And then she said something like, ""I think
I can't
Make it to my car, can you help me out?""
I said no prob, she kissed me on the mouth
She tasted like a mixture of one fifty one
And straight gasoline, but I'm not a picky one
I grabbed her coat, then I grabbed her keys
Then I grabbed her arm and said,""Ma`am could you please
Lead the way''
(french)
This has got to be the best way for me to end the day
She looked better than the government check
It was her beauty not her booty, that's word to Mike Epps
You know I'm a Vet
So we marched and we stepped
She said, ""I'm parked around the corner, it's the Benz on the left""
A benz, a benz?! Did this broad say a benz?!
It took everything I had for me to not call my friends
Or lose my lunch
But then all at once
This girl sobered up, like she was never drunk
She said, ""That was all a front, Mr. Walk-Like-A-Man
Remember me a few years back, tour van?""
I stuttered, I stammered, I looked for the camera
And when I looked back, she was reachin' for the hammer
Pulled out the jammie, aimed it at my throat
She yelled, ""Stick em up!""
I said, ""Stop, no don't!""
Pistol whipped me, then she hit me
Swept me off my feet quickly
Got me for my DS and my Sidekick 3
She made me stand up then she told me strip down
""What you gonna with that glowstick now?""
She opened up the truck
Made me crawl into it
About to squeeze the trigger, I said, ""Please don't do it''
50 paint balls, at point blank range
I flinched, I bled, I screamed out in pain
She said
""Remember my face
Consider this a message to the women you disgrace
You use us then abuse us anytime you feel horny
Then bounce, and leave a fake number in the morning""
I cried, apologized
But as the tears started formin'
She laughed, blew a kiss and then she slammed the trunk on me",https://genius.com/Murs-nina-ross-lyrics
The Night Before,....The End of the Beginning,2003.0,"Now some claim gangsta rap's the CNN of the streets
But it's used as an excuse to pretend over beats
So I'mma lend my speech to all within my reach
To tell what really goes on from cells to the streets
Now in LA as you know there's a war going on
And it's been going on since before I was born
Though the undisputed origin has yet to be formed
It all used to boil down to the red and the blue
But that got fucked up as the many led the few
Now there's bloods killin' bloods and crips killin' crips
That's niggas killin' niggas they play kickball with
It ain't as simple as it was way back in '86
Let me give an example of some ol' MURS shit
My sect of mid-city is livin' on the edge
Cuz there's four gangs at war and none of them wear red
Any new car or face could mean bloodshed
Which led to the other night, I'm in my girl's Bug, right
I'm bout to hit the block to see who's chillin' on the spot outside
When I put it in park, the homey got a SK aimed at my ride
So I step out slowly, 'body no one fear
He yells, that's Murs I see his beard from here
But I told this whole story just to make things clear
So it don't seem weird when I tell ya this here

Last night I almost got shot on my block
Not the block where I live at, the block where I chill at
Where I keep it real at, and used to pack steel
At times I feel it's the spot I'll get killed at

Now in the entertainment industry they have sweeps weeks
But it's Thursday in my hood when they sweep them streets
A whole fleet of the task that they simply call CRASH
That's Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums
If anyone should ask what the acronym reflects
Put into effect to try to keep the gangs in check
Now they're just another gang out bangin' they set
Known for stirring up some shit when your hood is at peace
The only pig I know dying to create beef
But let me get on with my story so that all of y'all can peep
Once again I'm on my block right, known as Cloverdale
Playin' 2K2 while I'm talkin' on my cell well
While I'm inside eyes glued to the screen
CRASH rolls on my homies with the Thursday routine
What's your name, where you goin', where you been, where you from
We say the same thing while they just play dumb
We don't gang-bang we got J-O-B's
Still they make 'em turn around and get down on they knees
Me, I'm screamin' in the house I just won by three
So when I run out on the porch to tell the homies come and see
I see 'em on the ground and I'm like, god damn
Plus I got this black Nextel phone in my hand
They both yell freeze, guns aimed at me
And even though I drop my phone it's plain to see


It was a 2 month tour that ended in Japan
So the first day back I had to spend it with my fam
That night I was goin' down to holler at my folks
Have a few beers, smoke, and share a few jokes so
To the block I bail but when I got to the dale
Everybody's on the porch lookin' distraught as hell
They start to tell me on how some fools from the other side
Just tried to kill T, he don't fuck with nobody
Just be mindin' his biz
So you have to understand what an explosive situation this Terry thing is
My nigga never gang-banged a day in his life so
Fuckin' with him is not a way to earn stripes
But a way to get wiped off the motherfuckin' planet
I don't claim to be a killer with a heart made of granite
But try to kill my best friend and it's on goddammit
I had the big homey roll me over to my place
So I could pick up this nine I kept just in case
Of some shit like this, a box of hollow-tips
I slipped back to the block with the heat in my hand
We sat up in the house loadin' guns, makin' plans
They asked me was it stolen, and why I never told 'em
Nobody in the hood ever knew that I was holdin'
I told 'em I forgot but I did it on purpose
So they wouldn't ask to borrow it to go and do dirt with
Now we locked and loaded and about to hit the streets
When we look to the corner there's a Jeep tryin' to creep
With its headlights off, we all leap for cover
They start to let off - now how does this sound?
When I hit the deck, my pistol hits the ground
So the homey picked it up and let off a couple rounds
After that went down I knew I might get clowned
So I shook to the crib to take a shower and lay down
The next morning woke up, rolled out of bed
I called my girl up and this is what I said",https://genius.com/Murs-the-night-before-lyrics

Up on Lip Service, fuckin' with them porn stars
You say I'm out my mind, I let her sit on my face
But nigga, you the crazy one if you don't wanna taste
Haha
I'm not a dread
I'm not Jamaican
I'm not a homophob and I ain't Clay Aiken
Some niggas faker than a three dollar bill
I don't gangbang I don't care who's real
Nothin' but backpacks and bras at my shows
You tryin' to get shot I'm just tryin' to get chose
Nobody in the front row throwin' up signs
And motherfuck Manny if he don't resign
This the Dodgers fool, it's L.A. nigga
Why y'all gangbangin' like some L.A. niggas?
But, do your thang homie
It's just strange to me
Celebratin' death, that's just so lame to me
Get your money Curtis
Get your money Rick
I love it when a black man ain't gotta flip bricks
I'm tryin' to stack chips so I can change the world
Yeah, but on the way fuck a couple famous girls
Haha, Raven Symone homie, that's where the money's at
Soon as 
Miley turns 18 I'm gettin' some of that
Hanna Montana doe
Niggas can't stand the flow
They girlfriends love me, I'm the new D'Angelo
Post your comments I really don't care
What type of nigga comment on another nigga's hair?
I'm doin' fine homie
The ladies love me
I give a fuck if a man say it's ugly
You gay hairdressers can't take nothin' from me
Ha, on MTV for straight weeks
It's time for the president of hip hop speech
Of acceptance
Put down the weapons
It's love for everybody representin' they sections
They tryin' to hip hop lose another life
You livin' for the doe but you dyin' for what you write
I'm the opposite, I'm the black Dana White

It's the National Association
Of Stock Car Auto Racin'
And it's so amazin'
I got hooked on it from this girl I'm datin'
Hick chick
Thick as hell
Met her at a bar down in A.T.L
I bought her a drink, she said, ""I like the taste
But I can't talk to you until after the race.""
""If that's the case, then baby what's the deal?
I don't understand NASCAR, what's the thrill?""
She said, ""What?! It's speed, power, passion.""
""To me it's just a bunch of white boys in traffic.""
She laughed and she said, ""Shut up and watch
That's Jeff Gordan goin' for the number one spot
If the 48 car gonna win this race
Then me and you son, goin' back to your place.""

She told me she drove a fast car
She was flier than the chick at the last bar
So she took me to my crib, it wasn't that far
We fell asleep on my couch watchin' NASCAR

Let's go
We talked all night till the break of dawn
She said, ""I might as well stay cause the race is on.""
I said, ""That's cool. I'mma take me a nap
I ain't watchin' these fools do 500 laps.""
She said, ""It's not that it's the number of miles
It goes by fast, just watch for awhile
The average speed is a 180.""
I watched for awhile, ""These white boys crazy?!""
All up on the wall, smashin', turnin'
Every half hour, crashin', burnin'
I was learnin'
She was teachin'
Rules, points, the different teams
Hendrick, Penske, Childress, Roush
First I didn't know what she was talkin' about
Pretty soon, it started to connect
But then I remembered I was tryin' to have sex


My pole position, her Busch series
We did it from the back so she could see clearly
I had to back of it, yellow flag caution
Made a quick pit, green flag awesome
Change rubbers, now I got grip
Slow on them curves, huggin' them hips
Didn't slip, I was in the groove
She started runnin' hot so I made my move
No long term, I go for the cup
Full throttle, I opened her up
Balls to the wall, redlining
The last two laps is all about timin'
Hold my place, stayed in the chase
Right on pace, about to win this race
Checker flag, now she's screamin' my name
We watch recaps from victory lane",https://genius.com/Murs-she-had-a-nascar-lyrics
Got Damned?,....The End of the Beginning,2003.0,"{*vocal sample*}
So many... so many, so many questions
So many... so many, so many questions

One of a kind so there's nobody like me
And I guess thats the reason that nobody likes me
Or is it that I don't like anybody else?
Can't quite figure it out so I keep to myself
Too street for the sheltered, underground fan
Too intelligent for play on your FM band
So I thought to crossover, but I left them plans
My resolve's to do me and do the best I can
And yes I am, aware that most of my fans are white
But I'm love em all, scope em, and open 'em when I write
Some may chastize, from the side, crack jokes
Say I'm not black cus I rep with white folks
MAN PLEASE!
I hear the hate in your voice when you say it
So I'mma keep makin music for whoever wants to play it
If I dont go gold, then my people say I flopped
But if I go triple platinum, I'm not Hip-Hop

So I'm damned if I do, and damned if I don't
But I got it in my heart so I'll be damned if I won't
Make my dreams come true, my team come through
Man take it how you feel it; on the real it's on you
I'm damned if I do, and damned if I don't

Askin me how come I dont kick no rhymes for the struggle
Or no conscience, revolutionary raps man...

Look; I'm not your average rapper talkin shit about the government
Its not that I'm lovin it; it's where I live
They tried to bomb the place where I wanna raise my kids
I dont know what everybody seems to think this is
It ain't a game, ther is no reign, they want America crushed
If you don't like Bush, you still dyin with us
And trust I haven't forgotten bout the schemes they been plottin
On my people for centuries, I know that eventually we'll be on top
So what they fightin overseas? Hell, they fightin on my block!
The black sheep of America's family. We are the flock
Gettin lead to the slaughter
Have to work twice as hard to keep our heads above water
And god forbid we start to rise through positive means
They'll send out a whole black operative team
Everytime a black leader steps up, he gets trampled
Do I start makin speeches or just lead by example?

I'm damned if I do, and damned if I don't
But I got it in my heart so I'll be damned if I won't
Make my dreams come true, my team come through
Man take it how you feel it; on the real it's on you

But I got it in my heart so I'll be damned if I won't
Make my dreams come true, my team come through
Man take it how you feel it; on the real it's on you
{*vocal sample*}
So many... so many, so many questions
So many... so many, so many questions

So many questions. So what man? You hangin with El? You signed to Def Jux?
How much you get for your advance man?

Off this album right here I probably won't see royalties for 2 years
But shit I'm a straight up hustler! Ain't nothin queer in this
Oops! I shouldn't've said that cause it disses on my publicist
I dont give a fuck! Cuz this is one man's view
And with this mic I'mma show what one man can do
I'mma hustler motherfucker like this world has never seen
Could sell Chloroform to a room of Evergreens
Toured around the globe with my legendary team
So I shouldn't have to beg to get a G a show
500 people pay ten bucks, then where does it go?
In the fucking promoter's pocket?!!?
That ain't how its supposed to be
Nobody paid to see him; they paid to see me!
I'm not a full-of-myself, arrogant emcee
I'm only askin for a fifth, a measly 20 percent
Im not tryin to get over, I'm just tryin to pay rent!
Right now I wanna thank ya'll for lettin me vent
And I'mma catch ya next show at the bar gettin bent
Notice I put my heart in every word I meant
Presentin it to y'all with the sincerest intent...
Thank you",https://genius.com/Murs-got-damned-lyrics
Please Leave,....The End of the Beginning,2003.0,"Alright I'm ready
No, you're not ready
I'm ready, you're not ready
Motherfucker
(Indistinguishable singing)

Now this here's for your spouse or significant other
You were in love with the person, now you hate the motherfucker
Get the fuck out! Tell 'em to get the fuck out!
You weren't lookin' for love when you met 'em at the club
Y'all exchanged numbers and went out for some grub
You waited three days then decided to call
Went for dinner and a movie, then a walk through the mall
All you saw was the physical, a sexy individual
Never had the thought that they would make your life miserable
A couple more dates, consumate the mating ritual
Soon you will encounter the habitual liar
The sex was so good it set your body afire
But why are you still with this nut?
Every time they come around you get this feelin in your gut
Wanna tell 'em, ""Raise up,"" but your mouth stays shut
When you stop to think about how good they fuck
An' when the sex gets old you'll wind up stuck
So here's some words of wisdom that'll help you with the chore
Count up their I.Q. before you kick 'em to the door
It goes:

One, two, three, four
I had it up to here and I'm not takin' no more
So get the fuck out! You gots to get the fuck out!
Everybody come on! One, two, three, four
I had it up to here and I'm not takin' no more
So get the fuck out! You gots to get the fuck out!
Everybody!

Now say you have a homeboy who's been sleepin' on your couch
For weeks on end and he's (words walk em out?)
Get the fuck out! Tell him to get the fuck out!
Now he walks around your house in nothin' but his drawers
Throws the trash once a week and expects to get applause
Let him stay at your crib you was down for his cause
He was in between girls, or in between jobs
But it's still no excuse for him to be a slob
Your girl stays mad cause she's cleanin' up behind him
You can't get your calls when he's on the other line an'
You can't get laid cause he has the worst timin'
Knockin' at your door at odd hours of the night
If he does that shit again, you swear to God you're gonna fight
But you can't kick him out cause it's just not right
He has nowhere else to go, but you're losin' self-control
Wanna kill him in his sleep, God bless his soul
Maybe it's not that bad but it could get worse
So here's a little tip from your homeboy MURS
Before you tell him ""Bounce,"" do a countdown first
It goes:


Now let's talk about these old motherfuckers on the mic
Who were dope but now are whack and won't leave the spotlight
Get the fuck out! You gots to get the fuck out!
He had some albums that I loved way back in the day
But as he puts out new shit, the memories begin to fade
When I heard about the comeback I said ""No way!""
I was waitin' on the real, the anticipation built
But with age came degeneration of the skill
So I pushed it to the back of my mind, and hoped in time
Those fine memories would once again shine
But he just won't stop, even though his album flop
Everytime I turn around his new one's about to drop
Make me wanna take all his old records off the shelf
Cause the man I now hear's a shadow of his former self
So when he stopped on tour, in my town for a show
I played a true fan and was in the front row
As he started doin' classics, then he stopped and said ""No""
We had to say we love the new shit, before he did the old
I tried to count the countdown, but then I lost control
It went one, two, three, four
I had it up to here, and I'm not takin' no more
So get the fuck out! You gots to get the fuck out!
Everybody come on!

 It is my good friend, MURS
 Aw, shit. What's up fool? How you feelin'?
 Oh I am just fine my good friend MURS
And what are you doing with yourself on this bright and sunny day?
 Man, I'm just tryin' to do this new song with Kaos and Thes
 That sounds like a splendid thing to do
 Man, we havin' a little trouble though
 Awww, trouble? Wh-what is the trouble?
 Well, well shit. We ain't got the motherfucker to sing in the chorus
I ain't got nobody to do that shit. What? Hey fool do this shit for me c'mon
 Well, it would be no trouble at all
 
La la la la

La la la la

Woke about noon, gave thanks
Choose to be amongst the ranks, of the breathin'
Which enhances my chances
Of leavin' behind a mark I set 24 hours ago
The day devoured slow
Whoever calls me first, basically, decide, how that shit is gonna flow
Maybe it's the crew callin' me to hit the studio
To make some new songs, or a show we gotta do
Then there's option number two
My niggas down the block
Callin' me to hit the spot
For the 64 session
Playin' Bond, bullets flying, niggas lettin' off aggression
Talkin' shit, gettin' drunk, smokin' weed, sittin' in front of the TV
Yeah that's cool
But there's always option number three
Which could be a female
And that's when we males tend to sell out
Just the thought of gettin' some pussy
Could change the whole route
But I gotta do that new Legend's song without a doubt
And I ain't seen my niggas on the Dell since the tour let out
But for sho' I wanna see what this girl is talkin' bout
But before I figure any of this shit out
(What?)
I gotta get some cash
Plus mom let a note for me to take out the trash
And first and foremost a nigga gotta wash his ass
Then proceed to get dressed
While I'm sortin' through this mess
Thinkin' I can't hit all three, but I can probably hit two
""Tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do"" - KRS-One


Now this is how I handle the day
First call the homie Jay down at B-Boy Kingdom to see
How many new tapes he needed me to bring in
He said, ""Shoot a dub""
So I called a girl, I had met at the club
Told her to come swoop me so I can get these ends
After that drop me off on the block
Told her she could have the afternoon, to kick it with her friends
That night she get with me
So before she left I made sure when I paged her
She knew where to be
Everything seems to be movin' right on course
So I strolled to the spot and said what's up to the little homies
Kickin' it on the porch
Strolled in the house talkin' shit
Niggas quickly picked up the sticks
Ready to get sprayed
We played pistols in the basement
Of the Facility, with hand grenades
Oh shit, there go my ride
I walked outside, that fool Tom
Fulled up, just in time
Cause fools is talkin' about playin' some proximity mines
So we hopped in the Buick
Headed to the studio so we can do this new music
And when we get there as usual
Everybody else was late
Into the recording booth and I used hella takes
So we didn't leave the lab until some minutes after eight
Thought it might be too late
To hit that dip older than me
But I paged her anyway
And in fifteen minutes, she was at where I told her to be
She knew no disrespect was intended
Plus this girl knew, that I came, highly recommended
And on top of that she got to peep the new Legends tracks while she was gettin' blended
Hit her off somethin' tight
So she dropped me off at the crib, sometime about midnight
A full days work


 And we'll see you later
 Aye, where's Grover at?
Tell that nigga to quit smokin' that beadie and come here and do his overdubs
Tell him he's on track two, track two
What the fuck you mean you gotta hurry up and get back to the hood nigga?!
Come in here and do yo shit! Hit that shit right here. Aye, do this


Aye Grover can you come here and get these drums?",https://genius.com/Murs-24-hrs-w-a-g-lyrics

Just, just kill me with music anytime, c'mon
(Ladies and gentlemen) Ladies and gentlemen, (boys and girls) boys and girls
Listen, listen, (it is the return) the return (of Murs Inatra) hahahaha
(The leader of the pack), the chairman of the board
The chief of the game and look
I wanna send this one out to everyone I love
You all been so beautiful to me
Yes, yes, look

I'm something like an alien, I don't understand
Your ways and your actions, I'm a different kind of man
I was raised on the block, got saved from the block
Came back to the hood and spent my days on the block
It's the way that I talk, you can hear it when I'm pissed
The way that I walk is something like a crip
With a B-Boy Rasta and a skateboarder twist
The woman that I love, she gotta handle all of this
I'm like ten different dudes rolled into one
I hope she choose to fight instead of choosing run
One minute for your yoga and I'm tryna relax
The next I'm punching walls and I'm on the attack
And I ran some, fought some, caught some, dropped some
Fumbled, then it crumpled and I stumbled on this hot one
And she's so awesome, everyday's a blessing
Put the drama all behind us and we tryna start fresh man

And man everyday should be a new start
Every time the sun rise, it should erase all the BS you went through yesterday
Ain't no point in tripping about what you went through in the past
Cause you can't change it
So you might as well love what you got and appreciate the moment that you're in
Cause you might not get another one
Pay attention!

So many people showed me love when I was in a drought
Eligh's mama let me stay at they house
Back when my own mama, she went and kicked me out
TS mama let me sleep on her couch
Said make a million dollars then you can take me out
I thought that she was so fine, it made me wanna shout
And of course Naomi always tried to pay for everything
Wish y'all got along cause she might get this wedding ring and
You can't have everything
Tripping over little stuff, you never see the better things
And my nosy ass aunty
Will always have my back when none of y'all want me
And y'all get my love, wherever they go
To my mama selling merchand' every LA show
Counting in and counting out, she taught me what it's all about
The best women ever got my back no doubt",https://genius.com/Murs-its-for-real-lyrics
Survivor,Captain California,2017.0,"I wanna say this about Murs too
I think he's a superhero because he's doing something that hasn't been done either, you know?
I know when I came up and started doing the music
Maybe I didn't have the courage that Murs had to say, ""You know what, this isn't right""
You know, uh, kids and family making the right decisions
The way he that he does his music he's telling you the artist truth

Close the door and give us a moment
I'd like to scrub the floor with all of my opponents
Tell it how it is take it how you want it
Sound a little different in that radio rap don't it?
'Cause this is what it sound like
When real motherfuckers get around mics
21 Savage with the rhyme
You started out on YouTube, dabbin' for the vine
Slow-mo dancin' on that pop shit
Like Coco better beware of that drop kick
That Vocal will make the air wave toxic
Spittin' so local man these suckers can't stop it
Since before local, then I hop in the cock pit
In Kamizaze, that's how you suppose to hit the block bitch
Modern day, 
ghetto
 profit
How could I not be?
I was raised on that Pac shit
Like a Go-pro, yeah homie watch this
Used to be local now I'm dancin' on top bitch
20 years deep, hoe grab your galoshes
Since Project Blowed I've been so obnoxious
We were screamin' on them whack niggas
Can't you see I'm excresing demons, get back nigga
I ain't been right in a long time
Shout out to Mitchy Slick and the Wrongkind
From Dago to the Bay niggas know me
Used to be Greyhound bound now I'm OG
One call will get a rap nigga lit up
Call to golden state y'all need to fuck with us
Killas, hustlers, pimps, weirdos
Call 'em criminals but those is my heroes
When Eazy-E signed Will.i.Am
You want a picture of that moment? Nigga, here I am
When Cypress Hill made Killa Man
I had just started writin' in, I was still a fan
Made my first my song at Mike Caren house
Back when my mama used to worry 'bout my whereabouts
Catch a grown nigga in a cypher I would air 'em out
Curfews and college what I did not care about
I was off on my own
Captain of my own ship tryin' be grown
For a Captain to save a hoe and it was on
Before he had the formula I started making songs
Going on 2 minutes and I'm still flowing
This nigga, oh gosh, got the horns blowing
And it sounds so triumpant
I came up in the 90's I ain't never for that punk shit
Four 15's in the trunk shit
Get the function jumpin', bumpin' enough for the funk bitch
Or should I say ""bitch""?
'Cause Todd Shaw taught us all how to get rich
And Snoop Dogg is a real Crip
The truest Piru I met was my nigga Quick
Who me? I'm only Nick
But I'm 'bout to rap my ass off on this shit
I'm from West L.A, Mid City y'all
But the culture came from New York City, dawg
Made me a superhero in so many ways
Now I'm flying all around the world and I'm gettin' paid
And any day know this shit could end
All you got is your faith, and your family, and your friends
Let us begin

Look, not now, but right now, it's time to change the game
A new style, something different, you know, uplifting
New sound from the West that we all can get with it
The Pacific to be specific
Ain't another rapper on the whole coast this gifted
Missed the magic, aristocratic, yeah, automatic, yeah
Systematic, look, my grey anatomy bust through they academy
Crushed the main frame, it changed the game radically
Move with such agilely, crews to try to battle me
Totally tear washing their teeths, another tragedy
Never has the game seen such savagery
The audacity, all of these rappers mad at me
Rising so rapidly, I defy gravity
Next up is Dogg, I thank y'all for having me!

Time is now, it's going down, in my town, time is now

Low riders, yeah, stroke and they high
College brains, yeah, they smoke on they pot
'Till it's old gang cold, and it's meant to be sold
Stay tuned 'till the next episode, when we ride and roll
If he fake, he foe, if he real let the story be told
In a land where you will be exposed
OGs, hood rats, and the punk po-pos
Hard to grab fo' toes, and dip low lows
Ride slow with the top pulled back
Pulling on some of that, sippin'  on some 'yac
Stars with the Mars, splurges with Murs
Blank out and make out
Stay way up, cause it's about to go down, for real

Time is now, it's going down, in my town, time is now
Cause it's going down! (In my town, right now!)
Right now!

I heard Jim Brown got the OGs talking peace
Life without beef on these LA streets
Something I thought was beyond belief
Sunday, ain't nobody tripping at the beach
Nine deuce troops and what happened to the movement
And you drive-by shooting, nigga, what is y'all doing?
We gotta get up and change the dial
The time is here, the time is now, yeah

West Coast Cinderella,Fornever,2010.0,"West coast cinderella...

Now let me tell you 'bout this girl I know
Pretty little something with a heart of gold
Her name was Cindy, she was destined to great things
I'll start the story of when she was 'bout eighteen
She lived in this little house south of Arlington
Right at the bottom of the hill where the harlem's is
Three room
Mates, they gave her hell
Well they was sisters but you really cound't tell, cause
They would yell at her, would clown her
Nothing good to say whenever they around her
They Sat around all day and did nothing
Had two jobs, get pregnant and fucking
Wellfare queens who tought they slick
They tought they had a maid living of the week
They were just so mean, made her work double shifts at the crisp cream
So fed up she wanted to kick and scream
But she helded all in like Listerine
And it burned like so much venom in a mouth
But if she spoke up they probably kick her out
See, they had the same damn daddy, she had the different one
Momma was a victim of the old Hit & Run
Treated them like gold, tretad her like whatever
But Cindy kept hope that things will get better
Prayed every day for a miracle to come
Is amazing how beautiful a spirit had become
She dind't blend in to give in to the wackness
Stayed positive and that made her attractive
And that attracted a man she deserved
Handsome little devil with a heart like hers
He wasn't rich or drivin' a Bentley
It seemed like things were looking up for Cindy
I know you feeling like the world is against you
Hurt so deep you don't wanna continue

Ain't nothing but a west coast cinderella
You felling low me, no one to deffend you
Hold your head high baby I believe in you

The sisters tried to hate, they wanted to date him too
Everytime he come trough they say ""Hey boo""
But he never feel bored, he was thick to the game
Never had he seen three chicks so lame
And the mother shows up, ploting and scheming
Been the one resent for a sinfull demons
Sittin he was dreaming about the house and the kids
But her mother came trough and guess what she did
She played sick so she needed a help
And Cindy had no time for a man overselves
So he said ""let's take care of her togheter, I'll stay by your side till your mother get better""
But that didn't work no injest wouldn't do
Her mother dind't want her dream to come true
Moma got well and Cindy moved out
So she sent the three sisters over to the house
Her man was gone when the girls came over
They jumped her and putted Cindy in a coma
For three weeks she layed silent in the bed
Her man prayed everyday that she wasn't dead
He sat by side with some books that he read
One day spoke to her and this is what he said
""I know you've been struggling alone forever
But comeback to me and I swear I'll make it better""
With that her eyes opened and then she smiled
Cried a little bit and they prayed for a while
They stop fighting and gave it over to god
Soon her sisters got caught up for wellfare fraud
Her mama Locked up for selling weed on the side
Now there's nothing but love on the house she reside
Putted all behind and they started a new chapter
Now Cinderella lives happly ever after

Brotherly Love,....The End of the Beginning,2003.0,"This is dedicated to all my little brothers, little homies, yo check it out

Man you 21 now and I still can believe it
Been living on your own, just hard to conceive
That you on the right track, out pursuing that knowledge
But a few years back I couldn't see you in college
You was all out cripping, brought a gun in the house
My first thought was to take it, give you one to the mouth
But never that, we been through way to much
I always tried to give you guidance but not say too much
Tried to lead by example, didn't I have some nerve
Telling you stay out the street while I was out slanging herb
But I always preferred you do it smarter then me
You didn't have to prove nothing being harder then me
You helped mom at the cleaners
Stayed away from misdemeanors
I was proud of you then
Please believe I still am
Don't let the world get you down, throw you off your program
Life is hard, even harder on a young black man
If it gets rough blow a blunt and bump some more slow jams
Know every man with a badge is probably a punk
But don't ever risk your freedom, just to throw one punch
Let a coward be a coward, he has to deal with his past
I know these pigs deserve it but give em a pass
I know you wanna keep it gangster, just do it with class
Above all remember this, no matter how big you get
I'm still your big brother and I can always whoop your ass

They say a wise man knows nothing, so I know a lot less
But I been where you at homie, put to the test
The answer lies deep within, so open your chest
And find God within yourself and he'll show you the rest
I know the world is against you and your going through stress
But long as you still breathing God, and know you been blessed
The only sin is giving up, there's no need to confess
Find a God within yourself and he'll show you the rest

Now take that doo-rag off when you get in my ride
Man that shit ain't fresh, you're supposed to wear it inside
Not under bandannas or under a cap
I might be getting old but I don't understand that
You want your hoodie on or off, please make up your mind
Trapped in a rap video, losing your mind
Getting lost through someone else helps you find yourself
I guess that's how it works
I seen this kid the other day with murder written on his shirt
And never been to a funeral
Now am I out of touch, if I say it's unusual
This dude will sing a love ballad to his homeboys, before a young lady
Now ain't that crazy
If you didn't love that bitch then why you make her keep your baby
Ooh abortions not right
But just the other night
You were a killer pull a trigger before you have a fare fight
But if you value one, then why not value every life
Its obvious you know the difference between wrong and right
Its not about being self, its hard to follow the light
When you're surrounded by darkness, almost drowning in evil
Been searching for some help but still ain't found no real people
Here's a shout, know we out here, we struggling too
Some of us do it legal; some will thug our way through
We got to fight to show the world that our youth are intelligent
So keep it gangster in your CD changer, not your residence

They say a wise man knows nothing, so I know a lot less
But I been where you at homie, put to the test
The answer lies deep within, so open your chest
And find God within yourself and he'll show you the rest
I know the world is against you and your going through stress
But long as you still breathing God, and know you been blessed
The only sin is giving up, there's no need to confess

You and Me Vs. Everybody,UnKnown,2020.0,"You want the answer to the question in my mind
Absolute truth and proof of the divine
No longer free became a state to your survival
Your service is my purpose, fatherhood my only title
No ID the  before don't exist no more
Type of  that made Jay create the 4:44
Legacy-legacy is what I'm doing this for
You're the fifth in the mind of great entrepreneurs
Generational wealth land 
That was worked by the hands of my great grandfather
You never have to worry about the job trying to stress you
But racist police will still try to arrest you
Trying to test you on a case take life as fucked up
It ain't right, you was born into a fight
But I put this on your granny, she taught me how to raise a man
I will murder any man that ever raise a violent hand

When I look at your eyes
I can see their mind
Everything will be fine
When I look at your eyes
I can see their mind
You and me vs everybody
Vs everybody
You and me vs everybody
Vs everybody, everybody
You and me vs everybody

You're the definition of day one
Responsibility, you don't run away from
Set goals, pursue with your whole soul
And when it comes down to it
Never fall, never 
Let your haters talk, your reputation never suffers
You'll be judged by the treatment of your mother and your brothers
For words that you speak and the deeds that you've done
And if the world's a better place when you leave, then you've won
You're a one-of-one, you're special not better
Sometimes the strongest of us are barely holding it together
So never judge a person if you don't know their struggle
Just by their accomplishments
Remember to stay humble
Everybody makes the stakes fall victim to the snakes
Time will always separate the real from the fake
What you wanna manifest, you gotta speak it into existence
I'm living you these words so you can reminisce and listen

When I look at your eyes
I can see their mind
Everything will be fine
When I look at your eyes
I can see their mind
You and me vs everybody
Vs everybody
You and me vs everybody
Vs everybody, everybody
You and me vs everybody",https://genius.com/Murs-you-and-me-vs-everybody-lyrics
Free,Sweet Lord,2008.0,"People feelin' that. Oh man. One two one two. I smell somethin' cookin'
Yeah yeah yeah. Okay, give us freedom. That's for real for real
Turn it up a little more G. That means turn it up fool
Yeah, this is it. Yeah yeah. 9th

I'm free
To change the world to change the times
I'm free
To change my life to change my mind
I'm free
To have hope to have new ideas
I'm free to live my life without the pressure of my peers
I'm free
To make a choice to take a chance
I'm free
To take my voice and make a stance
I'm free
And now I know why the caged bird sings
I'm free to be me so let me do my thing
I'm free

Like a fresh out of county no bond
Bout to get some Fatburger and go see my moms
Like the health care need to be
The fact that it ain't is just obscene to me
Free is a state of mind a state to live
Can't be selfish, people hate to give
Love, worth more than gold
But it's free and it's got to be part of soul
Told, I was free 1863
That's until I got clipped by the LAPD
Free to be oppressed for 400 years
Free to leave this country free to stay right here
To make a difference
Free to make change
Free to be normal while I'm free to be strange
From every mountain top where they let freedom rang
There was freedom in the songs that my ancestors sang


Like I'm tax exempt
Free to knock out gangstas and smack some pimps
Cause I'm free to be a whole lot more than that
Free to see the whole world and be more than black
Free to be a plain ole human being
I'm free to write songs about the wrongs I seen
I'm free to make a buck at anyone's expense
Do what it takes to make my rent
But no act will ever be free of consequence
It don't cost a dime to use your common sense
It's Free like Will when I'm free to kill
Anybody that try to knock...
Let me chill
I'm free from anger, I'm free from it
When they grab a hold of me
It's free I break
I'm free to be a failure
Free to be great
And I'm free to be the one who decides my fate


Like my style was in '93
Now there's a whole bunch of dudes tryin' to rhyme like me
Work hard young man
Homie grind like me
And you can be whatever you wanna be
Like the blood, like the love of Jesus
Like the love that the Koran teaches
Like space and the outer reaches
Can't Arrest my Development
 I'm free like Speech is
Like a genie
Fresh out the bottle
When these MCs is free not to be role models
And me
Well, I'm free to be one
Free to fix a problem where ever I see one
The government came to my hood with free guns
Got us all scared, now I'm thinkin' I need one
But I'm free from fear
And if you already free then let me hear you say ""YEAH!""",https://genius.com/Murs-free-lyrics
The Scuffle,....The End of the Beginning,2003.0,"Southern California underground funk assassin
Known to blast the competition, break em up like New Edition
I'm gonna rob you, throb you, rip you with mics
And make you question your commitment like my dicks in your wife
And I'm hitting it right
Now how's that for a visual to make your brain stall
Your old ball and chain now chained to my wall
I'mma reign til I fall, when I do I'll get a stunt double
Like to play it smart so I hump when there's trouble
While you try to go for broke with them punks in your huddle
I play Voldemort and bring the magic to the muggles
Just dove in the struggle, not waiting waist deep
Licking kicks off the snares while you suckas waste beats
Lose your hunger for success once you taste defeat
So I'mma show you how to eat
You gotta let it wet your appetite
Spit it out and rap just tight
Keep a sense of humor and just kick back and laugh at life

It'll drive you crazy if you let it take over
Have you stressed to the point where you can't stay sober
It'll drive you crazy if you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
It'll drive you crazy if you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
It'll drive you crazy if you let it don't forget it
Take control of your life or you just might regret it

That's how I got these panic attacks and frantical raps
Thats cold as a chick mixed hispanic with black
But still spit it so hot they'll have to ban it from wax
Or at least press it on that heavy european shit
So you can't want beef when you're a vegan bitch
Props to BLX, I hope y'all see them checks
I'm upping woman from the back like a CRX
And real heads can stop waiting cause we are next
Def J-U-X and Living Legends coming through when I play two sets
Like Shock G and D.U. don't know the half about blowing up
I call you see too
Treat it like an opening act of movie preview
Cause everybody in the house came to watch what we do
Since your rhymes are as fly as a fucking Emu
So even if I only make MTV2
It's better than me stuck in a rut being you

It'll drive you crazy if you let it take over
Have you stressed to the point where you can't stay sober
It'll drive you crazy if you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
It'll drive you crazy if you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
It'll drive you crazy if you let it don't forget it
Take control of your life or you just might regret it

Quit letting your girl run you life and homie be a man
Your lady's not supposed to be your one and only fan
Or your manager, that's a conflict of interest
I expect nothing less from a product of incest
I been fresh since my first song in '92
When I got with 3MG we put it down since high school
So mother fuckers, know, how, I, do
I shove this mic down your throat and start speaking into you
And my mic sounds nice, check one
I can sing in the middle of this verse just for fun
Like, la la la la laaa
I know it's off key but when Oh No's on the beat
He can make something even that vile seem sweet
As revenge on your ex-girlfriend who fucked your best friend
While you were drunk passed out in your den
So while you were downing Hen
She was going down on him

It'll drive you crazy if you let it take over
Have you stressed to the point where you can't stay sober
It'll drive you crazy if you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
It'll drive you crazy if you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
It'll drive you crazy if you let it don't forget it
Take control of your life or you just might regret it",https://genius.com/Murs-the-scuffle-lyrics
Murs Rules The World,MURS Rules the World,2000.0,"What up though?
Guess what? MURS rules the world
Everything you touch and see
Not a portion of a smidgen
The whole fuckin' world is under my jurisdiction
No restrictions, my volition
From the way I rock the mic you might have had the suspicion that
MURS rules the world
My new composition aptly titled ""Smackin' Rivals""
Rap revivals, tappin' spinals, snatchin' vinyl's cause it's spinnable
And packed with your essential
Hip hop minerals
A life time criminal
I have to do a show when the energy is minimal
And asshole cynical
Original with syllable
Analog to digital
Accumulate residuals
Stimulatin' visuals
And demonstrate within my flow that
MURS rules the world
Not just a catchy phrase, a way of life
Extreme confidence when I lay this mic
Audio orgasms when I deliver to heads
Like my 30 minute workout
Makin' women shiver in bed
Not livin' for bread or livin' for cheese
I'm givin' MC's somethin' to measure careers by
I tower Sears high
While you Grand Canyon low
I'm All American, you just a band standin' ho
I man handle flow
Bitch slappin' drum kicks
Beatin' on every single snare like I'm crackin' drum sticks
It's done effortless like mackin' dumb chicks
I'mma let you know this son of a bitch named
MURS rules the world
And there will be no takin' over
Makin' douja off the books
That makes grown ups stop and look
Makin' Grover sing my hooks
Cause I'm just that type of nigga
Makin' models out of strippers
Makin' water out of liquor
The miracle man
Rule the spherical land
With imperial plans
All who hear it are fans
My material expands the conscious and hardcore
Everything you checkin' for
Plus a little bit more
I reckon I'm the sure shot
For hip hop consumers
What collection is complete without the world's rightful ruler?
Bud Light up in the cooler
When I'm chillin' in Tuscan on the southside
MURS the man with the mouth as big as all outside
Heard some shit by quiet niggas
I doubt they down to ride, cause I know many of 'em
And plenty of 'em pussy
I talk the talk and walk the walk
Rap to your motherfuckin' face and I dare you to push me
Cause MURS rules the world
Oh what you didn't know? It's kinda difficult to miss
The person who said ignorance is bliss wasn't listenin' to this
M-U-R-S
And I'm back with a vengeance like a sack on 4th and inches
A little more cocky and a tad bit pretentious
A lot more refined but I guess you'll get used to it
Like hittin' a pay phone with a quarter and dime
I'mma dedicate this album to everyone who cried when they killed Optimus Prime
Bang on every verse like I'm locked in the rhyme
I'm cockin' my mind
Ready to shoot the shit with any individual, group or clique
I guarantee they meet they fate
See I put out my own albums, so they can't recuperate
On the low you look for hooks like a fish pursuing bait
But I HATE
Verse chorus verse chorus verse
See I'm tryin' to innovate
But enough of that for later
Let's get one thing straight
Whether you tryin' to write a rhyme
On the net killin' time
Backstage snortin' lines
At work on the phone or at home with your girl
Just remember one thing
One thing bitch

BT$,....The End of the Beginning,2003.0,"This for everybody... Who doesn't have a lot of money
But you have a little money, and when you get that little money...
You spend that shit
I work hard for my money, so hard for the money
Every time I get a little, I'm gon' spend it like a dummy
If my money was a NBA team and I was the head coach of the squad
I'd be Jeff Van Gundy, wastin' all of my funding
My wallet stays hungry
Mad like Pooh with the pot and no honey
Money wouldn't be funny if I stuck to my budget, but my motto is ""fuck it""
Buy now, cry later, hopin that everything works out in my favor
I keep my receipt should I seek a release
From this contract of commerce, speakin of which
I'm the most at ease when I'm spending my grip
But don't trip, I'm a retail slut
Stimulatin the economy so I can get fucked
When I go out shoppin, I go for broke
I mean literally, there is no hope
Cause I'm a big time spender, let me buy that shit
Put it in the bag soon as I eye that shit
My pockets so broke, about to cry and shit
But do you think I care, it comes slow and goes fast (It's just not fair)
I'm a big time spender, let me buy that shit
Put it in the bag soon as I eye that shit
My pockets so broke, about to cry and shit

December 23. 2002
Around midnight, where were you?
Me, I was out for them Episode 2 Star Wars action figures
(Wait, back up my nigga, you can't mean toys?)
Hell yeah fool, me and a hundred white boys
We was waitin in line
Some buy to collect, some to sell online
(Man, hold up, you can't rhyme line with line)
Man, that's not the point
I spent two hundred plus before I even left the joint
If my mama only knew
I was out droppin notes when I owe her a few
My ass'd be through, You wouldn't be hearing this song today
Can you say, buyers remorse
Now I'm prayin that my CD's sellin out in the stores
Cause I hate being poor
I may have dropped a couple hundred but I'm one with the Force
And I'm a big time spender, let me buy that shit
Put it in the bag soon as I eye that shit
My pockets so broke, about to cry and shit
But do you think I care, it comes slow and goes fast (It's just not fair)
I'm a big time spender, let me buy that shit
Put it in the bag soon as I eye that shit
My pockets so broke, about to cry and shit
But do you think I care, it comes slow and goes fast (It's just not fair)
I mean, it comes and it goes, making funds from shows
The next day I'm at the mall buying tons of clothes
Eve though I get free shit, hella LRG shit
I'm calling El-P: Quick! Send me some loot
I'm over budget, I'm recordin (??)
When that check comes, I hit the swap meet and I buy some new Jordans
I'm often at Slauson, trickin of my chips of
Bootleg movies and, brand new kicks
I'm scan-da-lous, but I just can't help it
Call me what you want just, don't call me selfish
Always think of others, moms and my little brother
It's the thought that counts, so I keep'em in mind
As long as they stay out of my pockets, that's fine
As for my girl? Shit, what can I say?
Bought her a rice cooker and some lingere
I know it's for my benefit, but that's how it is
When you
Big time spendin, let me buy that shit
Put it in the bag soon as I eye that shit
My pockets so broke, about to cry and shit
But do you think I care, it comes slow and goes fast
And it's just not fair, BT$
Born to shop
Buy that shit

Ups & Downs,MURS & The Misadventures of the Nova Express,2008.0," 
I been up I been down
I've been high I've been low
I've been known to spit flows and rip shows to get doe
Get hoes and get laid and get paid for the spit
And in so many ways I'm amazed by this shit
It's a trip that I get all this fame and a check
When it's done show love for the game and respect
The effect that I have on the world as a whole
So absurd my control with these words from the soul
 
The greatest, underrated, off the coast of the Raiders
Most famous, yet crusadin' over shakin' off the haters
People said I made it cause I made it to a major
But it's pretty small potatoes cause it's all the same paper
They all caught the vapors when I got my own tour goin'
You know how them fellas be, jealously sure showin'
Hey man I love it, it's my spot if they covet
Never hatin' on the haters, find a way to rise about it
I think nothin' of 'em
Tell 'em take it all and shove it
Fools smoother mo' shit than a Chicken McNugget
And when the chicks love it, it's a hit to the public
So I'm feelin' like, fuck it, they can take my dick and suck it
Until I kick the bucket I'mma be that motherfucker that
Make it look so hard these other suckers never wanna rap
Or make it look so easy
You know that it's meant to be
Welcome everybody to the 21st century

 
This isn't testimony
A lesson to the phony
Wait a second homie, I suggest you get to know me
I carry the crown, a new sheriff in town
Any beef that you found, I say we bury it now
From the streets not the sidewalk
A master of fly talk
It's not that you're wack, I'm just so cold that it's my fault
Responsible and comprable
Unstoppable dope shit
Abominable, phenomenal, you're not so you're hopeless
Penny with a hole in it
MC with his soul in it
And it shows when I compose the prose that has no limits
No gimmicks, just a straight up menace
Made a left off the Shaw and headed straight up Venice
I bang that Super-Cali-Frag-Alistic
Complicated composition
Killin' 'em with commentary
Crushin' all my competition
Ammunition for this war of attrition
You decide who the best I just made the decision

 
(Supreme)
I'm tryin' to win
(The pains all)
So go in
I'm an immature imbecile, niggas so far from sensible
A missile shoots out my mind and lethally injures you
And hoes blow a nig cause my stick is a Dippy Do
We act very (very)
Please scratch Perry
But fuck it
I'mma get drunk and eat black berry's
I can tell you're scared
Soft as wet Pinera bread and what?
Don't be so fearsome, this year I done
Busted they fuckin' eardrum
Your ear ring like ears pierced son
It's time to let the tears run
With knots swelling like water
I don't wanna hear your fears young
I'm posted up all over the globe and stay in distributors
Like where have I been
Off to myself like I'm so selfish
And all you niggas look like SNL skits
Don't shatter girl, just tackle girl (go long)
NFL in it
Cook for me, eat like a pig
And I go chill with my nigs
But we ain't chillin' we just buildin' to keep mad food in the fridge",https://genius.com/Murs-ups-and-downs-lyrics
4 The Record,F’Real,1997.0,"I rock the mic like it's my last chance to breathe
Display a level of skill you could only hope to achieve
Within this lifetime and I write rhymes that'll make marks
Shut the fuck up, when I recite mines, state syllables on snares
Like bombs, so I'm guaranteed to blow up
When I touch down on tracks, watch your whole crew collapse
Like households, that are introduced to crack, wack motherfuckers
Thinkin it's your time to shine, lackluster blockbuster b-boys
With ""Krush Groove"" and ""Beat Street""
Now they think it's safe to drop styles on beat
I make 'em all retreat, like back to back Halloweens
Destroy the following, believin rap's the sport for spectators
How the fuck you supposed to blow up? Living Legends got the detonator
For all these bitch-ass record haters
So-called entertainers, just rappers online
Nigga this Mid-City on mine, from the town where bangin is life
Fuck around, get yo' ass gangstered for the mic

For the record, there's too many niggas grabbin mics
For the record, none of 'em is comin this tight
Ay for the record, 4-27 did the track
Ay for the record, the Living Legends always got my back
Ay for the record, you want it? Go out and take that shit
And for the record, my crew had a show we ripped that shit
Ay for the record, whenever this shit drops
Ay for the record, just because you in the club you ain't hip-hop

I hit the spot, givin up that index finger and thumb
To let you know where I'm comin from
Living Legends bitch, don't act dumb
Cause some will wanna denounce the name
Some nerd-ass niggas, without an ounce of game
Tape sounds the same as the rest of 'em
Murs ends the careers, of the best of 'em
I mean this nigga starts battles in empty rooms
And after I consume my shadow
I'mma travel to your homestead, blow you out in front of your own hedge
First fly off the dome like led in gunfights
Fuck everything you done wit'cha whole life
After battlin me, you'll only remember this one night
Play it over and over again in your mind like Bill Murray
In a hurry to escape, but just to fuck wit'cha head
I put the shit to tape, not just for you
But for every MC, so you can peep where you at
And see, where you need to be
Proceed with me, through them underground catacombs
Where the Living Legends roam
Perfectin the techniques to speak, on phones type micro
Thinkin you, buildin a reputation, just perpetuatin the cycle
If all were fallin to the slang, fuck with me
Take a bite out ""Self Destruction"" like ""We're All in the Same Gang""
Y'all niggas can't hang

For the record you a bitch, we gon' treat you like a bitch
Ay for the record, pick a style, don't ever switch
And for the record, that whole tape you gave me was weak
And for the record, next time you see me, don't even speak
And for the record, it's always freestyle never written
And for the record...
Ay for the record, this is only the beginning
And for the record the Legendary saga, is never-ending

I'm from a crew of the most hated, underrated
MC's on the planet, yes I cram to understand it
And hopefully shed light
In a time when niggas is hopin on open mics
Instead of what they write
I compose prose to leave foes froze like Bobby Drake
Go below zero with the flow and never break
Ever make a man come to tears
After rippin his ass, in front of his peers?
That's the shit I live for, and that's why you live in fear
I'm the man known only as Murs
Makin you recognize and submit, after only one verse
Wake Up Show wouldn't play it, even without the curse
You gotta kiss they ass first; but I bet they stop
All that politickin after they get they ass kicked by Murs
My aim was never to play games, on some Parker Brothers shit
I've been on some dark and other shit, for a while now
The style now seems to be independent, and well connected
Fuck that, my family stay independent, and well respected
This shit's directed
To every nigga comin up short, when the cash gets collected
You can pick up this record
Wherever good music and true skill are still expected
Check it

Hey, hey Murs! Hey you remember me man
Hey you tore my ass in front of the club last week
Y'knahmsayin? Hey, hey check this out
You're the greatest, you're the dopest freestyler I've ever met
Hey can we do it again? Check it out let's battle let's do it man
My friends they didn't believe me
They didn't know about it, but I know you've got it
Hey Murs, hey, I I I I can't help but sayin it
You're so dope Murs!",https://genius.com/Murs-4-the-record-lyrics
Bummed Out Blues,Varsity Blues 2,2011.0,":
I'm bummed
Again, I always seem to find myself feeling like we're old friends
Ooooh
Now I'm numb
I've succumbed
To the ruder attitudes of bums
All the chaps who flap their little gums to get me bummed
:
What's up poor friend, it looks like it's me and you again
Sucking on this cigarette while I'm sipping on this Hen
It's been a minute since we kicked it
I admit it's not always the best conditions that I get a chance to kick it with ya
But here we are, sitting in my car
Down on our luck, looking up at the stars
The good times seem so far away
The last time I felt happy? Man, it's really hard to say
Listening to chumps got me down in the dumps
I'm guessing that what they want is to have me in a slump
Tried to get over the hump but couldn't carry the load
Fell flat on my face at the fork in the road
Under so much pressure it was easy to fold
All my funny style friends left me out in the cold
See I was told
That hard times travel fast
So it didn't take long for them to bite me in the ass
:
You shuffle with your left
Shuffle with your right
Shuffle with your left
Shuffle with your right
Shuffle with your left
Shuffle with your right
Shuffle with your left
Shuffle with your right
:
I'm bummed
Again, I always seem to find myself feeling like we're old friend
Ooooh
Now I'm numb
I've succumbed
To the ruder attitudes of bums
All the chaps who flap their little gums to get me bummed
:
I got my elbows on my knees
I'm in a deep freeze
Them ice cold blues got me lost out at sea
Trapped in my feelings now the floor is my ceiling
Locked in a spin cycle but my friends think I'm chilling
A spin doctor
I pop pills then vodka
Concoct a cocktail to get me through this soap opera
I'm on the top then my life's on the rocks
It's like it's my own cyclone, when will it stop?
Drop to my knees and I plead for the better days
Had lots of dreams but it seems I've been led astray
Dismay and doubt, which way is out?
Struggling with doubt as I scream and I shout for help
But it falls on deaf ears
It seems like the blues are getting all of my best years
Tears fall on hard times it don't make 'em soft
I twist up a two step hoping I can shuck 'em off
:
You shuffle with your left
Shuffle with your right
Shuffle with your left
Shuffle with your right
Shuffle with your left
Shuffle with your right
Shuffle with your left
Shuffle with your right

I got a story y'all from a bit ago
I was out in AZ chilling with my nigga Ro'
We're leaving Tucson, huh, we was rolling out
On the way to L.A. to kick it, we was zoning out
Couple jokey jokes, had the music up
A little smokey smoke, he was getting blue as fuck
And in the trunk, let's just say we had a little stuff
Back in the day, you know, times was kinda rough
Way back, I was nowhere near my 30s
Rap wasn't paying the bills, we was riding dirty
Two pounds of brown weed, straight from Nogales
We was riding slow, watching for the federales
And oh shit, how can I forget?
We had a half an ounce of shrooms in the car to split
I was smoking cigarettes and he was riding high
That's when the sheriff car came riding by
We wasn't speeding, he didn't have a reason
He still pulled us over, now I'm fearing for my freedom
And ""Oh shit! The shrooms! Hurry up and eat them""
He took half and I took half and threw the bag under the seat and uhm
""Hello officer, what will you be needing?
License, registration, I'm sure you wanna see em""
He said, ""Sir, we already know who you are
Mr. Carter could you please step on outta of the car?""
I did it thinking, ""What the fuck does he want""
""Mr. Carter could you please open up the trunk?""
I said ""Huh? Are you sure that's what you what?""
Alright I just got to get the keys from out the front
I went to Ronin, I gave him the sign like
""Nigga you know this weed ain't mine""
Besides I'm only 5'9, a buck 45
I go to the pen, there's no way that I survive
I went to the trunk and opened it up
And from the look on his face I could tell that we were fucked
Then Ronin jumped up, the cop said, ""Freeze!""
He said ""Officer, that is not his weed""
Then he started running full speed
Knocked the cop off his feet and grabbed the two piece
I stood for a second, thinking, ""Should I run with him?""
The cop stood up, I stuck my foot out and tripped him
He fell and hit his head on the edge of the trunk
Then he sunk to his knees and bled
He passed out, face covered in red
Ronin ran back screaming, ""Oh my God! Is he dead?""
And then he started crying, ""Sweet Jesus
Help me pull his body around the side so they can't see us""
No small feat, he wasn't a small guy
How he fit a pig in the trunk, hogtied
Threw the keys to Ro' and hop back in the Olds-
Mobile, turn the key and now we rolling down the hill
In a '67 Cutlass we was riding through the desert
Looking for a place to bury this new treasure
Now we certified killers, small-time drug traffickers
Won't be long till the helicopter's after us
We found a spot to dig us a ditch then
The chopper came out, and the shrooms kicked in
""Oh, yo, Ro', you feel that shit man?""",https://genius.com/Murs-67-cutlass-lyrics
Falling in Flames,Yumiko: Curse Of The Merch Girl,2012.0,"He pops bottles, pops pills, pops music, pop kills, paid the cost to get  it poppin till it got real

He always said that,""He would go to the top""
Now that he got the world watching hope he knows when to stop
Gave it all he had to give it
Pushed himself to the limit
Forgot about the music now its all about image
Never had much,so you gotta forgive him
As he indulges in this world of narcotics and women
Never thought about the finish he was focused on fame
But everybody loves a star when he's falling in flames

He never had one tat on his arm
Now he's got a full sleeve and a number one song
Fuck it
He's from 
One more sniff an hes gone
Now an days ain't no telling what type of shit that hes on


He'd been dreaming bout this moment since he got his deal
Sold his soul for some pussy and the hottest wheels
Now he yelling,talking bout he selling million sheets
He used to watch on t.v
Now all a sudden they be catching feelings
They say they feel him,say they wanna have his children
Now he frontin like he king
But he just got in the buildin
The lights and the life and the fame
Got thousands of groupies just screaming his name
This all he ever used to dream about won't last long
Cause they bout to let the demons out


He had a girl that was holding him down
But his stupid ass thought that she was holding him down
She said,""Heavy is the head that is holding the crown""
He ain't hearing her, he happy when the ho not around
I tried to holla like,""Homie slow down""
But hes no longer underground
So he don't know my ass now
And night after night after night after night
He fucks hoes,he does blow, he gets high as a kite
He knows that its wrong, but its feeling so right
Doesn't know that he's in for the fight of his life
Its almost time for the debt to be called in
They opened up the pit,hoping he'd fall in
He didn't fall, he jumped and went all in
Now he owes it all to the one that they call'em
And that's some serious debt
His girl Yumi tried to tell'em he ain't hearing her yet",https://genius.com/Murs-falling-in-flames-lyrics
Pusshhhhhh,Sweet Lord,2008.0,"At first no one believed that I could achieve
Goals I had set, hopes, dreams
Had no respect for my own team
So much pressure, felt like I couldn't breathe and
{*Chokes*} ...Relieved
When I shook all the doubts and decided to proceed
Best men, girlfriends, I don't need
Set my own pace, move at my own speed
Pushed on, did it by myself
No matter you say, ain't none of y'all helped
No matter what you think, I was standing on the brink
Gun in my hand, standing by the sink
Something inside wouldn't let me sink
Had a few drinks, saw a few shrinks
Been to the groups, I been on the meds
And this is for my people that's living on the edge

You gotta put both feet on the ground, then you push
Can't let life beat you down, you gotta push
Don't look back when you fall, you gotta push
Soon as your back hit the wall, you gotta push
You gotta push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah push it along

Move toward your blessings
Everything in life should be a forward progression
Don't stop, it's more than a session
Don't let obstacles become obsessions
Look beyond 'em, look past 'em
Look at 'em as something to do while time's passing
It keeps moving, like it or not
This life that you live's the only life that you got
Tomorrow's not promised, I can promise you that
Skip the fiction, get on with the facts
You live, you die, you laugh, you cry
No answers to the questions, quit asking why
Live the present, the past is the past
The future all depends on the moves you made last
And you should have no regrets
When the walls close in and life puts you to the test


I got God and the Devil got gone
The dark side is not that strong
Put it all in perspective, the prime directive
You must give respect to get respected
Treat others how you wish to be treated
You give what you get and the cycle is completed
They retreated, left my boy for dead
He held his head, kept positive instead
A hate, he pushed that love
Praying one day that we all blow up
So what? Different paths, different men
Hoping that we all get together, laugh in the end
Cause friends is friends and time will change
It takes a lot of strength to survive the game
Cause if you win, you win, it's all the same
We can't get lost in the lights and fame",https://genius.com/Murs-pusshhhhhh-lyrics
Morocco Mike,F’Real,1997.0,"Whussup Murs

Now heres this story about this fool I knew from back in the day His name was Mike, he used to kick raps around the way I used to see this nigga everyday up at the school I mean dude was cool type of fool who always said what he meant You could peep him at lunch Freestylin by the bench Now he lived in the hood some called the Danger Zone so he was no stranger to own ways of gettin a legal scratch But for some Strage reason he wasn't living like that We used to kick back smoke a sack Every now and then but usually he was in the house with his pen Writing raps that all the homies said was fat To match that he got he gots his beats From this nigga named Toan One day Mike said to Toan ""Lets hook up a demo man That shit could be on"" Or thats what they thought shit didn't pop Right away they got caught slippin And Mike really started trippin After a couple months he droped out of school Now we all day kickin it getting high Smokin blunts even quit his part time J.O.B Tooked the money that he saved Put that shit up on the P And now he's flippin zits Man you know the whole skit On how his ass gon quit After he's stacked enough chips But out the blue he got this call >From this A&R talking bout it's time to sign The first thing that runned threw Mikes mind Is that I won't have to grind So when he got the contract He didn't give it back ignored the print That was fine Flashed 50g's in his face And said ""All you have to do Is sign on the line to get it"" But Toan wasn't with it Thats when the group split But Mike didn't trip he knew he could get beats From the kids he was on the label with So he took the money did some normal rapper's shit bought his ass a new ride Tried to buy his moms a home But when she said I ain't gonna move up out the hood He paid off all her loans and hit the studio Every single day of the week And made the beat hella tight songs And after a couple a months The album was finished so he gave the masterd To the label so they could handle the bissness
aww fool I know who you talking about that was that nigga that nigga mike yeah that fools shit was tight fool he was blowin up fool what happend that nigga got dropped or what I dont know I ain't never seen that nigga in the hood no more
 (murs chuckles) This why you ain't seen that motherfucker in the hood fool
Now when the single dropped It really start to pop His shit hit the charts at the top You could see his video all day on The Box And when he hit the spot All the bitches would jock Same ones back in high school that didn't wanna speak Now they step into Mike tellin him he's a freak But he didn't get the big head And start to tweak he stayed down to earth And kicked it with his homies Every single day on the Turf So when the album released He thought his check might increase But he didn't see the loot Every time he called the label They gave him the same song and dance About his advance having to be recouped And on the day of his second video shoot They told he had been let go It seemed the president thought Rap artist wernt bringing in enough dough You know not enough capital So they dropped the whole Department of Black Music Now most of them artist didn't go on to do shit When back to 9 to 5's punchin clocks Acceptin weekly checks But Mike had a plan after a while He knew he was getting fuck By these record Exec's Now it was time to put the plan in effect Next day at the building he goes in Disguised as the dude from Fed X Takes the elevator all the way To the top floor no sooner then he steps Out the door the secutary askin ""Who the package is for"" He said ""Im here to see uh Mr.Goldstien"" She said ""Right now he can't be seen"" So he tryed t walk past her and ignore it Then she grabed his shirt like ""Nah I could sign for it"" So he gave her the clip board Then acted like he was pullin a pen Out of his uniform But a rag full of chloriform Then placed over her face The bitch was knocked out slid her fat ass Under the desk just incase no time to waste He went into the Big Man's office As soon as Goldstien seen Mike face He knew something was going on So he reached for the phone Just as Mike expected So he healed up the end of the cord To show him that that shit was dissconected He connected with a knife to his wind pipe Now he couldn't scream for his life He said none of this had to happend If you would've treated your artists right Trying to pimp my peoples art Never giving us a equal part But I was peepin your plan from the start It was never to see us be young black and rich Yal wanted to be the only muthafucker's Stacking chips that fool looked like he was honna have himself a heart attack and shit But Mike stepped back and stabbed him in the heart with the pen he signed his contract with, ain't that a bitch
I heard that fool moved to Moraco or some shit",https://genius.com/Murs-morocco-mike-lyrics
3:16 Pt. 2,Fornever,2010.0,"* bonus track

""Holding you""

It's Murs bitch. Big ups to 9th Wonder baby. All the way to 2010, once again
They brought you another one and it goes like this...

Murs, what up though? Still doin' my thang
Still not givin' a fuck, sold the game
In '04 showed you how to be a +Bad Man!+ on 3:16
And I showed you +The Pain+
Had to +Freak These Tales+ up with +Trevor An' Them+
And I +H.U.S.T.L.E.+ the same
+Walk Like A Man+, spit like an +Animal+
Cause I'm a +Dreamchaser+ and I'll do it again
Huh, it's such a pretty ass world
And I toured all over and met some Silly ass Girls
And this is for those that +Love & Appreciate+
I done gave up a lot of my old ways
I been sober, ain't been drunk in awhile
But I still won't hesitate to punch a punk in the mouth
The 9th Edition seemed hard to top
We got Revenge by goin' to the +Barbershop+
Change
It's funny how it comes around y'all
I'm still a maker of that underground raw
Shit
I ain't forgot that I'm a Legend
And I know where I come from and I know where I'm headed

This is 3:16 Part 2. Like, the first one was so big we had to make a second one
And this is it. Back and better than ever. It's now or Fornever
It's not over though. Murs, you got this?

Friends done came and went and me and 9th still here
Kill 'em with that sound that you like to hear
Ends, be gainin' them, you have a right to fear
These beats are threatening, we are quite sincere
The design of my flavor got me signed to a major
But now that that's over, it's time for the greatest
Haters, fans and bloggers
These are the greatest stanza's honest
Catch a nigga +Lookin' Fly+
I can make 'em dance to my shit
Toe touchin' on a stage, I can make those fans applaud it
Sweet Lord we done done it
But never in a day, from the soul to the stomach
The weather's feelin' great
We on the forth go round
Four albums in five years, this is how it goes down
Four albums in five years, how the fuck does that sound?
Forth album in five years, what they gon' do now?
Woooo!",https://genius.com/Murs-3-16-pt-2-lyrics
Def Cover,....The End of the Beginning,2003.0,"Creep with me while I crawl through the hood
Maniac lyricist, just call me Murs, that's good
You'll get crushed when I bust on beats
And you'll never hear me holla bullshit for the streets
I'm not anti-white, or anti-nigga, just anti-ignorant and anti-idiot
El-P make the beat and ain't I killin it?
Don't care who you are, if I ain't feelin it
I'm tellin your ass
Fuck you and these labels that be selling that trash
And these underground artists with their sales gone bad
Fuck with me I'll do it Sugafree
And send you to the corner just to get my cash
I'll whoop that ass
Put that on your momma
And get ready for the action cause I don't bring drama
I'm a tell the world you're wack
In every interview
Plus your squad's kinda pale
You need some color in your crew
Bought your first rap tape way back in '92
You had Slaughter, Warren, Slayer, and Firehouse
Thought this rap thing is cool, hey I might try it out
There's only do and do not
There is no try
It's in the Midichlorian for true Jedi
You was scared to come to shows cause they let the lead fly
Now you have no heart, no soul, no funk
And it's 187 on you underground punks

""Do you like it?""
""I can give a fuck how you feelin'""
""Feel this""
""Bitch feel this""

I was bumping Nocturnal when my mind started to travel
On how I used to seek out MCs for raps to unravel
Now you think I can't battle rap
Cause I roll a Cadillac
Put your money where your pie-hole is and watch me fuck you
Watch your cash like my name was Jason Biggs
I'm making kids wanna grow up to be astronauts again
Cause they see being an MC is not an option when
There's a hungry motherfucker like me lookin for fresh meat
To make 'em look foolish as hell over their best beat
I press heat to your ear like gauze to a wound
Hoping that it goes platinum like them Cosby cartoons
If I don't get a plaque on my wall from platinum release
I'll still be a classic to y'all with plaque on my teeth
Chain smoking, brain choking the shit outta rappers
I had to end your beginning to start the next chapter
Now I'm on some other shit like that  that common wears
Or the Enron affair or André's hair
Somebody else might, but I just don't care
What you say, or where your from
I'm the baddest motherfucker touching down on kick drums
Such a sick tongue, I should be an 
Have to wear this long beard to hide the IV
My goal since I was young: be a fly MC
So I jumped off the gym junior high PE
Fell flat on my face, everyone laughed at me
Now my flow's so strong gravity defies me
And I float on air without a pair of Nikes
So you just can't compare to flows rare like these",https://genius.com/Murs-def-cover-lyrics

""Give it to you 24-7 on the microphone"" - De La Soul 'Stakes Is High'
""All day, ev'day""

I would like to thank everybody to comin' out to my song
If you don't know the words than nod your head and tag along
It's just a journey through some thoughts, and feelings that I had
Vibe emanated, translated to a pad
Every song can't be mad so I'mma try to keep it light
Sorta like I keep my life
You know, stress free
Smoke some cigarettes, watch some TV
Or maybe it's a porn that I rent on DVD
I'm not tryin' to be nasty, I'm just bein' real
Monday nights I watch Raw and Ally McBeal
Hit up the Golden Apple, Allen hooks me with a deal
I read 
Grrl Scouts
, 
Transmetro,
 and 
Invisibles
Comics help me focus when it's time to get critical
No dames to call, cause my game's just pitiful
So I sit down to write at obscene times of night
And the session don't stop util I see the first light


You see I make the sound
Underground fans love
I'm not on SoundScan, but circulatin' dubs
Is where I get my love
(I know y'all burn my shit!)
Free copies for your homies
But it's all good
Cause the love that they show me is almost better than the money
Except when I'm hungry
But even then it's chill
Cause the girl behind the counter is hookin' up the free meal
Not because I'm MURS or my MC skills
But because I have a personality that appeals
It's called a mouthpiece
When I choose to spit
No ""40oz For Breakfast"" but I got the 
Gab Of Gift
If the situation needs it
(Not like PSC's is)
But pretty damn good
Somethin' you need growin' up in my hood
I done talked myself out of a few ass whoopin's
A couple busted eyes
A lot of busted lips
And before you start to trip
Yeah, I had my share of fights
But only when there was no other option in sight
You see, I'd rather rock the mic cause it promotes a healthy body and a much longer life


Now I let it go
Till the pen gets tired
And when it takes a break, I'm freestylin' rapid fire
""Can't Hear Nothin' But The Music""
Business always Personal
The way that I do it
Now when I came into it
I was tryin' to change shit
Cause this rap business y'all...
Oh my God (You just don't know)
Is on some strange shit
So when I hit these functions, I must remain lit
Sorta like a sedative
It's so damn repetitive
""Yo what's up man, what's up?!""
They ask me, ""Yo MURS is it fake?""
""Man, you bet it is.""
Phony handshakes and hugs
Phony man fakin' thug
But I don't participate, I just wait to yank the plug
Grind to a halt, throw 'em in a time vault
And send them Back II The Future
So I can get McFly in the present with the presence and a real tight producer
Mum's The Word everyone
Thank you, thank you",https://genius.com/Murs-all-day-lyrics

 {x2}
My prius is like a spaceship
Dashboard light up, push start, we lift off and then we take trips
""It's just a Prius though
On that L.A. tip
My dashboard light up like a spaceship""

This is my jet pack
My hover board
The only type of spaceship that I could afford
So futuristic, what I'm doing with it
Zero down, good credit, homie you can get it
I'm not for thee elite
Not the 1%
I rock over beats to overthrow the government
They rock two parties
I rock two thousand
Trying to get this lower class out of public housing
No key
Push to start
Mainstream or underground, yeah it's all ours
May not touch the charts
Trying to touch your heart
I see the bigger pictures so I gotta play my part
Out in Cali, your car is who you are
Me? I drive a spaceship cause I live amongst the stars
The only way to navigate the asphalt and tar
Public transport sucks
M.T.A. won't get you far


I'm an eco-friendly, fuck your barely fuel efficient, gangsta
Never costing more than forty bucks to fill my tank up
You see my space shuttle, shooting down the 'Shal
My Prius like a magnet snatching ratchets out they drawers
Pause for the cause at the Manchester Fat Burger
Chick tried to race me at the light, I had to serve her
Hit the power switch, usually it's eco mode
Less than 10 minutes and I'm already at Pico bro
Bust a U
Then I'm at the 10
Hit Vegas and I'm back, no gas in
But I'm gassing, silent assassin
Police on patrol but I roll right pass them
They see the Prius and they don't think ""black skin""
They thinking middle class, white anglo saxon
That's what's happening
A fucking space oddessy
You suckers stuck rapping in the trap never bother me

This where the peace starts and the thugging ends
Your car don't impress me unless you plug it in",https://genius.com/Murs-priu-lyrics
Writer’s Blues,Varsity Blues EP,2002.0,"Underboss, take a trip to where you can't see
And control the scenes with the puppet strings invisible
I seen dreams shattering the shars
Laid a trick that could part where the hearts are all edibals
I press hard, fall into the trap doors
Really wasn't asking for more than exceptance
In the presence of exception over collective human beings
Being talented is simply not enough, you gotta mean it
Since I want this, it feels like it chose me
I owe it to myself to keep pressing on (pressing on)
Stressing on the piddle why the riddle was constructed
Down the hustle like a '79
And you was dancin' up on good times (good times)
A pocket full of good rhymes
To help you through the hard moments of your life (your life)

It's just the way that I write (write)
After all whats most important if its something I like (I like)
It's just the way that we write (write)
After all whats most important if its something we like (we like)
It's just the way that we write (write)

After all whats most important if it's something you like (you like)
It's just the way that we write (write)
After all it's most important

Man I love hip hop some say I take it too serious
But rappers being fake always makes me so furious, mysteriously mad
They say I need a shrink but I think I'mma stick to my pen and my pad
My only therapist - my life and I'm sharing it with ya'll
Hoping they can stop you from tearing down them walls cos I'm going through it too
Expose it in our tracks and I'm showing it to you
So we can break it down and benefit, analyse the blemishes
Skip the cigarettes cos that nicoteens a stimulate
It don't calm you down
And alcohols a lion
At the bottom of the bottles where your problems always found
If I'm sober then I'm down in a slump, batting zero
Melencholy mother fucker not too happy or too cheerful
Sessions of depression got me stressing something awful
My family and friends and that smile said its soulful
But it really don't help, the enemies in the mirror
And I can't face myself, I pray for help
But these drugs ain't working, I just don't know shit
Thats the only thing thats certain
Feel like I'm about to die when my chest starts hurtin'
And I'm thinking that its hurtin'
Cause the Zanics they prescribe don't help control my vibe
I'mma live hip hop 'til the day that I die
Cause making good music's all that keeps me alive uh",https://genius.com/Murs-writers-blues-lyrics

Leave you enthrasted in the zone
Much to advanced to clone
Master of this urban rhyme science
Combined my legendary alliance
9th wonder of the world right after the giant
East Oakland California is where we conquer
The formula to leave compititions silent
See rarely pull that B in emcee
Thought i'd give it to u straight
At the one eight zero degree
And I should be the man
Receiving Platinum certificates
Cause this shit will get heard a million times
Rhymes so intricate heads will have to rewind
Sometimes I feel like quiting
Until I hear a nigga up there with a microphone
Bullshitin, I'm like that's koo shut the fuck up
If he knew where I was sitting
Got a dope Rhyme for everytime
A beady touch my lip, an been added to the text
For about five years so that makes
Eighteen thousand two hundred fifty
Dope rhymes just to hit your ear
Precise Calculations nigga master the equation
Cause mathematics and understanding
Rules supreme, so I suggest your ass
Get down with the winning team
And in it seems to be 9
Niggas know when to strike out like Doc Gutton
Once they've met with my mind
So wanting to reach and fuck up
My herbs run average, I'll turn one savage
Raise to let you know
I got a grip of microphones
You still at that Grabbing stage, to have it stage
Hard to kick, like bet money underneath my feet
Your shit hella weak, But so far from sticking me And these wack
Muthafuckers Don't mix
Like music to drive by and way to funky
So these nigga's get ate quick
Couple punk muthafuckers got me thinking Freestyle battles ain't shit

Its banks destroyed, its streets on fire
And even stone is not written in stone
The world is made of our desire
With open eyes, and a sense of mission
We'll realise our dream some day
A universal recognition
Of justice, healthcare, equal pay
And can you hear the world insisting
A single song in every throat
On a new international system
For which they'll never let us vote
The old world dies in sheets of flame
Its banks destroyed, its streets on fire
And even stone is not written in stone
The world is made of our desire!",https://genius.com/Murs-international-lyrics
The Intro (Sweet Lord),Sweet Lord,2008.0,"{*Intro imitating Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on ""Express Yourself"" by N.W.A.*}

Ay Murs

Yeah man, what up though?

Yo man we got these brothers out there
Scared and fakin and perpetratin but they scared to kick reality

Well man, you been doin all this dope producin
Why don't you show these brothers what time it is?

So what you want me to do?

I-I want you...

I want you to get your line right, that's what I want you to do

I-I want you to ha...
I want you to m...
I forgot man

See man, this is what I'm saying man
You can't never do NOTHING right when we do these records cuz!

Ay, you don't get enough of yelling at me man
Say brother, you gon' have to keep that down!

Man look man, we gotta do this record man so, so, what you gon' cuz?

I'mma rap man!

Rap about what?!

Oh God, Sweet Lord
{*Beat begins*}

Yeah, haha what up though?
It's Murs, 9th Wonder, Sweet Lord
Me amigos, my people, welcome y'all to the Hip Hop pizza party
The largest ice-cream social extravaganza in Hip Hop history
Hahahahaha... look

Praise him name, two kids in the game
Came back a third time to serve y'all 'gain
And it's sweeter than sugarcane, rough as a bullet stain
Good music and balance is what we bring to the game
So amen, let the fun begin
And before it all ends, you say we done it again
It's me and him, we come with that blend
That Cali-lina sound make you run to a friend
Like ""Say brother, you heard that Murs and 9th?""
The beats just bang and the verse is so tight
Ain't nothing like that been said on the mic
No drugs, no guns cause we just not the type
We get you ready for life, we get you ready for love
Cause it's all about moving, never holding a grudge
Forgive and forget, can't live with regret
Hoping God make a way before we run out of breath
Hit with all I got left, I'mma make it all right
Just spit that positive music and continue to fight
Bring the truth to the light, then the light to the dark
Until you sucker emcees meet us out in the park
We got that after school special that is guaranteed to test you
With morals to the story so you know we gonna bless you
You, you, and your girlfriend
Cause if this ain't a gem then the world don't spin
And if the world don't turn then the sun don't burn
Then the grass don't grow and the kids don't learn
So get smart, we got ninety-nine songs
But if we put 'em all on, I be rhyming too long
I hear you talking, I hear you fools
Cause we left Cool Edit and switched to Pro Tools
9th chopping breaks, me breaking rules
So daimn fresh, people say that it's cool
They say it's too short, they don't want it to end
But it wouldn't be perfect if it wasn't a ten
And friends, it's been a pleasure thus far
Murs and 9th Wonder and the third one's a charm",https://genius.com/Murs-the-intro-sweet-lord-lyrics
That’s On Me (A Tribute To 45 ACP - R.I.P.),Walk Like a Man Soundtrack,2005.0,"It's like nobody could fuck with us or no gang, ever
{*steel drum music blocks out intro*}

Now when Murs hit the stage, I'm guaranteed rockin teens
When I'm not doin that, I'm at the pad concoctin schemes
Based on my rhyme books, 4-5 drum machines
Your crew got a few tapes, and they tried to flood the scene
But that shit was too mild, I'm that pico de gallo
Still the nigga with no car walkin Pico with style
'Til my next big check, got my own crib
So the sex is no sweat, every girl I meet
I'm tryin to put on the set, straight beat up
Fuck some big-ass titties, give me a C-cup
And I'm a happy man, kinda cool on white girls
I mean at least have a tan, but then you never know
When there's a drink in my hand, coke and 1-5-1
Might sink where I stand, not too drunk to stand
I gotta think of my fans; one of the best live shows
In the whole rap industry is performed before us?
Not even my worst enemies'll face such tragedy
A legendary lord, defend my crown savagely
M-U-R-S, a.k.a. his majesty
Fuck this rap game and everybody tryin to battle me

And that's on me!  Niggas stay fuckin with my crew
Stand on the side watchin bitin everything we do
And that's on me!  Ain't nobody do it like this
Rock the mic around the world with no jewels on my wrist
And that's on me!  Niggas ain't playin in this bitch
Everybody wanna rap and they ain't sayin shit
And that's on me!  Niggas is fuckin up the game
Ain't nobody comin new, everybody sound the same

""My homey's way tighter than Murs,"" man I'll +SERVE+ that nigga
Make him regret the day, he heard the word +RAP+ nigga
I'm mid-town's finest
One verse so dope it's guaranteed to clear your sinus
Complete so deep in the spot Stevie Wonder could find us
A dope MC, minus all the hype
You a fan of whack shit then I'm probably not the type
A man on a mission
Underground now but once my band transitions
Take notes on how we do it, give a fuck who's catchin wreck
Since I'm the one who threw it y'all don't wanna get into it
A nigga too complete
I flipped a O on thirty-six and a whole new week
From the sto's to the streets you gon' have to hear my name
Every word's bein whispered
Give me one good chance, I'm snatchin all your listeners
A vet in this game it's too late for beginners
Living Legends reign supreme, takin out all beginners


And that's on me, and that's on me
What?  And that's on me, MC, bitch
On me boy, on me what?
On me, on me, on me, double L uhh",https://genius.com/Murs-thats-on-me-a-tribute-to-45-acp-rip-lyrics
Simple,Good Music,1999.0,"Contain rage on page engage in acts of lust
With the track in thrust back
The wack I crush and bust off a shot
Too intense to brush off
Continue to feel my presence as this track cuts off
An ongoin' scrimmage
With anger's mirror image
Much too graphic for the timid
Vivid depictions of me rippin' myself in half
Even I have felt the wrath
Of genius gone mad
On bad terms with my inner being
Seeing
I could be a little fresher
Force myself to study
Snatch the element of surprise from the dresser
Movin' on your fears, the aggressor
Can always stand to learn somethin'
Why sit around ignorant?
Mind state militant
Can quickly slip into belligerent acts of violent chats
Sittin' across the room mad doggin'
Simultaneously servin' you with silent raps
Time elapse
See the collapse of commerial rap songs
Perhaps I'm bein' too optimistic
But watch 'em make status quo
The well known misfit
Tremendous efforts
In attempts to heal the leper that we call society
Apply to me
Doesn't the phrase, ""Everything is gonna be alright""
Don't lie to me
I try to be righteous in the hopes that there just might be a heaven
But I felt like Kurt
Create your own Nirvana and become a Living Legend, givin' seconds to work
And an eternity to enjoy the perks
A work off dirt
These nuts so there's more obligation, proceed fun
Pass that pink pack
I need one badly
Had me
Combat this track
No rhythm to be found so adapt
Like reel to reel and ADAT
Kill the feel to lay back
Why sit around idle?
While niggas is fightin' in the middle of the street
While Roy Jones defends his title
Suicidal tendencies
So be sendin' me your money
Only fuck with the pink pack, the strawberries taste funny
Use to hate crummy MC's, but now I see
Who am I to judge the next man's rappin' ability
Long as he has some friends to buy his shit willingly
Aww, his shit is wack, it ain't appealing to me
Hell naw, I'm tryin' to tell y'all
Keep your opinions to yourself
You don't like the shit
Don't pick it up off the shelf
It's just that simple (It's just that simple)

Punk ass hip hop motherfuckers. Always talkin' shit
Down to criticize and crita-analyze and...
Man fuck all that shit you can suck my dick. All you wack ass niggas
When we see you in the club, what's up... Fuck y'all, suck my dick
Where the b-boys?
Said the b-boy, Talkin shit behind everybodies back...
Windmills and 1990's, flares, flipping on your head to suicides
Motherfuckers need to make good music and shut the fuck up
Uh-huh, Bitch. Elusive producin'. Elusive producin'. Elusive producin'
It's like that, do a freestyle, I wanna do a freestyle man, put me on...
In the house.... Ahhhahahaha...",https://genius.com/Murs-simple-lyrics
Final,Yumiko: Curse Of The Merch Girl,2012.0,"I did you wrong, I regret each day

The saying goes, ""You never know what you had
Till your well runs dry and you miss it so bad""
Not one for cliches
But on the replay
I did you wrong I regret each day
Can I make it up to you by makin' love to you?
You don't want my mistake to be what breaks us up do you?
Before you answer, just give yourself the chance to
Think about our past and how strong our romance was
Worse than cancer it's killin' me slowly
Never in my life have I been so lonely
And when I think about the pain that you must've felt
I swear to God I wanna kill myself
It won't change what happened, you probably still hate me
Never thought that you would be the one to forsake me
But now you gone, it's just the same old song
You never miss it, never miss it, never miss it till it's gone

My only wish is for you to completely forget me
She said she regrets the day that she met me
The only one to ever truly get me
I swear she took the life outta me when she left me
My only wish is for our love's resurrection
In your absence I appreciate perfection
I would sacrifice myself for your protection
And die for the chance to regain your affection

Look, it's kinda complicated when you lovin' a close friend
I feel like I treated her way better than most men
I admit
I cheated a few times
But I thought she'd do her dirt and I'd do mine
I really didn't care who the hell she was fuckin'
I tried to play it cool but she could tell that I was frontin'
Talk to my friends but they can't tell me nothin'
It hurts like hell when you're the cause of you're suffering
Take it like a man, bottle in my hand
Shot after shot until I can barely stand
And you don't understand, that's the only way I sleep
Should've known that these girls I bring home can't compete
I'm just not the man that I used to be
All of a sudden all these girls ain't as cute to me
I would murder all these groupie whores and burn them in effigy
If there was any home you could love what is left of me",https://genius.com/Murs-final-lyrics
County Blues,Varsity Blues EP,2002.0,"Hey mom..
They got me down at the substation
And this punk ass C.O right here is testing my patience
Naw mama don't cry, cause it's not that serious
I'm drunk and I'm tired and I'm a little bit delerious
But other than that, I'm gonna be O.K
It's just a misdemeanor running overnight stay
Anyway I had to call cause you're the only person I can count on
Not to ? to make sure I don't get caught up ? out the County Jail
Nah I don't need bail. I'll be out tomorrow morning
That's if when they run my name they don't come up with no warrants
Nah, ain't do nothing. But you know how they do
They could make something, if they really wanted to
So... What I need from you is to be at the Inglewood court about two
That's when the judge will hear my case
It'll really do me good to, you know, see your face
But since I don't have a whole lot of time to waste
Let me apologize for being a disgrace
Next for the stress and calling you so late
Please know this is a call that I never wished to make
I tried to avoid it
All throughtout my youth I did my dirt smart
That way I stayed aloof to the system and its prisons
Always made the right decisions
You know, weed not crack, Krylon not gats. It was that type of logic
That kept me out the trap, I could of just snapped
Like the rest that went crazy but that's not in my nature
And not how you raised me. I felt I owed you better
Than a couple Saturday visits, some jailhouse flicks and some poorly written letters
Plus we had a little cheddar that you worked so hard for
Why would I risk it all for just to act hardcore
That's why you won't believe why they threw in me in the car for
Not for drunk driving. Fighting or no drug sit
Mom they locked me in the jail cell for pissing in public

Mamma put your house up, So I can bounce up
Out this motherfucker, that's why I love ya
I love ya",https://genius.com/Murs-county-blues-lyrics
Belief’s Blues,Varsity Blues EP,2002.0,"Look, it's a simple thing
I don't play well with others so all I ask is that you leave me the fuck alone
Check it out

Why they just won't let me be
Why you and you and you just won't let me be

Look I ain't tryna battle rap
Can't fuck with none of that
I'm tryna have fun with rap
I mean I'm done with that, phase of my life
Now I'm tryin to raise this mic
And have the crowd shout back
And I really doubt that
Should violate ya zone
I wanna be left alone
So that I can sit at home, play a few games
Conduct some business on my phone
I'm a grown ass man
With a flow that stands up to any competiton
Ain't tryna be the best just give my own rendition of it
Love it? If not
Fuck it. Just leave it
I don't believe it's a crime
For you to simply be not feelin my rhymes
But please don't hate me or attempt to violate me
Let me tell you I try but even I can't escape me
I'm everywhere I go and I'm everywhere you go
So let's respect each other and get on with the show
So that we can get this dough
Yo
 {X2}

Look I'm walkin down the street and you ridin in a car
A plushed out lex so why you lookin at me hard
Man roll up ya window and mind ya own
Do I look like I gangbang?
I'm tryna go home
You step out that car and you might get ya ass beat
Oh wait you probably tough got (excuse me) a heat under your seat
It ain't like I ain't never seen a gun before
It ain't even like I never had to run before
But you don't really wanna kill me
You wanna act like a real G
But living out ya rap fantasies don't thrill me
But hey, whatever floats your boat
Go ahead and pull it out and I'll give you a quote like
""Awww big homie please give me your pass
But ain't it sad you need another man to kiss ya ass
But my manhood is secure so I'll bow and play the role
By the way ya light turned green like 30 seconds ago""
So
 {X2}

And now I got these white folks that be lookin at me funny
Lookin down on your boy cause they makin more money
Or at least they think they do
When we got lawyers and doctors that look the way I do
So don't act so astonished
Cause I hold a conversation without usin my ebonics
And don't twist up ya English soley for my benefit
Insulting your intelligence while lookin like an idiot
I'm so sick of this I shouldn't go through this no more
Follow me around your store is so early 90's
Can't touch the merchandise without you comin up behind me
Askin if I need assistance (can I help you sir?) like every other minute
When you need to be watchin them Winona-lookin bitches
It's the new millennium
We on our 4th pentium
But if I even raise my voice then the police men'll come (freeze!)
Cause you probably still mad denyin Jesus was black
And if you can't accept that then we shouldn't interact
So

Hey whussup this is muthafucking Murs
Here with muthafucking basik
You know what im sayin I got a foul ass mouth
But not really givin a fuck this is all freestlye
One tape do it like this no fakes
On the microphone distroy all snakes
In the grass Murs will beat that ass
If it has to come to that type of situation
But I really know that patience is a virtue
But I just might hurt you call it curtins
Pull up a skirt on a few emcees actin
Bitch wanna change off that switch
Like a light 25watt, you ain't that bright
Might get socked in the night
Where I'm from Mint City, where we roam
Come hard over drums
Everybody wants to hum
Some other niggas song, be on the dick
Of other crews too long now wheres your song
At got a whole tape but ain't nobody else
Gonna kick a rap unless they famous
Thats the fool from table of contents
Your whole porpose is aimless
Need to get some shit Condence it
Into one form have a common goal
When I'm bombing soul on this track
Everybody knows my spirt comes intact
Never um post hande or should I say
On strike like UPS I might just incave yo chest
Like this make a casium when I spit this shit
Have your chest doing spasum Fantasium
Like that four with the spikes
Everybody knows I dont sport nike's
Well I really kinda do cause I can't afford
Other shoe They cost to much
Everybody wanna rock the dutch
Or other should I say the British walking
Shit talkers from New York Get cooked
Burnt up, I stay way like pork
How many emcees have said that I've read that
Rap book you had all them rhymes you had
Was wack, Take it like that uh this nigga Murs With a freestyle verse
With basik
Your whole stlye is wack so face it
This nigga Murs with a freestlye verse
And basik your whole style is wack just face it
Can't Replace it

Can't replace,Can't replace it one on one
This is Basik Yo checking in one two
Watch out for your whole crew
We might do them by the two's
Three's and a hundreds I got you in a tundra
Freezing your toes Basik emcee expose
Superstition, I guess you thought you was Wishing you was in another
State
I negate no property, Basik emcee afully
All up in all these Emcees
Taking them off stage with a swift kick
You might sling from my dick
Matter of fact You's a trick
Sell you on the coner for two bucks a less
You be selling your rhymes
Like it was two bucks of stress
Just a little bit of style
And a little bit of this
And a little bit of spice here
And a little ingrediant there
Now ima come out then ima start to stare
Mad doggin wack emcees
Ima stomp em with girls clogs
And keeping them cloging up
Like arteries Fool's be swellin up
Thinking they gonna serve me
I think not
I'll put you in my pot
Everythings for 50degrees got it hot
Pull out about four emcees please
Watch me ease of all eww
All these punks never
I'm way to clever
Used to live down the street
]From this fool named Trevor
But he got a little shaddy
So I had to make him not my baby
Had to serve him
And send him on the curb
And send him on the street
And run him over with my Honda Accord
Never Bored
While I soared in the sky
Basik emcee will never die
Im living continuosly
Mater of I should say infinative
You wanna live up dont step up
You might limp back
Watch for the attack
]From me and Murs you've gotta stay dope
If you don't wanna be wack
Thats obvious
Matter of fact Im seein this
Threw the scope of my eyes
Matter of fact I got three of them
Matter of fact I got five of them
Cause im counting my glasses
Kicking many asses
All through Like going slow like malasis
If you want me to slow down the style
Leave a wack emcee
Thinking ima gon get wild
Now wait little child
You might get smacked
You need a pasifire
You a wack emcee you was a lyre
Talkin about you was 10 leauges higher
But 10 leauges lower in the sea
Wanna be me
I bet you wanna clone
You drone
I'm like the bully of the block
Ima take yo twinkies out your lunch box
Then take your money
And put it in my socks
And then walk down the street
With this damn beat
That shit is thumpin
Keep bumpin in the bay area
With my man Murs
Wanna kick a freestyle verse

On Your Own,Yumiko: Curse Of The Merch Girl,2012.0,"Now who the gods wish to kill, they first make crazy
That's why it always seen like they fuckin' with you baby
No delusions, ignore the illusions
Lead with your heart and avoid the confusion
Them obstacles just don't exist
When you're livin' with a love that's as pure as this
It all changed when she hit the sticks
Sorta like when all the demons escaped from the pit
It gets deep
The torment creeps
She's torn between the worlds of the awake and asleep
But peep game there's no one to blame
We're all just pawns, a face with no name
I admit, it's a shame how it went down
So strange, the path she was sent down
But have faith it'll all work out
Even though you're not traveling the perfect route
 {X2}
And you wonder what they want from you
Why won't they leave you alone?
Beware cause the path is shown
Make one wrong move and you're on your own

And home girl they just tryin' to tell you
About all the bullshit that life can sell you
You trusted in a man and of course it fell through
Now you one step from a cell in Belleview
Cause they can't see what you see
And your friends ain't always who you want them to be
Listen close and make wise choices
Sometimes angels disguise they voices
And the demons gone ??
Frames and facades that'll leave you enraptured
They tryin' to capture your soul
Well hold on, don't lose control
The goal never greater than the sum of your journey
Be easy, enjoy what you're learnin'
Embrace this brand new world
And who knows, we might just save you girl


And when your friends true colors do start to shine through
Don't let their faults define you
Trust you and no one else
You can only trust others to be themselves
All power ain't good and all magic ain't bad
Now you trapped in the illest dream you ever had
Half of what you see and none of what you hear
Open up your heart now the truth is clear",https://genius.com/Murs-on-your-own-lyrics
Like What,MURS Rules the World,2000.0,"I say good God, grab the mic and get loose
Showin' just a little energy to get the crowd juiced
The music that we produce, not your everyday stuff
It's the songs that make it smooth when the road gets rough
Make you forget how to act when it's too laid back
Not just myself it's for the fans that I rhyme on these tracks
And never could I come wack, my support would be crushed
I gotta stop and make 'em feel their adreneline rush
Don't need no video crutch, stand straight when I bust
And if you can't do the same then I suggest that you hush
Say we doin' too much, they just outta touch
We take the stage and keep it jumpin' like a game of Double Dutch
Or should I say hopscotch? 'Cause we go the whole nine
Don't gotta be complex for you to have a good time
Just elementary rhyme and a real dope beat
I want em dancin' when they hear this and a lot of empty seats
Don't just sit around, you know you wanna get down
Grab the finest girl in reach and ask her how this sound
One drink and a dance, don't think it's your chance?
How you makin' progress while you're scared to advance?
Follow through with your plans and of course be a man
Forget the pimpin' and the playin' and remember romance
I know it might sound weird, the term's been dead for years
But you only play yourself trying to impress your peers
I know it might sound weird, the term's been dead for years
But you only play yourself trying to impress your peers

You are too kind, thank you haha, yeah thank you, th-thanks a lot
Yeah man, thanks for hanging with us so long
It's your host Murs Inatra and
You know once again we up here in Winnie the Pooh studios
It's a beautiful day in North Carolina
Slight chill, wind five degrees
I don't know if the wind's... I don't know what the hell that means but it is
And you know it's been three albums and
We ain't never really just sat back and talked down to you
I done told you all kinds of stories, y'all know everything about my life
Y'all probably done read everything on the Internet about 9th
You know what computer we use and... hell, and me I'm just like

Man I've been so miserable, crib un-livable
Driving round my city feeling so pitiful
Smog getting to me, traffic got me stressed
My little mama say I'm basically a hot mess
Tryna make some bright days out of dark nights
Kool locked up, I know I gotta write
Money on these books, shoot a quick kype
Telling myself it's gon' be alright
Finally bought pops a headstone this year
Ten years his grave said unmarked, clear
Wasn't always the best dude to be around
Miss him much more now he laying in the ground
Wish he was around to ask him for advice
Wonder what he'd say about the women in my life?
But nah, cause he couldn't get it right
And he never did get to see me rock it on the mic
If your father's still living, I beg you to forgive him
Cause he's just another man who has lost his religion and
And me, I'm tryna find mine
The man in black been walking that line
Between faithful and infidelity
She on MySpace and she telling me
She wanna come to the crib and do what?
Nineteen, dark skin with a big old butt
Maaan, that Internet is a monster
Excuse my flow, it's my stream of conscious
I keep veering off of topics
This just because y'all my favourite people to talk with

You know? I mean I'm sorry to tell all my businessmen
On the real, a nigga got a cold right now man
9th got a cold, we been recording with these kids in the house everyday man
They so beautiful, they so damn bad
Terrence spilling Cheerios all over the floor
This the last song on the album that we actually recording and
I'm on my way to the airport, my little brother finally graduating
After seven and a half years but I don't give a...
I'm so proud man I can't even begin to attempt to pretend
Like I can't explain to you the joy that I'm feeling of getting on this plane
Bout to take some Airbornes, some {?} and do it real grande
But yeah man, live from, from the Winnie the Pooh studios
It's Murs and 9th Wonder, I know y'all tired of saying that
It's Murs and 9th Wonder, I say it all the time
It's Murs and 9th Wonder, that's my motherfreaking friend

The Deepest Blues,Varsity Blues EP,2002.0,"I don't know about you, but first thing I wake up every morning
Look in the mirror say to myself is...
I am going to die
And I've come to terms with that
But the when, where, and how's where the concern is at
It's fucked up that I'll be dead when I've learned all of that
Fact is we mustn't fear it
For fear is the mind killer
Elijah wanted to die and there ain't nothing iller
There's life and there's death
All else is just filler
So that situation you millin' that got you hella stressed
Trust it won't mean shit once you take your last breath
Kick the bucket by the farm
Eternal version of forget
To set the alarm
The deepest sleeper sleeps
I'm talking six feet deep
That final appointment
That we all have to keep
You know that knick knack cancels all the rest of your plans
In an over-priced box of carpet
Rock rocking that eternal b-boy stance
Your family and friends come to tears at first glance
Regret that they never said what they had to say
When they all had the chance
Hands down the worst shit
That could possibly happen
There ain't nothing like death
To straight fuck up your day
But ain't nothin' like living to make that feeling go away
So go ahead and play
For when the head coach calls a time out
You're permanently benched
It's too late to sulk about how your time was spent
Break up's a bad credit
It's all temporary
Be sure to make some memories for all your friends to carry
So when your soul slips through your retina
You sleep on a stretcher
You can rest in peace and know the world won't forget ya
And I'll catch you on the other side
We riders of the sea
Who know the world must go on without you and me",https://genius.com/Murs-the-deepest-blues-lyrics
Way Tight,MURS Rules the World,2000.0,"Now when I'm not makin' death threats
To Judge Judy
I'm at the crib, Guinness and ? of thug beauty
Or maybe it's the club out tryin' to hug cuties
A true MC
I definitely love groupies
If I had 'em, I'd get at 'em
And I mean with a swiftness
I need a housemaid that's paid
Best friend/mistress
And as for that wish list
Out of a couple of them bitches
Some old 32-24-36's
And if that's too vicious
I'd probably have to settle
For one dame that's Solid as Gear is to Metal
Not a brainiac, but definitely on my level
Someone to ride with me, like bass is to treble
Like me and this mic, like Lee is to Spike
Let me free for the night
If I'm keyed it's alright
Cause she'll see my delight
And she don't need me to fight
Cause if she is my wife...
 
She's waaaay tight
The type of dames that I like
Way thick, way bad, way fine, way nice
Waaaay tight
Is what I be on this mic
Way sick, way raw, way fresh, way hype

Now you can catch me on the net listenin' to some shit
On MP3, download from PC, then it's straight to MD
See that's how I wreck y'all
Tech-nol-ogy
In the game respect me
The same way you do your elders
And everything I put out
I guarantee a best seller
Even if it goes copper
I know my shit is purchased by the true hip hoppers
What's up to Boof and Topper
My booty call numbers, not used before twelve
I dial eight like Rakka
See pussy's always best, after sundown
Like a Mike Tyson fight, I'm through after one round
Alright two or three
But sex in the morning?
Oh fo' sure not with me
Soon as I wake up, I'm tryin' to start my day
A hug then a kiss then I send you on your (echo)
Then I send you on your...


Way sick, way raw, way tight, way dope
Can anybody in the world do it like this? Nope
Way strange, way off, way warped, way out
I'm on some other shit
Fuck what y'all talkin' about
Way in, way cool, way fresh, way hip
And anybody thinkin' different, tell 'em suck yo dick
Way drunk, way gone, way throwed, way stuck
And if I happen to offend you, you know I don't give a fuck
Way mean, way foul, way raw, way real
And if I say it and it's true
Does it matter how you feel?
Wastin' a little time cause there's nothing else to say
Way way
And I'mma end it this way (echo)",https://genius.com/Murs-way-tight-lyrics
The Jerry Maguire Song,F’Real,1997,"Ay it's like, me and this nigga Eclipse
Been workin on this shit hella hard for hella days
Y'know, knahmsayin? Been since like
'95, both graduated and shit
Shit changed a grip for me this year
'95 was some shit, check it out
It was '95, the year of my graduation
I was in, great anticipation of my date of release
From this educational prison, moms made the decision
To throw me from the residence
It seems weed and hip-hop had taken precedence
Over my responsibilities, but it was alright
Because that day to day bullshit was killin me
So willingly I left the home
And set out on my own, shacked up with some crew Saga and Rhythm
Didn't have to give 'em any rent
So hella time was spent up late night, freestylin gettin high
Not knowin how I would make it to school the next day
From the Westside of L.A., I had to hit the 33
And now I hear them fools from Red Dots is out to murder me
So certainly stresss built
Takin bus to night school every day, coulda got my ass kilt
But I had to get my credits straight
Plus the bus ride gave me time to meditate
On how to set this shit straight
So late one night, I called up moms then we reached an agreement
Which only delayed, it didn't prevent what was bound to happen
She said she wasn't trippin just as long as I got a gown and cap
Then came graduation day, the only nigga to walk the stage
With a zero point five four five GPA
I hand her the diploma, and she still have shit to say
And it's fuckin off my vibe, and the album's on its way
I couldn't prolong the day when Murs
And the real world would collide
The year was nine-five

The year was nine-five, I thought I wouldn't survive
Livin in the city where it's a day to day struggle to survive
The year was nine-five
{""Daily survival tactics in L.A."" - 5X}

I struggled my way in the summer and now the album's almost done
But now is when the crew starts to fall apart
One by one, we disassembled, which sorta resembles my life
Fallin apart, right before my eyes
So I fantasized about havin a video, and bein on tour
To keep my mind off my empty stomach, and sleepin on the floor
Bein that I'm broke, I'm stealin groceries from the store
And now it seems every battle I have turns to beef
And me, broke with no heat
I'm lookin over both shoulders whenever I hit the streets
And just when I thought I escaped defeat
I'm sittin with my homey and we smokin a beadie
When this cop see me, and he decides to procede
A young black male with dreads, it gotta be weed
So he comes over with the usual, disrespect
But that's all I've come to expect
From a motherfucker with a badge and a God Complex
Next he's askin questions, testin my patience
Finds out I'm underage, now he's writin a citation
Askin me to stand up to be frisked, I'm like ""Man fuck this!""
Then this bitch cop snatched me up from the back
I turned around, to counter the attack
But I'm surrounded by five cops who don't appreciate the reply
So it's me they hogtie, and throw on the asphault
Steady talkin shit, standin over me like it's all my fault
And now I got a court case to face
And in the first place, I barely got enoughs to survive
So when the court date arrived
I damn sure don't got enough for a fuckin bus ride
So they give me a warrant, failure to appear
The next week I'm at the pier with my crew
I seen this fool I battled a couple days back
Hadn't seen him in a few, I stepped to him
He's like, ""Dude we need a rematch, you see my ego's been scratched""
And when I tell him that shit ain't gon' happen
His ese partner went and opened up his trap
And tell me that the odds was uneven instead of leavin
I turned around and put this motherfucker in his place
And at the same time, his homey all up in my nigga T.S. face
So I'm think we 'bout to squab; but then the cops mob
And break it up, now they feelin like, they did they job
But here they come, back up the street hella deep
Talkin shit like we wasn't gon' trip
So I took the first hit
And now we squabbin in the middle of the streets
The odds was 3-on-6, and we still held it down
Except for the one so-called homey
Who stood there, held the radio and looked around
And it seems like forever that we fought
But it eventually, came to a halt
So then we hit the park, to discuss what happened
I wake up the next day, these fools is talkin 'bout cappin me?
Takin my life, over a fight, nah that couldn't be right
Lost sight of where I'm livin, Los Angeles
Where fools ain't givin a fuck, stuck in the same place
With decisions to make
Either I kill them, they kill me, or I make an escape
So I took the money that my step-pops left me when he passed away
And moved up to the Bay, only to find out
Niggas gon' have problems, wherever you stay
And it's been a couple of years
And some of these fools is still trippin to this day
So I feel I can safely say
That on this planet there ain't no place like L.A
(There ain't no place like L.A.)
Mid-City fool, bitch!

Trap Luv,$hut Your Trap,2014.0,"She said space is what she needed from me
That got me started thinking that she didn’t really want me
Didn’t mean to smother her, I was just in love with her
Deep down inside I knew I’d never find another her
Someone that’s special, how could you let em leave you
My ex tried to text me, I said she’d never be you
You, so perfect in your own way
How could I possibly be loving you the wrong way
I wanted all of you, so I gave you all of me
Made the mistake of thinking quality was quantity
You stopped calling me, I tried not to notice
You shitted down on me, but honestly I’m hopeless
Dopest girl I ever had, I should have played it cool
Got me sitting, wishing there was something I could say to you
Cause I get it now, how you couldn’t breathe
And I could change, I’m just wishing that you didn’t leave

If you love me
Let me go so I can earn your trust
But if you can’t let me go
There is no “us” cause I feel trapped here
Inside of this 

I’ve been hurt before, so it’s hard to trust
I know you saying yeah, what that got to do with us
Everything, and nothing at all
I know it’s not a good look to catch me going through your calls
Immaturity, insecurity, heart broke once, now there ain’t no curing me
The paranoid lover, going undercover
Popping up at your spot, tryna catch you with another
I’ll probably never change, but if you can’t hang
Then you can leave, and Imma have to let you do your thing
Or you can work with me, I know I’m worth it
You think I’m jealous but that’s only on the surface
Would you rather be loved too much
Or messing with some dude who doesn’t even give a fuck
Stuck my neck out, tryna learn to love again
So if you leave, forget about me, I don’t need another friend


Inside of this 
Do you love me
Do you care for me
Do you feel for me
The way I feel for you",https://genius.com/Murs-trap-luv-lyrics
Mr. M,Yumiko: Curse Of The Merch Girl,2012.0,"The legend says that his name brings fame
To any soul willing to pay the price of the game
Risk so much to gain so little
The devil always plays both fins against the fiddle
He's been around for years, deceiving, receiving
As soon as you think you're getting even, he's leaving
Greed and lust are the tools that he uses
Manipulating men in any way that he chooses
The law of run, is no fun
They only teach the shortcut where he comes from
You cash out quick and hopefully leave a cute corpse
No consequence to a life cut short
Life after death, it belongs to him
The end is never sweet and what you reap is grim
They say you can't cheat death and you can't cheat him
The end is never sweet when the reaper's in

We live fast, we die young
We buy coke, and tote guns
Why walk, when you can run
Since we all gotta die then why not have fun
We live fast, we die young
We buy coke, and tote guns
Why walk, when you can run
(Run, run, run, run)

The cars, the cash, the chicks, the weed
Name anything you want and he's got what you need
The ""M"" is for materialistic, he brings mass amounts of money to the misfits
Mortal men trying to match his greed
But they wind up dead because they don't take heed
He misleads them, he misguides them
His passion is power and it won't be denied him
He was in love once, if you could call it that
Took what he wanted and he never did call her back
But then again he was fucking with the goddess
Hell hath fury but a fire burns the hottest
A goddess, scorned, vengeance now born
Beware of her wrath the wise men once warned
Mortals play pawn while the gods keep score
They says alls fair when true love is at war

We live fast, we die young
We buy coke, and tote guns
Why walk, when you can run
Since we all gotta die then why not have fun
We live fast, we die young
We buy coke, and tote guns
Why walk, when you can run

Risky Business (snippet),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(feat. Shock G and Humpty Hump)
(MURS)
See, had the place to myself, my parents went outta town
So I had the music up and was runnin' around
Singing to the beat of my favorite underground
Song at the time, let's just say it was MURS
I was rappin' in the mirror, I was knowin' every verse
I was doin' my thang until the doorbell rang
It was my homeboy Shock, a mellow type of fellow
That I knew from up the block, he walked in and said:
(Shock G)
Yo, what's the deal MURS? First things first, you couldn'ta hit me
At a better time, them four cars behind me, they with me
All women, all dimes, the redhead she's mine
She wanna hump me, yo that's my brother Humpty
(Humpty Hump)
What's up yo? Pardon me, but I gots to go, where the bathroom at?
Y'all got liquor? Come on, Trina! Yo this house is fat
'Ey cat, you wanna hit this? Oops I shouldn'ta did that
I'll clean it up before your folks come home, yo where they at?
(MURS)
Man I don't believe you brought this nigga man I heard about his ass
The only fool dumb enough to flunk his P.E. Class
It's not that he's dumb, he's just wild and he's ignorant
Known for gettin' mad drunk and gettin' all belligerent
Man I'm sick of this I shouldn'ta told nobody
I mean three's company, but four cars makes a party
Mental note: lock the garage, hide the keys to dad's Rolls
'Cause it's outta control, this bitch is taking off her clothes
(Shock G)
Is your dad's Rolls blue? 'Cause I got bad news
Humpty took a cruise, and barbeque pit went in the pool
Turned the water grey, I would stay and help you clean up
But the neighbors say police are comin', I'm bout to G up
(Humpty Hump)
Beep, beep, beep! Yo, I'm back MURS, where should I park it?
I brought the whole strip club with me, we bout to spark it
My girl urled in your backseat, but yo it's cool
We got weed and some shrooms, is it cool to use your dad's room?
(Chorus 2X)
It's risky business, man what is this?
I'm caught up in a twist, and I'm tryin' to fix shit
It's risky business, man what is this?
I'm caught up in a twist, now I'm tryin' to fix it
(MURS)
What you mean my dad's room? Nigga is you crazy?
And what's up with them glasses, what'cha eye kinda lazy?
Anyways we gotta clean that shit up out the backseat
But first what's up with that blonde, you think she
Likes black meat?
(Shock G)
She said she was a virgin to the brown, never splurged in the town
But she's down, 'cause you got her all moist, like the Rolls Royce backseat
'Least I can do is help you clean it up cousin
What time is mom and dad comin'?
(Humpty Hump)
Yo, why y'all bein' responsible and shit? We gotta hook up
We tryin' to get these chicks upstairs, see what we can cook up
One of them got their toes blue, coochie shaved, so cool
My nose tryin' to be with those when the doors close fool
(MURS)
Exactly. Fuck the backseat I'm tryin' to smack cheeks
Until they turn reddish, and satisfy my fetish
Lay back and get some lettuce (Humpty: Yo, what'chu mean, head?) (Yeah)
That's what I said, then call it a wrap (Shock: But what about your parents?)
Well, they never called me back, I guess their flight got delayed
So we got time to get layed, ayo Hump could you watch out for that white Escalade?
(Humpty: Did you even have to ask?) Well since you're on the task
I'ma head upstairs and get focused on some ass
And if I start to scream, do your best to ignore me
If my parents come in, just tell them the Burger King story
Just keep 'em entertained until I finish gettin' brained
(Humpty: Hello Ms. Connor, he's gettin' drained) And the name is Elaine

Me personally
I just start, just started driving
Congratulations
Thank you very much
This song is just like
For them days you just cruisin', kickin' it with your boys
Clowin', whatever
Crenshaw, whatever your little street is or whatever
It's like this

It's like you sippin' bourbon slow
Swervin' low in your seat, nowhere to go
Windows low because the heat, ho, what you know?
There go your folks right up the street, you slow your roll
They all hop in, y'all go and eat, you shoot the breeze
On how the homie just got clowned by some B's
He spit his game, they shot him down and with ease
And now he's makin' up excuses, nigga please
This happens every time we out, now close your mouth
Always lyin' on some shit, what's that about?
We your boys, and we got love no matter what
Now put your seat belt on, sit back and shut up!
Oh, turn that up that shit is knockin', that's my cut
Two 15's up in the trunk, we ain't no punks
Heard us comin' blocks away playin' slump
Thought it was an earthquake your heart sunk
Look here's some niggas in a Cutlass, what a punk
Throwin' up some gang signs, I just ignore it
And when the light turns green, I simply floor it (See ya)
Left them suckers at the light feelin' dumb
Fightin' over fingers and thumbs, I ain't the one
Call me a buster or a mark if you choose it

M-3 (Anger),F’Real,1997.0,"Okay since you paid for the meal, I'm gonna throw in my tip
But normally, I wouldn't do this

Never mind what your normally do, someone shoulda warned you
But then again, my style - too sick to predict
Kinda like that ""Emergency Broadcast"" shit, before the earthquake hit
But this is a test to see how long you'll shut the fuck up and listen
To the statement of my mission (you sit quiet)
Now that I got your attention
There's no-thing I think I would never say
From one of the dopest crews out the Bay
So what's that I heard you say?
Fool when I call your name you'll know it
Always been a man before a poet
So I never been in the habit of backstabbin
Only got 3 problems, beadies alcohol and mic grabbin
So if I smile in your face
Know that if I wanted it I would take yo' place
Once again the G the way the only way I know how
Only got one question after I rock your set
Who the fuck wanna flow now?!

No matter how you try you ain't fuckin with me
By just breathin air I diss sucker MC's
And no matter how you try you ain't fuckin with us
Cause if you about fresh shit, then you stuck with us
No matter how you try you ain't fuckin with me
By just breathin air I diss sucker MC's
And no matter what you make, you ain't fuckin with us
Cause when you eliminate the fake, then you stuck with us

Oh you heard you could rap, but from what I hear
You would get served and slapped by any one of my crew members
Do you remember who wrote the book, on this underground way of livin?
We do more than you do with a whole day after midnight
Deliver dope shit for the love like midwifes
Doin what the fuck I want now to avoid that crisis at mid-life
Mid-City life creates a doper MC; when yo' record's in the crate
Next to my shit, you still ain't comin close to me
Better than you'll ever hope to be, shoppin yo' demo at 33
Instead of bein the man you supposed to be
Musta lost yo' mind tryin to find that easy money
And the college MC's? Oh these niggas funny!
When you was studyin for yo' SAT, I was out bein a fresh MC
So why you tryin to run up on me?
Don't you know my crew smack toys
What the fuck it look like, me a hip-hop scholar
Up against a frat boy?


Bein the creator of a style all mine, I stall online rappers out
It's not they fault, they don't know what the culture's all about
This don't go out to everybody in the chatroom
Just those who assume that hip-hop, is an indoor sport
Got them new chains but scared to walk on the court (bitch)
While you were goin over hip-hop's new, line of clothes
I was combinin flows to clothesline hoes from across the ring
Like Dr. Death Steve Williams I'm tellin you, I kill 'em
And if my style is too raw to be felt
Then fuck it that's just the hand that I'm dealt
And I'mma deal with it, I said throw down with me boy
And on my tombstone engrave a microphone cause that's what I live by
Give my a hundred and ten percent, fuck a lockerroom speech
More than half the time, I'm already been amped

Sometimes the same thing like when I wanna get drunk and I need to be keyed
Free my mind
With my body in tow

Indeed
Now the only time I follow is when the music takes the lead
Been G'd
Up
Spit some shit to say

Up and down like the Richter when I'm writin' to a beat

Lay back and focus on the tone
Forget about the troubles and the worries that you own
You are now in the zone
Lay back and focus on the tone
Reflect on the past and the blessings that you own

I have thoughts
On how to make a change
Try to express them over beats
Proper speech mixed with slang
Then brought
To the point of no return
Ain't no time for lookin' backwards, there's a future to be earned
Been taught
To never half do my shit
So I forever give my all until my physical calls it quits
Been caught
Tellin' friends I give up
Drunk myself into depression, screamin', ""I don't give a fuck.""
Then shots
Were fired in my direction
Definitely helped me realize that my life is blessing
Say I ought
To keep my head out of the clouds
But I stay chasin' dreams with my head held proud
Once sought
The answers to existence
Won't know for sure until I'm gone
So I'm on another mission
Might rot
In my grave unfulfilled

Would only draw my ass crazy

All them times
You were in the middle of the floor dancing
Then had to duck
Because some stupid muthafuckers
Decided it was time
To shoot the party up

With all them wack nights you've had
But remember it can always worse
When you think it's all bad

Got me tryin to put my piss through brick walls
Wish I was that bitch
From out of this world

This has been, ""F'Real""
That shit
This is the last shit, the end motherfucker
It's all over it's done
Ay!
What I wanted to say
Well shit, I'mma specify, my stance on hip-hop
All you motherfuckers, from outside lookin in
Sayin this is hip-hop
And this is not hip-hop
Motherfucker hip-hop is what's bein bumped in the ghetto
So if they bumpin Puffy in the ghetto
Who the FUCK is you to say that's not hip-hop?
Whatever's bein heard there, where it started
Is what hip-hop is
Stop tryin to define somethin you don't know shit about
And I'm out...",https://genius.com/Murs-the-sermon-lyrics
Peache$,$hut Your Trap,2014.0,"I want to send this one out real quick to the motherfuckers that always think it’s them
Oh it’s them
But if it’s always them, then it’s probably you
Motherfucker

They hopped up in the car, destination ATL
She was going down to dance, him he had some weight to sell
They’d been best friends almost 20 years
They made a pact to get the fuck up out of here
It was zero hope, it was so much pain
He did some shady shit, got ran up out the dope game
She the type to fuck her best friend, man with no shame
They off to reinvent themselves where no one knew their name
First stop was Vegas, so he could move a little work
Then they hit the 40 east, smoking good, blowing purp
Took turns driving, tried to make it straight through
Until they got pulled over by the state troop
Lucky she was driving, she got to plead her case
Undid her blouse, threw some cleavage in his face
She giggled, he gave a couple corny pickup lines
Of course he let her go with just a warning this time
That night, they arrived in the ATL
Headed straight to College Park, checked into a motel
47 bucks a night, they had enough for two weeks
Took a shower, went to eat, now it was time to hit the streets

You, you can’t run away from you
You are who you are no matter where the fuck you move
You can’t hide from the truth, and you can’t run from it
Eventually my nigga you gon have to face what’s coming
Bring the same bullshit to a brand new day
And get the same kind of fun in a brand new way
They say that life ain’t fair, but it’s really rather simple
It won’t be there when you get there if you don’t take it with you

Dropped her off at Goosebumps, off of 
Then he took the 85 to his homie’s weed spot
Mission was to help his homie make the transition
From green to that white, he had the keys to the ignition
Dope up in the door panel, he hopped up in the kitchen
And in less than a week, he was working, he was whipping
But you don’t open up a dope spot without permission
Now the local niggas tripping and they coming for commission
They pulled up in a new drop, bumping that Guwop
Parked at his new spot, lit it up with two yawks
Niggas hit the floor like they was doing burpees
White tee looking like he spilled a cherry slurpy
Almost died in LA for doing some bad business
Bout to die in the A for doing some bad business
Knocking on death’s door, no Jehovah’s witness
Lying in a pool of blood, now he praying for forgiveness


She dancing at the club, her new name peaches
Making money cause she flyer than these country beaches
At least that’s what she think, her pussy just as pink
Walking round backstage like her shit don’t stink
The other girls got tired of her acting Hollywood
They held her down and cut her face up pretty good
She left the ER, stitches for her three scars
Guess who she seen on her way to the car?
Her homeboy shot up, laying on a stretcher
Blood dried up all round his mouth, looking like some ketchup
They ran away from home to escape all the drama
But no matter where you run you never escape karma",https://genius.com/Murs-peache-lyrics
Ease Back,F’Real,1997.0,"Aight...
I'm the sickest with this microphone, nigga better learn it
All them bitch industry niggas you know I ain't concerned with
See I move thousands hand to hand, even got an increasin # of fans
In foreign lands, Amsterdam, Australia to Japan
All before my sign hit the line that was dotted
The man holdin the golden apple, y'all grapple for the one that's rotted
To the core I've been hard, since 1580
Mack attack nigga I've been scarred, knowin what the fuck I gotta do
Fuckin rockin a spot or two I wanna leave an impression on minds
Like reading ""Behold a Pale Horse"" for the first time
Expose wack niggas like secret societies when Murs rhyme
Explore cyphers after I visit, for close encounters with the serf kind
Your nigga thought he was nice, until he heard mine
And the doper you think you gettin the more you ain't understood the first line
I said learn of my affliction, and how my words wrap around
More niggas necks than the pictures of the crucifixions
Rippin mics when on
Name hold more weight than a 24 inch python
So what'chu gonna do, when Murs-mania run wild on you?
Bringin that crack to your back like the whip in Castlevania 2
And I'm through, bitch

When I grab a microphone, all I want is feedback
Energy from the crowd shit a nigga need that
Y'all wanted a change in rap, well fool we be that
And all you bitch niggas best to ease back
Now when I grab a microphone all I want is feedback
Energy from the crowd shit a nigga need that
Y'all wanted a change in rap, well fool we be that
And all you bitch niggas best to ease back

Now I write rhymes as dope as Jennifer Lopez
Words, beautify blank paper
Like, top to bottom pieces on skyscrapers
Ain't no stoppin us
Rollin thick like smog through your metropolis
Makin it hard to breathe
When you enter the 20,000 leagues, so stay at your level and place
Cause amateurs fuckin with the treble and bass
Will get left dead before they make the third pace
See I turn around shootin off at the mouth, like New Year's Eve
Sayin that shit you just, wouldn't believe
Retrieved from the far corners of my mental space
Leave you shocked like John Travolta once you open up this mental case
So we happy, as long as fools stop tryin
To come up from the back and attack me, like my name was Marcellous
And those overzealous we got our blowtorch and pliers
So you for damn sure gonna tell us what we want to hear
Sorta like my album but ""Life is Too $hort"" so I'm tryin to make one a year
To make y'all niggas watch what you do like the Wonder Years
Watch them niggas you think is down
They only down cause they carryin, a ton of fear
It's been a while since I've relieved myself of that burden
So I'm makin sure I'm goin all out, until they call it curtains
While you busy in the man's face shuckin and smirkin
I'll be lurkin in the cut, happy with bein the broke nigga that I am
It's all about the Washingtons, WHAT?!",https://genius.com/Murs-ease-back-lyrics
Six Shooters,MURS Is My Best Friend,UnKnown,"Fuck everybody
Fuck everybody
Fuck everybody and that ain't gotta rhyme with nothing
That's just how I feel
Not the Mad Rapper, just a brother with no deal
Rocked all around the world on the strength of my skill
Japan, Australia and Europe know the deal
Gave it up for L.A. at every spot I chill
For y'all that don't know
Living Legends is the band on this six shot revolver
Not an automatic but it's guaranteed to jam to the start to the finish
A smile on my face when the Beat Junkies spin this
From 18th Street to the show lines on Venice
I love my city
L.A. fool what?
Talk bad about my town?
Dude, fucking shut up
'Fore I have to come through and
Psst, psst, psst; beat everybody up
Grab the microphone, I'll eat everybody up
Except for Ab Rude
Had to make a funny
Fuck battle raps, I'm 'bout the good times and money
My hood rhymes and honies
That's all that really counts
Breaking up MC's like I'm breaking up an ounce
Strictly for the prophet
A lyrical assassin
Love latina's always
Simply abbreviated, means I love L.A
Mid-City one time, now what the doctor gotta say?

Quick!
Summon your troops, here comes Oop
I rock the loops that makes the fly girls Shoop
Like Pepa and Salt, plus get loose like a leper
Kicking much caboose with the  lecture
You might catch a bad two or three
Cause on the mic it's you or me
I've got a poetry degree from USC
Actually mine is South Central with a six shooter pistol
Here comes Siskel and Ebert and leave without Siskel
In this flick
I wiggle my nose like Bewitched
Blinker, blinker, blinker and extinct your whole outfit
All y'all
Street rhyme fight scenes recall
Mike Tyson beating down Mitch Green in a street brawl
Catch a hee-haw from a black rap Ryu
Mister Verbal Sunshine will ride through and fry you
Even if Don King's beside you or Trinidad
We can't lose Oop ooze from the pen and pad",https://genius.com/Murs-six-shooters-lyrics

Now this fool been on my ass for the past couple years
Jumped on the scene from nowhere, takin out all my peers
And of my whole squad I'm the last one left
Cause for some strange reason I always stay one step ahead
Of this Agent named Red
But for the life of me, I can't figure out why my ass ain't dead
And now I clear my head, as we arrive on the site
Makin sure, all routes for escape are sealed off airtight
Thinkin to myself, tonight's the night
Cause I know exactly where he's going
Fuck the double-oh-seven, I'm the Living Legend
With the +Goldeneye+ holding my rifle for assault
Aimed directly at the vault
But what happened next, wasn't even my fault
You see from the rear, a strange mist appeared
Strapped on the infrared gear too late
Because soon as it came, it disappeared
And when the smoke cleared, the package was gone
My squad searched savage 'til dawn; then had to e-mail HQ
That the knight had just captured the pawn
We swept the crime scene but it was clean, no clues left behind
So I shot back to the hotel
Had a couple drinks, now I'm back online
Not knowin that's where I'd find the next clue
It said Agent Blue, I'll meet you next
Where the stars are at they best and the sun rest too
So I headed due West
To the town where every night creates a new murder story
But stars at they best didn't mean Hollywood, but the observatory
So I cased the joint
Faced the point that I might not know if I was it
Came across the schedule of events
Next on the list to speak was the scientist
Set to unravel, new theories on time travel
Theories that my agency, already knew to be proven
I guess Red's clients was gonna try to stop us on the move-in
Now I know exactly what he's doin
So the next day at the lecture
I came disgused as the staff director
Even ushered Agent Red himself down the aisle
And just had to smile cause he didn't even know it was me
Then I shot to the balcony where I was supposed to be
Got to the top, my heart damn near stopped
This boy left the spot
Before I could ask where did he go
I turned around lookin down the barrel of his fo'-fo'
He was like aiyyo, just follow me down the hall
And we won't have no problems at all
So I did that, slid the gat into position
Just in case he tried to make this my last mission
Walked all the way down the hallway into an empty room
Where I assumed I'd be dead
Waited a couple of seconds, turned my head
Fool puttin down his weapons, so I did the same
Slipped my coat off, and jumped into a stance
To let this fool know he was about to get broke off
He spoke soft, said it was to death
I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, but when I opened my eyes
This fool's about to catch me by surprise
With the first series of blows
I'm up to par, I stayed on my toes
But connected with the next swing
Cut me hella deep with his ring
I looked down at his hand, damn
That's the same ones the man from the agency
Said I had around my neck when they found me
I thought he was the only one in existance
But this nigga ground me, so I held up my hand
So he could see what I saw, he stood there in awe
Dropped his guard, I took one to the jaw
But he didn't trip cause it only made us even
We stood there for a second not believin the shit
We sat down, talked for a grip, I came up on hella dirt
Found out we was brother seperated at birth
By the agency especially trained to maintain
The illusion of international espionage
By holdin up this mirage
Everybody in the Department of National Defense got rich
Now ain't that a bitch? They say we ain't got enough ends
In the budget, for public housing education and health care
So right then and there
Me and my brother about to plan to get over on the man
Went back to the agencies and played the role
But on the under strived towards one common goal
See we both contraband in foreign lands, it'll be enough
We give a fuck, we move the shit by the truck
And the scheme worked like a beauty
So after a couple years we injured ourselves in the line of duty
And of course the agencies showed us no love
But now this is the story I tell my children
On the shores of the islands we bought
From the money we came up off of... bitch~!",https://genius.com/Murs-the-saint-lyrics
Owner$hip,$hut Your Trap,2014.0,"All my house, don’t own a gun
Two kids, my only sons
I got my own money, you ain’t the only one
I’m on my grown man shit, and I’m on one
Ownership, you ain’t on this shit
Ownership, that’s why you on my dick
Ownership, you ain’t on this shit
Ownership, yeah I own this shit

I made a million dollars selling 5 dollar tapes
You niggas had to sell your soul just to get a play
Underground king and an all-time great
Humble cause I wouldn’t be shit without my fan base
A four door Volvo, late model under bucket, learned that from 4 O
500 dollar backpack holding three racks
Drop it at the diamond store, the homies told me keep that
These niggas think I’m broke though
Dirty ass vans and a can of four loco
I don’t do jewelry or videos with broke hoes
This 2014, what the fuck you selling dope for?


Atlantic, Universal, nigga I don’t give a fuck
Interscope, Warner Brothers, all of y’all are getting fucked
Corporations raping you, better get your paper
Bullshit walking money, talk my nigga, you ain’t saying much

In Italy the homies told me fuck 
Free pussy ride, while we at it we should kill Kony
In the Chi, there was 45 homicides
And that’s just January, god bless the south side
I still got to give back, hundred million dollars and you still ain’t did that
Poverty is still a problem where you used to live at
Turkey giveaways on holidays can’t fix that
I still put my chips up, certified goonie on a mission for the rich stuff
I’m long money, little dude, you’s a quick buck

Molemen And MURS Gets Mean,MURS Is My Best Friend,UnKnown,"See my crew got me censored cause I say too much
But these rap ass niggas do it way too much
I'm always into some shit
They say I play too much
But this shit ain't a game
These lames done bit our shit!
They wasn't screamin' independent before 1996
They was shoppin' a demo
On a label, got dropped
Then they came back screamin' ""Underground hip hop""
And I'm supposed to except it?
That's why you never see them featured artist on my record
They make good music, so I gotta respect it
But those two words
Are as close as we get to being cool and connected
I""m calm and collected
Till someone pushed a button
Like these rap motherfuckers that be out there frontin'
I can't hold back
I just gotta say somethin'
You gotta understand
I feel it's my duty
To bang for my fans
So if you say it on a record and I catch you contradicting
I'm gonna step right up
And pull your card with the quickness
This culture is my life and y'all keep tryin' to make it business
So forgive me while I make my cash
And keep my heart in it
Living Legends
We own the underground
While y'all hoes just rent it
Like that warehouse that you lived in
Deny it all day, but our influence is a given
Plus the whole industry
Bit our live performance, tryin' to steal our energy
Your show wasn't hype when I used to pay to see
But now you jump around on stage lookin' gay as can be
It's plain to see
Who's the leaders of the pack
That's why I can see
Why my crew keeps comin' back
To do a song with, bond with you
But y'all ain't about shit
So I'm not tryin' to get along with you
So shut your fuckin' mouth when you're talkin' to me
Sayin' you some successful independent MC
All that yappin', man please
Your pockets are as broke as my fuckin' Japanese
I'm servin' L.D
Rollin' to L.D
Y'all still stuck on CD-R so what the fuck you tellin' me?
Absolutely, positively not a motherfuckin' thang
We invented with game
Y'all gotta think about us
(With every tape you slang)
Y'all gotta think about us
(Whenever your show is lame)
Y'all gotta think about us
