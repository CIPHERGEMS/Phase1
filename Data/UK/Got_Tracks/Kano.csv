3 Wheel-Ups,Made in the Manor,2016.0,"3 wheel-ups in a row
That means I'm a direct rudeboy
2 2 yats of my own
That means I'm a direct rudeboy
Man can't call up my phone
Then gwan like a direct rudeboy
One side bag and a stoney
Don't make you a direct rudeboy

Some MCs come with the wickedest talk
But really, dem man chat crap
Acting like a donny but they're gonna backtrack
When real niggas step on the riddim and chat facts
I don't put myself in places
If I weren't there then I weren't, let's face it
If you weren't there then you weren't, that's basic
I kill 'em with the realest shit and they hate it
I'm a diffuser, can't act tougher than you are round me
I've got youts dem tougher than you are round me
I nearly died for the game, that's right
But some spitters ain't nuttin' around me
I was getting 'em hyper, you was touching your lighter
I was king of the mic and I'm a motherfucking G
None of you are bad round me, it's not only about me though
Let me give a shoutout to my scene

Pussy and rum, that's a rider for real MCs
Me and Wiley had a clash, that's a real MC
Hold tight D Double E, that's a real OG
I said hold tight D Double E, that's a real OG
Mad, reload ting
Pop, pop, pop, that's a reload ting
And when I say ""it's Kano in the house""
Everybody knows that's a reload ting
If you've been shotting in the manor from way back when
And you ain't on a kilo ting
I don't wanna hear about cunch and food and tings
Man don't do those tings
On-sight, thought he was onside, init
Saw them guys, no shots fired, init
If you ain't real then don't ride, init
That postcode, that's offside, init
Badman from which part? Dem man do witchcraft
Dem man do obeah, us man are kosher
I've been that nigga since Kickers and loafers
In bits where kids don't give a shit about olders
Where man don't care 'bout fathers
Man just care 'bout figures
Man don't care 'bout yards
Man just care 'bout Bimmers
Man don't care whose arm
Man just care if it's blinging
Man don't care 'bout masks
Man'll do it bare-face, init
We don't do none of that bare-face fibbing
The realest shit on your airwaves, init

3 wheel-ups in a row
That means I'm a direct rudeboy
2 2 yats of my own
That means I'm a direct rudeboy
Man can't call up my phone
Then gwan like a direct rudeboy
One side bag and a stoney
Don't make you a direct rudeboy

Can't tell me nuttin'
Cook down mutton then pass through the gutter
Link Jus D red cups out the cupboard
In the jungle, I move with original nuttahs
And the same madman fly out for the summer
Lick two blocks? Who are you? Runners
Shut down dance, who am I? Shottas
Couple wheel-ups at Butterz, that's nuttin'
Boiling point, I keep it 100

Yeah, G goes in
Bag a three-pointer, free throw ting (swish)
Niggas looking at me on a keyhole ting
I'm a gangster and a gentleman, G-host ting
I'm a skinny nigga, nigga, me so slim
Put the jimmy on, that's when the D goes in
Man are getting money, type the keycodes in
Please can I have my money? What's the keycode pin?
Fuck that, niggas wanna act, we back them up
Knife game-giving if it's backs, I axe them up (switch it)
I'm man of the match, I matched it up
And I'm with the bats, I patched it up
Sitting in the trap with crack to cut
I'm sitting in the caff and cracked a cup
I'm silly with the MAC, man mashed 'em up
I hit him with the blap, then backed the truck
So gully, we so slick
K, Hollow, we both pimps
Can't look inside the window, nigga, peep those tints
Better tell the waiter, better leave those drinks
Add a little bass, you better leave those synths
I'm silly with the clip, I'm gonna teach those chimps
Man ah put it on him when we see those wimps
I'm finished with the little nigga, he's so rinsed
He's so jinxed, I'm king
And he's no prince
I let it bap, bap, bap, ping ping
And then leave no prints
I said that, that, that, that's me
And yes, he's so skint
I'm in the matte black 350
With Clarke, let beef go mince

If you don't look after your own yout, boy
You're not a direct rudeboy
And you're in DSTRKT popping that Goose, boy
You're not a direct rudeboy
Bond Street, just bought brand new Gucc, bwoy
And you man can't get a new toy
That's why a man's BM just preed
Then sent me a direct, rudeboy
16 bars in effect
Might just upset a man's lyrics
Take this pen to your neck
And just Joe Pesci man with it
Cash rules everything around me
That's word to a Method Man lyric
Yeah, I roll deep in the East
But I still might Megaman with it
Yeah, I said it, yeah, yeah, I said it
Cheques, we get it, cash and collec' it
That likkle pellet, that nah gon' mek it
Rest his head in that man's spaghetti
Yout dem are menace, nuttin' like Dennis
Man got straps, ain't even got credit
Kids push prams to Westfield to lick it
And run from pigs, don't even watch Peppa
Real go-getter, geezers know better
But geezers need excitement, says Skinner
Don't resort to violence, no, never
Man just start with violence, go figure
Eat man's food before man eat dinner
Buss that booze, I roll and drink liquor
Left that Giggsy gap for my nigga

3 wheel-ups in a row
That means I'm a direct rudeboy
2 2 yats of my own
That means I'm a direct rudeboy
Man can't call up my phone
Then gwan like a direct rudeboy
One side bag and a stoney
Don't make you a direct rudeboy

Ps & Qs,Home Sweet Home,2005,"Some manors don't like me, they try and badmind me
When Kano comes to town
All I say is ""mind's right"", and they lose the limelight
When Kano comes around
Some try screw me or even slew me
But it don't work 'cause the crowd don't boo me
You ain't a true G, I'm too deep
How can Kano stay underground?
I ain't like most that roll around
And kick shit off, I hold it down
But we're still gully
The only 'pop' you'll hear from us is
Pop-pop-pop, then we're out
Act up and get boxed in the mouth
'Cause you're just playing a gangster
You ain't never weighed the ounce, fought a bouncer
You ain’t never hid no blots in your mouth
You ain't got love in North, West and South
And I'm an East boy, you're a chief boy
I finish it when you start the beef boy
Girls like me but I ain't a sweet boy, so boy
Don't think you can move to me and think I'll be asleep boy
'Cause I'm on my P's and Q's
That's why I make more P's than you's
Even when I'm in 3s and 2s, slip?
There ain't no reason to, slipping
If there ain't a blitz between the clique, that's slipping
No whip, out the manor linking chicks?
That's slipping, that's slipping

If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you
If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you
If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you
If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you

I hate losing, so I ain't snoozing
From London to Luton, I'm moving
I'm even merking overseas
And I got it locked from London to Leeds
Please, from time you heard me shine
Now I'm big from London to Merseyside
You got lines but you spit like nursery rhymes
This year's gotta be mine, I'm the first in line
Wow, you got your first rewind
But the second line sounded like the first line
I ain't got punchlines, I got kick lines
And I ain't commercial but I got hit lines
I spit deep rhymes
But I've got the girls on my side from the first rewind
You might see my face in a magazine
Or in a fur coat in FACE Magazine
'Cause they're spreading the word down from raves that I been
And they're bringing the purse out to pay for my team
I couldn't give a shit, I'm breaking the scene
Making a scene then start making the cream
Seen? I got a gang with me
And we all walk with a gangster lean
You're all talk, you don't wanna ramp with me
There's no jokes or no pranks with me

If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you
If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you

If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's,
 
in sneaks or shoes
We're in a Honda, fuck it, no Jeeps and coupes
We'll chief your crew, we're so hungry, we'll teef your food
So mind out before you find out who you're speaking to
I speak to youths on a level, and speak the truth
So please, there's thug in me
But there ain't no me in you
And please, you ain't bussing one, let alone squeezing two
Say cheese, but it won't be a snapshot
Pull out and try and hit like the jackpot, leave
I ain't waiting around, baiting the town for Kane to be found
That's slipping
If there ain't a blitz between the clique
That's slipping
No whip, out the manor linking chicks?
That's slipping, that's slipping

If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you
If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you",https://genius.com/Kano-ps-and-qs-lyrics

This Is England,Made in the Manor,2016.0,"I'm from where Reggie Kray got rich as fuck
East London, who am I to mess tradition up?
Jellied eels, pie and mash, two pints of that Pride on tap
Polo top, pair of stans, flat cap and a Burberry mac
Some ASBO kids on the crack here
Super tenants on a park bench, brown packet
Yeah, that's the hood, yeah, that's the hood
I'm just a 2Pac nigga in a town full of Suges
Tryna be straight in this town full of crooks
Know when you've never seen a man buy a Bentley with a book
We take to water like a duck, headed to the green
But getting caught up in the rough
Story of my life, and I'm just giving you the crux

The wheels keep on turning, we keep on earning
Streets lead to wars and spies
Be sure we keep on moving forward
Straight, straight as the arrows fly

Back when Lethal Bizzle was Lethal B
This is how we used to dun the dance in East
We used to spit 16s til they called police
Probably somewhere in a party or a dark shebeen
This is England, this is England
Where you could be a villain or a victim
Where you make money, make it out, avoid pen
That's the idiot's guide to the manor, my friend

Uh, it's been a long time coming, like Sam said
A change gonna come for the masses
Bars back, give that dark shit a damn rest
Rap for the have-nots and the have-less
This my Rocky stairway flow
Something those Apollos wouldn't know
Brother and a mother, where's Daddy?
Ah, fuck it, same old, same old
Face bothered, suit, three piece, Nucky Thompson
Fight against the odds to the top like Jack Johnson
You can keep the more money if you keep the problems
I can keep it real, can you keep it 100?
Just bought a soda pound sign said
Stripped and underground, king of his highness
Now what will come first, getting rich or the dying?
The tears or the violins?

The wheels keep on turning, we keep on earning
Streets lead to wars and spies
Be sure we keep on moving forward
Straight, straight as the arrows fly

Back when Lethal Bizzle was Lethal B
This is how we used to dun the dance in East
We used to spit 16s til they called police
Probably somewhere in a party or a dark shebeen
This is England, this is England
Where you could be a villain or a victim
Where you make money, make it out, avoid pen
That's the idiot's guide to the manor, my friend

It's not a hip hop party without a butt twerk
It's not a real rap song without a cuss word
It's not a house party without a shuffle
It's not a garage rave without champagne
Back when Wiley was Wiley Kat
This was how we used to get the party gassed
CS, get the party gassed
Then you covered your face and dossed out the back

I'll tell you, back when Lethal Bizzle was Lethal B
This is how we used to dun the dance in East
We used to spit 16s til they called police
Probably somewhere in a party or a dark shebeen
This is England, this is England
Where you could be a villain or a victim
Where you make money, make it out, avoid pen
That's the idiot's guide to the manor, my friend
Back when Lethal Bizzle was Lethal B
This is how we used to dun the dance in East
We used to spit 16s til they called police
Probably somewhere in a party or a dark shebeen
This is England, this is England
Where you could be a villain or a victim

Boy Better Know
, flow of the year

Jme, watch this flow of the year
Over the bloodclart beat of the year

No brandy, we don't rave
No gyal dem, we don't rave
Unless it's big bumbaclart, rasclart riddim
Boy better know me nah in love with them

Skip on it, skip on it
Bullying beats yeah, pick on it, pick on it
Real talk, mic ah did Titch on it, Titch on it
Shoulders, Louis V bag and a chip on it, chip on it
Rah, Kano sounds sick on it, sick on it
Send for the dock like hickory, dickory
This ain't no Trey Songz, eight pack
But gyaldem want blow a kiss on it, kiss on it
Blow that out, make a wish on it, wish on it
Remember the phone with Kick on it?
Different brand liquor, manaman are from the east side
Used to be the weed guy, now I went beeline
Ring just to revines, I'll write these grime bars

Print on my outfit inferiors
Might just cop them Red Octobers
Wear an all-red suit like Delirious
Man wanna beef on Twitter, not serious
Suck your mum's vagina interior
Through a Ribena straw
? No, fuck that
Capri Sun on Good Friday
Wishing it was a piece of pork
She won a MILF award though
And gave that speech like a seasoned salt though
Red, red wine and a decent Bordeaux
They malfunction, that's a decent wardrobe
No back seats in the silver Porsche though
Give her that D and I don't mean an auto
Born in a club like a thief to sort code
And rob Peter, but I didn't pay Paul though
Ghetto like Pardner, Dax and cornrows

Jme, watch this flow of the year
Over the bloodclart beat of the year
Feds on the case but we don't care
Mandem, straps and everything there
No champagne, we don't rave
No brandy, we don't rave

Boy better know me nah in love with them

12 years a flow, serious
And the award goes goes to?
Better be me, brother
If it's another nominee, brother
I'mma let you finish your speech, brother
But Kano had the best flow of all time
Before God, thank me, brother
Serious, freestyles are go, serious
Raw, off the dome, serious
No fucking edit for the radio, serious
Nigga say something 'bout Jamie
Then you're fucking with Boy Better Know, serious
Wanna hear Kane on my grind? Then spot motherfuckers there you go
Then you're not serious, no

Jme, watch this flow
Over the bloodclart beat of the year
Feds on the case but we don't care
Rifle, uzi, everything's serious
Hold tight Raskit on that one
No champagne, we don't rave
No vodka, we don't rave
No Jäger, we don't rave

T-Shirt Weather in the Manor,Made in the Manor,2016.0,"69 Manor Road, Sunday morning
Dorothy be up but Jennifer be yawning
Rachel a get her hair braided, I spoil it
One side be looking like Don King, don't it?
Ribs in the oven, catch a whiff
Heartless Crew on Mission, catch a crisp biscuit, whoa
Ice cream van, yeah, chase it down
Screwball, 99 Flake et al
Newham Leisure Centre where the girls at
Hair gelled down to her face where the curls at
Money on the table, Frustration, get mummy's purse out
Forward some summers, I'm racing the latest Merc out, it worked out
'Cept Everton's locked up, but we don't talk about it
Lee and Karys don't speak, and things ain't cool with Aaron
But amongst all the bullshit, it's love though
You've gotta love London in the sun, bro, ya dun know

That's what we call T-shirt weather in the manor, my friend
There's nuttin' like T-shirt weather in the manor, my friend
The Gs come out when the sun goes in
There something 'bout T-shirt weather in the manor, my friend

Barbecue all day, you're in the garden
Breezer and Alizé, get the party starting
Gyaldem be loving my TNs, jheeze
Back it up and whine pon mi den, peak
DJ got the Tina Moore and MJ Cole
The olders asking for some Dennis Brown but then you got
That one elder that wants to be young
Dancing on the floor to hype funk
The mood switches when the sun goes in
And birthday boy's mum goes in
Rudeboys pull up in the Bimmer, yes
What's that smell? That ain't cigarette
Neighbours'll complain to get the party locked off
Just to rain on our parade, but then a younger sprays
CS gas, everybody run, bro
You've gotta love the city in the sun, bro, ya dun know

That's what we call T-shirt weather in the manor, my friend
There's nuttin' like T-shirt weather in the manor, my friend
The Gs come out when the sun goes in
There something 'bout T-shirt weather in the manor, my friend

And it could all change in a minute, I've seen innocent summers turn sinister
Tempers flare up, violence is imminent
Especially post fit but you know the Streets video
Here we go, it was all good just a week ago
Seems like yesterday we was one people
Ten man onstage back to back, bare reloads
Ayia Napa weather, quarter lengths
They say the globe's warm and it's getting hot in the ends
That's when you swap the tees for the vests, but I'm talking kevlar
Cause things just ain't cool anymore
And bricks might ruin your door, trust dem youts anymore
Never Super Soaker 2000s don't shoot anymore
My deal got signed so the spirits all up
We shot the album front cover up by the shops
We just wanna rep the manor right, give it props
But some bredders run up on man, rah, the beef was on
So same night, shots fired, it weren't even man that did it
Buss a man but ride for man and take it where I didn't envisage
Now I've got big time crooks calling the house like ""what is it?""
If we need to put in work, say the word and it's finished
Man just wanna make an album, mind my business
All this gangster shit, who wants to sleep with the fishes?
Success has a price and it's pretty
Penny for your thoughts and they'll try make you split it
They say the ends love you, then they hate you, then they love you again
Then you try change your postcode to W10
Grow apart, fall out of love with your friends
They'll say fame made you change but it's just all them
Some of them get cat, some of them go pen
Send mi likkle VO, gwan sit with them
Send them one two creps and Ralph Lauren
While they build up this picture that I'm 50 Cent
Rah, Kano's your darg, when you land, you're blessed
And these times, I ain't even blessed Jen
Now they all wanna come on tour but that's per DMs
Guest list, me plus thirty men
I buy the same Mr Whippy 99
But now I've got just as much problems and a flake ain't one
Friends turned snakes overnight
Cause they think I can take away their problems all with one hit song
But I just want the summer back how it used to be
When Nanan had us eating toffee apples by the sea
Or when we wore Moschino and were moving off key
When our chips were down, they weren't beefing 'bout Ps
The purest summers were those in the 90s
'05 changed my life forever, it's bittersweet
I've been riding that wave, still waters run deep
No sand in the ends, still life is a beach
And that's T-shirt weather in the manor, my friend
There's nuttin' like it
'05 shit",https://genius.com/Kano-t-shirt-weather-in-the-manor-lyrics

That's mree, mree
Badabuh buh

Them ah' pree me, I can see angles
Get money, get snakes by your ankles
Any cobras can get handled
Got 'nuff raw soldiers like Dangles
Bun MCs then bun candles
Keep it on wax, that's an eediat ting
Rather thump man and don't talk about it
That's an inside box for your hand ball
Penalty! That's a penalty!
Tour bus look like a Den of Thieves
Champagne shopping like 10 of each
Non-stop popping to the cemetery
They dun know about me!
War time roll out with pure gun man about me!
They can't come around East
Who's that? Get back, draw for the Mac
You can't ramp wi-di-wi-di-wit-it
I'm gonna kill him with it
Might act silly with it
East End legend like Double O wi-di with it
Don't dally, don't dilly with it
No man, I stick Lillies with it
Grown man on some kiddy business
I do rapper and BAFTA shit
Like Bushkin, can't take away my classics kid
If it's war I'ma take it to the mattresses
Where were you back then?
Where were you back then?
Man was putting in work on the roof back then
With a few mandem
Swear no word of a lie I'm the truth right now
I were the truth back then
Man better call Roony for some proof right now
Before we do fact checks

Ooaaah ooaahhh
Badabuh buh
Man can't try school me on this
Man can't try school me on that
Been there, did this and I done
Man been there, did this and I done that
Man run up in houses, run up in flats
Slapped up dogs and slapped up cats
In beef man come with this and that
Man can't try school me about this
Man can't try school me on that
Been there, did this and I done
Man been there, did this and I done that
Man run up in houses, run up in flats
Slapped up dogs and slapped up cats
In beef man come with this and that
No love, man are moving
Badabuh buh

Them think man are bad til man start checking credentials
Wreck instrumentals
They know bout the pen game
But man are still leading with pencils
They ain't been to the mountain once
Shaolin monk when I step in his temple
Tag team, man see legends assemble
Backseat youngers step out with men's tools
Ryu's and Ken's
Why you with them?
Rude boy, mind where you tread
That's thin ice
I see my yute through the lens
That's fish-eye
Believe no truth in your rep
And still I
Reload, do it again
And then deny
Mutual friends wanna ask
Why did I?
What!? Why did I?
Repercussions
Steven, I even suttin'
5 nights, 1 wap that's - even numbers
Hooded up, man see the reaper coming
See, I'm way too gifted
Kill an MC with bare different flows
I can kill an MC with
Presence alone
Level and tone
Timeless and definite flow
And try nuff a take a man's throne
Make a man know
My man's tekkers is cold
Impeccable form
Jason levels was born
In East London where weapons get drawn
Big beef levels with horns
Meat cleavers and several swords
Tea leafs, felons and frauds
CVs read and get torn
These demons could level with Spawn

Ooaaah ooaahhh
Badabuh buh
Man can't try school me on this
Man can't try school me on that
Coz I been there, did this and I done
Yeah man been there, did this and I done that
Man run up in houses, run up in flats
Slapped up dogs and slapped up
In beef man come with this and (nah)
Man can't try school on this
Man can't try school me about that
Coz' I been there, did this and I done
Yeah, been there, did this and I done that
Man run up in houses, run up in flats
Slapped up dogs and slapped up cats
In beef man come with this and that
No laugh, man are moving
Badabuh buh

Trying to stay out of harms way but the trouble keeps on miscallin'
Can't wrap me up when I'm home alone
Man ain't Macaulay me, no Culkin
Live by, then die by, plus pussioles are informers
That's why all the soldiers keep fallin'

Hail,Made in the Manor,2015.0,"Welcome to the jungle
King of this shit, royal blood, welcome to the rumble
Every man for himself, Koko B Ware, in the square ya na
Inside the square circle cuz, curb your trust
If I kill us and rob us and serve us up

Snakes in the grass, give the turf a cut
Can't befriend then burgle us
Killing these bills, Uma Thurman'd up
Getting that belly like Sherman Klump
Show's over when the curtains shut
But mines are blinds and I'm turning up
Who are ya? Bet you heard of us
Big mic man like merciless
They say grime's not popping like it was back then
Rap's not honest like it was back then
When I get gassed in the booth like this
Niggas go bonkers like it was MAC-10
Roll Jack Jones if it ain't mandem
And again and again
Roll Jack Jones if it ain't mandem
Don't make money but it does make sense
Karmas of arsonist
Light up a dance like bars when there's sparklers
Out in Marms with an army of Dahms with us
Your clique, one bars, holy 
I be in  still they're going yard ya na
Rolling the rustlers, holy bivariate
Then I be back in East with the Gs
That ain't no gangsters, mate, that's the guv'nors
Sweet geez, ark at him
Cotching on Ermine Road where the barber's is
With a whole leap of man, yeah 'nough of us
You know them man that draw knife in an argument
That shamone, you're a man like it's nothing then
Come and round up the sticks like carpenters
You wanna squash that beef but it's started
Man’s at your door like “Would ya like to buy a carpet?”
Stick to the script
Real educated ignorant shit
Dom Perignon just to binge on the shit
Yo, if it bubbles, put your finger in it
White chicks fling G-strings when I spit
Blacker days, would've got lynched for this shit
Would've got whipped for this shit
Now I push a German Whip on a bitch
Now everybody wanna get Jigga rich quick
Want it handed to them likkle privileged kids
Hands in the cookie jar, ripping off riffs
I guess that's taking the flipping biscuit
Stealing a living with your sticky fingers
Crossing that pond and fishing for hits
We both gain from a little influence
But how comes nobody credits us Brits?
This ain't no RP cup of tea music
It's real east end theme music
No, I don't know the Queen
But that bitch stays in my jean pocket
No dubstepping on my toes
Don't fuck with my drum and bass
Shuffling to some council house
But it gets grimy in these raves
I've had dubplates on acetate
Dun know Kano was here
Used to shop in catalogs, now my catalog'll
Give these soundboys diarrhoea

Smash all of your CD rack
Won't get none of your CDs back
Smash all of your CD rack
Won't get none of your CDs back
Clear all of your CD rack
Won't get none of your CDs back
Smash all of your CD rack
Won't get none of your CDs back",https://genius.com/Kano-hail-lyrics
Nite Nite,Home Sweet Home,2005.0,"Seriously man
Like you know when you've got a good girl
Well you know when she means something to you
When you've got like a name
Like I had a name for this girl
I used to call her lady bird (here we go again)
Cos she always played red
In Connect Four
 (here we, here we go again)

Link 'em and then leave then 'em high
I've been tellin' all my man's for time
Link 'em and then leave 'em high
They never take my advice
But now I realise, I realise why
They have not been listening all this time
Cos since I linked you, last night
I won't be taking my advice

Look, I call her nite nite
Cos it seems from the day right to the bright light
That I like her too much to say bye-bye
And we were getting on fine right
I don't wanna spoil it
I don't know why
I can't commit to girls
And I tell white lies
I'll find out the hard way cos shes got my favourite smile
My favourite style, the first hotel, my favourite time
But late and we could have a baby maybe
A baby boy my favourite child
I'm way too tired, my favourite lie
My verse I'm so sure her favourite rhyme
The windows are steamed up it's shaking time
Wait we're way too bait
I bought her her favourite shoes (well they better be)
And shes even my favourite size
And she knows I hate holding hands and I'm hooded up when its bait inside
So I guess shes my favourite right

Right, Cos nothing comes close to you

So numbers no boys are taking yours
And no girls are taking mine
Groupies? Fuck that, I'm taking time
We speak from like 8 till late at night
When we gets on top, 
drop my favourite line (girl I ain't going nowhere)

I plain ain't going nowhere
But, I like you, and it might take some time
But really I'm like

Here we go again


I call her sometimes, and I wake her up at some dumb times
Touch my phone and her number my thumb finds
Cos shes ideal like a nice meal, and a night in with a nice film
Maybe some wine, 
maybe sometime we could
Hold hands in the park in the sunshine
Be patient with me if I've got three raves in a week
Or in the studio away for a week
One day we can book a vacation and leave
But please, no drama
I don't need beef like Shane, Forbe, Fabian and Dean
I'm just focused on making the peas
Braking the team, chasing the dream
I ain't on the street, maybe sometimes
But you can't say I don't make enough time
We speak every day and meet every week
But I don't know maybe its me
You got it planned out
I don't make plans
You know me I wait and I see
But if we were together or even now if we weren't sort of, but were together
Would you be faithful to me, treat me with a sarnie and make me a tea
Come link me late, 
wake up from sleep and still look hot
 like 
80 degrees

And you know I never say that sort of thing

See? That's an angel to me
I wouldn't have said that before
, you get me?
Like... she's making me weak


No, no, no, no, no, no
Oh my, my, ow
Baby we could do this again sometime
I even had a special name for you
It's 'Long Baby', cos you always on my mind, yeah
I'll tell you straight, so straight, yeah
I won't tell my mates (won't tell my mates)
No, no, I know, No, I know
Yeah I like you baby

Here we go again
Here we
Here we go again",https://genius.com/Kano-nite-nite-lyrics
Fire in the Booth,UnKnown,2016.0,"This is real nigga lyrics
Fake niggas can't look in real nigga mirrors
I know who I am and he knows who he isn't
Nan just cussed me out, said I don't even dial her digits
I don't see my nan unless she gets ceviche and fishes
I'm just on this money making mission
Out of town, shelling down, Money Making Mitching
And I've got plans to give the whole fam a bringing
Wish that I could show the whole fam the big picture
Cropping bruddas out if they don't play the right position
I know life looks rosy from where you're probably sitting
But these bucket leather seats ain't what I call winning
Can't put shoes on my nephew's feet with it
Can't put food in a nigga's fridge, can it?
2 2 luges make a nigga lose vision
All the red on these bottoms make a nigga non-Christian
Sip wine with the Mrs, break bread with my niggas
Table full of winners, do dinners, group pictures
With some big villains, wig splitters, brick dealers
But do due diligence, not one goon with us
Everyone around me boss, no seat-fillers
But I am no success unless the mandem are legitimate
Play Ghetts all day, then the mandem do Sizzla
But they beg to differ
Thank you mama for those nine months you carried me
I know I can be abrupt, it's the game, don't be mad at me
And Soph, I know you're worried 'bout me
And I'm quick to tell you don't worry 'bout me
My shoulders are for your tears, don't worry 'bout me
I know it's Balmain but don't worry 'bout it
This music shit's connected to my soul, my mood swings
My art's a major artery, can't function without it
Tryna conquer the mountain but these combos are landing
Then I think I'm out of range, but these punches are Dhalsim
No plaster for this pain, and I can't stand the rain
But I can fucking pour more rosé
I'm done with nightclub living
Vodka and lems, that's the nightclub spirit
I smile for the lens but these eyes say different
Nice likkle legs but her eyes say mischief
Too black for DSTRKT but the money too pinkish
So they'll turn a non-colour blind eye for our business
So we can get in long as we're spending like niggas?
Just as long as we don't bring our sisters
£2K table in the club, Ikea for the kitchen
But know that the sparklers is a mad ting
Baddest bitch, she ain't bringing nuttin' to the table
But know that the back off is a mad ting
Everybody gassed over the 'Gram ting
Everybody banging on a gang ting
Church's but still I do the Stans ting
Righteous but still I do the H•A•M ting, juh!
You can cut the tension with a Stanley
Everybody shuffling on mandy
I'm Narcos and chilling with some brandy
Pukka Pie or Peter's but not Andy, my family
2016, real niggas on the flat screen
Token white Charlie, Brylcreem in the family
I was in the upper class queue, posh ticket
Staff told me ""sorry, sir, you're in the wrong position""
Bigger idiot didn't say fuck all to Richard
So fuck all the riches, you can't fool the pigment
I know not with the MJ ting, I did moonwalk
And call me a yardie but the bleaching's unusual
Rappers never big up my name in interview talk
So is that the Goose talk when they see me, bro?
Different blokes, different strokes
What you talking 'bout winners 'less we're talking 'bout business?
Top proper figures, we're not cotton-picking
Catch me in the field, the cheque was real
If fuckers can't hear, they better feel
If words don't break bones, the weapon will
I'm taking my respect, better still
I'll take another zero on the deal
Then take some of my people to the grill
Love is something deeper to instill
Hate is really real
Grew up eating festivals, now we eat at festivals
Can I go off the record? Yeah, them records cool
But I don't wanna hear it 'less it's seminal
Gs move in silence, that's the veteran rules
Giggs told me I was scared to bless this booth
Ghetto even threw in his two pence and all
But that's the banter when the legends talk
Share some duppy, share, then some legs get pulled
I've been duppying from Stratford Rex, of course
I guess that you can call me Mr Mattress
What if I told you that Twin slept on this?
Not right or wrong, they write me off, I write lyrics
3000 tickets before one could even blink
That's why I thinks I'm the shit
Big man ting, I'm out here on a hitman ting
Yeah, not a kidnap king
Up and down on a wing back ting
Left Harrods with the big bag ting
Might catch Paddy with the big back ting
Hazards on on a zig zag ting
Rambo for the riff raff ting
Shout K for the click clack ting
Young bucks, go and spit that skin
Don't come back unless you bring back sins
Dish out Ls and I bring back wins
You can sink or swim
What's beef? That's not when you're mean
That's when you cover queen, it's blackjacks with no bring-backs, king
Then it's all-black suits when man sing that hymn, huh
Major cloth alert, thank my tailor for the work
All this fan love, got some makeup on my shirt
Just know I'm making millions if I make it to a hearse
Before I even make it in the dirt
You can't evaluate my worth, leave that talk in the barbers
Guess overestimating gets a stink's dick hard
And you want man to be your bredrin, your gyal and your father?
Stand on your own fucking two Balenciagas
You got the blue suedes, now what'd you need from me today?
Motherfuckers want their cake and to stuff their fucking face
You don't know my expenses, I've gotta buy bigger plates
But amazing as Heinz is, you should be buying grace
There's always one Ma$e out there puffying, can't club with him
Plus seven, I can't get the eighth cousin in
You know them spray the champs in the air man before the bill comes
They disappear, man, like say it's Old Bill but they got pills, huh
Fake it or you'll make it, never that authenticated
All these rappers Draking, bet he wish he had the patent
Rapper think he bad, I will son him, no Jaden
One million, I spray bars with no fragrance
P has got them kilos on the kilo chain like Aiden
AB just land, bet money man won't be so brazen
Problem with the kid? Now that's a problem in the making
Papapapapap and that's a big understatement
It's probably nine shots like five older iPods
This is not a friendly handshake after a Lord of the Mic war
Let bygones be bygones cause I'm from a time, don
Where pussyholes didn't have a platform to type on
When mic's on, I'm icon, when mic's off, I'm icon
Probably in a yardie dance whining a gyal with white on
Stitchery knows what I'm on, I do not floss with diamonds
If I went King of Diamonds, wouldn't make it rain with my ones
I go restaurants on my ones, either Peroni or it's Merlot
Never been platinum but I've probably been your girl's though
Certy, money make the world go in circles
Tell me how much times a feature had a better verse though?
Probably two or three, one unreleased
Talking Kartel level, talking 32 and G
Hollow tried sneak one up on man but we'll see after some shells
Just who got the upper hand, let's do the maths
I've been lenging down 14 years, that's one loss every 4.6
Ballon d'Or don't see scores like this, it's
Jigga statistics, taking the biscuit
Teenager tell me 'bout grime, kiddo, I lived it
Nearly said goodbye to the game, I might've kissed it
Yeah, now I got a new singalong, I Titched it
13, I blew the candles out and wished it
So still pinch myself that I've lived this
Life of a non-millionaire cause I'm gifted
Kanye moment coming up, I'm Prince sick
That so-called fans jumping back on my Linford
Still got inches spare for anyone listening
Never could I diss Bizzle, he is a king of this
I just wish I had a ""Fester Skank"" on my hitlist
Colombian fit Givenchy for the winters
But gas bill, catch me if you can for the winters
Shh, fed up of people saying that Kano is underrated
Show me who don't rate, nigga, and I'll show you who is hating
'Home Sweet Home' was my 'Off the Wall'
But still, I've got a 'Thriller' in me, everybody warned
Cause it's how you get up, it's not even 'bout the fall
Not the most fame but they'll put me in the hall
The elephant is in the room, where's the lions in this bitch?
Even sleeping giants wake up and take piss
Too many gangsters, not enough gentlemen
Too many bosses, not enough apprentices
Too many ride-alongs, not enough menaces
How them young bucks gwan know not to keep evidence?
Lyrics, flow, show, that's the three elements
Show a man your verse, that's MC etiquette
Cîroc and ginger beer, that is street decadence
I'm a pie-and-mash eating, east side resident
What's a grime renaissance save for my persistence?
Nothing, I was in Top Boy and Lebanon
Jme was flying the flag, that's evident
Straight from horse's mouth like Revenant
I can't run out of bars like Chippy said
Many men wish on my death like 50 Cent
Running through the six with my woes like Drizzy said
But there's an E on the beginning of that, I represent
Touch mic, I leng down dance, I'm Mr Leng
Every time you see me, a new one, I'm Mr Benz
Why you putting pressure on the game like this again?
I had a Gareth Southgate couple summers, I've missed the pen
Selfie be my circle's smaller, I'm missing friends
Some Mr Men, Mr Jealous, Mr Vexed
I'm Mr Everyone Went Right, I Took The Left
Now whose is best, me or Wretch?",https://genius.com/Kano-fire-in-the-booth-lyrics

Whine gyal to jungle but not no ballad
If a some of man's jeans looking MC Hammered
Nah, it's not that, he's just holding a hammer

Well, police wanna pull me over in my car
Check my licence and plates
Then ask me how much it cost
Get the fuck out my face
When man queue up for Jordans from 7
Shottas stack P till ashmans get em
All-white parties, but ain't no tennis

Might see the AMG in C-town
Might see Smithy, Woz, the old gang
You know the ends I'm talking about
Where man drop out of school but somehow
All of your pals are pharmacists now
Shotting that white girl from No Doubt
Flow of the year two times in a row
Done the debate and I am the G.O.A.T
Wheel and come again, get it right for the quotes
Done the debating, I am the G.O.A.T
And that's that East London MC
I'm born in streets slumbered with these
Cunt's lyrics, these one-off 16s
Duppy these beats, trumpets indeed

Listen, look, so mum went school with all of the gangsters
They know Mel but they call her Cassius
And them man still run shit from mansions
And wear Brogues and Adidas Campus
Yeah, I grew up with the towners
Stolen Ralph shit was standard
Old TV from the catalogue scammers
They robbed banks but they still had manners
They showed us what bangers and mash is
We showed them what dumpling and yam is
Build sound-systems in houses
Before garage one-finger skankers
And you wonder why we're so anti
Don't make Billboard, we make bangers
It's not grime if there ain't no ad-libs
BRAP! That's my ad-lib
First blacks in the Canning Town flats
Walking to school was an everyday scrap
They called our mothers coons
, now Mummy's in my coupe riding shotgun
Of course that fucker's all black
No tints in the front, let the manor see that
Wind down windows like I'm me that
Might go catch, grab a likkle sea bass
That MIDI keyboard made a likkle P, thanks
I grew up on jungle

 and D Double
When I was watching 
Zippy and Bungle
Was getting Supercat from my uncles
House partying to dancehall riddims
It's my DNA, I can't part with it
Before I knew the whole alphabet
I knew Zungguzungguguzungguzeng

Been doing this from 19 how long
Eskimo Dance, used to roll out 19 man strong
And drop a new banger, new banger
So if this ain't that shit to gas up Britain
Forgive me, for I am a sinner
Middle finger to mass-appealers
Casket fillers, the fashion killers
And from the classroom of free school dinners
Were space invaders and wagon wheelers
Rudeboys roll in 320 bimmers

All respect due to Shab and Skibba

A Roadman’s Hymn,Made in the Manor,2016.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh

Over this east side, yeah, that's the settings
Work all day just for toast and spaghetti
Kids outside on road BMXing
And see drug dealers roll up
So all they wanna be like
Chaps chain gold
Avirex jacket and a GTI Golf
Brown skin beauty and a pocket full of dough
And a presidential Roley frozen
So please don't ever act like you know man
If you ain't from round here, we don't spud no hand
Wonder why we worship cars and clothes, man
We don't own land so we're stuck in no man's
And gangsters are like superheroes to us
More chance of being them than a lawyer or doc
Idris lived one road away, what's the odds?
That's two black youts going straight to the top
Still repping that east side, fuck your perception
First class and five stars, hood up for breakfast
Claridge's for tea, Don P disrespect it
A hymn for the streets, let the hood niggas sing it like

Take off
Watch the mandem aim for that top
Champagne for the pain and Cîroc
God keep a roadman safe on that block
All night we dream of that life
All night we prepped for this fight
And to my dargs that hold me down
More life, more life

Please free the mandem that's locked up
I ain't saying that they never fucked up
But where is forgiveness?
Please free the mandem that's locked up
I ain't saying that they never fucked up
But where is forgiveness?

I remember when Bruno had the Punto and Manoor had the Civic
Had to twang a bouncer to get in when I was spitting
Always had the vision that one day it would be different
Nas told a brother it was written
Champagne sipping, pan fry two fishes
Used to go Yankees for £1 chicken
Youts see me on road and feel uplifted
Yeah, I'm still about these endless lyrics, blud, I live it
I see 'nough man get caught up in the system
Yet mandem sell drugs but mandem know business
The man that steals cars, that man there could fix it
If I didn't spit bars, could be behind them in the prison
Tell a kid he won't be shit, he won't be shit
I tell a kid like Will told me, ""you'll make Ps, kid""
And when that cheque came, I was with Smithy up in Camden
Then we popped champagne with my mumzy in East Ham
Fuck about, we celebrate

Take off
Watch the mandem aim for the top
Champagne for the pain and Cîroc
God keep a roadman safe on that block
All night we dream of that life
All night we prepped for this fight
And to my dargs that hold me down
More life, more life

Please free the mandem that's locked up
I ain't saying that they never fucked up
But where is forgiveness?
Please free the mandem that's locked up
I ain't saying that they never fucked up
But where is forgiveness?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh
It's on top right now
Cause I got my whole city turned up right now
Champagne for the pain and Cîroc right now
The mandem are way up right now, stay up right now
Smithy looks about 300k up right now
The smile on the kids says it's blatant right now
Jordan and Soraya's doing amazing right now
You know that means some motherfuckers hating right now
Gotta stop the sharking and the snaking right now
A hymn for the streets, niggas praying right now
Can I get a amen right now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Where too many man talk 'nuff blah blah
That's just the endz though
But you know that's just the endz

This is that flow you've been waiting for, flow they don't make no more, init?
Not 140 but it's fucking raw, init?
Play this on the way to the club and not in it
Made in the manor so it's fucking authentic
Try and crush a brother's spirit with your theories
Jigga said I was the best and niggas act like they didn't hear it
I ain't gassed over the cosign, I ain't in love with the CoCo
I ain't fucking with the po-po, I'm just fucking with the purists, who's realest?
Eight years independent, three cheers to the pen-smith
The game's wide open, I'm dentist
Tryna find space, I'm Tetris, not tryna lose faith, cross fingers
Brave face, can't see hecklers
Bad minds can't change never
Move spot but can't change a leopard's
All sheep can't be shepherd
And just when I was down the other week
Wretch phoned me and said without man like me, there's no heat, that's real

Inside, outside, rah, rah, rah
Where too many man talk 'nuff blah blah
That's just the endz, mate
Yeah, you know that's just the endz
Know what I said already, inside, outside, rah, rah, rah
Where too many man talk 'nuff blah blah
That's just the endz
Yeah, you know that's just the endz, geez

Heavy is the head that wears the crown though
I feel under pressure just to provide for the famo
I'm in disposition so I never tell a man ""no""
But I didn't ""Fester Skank"", remember, that's Lethal in the Lambo
But when we're on top, bruv, everybody's coming
Lambo for Lee and a chauffeur for Romy
Villa for Jen and a villa for Dotty
Ray-Ray no even worry about it, I got it, promise
Me and wifey just had beef
She's tryna marry me while I'm tryna marry beats
Love you unconditionally even if I don't speak it
First, let me duppy this scene shit
RIP Belangi shit
Play that monster boy through the speakers
Pour some Perignon on the floor, getting beaming
You're badman on the weekend
I'd rather box man and don't tweet it
Out, I drop man and don't greet him
You hear it and believe it, I seen it
Man get shanked up and we ain't leaving
Pour some more Cîroc, yeah, the peach shit
Coming like we're numb to the feeling
Like one brother's pain is another's inconvenience
That's deep shit, inside, rah, rah, rah
Where pillow-talking can get your clart wrapped up
Fish and chips open with the tartar sauce
Hold tight Smithy, that's my rasclart darg
Where niggas don't dance with the stars
Niggas drag stars out their cars
Make 'em spit bars for a pass
And this one won't chart, that's for certain
But I know that Giggs will say that I was murking

Mandem know they're on the inside, outside, rah, rah, rah
Too many man talk 'nuff blah blah
That's just the endz, though
Yeah, you know that's just the endz
You dun know already, inside, outside, rah, rah, rah
Where too many man talk 'nuff blah blah
That's just the endz, pal
You know that's just the endz",https://genius.com/Kano-endz-lyrics

On Mondays in case Friday flops
We celebrate life non-stop
Cah we made it off the block
And Bizzle got the Rolls Royce drop
G family vacay-ing like a boss
Tell a hater we made it
Never that, the saying complacent
This is that grinding through the grave shift
Now we're on stages
Reminiscing, times like then were so priceless
I was in the ends when Kenny from Network was buying out Benz
So now it's high end when I and I spend
Climatised yes
No shine on my neck
But the stripes on my creps so drug dealer-esque
You can smell the East on me
Like pink Ralphs and Versace blue jeans on me
I told my cuzzy ""don't worry, I got P's on me""
We fuck club up, then flee the scene
Drive two Mercs off the floor, me and Bashy in the dealership
All black, all facts, man didn't even leak the shit
Big man ting, it's a big man ting
If you grip my tings, it's a hitman ting
I don't leave my crib if there ain't chicks and ting
And man don't even touch road if it ain't wristband ting

Round here's so crazy
See shadows move shady
Been through the dark to the daylight

Always spending, never stunting though
The stunting shit will stunt your growth
The whole hood got love for me
For never frontin', no fakin', no fuckeries
Hail up my brothers, but they need a compass
We're tryna navigate out of this concrete jungle
If I don't see you at the other side?
Same 831 number bro, you still can dial
Still higher power fearing though
No religion, just the realest soul
When I step out in my Stans
Beg you 'low it big man, bad energies fi cross the road
Move bitch, don't be ludicrous
S-class, I'm so used to this
Chest nah rock a Cuban link
Puff cigars with Rich, he got the Cuban link
Fly to Bilbao for lunch
Back by the evening, that's what grafters do when we're up
Low key 'cause I'm in the cut
But talk tough then your Mudda haffi suck rudeboy
Don Peri out of paper cups
Can't take the Manor out of us
We take the Mandem out with us
And...

Overdose off the ovation (

Make a stand for the whole nation (

Dressing room like the Old Bailey (

101 dargs (
But who cares

Dry cry even tears

Knock your door, and take your money like a donation (
Even my heart cry, but who cares

But why they think that was the morals we was all raised with?
Screwface can’t save faces (

They only saving graces
At least it was saving papers (

But there ain't no safe haven
If they can spray paint ""Nigga"" (

That means a black card (

If you ain't got above 80, don't worry what my rate is
You ain’t fucking got the faintest (

Man, don't show off just to show the mandem they can make it
Coming from the city where the slipperiest of snakes live (

A village has to raise these
Young kings and queens to believe their greatness
Fed up of police stations (

I be paradin' 'cause while I be mistaken just 'cause I be debated
While these sly pedos raping (

Brogues and a big boy black suit and a gangster platoon

We've complained to the police about the police and nothing's been done
We've complained to judges about judges and nothing's been done

The weak won't last

Free Years Later,Hoodies All Summer,2019.0,"Glass half empty
Waking from dreams, chasing my fears
I ain't never cried so much tears in all these years
Success brings more stress, my vision's clear
But from when I was 2020 my mother weren't in arrears
Big S class, leather chairs, I'm in the rear
Driver don't stop at all, but Buju blares
Makin' dough but my bro's having a mare
But as soon as bread bakes, it breaks my brothers, bless
I would keep him in my prayers but I don't pray
I put my hands together but it's more like Birdman these days
I ain't ever wayne'd a brudda, that's a major uh-uh
I ain't ever take another from a native brother
I swear had a conversation with Claire, the realest, yeah
It's funny how you don't know they're there until they're there
Hope that touring ain't takin' too much toll on the kids
But your fella, that's a real good fella, I need him there
Tryna take the clique legit and not to bait West End clubs
'Cause playing roulette with the roads
The odds are stacked against us
Anyway, tempt fate not by who says luck will share
Can't keep leaving the yard breaking a leg
Cotch and Pop ciroc on the block with Jus D
Kai got youts on lock will set speed
Love, that's a dangerous thing
You pinch me? Hymn sheet
And a cheap black suit for them chiefs
You gotta know the levels
You gotta know the kettles
You gotta know the factory settings from the frozen bezels
Yeah, I know the curry goat just like I know Sarandos
But you gotta know the roasted cod set on a bed of lentils, huh
Long nights, cold white wine, that's Sancerre
Eye contact with the cheers, that's young stare
Rare rapper, no compare with no breh
No pen, no comment with no fed
Dreamt of Monte Carlo, blow a likkle hard dough
I just blew your little Prada's on some fifth to na notes
I ain't never been a Pablo, I been working hard bro
We need to stop the two-tone Cartiers at mummy's yard though
I know road man, used to diss a man for leasing cars, no
If it don't appreciate the value that we nah own
Used to be a Barksdale man, but now I fuck with Marlo
You can't fuck with my throne you likkle fucking arsehole
'Cause I'm royal

And I be getting so much money on the road
Rich, think I need a pay cut
'Cause some Babylon boy wan' cuff me in the streets and lock me in a station
I heard that it cost to be the boss, guess I'm lucky that I'm bludclart James'd up
Patterned that from day dot, middle finger raised up, fuck you little haters yeah

Babylon boy, look how they raided Stormzy
This is Cristal, not a case of 40's
The don't wanna see us off estates with all these
Young, rich Morley's, still eatin' Morley's
They want more camels and less gordies
I just turned down a hundred G, bossy
Whip too much raunchy too much saucy
Vroom, vroom, vrooming up the A40
Pussy telling porkies, tried to assault me
Musta been a big plot to extort me
Now the prosecution wanna crown court me
Might have to sit down but I'ma stand tall G
I create history, they try to diss Storvy
Grade for the credit but they six foot me
Rather that than graves for the chains and some shit jewellery
Only my guys and flies on the wall
Can tell the kid's story this probably
Last track he got the Richard Mille
Now, thingy just got guilty for the thingy
Heart fucking bleeds for the kiddy
Anything he needs, it's no biggie
Mandem know I do it for the city, that's an understatement
Paying me the utmost respect, that's still an underpayment
Whisper all my props in my ear, it's never public ain't it
Fuck your greatest, how many times must I hush the haters?
Tell us something 'bout our music now, oh, you so proud
Lethal laughing to the Coutts account, now you approve of Pow
Never had a silver spoon in mouth, now mummy's super proud
Couple new trophies for the house that I could do without

On my shoulder like I ain't a soldier in this rarse ting, crarses
Left a boy alone, forget some pussy and some plantain
'Cause of the sweet colour of our skin
They wan throw banana skins at John Barnes's
They tell us to go fuckin' back to our own country
But they won't even give us back our own countries
Every entrance to a door, has a footprint left by the ones that came before
Lets talk about the day the wind was rushed up on the shore
They promised us so much and then they left us to be poor
Need superhero capes for the stuff our mum's had to endure
Just heading to the store, no blacks, no Irish and no dogs
The system's taking course and the most powerful are fraud
They trap us in estates, won't even educate us boys
And wonder why we break the law

This ain't for the club, it's for the mandem on the curb

We bring light but darkness follows
So we cry then laugh tomorrow
Dry your puddles
Mic in the basement
Had a voice then we pirate the station
No choice but to fly in the face of
Bias and hatred
Grindin away til 9 for the pay checks
Mindful, the game is spiteful and heinous
But my generation, times are a changing
Die if I cave in, trying our patience
Lying so blatant, gentrifying our places
But minds are awakening, tightening up laces
To fight in the AM
But at night, we're raving
At night, we're out raving
Ice on the brain ting
Rewind, come again ting
Fire is blazing, rewind come again ting

Strangers,Made in the Manor,2016.0,"It was KD crew, yeah, Kane and Dean
East Ham, Plaistow, with Maxwell Leyton dreams
You were one of the first to make me believe in my first 16s
But did the heights I reached jeopardise the dial and speak
But we go back since manor and ride-on-the-play scheme
District coach, one Walkman, one ear each
Napier Road, Black Pitch
One-day travel cards and Fat Chaps chips
We toured the country, took it overseas
Took it from the streets to The Streets
And if someone was in your ear
Just know my intentions was clear
I was helping us all, we
I made sure we was all there
It's kind of hard when you're the face of it
Was you jealous of my fame a bit?
Funny thing is, I don't even want these questions answered
I just wanna have a brandy and a laugh regardless
Instead of acting like we're strangers, yeah

Seven years ago was Shane's little one's christening
AB was there tryna put to bed all the bickering
He made a phone call to you in the toilets
Said ""someone wants to speak"", gave me the phone to my annoyance
I said ""hello?"", you must've heard my voice and hung up
I just heard the phone cut out and picked my rum up
And hit the dancefloor to some Mavado, finger gun up
Water off a duck's back, but truth be told, that hurt, my brother
What dem a do? What dem a try?
To make our friendship fly into the sky
I said in ""Celebrate"" that I ain't even met your kids
A falling out has made us look a fool for this
I can't pinpoint where the problem started at
Who's to blame or who should even claim half of that
If it's stubborn competition, we both win
So who would just pick up the phone?
Could even if we grew apart, we're still a partnership
So why we acting like we're strangers?
Why we acting like we're strangers?
Oh boy, we ain't strangers

I wrote those first two verses last year, last year
Then the other day, was raving in west end and I see you there
I see you there, bredrin, I see you there, yeah
And we didn't have that brandy but we laughed
Plus we drank some vodka and a half
Oi, if you're hugging mate but wearing all-black, is that still gangster?
Gangster or not, that's my damn darg
And things were back to normal for one night, that's enough
Just to let us know there's no grudge, it's all love
But we all carry scars, we're all cut, we're grown ups
Teenage no more, we're older, we've grown up
But the next day got me thinking what if I was the reason?
Or if the tables turned, whether I would be seated
Or if your battery died that night at that christening
And I thought you disrespected, what if it was just reception?
So the straw that broke the camel's back of this friendship
Maybe it wasn't the intention, but would symbolise the ending
Now, what if you thought I hung up
And for seven years, you've been hung up on the same shit that I was
I guess we'll never know, it's pointless digging deeper holes
Cause if we go down that road, these burnt bridges charge tolls
So I'd rather bromanticise about these things
And write a song about what-ifs, cause I could never write no diss
Cause that's my brother
That's my brother
So bruv, why we acting like we're strangers?
Why we acting like we're strangers?
Fumbling, we ain't strangers

Brown Eyes,Home Sweet Home,2005.0,"Real, it's real life
Feel me, Kano

I love to make love
I love it when you wear them things that I like and they slide down your thighs
Everything seems alright
I love it when you put your back on my front and my tings come alive
I got a thing for them eyes, them pretty brown eyes
And them city guys look back when they see us walk by
When I see you smile It's not that, cos me and you are tight
And its been a while since we reacted and acted wild
But I love the fact that you trust me too
No other girls done it so it must be you
Boys will be boys and yeah I get blusky too
But I try my best to think of you
I love the fact that you tell me anything and everything
I need to know If your girlfriend's boyfriend's boys have got dough
When your best friend's telling you ""fuck that Kano""
I'm telling you shes bad-minded, jealous, I'll tell her for you
I won't get violent but I know were tight
I love it when you go silent when you know I'm right
See the position I'm in people talk, don't listen
They see you and wanna be in your position
And every boys wishing that it could be them and you
So I depend on you to keep them wishing
Listen to me I lo... I like you...
Ain't nobody above, just me beside you see

But I don't wanna fall in love
Nah, I don't wanna fall in love
But your brown eyes have got me hypnotised
Maybe we could give it a try
But I don't wanna fall in love
Nah, I don't wanna fall in love
Can't be? I don't wanna fall in love
But your brown eyes have got me hypnotised
Maybe we could give it a try
But I don't wanna fall in love

It's not official but your mine and you know it
So when boys move to you, you move away in no time
I love that you understand sometimes I got no time
And you don't make me choose between you and studio time
I couldn't cope with you gone, I love your phone calls
It's only cool for you to call me when Eastenders is on
I don't tend to be wrong, but are you right for me?
Would you link me after the show and stay up all night for me?
You want me to be faithful and I want you to be, let's meet in the middle 
Truthfully, I think how beautiful our youths can be
It used to be about your face and your body now
Now I love to be with you, cos chilling with you's like my hobby
I can see me living with you, no time soon
But imagine me and you shopping with a baby in the trolley
But maybe if we fall in love too young we'll get bored
Remember life begins at 40 and by 30 we'll be acting naughty
But if we don't it might come back to haunt me
But if you hurt me then I'll have to hurt you
Then if I hurt you will you desert me?
But it should be you and me sitting in a tree k-i-s-s-i-n-g...

But I don't wanna fall in love
Nah man, I don't wanna fall in love
But your brown eyes have got me hypnotized
Maybe we could give it a try
But I don't wanna fall in love
But I don't wanna fall in love
Nah, I don't wanna fall in love
But your brown eyes have got me hypnotized
Maybe we could give it a try
But I don't wanna fall in love
Nah, I don't wanna fall in love
Can't be? I don't wanna fall in love
But your brown eyes have got me hypnotised
Maybe we could give it a try
But I don't wanna fall in love
I don't wanna fall in love
I don't wanna fall in love
But your brown eyes have got me hypnotised
Maybe we could give it a try
But I don't wanna fall in love
Nah, I don't wanna fall in love
Can't be? I don't wanna fall in love
But your brown eyes have got me hypnotised
Maybe we could give it a try

Good Youtes Walk Amongst Evil,Hoodies All Summer,2019.0,"We're doing this for money

Live  and direct from the belly of the beast
Where  we pour out Henny for deceased
Numbers don't lie, give a penny for the guy
But they won't give a penny to the streets
Melee,  gun, repeat, their limits are machines
When  they should've been revellin' their teens
Where privileged kids got a semi in their jeans
These  kids got a semi in their jeans
Mad to believe, this what our streets have come to
Warfare with nowhere to run to
But all is fair, these cunts don't love you
That's  why I stay with a quick 16 on me
Nobody can take these 16's from me
Make my paper and tuck that properly
Pay my taxes and fuck those bobbies
Trust nobody
I ain't meeting no suits in lobbies
I ain't smoking no zoots with donny
I ain't handing out man no brollies
When I rain on all of these wallies
Bare bodies
You could have a bear's body, don't dare cross me
Life of a lyricist in the times that we're living in
Gotta speak mind of the bigger things
Shine is irrelevant, the grind is imperative
Gotta put pride over millions
Stride what the vision is, never lie to the listeners
Don't hype on the innocent
And when the pie is a billion, slice it and divvy it
That's my hustle

Pile up figures

Work so hard

We're dying for a living

For clothes and the cars

Welcome to my city

Say it loud
Word to the brother brown
Better know I'm black and I'm proud
If we're talking 'bout P's better know I'm mashing it down
Without bagging ounce
Rappers always thinking that the top looks better down
But the top looks better crowned, Kings and Queens of this shit
Mansa Musa for real inna dis
Good youts walk amongst evil and win
Man like Cyrille Regis and dem, better squeeze one from him (Brah)
Squeeze one again (Brah), squeeze one for Ace
Squeeze one for Stormin, soldiers that sleep with the pen
Real spitters like us bleed through the ink
Man lack guidance
Man heard my man just now run up on my man
Point on dialogue, just backed out and start firing
The ends is wilin', the feds try silence
But we ain't shucking and jiving
Master of ceremonies
If it wasn't for the mic and the Mikey's, man would have really sold keys
Cah man know many Nino's and man know hella Tony's
We only respect that man if he never told on a co-d

The ends so sticky 
(Everyday)
On my Nan's road 
(Everyday)
They fire 4 fizzy's

One day she opened the door

To empty shells on the floor

Trouser crease

Another rest in peace

Welcome to my city

Now the brothers moving so divided
We used to link up at McD's, alie Reg?
Pie and ice cream
Convoy to Ray's without no licence
I flow the nicest
Light up mic, they wind down, Five Tens but I digress
Slave to my morals
But when you got no faith in the system, hungry today, fuck tomorrow
Why would you listen to bigger my AMG and not 180 G's
Raise some hell, buy some YSL

I can't blame you for this shit, the games fucking rigged
But something's gotta give

Little Sis,Made in the Manor,2016.0,"Yo, yo, I don't know where to start with this
If being fatherless
Means no gift under trees, fuck it and plant the shit
Still got a tick on my feet, mothers are hustlers
But pushing little sis on the swing's a box I'd rather tick
Ramping with my niece
Makes me think about the sis that I never see
'Member the day you was introduced to me and Lee
You won't remember it, you was only two or three
You had your hair in twists, pretty little sunshine
Dropped you off just one time
Then we didn't ever see you again, was it the Choc Ice?
But maybe Dad's no longer with Mum, Jamaican bloodline
But I feel responsible cause I could've reached out just one time
Now I wonder if you know who I am
I wonder if you tell your friends that we're fam
I wonder if you're listening to this
Even though you must've grown all big

This one's for my little sis
This one's for my little sis

So many landmarks missed
13, 16, 18, landmarks missed
For all I know, you've got a kid that Uncle Kane can't gift
Tiny baby Stan Smiths, ah, now they match my creps
You could all be married now and I didn't give no speech
No, not that speech, the De Niro speech
You know where the groom goes in a headlock in the hotel suite?
You're in the circle of trust, best treat she like queen
Family trees and olive branches
Or maybe we'll next meet when Daddy passes
See you there
I'll be in my funeral suit and Jeffery West
But maybe you've been thinking for years to send a text
But I get if you don't wanna come across like you're begging friend
Some girl rolled up to me at Lovebox, said she knows my sis
I said ""nah, love, I ain't got no-"" shit, how could I forget little sis?

So this one's for my little sis
This one's for my little sis
This one's for my little sis",https://genius.com/Kano-little-sis-lyrics
Drinking in the West End,Made in the Manor,2016.0,"Everybody on trend
Me?
Oversized T with Moschino’s on
And my Stan Smiths white like a Colgate grin
Jeans on my waist, I'm too grown up
Can't wear that low like the yute mandem
Tonight we're going out the ends
That's all you wanna do when you're in the ends
But tonight it's on
Hermet Road barber shop
0.5 and a little blend, sun raise
No shades, nothing comes between me and my city
Smithy, you on it?
Went east, Forest Gate, 
fish inna porridge
Then hit 
Bond Street
, quick bit of shopping
Shutdown for BET'o's, still I might mosh it
Might do mojitos or I Courvois it
London girls with your sunbeam on 'em
Windows down, let the sea breathe on me
Down the Embankment, 
skyline sick
Exit the manor through 
the limehouse link
How it feels good to be in the ends

But tonight, we're drinking in the west end

Live for the weekend
Then it's Monday blues
But tonight got a rouge
Pair of dancing shoes to paint the town red
Jägerbombs, I've had 10
Turnt up, came down
Woke up, same shit all over again
We d-d-d-doing it again!
Yeah, table again
Pants pulled down and the minimum spent
Sparklers and pretentiousness
Must be gold cause these girls keep digging
Love the life but I've got my limits
Welcome to 
the big smoke
Where we pop bottles and we don't vote
Alcohol in my system
Now the courage is all liquid
Bright lights and slurred speeches
High heels and rich kids
Edgware Road, lamb shawarma
Then taxi back to that realness
Last night , we got so high
We were dancing round on that ceiling
This morning, PG Tips
Nurofen and some biscuits
Might kiss and make up
Flick through pics and re-live it

Tonight, we're drinking in the west end

 
iPhone tells its own story
And that last freeze frame action scene won't even cover me in glory
When I jumped on that waitress' back
And we were getting quite rowdy
And I probably insulted 
the whole cast of TOWIE
Shut up
More drinks and less stress
More skin and less dress
Fake tan and mandy
Selfies and Rolexes
Cut eye from that guy
Like oh, look, I bench press
Well done mate, you look hard in that tight red vest
Group shots and we look so happy together
Paper and scissors and stones, see who next hit
Someone was bound to get thrown out the exit
One goes, we all go, unless it's EZ's set
Classic nights when best friends loose all inhibitions
And a story to tell when you drink in the west end

Tonight, we're drinking in the west end
Tonight, we're drinking in the west end
We're drinking in the west end",https://genius.com/Kano-drinking-in-the-west-end-lyrics
"Got My Brandy, Got My Beats",Hoodies All Summer,2019.0,"Sad times we're living in, a minute's silence yet again
Life is on the brink, all mine is in the ink
This was supposed to be for her, but I think it's more for me
Yeah, I got my brandy, got my beats
But I'm still flawed, tryna find my 
feat
Can't shake this hurt inside of me, hurting silently
Reach over to your pillow, cold enough to freeze
These walls keep memories, sworn to secrecy
They've seen us happy as can be
But how happy can we be?
They say good things don't last forever
How much further can you see?
Falls to confront my thoughts
No fight inside of me
Just dry cries inside of me 'til they find their way to cheeks
Gold Rolex on my wrist, but I'm 
balling
 as we speak
Falling in too deep, water's drowning me
And my sorrows they can swim, but is there more fish in the sea?
But don't be sad for me
Still got my brandy, got my beats
I just know that I lost my best friend
And I lost a piece of me

Silence speaks so loud
Tryna drown it out
In this room full of emptiness
'Cause we've been holding on too each other
Now with the space I need
I cry another tear that you won't see

So many lessons in love can't be taught without the breaking of hearts
Without a stain on her trust, I still feel the pain in her hug
And just when you think you're moving on, you do shots to forget you F'd this up
That's when I opened up the cupboard, and see the ""S"" on your cup
Guess I best hit the club, loosen up
Grab a becks or a bumper, choose one
So crowded is the dance floor
But full of emptiness and red bottoms, West got 'em
All floss with more money and less problems
Can't find the real ones from imposters
Can't find the real love in these lock in's
Can't find the right words in these vodkas
Can't find my feet, now I look lost in this place
Are we supposed to be shocking?
So out of touch, play the back, watching
Tune's spinning but when's the beat dropping?
Man
I miss bringing my sound to this beach
To build a castle fit for a queen
Who now one finger skanks without me

Silence speaks so loud
Tryna drown it out
In this room full of emptiness
'Cause we've been holding on too each other
Now with the space I need
I cry another tear that you won't see",https://genius.com/Kano-got-my-brandy-got-my-beats-lyrics

Target gunshot it up like sniper

Don’t make me take it old skool on some RUN DMC shit
Pum pum, yeah nigga beat it
So wet make nigga a sea sick

Money ain't a thang

Brain usage slow thinkers, amongst the fastest
I’m elusive, but I’m here amongst the masters
Sweet tooth so firstly I'll be munching afters
I do it full hearted, I ain’t down with halfers
You will lose your soul tryna copy artists
This ain't 2-4, so they the ain't the hardest
Them spitters are like furniture, they might need a varnish
Some are like salad without the garnish
I ain't gonna hoist them up like a harness
Leave em down
I’m a G, star, what am I gonna feed em now
(Why?) Said they were cool before
I said no then, I don’t believe em now, wanna talk like there’s a new G in town
I told em I see the c﻿ in clown
But I sure can't see a new G in town
And a whole decade of music consistent
That’s why I put the “c” in crown (crown)
I put the “c” in crown
Wanna test? Then you’ll see me around
No soundboy can test wid da barrin'

Music is my first girl, but she don’t mind when I’m sleepin' around

I remember when he had crackers, bulla bread
And mummy had to scrape cheddar
Now in December, I can make it mayweather
I tell her take a cheap shot like mayweather
And I ain't a cheap shot at mayweather
I told her bend down, I'm a straight fella
See I can get serious but I play better
You know me, I put on for my city
Cause they throw me dirty money and I turn it to Diddy
Clean as a whistle
Blowing through the ends
Traktor just bought wretch a Mercedes Benz
This verse ain't a threat
I'm ready for anything
This year I've been nominated for everything
Hence why I ain't giving out no wedding rings
You married music, nigga, I'm selling it
Now I take better trips
I'm on the beach with an ice cream seeing jellyfish

I put on for my pussy-clart city
No pussy can't see me
All these man are mini-me's
No pussy can't be me
Why? I rep my city right
Rest In Peace, Mike, carr, it's fucking Thriller time
Popping bottles like it's mother fucking Miller time

Some of my dogs, them are killers but I'm just living life

Trouble,Hoodies All Summer,2019.0,"The young people have begun the rebellion, refusing to work. They have received very little support from other sections of the population. As a consequence of which, they must find money by these means
We say we are against those means. Not because we are moralists, not because we are religious freaks, but precisely because mugging involves loss of life and liberty, and a continuing attack upon that section of the black community; police brutality, prison brutality and a full wastage of human creativity. That is why we are against it

Politician, hush don't make a sound
Been oppressing us, couple centuries now
And these gunshots never reach your town
It's never on top when you leave your house
But when we go southerns
We might run into some beef or somethin'
Rambo tucked into the jeans or somethin'
But the beef, please drop it 'cause it don't make money

All our mothers worry when we touch the road
'Cause they know it's touch and go whether we're coming home
And either that's for shit that could happen to us
Or the shit we might do if you violate the code
It's turning over new leaf times
Moschino jeans full of peace signs
Postcode warring, that's the thing now
Young bucks beefing over street signs
You ever seen a mother tears run down Gucci glasses?
The imagery will hit you deep and cut through the hard shit
The hood potential not reached due to gun barking
It's bad business for the ends man, I'm done talkin'
It's all fun keeping score when it's one-nothing
Til loved ones get duppied inside a nine nights
Any beef can be squashed if hands could be shaken
Any hand can be shaken when the blood dries
I guess that's not a thug line
But Canning Town and Plaistow, that's where the thugs die
Where the slugs fly, then the doves fly
And if you say you like beef, then you thugs lyin'
These are my words to us, no tongue tyin'
If you stay up ridin', til the sun's risin'
And you're just tryin' to get one, or get bunned tryin'?
Then we ain't on the same side of this sterling linin'

Politician, hush don't make a...

Female scream
Trouble, Trouble
Yeah, no I hear you. Oh my God. I can see one of them on the floor
Police Sirens blare
He's on the floor and he's got a knife wound. And I can see a man
Holding a knife
He must be about 16 or 17
Police Sirens continue, intensify then abruptly stop

Trouble, Trouble
I don't need no trouble
Trouble
We don't want no trouble

I know some youngers that will beef on the Main road
Violate the clique and then the K go
They will off a brother on my say so
But when they're given 30 could I look mum in the face though? (NO!)
Concrete roses, they really grow shit, you see my whole set
Don't watch the Rolex, just watch the progress
From mopeds, coke heads and the old Ghetts
15 with a dream, 20 with a gold disk
21, second crib before I got my own whip
27, 28 and 9 was my lowest
30 reupped again, 32, more checks
So why would I throw away life for some jokers?
Hopeless
Ain't blocks with no Lopez
Opps in the Focus
I know the roads, yes but when the goal's bread, it makes no sense
Less condolences and more congratulations
Brought a smile to my face, I heard that Sammy's trading
And K just had a baby, D's an uncle ain't he?
Just got off the phone with Shane, he's investing major gravy
Ghetts ain't looked back since we blessed them stages
Now man are stepping on planes with our bredrin Aidan
Still conflicted 'cause man'll bust gun on Netflix
But I show you both sides of the fence
, watch out for 
splinters
Rats
 and sinners
Gangsters, killers
With straps and ringers
Tax and figures, your stash was dinner
Agh!
My only obligation is - give inspiration
This the winners table and here's your invitation
No sparklers over 'ere and all the women taken
We just pop bubbles, pour doubles, we want no trouble
Whine two gyal, we want no trouble
A spend 3 grand, we want no trouble
4 more bottles, we want no trouble
Don't mean we're scared of nobody
Life's just too short for the bullshit man

Politician, hush don't make a sound

Seashells in the East,Made in the Manor,2016.0,"Good heart, bad breed
Living in the ill manor but we're no Plan B
Mummy got Christ, Daddy got a vice, not surprised
He ain't tryna follow no pipe dreams
Nature or nurture is destiny, real
If this estate had lakes and green fields
And he went Eton and Oxford too
Would monkey see, monkey do like you?
Fine line between obstacles and excuses
But a thick skin will still bump and bruise
And when you need them blue kickers and new creps
Special brew, won't get you dressed for school

You won't find seashells in East End
But you might see shells in East End
There ain't no pier or no rock here
But most of your peers will sell rocks here
Survival instinct's a must
You hug that road, but road don't show love
Leave that place before you get stuck
Can't wait till your wake before you wake up

This place ain't changed
(There's still a war going on inside of a defeater's mind)
This place ain't changed
(A man's home is his castle, but freedom lives outside)
Winners and losers
(Yep, the manor's a no-go, T-shirt weather but mandem are so cold)
Is it better?
(Out here to out here)

We came up in the same ends
Bought sweets with the same pence
Pot luck, or was I god-blessed?
If I couldn't rap, would I be in the same mess?
Postcode, blame the postcode
But a strong mind's like a vacation
The power of escapism
If you ain't dreaming, then you ain't living
Fork in the road, which way'd you wanna go?
Trust me, bruv, I know the ropes, gotta make a plan though
But you're in too deep, gotta keep your fam afloat
And just cause we don't speak, don't mean I wanna see you go
And you can blame me, but that's eating up a hole
Now your sister's on the phone, me and Smithy had to go
To your hospital bed, with the tumour up in your nose
It was really touch and go while I was there
Where was the ends then?

You won't find seashells in East End
But you might see shells in East End
There ain't no pier or no rock here
But most of your peers will sell rocks here
Survival instinct's a must
You hug that road, but road don't show love
Leave that place before you get stuck
Can't wait till your wake before you wake up

This place ain't changed
(There's still a war going on inside of a defeater's mind)
This place ain't changed
(A man's home is his castle, but freedom lives outside)
Winners and losers
(Yep, the manor's a no-go, T-shirt weather but mandem are so cold)
Is it better?
(Out here to out here)

The manor
Invisible walls that never fall
Learn to climb before you crawl
Don't get stuck here
Man-made or mind-made?
Don't be a statistic, blaming ghetto physics for holding you back
Eternal strength versus external influences
Victim or victor?
The manor
Concreted souls
Cheek by jowl with suits and industry folk
We share the same roads but not the same code
Low self-esteemers, Mercs and Beemers
Small winners
It-is-what-it-is-ers
But you deserve more
The manor
Throwing bricks at glass ceilings
Do or die
He who dreams with open eyes is alive

This place ain't changed
(There's still a war going on inside of a defeater's mind)
This place ain't changed
(A man's home is his castle, but freedom lives outside)
Winners and losers
(Yep, the manor's a no-go, T-shirt weather but mandem are so cold)
Is it better?

London Town,London Town,2007.0,"Yo Yo Yo

It's still K A niggas
, straight cave niggas
Spray like K and you'll make great figures
You ain't even fuckin with my mix tape niggas
Like Jerome Thomas with the Bathing Apes
Like Beckham with the ladies
, Playing till I get mine
Wife and kids like Damon Wayans
K behave nah they love me
And at the shows they scream fuck me fuck me
Then I say ladies make some noise
Rob niggas like baby boy,but take the ladies
I am lazy with the flow, latest with the clothes
I ain't Jay Z with the doe,but am faded on the road
Niggas know what I'm like, flow how I fight
Punch line old school, roll with my mic
Spray like a cobra
And ill make niggas hold up dem foot and jump like it's over

I'm from London,London,London Town
You can toughen up or get thrown around
You can get 1 3 5 a ounce
Let me tell you how its going down
Niggas bust shots like everyday
Tryna' make money in every way
In London,London,London Town
We hustle coz the struggle ain't over now

It sounds like grime, but a little slower
I'm a lot wiser, a little older
Still street wise, C.I.T.Y You can see why
These guys on street might recite these rhymes
I act like I'm never sober, and I never lie low
I buy up the bar everytime I rave with Byo
Fuck that bullshit, and yes I'm on the dance floor
Fuck that cool shit... ooooo
They so tugged out and They dance
Side to side yeah thats the champagne dance
Let me show you what my lifes like
Raving on for five nights
Waking up to receipts that make you doubt your eyesight
You might think I'm sweet like roses
But I'm the rest of the rose
I've been getting myself in drama ever since them eskimos
Flows im blessed with those
Shows I'm blessing those
Road I'm less involved
Doe I guess you know
Ho's I'm F'ing those
I don't really Rude boy, don't be silly
Put sum rubber pon de da willy
Back cos', Po Po said I'm in the clear
So put some gun fire inna di airrr

I'm from London,London,London Town
You can toughen up or get thrown around
You can get 1 3 5 a ounce
Let me tell you how its going down
Niggas bust shots like everyday
Tryna' make money in every way
In London,London,London Town
We hustle coz the struggle ain't over now

I said take a look around, it's run down
You see them little Youths got guns
Welcome to London
Welcome to London town and
You know how we get down and
Niggas from London we dont fuck around
Welcome to London town and
You know how we get down and
Niggas from London we dont fuck around

Say my name like Mike Jones
I don't know about you but I know
That i've blown like muscles in the west
Topless like ladies breasts
I know I'm killin them
Every flows so brilliant
But about first act on the stage
I'm back in a rave
I'm back in the studio, back in the days
A slap in the face, just for the press

Alien,Not 4 The A List,2011.0,"They act like they﻿ are going to bust something from out their waist
But those men are wasteman
They say they act like they are going to bust something from out their waist
But those men are wasteman
And they move like they are gyal dem and they flex like they are something
They can't weigh me down and no they can't tell me nothing
Because I'm too far gone they can't see me I'm out in space, yes I am an alien

MJ gimmie that beat like came from the po-po
Maybe that bar was a no-no
But I'll stop giving a fuck about
10 minutes after the MOBO's
But anyway fuck it I'm a boss, OJO
So I tell a bitch back off, Coco
Us man'a flow like futuristic
You man are bussin' that old flow
You niggers Usain Bolt(ing)
Us niggers got that cold flow
You man are wearing Avirex
Us man are wearing polo
When you man are wearing polo's
Us man have got them grown clothes
Suit Jacket, shoes matching
Daytona, Yeah Rose Gold
And way before hearing Otis
I was rocking that Hublot
""Did Ie say I'm a boss like Hugo?""
'Cos that means a whole lot of loot bro
And your chicks in my head, Jason Derulo
Yeah I got bars
Custom suit bitch
Yeah I got class
And this won't chart
'Cos yeah it ain't chance
You can act road but yeah I got cars
Vrooooom
Yeah I got that Porsche nigga
And I rev it in auto
And I paid that cash nigga
No direct debit no sort code
Lot of my bars be ???
Next flow this one left for you
I ain't even been mainstream
Still waters running flows red canoes
Lately I see a lot of new niggers
Yes them niggers I call clones
But I got big up Wretch and that
Maxtsa and Chippy got some cool quotes
Yeah love Dot and Rotten
Top down to the bottom
Pay as you go I'm gone
But they won't be forgotten
But yes I am an industry alien alien
UFO sightings at the video station

They act like they﻿ are going to bust something from out their waist
But those men are wasteman
They say they act like they are going to bust something from out their waist

Because I'm too far gone they can't see me I'm out in space, yes I am an alien

Check it yeah
I'm comfortable
Its been way more than a month or two
I've been writing these lyrics
Now I'm trying to be a star and that
So I can't relax
Kids want to stop comms when I'm in their town
You better simmer down
Young Max boiling up
Straight grown up we ain’t got boys with us
But couple babies round we got toys with us
And them original flows. Real McCoy with us
Critics ain’t sure if the boy can bust
A nuh nothin', it’s a minor. I’m live-er than Kim Kardsh up in the Chrysler
A reminder, I’ve spun so many MC’s before
This verse is another bit of grief to cause
I’ll beat your broad, send kids an go tell him, “Here’s a one-way ticket, go sleep abroad""
Forget sleeping on me, what you sleepin' for?
Watch how niggas from East record their own Mikey
I feel like Kane up on Layer Cake, fed up with all this shit so I stay awake
And plus yattys are stress, I’m like nah
I’m trying to say goodbye, I Macy Gray them
Fuck the industry, we’re the new Jay and Kan
You watch the throne, you’re like Wayne and Drake
Plus, I got my Ray Bans. Don’t player hate
Black creps, black BlackBerry Bold
In the back of a black cabbie, and my battery’s low
I’m on the road with no sign of sanity bro. No calamity though, I roll calm
Hail up the ends, cos they know wa'gwan. You don’t know wa'gwan
You’re boring, your flow nah gwan, cuzzy
Never scared of a challenge, I got heart, trust me
You’re spittin' bars, but we got art

They act like they﻿ are going to bust something from out their waist
But those men are wasteman
They say they act like they are going to bust something from out their waist
But those men are wasteman
And they move like they are gyal dem and they flex like they are something
They can't weigh me down and no they can't tell me nothing
Because I'm too far gone they can't see me I'm out in space, yes I am an alien

Best in the game and I put that on everything
Salt and Pepper flow
And I've got rudeboy beats them are sweet like gelatine
I’m married to the game put that on any ring any finger
Anything other than moneys a setback
The game can't short change me 'cos I checked that
Max spit… get that, roger that, …
Red light monster …
Porn shop ...,
It’s over …same shit no hams
It’s magical how we get on stage and spit

Layer Cake,Kano Mixtape,2007.0,"You're born; you take shit
Get out in the world; you take more shit
Climb a little higher; take less shit
Til one day you're up in the rarefied atmosphere, and you've forgotten what shit even looks like
Welcome to the layer cake, son

Check, check Check Check
I’m two albums deep a thousand shows in
Cause I fight for the right til the towel gets thrown in
We hustle down here, knuckles 'round here
Never stays pretty when you're raised in the city
It's a place full of hatred where they wanna stick me
Cause I'm making my statments and they think too quickly
I'm a victim to criticism, menace to society
Cause I’m in a position where many do admire me, (huh)
But there's always an obstacle, just move left but the stress ain't optional
It’s all bless but nah, you forget, you've gotta do better you can’t do your best
Crucial how you move cause you'll lose your breath
And this music will follow you to death
Do us part, now you're married to the game
With no footsteps to follow: pave the way
Eh, that's the layer cake, play your position
It's too fucked let me explain how the biz is
Too real, you feel that you're in control but you ain't, you're stuck in the layer cake

The Layer Cake
The Layer Cake
The Layer Cake
The Layer Cake (Welcome to the layer cake son..)

They layer cake's like being stuck in the system
Just for existence to be someone coming up as an infant
We seen it in Scarface, the road to the top the fucking hard way
But you know how the music is, gotta pass a few layers before you get rich
It’s a hustle, gotta struggle just so you can shit gold
And you still owe, that's why they get rich and you get broke
But I'm still writing
It's never gonna stop until you're fucking with a cherry on the top
But I'm still trying
The road think I've blown but I ain't nowhere near the icing
Obviously the radio fears my writing
But my ideas are frightening
So I'm still stuck in the layer cake, taking my chances
They're trying to put me in another box: ""grime artist""
And I'm trying to see the cream in the middle
That's the money I ain't just speaking in riddles
I ain't trying to be part-time dealing a little
Or trying to see hard times, stealing in LIDLs
But things just ain't what they seem, I'm on the grind like banner said
From pirates to mainstream, and still not that ahead
Feel I should knock it on the head
Cause I'm in the industry man, in England
Where I never sell more than an indie band
You don't even wanna know the ins and outs
But let me tell you how it goes down


Layers and Layers of bullshit, the game's fucked up
But you've gotta play it, you can’t pause it
And you can’t forfeit, as an up-and-coming emcee
Trying to bust but your pockets' empty
I work hard, never a night off
Watch ""Fabulous Life of..."" and see all things that I want
But I don’t think UK's ready
My tune's on heavy rotation cause it’s got Mike on
Ever since So Solid dropped, ""21 seconds"", the charts ain't really had anyone reppin'
So can you get to the top of the tops? ""Pow""
#11: still no Top of the Pops. How?
Said I’d probably get nominated
No disrespect to Lamar but I think I should have gone to take it
But fuck this, fuck the Brits, get pissed take the piss out of this Paris Hilton bitch
Cause I don’t belong here
I’ve come a long way it’s been a long year
And I’m so near but yet so far
Climbing the ladder to this rarefied atmosphere...

Speak like a sour boy, what would you rather?
I could be sweet boy and meet your father
I could be sour and leave in a hour
But if sour is what you like then that's still alright
I could be your one-nighter

When I make a mess of things

Deep Blues,Made in the Manor,2016.0,"Now we're fucking rapping for fashion
More infatuated with Ferraris and Astons
I'm not Martin, but crown me the king of just blacking
Out on this disc of plastic
But hidden in these flows is undeniable passion
Never worked a day in my life
, all I know is rap
Life's had bigger submissions but I won't tap
The people's done with the fiction, now they want fact
Go underground, but mind the gap
Trap, trap, trap, now everybody's trapping
And it sounds like trap, trap, trap, trap, trap
'Bout that life, but are you really 'bout it
When them white rocks steal your uncle
And they just won't give him back?
Ain't seen ever, just come out of prison
I just hope that he ain't using but the truth will beg to differ
Life can get really, really real
Life can get really, really real

Very bad news, just found out that my bredrin's mum's got cancer
While I'm online looking at 
back shots of the week
Soph's mum's ill, might need an operation
And I'm online looking at Rolexes, it's not that time
Billy lost a baby, that shit fucking pains me
And all I lost's a gram, popping bottles and a day's sleep
Nanan's husband died, such is life
But white rum, nine night
Money, money, money, that's what the yout man worship
It's the devil and he's working... hard
But karma is a mother, and you can't keep dodging bullets
Lesson learned, suggest you take it and... run
Cause when you're sitting in a cell, just had an altercation
And the victim's in a coma, if he dies, we're going jail
Life just got really, really real
Life just got so fucking real

Alarm snoozed, I'm in a melancholic mood
Last night, we boozed
How am I spending them pinkies and got the blues?
When I'm not hard labouring by eating fruits
Why don't I celebrate wins but hate to lose?
Glass half empty even though it's rosé Krug
And when the shoe's on the other foot
They'll say at least they're spanking new
So without a bruise, you won't see the pain I'm going through
Sometimes, I feel like every day it's Monday blues",https://genius.com/Kano-deep-blues-lyrics
Grime MC,London Town,2007.0,"Intrigued by the beat
Touched by the words
Homework studied every noun every verb
Nerd way before you heard these verses
Used to be so good, so perfect
Intelligent, straight A student
Move in the blazer on through the corridor
Shine every rave and play commodore 64 still
From 4 til 6 on the weekend radios on
Video killed that radio star
Channel U heavy rotation, Sky remote control set as the favourite
Start wearing hoodies, in with the bullies
Like fuck the education face it
I ain’t ever gunna get to drive a Bentley from a degree
So I got to be an MC

Hi I’m the grime MC
I got my jeans down low, hat over the hood like Tinchy
Hi I’m the grime MC
I got my tag in my hat like GH and I got a mixtape it’s called the gime MC
‘Cos that’s what I am, I’m a cliché
Ain’t you seen Base these days
I copy everything I see on TV
It’s easy, I can be a grime MC
Hi I’m the grime MC
I got my jeans down low, hat over the hood like Tinchy
Hi I’m the grime MC
I got my tag in my hat like GH and I got a mixtape it’s called the gime MC
‘Cos that’s what I am, I’m a cliché
Ain’t you seen Base these days
I copy everything I see on TV
It’s easy, I can be a grime MC

Hi I’m the grime MC, I don’t give a fuck
Ignorant but still I don’t give a fuck
Boast about shit that ain’t even cool
When kids close their eyes MC’s pull the wool
But please don’t take me for simple
I ain’t one of these MC’s
Indeed, I shout when I’m angry
Swear when I’m rowdy
I’m top that nigga can’t fuck with my family
2 shots make a nigga drop like Bambi
But I ain’t no fool been schooled by the elders
Full of no rules, and yeah I go school but I don’t wear shoes
16 and I’m a known yute
And all the chicks love me for my vocals
And I’m living a life already just wait till I get my time on tele


Hi I’m the grime MC give me a deal
I know there’s a way so give me a will
And I can make you rich so give me a mill
‘Cos my mixtape’s selling like hotcakes still
I hope I don’t come across arrogant
But the whole of your roster I'm badder than
I'm a hustler I don't need management
And I negotiate quite old fashioned
Does my gun on the table bother you?
Is she coming with my glass of orange juice?
Long story short I ain't Kano or Dizzee
And I can win a MOBO with ??? it's easy
Make niggas go wild when the riddim low
All I need is Crystal in the video
Merc for Dad and 4 for mummy
And we can make loads of money
We can take over the chart with my bars in one week
I just need you to fund me
Man fuck a business card for a trip this far
You'll never hear another nigga spit this hard
Grime till I die
Rhyming I'm fine
But I don't get bookings no more nobody hires
Write till I'm rich
Fight till I'm tired
I don't need no backup plan I'm a survivor
Fuck a record deal dem man are getting ripped off
I'd rather stay underground majors can get lost
I'm keeping it real my pockets empty
But fuck you niggas I'm a Grime MC",https://genius.com/Kano-grime-mc-lyrics
This Is The Girl,London Town,2007.0,"Oh, ohh, oh, ohh, oh, ohh
Ohhhh oh
Oh, ohh, oh, ohh, oh, ohh
This is the girl that I want

Uncomfortable
It's been way more than a month or two
It's deeper than that
I roll with you
So no other chick can come close to you
And deep down I know the truth
Notice you don't like if I come with you
And chicks wanna hug me in front of you
But I don't mean to be rude
I won't find me another one quite like you
I know that we become so close
And I know I'm mostly on tour
With girls backstage after the encore
But I'm down for you, look out for you (down for you, look out for you)
Try my best to be around for you (try my best to be around for you, ohh)
And if you still down then I want you to know
You're the one I want when I'm gone

This is the girl that I want
This is the girl that's gon' make me fall in love (and I ain't even wanna fall in love)
Girl I will ride with you
Give up my life for you
Baby cause girl I've changed (baby I've changed)
And this is the girl that I want

You know how it goes (Oh, ohh)
You know what they say (Oh, ohh)
Old dogs, (Oh, ohh)
New tricks (Ohhhh oh)
Different toilet, (Oh, ohh)
Same shit (Oh, ohh)
Well let me tell you something (Oh, ohh)
(Ohhhh oh)

Look I've been in a club many a times
Been a player - two girls at a time
Been a very bad boy like Shyne (too blind to see what you were doing)
I was involved in close, hiding with a silent ring tone
Like Jude Law in Closer
Relationship rollercoaster (ohhh)
My life, my real life co-star (ohhh)
With no dialouge we couldn't go far (ohhh)
But I'll try and stop
Cause so far well that won't last (too blind to see what you were doing)
I move so fast spin round the track like go-karts
Over and over and over
To a slow stop, I'm so lost
Cause what I couldn't be you wanted me to be (ohhh)
When I couldn't breathe I wanted you to leave (ohhh)
What you couldn't see (ohhh)
Was me in the club with she
Looking like my wife to be
But finally, I've grown up since then
And your eyes opened up since then
And I've changed so let's keep it moving (too blind to see what you were doing)

This is the girl that I want (and I really wanna let you know)
This is the girl that's gon make me fall in love (cause I really wanna fall in love)
Girl I will ride with you
Give up my life for you
Baby cause girl I've changed
And this is the girl that I want
This is the girl that I want (and I really wanna let you know)
Forget 'bout all them other girls before (forget 'bout all them other girls before)
Wanna get involved with you
All them other girls ain't the same
With them played the game
And this is the girl that I want
Oh, ohh (ohh)
Oh, ohh (ohh)
Oh, ohh (ohh) (too blind to see what I was doing)
Ohhhh oh
Oh, ohh (ohh)
Oh, ohh (ohh)
Oh, ohh (uh uh)
Ohhhh oh

Check
On the canopy
My stamina be enough for Angelina Jolie
Actually I had to become a man to be the man you see
And I know your fantasy
A baby and a family with me

Reload It,Home Sweet Home,2005.0,"This is
This is
This is what it means when DJs reload it
This is what it means
When DJs reload it
This is what it means when DJs reload it
Reload it
DJs reload it
DJs
DJs
Reload it
It's Kano in the house

Look, nuff MCs just ain't creative
They just remixed Kano's latest
Get a response and think they're rated
Don't spud and call me cuz, we ain't related
Nuff DJs don't know the basics
Cut a few dubs and think they made it
Played bare raves but they ain't made shit
Listen to Mak and play the same bits
And nuff producers think they've made hits
Sold 500, they ain't made hits
Prick, it's the vocal that makes it
And trying to charge me big dough to take it
Nuff promoters think their rave's big
And kids don't give a shit when their rave is
They're standing up but not raving
They came to the front when Kano came in
Living like K-A blowin' up roads
K-A-N shottin' like O's
I send the mandem out of control
But I got the girls all over my flow
But a lot of people don't know about me
I can spit like an old school MC
A-B-C, One-Two-Three
K-A-N-O lyrical G
You don't believe me? Let me call Lee
Let me call Danger, let me call Dean
They know I'm that lyrical team
And I eat the tracks like edible beans
K-A, I'm a bad boy though
I'm a real bad boy, bad boys know that
You can't fuck with the bad
Bad bda bda bad bad bda bda
Bad boy flow coz

This is what it means when DJs reload it
That sixteen was mean and he knows it
Double gets a lot and Wiley gets a lot of reloads
Tinchy gets nuff and Demon always gets reloads
This is what it means when DJs reload it
That sixteen was mean and he knows it
Ghetto gets a lot and Scratchy gets a lot of reloads
Hyper gets nuff and Lethal always gets reloads

Look, you can't tell me nothing, I ain't havin' it
If I see suttin' I like, fuck it I'm havin' it
And we can go back to back but believe I'll have it up
And the DJ knows it coz that's why he jacks it up, oh, fuck it, back me up
I make love music and I make thugs music
I make club tunes so DJs in the club use it
Windows steamin' up, when the best MCs are teamin' up
We make people say ""brap brap brap brap""
And DJs wheel it up
Yo, K to the A
K to the A to the N to the O
I know that you people already know
I get a reload purely for the flow
Give me that stage and a microphone
A beat and that's my time to glow
I know that the ladies like my flow
They put their number inside my phone

Yo D Double spitting the shit you feel I keep it real
What’s the deal?
I heard you wanna steal my skill
You must not know me still
I get the tune jacked like Jill, badder still
Lyrically 9 mil to the dj’s whi-hall (wheel)
Spin back like windm-ihall (windmill)
My selecta know the di-hall (deal)
Keep it real on the wheels of sti-hall (steel)

Let's play a game called reloads
Let's see who can get the most reloads
Big dances, Demon gets reloads
Sidewinder, yeah, I can get reloads
You don't wanna bring arms house, that's a reload
When I say the gash lyric, I get a reload
Rebore, buss that, yeah, that's a reload
Pissed off 'cause you don't get no reloads

That's a minor
Bun down the rave when I come and quick timer
Got the crowd singin' along like one-liner
Got the right lyrics you know I'm a tight rhymer
Nuff nuff style-a, Ruff like Ryder
Gwan like you're bad and you don't even get a wheel-up
You don't sex no gyal, you only get feel-ups
Get left behind, you MCs need to speed up
Kano will have your whole team up",https://genius.com/Kano-reload-it-lyrics
Mic Check 1-2,Home Sweet Home,2005.0,"I couldn't give a fuck about your reputation
I'm the star from the top like Christmas decorations
And me merking you right now that's my estimation
Dedication plus patience equals elevation
Get your voice on any station
Why you waiting?
Why waste time debating fucking around and raving
Late night time I'm in the studio slaving
8 nights a week too many days in
That's when you see me with a beard fuck shaving
I'm tired of rhyming but I am a
Pain in the backside, your plan backfired
You can look up anyone that's tried
They can't merk me never that, that's right
It's not that season nor that time
I ain't boasting but I am that type
So shut your noise and gimme that mic
Heard the beat and I was like gimme that mic
And I wrote some fucked lyrics that night
I'm on point no falling behind
It's all in the music its all in the mind
What you call it, garage? What you call it, grime?
Call it what you wanna call it, I'm fine
But rhyme-wise I got a short order of mine
Doogz, Dee, Wiley, Ghetto, these have got new flows all the time

Testing mic check 1 2
So-and-so called your name
So what's new - fuck him
Fuck them, fuck you
If they want to clash me I would love to

Hello who is this? Who are you?

There's beef on Deja, it's going off on the roof

Shut up, what now? What crew? What, Nasty?

Nah

Fuck you!

My flows big, big, big I spit hits kid
Big tings rude-boi I'm done with this shit
Quick, quick, quick - the shit click
Click and i'll be like swift put the stick to his ribs
He's rich, rich, rich - take that shit
You win some you lose some son - life is a bitch bitch bitch
Ain't that a bitch?
Oh well, bad luck - piss, piss, piss
I was born to be rich
Santa knows I had money on my Christmas list
And when you get some comes chicks
Then all of your texts end in a kiss, kiss, kiss
Hi - hug kiss, kiss that how they greet me
All because I flow ill like a sickness, I'm a sick kid
But when I spit hot shit im on fire, but I'm a big blitz",https://genius.com/Kano-mic-check-1-2-lyrics
Slaves,Method to the Maadness,2010.0,"We could sit around and talk for days
About all the things that we would change
But we never thought we never thought
That we were the slaves

Ah, Runaway runaway underground deep
Release me from these shackles around feet
Old masters they don't own me
Treat artists like sheep
But they don't know me
Rap star rap star, have you any tunes?
Yes sir yes sir, three disks full
One for the radio and one for the states
And one for my people who live down the lane
Can't fool me born free M.I.A
But kill us over time, Ali Boombaye
Puppets on a string, insignificant
As people we've come a long way
But it ain't that different
Money makes the world go round Dead Presidents
Something like a spoon full of sugar to the medicine
Necessary evil, slave to the sterling
They run the world that we all just work in

We could sit around and talk for days
About all the things that we would change
But we never thought we never thought
That we were the slaves
We could sit around and talk for days
About all the things that we would change
But we never thought we never thought
That we were the slaves

Look, pawns in the game
We don't make the checkmate
Front line of defense
Thats the modern day slave
Used for consumerism so we get pad
And give it straight back the boomerang play
Win-win for them
Come on folk lose-lose
Programmed like robots
Do what we're told too
The whole worlds singing
The same same song but changes ain't making them
Bracelets blinging
Gold chains swinging
Face tattooed up Lil Wayne tear dripping
Still in prison in this world we live in
So wade in the water children
No master
Escapism through music with no capture
Except the moment because I'll be on a Prince Protest
Before I become a slave bro
I'll be the artist formerly known as Kano

After listening to the preacher
It seems that all they ever teach us
Is how to fear and fear it all
Till you fall

We could sit around and talk for days
About all the things that we would change
But we never thought we never thought
That we were the slaves
We could sit around and talk for days
About all the things that we would change
But we never thought we never thought
That we were the slaves",https://genius.com/Kano-slaves-lyrics

Nigga we do this ting

A hunting we will go, a hunting we will go
If we need to find you, then a hunting we will go
Violence I don't promote but if the guns shall get involved
Any violation then a hunting we will go

Dem not ready for the kid, niggas wanna chill
And have a bevvy with the kid
Wanna buss joke like Lenny with the kid
But it can get bad like belly with the kid
Cause a nigga strapped tact heavy with a stick
And cause I'm on telly think I'm a little bitch
You can take shots like it's a free kick
But nigga I'm sick like Pele on a pitch
So it can get messy real quick
Cause they wan' take a yard, when you're giving them an inch
You ain't that hard, you ain't that large
And you ain't in charge, you can get a red card
And you can get touched like it's a massage
And never come back like a sarge in Iraq
You can go missing, nigga no kidding
It's on 'til we find you nigga, no chilling

'Cause It's my time
You know them bad mind from ever since
Everybody know the grudge the youtdem feel intense
You can see me in a club, looking fresh
Couple bottles and a little bit of bling-bling
But if you see me outside you can screw
But rudeboy don't try a ting
Me I'm on a humble ting but the guns will ring
Like Peter crack, believe that it's not a thing
And let's be real you don't wanna feel bullet
It won't be me but a nigga will pull it
Me I'm no G man, you play He-Man
You can get clapped like a Diwali riddim
Dying's never a good look for business
Man I hope Cavalli will fit 'em
I run this house but I'm hardly a Simmons
So you can run your mouth and I'll be the villain
Cause anybody violate anybody now
They'll hunt man down like McGarvey and kill 'em
And you give 'em Sunday like carvery dinners

Find you like Saddam and watch

Convict like Akon
Kano, Ghetto, Stringer Bell and Avon
Ever since free of cells, I've been bringing hell
And cells make me sick so when I'm in one I feel like I've got sickle cell
These days you gotta be careful
Some man go hard like Omar
Yeah I don't buss but don't sing as well
Before I let the feds take me away
I'll cruise the sting like Damian Blake
I bought a machine gun make no mistake
You've already seen when I'm aiming the gauge
So watch how you're talking to me
You won't be talking at all
Talk so much, you talk in your sleep
I just talk with the tool
I'm a war monger, (Ghetts!) I'm a hunger for war
Ca' it affects the older or younger
I be the underground king
That links, I've got shit, my floor under
I make it look easy, like I was getting a whores number
G Star Jeans, G Star Raw jumper
More stress, more ganja
I'm a hunter, I be like (whistling)
Just before I die, drama, bring it
I'm Osama with it, I make man that are larger - brick it!

Gimme a zoot and a glass of Guinness
I be the nigga that they can't diminish

Bad Boy,London Town,2007.0,"Check
I'm down for the chicks
Out in the strip club
No long ting, out with the tits
Out for a quick
Buck, look
Don't even need it
I'm a rude boy
Ladies, yes, you best believe it!
So play your cards right this evening
Cause you're dealing with a

And look at the outfit fits
The rounder the hip's the quicker it takes for her to come back to the crib
And she was dancing on my lap for the Ps
But when we hit the bedroom she was happy to sleep
I guess she's

She's the kinda girl that won't give it tonight
Shes the kinda girl who wants to wait till it's right
But every time I make a move she'll be saying to me
""No no baby no you won't won't get it tonight""
And when I try set the tone she'll just turn on the light
Cause she know my flow boy she think that she brighter
But she don't really know not a ting about me
No you ain't easy
But you know that you're dealing
With a

Bad Boy inna London
Bad Boy inna England
Bad Boy inna London
Yeah I know you ain't easy
But you know that you're dealing with a
Bad Boy in America
Bad Boy down'a Kingston
Bad boy inna London
I know that you ain't easy but you know
That you're dealing with a Bad Boy

Look
I'm a Bad Boy
I'm strictly on chicks-chicks-chicks
In the back of the taxi or in the bedroom
I give her the dick-dick-dick
No matter the shape, no matter the size
As long as shes fit-fit-fit
Every second is wasted without a female presence so tick-tick-tick
I'm a male so females I'm out to get-get-get
Yuh tink me easy,  buddy she 'affi tek-tek-tek
You're used to dealing with amateurs and I'm a vet-vet-vet
Buy a bottle of champagne and all I get is a peck-peck-peck
I bet shes that kinda girl that's a tease
The kinda girl that raves and gets drunk for free
The kinda girl that drinks your drinks and then leaves
Them kinda women that's got you spending in Tiffany's
I don't need that
And I ain't buying lobster just to feed that
Bad boys treat 'em mean keep 'em keen
I'm bouj when it comes to the women
Listen so riddem up and let me hear the bad boy sing if you're a


Me sing say, oh ah
Woman just take it easy
Over seas in them bikinis
Mind the Bentley GTs
Cause them players can be sneaky
She should have never ever leave me
But now she wants a lover and her lover ain't a lie
She said she wants a man that want fi ride it like bike
She said she wants a man that want fi treat the woman right
She don't want a georgie porgie

Typical Me,Home Sweet Home,2005.0,"It's just one of those days, typical me
Typical club scene, typical grief
One of those raves, typical beef
Now this fucking headlocks putting me to sleep
It's just one of those days, typical me
Typical club scene, typical grief
One of those raves, typical beef
And Now this fucking headlocks putting me to sleep
It's just typical me

I must have one of those faces
It's stuck with me, I can't change it
I ain't troublesome, I'm the safest
But they won't let my clique in Faces
Cos I must be one of them artists that gets kicked out the club the fastest
Cause bouncers think they're the hardest
I'll bang them and blame it on Marcus
Yeah I go raves in the ghetto
I'll skank out and shuffle like Ghetto
Cos more times I'm just mellow
Or I'll have a fight before I say ""Hello""
But yeah raving's exciting
So I put it all in my writin'
And we ain't just always fighting, just the bouncers that think they're Tyson

Cos your with your clique, I'm with my clique
Try it with me
I'm kinda pissed, so mind that I switch
Don't try it with me
I'd rather kick, than go find a chick
Smiling with me
I tried my best to not be aggressive but
It's one of those days init

It's just one of those days, typical me
Typical club scene, typical grief
One of those raves, typical beef
Now this fucking headlocks putting me to sleep
It's just typical me

I must just be unruly
So no one can't overrule me
But look at all the drinks he brought me
I drink too much when I'm with 
So I might just being loose
A pest, a pain, in rave
The same shit happens almost every other day
Almost every other rave
There's some sorta drama
But sometimes I'm cool and calmer
Fighting, I can't afford to in Prada
No but I don't box just to prove I'm harder
But don't piss me off today, I'm pissed already
So I guess it's gonna be one of those days innit
Typical me
It's typical
You can take me out the hood I'll still act like a criminal
So don't try and get physical
But lemme weigh up my options
I'm me? They're Ministry bouncers
I lift 20kg's, I bet they probably lift houses
So i guess a 'one-on-one' just ain't the best way about this
But this is my situation, every week, life's a bitch
I'll probably get nominated and kicked out the Brits

Cos your with your clique, I'm with my clique
Try it with me
I'm kinda pissed, so mind that I switch
Don't try it with me
I'd rather kick, than go find a chick
Smiling with me
I try my best to not be aggressive but it's one of those days

Its always Kano getting in the madness
Me, I'm in the corner sipping on champers
But for some reason, I gotta face they all wanna ramp with
It's so typical, I'm no little fool
And no I don't wanna sit and talk
I'll take your mo' and sip it all
Every rave it's so predictable
When I don't mean the tunes we listen to
Heard next day is what I did and what I didn't do
So here's what is and isn't true
It's just one of them days
One of them raves
Where some of us ain't in the mood for bouncers
You might see me move to bouncers
Here's what I do to bouncers

If you're on the door, and turn me away
I'm moving to you
I'm known to swing, and not with my fists
I''ll tuck your crew in
I'm on the list, so don't take the piss
That's what you're doing
I've tried my best to not be aggressive
But it's one of those days",https://genius.com/Kano-typical-me-lyrics

This is the one, man
It's gonna blow 'em away
Let me teach these..
It's Kane man, let me explain man

I'm trying to perfect my flow flows
So my doe grows loads, like Pinocchio's nose
No, they really don't know
Most of these spitters roll blow so don't boast
It's like nasty and e's cold
I say that cos my nigga D know and like deep road looks oh, he's cold, these is all E's bros home sweet home
I speak slow, so the road can understand what I mean
So, when I mean business what I mean is pro
And when I'm a little broke what I need is dough
And I speak low, I'm all alone, I just go where I need to go
But if you dont know K.A you don't NO
And if you ain't on point then you don't roll
Look, I love the road
The tarmac the white lines, the double yellows the zig zags and the bright lights, I hate being in the limelight
But I love being on the page or on the stage at prime time
I'm having fun so time flies I'm having none so I find fights
One every five nights and I ain't weak I can rhyme tight but just let me let the beat say something for a second
That fine Mike?
You know of vice versa but should I have had my money straight before I got my mind right?
Cause before I'm shopping in byrites
I'mma take action like Michael Jackson and buy rights
Half a mill I'll be quite nice
I don't want a SL5 a X5 and 5 bikes
I dont spend I'm quite tight, I love money dont get me wrong but it's more what the songs like
You see me I ain't hard to please
I just wanna spit these bars and breeze
I just wanna sit in cars with the keys
Put my mum in a place where palms are the trees
Cause living broke that's hardly me
But being rich and legit that's hard to be
But I can't be bothered with bars of weed
I'd rather spit 16 bars for P's
I kick down door's no-one didn't let him in
I been around but I'm far from a veteran
I bet u didn't know K's been developing since plague and Pay as you Go days
Them days I wasn't on moves and dealing
I used to kick ball and make tapes for Deamon
Now I make plates and tapes for Demon
Now I got a fan base and me they're feeling
I'm rapping now, so I'm stacking now
I ain't slacking now, travelling, Louis Vouiton bags I'm packing now
I ain't trying to do crime all my life I'm cracking down
But nights got my tracking now
I was a slow starter but I'm zattin' now VRROOM
I used to get air but now I get poom poom
See you when I get there, get where?
Laid back in a deck chair on private islands, you go area and get air
All I say is ""yo 1, 2 check check yeah,"" it's KANO in the house then they know in the house to say NO when I shout DO I PLAY
Fuck rolling about I'm over and I'm out, my first tune blew sold over a thou
It's on when I lift the Mic
But I knew I would burst on a different vibe since the 21st of the 5th 85.....

Home sweet home
Thats where I come from
Where I got my knowledge of the road and the flow from
Home sweet home
Where the grass ain't greener, of half hard workers half are dealers
Home sweet home
Where I feel meaner, so I spit trying to fill Wembley Arena",https://genius.com/Kano-home-sweet-home-lyrics
Over,Beats + Bars,UnKnown,"K to the izz-A, N to the izz-O
This year niggers better know what dizz-O
Fuck everyday lay on the low
I'll blow and stay on the road
And still do raves just pay me the dough
Fuck albums I can bait from shows
Ah come on you niggers know
That I'm on top and you's are below
Once again its K to the izz-A, it's nothing
I murk MC's every dizz-A, it's nothing
On stage murk at the rave, it's nothing
K-A I don't play
A problem when I came in the game
Murk like Cassidy did Freeway
Dem boy they don't want it with Kane
I say dem boy they don't want it with Kane
They don't want it with K to the A
I'm so real its not games that I play
You dumb pricks don't wanna make a mistake
Cos you make in a month what I make in a day
If you're a top boy I'm taking your place, get brave and I'm breaking your face
You're eating, I'm taking the plate, I don't give a fuck who you are
They got about 10 man coming out cars, I was like 'Is it on?' they was like 'Nah'
I was like 'Fuck it' they was like 'Bruh 1 1 for kill bruh yeh﻿ take it too far!!!'
What the fuck did you expect two cars?
No 38 just 32 bars
I'm a bad boy, roll with bad boys
I'm back boy, don't make me get the strap boy, brap
Yeah, its over for certain niggers this year
'05 no niggers getting stripes of KA
Nothing long, Beats & Bars, brap brap
Here we go again
I'm way too much
Spit like a dan, don't say too much
Don't roll in raves two up
My crews up for it they're way too nuts
You could say I'm marga, I don't do weights too much
But I'm so heavy you thought I weigh too much
No I don't rate you much
Like I box, my boys can't wait to break you up
Like on I say Kane's moved up
You seen how many girls that K's moved up?
You heard how much money Kano's getting?
You seen how many girls that Kano's fucked? He's fucked
Look prick, I'm a pimp, never mind me
I mind my business, chicks wanna whine me
If it's beef in the street you will find me
2 guns up like like Sheek and Styles P
I got style, CD's and stoneys
Waiting on a few more G's for the rolly
My MC fee's going up slowly
You can book me for a G now phone me
Half up front, owe me the rest
No drama the ravers know that I rep
Just turn your TV on for a sec
Probably see me T-shirt off in a bed
I got P's you prick, start off with your neck
Cos you play dumb and it might cost you your breath
They get lost for words when they see me
Can't believe I still cotch in the ends
Like 'Is that Kano about in the street?'
Around with the G's no Anderson Lee, that's standard to me
Like writing 16's to the beat I murk
Like letting off a round from the heat
My bars are too fucked
They say my albums bound to be deep
I was raised in the East, so I'm bound to be street
And I'm like 'Fuck feds' I ain't down with police
Look its me fight down with the piece
The whole of my cliques coming down with the piece
On when we jump out of the jeep
Intensive care you'll be out in a week
It's over
But I can't give you too much, you have to go buy my album
Otherwise Rich is gunna be like Kaaaaaane
Kane, you gave em too much
I'm so fucked, imagine him when he's in his peak
And they ain't heard an MC this deep
I'm star quality please you're shits weak
Look leave, quit this week
For real I'm trying to get a deal this week
Trying to get these P's like Pharell
But still, I made my name on this street
My and the streets have got history
So I still spit, I ride the sick beat
Try and break down the Brits back door and draw Mis-teeq
I murk raves every week, cos I spit heat
Whether its Ritz or Oceans or PP
But on CD, I'm a G
Come a long way since building beats on a PC
I'm Kano and I flow like it's easy
Make people say Bow and they ain't from E3
I'm from east P, come and see me spit
Acapella no beats no BV's
On a street no peace
No P's just my peeps and me in my D&G's
My face is out they put their TV on please

Yo its K-A-N-O, listen, Beats and Bars
I'm busy but I still pop up on road
Roll with my niggers that plot for the dough
Bait motherfuckers got a box in the Golf
Got shit on lock like cocks in Bow
On stage you ain't topping my show
My clique's hardcore like rock and roll
Roll on the road with a pocket of dough
You're broke prick you can't even top up your phone
You might find that I got my cock in your hoe
When you bought her a bracelet, a watch and a phone
I buy rounds don't try floss me a mo
Cos that's how much these brandys cost me with coke
'05 niggers better watch me get dough
What d'you think I just had on lock for the mo
You watch the pennies, try and cut back
We rave in a six whip, clique, you get a bus back
And we bring the ting cos you can't trust blacks
So the windows are tinted and the cars black
There's no limit on it cos the credit cards black
Nah it's gold but still I get fast cash
Cos if it ain't big dough then we nah chat
I'm just in the car-park after for gash
And I don't make love fuck that
It's more like beef when we buss, when she buss I buss back
When I come on rush to the front, fuck the back
And pop pop pop feel free buss a strap
And no disrespect MC's but I'm back
So ollie ollie ollie please cut the crap
The most hyped kid but this one can rap
Even got the manager doing
I'm hot like a hundred degrees
So fuck that chain on your chest you're a fronter to me
So don't talk reckless in front of me
And if it ain't P's then you come to me
I'm the MC the yutes come to see
I write easy, the truth comes to me
So here's what I'm saying, I ain't one to chief
So don't be saying 'suck your mum' to me
I ain't letting no MC fuck with me
I'll beat you up on stage, fuck the beat
And it won't be sweet when you buck up with me
Especially if there's something tucked underneath
I got a little buffers tucked under sheets
And she only shakes her bum bum for me
And she dun knows I dun bun MC's
I bun MC's like rastas bun weed
So if you say it's beef then come come to east

You was in the field when I was on tour
I was on the telly when you was in the cell
And you was on the celly
Like when you gonna show these motherfuckers who's boss?
And I'm tryna look out for your boy
But you know how time goes, you only get 24
When you're tryna make the M then make 20 more
We all get the same hours
Remember them tune there ""I'll bring you flowers""
Iceberg jean, whine pon the gyaldem
Yeah, time change but you're still the man and we're still family
And if the family need they can shout me
I'm one phone call away, don't doubt me
Just as long as they don't ask for an Audi
Brudda, it's all calm
I still feel your mumsy's grip on my palm
In the courtroom we were linked to the arm
It didn't go your way but you took it like a boss
I bang down your door
You was pissed that you missed the awards
After parties and garden barbie's and video shoots with lil' kids on the lawn, you shoulda been with us
'Cause we got fire round and so we fly out
And yeah, we done the dance, the mandem's kosher
In hoods all over, we get the realest love
And thank fuck the ends is too far away to get mixed up in the mud
Yeah my mumsy said ""What's up?""

When we crawl, when we step, when we fall in love
I know theres nothing more that we can want
But to crawl, but to step, but to fall as one, All and All Together

Dance together, laugh together, unstoppable when we are together
Friends so young we could have bathed together
We played out, we top and tailed together
Riding a bike in the ends, Barking Odeon we snuck in
We took Shayne's car for a day, car came back, no plates
We could kick back in the kitchen, thinkin of ways we could make a killing
Up on a stage at Palace Pavilion
Boys love girls I bust my new riddim'
We were just friends to the death, Share 1 pound, 1 pad, 1 pen
Pick me up in a stolen, this was the friendship that couldn't be broken

When we crawl, when we step, when we fall in love
I know theres nothing more that we can want
But to crawl, but to step, but to fall as one, All and All Together
When we crawl, when we step, when we fall in love
I know theres nothing more that we can want
But to crawl, but to step, but to fall as one, All and All Together

My friends don't call me
My friends don't care
Me and my girl keep beefing
I think were almost there
Till' the end, been a good innings
I wanna be alone, this world I can't live in
Sofa sitting on my own, silent staring at my mobile phone
Should of pressed his name but I don't
Or when it says connecting I'm froze
And were suppose to all be boys, I can't believe it's come to this point
Destroyed
This must get better cos' I'm oh so fed up
We should be all for one all together
We were the 3 Musketeers but better, where did we mess up?
Where did it all go wrong, every other week its the same old song
Gone are the days when we rave just cos', chilling, jokes, laughs, bond
But now its just awkward, keep looking back but I wanna' move forward
Now I move cautious, this is just foolish, we were happy then broke, this is bad fortune

When we crawl, when we step, when we fall in love
I know theres nothing more that we can want
But to crawl, but to step, but to fall as one, All and All Together
When we crawl, when we step, when we fall in love
I know theres nothing more that we can want
But to crawl, but to step, but to fall as one, All and All Together

Hustler,140 Grime Street,2008.0,"Since 15 I was in the game
I was on the air yeah I was on the waves
I was doing shows I was on stage
I was tryna get that big boy pay
But more than the money it was for the name
Plus I had the talent to match my brain
I was on the grind, I was on Radio once a week when I found 'that's Kano'
I was on Raw, I was on Flavour
I was on 'Vu, I was on Major
I was like you but with a little bit extra
Went from a deep MC to a veteran
With perfection, with direction we can make P's with no weed possession
No election chose myself, I'm a dealer here's te life I've dealt

We don't need no crime where we're living
Youts nowadays are selling grime for a living
Cause we don't need no more hustle when we roll
Boot full of mixtapes fuck the Po-Po
Cuase I'm a hustler, I'm a hustler
In the studio all day it's rough you know
I'm a hustler, I'm a hustler
Tryna do it the hard way its tough you know

Now I'm 22, still in the game
Still getting better, still getting played
Still getting beats for cheap, E's for D's
Break it down or piece by piece
Flood the street, come to me
I'm a hustler Kano run the street
I got the lines on lock, fire like I got the 9 on clock
Brap, nigga duck down
I got the hot 16's right now
Thats why they don't like me
They try and bad mind me when Kano comes to town
But now, they'll never catch me slipping
Cause I'll be cooking product in the studio like its a fucking kitchen
Cause

We don't need no crime where we're living
Youts nowadays are selling grime for a living
Cause we don't need no more hustle when we roll
Boot full of mixtapes fuck the Po-Po
Cuase I'm a hustler, I'm a hustler
In the studio all day it's rough you know
I'm a hustler, I'm a hustler
Tryna do it the hard way its tough you know

365 for the rest of my life
Eery day I hustle like a Rick Ross rhyme
I got food if you're interested
If you would have invested
You could sell these hits and never get arrested
You could take this shit but you might get affected
The flow so addictive, beat oh so ecliptic
Respect it and you can lead a lie worth living
Ths shit right here can be your road to the riches

We don't need no crime where we're living
Youts nowadays are selling grime for a living
Cause we don't need no more hustle when we roll
Boot full of mixtapes fuck the Po-Po

Fresh like my Stan Smith's yeah they're a new pair
Fuck no clutch but I'm in some new gear
Automatic, balling habit
More swagger than the rest of them
Fake nigga wrestling
Record label dressing 'em
Fucking put a dress on 'em
Lift up the skirt show the earth there investment
Nigga that's a pussy where's the rest of him, whoa
Taught them a lesson, they can't talk to the legend
'Cos they stand for nothing so they fall over everything
I schooled 'em with excellence
Recording the best of the lyrics
That fooled the pessimist, I'm cold
Looking like a Dolce Gabbana manikin
Chirps Jolie's move past the Aniston's
Different class they're amateurs
Bitch I'm yes you're no like half the Gallagher's
Fake so I can't look past the characters
When nigga's front hard the cameras
Soap, wash a nigga's mouth out that's manners-less
Get rich and switch them bastards Anakins
But still I be the life of the party
Mad leather jacket vroom vroom no Harley
Killing themselves outfit kamikaze
Armani Exchange that's not real Armani
Fashion savvy's tell me I look 'fabulous darling'
You be in some OG style, green khaki
Shouting swagger this, and swagger that
Me swaggered off, you swagger jack
I told 'em ladies love me like they love Cool J
I don't do foreplay I do two-play
Forest Gate when E's I don't soufflé
They don't keep it real like UK, touché
Bravo, when I ???
Up in Kartel's smoking Monte Carlo's
Whip head top new shit, bar low
???? how fast the car go
Fast or slow I've mastered all flows
I'm so east end like I eat at Fargo's
Been a little quiet to you now days
But I've been on tour round half of the globe
So you keep tweeting I'm eating all my greens
I'll be on my p's thing
I ain't selling q's
But it's nothing but a G thing

Signs in Life,Home Sweet Home,2005.0,"There are lots of signs in life
Some that you may not like
You could be living this minute …
The next minute you're gone away
So hold up your hands my brothers
And be conscious my sisters
And by your worst, you will get paid

True, you can move food on the street
Did a bit of that, got bored of that
Didn't move the brown or the crack
Use to pick up for the fact
I could make more back by breaking down to scores and that
Stack to buy out the stores and that
Didn't give a shit about loads of that
But I did give a shit about getting locked up
Or get boxed up, sentenced you'll get about 4 for that
Crap, you ain't so rich now
I bet you feel like a prick now
'Cos where's all your fancy shit now
Where's your whips, chicks and your bits now
Shit, you should have fixed up
Fuck drugs, the mic you should have picked up
And it was all for the big bucks
Now you're sitting in a cell doing sit ups
Blood I told you this shit's fucked
The ghetto lifestyles too much
If I bust, be proud of me
You can't take it out of me
So I'm a bit stuck
But, I got too much to lose now
Love my life, and I don't wanna lose out
I'm still about, I'm home sweet home
In the ends, like I don't wanna move out
I'm too bad


Look, you can do moves on the street
I'd rather spit bars on the beat
I'd rather that than lick cars every week
But jack is when I split scars with the heat
So I'm so low like the guitars and the beat
But this rhyming shit is for me
I live this, drink this, eat this, shit this
And I've even writ bars in my sleep
But I ain't on hype, I've had enough phase
Ghetto's probably inside, hope he buss case
That undergrounds like road this, a tough race
You can be living this minute, then gone again like mum you was right
And I was wrong again
But I'm strong again
Still moved on again
Ten more minutes and I writ another song again
If I can do it, you can I'm a true fan
Up and coming MC's big up you man
The doors open but I ain't through man
I'mma ball through like a cue Dan
Watch me, ain't gonna let no-one stop me
UK I'm gonna break you properly
And if you ain't gonna watch me do that, move back
Who's that? K-A … I knew that
And I know its not easy, and I know what you're feeling
Just believe me


That's why I don't feel I'm safe
I fear I'm bait, but I can't put my skills to waste
Because if you're living by the gun you surely will get blazed
I still don't blaze, refuse to smoke my life away
Refuse to die before I try then put the mic away
This life of K, is just one big hype for praise
Write, night, record then start to write again
But I'm just saying, back on hype of Kane
But only I'm to blame
Today I saw the signs again, and it's not a good look
But ""that's life"" they say, crime pays
And I'll stop crime whenever this grime decides to pay
But grime ain't making me meals
So I'm picking up a 9 today
And spitting ain't getting me deals
But this shits just getting real


This shits just getting real... ",https://genius.com/Kano-signs-in-life-lyrics

I'm just spitting fire
You should retire
I can get low and hide like Mariah
I'm too 
Buss it up in the air
Eh, rude boy stop looking in my face

I see you looking in my face and ting, cuh
We keep it bopping in the raves and ting, brah
Them niggas making all the papes and ting, cause
We ain't into none of that wasteman ting",https://genius.com/Kano-buss-it-up-lyrics
Spaceship,Method to the Maadness,2010.0,"Spaceship will take off and fly
There's no turning back when you arrive
To a whole other world outside
Far away from here

She floats around the globe just like she owns it
Aerobics to fit the smaller clothing
She's sweet 16 and wants a Roley
Presidential golden, guest list and she rolls in
She looks into the mirror, don't like what she sees
She's curvy but she wants the Cheryl Cole physique
She's living through the TV and the magazines
Passport, she wants to board a spaceship to celebrity
She loathes life, rolls the dice, hopes it's high
She so admirers others lives with no insight
Confused in the cocoon that she's wrapped inside
Assumes it's greener so she dreams of living on the other-side
Living in a another world, star-studded, astronomy
A spaceship to send her round in space, like prodigy
She's blinded by the lights, she books the flight online
She's hoping to arrive in paradise, right

Spaceship will take off and fly
There's no turning back when you arrive
To a whole other world outside
Far away from here
Blinded by the stars in her eyes
Running away from her lies
Searching for a way to paradise
Far away from here

The writing's on the wall, it's actually in the posters
But nobody knows 'cos they locked her alone in her room and no one goes in
Sign on the handle, ""please do not disturb""
She's on Skype talking to a modelling agent and she's giving him a twirl
You can be the next Naomi, just show me that they ain't phony
I can't touch it through the screens, so fuck it sweetheart, let's meet
Tells her ""I can you famous, million dollar pay check
Front cover Zoo shoot, that when you know you made it
Pick up in Mercedes, drop off at the station
Stars in their eyes, ""tonight Matthew, I'm gonna be famous""
And if I'm stood there waiting, you are gonna change it
I can get to zero, hero, save me
From this world, 'cos I ain't Miss World
But I'll be Miss Universe when the spaceship returns
Haha, she thinks she'll be Miss Universe when the spaceship returns

Puppets and Strings,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Big ship sailing on the ocean
E Channel, blame it on the Odoms
Why I want the same P Drizzy got?
I still want the same respect RZA got
Fans see me daily, say ""what's happening?""
Said the man is missing like Madeleine
Thieving motherfuckers, take the game back
I know you kept the receipt in the same bag
I love the game, not the politics
So cuzzy I ain't making no promises
Now even my fam looking at me crazy
'Til they hear I'm out in Lisbon shooting for Mercedes
Why you ain't had a number one K?
Independent ain't the one K
Why don't you do a tune with David Guetta
Instead of these Sizzla Kalonji's

Spray fire, summer burning
16's turned the booth into a furnace
Cold winter, broken souls
You ain't seen nothing if you never seen broke
And the streets hungry, the streets thirsty

Old school cheddar like Froggy and 
It ain't about the paper, because it doesn't concern me
Make them say ""la la la""
The game is full of puppets and strings
Make the kiddies sing ""la la la""
Who's running these Sesame Streets? Not Ernie or Kermit
Who put East London on the map?
East until they bury me in a Louis bag
And I've been cooking up a storm like Heston
Because my niggas want me back like Desmond's

Small fish, big ocean
Back against the ropes, Hulk Hogan
I was listening to Layer Cake the other day
Still feel the same way as what I wrote then
You're too real for your own good
Fuck keeping it real for your own hood
We know you're a creative but what about commerce?
Well maybe Rock'n'Rolla, that was too commerc'
But if you released Nite Nite now?
Man would see some Our Price sales
Kano on some Wet Wet Wet shit
But what you want from me is not what I'm obsessed with
Downside of a forward thinker
You do it first, but they do it bigger
Then I say I might as well sell out
But my heart fought my head and knocked his brain cells out

Spray fire, summer burning
16's turned the booth into a furnace
Cold winter, broken souls

I don't really talk that much…
I don't even know what to say…

I was gonna send this part to Wretch
But now I'm gonna tell you this story instead
But he would have murdered it, yep
Certainly, yep
Just like my brother Ghetts
But I've got a few things on my chest
And no, I'm not talking no chain
They say heavy is the head that wears the crown, let me explain
I was like poster boy of this Grime shit
After Dizzee and Wiley
Boys Love Girls on vinyl
 but you know I'm flying
Then I got a deal with 679
Money in the bank, yeah P was alright
Had a little beef in the ends of course, but I guess that's just fucking life
First album, let's call that a classic
P's and Q's, nigga that was magic
Even though at the time people were like that's hip hop, not grime or garage
Label didn't want to put song out
Plan B still tells me I was nuts
Because when I play that shit right now, people still go fucking nuts
A hundred thousand records sold, yeah we made it, yeah we made it
And I wouldn't trade it for no platinum, I'd go gold and keep my soul
Overseas, we're flying out
Eating good, yeah dining out
Paid for niggas alcohol, so what the fuck they whining about?
Sophomore, that was London Town, with some mixtapes in the middle
Some said I had gone commercial, but I think it's how they led the singles
I wanted to drop ""Bad Boy"" first, then ""Buss It Up""
Couldn't see eye to eye, yeah we're both stubborn fucks
Couldn't see my vision, I weren't into being rich
That was hip-hop's younger sibling that was into being different
Then ""This Is The Girl"" with more fame than I was wishing
Now the  want more bars, the boss wants more singing
Gone. Slayed on the cross. Make everybody run and say Kano fell off
Then 140 Grime Street reigned on you whores
Independent and still better than that major manure
Method to the MAADness, money where my mouth is
Sixty grand canvas, fuck your fake Banksys
I live and die for my art
But sometimes the industry will push a knife through your heart
My legacy will definitely be rhymes and the bars
But time will tell if I was the Nas
And I ain't never sounded like Steps just to climb up the charts
So if I ain't a fucking puppet, that's a minor m'dawg
Some will say that I'm underrated, some will say I've underachieved
Some will say that I'm a genius, some say that I'm a G
Hope they know that I am legend and don't need no puppeteer
Because one thing that's crystal clear is I'm a fucking pioneer
Yeah, I want my props this year, position missionary - back on top this year
Bopping into Harrods, couple bags and ask is anybody selling any props in here
I want one in every colour mate...",https://genius.com/Kano-puppets-and-strings-lyrics

I dunno what happend it's just what the ghetto did
I wear my trousers low, almost near my knees
And everywhere I go you almost always hear there's beef
Cos I'm a ghetto kid, so I love ghetto chicks
And if we get together we can have a ghetto kid
I hope these people know, don't fuck with me
I always got my knife and I could get the 9 milli
Cos I'm a ghetto kid
I said I'm just a ghetto kid

I'm a ghetto kid, East London were the metal is
Where big shotters lick out white mountains like Everest
Most don't know where Heaven is
Forgive me, I'm rollin with Demon, I'm devilish
Know that i never miss, I'm a beef specialist
Niggas dun know that im blowin' up shows like a terrorist
And if they dont know then tell 'em it's
K to the izay N O
And fucking just remember this (Prick)
I'm reppin' for the ghetto kids
But Some niggas don't even know were the ghetto is
Please nigga find me in Plaistow
See me in C-town then bowl with the V6 to E6 East Ham
Its me man, im just me im a dan
Ive been writin since P99
So all kinds of artists should listen
My hearts ain't no prison
I master the rhythm like heartless on submission
Im a ghetto kid, I do ghetto shit
Ghetto gigs at ghetto raves and draw ghetto chicks
With big ghetto back-offs and big ghetto tits
Quick, free yard and ghetto crip strip
I love the road sweet road
And I always feel safe cause I'm home sweet home
If it's a mad ting then it's fine with me
I always got my knife and I can get the 9 milli

Cause I'm a ghetto kid
I said I'm just a ghetto kid

I'm from the ghetto half an hour from the suburbs
Where the 
food's white
 just like flour in the cupboards
Kids with more heat than a high-powered oven
Rowdy youngins that are so proud to be stubborn
They asking in the hood when my album is coming
I'm like look I ain't changed one bit
If I pass through the hood and your Audi is running
You know I'm a crook I'mma take that shit
Take that shit then I'm out, it's nothing
And if they know about me don't doubt me or think I'm bluffing
My word is my bond, but where I'm from niggas get murdered for what
Beef? If you ain't got a burner it's long
You don't want to see the aftermath
And I ain't talkin about the label Curtis is on
This ain't just a verse in a song
I buss two and put you in your hearse, then I'm gone

House of Pain,Not 4 The A List,2005,"You abandoned me
Love don't live here any more
Just a fantasy
Love don't live here any more

Hatred in my heart
Veins full of venom
Pain in my bars
I ain't strayed from the essence
Love don't live here any more, love ain't a tenant
Love moved out, when hate moved in, love ain't present

When Deja was my gaff
Jungle left the key under the mat
Those strings were attached but I'm not Pinocchio
In fact I always seen us as Jigga and Biggie
But as the years go on we're like Snoop and Pac

And that's the way it is
I don't love you any more
Back in the day I did
We had amazing times
We even made some kids
Get the baby wipes
Daddies gone and he made 'em sick

Yeah G we were sonning 'em
They really got tans we were sunning them
See them EQ dances there, we was running 'em
Na, really like spikes running 'em
You should applaud me with a hand clap
I gave you How We Living and Layer Cake like you can have that
Not as far as Amstrad but Mikey never had Mac
But now we flew past shoebox money Tony had to tax that

You know me as the man that's been doing this for years
But now I've found a better route
But you don't understand that
Respect where respect is due
But you don't understand that
Tell the truth you wanna man back

Yellow Alize and a rucksack
Chip in for a cab fare
Then man would catch a bus back
Now where's the fucking love at
That's what Jigga said on Blueprint
What we did on P's and Q's remix was the Blueprint
2000 & Life, stupid
No Calpol, too sick
In a city where the skinny niggers bury niggers
Virgins, pop your cherry niggers
Used to say wait 'till you see me on the telly niggers
Turn on your cable guy and Jim Carey niggers
You probably saved my life
First aiding a nigga
When a nigga didn't have nothing you were there to make me richer
I never forget the things you done
But it seems like you're the goldfish, and I'm the elephant
With the heart of a lion, so you can tell 'em 'come'
Just cause I flew my nest, like a pelican

So we know the love
But in love we know
That its easy come
And its easy go
So we played the game
But then who's to blame???
Welcome to the House of Pain

If love does live here how come I see her in Manny
Out in Sweden, out in Berlin, even see that bitch in Calais
She would be there when I'm hurting, yeah she used to be my bandage
We were pioneers we engineered then took her out the garage

Took her out the garage
Then broke down on grime street
Surrounded by pirates
Shipwrecked, ship mic, ship decks

And don't forget the the Two P from the needle
Should'a known you was fucked who steals a 2p from a needle

You of all people should appreciate what I've done for you
I would'a dedicated my first number 1 to you
I would'a sung for you

Sometimes they act like they've got hate in their blood
But they're missing me every day

How can anyone hate me this much
I feel betrayed, I know my nigga Kane feels the same
I'd be lying if I said you never helped me build a name
Take away you're love

But the talent will remain

I thought we were forever
But is seems like you don't wanna see me reach my full potential
We had a relationship and you should know supports essential
But look a what you did you abandoned me at my lowest
Embarrass me and you know so now I be talking vengeful
How the fuck could you ever try to ignore my full credentials
Used to call me special
Used to wanna see a nigga buss, you are the devil
Now we both want a divorce, this is mental
Love don't live here this the house of pain
Screams to loud to keep the sounds contained
And everybody round the way is now afraid
Tryna calculate a thousand ways to out my flame
Bloodbath DNA, down the drain
They think I'm mad already, let me show them how insane
I'm on some sour face, power plates, hockey sticks
Bauer's aiming for ankles, someone's is bound to break
This game is a shambles
Bunch of morons, that look act and sound and same
They'd rather see me clash make me push back my album date
By any means necessary, get me on a Malcolm wave
And now they got me saying no
Just like the rowdy ape
Just because they ain't evolved they wanna shout complaints
I ain't involved, and that's three words I'm proud to say

Na, love don't live here this the house of pain
So much pain I think I need some mansion space
Figures keep talking what the actions say, ventriloquists
That's politics but no doctor is spinning this
Michael Jack my loafers on I'm spinning pricks
I know I ain't a smoothie but I'm innocent
What they guilty of???
Fucking up the whole damn rap game
Yeah, they're like you're spazzing Kane
I hear some other shit, I hear what spazzing ain't
I know I'm on my own dick, I masturbate
Bars like old school dances gas the place
And I be praying even though Kane ain't welcome in church
Got the devil on my shoulder I kick that bitch to the curb
Prostituting my style to benefit others
I wouldn't mind if I was acknowledged, overrated or even spudded, but fuck it
She lied to me, tricked me and left me
When I walk like Keyser Sozes
Call her the devil in some red bottoms
The greatest trick she ever pulled J
G I thought it was true love
Valentines got her roses
Then times there it was all harsh
Question mark on the notice
She loves me, she loves me not
She fucks me, She fucks me off
I call her, she cuts me off
I leave her a fucking angry voice mail
""I just called back to say I didn't mean it
I was an idiot, I was a diva, I was a Gemini acting like a Libra""
And I'm sorry, as a matter of fact I fucking ain't
No we ain't jumping around but this the house of pain
As a matter of fact I fucking ain't
We ain't jumping around but this the house of pain

So we know the love
But in love we know
That its easy come
And its easy go
So we played the game
But then who's to blame???

After the club, we can link up
See what we can think up
Just let your body to the talkin'
Just let your hips do the walkin
I'll see you in the mornin'
But I don't stop when I'm yawnin'
I drink loads of hennessy and spend dough like I'm ballin'

I might drink a little drink, a little more
Till I bust a little dance in the middle of the floor
I might draw a couple gash, a couple more, till there's a couple bodies on the hotel floor
I might even start a fight, a few more, so boys get knocked out and carried out doors
I don't watch no face,
I do me, so screw me, but ya still can't do me
I'm licked!
And I stick wit' a bottle of hennessy, and I sip some redbull for energy.
So don't even come with your wife
Cos i'll have so much fun with ya wife,
Don't let me hot up infront of ya wife
Just let me get some then I'm done with your wife
But when she goes missing that night and comes home, don't even listen to the lies

You-Don't-Have-To pretend to me
But I-Think You Should Remember me
It was you, your-friend and my friend and me, and we were drunk on some hennessy

Look, I got buffers, but I don't get whipped like cream
Buffers with big bums fillin' up jeans
(buffers) so fresh and so clean
Buffers they all wanna cuff us
They love us
Buffers, slip and slide off with the buffers
In the ride, we only ride with the buffest
Only take numbers from the buffest
Play tracks like wayne wonder's for the buffest
Nuff gal!
You don't even know what nuff is
I'm bad boy and I ain't even rich like puff is
Car full of girls
And it's going real slow
There's girls at the back and at the front where the glove is
I'm blessed
But the henesee went straight to my head after my chest
How come we always leave after the rest
After we get drunk
Fuck it, pass me the rest


But I get dark like shades..
So don't get it twisted like braides
Before you get lifted like birthday bumps
Dont-Be-Brave (dont be brave)
Cos it'll be too late
Ladies see me with the pump
Make my boys pull 'em out and make the whole-place-jump!
But still I love to get to drunk
I love to get crunk and then swith to plan B
Have any old girl sittin' in my room and blame that night on bran-dy
I'm tryna get - under you, ya understand me?
Look, you don't understand me
I'm drunk on hennessy
No tenners, mixed with no lemon
Thats shandy
I don't smoke and I surely don't get stoned like Angie
I drink it from full
To empty
Then full like bam-bie

Sometimes,Home Sweet Home,2005.0,"Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
When I see the fans go mad I think why do they like me?
There's about a thousand other boys just like me
Spitting lyrics on the mic dressed in Nike
What makes me so special?
When they say I'm the next one to blow
I say why do they think me?
All I do is stay in mostly and sleep
And all I do is watch Channel U and drink tea, why me?
All I do is listen to myself and get my lyrics in order
Play my own songs and give a mirror performance
Now I'm about to sign I'm sorta of in there with Warners
I'm moving on now, wish me good luck
My manager said this the quickest deal ever
I said 18 years ain't the quickest deal ever
I'm trying to sell and make the quickest meal ever
Support my family so I can feel better
But its not for the cheddar, It's not for the fame
It's not for the Rolex, It's not for the chain
It's just for the respect, I've been doing this for years Remember, free of charge I ain't rich yet

Sometimes I think is it all worth it
I ain't a pop star I can't be perfect
I've know I've got far, but is it to far to turn back?
Sometimes I have to kick myself
'Cause sometimes I can't believe this shit myself
So sometimes you'll see me in a daydream
Thinking could the underground go mainstream
Sometimes I have to kick myself
'Cause sometimes I can't believe this shit myself
So sometimes you'll see me in a daydream
Thinking could the underground go mainstream

It's so real now, I've had dreams of this album
So reality is the theme of this album
Boy I dunno if I'll make cream off this album
I just wanna see fans screaming and shouting
I ain't doubting my ability but sometimes I think why me particularly?
What different have I got to offer lyrically?
But maybe there is something about me that the worlds dying to see
And without me, who can replace me a few can amaze me
And literally do what I do to the rave scene
And go from spitting in the booth to the mainstream
But am I gifted? Maybe I am
18 I'm only a baby, I am they say
But was I born to do this? Yes
I don't have to sign no forms to do this
But I just take it one step at a time
One word at a time
One stage at a time
One breath at a time
Until I run out of time

Sometimes I think is it all worth it
I ain't a pop star, I can't be perfect
I've know I've got far, but is it to far to turn back?
Sometimes I have to kick myself
'Cause sometimes I can't believe this shit myself
So sometimes you'll see me in a daydream
Thinking could the underground go mainstream
Sometimes I have to kick myself
'Cause sometimes I can't believe this shit myself
So sometimes you'll see me in a daydream
Thinking could the underground go mainstream
Sometimes I have to kick myself

There ain't many of my niggers still here as there was
When we was coming up back then, where the fuck they gone?
I dont know if it broke, or if I put it back to get it
Cause I just can't remember went wrong, what were we doing?
Theres nobody I grew with, oh ye thats right my brother Lee
And my cousin Smithy, and we're living life right now man
And this what we gonna do till its over, til its over
Til the game is over
Look! Usain Bolt flow try and take the baton from me
I can see whats inside they ain't rapping properly
Suprise! This is like a rapping robbery
Old school like a bally in the fucking Offy
Like gag up your mouth bitch
UMM UMM UMMM (Muffled Sound)
I'm only stealing my swag back that they stole from me
Every line fire, hose the beat
And every track gets fucked like a hoes the beat
And I go for a weeks, Mr Marcus indeed
I'm like snow and sleet, ain't nobody cold as me
Legendary like I rose six feet
Like Big Pun and Biggy go smoke from me
And I'm a winner when the games on
Avatar shit, looks sicker with the shades on!
And I dont like boasters and braggers
But this ain't 'D&G', this is Dolce and Gabanna
Ay Kane stop playing with these fuckers shoot to kill
Look, so you wanna be successful
I want the respect fucker you should be respectful
Fuck what the rest do, that shit can depress you
And fuck whose investing you, I wanna know whose dressing you
Flow of the year, six times running
Cause if I had of won it they'll throw tantrums Mr West threw
999, them fuckers can't protect you
When im spitting fire, rect you, bless you
Era of the swag rap, ring tone trapper
Skank tunes, or Mr Lover Man... Shabba!
Money money money, rich world no Abba
I grew up around some rapsy no pappa
But every body wants a picture now cause im richer now
And some of my closest bredrins are distant now
Its like the price you have to pay for the fucking fame
But I didn't give it all up I took my fucking change
Frequent flyer, I know its wrong but I earnt the right
To be walking up the Virgin Flights
More Champagne, keep that shit coming
Kenyan tab cause I keep that shit running
Look the city loves me cause I keep it so London
But im like dark like dungeons..",https://genius.com/Kano-game-over-lyrics
Don’t Come Around Here,140 Grime Street,2008.0,"If you ain't part of the clique don't come around here
If you live out in the stiffs don't come around here
If you ain't part of the city don't come around here don't come around nigga don't come around here
If you ain't been here before don't come around here
If you ain't ready for war don't come around here
If you ain't part of the slum then dont come around here dont come around nigga dont come around nigga's
Carry gun around here and they dump around here
If you ain't carrying one then dont go around here!
If you ain't carrying nothing dont go around, dont go around, dont go around

Cause all ya here is 'Brap brap brap brap'
Ya know were serious 'Brap brap brap brap'
Cause everyday is 'brap brap brap brap'
Dem young kids ain playing ('Brap') dem young kids are spraying ('brap')
Cause all ya hear is 'Brap brap brap brap'
Another engine 'Brap brap brap brap'
Another killing 'Brap brap brap brap'
Dem young kids ain playing ('Brap') dem young kids are spraying ('brap')
Cause everyday is

Something
Another gun ting
Another stabbing
Another mugging
Another funeral
Another one sins
Another yout man thinks he runs tings
Another mum lives but inside mum crys til her lungs sink
Brave face black shades trying to find justice on a wasted chase
For the heartless killers got faith for the police but their heart isnt in it
But then she gets charged up and reckless cos she can't get her son back and its hard to accept it
So she gets a weapon BRAP BRAP BRAP BRAPPP
And she ain't messin BRAP BRAP BRAP BRAPPP
Shes trying to find him BRAP BRAP BRAP BRAPPP
And she ain't denying BRAP
That its not the right ting BRAP
But she resorts to voilence BRAP BRAP BRAP BRAPPP
Another engine 'Brap brap brap brap'
Another killing 'Brap brap brap brap'
Dem young kids ain playing ('Brap') dem young kids are spraying ('brap')
Cos everyday is
Problems and problems and reasons for the problems
No solving of the problems just a part of your problem
More money thats their problem
Their gunna turn this place in to compton
If it werent for olympics these pricks wouldn't of put dough into east london
Neglettion
Kids carry guns for protection
Weapons buy that on the streets for pence
Direction
Kids lost that along time ago
Either they trying to blow
Or all ya hear is
BRAP BRAP BRAP BRAPP kno were serious BRAP BRAP BRAP BRAPP
Cos everyday is BRAP BRAP BRAP BRAPP
Them young kids ain't playing BRAP
Them young kids are spraying BRAP

Another killing BRAP BRAP BRAP BRAPPP
Them young kids ain't playing BRAP
Them young kids are spraying BRAPP
Cos all ya hear is
Role models
They say we need some black role models
That ain't footballers rappers actors or no models
Father figures
They say we need some more father figures
Like u can't grow if your mothers there n your father isnt
F**k dat
I say we need to put suttin back
Into communities where they think the way out is shotting crack
Its more than, music dont give us the blame
Atleast were tryin to make a f**king change

Feel Free,London Town,2007.0,"So the story is told in London Town
From the east and the west we come
And we'll all feel better tomorrow
When the lord comes down

It could a Cartier or a Rolex
Presidential threat to magary
Hang tight yes I can tell by the heartbeat
And you can probably take a pretty chick from a party
But guess what? Time don't wait for no man
Upside down from no sand, it won't slow down
It's going, it's going 'till it's gone
It feels right 'till you notice that it's gone
So why can't we all get along?
It's peace whenever I turn the mic on
It's beef whenever I turn to violence
It's deep in the east, I'm deep in the beats
Cause I wanna sleep on the beach and see my nephew see 23
Am I easily pleased? Um, I just wanna clean up my community
And throw a party for the whole street hardly asking for a whole leap
It's deeper than music, it's a movement, now sing along to it

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

But sometimes you have to fight hustle grind struggle
When you get no peace and too much trouble
No Range Rover with rims on
Put your headphones on and sing along

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

If you just get by the pence and ain't got no money for the rent
When your self motivation's gone, pop your headphones on and sing along

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
So the story is told in London Town
From the east and the west we come
And we'll all feel better tomorrow
When the lord comes down

Look time's of the essence, rhyming's a weapon
Metal detectors and lines at the entrance
See I made the news when my gig pulled
Same show next year, no violence at all
But no more rap breaks and academies
But I'd like to see them shut down McD's
Cause 
they shootin', nah, made you look
Give a stage and a page from a check book
Did use a few G's to the police
Just to put a show on for the fans to see, so
If you listening I'll spit the lyric
In N.W.A style and start killin' 'em
Nah I just wanna make them see
Spit my verses, say my piece
Get off my back, it'll make my sleep
A hell of a lot easier this week
Cause time at the present, life is a lesson
I'm still learning, trying for perfection
I'm still giving you fire on the record
The vinyl's like Ryan Hughes fireballs
Yes I've got the road, the world's my oyster, I want the globe
It's D-D-Damon you already know
And K-KA N to the O if mumsies hardly at home
You and your bro share the same clothes
Work ain't done cause you're babysitting
Feel free, sing along to the riddim

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

If you grew up without no dad
And everything you want, you can't have
Lost loved ones and you really miss 'em
Feel free, sing along to the riddim

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
So the story is told in London Town
From the east and the west we come
And we'll all feel better tomorrow

9 to 5,Home Sweet Home,2005.0,"All I know is a 9 to 5 ain't cutting it
Man I work hard, you really think its luck init?
They say its not what ya know but who ya know?
Shut up, its how hard ya work and how good you flow!
I'm ripe, I'm ready, I'm good to go
Im focused I never been so serious
The hood think I'm signed there like ""I swear he is?""
But Im still on the grind
 writing lines, all day every night
Writin rhymes, so serious
I'm never satisfied, until I'm satisfied
Its never ending,
 
I just wanna stand out
I don't want to blend in, no pretendin
See I'll won't never have a calms day rest
Til my albums in store next to Kanye West's
See I was supposed to be a footballer
They kept pickin the other kid that was a foot taller
I got lazy and less enthusiastic
I stopped training and turning up to matches
Started sub as the manager's tactics
But when I did play I used to score hat-tricks
Then I gave up, now I'm in the music biz
And I won't ever let my laziness ruin this
Theres just no point, I'm on point
Im the Henry on the mic, Im so on point
I can't take an nine to five, I'll rhyme for life
I stay up writing lyrics from nine to five
Line for line, from time to time
'Cause I'm special they ain't another mind like mine
I can't take an nine to five, I'll rhyme for life
I stay up writing lyrics from nine to five

Ghetto Kyote,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I’m from the hood but it’s just home and ain’t no place like home sweet home
There’s a whole deep of heat on the street, some plastic and some chrome
I’m old school like classics, I love a one on one but I can play gun on gun
Some talk a good game but they ain’t practical, and they won’t clap the tool
I’ll clap old niggas, I’ll clap niggas in school
If you don’t wanna play gun to mum, let’s play knife to wife
I’ll stab bitches I’m cruel, why waste a clip I’m poor
If it’s war I might roll up to the whip, open doors and hold up your bitch
When the four’s open, fire back off, you gotta back off cuh you might get holes in your hips
Respect the fireball respect me, if you reppin for the hood you represent me
And I be where 50 cent be in a club with no bub just some Hennessey and bales of weed
I’m bad breed, watch your back if you say you’re ahead of me
Cock em back, be prepared just know that, I ain’t scared just know that
Buss thru the letter holes in their creps where the toes at
See your letterholes mind your step, I hold that
Once I start I can’t hold back
Who’s gonna hold me back once I start you’re crazy
Shut you up with a dum-dum you baby
Gets much deeper, take away your son like a night wrecker in a day scheme and put the heater to his head and sing rock-a-bye baby
KA, blowing up road, KAN, shotting like O’s
KA slash Kano with the flow again, you can’t catch Kano there I go again
Gash, Kano’s got a batch of em, Papes, Kano’s got a stack of em
Got a lash on them niggas watching my cash come in
Got a MASH for them niggas that’s too masculine
KA, every damn day I’m on the road tryna get paid
So hot like we sunbathe in a blacked out golf with Shane
I bravo Brunel and Dage
You know my aim’s to make money and sonny you know the way
Check the grams you know the weight
And I got mounds on the block with plans for the Glock
It’s KA, down for a lot, down to shot, down to shoot, down to rob
Down to buss verse, I’m down to earth, down to put you 6 feet down to earth
Bang down your doors like trick or treat
Treat me with P’s cause trips to heat
And you don’t want to mix the heat with a cold heart, cause I know you got shit to eat
Ay-Oh, and you know I’m on the road tryna get dough
Love the road and can’t let go
Still tryna build my P’s up like Lego
Still rude still won’t say hello
Still like old school tunes like bellow
Still good, still hood, still Ghetto
Still K, Still A, Still NO, still mellow
Still about that paper, quick P’s tryna catch that paper
Still cash or gash, and then lash your gash an hour later
I won’t be long, in the game that’s where I belong
Making change that’s what I been on
And if your girl don’t come home, then you know what she’s been on
Cause when I spit, I spit to kill, spit fires at alarms you know the drill
Entire crew armed you know the drill, Bring games if you wanna play you know I will
Spit rounds and run clowns outta town, cause your click don’t like when they hear the clip
Gets Nasty, draw clip chicks come with nasty, clip clip come with nasty
Don’t put it past me, yeah I can be nasty
Mash that boy that’s tryna walk past me, blast him imma blast me
Can’t class me, with these other MC’s I’m nasty
KA do it my way, do it smartly, soon come soon, bun then a whole party
No time for the badminds tryna dart me, can’t harm me, Kano I’m a kamikaze",https://genius.com/Kano-ghetto-kyote-lyrics
Lady Killer,Method to the Maadness,2010.0,"Watch how I steal her heart like and old school villain
Armed robbery slide down from the ceiling
Hand cuff her tie her up by the bed
Strip search her from the toes to the head
And no I ain't keep posing a threat
So you can forget the code word, code red
Shhhh don't tell nobody
'Cos everybody knows in former for dead
Creep in the club jump out of the van
Trap door back door hold up my gang
Looking for a target to swarm on
Get my Jason Bourne on
Your for real I'm for realer
I'm count Drac, you're dinner
Smooth criminal
But more like an 80s thriller 'cos I'm a lady killer


I love her like Ackee and hard food
I'm a teachers pet in the classroom
But I still attend detentions in the afternoon
So I can try steal her heart soon
She was like no at first 'till
I made her say oh yes like Churchill
She sends me pictures on the internet
Thats because I got the Lynx effect
She lets me break all the rules
Even let me skip class in the sports hall
I know Asher Roth said he loved college
But boy I love school
'Cos that lesson last week was awfully crazy I wish we taped it
'Coz she taught me things that I never knew and A stared me to 'cos I'm a lady killer


When I say I'm gonna kill a woman
Ii don't mean it literally
Seven links a week
One a day, I kill them instantly
And ever since 'Sing For Me'
I just told Kano that I've been mass murdering
I take a woman to the highest heights
And if she feels shaken up, tell her ""thats turbulence""
The last man weren't as fly as I
Every time I hit her I'm delivering a dinner
I fill the belly up
 
I'm heading up for the liqueur
Oh my Godzilla were her words for realer
Bigger than your average nigga

Mic Check,Beats + Bars,UnKnown,"I don't give a fuck about your reputation
I'm the star from the top like Christmas decorations
And me merking you right now that's my estimation
Dedication plus patience equals elevation
Get your voice on any station
Why you waiting?

Why waste time debating fucking around not raving
Late night time im in the studio slaving
8 nights a week too many days in
That's when you see me with a beard fuck shaving
Im tired of rhyming but I am a pain in the backside, your plan backfired
You can look up anyone that's tried
They can't merk me never, no that's right
It's not that season nor that time
I ain't boasting but I am that type
So shut your noise and gimmie that mic
Heard the beat and I was like gimmie that mic
And I wrote some fuck lyrics that night
I'm on point, you're falling behind
It's all in the music it's all in the mind
What you call it garage? What you call it grime?
Call it what you wanna call it, I'm fine
But rhyme wise I got a short order of mine
Doogz, Dee, Wiley, Ghetto these have got new flows all the time

Testing mic check 1 2, someone so called your name, so what's new fuck him, fuck them, fuck you
If they want to clash with me I would love to
 hello who is this? Who are you?
 
there's beef on Deja, it's going off on the roof
 shuut up, what now? What crew? What N.A.S.T.Y?
 nah
 fuck you!

My flows big, big, big I spit hits kid
Big tings rude boy im done with this shit, quick, quick, quick
The shit click, click and ill be like swift put the stick to his ribs
He's rich, rich, rich take thatshit, you win some you lose some son life's a bitch
Bitch bitch ain't that a bitch oh well bad luck piss
Piss, piss. I was born to be rich
Santa knows I had money on my Christmas list
And when you get some
Comes chicks, then all of your texts end in a kiss
Kiss, kiss, hi hug kiss, kiss that how they greet me
All because I flow ill like a sickness
Im a sick kid, but when I spit hot shit im on fire, but im a big blitz",https://genius.com/Kano-mic-check-lyrics
Over & Over,London Town,2007.0,"Over and over again 
Over again

Like beef back and forth
Chiefs backing tools, thinking they're street, black and cool
Lying acting fraud, married to the street and then sign that divorce
A cheap bottle of wine then I pulled
The same thing I pulled last time, that's a fool
Back to the road, hit her from the backup resume
(Over and over again)
Like blacks on the news getting shifted with straps in the boot
Knowing and knowing again
Back to the pent unstrapped in the booth with knowledge and facts for the youths 'BRAP'
And that's not the sound of the beat, that's just the sound of the street
Like 'WOOP-WOOP' that's the sound of the police
I murk mc's many times
They say I've murdered like 25
And I've murdered like 25
They're still nervous at 25 (over and over again)
Commit petty crime, in the petrol station at any time
Swear on your life you've already lied
Two time your wifey like 20 times (over and over again)

I'm trapped in this life of sin
Try and win this continuous fight within
I just don't listen know no different
Leave shit around me then things go missing
No religion church no visit
I confess my sins all of the rhythm

Like sent home from school parents overrule, I still hop the fence and over walls
Like fuck Santa clause, if my shit ain't under the tree then niggas best run way from me
Cause I'll blatantly, eat the whole class 'till Miss Bateman sees
Misbehaving please, don't dictate to me
I've heard that shit over and over again
Shows get banned, radio keep sleeping, real fans gets cheated, we get defeated
But we keep dreaming
They say we're seen as equals and we believe it
That's why they call us urban and we encourage it
Yeah they might like but were in love with it
Saturday night life ""yeah, they're loving it""
Monday drop like ""we heard enough of it""
Back to the crime grind work and other shit
But her I'm fucking with (over and over again)
I'm trapped in this life of sin, trying to win this continuous fight within
It's taking part that counts but I rhyme to win
Keep paying cash out so I rhyme to live
Still trying to blow, it's about time I did
I'll probably be out by the time it's in
Need to pull some strings like the violin
The same old shit (over and over again)
Same Air Max, same Stan Smith, same grey tracksuit just different colour tick
Hit the same bars (over and over again)
Spit the same bars (over and over again)
Spit the same bars (over and over again)
Spit the same bar (over and over again)

Over and over again 
Over again

Red Bull, keep it up
Swimming pool, deep in her
Chris Brown, beat it up
And I don't mean black eyes
Nah I mean backside
Up in the air tugging hair like Toni & Guy
X can't match I
Cheques can't match mine
Neck-bite, vampire, uh-uh, and tight
She's that type, Rabbi
Stab her like Samurai
And when it gets deeper arch beats like Akai
She's knows I'm that guy
Gold digger, she's not that type
With a patch eye, pirate
She's that fly, private
Stylish, timeless, high heels, five inch
Money in the ISA, business-minded
Still rough riding, night club wining
Vodka and lemonade with a little bit of lime in
I know how to pull the right strings like violin
She knows how to do the right thing like Spikey
Booty call, dialling, quarter-to, five in, the morning, emergency, nine nine nine-in
Yeah, she can get it
Quick break then get it
Two second gap like she run out of credit
Ready, shower or beddy, choose
And she can give it back like Tennis, deuce
She's a fox, she put the Jamie in you
But blame it on the swagger, don't blame it on the goose
Blame it on the jaffa, yeah I got cake
So move your body like a snake, ma, black adder
In yard we don't say shag, we say dagger
Catch up, tie her up, handcuff, spank her
Straight front way or back way, the latter
Switch it up then get back to the back like Kappa
That's a bonus, banker, spoiler, pamper
And at the least I will Add Lee or black cab her
On a real though she loves my swagger
She loves to play rough so I grab her
Manhandle her in a rude boy fashion
Straight Pamela bathing suit on smashing
The summer time, beach and bikinis
Breathe in the sea breeze
Sex on the beach, no drink, I do real ting
Sexual, give her that healing
Make her feel good, yeah I give her that feeling
Told me that her man found my jacket while he's cleaning
I told him go keep it, I gave her that semen
Then he stole my number and he text me in the evening
Said he had new evidence, exhibit c ting

What's popping
Let me set this shit on fire
Look the streets is too much
Young niggers are of the rails and beefing too much
That's why I need to bus
And I ain't trying to go jail not even two months
But its easy to buss
And I ain't talking about fame, cash and cars
But more like letting off straps in arms
Let the beef die down, then we're back in arms
The streets is too much
You try and stay low, but everyone knows who you fuck
Then you got niggers running up in cribs waving the 4-4 like they're fucking big
Most niggers don't know what hustling is
But its cool, you're just not that type of nigga
You don't have to be straight its a minor nigga
Me I'm a 16 writer nigga
Look I'm a five grand man you're a fiver nigga
Taking over say goodbye to Jigga
Who's realer?
MC killer, I'm cancer ain't no-one iller
I'm amber, right before you go, I'll be like no
Come in and murk you
That's my word
You slow down prick patience is a virtue
When it's my time, and it's my nine
That will end you if you diss my lines
So I keep my ear to the street
And there ain't much shit that miss my eyes
So don't think you're on par when you're dark
You best be on guard and your bars
Best be on point
But you're arse
I'll take your car and pimp my ride
And not satnav and a new body
Just two gash that can take body
Your team be easy
I'm greaze
See me I'm connected like BT
And I ain't old school like DT
But I'm the new kid on the block
Treat albums like drugs and move it on the block
Wrapped in plastic I move it easy
And I'm a bad boy like PD
And I'm tryna move them units
So I've perfected my CD
Cos I like to move it, move it
I see niggers in their new whips cruising
Round town bumping my music, music
Cos I'm a ghetto kid
And don't make me prove it, prove it
Cos I'm a ghetto kid, and I do ghetto shit
And I don't know what happened its just what the ghetto did
Look I'm a ghetto kid and I do ghetto shit

How to get gyel nigga I should have a app
Gyel-dem chase the stick doggy-styling like a Staff

If she like me because I rap
She could find another black me
Winding up with that's Miley Cyrus with a rack
Never gonna happen
Love her like Chris but I'm never gonna slap 'em
Love Ri-Ri like a TT from So-Solid first 
And I fucked Eve before she heard of Adam
You heard of Alan?
I've got the key
She got the pussy
I got the D

Like I've just seen Pulp
Fiction, Quentin Tarantino
Like I just shot Marvin in the face
King, but all my bars are ace
Ask, how will I ask this face?
Bars are back so all my dogs are rake-
Ing it in this year
Stig on the track slip it in fifth gear
All about the clunge though
Fucked from the sun goes
Freaky in the morning
Jet like a Jumbo
Get a wok hot on top get a sun-stroke
Might buy her two diamonds, no Umbro
Mike the beat cold my nigga dun know
But I might need a couple lines everyone knows
The lyrics might come slow
So let me repeat the first one bro
Big titties all in my face
Big titties all in my face
Bet they're a 32 E
Shit that I get up early to see
Hair in the way and hers were cooly
Brush that aside and turn into creed
We d-d-d-d-doin' it again
Cubicle love we do it in the gents
Big chauffeur we do it in the Benz
Glastonbury we do it in the tent

Cause all im askin for is a fun night
I dont get a chance no more
You see that thats called a dancing floor
It's like nobody dont dance no more
(its like nobody dont dance no more)
These kids now days
They dont make them like they used to
They dont even dance in the raves like we used to
One finger skank and two steppin in your new shoes
They just raise their gun fingers and see who they might move to
And they dont appreciate music they can use too
So if you ain't cuttin it
Dont chat sh*t ill boo you
I just wana see some people move to my new tune
Cause these new youths have definatley got a screw loose
Look im in a dancin mood
So i hope you got on your dancin shoes
When you see me no im jus passin through
With a beverage maybe a glass or two
All the man yeah im askin you
And the girls move your hips when your dancin too
Come get together and dance in twos
D.j we love that ratsed tune
You dont have to move too fast too
You can even do a slow wind like my aunts do
Im telling you, you can dance to a dark tune
So dont say play suttin a can dance to
You can do it dont say that you can't do
You can skank and still be this fit
They just need to be uplifted
Cause kids nowdays have gotten twisted
Kids nowdays, They dont make them like they used to
They dont even dance in the raves like we used to
One finger skank and two stepping in your new shoes
They just raise their gun fingers and see who they might move to
And they dont appreciate music they can use too
So if you ain't cuttin it
Dont chat sh*t ill boo you
I just wana see some people move to my new tune
Cause these new youths have definatley got a screw loose
Look i'm in a dancing mood
So i hope you've got on your dancing shoes
But dont think im one of them dancing dudes
I just got rid of my dancing tune
But nobody dont dance no more
Enjoy yourself and start no war
Dance for the whole rave
Like venue there the good old days
But ain't no rave better than the old raves
Shut Champagne and the low fade
Skank out heartless i'm old school
Love bug burden over you, it's overdue
No hype no fighting over tunes
Ten guys on the mic all over you
No ravers just some rude girls
They dont make them like they used to
Kids nowdays, they dont make them like they used to
They dont even dance in the raves like we used to
One finger skank and two stepping in your new shoes
They just raise their gun fingers and see who they might move to
And they dont appreciate music they can use too
So if you ain't cuttin it
Dont chat sh*t ill boo you
I just wana see some people move to my new tune

Six body, seven bodies, eight bodies, nine
Ten more soldiers on the front line

Huh, if there's dough you know that I'm there
Roll up in there
Crew zoot already rolled in the ear
Look I'm from the streets
Fuck the awards
And I'd rather win best flow of the year

Fuck beef, get get get more dough
If you were me you'd get get more hoes
I believe I rep rep the raw road
Yeah! I make the olders aware
Straight up, ain't no dough for you here
Ain't no percent, nobodies Blair
And ain't no defence
I'm on attack like 8 goals in 10 games over friend
And I ain't got time for killing all your dead
I rhyme tight so I get hoes and head
But I roll with a clique who put holes in heads
You get a little dough I make loads of bread
Try a PA for free-a
Plus VAT and free drink of them thing
I will still bop you, behave
I am on sky dead, in the Sky,  BA
In New York we OG
I ain't Black Panther, fight the police
But I'm hood your ends like the OC
Give me ten years I'm D.O.C
But right now something might P.O.P
Off the night, on sight you know me
On hype again but don't act like The Game
Got the nine, I am blade bey
Big long thing like shinobi
I'm bait in raves, I ain't low key
Old school skanks like the okie cokie
One finger shit, same will finger chicks
You don't wanna see this one finger itch
Niggas better know this one finger's clips
And you will never see this gun finger snitch

And when I shine you shine, we shine together

Ah, Tell Siri text her 'Looking pretty'
And leave a wink wink on the end something silly
Yeah I get mine headline like I'm Drizzy
But you don't love hype fuck Shyne like a Diddy
As long as I got my boo
Them other girls cool but they're not like you
Winter time swagger you rock high boots
Borrow you my jacket when the Fahrenheit falls
Gentleman, I follow them Bronx Tale rules
She's the open the door from the inside sort, ask Sonny
And when we fine dine spend money on the food
She said the black cod's nice but the oxtail rules
Yeah she's no Cinderella
The Roly struck twelve still fly no feathers
Dropped her the philosophy
My nigga told me 'Would you rather live like a Queen right now or a Princess forever?'


Sugar cane babe give you that sweet
Two veg yeah give you that meat
And when I say this I ain't talking about drinks
Montego Bay, sex on the beach
And its girls over guns, cha
You dun know its bosses over bombs, huh
You're ginger I'm De Niro
Be Petrelli I'm your hero

Baby I'll give you my nine like my shoe size

But I'm still on the road, so I can smell the gun smoke
Look I sky walk but I never run though
When they tell me that ???, I just say you dun know
Halo, Halo I can see your Halo
You know who I'm chatting about when I'm on the radio
Just another boyfriend, ???
Meet me on a double date with Kane 'cos I'm able

Big man ting I'm putting plates on the table

Two left and there ain't nobody real around

Only cause I laid my hat

Our flow cold you're so-so
Bars for days bar raised pole vault
Suit
Slew a knight, suicide no rope
I'm on some Ice Cube shit fuck the po-po
No ice tees Coco logo
So road roll on a low note
I know most won't pose for the photo
Boardroom full of suits show for the dough bro
Economy up and down yo-yo
Still make the peak, only me
Couple of cash gigs stretch like elastic and stick to the plastic, yeah I sold
Benjamin but a niggers don't grow
Talking like the sold coke and they sold loads
I move with the times Steve Jobs on the vox
Kids listen up or go slow with no notes
I lyric, I writ it, I spit it
I ain't in a Tribe Called Quest but I kick it
Nike weren't talking to me cos I did it
Nigga I live it

Take that flow
Soul survive
Cut me a slice of the American Pie
Piece by piece and bit by bit
For when all falls down in a pile of bricks

Eh eh eh eh the realest of the realest
M.I.C positive the illest of the illest
Cats copy everything I say like minutes
Economy was crushed but the business is the business
Pirates attacked while the industry was fishing
Trying to sail strong Popeye, spinach
Trying to rise right to the top, Guinness
I'm just trying to pay my bills no cakes
Nobody gimmie gimmie gimmie so I take
Robin Hood, robbing rich
Robin, Batman superhero shit
Stopping bad guys

This Is My Life,London Town,2007.0,"There's a thin line between love and hate
There's a thin line between real and fake
There's a thin line between everything
That's why more times I don't say anything

But I'm fed up of shows, fed up of stress
Fed up of promos, fed up of press
I need to find some inspiration before I'm fed up of this
Fed up of the business
Fed up of all the opinions
I'm just trying to make my music
There just trying to make millions
Cause I'm K-A-N-O now
Product to be sold out
A marketing plan that I can't slow down
And look how bait my face is
So I can't roll now
There's a few places I can't go now
But I love the music, love the studio
Love the vibe, love the beats
But that's enough for me
The hypes too much for me
And yeh I'd love to be
The greatest MC that ever fell in
Love with bars and fucked the beat
You can't fuck with me
I'm ahead of the rest
I speak from the heart
And push out my chest
I stand for something
And you won't stand your ground for nothing
I'm real
And let me tell you exactly how I feel
It's more than a product
It's life
A product of my environment

This is my life
This is my love
This is my voice
And the place were I'm from
This is me
My heart on my sleeve
Ain't nobody else but me


But check it
I flow deep, don't speak, I let the music
It's real talk
I let the fans no what the truth is
More times I love my job
Some other times I think it's bullshit
Cause the politics and the promises
I just dismiss myself from it
But I can rhyme when I feel like
And tall when wanno
Some artist can't even write the songs that they want to
But I'm gifted an talented and far from a pop pac
And far from the industries standard
That's standard
True no fake-up, shoot no make-up
Writemy own bars, so if I flop, it's on me
I'd fuck the city, cause I got the key to the street
That's why I represent every day of the week
3-65 24-7
The pen is on me, I don't need any more weapons
And I love creating so much that I even forget
That I'm fed up of shows, fed up of stress
Fed up of pro-mos, fed up of press
I think I found my inspiration
I can't be fed up of this
Cause I don't think the nation gives a fuck if I'm selling this shit
I'd do it for nephew, I'd do it for me
I d do it for my whole fam, cause they'd do it for me
I'd do it for the whole fans, I'd do it for the whole click
No matter how big
I still hold it down
I still float about
I still crawl around shit
So no matter how rich I get
I'll still be a product of my environment",https://genius.com/Kano-this-is-my-life-lyrics
I Don’t Know Why,Home Sweet Home,2005.0,"It's Kano, you should know my name
Yeah I make beats but flow's my game
And I ain't got no G-G-G-Unit piece
So my whole crew ain't got a frozen chain
It's Kano like I said before
I can spit rock, grime, hip hop and more
I seen old school fall to the floor
But I'm a battler, I get raw in the war
It's Kano, let me say it again
K-A-N-O, let that stay in your brain
If it's a good flow then it must be Kane
I ain't normally this boasty, I must admit
Look, I write songs but I hustle a bit
So I ain't got a problem with busting a lip
And I've already bussed on the road
So bussing mainstream ain't nothing old

I know I'm bait but I get tempted time and time again
But I know I ain't got no time for fucking playing games
Cause if I'm on crime but I write rhymes then I'll go either way
And I don't know why that I'm so blind that I can't see the way

It's Kano, you should know my name
Yeah, I make beats but flow's my game
They don't like the way that I rolled on the road
Roll in the club like I just rolled in off the road
Roll out with rich chicks that roll in the golf
(Wait, 1234, too many gyal!)
Three chicks in the whip, ditched some on the road
Kano is about to give them something to blow
And we're not talking about the something you roll
Wait, this is your whip, why would I be dropping you home?
Look if you're not dropping your clothes and showing us toes
I'll keep hold of your phone and we're robbing your Golf
Jack the toaster, the telly and the landline phone
The DVD player and remote control
Now we're rolling on the motorway, heading for home
Looking ever so bait on the A4 road
Bait crib, bait ends, in my face, it's flames
Please tell me why I'm still playing games

I know I'm bait but I get tempted time and time again
But I know I ain't got no time for fucking playing games
Cause if I'm on crime but I write rhymes then I'll go either way
And I don't know why that I'm so blind that I can't see the way

It's legit thing, that's a big step for me
And I will make mistakes, so let me be
Whether I bring thugs to the set with me
And they take home clothes they was meant to leave
Sometimes, I can't behave myself
I get in so much shit, I amaze myself
My name's Kano, I know you've heard of me
Yeah, I make beats but, but...
I've got a way with the ladies, way with my words
But downright rude, that's the way I prefer
If I don't sell jack then I'll be on the curb
Cause I don't give a crap about being commersh
I know you've already heard the flow
Cause I've been on the grime scene getting reloads
Bunning down raves, still getting weak dough
But I still treat dough the same
If I don't act right then road's to blame
If I hot up a promoter that I don't want to pay
Cause I don't want a cheque, I want cash today
If you told me invoice, I might smash your face
I'm underground, please believe
I just want the Ps and just scrap the fame
How could I ever change over change?
I'll never change I'm the same, Kane

I know I'm bait but I get tempted time and time again
But I know I ain't got no time for fucking playing games
Cause if I'm on crime but I write rhymes then I'll go either way

Sleep  Tight,London Town,2007.0,"Out on the road we roll
Spending dough
Looking fresh from head to toe
Now word on street
Niggas heard
On the beat things is sweet
And I'm making dough
And they will run up in your grill
Put the gun up in your lip
Waste the ronie from the video...
So don't hate the player, hate the game
Hate the money, hate the fame
I ain't change... don't hate on me

Sleep tight 
Bed bugs bite 
Sleep tight
Bed bugs bite 

Sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs bite
You'll be alright
While I'm tryna catch z's at night
You think that it's an easy life?
Fuck that I'm sleeping with my heat tonight

Yo, my sleep's like Nightmare On Elm Street
Beef with the ghetto Freddy
Tryna wake up, but it won't let me
Silent no music or telly
It's no longer Home Sweet Home
Stressed and brain's on overload
Even sofa dreams at home
I'm getting robbed by the robbers from Home Alone
I sleep with a heat at night
Close enough for me to reach if I
Hear something weird going on outside
Can't sleep with that shit on my mind
That's why I'm on my grind
Live everyday like it's almost time
I get the hood news, all those crimes
Gotta be the victim one day right?
Ask B I saw it happen
I saw the death before it happened
And even described the scene
And so similar it seems
So now everytime I dream
I take it ever so seriously
And that's why I'm prepared
See it's time for beef when it's time for bed

It's like my... worst nightmare 
Sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs bite
You'll be alright 
Sleep tight
Close your eyes and pray to God that you're still alive
Sleep tight
Shhhh
Sleep tight
Close your eyes and pray to God that you're still alive
Sleep tight
Don't let the bed bugs bite
Bed bugs bite
Sleep tight 
Shhhh

They say it's the cousin of the death
So I keep a knife right under the bed
Still watch my back when I'm in the ends
Til my time in the limelight's come to an end
It looks sweet when I'm the Benz
Back seat, just done with the press
Head back East
They see you, get mad about it
Fuck it, I might aswell brag about it
I know I'm such a humble kid
Music just having fun with it
I do this so I can better me
Not to make friends turn enemies
It must have been the deep end where they chuck you in
With no choice but to swim
Cause there ain't no one to tuck you in and say
Sleep tight
You'll be alright
Sleep tight",https://genius.com/Kano-sleep-tight-lyrics
How We Livin’,Home Sweet Home,2005.0,"I got this long intro and I got nothing to say
I just wanna ask one question
Hear me out

How we living?
My East side niggas - how we living?
How we living?
My bullet proof West - how we living?
How we living?
My niggas up North - how we living?
How we living?
My niggas down South - how we living?
How we living?
How we living?
My niggas how we living?
Sinning, cos that's the only way we think we're winning
Killing cos that's the only language people listen to
Slinging, 'cause that's all you can manage wen you've been into
Prison, forbidden to listen
Good riddance to bad rubbish
We don't know how to forgive we hold grudges
And we don't know how to receive we throw punches
And we don't know how to believe

That there's too much drama
I feel like walking road with two straps and armour
All we care about is funds and garms, guns and arms
The best chick on your arm, the best watch on your wrist
Best watch your wrist cos them boys are
Best cop your blitz cos them boys are
Best tint your whip like them boy's cars
But I don't wanna be cocking it back and everywhere I go watching my back
I just wanna hop on a track do my thing - not put on an act
I don't even wanna put on bling
Fuck up, go to jail, get put on a wing
Got my own mind, never been put on a string
Cos I just wanna be the best
I don't wanna do shows and be in a vest

Live life to the fullest cos life can be taken away
Be careful with bullets cos bullets can easily spray
If he's ready to pull it you better be ready to react
If its knock, buck or say 'fuck' and get back

'Cause there's too much war
Some need a strap just to go to the corner store
But is it worth the stress?
Baking in a vest when head shots can take in him the vest
Take the bigger steps then you soon can take the bigger cheque
Cos wen a gun goes off in your head you will be heading for a closed coffin
I'm dreading that my time's up soon
Might die with the nines up soon
Or do something dumb and get picked out of the line-up soon
Cos I'm in two minds and I know what's wrong and I know what's right
And i know I'm strong and I don't just say this shit when I write",https://genius.com/Kano-how-we-livin-lyrics

'Cause you knew it was the only thing that mattered
And now it's time for us to go together
Without games or lies
Where you sit and watch me smoke the lonely night away
There must be something more that's left for somewhere
Something that will save this love forever

The King’s Speech,UnKnown,UnKnown,"That is the stone of scone. You are trivializing everything. (I don't care how many royal assholes have sat in this chair). Listen to me, listen to me! (Listen to you, by what right?). My divine right if you must, I am your king. (No you're not. You told me so yourself, you told me you didn't want it. Why should I waste my time listening?) Because I have a right and I have a voice!

Better than he was before...
Better, stronger, faster...

Some bruddas say I fell off, they know it would never happened
I'm forever blacking out on every rapper out, imagine
Wordsmith, first-degree murders with these verses
Perfect, you would personally prefer if I adjourn this
Nervous, certainly you ain't emergin when I'm lurkin
Verdict, I'll be returning to the scene with all the hearses
It's a motherfucking burial, my nickname's daredevil
Justin Incredible, Justin's a general
Tell a little soldier I've been accustomed to chemicals
I'll take your life before you've even done something that's memorable
It's set in stone, respect the flow
The levels won't, unless the levels grow
I'm married to this shit, bruddas tried to crash the wedding so
I lit 'em up and anybody else that tried to get involved, I'm spilling guts
It's like another episode of Wire
Run a brudda over, knife below the tyre
Machine gun MC, expect a load of fire
I can find a hater anywhere but don't admire
The truth will expose a liar, it's proof the roads are quiet
New school, say another artist's over me it's like
New school, sayin' Kevin Hart over Pryor
I'm long-life milk, I won't expire
They don't know how strong I was built, I ain't a wire
Cement between the bricks, that's why I'm...


Murda dem, murda dem
King Kano, me no concerned with dem
Cry crybaby why am I burping them?
I'm a forefather blood, I gave birth to them
I am in a toga, I am the Greek God of flow cuz
Why would I condone these low-blowers and microphone up?
I am a boss, I am a don, I am a butt, no joke blood
I am the polar opposite to rappers with no cahonas
Say, if you don't like it vulgar then pussy, go suck your momma
In a coma till she comes and wakes up and murders her own son
See, I am Coca Cola, these chasers are Rola Cola
I'm chasing, these paper robots are chasing my shadow, slow up
I'm slaying these tracks like Noah in twos, who was the culprit?
Confused? Check my folder of tunes that make you own up
Mind's right, money's still right, you donut
Just ask who can murk Jools Holland and Logan
And who can build this art in a day? I'm no Roman
Now you can put them dots together and no colon
Now who's top three ain't I in?
If it's yours re-write it again
And if I still ain't in it then kiss your daughter's forehead
And stab your fucking self with the pen, pussy
Kano got his shine back
Like Rooney got his hairline back
Some chancers got a little bit of luck
But they won't make it through the night, dead right
Dead wrong, ever big on it, E3 is on it
No-no-no no way don't make me sizzle them
If they can't take the fire then pussy get out the kitchen then
G knows I'm a Pryor, let pussies say something different
You asked for this, cause thou shall not
Lose faith in KA, artistes and carpenters
They're Obi-Wan, this Yoda
They're Daniel, son, this Mr. Miyagi, Mr. Miyagi when I smell a traitor's odour
Shh, you can never ever tell me nothing
Done this ting, you do this, I does it
Top Boy, why a nigga wanna act thuggish?
Some of them your boy can't stomach
They say the more hungry, the skinnier the stomach
I say the more bigger then the bigger was the budget
I say a man's legacy is bigger than his wallet

Fuck Intro’s,Beats + Bars,UnKnown,"Turn me up in my headphones
Always wanted to say that nigga
Fuck Intro's, nothing long
Brap, brap, brap
I'm a fucking damn Gargon
Rep east London not Harlem
Certain man that think they can't be touched, we harm them
Hard and focused on P's so I charge them
A fee for a feature, remix or a pass them
My cliques too hype to calm them
Brought up in a household where we fart and don't say pardon
Armed and dangerous kids with attitude
Like with or without your clique I will batter you
Black and blue, bones broke, fractured too
Most of you are fronters and some actors too
Give me a second I'll be back in two
I hope you got your own 2 cos them boys ain't backing you
I ain't a old you I'm old school like a gold tooth
Expensive like T-Mobile to O2
Boy you better hope I don't owe you
Cos I won't pay it back unless I really, really, really know you
I spit, I'm on the road too but less than I used to be
So there's still drama but less than there used to be
I just hold back cos press is getting used to me
My face is bait, even baiter than it used to be
I'm great usually, fuck modest all the time
I'm a fat bastard Kano ate all the shine
You ate all your lines
I made all of mine
Fake spitters try and go on ebay and order rhymes
Then they're falsing  mine, I'm apalled
You're a fraud, while you're at home I'm abroad
I'm cool with some topless girls by the pool
And then they see back on road with a tool
You don't know me at all
If you know me I'm cool
I'm so upfront you should roll me the ball
I'm slowly moving up the ladder, nearly on top
Bet there's a lot of haters hoping I fall
But I'm firm
You have to work hard to move me
I'm a young up and coming star like Rooney
You can't spit a 16 bar hot like tar
Like the kid K-A apart from UB
There weren't a lot of love when nobody knew me
Heartless and M-A-B tapes grew me
Can't forget to big up Pet G and Scooby
Sharky and all of the N.A.S.T.Y crew peeps

Fightin’ The Nation,London Town,2007.0,"[
Hook: Kano
]
Police and thieves in the street
Fightin' the nation with their
Guns and ammunition
Guns and ammunition

Late night roam the street like a fox on the road
16, experiment a little heroin and coke
Room full of coke cans, syringes
Poster over the hole where po-po kicked the door off the hinges
6 kids all living in a flat
No jobs no dough
Every dealer on his back
Mums on her own, drunk when she comes home
Days on end sleeps out and don't phone
Daddy don't exist
Such a cliche these days
So he looks up to the Gs, thieves
Whatever he makes G's take and call it a clean slate
Until one day he said he had a job for him, paid
And said ""all you have to do is wait
Outside one crib and tell me when the breader comes in
And who the breaders with and if the shit goes to plan you can earn a jib""
That's what I call quick dough
But what he didn't know that the G was a snitch
And the breaders in the crib were selling guns and cutting bricks
And he just phoned the G when the breader rolled in and told him
""He with about five man and one chick""
And next thing you know there's armed police at the crib
Sirens so loud he's tryna read the fed's lips
And what sounds like ""put your hands behind your head""
Was actually ""don't fucking move and we won't have to shoot""

Police and thieves in the street
Fightin' the nation with their
Guns and ammunition
Police and thieves in the street
Fightin' the nation with their
Guns and ammunition
Guns and ammunition
Guns and ammunition

Look how many youths have got guns on 'em, bustin' 'em
Eyes on the back of their heads, can't see in front of them
Enough of 'em, it's time to fuck with 'em
Yeah I got 99 problems and London's one of 'em
Youths have lost lives from Stratford to Moss Side
And all they care about is if they lost stripes
I ain't no preacher MC, I'm feeling MC's
But dig a little a deeper like dynamite
And I know I say some bullshit in moments of anger
And it's not cool for the fan club
Just the other day we were up late discussing Iraq
Over a glass of champagne, how fucked is that?
I ain't celebrating shit -
 
If I ain't using my status to make a change, I ain't ever making hits
A wise man told me ""Kane listen
If you want to fly like an eagle you can't fly with pigeons""
An eagle I am for a reason I am, where I am but how you supposed to make it out of East Ham when there's...

Police and thieves in the street (and it's easy to end up in a police van when they're...)
Fightin' the nation with their
Guns and ammunition
Police and thieves in the street
Fightin' the nation with their

Fuck the strings, fuck the riff
Fuck the hats, fuck the snares, this for kicks
Yo eh, Footsie where the synth go?
Fucking I need no bassline, no top line or instrumental
Really do this Jigga ting no pen and need no pencil
Dragons den, fuck a car, pitch a bar rental
Cos I hear man's flows nowadays it's like they've bought Kano stencils
New reggae reggae sauce for spitters is essential
Drip that on your lyric book and you might be successful
But give me the drums give me the bass give me the treble
Give me the rose give me the apes give me the kettle
Fans come without their chicks suckling my dick well give me the nekkle
First one rocking Jeremy Scott's with the wings I was giving em Red Bull
V8 flow fill em up petrol, raised on a track Sebastien Vettel
Jack Bauer with the Dane Bowers flow cah rude-boy that's another level
Every other nigga wanna winner and so I'm in it
Nigga fuck a hater, fuck a critic, fuck a civet
If a beat wanna beat me then I kill it
Die easy what you talking bout Willis
Really I'm so way ahead of em, show them my elegance
Them man are fake them so not my bredrins
Broke is my nemesis but no it will never win
Nuff man are gettin dough from the benefits
That's why they get gassed on tracks, like say they got racks on racks
Me Dolce plaques on plaques, make real money pay tax on tax
Try them trainers, black on black, cowboy showdown straps on straps
Fans see me and say 'Welcome back
But why the mainstream shut you out the door like welcome mats'
Sssh, I left the back on latch
This is burglary bars, bad Santa rap
So tell a prat don't gas, two cannons on me like papps on Dap's
Na Na Nai, Kill the sound boy l-l-l-l-l-lullaby
Buju Banton them pussyclart get Boom Bye Bye Bye Bye
Your with the man I been around the world and I, I die
Fly-y-y-y-y-y Amsterdam get high-igh-igh-igh-igh
Slit your wrists, I'll slip the pricks with emo's to the si-i-i-i-ide
Buy suits and ties look like Harrod's, Mohammed Al-Fay-ay-ay-ay-ed
But they put that coif on me and cut it down to fit my size
Got too much swagger, my swagger's overrated
A likkle Luis belt and Gucci scarf they not gone make it
And that is not exclusive if you pick that of the rack
When I hit that Bond St. strip stylist says quick come in the back
I told him no homo, but show me those though
There's only one of these in London, I'll roll solo
He was probably just gassing me up to buy it
Young black disposable cash don't knock it til you've tried it
We come from the uncle's, we're stunting when we can buy it
Knowledge is power but my Rolex, nigga, that's timeless
We was looting in JD's for fly shit

Like maybe we can go and see a movie this week
Shit, and you ain't even seen her move to the beat
Them skippy groupies ain't even moving in beat
Look picture this, me and you on a beach
Best seat, jet-ski, cruising with me
And the room's perfect, and there's room service
But I'll have you weak by the view of the sea
If you were with me, and we hit the boudoir
I'd fuck you up like I do to the beat
Cos there's nobody smoother than me
And ever since she heard So Sure
She was so sure
That she could get naked and I could go raw
And we could even do it on your mummies bedroom floor
I like girls that's sweet, with a little attitude
And she ain't no chief, if it's beef she can back it too
She's on point, from the shoes to the jacket too
And the backoff from the jeans is like Trina's and that's the truth
And she's even on moves and bagging food so I don't even wanna make love to you
I just wanna fuuuuuuuuck you
Like Dre and them
Buss once, buss twice then I'm on my way again
And she'll be like Kane again
I put in work for my lady-friend

We can't be wasting

Music would move the nation

Recite ""No Way"" and ""Heartless Theme""
Used to think it was MI3

From E6 to this, Hackney to Hollywood
Tottenham to top the charts, anybody could

This is for my niggers from back in the day
Outside Ministry chatting up dames
Mabel shop chicken mayo
Ain't watching weight
Watch your back cos them gangsters on blades
Dog in the booth, pull out like I'm trying not to father of a youth
But that remains back in the day
Not the type of boy to get gassed off the fame
Or the type of boy to get gassed off the change
Well, a little bit
Sometimes you gotta love some pretentious shit
Bond Street, Kane, I'm splashing today
I was rocking Dolce Gabbana before that was the way
I was wavy when you wanted waves
You were datsun-ing, you were do-ragging for days
Fashion crazy, follow fashion, nah, fashion insane
On a plane, come back, case full like I was ...
Trying to make the kind of green that only Bruce Banner would lace
Some niggas can't match with the pace
Dat dat dat dat dats my life
...?
There's no Jack Bauer nigga
C T you can't 3 me forward another hour nigga
So start living your dreams never an hour my nigga
I ain't stop because the beat stopped
I'm official I've even got my Chuck D drops
You know what time it is, Rollies and the Hublot and the G-Shock
I remember trying to make some Ps Don
Weighing up my spliffy in the weed spot

But that remains back in the day
Now me and my nigga G macking in Spain
I'm in Nigeria, Beirut and Australia
(Them times there, weren't nothing like them times here)
Niggas In Paris, yeah that shit was cray
Compare stamps in my passport in business
Been there done that, car-keys/khakis and linen
Bought more than a t-shirt, carnies and slippers
Secondary school I'm far from an infant
Sceptics say the only thing is charting that's missing
I've come so far off bars while I give in
Everybody knows the fucking realest
You're looking at too much swagger meets too much content
Blink and you miss it like Ali and Liston
Want my shoes but they can't really fit 'em
When I merk tracks its the cars that I sit in
Cos Formula 1 the master the rhythm
On my Birdman shit trying to master the business
Attack these record labels like the army on missions
Some labels got these niggas in some Ali submissions
Taking merit for a pass I'm distinction
Must pay homage I'm a Master of rhythms
Come through big Entourage like I'm Vincent
They worship my flow like my bars are religion

She'll be alright kid, I swear blind I won't inject you with heroin and I'll be on time

I went to the Marriott, coming from the Ibis
I didn't play no violin and I didn't have a sweet sixteen
I could just listen to beats and write a sweet sixteen
When I was trying to be upon the TV screen
I would see So Solid on the BBC

And I can take back more groupies than Flava Flav

I work no day, off, no play
Then party like a rock star, Kurt Cobain
With no, co-caine
Then back to work again
Radio, West End, Mr. Jerk again

No, serious fortune and both of them

I've been drinking every day yo
I don't even chase no more I drink straight

And we're the opposite from lazy
From the road ting, right to the mainstream we deya
Anywhere we go, we got the crowd going crazy
And we're the opposite from lazy

I've fucked up dances, I get them reloads
No YouTube and no Bebo

I will just peep through the peep hole
Now I kick down doors, raw like Debo

No oracle told me I'm sick
I was deep shit since Wiley had sets like
'Oi it's the paper boy, I'm in effect, directly from the L-O-N nigga E-6'

Anywhere we go, we got the crowd going crazy
And we're the opposite from lazy
From the road ting, right to the mainstream we deya
Anywhere we go, we got the crowd going crazy
And we're the opposite from lazy
Any BPM, we're the bad boys in the big LDN

She's still wearing my Rolex, see me in a dance with no set
Just a couple man, bare girls
We travel the world, some man are like stuck in the manor
Not me, I might fly with my girl
New York's like a brand new world, pounds into dollars
Double up, so nice to be British I'm honoured
Producers copy my style I get followed
I ain't bothered, got so many garms I'm clobbered
It's Wiley and Kane in the house
Too many bottles of champagne in the house
I came to buss a little Rolex sweep and a 1-2 skank like James in thouse
Got P.A's and shows all over the globe
Gonna make it rain like Wayne in the house
If I get a number one I'll have a private party
More champagne in the house

Anywhere we go, we got the crowd going crazy
And we're the opposite from lazy
From the road ting, right to the mainstream we deya
Anywhere we go, we got the crowd going crazy
And we're the opposite from lazy
Any BPM, we're the bad boys in the big LDN
Anywhere we go, we got the crowd going crazy
And we're the opposite from lazy
From the road ting, right to the mainstream we deya
Anywhere we go, we got the crowd going crazy

Any BPM, we're the bad boys in the big LDN",https://genius.com/Kano-anywhere-we-go-lyrics
These MC’s,140 Grime Street,2008.0,"I'm kicking back sipping my brandy and Baileys
On fire like Weezy F daily
Touch mic no if, buts or maybes
(Boy Better Know)
Make the fucking crowd go crazy

Look at my face, am I bothered?
Spray so fucked I'm just being honest
I don't even wanna speak on it but before you say my name, sleep on it
I be in the dance with class, drink my own drink, wear my own garms
Party like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
That's a real rockstar

(Skepta)
Them boys ain't bad like me, I got my flow locked down to a T
Take a little look around and you'll see that a lot these MC's can't MC
(Kano)
Yeah, yeah them boys can't bad like me, from the USA back to London T
Turn on the TV and you'll see that a lot of these MC's can't MC

I check the radio and all I hear is loads of little yout' MC's over the microphone
They ain't built like me, they carry lyric books but they can't MC

When I hit the road I get the show, so live-o when I spit the flow
I'm in the zone, deeper lyrics one four zero beats per minute
Them boy can't bad like I, lyric dem a fly high high to the sky
Don't be surprised when you ask me the price 'cause I'm extortionate like Toni & Guy
Them boy can't good like we, Boy Better Know it's the boys let alone
They flow straight, touch mic and set a tone
It's K-A, honey I'm home
I do my ting get the money and go
Never see them look bummy and broke
Them can't look nice like we cause a lot of these MC's can't MC

They ain't ready for this combination, we're suttin like Freddy and Jason
Better still he's Kano, so today I'm Raiden
You can never clash me with a brain the same size as a raisin
And if you can't MC, produce and mix.. Then I don't wanna hear your name in the king of grime conversation
You can't catch me I'm too quick off the mark
Think that I'm speaking for both of us when I say Lord Of The Mics was a walk in the park
Performing used to be a skill now I call it an art
Yeah we run London town, when I pick up the mic I bun London down
Promoters pay me half of the door money, them man are getting booked for a hundred pound

Upside,Method to the Maadness,2010.0,"Everything's out of time
We don't know which way
Which way is upside

The only way is up, maybe
But I've been lost no compass can't save
So many demons out to stray me
The wrong way but I ain't gunna let them take me
Out of place, out of time
If I stay out of sight I'll be out of mind
If I lose my head, I'll lose my focus
Rather lose my dough before I lose my soul
Asking me questions I don't know
I don't know if I coming or I'm going
They think they know me but I don't know them
Isolated; on my lonesome
On my Jack Jones I hit the road jack
But I didn't come back no more, no more
When you're up so high
You'll get shot down
Feet on the ground but there ain't no floor
So now I'm falling

Everything's out of time
And we don't know which way
Which way is upside
Everything's out of time
And you don't know which way
Which way is upside

I'm living in a Matrix
Agents
Missionary with no phone to run too
Impossible I'll be Tom Cruising it
The inner circle who's in it
Would you give in?
That's where the lights stay blurred
Between what's real and whats fake concerned
My frame of mind it ain't right Ive learned
Staying sane is my main concern
So I look at the world through my fish eyed lens
And everything seems much closer than it is
Up front so put your brave face on
'Cos theres a war going on outside no man is safe from
Confused with illusions
Liars, intruders
I have to deal with this
I was enthused now life is a nuisance
Finding the news
But the only thing that stayed in time was the music

Everything's out of time
And we don't know which way
Which way is upside
Everything's out of time
And you don't know which way
Which way is upside
Everything's out of time
And we don't know which way
Which way is upside
Everything's out of time
And you don't know which way
Which way is upside down
Which way is upside, down
Which way is upside, down",https://genius.com/Kano-upside-lyrics

This Is My Life (Thin Line),UnKnown,UnKnown,"There's a thin line between love and hate
There's a thin line between real and fake
There's a thin line between everything
That's why more times i don't say anything
But I'm fed up of shows, fed up of stress
Fed up of pro-mos, fed up of press
I need to find some inspiration before I'm fed up of this
Fed up of the business
Fed up of all the opinions
I'm just tryna' make my music
There just tryna' make millions
Cause I'm K-A-N-O now
Product to be sold out
A marketing plan that i can't slow down
And look how big my face is
So i can't roll now
There's a few places i can't go down
But i love the music, love the studio
Love the vibe, love the beats
But thats enough for me
The hypes too much for me
And yeh i'd love to be
The greatest mc that ever fell in
Love with bars and fucked the beat
You can't fuck with me
I'm ahead of the rest
I speak from the heart
And push out my chest
I stand for something
And you won't stand your ground for nothin
I'm real
And let me tell you exactly how i feel
Its more than a product
Its life
A product of my enviroment

This is my life
This is my love
This is my voice
And the place were i'm from
This is me
With my heart on my sleeve
Ain't nobody else but me
This is my life
This is my love
This is my voice
And the place were i'm from
This is me
With my heart on my sleeve
Ain't nobody else
Ain't nobody else but me

There's a thin line between love and hate
There's a thin line between real and fake
There's a thin line between everything
That's why more times i don't say anything
But check it
I flow deep, don't speak,i let the music
Its real talk i let the fans no what the truth is
More times i love my job
Some other times i think its bullshit
Cause the polotics and the promises
I jus dismiss myself from it
But i can ryhme when i feel like
And tall when wanno
Some artist can't even rite the songs that they want to
But im gifted an talented and far from a pop pac
And far from the industries standard
Thats standard
True no fake-up, shoot no make-up
Rite my own bars,so if i flop, its on me
I'd fuck the city, cause i got the key to the street
Thats why i represeant every day of the week
3-65 24-7
The pen is on me, i dont need any more weapons
And i love creatin so much that i even forget
That im fed up of shows, fed up of stress
Fed up of pro-mos, fed up of press
I think i found my insperation
I can't be fed up of this
Cause i dont think the nation gives a fuck if im sellin this shit
I'd do it for nephew, i'd do it for me
I d do it for my whole fam, cause they'd do it for me
I'd do it for the whole fans, i'd do it for the whole click
No matter how big
I still hold it down
I still float about
I still crawl around shit
So no matter how rich i get
I'l still be a product of my enviroment

This is my life
This is my love
This is my voice
And the place were i'm from
This is me
With my heart on my sleeve
Ain't nobody else but me
This is my life
This is my love
This is my voice
And the place were i'm from

Dear Summer,Beats + Bars,UnKnown,"Dear Summer
I know you've missed me
I know you need me like Deja needs Frisky
Ask your girlfriend, as your cell-mate
I've been spitting fire since boys love girls days
And I've been about since day 1
You know I represent on the beat for the street to the beach
And I know it gets heated sometimes
And I have to roll with the heater sometimes
Believe me I'm just speaking, but its deeper than lines
Yout's out shoot-out deeper than Shyne
Every summer ain't a tune out deeper than mine
Fuck if my gun burst, I spit hot shit
My 16's get sunburns
So even when I rhyme every nigga can relate
If they're weaving in their rides
Or they're wheeling on a bike
I'm addicted to summer like a fiend that's on the pipe
That's why I ain't fucking with autumn
And I don't like drop tops because I can't fucking afford them
You see me in a Jeep, T.I with B
Listening to B.I.G and Styles P
Just tryna get them P's up
When you come around everybody's tryna get them G's up
Few can make the olders front in beamers
And you can't make Mikita look like Crisina
Milian when it gets chilly I'm
Constantly thinking of you in my arms
I ain't fucking with winter either
And I remember when I first you, cons and Fila's
No I'm old school like cocapina
Sarsaparilla and Kool-Aid
There's no match really
I'm naff naf and illy by lilly
Cool raps just really like Biggie
First things first I poppa
Squeeze and I'll pop ya
Jesus might leave you breathing I'll stop ya
One shot I'll leave you sleeping like vodka
I'm on the road like a car crash
I'm real, I'm road I'm tarmac
And yeah I'm hardback
Flip flops toes don't cover mine
But next year summertime
NY Hummer time
It's hot so you know dogs got the gun inside
Stipclubs, titrubs and chicks to come inside
So every year I drop a new style for you
A new CD, brand new styles for you
I'll even BA fly a thousand miles for you
I love you I'll probably walk down the aisle for you
You know I'm with you 100 percent, but yes
St. Anne's you was looking your best
I meet you in London looking depressed
All covered up, couldn't even look at your breasts
And yeah I'm fucking with you summer but I rubber up
Cos I had a fling with spring break and bust a nut
And yeah I'm fucking with you summer
But I need to know
Whats's up with you summer
How comes you got the young tugs bussing every summer
How come you make sure there's stress on the street
Then hit Napa sex on the beach
Whats up with that
Yo, KA, Beats & Bars
Home Sweet Home the album '05
And every summer after",https://genius.com/Kano-dear-summer-lyrics
Dark Days,Method to the Maadness,2010.0,"Sing through the fire
Till the burning is over, is over
Sing to recover
Till the healing is over, is over

Look
I guess I've been homesick
I been on a roadtrip
I've been gone a long time
Lately I've been lonely
They think that they know me
They just know the old me
Stronger than steel, they can't shape me or mould me
Higher than a dope fiend
I'll be floating over
Over the game like Yoda, wiser and older
Hip hop went from parties, to political to vulgar
Vulgar to soulless, money's taking over
So we did it over
Whole new culture
But it went from art, to the hearts, now it's broken
Now we're picking up the pieces
But the thing is when you love it, you can't leave it 'cos you need it
Patient 'cos I treat it, kind of like my treatment
Musical therapy helps me with my healing
When my heart feels heavy or my tears they froze up
I put on a 12 inch and sing till it's over

Sing through the fire
Till the burning is over, is over
Sing to recover
Till the healing is over, is over

Look
Dark Days, hard times
Heartache, can't find
Medicine for my pain gained on the frontline
Battle scars, fight the power
Twenty-four seven, Jack Bauer
Fairytale, save the world
Superhero, Kryptonite
Devil on my shoulder
Don't listen to the voices
Infect you with the poison (the, the, the poison)
Sing through the fire like Chaka Khan, rejoicing
Girls sing, boys sing
Everybody join in

Sing through the fire
Till the burning is over, is over
Sing to recover
Till the burning is over, is over

This is my cure
This is my remedy
For your entertainment
But this is my therapy
This is my cure
This is my remedy
My musical therapy
This is my cure
This is my remedy
For you entertainment
But this is my therapy",https://genius.com/Kano-dark-days-lyrics

Until a major label comes to sign me
I'm moving out from 140 Grime Street
But you can come over this Friday
I'm throwing a party
I got tunes, I got decks so we're set for the night
So feel free if you wanna step to the mic
So feel free if you wanna step to the mic, step to the mic
So feel free if you wanna step to the mic, step to the mic
Feel free if you wanna step to the mic, step to the mic
Feel free if you wanna step to the mic, step to the mic

Start from the bottom, rise to the top of the game
Fuck that I'll never stop, or change
Got that dough, with the pop from caine
And I don't mean white or the rock
It's K to the A, N to the E or O
And I get deep with the flow
And I'm responsible for about half of the rhymes, written ever since 2005
Or 4, I'm raw, fall to the floor
And I've got the game on lock like laws
I knock, no answer, kick that down
Huff and I puff and I blow like
But I won't bite, like the big bad wolf
And you won't see me in a big bad Porsche
But I don't drive and I don't lie
And I don't give a fuck, I won't cry
If music don't sell like the 80's dummy
Cause this year I'm trying to make David money
Beckham, let 'em, no I ain't messing
Setting goals, I got 'em, I get 'em
Repping, fuck that you already know
With the flows cold, don't think you're ready bro
I'm destined for millions, I mean it when I say I'm the best in the business
I'm McVities, see the best of the biscuits
I'm larger, I'm Father to Christmas
I'm Prada so there's your answer
I'm Chrystal, his styles like Cava

Take South American chicks that look classy
Fall back before the call the federales
Call the promoter tell him eight or six
No entry fee but meta table it
I'm bringing my baby met me babysit
No ifs, buts, or maybe like Maybelline
She's crazy fit
But she's bad
Shots of Petron you know that she's down
Soon as we're on we go the twelve rounds
First Edgeware Road or maybe Mayflower
I tell 'em that's my Swarma flow
Late night cruiser like D'Angelow
Crew  no karma flow
No  Sensai I be the master though
Celebrate with my niggas like Christmas
Easters, Thanksgiving and Bar Mitzvahs
Even Divali, night-night funeral
Cos even if my nigga die we'll celebrate the beautiful
Times that he give us
But my time is with us
Pop champagne don't cry me no rivers
Tell 'em turn the lights of
Run some Beenie Man and get your wine on
Dappy told me I should live with no regrets
I'm still learning how to forgive and forget
Wretch told me that he's praying for forgiveness
Neglect when you forget it's family over business
I've got a sister that I've seen once
She was two meeting her brother in her teens
She's probably seen me on the TV
Couple of years I'll probably see her in the clubs - it's fucked
Then my nigga Demon had twins
We weren't speaking then, wish I could have celebrated with you
I'm talking about whet the baby's head
No christening, Cristal, champagne it with you
Celebrate about four belateds with you
 plan parties and then tear the list up
Cos birthdays was the worst days
Missing my nigga that was there from the first place
Go, go
It's your earth strong
Bottles in the air player, we ain't on this earth long
Party and Bullshit, get my Biggie verse on
All black everything, yeah I get my hearse on
Get my niggas wavy, yo we get my surf on

You don't like if I come with you
But chicks wanna hug me in front of you
But I don't mean to rude
I won't find me another one quite like you
I know that we become so close
And I know I'm mostly on tour with girls backstage after the encore
But I'm down for you, look out for you
Try my best to be around for you
And if you still down then I want you to know
You're the one I want when I'm gone

You know what they say..
Old dogs, new tricks, different toilet , same shit
But let me tell you something

Look I've been In a club many a time
Been a player two girls at a time
Been a brave bad boy like shine (too blind to see what you were doing)
I was involved in close, hiding with a silent ring tone
Like Jude Law in Closer
Relationship rollercoaster
My life, my real life co-star
And no doubt we coulda gone far
But I try and..STOP..coz so far
Well Dat won't Last
Move so fast spin round the track like go-karts
Over and over and over
Till a slow start I'm so lost
Cos I couldn't be what you wanted me to be
When I Couldn't Breathe I wanted you to leave
What you couldn't see
Was Me in the club wif she
Looking like my wife to be
But finally
I've grown up since then
And your eyes open up since then
Enough change so let's keep it ... Movin

This is the girl thats gon make me fall in love

Give up my life for you

Or they'll get involved with you
All the girls that gonna say the same
To play the game
This is the girl that i want

Under the canopy
My stamina be enough for Angelina Jolie
Actually I had to become a man to be the man you see
And I know your fantasy
A baby and a family with me
I know how it sounds but believe me
And if I don't know how to be Teach me

Old School,MC No.1,2008,"Ayo, MJ
Let me tell these people why I'm old school, man
I am not a Myspace MC, I'm a pirate MC
From Flava to DeJa
From Rinse to Major

Rude boy, don't watch that
When it comes to the roads, I lock that
Cause when it come to the flows I got that
Got cash, you could never try rob that
So move, the guy don't know you
That means you ain't old skool
From one pound pizza to note ball
K to the A I'm old skool

Look, I'm vocal but a lot of blokes chat a lot of breeze
But with me it's emotional, nigga I'm old skool
Like Opal Fruits, gobstoppers or screw balls
You new born babies, I'm a vet yep they know the cool
Spittin' through they headphones, no vocal booth
Look I go back like Flava FM, Tel still owes me some paper
Way before DeJa, (?) tapes with AB and the
Sound labs, no turntables 12-10's
And I was housing G, like closer than close
Till I found the MIC and the vocals I wrote
I'm so cool with my old skool shit, Adidas shell toes and my Stan Smiths
In EH with a PH, 3-3-7
From cassettes now it's my CD selling

Rude boy, don't watch that
When it came to the scene, I locked that
Cause when it come to the green, I stop that
Got cash, you can never try rob that
So move nigga, I don't know you
That means you ain't old skool
From one pound pizza to note ball
K to the A, so old skool
Hahaha niggas ain't old skool like me

Niggas know why I'm boss on the beat
Hardcore, never go soft on the street
From Boys Love Girls to London Town
I toured the world but locked London down
But certain reputations ain't deserving
Certain MC's ain't put the work in
But I had a few tunes before YouTube
And I was a known face before Channel U
From PP, wrets and EQ
In my Prada Straps and fucked Evisu's
Me and Danger Mouse but I'm no Penfold
And my intro, do I play? N-O
Look, look, that's one of my old skool lyrics
And I was in Eskimo, reloadin' it
But some MC's there were pissed I gone clear
And yeah I could win that battle on the stairs

Rude boy, don't watch that
When it came to the scene, I locked that
Cause when it come to the green, I stop that
Got cash, you can never try rob that
So move nigga, I don't know you
That means you ain't old skool
From one pound pizza to note ball
K to the A, I'm old skool",https://genius.com/Kano-old-school-lyrics

Ch-ch-ch-ch-check it
Ha, ha
Look

I get paid for the lyrics I be spitting
Huh and I get the women
I'm still on the road but my road tings different
Venue after venue lock the road ting different
But rappers get big and rappers go missing
But I'm still with the fam, popping champs at the christenings
Look, I get dough, tickets get sold
Why do you think the pretty chicks come to my shows?
Have a baby by me and see the worst in him
Cause I might do a straight Eddie Murphy ting
Look, I get paid, spend it on raves
Fresh to the death, fuck it no shave
Ey, we do it big.. Stop lying to the women
Drinking pommy rose with a firecracker in it
Look, I've blown up so I'm big time now
I eat lobster and them ting now
2-2 California rose, I'm black caught dem ting now
MC'D's? I only eat with chopsticks now
That half cooked rich shit, you can't afford this
And I don't eat pum-pum but I eat raw fish
Look, I'm insane, I'm in LA in a stripclub making it rain like T-Pain
Now 
I'm in love with a stripper
, since I used my whole spending money just to tip her
And I be on a plane like mate I miss her
Up in first class straight stroking her picture
Could of been my lady, a date for my dinner
Wait til she see the lunchbox like Linford
Look, I'm a beast when it comes to these bars
But if it's beef I come in camouflaged garms
And I just up in Oz with Boateng finest
But I can make a tracksuit look so stylish, innit!

Cause, I, I get it!
Tell Paula sent it
You can't get it!
I run UK, fuck it I said it!

It's time (time, time) We start aiming for the sky, I, I, I, I
Cause I..

Done a lot for the game, worked none stop for the game
Fire, put out a lot for the game
Now I'm on top of the game
But, there's a lot more to the game than the TV screens and the radio play
I've, seen so much in the game that in three and half minutes I can't explain
I get love for the game, got love for the game so I can't complain
If it, weren't for the game I probably would of never even travelled in a first class plane
I, followed it from So Solid, to Heartless Crew, to Pay As U Go then jumped on it
I got knowledge, now I'm in it
I'm a heartless

I fly, the flag for the UK from the MOBO's right to the B.E.T
I got no time for haters, you know KA's just doing his thing
I rock these crowds all over the world you can tell what bell my name rings
I must, make it so high in the sky to remind you you're not in my league
I bust but It's time to bust all over again to achieve my dreams
I, wanted it, from a young kid to a young man
Seen some, now I'm so on it
I promise this, I will  make it to the promised land

Nuff gal gimme more like Britney
Many more, plently more, little fishes
In the sea of women, you should see the women
Even Moses couldn't part the sea i swim in
Your floating in a pool, mines an ocean
Like I got the fucking love potion
Im hoping a nigga would try
Fuck a diss reply a nigga would die
Eat out so much, my niggers two thai
You don't want beef with us, unless its rib eye
Yeah! Ladies? Some small, some big, some slim like shady
I don't even try im lazy
And yeah I tell the barber trim, dont shape me
Walk on the set, no artist to make me
Star of the show dont ask me to make tea
Call me a pretty boy, and boy
I just hope you fucking pricks are talking about Floyd
Money fucking making Mayweather
I can make it rain in a clear summer days weather
I can make it storm in your Anns Summer
Three numbers? for me thats doing ok for you thats doing wonders

If I dont do nothing I get paid
Ill be in the studio making mixtapes
And that ain't for the money
Thats cause I get bored (x2)
And I ain't never ever come second
And I'm damn sure ain't bout to pick a day to start slipping, Never!
Im the shit niggers know what the deal is
22 and I've been spitting for a minute
No comparison to me and other spitters
Even if your death you know the difference
Listen! I dont give a FUCK!
Ill be in the club see Westwood like ""Nigga im drunk!""
And bouncers don't fuck with me, im ceased
Im banned from Cee cees
Like Weezy and Wet Willies
I skeet skeet I need me a wet willy
I spill DP on purpose I get tipsy
My CD speaks to players that get busy
Its TBC which labels gon get me
Cause its no longer 679
But its no biggy cause I spit better rhymes
I flow sickly, so grow with me
Witness me go get me ps like 50
And ye im from the block like Jennifer
Trying to make it to the top like spotlight
Everyone knows I got the UK locked
But on some Akeem shit im Coming to America

Never look back thats irrelevant

Look, I'm back I bun down the city
Bad boy and I don't run round with Diddy
Hardcore I don't dumb down for any
If they ain't ready, tell 'em buy Jamie T, cause I'm heavy
Bassline messy and yeah I go Glastonbury and wear wellies
Cause I'm a known rapper, was no phone jacker but I got the 'LCD' and it's HD ready
Look, I'm sick of the comparisons already
I listen when I square like Madison
Rent mansions don't stay in the Radisson
Any other rapper I'm bigger or badder than
See I'm in a different league, I'm a different breed
You're Championship, I'm Champions League
Back in the day I was in that champion team
Name on the back 'brap brap' like I was on stage
In a rap bout 20-man deep, next that's Wembley, 20 pound seats cause
I'm one of the best MCs to spit it
UK or US fuck the critics
You spray and you dress with no fittin'
Look, I'm the hardest regardless
See I'm on the road so they rolled out the red carpet
So cool in my Tom Ford glasses
Limelight so I shine like varnish
It's my time, I'm now you're past it
You're an MC, I'm an artist
And I'm still old school like a parting
I'm still half in, the industry half in the streets
And the mixtape market, so I'm still hungry like I'm fasting
Tahahaha, to the bank I'm laughing


Look, I'm back I bun down the ends
I come for pounds, you come out for pence
I own the flow and no doughs left
Landlord, I might come down for rent
I come to my senses early on
Now mammy's got that Hermes on, with her Vuitton
Louis, case, mortgage paid
This place I represent, these people I'm there for them
These verses I recommend, you rewind and hear again
You won't witness this again
The MC spit so quick with such sense
Such soul and success, Home Sweet Home, classic
Fucking Illmatic, addict, Kane's still at it
Don't make me prove this again
That I'm the shit I'm the best, with all due respect
But no disrespect, when you go right I go left
I'm different, if you ask me
I'm the people's champ like Ali


Look, I'm better I'm greater
Hot now, veteran later
That's why your gettin them peanuts
And I'll be gettin that paper
I'm dark, I'm Vader, no stranger, I know what grime is
I'm Legend like Will Smith where I live
Cristian D's over the eyelids
The shit we need to look the fliest
Diamond rings and no TV licence
Magnum Dom P n BT's cut off
Stereotype, fuck that I'm a one off
It's just one of the things I do
Custom tracksuits and bling my shoes
Cause I don't wanna live average, do you?
I wanna hear everybody sing my tune like
I'm gonna get that paper

Look, I make money, I make money money
I don't, take money, I make money money
I don't, make music just to make money money
I make, big money, to give money money
Hey I, I don't watch yours, so don't watch mine

Viagra flow hardest for the longest
Niagra flow pass this at your own risk
Aha their not finding the Kane
But the flows like herpes never go away
Creps like Prince 'cos they're never going gay
Without looking fresher than the rest, yes
Too many ballers not enough hits
Too many lies, not enough evidence
Too many guns, not enough bodies
Too many drugs, not enough profit
Too much Gucci, not enough receipts
That mutherfucker is a snide ... Dubai
Too many glasses, not enough champagne
Fight to a bottle thats a damn shame
Ah look, its on top for the summer time
Might hit the club again and show them how to do it right
More bubbles, no mong
No sparklers its for us not the show
Hands in the air
Chicks by the truckload
One look at us know the playing the field
Wanna sit them as the Skepta table
We need some more girls in there its not fair
Ah, its like Rambo in their
Too many man, too many many briers
Throw around pocket like they got it
And hopping into fucking Cavaliers
I don't make it rain and I got thousands in here
Dollar bills thats just like throwing pounds in the air
I'm something you're nothing
Beef I busting your ducking
Clubs I'm fucking your crumping ah
Chicks he's dumping mine jumping cars
Might treat her to some shoes and a spa
But when the clock strikes 12 she turns pumpkin ah
Cinderella freak like Missy Elliot
Says she want a Rude Boy
See me date a Mrs Ella ella ay ay
I'm filming like Kim K and Ray J
Until they put me in a grave fucker I will never take a break
And to the industry I'll never be a slave
While I work and you sleep, I spray
Thats why I'm so great, to real men greatest
While everybody rates, them others just hating
They can never say that I ain't inspiration
They say that I changed, but me I embrace it
Ah, like Barack Obama, sneak on the track Osama
Eat up the track piranha, Put east on the map Colombus
Laid back like a ganja farmer Kanes coming back like Karma
'Cos there ain't nobody rapping harder
I'm the don I the gangster father

You couldn't even ram the barbers

Touch down city take over
Might Don P or Petron ya
Rob toff chicks pissed on the outside
Stop actin' like Lisa you Mona

Gold bottle that's Cris, not Corona
Jew money cuzzy, everything kosher
Spent about four 
When my N.Y nigga fly over
I'm fly-fly, that's fly twice over
Christian Louboutins, red bottom soldier
Just copped a Porsche I might grab a Rover
And I might bring back swede Gucci loafers
Yeah brother with a buckle on the front
Silence a critic like a muffler on a gun
Front row of chicks -bars off, throw thongs
See a honeymoon like a couple in the sun
I do, I do
Blue, borrowed, old new
Bars on deck like a five star cruise
Shotgun come hear a nice car vroom
Va va voom, va va voom
Godfather flow ba-da-bing ba-da-boom
And she don't wanna leave once I get her in the room
I do magic with the stick nigga, Paul Daniels

Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

K, A to the N O
Hello to the mellow
Live band or electro
Sold 
I set goals like 
Romario, I'm hardly cold
But flows are perfecto
Soon I'mma explode
Wages like Eto'o
And I don't care if you're going gym, nigga you're wearing Ecko
And I don't care if you're going gym, your chin you can't inject those
Can they do reps? No
Old school kicker nigga, righty Nike Tempos
Get the nighty-night pillow
I'm Michael Jacko black leather jacket Bad, Sha'mon
Going down in history though
Study my balls like a fellow
Some of them are selling but no fah dem saluuuute
Can't tell my nuttin
Big man suit I'm lamb dressed as mutton
Treat them pussies like pussies, fuck em
 move to my Uncle's in Suffolk
But for real they ain't worth a response

Things just ain't the same for gangsters
What can I do for a living?
Yo, how can I eat for a living?

Yo, yo, things just ain't the same for MC's
But I'm a little too famous to shoot up M3's
But there's a lot of haters, thieves and enemies
And even in the ends there's greed and envy
It's like I can't make P's to better me cos
More money more beef, more honeys more grief
More G's the more the street keeps watching me
And I ain't got no chain, bracelet or watch on me
I got the blade and the 9 already cocked on me
And the yards armed, it's hot property
I'm going out like Scarface, no dropping me
And I can't listen to MC's there's no honesty
Only a few don't copy me, only a few
Can roll in my shoes and bop in another ends
And see why I feel hot in another ends
I heard my buddy, then got me another friend
Like G said they're wanna put me to the test
I'll kill before they're putting me to rest, I will
And fuck booking me I'm ghosting a minute, I'm chilling
And I ain't got a mill but I'm blessed
The streets is watching, heat is cocking, squeeze I'm popping
While I'm blowing up my peeps are still blotting
It's real in the ends, it's real round here
Signed a deal but I'm still round here
Blood I'm still in the ends
And I'm around dealers from 10's to 10 boxes
With big beamers and benz'
And still little pricks want to squeal to the feds
I ain't bait I ain't feeling a 10
Wheel and come again, I ain't bait I ain't feeling a 10
I'm great with a liper, nice pair of Fila's or Nike Airs
Got the three stripes on lock
I'll be Going in the office coming out with like 5 pairs
So, naturally niggers wanna hate me
Niggers see the Maharishi on me and they still got an AV
And we leave the club with half the capacity
And girls at the hotel massaging my back and feet

I'm blackberry I'm keys they can't leave without me
I'm that heavy obese with the bars

They spittin through they headphones
I go back like flava FM

Till I found the MIC
And the vocals I wrote
I'm so cool with my old skoole shit

Mic Fight,Typical Me - Single,2005.0,"We can take it outside or we can do it live on the mic
No talking, fight on the mic
We can kill 'em with knives or we can just kill 'em with style
No talking, fight on the mic

You never I could write like this, type like this
Spit fire on the mic like this
I'm like moving in the limelight, limelight
Buss him up, bruk him in the mic fight, mic fight
Picture the mean scenes, stick him in a mic fight
Hit him with 16s, I'll hit him with the mic
Stick him on sight, you've gotta defend yourself
There can't be no chickens onsite
I'm like hold up, you ain't even spitting it right
Fuck the gun talk, you ain't even living that life
I ain't even showing off, words are just flowing off
If guns ain't going off, I'm bringing that knife
So bring it this way, you won't catch life
You ain't got a 9 or cats' lives, my advice
Is for you to go home any second
Don't touch the microphone if you ain't wrecking

We can take it outside or we can do it live on the mic
No talking, fight on the mic
We can kill 'em with knives or we can just kill 'em with style
No talking, fight on the mic
We can take it outside or we can do it live on the mic
No talking, fight on the mic
We can kill 'em with knives or we can just kill 'em with style
No talking, fight on the mic

Mic fights, money and guns and women
I just kick back out my funds chilling
Write a couple more bars, slew a couple more stars
I'm live, accommodation five and four stars
Make my way to the stage, that's like a war path
It takes seconds to slew an MC like
One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three
Mississippi four, rip him if he thinks he's raw
Even if it is a draw, switch, kick him in the jaw
Time ticking, I'm swinging more than before
Three round KOs, never more than four
Kano's a heavyweight, I'll break your way Os
I weigh O's, what'd you think I'm on the street for?
I ain't blazing squad, I'll be raw
On CD, UK and C4

We can take it outside or we can do it live on the mic
No talking, fight on the mic
We can kill 'em with knives or we can just kill 'em with style
No talking, fight on the mic
We can take it outside or we can do it live on the mic
No talking, fight on the mic
We can kill 'em with knives or we can just kill 'em with style
No talking, fight on the mic

Them soundboys don't phase me, my bars make them cry like babies
We can battle for your Jacob's or AVs
Come equipped like I'm in the navy, on beef like Bisto gravy
Slew me? You're crazy
Book me, you pay me, I ain't spraying for free
You don't want a mic fight with me
Can't fight with me, might lose your left artery
So don't start with D
16s are a part of me, don't flow like an average MC
I won't stop till I'm on TV
You can't stop my Ps, 16s will give you a warning
I ain't easy like Sunday morning
Me and Kano got a fanbase forming, and I put my all in
Got a style that just ain't boring
Round Europe is where I'm talking
And you can fight me for the mic but I love warring, I'm on a war ting

We can take it outside or we can do it live on the mic
No talking, fight on the mic
We can kill 'em with knives or we can just kill 'em with style
No talking, fight on the mic
We can take it outside or we can do it live on the mic
No talking, fight on the mic
We can kill 'em with knives or we can just kill 'em with style
No talking, fight on the mic

We can take it outside, you can meet me outside
I'll be waiting outside, we can do this outside
You know that it can get mucky if we take it outside
Late nights, mic fights and all sorts, I'm a regular at the airports
I park and fly, it seems like they want me to die
I'm rolling by, I crossfire, bang bang
Getting lairy, tryna get near me, I'm like bang bang
This kid has got a problem, I've been caused to bang bang
I play hangman, control your life like it was planned
I've got the plan to make your pockets expand like spandex
Ex-girlfriends continue to make me vexed
But it's all in the mind, I'm focused
Before I touch a rave, there'll be a chance
I've gotta punch another MC so I've gotta stay focused
I know this game can make and break careers
But I'll make and take careers to the cleaners, you're just a couple preeners

We can take it outside or we can do it live on the mic
No talking, fight on the mic
We can kill 'em with knives or we can just kill 'em with style
No talking, fight on the mic
We can take it outside or we can do it live on the mic
No talking, fight on the mic
We can kill 'em with knives or we can just kill 'em with style
No talking, fight on the mic

We can take it outside or we can do it live on the mic
No talking, fight on the mic
We can kill 'em with knives or we can just kill 'em with style
No talking, fight on the mic
We can take it outside or we can do it live on the mic
No talking, fight on the mic
We can kill 'em with knives or we can just kill 'em with style
No talking, fight on the mic",https://genius.com/Kano-mic-fight-lyrics
This Is The Girl (COPY),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Intro
This is the girl that I want
This is the girl thats gon make me fall in love
Girl I would ride with you
Give up my life for you
Baby cos girl I changed
And this is the girl that I want
Uh oh oh (repeat)
Verse 1
I'm comfortable, it been way more than a month or two
It's deeper than that I roll with you
So no other chick can't come close to you
And deep down I know *the truth* notice
You don't like if I come with you
But chicks wanna hug me in front of you
But I don't mean to be rude
I won't find me another one quite like you
I know that we become so close
And I know I'm mostly on tour with girls backstage after the encore
But I'm down for you, look out for you
Try my best to be around for you
And if your still down then I want you to know
That you're the one I want when I'm gone
Chorus
This is the girl that I want
This is the girl that's gon make me fall in love
Girl I would ride with you
Give up my life for you
Baby cos girl I changed
And this is the girl that I want
This is the girl that I want
Forget bout all them other girls before
Wanna get involved with you
And the other girls ain't the same
That play the game
This is the girl that I want
Uh oh oh (repeat)
Chorus
Verse 2
Look I've been In a club many a time
Been a playa two girls at a time
Been a brave bad boy like shine (too blind to see what you were doing)
I was involved in close, hiding with a silent ring tone
Like Jude Law in Closer
Relationship rollercoaster
My life, my real life co-star
And no dialogue we coulda gone far
But I try and..STOP..coz so far
But That Won't Last
Cos I move so fast
Been round the track like Go-Karts
Over and over and over
Till the stop starts?? I'm so lost
Cos what I couldn't be what you wanted me to be
When I could breath I wanted you to leave
What you couldn't see
Was me in the club was she
Looking like my wife to be
But finally
I've grown up since then
My eyes open up since then
I've changed so let's keep it Movin'
Chorus
Verse 3
Look on the canopy
My stamina be enough for Angelina Jolie
Actually I had to become a man to be the man you see
And I know your fantasy
A baby and a family with me
I know how it sounds but believe me
And if I don't know how to be Teach me

Reebok Classics

So please don't get mad, get dough
I'm an elephant I never forget where I came from
Wrote my first bar, made my name from
Drove my Cuz car lost the plates on
Weighed my first 0 got the weight wrong
They used to roll with food and weigh o's
And I can get dark again remove the halo
Unless you're a G you can't speak to Kano
Cuz I can run through your whole team like Diego
Got the hand of God, the gift of the gab
And I don't even need a snare just a kick and a clap
MCs turn babies, shit in their pants
So please just admit its a wrap

I'm back
Back like Borat and 007
With a serve like Federer
You return like Henman
Look I kill niggas no weapons
When I spit expect funerals like you had four weddings
Verse for verse the hearses come out
Cause everything that comes out your mouth I've heard
That flow? I've heard before
The metaphors ain't yours
Them sounds ain't pushing the boundaries
Wow he's remixed the old track
Three for effort
And I don't need to speak
I just teach him a lesson
I just eat the beat first thing like breakfast
Chicks, I got the whole city wet like Venice
Call me Dennis I'm a menace when it comes to the music
New shit you never thought of doing
Them places you only see in the movies
By the way soon to see me in movies
Yeah, that's how I've been moving lately
Power like Austin groovy baby
Check mate respect the moves I'm making
I took your queen see you should rate him
Niggas so ignorant choose to hate him
If you think I'm baiding you're so mistaken
I ain't gonna lie I bring home the bacon
Sirloin steak and cooked Jamaican
Call me Gordon the black version
I'm like that person with rap verses
And I tell em all the time my tracks worthless
Without fans dipping into their black purses
So I give em freestyles for that purpose
Show niggas I'm still with track murkers
So fuck it, you can download this shit for free
But when you get your pocket money spend it on me
Its for the kids",https://genius.com/Kano-psa-freestyle-lyrics

Clubs, I go where the big boys go
You should see me, I'm like a genie
In a bottle but it's DP, the big boy rose

One month up front in case you ain't straight up
Gonna get that paper, this years gonna make or break ya
Gotta knock out albums, knock out mixtapes
And do raves for the ravers
And if you need a role model I be that
Show you how to leave models to b's flat
Show you how to keep it gangsta
Leave in handcuffs never been that

IPod Generation,Method to the Maadness,2010.0,"I don’t have to tell you things about it, everybody knows things about it, it’s a ""recession""
Governments are conservative, taxes are rising, and wages are falling
People are scared, they're petrified
The power buys a shilling's worth, a full tank costs an arm and a leg
Houses aren't even safe houses any more people aren't safe in their own homes
14 year old kids getting murdered on the street
ASBO kids binge drinking on park benches till all hours in the morning
Can’t even get on the bus anymore, they take up the whole back row listening to that “hip hop“ and “grime” noise they call music, off their faces on MDMA, meow-meow, whatever they can get their thieving little hands on
All of that while teenage pregnancy rises through the roof
We know things are bad, worse than bad, THEY'RE CRAZY!
And all you do is sit there in your open-plan living rooms talking to absolute strangers on Facebook and you wonder why your young sons and daughters aspire to be celebrities, football players and WAGs, its madness
It seems like you've given up, but I’m not going to let you give up, I want you to get mad!",https://genius.com/Kano-ipod-generation-lyrics

And there must be something you, why I'm so into you, and you know I never purposely hurt you, that's not the right thing to do
I ain't lying I hope I ain't trying to hard, but on a real I feel you
When you hear this I hope you smiling mimin' to the words humming to the violin
I'm just vibing just doing what I do best put my feelings on a beat
Make my dreams a reality, take my arse off the street
I take the rough with the smooth, I've come too far to turn back
I think we can work well together, I think me and you deserve better
I deserve yous on a first two make me feel like this from the first view
And if you didn't know then you should've known from first too
I just wanna be with you, arrive with you and leave with you
I'm feeling you so if you're taken, I'm stealing you
I like you so I'm nice to you, I'm never mean to you
I think we should be together, just me and you

I think me and you can work well together
Travel and see the whole world together, leave and eventually live together, breed and bring up our kids together
I hope we can stick together, go through all types of shit together, play chasing the whip and sing together, go through thick and thin together

I would like too see you more often,  I would like to be by your side
I wanna be a part of your life, and you can be my partner in crime
I wanna hold you, hug me back, rub my back, I'm loving that
When you're not there, I wanna phone you:
""How you doin', where you at? Oh, you're nearly back? I'm at the studio, you should hear the chat. You hearing that? Go on get your hair done and dat, get your nails done, now come""

Chung ting on my arm, that's my date for the
Night rave with her, night club like eight of us
And we shine like Mase in the
Nineties, with one of them shiny suits on
Yeah that's fire, I set the booth on
Standard, two Grey Goose and two Dom
Two brunettes, two blacks and two blondes
Huh and I get my Magaluf on
It don't make it right but yeah I'm too wrong
Girls wile out when they hear my tunes on
And new student loan, Jimmy Choo's on
I guess you can keep those on
Lift your feet up in the, air
The feelings now got making Jamelia
With a bad boy, make her a Billionaire
Boys Club tee on, that's what I spend P's on
Car full of girls, like a pocket (??)
You don't know me then turn your TV on
Look, nigga ask about me
Goons you can ask G's why the fuck I'm audi
So don't fucking doubt me, I'm raw
Top floor, Jigga next door, The Lowry
Meet downstairs at the bar, we're alcy
Shots of Patron, sending that home
I'm on the bus, 40'' TV screen
Watching a 9/11 DVD, Fuck Bush
Wait til I get my money right, I'm missing
Monty got flavour, the Red Stripe I'm sipping
Look, that's the way I are
I just spray my bars, cause I'm the best MC by far
K buy Vodka like we buy cars
Don't get it twisted like Levi's are
See me and Bio in the A-T-L
Please leave us alone by Katie Pel
See the shops stay open to make these sells
Cartier for the misses, no True Religion
A couple nice bits for the nephew and niece
Some Ed Hardy for me and I'm blessed
Now I'm set, except for the grill
I'm Double 0-7, dressed for the kill
Test me, I will show you's niggas why
I'm a survivor like them Destiny girls
I'm so out doshed it's left on the shelf
That's why I'm fresh till death, I get bills
Cause dat, dat, dat, dat, dat, dat's mine
Me and P-Money we bought the whole rail
Then brought girls back to the hotel
Nah, I'm just kidding I be writing for riddims
And the flows killing them softly like Lauren Hill
But if I ruled the world I'd free the whole jail
Except for the rapists and paedo's
I'd never come back like old key Moschino's
See though, I love black people
Cause we get cash fast and act a Jackass like Steve-O",https://genius.com/Kano-the-way-i-are-freestyle-lyrics

Same park bench, same tenants

More Than One Way,UnKnown,UnKnown,"There’s more than one way to making this money

There’s more than one to make it up, if you’re brave enough
Just don’t change for no money
There’s more than one way to making this money
Than spitting out flows on stages young hunny
There’s more than one to make it up if you’re brave enough
Just don’t change for no money

There’s more than one way up here
There’s more than one way up here
There’s more than one way up this hill I will climb up with no fear
There’s more than one way up here
There’s more than one way up here
There’s more than one way up this hill I will climb up with no fear

6 million ways to make it, choose one
A billion ways to waste it, choose none
When you get to the steep climb, would you come?
Would you run? Would you hide? Would you jump?
But the top is where you make it to the bread not the crumbs
Got yazz in the brain because the only way is up, time’s up
Now or never, dream big, succeed
There’s more than one way to make it out of these streets


Forever in control of my destiny
Know where I've been, know where I’m going and it’s legendary
All out live life to the Nth degree
Ramsay’d my own success no recipe
So F-word taking that left turn
Every hurdle and every stumble is a lesson learnt
The game’s heating up no blanket time
Head screwed on call me Frankenstein
We want the Frankincense, gold and the myrrh
The sterling, the girls in the diamonds and fur
But you won’t find three wise-men in the circles I am in
But the environment is likely that the mind sets behind, when
Everyday you’re fighting just to find rent
I found my weapon mine is my pen
But even if you don’t make it to the big screen
There’s more than one way to succeed, indeed


There’s more than one to make it up
There’s plenty of other ways to make it up
6 billion ways to make it up, just don’t change it up, just don’t fake it up
There’s more than one to make it up
There’s more than one way to making this money
There’s more than one to make it up, just don’t change it up just don’t fake it up

K to the izzay

Too Advanced,140 Grime Street,2008.0,"I'm lyrically too advanced if these knew the half of the shit I said
I would be number two to none
You see me grow from a seed to a plant
But when I was 15 I was still too advanced
But maybe that's a problem from the start, the best spitters never did chart in the past
It used to be about bars then video killed the radio star
Cause some things that I do say, is flying way over their head like Lupe
Yeah I make couple girl tunes with a new cray
Try and dumb it down, try approach this a new way
Try and break out of the prison like Sucre
Still they put me in a box like cornflakes
But it's a new dawn, it's a new day
And I ain't feeling good like a tooth ache
I feel like a chef cooking souffle
And outsold by a fucking nice pole
Hands down, eyes closed
We're better than half the Americans, don't ask why they're breading them
The past is irrelevant
It's a new day but I respect a real legend like Cool J
I blame the UK, no loyalty that's why I still will leave for the royalties
I respect that shine, that's what the soil needs
But this ground works hard like armoury
But we can't be beat
You can't defeat heart, if you talking 'bout P's then we can't compete
I'm too advanced, a proven artist, use this craft to do these bars like Cube, E's, Nas
But I could release the realist song and some kids won't get it like chicken pox
Feel free, only the real can feel me
Fuck a punchline, sometimes its the real me
And Layer Cake was the realest shit I wrote
Never made the album, the biggest ever joke
We can do with out them, it's still a mountain to climb
I try but I'm feeling like Malcolm

Two of everything like Ryder Winona
I lie on the sofa, writing I'm sober
I don't smoke weed but I like the aroma
Wanna smoke me? Try me, coma
And you can do too like Diana chauffeur
Shhh, it's a secret society we're leading it violently
Streets can inspire me but beats will acquire me to speak a variety of things

And ain't saying she ain't got a J-Lo be but them Jimmy Choo's cost an arm and a knee
They can't even be anything less than half of a G
I see her dine out try all the kobe beef then she was like 'I'll just have a salad'
And she'll be drinking apple juice in a champagne glass, standard
She said, 'I ain't got no manors' and she'll be in the nightclubs every night asking for me
She was raving with an empty Chrystal bottle
Bragging how her car don't start with a key

Love my ghetto girl with no manners
Get my Shaniqua's and Brianna's
Shout my Asian girls that went London
Ol' tight my Latina's with big back offs
Love my African queens don't matter

I'm 24/7 that's when the love outweighs the envy you're getting
Show me love too
But if you're hating on me then they fuck you

Imagine I was not now spitting on the beat
Imagine I got locked down dealing on the street
Imagine I was homeless living on the road
Imagine I was lowless sniffing up the coke
Imagine I was in beef bussing up the heat
Imagine I was in deep ducking from police

Bars for the females, bars for the hype
Bars for the album, and charge you a price

'Till you're in a foreign country
And bars they recite
For me it's never been about them cars and the ice
Nigga you don't even know the half of my life
It's not that easy, lucky, for it's not that believe me
Like, Monday, studio, bang out a CD
Tuesday, famous, slap on the TV
Nah, spittah I was just like you
But probably up earlier on verse two
Searching for words like you

Unfortunate, kids lost parents and forced to quit school just to hold the fam down
Be the man now, money's too slow fuck waiting for handouts

But people only see the crime, don't see the cause of it
Misunderstood so we lift up our hoods to rebel, like fuck the government
The teens, all they really need is some encouragement
Don't give, then they'll take it
An attitude defilement created
But I'll agree that really ain't the way kid
But if I can see, why can't they say?
I ain't saying I should lead but why can't they?
I'm out for the Queens head to represent me
But for the mean time, these lines will represent the streets
I'm out for Jesus to represent me
Cause I see what the police did to Pac and B.I.G

Hurt,MC No.1,2008,"I put in work, other spitters ain't worth
Ten pence for their words, I was bad from birth
You should put 'em in a skirt, with a pretty pink purse
I got that fire, hot shit like Jerk
I locked it like bar staff slicking
The wire, fire, the bars I spit
Tree to tree on some Tarzan shit
I merk, don't put me on a verse
Please don't do it to yourself believe me
I merk, don't put me on a verse
Please don't do it to yourself
I told you I merk, don't put me on a verse
Please don't do it to yourself believe me
You know me I merk, don't put me on a verse
Please don't do it to yourself

I got the power, this is my Austin hour
I floss material, hot for hours
I'm fire, I can't be fired
Grip the road like a Ferrari tyre
I'm flyer, LV buyer
You can see me on your LG
It's like a riot, my shields are real
Rider, popping that (?)
I hit the stage I do this well
You too so I got coupes as well
Come to my show and prove to yourself
Anytime I drop my tune it'll sell
Cause they can't understand other guys
Like the baby out of Family Guy
I'm crazy, I ain't actually high
Just think that I'm actually fly
I deliver these lines with impact when I write
Straight to the point, now my batts gonna die
And OK you're rapping alright
But I ain't practising mine
I got flows for days, bars for weeks
I'm K, A to the N i'm around where things evolved
Cash rules everything around me baby
Got my circle bun like Audi baby

I put in work, other spitters ain't worth
Ten pence for their words, I was bad from birth
You should put 'em in a skirt, with a pretty pink purse
I got that fire, hot shit like Jerk
I locked it like bar staff slicking
The wire, fire, the bars I spit
Tree to tree on some Tarzan shit
I merk, don't put me on a verse
Please don't do it to yourself believe me
I merk, don't put me on a verse
Please don't do it to yourself
I told you I merk, don't put me on a verse
Please don't do it to yourself believe me

MC number 1, K to the A
Fire, I got bars
MC number 1, London Town
The City where i'm from

I'm grime, I'm garage, I'm reggae at heart
But I can spit on any beat and fucking tear it apart
I'm like, oh that's it blue magic, kook has it
I'm too drastic, do that shit you practise
Like, so easy with my eyes closed like Stevie
Laughing at them other MC's that wanna be me
I'm real so I can be cheeky
32 still killing boys like the Beasties
And I appeal to the street and the mainstream
Cut raw riddims, hardcore like the eighties
To tell the truth, its no longer bait tease
London Town bling, look what Paula made me
Call me Gnarles Barkley, I'm crazy
Girls follow me in a bunch like the Brady's
And your pars, that's lunch for me daily
So unless you're on par get the fuck out my face please
I flow so cold I get brain freeze
You flow so old I was a baby
And you were fresh, now who's the best
Made it my tune and I didn't even do the steps

I'm the boy that's getting that dough
Spitting them verses, selling out shows
Niggas try but can't better my flow
All across that globe and that's why

It’s Me N Word,MC No.1,2008,"I'll be chilling in a taxi, listening to Blackstreet
Louis V iPod holder, I'm flashy
Styles nothing fancy, guerrilla like Banksy
Run rings round these tracks like athletes
Freeze!
It's me niggas!
Big with the bars, i'm like Swiss with the cars
Make niggas do a Van Gough when niggas hear ours
Straight cut their ear off cause they can't get a deal off
One mix tape, one show knock the gears off
Tryna eat a meal off the game you know fully
I smell, I smell, I smell, pussy!
I was doing this over beats by Nookie
And this years still my year, take that to the bookies!
Oh shit, what's happened? He's back like gammon
I'm Lewis Hamilton on the track, no McClaren
Straight Van Damme 'em, fucking back hand 'em
Over crowds piece, still getting back handers
Deep like have 'em, find 'em like Prodigy
I left my label, no body's dropping me
I heard the tape too, sounds like quantum leap
Back in times, err they might as well copy me
Do shit properly, the yout dem are copping me
There's a few on the level but they're still bottom three
Straight up relegate a nigga
I'll develop your flow, I'm the renovator nigga
You be up, up and away like an elevator nigga
But my money ain't straight yo yeah I'll take your bimmer
Yeah I sense inherited, they leave you a squiller
Then I'll be chilling in your Ibiza villa

Hustlers,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Since 15 I was in the game
I was on the air yeah I was on the waves
I was doing shows I was on stage
I was tryna get that big boy pay
But more than the money it was for the name
Plus I had the talent to match my brain
I was on Radio once a week when I found 'that's Kano'
I was on Raw, I was on Flavour
I was on 'Vu, I was on Major
I was like you but with a little bit extra
Went from a deep MC to a veteran
With direction we can make P's with no weed possession
No election chose myself, I'm a dealer here's te life I've dealt
We don't need no crime where we're living
Youts nowadays are selling grime for a living
Cause we don't need no more hustle when we roll
Boot full of mixtapes fuck the Po-Po
Cuase I'm a hustler, I'm a hustler
In the studio all day it's rough you know
I'm a hustler, I'm a hustler
Tryna do it the hard way its tough you know
Now I'm 22, still in the game
Still getting better, still getting played
Still getting beats for cheap, E's for D's
Break it down or piece by piece
Flood the street, come to me
I'm a hustler Kano run the street
I got the lines on lock, fire like I got the 9 on clock
Brap, nigga duck down
I got the hot 16's right now
Thats why they don't like me
They try and bad mind me when Kano comes to town
But now, they'll never catch me slipping
Cause I'll be cooking product in the studio like its a fucking kitchen
We don't need no crime where we're living
Youts nowadays are selling grime for a living
Cause we don't need no more hustle when we roll
Boot full of mixtapes fuck the Po-Po
Cuase I'm a hustler, I'm a hustler
In the studio all day it's rough you know
I'm a hustler, I'm a hustler
Tryna do it the hard way its tough you know
365 for the rest of my life
Eery day I hustle like a Rick Ross rhyme
I got food if you're interested
If you would have invested
You could sell these hits and never get arrested
You could take this shit but you might get affected
The flow so addictive, beat oh so ecliptic
Respect it and you can lead a lie worth living
Ths shit right here can be your road to the riches
We don't need no crime where we're living
Youts nowadays are selling grime for a living
Cause we don't need no more hustle when we roll
Boot full of mixtapes fuck the Po-Po
Cuase I'm a hustler, I'm a hustler
In the studio all day it's rough you know
I'm a hustler, I'm a hustler

Don’t Know Why,UnKnown,UnKnown,"This is Kano you should know my name
Yeah I make beats but flows my game
And I ain't got no G-Unit, piece or my home crew ain't got no fros and chain
It's Kano like I said before
I can spit rock grime hip hop and more
I seen old school fall to the floor
But I'm a (badger?) and I get raw in the war
It's Kano let me say it again
K-A-N-O let that stay in your brain
If its a good flow then it must be Kane
I ain't normally this boasty I must admit
I write songs but I hustle a bit
So I ain't got a problem with busting a lip
And I already bussed on the road
So bussing mainstream ain't nothing old
I know I'm bait but I get tempted time and time again
But I know I ain't got no time for fucking playing games
Cos if I'm on crime but I write rhymes then I'll go either way
And I don't know why that I'm so blind that I can't see the way
I can't see the way
It's Kano you should know my name
Yeah I make beats but flows my game
They don't like the way that I rolled on the road
Roll in the club like I just rolled in off the road
Roll out with rich chicks that roll in the golf
(12345 to much gash Timmaah!)
Free chicks (?) some on the road
Kano is about to give them something to blow
And when (?) theres something went wrong
Wait this is your week why would I be dropping you home?
Look if you're not dropping your clothes then showing us toes
I'll keep hold of your phone and we're robbing your golf
Jack (?) telly and land line phone, DVD player and remote control
Now we're on the motorway heading for home
Looking ever so bait on the A4 road
Bait (?) end of my face is flames
Please tell me why I'm still playing games
I know I'm bait but I get tempted time and time again
But I know I ain't got no time for fucking playing games
Cos if I'm on crime but I write rhymes then I'll go either way
And I don't know why that I'm so blind that I can't see the way
(?) that's a big step for me
And I will make mistakes so let me be
Yeah I will bring thugs to the set with me
And they take home clothes they was meant to leave
So what if I can't behave myself
I get in so much shit I amaze myself
My names Kano I know you heard of me
Yeah I make beats but but...
I got a way with the ladies, a way with my words
Up, down, right through that's the way I prefer
If I don't sell jack then I'll be on the curb
Cause I don't give a crap about being commersh
I know you've already heard the flow
Cause I've been on the grime scene getting reloads
When in doubt raves still getting dough but i still treat dough the same
If I don't act right then road's to blame
If I hot up a promoter that don't want to pay
Cause I don't want a cheque I want cash today
If you told me invoice I might smash your face
I'm underground please believe
I just want the piece and scrap the fame
How could I ever change over change
I'll never change I'm the same, Kane
I know I'm bait but I get tempted time and time again
But I know I ain't got no time for fucking playing games
Cos if I'm on crime but I write rhymes then I'll go either way
And I don't know why that I'm so blind that I can't see the way
I can't see the way",https://genius.com/Kano-dont-know-why-lyrics

A Lot,48 Bars Vol. 1,2008.0,"Recording it? Cool
Hey  hey
Check...  it’s KA
Yoo
It’s Kano in the house
All  I got is 48 bars for you fuckers
140  Grime St. soon come
Hahaa
Let’s  go...
My rhymes are a lot
Kids run around say they like me a lot
I don’t give a fuck if it’s fire or not
You  write in your room, I write on the spot
You’re right on the spot, I’m writing them off
Rambo bars I can rifle a pop
I unlock the third bar, switch to a new rhyme
And bring back with the fourth then swap
I play [?}, if I’m lying then I’m dying
I was technical but they was one lining
They was like “Yuut I’m a bad man yuut”
“Blah blah blah I’m a bad man yuut”
And I was like “See me and I ain’t with my crew”
Nobody could of wrote P’s & Q’s
Bars I smoke mad like cheesh up on Edgware
Roll down the top, see you when you get there
No I won’t see you when you get here
I be upper notch can’t breathe when you get there
When the altitude, the lines you were air
That’s when you know that you got clear
And it’s rare but its no accident
How I entertain like Maximus
Can I go for the neck like Dracula’s
Best you don’t protest like an activist
So if your not entertained
Fuck you niggas that’s not into Kane
I’m not into fame, I’m into paid
Extravagant, I’m not into plain
One wheel caps, I’m not into train
Consistent, I’m not into change
I’m in the lane, buy you aside
I’m riding your whip with no licence, I ride it
I’m in the game like EA 
Might pass through a couple clubs do a PA
I’m the scenes MVP like NBA
KA, don’t spell my name with a ZA
Sixteens murder them with no delay
I ain’t even heard of them
So Big your game, Jig your game
Wig your game, Slick your game
Rich your game, this shit a game, live the game
I have, I am The One no debate
They ain’t got no back bone like a fillet
That’s why the yuuts on the road can’t relate
Nigga I’m known from the road to the estate
Make no mistake I’m so fire
You can sell me in a shop like a lighter
You’re a fake version of me like a Chrysler
I’m a Bentley GT breeze by ya
The real deal
See ya
And I wouldn’t wanna be ya
Hey it’s KA

Man I'll be riding that Coupe
Put my hand up and show them I'm telling the truth
Riding that Coupe
Man I'll be riding that Coupe
And probably just swerve or something coz I'll be turning left on that curve or something
Riding that Coupe,keep getting dreams of myself with an Bentley and spinning that whip
Yeah that's the truth
Had to go tell em to stay on the loop
Ey i should never listen to these critics who keep telling me
That I will never Make It coz I'm tired of having that Conversation
Lemme fucken show them that they're so Mistaken
Stop sleeping and be Awaken
KANO is the fucken King
Told my mama that Ima buy a whip
I just find it funny how she found it funny
When I finished eating on that sushi I just start chilling and rub my tummy
Kiss my ass If you still behind me
If you don't hustle you a lazy Dummy
I don't chase Hoes I only chase Money
That's one thing,you need to know bout me
I know One Day I'll get paid I mean
My talent will never get taken from me and I don't give a fuck wad they say bout me
They don't really know wad I've been Thru
Things that happened in my Life made me see that can and I'm strong when I need to
Yeah this is my lifestyle
I think that deserve a fucken High five
As I'm looking at my timeline
Says I'm too creative for a 9-5

See my aim is to take over the Game homie
Mama bought her whip and she put my name on it
Talking bout Bubu M
They were like Im the Man
But when I buy mine ill just put it out on Instagram
Feel the Power Feel the pressure
Every question has an Answer
So don't wonder why I take chances  desperate times call for desperate measures
I got Hit coming on the way you should listen and call them Anthems
And stop throwing these silly Tantrums
I'll make you disappear like a fvcken Phantom
Check my vibe it'll say I'm too Lit
I don't have to trip unless I have to full split
You know lame so stop acting like a cool kid
Talk is cheap don't say it man you can't prove it
I'll be riding in my fucken Whip while you nikkas still ask for lifts
