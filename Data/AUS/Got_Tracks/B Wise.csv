The Key,Area Famous,2018,"Uh
Let me start out with a question, let's treat it like confession
Can see that you been stressin', tell me, are you okay?
Every day has been a lesson, been prayin' for a blessin'
But nothing ever changes so you hope for better days, yeah
Ask me about where I been,  been at war, I been battlin'
Placed some bets that I cannot win, come for air, I need oxygen, Lord
This ain't on TV, nah, this ain't a dream
Made it out, now we're chasin' greater things

'Cause I been down for a minute, but I had to bring it back
The world is like a dog and best believe that we the cat
If you feelin' isolated, a loner even, try
A little bit of love will be the key and that's a fact

I need your love, baby (hey)
Can't get enough, baby (yeah, yeah, yeah)
We want your love, baby (love)
I need to know ya, I need your lovin'

Yeah, I think I'm goin' love crazy, but I ain't just talkin' to the ladies
Human touch that I'm cravin', lost that, this life that I'm chasin'
Told myself I want greatness, on the wall I had the Mercedes
But how times can change, 'cause now my baby wanna have a baby, I'm like
""Hold up, wait a minute, I'm still out here chillin'""
She like, ""Hold up, wait a minute, I need some commitment""
I'm gon' come back and give you the love that you want
But for now just have my back until we take off

'Cause I been down for a minute, but I had to bring it back
The world is like a dog and best believe that we the cat
If you feelin' isolated, a loner even, try
A little bit of love will be the key and that's a fact

I need your love, baby (hey)
Can't get enough, baby (yeah, yeah, yeah)
We want your love, baby (love)
I need to know ya, I need your lovin'

They say you're a dreamer until you get on
But then when they see ya they try to get some
Even though that I need ya, 'cause your day one
I need your love, yeah, I need the lovin'
They say you're a dreamer until you get on
But then when they see ya they try to get some
Uh, you my day one
I need your love, yeah

Check it out, check it—
Out, one two, one—
Two, all right, all right
Hey, yeah

Everything I did, man, I gotta be proud, had to keep up when they kept me down
Proved myself, man, I did those rounds, now I wanna be claimed like a lost and found
Word is  make this pact, when it come to you never turn my back
'Cause a little bit of love would be the key and that's a fact

I need your love, baby (baby)
Can't get enough, baby ()
We want your love, baby ()
I need to know ya, I need your lovin'
I need your love, baby
Can't get enough, baby
We want your love, baby
I need to know ya, I need your lovin'",https://genius.com/B-wise-the-key-lyrics
Feel Something,Area Famous,2017,"I just wanna feel

I've been telling 'em for years I don't think they don't pay no mind, 'cause there's people that don't get me yet
Two-one-seven-oh,  raised, mind frame the same, catch me on the set
Six boys in a five seater, no rego, but you know we got the drinks on deck
Cruise past paddy wagons, everybody be cool, 'cause they haven't left the area yet
Yeah, that's my cuzo, that's my brodie, that's my best friend, that's my G
If we up to no good and they ask me 'bout it I can't see
Put me on that stand, so I can take that oath and swear to Christ
God already knows what I'm like, so I might just tell that lie
Crusin' round till we get in strife, on repeat, yeah, we pumpin' Scribe
Not many, if any, I know a couple motherfuckers not ready

These are the days that I could never trade for nothing
We just young and dumb, hustlin', always getting into something, Hol' up

We standing centre stage, spotlight
We go from night to day, all right (we do it)
We vibin' off away, and I might
Pull up to the spot, put like fifty on my 

I just wanna feel, feel, feel, feel something, yeah
I just wanna feel, feel, feel, feel something, yeah
Pour it in a cup and spill, spill, spill something, yeah
That there is my blood, we fear, fear, fear nothing, yeah

Remember we were little brothers listenin' while the big homies talked
Now that we the big homies, calling shots like the boss
And we were area famous, black and white like the Raiders
Just for kicks we used to cover power lines with our trainers
Now the whole area's changing, you can tell by the faces
Man, I just seen my neighbour, he said I looked like a stranger
We used to post on the lawn and pump out tunes to the dawn
Bone Thugs-n-Harmony  all their songs
Then we would hit up the party, who get it, who get it started, we had the, we had the, uh
Everyone acting retarded, who got the hardest? Guess I just got it from 
Now I'm swimming, swimming, swimming, swimming in this world of bliss
And I really, really, really, really, really can't feel my lips
Uh, too many back to backs, we were crazy, that's a fact
Now it's time to settle down and move like Jigga, fade to black

Those were the days that I could never trade for nothing
We were young and dumb, hustlin'
Always getting into something
Hol' up

We go from night to day, all right (we do it)

Redfern, Cronulla to Macfields

Racial tension in the city it was getting high
Wasn’t from the area but we were always down to ride

Talk about base, i’m the man on the ground
You had a problem, call your man I’m around

Lead the Way,Area Famous,2017,"Said it’s time to wake up, last night was way up
Mummas in the kitchen and she cooking up that bacon
Man I gotta take her, gotta go and stack this cake up
Imma be late so don’t wait up
So when I say see you later
I’m a beast when it come to this I do it by myself
Or when I’m with the clique
My timing on the watch I check the wrist
We work when they party, that’s how we live
Told you put your faith and trust in me
Home top, that’s where we really wanna be
Secure a plan to feed the family
Sincerely yours Big brother B

I make a promise to you, I’ll make you see
Let me lead the way (the way, the way)
Let me lead the way (the way, the way)
Let me lead the way (the way, the way)

Uh, moneys always on our mind, stress
Patience is a virtue, good things come to those who work
Let’s change the lesson, we been taught to fail ever since the beginning, now we’re winning
Thats how my sisters act no all happy days, the song we’re singing
Wind in our back, full sail ahead, when everybody else just keeping up
Late nights in the studio, beats in the club
Like bees in the trap, never easing up
I’m going for my, give me my space
Ain't supporting then get out of my face
You don’t like the words in my songs, wasn’t meant for you in the first place
Well this raps gonna be the blueprint to life, how things can change if I really get it right
Hooped in the range and I wanna get inside
We work for days didn’t happen overnight
Keep the fam close, stay grounded still
Wanna lead the way, then you gotta keep it real
I made the promise, always gonna break like steal
And still, and still

They wonder why I’m living like this
I don't care, tell ma just what it is
I don't care, tell pa just what it is
I know why I’m living like this
They wonder why I’m living like this
I don't care, tell ma just what it is
You can't tell on me, you my little sis
We came up together more then ever
I put you on my shoulders, lift you up
You looked at me just like like your biggest brother
We hold and fought the fam to keep the love
Everything we did was sacrifice
You did the crime, you know I took the time
The eldest born you know the sacrifice
I put that on my life won’t tell the lie

And you know that I want it, I’m coming correct
And it’s on me, me, me to find a way to your heart
And best believe (leve-leve) I’ll be the light in the dark

Say welcome to my world, you know the one boy meets girl
Hope it’s like a fairytale, born in a wishing well
But if I’m gonna wish for something
It’ll be me you loving
Give you my time like it’s nothing
Tell the whole world we coming
Fly over the moon, over the sea, she be the sky
I be the breeze, kid so shy, birds and the bees
Can i take five for the girl of my dreams
Take a few shots in the back
Lay my life down on the line, never knew I do that
All my friends say when I gonna take you to the alter
Shit just where point where dat
Lil’ momma I came up just to be dud, nah so I had to bain up
But the old me, was a cruel me, had to do me
No one ever knew that I would change up
One day I will tell this story
Will it trade for the gold and the glory
And if this is a dream
Don’t wake me in the morning

Tell me what have you done for me lately
At a stu all night actin’ crazy
Every time I hear the same excuse
Tryna make cash money like baby
She please don’t just waste my time
You know I had you down since you were one-nine
I ain’t gon’ fight with you over no girl
This ain’t the song and the boy is mine
Plus I gotta give a little respect
With a little bit of love on the next cheque
Then you wanna go to the islands, look good on the gram
You ain’t been yet, so you know I gotta take you there
Matter fact we’re gonna make it there
First time in designer stores, we’re getting lacy heels
Two kids from the south-west don’t know how to act drop change
I swear if thats what they call love, let’s tick all the above
As we fight then we fuck, cos we can’t get enough
Don’t even like to call me James, she just call me B
Might mess around and probably plant a seed

Cos’ you got it the best, always party the rest
And you know that I want it, I’m coming correct

Shout out to all the boys man (yeah), all my ladies and shit
Free money and scrap (yeah)

I see the people round here
But where you been, I was nowhere to be seen last year
They want to know about the form and how developed the star
And then the blogs get it talking like I threw in the towel
Get that negative talk from round me, like I’m down and out
Feeling like Jigga in his prime, so ask about me
Im on my smoking nigga ciggy shit
Plus got them kerosene dream, got the city lit
You just a little fish swimming out of water, wedding my future daughter
Tell me what we got outta be working so I afford it
And if the problem won’t stop, tell the problem i’ll solve it
I guess I’m good for anybody, i’ve been out of order
I’m an S-Y bully keep the D for Pussy
No they ain’t gon’ like It but they can never shush me
Once tried to lock me out, but now we holding every keys
Swinging doors tell them watch their mouth

Man it feels so good, I mean it feels so good
We been working for a minute, I think we finally here now bro

I never thought i’d see myself on the road doing shows
Making more for thirty minutes then I did from nine to five
Now the numbers adding up, subtract stress from the cut
Now i’m finally taking care of me and mine, that’s what up
And that’s a grown man situation
You can miss me when tryna change the culture out here, like assimilation
Do your research, i’ve been there I’ve done that
Ive fell down, I’ve came back, I’m still here so can’t stab
Now it’s all about bags, got cash, i’ll call back
If it ain't bout that then miss me with your chat
Cos i’ve been out here hustling every since snapback
If you scope ain't that wide you might just fall flat
I made it on my own brodie
I stand tall on my own brodie
Now i’ve seen it all like a tour roadie
Came from the bench, i said it along
I can never be the last one standing all alone

The Roast (Interlude),Area Famous,2018,"I was speaking to Wise, actually, the other day
And, um, we were talking, this is when we were young
We were at my house, at my crib playing PlayStation
Man, whooping his ass, you know how it go, bro
Tekken, Mortal Kombat, whatever it is, man
Whoopin' him, whoopin' his ass
But anyway, a bit of a get together at my house, man
'Cause my sister always had, like, mad shorties, like, older than us
We were young, me and Wise were hella young
And I remember, man, they were always looking at this guy like a snack and shit
And one day we were in the room playing, right
We playing, right, so the door busts open
Next thing you know, bro, got like two shorties walking through
And just start hooking up with Wise, bro
(Oh, you finally got here, huh?)
Oh, man, Wise, I was just telling them how
You were like a ladies' man back in the days, bro
Nah, nah, don't do that, man, you're lying, bro
You're lying
I see you got some ladies here, though, what's happenin'?

(And your girl's here too, what the fuck?)
You got exposed, got that whip

You shoulda told me there was some ladies around
Ain't none of my business, man
How's workin' though, man?
It's workin', man, I'm trying to get something
Trying to get this paper, huh?
Trying to make something, bro
Sitting here with you, bro, Dunlop 94 havin' ass
And I'm with you, man
It's like, yo, man, I'm thinking about getting matching Benzes
(In 10 days?)
No what did he say?
(Man, he said if he I gave you matching Benzes in 10 years)
Was it 10 years?

No Questions,Semi Pro - EP,2016,"Look where we are
Look where we're going
Man, look where we came from
Back then you had to raise your son like a soldier
You definitely made one
Where I got my name from, Eagle of God
So I pray to the lord
Hoping the letters in my birth certificate brings me closer with my knees to the floor
After grandpa died, well soon I would notice a change
Your boy was becoming a man
But the man became a bigger boy all of the same
Life of an adolescent, doing things that were never tested
I was learning on the go, theory nothing like practice
How was I to know?
But we would have mad fun
When I lived on Gladstone
Can tell I'm my dad's son
'Link with the boys and we get into something
And fucks? We never gave one
Was this the way I was brought up?
Well my mum would kindly disagree
If you see how I was back then, you'd wonder now how I got a degree
Senior year man, that shit was great
High school was only a place to congregate
Out on the oval, lookin' for the bitches
We were just young and being misogynistic
Skinny brown boy, afro real frigid
Provin' to the lads this chick I can get with
Nerdy blonde thing, behind the demountable
Got my first biscuit, damn
Then I got my first real girlfriend after
I'm a big man so I'mma go harder
I was 19, she was 24, had enough of materialism and she wanted more
It never really mattered I was younger
All that mattered is I came with that young love
I was fascinated, infatuated
Until I heard she missed her time of the month
Wait. Wait

If I could take it back, I would live with that
And do it all the same
No questions
If I could take it back, I would live with that
And do it all the same
No questions

Yeah you ain't gonna like it but I'm just tellin' my story
So many reasons and factors I'm here that I just can't take all the glory
Remember the time we got locked in the fishbowl, the racist police were provoking
And in Liverpool if you had the wrong phone you'd get rolled, and sometimes we were rollin 'em
Thankful to Staff for showin' us raps
Me and Young Glove we would write in the kitchen
Thankful to Gasm for giving me beats
No one  was gon' show us the vision
We were just four young brothers rebellin'
And back then they block us but now they all listen
Afro-Australia's making a name
This stage is my slave, and this mic I'm just whippin like
Coming from the underground
Now they gon' see me around
Know that your boy got me holding it down
These critics and blogs they in love with the sound
Yeah from day one, the way that I acted, the way that I talk, wondering where I'm from
You can assume about me all you want
Just listen to all the lines of this song
I hope that they get it, cause me I'm a menace
On beats I'm a villain, this flow I'm relentless
Very best guidance I ever received
""Keep it one hundred and remain authentic.""
That's what I'm doin', I'm a stay true and
Live my life, paint a picture for your viewing
If this was a movie, I am the producer, the star, the director, to tell you to start and stop shootin'
Goddamn

If I could take it back, I would live with that
I'd do it all the same
No questions
If I could take it back, I would live with that
I'd do it all the same
No questions

No

Hit the  and get dressed as I'm yawning
Rage is on in the living room
 I would take five
You watch your idols on the TV screen little do you
Know what they were getting into
Do you? Glorify money, women, and the weed
It's all a young nigga really need
And that was the saying engraved on my brain, so
Subconsciously carry that attitude around 'till this day
Now it's getting real, the problems really starting
Too many new faces, all my old friends departed
Hotel parties on the 35th floor
A bunch of hipster women that I have never seen before
A rowdy group of locals, they about to heat the plate
Got a flight in the morning and I don't wanna be late, aye

We know temptation, but we never know peace
I see all this liquor yeah, we 'gon get it for free

Now everything is all free roll a 20 take a hit, uh
Yeah this is real fucked up man
This is real fucked up
Lord, please shine a light up on me
You gave me eyes, tell me why I can't see
The devil's wearing  in the V.I.P
Accompanied with friends, we 'gon need some I.D
This is really not me
This is definite not what I signed up for
I'm content with my position, figured that I want more
All the vices of entertainment are at my front door
How much am I willing to lose  why can't I afford

Risk It,Semi Pro - EP,2016,"The way that she got that clapping
The way that she clap, clap, clap
Backwards, slap, slap, slap
Face me, dab, dab, dab
I'm playing, ha
Okay I'm back

Look, surely you heard about me in a way that I kill it from the get-go
I've been working over time
Like 9 'till 9, I gotta pay rent though
Going back to my old area
People saying they ain't seen me in way since 
Mother fucker I've just been getting jiggy with it
Call me the Fresh Prince
Trying to be the best that I can be everyday is starting to take its toll
Getting it in like a finger roll
Need some relief, Panadol
Call up the boys who gon' call up some girls who gon' call up some friends
And we all pay the cheque
Medicinal smoke and got liquor on deck
Have a night tomorrow we gon' regret

Hey, can I take a risk, take a risk with you
We should be together, it's just me and you
You've got no idea on the week I've been through
This is what I wanna do, you know what we came to do, and that's

Risk it all, risk it all, risk it all
Risk it all, risk it all, risk it all
Risk it all, risk it all, risk it all
Risk it all, risk it all
Risk it all, risk it all, risk it all
Risk it all, risk it all, risk it all
Risk it all, risk it all, risk it all
Risk it all, risk it all

Slow it down a little
Slow it down let me catch my breath
The way that you moving that body is crazy and i can barely keep up with you my lady
And I've had to many I can barely hear what you said
Look, but I say to come and get it
Honestly I don't get it, man things change in my city
Feel like I've been gone for a minute
 died,  comes in twos
What's in my drink? Been feeling like ""ooh""
Never have I had a feeling like this but
I'mma take a risk and let this shit do what it do
Let's stop dancing around the topic
I'm a new wave, you're just carbon copies
And honest that is sounding right
That chick gon' wanna come back to mine
Ego popping, blame it on the high
I just wanna elevate my mind
So I can go and simulate my crimes
Music matters 'till the day I die

Hey, can I take a risk, take a risk with you
We should be together, it's just me and you
You've got no idea on the week I've been through
This is what I wanna do, you know what we came to do, and that's

Smile,Semi Pro - EP,2016,"Yeah I'm gon' show my smile today
Let's go the extra mile today
Been down and out since yesterday
No point waiting on the better days

Man I'm lost for words to say
I wake up in the morning wondering what bad news I'm gonna hear today (I don't wanna hear that shit)
Good luck, I need some justice as much as I need water
You never know what life's gonna throw when you turn that corner
Hold on, hold on, I jump on the internet
A fan of mine says ""why he killing that""
But why do I feel so down when everyone around me says  we gon' be on next
Because your phone bill is still overdue
And your landlord is still chasing you
When more money going out than going in while you're chasing a dream
What would you do
And when your past comes back to haunt you 'cause you live life reckless
'cause every action has a consequence and I don't know what I expected
But if things can't get any worse
I'm not gonna sit around waiting for change
I'mma go change my own like create my own vibe

Yeah I'm gon' show my smile today, hey
Let's go the extra mile today, hey
Been down and out since yesterday, hey
No point waiting on the better days, hey
Yeah I'm gon' show my smile today, hey
Let's go the extra mile today, hey
Been down and out since yesterday, hey
No point waiting on the better days, hey

'cause when it rains and it pours
 of storms round here, get lost round here
Walk up a hill with the weight of the world on your shoulders
Could you last round here?
Spend a little time in my size ten
Forget the intro we could dive in
And see that everything I do is for my family
I would crush any form I can
Got the Navman, heading to easy street
But I must of missed it
Even though today was hard, I look for tomorrow and stay optimistic
There's no hand outs from the place I'm from
You gotta work hard from the day dot one
And I'm not gonna blame him or her for this
I'm just gonna give my attitude a switch

Yeah I'm gon' show my smile today
Let's go the extra mile today
Been down and out since yesterday
No point waiting on the better days, no
Yeah I'm gon' show my smile today, hey (I'm gon' show my smile)
Let's go the extra mine today, hey (I'm gon' show my smile)
Been down and out since yesterday, hey (I'm gon' show my smile)
No point waiting on the better days, hey (I'm gon' show my smile)
Yeah I'm gon' show my smile today, hey (I'm gon' show my smile)
Let's go the extra mine today, hey (I'm gon' show my smile)
Been down and out since yesterday, hey (I'm gon' show my smile)

Roll Call,Semi Pro - EP,2016,"Eh, ooh, it's getting hot
Someone take off the kettle
I want it all, I would never settle
Hone my style while you rent a rental
Flip the script and now I'm on the level
Hold the city like I'm made of metal
Everything's planned, not coincidental
Position the clutch while I hit the pedal
Just cover your ears if you're sentimental
Making wishes like I had a genie
To be the greatest like my mom Stephani
Make the same thing go really
The sky is taking to Micky  oh so quickly
But they're reacting to this
But I've been practicing for this
'Cause this rap thing was the biggest club
And I was never on the list, so, well
I'm really not taking the piss
Let me tell you one time, you're not fucking with this
Now all these webcam rappers all look at this
But you know I make songs, never make a diss
Girlfriend like ""what you spend your dollars for""
But why the fuck you looking at my  for
I just want you  like a door-to-door
And see what you hold in that  door
Ah, but it's about time we made our time
When it come to rap this is game time
Going up the  like a gang sign
Going on the same beat with a different mind
So I have to come with a new vibe

Now that I'm here, we ain't going nowhere
We'll be right here, with you, and you
Tell the world, tell the world
Roll call, roll call, roll call, roll call

And I'm the -full magazine
Everything roll, no sensory
Say what I want, there's no sense in me
Everything's changed since I hit the scene
Hold on the album, drop the EP
Fuck what it costs, put it out for free
Alone in the market monopoly
Aye, man, I can not wait to get on, bro
I can not wait to get on, someone pass me the baton
I'm gonna keep working all night
No more  I'm gonna chop 'till it's filet mignon
With gold on my neck and my wrists
If you ain't gonna call about how to make this money
I'm gon'  my phone like something is wrong
Eyes on the throne, I've been waiting so long
To eat like an animal, call me King Kong
Nothing is given out, you gotta go out and get it or learn how to fight where I'm from
Aggressive without a doubt
Semi Pro sound, yeah we in the house
Food that you want, call it In-N-Out
And if it ain't that, what you talkin' 'bout, oh yeah

Now that I'm here, we ain't going nowhere
We'll be right here, with you, and you
Tell the world, tell the world
Roll call, roll call, roll call, roll call
We'll be right here

Uh, yeah yeah
So, eh
Say no no no
What if I say yeah yeah yeah
Say no no no
What if I say yeah yeah yeah
Watch this

Yeah, I just wanna take a quick second to say thank you if you made it this far listening to the Semi Pro EP. And I wanna give a bigger shoutout to my brother Dopamine for staying up and all the late nights we spent working on this shit. And everyone who has been a part of my music journey so far

Under The Bridge,triple j Like a Version 14,2018,"Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
In the city I live in, the city of Sydney
Lonely as I am, together we cry

Uh
Yo, let me pain this picture as I draw
You see the water runnin' down my face like waterfall
Oh, they just took your best friend, have you got that call?
Because we're born with thicker skin we can't know pain at all
And ever since we were just little told to be a man
So how we distribute emotion? Do not understand
Hence why we quick up the bottle, light our brain with the green
They just told us who we are, they never said what we could be
Uh

And I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
And I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, but take me all the way

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, I said, yeah, yeah

Where the peace at? Yo, where the cheese at?
In this rat race tryna get some feedback
What happened to acceptance? Everything is different now
 the same place yet they treat us like we're criminal
We tell 'em, ""I am, I can, I came to win
Know where I been, no leaps forward, now back again""
 under bridges everywhere
That's what we show our children so they never end up there
Yeah, yeah
Yo

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
And I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, but take me all the way

The chase of an elusive dream
 appears in the dark, but they still see
 we don't understand that life ain't no 
And  ain't always what it seems
But if you feel where I'm comin' from with these
I said, if you feel where I'm comin' from with these
 in the background we bleed
In the background we bleed, yeah

Under the bridge downtown is where I drew some blood
Under the bridge downtown, I could not get enough
Under the bridge downtown, forgot about my love
Under the bridge downtown, I gave my life away
I gave it away

Lately,,2016,"It's that everything is going wrong, but still it feels just right
It's that wake up in the morning, wonder what you did last night
There's no limit to this tank, the way I do it is so true
My boy left this one for me so I'ma leave this one for you
Now I've got time for days, we don't get no breaks
Been working hard, missed our holidays
Now this is almost everything we used to barter for
'Cause now we started making moves that they simply just can't ignore
Please allow me to elaborate, just say this time a lock in the day
South west is a distance from north side, got a couple things lined up, I be on the way
Hit the whip with no license, rain drip, no wipers
Said it's all about the love brah, save that shit for the ciphers
'Cause you know I gotta lead that like wolf pack, never be no one like ""Who that?""
On the way bad, when we made a cliche go, never stop till we're alright in the Maybach
It's that forward thinking, forward speaking motion
And I'm just being honest, drinking water with that potion
'Cause

I be on that real, real, real shit
I've been on that real, real, real shit
We be on that real, real, real shit
I've been on that real, real, real, lately

Now these days
I take a seat at my desk, hit my emails, what's next?
Remember I gave my props so please don't forget my checks
Baby girl I'm not like the rest, 'bout this I'm borderline obsessed
By the way that I come off, hit a little show off, now we got the favors on deck
Not sure if she believes me, but she's rolling
Not sure she need me, but she rolling
Now this girl on TV, and there's cameras rolling
And then we take it easy and this smoke she's blowing
We remain up all night, all day
Watching the sun rise, and set this way
Something inside says you need to go home, but you stay
Can't even explain it, you ain't even gotta say

I be on that real, real, real shit
I've been on that real, real, real shit
We be on that real, real, real shit

I'm feeling high
My money's gone
I'm all alone
The world keeps turning
Oh, what a day
What a day, what a day


Just got off the phone, it's official, man, I got the deal
Should I pinch myself? I can't believe it, this cannot be real
Sign, sealed, delivered in the morning, ask me how I feel
This time last year I was eating  with 
This is what they talk about, yeah, this is what dreams are made of
You would feel real emotional too if you really knew about where I came from
Put my girlfriend through a hella lot, and my family through even more
Sacrifice  sacrifice, I did the groundwork and now  at the door
No, no,  thought I wasn't coming down, did you?
Want my fair slice of the cake, so don’t try to play me for a little
Cause I'm gon' eat that up, take my time, want that shine, it's all mine
All my grind, no stop signs, all green lights, 

I know they waitin’, waitin’
Wait—wait—waitin’, waitin' on me
‘Cause I hear they’re waitin’, waitin’
Wait—wait—waitin’, waitin' on me

It's alright, I had to grow so I took my time
It’s okay, it's alright, I had to grow so I took my time

""Yo, as I look down at—at my wrist at this new timepiece I was given as a gift, it reflects the day of when things were about to change, and I'll always remember that time.""

International call, my dad is on a speakerphone
Talkin' 'bout the news, he said to hold it down, he's coming home
I've been patiently waitin' till I can go and tell my town
Elefant Traks, B Wise, you know it's going down
Shoutout to my old supporters, wassup to my brand new fam
This shit's gonna be a movie, I'm gon' rep it how I can
Felt like I was gonna be here, knew it from the start
Cause everything I talk about I say right from the heart
Whether playing shows to three people or them packed arenas
I'm gon' take this shit so global, I won't stop until they see us
I'm a really big dreamer, turn them doubters to believers

Yo, let me tell you again like I'm on playback
We bad boys, got Diddy with me so take that
You like cash? Then blow cash like double racks
We some Goodfellas, that's mob sh** like A$AP
Remember when I was a kiddie, I would make a promise
I will never chase a girl unless she Pocahontas
I'm grown up, my lady's pokin', I'm just being honest
So I gotta take a minute just to feel her
I know I talk a lot, but it's real sh**
I need a antidepressant so I can feel sh**
Cheap thrills, I'm on a different page
I'm rentin' European whips, feel like I'm Bruce Wayne
I mean, same thangs got the whole crowd getting strange like, ""Hey!""
If you wanna kick it hit me when I'm in your city (hey!)
Yeah, I got my brothers with me and I gotta lot of hate
Calling old room numbers but we checked out yesterday

I'm here to make a diamond out a teardrop
Here to put a bit a lime up in the Smirnoff
Here to turn the party out, brother, fear not
Spit a gutter gospel to anyone in earshot
Yeah, they call me A$AP Laksa
Got the crowd yelling ""gimme more"" like Busta
Bring a bit a shine when the time's lacklustre
You are now messing with some bad motherf**ers
Like Samuel L's wallet in Pulp Fic
Turn an independent movie into a cult hit
I'm getting strong now, beast on my Hulk sh**
Hanging with a diva and her skin tone's dulcet
Mr Barber man, give me a fade
And line it up real neat with a cutthroat blade
If I'm fresh to d**h I got a foot in the grave

So if you've been in the dark, this your lightbulb moment
Yeah, I'm about to hit you with a bright idea
White boy spittin' black magic
In the cut like my man Klasik
Thinkin' I got time for the back slappin'
Wouldn't hold your breathe like you asthmatic
But when we step in our house got the keys to the city
And just put our name on the lease
They been so patiently waitin', like inmates
They anticipating our date of release
Until that time, hold the line, standby
'Cause I'm having me a grand old time
Writing verses on the beach, working on my tan lines
And I step up in the place with my mans and I make 'em
Throw their hands high
