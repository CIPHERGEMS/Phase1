Out Of The Blue,Blue Volume,2014,"Out of the blue, it all changed in an instant
He was nineteen when she told him she was pregnant
Barely out of high school, living in a small town
Neither of 'em had a job or money in the bank
He got work on the factory floor
Struggling to make ends meet but she adored him
Always in his corner when her parents started on her, like
""He won't ever amount to that much""
The baby arrived, really, they tried
She said, ""Let's do the best we can, a day at a time""
He started staying out all night, getting drunk
Convinced he couldn't deal with what he had and what he'd done
He lost his job and that was no surprise
She said, ""I can't go on watching you destroy your life
You need to get it together or I'm leaving with our kid""
He said, ""It's probably best if you left,"" so she did
[Chorus: Kaity Dunstan & 
Joelistics
]
So when you gonna learn?
It'll hit you hard
Even if it hurts
And it always does
So when you gonna learn?
Let it in your heart
We come together and fall apart
Out of the blue, my love

Five years later and she's living in the city
She'd severed all contact to her old life
Her little girl's at school, and she was working days
Staying up late and studying through the night
Out of the blue, he called up and they talked
He said he'd got a job up north on fishing trawlers
He hadn't touched a drink, for two years, he'd been clean
Plus he saved some money on the side in between
He cleared his throat, made an awkward joke
And asked, ""Maybe I could come and visit you both?
But only if you think it's alright, I mean""
She said she'd think about it, the next day, she agreed
[Chorus: Kaity Dunstan & 
Joelistics
]
It'll hit you hard
Even if it hurts
Like it always does
So when you gonna learn?
Let it in your heart
We come together and fall apart
Out of the blue, my love
Out of the blue
Out of the blue
Out of the blue, my love

He got on a plane and flew across the desert
Watching as the world flew by
It felt like he held his breath from the airport
All the way to her front door the whole time
He knocked soft and she opened up
And they looked at each other, both dumbstruck
Each waiting for the other one to speak first
But neither of 'em could find any words, then
Out of the blue, as if on cue
Trying to hold back the tears in their eyes
And with a voice full of cracks and a heart fit to burst
She said, ""Well, you took your time""

These moments make up a lifetime
Mistakes we make are not fixed in stone
People we love are a lifeline
And none of us can do it on our own
Out of the blue
Out of the blue
Out of the blue, love saves us
Out of the blue, we all learn that lesson
[Chorus: Kaity Dunstan & 
Joelistics
]
So when you gonna learn?
It'll hit you hard
Even if it hurts
Like it always does
So when you gonna learn?
Let it in your heart
We come together and fall apart
Out of the blue, my love",https://genius.com/Joelistics-out-of-the-blue-lyrics
In The Morning,Blue Volume,2014,"My generation had a lot on their plate
Tryna escape mistakes that our parents made
My generation had too much to think
Now it's all about careers and the gym and the kids
We spent our twenties on various sofas
Woke up in our thirties with a bangin hang over
Economic outcasts listening to outcast
Tryna make sense of the world with a sound heart
I don't know if it's sad or dumb
But the best nights I've ever had have blurred in to one
They run the long gamut, tragic to fun
And now I'm not but the night is still young
We are golden. we are godless
One day everyone you know will just cease to exist
In the midst of all the meaningless mess
I embrace it cause fuck it, this is all we get, right?

A thousand wasted nights
I don't know what's right
I was high, I was high
In the morning
A thousand ringing sirens
All I hear is silence
I'll be fine, I'll be fine
In the morning

Stop and pause for a second take a look around
Make a note on how the Earth looks from in the clouds
It's not about weather or not your gonna fall
It's about the lesson that you learn when you hit the ground
Feel the rush, feel the buzz when the day is done
I keep a clear head stocked for what ever comes
A lot of weird people raise their voice
But don't say a damn thing they're just making noise
This moment is perfect and you know that
Burn it in your memory and make it a kodak
Keep it in a file for the times you go mad
The world is my week end, tonight I own that
Grim reaper keep away from my friends
Middle finger salute to you, fuck you death
May the lights of the city be a sign of strength
And may the world one day make sense
I'm a reach for the stars

A thousand wasted nights
I don't know what's right
I was high, I was high
In the morning
A thousand ringing sirens
All I hear is silence
I'll be fine, I'll be fine
In the morning

I was looking at a face in the mirror this morning
Tryna recognize who was standing before me
True to form, I let the feeling grow
But I'm a different guy to who I was a year ago
A little more patient, a little more humble
A little bit older, a little more comfortable
I guess it comes for us all in the end
And then it never happens again

A thousand wasted nights
I don't know what's right
I was high, I was high
In the morning
A thousand ringing sirens
All I hear is silence
I'll be fine, I'll be fine
In the morning",https://genius.com/Joelistics-in-the-morning-lyrics
Nostromo,Blue Volume,2014,"You taught me that anger could be useful
You taught me that pain was never my fault

The streets are empty as shit
And we just ride them like ghosts
In the place where we live
We've got no where to go
Pushbikes on the road
We take flight with the crows
The night sky above and tarmac below us
The city lights are majestic off in the distance
Over the roof tops we float
Above the dreams of a suburban night
We snuck out while my parents slept
Take a ride and we
We ride our bikes to the bay
Take a walk of the wharf
Sit on the edge and light a ciggie like a torch
You turn and you talk to me, I'm looking away
I'm listening to every single thing that you say
You say ""The future's bright man, tomorrow is ours
And there will come a day soon where we leave this town""
The clouds they start to gather and we get up and leave
And we're home before the dawn even touches the trees

I'm saying
It's more than with your own life you are playing
And I understand you
My friend, I've fucked up too
But I'm just saying, I'm just saying

We always said that these suburbs were like cemetery
You always said you'd escape that's what you said to me
You got away, not in the way that you thought
Now I'm walking down old tracks and I'm looking for yours
And in the middle of similar looking scenes
As I step off from the gutter and gather the things I need
Midnight light makes the night life look lifelike
The antennas and tennis courts, this town is menopause
And yeah I know my way around, and I could play it down
The streets are like the back of my hand
And memories abound but now it's different
I'm different, the difference is that I visit
I don't stick around, I don't even miss it
I get a vision of a version of my highschool days
Most weekends you would spend at my place
Your face is in these streets and it haunts me now
That's why I struggle when I head homebound


You always had your own rhythm
To keep the comedy coming
You were as close as a brother man
I think of you often
How you talked with a passion
How you rationed you cash
You stood six foot tall above the rats
You had a habit of thinking you were the
Smartest motherfucker in the room
And it was generally true
On the real you were a hero
A friend of the highest order
A companion when the girls that we chased
Were all we thought of
Whoever you are, wherever you're from
We all get given time then it's time to move on
One day you're in the midst of it
The next you are gone
And if you think it's different to that you're wrong
Life's an addiction, we're all in the nod
And it's a beautiful dream so dreamer dream on
Breathe in, remember everything from the start
The end is the beginning, the beginning is past

First thing I noticed was just how thin you'd got
Hot the powerful mind that you once held was lost
And in the little corridor out of the corner of my eyes
I saw your eyes close, the tired lines on your face grew

Say I'm Good,Blue Volume,2014,"This is for those inbetweeners
Who don't follow no one, follow no leaders
Follow no trend or the sheep that are led
Follow no fool, never fall in step
I am not another voice in the choir
Kicking out jams or the party line
No I am not your poster child
Do my own thing in my own damn style
I would never assume to talk
On the behalf of anybody but myself
When I see anybody on a soapbox
All I hear are the warning bells
And even if we're on the same side
I don't follow blind, I am not that guy
And those pigeon holes are only made
To hold the kind of bird that's afraid to fly

They say, say, say I'm good
I'm rocking like I should
I'm doing thing, thing, thing, thing
Thing, things you only wish you could
You only wish you could
You only, only, only, only ever wish you could

This morning on the internet
I discovered our destruction's imminent
So we all get to act uninhibited
Take two of these and relax with a cigarette
Aw naw, here come the idiots, the oblivious
And the militant bigots and affiliates
Scares of the boats and they gays and the blacks
Pulling quotes from Leviticus
Here come the cause and effect of a country
Caught up in patriotic bullshit
And I don't fit and I don't care
I'm a square peg in a round role here
In the cross hairs I'm a bit weird
And it's not fair and it's not clear
So the whingers whinge and I cringe inside
When they simplify things that are complex

They say, say, say I'm good
I'm rocking like I should
I'm doing thing, thing, thing, thing
Thing, things you only wish you could
You only wish you could
You only, only, only, only ever wish you could
They say, say, say I'm good
I'm rocking like I should
I'm doing thing, thing, thing, thing
Thing, things you only wish you could

It ain't my fault, I got no love
I'm at a pub complaining how this country sucks
I'm an oddball, on the wrong team
All my friends are out of step with the mainstream
And the nightmare is in full swing
And the right-wing fucking up the whole thing
And it might be this stifling frightening feeling
Is really only felt on the fringes
But I doubt it, I re-rout it
Dope with a beat I need to speak about it
For the kids of the Labor left
Who got a bone to pic, we didn't vote for that fuckstick
I don't dig the kid, I don't kick the kid
I don't think it'd change if you made the switch
I don't dig the kid, I don't kick the kid
I don't think it'd change if you made the switch
I don't dig the kid, I don't kick the kid
I don't think it'd change if you made the switch
I don't buy the bullshit dreams

Days,Voyager,2011,"I never did it for the money
I did it because I had a lot of time on my hands
Now I've got plans, to make more plans
All of my friends grew up and push prams
It hits you like bam, what's it all for?
Music was my life then life got ignored
Then I lost hope, then I got broke
Then all I wrote came out as old folk
There goes my genius, blink and you missed it
Loop up the chorus, learn how to whistle it
If ya get an idea try not to fist it
It's like god whispered something insisted
Try not to block it, try not to drop it
When you get your grubby little paws on it
You gotta rock it, You gotta rock it
You gotta rock it to the moon get on it

And it might not mean that much to you
It means a lot to me, and its got to be
Something strange and familiar I still wanna feel it
I still wanna feel the music
As the days go by..

My boys said ""kid, you redefine dope
Plus you had the presence of mind to rock the boat
Plus you had some hits from the rhymes in your folder
Had a bit of shine, and fell into a coma
Get back out there and do it all sober
Milk that shit until the cow falls over
Do it for the music, do it for the moment
Even if it never blows up, own it.""
Kids these days want posters on their walls
Friends on facebook, and ironic rap quotes
Me, I've got bad jokes, personal anecdotes
Songs for perennial underachievers
You want a revolution, move to Beijing
You wanna get high and sing along then join in
Its all good, mad props
Truth of the matter salvation is ad hoc

And it might not mean that much to you
It means a lot to me, and its got to be
Something strange and familiar I still wanna feel it
I still wanna feel the music
As the days go by....

It all breaks down to pride
A search for what makes the ride worthwhile
Look for the content, look for the star
Strap your shoes on and run that mile
Keep the fire inside alive
Cos the world gets cold and it can pass you by
You can pass on the risk, convince the hurt
But that's a real bad way for you to pass the time
I used to want to see my name in lights
I used to wanna be the one holding the mic
But these days man I've got nothing to prove
And its evident it might mean nothing to you
But if I didn't do it I'd have nothing to do
I'd probably have nothing to do with you
So until the day, there's nothing more to say
I'm-a keep on singing the tune
As the days go by...
As the days go by...
As the days go by...
As the days say goodbye...",https://genius.com/Joelistics-days-lyrics
Not In My Name,Blue Volume,2014,"Lately I've been losing all my faith in humanity
And to think I am a part of it's embarrassing
I read the paper and I keep up with the news
I can't recognise what we do as even human
It's out of wack, out of balance, out of control
The lies told and the attitude that unfold
This fucking country has a rotten bitter hard soul
These are laws of the land that the Crown stole
I hear them talk, talk, talking on the radio
They spit fever pitch panic on what they oppose
I read the columns, the letters and opinion pieces
At every pub everybody's got prepared speeches
Misunderstanding all the pain in the politics
They only want a scapegoat and kept promises
And all the anger and the fear and resentment grows
The brutality of lucky country village folk
It's not enough to turn back a bunch of leaky boats
It's not enough to kill their dreams then we kill their hope
It's not enough to deprive them of their human rights
It's not enough, until somebody lose their life
Dark shadows gather history will judge us hard
One day you'll ask yourself ""did I do enough?""
And how much cruelty did we allow to be dealt
To a group of desperate people asking for some help

How does it sit with you?
How do you sleep at night?
Does it worry you at all occupy your mind?
I hang my head, heavy heart, I am so ashamed
It's in my backyard, but not in my name

The journalists gather, the cameras click clack
And at the podium the speaker's putting on his act
He talks in double speak, Orwellian reports
Empty words but his body language says it all
His hands are outstretched, now his arms are crossed
His white face sweats bullets and he nods a lot
Official press release, massive fact omissions
The purpose so clear - dehumanise the victims
Appoint an expert, launch enquiries
Pass the buck, obfuscation by any means
He answers all the questions with the party line
Repeats the focus group emotion heavy catch cries
He knows his audience, and how to handle them
Talk tough, keep it simple, act the larrikin
Make them think that your one of them just like a mate
Repeat the sentiment - ""ain't this fucking country great""
Now he's hit his stride, he's got them hypnotised
Convince them there's a threat to their very way of life
And now the lights fade and he walks away
He played it perfectly to keep the power one more day

[How does it sit with you?
How do you sleep at night?
Does it worry you at all are you dead inside?
I hang my head, heavy heart, I am so ashamed
It's in my backyard, but not in my name]

The sun beats down hot upon a prison camp
A family huddles in a tent with no ceiling fan
The days roll in to each other in the worst way
A young boy celebrates his 9th birthday
At night he hears people weeping it's a common sound
He's used to to seeing things he saw his sister drown
He wonders if it's real, he wonders who to trust
His mum and dad are like ghosts they don't talk too much
He kicks a soccer ball in an empty field
One of the guards kicks it back and compliments his skill
The boy tells the guard ""I turned nine today""
The guard smiles, stops, then he looks away
He says ""Little man one day I hope you understand
When you're older and your dignity is still intact
And you look back at this vicious treatment
Not all were complicit, not all were indecent""

[How does it sit with you?
How do you sleep at night?
Does it worry you at do you sympathise?
I hang my head, heavy heart, I am so ashamed
It's in my backyard, but not in my name
Not in my name
Not in my name

Bang The Boogie,Blue Volume,2014,"It goes, one for the money, two for the privilege
I grew up in the inner city of Sydney
Problems, I had a whole lot of them in me
Smoked a lot of weed at the age of sixteen
Spend time tryna find out my history
Wondering what it was the wind was whispering
I'm from a land where the sunlight's blistering
And everybody's got their own get-rich-quick scheme
Money, money, money, make more money quickly
Build machinery to mine and dig deep
The new gold rush economic dick tease
Snap your neck back at a break neck quick speed
High school assembly signing the anthem
The words sound empty and I can't stand them
Even back then I had to deal with the phantom
I called myself Australian short hand for random

Bang to the boogie, bang, bang the boogie
Bang to the boogie, bang, bang the boogie
Bang to the boogie, bang, bang the boogie
Bang to the Lucky Country boogie the beat

I got a Chinese father and a white mother
And I was a punk drummer back when I was just a youngun
I'm a mixed bag, mixed race, mixed up kid
(What you got) with something to give, and I give what I can
I'm from a land where blokes are blokes
And they yell stop the boats and It gets them votes
And they brag and they boast and promote a fair go
The closer you look the more you see they don't
And you hope that this changes excepting it won't
Like somewhere along the way that's all she wrote
Summerland really has a heart of snow
Where the temperature and attitudes are 40 below
But I still call Australia home
I still hit the road with a hunger to roam
And pack a little piece of the place in my heart and bones
Every single time I get up and go, now here we go


I am from a cashed up land of pirates
A beautiful island with a sense of entitlement
Me first attitudes, highly competitive
Perched inbetween pioneering and irrelevant
Casually racist overly cautious
We lock the boarders up like it was a fortress
Suffocated by a sense of importance
And governed by minds that suffer from smallness
So much focus on the money, I'm nauseous
With no thought for those less fortunate
And this portrait is far from flawless
A little distorted and we're all caught in it
I'm so board of it, it;s so fraudulent
We can afford it but don't press pause on it
You can complain or change your coordinates
Me, I stay steady tryna get at the source of it


And you don't stop, rock to the rhythm you don't stop
Make money money money make a lot, too much just ain't enough",https://genius.com/Joelistics-bang-the-boogie-lyrics
Glorious Feeling,Voyager,2011,"It's a glorious feeling
I'm up on my feet again
God gave up on the human race
He said based upon the data that I've had to face
You've really made a mess of the place that I've made for you
And then you turn around and you ask me to save you
Jews blame the Christians, Christians the Muslims
Atheists admitted they were wrong but right
The pope said, well, I guess that's that then
Collectively we all breathe out a sigh
All of the damage that religion had done
Was put into perspective underneath the sun
And God said faith is a beautiful thing
But it's time for you to take responsibility kids
Cause I don't know what you've been told
But the streets of heaven aren't lined with gold
You don't know what you've got till it's gone
It's a glorious feeling
I'm up on my feet again
The human race gave up on god
And said it's high time that we all got along
The arguments about who the hell she loved best
Were seen for what they were and laid to rest
And politicians stopped using God as an excuse
To commit the most blatant abuse of power
Loud like ringing in the ears
The sounds of the prayers of the cheers
From the people released
All baptized at the miracle of life
Without the regrets and the guilt and the threats
Sex was celebrated, life was embraced
The basic thing was maintain respect
And I don't know what you've been told
But the streets of heaven aren't lined with gold
You don't know what you've got till it's gone
On the streets of the cities of the world you find them
People of all types who climb the horizon
Fresh newborn's and the fresh new morning
Lovers in the night who fly and then fall
The march of survivors, designers, tyrants, messiahs, limousine drivers
Colonels, brigadiers, sergeants, privates
The scientists smashing particles together
The junkies, the tradies, the gentlemen, the ladies, the babies
The aged and infirm, the hermits, the perverts, the servants, the surgeons
The insurgents killing in the name of god
The slow and the steady who were ready for anything
The war on the menacing, and even center-link
And the ones who were pedaling stories
Of the grace and the glory
It's a glorious feeling
I'm up on my feet again",https://genius.com/Joelistics-glorious-feeling-lyrics
Fly Away,Blue Volume,2014,"I used to brush it off like it didn't matter
Dark clouds in the sky brother, let 'em gather
Now it's all cuts a little deeper and has an effect
Similar to what it is when glass shatters
So we drive like Kerouac use to do
Smoking cigarettes, eating up junk food
With both windows down and the stereo up
We lift a coffee cut in the sun
Leave behind the skyline
Full of terracotta rooftops in a shitbox town
Living in us too long
All these suburbs sing their own proverbs
And hold a million heart breaks in between the commerce
And I can see it all for miles around
I'm getting dizzy from the sight and sound
At the top of the hill we stop and we chill
Then boost, take time to get your head out the noose

You can let a good thing go by
It might not happen again
We can go where ever we like
Sunshine on the window, yeah
I said let's get in the car
Maybe we could drive for days
Nothing was built to last
Get loose and fly away

I used to waste time like I'd live forever
Always on the hunt to find something better
Now it all shakes me up and I'm breathless
It has an effect similar to something like an earth tremor
The car's outside and the tank is full
And to take time off is impractical
But we leave on a whim to do the damn thing
Freedom in the air and the wind sings songs
Of a generation passed and present, the car is headed
Along the coastline inland, up through the desert
And we savour all the sights and the sound and moods
And even eat the meat pies and the road house food
And you can see what's up in rear view
Get pumped up by the look of a clear view
Out across the vista, kiss the stars in the night
Brother, what a beautiful sight


I used to place bets of my sanity
Caught up in between the dream an the art and the parody
Tryna figure out if it was meant to be
For me to work and breed, buy a house and get married in it
Just to be like they are on TV
But those dreams never really seemed to fit
And I've been jugglin' and jigglin' every day that I live
And there's things that I just can't fix
You were always telling me to take better care with it
Don't rush a good thing or get scared of it
Disconnect your telephone for a couple of days
And hit the highway to watch the scenery change
Responsibility it ain't nothing to fun from
Some wrongs are right, some rights become wrong
And every now and then when reality slip
I take five and get away for a bit",https://genius.com/Joelistics-fly-away-lyrics
Modern World,Voyager,2011,"It all about status updates, sample drum brakes
A hole in the head, and the lifelong Monday
Baby bloomers and new computers
Social networks, billion users
Information, Infomercials
Crop circles and trophy wives
Hard drives and hate crimes
State lies, free steak knives
Right-wrong riots and rising tides
Catalogs buy and a lord of brides
Brand names and video games
All it takes in minimum wage
Wiki leaks in the world of police
Secret files and cover up leads
The hunger, the feast
The church and the priest
And the prelate facing the east
(East!)
This modern world
Keeps me spinning around
My god, my feet
Don't touch the ground
You can live life online
You can live a life of crime
You can live mine
Whatever you want you can find
You can get fined
You can get filmed from behind
It's a gold rush, let's get famous
Act shameless, call it neighbors
You can call it art
You can call it us
You can call it pop
And watch it climb the charts
High rollers and child soldiers
Party people and jive holders
Cash culture and clashed cultures
Market crashes, atlas shrugs
It's a leaky boat that we're all in
And the privileged life is a-callin'
Through the country's boarders you're pourin'
Put your hands up now the sky is fallin'
This modern world
Keeps me spinning around
My god, my feet
Don't touch the ground
This modern world
Keeps me spinning around
My god, my feet
Don't touch the ground
We are alive in desperate times
The best of times, messed up times
Build that fire, chase that prize
Everybody wants a bigger piece of the pie
These are the days of the disconnect
Distant satellites intercept
Warfare fought in infrared
Everything you think is incorrect
My intellect needs disinfectant
Too much information
Too hectic
Twenty-first century I'm shipwrecked in it
And we're all just tryin' to connect with it
And oh my god where do I fit in
Apocalypse now every now and then
The world is a book with a cliffhanger plot
And we all want to know how it ends
This modern world
Keeps me spinning around
My god, my feet
Don't touch the ground",https://genius.com/Joelistics-modern-world-lyrics
Heart Remains,Voyager,2011,"The world gets faster, the tempo skips
The mind plays tricks when the sunlight hits me
I get a memory flashed like a frisbee
Thrown from a thousand long miles away
Thoughts go deep and underneath
The ground that used to be beneath me
There's a restless need to indulge the senses
Just to see what the mind remembers
Dive in, swim through the maze
Hold your breath and let go of the reigns
Caught in the rip and the current below
Mind got movement, mind got flow
From where I stand, the vision expanded
Over the red sand over the land
Over the city and the bush and beyond
Mind gallop over, countless kilometres
To a place where the oldest origins
Where the silent sleeping sorrow is
With a thriving creeping metropolis
Where the hearts are as heavy as the wallet is
In a colony that paints your dreams
With glinted light of the harbour seas
The flame trees in amongst the weeds
The greenest greens in the rainforest valleys
The undergrowth, solar flares
Sunsets spread in the sky like prayers
The rarest flowers cover the ground
Illegal crops support the small towns
A house on stilts in a cane field
And old wood mill with a chain wheel
Insects hum in the afternoon
Like a thousand drummers in a tiny room
And there's a silver moon that'll rise tonight
Shine a light along the countryside
Beaches give way to rolling pastures
Wheat and barley wait for harvest
Fibro houses with peeling paint
An old hills hoist and a rusty gate
A garden path, a big backyard
And a clapped out car in the front
And the languid heat makes sleepless nights
Lazy speak, mosquito bites
Old timers who drive the road trains
Rolling cigarettes single handed
Outback pubs in the blazing sun
Fried up grub in the empty drums
Twelve apostles, hungry possums
Empty bottles, ancient fossils
Friendly blokes, racist jokes
And everywhere you look there a ghosts
Lightning flash, thunder crack
Rain come down and the sky turn black
Over fishing trawlers in majestic waters
Blistering winds on a ship wreck shore
Neptune's wrath with a ledger book
You gonna pay for the fish that your fathers took
And families fear for the worst in storms
But some folk weren't meant to live indoors
And the horses run, the eagle soar
The car seat's hot and the breeze is warm
Drive the car south, follow the signs
On highways carved in to lonely coastlines
Move forward, sing the praise
Drive for days to watch climates change
It's highly likely we'll sleep in the back seat
With a rolled up pillow and a bed sheet
And we drive with a mess on the windscreen
And the bugs pasty at the speed
And the road runs straight all the way to the west
Where the sea gets down with the sunset
Road kill flesh, service stations
Dry riverbeds, and burnt out cars
Saltpan lakes calm and vast
Colours explode under skies of glass
Snakes and lizards, red blood ribbons
Buried in the dust and the rock and the grass
And the stars in the milky way
Transform the night in a darkened frame
Distant suns and constellations
Shooting stars and the sky is blazing
And the gods they must be crazy
And the gods they must be crazy
And the gods they must be crazy
We are all spangled orphans, shifting fortunes
Channelling long dead spirits
We cling to the coast like ghosts
Sunday roasts, English hopes
Given way tied to an island with a tyranny of distance
With a heart full of gold and persistence
And it's hard to say what we'd like to say
While Matilda waltzes the night away
Through the blood and the sweat
And the tears and the laughter
The sun and the rain and the thunder
And the creeks and the rivers and the reefs
And the valleys and the fields and the beach
I saw it all clear from my house on a hill
In a country for away I thought to myself
Til the day that I die
That'll be where my heart remains",https://genius.com/Joelistics-heart-remains-lyrics
How Many People,Blue Volume,2014,"Yeah yeah yeah
Verse:
Alice is embarrassed by the thoughts in her head
And she thinks too much, she starts to get scared
Doctors told her, she was bipolar
Put her on prescription pills like that would solve it
It didnâ€™t quell the low self-esteem
And the guys that she falls for treat her so mean
They tear off strips until there ainâ€™t nothing left
But she can give back just as good as she gets
And she gets so worked up then down in the dumps
Canâ€™t hold a steady job, unemployed for months
The drugs arenâ€™t something that she does for fun
Theyâ€™re just a way to stay comfortably numb
She says the world will cut you deep
It creeps and it eats up all the dreams you keep
But when the music begin and she starts to move
She is the bright light shining inside the room
She cries tears and they stream down her face
All beyond her years and she never feels safe
Well talking helps and she melts and dissolves
Can't help thinking that the world is cold
In dreams she sees him, wakes up screaming
She can smell the beer on his breath and hear his breathing
They used to share the same name
Now sheâ€™ll never trust men again, simple and plain
Therapy helps but she still blames herself
The guilt and the shame of the regular hell
If she could she would send him straight to the grave
But she knows someday all debts get paid
I know her story, I am in awe of her strength
You just see a junkie whoâ€™s life is a mess
In a society so quick to judge
So quick to get drunk, not so quick to reflect
Itâ€™s easier to demonise an addict as a threat
A failure, a monster, a joke, a lost cause
It ainâ€™t about the high, itâ€™s the mental health
Alice didnâ€™t need prison, she just needed some help
Chorus
How many people do you know completely sober?
How many people do you know who self-medicate?
How many people do you know who on occasion take a little something something just to take the pain away?
How many people do you know who have a problem?
How many people do you know with excuses?
How many people do you know who are wrestling with demons, and memories and invisible bruises?
Verse:
Cameron had a habit of having a fucking habit
Couldnâ€™t figure out how to kick it into submission
It was killing him slowly, it was losing him friends
But something about the high always got him in the end
Nobody said it would be easy
He knew it, he wasnâ€™t looking for pity
He knew the city was up to no good
Getting dizzy, he lay in the rhythm
And run a mock everyday with a singular vision
He was born in the belly of the beast
Where the beast feasts on the belly of the deceased
He would sleep underneath bright neon street signs
Quick on the rewind, flip it on the b side
Heâ€™d spent enough nights sleeping in the park
To know a dollar wasnâ€™t too much to ask for
And he would kick with the homeless, the hopeless, the hounded
Somehow he would fit in with the outlaws
And in the cracks and the fissures
The city was a vicious little animal without inhibitions
He would look but he couldnâ€™t tell the difference
Between the saints and the sinners, the heroes and the villains
A brother in prison, a sister in the system
He never knew his dad and his mum was indifferent
Listen, we all make the best of the life we get
But some get a lot less to begin with
Yeah
Chorus:
How many people do you know completely sober?
How many people do you know who self-medicate?
How many people do you know who on occasion take a little something something just to take the pain away?
How many people do you know who have a problem?
How many people do you know with excuses?
How many people do you know who are wrestling with demons, memories and invisible bruises?
I ainâ€™t trying to judge nobodyâ€™s ache
I ainâ€™t trying to judge nobodyâ€™s ache
I ainâ€™t trying to judge nobodyâ€™s ache
I ainâ€™t trying to judge nobodyâ€™s ache
I ainâ€™t trying to judge nobodyâ€™s ache
I ainâ€™t trying to judge nobodyâ€™s ache
I ainâ€™t trying to judge nobodyâ€™s ache
I ainâ€™t trying to judge nobodyâ€™s ache
I ainâ€™t trying to judge nobodyâ€™s ache
I ainâ€™t trying to judge nobodyâ€™s ache
I ainâ€™t trying to judge nobodyâ€™s ache

I ainâ€™t trying to judge nobodyâ€™s ache",https://genius.com/Joelistics-how-many-people-lyrics
Care Anymore,Blue Volume,2014,"Everybody here has something they're tryna sell
Something they want to yell
Some secret they want to tell
Man, if at death it turns out we're wrong and believers correct
I'll see half of them in hell
You fucking hypocrites, who's selling your merch?
No-one ever listened to the lyrics or the words
I guess, one little monkey doesn't stop the show
Unless that little monkey has a bone to pick
I am a fisherman sitting along the side of a river
And watching on as the spirit of my ancestors float down
Time is a profound friend, he's always got a message to send
And if you listen, you can hear it
Fact check your feelings, format your findings
Break down the boundaries and limits
Unlearn the rules and undo the damage
And unfuck the world, understand you are in it
Not Just online, not just indifferent
Modern world fatigue has got 'em all asleep
I'm done running down conviction so for now I'm shouting
Peace from the back of the beat

You don't care anymore",https://genius.com/Joelistics-care-anymore-lyrics
Sooner Or Later,Voyager,2011,"I believe I was born with the wanderlust
Made from the curiosity to see the whole world
Ever since I've been old enough to get around
I've been on the move, never one to settle down
I got it bad it's a bad disease
Travel light just in case I need to pick up and leave
Some might say I'm good at running away
It was the way I was raised
That's how I know I'm free
And the song lines travel on for years
From a long line of radical ideas
Travellers and traders, musicians and sailors
Who move through the ages to get me here
And there's something out there that I'm trying to find
I left it behind when the moment arrived
I rewind and remember engraved in my memory
The memory of all of it, it's called life
Now you're drunk with the geezers
Singing on the metro
Looking for a coffee in the gray-lit dawn
Hanging on a barstool
Palms on a napkin
Drinking in Paris
It's a beautiful morning
Head full of cheap beer, expat belligerents
Navigating traffic in the Shanghai taxi
Two-day train trip
Eyes on the landscape
Vast Mongolian hills roll past you
You learned a lot of swear words
Ate a lot of weird food
Made a lot of friends considered close crew
Slept in hostels
Dealt with some hostiles
And climbed the Himalayas to appreciate the view
Now somewhere out there you are still travelling
Standing on a corner singing songs at the moon
Clear-headed, crazy, night like a diamond
Happy in your skin trying to take it all in
Cradle in the heartbeat
Blood pump patchwork
Soaked up bittersweet mixed up epiphanies
Still away from everything you came from
Headphones on, now you see the world differently
Far from degenerate, waiting in an airport
Empty back pocket with the stamps in your passport
Are you a soldier or soul so well worn
Would you even recognise who you were before
Transformed by all these strange events
Tears in your eyes and you feel so blessed
When the plane touched down
Your feet touch ground
You finally get home, you gotta savour that feeling",https://genius.com/Joelistics-sooner-or-later-lyrics
Last Night,Voyager,2011,"she said last night
she had a big night
and the lights on the dance floor were real bright
the drinks kept coming and the more they came
the more she felt like herself again
now she got the binge drink
oozing with instinct
to try and make life all new and shiny
extract the slime and the sleaze and demeaning
and win back a little more self esteem

and so she's got a story for the girls on monday
the same damn story she told em last week
she hooked up passed out fell down woke up
walked home carrying her heels and handbag

it's too bad she broke up with him
she never used to get like that with him
still she won't call, won't text, won't ring
she don't wanna be the one to give in

i mean, she's holding on to her pride
besides, she's probably moved on, right?

last night
i had a big night
now i feel a little shaky on the inside
and there's no time like the present
i'll stay in bed until eleven in china

piece together all of the things i did
i can't believe some of the things i said
all i need to get me through
is sunlight, coffee and a picture of you

all i need is you

he said last night
he had a big night
now he's tryina recall what what it looked like
(what's it look like?)
and it's a long way down in the dim light
when you can't think right
and you're tryina crawl up an incline
and he's got a little bruised up black eye
and he's got a strong urge to have a big cry
head like an egg when it's being fried up
he ain't too sure that he even had a good time

he never used to be like that with her
he never used to get so high around her
now every night out is a permanent blur
with an explanation that's beyond words
he sits on the couch
cottonball mouth
watching the telly tryina dumb himself down
telling himself it's time to pull his head in
but next weekend he's gonna do it again
(and again
and again
and again
and again
and again
and again
and again
and again)

last night
i had a big night
now i feel a little shaky on the inside
and there's no time like the present
i'll stay in bed until eleven in china

piece together all of the things i did
i can't believe some of the things i said
all i need to get me through
is sunlight, coffee and a picture of you

all i need is you

again, shipwrecked inside my head
again, shipwrecked inside my head
again, shipwrecked inside my head
again, shipwrecked inside my head
and a good night's sleep
and some pain relief
and a week of work
and a hot shower
and a trip to the coast
and some eggs on toast
and some radiohead
and to stay in bed

all i need is you

Get Down,,2011,"Lookin' at an angel with the devil in her ear
Sayin' four letter words that'll make it in turn
To everything she fears
Follow them and unclear whatevers in her head
Cause it burns, it gets worse, it's a curse
It should turn till pressure will appear

The snow falls for so long, you're frozen
Hold on, the cold war will be over
Over

Four star halo away, for a way to escape
But inside is an angel in hiding
Locked away, more mistakes are made by the chase
Caught up by the chance to get higher now

Spiral Down
Spiral Down
With a clipped wing
Spiral Down
Spiral Down
With a clipped wing

Lookin' at an angel with the devil in her ear
Now the roles are reversed, and she's breaking the curse
She's nearly in the clear
Fly away from anyone telling you to steer
To the person you were, cause without him you're perfect
Now heaven will appear

The snow falls for so long, you're frozen
Hold on, the cold war will be over
Over

Four star halo, away for a way to escape
But inside is an angel in hiding
Locked away, my mistakes are made by the chase
Caught up by the chance to get higher now

Spiral Down
Spiral Down
With a clipped wing
Spiral Down
Spiral Down
With a clipped wing

Why do we all have to find love? Instead of just lettin' it find us?
I cannot tell if I'm blind drunk
Or live in a way that the sky does
I signed up for that mind fuck that that I does
Wait for the day that that time's up
Cause I'm sick of just spendin' that time up
Feel like I'm loosing my head, few in the end
Don't want a funeral yet
Cannot go through it again
Feel like I'm ridin' the plot of a beautiful death
And they say that if you love somebody, set them free
So even though the shit's hard to do, you gotta let me leave

Four star halo, away for a way to escape
But inside is an angel in hiding
Locked away, more mistakes are made by the chase
Caught up by the chance to get higher now

Spiral Down
Spiral Down
With a clipped wing
Spiral Down
Spiral Down

360 had an in depth interview with The Music. Here is what he said about his song ‘Spiral Down'.

""This is about mental illness and depression and coming good and fighting off the demon. It's based on my ex-girlfriend. She has struggled a lot. Over time I saw her get better. She was in a dark spiral and then I was able to help her through it and saw her come out. Mental illness is always so touchy and people are afraid to talk about it but the best thing for you is to talk. It can be hard to admit but talking is the best thing.""",http://www.songlyrics.com/360-feat-joelistics/get-down-lyrics/
Don't Worry About How It Looks,,2004,"[Intro]
Word life yo, huh
I've fin' and done bin', Doin' that shit
Homies, word, Hahaha
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Talk about most media, ""I hate it""
They should report the news and not create it
Everyday obsessing with anybody that's famous
And make up there own little stories and go and claim it
Australia needs for Damien Leith to save all his
Money mate and go and straighten his teeth
""i'll fight you for it""
And last week I went to lay on the beach
And saw this hottie getting burnt
So I gave...her...some...cream
""There you go""
I went to dinner with this elegant chick
Made my mission to yell and tell her what arrogance is
Made her shout me a feed and embarrass the bitch
Dropped a fart and then screamed
""You're fucking manners are shit!""
""I beg your pardon!""
Yeah, you bet i farted
Buy me a drink, I'm planning to get retarded
Anyways I'm off, you better not get me started
But you better check the present I left in your parent's garden

[Hook]
Ain't trying to get ???
Anything that you tell me to do
You and me got something good
Don't worry about how it looks
It ain't like we're new to this
Slow down, let me give you a kiss
Baby come, gonna take my time
Lay back and let your body recline

[Verse 2]
Yeah, Dudes with no teeth are like, 360
If I got kidnapped they'd say, Free 60
I brush my teeth with colgate, 360
I only play the xbox, 360
Yeah that's right, Bill Gates did a guest spot
But I'm sueing him for not putting me in the press shots
I'll change my rap name to 'thingy ma bob'
So it sounds weird when anybody's givin' me props
""hey, thingy ma bobs dope""
Yeah this kid is a fox, I'm so good I mack girls
While I'm flipping em' off
Only big in Australia, Like Erin Mcnaught is
Nah, I'm fucking universal banging Jennifer Hawkins
And cats say that I'll never make it platinum
So I'll buy my shit enough times to make it happen
The Aussie scene will probably hate my rappin'
Cause really I'm a pommy, I just fake my accent
""Fuck off ye' twat cunt""

[Hook]

[Bridge (spoken)]
Yeah, hey Joel
Do you reckon you could just
Let the beat play for a little bit man
I'm gonna whip out my Yazz flute and show
Ron Burgundy how to do it
Hey check this out, ready?

[Verse 3]
You all envy me, I'm rap's MCG
Cos that's where I like to walk my pet TV, ""good boy""
I gotta say this is the best CD ""? vagina pussy""
I'm the MVP, I'll be chillin' at the barber shop
Trying to have a threesome with Tara Moss and
Lara Croft, ""Womb Raider""
I'm gonna tell you why I'm hard to stop
You know why?, Its cos my motherfuckin' cars a dog
And he's silent looking for a parking spot
That's the only time you'll ever hear his barking stop ""silence""
I'm at the vet clinic, tryin' to book my next visit
For my pet midget,for havin' sex with it
Chillin with black panthers, coppin lap dances
""get the fuck out bitch, you don't meet my fat standards!""
I'm a passionate rapper I'm Matt candid
In every interview I do, I only rap answers

[Outro]
""So 360, where did you grow up?""
""Hey yo Melbourne""
""Ok and ah how long
Have you been rapping for?""
""yeah, yo, about 14 years""
Hahaha yeeeees
Ask your mother cos she knows it
She's seen it, she's done it
She's lived it and she's loved it
That's how it goes bitch, 360
Recognise, Identify or step aside
Motherfucker, ok",http://www.songlyrics.com/360/don-t-worry-about-how-it-looks-feat-joelistics-lyrics/
