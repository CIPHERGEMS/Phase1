URCH,URCH,2020,"Prefer TN’s or Maxies
Not Chinos prefer Trackies
Gloves, Hoodie, Eetswa
Wait lad can’t forget that Bally
Peep in the window looking for cash or goods or wallet or purse
Them boys say let’s go party
Me I say lad lets go Urch
Prefer TN’s or Maxies
Not Chinos prefer Trackies
Gloves, Hoodie, Eetswa
Wait lad can’t forget that Bally
Peep in the window looking for cash or goods or wallet or purse
Them boys say let’s go party
Me I say lad lets go Urch

Spend most my day on the roads gotta stack those bills like gate
Only brothers on my team, no fakes that’s facts only blood I back Fucks sake
Had opp crying out lakes
This ain’t the life for you brother you're fake
Wanna bang them clips come to the shack & get stumped
Everyone talk on the net like bob but this ain't a side show this my life
Everyone talk on the net like bob but this ain't a side show this my life

Dresscode like a adlay, hoodie with the bally
Back entrance on the side of the alley
I remember that day, them kids wanna party?
We rock up, 30 TNs to the addy
Cuz trust me, lad
I remember that night I was walking with Samuel
Found a car with the keys in the mirror
Put it in, found out the car was manual
Too boring
True stories
You wanna hear the night I was up in the pub?
4 of these dogs tried bridge up to us
But dropped their nuts outside of the club
Funny how they love to rock up in groups
But never ever down for a clean one outs
4 dogs against an old man
Now it's 10 of them flops tryna stomp me out

Prefer TN’s or Maxies
Not Chinos prefer Trackies

When I pull up on the scene you wanna talk shit
Brother I used to get paid from the fiends
On the urch every night with my bally 'n' trackies
Blacked out, crep check, TNs to them Maxies
Can't forget the gel ASICS
Still remember those days
13 I was just young adlay
Out there tryna make a little ashcay
Addays got cuffed, never talk to the pigs go ahead and make fibs
Cuz surely, my tokoua locked up and now you wanna talk this shit Cuz run the ball you’ll get slept little dog go ride for ya set
Little dog go ride for ya set

Call me Hefty
We gettin' money, but get in the way get Sheff'd G
Wild West G, bally up, hit traps, gotta get that stack, 16 when I clocked that gat
Like guess who's back to play
Face to face when they bridged up with that blade
They copped an L that day
Fuckin' barkin' up for nothin'
Pulled that shank his bluffing
One hit to the chin little dog was running

Prefer TN’s or Maxies
Not Chinos prefer Trackies
Gloves, Hoodie, Eetswa
Wait Lad can’t forget that Bally

Putting in work I’m clockin' on
When I run the ball, I never knock it on
Ain’t stomp the yard but when I’m in the yard your head adlay I’m stompin' on
Taking trips with a Bally, and go straight to the pussy opp addy
We pullin up and they driving off, pussy ran and he left his family
Ill be seeking ops like it’s an occupation
Taking trips lad I got no patience
Urch in their hood and they all look shook, and we makin' em run in there own stations
Them boys over there all act, my G's we ride for the gang thats facts
Ops wanna come to the hood, we taking risk and I guarantee we’ll do laps
When I call my G's lad its resurrection my Jesus (G's is) coming back
Lads with attitude who’ll get a mad at you and take trips with a fist and gat
When we urch that side and they shoot lad you know we shooting straight back
When I load that clip and bang that shit they ducking saying what’s that

[Verse 1]
Ayy, rhymes tough with the youth
I be all up on in my feelings when I'm spittin' in the booth
Yeah, I'm the mad [kunt?] [0:54] with the missin' front tooth
So sick with the bars, doctor say I got the flu
No cap
These dudes they wanna talk behind my back like a bunch of dirty rats
Why yous talk to the cops? Speaking nothing but the facts
I pull up on the scene, no face, no case (Nah, nah)
Blacked out from my head all the way down to my toes
Lads already at the spot, down pat and they all ready to go
Never snitch up on the gang, free my usos, soon home
Put the [1:16] [?] to the [?]
[1:17] [?] the rhino love lost [?]
Even by the cops with the tappin' on the phones
But we tappin' on the phone, used to be up on the roads
Now I did this [?] [1:26] on the go like a pro
(Now I did this [?] [1:28] on the go like a pro)

Come a long way from the days we were urchin'
Now we gettin' paid for the shows, just rehearsin' (West)
Lights, camera, action, put it on the 'gram, no caption
Do it for the fam, no cappin' (Ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2]
Wanna be like Sunday with a [chance?] [?] [1:52] and [?] with the future
Wanna make [1:54] [?] no bloopers (Nah)
My dreams got bigger, so we shoot for the stars
Made my team up on the motherfuckin' chart
Someone's opinion don't gotta be reality (Nah)
[2:04] [?], did the rap like a prodigy
Ayy, pull up on the scene with the [2:06] [?] and the [?]
I back my team like Buzz has Woody (I back my team)
I'll be on the court like a judge on Judy (On Judy)
On the DL's 'cause these cops tryna doozy
Said they're tryna take shots but this ain't no movie
(Said they're tryna take shots but this ain't no movie)

[Chorus]
We be on the grind, fuckin' on the five straight workin' (Straight workin')
Headed for the top, that's for certain (That's for certain)

Come a long way from the days we were urchin' (Come a long)

Lights, camera, action, put it on the 'gram, no caption (Nah)
Do it for the fam, no cappin'


[Verse 4]

Got in on lock and we aimin' for the skies
Can't fake hard work and determination (Nah)
Grew [2:54] [?], never wanna be complainin' (Never)
Never do a fool, Tom, seven days a week in the booth is my training
Still killin' bars, at the top, I'm remaining
This dude the same uso from the gutter
Same prophet, swear [?] [3:05] is no others

[Outro]

For a murder that you never committed upon in these streets)

Streetz,,2020,"[Intro]
I'm sorry, mama, I'm a G
Fell in love with the money and the streets (It's?the?heat)
Too many dramas?with police
Fighting demons, I guess they'll?never leave

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, mama, I'm a G (I'm a G)
Fell in love with the money and the streets (And the streets)
Too many dramas with police (Too many, too many)
Fighting demons, I guess they'll never leave (Nah)

[Verse 1: Kymza]
Coming hard down under, straight from the gutter
Out here tryna cash that bread and butter
046 on the move, straight grinding
Down in the dirt like a brother was mining
Found gold, at the top, stay shining
Ain't nobody gonna stop me grinding
Do it for my 'rents, do it for the sibs
Like a bartender, tryna cash them tips
Back of the shops with the fish and chips
Now it's better days for me and my team
Gotta stay focused even at the lowest
Now we coming up, only just getting noticed
Coming from the slum, didn't know me then
But your uso got older, streets got colder
Breaking through walls like a brother was a boulder
Run it these ways, gonna catch these shoulders
Get out the way, get out the way
Putting in work, tryna make that pay
Cops tryna get me, T1 affray
Tom Brady on the field running up them plays
Middle finger to the haters, bet they still play this
Coming for the top, make a name as the greatest
Steady been patient, no more favours
Eyes on the gwap, tryna stack those papers


[Chorus]
I'm sorry, mama, I'm a G (I'm a G)
Fell in love with the money and the streets (And the streets)
Too many dramas with police (Too many, too many)
Fighting demons, I guess they'll never leave (Nah, nah)

[Verse 2: ET]
Ayy
Doing it tough, stay true to the shack
All eyes on me like my name's 2Pac
Gotta stay staunch, don't need no pack
046, got it tatted on my back
Never had a lot, always had enough
Real G's, no time for bluffs
Heading down backstreets, rapping on trap beats
Put it in drive, no need for backseats
Never hit gaps, only hit licks
Gear disappears like magic tricks
Only eighteen with a flow so deadly
046, cuz, get ready
Coming through heavy, always stay steady
Moving up quick, these lads don't scare me
Only spit facts, only spit truth
Thought I was done 'til I stepped in the booth
Made a couple bangers, now it's on to the top
Two-double-five-nine, cuz, the shit don't stop
Spitting straight bars, spitting straight facts
Raised in the gutter, I was raised in the shack
But that's home, home of the brave
Two-double-five-nine, I'ma rep it to the grave
Time to take flight, no time for delay
Heading for the top, give a fuck what you say


[Chorus]
I'm sorry, mama, I'm a G (I'm a G)
Fell in love with the money and the streets (And the streets)
Too many dramas with police (Too many, too many)
Fighting demons, I guess they'll never leave (Nah, nah)

[Verse 3: Ronza]
It don't make sense, yeah, the poor getting poorer
The rich buying this that your man skip to flip packs
Trapping every day, new hustle on the streets
Don't diss a man's grind, get done with a piece
We run these streets, don't talk about trapping
Ain't athletes, don't run, never gapping
Come from the bump, straight from the shack
Shit goes down, always gotta bounce back
Yeah, we took some L's, no fullback
Always offside, never fall back
Ayy, hitting that beat, running through traps
Back to the game goes flipping them packs
Not for the name, just for the P's
Buy a new whip, give the 'rents them keys
Don't do it to flex, don't do it to tease
Do it for the gwap, gotta chase that cheese

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, mama, I'm a G (I'm a G)
Fell in love with the money and the streets (And the streets)
Too many dramas with police (Too many, too many)
Fighting demons, I guess they'll never leave (Nah)
I'm sorry, mama, I'm a G (I'm a G)
Fell in love with the money and the streets (And the streets)
Too many dramas with police (Too many, too many)
Fighting demons, I guess they'll never leave (Nah, nah)",https://genius.com/The-046-streetz-lyrics
