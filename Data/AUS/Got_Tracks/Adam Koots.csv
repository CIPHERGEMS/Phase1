The Boy Who Kicked The Beez Nest,Sleeping In The Sink,2015,"Clearly, I keep rocking till you hear me
Caught up in a series of apocalyptic theories
Stay proper rare when you're off with the fairies
You can’t stomach this like intolerance to dairy
Follow and compare me
I'll leave you in the cupboard
When the cuda's in the place I turn the situation rugged
I stay gullible when the puddie's in your lover
Nasty little grub spitting bars on you puppets
Bend over, suck it
When I kick the bucket i'll be sitting in the heavens with a bevy thinking ""Fuck it""
Still broke pocket with the dollars on my head
And a dope queue shuffling and following the steps
Till I wind up a mess, see me wide (live?) on the set
Too raw for the industry to sign me a cheque
The live illustrator with the starlighting vent
Got the operating system designed to progress
A slang based war from the seat of my desk
Still the ill sort of kid that would kick the beez nest
Emcees stress like a work pee test
And I've been fresh since you were getting bullied at recess

It's the K double O T S kid, follow where I go and get left in the cesspit
Leave a mark on your fez with a green tip
Creep in the dark and I bring it till the beats skip

It's the K double O T S kid, follow where I go and get left in the cesspit
Leave a mark on your fez with a green tip
Creep in the dark and I bring it till the beats skip

Deep in the thought I'm deep (steep?) in the sink
Put a mic to my face and I speak what I think
I follow flight paths of an unidentified craft
Break through your type cast mould with my tight bars
Don’t ignore what I think cause I drink on a cash in hand wage
While I cheat centrelink
I'mma keep pedalling like a chief in his thing
Turning water into wine over beats with a swing
I roll trees on the front of magazines
While I spin at 33.3 degrees
If you ever hear a wack emcee on my beat
Then it was only for the cash when I needed to eat
My jeans smell of weed
See police yell skeet, ease back
Sell a couple cds, no tax
Like grease from the track
Chuck a Piece up, track side
Could of leave a shoe print, wacking emcees backsides
Attack mic’s and pack pipes the max height
Tick a cat staring at me sideways like Jack Knives
Think you even rap you must be on a crack pipe
Spit dope lines until you overdose and flatline

It's the K double O T S kid, follow where I go and get left in the cesspit
Leave a mark on your fez with a green tip
Creep in the dark and I bring it till the beats skip

It's the K double O T S kid, follow where I go and get left in the cesspit
Leave a mark on your fez with a green tip
Creep in the dark and I bring it till the beats skip",https://genius.com/Adam-koots-the-boy-who-kicked-the-beez-nest-lyrics
