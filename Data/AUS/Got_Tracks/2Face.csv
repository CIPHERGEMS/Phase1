Be Alright,,2015,"yeah this one right here this for anyone

who's ever thought about the ends I know

we've all been there at some point

but there is a way out you can find

happiness in your life it's out there

throw this one on and just find out you

know check it out man

these rainy days take away from the Sun

but we'll never stop pushing till the

day that we're done cuz we got the wheel

tire and the tried to be great divided

we hate but stop you're like the poverty

rate hey we need to push the positivity

when all your living in hell let's crack

it like the Liberty Bell if there ever

is the way that I can help you with

skipper if you're left out in the cold

then I can help you relate cause I miss

the same life by Pravana with sins did I

become the wrong man don't belong to my

skin all these years I'm this

then I don't know jack I can't find my

fucking place and I won't go back no

just a lost soul looking for a home one

day I hope I minded but but now I will

roam with my eyes on the path of my

children let's go ahead we can't be in

the thing that

it'll be

tell me what's on your mind it's okay

Oh

unlike any man the battles all these

angels and demons are these people

really friends are they strangers that

scheme and seeming words are often harsh

and I'm keeping it cold will the people

even listen if I'm speaking my soul whoa

I don't know man I don't know but every

now and then it gets a little out of

control I don't have to fucking speak up

at least myself but I'm not preaching to

the people I'm still teaching myself to

these words fireman it's safer to live

in the truth I guarantee there's someone

out there who will listen to you yeah

and give yourself a reason to live make

some plans for your future you can be

where this is and when you get the rock

bottom on a stinky mix I'll know there's

always something there that you can

think of it's okay

just you know

it does my negativity speaks and I don't

even feel like living when my vision is

weak when I've given up a note because

I'm destined to fail the frost of the

wind is colder when it says Latino yes

but then I think about the true for this

life what kind of person but not me

without the proof of the stripes through

all the pain there is something we can

if you don't learn a fucking lesson

you're not playing this game

yes and people ask about the purpose of

life if you're looking for a purpose and

your purpose is right if you ask a bunch

of questions and you learn a bunch of

lessons and you'll never second guessing

than your life's a fucking blessing the

lights flash so no one's gonna replace

ed if he tries to be

No

you

in your life

rid of all that negative energy

there is a light at the end at a time

you
