Crumbs,,2018,"Hey, hey, hey
Hey, how you doing baby?
You look mighty fine, I figured I might come your way and roll up on you with that golden ticket
Shawty, can I get your digits, maybe we can kick it
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh babe, think I knew what's next, oh
Double tapped and followed, then she hit me with that text, oh
She wanna know me more than just a homie
I can see from those emojis wanna be all on me
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, wow we can take it slow now
Tell me what you like, I'll take you where you want to go now
How you going to make them plans then cancel on the same night
Trying to take it forward with you, you're more like a merry-go-round, oh wow
Wait, wait wait, wait
What the hells up for god sake?
Real talk when you talk fake, girl you making that backache
I was picking up where we left off
But you know I'm all for the chase
Running thin on my patience, when you say things, it keeps changing
You just wait till all my time is up
You just wait till all my, you just wait till all my
Know you'll want me when my time is up
You want me when my, uh, just want me when my
Miss me with your games I've had enough
Keep wasting all my, uh, you keep wasting all my
You'll just want me when my time is up, babe
Now you want it babe, now you want it, want it babe
Okay, I'm just chilling, yah
She texting, yeah let's catch up
Oh, are you for real? Well, take a second let's back up
You say you want to catch up like a last time, or the last time
Or the last-last-last-last time, you had 10 chances, ain't had five
If you really cared, think a bribe would come through regardless
I ain't trying to be the dude to sound heartless
I ain't trying to be the dude to take garbage
Other  need a truce so what you need to do
Don't hit me up if you ain't follow through
'Cause I can't deal with this flakery
This shit got more crumbs than a bakery
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Telephone, ring-ring on that hotline bling-bling
I'm just on my ting-ting, here to make them sing-sing
Here to make them dance, uh
You get no more chances
Don't collect two hundred just head straight past go to jail, uh
Oh wow, damn, she bad, she know she's bad, but that don't give you a free pass, got no free pass
Me and Tentendo we just laugh 'cause you like mirrors without glass, you know I see through it
You just wait till all my time is up
Know you'll want me when my time is up
Miss me with your games I've had enough
'Cause I know, just know, just know, just how you play, ah, got no time for games, won't you stay up out my way, ah
You just wait till all my time is up
Just wait till all my, you just wait till all my
Know you'll want me when my time is up
You want me when my ah, just want me when my
Miss me with your games I've had enough
You wasted all my, you keep wasting all my
You'll just want me when my time is up babe
Now you want it babe, now you want it-want it babe",https://genius.com/Jordan-dennis-crumbs-lyrics
Outta Space,,2017,"So many people in the world why this happen to me?
I don't understand like you're speaking Latin to me
I thought, life was like a cat fall flat on your feet
But I was wrong so I gotta cop that on the cheek

All I wanted was to be a producer
This is not what I'm used to
Wakin' everybody like I'm a rooster
Now I gotta stay low key like a bass tone
I need to strength to fight off the stones that they throwin'

It's cancerous
This an emergency someone call the ambulance
I can't stand the risk that awaits me
But I have a Good Father that's amazing grace b

And though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I know that you're holding my world together

It's like you vanished without a trace
And now I'm stranded in outer space
And I can't even find a way to my escape
Claustrophobia I'm outta space
I'm outta space

(I need some room to breathe, this pain is so new to me)
I'm outta space
(I know I gotta turn to you, but man I broke when I heard the news)
I'm outta space
(This is hard to face, but I know that you'll keep me safe)
I'm outta space
(Where do I go from here? I really can't feel you near)
I'm outta space

This is all so new to me I feel out of place
I never been so high up in outer space
Heard a lot of people quit so if that's the case
I can't imagine the things I'm about to face (yeah)

But I'm backin' I'll see more
Than Hansel, Gretel or Jack and the Beanstalk
It don't matter what he thought
I reached for the stars
Regardless what my range is like it was Queens Park

I don't care about the deficit
Or my ear how deaf is it
Boy I came to play like Love & James
I didn't come just to run away

And though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I know that you're holding my world together

So many questions but not enough time
So many lessons in all of this grind
I been workin' and I been searchin'
But all I know is that I'm outta my mind
If I think that I can understand you
And all the things that you're putting me through
But I know, that's it's all for the better
So I pray, that you keep me together

So many questions but not enough time
So many lessons in all of this grind
I been workin' and I been searchin'
But all I know is that I'm outta my mind
If I think that I can understand you
And all the things that you're putting me through
But I know that's it's all for the better
So I pray that you keep me together",http://www.songlyrics.com/k-wak-feat-jordan-dennis/outta-space-lyrics/
