Any Day,The Return,2019,"Good God
Check the varn on the lexicon
Sound horn
To the song so they sing along
One round
On the lawn
With the African sun
Sun Ra make a God
Wish he never born
Yah yah
Building wealth
For the seeds of jah
But y’all
Make a call from the money board
It’s art this I know but it seem that y’all
Wanna have a brawl
Judge and jury
We can do it

Any day, Any day
Any day, Any dah

Sampa
Busy bee
Father I object this
Talking ‘bout the next this
Everything is everything
I’m writing my objectives
Art is so subjective
Leave us while you sing along
Monkey with a rifle
Winning idols
At the best award
That’s to your accord
Recognise my art
I don’t need your praise
To write the chords
All smoke and
All mirror shit
It’s not art with
No niggas in it
Rooting for the youngest
Who are covered
In gorilla spit
Shouting we unworthy
‘Cos our families are all immigrants
Who decides the bar
And who decide to raise it yuh
Same song sing along
If you play it
Token art and
Token legacy
All rigged up
In the industry
No vision
No visionaries
White out in
All my ancestry
CHORUS
Whosane
Don’t forget the
Hands that feed yah
Don’t depend on it
-
Woe is me
Past is still the past
It’s a choice if you erase it
Facts still the facts
Making noise on my playlist
How I’m ‘pose to learn
My mistakes If you erase it
Know my self If you debase it
Love myself if you degrade it
I’m too proud though
Too uppity
Tryna fit in
Too ruggedly
Speaking loud noise
To disturb the peace
We don’t want no peace
8 straight years hip-hop
Didn’t look like me
Now it’s all change
Don’t applaud for no empathy
Smiling all around
I won’t stop until I look
And see a black run festival
Owned by some melanin
Ahead I’m in
Age and mentality
Phase your normality
Rage abnormality
Freedom totality
Straight black Alchemy
We can do it

Whosane
Don’t forget the
Hands that feed you
Don’t depend on it

Time is nearly gone spending it all on my lyrical
Vibes nearly gone
Me and they have been making miracles
Have a passion for it
Passion is delight
Wish there were never distance right now
I would be your wife wah
Go on to the world yea only for a minute
Girls throwing shade on yah for a minute
In the light of day the kinda way you make me feel
I’ve been thinking for a minute and I know
It’s only real the way I was been real
Don’t even have to fake it
The make up and my sneakers baggy pants
I don’t fake it
Raw on the outside, I’m from beautiful
Physical majestic it’s spiritual connected
I'd like to open your third eye, and look inside
Your spirit is long your heart is white

And we can tour the world but
I know I only just met you
And in another life
That’s when I currently get you
Expectations never been sailing on tomorrow
Juggling with happiness
Strutting with my sorrows
Maybe I just felt you
Maybe preservation
Maybe I’m not thinking straight
Time for meditation
Meaning you were fireworks standing dynamite
And maybe rainbows in the middle of the night
I'd to open your third eyes
And look inside
Your spirit is long your heart is white

And I keep up the momentum
And in time you’ll be my blessing
And I know I’m only stressing

Something 'bout magnificence

Ohh! that lady got some lip
From my Mom I got the gift
We just pour some peace in it

No I was not woke I was live in a concert
And I spread my voice I was choked and belittled
Then I resurrected part two as the sequel

Gotta stand tall we the ones we the people
Look me in the eyes this the cards you’ve been dealt
I don't need your table I can sit by myself

You disrespect the womb
Where life all come from and it is to whom
You're praises due or your race is doomed
Eat pussy like the last supper then kudos to you

Overnight and it seems
The support I've been receiving
Is the best that I've seen
And I’m keen
Oh and it’s amazing
Yes I have been guessin’
What this queen has landed from
Africa has landed from
Everyone has landed in my world, take your landing gear
Everyone's a visitor, thank you all for landing here (woah)

Mine was clearly chosen I know
Every step I take premeditated
Every night I meditated

Their water thinner than blood
And I ain’t talk to them in years for them my shit my blood

Three steps forward
Five steps back
We make the strides
We knock ‘em back
I'm so confused
Matter of fact
I think I'm being advertised as
Your bubble see through
Token black
One mask fits all but mine is getting
Uncomfortable, uncomfortable
Uncomfortable, uncomfortable

Flow, bye river, bye river
Bye river, bye river
Flow, bye river, bye river
Bye river, bye river
I heard it from Mars
Ooh break it down two rivers are meeting now
I heard it from mars
Ooh break it down
Two rivers are meeting now

Let your yes be yes and your no be no
Gained the whole world for the price of your soul
When your enemies won't reach their goal
All the memories will bring you home
One step back for your inspiration
Never keep pressed on your situation
Always be sure in, third eye open
Still enforcing, so exhausting
River flow deep in silent motion
Raised on seeds of mass proportion
Growing in a world of mass distortion
Please keep you through trials forcing
Through hella, five feet Bella
One slick talking, black Cinderella
Real fast walking
Smooth shit jazz shit smile through rain and sing through havoc

She goes through deep shores
She flows through deep storms
She knows where she goes

Queen shit tho, cautious
How do you navigate through all this systematic
System antics, still keep smiling stuck in traffic
Masking itch face
I'm tired of asking, bitch face
Shy as fuck, I'm new on turf
My days are numbered on this earth
An ocean almost carried you Down Under
You're gonna have to find your tune Down Under
Shit really look Snow White down under
How you supposed to, be black down under
The puzzle piece the match is fixed
The new wave has been here for years
The same two step and the same blueprint
Old school meets bold school takeover shit
Action on plan, fan on fam
Now I am who I am
Uncomfortable uncomfortable
Uncomfortable uncomfortable

She goes through deep shores
She flows through deep storms

Late night conversations talk to myself
Get outta your mind, like a minute I was outta my time
I still out of my prime, my journey while I'm walking in line
Is a journey that I'm walking in time
Throwback to the miners I can find
And them ghetto got the giggles who would shot at their arm
Just a ripple in time, just a measure of mine
Just beginner in the challenge of life, life, life, life

How slow can you go?
You see she be on
I’m sicken
All up in hell kitchen
Cooking up the new wave
Biting my fruition
Not candid
Half of y’all can’t stand it
Chocolate on your box screen
Seasoning intended
Not fighting
I’m already shining
Dripping in precision
Tell me who is better, who is better?
Sammy
All up on your Gram(ie)
Looking for my circle
So they find a way to at me
Small family
They can’t even stand me
Bloodstream dripping
Said we sipping gold
In family
Truly
How you try to do me
School me to the industry
And now you tryna do me
Not tripping
Looking how I’m living
Inner peace is dripping
Tell me
Who is better, who is better?

Hell’s fury taste like a slushie
Play safe Devil don’t touch me
Met on the highway to freedom
Said the World’s ugly
Made in his image in garden of eden
The naked truth
Of the spiritual war demons took despicable
Falling men with backs on the wall
My black soul is a black gold
Can’t be sold a perfect stone
I was born with no price tag
Carried along in a weather storm
Still strong a soldier on some God mode
Now do you research how do I work
Like an eternal melody when the beat’s on
Church drums got me perfecting Hallelujahs
I been a buddha in the midst
A black jesus resurrected
Success ladder we move up
Even tho shackled in skin prison
We got weapons like the music so
Lets beginning
Song of freedom till the end and it goes
Get me out of your heart full of hate I cannot stand
Just let me play my part if I ain’t black am another man
Do you understand what it takes to be in my shoes
My physical vehicle on the news away from Sudan
Still don’t lose
We keep the essence linked up with Sampa the Great
To give them the message
So instead a crack epidemic
Excellent blacks representing.. wattup

You can’t really sum up what is infinite and valuable

Give us her energy so she heal mine

Bet you though they spitting in your face

How you tryna cover where you from like we forgotten?
Back when we were sipping on our sugar tea for dinner
Back when you was hustling, back when you was struggling
Right before we dared to dream of how we would come up of in
A strange cold world of the lowest of the lowest
You made it but you standing on a pyramid of hopeless
'Cause now you were everybody hope is
Everybody jokers
Everybody know that they provoke this
Try to tell you where they think your goals is
Everybody motives
When you try to dream with what you have
All a sudden fingers pointing see the vultures
Everybody wrote this, everybody mad
Everybody stunted on the chances that they had
 Think of the all expectations everybody had
Took it on your shoulders and wore everybody's bag

I beg again, let me explain
I might be gorgeous in the darkness

I’m not ashamed, been passive
Trying to fit a circle 'cause I don’t know how to act shit
Half of y’all is steady insecure, don’t try to backflip
Just because the seasoning of flow's already active
Only four years, fantastic, young veteran, new classic
Nah, knock the walls off
Fuck the whole key, we gon' hinge the whole door off
I’m still A.D., never forget it
It’s life after death, roll the credits

I hate to say my feelings for you still exist

Credit my maker, take a trip to see Jamaica
Marley spirit with the paper, back to Zion, that’s the nature
Africa the new America, I hope our run is permanent
And this I put my pen in it, got my land and my permit with it
Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh
Greatness in me, you can’t make me feel less

When you write your fears and hopes on a paper
Music is the way I acknowledge the maker
Fortunately it's my art
What you listening to is my heart
I probably lose heart cos I share it so much
I probably lose friends ‘cos I care about my people more than cashing out stars
Peace to the ones on my side as my equals
Peace to the ones bridging gaps of the people

I sing songs from the heart cos

But I got the keys and the key is to me
So I'm free let it be now all is forgiven
This how I lean now
This is how I rock
This is where it be when your soul ain't locked
This is how it be when you take control
Looking to the future and it’s paved in gold
I will never lose myself is me
All my happiness and energy
Stuck up in the clouds and lifted up
Imma let it go let it be let it be let it be

F.R.E.E why and you
Contemplating Y.O.U
Concentrating why aren't you

Man this shit is flawless
Cracking up the scars
It's standing on your doorstep
It's like trying
Seeing it's just trying
Hear through the pain
A symphony is crying
You've been complex
Hated cos you’re complex
Simply your song is
Harder in the sonics
But you’re smiling
Now you’re out here smiling
Only now you know you're
Complex by designing

And I'm back for the rise
Coulda lost hope
But I dropped my pride
Coulda stayed low
When I lost my stride
Coulda let go to the pain inside
Coulda but no I got up and I'm living
Couldn't stayed low but I'm up and I'm driven
Gotta let it go in your soul
Cos you know
It can slow how you go
When you ain't done healing
This is how I lean now
This is how I rock
This is where it be when your soul ain't locked
This is where it be when you take control
Looking to the future and it’s paved in gold
I will never lose myself is me
All my happiness and energy
Stuck up in the clouds and I'll stay up
Imma let it go let it be let it be let it be let it be

If you don't know now you know
If u ain't sure you gon know

Karma The Villain,Birds And The BEE9,2017,"I hate to keep on telling you it's mental
This is what I meant tho
I can take a cape and turn it into what it's meant for
Everyone's a villain I just wear it like it's meant to
Everyone's a villain I can teach you like a mentor
Caged birds still flying high up in rhetoric
Caged from the monster he currently living with
Truth too deep blind eye so to hell with it
Demons keep on burning for the hell of it
See no more of your point it's irrelevant
I don't give a fuck how you feel you're an element
I'm too deep I could sell my intelligence
I'm too deep I could sell my intelligence
Spit on a nigga watch him fall into a rabbit hole
Go so deep see him turn into a rabid soul
Two baggy eyes see him seeing with no vision
Ima show you how to turn a hero to a villain
Flying from wings on sky income
In from planets from
In your dreams I'm as real as they come
Like bad things I'm indigo try and come
In this deep but you're never gonna leave the dome
Muhahaha
Your closet couldn't hold me
Hidden in yourself don't you act like you don't know me
Triggered by depression and you just too weak to hold me
A hero to a villain that's exactly what you showed me I've seen
Real life demons with their mask off
Real human looking like fiends with their mask off
Real life smiling in your face with their mask off
Real life looking in the mirror with their mask off
Real life knife in your back with the mask off r
Real life Imma get em back with the mask off
Real life Imma hurt em back with the mask off
Real life now you a villain with the mask off
Make way for instrumentals
Justice in law and order only incidental
I'll abuse my power all my power from the people
All my heroes tripping on their egos
Bloodshot eyes looking like the joker with no disguise
What's the tripping point where darkness leads to your demise
What's the evil thought currently running through your mind
What's the balance keeping you from running in your mind
No hope for the future when the black boy gunned
No hope for my siblings when the black gunned down
He raise his fist in anger when the black go down
He turned into a villain buy his black boys guns
I am not your enemy I'm just merely invested
Let me take this cape I admit that it's majestic
The colour looking great I admit that it's majestic
Now won't you put this mask on cos I think that it's majestic
I've seen
Real life demons with their mask off
Real human looking like fiends with their mask off
Real life smiling in your face with their mask off
Real life money in my face with their mask off
Real life knife in your back with the mask off
Real life Imma get em back with the mask off
Real life Imma hurt em back with the mask off
Real life now you a villain with the mask off

When my engine lost its spark
When my vision blurred and I can't be heard

And I can't be sure enough

And the voice within me shut

And we don't dance around with my heart

In the midst of friends and foes

And you reaching all your goals
When the light, it shines within you

Say to me when the beats go hard
Resonate and I feel my spark
And I don't dance around with my heart

And I'm past all game with niggas
And I can't thank you, niggas

I love you all to death
Gotta get by but honestly patience withers
I won't understand the pain you witness

Chained
Name changed

Ain't shit changed
Power to the people
And I spit I spit one two
I need my love but I need you too
Forgive my heart for not being with you
You need to know that I bleed out too

Raised by stars and all of her’s

Change your scene if you ain't seen a black queen
Walk with Wolves and I beat waves with the back of my thighs
Natural anatomy
I naturally block arteries
And I can give you a clue as to who would use us
If a black queen useless
Then your black skin useless

Rhymes To The East,Birds And The BEE9,2017,"As your enemies gather to plan your downfall and setbacks
God shall confuse and dismiss them in seven directions
You shall be blessed seven times more until the blessed call you blessed

Bone crushing, I'm sweating, oh my God
I'm in a game and I just found that I used all nine lives
I paid the price and now I'm feeling I don't own my bars
If they announce it in the news, you don't know my number
So please peace nah, phone sitting in the arena
All black faces, they gone figure who we are
Underground railroad, trials and troubles too
We gone build these pyramids right up of under you
Run the game and paving way for passion and paining
I just want my soul, you just entertainment
So I enter training for that inter changing
I’mma sell you hope, you gon’ enter trading
High pretty, blind city, sigh pity
With the flashing lights in check, add some zeros to the cheque
'Cause I'm bleeding bloody rhythms on this beat right here
Bloody blurry baby visions on this beat right here
Replications are impossible, truth is like the gospel
But I'm hardly pentecostal on this beat right here

Black vocals, black t-shirt
Docs, jeans and a choker
I hardly do flush but I’mma flash my vocals
I hardly do magic but that black girl kosher
I’mma pray for this beat before I kill them culture vultures

I'm not going to fall (Ish not petite)
Play me small (Ish not petite)
Lose my soul (Ish not petite)
Be scared no more (Ish not petite)

And I ain’t gonna waste my strength standing here all day
You know we here okay

Rhymes beast, motherfucker
Tembo from the East put the beast in a trucker
Timbuktu, as I question all the loyalty
Build a big wall when you stole all of the royalties
Trash, it's what you know you don't know
The level of the brain that you're told you can't go
The level of insane that you’re told you can't show
The level of insane that they’re sure that I know
Four million spans ago, a waste man
Told me of the limits he thinks that I am
I've moved mountains, know that I can
I've healed souls, I know that I am
I bleed bled blood but I breathe bad blood
Badabing breath blood but I bring black back
Blessed, blow a breeze through my chest
Blessed, and before I forget

I hardly do flash but I'mma flash my vocals
I hardly do magic but that black girl kosher

I watch out my window pain

CHORUS
The Return

Sampa
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Bringing me in on back
Bring me in on fast
Living with my armour I’m
Tryna find me fast
Take me to my soul
Everything I know
I just want my spirit to wander off no more
Everything is here
Everything familiar
Everything I’ve seen and it’s everything I hear
Bring me in on near
Bring me to my soul
Take me to my spirit
And Bring me in back home
Because
I’m coming back
I’m coming back
I’m coming back home

I’m coming back home

Thando
Broken, bruised and battered
Wandering this world aimlessly
As the house nigga of this country
As the house nigga of this country
I'd better find myself
Before I breed my self hate into this world
*2
Alien
I’m not here to plead
Or ask for your sympathy
Are you too blind to see
Who’s the blackest?
Is medicine your sole benefit
Did you develop it to for your menacing?
You wave your arms in victory
The cost of your opportunity
I don’t want ‘em
You’re so clean and brown
So clean and brown

Ooh
To tell yourself the truth
Is hard to do
Ooh
The little lies
That build up just to get me through
Ooh
My day to day
My day to day
My day to fade away
Hide these eyes away
From the hard truths that you have to face
The world keeps turning
It will always change
Accept yourself
Return to late
Return to self
Return your fate
Return to love
Return to love
Return return
Yeiy yeah
Whosane
The return
The return
The return
The return
Cos tomorrow’s not promised for me
Seeing my single momma
Surviving to struggle this way
(The return)
The return
The return
Of myself
To myself
Yo
This is the real story
I just wanna be back man
I just wanna be back
I wanna be back in the right state of mind
I wanna be back to my happy self
I wanna be back to my passionate mindset
I wanna be me again you know
Cos I
This sounds like I’m tryna do that RnB shit
But yo
Let me slow it down
To
It’s hard out here for a brother and sister
Going through this immigration mindset
We tryna find our own spot in here
And music is my way of expressing
My return
My self
My beginnings
I just wanna be me
I hope you can understand
And that’s where I’m at
So
Return to oneself
Return to the motherland
Return to your mind
Return

Mama said everyone will find their home
Everyone will go back to their homes
No one should forget their home

The Truth,Birds And The BEE9,2017,"Smooth like a river when Sampa Tembo flows
You couldn't catch a rhyme if it married your toes
Never heard a villain like the one in my songs
Imma show how the Rhythm follow everywhere I go
Motherland Rhythm cancel all of your gimmick
Come give me anyone who can swim on my lyrics
I ain't sharing
You got nothing to crap on
You don't know Black you got nothing to rap on
You don't know oppression
You got nothing to rap from
Lemme here another man steeping in the motherland
Lemme see a gimmick
They ain't nothing you can mimic
In the truth",https://genius.com/Sampa-the-great-the-truth-lyrics

Yah
It’s the return black excellence
Don’t sit next to us
Lay it down like scripture
Jah bless God invest in us
Blackface industry
Lying don’t invest in me
Only want the money off our backs
Like history
In the industry I’m not a slave on a record
I rose brave, call it blessings
Acute angle out the rat race
I keep from going under
Time ticking for families holding the spears
Deception is equity used to buy your melody, all I hear

I seen the industry
Kill dreams of a dreamer
Kill dreams of a dreamer
Kill dreams of a dreamer
Kill dreams of a dreamer
I seen the industry scheme
And it’s a killer
I seen the industry
Kill dreams of a dreamer
Kill dreams of a dreamer
I seen the industry scheme
And it’s a killer
It’s a master plan to break you
I’m the scheme
They the schemer
[Verse 2: Sampa, 
Krown
]
Yuh
Time’s up
Black republic
Want all my work republished
How many times
I inspired your rhymes
Then you redubbed it
We the inspiration
We the motivation
Take our ideas and then you resell it
In variations
The hour glass I’ma crack it
The fatter the cream, the blacker the talent
I’m taking matters in hands
I’d rather challenge
The industry
Got no dignity
Putting my fam up
Next to me
Searching for their diversity
Nervous
You know that I can see
All is I see is a bunch of mechanical breakdown
Do it till the planet break down
On a mission to free ourselves
Verbally medicated put on the shelf
We not for sale neither asking for help
And I ain’t asking for help
We not asking for help
We not for sale
Not asking for help!
Not out to get you
Or in rage
We just searching for self
Go fuck yourself
Fuck the game
Fuck the playing
Fuck the aud-ience
Fuck the dance
Fuck the list
Fuck the ARIA’s

Cos I’ve seen the industry
Kill dreams of a dreamer
Kill dreams of a dreamer
Kill dreams of a dreamer
And I’ve seen the industry scheme
And it’s a killer
And I’ve seen the industry
Kill the dreams of a dreamer
Kill the dreams of a dreamer
And I’ve seen the industry scheme
And it’s a killer
It’s a master plan to break you
I’m the scheme
And they the schemer

Wake Up (Interlude),The Return,2019,"Your phone's still off
Sampa,  for real
Everyone's  calling me because they can't get through to you and I actually don't even know what to tell them anymore
I don't even know where you are
Listen, I get what you're dealing with a hundred percent
And  it's really hard and it's rough
But  we're black
And you're black in the music industry, no less
This  is just how it is
You just have to be able to deal
I don't think you have time for all this finding yourself spiritual shit
And I think you need to focus on the fact that we're here and we're all here with you
Girl,  you need to wake up
Call me back",https://genius.com/Sampa-the-great-wake-up-interlude-lyrics
WEOO,The Great Mixtape,2015,"Yo
Six cars, five stars, and applause
Really couldn't get me dumb and down on my boss
Even if I'm dreamin' that my soul and my heart
They be leavin' I'm achievin' all my soul's pawpaw
The promise of the golden life is really in the reach
Ignorant but conscious, practice what you preach
Even though I'm livin' on the minimum wage
If I sold my soul for profit am I still getting played
If I'm still getting played, am I still getting made?
All I've ever dreamed for
I was made to be great
I was made to be great
I was made to be great
But the woman in the mirror lookin' awfully unfamiliarly
Ohhh, nothing you can tell me
The passion and the purpose and the prosper ain't free
I wonder will I woke with what I have
If I'm willing to backstab my own people for a pass at it
(Chorus)
Really changin'
Rise of fate
And I ask, would you really give me everything you want to?
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
If I really really want this
And I know this have a past
A beginning and the end, the future and the past
I'm the white, yellow, brown
I'm the black
And I am as a matter of fact
Would it really hurt if I called myself great
Somethin' that I thought that I would never equate
Some of us dreamers
Some of us are not
Some got it together
Some of us lost
Some of us lust
Some of us love
Some of us trust
Some of us not about to put our whole heart
In the passion and the dream
That we not even sure that we even thus deemed to
Be
Being better than I thought I had
Being stronger in the heart and the head
I wonder will I walk without a hat, mama
Willing to backstab my own people for a price
(Chorus)
Really changin'
Rise of fate
And I ask, would you really give me everything you want to?
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
If I really really want this",https://genius.com/Sampa-the-great-weoo-lyrics
