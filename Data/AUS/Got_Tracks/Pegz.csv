7 Days 6 Nights,Burn City,2007,"Seven days, six nights in paradise
Eleven months of hard work building an appetite
A lifetime of dedication to keep you satisfied
Catch a mystery flight into a rapper's mind
Unwind like a beach in Byron
Or a full moon party at the Phi Phi Islands
Find relief, when you need reviving
Leave behind the city like freedom fighters
Stress relief like sex on ecstasy
Forty eight weeks to invest in equity
Don't sleep like meth dependency
You'll get gunned down like Tibetan refugees
Nothing lasts forever, it's impermanence
Turn you into fossil fuels and keep burning it
Every day starting from scratch and relearning it
Every day study the math and seek purposes

, 7 Days 6 Nights
Ten thousand miles from a perfect life

Seven days, six nights of animal instincts
A one-way ticket, travelling business
Random acts of passion and kinship
Back packing through Paris in winter
Damage your liver, with a Japanese stripper
And wake up in a national geographical picture
It don't matter if a mans got millions
If his minds still living in the Bangkok Hilton
As the clock ticks and the hand strikes midnight
Drinks flowing like a Bondi riptide
Whole crew sitting front row ringside
Shining like northern lights with insight
Pack my bags, build my posterior
Like an old Enfield across India
Ride till the wheels come off in Bolivia
Intoxicated, lost in Siberia

, 7 Days 6 Nights
Ten thousand miles from a perfect life

Seven days, six nights, an annual vacation
Depart from the everyday stress of maintaining
Arrive wherever the next wave takes us
Fugitives running from yesterdays wasted
Forget about cars, petrol, parking
Forget about leaving the rental market
Forget about debt to the sheriff's department
And the government made us a terrorist target
Seven days, six nights, five early flights
Four clubs, three bottles of Bourbon Dry
Two murky eyes, one dirty mind
No regrets for anything I learn in life

Ali Shuffle,Burn City,2007,"Yeah, yeah, yeah

Suede Air Stabs, shaved hair cut
Black Evisu's with one leg cuffed
Bape up top with the raider's death touch
Obese knuckle duster, take the head off
Oh! Felling better now, polo frames keep the weather out
Stainless tag keeps ahead of now
Terry towel Kangol, ready to wet the crowd
Tipsy off the breath of Jennifer's wedding vows
Take your best shot, we can box for twenty rounds
Believed in myself so nobody could tear me down
Building confidence like a Bricky's callous'
And fifty thousand dark and risky challenges
People wrote me off like Jason Donovan
Every breath I take's a waste of oxygen
Now my names synonymous with great accomplishments
Ultimate Hater couldn't shake my confidence

Gotta work hard to not break the hearts that love you
The rest is all show like the Ali Shuffle
The rest is all show, the rest is all show
The rest is all show like the Ali Shuffle

I didn't wait for a deal to get my name on the bill
I came up on my own, putting faith in the skill1
Hitting switches on the grave shift radio real
Pushing cherry bar battles didn't pay the bills
But it laid the foundation, gave me salvation
Taught me how to handle the biz without patience
They said I'd never make it off Central Station
And I exceeded everyone's expectations
Gotta do my thing cause death is waiting
Like desperate housewives on medication
Oh! feeling better now, ready to get it out
More conviction than a politician's rent-a-crowd
Spitting a phrase with hip-hop relevance
Gripping the breaks like six pot callipers
Scum's so dirty, can't rinse off elements
Building confidence like a kid's intelligence

Gotta work hard and not break the hearts that love you
The rest is all show like the Ali Shuffle
The rest is all show, the rest is all show
The rest is all show like the Ali Shuffle
Gotta work hard and not break the hearts that love you
The rest is all show like the Ali Shuffle
The rest is all show, the rest is all show
The rest is all show like the Ali Shuffle

I'm feeling optimistic but it's hard to come through
'Cause making music's not half the struggle
Gotta work hard and not break the hearts that love you
The rest is all show like the Ali Shuffle
Boo yah boo yah, take a glimpse of the future
No crystal ball, we got kids in the schoolyard
Kings on the street like linked by computer
Clockers on the rooftop singing like a crooner
No pain, no gain, some drown, some break
Some people just survive to tell their fate
Some dedicate everything to elevate
Some fall off and only got themselves to blame
I'm not intimidating, it's not a competition
I'm building confidence every song I've written
Trying to push my sounds beyond the limits
Like the Wu-Tang tape in my Honda Civic

Gotta work hard and not break the hearts that love you
The rest is all show like the Ali Shuffle
The rest is all show, the rest is all show
The rest is all show like the Ali Shuffle",https://genius.com/Pegz-ali-shuffle-lyrics
Back Then,Axis,2005,"Yeah!
Back then, didn't need the buzz
Russian Alex had Reebok pumps
Big Gaz had Nike T dubs
Everybody wanted Nike sneakers
I saved up for a pair of Jordans
And spent all day dubbing tapes for Walkmans
Who remembers Ice T was king?
Flat tops were in, Swatches were bling
I couldn't comprehend my sisters intrepidity
Mohawks, Cherry Docs, Dead Kennedy's
Pegz memories are bonafide
But perceptions change over time
Yeah I still love cars and motorbikes
Give me coconut sauce and a bowl of rice
Keep my soul alive, control the mics
Bruce Lee versus poltergeist

Back then wasn't easy, back then things worked out
Back then I wish you were now
Back then wasn't easy, back then things worked out
Back then I wish you were now

Ducking transit cops and gumbies
Menzies Ave was a real Jumanji
Windsor flats, St. Kilda junkies
Steal your money like which bank?
Girls didn't seem so superficial
Levi jeans and a blue light disco
Let's go back when baseball caps meant
Racking cans, police harassment
Star Wars, street assassin
Collector's Corner, feed the passion
Bootlegs from Central Station
KRS One's revelation
Knowledge and self-preservation
Fuck racism and president Reagan
Remember days when I first tried rapping
Cabs were black white, ""till you get enough""

Back then wasn't easy, back then things worked out
Back then I wish you were now
Back then wasn't easy, back then things worked out
Back then I wish you were now

Everyone had humble intentions
DJ Koopz had a couple of lessons
Belt-drives, double cassette decks
Tandy mics with the budget connections
Back then, I scrubbed floors and packed shelves
And left school to get away and hang out
Phone boxes, pinball parlours
Showing off like an ignoramus
Whole crew had a crush on Tiffany
And got played like a Mozart symphony
Bronx infamy, Compton attitude
Flannelette shirts and Adidas parachutes
Bomber jackets, turtle Ray Bans
New Balance, purple stained hands
Little Ben got burned by spray cans
And I'm still hear reverberations

Back then, didn't need the buzz
Back then, hadn't seen enough
Back then, always dreaming of
B-girls in the classroom steaming hot
Homeboys at the station being hard
Beat box on the train, MC in the park
Getting chased by cops, piss in the yards
Back then, I lived the meaning of art

Back then wasn't easy, back then things worked out
Back then I wish you were now
Back then wasn't easy, back then things worked out
Back then I wish you were now
Back then wasn't easy, back then things worked out
Back then I wish you were now",https://genius.com/Pegz-back-then-lyrics
Before I Leave,Burn City,2007,"Define me like a lion defines the whole jungle
Definition of street and humble
Like Bruce Lee in Rumble in the Bronx summoned to the top
Like we just stumbled across Rapunzel's locks, ah
Whatever Barney Gumble gots I want it
Plutonic blaze, hitting harder than bubonic plague
A convict, confiscate
Record to take the weight off like Fonda's tapes (yo)
Everyone's like Charlie Chaplin
And Tom Cruise is actin' like Michael Jackson
It's crazy, maybe the global warming
Or maybe, just the famous are fallin'
Call me Pauly Polter, roll in a six
White like a polar bear stare a solar eclipse
Kick the goal like kids switch kick flippin' the rock and roll
On top of the bowl, that's control

It's Obese
 here to leave impressions
Beathedz
 bring the heat relentless
Crooked eye
 'bout to speak the essence
""I came too far not to be respected""

Before I leave, I'm settin' benchmarks each release
Rock, debut drop retiree
And every disc between and I'ma be seen
With at least one Veronica, sittin' on a beach
Sippin' something sweet, somewhere in the tropics
Fat wallet in my deep pockets
For now I got no cash, no smash hit
Just dash and tip the next shit, no slash, no asterix
When the champagne bottles pop, victory cigars lit
I'll leave my classics and an arse to kiss
You believe the cheek of this kid?
Believing nobody out equal this except a few at the top
Before he hit the door, I thought I'd drop a send off fit for a boss
I'm on a track with Pegz, so that's one less task left
On my list to address before I leave

It's Obese
 here to leave impressions
Beathedz
 bring the heat relentless
Crooked eye
 'bout to speak the essence
""I came too far not to be respected""

Before I leave, I want a house with no lease
And bed down with a fatter mamma than Obese
Drunk in the streets, running a muck
Junk hanging out the front like a Peking duck
Pump mad weights, get large as hell
So I can hang around with pussy like Gargamel
From getting blow once a year like a birthday candle
To getting more chicks than Heffner can handle
Moved from Coburg to Coburg North
From a bedroom flat, to a house with a porch
Get mad rich, make a smash hit song
And be the first in the charts that won't feature Akon
Go triple plat with the best rap tune
Collect my award in an Adidas bapsuit
If it's all bad and my plan turns shitty
At least they can say that he rocked burn city
[Chorus:

It's Obese
 here to leave impressions
Beathedz
 bring the heat relentless
Crooked eye
 'bout to speak the essence
""I came too far not to be respected""

Yeah
I thought I knew the difference, between the music business
And gay rappers break dancin' on Euro Vision
But who will listen to somebody with a shoe addiction?
Livin' with their mums, talking about their crew is pimpin'
Spinal tap with laptops and final scratch
This is for my real DJs, bringin' the vinyl back
On a diamond back, with a biker's patch
Twenty inch biceps, covered in tribal tats
Chasin' hits like a junkie ho
One dole day, walkin' down Studley Road
Got a beautiful mind and a heart of gold
But you don't want to push me 'round like Russell Crowe
Not a role model, God father, that's not me
If I touch a few souls, that's extraordinary
But all I want is respect, before I leave
Paying homage to the New York streets, come on

Blind Man,Drama,2010,"Blind man standing on the corner
Crying out the blues
He said, ""I don't want a dollar and don't you give me a dime
Until you bring back that little girl of mine""

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Kissing you on the commission flat rooftops
Cops sirens harmonising like doo-wop
Dogs barking, bottles bombarding
Somebody screamed ""Fuck the pigs!"", we started laughing
True romance, cigarettes and a goon bag
Sixty three cents and a pocket of food stamps
I'd do anything to have you back for that
First night, talking about family crap
But I was a blind man, listen to my heart skip a beat
When you asked about my dreams and the scar on my sleeve
We cried at the blues like a mark of the bleeds
To the blood on our hands  such a relief
It was love like you and I, to align synthesis
Fewer than city lights, suicide witnesses
Blue lights flickering, moonlight glistening
Illuminating life, purified innocents
(What?)

She's from a place where you have to believe
Where a buckled bike rims hang from the trees
And if you squint when the full moon captures the street
Blind man you can see!
He's from a place where you have to believe
Watching your family collapse to their knees
Broken glass everywhere from the shattered dreams
Blind man you can see!

""You're blind from the facts"" ""Man, can't you see?""
""And it's hard to explain like humanity's vision""
""You're blind baby""

Yeah, yeah, yeah
We heard bass drums echo in the stairways
Heavy screen doors slamming like rear brakes
A symphony of old V8s revvin' sent a
Shiver up my spine, like a DJ's records
For one second we were consciously lucid
And everything else was an optical illusion
Blind to intrusion and constant confusion
Removed like the truth in historical blueprints
First love, last goodbye
See these bags under my eyes? I earned my stripes
First love, last goodbye
See these bags under my eyes?

She's from a place where you have to believe
Where a buckled bike rims hang from the trees
And if you squint when the full moon captures the street
Blind man you can see!
He's from a place where you have to believe
Watching your family collapse to their knees
Broken glass everywhere from the shattered dreams
Blind man you can see!

""You're blind from the facts"" ""Man, can't you see?""
""And it's hard to explain like humanity's vision""
""You're blind baby""

Fourteen, left home and look for the meaning
Fifteen, found gangs and hooked on graffiti
Sixteen, the whole world is crooked and greedy
Seventeen, stop pushing me 'round like Mussolini
Nothing to hide, used to hustle and grind
Eighteen, you're never too young to die!
We do what it takes, losing our patience
Suffer defeat and humiliation
We come from the streets and move on the pavement
And you still don't recognise truth in my statement
This bad blood needs purification
Slash my wrists and spill on their music of phazes, yeah

She's from a place where you have to believe
Where a buckled bike rims hang from the trees
And if you squint when the full moon captures the street
Blind man you can see!
He's from a place where you have to believe
Watching your family collapse to their knees
Broken glass everywhere from the shattered dreams
Blind man you can see!

""You're blind from the facts"" ""Man, can't you see?""
""And it's hard to explain like humanity's vision""
""All y'all fake motherfuckers up in the joint, huh""
""Watch me!""
""Why you wear those glasses? Ooh I can see!""",https://genius.com/Pegz-blind-man-lyrics
Block to Block,Burn City,2007,"I got a problem with bullshit and politicing
If there's a war going on, outside sunny, setty chillin'
Rappers is happy to hop on a dick for a dollar
While I drop it hotter, they gotta cop it, shit's proper
Fuck the brag when it's self-evident
I'm feelin' at home at the sound of impeach the president
Drunk veteran smelling like piddle and rummy
While I'm slapping them bitches with big sunnies
Pedal meet to divas, eagle spread eager
Peace out, the wingspan's lethal
You can ask Acca Dacca, she probably had a
Jack up her sleeve and I don't need that shit neither
So ya plan need be plan B
'Cause ayy, first off, you fucked with the family
But you already know it so it
Ain't no point in keep goin' (take a shit)

It's Pegz and Funkoars on set
Nothin' needs to be said, put em up like Knockout Ned
'Cause we're block to block killin' it, block to block killin' it
Jase on the beat so we're block to block killin' it

"" you keep killin' it""
""Stop  and start killin' shit""

Nah, nah, nah, nah
Yeah
That's like Vents, one verses twenty cops
Corrupt politicians and self-righteous demigods
With The Greatest Hits since brekkie bongs
And Kings Cross hookers with fishnet leggings on
Sketchy Hons, one of rapping's finest
Walking the red carpet with a pack of lions
Female fans flashing their privates like
Janet Jackson and Axle Whitehead
It's the life of a rap star, driving a Jaguar
Hide in the mansion, dinin' on caviar
Smile for the camera, fire the manager
All in one breath like Trials with the stamina
Don't believe the hype, it's not luxury jets
It's not penthouse suites, it's bunking in beds
Fucking with Ses', end up on A Current Affair
With a dozen baby mummas lining up for a cheque

It's Pegz and Funkoars on set
Nothin' needs to be said, put em up like Knockout Ned
'Cause we're block to block killin' it, block to block killin' it
Jase on the beat so we're block to block killin' it

"" you keep killin' it""
""Stop  and start killin' shit""

It's the return of the motherfuckin' Honson man
I get blazed with Pegz, till I lost it, damn
I still use my CD, to try to cop blowjobs
Like I gave Tony Montana my CV, Hons
Still ripping it, while I'm still as empty
As that pocket you've been pissin' in, listen in
Now you already met the family
Mr Trials jackin' breaks at knifepoint life Pammi Lee's mammaries
So understandably, I don't have to wear a shirt
That's pastel to try to mack girls
'Cause, soon as the plane hits the tarmac
Yo, my game on point, I can't miss like a car acc’
You don't wanna start that shit, you ain't ill
You're a hypochondriac with a bad limp, slam this
In your car till your speakers fucking haemorrhage
Jase on the boards with dirty Oars and Pegasus

It's Pegz and Funkoars on set
Nothin' needs to be said, put em up like Knockout Ned
'Cause we're block to block killin' it, block to block killin' it
Jase on the beat so we're block to block killin' it

"" you keep killin' it""
""Stop  and start killin' shit""

Hey, hey, hey
Fuck your flow, find me at the neighbour's home
Waiting for the water to flow, so I can go and steal your soap
See I'm broke, no bullshit, if broke was bullshit
I'd be buried knee deep, dressed red in a bull pit
I'm fucked financially, I don't play it up to be dope
For real, I've gots to save up to be broke
I made a few beats on a couple big sellers
Spent the funds getting drunk on enough to fill a big cellar
Hey big fella, would you mind movin' out the way?
Ask a hill, what the fuck you think a mountain say?
I'm not moving from my bar stool unless a girl that passed school
But looks like she didn't wants to pass through
They say booze kills the brain cells
But um, uh, um, ayy fuck it ayy
What if I make bail? I'm bad news
Like Miss Macro hearing a rap flow thinking she can too

It's Pegz and Funkoars on set
Nothin' needs to be said, put em up like Knockout Ned
'Cause we're block to block killin' it, block to block killin' it
Jase on the beat so we're block to block killin' it

"" you keep killin' it""
""Stop  and start killin' shit""

Bombs Away,Drama,2011,"I heard he rode into town in the private Learjet
With five hot chicken heads, high on crystal meth
People said they wore black ties and ear sets
Snake skin boots with diamond fish nets
Bullshit, I was 'bout to light a cigarette
The prime minister said ""Sign my tits Pegz""
I jumped in a limousine with Assange from Wikileaks
And threw a whiskey bottle at a bunch of dignitaries
People talk a lot of bullshit that's miscellaneous
Syndicated 'cross the world, so instantaneous
I heard he was raised by dingoes in Australia
And might be the missin' baby of Lindy Chamberlain
You know the stadium, the haters keep hatin' him
And people got shit for brains fillin' their cranium
He's no saint like Mary McKillop
But god knows, he's a vicarious spirit

Man, you ain't hardcore! Keep talkin', talkin'
Man, this shit'll never blow! Keep talkin', talkin'
Hip-hop sucks! Keep talkin', talkin'
I got your whole crew singin' the chorus

 (bombs away)
 (the guy everybody loves to hate)
 (bombs away)
 (the guy everybody loves to hate)

I heard he dropped past Winsdor castle
Did lines with a chef in the women's bathroom
Had a parma and chips on a flimsy barstool
Watching Die Antwood sing soprano
People said he nearly caused a big debacle
On the dance floor with an old English couple
He's no saint like Mary McKillop
But gods knows he's a good vicarious spirit

Graffiti ain't art! Keep talkin', talkin'
Rap music's for thugs!Keep talkin', talkin'
DJs are whack! Keep talkin', talkin'
I got your whole crew singin' the chorus

 (bombs away)
 (the guy everybody loves to hate)
 (bombs away)
 (the guy everybody loves to hate)

Did you hear it through the grapevine? Read it on internet?
Watch it on TV? Receive it as a Twitter text?
People said he painted flying pigs on a police station
And pulled a peacemaker on a chief mason
Seekin' danger like a teenage P-plater
Gettin' chased by satellites and three agents
Cuttin' streets like freeways through green acres
In a V8 with three Collingwood team players
Don't believe the hype, he's just a normal guy
People spreading rumours, tellin' porky pies
Today's headline in the New York Times
Read: Pegz sex tape with Warnie's wife
It's all lies, people never thought he'd rise
They wrote him off like turbo four-wheel-drives
He's no saint like Mary McKillop
But God knows he's a vicarious spirit

Burn City,Burn City,2007,"They say life's not worth livin' in Burn City
Work forty hours a week until you turn sixty
Earn fifty grand a year, debt for eternity
No sleep, no rest is a certainty
We choose to adhere, persuin' careers
Like border men on parades, the brute with sincere
Losing our rights, using our fears
Burn City, one day I'll be moving from here
Goin' back to the cave, the embrionic stage
Before the, black clouds and atomic rain
Before the, black wave on Boxing Day
Before the, man-made economic plague
Burn City lost her way, she's not the same
She forgot about the streets we populate
So we compensate in a lot of ways
And intoxicate ourselves to stop the pain

Burn City, what happened to the passion we had?
I know you like the back of my hand
Burn City, I told you I'd be packing my bags
If you ever turned your back on my fam
Burn City, that's the sound of an angry crowd singing
""Burn this bitch to the ground!""
Burn, burn, burn, Burn City

Yeah, I see blue collars sweating, their families stressing
I see, white collars on anti-depressants
I see, unemployed looking anxiously reckless
Everybody's trying to manage gravity's pressures
Has the standard of livin' gradually risen?
We're like battery hens, mechanically driven
And it's hard to explain like humanity's vision
And who's to blame for the planet's condition?
Every day, another chapter is written with passionate lyrics
Another character witness is tragically missing
Another young kid's landed in prison
We all slip through the cracks and abandon the system
Burn City, you don't own the streets
We closed our minds and postponed our dreams
You sold us out and promoted greed
But you won't defeat my people's only beef

Burn City, what happened to the passion we had?
I know you like the back of my hand
Burn City, I told you I'd be packing my bags
If you ever turned your back on my fam
Burn City, that's the sound of an angry crowd singing
""Burn this bitch to the ground!""
Burn, burn, burn, Burn City

We lose confidence glued to computer monitors
Worlds apart within a few kilometres
I still love it but it's never the same
Yesterday she dreads the bay like empty space
Before, dust settled on the temperature gauge
She build apartments on a resident's grave
And, at the end of the day, reckless, insane
Burn City spiked a river like a heroin vein
I know things change when Centrelink pay
The streets are regulated like a benefit claim
And my generation has made petrometal mistakes
But every step we take up

Burn City, what happened to the passion we had?
I know you like the back of my hand
Burn City, I told you I'd be packing my bags
If you ever turned your back on my fam
Burn City, that's the sound of an angry crowd singing
""Burn this bitch to the ground!""
Burn, burn, burn, Burn City

Well I made it this far, built it all from scratch
When all things were looking bad, yo I needed to step back
So I gripped all my senses and I pushed on through
And I got out of that mess and I saw the light",https://genius.com/Pegz-burn-city-lyrics

Right hand like a taipan's neurotoxin
Sumo dropping like the euro dollars

Girls shake that tail like the bureau watchin'
It's a pseudo Robinson Crusoe novel
We're the Muay Thai boxers of human conscious
In a game of death against Bruce and Norris
Pegz back! Gather ya boys, anarchist join weapons
Activate and destroy ya canibinoid receptors
In a brave new world of paranoid perception
I don't wanna believe but you can't avoid the question
Tell me, who kicked our Prime Minister out
And makes billion dollar profits off shit in the ground?
Tell me, who finances political power
Like blood money flowing through Swiss accounts?

Pegz back! From the farthest steps of Nirvana
Studied the seven chakras and zen with the masters
Healing deep scars of a mental stigmata
Doing Mescaline shots with American shaman
Now I'm back with the drama, repping Obama
Taking apart the caste of a secular Dharma
From South London, to the slums of Calcutta
Kids asking ""Who's this cunt from Down Under""
Tell Tim Dog ya heard this song on the radio
Fucking with Pegz—""You got a long way to go""
Worldwide spitting rhymes lyrically crazy
I transcend politics and military regimes
I rise from the rumble like the children of Haiti
With a slight misogynist appeal to the ladies

I'm a cult leader with a spiritual awakening

Giving family first a hysterectomy
It's G.P. Gully Platoon, ya disrespecting me
The cyclones born from a whim of treachery
Who write rhymes like ransom letters?
Fucking with Pegz? You need to take dancing lessons
I'm a man of peace but my hands are weapons
Like Stanmore strength with a stash of records
This is hip-hop gangs of desperate adolescence
Manifesting into a chance of redemption
About to bum rush parliament and tag the benches
Please legalise weed
 'cause it's mad expensive

Who's got the shit locked, reppin' St. Kilda
Step in the milkbar, dressed as a chechen gorilla
Nobody move, I taught my dog, Zeus, “sick balls”
Give me a chocolate Big M and a pie with sauce
Kid, I'm twice as raw, I listen to Funkoars
While getting head, blowing a spliff in my ClubSport
Don't think I'm strictly 'bout laying the cut
When I'm drunk, sing Jimmy Barnes or play the guitar
Take a bath while you preach ‘bout keeping it raw
I'm from Melbourne not the fucking streets of New York
I never been to Jamaica, Queens or the Bronx
But I've seen a lot of shit so believe what you want
I'd rather watch SBS than MTV
I'd rather read Stealth Mag than HHC
Plutonic Lab beats smash up the city
Pegz rips the text like Agatha Christie
Man of mystery in hip-hop's Holocaust
Kicking Nazis off stage in two dollar thongs
Dropping bombs on your RipCurl trucker hats
Rockin’ a show in a Burn hood and tucker bag

Party don't stop till cops kick the door in
Party don't stop till cops kick the door in
Party don't stop till cops kick the door in
And shoot the DJ at six in the morning

I sell out for a chicken wing with dipping sauce
Dance in a tampon ad like Wickid Force
Sick of all you corny fools claiming your shit is raw
Replicating ‘93 and can't bring it forward
You can listen to metal or wear Dunlops
Party at a rave, new breed 
DJ Selekt, something for you hard rocks
Cuttin’ to the sounds of Plutonic Lab drum shots
We come from the bedroom to liberate movement
Like 3D graffiti walls by bi-lumen
Unanticipated, innovative music
Eliminate your school yard, bully blueprint
Keep frontin' 'cause when it all backfires
You get baptised like vampires
Obese crew, catch and wreck with our hands tied
Leavin' competition jackknifed with flat tires

Party don't stop till cops kick the door in
Party don't stop till cops kick the door in
Party don't stop till cops kick the door in
And shoot the DJ at six in the morning

Mad dux, ahead of the class, bred for the task
Step in the club with a muddy Predator's mask (what?)
Sipping veteran's blood out a gentleman's flask
And ice grillin' newjack's for the adrenaline rush
We're from a city heroin loves, the devil's in charge
Rebels cover the streets with incredible art
Beware of the deadly snakes like Wayne Carey
Generic accents to make my brain haemorrhage
""Step to me and get shot unsuspectedly
I take you out like a vasectomy""
""Thank you ladies and gentlemen"" ""Alright Melbourne, thanks for having us""
""Peace, keep it real""
 Yeah, yeah
The sole arbitrator, chase burners like a fire brigade
And lick the cream off the pie in my face
High with my mates, who can burn us?
Shoot and murder James Hardie for abusing workers
You gotta ask, ""Where did we lose the purpose?""
Rupert Murdoch's God and the truth is worthless
The universe is being explored, freedom’s ignored
And Little George is the demon of war

Party don't stop till cops kick the door in
Party don't stop till cops kick the door in
Party don't stop till cops kick the door in
And shoot the DJ at six in the morning

Crime in the City,Drama,2011,"All you see
All you see is crime in the city
All you see
All you see is crime in the city
All you see, all you see
All you see is crime in the city
All you see, all you see
All you see is crime in the city

I was sittin' on the platform, visually nil and void
Reading about the times square show in village voice
The fives rolled by like visions of joy
Psycho analysing citizens like Sigmund Freud
B-Boys congregated in Keds and Clydes
Recognised Lee talkin' to Freddy Five
Lady Pink rocked the tight jeans extra high
Denim jacket with a back piece seventy-nine
Black books gettin' signed in red devils
White styles were being born and conceptualised
DONDI's gettin' high tokin' a small spliff
Fillin' a pilot pen with grocery store ink
Blade's talkin' to Tracy, Doze is drawin'
Cap's looking over his shoulder with caution
A dozen or more kids surround Martha Cooper
Transfixed on a strange whole car by Futura
Super kool looked up at something perplexin' him
Like children of the grave runnin' through Lexington
Turned around saw Phase2, coppers arresting him
Silhouettes jump the third rail

All you see is crime in the city
All you see
All you see is crime in the city
All you see, all you see
All you see is crime in the city
All you see, all you see
All you see is crime in the city

Public enemies since the summer of seventy-one
When Taki spawned a new generation of love
Black Benji's death was a revelation for some
In December at the ho avenue boys club
Where sixty-eight presidents signed a gang treaty
And ten-thousand members combined the family
You might've seen it in the warriors movie
But this is real life, that started a movement
The streets of New York got a chance for peace
Block parties got thrown, kids danced in the streets
At Cedar Park a Grand Master Flash to be watched
Kool Herc merry the apache beat
And on the break down baby skulls moved to James Brown
The man with a thousand moves pulled the ace out
Melle Mel swayed the crowd to say it loud
And violence dissipated in the concrete play ground

All you see is (crime) all you see is (crime)
All you see is (crime in the city)
All you see is (crime) all you see is (crime)
All you see is (crime in the city)

Bambaattaa, the black spade campaigned for unity
Beyond the walls of a bronx river community
Across the apache line of promiscuity
Like the Kool Lady blue opportunity
Savage nomads roamed the ghost yard
Graduatin' from dope tags to throw ups
Painting political statements on whole cars
The transition of renegades of culture

All you see
All you see is crime in the city
All you see
All you see is crime in the city
All you see, all you see
All you see is crime in the city

Cro-magnon,Axis,2005,"We grow spanning the whole gamma with no planning
Flow banging my head like cro-magnons
Dope 
Spittin' bars on fat loops
Syntax and stains like scars and tattoos
And that's truth
We hate cops and love samplin'
Running rampant on stage like gargantuan
So start amping 'em up I'm obese
With highly explosive Polynesian motif
No beef with the creeds live among us
My whole crews' various shades of different colours
Sick on drums
Avant-garde ignoramus
I'm on some backyard shit with my brothers
Down with the artist rollin' incognito
In a business that's built like a big casino
It's all about how you use what you know
Improving yourself without losing soul


I'm no genius with infinite aspiration
I utilise vision and vivid imagination
An everyday 28 year old renegade
Penetrate, with the heavy-weight pen and papes
Gettin' praise, centre stage 'til it emanates
Entertains, sendin' brains on getaways
We meditate to drum loops and set it straight
Dedicate life to art you can't regulate


Imagine every computer in the world crashed
Allah and Christ in the pub singing Pearl Jam
Imagine solar cities and electric cars
Who gives a fuck about steps on Mars
Imagine Pegz in charge, start again and rebuild
Give parliament house to the mentally ill
Imagine seventy mil' was not enough
Imagine every Westfield was a barter club
Imagine Indigenous people governed us
The cops and the councils were someone to trust
Imagine Cathy Freeman was PM
Six hour shifts and a four day weekend
Three month holidays
Five hundred dollar raise
Ninety minute smoko breaks, cook a bolognese
What a way to live if we could only imagine
What? that's the dream that drove me to action",https://genius.com/Pegz-cro-magnon-lyrics
Deities of Def,Drama,2011,"I know you woulda liked a song that made booties shake
Cuties on the floor like cougars on the shootin' range
Groupies on stage doin', yay, like who's to blame
Keep the bazooka aimed at Judge Judy face
It's Obese, movin' weight like Ruby Hunter
I was named after a motherfuckin' doobie brother
I got the funk like hoochie mamas in a beauty parlour
Diggin' for a roach in the vortex of coogie jumpers
Systematically bringin' anarchy back
Kid black-on-black, the King's Academy graduate
Established back when the lyrics had to be classic
Rappers would steal cars and drink the battery acid
Nice girl, fight girls brutally honest
Like beautiful boxers after too many vodkas
We grew dreadlocks and smoked too many
And I got no regrets at the youth that we squandered

Deities of death, death, death, death
Death, death, death, death
Death
And never let your memory die
Death, death, death, death
Death, death, death, death
Real recognise, real recognise
And never let your memory die

Couple of bottles later and the ladies are perfect
Everywhere we go, we're like deities worshipped
Break dancin' to somethin' vaguely disturbin'
Like George Bush and the eighties resurgence
Maybe, one day, you can say that it's worth it
When the cribs paid off and Mercedes is purchased
""Bullshit!” Murder tracks, stay subversive
Put your homies up and celebrating the person
Spill a little bit on the curb, a little bit on my shirt
A little bit on the desk when I'm sitting at work
""What's tomorrow?"" Tighter than Tyson and Custamado
Flyin' above the clouds, survivin' on cups of Milo
Ghetto boys for life, drivin' amongst the five-o
She put my nuts in her mouth and started humming the high notes

Deities of death, death, death, death
Death, death, death, death
Death
And never let your memory die
Death, death, death, death
Death, death, death, death
Real recognise, real recognise
And never let your memory die

Mind of a lunatic, fightin' a champion pugilist
For a bike courier's slice of the planet's nucleus
In my own world like a psychosomatic uterus
Spittin' the raw shit, inspired by rappers doin' this
Mentored from Trench Town to Crenshaw
In New York, studied under Large Professor
And celebrating with friends on the day of the dead
Doin' lines off the Ouija board sayin' a prayer
""I'm fucked up!"" Talkin' to ghosts, payin' respect
Making the girls say ""uh-uh, you ain't taking it there""
Nothin' compares to the few moments we live
You were always there when I was going through shit
Got ya name on my arm, photo on the fridge
Twenty years of memories, a stolen gift
""This ain't a typical song for somebody you've lost
Physically gone but I can still hear you laugh

Deities of death, death, death, death
Death, death, death, death
Death
And never let your memory die
Death, death, death, death
Death, death, death, death

You all know who it is man
Yeah, it's Planet Asia medallios
Yeah, yo

Titanium tanks, potrown shots, Iranian shanks
Platinum plates, ate to the face off grapes
Eat off cake, digging in the crate, spitting in your face
Shitting on your tape, fit this on my waste - let's motivate
See me in a soldier state, hardcore, hard body shit
Flow that's obviously the most worthy to politicing
If this was college I'd be riding on a full scholarship
Niggas acknowledge this, I'm more hotter than hollow tips
Forever on some rival shit, bitches swallow dick
From herb rats to model chicks, crack babies to cosmic kids
I start writing once I feel the buzz
And if you was high as me then you'd know how real this was

It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like

Vents and the Pegz, it better be loud, I rhyme mentally foul
Facts is hard to swallow like Pedigree Powell
You mad but every time I'm in it you get a feeling
I'm a blood and my style compressed to three minutes, huh
Or you can feel it like a kick in the nuts
Or losing your loved one, the lumps up in the guts
So you're, selling the drugs right up in your house
Come home, me took the television set and the couch
My flows have got a definite bounce, to get your head
Banging like satiricon, Vegabons sing along
Mat-o-fact bring it on
We could get it on like Lebanon 'til we're both dead and gone
Put the record on blast and let yourself
Free 'cause tomorrow keeps swelling in the past
There ain't nothing like diligent music

It ain't nothing like diligent music
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like

From the streets of Adelaide to St. Kilda Puram
Loved by mothers, respected by villianous gangs
Feared by bigotted cats and ignorant trash
Like leaders of a right-wing political branch
We resonate through indigenous camps
To the bedrooms of working-class kids from the flats
Without the layered effects or filtering facts
We're all children of the same lost immigrant's fam
Don't let the media deliver the plan
Subliminal brain waves got you swinging a flag
Six o'clock got you feeling with angst
Ten-thirty's like ""sweet dreams honey"", who killed the romance?
Pegz and Planet Asia fill the expanse
Chemically saturate your compillary glan
Bringing it back, lyrically fulfilling the fans
Like hip hop's number one diligent man, it goes

I met a man on the street by Flinders Lane
I copped The Big Issue, said ""keep the change""
He smiled in response and preceded to say
Don't look down, it's a leap of faith (Come on)
Ebb and flow copulating like aerosol
Abominations osculate in the terror dome
Gettin' up wherever we go
All city like blue stone barin' its soul
Heads know Pegz flow, I'm just hittin' my peak
Ten years and not a weak verse written by me
A lot of people talk from their window seat
But the cold facts send an ice chill down your spleen (Bitch)
Rappers hatin' gaffer taped and decapitated
Packed away in a box of my imagination
Don't look down, aberrations evaporatin'
Navigatin' my style free of the planet's gravitation

You wanna live on the edge, these streets don't forgive and forget
It goes don't look down
You wanna live in regret, these streets won't give you respect
It goes don't look–
Don't look down – acts of jealousy
Don't look down – facts and fallacy
Don't look down – rap reality
Poppies get cut by the crab mentality

Dropped the car off, jumped in a cab
Called the crew like ""Hello? Where you at?""
""We're at the suede bar chillin' with Micka and Cam""
Smith Street take a left at Victoria Ave
The cab driver hit the gas, spliff in his hands
He said ""don't look down, this is your chance""
Mirrors broken irrevocable fear and loathing
Last night, woke the neighbours singing Billy Ocean (Damn)
Think I lost my phone, I think my ribs broken
Think I sprained my ankle on a stripper's podium
(Block party) Odyssey honesty's inappropriate
Like smokin' opium on Nickelodeon
Bitches know I'm the Obese Kings associate
Dipped in perversity and linked to soviets
You wanna take the dream I told you how
Gotta believe in yourself and don't look down

You wanna live on the edge, these streets don't forgive and forget
It goes don't look down
You wanna live in regret, these streets won't give you respect
It goes don't look–
Don't look down – acts of jealousy
Don't look down – facts and fallacy
Don't look down – rap reality
Poppies get cut by the crab mentality

So we dance to the beat of catastrophe
Like the prosthetic limbs on an amputee
I stepped up, put in work, backed the team
It's been ten years and not a wack release
Capital P who you gotta thank for the music
Catapult into the stratosphere and shatter illusion
Australia's patron saint of a savage's movement
Swinging from a chandelier like Vladamir Putin
Plannin' my future on a damaged computer
Feelin' trapped in the system like rappers recouping (What?)
Sometimes I gotta remind myself
You wanna live on the edge (Come on), don't look down

You wanna live on the edge, these streets don't forgive and forget
It goes don't look down
You wanna live in regret, these streets won't give you respect
It goes don't look–

Before I lose my-

I'm a pragmatic fool in a utopian room
A followed guru lookin' for a moment of truth
Mathematic, rap addict, smokin' a doob
Holding a mic straight out the Fallopian tube
Ghost in a room, haunted by colonial roots
Black tears in my eyes stain the sole of my boots
Show and improve, step into the vocal booth
And hang the grand dragon's head in my trophy room
Kid, I refuse to pledge my support for a system
That thinks justice is found in the law's definition
I see the ethics of man in a war of attrition
Society based on right-wing corporatism
Before John Mulan thought about submission
Slit his own throat lyin' on the floor of a prison
It's a resistance, power to the people
Tamil freedom birds, balanced on a steeple
Occupy the streets against the elements of evil
Develop in my mind like an alchemist's cerebral
I'm a man of peace, challenge and defeat you
With a cyanide cap in the cavity of each tooth

I've been betrayed and sold out like Michael Collins
I'm not a hippy, but I can see the price of progress
Being written on the trees of our dyin' forests
Have we forgotten our natural environment's problems?
Or the consequence of us buying these products?
I try and be conscious of the brands that I keep
But I'm a walking contradiction, with Max on my feet
I write rhymes on a Mac Book, Adam and Eve

I can't breathe in a city full of capitalist greed
Where my actions contradict the standards I preach

I'm trapped in a world that deceives its citizens
I'm in too deep to plead my innocence
Livin' in the peak, smoke, preach and idioms
Complicit in the crimes that I deem as hideous
Everyday myriads of greed and ignorance
I feel like an infidel that seeks deliverance
Democracy is dead, hopes of prophecy
Lost in translation like Homer's Odyssey

Every show I show, I rock, thinkin' I'm gonna get paid
I stagger out the club with nothing but small change
Every show that I rock thinkin' I'm gonna get laid
I get this by the door bitch and barmaid
So every show now to save myself from being played
It's all about rockin' the crowd, havin' a rage
Every show, my bros cheer, jump 'round spillin' beer
Get rowdy, yellin' shit and gettin' spit in my ear
Every show, my flow's tighter than a wealthy cheapskate
So don't ask, Nostradamus couldn't predict my release date
I'm unreliable unless you fam or crew
Or a desirable honey I'm dying to step to
Every show, I forget to do my soundcheck
One time even forgot the beats for my set
Every show, I crack the speakers, blow the tweeters
Overload the boards and short the power meters
Get the non-believers wide open like receivers
Every show, lyrically known as high achievers
Every show's in cohesion of Asian, European
Indian, Middle Eastern, African, Polynesian

Every rave, hundreds underage drug use
But a hip-hop show that has a few minor blues
We get accused of false shit in bullshit reviews
I refuse to read, listen to the bitchin'
If you can't handle the heat get out the kitchen
And every show, just about anything goes
DJ responsible for beats while I undertake the flows
At every show, sound of feedback, me no need that
 words to make my beat fat
Every show approximately at quarter to four
I get twenty calls from me mates to get their name on the door
And every show, regularly, I repeat the word Melbourne
Because I'm passionate, I want the whole crew to feel welcome
Every show and stage, I make my message clear
While some listen, jump around, others kick back, drink beer
Once upon a time every show there was a fight
But these days most are out for a good night
Every show has its movers and shakers
Graffs, DJs, emcees,  and breakers

Every show, riders bomb the toilets like a grenade
Every show, emcees get blazed backstage

Give me three-hundred Russian Spetnaz
Who'll cut the head off every Kapassus member
Hush agendas, governments corrupt, oppressors
And the act of no choice is the architecture
Has fifty years of genocide scarred our retina
We turn a blind eye like a pastoral letter
Our politicians lobby like Carmen Electra
For the mining interests in a market sector
We signed a gag order like masked avengers
And watched the world plunder West Papuan treasure
What would our diggers say? Try and deliberate
Watchin' angels gunned down like the fifth brigade
They say every share in Rio Tinto
Is the bloody tear of a grieving widow
They say every share in BHP
Is a bucket of toxic sludge in PNG
In hindsight it's kinda like O.J.'s wedding
The fly river species and Ok Tedi

Forsaken,Burn City,2007,"Yeah, yeah

Dear brother, what a strange disposition
I relate to the rhymes on the pages you've written
Especially that line bout one of eight siblings
Hope ya follow ya dream and stay out of prison
A lot kids wards of state, slaves to the system
Letting emotions dictate how they're living
And I know what ya saying bout making a difference
But it's hard to change the fact entertainments a business
And the bullshit can test a cat's creative conviction
When all ya got's these words translating your vision
Don't be discouraged by the haters and critics
The pains another source of inspirational lyrics
Never say that I'm gifted, my dedications religious
I don't need it explained, everyday is a privilege
A lot of good people have never made it to hear this
Dear brother, hope this letter raises your spirits

""Sometimes, it make no sense at all""
It don't make no sense, it don't make none
Some get a break and the rest are forsaken
It don't make no sense, it don't make none
""Don't make sense""

Dear sister, I got ya burnt CD
And felt the urgency when I heard you speak
Especially that song called ""Earn your keep""
Did you really have a sister that worked the street?
Yeah I know what you mean bout words are cheap
But sometimes they cut deep like surgery
And I tried to believe that we learn to breath
But the, truth burns like the third degree
I get a lot of demos, but you're the first MC
To make three minutes feel like eternity
Wearing your heart on your sleeve with uncertainty
And there's no-one else I prefer to succeed
I hope ya, nurture the dream, murder the beat
And change every stereotype we learn to perceive
Dear sister, you're disturbing our sleep
Dear sister, we all got dirt on our feet

""Sometimes, it make no sense at all""
It don't make no sense, it don't make none
Some get a break and the rest are forsaken
It don't make no sense, it don't make none
""Don't make sense""

This is dedicated to the next generation
From the school of hard knocks with the best education
Sorry bout the time it took to reply
Don't ever think I forgot or pushed you aside
You can read my mind with a look in the eye
But I got no good advice a book couldn't provide
Everybody's gotta survive a crooked design
They couldn't divide us with a butcher's knife, ayy
I could have been another kid from the flats
Addicted to smack, no one was gonna give me a hand
Had to stand on my own two, stick to the plan
When shit hit the fan, like the pyramid bank
Had to recognise, realise, remember what it feels like
Unemployed on the dole, tryna keep the skills tight
Tryna keep the dream alive before the will dies
See you at the end of the line

It don't make no sense, it don't make none

North to West, nobody's fuckin' with Pegz
I got respect for the scene and love for the heads
'Cause I pressed my first record using the rent
And opened doors for nearly every crew that I met
So any dudes on the net wanna battle Pegz?
""You might as well run into the wall and bang your head""

""You wanna"" ""Bring fire"" You ain't fuckin' with Pegz
""Bring the pain"" Fuckin' with Pegz

""Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me"" ""Please""
""You wanna diss like you got a trick up your sleeve?""
""Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me"" ""Please""

I'm the Roman in the bloody Kimono holding the crown
Slayin' major labels and closin' 'em down
I don't hate your ungrateful and over empowered
I hate you 'cause you probably fuckin' voted for Howard
The moment is now, kidnap the Prime Minister
Strap him to a lie detector on live cinema
Ask him if he likes dressin' in his wife's clothes
Or try to smoke him like a bong with the blinds closed
I think you'll find they can't question our morals
Rest on your laurels, get left for tomorrow
We live for today, two thousand and five
Black waves in the streets, grey clouds in the sky

Go to Your Head,Drama,2011,"I know I'll never rock the cover of a Rolling Stone
Or rock a show on the main stage of BDO
And I ain't going gold unless we talking chromosomes
Myspace hits and jerkin' off when home alone
And I ain't blowin' up in the states overnight
Unless I'm mile high, strapped with dynamite
I'm not the future, I'm still back in ninety-five
Diggin' through the crates for dead rappers I idolise
I'll never play the Bronx or tour the world
Pack Madison Square with beautiful girls
I'll never be nominated, heavily compensated
Inducted to the hall of fame next to some of the greatest
And that's okay, the streets know I'm underrated
And I don't think about awards or the dollar payment
I'm droppin' science for sub-atomic proclamations
Driven by the urge of progress and domination

Southern man, you better
Keep your head
Southern change gonna
Come at last
Southern man, you better
Keep your head
Southern change gonna
Come at last

Don't let the bullshit go to your head
Don't let the bullshit go to your head
Go to your head

You'll never see me on MTV cribs
Bentley sittin' on twenty-three-inch
Incredibly rich celebrity tip
Bling bling shinin' 'round my neck like P did
I'm the prefix to these kings like D-Trix
Street kids got me on the wall of their dream crib
People in the struggle know their car don't need rims
Diamond rings and a collection of sneakers
I speak to a chosen few–god's creatures
Cult leaders spittin' the cold facts like Roderiguez
I stopped dreaming of being a popular artist
Toppin' the charts and the Hottest 100
I'm just a novice, got a lot to discover
And the love I've been shown is beyond my assumptions
I'm honoured to have you listen to the tracks I wrote
This ride's been unforgettable like Nat King Cole
Coast to coast, meetin' cats with soul
People rockin' Obese on their back window
And that's dope, punctuate the love and hate
I got no regrets like Masta Ace

Southern man, you better
Keep your head
Southern change gonna
Come at last
Southern man, you better
Keep your head
Southern change gonna
Come at last

Don't let the bullshit go to your head
Don't let the bullshit go to your head
Go to your head

I know I'll never make a classic at Abbey Road
Or cameo with Elton John or Axle Rose
Now, we'll never know sections of wax po
On The Tonight Show, dressed in a black robe
Afro poppin' out a heritage Kangol
Paul Shaffer sucking up letterman's arsehole
Legends like Big L better than Pharoahe
Lost in the fray and left in the shadows
Political speakers sippin' the gin and juice
Prodigy, prophets mixing the bitch's brew
Even the world's most lyrically invincible
Become a dusty pile of records in a digger's room

Southern man, you better
Keep your head
Southern change gonna
Come at last
Southern man, you better
Keep your head

Burn City, 2015
Stay tuned, yo
Yeah

Black plague in the hills of white suburbia
Writing burners that give rappers hypothermia
Hypodermic whore bag psychic murderer
Every line's a whole care the size of Guernica
Hide ya burqa, haters wanna slice ya vertebra
Buy you drinks and rack up lines on furniture
Capital P, I worship Satan's image
I’m a crazy motherfucker like David Icke
I love nature, wildlife, hate the city
Tube down the Yarra River with a case of tinnies
Life's short, sleep when I’m dead and I’m gone
When I die, someone play the festival song
Fuck that! We party like federal cops
And wake up on a lady boy's chest in Patong
We don’t stop Burn City got the best graffiti
The best MCs direct the Fred Fellini
Check the meaning, girls like Nefertiti
Pulling endo’s on a Desmosedici
Oh

Ambidextrous the left hand jab is treacherous
Gotta keep a hip flask full of anti-venom
Academics coming off mad pretentious
Get schooled like going through adolescence
Manifestin' Facebook likes and Youtube
Hipsters lookin' like the guys from Blue Juice
Blue Juice lookin' like the Vice News Crew
Smoking blocks of hash in the Isuzu
South East we don’t ride a fixie
Smoke beadies and dress like Lionel Richie
Tired of gimmicks, give it to me nice and gritty
Plutonic Lab on the beat, it’s a crime in the city
Spittin' the sinister, Charles Dicken of literature
You're putting me to sleep like hitting the indica
Lyrically lift ya game like Mr Olympia

I Don't Need Your Judgements,Burn City,2007,"If I had a life coach, a stylist, a spiritual guider
A criminal minded business adviser
A PHD in political science
Would I understand the government's indigenous crisis?
Don't trust what the government say, nothing's changed
Since Sadam Hussein for a kid growing up in Kuwait
Regulated by assumptions we make
Bombin' trains with the blood in his veins
No languages of the past, mathematical sums
Passages of the Bible, chapters of the Koran
No bachelor of the arts
I read the signs, without astrological charts
No psychologist to delve in my head
No relationship counselor to help with the stress
No physiotherapist reality check
I got enough common sense and self-respect

Reagan

I'm still burning, I'm still learning in life
I'm still tryna say somethin'
Baby I don't need your judgement
Still searchin' my mind
Still tryna say somethin'
Baby I don't need your judgement
Still learnin', still burnin' inside
I'm still tryna say somethin'
Baby I don't need your judgement
Baby I don't need it
Baby I don't need it

If I had a personal trainer, a cheuffer, a chaperone
Black belt manager with focus and self-control
Holistic life, no smokin' or alcohol
Would I live to see you wack arse rappers blow?
Would I appeal to American Offspring?
Signed by Def Jam, managed by Don King
Back up dancers and choreographed boxing
Makeup artists and various brand sponsoring
That's bullshit, drop the facade
You wanna rap with an accent? That's not who we are
Poppa large big shot, number one in the charts
From the southeast coast where the poppies are cut (ayy)
No A&R producing my best work
No Primo beat, no Kanye guest verse
No Timbaland remix, radio censored (hey)
We hold it down for Australian brethren

I'm still tryna say somethin'
Baby I don't need your judgement
Baby I don't need it

I didn't play guitar in my adolescence
Have a set of drums or piano lessons
Or a milk crate full of Sabbath records
But I still got thrash metal fans dependent
No green thumb, in hydroponics
No motivational speech by Tony Robbins
No law degree, no brokering knowledge
To rise to the top and own a McDonald's
I don't rest on my laurels or reputation
Every burning step is a revelation
Still dedicated, still gettin' wasted
Don't spend my days mourning expectation

I'm not ready for marriage, sex with a nanny
Having affairs with friends of the family
I know a lot of hardcore heads understand me
That life as an artist is forever demanding
I can't handle the pressure of planning
Checking your arse like retina scanning
Hey yo, calm down, this is what I wanted
Be happy for me, I found a girl who's on it
This is my life, feels right to make the promise
Man, I think I'm gonna vomit
Little gromits, bring pain, shrink wallets
I'm only trying to spit honest and kick knowledge
I'm not concerned with the size of my pockets
So how you gonna provide, with your profits
You still ain't got it, we both got jobs
Two thousand and six and there ain't no boss
Work half as hard and halve the costs
Safe as an Armaguard parking spot
Fourteen years of relationships
And I don't believe shit like an atheist
I want to wake up, party with a Baywatch body
Not wake up grumpy with a brain that's throbbing
I wanna make love, to favourite honey
Hold her in my hands like Australian currency
Study her like a book, that's mine for good
I'ma study her from behind and inside the hood

You'll be old and bitter, wishing you were me
Accompanied by crabs and other STD's
Top it all off you'll catch Ben Lee's disease
Please, no matter how strong
You can't replace the male and female bond
How long can you con a girl out of a skirt?
Before you come across a loss that actually hurts
Too much work to insert for no reward
Besides if I like I could always get divorced
Beautiful law, the net for safety
While you're on your drought, I'm getting laid daily
Cause I know one brother who never got hitched
Now he's living like shit
And I know one brother who never took a risk
Now he's constantly pissed

I wanna take her just to *fuck* in the change room
You wanna, get clucky like Donald Duck
You gonna, get screwed like Donald Trump

I've seen a lot of good couples go bottom up
Yo Muph! Let me ask you a question
Is your father at all mafia connected?
Cause I know brother used to cheat on his missus

Plutonic Lab, turn the sirens up
Sounds like something from ninety-one
Mighty drums banging like Heidi Klum
Got DJ Bonez on the final cut
No diamond love, no blingy bling
No synthy synth, no singy sing
Just, hip-hop on the gritty tip
Like, kinky bitches with a titty ring
Strictly hardcore, no ifs or buts
No video clips with Linkin Park
No pop hits in the singles chart
No club shit, I don't listen to Crunk
New York to London, literally unknown
Victoria's secret, lyrically cut throats
Give you a blood nose with intricate brush strokes
Obese Crew, bringing the love home

""Come one, come all"" ""Toe to toe""
Pound for pound ""Blow for blow""
Round for round, coast to coast
Town to town, Obese Crew, holding it down
""Come one, come all"" ""Toe to toe""
""Blow for blow""

It ain't over, no paying payola
No playing a game, stay on the same kosher
Make a mistake, lay in the grave soldier
Why Burn City blaze like a chain smoker?
No doubt where my sound belongs
No cliche chants, make the crowd respond
No, forgetting bout the town I'm from
On some rock star shit like Elton John
No Vaseline, no fallacy
No matter what rappers keep telling me
No beef, no greed, no jealousy
No sleep for the people on Melbourne streets

Last Straw,Capricorn Cat,2003,"From behind the walls, of a pathological labyrinth
My thoughts astral-travelling, international gatherings
Grappling my angle with a, shackle and grammar
Biting off instincts of a warrior's manner
Stab the high hat, like a bloodthirsty triad
With my tag, put up Bias B and Hyjak
The guarantor, dodging shit like a matador
Spitting MC's off stage like human cannibal
Jabber jaw, butterfingers need practice
Get a grip, or get thrown back like catfish
Jack Darcy, rap raspy
Snap nasty rappers like actors by paparazzi
Give em salty tears, like the footsteps on faulty peers
Jumping off the faulty bridge
With the winning lighter ticket in the hands of their lonely kids
They didn't even know exist

This is the last straw, for the encore, start a bar brawl
Play Russian roulette with ya head in front of the dartboard
Evil ceremony masters in awe, for sure
After a glass or more we bend the rules like guitar chords
*Well look what the cat dragged in* you can't imagine
It's the half-retarded ass and smoke breathing dungeon dragon
No time for lolly gagging, ay Peg' and Bias
Let's get this set of pliers, get inside the studio, set it on fire
I'll never retire, too rough for your play list
Diss myself too much so my enemies can't say shit
Dangerous when faded so the average faces still stare
Getting ripped off paint cubes, drag racing in wheel chairs
Vision still impaired, method for raps whenever molesting tracks
Pimp the beat without feathers in my hat
If I ever met my match, I'd set it on fire
Thrash instrumentals like rentals til we're wrecking the tires

I'll let you know I like to get them promos
Everywhere I walk sport the Ecko logo
People I don't know want me pose for the photo
Drinking red wine and some be thinking I'm homo
Just busting raps on tracks, watching the wack get worse
Dropping their dacks for a crap each time they drop a verse
Don't get me started, these half-hearted retarded bastards
Are like that track on beeswax when me and Balans farted
I got the quality, fine wine rhymes, you love it
Others are cheaper than my video on Centre budget
They getting cut like the Brothers Stoney with a nugget
Make him wanna give up the mic and just say fuck it!
Now put that inside your rhyme book and smoke it
And hope it smells better than it sounded on the day you wrote it
Even if half of this shit was chocolate coated
Couldn't swallow one bar, double dipped and honey roasted

Hyjak, Bias and Pegasus, three predators on the premises
With uncontrollable microphone fetishes
Every time I touch the mic I get this urge to speak
So much shit the mic will be smelling like turds for weeks
Burn weed every day, it's like a re-run
These MC's come to battle and collapse like Bias B's lung
Give me my Makita back 'Jak
You must be dreaming from drinking cheap rum
Bounce off each other like speed bumps
It's the shit starter, Ginger Megs, Ninja Pegz
Bite the heads off Power Rangers and finger Feds
Putting little kids to bed, how bout a drink instead?
Where's my garlic bread man?
Smoking garlic ay?
Where's my 33 cents 'Jak?
Ay what happened to that dollar man?
Where's my money? Where's my money?

Dumber than retard, opposite of a brain surgeon
Mad hatter tea party comin' your way
Turnin' a perfectly normal human being into a deranged hermit
Workin' a haz in the shift of the tradie
That is never relaxin' and riskin' my safety
And it's mentally taxin' and physically drainin'
And they whinge and complain, I'm a simply brainless
I lack sobriety, mad to match the citing
Absentmindedly act like app for Micro-
Sleepin', deep in thought multitaskin' at home
When I answer my paper online, I ask for their phone
Got the glance of my neighbours in my apartment at home
When I dance around naked and try to master my flow

The best go where the silent cite, they got a violent side
Sittin' in the corner kind of quiet with some dynamite
But life is like the way of right, it's riddled with complexities
The only time you're left to rest in peace is when you get released
With expertise along emotionally tortured
And just reclusive with my speech and kind of socially awkward
The Jeckle at high, level at size, get 'em to get in the ride
Transformin' the mental client into a dental giant
They try to turn you to a Valium addict
A panic attack and then grab 'em, gotta carry my baggage
And just revolve with the earth to find the soul that you search

To make me physically ill and scatter my mind

Vodka, lemonade, Mary Jane, old
New York fat cap with the pepper sprayed clothes
With a guillotine on 
In a bar fight 
Capital P, I generate everyday foes
Educated on the streets and commemorate no
 detonate bones

Put the word out, everything I write 
So I'm the boss, who you think signed the roster?
Psychologically get wild like Oscar
With a spirit molecule in my eye, a wosker
Proper hip-hop with the highest sword
Righteous author, front line Prime reporter
Thank God for the vigilance, risin' order
Rhymes that haunt ya dreams like psychic trauma
Grew up in the red light, junkies about
Every day, booze checkin' out front of my house
Every night, porn sound brush runnin' 'em out
Pegz hustle and cops try shuttin' him down
It goes knowledge itself, empirical wisdom
Pushin' your  on your physical limits
In a world that's corrupted by materialism
We got a healthy distrust and fear in the system

Word is bond, my sixteens murder the page
Word is bond, begin speech, turn a praise
That'll circle your craig like birds of prey

Runnin' man in the Melbourne marathon
I'd sneak into Lunar Park, ride the gravitron
Now I lounge in the penthouse tower babylon
And speak to the gods with the power Farrakhan
I'm a vagabond, underground paragon
Curve bonds up on a tangent round planet rock
Type around on the slaughterhouse MacIntosh
Why you suckin' on them watered down rappers?
Back on top, my work excels
The protagonist, mentally disturbed myself
They say I'll burn in hell like Girvan Welsh
My epidemic recommended worded mouth
Turn the beat up, MCs sound the same
I stay true while others sold out for fame
I train my deepest thoughts to elevate

Blind man, open up the doors of perception
Every verse written like an author on mesculine
Walk the valiant death with the Lord as my shepherd

I spill blood on the page and sweat by the leader
With a thirst for knowledge like the debts of a geezer

Making rappers bite in to the appetiser
This is hot shit spitting like a magmagiser
You couldn't stop it with a tranquiliser
Bang your head like a crash-test taxi driver
The French iron chef with an ankle grinder
Marinate your thoughts in plutonium whiskey
With a beat that makes you wanna scream ""show me your titties!""
Stoninking city, home of the gritty
Coming together like the moon and sun solar eclipsing
Burn a whole in your pocket like a Pokie addiction
Smoking cigarettes and socially drinking
I know what you're thinking, show me the headlines
Where's the ten billion in petrolium excise?
Red lights flashing like Columbian neck ties
Green lights flashing like a couple of Jedis

She got a motor like a V8 stoker
Work MCs like a six speed DJs Noah
'Cause she's been around the block and don't play for keeps
Who is she? A two inch tape machine (sucker)
She won't call, won't pick the phone up
Got a draw full of toys and vikrum yoga
Ignoring my voice like a sickening odour
Gotta lift my game and quit the dozier

Gotta win her over set my charges
And try act like the sex is irrelevant
She made me go down and test every element
Every dallied depart magnetically talented
I feel like telling her I'm leaving tonight
But committing suicide ain't speaking my mind
I'ma fight and forgive her, put the chink in her sight
She was a princess back when I was treating her right
Life's a bitch with a score to settle
Twisting my strings like contorted metal
Stepping on my heart like a distortion pedal
She's just a worn medal, war memento
She's been down before the SP12
A lot of hip hop brothers know the prestige sound
Extra gritty with the sexy image
Who is she? The MP60

""So man, who you with?"" ""Who do you think I'm with?""
""Hey man, you've got five seconds to get off!""

We rise up like the steps of the favela
And jump off the ledge with an umbrella
Setting the bar stellar with a blazing guitarist

Straight out the bloody rib cage of a carcas
Public enemy with my face on the target
Take your best shot like Henry Shavonte

""I've been waiting so long""

And we're back!
""I've been waiting so long""
And we're back! And we're back!
And we're back! And we're back!
And we're back!

So romantic, I roamed the planet
With a mobile phone and global tracking
Showed you passion, no attachments
Follow the link and download the graphics
It's a digital world, know the language
Online with the home advantage
Check my profile pics and post a comment
Sounds impersonal and overconfident
But I'm letting you know I want it
You got style, no one can Photoshop it
Some girls need a rocket scientist
Instructions and a survival kit
Send 'em straight to the recycle bin
'Cause I don't really have the time to give
Yeah, I'm looking for sexy psycho bitch
What's you name girl? You're the finalist
C'mon

And we're back! And we're back!
And we're back! And we're back!
And we're back!

How could it come so unexpected?
I been waiting so long for someone special
Rough 'round the edges, cuss every sentence
Tougher than leather, you can trust that I'm genuine
I drink, I smoke, I got a drug dependence
A nasty temper and a thug's perception
I'm a B-Boy, young and restless
I don't care if your mum's pretentious
Break my heart, I'ma come for vengeance
Fuck your friends when I'm drunk and desperate
I hitchhiked along the super highway
With a user alias trying to chose a primate
I don't wanna play stupid mind games
Live web cams and computer typeface
Future's bright like school on Friday
Even my little brother got a root off MySpace
(Damn)

""I've been waiting so long""
And we're back!
""I've been waiting so long""
And we're back! And we're back!
And we're back! And we're back!
And we're back!

I've been waiting so long to meet you
Step off with your inflated ego
I don't care if you hang around famous people
All men were created equal
I know you're hot but when I close my eyes
I see Bec Cartwright as a bogan wife
I hear more bullshit than open mics
I'd rather be at Bias B's poker night, yeah
Give me a call when you crash to earth
When you crack the big time and travel the world
I don't want to be a back seat passenger
Respect's something that you have to learn
I got Russian Alex coming back to the burn
Jumble on the next flight bout to return
And it's time to abandon the search
Put love on hold, put friends and family first

""I've been waiting so long""
And we're back!
""I've been waiting so long""

One Day,Drama,,"Ah yeah. This is going out to my dirty, rotten scoundrels, and my scumbags!

One day I'll be an old aged sitting with my old mates
Pictures on the wall, reminiscing 'bout the old days
They were yelling ""Slow down!"" We were yelling ""No way""
Work hard till the soul aches

The post-modernist rode scholar, I flow hotter
Than Joe Strummer, the Coyote and the Roadrunner
I smoke ganja with soul brothers like J. Cole
Halo shinin' like radioactive yayo
Take note of my theories like Plato
Fuckin' with Pegz, you get bombed like Grey Ghost
Scape goat, of mediocrities K. Hole
Shouts to my home boys Jez and Damo
We're thundamentally like toxic chemistry
Droppin' sedatives in shots of kerosine
Wake up with a loss of memory in a
Prison cell with Chopper starin' at me
I need therapy like Re and Grundy
On New Years Eve after eatin' mushies
We put the motherfucking p in party
Like jungle juice spiked with E in Bali

Metaphysically gettin' Dizzy like Rascal
Heads givin' me negativity partial
Every city left my dignity on a bar stool
Gettin' jiggy while I was busy in the 
Last nights a mystery right to sinsemilla
Kicked out the Espy, slept in St Kilda
Random, looking like ""Chechen Gorilla""
(You're a cunt, Mick) (I said l don't drink tequila)
I'm one pivotal uncivil Australian
Jump kicking a thug's digital alias
Young lyrical dumb cynical craniums
Gettin' sonned by my subliminal radiance
I bring a higher conscious like a microscopic eye of Horus
Painted on the wings of a flying object
Fire up ya psychological fibre optics
And let good times roll like hydroponics

The elixir of life in a sage's tablet
Prescribed in the text of an ancient tantras
Sufi's entranced by the vapour's magic
Holy oil written in the sacred chapters
Cannabis, sativa, the shiva's charas
Shamans buried with a key of hashish
Seems like every religion on the atlas
 smokin' that shit like Kingsley in the wackness'

Yo, you watch and wait while I lurk and listen
I'm playing first division, holding a permanent position
Here the blessed proper, it's not about the extra dollar
I'm next up on the track, it's Joe New, guest of honour
On this beat masterpiece, my unique art degrees
Are icing on the cake, feel your feet start to freeze
When you're next after me, best believe this be honesty
Diggin' to my past and discovered through archaeology
My quality's eloquent, possibly better than
Anything you probably heard, I'm methodically telling
That I'm a breath of fresh air in a city of pollution
You're on the death chair and you're needin' a solution
I'm takin' it to 'em, 'cause they're dyin' to find an antidote
Trying to put a price on every side of Michelangelo
Bright like a candle glow, reppin' with the Gully P

Joe New, with a platinum jump start to Datsun
Break out the goon bag, pump up the bangers
You know the maxim, seeking destroyed rappers
Speaking of complex, a completely devoid patent
And tell Carl Sanders the people enjoy dancing
Play my shit, or I'm keyin' his Royce Phantom
I'm a b-boy assassin, guard your post
B-girls dressed to kill, army clothes
Gully Platoon, M-Phazes, it's adios
We got your whole crew shook like the Somali coast
We march like ghosts on a meth apparition
Dropping heat like Frosty Freeze, dead man at Lincoln
Left hand like a Rembrandt, penning conniptions
Contemporary flow, with a respect for tradition
My premonition's like a mental affliction
Little Ben, rest in peace, everything's different

Just sit and breathe, take a breath with the beats, they commence
Synergy, givin' me inner peace, state of zen
A to Z, twenty-six characters that I lay to rest
Any problem a part of my soul that I arrange in text
Catch rec, but never directed what my heart compose
And stay forever like set in stone
'Cause dough happens to practically own us with greed
But won't catch up or match any growth I achieve
We switch the picture, I'm the richer life you're needin'
I'm a professional, knower of what I need with
A proper chance at the dosh and grandeur, but propaganda
Wanna damn a common man like the planner of Warragamba
Animosity's back in its hole
'Cause my blessed life'll get you high like tetrahydrocannabinol
Holed in diamonds and gold, man, priceless
From the metaphorical gems of what my life is

Propaganda,Burn City,2005,"I'm not too concerned with rappers dissing me
I burned bridges and turkey slapped the industry
I told critics, learn to act with dignity
My whole crew struggled to earn rap validity
I'm from a city of trials and tribulations
A lot of good friends deprived of liberation
Underworld killings, violent intimidation
Only the strong survive the situation
It's hard enough trying to hold your own
Without the weight of the world trying to overload
I go toe to toe with most of you blokes
And comatose your homophobic bogan flows
Don't you know, not to grab the mic
With the same old punch line battle rhymes
Appetite for destruction like the anti-Christ
Looking like choir boys running from paradise

Propaganda, Propaganda
I can't believe I forgot to thank ya
The whole wide world's like what a wanker
And they keep on, keep on, keep on dumbing it down
Propaganda, Propaganda
I ain't heard shit 'bout what you stand for
Everyone knows that you're not a gangster
And you keep on, keep on, keep on dumbing it down

I don't carry a knife, I cook rappers alive
My hooks damage your mind, like Suge Marion Knight
The bangers I write, I look fans in the eye
And ask em why this bullshit happens in life
Take away the cameras and lights, managers hype
All you gots the people who'll stand by your side
Put your hands in the sky like a shantaram
Tomorrow we're coming down like an avalanche, what?
My live shows like a fat-a-gram
On a tight rope, in some hammer pants (biatch)
You couldn't rock a rent-a-crowd on new year's
With free liquor, cheap strippers with huge *tits*
The truth is you need to start saving your shoe money
Paying ya dues instead of chasing the punani
Fucking with Pegz, I'ma take ya to school sonny
Ya out of ya depths in an inflatable pool party

Propaganda, Propaganda
I can't believe I forgot to thank ya
The whole wide world's like what a wanker
And they keep on, keep on, keep on dumbing it down

Everyone knows that your not a gangster
And you keep on, keep on, keep on dumbing it down

I got brother's fecious, blood on my sneakers
You don't wanna see Obese jump through the speakers
Suffa's a genius, you're just another defeatist
Writings on the wall like puzzler pieces
We love graffiti like junkies and street kids
Don't know what I'm saying better fucking read it
I'ma crew member since Menzie's Ave youth centre
Never give into the politics and group pressure
I got more loose screws than Hugh Heffner
With a gold Rolex from a bootlegger
Keep ahead of the pack like dole bludgers
Bone crushing lyricist, hit em like Joe Bugner
Grip the microphone, clip em like toe cutter
Treat them like hoes, don't give em my phone number

The Fight,Burn City,2007,"They underestimated a brothers dedication
And dubbed this art form as another replication
They said we'd never make it above the preperation
We proved them all wrong and touched a generation
People loved it without a marketing budget
Without, toning it down and dumbing the subject
And it took a lot of pain as a struggling artist
Some passing their judgement like ""we come from the gutters""
I used to think it was the tone of our voice
But it's the voice of our own that we've grown to avoid
When the Hoods went platinum, nobody saw that
Street press ignored rappers like a support act
Labels knocked us all back like a door man
We did it alone and stuck to the format
We did it alone (we did it alone)
(To the format) to the format

It's a fight for respect of the music
It's a fight to defend who we are
It's a fight to the end from the start
Obese Crew repping the art
And the name's like a Fight Club membership card
It's a fight for respect of the music
It's a fight to defend who we are
It's a fight to the end from the start
Obese Crew repping the art
And the name's like a Fight Club membership card

This country's about more than sports celebrities
More than politics form our legacy
How do we so easily talk sincerity
When history haunts like born identities
Contemporary characters left out the narrative
It's only natural we pin down the sparages
Killing them off like the City Of God
I don't care what the fucking music industry wants
This is hip hop without gimmicky props
And our sound won't fit into an idiot box
We got belief in eachother, above the payments
If what I'm saying's un-Australian - fuck the nation
The streets outside are reflecting the times
And they're green with envy like emerald eyes
Sometimes I used to wonder if we ever will rise
Buried alive amongst superficial stereotypes

It's a fight for respect of the music
It's a fight to defend who we are
It's a fight to the end from the start
Obese Crew repping the art
And the name's like a Fight Club membership card
It's a fight for respect of the music
It's a fight to defend who we are
It's a fight to the end from the start
Obese Crew repping the art
And the name's like a Fight Club membership card

Only a few sold out, can't remember their names
It's the one-dimensional fundementals of fame
Some forget where they came from, pretend to relate
But I got no hard feelings whatever the case
No matter what the future holds I want you to know
Everything we've done for the love of the music bro
And if we never made it at the bedroom studio
I'd still be proud we were tryna do it so
That's for my man Jase, spoken with mad praise
No regrets for the moments I can't change
We didn't stagnate, we opened the fan base
Watched as this culture altered the landscape
Def Wish AKA brothers had faith
Before Obese Records was a brand name
Before Triple J gave us mad play
Aussie Hip Hop blew up on the rampage

It's a fight for respect of the music
It's a fight to defend who we are
It's a fight to the end from the start
Obese Crew repping the art
And the name's like a Fight Club membership card
It's a fight for respect of the music

The Last Bushman,Axis,2005,"What do I do? wrestle crocs and box roos
Munch on Witchetty grubs like junk food
My whole crew, roll a scoob outta paper bark
And hunt a tasmanian devil in the neighbor's yard
We train hard in the swamps and mangroves
Step on a mudcrab, lose ya damn toes
We stand close to a spear with Quartz blade
Where we live, razorback pigs might fly mate
All day the spinifex cuts and sunburns
Bloodthirsty insects feed on young birds
Dinosaurs deathroll on drunken tourists
Dingoes sweep the camps for unsecured kids
Secluded..from the lost city d'of Melbourne's gutters
Moving like mountain runners or Malcolm Douglas
Out for justice on the mic roaming the land
My books are the footprints shown in the sand

Yeah, the last bushman, all the kids love me
I make Mick Dundee look like a big yuppie
Rex can't touch me
, Alby Mangel's the man
The 
Leylands
 need to get a life and ditch the caravan
I eat vermin for lunch with Steve Irwin
Weed burning my lungs n' feet hurting
The reef surfing tree surgeon
I keep learning, and researching the realms of a dream serpent

Dreamtime
, nomad, wanderer with a stone ax
Rappin through, Kakadu, pickin up coke cans
Crow dance in a smoke trance when the didge hums
Spit to the beat, to koala skin drums
Big guns and sick cars are taboos
So I cruise downriver in a twin hull canoe
Whistle at the ladies, gatherin white clay
Wave to the elders, damn it's a nice day
I might go paint the caves in red ochre
Illustrate mythical ways to get over
Leg motor trekked the Nullarbor with bloody hands
Feast on a diet of fresh yams and honey ants
Running man's stamina, outback, fightclub
You can see the beauty of spirit in my right arm
Diehard lyricist, the land's my identity
Carved by, solar winds from the heavenly

Yeah, the last bushman, all the kids love me
I make Mick Dundee look like a big yuppie
Rex can't touch me, Alby Mangel's the man
The Leylands need to get a life and ditch the caravan

The More I See,Equilibrium,2018,"I could speech up the coast of 
Dark days cast away like Brooke Shiels
Late nights vaporise to the surreal
Like Salvador Dali with a good deal
Lookin' for relief on a classic beat
Eatin' seen repeats atop a cannabis tree
Swingin' from a hammock in an animacy
The persistence of time like the galaxies reach
You can't run from yourself or the habits you keep
By bein' lovesick, standin' on the Barrier Reef
I went from Sons of Anarchy, taggin' the streets
To galleries filled with , Van Gogh and Matisse
I seen the top museums walked the Champs-Élysées
And nothing compares to shamany
Those mountains gave birth to a man of peace
And transformed what a gritty-ass rapper believes
""What do you mean?"" I mean that I don't know shit
My whole world's like a drop in a hobo street

The more I see, the less I know
I've been around the world on a temperate road
I've seen beautiful things with a rep to grow
But the more I see, the less I know
The more I see, the less I know
I've been around the world on a temperate road
I've seen beautiful things with a rep to grow
But the more I see, the less I know

I know the alleys of Raval like the back of my hand
In Manhattan, my mind is like a taxi cab
In Shibuya, I'll show you where the wax is at
On the road with Karack in a panel van
In Cattle Lamb, night stark skies are mergin'
Night harn russes keep the fire burnin'
Got high with God, I punch lines for thirst
And dance with the devil at sun rise in Berlin
The wider world, what a beautiful place
Sagrada Familia, blew me away
Like the girls in Prague, the food in Spain
The streets of Bankok that illuminate
What a shame, we don't recognise the basic needs
A spiritual bein's connected to a greater scheme
I search temples, walk down angel streets
And found strength in the beauty of a bay and tree

The more I see, the less I know
I've been around the world on a temperate road
I've seen beautiful things with a rep to grow
But the more I see, the less I know
The more I see, the less I know
I've been around the world on a temperate road
I've seen beautiful things with a rep to grow

Hey yo, it's Barcelona beach, ""mojito, mojito""
San Sebastian with a glass of ol' vino
Lower east side
Check the free show with Peep Rock and Premo
Keynote speaker, tryna find Nemo
Cruise around Hawaii in a motherfuckin' speedboat
Yeah, I've been around the world, shouts to Bon Biza
Shouts to ST, fresh beat, from digger
Long live the memories of makin' this album
Shouts to my girl and my brothers Caleb and Gallop
Waitin' for hours, barmaids chasin' the salad
Flows sicker than the Bronx river straight out of Melbourne
And they say we develop like diplomatic culture
Pictures on the wall and 
I've been around the world and every city that I go to
I'm Indiana Jones with a fifty bag of doja

And by seventy, definitely, cold and scurvy

I think I've succumbed, got the drinker thinking I'm young
You take a father of four to make a pass at your daughter
Tried to rap, spat my dentures in a glass of water
It's gonna be sad, holding into wanna be fads
But I ain't full of shit (nope)—that's my colostomy bag
Rocking shows at retirement homes
This trendy geezer don't know when to quit, like a smoker with emphysema

(It ain't a seizure) I'm body rocking in my walking frame
Down to be the last standing, ain't no boundaries

Still using MPCs and sampling
Digging in the crates for Aretha Franklin
With a Honda jet pack and keys to my mansion
Keep the passion, dropping the promo
Fans in the front row, popping the 'no-doze'
Suffa's got a comb-over rocking a Volvo
And still getting love like a pocket of mojo
Oh no, rocking at the RSL
Debris on the deck spitting hard as hell
My man Pressure at the bar nearly passing out
With a security guard trying to calm him down

88 that's two fat ladies from '88 till I'm 88
Can't fade the greats, we'll still be hard rhymers
With Debris on the decks trying to scratch with arthritis
We'll be old timers, cold rhymers with Alzheimer's
We'll be bald, blind as fifty year old coal miners
With a suit on, filling prescriptions with a coupon
Telling kids I used to hike with no shoes on
For 3 hours through the rain and snow
Just to make it to the club so we could claim the show
Till they drained the flow from my piece with a catheter
I rap with a spectacular, home-grown vernacular

Home's where the heart is, this episode starts
Backin' uncharted, bloodbath sagas
Drowning in the essence of the wrongs of our forefathers
I hid my face away in shame n' all family
I staggered through the hardest of wars that's ever been
My world's caved in, demons possess me
I live the ways of the fire-flyin' guillotines
Blood covered, mud-crossed cold memories
Lost in the woods with the hunger of a hundred thieves
Dirty faces with traces of a dirty heart
I'm  journey on a mission for the right to part
Accommodate canned heat like the hands of Jinn
Trapped in a ring, singin' ma praise
Been a stray cat almost all of my days
And nothing won't change till the sky spits flames
Call me the power in man
I'm the strength in strong hands with a devilish plan
I got my eyes closed and I'm swinging my axe
Takin' back what's mine when it's time to react

I studied the style, yup it's compiled with money
Hungry as twenty Polynesians round a 
'Cause I ain't got a lab with latest gear to rock ya
But what I have is the heart of a third world doctor
And I can smell an undercover spotted cop car
Quicker than the rotating blade of a helicopter
I got the sixth sense from an existence
Shockin' pussies like dirk digglers dick's length
Mind open and fist clenched
Lyrically crush a brick fence with my grip strength
You don't wanna risk death! ... screamin' ""I live this"", my crew make you feel shattered like Queen 'liz'beth
I mean business, and won't stop til the scene simmers
Sportin' the wickedest tongue since Gene Simmons
I'm a screen  pixel, Vision clear as crystal
Diss you like King T for being artificial!

My laser bomb paralyze high tech numbers
Sattelite hunter, storm  thunder
Spacebelt,  shower from above
 magma, power up a club
Life force twister, sorcery and forgery
Drinking the elixir, mushrooms and ginger
Trapped in the realms of a free-fall burner
I see all things through the eyes of a learner
Deeper I'm sinking into unconscience
High on my medicine, mentally I'm haunted
I'm cautious of praise and I'm praisin' to touch
I'm nauseous and black, come walk with me blood
Let's torch up this pipe, and blow smoke signals
I hold crystals and eat falafal
And I've been in battles like Ghengis Khan
I throw napalms fists and extended arms
My senses are flashin, crashin under stress
What happened to the meanings?, they're meaning much less
Stranded, always underneath these rainclouds, scheming how to break free, verging on breakdown..
Stranded, always underneath these rainclouds
Scheming how to break free, vergin' on breakdown

""Oh, here we come""
""Always stay true to the art""
""Oh, here we come""
""Leave  unsettled by the way that I ""
""Oh, here we come""
""Always stay true to the art""

Water Marks,Drama,2011,"Water marks under UV lights
Feels like the first time lookin' through these eyes

Everything's illuminated in the shadow of sun
Our reflections lookin' down the barrel of a gun
We surrender ourselves before the battle's begun
Seekin' a conduit for truth like channelin' love
They say our heart beats to an African drum
And we come from a Milky Way galaxy's star
But the dark matter fills a chasm inside us
Until it's all explained by the Hadron collider
We aspire for better, forever damned a pariah
Measurin' life on whatever land we acquire
The planet's in dire straights, we gamble with climate change
Illustratin' the flaws on the land that we violate
We stand at the cross roads, bangin' the iron gates
Like relativity, ya travelin' at hyper space
We hibernate in the radiation of cyber space
Actin' like we got time to waste

Water marks under UV lights
Feels like the first time lookin' through these eyes
Through these eyes
I can see clearly now
Now
For the first time
Water marks under UV lights
Feels like the first time lookin' through these eyes
Through these eyes
I can see clearly now
Now
For the first time

Deep thoughts explorin' our hearts
Like spacecraft searchin' for water on Mars
Is the order of the universe all a facade
Like nine-one-one and the war in Iraq?
The cultivation of self ain't easy
Break the golden rule and the cycle's repeatin'
From Easton philosophy to bible teachings
Treat those as you would like to treated
We could read every book, study religion
Understand quantum physics and ontology systems
But we fail to recognise somethin' that's bigger
Like atomic bass lines in a composition
Every note in key, our conscious withers
Our voices the songs of forgotten singers
Prodigious savants, we've lost our glimmer
Our logic's full of contradiction

Water marks under UV lights
Feels like the first time lookin' through these eyes
Through these eyes
I can see clearly now
Now
For the first time
Water marks under UV lights
Feels like the first time lookin' through these eyes
Through these eyes
I can see clearly now
Now
For the first time

Water marks under UV lights
Feels like the first time lookin' through these eyes
And it's a small world with big words to disseminate
Ask 'em all then the earth can regenerate

What Would Happen?,Axis,2005,"What would happen if today was your last?
Would you wake up early, get blazed in the park?
Would you get off your face in a bar?
Would you make love, sniffin' cocaine in a spa?
Would you say sorry for mistakes in your past?
Would you try and forgive her for breakin' your heart?
Would you get what you came to ask before you're gone?
Write a letter or record a song?
Would you scuba dive? Sky dive? hire a Ferrari?
Pent house party? Set fire to your money?
Would you rob the bank, house the homeless?
Donate your organs to lousy smokers?
Would you focus on your close fam?
Cook up a feast of cray fish and spit roast lamb?
Would you go back home, walk the streets, score some Es?
Get off your guts and talk to police?
Would you dance to your favourite track
If it was played full blast on a train that's packed?
Would you hijack a plane and crash it into parliament
For the freedom to protest an argument?
Would you wish you could rewind and start again?
Stop playing the harlequin

Wake up tomorrow morning
See the sun shine bright
Wake up tomorrow morning
See the sun shine bright

Would you surf the crowd at a James Brown concert?
Sing every word and drink till you vomit?
Would you wanna meet the Queen or Dalai Lama?
Would you wanna meet George Bush or Osama?
Would you wanna meet Ja Rule or 
Bambaataa?
It's what you've done not where you're at or from brother
Are you chained to a desk? Are you brave with your heart?
Are you diggin' in the trench in the rain and the mud?
I got somethin' that I came ask:
What would happen if today was your last?
Are you sitting on the bench? Are you making your mark?
Afraid of the future and ashamed of the past?
I got somethin' that I came ask:
What would happen if today was your last?

Wake up tomorrow morning
See the sun shine bright
Wake up tomorrow morning
See the sun shine bright

Would you try a threesome in the back of a Commodore
With a box of Cadbury chocolate body sauce?
Would you want it all? Tour the Greek Islands?
Safari through the Congo to see lions?
Would you know the mystery of the Amazon?
Would you know the history of the land you're on?
Would you know the industry's a paragon
For slimy motherfuckers like Alan Bond?
Would you save earth or finish a day's work?
It's too late, your spirit's a caged bird
Would you make it worth your while? Go tonight
Take a bus, steal a postie's motorbike?
Would you globalise or let everybody know?
We're all victims of economic growth
Would you make a mends, savour every second?
Take revenge on your boss with a heavy weapon?
Would you let 'em know your darkest secret?
Reveal all in your partners grievin'?
Would you escape from a Divvy van?
Fuck like you're being taped on mini cam?
What would happen if today was your last?
That's what I came to ask

Wake up tomorrow morning
See the sun shine bright
Wake up tomorrow morning

What You In It For?,Drama,2011,"What you in it for? The sexual intercourse?
The jets? The fame? Success from the big awards?
We in it for the love, man, we in it for the ride
We in it for the love, man
What you in it for? Respect from the inner-core?
Connect with the world expressin' our hidden thoughts
We in it for the love, man, we in it for the ride
We in it for the love, man

Yeah, yeah
Droppin' heaters on my hip-hop bottom feeders
From Yarrawonga to  Tonga in Polynesia
My brother's keeper, the provocative speaker
Fuck the police, I duck and weave like an underachiever
(Obese Crew!) Follow the leader, spittin' quality
Critics watchin' like Swiss chronology (Come on!)
Bitches plottin' like British colonies
In a world, every second child's livin' in poverty (Yep)
I try thinkin' positive and livin' properly
But raw shit runs through my veins like criminology
When Obese drops diggers coppin' lobotomies
Sisters lockin' their doors and finger poppin' erotically
Who want it hardcore? Takin' a batterin'
Cranial cavity's crushed by the weight of my gravity
Capital P, parody navigatin' with clarity
Collaborate on a track, marinatin' the narrative

What you in it for? The sexual intercourse?
The jets? The fame? Success from the big awards?

Gimme more
Turn that mic up a little bit more ()
This for the fans who feel like they know me
Chloe, 19, said her nights get lonely
Finds comfort in knowin' she ain't the only
Homie, I'm the one, no second, no third
I'm in it for the wax embedded with my words
Spit it for the team (One Day) that gave me my self-esteem
Shit was Hoop Dreams sittin' on the curb, that's word
To the first rhyme written, my first time
You and I forever, baby, who was I kiddin'?
Mum, I think I'm losin' my religion, (Got a) bag full of chrome
I got no dad at home, who's trippin'? (Huh?)
I'm in it for the shit that make sense on the fifth, six listen
Not the fish sticks you cookin' in the kitchen (Nah)
Illy, Pegz, Mantra (Yes),  questions
Really no answers, 'fore the time's out though, I'ma find out, yo

All right now, yo, yo
Cool, collected, and fuel injected
Kid with a next to invisible vampirical reflection
Off the record we take 'em to school
On the record we playin' for the fool with this unholy method
My ghoulish essence is ever-present in many sectors
Even truly intrepid adventurers at full tension
Phaze always call the blessed with effortless eminence
I paved stairways to heaven with my full intentions
Rule essentially is step back
I move from a step back, step over the next act
Rep rap 'cause it's what we best at
Rocket like a jetpack, flyin' overhead, silhouetted in jet black
Bless tracks incessantly, Pegz back
With a brand new album, this is an x-axis
So why wouldn't I credit it with a rhyme?
An insight into hip-hop's most mystifyin' mind

What you in it for? The sexual intercourse?

I'm into this shit
To mean somethin', flatly refuse to leave wonderin'
One of few acts influencin' the youngin's
Pegz back in the booth, go the scene jumpin' hoops
This for dudes reppin' my crew since way back, day one'in'
Those goin' against it, we rub your noses in it
Fuck 'em, I'll succeed by muself, never needed your help
Bear witness, lay claim to my business
Way back in oh-seven nobody cared to listen
When I told you what I set to achieve  before I leave
On the last Pegz LP, fuck you gon' tell me, man?
I didn't call it? Say that with a straight face
Rapped since eighth grade, overnight success was late
Labelled a one-hit wonder, then the second album smashed
Now them rats trace maps of The Chase
I stated what I had planned, you watchin' it come to hand
Fuckin' four years late, but you're startin' to understand
