Still Here,,2019,"JayLekz:
Jay Lekz Im still widdit
Im a die hard straight bruce willis
Small snippet
'Blood got spilled but district drillers have now been drilled’
Cos i hit them all, never ask !
Run that ball, never pass !
Spit these bars but trust Im still on the field
Im only 110, cuz my brothers live for that ride
Lads never fold to that knife
These opps never witness my kind
Never see em in the 21 district, (naah)
Tryna tick off this hitlist, (naah)
I take the heat when I back my hood
Then smile optimus prime
That breed? Constrictor
I read em all like a scripture
Can't follow me coz im quicker
But your girl follows my insta (woo)
Peel these opps like a sticker !
I talk that shit but I dont pretend
Who got hit and I'll do it again
Numerous trips but someone got sent
Woop woop x3 (siren)
What now what now
Something you don’t wanna discuss ?
Woop woop x3 (siren)
Lesson learnt
21 JayLekz runnin a muck !
A1:
This is one for my opps (one for, one for)
This is one for my opps (one for, one for)
We out here sending shots
Come and get smoked if you test my block
It's been a long time since I been back
It's been a long time since I've been mad
Comin thru with that crew we some real lads
Going crazy going mental like we real mad
Real mad like some real cats
Yall better kick back and relax
Coz if you tryna get jumpy then you about to get real jacked
You get real jacked if you out here talking real smack
Them lads not hood
Them lads are rooks
They're all for looks
Those trips they took
Lad they never stepped foot in my hood
There's a opp round Here I'm on that
That 21 I'm from that
Those tough streets yeah I’ve been on that
Walk through any mans block with the hood on my back
Got that (shhhh) in the back
Got it strapped at the back
Case I gotta pop back
No talk dis dat
Lad yeah I stay strapped
Run a opp down guess he’ll never come back
Dems lads they tryna act tricky
One to your back call you Ricky
Hold it down till death for my district
My whole team eats but it's 21 strictly
21 strictly getting kinda risky if they tryna act iffy wif me
Jay leks by my side with that whiskey
Got rongotti with the hammer feeling shifty
Feeling shifty I do it all day 24 7
Send them opps to the heavens
Workn With my brethens
Got maliq with that Mac 11!
Macc11:
Mac Eleven the don I About to Purge like Freddy

Now These kids want to Disrespect them OG Jail Birds
Trying To act like they all Drilling
But They ain't widdit
Ay whats the Point of wearing a bum bagg
If Theres Nothing In it !

These Opps ain't about that life they all just run and snitch and hide
I hold it down and pledge my Allegiance to that innerwest side
Talk about stacks, Flippin packs

Ay Lad dont come around here
Trying to Urch With A fake GUCCI hat Dont get me wrong brah
I ain't hating, Im just stating facts
So cut tha act, Im just being real

Still down to ride
In my x5 with a pumpy on tha side
If we collide, ain’t gonna lie
I'll let them bullets fly!
It's 21 District innerwest sydney
Screaming no effect
I'm sending shout outs to my brethrens in that pickard fence ! (Free Jimmy)
RonGotti:
Never did fold when I seen that knife!
Fist to fist you ain't about that life
Innerwest is where we playing chess
I'm built like a lion
Coz I walked that line!
Bitches want a taste of this
I got my fists balled up like I'm plague to this
Never ever gonna fold to a fakey bitch
Coz I was made for this
They ain't made for this
Innerwest swing to my T's
Innerwest swing to my T's
I got the recipe
You don't want mess with me
Stick to that chicken boy
You don't want beef !
21 district innerwest Sydney
Cuz they know what's good in my hood!
Wanna get iffy shifty

People keep telling me stop
Drillers keep talking bout heat?
But really diggaz gonna get dropped
Gonna get popped

Hiding in the dark boys run that figure ?
Talk off your chops
Coz your balls got dropped
Wanna snitch to the cops

Malik:
Malik is back here to stay
Straight to that place incase you kids wanna play
All you cxnts there get too carried away
Caught up and Blacked out...

Cold blooded like a Pisces (Granville)
Come fxck with some Ball runners!
Done it again like Ah McCain
I Live for this shit
You can't rush me (Innerwest!)
Do it again I love it fxck it

Still here like I said and I'll say it again !
Innerwest and that 4x10
'Don't get caught in a lion's den' (bark!)
No lads there ! Stay in your lane
Lads here? Built for the game

(Feed him !)
Make it rain when his Bleeding
Robbed that Hood like Robbin Hood
Cuz take it quicker then Beam it !",https://genius.com/21district-still-here-lyrics
The Reply,,2019,"Macc Eleven:
Tell me how many times you dogs got got
We took numerous trips to that 70 block
I heard kill confirmed call up the OGs tell em send them Glocks
Run and snitch to the ops cause inner west Sydney bout to let off shots fxn redhot
21 district inner west Sydney screaming no effect
Now that we back running a muck screaming no effect
Never gave a fuck coz your music and that was kinda alright
But 21 what, one got knocked?
Nah lad ain't gonna let that slide
Time to ride in my X5 with the pumpy on the side
Disrespect fallen soldiers that's straight suicide
We've been on top of the streets check the fucken score
Last time I checked those little flops were laying on the floor
Shanks and shivs that's what we did youse don't remember when
Your brothers got dipped and butcher got sent for 10, you wouldn't know
This was back in 09 just like what JM said
Youse were on the curb this high ya little dog! Who want smoke you want smoke you want fucken smoke... The only smoke youse really smoke is when youse take that toke
I hold it down for the inner west youngins
What, we've been through this shit
Since who's got you running what
Talk about opps rocks Glocks
Trying to be UK Bronx
Bunch of flops do your own thing you wannabe British gronks
Running packed with snitches
50 deep like bitches
Your boys inside are on protection yeah that boneyard section
Free who? Free who?
Fuck up noone gives a fuck who!
Jay Lekz:
One by one, one on four
Take all cause I run that ball!
Bring it to war now let's reveal
When I knock on doors let's see who's real
Pull your steel, lad
This is a different field, bang!
Tinted window shield I grip that piece and stay concealed
Sydney's realists, who them?
They never learn their lesson
Your inmates claim gangbang
But they gangbang in protection!
Oh! Still haven't told them trench?
When you took them trips down to my district, dropped that bitch right through the fence!
Ooo Too typsy
That whiskey, I'm shifty
Debt collector like 50
I've been earchin opps in my district
Been dropping flops since 15
Been blowing smoke like a chimney
I clean the evidence quickly
News report, someone's gone missing!
Maliq:
Whose next?! 21 Innerwest!
Don’t act up
Been running mucks on the greaterwest line
And the whole lot full of actors
Getting caught in the act lads
How many times we did done
Dropped your asses
Put it to the test
Exposed your manners bitch
That rap shit?
Them boys better back it
Calming shit that they never did
Them boys are plastic
21 nations bixtch don’t fake it
These boys invented shanks and shivs
Don’t hesitate to spray it
Trynna be famous
They think they have it
How many times we catch em
We dip dem doggs for nothing love it
My hood don’t stand it!
Ron Gotti:
If you talk the talk then walk the walk
Don’t fold yourself
You took numerous trips round there aye lad don’t kid yourself
100% you’ll dip yourself
110 you’ll fake it just to make it
Back to your hide
These plebs Talk about all these tacks
But ""you ain't about that life""!
My youngins we on the come up
I’ve been bangin that steel topping up so
So I ain’t afraid of that hammer
I’m scaffing away with my tokos hoping that one day we out the gutter
These critics move and get banished
Lads tried to make a threat with that pistol grip, they all got vanquished
Free my team making drops in and out of lock up
Ain’t nothing gonna stop us
My aims on focus
These girls play hocus pocus
They claim they ops but they’re just rustic
This is not really your purspose
I’m living my life to the fullest
Taking the bullets, going the furthest
A1:
61 with the hard shit
Going all in like a bloke in a mosh pit
Tell me who wants this
Tell me who’s asking We talking bizzo since I was a young kid
Here since the start of the game
G40 worldwide remember the name
He came to the game
He thought he was safe
He saw our face
Then his energy changed
Know for a fact they pussys
They only drillers for the music
Ball runners no need to prove this
Old school one on one let’s do this
Pulling up in a van
Ballied up heading straight for the man
Strapped up got a push it by the gram
Stacked up like I got them bands
I be doing OT
Put in work for ma Gz
They ain’t never met a g like me
They ain’t packing the heat
I’ll be running the streets
Tell me lad What yous know about beef
What you know about moving that pack
What you know about clocking it back
What you know about making that trip
Dropped that pin on the map so they know where I’m at
Steady cruising when I back my gz
4 times 10 y’all know forty
Steady repping hard till the day I leave
Put in that work till my lads set free
To my lads locked up
Big boy just rocked up
Send the min and account so my lads stocked up
You ain’t about them bars
You ain’t about that life
We got your message
But this is the reply!",https://genius.com/21district-the-reply-lyrics
