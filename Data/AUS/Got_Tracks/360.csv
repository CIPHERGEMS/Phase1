2 Dogs,Please Be Seated 3,2016,"This is 60 in his element
Spitting bars that don't mean shit, they irrelevant
Fuck around and dis the whole scene for the hell of it
Maybe if I stop fucking around, I'ma celibate (get it, cunt!)
The only rapper with a perfect score
Yo, I've burnt so many bridges that I might as well burn some more
I'm the fake friend you see and then shake hands, make plans with you and cancel before the day ends (ah, forgot I had plans, mate)
It's really hard to make sense
I try to cash a raincheck and still haven't been paid yet
I've been rapping in Pig Latin like adlays
So when I say your ash tray, I really mean you're trash, mate
I'ma make a verse, make it work
Your life's a joke like your date of birth is April first
Your girl keep coming back: Boomerang
She 'bout that life, all she wanna do is bang
The only reason I shot for the stars I couldn't reach
The only reason I landed on earth I couldn't see
So having bad vision's a good look for me
'Cause if I wasn't half blind, here is where I wouldn't be

Okay, I'm back in my zone, your time's up, bitch
I'll give you a right hook with the hand that I write hooks with
Stay clear of me If I am stressed
If I decide to let your blood spill, I'll wipe the floor with you like a polite guest
How come those I see trying to indirect and slightly bliss
Are the same people I see bum licking and riding dick?
We don't play top five, D.O.A
Make the streets go crazy like free cocaine
I'm from the U.K
I don't say ""lit"" and I don't ""turn up"", too stoned to party
If the spliff's lit, then I don't turn up
They should call you the scat man 'cause everything you spit is nonsense
They should call me the scat man 'cause I'm shitting on 'em
Come to the clashes on joke shit and still when they get roasted when I spin 'em like rotisserie chicken
I just bagged an ounce and I'm about to let the Kraken out, I swear
And I'm getting fucked up like I'm at my Grandma's house
The one and only, I'm the blueprint
I'm sick of these average rappers stepping on my toes scuffing my new kicks
I'm talking 'bout no one specific, but if the shoe fits
You still couldn't walk a mile in it, pussy, I do this",https://genius.com/360-2-dogs-lyrics
30 Minutes Tops,Loosies,2013,"Yeah, motherfucking 360 bitch
We made this song in like half an hour tops (Wooh)
Jesus was swag
You know god? He is my dad
Uh
Uh, yeah, yo

Go to an orphanage, kicking the door in
Kidnap her like  strangle her with my foreskin
Yeah, and I'm swimming with dolphins
It's the only way left to release endorphins
I'm on a motherfucking galaxy quest
I'm trying to figure out which planet's the best
Hey yo, I bet that Saturn is next. It makes sense too
That's why I got the motherfucking tat on my neck
Went to the bank to make a balance request
They couldn't understand, all the cash that I've spent
And, if I don't change soon, I won't have any left
Now, even my god damn reality check bounced
Not another fucking rapper again
Kicking me another verse about his pad and his pen
Asking me when me and Kerser fucking battling next
I'm sorry buddy but that ain't going to happen again
No, I ain't scared that I'll damage or wreck
But no cunt will ever go and piggyback me again
Brother, don't take it as a lack of respect
I'm glad I helped you  a tad of success
But I just have to adress something that has to be said (What?)
A snapped neck doesn't need snapping again
Do I think I won the battle? Actually, yes
See the fast fucking flow, it's just a tad for a sec
'Cause if you slow it down and listen to the raps that he said
'Cause, really, how many of his bars do you actually get?
Like Sue from Neighbours ain't it, so you taking a piss
Which human on this earth'd eat a razor and shit?
Which human'd ever eat a razor and live?
And which dude is dumb enough to place in his dick?

Sue from Neighbours' anus
Prawn razors naked
What the fuck cunt?
You taking a piss
(We do it for the love)
Yeah

'Cause if I had to fuck razors or be playing your shit
I think your name would come up in my playlist a bit
Yeah, I lied, but he said I have a Canadian chin
Yeah, I lied, but what the fuck is a Canadian chin?
So, I don't watch our battle anymore, yo I exited
That's two bits broken cunt, imagine the rest of it

Yeah, thirty minute tops
Mate, tops
I'm way too busy brah

Yeah, uh

360: Rapper Tag #1,Rapper Tag Australia,2010,"It's 360, we're gonna play a bit of rapper tag
So usually in a rap cypher, there's a circle of rappers
There's the guy rapping, and the next guy next to him is the person to go next
So seeing as we're not in a circle right here and it's just like a YouTube cypher, you have to call out the person you want to go next
So I'ma start this off

It's 360, we about to play rapper tag
So I need to know where about's the rapper's at?
You hear the beat in the drums, it's a massive track
So if I mention your name then you have to rap
Three months ago I crashed in a Go Kart
It's cause I'm so fucking good that I don't park
So don't ask how real is that
But I ain't talkin' Go Karts when I kill this track, like
I had a problem with my balls, yo, you don't know what
Some had thought it would be Photoshopped
Yo, I woke up this morning like I'm RoboCop
Stormed outside to go and make my Coco Pops
Yeah, chocolate cereal, gangster shit
Mum poured me the cereal, I said 'thank you, bitch'
Nah I didn't, don't think I'm a G
Yo, I said 'thank you mum' and gave a kiss on the cheek, yeah

Boom son! Rapper tag! I'm calling out - I'm calling out old mate Urthboy. You're next - you're next bro. Don't leave it hanging too long. And then you tag the next person you want to go after you and so on and so forth. Alright, peace out",https://genius.com/360-360-rapper-tag-1-lyrics
Addicted,The Forthwrite Mixtape,2008,"Yeah, uh
Yeah
This is a song about my favourite drug
I think it's safe to say that I'm probably addicted, huh
Yeah, uh
Yeah, one drug, yeah

I see women as drugs, I'm wishin' all of them were givin' it up
'Cause when I’m down, that's what's picking me up
I'm addicted, it sucks, I'm chattin' to 'em like I'm givin' a fuck
All I'm thinkin' is I'm hopin' they might give me a fuck
Enough, 'cause on the real, I've been killin' their trust
And people shrug it off like I'm livin' it up
Deep down, the whole time I've been wishin' for love
Wishin' I could meet a girl who would fit like a glove
Then we force a connection with this innocent lust
As soon as the sex is over then I'm finished, it's done
But am I a bad person? Am I a tad worse than
Anybody who's ever committed mass murders?
'Cause I'm killin' their entire trust in men
I feel like I’m evil 'cause they'll never feel that lust again
Because of me, and now I only trust my friends
But honestly, yo, I'm wishin' I could love again
Any problems of their own and they blame mine
It's like a script, always kickin' all the same lies
Any heroin junkie, we have the same mind
Because we love it and we hate it at the same time",https://genius.com/360-addicted-lyrics
Admission,Vintage Modern,2017,"The most successful people I know have taken more than ten l's
They just kept fightin' while the rest fell
I know success well, but first I had to
Come to understand failure and use it as the best help
See, I learnt more from one time failing
Than all of my success combined, so don't stress now
When everything gettin' sent south
For the height you wanna end up, in time you will be sent down
You prefer how success felt, yes
Instead of cryin' a river it gets you ready to set sail
That's a story lots of men tell
I can't imagine what it's like for women knowin' that flesh helps
I ain't talkin' stem cells
Sex sells, if your chest is XL then you'll excel
If you demand respect
It doesn't matter if you dress well, what matters, where your head's held
Understand knowledge is the best wealth
Put trust in everything your common sense tells
And always give your best self
And no matter how it ends up you knowin' that you meant well
Get it together whenever you mess up
You'll be better than ever, you never been better
But see, the more belief you got the more better you get
Whenever you get in a beef go and dead it, whatever
See, the paper comes and goes, but a friend is forever
Understand time is money, go and spend it together (spend it together)
Chasing the stars, endeavour together
And get your team out the Matrix: Nebuchadnezzar
Keep walkin' a line, we walk on an edge
With no fear in our heart, we got a death wish
We on that next shit, they stay thinkin'
In that Blockbuster video mind, we on that Netflix
You're not defined by the dollars you're in debt with
Investments, all the celebrities on your guest list
The profession that you were blessed with
Friendships, or the many that you have sex with
Uh
Take away the money, fame and drugs
And check out how many exit and cherish the ones you're left with
That's why they call it friendship
'Cause one falling out could rock the boat enough and make the rest sink
What defines you is the hurdles that you're met with
The wounds you accumulate and how you go and mend it
You see a child's birth and how they cry and hurt
From this dyin' Earth and how we left it
I feel sorry for the next generation of kids
And the state of society that they're left with
'Cause we're literally slaves of the digital age
Instead of sayin' what we think we just text it
What kind of message is that sending?
Instead of stepping to our problems we're pretending
Instead of ownin' our mistakes we get defensive
We can't even talk these days without offending

I'm looking in the mirror
Looking in the rearview
Watch should I admit to?

Admit that I am evil
Admit that I'm deceitful
Admit that I am me
Admit that I am me",https://genius.com/360-admission-lyrics

Amy! Amy, you listening? Fuckin' hell!
You need to settle the fuck down
You're starting to lose your shit!
It's okay to party and have a bit of fun and shit
But you're fuckin' just, you're going overboard
You're embarrassing me
You're embarrassing your fucking family and friends
Just chill the fuck out for a bit (God)

Okay, goddamn, Amy, Amy, Amy
I've been kind of embarrassed, yo, but who the fuck can blame me?
One day you love me, the next day you hate me
I'm sick of making all these damn excuses for you lately
I've been meaning to talk but I've had to pick the best times
It's not just the drugs though, you're rackin' up the headlines
You have a bump and start rackin' up the next line
And if we have to leave the house, you'll rack 'em up the next time
(Oh, we'll do that next time, yeah?) You're stupid if you think your folks won't know
Come on, let's leave the house, Am', the coke won't go
(Come on, really?) But, really yo, I'm sorry for that low, low blow
I took your arse to rehab, you're like ""No! No! No!""
Yeah, you need to make a suitable choice
Get off the crackie and try and save that beautiful voice
Just stop and think for a minute, yo, you're Amy Winehouse, baby
Just don't overdo it, I'd hate it for you to die now

Where's my moral parallel?

Fuck yeah, Amy, Amy, Amy
The trashiness aside, in the bed, you go crazy
Honestly, I can't get enough of it lately
I'm all for a girl who loves to fuck me like they hate me
Yeah Amy, I fuckin' love you, baby
We've had a non-stop party since the remix with Jay-Z
Yeah, I mighta said it, having drugs is trouble, son
But, while you're up babe, can you rack me up another one?
I ain't done shit, yo, I'm lappin' up the summer fun
Being a fuckin' trashbag, it has me stuck like bubblegum
Yeah, now she's got me equally as trashbag
Walking London streets with half a bottle of Jack Dan's
Having people sayin' maybe I should lie down
Fuck out of my face, I'm all over the high now (You don't fuckin' know me)
I just hope we don't overdo it and die now
But I could give a fuck, as long as I'm in the wine house

Amy, Amy, Amy (Yeah, yeah)

Back to Back,Loosies,2012,"My life, my life is like the craziest fantasy
So I got the urge to be escapin' reality
I write my best shit when I'm sayin' what's bad for me
So in my subconscious I'm praying for tragedy
On that real rap shit, yeah, I'm back on it
Some are thinking that I went and turned my back on it
I just hear a dope beat and then I rap on it
But what's being real to me is if I rap honest
Watched The Secret, got up on my goal shit
Last night stayin' up ticking off the whole list
If you honestly what you're wantin' to achieve
You will probably receive it gift wrapped
Uh, I started followin' my dreams
And I got a little cream when I saw I had a gift: rap
Grateful, can't believe I did that
And now I'm gatherin' everythin' I can give back

Sleeping with my back to yours
Back to back, back to back, we're strung out
Sleeping with my back to yours
Don't walk away, don't walk away

Now I gotta keep it goin': no endin'
And keep the ball rollin': momentum
They wanna bring us down but we won't let them
Fail is a little word that we don't mention
I feel like it's still not true
Put me next to BnE and them Hilltop dudes
But everythin' is me and I guess I'm bein' me
Now I found a winnin' syrup and I will not lose, no
Takin' aim while I scope the crown
It's only gettin' closer and I'm focused now
Got told by the suits I should tone it down
They can go and get fucked, they don't own me now
I hope this doesn't sound negative as hell
But we did on our own without anybody's help
Fuck censoring myself, 'cause me being me
Is a essence of my sales and a credit to myself

Sleeping with my back to yours
Back to back, back to back, we're strung out
Sleeping with my back to yours
Don't walk away, don't walk away

{Chuckles} About six years ago I was an apprentice chippy, and, uh,  PEZ told me to quit and focus on rap, and my boss told me that I wouldn't be shit. Look at me now, dickhead

Uh, I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired
Uh, I'd rather be fit and wired
Yeah, I'd rather be givin' time
To makin' an impact and leavin' these kids inspired
Now I'm someone they can look up to
If you're down, brother, know that you can look up too
If they gettin' in your way you can push on through
And if they tell you that you can't tell 'em, ""Good, fuck you""
Never thought as an innocent teen
That this'd be me, the shit that I breathe, but I love it now
Understand there's a difference between us
Livin' the dream and livin' in dreams, I am above the clouds

Beautiful Place,What You See Is What You Get,2008,"Yo, yeah
Equality's what's needed, when that honesty stays
I have a feeling we'll be livin' in this wondrous place
In my view we need to make the poverty change
Not just hide it like we did during the Commonwealth Games
Yeah, they got the money, they should give 'em a bed
But you know they'd rather dinners instead
With their infinite endless supply of easy living with cheques
And decorated for our visitors friends to leave 'em impressed
Why the fuck are they deleting the trees?
It ain't a known fact that everybody needs them to breathe?
I gotta say now, why wasn't David Hicks back?
Needed to be at home so he could face this riffraff
Uh, save the chitchat excuses you've made
There's never an excuse for the youth you could save
(Never, never) I know the remedy for soothing your pain
You just use a mute view of this beautiful place, it's like that

Sometimes I do think this way
Maybe one day you'll all feel the same
(This way) I'm hoping I can pave the way
Where you're lookin' at an infinite day, come on and tell 'em more
Sometimes I do think this way
Maybe one day you'll all feel the same
(This way) I'm hoping I can pave the way
Where you're lookin' and you're livin' in a beautiful place

Now hear me out, I shouldn't need to repeat
We can all afford words with the freedom of speech
And me, I chase goals, I believe in a dream
And most of all I believe in belief
So I speak to the teens and let 'em know there's hope if you want it
Fight for what you wanted and be openly honestly
And gain profits, I'll be screaming out love to the people
'Cause I'm living in a place where the guns are illegal
(Shot down) I feel cops need to stop the real crimes
Instead of enforcing petty little laws just to kill time (True)
I feel fine 'cause I'm living in the most liveable place
I find it's like an infinite taste
Of what's to come, uh, any day you're under the sun
And any second, yo, the thunder will come
Then I run in to find you all the remedy for soothing your pain
You just use a mute view of this beautiful place, it's like that

Sometimes I do think this way
Maybe one day you'll all feel the same
(This way) I'm hoping I can pave the way
Where you're lookin' at an infinite day, come on and tell 'em more
Sometimes I do think this way
Maybe one day you'll all feel the same
(This way) I'm hoping I can pave the way
Where you're lookin' and you're feelin' like you're livin' in a beautiful place

Melbourne, it's a beautiful place
Victoria, it's a beautiful place
S.A., it's a beautiful place
Australia is a beautiful place
New South Wales, it's a beautiful place

Funk, soul and hip-hop
Ain't nothing else you need, yeah
Yeah, let's have a bit of fun
Yo, check this out, yeah

Ayo, there's no set method, just kick back and sit and vibe
Crank the drums and jam out and improvise
Intertwine while you're kickin' it and listen live
Empty, it's better, it's evident when it's simplified
Respect those that've passed away
Like Marvin Gaye or even Jam Master Jay
We get tricky with a sexual healing
Same atmosphere as a festival feeling
I'll get respect while I'm skillin' for the wealth
With my headphones 'round my neck, chillin' by myself
This ain't business, see I started vibe and jam
And stay different, me? I'd rather ride a tram
The young silhouette, singing away
Now with the image set, killin' a bass so I can give you a taste
And have you tappin' feet, movin' with some goosebumps
And make your spine tingle, groovin' to the smooth drums

And keep the soul bangin' and keep the soul bangin' away

Ayo, I lead stop, live in the spotlight
And go to any measurement you know I want high
The melody raps, I'm tellin' these cats
Irrelevant facts and takin' all their elements back
Ha, the young dude that'll laugh a lot
It's sort of funny that it's hard to stop, man, I'm hard to top
I stay livin' in a life that's so care-free
But don't dare me ever to vote fairly
Never be broke, barely make enough to survive
And that don't bother me at all, I'm still lovin' this life
I still love what I write, havin' fun on the mic
I still make enough money for a son and a wife
You know I'm somethin' to find because I'm one of a kind
I kill that rhythm and tilt back the mission
For another day (yeah) I'm encouraging a noisy time
Take the breaks off people, and enjoy the ride

Better Than Before,What You Hear Is What You Buy,2008,"Now I’m stealin’ beats from my favourite Canadian cat
So I could hit him with Australian raps, now I’m taking it back
To make payments with no paper or cash
Every word I spit is truth without stating the facts
My statement is that no one not once taking me back
If there’s hate in what you’re sayin’ then my name isn’t Matt
‘Cause I’m waitin’ very patient till my name’s in 
And there’s no excuse for hate, so go on take it on back
And yo, I’m thankful (For what?) Yo, I’m thankful for that
Thankful for every question that you bank on a 
Hopin’ that he might stumble, fallin’ flat on his back
And so polite, most the times no one’s thankin’ him back
It’s that socialite, a certain few are hopin’ he dies
But hoping is inaction so they know he’ll survive
He’s grown to his height, regardless, you still know that he’ll rise
And realise you’ll always see him if you open your eyes

I feel this is what I see
Walkin’ on an empty road
Crooked footsteps underway
Never knowin' where to go
No realness, all a dream
Starin’ at my life below
Hope my life’ll form a trail
To get where I wanna go, I don’t understand

You have doubts believin’ you’ll be somethin’
But doubts are your enemy, lead you to see nothin’
You can’t help it, you’re eager to see somethin’
You’re seein’ your dream stuck and you’re needin’ the freedom to be
One with yourself and you’re runin’ through hell
Lived a life of others, never fell in love with himself
And that’s what’s needed to ever be completed and knowin’ what’s true
Always defeated ‘cause you never will focus on you
And yo, it’s good to be compassionate
But give yourself an itch or somethin’ or your spirit takes some damagin’
There’s no accidents, just fate and destiny too
So why have a million friends and one enemy – you
And I can tell you callin’ for help
You gotta try and work it out and maybe call on yourself
And put down the shield and maybe talk to yourself
That’s your main biggest problem, you’re at war with yourself

In your life, there’s one to find
You gotta know it takes some time
But when you work it out you feel
Better than before
And in your life, there’s one to find
You gotta know it takes some time
But when you work it out you feel
Better than before

I feel this is what I see
Walkin’ on an empty road

Yeah

Ayo, I mean it, I mean it, I ain't tryna play around
I need it, I need it, you can prob'ly see it
You'll prob'ly think I'm gonna rip your heart to pieces
Get you in the sheets, and hit it up and leave ya
Believe it, believe me, you are gonna say
My reputation precedes me (Uh-huh), but you gotta be fair
Though you might'a heard about the numbers that I sleep with
That's not all I am, but at least there ain't no secrets

My mama always told me, papa always warned me
Don't hang around boys like you
Teacher always told me never to be naughty
Don't mess around with boys like you
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position with you

Ayo, you've heard about me, right? You're knowin' that my rep's renowned
Your friends will tell you stay away, because I've slept around
That's how it works though, the word'll get around
Back in the day it didn't phase me, yo, but lately it has kept me down
And yo, I brought it on myself, but I ain't mad about it
I kept count, but why the fuck did I brag about it?
And I'll admit it though, my rep is deserved
But I'll be real, I wanna kill it though, 'cause havin' that rep is a curse (Yo-oh)
My last girl cheated on me with a close friend
That's two relationships, I had to watch 'em both end
But see, it messed with me, the two people I trusted most
I could shrug it off on drunk'ness, but fuck 'em both
See, that switched somethin' inside of me
A beast came alive in me and started just eatin' away the pride in me
Because we're known to make mistakes and I've grown to make a change
I was different back then, but now I ain't the same

My mama always told me, papa always warned me
Don't hang around boys like you
Teacher always told me never to be naughty
Don't mess around with boys like you
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position with you

Get you in the sheets (Yeah), and hit it up and leave ya ()
Believe it, believe me, you are gonna say
My reputation precedes me, but you gotta be fair
Though you might'a heard about the numbers that I sleep with

Ch-ch-choose your own adventure

You, look where you can end up
And when it ends up, who will you remember?
Me, go and set the trend for
Anyone who’s met ya, you will be the benchmark
We all on the starting five, you've secluded to the bench
Have a think, though, who are you to them?
Get ya arse up and remove it from the fence

I do what I want and whenever I can

See, I can't turn off
Stay up all night, never gon’ know
If I don’t, if I don’t

There’s some new faces
We change the game but can you blame us?
All they care about is who’s famous
What true fame is, but fuck ‘em, game on
Who they kiddin'?
Fuck Facebook and new age critics
I'mma do it like Bruce Wayne did it
Get a new cape fitted ‘cause I do save innit
Is it gonna be a new age gimmick?
Is he gonna rap with 2 Chainz, eh-eh
How much can a dude make, millions
How do you think I bought a new plane, I did it
Now I really got a new place fitted
I ain’t stupid, I do save with it
Never gonna get it with a suitcase fitted
How you'll gonna know, though, if you ain’t in it?
Forget it, go and get prepared
Fuck fear, we ain’t never scared
I know what'll get us there
In our heads wear the crown
Like ""fuck it, we’re already there""

See, I can't turn off
Stay up all night, never gon’ know
If I don’t, if I don’t
See, I can't turn off

Bring It,What You Hear Is What You Buy,2008,"Ground up!

Yo
I'm disliked 'cause I’m clean cut, I don’t even seem rough (nup)
All this hate fuckin' shits me like this scene does
I'm as real as you, rappin' is my life
But I smile in my pictures 'cause I'm happy I’m alive (I am)
When rap started, it was meant to be the positive sound
These days, it's gone the opposite route
And I rap like a bully, you act like a pussy
So-called veterans but you rap like you're rookies
Fair enough, to drop an album, you will take your time
But you’ve been workin' on your album since like eighty-nine
I was gonna take years, yeah, maybe five
But that ain't takin' time, that’s a fuckin' waste of time (uh)
A whole album of your flows flippin' syllables
Quick to hate others when your own shit is pitiful (wack)
Why don't you try and be your own individual?
Everything you stand for is so hypocritical
You hate on us because of photo shoots
But when you pose to look hard, they're called photos too
And if you're poor, evil and rough, the scene'll love yours
But get commercial media love then you're done for
I'll pay you dudes respect when I actually feel your music
You want to know we smashing and rapping in here? The youth is
Call us pathetic, I'll tell you what pathetic is
This whole scene's topic range is always something negative
Yo, the girls like us, we dress with impressive taste (what?)
They hate you, you dress to impress your mates (true)
I went for it when I looked at the risk
I got balls, jumped up and dissed the Hoods at a gig
Now a bunch of dudes, when they see me, really want to break my jaw
But the hood status is exactly what I’m aiming for
And now these tough emcees want to see me fuckin' bleed
It wasn't a threat, that line was only tongue in cheek (fuck)
This scene is hard to find the energy for
This is heart on the sleeve rap, leave the rest at the door
And I lost a fan base just like never before
I've been shunned 'cause I ain’t workin' with Trem anymore
I was stoked to be down with the Lyrical Commission
That style wasn’t me though, I was innocently driven
And watch you run and say that '60 went and dissed them
That ain’t a diss, you dumb-arse, it's a difference of opinion
It takes a man to admit it, yo, it wasn't me
I love that raw style but honestly, it's not for me
It ain’t me, yeah, you can’t hate me
'Cause I love Lord Finesse but I'd rather listen to Jay-Z
So if someone hates me, they react physically
I wonder why? They can’t fuck with me lyrically
And you can hate me 'cause I’m singin' on tracks
But if you got a problem, then come and bring it on wax

I'll burn you, yeah
That was to anyone, I’m fuckin' over it

Broken Wings,Falling & Flying,2011,"Here's someone I'd like you to meet – rock bottom
You can hide it sometimes, today is not an option
You want to tell your friends, and you wanna spit it out
It's pretty hard to do, you'd hate to think you'd bring 'em down
But even though you'd want 'em to if they were in need of you
Even though the front is hard to hold, it's still easier
And every day it shows its face, you're getting killed inside
It's so twisted, it's the thing that makes you feel alive
So you can't leave it, it's like you half need it
That inner demon, it makes you want to quit believing
I know how you feel and really, oh, I know it's true
'Cause, honestly, that's exactly what I'm going through

My wings are broken
My wings are broken

You're in the eye of the storm
Should be glad in a way, that's where lightning is formed
All these clouds that surrounded around you, fighting a war
You've seen this violence before, but you don't know what you're fighting it for
It's so hard to let your heart embrace it
You see it's hard to take it, it's getting larger and you can't escape it
It's like you can't uncover this grey cloud on you
So you sit there, hoping it rains down on you
It'll swallow you whole. You know that that's standard
You see the ground, but it's bound to be a crash landing
You need to be here now, you always go within
You want to touch down, it's hard to do with broken wings
It's like your hearts pain is everything you can't take
Forget about your past days, remember that our scars fade
I know how you feel, talking 'bout it won't do
But you'll be fine that's exactly what I'm going through

By All Means,Utopia,2014,"Uh
Yeah

Yeah, can you keep a secret, dude?
We'll keep this shit, between me and you
I've only ever told one person, my girlfriend
So i thought i'd go and let the world in
Look, brother, I love ya, but we're a health risk
Using false wings to escape where no-one else lives
We can't help this
But I'm making myself sick
At how you and I are always making ourselves sick
It's like the drugs are the only thing that'll help this
Really it's that shit in our past we haven't dealt with
I'm scared if it was something I dealt with
I'd be in a cell or have my arm where the belt is
Cause I'd find where that motherfuckers house is
Ask where he got the cards in a hand that he dealt us
Hey yo, I'm sorry if that's selfish
I just ain't afraid to say the shit that no-one else is

Please don't let me go
I'm hanging by a thread
You don't know this but I need you
To save me from myself
Or give me something else
To live for cause I'm dying slowly

Listen, yo, this is the mindset i called in
While chasing after your dream
When you needed more sleep you gotta stay awake
If you want to make it a sure thing
When life gives you the short string
Confusion is the core thing
Spend time just wondering what it all means
If somebody could guide me, by all means
I had to put the bottle down
And the pills, i don't pop em' now
Always escaping from what got me down
Blocking out a memory i'm wishin' i had forgot about
They wanting my singles to be playful
Light hearted fun shit that young kids relate too
No-one wants to know about the planet i escaped to
As therapy i used to get rid of something painful

Please don't let me go
I'm hanging by a thread
You don't know this but I need you
To save me from myself
Or give me something else
To live for cause I'm dying slowly

Don't take this song as me complaining but
I know that I'm saying crazy stuff
My close friends are always telling me i say too much
But those that have been through it tell me I'm brave as fuck
I'm sorry if I'm rambling, it helps me out of the bottomless pit that I crash landed in
I've never quite understood why the self-destructive me
Is always sabotaging something good
I was out of control, not all there
Destroying my body, with not a care
Now i understand everything that got me there
In a dark tunnel trying to find a light that wasn't there

Please don't let me go
I'm hanging by a thread
You don't know this but I need you
To save me from myself
Or give me something else
To live for cause I'm dying slowly
Please don't let me go

Child,Falling & Flying,2011,"When I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you
I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you

I had a father who came from nothing
He took that and he made it something
He’d seen it all by his twenty-first, right
His mum and dad both left this Earth, why?
It was the drinking that killed his mother
He’s watching the same thing kill his brother
And he doesn’t say it much but he really loves us
And he doesn’t want the same thing to kill his sons
When he sees me with a drink in my hand
I understand now why he thinks that it’s bad
'Cause he knows that it’s so evil
But he knows we’re our own people, so he lets us go

When I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you
I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you
Now I, now I, now I know, oh oh oh
Now I, now I, now I know, oh oh oh
When I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you

See, I don’t know if God’s real
But, if he is, I can image how God feels
And there’s things I’d discuss with him
I bet he wouldn’t change much but there’s shit he would have done different
When my grandpa passed away
I remember saying bye on his last few days
And I’m hoping there’s a heaven
I want to meet again
And I never met anybody as positive as him
Not many were as sick as him
But he didn’t let the illness kill his grin
And that’s why I went ahead and inked my skin
'Cause I remember the smile when I think of him

When I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you
I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you
Now I, now I, now I know, oh oh oh
Now I, now I, now I know, oh oh oh
When I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you

I didn’t know that my brother got bullied in school
If I could go back now, I wouldn’t be fooled
He probably thought mum and dad don’t fucking care
But it wasn’t even that, they were so unaware
Living in a family where money is favoured
Makes us want to say, I fucking hate it
Brother though, we gotta feel blessed as fuck
Just remember, they only want the best for us
We got a mum that’s an angel, I’m thankful
Just to even have her in my life, I am grateful
Family is anybody that close to you
See this song right here, it is overdue for you

When I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you
I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you
Now I, now I, now I know, oh oh oh
Now I, now I, now I know, oh oh oh
When I was just a child, I didn’t know much about you",https://genius.com/360-child-lyrics

Pyramid

Uh
The chosen one stealin’ ya seat, now the show’s begun
I’m known to run and feel the beat before I'm overcome
I drown my thoughts with a method that's unknown
The golden child captivate with effortless dumb flows
The drums slow down, you feel the pop of the kick
Since forever hailed on the top of the list
Selected with an impressive list of impressionists
The future chosen, elected sittin’ with presidents
Never missin’ the penmanship, studyin’ a forum of groups
To discover what they afford to pursue (pursue that)
Designated, voted and nominated
The only obligation is to hold a conversation with a high form
Converse beliefs and never reverse your speech
Forever be firm and preach, while rememberin’ the night before
This life is yours but it's gonna a lonely one
But that's the great thing, accept it as the chosen one (chosen one)

Closer,Please Be Seated 2 ,2010,"Yo
At all times now I hear the darkness calling
Yeah it's closer than it was and I just can't ignore it
So this is paranoia
Where every finger's pointed
Where everything looks haunted
Yeah so this is madness for ya
Is crazy something a man is born with?
Or just some marijuana or the acid talkin'
Or the alcoholic in me, shit I wish I had the answers for 'em
But all I know is that it has it's claws in, and I just can't avoid it
Now every shadow is a tar pit boiling over, it's so close I feel my back is cornered
And if I had a small wish, I wish I hadda fought it
But now it's too late, cause everything's too damn distorted
Yeah, man I wish I knew what started all this
I need some help and sure I can't afford it
Nah fuck your help I need a lighter now to spark the joint, because I'm fading away to the same place that Drapht was falling
Seth is gone, death is storm, this the calm before it
I'm just trying to summon the courage to bite the bullet
(Do it)
The walls are talking, I swear to god this apartment's haunted
Could all this be paranormal?
(Nah this is madness for you)
And so it goes without saying this is my last recording
Cause if you're hearing this now it means I must have done it
First off I really need to tell you just how much I'm sorry
I know that the news of my death was gruesome and hard to stomach
I'm sorry too for those who end up in the bathroom scrubbing up the mess
I guess I was clumsy, this shit was far too bloody
Plus the blade it was blunt and it couldn't cut me properly
I was in such a hurry it's close and I can't outrun it
Goodbye

Uh
Ever since a kid I felt this way
The black sheep, I can never rid myself of hate
And some will say it's a mental disease
Well I just pray that I can make it to the end of the week
It's like I'll only find happiness when dead or asleep
They say in time it'll get better for me, but it forever repeats
It's like I'm on the search to find my inner peace
And the fact I know it's never there is killing me
Cause I'll be honest I'm trying to make it work
It's all I can think about but it's likely to make it worse and it hurts
Am I positive, no, I just wanted to go
It's like I'm trapped in my mind and I'm not letting go
They try to help me but I won't let 'em touch me
Until you've been in my shoes don't ever judge me
The only thing that ever seems to excite me is the thought of me leaving this life
It's the demon inside me, it screams to release and it needs to be leaving
I make myself bleed just to see him
Don't be scared it doesn't hurt while I bleed
I live in hell, if you go and search you'll find me
I don't think this world and this earth's what I need
And I don't think this place is for a person like me
Is that really such a bad thing?
And people always point fingers but really don't understand him
I need to chill I wanna leave here, serious, I'm being real I don't wanna be here
Period
Hey yo fuck it my life's hell I hate it
99% of my life's dealt with anger
See I just wanna get a shotty, go and end it properly
Doing everybody and myself a favour
And they say that your life's what you make it

And don't worry, I won't judge you if you use too
And you should probably use one, but I'ma use two

Just unwind, come fly one time with me

The negative, just shake it off, starin' in the face of God

Maybe you can be the one to make me stop but, then again, maybe not
But, see, I'm knowing I should set you free

We wondering where we are, wonder when the tunnel ends

And I hear that devil in my head, telling me I should
What's the innocent, never missed a step
But, tonight, the steps get harder since we've met
I was getting tired, you were wired, what a bad mix
But it's thriving on a thrill too, so inviting, need to have it
On a tail, I bite, like I ain't have any say
And let the cycle motion on and grab us away
Slow motion like I'm floating when the gravity fades
The lights flashing like I'm out on a stage
I know it's bad, but I doubt I can change
Though I try, but failure doesn't seem to counter the pain
So it helps, though I know it won't last forever
Still, the next day, I'm at it again, I think I'm crossing over

And you can't trust anyone
You've had a long, hard ride
And the day's hardly begun
You've got nothing to lose
They took it all while you looked away
I know you've paid your dues
Do you need somewhere to stay?

I could out your every wrong to right

It's like a faster running man, but I'm kicking and flicking my hands (Woo)
Understand I'm the shit and I think I'm the man (I do)
Yeah, bulking on these motherfuckers
Incredible Hulkin' on these motherfuckers
I'm the dude in the gym, training his upper body
With pants on 'cause downstairs there's nothing on me
Check my damn pins, not a damn thing
Yo, my hamstring actually looks like an actual fucking hamstring
The damn gym's the only thing that I'm advanced in
Bustin' out reps in the tempo that I dance in
Incredible back, impeccable traps
And when I'm topless I'm never relaxed, I'm flexing my abs ()
In cardio I'm the best on the map
I even forget where I'm at to give my memory laps (Think about that)
I'm so obsessed with fitness that I'm the definition
When I rap, I even get the record skippin'
I got a thick neck, but shit legs, ayy?
Do some fuckin' squats then,
 Nah, I got a big headache
Ah, typical 6 fuck, skip leg day
Cunt, we'll do it tomorrow, man, I'd rather hit chest, ayy (
You fuckin' pussy
)
I do ten sets on the bench-press
Then do ten reps on the peck deck, I've got the best chest
And if you want the same then listen to your sensei
(Do it) Yeah, fuckin' 6 is really making sense, ayy?
You want the best shape? Go and get your chest great
Fuck your legs, mate, only worry about your pecks, ayy
You gotta work out the best way, where every day is chest day
Yeah, it's Forthwrite, Dem Gainz

If you wondering where 6 been lately
You can catch me at the gym, baby
It shows I got my pecks so strong
Everybody sayin' that my chest so bomb (This cunt's massive)
I know you prob'ly thinking this shit's crazy
Upper body is the shit, baby
You know I got my headphones on (
Check it out
)
Won't believe that it's a techno song
Just leave me alone (
Yeah
)

The moment that I walk in the gym
You're like, ""What the fuck's my girl doing talkin' to him?"" (Sup babe)
A workout's better the shorter it is
So I'm calling it quits before it begins
Walk straight up and disconnect the exercise bike
See people looking mesmerised when I ride by (Bye)
From the time I was born, I was never quite right
You wanna hide your flaws, I'm tryna emphasise mine
So while they try and get all energised, I
Don't give a fuck about my tris and my pecks and my bis (Nah)
I'm tryna blend in with the rest of my kind
And look like every white guy I've ever met in my life (
Okay
)
Lookin' skinny on these motherfuckers
See my arms? Muscles are mini on these motherfuckers
All these lames say it's gain season (It is)
Nah, I'm tryna find ways to train so my frame weakens
That's a main reason I spend the whole time
I'm here walkin' 'round, daydreaming in a daze schemin'
'Cause time is money and shit's expensive
So I ain't leavin' till I break-even, yeah
It's hard to summarise it, but well
In a nutshell, I won't touch a dumbbell
I'd rather walk up on these dickheads who are big and buff
While they're standing in the mirror and then interrupt ()
I hear 'em call me skinny like I give a fuck
I'm 'bout to get a nip and tuck just so I get skinnier
I idolise those skinny runts bumming ciggies in the city, bruh
And I'm not giving up till I look similar
And this is sincere, I been at this gym for six years
People wonder why I'm even in here
It's 'cause I hate workin' upper body, man, I can't take it
But if there's legs bein' worked out then I'm partaking
See me half-baked in my apartment
Stark naked, doing calf raises till my heart's racin'
And I'll start pacin' till my feet'll hurt
And do a shitload of cleans, I don't need the jerk
I'll even spend a whole night in a squat rack
How many reps is that, PEZ?
 I don't know, I lost track (
Fuck it
)
I want my top half lookin' like I'm on crack
But I want my glutes and my calves and my quads jacked
And if you want that too here's a template (
Yep
)
To get your flex game better than your best mate (
How?
)
You gotta workout the PEZ way and only train on leg day
Forthwrite, Dem Gainz

If you wondering where PEZ been lately
You can catch me at the gym, baby
You know that when I flex those quads
They're sayin', ""How'd you get your legs so strong?"" (Check out his fuckin' pins)
I know you prob'ly thinking this shit's crazy
Lower body is the shit, baby
You know I got my headphones on (Yeah)

Fuck yeah
Uh
Uh-ah uh-ah-ah, uh-ah uh-ah ah—ah

Because I'm raising hell
It ain't gonna raise itself
And I could be a friend that you know, a friend of your own
It's better the devil you know than the devil you don't

You won’t see me the flesh, only ever in the mind (nup)
Which means I’m in the flesh, but it's the head that I’m inside (yep)
You'll never see a better vessel ever been designed (nup)
Everywhere you look you’ll see a devil in disguise (yes)
The mind that I’m inside, yo, I try it on for size (let's go?)
If I’m liking it, then I just might just commit a crime
(Kinda suits me, ayy?) Then rightfully it's mine, if you with ya mates
And hear “Speak of the devil” that means I finally arrived (I'm here)
I might be in ya mind, but I’m dead forever (always)
And if there’s hell to pay then I’m the motherfucking debt collector
(Give me your fucking money)
 
Last year sat on Seth Sentry's deltoids
Helped him write a song called ""Hell Boy""
(
You are so full of shit
)
 I’ve never felt joy
And I don’t speak much, the last time I said hello
You heard it in Adele's voice (from the other side)
'Cause of me heavens gates are ruined
If I’m in ya mind then you'll never make it through 'em (nup)
Every time the coppers find a death and they pursue it
Yo, the killers last words were ""The devil made me do it""
But God made earth in seven days, bitch
It's been a pleasure to fuck it up every day since
I’m here to bring a balance to your mental health (yep)
I'll make you feel the worst that you’ve ever felt (I will, I will)
I’m the worst card the earth has been ever dealt
People say I got the Devil smell, scent from hell

In this body never felt so fly (fly)
Why I'm here? Ain't gonna tell you lies (lies)
But I'm like ""Nah—ah—ah—ah
Nah—ah—ah—ah, bitch, I can't tell you why""
'Cause I'm raising hell (raising, raising hell)
It ain't gonna raise itself (raise it—raise itself)
And I could be a friend that you know, a friend of your own
It's better the devil you know than the devil you don't

I went motherfuckin' undercover, as an alter boy in the bell choir (yep)
Just to swap all the holy water with hell fire (fire)
I might look like Voldemort but I smell nicer
Lost the plot more than an older author with alzheimers
(Where am I?) I choked out Soulja Boy with a belt, right
Farted on his son then sold his daughter to Al-Qaeda
The advocate, not the devil himself
I was sent here to help, a senator ascended from hell (I'm here)
The opportunity presented itself
I couldn’t say no, 'cause down there is sweaty as... well
I’m why America's wealth's in debt to itself
And Kennedy fell, and nine-eleven as well
They bombing kids aged eleven and twelve and blame a terrorist cell
And never mention all the oil that they gettin' as well
Fathered George Bush, raised him well (yep)
I had him on the right path by the age of twelve (I did)
But I’m ruthless, the motherfucking truth is
When he was fifty-four’s when I really started raising hell (kill 'em)
The devil's never been red before with a set of horns
With a pointy tail and a motherfuckin' metal fork (nah)
You’ve been lied to, everything you’ve ever thought
The devil is the banker with the money funding every war (facts)
When I’m around you’re inclined to write FML
People say I got the Devil smell, scent from hell

In this body never felt so fly (fly)
Why I'm here? Ain't gonna tell you lies (lies)
But I'm like ""Nah—ah—ah—ah
Nah—ah—ah—ah, bitch, I can't tell you why""
'Cause I'm raising hell
It ain't gonna raise itself
And I could be a friend that you know, a friend of your own
It's better the devil you know than the devil you don't

Bam Bam, remember the name, suck it down
Yeah, I came to be famous and take the place of your favourites
While all these ignoramuses came here to fuck around
I'm amazin', but I'ma save it for y'all to say
And get 'em wasted, but I'm embracin' it all the same
And if you hate it, you probably take it straight in the anus
Ain't no way that I'm changin' it, babe, I was born this way

I'll take a bottle of Lanolin, squirt it in your fucking eye
And make you cry them dry moist tears
That you've been waiting to hold onto for years

Pots are probably your favourite type of material
Because you like flowers, you fucking pussy
I fucking hate you

It's probably for the best that I don't have kids

Don't ask me for money 'cause I don't have shit
All I've got on me is this pipe that I smoke crack with

Yeah, 
Stand The Fuck Up
 ain't just the name of the mixtape
It's what six says to me after the sixth day
Of a straight bender with no intention of ending it
No sleeping or eating and no sense in our sentences

Flyin' as high as a kite, wired and fuckin' fired up

At least it ain't with Ryan Dunn
 
(Too soon?)
We don't give a fuck!
[Verse 4: 360 & 
Bam Bam

Yeah, I was driving drunk with Ryan Dunn
But I survived the cunt, look, I'm alive as fuck
Man, you nearly died and I really thought that your time was up
That's why I did a line of drugs as long as his tire marks
I saw you crawlin' and climbin' out from behind the shrubs
Right after your car transformed like Shia LeBeouf's
I know the line was harsh, but we're just rhymin' bars
And if you analyse it, fuck it, yo, it's kind of smart

Forever speeding, I'm always leadin' the fast life
Hard crime, doin' a bag of coke just to pass time
I'm still going from last night and it's half past nine
In the morning, I'm pourin' a glass of this cask wine
I really need to get home, yo, but I can't drive
Last time that I tried it, I passed out in the car twice
I've got to make it, I got a lady that's waitin'
A hot little-waisted Asian chick, but her titties are half white

I ain't caring what you think, fuckhead
'Cause your girl's looking at me thinkin', ""Six, fuck yes""
She told me what she wanted, yo, we discussed it
And everything she said has left me disgusted
If you believe in God then I think you're a faggot
I wrote the Bible, I was trippin' on acid
Understand, motherfucker, I am six foot four
And with a line of coke I am six foot more
We don't give a fuck!",https://genius.com/360-died-this-way-lyrics
Do You Have A Dollar? (Coin Laundry),Please Be Seated,2010,"Hi, could you spare some change?
I've been living at these stairs for days
Days like this I can barely take it
'Cause people don't really seem to care today, shit
And they're afraid 'cause I talk to myself
I wish I didn't have to, I talk 'cause it helps
Any time that it's silent and my mind's still
I hear the screams from the people that I've killed

Do you, do you
Do you have a dollar? Do you have a dollar for me?
Have you got a house on a hill and a bed for three?
Oh, do you have a story? Do you have a story for me?
Do you know the one where we all live happily?

Tell me, what's it like for you to judge me?
You cross the road, does it frighten you to touch me?
It's funny that you can go from fighting for you country
To getting locked away for fighting 'cause you're hungry
When I get money I get high 'cause I'm a junkie
I never used to do it, but I like it 'cause it numbs me
I've barely made four dollars
But I'd appreicate your help because I wanna escape

Do you, do you
Do you have a dollar? Do you have a dollar for me?
Maybe just an hour or two and a pot of tea
Have you got a memory? Have you got a memory for me?
Tell me 'bout the days when you were seventeen

Ayo, I take a lot of shit 'cause I need to
It helps me to forget it all, so gimme the needle
And honestly I've killed a lot of innocent people
Sent by a country where that shit is illegal
And if you kill in your country it's no way
But if you do it for you country it's suddenly okay
I would end it, but I never follow it through
So maybe spare some money, just a dollar will do
Thank you

Do you, do you
Do you have a dollar? Do you have a dollar for me?
Maybe just an hour or two and a pot of tea
Have you got a memory? Have you got a memory for me?
Tell me 'bout the days when you were seventeen
Do you have a dollar? Do you have a dollar for me?

Have you got a memory? Have you got a memory for me?

Talk about most media, ""I hate it""
They should report the news and not create it
Everyday obsessing with anybody that's famous
And make up there own little stories and go and claim it
Australia needs for Damien Leith
To save all his money made and go and straighten his teeth
""I'll fight you for it""
And last week I went to lay on the beach
And saw this hottie getting burnt, so I gave her some cream
""There you go"" I went to dinner with this elegant chick
Made my mission to yell and tell her what arrogance is
Made her shout me a feed and embarrass the bitch
Dropped a fart and then screamed ""Your fucking manners are shit!""
""I beg your pardon!"" Yeah, you bet i farted
Buy me a drink, I'm planning to get retarded
Anyways I'm off, you better not get me started
But you better check the present I left in your parent's garden

Ain't trying to get ???
Anything that you tell me to do
You and me got something good
Don't worry about how it looks
It ain't like we're new to this

But I'm sueing him for not putting me in the press shots
I'll change my rap name to thingymabob
So it sounds weird when anybody's givin' me props
(Hey, thingymabob's dope) yeah this kid is a fox
I'm so good I mack girls while I'm flipping em' off
Only big in Australia, Like Erin Mcnaught is
Nah, I'm fucking universal banging Jennifer Hawkins
And cats say that I'll never make it platinum
So I'll buy my shit enough times to make it happen
The Aussie scene will probably hate my rappin'
Cause really I'm a pommy, I just fake my accent


Yeah, hey Joel
Do you reckon you could just
Let the beat play for a little bit man
I'm gonna whip out my Yazz flute and show
Ron Burgundy how to do it
Hey check this out, ready?

You all envy me, I'm rap's MCG
Cos that's where I like to walk my pet TV, ""good boy""
I gotta say this is the best CD ""? vagina pussy""
I'm the MVP, 
I'll be chillin' at the barber shop
Trying to have a threesome with Tara Moss and
Lara Croft, ""Womb Raider""
I'm gonna tell you why I'm hard to stop
You know why?, Its cos my motherfuckin' cars a dog
And he's silent looking for a parking spot
That's the only time you'll ever hear his barking stop ""silence""
I'm at the vet clinic, tryin' to book my next visit
For my pet midget,for havin' sex with it
Chillin with black panthers, coppin lap dances
""get the fuck out bitch, you don't meet my fat standards!""
I'm a passionate rapper I'm Matt candid
In every interview I do, I only rap answers

So 360, where did you grow up?
Hey yo Melbourne
Ok and ah how long have you been rapping for?

Early Warning,Utopia,2014,"You started having these migraines at a ripe age
Doctor gave you codeine just to ease a slight pain
Started crippling you by the age of fourteen
So the doctor decided to give you morphine
That was the first time you tasted what the high was like
Your brain was so fragile you weren't in your right mind
We never understood that when you used to have it
We were seeing the beginnings of a future addict
And that's an honest mistake the doctor had made
He only meant to help you in a positive way
And pointing fingers in this whole shit is not going change
That we all awoken a demon that was locked in a cage
I know the drug way of life is a lonely one
I hate that it went and attracted both of us
And opiates is so hard to overcome
Playing Russian roulette with a needle as a loaded gun

Early warnings never come
Life is good when we were young
Just like the early morning sun
We will rise up
Life is good when we were young

We didn't know you were getting bullied every day
Tortured, but wasn't strong enough to ever say
School is such a tender age it moulds you in every way
Forms in forever shapes your mental state
After copping more abuse from the friends you made
All you wanted was to get some fucking better mates
So when your head would ache, you just medicate
Now you found a better way to get away from any pain
So while you crying and lying in your bed awake
You know when the doc injects your veins it'll set you straight
We didn't know because you didn't have to ever chase
Saying you got a migraines would take you to a better place
Yo, this shit is going overboard
Too deep for me to help you stay afloat at all
All we've got left is hope so we hope for more
Because having false hope is better than not having hope at all

Early warnings never come
Life is good when we were young
Just like the early morning sun
We will rise up
Life is good when we were young

There's a day I can't wipe from my memory though
Like a episode of my life that I'm forgetting to close
He was done from life from ready to go
Ready to hang his head in shame but at the end of a rope
His addiction has ruined everything though
Pushed away all his family and friends that he knows
We could of helped but he was too ashamed to let us all know
We thought he found us annoying so we left him alone
For some reason Mum and Dad was sensing it though
Their instinct kicked in so they went to his home
He was trying to get clean so he went at it alone
So many downers he would of ended up dead on his own (yeah)
I got a call that made me burst into tears
I never heard my Dad cry and it hurt me to hear
Told him it was a blessing it could be worse than it is
Bring him home to those that love him for the person he is

Early warnings never come
Life is good when we were young
Just like the early morning sun
We will rise up

Eddie Jones, I ball like a toopee
Better call the ambo
Black Rambo
Never out of ammo
Rocking camo
Two lowies in the van though
Takes two to tango
So I humped twice like a camel

Been a while, let me go
Never gonna stop till I get a fucking crown or I'm set in stone
Haters better watch me, let 'em know
Better believe, he comes straight from the temple; Eddie Jones

Rolling 'round in my city
Still haven't paid my rego (Eddie Jones)
Got your girlfriend with me
And she'll do anything I say so (Eddie Jones)",https://genius.com/360-eddie-jones-lyrics
Electric Feel,Please Be Seated,2010,"People ask why they call me ""360""
Don't
Yeah, 360, Please Be Seated
Forthwrite, uh, uh
Rockin' that Justice shit
'Bout to get dirty on it, ayy
Let's do this, babe
Yo, yeah, uh

They say the best rappers have died
So make way for the best rapper alive
And they hate, get sent back in a line
And some have come close, the rest haven't survived
I got it yo, it's my turn up and
Pay attention and you might learn something
360, I'm like Biggie Smalls
The difference is that I'm white, thin, and tall
Yo, I'll dominate locally
After that, yo, I'll dominate globally
I'll be patiently taking it overseas
And show the world ain't got nothin' over me, nah
Yo, I'm looking for some heads to kill
Step to the Six, you can test your skill
Bring 'em all out, they get kicked in the mouth
And the king's in the house so the rest should kneel

Ooh, girl!
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel
All along the Eastern shore

Damn, '60 gettin' on his techno shit
Jumpin' aboard the electro ship
But the beat is impressive, how the fuck
He gonna get any love for this metro shit?
Since the song with PEZ, no shit
With girls, I haven't heard the letters N-O since
Heard some on that yes-no tip
Know they shouldn't but they wanna like ""Yes, no, shit!""
Hip-hop yes, yes, it'll change
For beats like this, I'm accepting the blame
Sent them away 'fore we left in a plane
Gettin' trapped in the sky while the rest will remain
I been doing it since Grade 5 dude
And to get here it takes time, true
Motherfucker, I done paid my dues
It's game time (Sup babe?) so they might lose

Ooh, girl!
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel
Do what you

Just fuckin' stylin' on you cunts
Just fuckin' rip off
Yo

Yo, to get where I'm at, yo, it took its time
Gotta keep going, never look behind
And I ain't thinking that I should be fine
'Cause I know that I will be, I'll go till it kills me
Keep looking up inside for the rescue
Understand that in time it will get you
Fuck the stars, I'm flying to Neptune
I'll get what I want and my mind is the menu
Now I know that I'm finally there
While you're strivin' and fightin' for guys to respect you
You can tell that it might be the year
And it's time, and it's rightfully mine, I can end you

Yeah
Once I got told that the secret of being a ninja
Is just keep it real every time you're out, you know
Just make sure you keep your fuckin' feet out
Hahaha
See, the difference is that there's other ninjas
That think they can just bring you down whenever they want
But if you don't let 'em, then you're still a real ninja
You just stay true to your own ninja hood
That's how it goes
Keep that ninja, babe!",https://genius.com/360-electric-feel-lyrics

(Hello, Six, what ya doin'?)
Oh, just Facebook man
(Yeah, right, what ya doin' tonight?)
Just Facebook man
(Um, so, should come out Saturday, it's gonna be sick)
Nah, I got plans ay
(Yeah, ah, what are you doing?)
Just probably Facebook man
Hahahahaha

Yo, I'm a motherfucking Facebook fiend
Fuck Myspace, it's FB
So if you want someone to talk to, befriend me
Yo, I got four-thousand friends but I'm out for more
And I won't stop until I get another thousand more
I deleted one girl, she had a duck face
And this awkward lean that made me wanna smash and chuck plates
I had to block this angry nutcase (Why?)
That's because your status updates are wack as fuck, mate
Why you do that tag?
If you tag me in a pic that ain't mine then I'll remove that tag, gone
If you know people to add, go and SMS them
'Cause I find this is the best way to get attention
I don't care about the clubs and events your sending
I just care about the friends that you're recommending
Yo, I wanna sit there all day friend requestin'
And if they ask why, I'll blame it on my friend suggestions

""Dear Veronica
Thank you for accepting my add
No, I don't know you, but you look pretty cute, aye?
If you're from Melbourne, I was just wondering if you would like to get together and have a lime milkshake with me one time
Cheers babe""

Yo, I know there's others out there who wanna co-sign this
Now we lucky that we got it on our mobiles, sick
You can see me in some pictures but I don't smile, bitch
And I always give the fingers in my profile pics, yeah
And that's a fact unless I'm taking an ab shot
And I'm a screamer, I'm always writing in caps lock
And I'm a nerd in real life but I'm thuggin' on my laptop
So if you wanna fight, I got my gat cocked
I've got pictures of the bling that I wanna score
And I've got pictures of the rims on my Commodore
And fuck with me and you will see your funeral, blat
Check my arms out, Times Roman Numeral tatts
When it comes to hair, I only rock tips
I got 'em done in year 8 and they've been blonde since
I know you wanna be motivational, yo, but
Fuck you and your inspirational quotes, bitch

""Hey babe, I'm selfish, impatient, a little insecure
I make mistakes, I'm out of control and at times hard to handle
But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.""
Get fucked, I do not agree (Hahahaha)

Yo, to all my friends out there, yo, I'd like you to know this
Whether online or offline, I don't like to be poked, kids
But now I'm searching just to find me a hoe
But you ain't Kylie Minogue, so why you strikin' a pose?
Shit, she's hot, I wanna date that chick
But she got emo statuses, I fucking hate that shit (Ah, fuck!)
And let's be honest that's a dumb look, thank you
And all your pics are taken from an upwards angle
Listen, if we can tell you got a huge head now
Any time you meet a guy then it's a huge let down
You're hiding and you'll find that you're lying
While denying it as well, I can tell, so you're lying to yourself
Yo, I know you like to upload pics
But we wanna see you smiling from the front though, bitch
If there's one thing I learnt off Myspace
It's to never have a blind date with a girl who always likes to hide her face

Falling,Stand the Fuck Up,2011,"Yeah, listen
I ain't the type that'd ever choose lovemaking
But with you though it's something that I love making
And when we do I don't feel the need to fuck around
'Cause the sex is so good and I love it now
I been partying for days, baby, come around
'Cause the sex is my wings while I'm coming down
I'm prepared to do whatever you want
Give you everything of me, but the neck is the spot
I start at, move south as I head to the spot
With the muscle in my mouth, I'm connecting the dots
Yeah, hip grinding, lip biting, ignited
I'm feeling like I'm in flight inside ya
I can't finish first, that ain't never fair (Yeah)
Let me make you win, 'cause that respect is there
And if you ain't the type that'll climax
I promise I'll do anything to get you there, yeah

I don't know about my dreams
I don't know about my dreaming anymore
All that I know is
I'm falling, falling, falling, falling
Might as well fall in

It's the love that we're making
And when it's heated I honestly won't leave you marks
(Nah) And if we're doing our thing and then I grab on your neck
Ayo, I promise I won't squeeze too hard
See it started with the sex, only getting off
But now I can't really tell if this is sex or not
I know I haven't asked you at all
But can you feel what I feel? Are you starting to fall?
Listen, I ain't saying that I love you
And I ain't worrying at all if you don't love me
But I ain't saying I don't trust you
It's just that where I'm at in my life, yo, I don't trust me
Yeah, I'm unsteady, wasn't ready for this right now
I feel heavy, I'm stressing, ain't ready to be tied down
Like G said, I might be overanalysing
But I'm so over analysing

I don't know about my dreams
I don't know about my dreaming anymore
All that I know is
I'm falling, falling, falling, falling
Falling
I don't know about my love
I don't know about my loving anymore

Falling & Flying,Falling & Flying,2011,"Yo, He tries to stay positive, living in a dead town
He can't keep his head up, he has to keep his head down
He only sees ahead now, the loneliness has left
And he's focused and he's over being left out
He don't need anyone now, he's giving everything now
Look in his eyes and see it's evident now
When he, told himself he would never be left in the ground
For those who told he would never be anything now
He's known what he wants want he grows up
He'll do anything it takes, 'cause it means so much
And it's his ego telling him he sees no love
But now he sees it's irrelevant, he needs no one
But see, as he's chasing up the outline
He found a plane he created to take him from the downtime
And as he wait for it to land, when he makes it up to cloud nine
All he's gonna say is it's about time

Now that I’m all inn, I hear em calling up again (calling up)
I knew the moment that I was flying, I’d be there (calling up)

And from the start though, they always tried to single him out
It was hard though, it almost started bringing him down
And now he laughs at attemps it’s always peaking him out
But now they can’t he ain't listening now (he ain't listening now)
They use to hit him, it would shit him so he’d fight back
And then he stopped once he figured out thy liked that
He knows exactly what it’s like to be the underdog
Words had led him thinking an surprised him at the fucking top
And now they got him, he’s backed in a corner, he’s trapped
But if he starts to relax he’s a goner
In fact, he doesn’t wanna be that kid at all
And they talk, but now he doesn’t hear that any longer
He’s fighting to make a million
Hiding away and feeling
He’s trying to make a killing but he’s dying to make a living
And now he’s knowing it’s a state of mind
Hoping in his day and time maybe he’s finding that place within him

Now that I’m all inn, I hear em calling up again (calling up)
I knew the moment that I was flying, I’d be there (calling up)

And he sees the big picture, what’s the point in being narrow minded?
The ladders high, but he’s knowing that he has to climb it
All the shit he’s sacrificed, knowing what he has inside
He’s ready and he doesn't need a map to find it
It’s the muscle in his chest that he’s pumping all the blood until he’s dead
Knowing nothing will be left
And he can’t let it go, it’s hard to let it be
And you can call it pride, but he can’t accept defeat
And this for those who ain't got no voice
It ain't whether he can do it yo, he’s got no choice
Now he’s got his armor on, and they cannot stop him
Shoot what they want to, watch the bullets bounce of him
He finds it funny now that people had doubted him
Have a look and you’ll see that they’re around again
Because they know now (they know now)
They see him just standing in the corner with a smile as it goes down

Now that I’m all inn, I hear em calling up again (calling up)
I knew the moment that I was flying, I’d be there (calling up)",https://genius.com/360-falling-and-flying-lyrics

Let's go, Benzo with a Valium
Nose takes cocaine, feelin' like a stallion
And you feelin' what I'm tellin' 'em it's all because I'm free though
Words form together from the weed smoke
That uncut shit, that puff puff shit
On my back skin pink lookin' sun-kissed
Thinkin' 'bout back in class doin' dumb shit
Couldn't play an instrument but mastered the trumpet
Roll that spliff right, roll that shit tight
We will sit tight, hittin' it till midnight

No, 'cause this shit is a dime a dozen

I ain't drivin'  'cause I don't own a car
I got a licence to blaze towards an open sky
I am flyin' away on Noah's arc
Been glidin' for days findin' a place where I can go and park
Stop carin' what these other rappers think
I can hear my angel tellin' me she understands my wish
I ain' carin' if I'm gettin' paid a hundred grand a gig
I just wanna make enough to make my fuckin' family rich
I ain't braggin', I'm just keepin' it real
And I don't believe that I can, I believe that I will
Fast break all day, I've been ahead from the start
But I am so fuckin' high, my best friend is a star

Fitzpleasure,Please Be Seated 3,2016,"They got us all wondering in a brain fog
'Cause we been brainwashed since day dot
And while we face off to be their servants
They just sit behind the curtains and they play God and then wonder why we
Come through like ""fuck you""
'Cause they're the only words that cut through
Course are views become skewed
When all we ever get is untruths
So you living here in a world
That's so unjust it's hard to adjust to
But we just do, something we can't undo
It's at the point where everybody's gone insane
I try to tell 'em but it's all in vain
I'm thinking maybe we were born this way
'Cause there's always been this sufferin' on mother Earth
That's undeserved, in other words
We all been in turmoil ever since our birth on the hurt soil
It's come to a head now, but still we can't seem to get out
Because in our mind we been locked here inside
With this heave-ho with our ego
They like keep hopin' we'll decode but we don't
I really thought we're about some sort of spiritual awakenin'
I'm tryin' to figure if it's for real or if we're fakin' it
I just wanna know if it's a miracle or make believe
We do we all still feel so imprisoned if we're breakin' free?

Give the fans what they paid for
Hit the ground and I transform
This shit here's what I trained for
Keep risin', I stay strong
Keep fighting, I pace on
'Cause I realise that that hate's from
It's just having what they want
Always 'member where I came from
Never tellin' me to stay calm
If they lacking I don't wait for 'em
I just move ahead and then I pray for 'em
Listen to 'em when they make songs
And it's got me thinking where the taste gone
We can be the one to take on
And we'll go to where these rappers ain't gone
See they don't want you winning, they really love to talk

Genesis,Please Be Seated 2 ,2010,"Yeah, uh uh (What up, 6?)
Yeah, I'm back to get paid
Scratch that, I'm back to entertain
I'ma reverse any misguided
Misconception that's been attached to the name
Like, "" ain't a factor, he's afraid
He don't really spazz on the tracks that he's made""
When I see you fools it's always the same shit
Like ""Justice, when are we gonna collab? You're insane""
I've been a fiend like you can't imagine
I can see you snakes, and trust it's gonna hurt
When they fall off  with no arms to catch 'em, like
I'm Johnny Cash, man, I walk the line
I give a fuck if you sayin' it's before my time
Ayo, a good friend said, ""When you fall, you fly""
(What up, 6?) And now I know what he was tryna say
'Cause even when you think you about to find a way
Success can still feel like it's miles away
Yeah, their ain't another MC in my league
There's only a few dudes I deem fit to beat us
Me,  360, P Easy
All the rest don't mean shit to me
Get a line of that blow and immerse your brain
And this'll blow your mind, call it Kurt Co—caine
There's a feeling my heart's in love wit'
I'm half intrigued, but half disgusted
Half of me's scared to be passin' judgement
'Cause a feelin' that strong, man, it can't be trusted
One half always asks for substance
The other half fiends for that party, club shit
I asked a fan what he wanted to hear
He didn't mind long as this did the last one justice
So here I am, with my heart on my sleeve
Man, it's harder to breathe when you pass the summit
Yo, I first to touch down, last to touch it
Back to where we started, but with half the budget
I could easily've stopped by now
Another dream cut short, but it's hard to just quit
It's how I feel when the party drug hit
Knowin' that I'm on a level that just can't be fucked with
Yo

Ayo
Ayo, 60's a loudmouth, yo
(We know) Yeah, you heard me before
Yo, I'm here to make the crowd bounce, though:
Matt Shirvington's balls
Look up 'cause their ain't no limits
Me and Justice'll take no prisoners
""60, that ain't the same flow, is it?""
Mate, it's that dope that it makes no difference
Yeah, so save it all buddy
Let 'em all go 'cause they can talk ugly
But if you wanna battle 'em takin' your money
And when I nearly died it made more hungry
Uh, and I'm way beyond ya
If you got hope then I take it off ya
If God doesn't kill me he makes me stronger
When he fails it takes him longer
I am seen as a mental patient
Try to start fires in petrol stations
I'm here, but the rest are flakin'
They had shine, but, yes, they're fadin'
Now I'm livin' in this entertainment
It's understood what entertain meant
If you don't get it then you're missin' a point

And with girls I like 'em white-black like Mike Jack
Son, I'm so good, givin' women a hightide
And I defy heights, living the high life
I won't be hopin' that my enemies fail
Because I know that they'll be chasin' at the end of my trail

So to make sure they felt them I sent 'em in braille

We headbangers, yo, we actually fold necks
My soul's set on finding some gold
I'm saving my dole cheques and buying a Rolex
And hold up, if you're feelin' this vibe now
We're gettin' pretty messy if you diggin' this live sound
And if you don't wanna drink till it's lights out
Imagine gettin' Johnny and then rippin' his eyebrows out
Everybody wanna party, you're all welcome
Anybody from Port Melbourne to 
And the alcohol is takin' over
I gotta drink eight Corona's to make me sober
And even though we got deal we stay savin'
And plan to sell to units like a realestate agent
And when there's money we'll invest in some property
It's either that or gettin' cheques from the lottery

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oi, you a chat lad who would chat, lad, yap yap for a lap dance
You a snitch though with ya backpack, that is what I call a ratbag
Yeah, boy, was a rap fan, but the rappers here they be trash as
Saw THC up in a graf mag, that’s a motherfucking hashtag
Honestly, I'll kick ya sons nuts, you won’t ever be granddad
Then I'll break ya fucking spine, yo, that's the definition of Snapback
Working, I’m never not busy, this attitude, yo, I get it off 50
You wanna get it on with me, you could be Kobe's last game and you'll never drop sixty
You ain't dropping this
Like a eunuch, homie, no topping this
Whether battling or a song I did they keep yapping it like they wanna bit
Yo, they need to know that I’m adamant, it ain’t arrogance, yo, it's confidence
I’m a nice bloke, ain't it obvious? But in god mode, I’m on top a this
But at my shows I sell tix and ain't talking 'bout where Boston is
(Goddamn) You dunno what the roster is, and I ain’t talking 'bout a gab, but I got a gift
And getting off the piss and off the piff and off the sniff made me wanna jump off a cliff
Say no when I'm offered pip, better than ever whenever off the shit
I don’t care for your problem, I dodge 'em, you can get ya mug shot tryna rob the kid
Won’t back down, ain't the type to go chat now
If someone's turning their lights off all I say is I blacked out
They mustn’t know who raised me or the circles that I rapped 'round
Those same dudes who raised me you should see the circles I wrapped round
These past years been a big blur, in poor form, but I’m back now
My arm says keep evolving and I’m upping the level the way I rap, now
See the whole game gonna back out, when I stood up, homie, yo, they sat down
Every single thing that I wanna happen, yo, it's gonna happen 'cause it's mapped out
Couldn’t write with a crown on so I got it sitting in my lap now
If you wanna do it we can get into it, but I guarantee you're gonna tap out
In a battle they say 3 won, that's the way that all the votes go
All I’m hearing though, ""3.6., is it cool to get a photo?""
Of course it is, you don’t need to ask, but listen up because I’m so close
Said three-one-three-six, that's my old postcode if you don’t know
Went from hanging out at Eastland (Hanging out at Eastland)
To a massive house on the beach end (To a massive house on the beach end)
I ain't bragging 'bout my achievements, I’m saying anybody can achieve 'em
If you got a passion you believe in, if you wanna have it you can reach it
Just dream big (Get to it) Yo, it's obvious I been to hell and back
I'ma show the world where Melbourne at, this is my city, I'ma tell 'em that
(Where the album at?) Don’t tell 'em that, they're like 
""Why's this not a album track?""
All the best shit I have held it back, but doesn’t matter, I got hella raps
No swagger jacking, they just yell on tracks, everybody here can tell I’m back
I’m on top 'cause you dropped off, now you in the middle like where Malcolm at
I can see I’m making fellas sad, like a telepath I can tell you that
I can tell you're mad 'cause I’m with a girl that is hella bad and you jealous as
She make more money than me, she make more money than me, yeah, she a boss bitch
Even on holiday she was a money machine, there ain't no off switch
You a germ, man that they gassing up, but no Auschwitz
Get 'em jumping 'round goth chicks in mosh pits at them rock gigs
Never mind, yo, I got this, 60 never been robbed, bitch
'Cause growing up in that Ringwood, boy, learned to hide my money where my sock is
Better get it, yo, you're not this, from the country of the convicts
I was living gritty, hitting skiddies, but this mini little city's where my squad is (Squad)
Dropped hits and then got rich, hitting 'em up with that bomb shit (Boom)
Understand when that bomb hits you’ll be breathing it in like that bong rip

You won't admit to it
It makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect
You can't live like this (yeah, yo)

Fuck I'm sick of this anxiety
Feel like my brain is a massive gang fighting me
It's the last thing I want but it's fast in
Feeling like this shit is taking over and I can't think
Honestly I'm on the brink of insanity
With no luck and no fuckin' grip on reality
I try to block it out but it's too hard to keep ignorin'
How can I when I don't know the reason for it
I wish I didn't have to react
This depression, yo, it has to be that, I'm having panic attacks
Doctors want to give me anti-depressants
But fuck that I know that it won't answer the questions
Yo I need some love, tried to see a shrink
But I fuckin' hate it, always feel like I'm being judged
To most people yo I know I'm not seeming fucked
I've got the best shield I'm knowing how to keep it up

Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect
You can't live like this (yeah)

It's like I always live in the past tense
Think of the steps to here, quick to discard them
Always missing a mark and
Pickin' apart what I did and what I can't get
Best friendin' me to myself it seems
My energy's giving a selfish means
My self esteem's driven by my never content nature
I love the chase, never shelf the dream
No matter how unattainable it may be
'Cause even if I fall short, it's all forward, maybe
Till the devil that's on my shoulder
Tells me silver lining looks better a little golder
Damn, in the mirror like ""Look at yourself
Where's your head at? You're crooked as hell""
Got me reaching for that angel, in need of a halo
Instead, I'm right here, speakin' to a stranger

Your heart's a mess

It makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect
You can't live like this
Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect

Hectickest,Please Be Seated 3,2016,"Ayy bro
Have you ever met that fucking Tommy Sixx cunt man?
That cunt's a fucking nutcase, ayy, I've seen-
I've seen the cunt full fly kick this fucking nanny right in her tits, mate
Mate, he's fucking mental repping FTP and shit
When it comes to fucking hectic cunts, he is the hectickest
(Yo put your motherfucking bitch up homie, you don't know who you're talking to)

Yippy yippy yai, yippy yo, yippy yay
FTP in the motherfucking place
And you know we got a death wish
Yo you better leave that cunt alone I heard that dude's hectic

Let me tell you all a story 'bout a basic cunt
Never wanted to be shit but a crazy fuck
You might have seen him at the station once
You never met him but I guarantee you hate the cunt
Don't deserve him when he's taking drugs
He does the same shit Satan does, angel dust
And the street cred he got he just made it up
Middle fingers in the sky and they motherfucking staying up
Yo he got himself a bitch but he ain't in love
Never smokes all he raps about is blazing up
No car but he needs one
The type to see a speed bump then speed up
How many bodies? You'd love to know though
No Instagram but he loves a photo
FTP on his fucking logo
Whenever there's a camera, fuck the po-po
So hectic

Yippy yippy yai, yippy yo, yippy yay
FTP in the motherfucking place
And you know we got a death wish
Yo you better leave that cunt alone I heard that dude's hectic

No guns but he comes with a blade
I guarantee he spells ""cunt"" with a K
His crew verse you, you'll get punched in the face
But if you see him one on one, he'll be running away (leg it!)
If he's got a backpack, then he's come for a paint
Polo on and it's tucked in the front in the waist (throwies bruh!)
You should see his fucking rat's tail
I mean literally on his head he stapled a fucking rat's tail
I ain't saying he's on methadone
But I reckon it's either meth or don't so just let him go
Check the format, where's the porn at?
Spend a whole year stealing all his ex's broadband (check me out!)
Downloaded so much porn, got his broad bent
Now he hear the chick's the lead singer of a broad band, (oh god cunt)
His crew look ready for war, but to us they look ready for sports
So fucking hekkas

Yippy yippy yai, yippy yo, yippy yay
FTP in the motherfucking place
And you know we got a death wish
Yo you better leave that cunt alone I heard that dude's hectic

Listen
I'm kind of thinking that you should let him be
You fucked up though when you befriended him
'Cause he'll be the best man and he'll lose the wedding ring
And you'll find him trying to hock it in the queue for Centrelink
(You want a ring mate?) Grabs pics with his crew and everything
Face covered, homie, you ain't proving anything (throwies bruh!)
He ain't new to medicine but he brews amphetamines
No suit though but he's got the pseudoephedrine (any fucking pseudo)
And promethazine while he's chewing mescaline
Too incredible on a level that you will never be
Pick a fight like you offended him
The adrenaline in his head's a boost of energy
So fried that he'll lose his memory
So cooked he gotta Google everything like ""who just messaged me?""
""
Oi, cunt! Was that you who texted me?
""
Two phones he got a new one every week
Yo he's fed up with his bitches, he's never got a missus
Everybody gets attached, human centipede
If you see him do crime, though, you should never speak
He's on the run without doing anything
He's the hectickest

Yippy yippy yai, yippy yo, yippy yay
FTP in the motherfucking place
And you know we got a death wish
Yo you better leave that cunt alone I heard that dude's hectic

Aw, man, things have just been fucked, ayy, like; 
My fucking,
 my missus cheated on me with my best mate. She did that on my fucking birthday. 
My fucking-
The rims
 
 on my VL
 
got fully jacked last week
 and it's been fucked, the tires have been fucked, I can't even drive the cunt around, can't do anything like that, 
the fucking-
They've frozen my Centrelink payments. They're not going to give me a payment until I fucking- until I give them- give them a medi- medical certificate, or something like that
It's just fucked man, it's just like, it's just sometimes I just, I don't want to go on anymore, you know what I mean? Like I just can't fucking do it any more. But-
You reckon you could spot me a tenner?

Hope You Dont Mind,Falling & Flying,2011,"I'ma get on my sort of emo shit on this one
Gonna vent a little
I hope you don't mind
Yeah, listen

I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
And can I let it all out?
See I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out? (yo)
Yeah

Ayo, I wish I had a time machine
To change the way that my mind perceives everything my eyes have seen
And make me look at life through a wider screen
It ain't what you might believe's happening behind the scenes
I treat the beat like an X-ray, press play
Lookin' inside, the best way to express pain
Fucking up is becoming something I'm used to
But sometimes to find yourself you gotta lose you
To those listening sorry for being emo
But fuck what the doctor says, this is what I need though
Yeah, and so I'm walking into that cloud
Where it has to hurt just to bring you back down
Almost became addicted to the painkillers
'Cause without that feeling, yo, the pain's killer
You'd think having a near death experience'd
Make a smart person take their life more serious
From nearly dying to feeling so enlightened
To nearly crying and feeling only frightened
Releasing this is hard, yo, it fuckin' hurts a bit
It's the only way I know how to come to terms wit' it
And this is Matt here, I'm giving you the real me
I just hope that you can feel me

And I know you're probably thinking I should keep it to myself
But I can't, yo, I need it 'cause it helps

I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?
So I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?
Yeah

And with the partyin', I think I needa settle down
To be real, I'm getting a little messy now
A few drinks and I'm stressing out
In another state, looking for my own mum to come and get me out
I got no idea when I'm coming home
And all I want is to be left the fuck alone
I'm only being real, the depression comes and goes
Ignore it, 'cause tonight there is yet another show
Looking in the mirror like, ""What the fuck am I staring at?""
Not recognisin' the brutal mess that is staring back
So I'm giving you the deepest shit you'll ever hear
So if you got time for Matthew then lend an ear
I'm just hoping that I've said it clear
If I stay on this path, the end for 360 is gettin' near

I know you're thinking I should keep it to myself
But I can't, yo, I need it 'cause it helps

I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?
So I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?
Yeah

I see my mates like my brothers, yo
I hardly see 'em anymore, the last time was a month ago
They either working or getting in relationships
I should do that too, but, yo, I hate the shit
Don't get me wrong, yo, I love women
With what I see though, it makes it hard for me to put my trust in 'em
All it takes is one person to fail you
And then you feel like majority will fail too
My insecurities'll swallow me whole
And, when they arise, yo, I'm not in control
They watchin' every move and they move with me
Like, ""Look at that dude, '60, that motherfucker's too skinny""
I can handle friends tellin' me I'm underweight
But, from a stranger, it's something that I fucking hate
I know you're unaware that shit's a low blow
But you feel the need to tell me like you think I don't know?
No, that's rude, find a bridge and jump off
And if I tell you to fuck off then fuck off
That's not being immature about it
That's me admitting I'm insecure about it
And yo I'm sorry if I'm seemin' insane
But I wrote this while I was at the peak of the pain

But now it's got me thinking I should keep it to myself
But I can't, yo, I need it 'cause it helps

I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain (I hope you don't mind)
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane (like I'm goin' insane)
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out? (let it all out, yeah)
So I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?

How Good?,What You See Is What You Get,2008,"Keeping time with the awesome view
Cause what you give (what you give)
Is coming backing to you

It's 360
I had to get my partner in crime on this one
Everybody meet big lip Pez
Now this is my lead single, so you know it's good
How good, six? Pretty good, mate you know check it

First of all these days are full of cliche, peak game
All you dudes need change
You need to rearrange, switch up your game plan
Dress like me in the dark with your Ray Ban's
All your clothes should be name brand (Stuss!)
And only go for girls with bleached hair and fake tan

Not me, I'm sipping liquor with vigour until I face plant
While I'm in this same stance, that's right, eighth can
You know the type you see acting like a cave man
Who hasn't got rhythm so he has to watch his mates dance
I'll be out till they close the city
You know I'm representing Dipper in my clothes from Dimmy's

Yo, we think were top shit cause we're mates with the bouncer
We're walking straight through while it takes you an hour, ha-ha!
Where's the lynx, fuck taking a shower!
The girls are like cakes with their face full of powder

(How good is your game?)
How good is your game? Just tell me (The game you play)
Forget following trends, we're not copying them
No way!
(How good is your game?)
How good is your game? Just tell me. (The game you play)
So so
If you're a stereotype then get to steppin' aside

I understand why you look all sad
Cause all the emos that we know just need hope
But I'm sick of cats all wearing these fitted hats, cause that stickers whack mate, you need to get rid of that

Yo all that money that you spent wasn't worth it man!
Fuck fitted hats; me I'm more of a turban fan
My styles bummy, I shop around for worser brands
But fuck it up rockin' kicks that are worth a grand

You know the circumstance, get a bourbon and try to work a girl by returning her a nervous glance
She thinks that I'm a surfie with a perfect tan
So I tell her listen we're not rappers we're an urban band

Yo we're the raver dudes flippin' out in purple pants
Chatting pig Latin for smoking on the herbal plants
Uck-fay, ou-yay! Monday, Tuesday!
Whose your favourite rapper, guys?
Kanye, Lupe! Ha-ha, it's not even!

How good is your game? Just tell me (The game you play)

No way!
(How good is your game?)
How good is your game? Just tell me. (The game you play)
So so
If you're a stereotype then get to steppin' aside

I lose control when I groove to the beat
I swing my torso without moving my feet
And I like to nod my head if it's a suitable beat
With a nice smile showing off my beautiful cheeks

This dude, he can move and it's truly unique but see I'd rather get down counting my steps out
Cause I don't dance or even think of it brother
At my shows the whole crowd are walking into each other
I can't dance for shit
I can't stand or sit but it's clearly understood I walk really fuckin' good
So just trust me, don't test my walk, the rest all talk shit but when they step on the floor they get smoked

Hey, you know he's doing the walk
It's no joke, yeah, so watch me do it some more
And nowadays everybody's looking the same
Ask yourself one thing; how good is your game?

How good is your game?
(How good is your game? Just tell me.) The game you play
Forget following trends, we're not copying them. No way!
How good is your game?
(How good is your game? Just tell me.) The game you play
So so
If you're a stereotype then get to steppin' aside
How good is your game? How good is your game?
The game you play
How good is your game? How good is your game?
The game you play
How good is your game?",https://genius.com/360-how-good-lyrics

Antiheroes, check it

I may talk like my brain’s warped
But I could step at any session and end it with a 
This ain't no game, sport, and if it is
We're not playin' on the same court, I said with no heart
I could make war with Bogart so don’t start
Ho, I stay spaced, when your show starts
I throw darts at your game face, yo
My mind’s a plain waste, I’m too hungry to say grace
Keep your prayers for passion meals, I eat scraps
Beneath the stairs in a cheap flat in Castlefields
Don’t even speak back, I plan to steal
Everything, from your tracky to the medicine in this baggie
Harass me, now the cyanide in your brandy
You call me a bastard and I reply with “Exactly”
The formula of a nasty accident
Awaitin' to happen and I’m laughin', embracin' it
The look on my fuckin' face is sick, whatever’s comin'
I’m awaitin' it, no pressure’s runnin' through my brain and shit
I mainly sit and chill, spittin' ill rhymes
Bars upon bars about how ill his rhymes are
And I charge for ‘em now, for each verse I want a car and a house
And I ain’t sold shit, Antiheroes
Broke kids with platinum egos
I roll thick when alone, stoned with a whole clip in 

When I die I hope you go to hell and get rejected
Get thrown in an AIDS infected, waste collected, place scented
With blood, get your face cemented, then crushed and ended
With a hammer till it's asymmetric
How's that for a crazy head trip? It's hectic
Six million ways to die, to you I hope they're all implemented
Six million states of mind all interconnected
In my brain, all mixed and causin' stresses
And the result is this raw war message
You'll all get hit or develop a gore fetish
Meant to be physically tested
Given crude oil, I'm forced to neck it, nuttin' more expected
Yo, check it, the flow is perfected
Every punchline  is deflected, directed
Straight back at the source's first exit
It's like a slap to the jaw, I stay quiet
Till heads start feelin' cocky and begin askin' for war
So stop frontin' 'cause we sense the pre-tense
You ain't bad, you was probably one of the prefects
What happened? You used to be on it, you reject
Do you smoke too much green? (Yes) You losin' sight
 dream, six points, you still ain't writin' the theme
Now, I ain't tryna impress (
uh
)
Just because my mother knows a little something like I am the best

Yeah, and when I write, I put the knife in your pegs
My rhyme book's a tattoo 'cause it's inscribed in your chest
Fuck '60, I'll change my name to Kylie or Jess
Because I roll around Melbourne on a bike in a dress
The definition of a sellout, livin' life for the cheques
I'll only write rhymes till I'm rich and drivin' a Lex'
I'm crazy, I'll drive it up and down the side of a fence
While wearin' diamonds with PEZ and wavin' hi to my friends (hi!)

And I'm the kind to always lie in my bed
Throwin' slices of bread, cryin' and say ""why aren't I fed?""
And I'm nice despite live there's only mics in my set
My DJ said ""bye"" and he left because I'd fight with his decks
Yep, I find that life is why inside, I'm upset
I'm excited by death, for me suicide is like sex
But it's kind of a mess, I'm tryna find a new quest
I'm only rappin' this because it felt like time to confess

Yeah
Hey, you got no idea what's goin' on inside of my head
Nah, nah, really, I mean what's on inside of my dreads
With all types of insects who always try to infest
And different spiders in webs, they're all combined at the legs
I've been an alcoholic since the first time I was blessed
Baptised by a keg, buy a pint of Piney or Beck's
And Mum didn't help, because inside of her chest
She didn't have milk, I was drinking wine from her breasts
[Verse 6: PEZ & 
360
]
Was it a white or a red? 
Hold on, I'll slice 'em and check
Oi Mum, come and meet me now outside on the steps!
""Why?"" 'Cause I said! ""Have you had your vitamins?"" Yes!
Shut the fuck up '60 before I bite off your leg
And you're only left with your right 'cause your other side is a peg
And you have to hobble your arse around, look like a pirate with dreads (
fuck off AIDS
)
What? I haven't got AIDS, I made 'em lie on the test
Now, I can live in denial with hepatitis instead (yes)

It sounds good but I'm still kind of depressed
It's combined from the test and tryna win the title in chess
And I'm stressed, lookin' like I'm Frankenstein in a vest
Gotta try to get dressed with this fuckin' pipe in my neck
Uh, think you can kill me, take my life in a sec?
Well, you're wrong, I'm too good, I won't even die when I'm dead
My rhymes are the best, look, see my mind in effect
Nah, really you can, I'm missin' the eyes in my head
I'm fine now but there was nine straight nights where I bled
But I guess that's what you get for havin' lions as pets
Were they tigers? I forget (

I Hate You,Loosies,2011,"All right, yo

There's certain things that make me angry
Like almost having car accidents with a crazy taxi
Or letting 'em in front and they don't wave to thank me
(Oi, mate) (I hate you)
And it's like when you're chillin' at the best party
And these dudes rock up like they're a flex army
No surprise at all, they're rockin' Ed Hardy
( bounce ) (I hate you)
Or, or when you see a bunch of wasted lads
And they ain't wearin' shit except the Australian flag
I wonder if it comes built in with racial slags
(Oi, mate) (I hate you)
Or when you go into your mate's house in middle-December
He lives one stop away and this is minimal effort
Then you get off and run into some ticket inspectors
(Um... from Sydney)

So I'm like, ""Laaaa—
Aaa—aa—aaaa

It's like going through a stage where you haven't had sex for months
Then you head home with someone you've slept with once
And then you're so nervous that you can't get it up
(Just work ) (I hate you) Uh
You want my mate in the bedroom, wanting him to sex you
Saying be quick 'cause your boys in the next room
Then you crack it 'cause none of us'll respect you, no
(Bitch) (I hate you) Uh
Yo, bitch, you were so thick, oh shit
Those lips you bought have you looking like a blowfish
And you could prob'ly knock me out with those tits
(Hats, boobs, bangers, chest pumped, dang) (I hate you)
And when I'm in a club dancin' with a beer
And a dude comes up and starts rappin' in my ear
Wanna know what I think like I actually can hear
(I can't fucking hear you, mate)

So I'm like, ""Laaaa—
Aaa—aa—aaaa
Da—di-da-da—da—da—da-da-da

Like, ""Laaaa—

Uh
Ayo, I'm cool with a homeless dude bumming some change
But if I say that, ""I'm sorry, I got nothing to pay""
And then you're pissed off up in my face like you got something to say
(I hate you) And, uh
If I'm with a mate, tell him that it's my 'round
Dude, don't go thinking that it's my shout
Now you're acting like I'm paying for your night out
(Cheap fuck) (I hate you)
Fall in love with a girl, feels like it's the best thing
Give her anything, can't wait for the next day
Argh, the whole time she's using you for your best mate
(Mate) (I hate you)
Uh, my mate slept with a girl and he tried to hit the exit
Six months later, she was kinda gettin' hectic
Didn't know he was the guy she was obsessed with
Kept him there the whole time lying she was pregnant

If You Love Them You Never Hit Them,Loosies,2016,"Yo, I wanna know how you feel man
What you think you a real man
What about your children
This shit right here's gonna kill them
Thought she married a goody
But she married a bully
Fuck that, yo she married a pussy
A real man never puts his hands on a woman
No way is it okay, whether male or female it goes both ways
It doesn't matter who's the higher rate
You never touch somebody in a violent way
You're so alone though, you might die if you don't go
See it's hard to take, you can't escape
It's like you're imprisoned in your own home
One second you get a nice kiss
The next you might get a right fist
It could be any night
You knew he had a temper
But never like this
What a monster he's turned into
Now mentally you're turning too
It's not just hurting you
If you don't leave know he might murder you
You thought you were gonna be great
Now you wanna escape
But you're scared as shit
You're afraid of the dark
And the darkness right now is where you live
You don't need to be brave
Stop leaving it be
Your kids are the reason you stay
But they need to be the reason you leave
That's it you've got to leave
I hope they don't understand what they see
And if they do understand
Then I hope they view him as what not to be
I believe it's time for peace
Here's some words a wife will need
You got to know that abuse is the issue
As soon as he hits you its time to leave
Never knew he was crazy as this
Feel so trapped no escaping this shit
It ain't about taking a hit
He'll say anything just to make you forgive
No apology will ever change what he did
Can't ever take back braking your ribs
You gotta do it for the sake of the kids
So they know it ain't cool to be raising their fist

It doesn't matter if you're men or women
If you love them then you never hit them
It doesn't matter if you're men or women
If you love them then you never hit them
It doesn't matter if you're men or women
If you love them then you never hit them
It doesn't matter if you're men or women
If you love them then you never hit them

Ouch I have lost myself again
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found
Yeah I think that I might break
I've lost myself again and I feel unsafe
Be my friend, hold me
Wrap me up, enfold me
I am small and needy
Warm me up and breathe me
Be my friend, hold me
Wrap me up, enfold me
I am small and needy
Warm me up and breathe me",https://genius.com/360-if-you-love-them-you-never-hit-them-lyrics

Follow my lead, you ain't taking it again from me
I am in the zone playing at my best, yo we push the game forwards
Why you staying on the fence homie
You ain't even hopping off at all
Got the jump in real life you barely make it to the net
Working background crew but you staying with the press
Only work the front that's why you staying on the bench

You made up millis when you were making a percent
You ain't paving a way homie you paving the cement

I'm aiming for you head boy
The deal you got is barely paying for your rent boy
How you number one you ain't stadium yet
You just post it up on Facebook, creating an event boy
I call the shots, if I say it then it's in
Money off the glass then I'm banking it again
Take the money that you score and start bragging to your friends
Take the points off the board, you ain't having them again
Whole team took an L, you should take it for your friend
But instead of taking blame you just naming all of them
Start owning your mistakes instead of blaming on the rest
Taking charge like a man, stop blaming the offense

They tell me that I’m alone but I’m OK, I’m OK

Uh yeah, welcome aboard, we don’t want to make this album small
So, tell you mates that we will sell some more silly
Man, I’m hoping that Melbourne’s all with me
Take them on the road to help perform with me
I ain’t even gonna waste a breath
And I ain’t even gonna break a sweat
I came with the aim to get the same respect in one year
As these lames that have played for ten
See a lot of them have played to death
Yo, I don’t hate them but honestly I ain’t impressed with them
See you gonna wanna change directions
They be second but don’t place me next to them
I’m in a league of my own
And if they don’t like it, then each to their own
See, I don’t listen to the hate, I don’t need it to grow
And I know that I reap what I sow so go ahead and

Tell me what I’ve done wrong but I’m OK, I’m OK
They tell me that I’m alone but I’m OK, I’m OK

I was a young kid, overly known for dumb shit
I had a big mouth, I was known to run it
Only some didn’t think I’d overcome it
The only percentage that I know's a hundred
Yeah, I ain’t following leaders here
Nah ah, cause honestly I ain’t gotta compete with them
Nah, I gotta team I gotta believe in
And it’s my turn to be on the receiving end
We won’t ever be fallen
I brought em a life they will never be bored in
I walk in the life while I'm kicking the door in
And show the motherfuckers that I'm putting my all in
Uh, they can see that my sound is changing
'Cause, to me, I believe that they are outdated
And it seems that the crown’s vacant
And to take it I need to be ground breaking and so

Tell me what I’ve done wrong but I’m OK, I’m OK
They tell me that I’m alone but I’m OK, I’m OK

The fear is gone, I still don’t care, I’m feeling fine

But I can’t help hating what shouldn’t be
See a lot of people wouldn’t dream
Even when they are put to sleep
But you can tell when you look at me
There’s things that I’ve wanted to say
I’m gonna bring in a positive change
That’s a promise I’ve made
And I’ma take that blame

I'm Sorry,Please Be Seated 3,2016,"I should be dead, maybe I got nine lives?
Seven left, 'cause I've already died twice
I'm glad it wasn't bye-bye
'Cause it's my time to do it without the high-life
What I'm making is really dope
But I needa talk about some shit that happened a year ago
Hold up, let me clear my throat
Yo, I'm about to get deep but I really hope you feel it, though
See talking 'bout it hurts
Since when I was an addict but I was at my worst
No one knew, I didn't tell one person
Couldn't bring myself to do it 'cause I felt like a burden
Give me any drug, I was chewing 'em up
If I have nine lives then I'm using 'em up
No one knew my addiction, it was stupid as fuck
90 pills daily of Nurofen Plus
I know that's extreme and I should be dead, right
But I was so fucked up my tolerance was that high
That's the thing with a codeine addiction
It's over the counter so you don't need prescriptions
That's three packets in a day
I didn't get high but I would have 'em anyway
'Cause if I didn't take 'em then I'd be hitting withdraws
And guess what? All of this was mid-tour
And I can't play in this form
Having shit thoughts like I got nothing to live for
I was a zombie, I couldn't feel nothin'
I smashed four packets 'cause I just wanted to feel something
Yo, I overdosed for sure
I was at the venue, I was going to perform
I can't remember, see I was told in the report
My tour manager found me convulsing on the floor
Everyone surrounding, no one knowing what it's for
Literally no one knew that I was going through it all
I fucked up, I should be knowing this before
I'm a fucking junkie, how am I going on a tour?
I let down my fans and I owe it to 'em all
That's why I’m being honest and so open with it all
It's so hard no one knowing what is wrong
I can't talk about it so I wrote it in this song
Woke up in hospital going through withdrawals
Someone guarding my bed but nobody would talk
No phone there, nobody to call
Saying ""what the fuck is going on?"" and no one would inform me
And I’m not knowing whats it's for
Tubes everywhere, if only I could walk
A man approaches, ""Am I all right, Doc?""
Then he tells me I'm on suicide watch
I'm a danger to myself, I wouldn't be leaving
I didn't try kill myself but they wouldn't believe me
I spent a month in a hospital bed
Living in a nightmare and I just want it to end
I'm thinking to myself have I got any friends?
Or friends who don’t use, have I got any left?
There's many times where I'd want to be dead
But we've lost too many and I don’t wanna be next
Now I’m happy that I got me some rest
I know for sure now that I don’t want it again
The harder I hit the gym then the stronger I get
The more the devil on my shoulder hasn't got any strength
I let my fans and my family down
The people standing by me are like family now
Yo, I’m sorry to anyone who's a fan of me
I understand if you wanted to abandon me
But if it wasn't for my family
I would've tied the knot on the rope the devil handed me
I gotta show my father and my mum love
And let 'em know that it's not them that fucked up
Now you got a quality son
If I say I’m gonna do it then the job'll get done
I embrace any pain, now I’m not gonna run
The gym's a new addiction, but a positive one
The battle with addiction's a battle on its own
The worst part is that I tried battle it alone
So if you're hearing this and you battling at home
Tell somebody because your family should know
I'm loving life now, I'm getting it back
If I can do this shit fucking anyone can
I can't remember 'cause I blacked out
But I wouldn't change a thing 'cause it made me who I am now

Bless up
I'm back
This time I'm not gonna fuck off
I'm not gonna fuck up
I'm a different person
I'm not just saying that
I'm fucking loving life at the moment and I'm, uh
I'm very grateful 'cause I should be fucking dead

If there is a God, can I get a life-line?
With my vision now I'm forced to look on the bright side
Feel like my life is a really short timeline
So I smoke on cloud nine, die watching time fly
I've played so many incredible shows

Pour a drink and celebrate that we're even alive, yeah

Never skip dessert unless it's a sorbet
I know that you don't give a fuck because it's gourmet
You can find me up at Smorgy's lookin' for an orgy

Where you don't need to raise your voice, you control her with chips
After you roll 'em in dips, they're so fat

Who don't eat right, with steamed rice but deep-fry their meat pies
On week nights they go shopping for Levi's
But they know their jean size is way over three-five
Always moody, they're too huge to be nice
Legs are so big they wear boob-tubes as knee highs
Let's get it straight, yo, I feed force 'em lemonade
Better than the featherweights who never takin' Jenny Craig

All you need is full cream and it needs to be whipped
If you get the booty goin', grab the keys to your whip
Fatties like it rough, homie, yo, they need to be whipped

'Cause they ate smoked ham like the great Rosanne
I know there's a high rate of spike rape
But me? Fuck drugs, I spike 'em with carbohydrates

People you grew up with are layin' in a coffin
I done made it through the pain and the strife
It's my turn now, my world, my might, my light
My life, my life
My life

Uh-huh
Oi, stand the fuck up, idiot!
Tommy Sixx, bitch
Yeah
Flight so rare, it's too fast, I don't care

Hi, I am off my face
I am happy because life's great
I am usin' the music I do
While refusin' to do any job I hate
And I party like nobody else
And if you ain't down then I'm on my way
Wakin' up on a random couch
Like, ""Who the fuck are you? This is not my place""
I am ready for whatever they bring
If you think you the shit, yo, step in the ring
Competitive as ever, I am everything
And put in energy to never think a negative thing, no
""So why do you call yourself 360?""
""Wanna rap, ayy? Fuck out of my face"" Fuck off
Stop thinkin' you can take my crown
All of y'all should just lay right down
Stop sayin' that I changed my sound
I'm on top of my game right now
Give a fuck if my sound is changin'
You should see the amount I'm savin'
And plus I'm attracted to beats
When you're listenin' in and the ground is shakin'
Watch everybody love my shit
I ain't even on that punchline tip
Bring the haters out, you can hate me now
Guess what? You can suck my dick

'Cause this is my life
This is my life",https://genius.com/360-intro-stand-the-fuck-up-lyrics
Invincible,Please Be Seated 2 ,2010,"They always fantasise on stepping up
But see, I understand, I know why
But you can go ahead and get prepared
But acting like you're never scared, buddy, don't lie
'Cause see they always coming up to me
They tryna find a angle but go ahead and just dig away

But what I'm saying is to dig your grave
'Cause coming up against 360, you better get afraid
You're gonna leave here with more than just your ego bruised
You'll kill yourself, or come close like that Keynote dude
You retarded losers, you ain't got the heart to do it
See I've been ninja fighting, yo, I got the scar to prove it
You a pussy, I can tell when I look at you
And keep on saying what you want because I'm bulletproof
And what that means is that you can't get a bullet through
Honestly, if I was you then trust me, yo, I wouldn't shoot
Yo, you can try and risk it, but you will die from this shit
And we will film the whole thing so you can find a witness
I see him trying, I don't know the reason for it
I guess they wanna die, either that or seem important

Yo, you can go toe-to-toe with me
And I'ma kill you while I look you in the eye
I ain't even gonna try
And you ain't even got a chance, no
And you can go away and train for years
But my advice is you probably shouldn't try
Or else you're gonna die

Yeah, homie, I can be prepared, yeah
I can do it all with people there
Faggot, yo, I ain't afraid, keep giving your evil stare
You see the people placing judgement, I control them dudes
You see the crowd that keeps surroundin', I control them too
You must be stupid, you expecting to win
I'm in the best mind-frame that I have ever been in
Yo, I'm a killer, yo, this is me confessing my sins
And, yo, I've mastered this, so, homie, let the lessons begin
And some have said that I've been beaten but it's still not true
Go and gimme anybody, yo, I will not lose
That ain't arrogance, it's confidence, so go ahead and try, bro
But break a leg, motherfucker, I hope you die slow

It's the need to succeed, so you gonna die
They call police, 'cause of 3 and his homicides
They wanna be what they see and they wanna fight
But, yo, I gotta give respect because they wanna try
So let it just be known, if you stepping you will
Definitely go up to Heaven or they're sending you below
I should probably leave these centipedes alone
While they hearing this noise while I'm stepping on their home, like

Uh, yeah, yeah
That's the noise of me picking up a building and throwing it to the sun type shit
Or having my way with the limousine and not calling it back
Motherfucker, uh

I am invincible
I am invincible
I am invincible
I am invincible

It's All About to End,Utopia,2014,"Religion in society’s what I'm getting inspired from
My head is saying write this song, but be prepared, it might be long
It'll take seconds to get the type of clock or kind of watch with a timer on
It doesn't matter; it's still a fucking timeless song
Is there life beyond? Or is science wrong?
Fuck what the Bible wants; I'm knowing what's right and wrong
I’m like the God's son went ahead and died for us
We just need to find a cross, the same type that Christ was on
And I'll get on; so only one life is lost
I will sacrifice the lot and only want a kind response
So don't worship me, go and get a hearse for me
Don't write a verse for me, just saying out the words I speak
'Cause personally, I see they burnt Jesus to the third degree
I got the idea, you twist what I say and bring out the worst in me
Plus the hearse is the only time you'll dig up dirt on me
And that's the end so close the motherfucking curtains, please

It's all about to end; it's all about to end
Or we could start it up again
But it's all about to end, all about to end

Yeah, it's so repetitive; you need to stop the negatives
From entering our heads again, it enters in, just exit it (All about to end)
How long you gonna be consumed with this pathetic shit?
Heaven won't let ‘em in ‘cause of what their sexual preference is
I ain't perfect, I ain't sayin' I'm heaven sent
The first thing they need to change is that fucking judgmental shit
Hear what I'm sayin' and don't be taking offence to this
You obviously don't see the positivity in these messages
They've already had like two fucking testaments
They need a third one now; I wonder what the new message is
We believe it's like a presence with no evidence
Looking at the sky with no real knowledge of where our heaven is
They're really more concerned with debt and where their credit lives
And benefits, you wanna be an angel? Go and get some wings
‘Cause humans made up angels, they made up everything
We made up Christmas, different religions, we made up wedding rings
So don't censor it, try and make some sense of it
Jesus knows you’ve got cash, can he go and spend a bit?
And pay big dollars for your God to go repent your sins
L. Ron Hubbard wants to buy some expensive shit
If Christ is asking you for money, that's offensive shit
I didn't know they had any currency up where heaven is
And there's a devilish smile on my devil's lips
The exorcist, takin' every kid and giving sense to them

Too many wars won, but something that needs gone
Simply together, speaking the lie, speak of a better time
Oh, there were too many lives lost, but something we need's gone
We're living the lie, always together now, sing together now

It's all about to end; it's all about to end
Or we could start it up again
But it's all about to end, all about to end

I understand if they wanted to go all make believe
But God didn't write the Bible, it is make believe
They going to hell, they caught the gay disease
Take your ego out, 'cause every one of 'em is the same as me
You need a change some things, change the way your brain perceives
How other people live their life, whatever person they’re made to be
I'm seeing everything that Satan’s seen
And that still doesn't come close to when he faces me
It's getting cold so rapidly yo my brain will freeze
Put your hands together, I don't mean clap, pray for me
I see these motherfuckers chasin' me, chasin' me
I'll be waiting at the end patiently, patiently
Dig deep to the soul to know a human's worth
God is really a metaphor for the universe
Why hate homosexuals? What? They're too absurd?
Why abuse someone's choices when they weren't there to choose them first?
This is too superb, which life do you prefer?
Lucifer? Why's the sky the limit when the moon was first?
When your time's up, will you still believe in your faith?
Believe what you want, he works in mysterious ways

Too many wars won, but something that needs gone
Simply together, speaking the lie, speak of a better time
Oh, there were too many lives lost, but something we need's gone
We're living the lie, always together now, sing together now

Jack Daniels,Loosies,2014,"Straight out of the bottleshop, a fucking hit man with one target
The worst killer in history, I love carnage
You know when I'm around 'cause it's much darker
But it's worse when I'm not 'cause it's much harder
There's no money to your name at all, you gotta save some more
But, every week, you still get paid or still take it all
But, how can you stop a killer who doesn't break the law
My control, you can fight it, but I'll make you poor
You're a masochist, no breaking jaws
You know it's going to hurt but still you go and take some more
But, any dignity you've got, I'm gonna take it all
But my spirit's only gonna end up breaking yours

To the echos of emptiness in a guy's flask

Jungle Jimmy cunt
What's good cunt?
Let's fuckin' get it cracking cunt

Do you feel what I say? (I do) 'Cause I say what I feel (Whoo!)
I'm high as fuck without takin' a pill (sober!)
Not aimin' for a killing but I'm aimin' to kill
Won't say no that I'm makin' a mil'
Plenty of fish so I aim for gills (straight for the gills)
I start rolling, arsehole with my arms folded
Mark Holden, say something that ain't nothing, my heart's cold as
 anybody want it, they're like ""hell no""
I just want to know if Adele wrote ""Hello"" doing hard times on the cellphone

They ask me what's my goal, then they like ""what the fuck""
'Cause I don't want the crown, for me, that's not enough
Yo, I can see the future, I'm the best that's ever livin'
And I've got four years, that's twenty-twenty vision

Bent dick's what I'm known for (Yep)
, bagged a ten since '04 (Yep)
She see the D she like ""no more"", then she feel the tip she like ""No, more!"" (Ha)
I'm so raw, you don't wanna be the one to know more
They turn it out, go work it out, 
I got a perfect house, no floors
Three-Six-Oh the name brand, check it while I rain-dance
I yearn for the moot, 
head first in the bush, faceplant
Findin' yourself is like findin' your keys
Find the best tits and you sign them and leave
If you be cold and you're likely to freeze
Hug on my dick 'cause it's ninety degrees
(I hope you actually get that) I had to redefine peace of mind

That's another one, anybody wanna get into it
Yo, they never do it 'cause they fuckin' run, won't stop till we number one
I gotta shout your mum ('sup babe) yo, that's my favourite lover

Go find the best porn star, tell her to deep throat this

Yo, I might travel the world now that's an ego trip
I'm on fire, I don't have to warm up
Yo. I thought that Instagram was an app to score drugs, go

Just A Thought,Vintage Modern,2017,"Just a thought

I understand people have a lot of questions
Maybe I could rap and give you answers with a message
A lot of times what I'm rappin’ is offensive
It ain’t serious, I’m sorry if I actually offended
""How does he ever write while he's battlin’ with depression?
He could end his life in the matter of a second""
Would it matter if I end it? Yes, I wanna show a
Disorder can be a gift it's just a matter of perspective
On this planet there's a fraction of its members
They have a talent and they have to be remembered
What I have is a profession, and my rapping is a blessin'
I don't even have to think, all I have to be is present
Somethin' higher though is tapped into my head
Dunno what it is but I'm just havin' to accept it
Like I have a spirit enter me, channeling an energy
And everything I rap it’s like I haven’t really said it
I probably sound like I’m gackin' off my head
I’m clean, it’s like divinely I’ve had an intervention
I understand that it's challengin' to get it
People'll misconstrue how I actually have meant it
For me this is proof that the galaxy is more
Than stars and the planets just randomly projected
I'm not saying that it had to be invented
But there’s something much bigger, no man can comprehend it
I believe in God, but not a man that is ascended
Standing in the heavens, judging every move you make
And banish you forever, if you’re bad then you won't get in
For me it’s more simple, like it’s actually a presence
Every life, every star, every planet and dimension
Everything is actually connected
See, there’s a God that’s ready to come alive in
Everybody on Earth, all you have to do is let it
You can be anything you actually invest in
You can’t wait for it though, you have to manifest it
The law of attraction is tragically presented
It’s the secret, it’s really hard to actually defend it
They made it out like you imagining a cheque
Or a house or a car, then magically you’ll get it
I’m a believer though, I actually digress
See, it goes a lot deeper though than cash and them possessions
If you doubt it, look at the placebo effect
That’s something that you have to be impressed with
A tablet was ingested, the tablet did nothin'
But in thinking that he had it was still havin' him affected
See every thought you have ever thought
What you truly believe, and your actual intention
It matters, there’s so much power in your mind
And as far as God goes, that is practically the essence

Basically just believe in yourself
Embrace who you are
And love yourself and everyone else

Yeah, I love getting my vent on
I'm about to blow, picking up where I left off
To tide 'em over I just hit 'em with them songs
I got fifty more so I'm picking the best of
See I been building, I been getting my rest on
Yo, I can't wait to show these kids where my head's gone
And get my rappin' at it's tightest for the album that is timeless
So it’s crucial that I’m seeking the best on
And they keep saying I'm brave and I'm headstrong
But I can't help but feel like they're dead wrong
'Cause I can talk about my illness and issues with addiction
But I won't ever say where it stems from
'Cause barely anyone knows and I can't admit it
The truth really does hurt, it's too dark to give it
This is a life, we never wanna start to finish
We gotta give it everything from start to finish
In a team where we need to have the heart to risk it
Our one rule is shooting for the stars in this bitch
We're living such a life that it can’t be mimicked
Only ever setting goals if they aren’t realistic
Made to stand out, though we aren’t to fit in
Any nay-sayers and we aren’t to listen
And we spark a difference, making life that
Can’t be mimicked, the fact is though, you can't with limits
I was narcissistic, self-destructive, part sadistic
The wrong business I was partnershipping
I was a part of that party life, partying, then
Life fell apart, thank God that I parted with it
In this All-Star game, I’m the starter in it
Got that nineties fashion with the starter with it
People think I’m all about the fame, girls and money
But the fact is I really love the art of this shit
At the table where the winners be at
Fuck sticking to the rules, we ain’t limitin' that
We get enough to jump around, make the city collapse
And then we fly around the world doing victory laps
Let’s go

I just wanna thank everyone who’s been mad patient with me, and stuck by me through all this fucking bullshit I’ve been through.
But I’m back now and I’m not going fucking anywhere. I know this game like, especially in Australia, it’s really super competitive and shit. Everyone wants to be the fucking king. I wanna be the king, I'm gonna be the king. I reckon we should all share the kingdom. Fucking every rapper should believe they’re the king anyway.
Support anyone who’s killing it whether you like their shit or not. Fucking even if, even if we got personal issues I’m glad that you’re kicking goals, I’m glad that you’re fucking winning. We need more support, and uh, less ego. And any young rappers coming up, shoot for the fence. Don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do shit, 'cause you fucking can. You can do whatever the fuck you want with the right belief and the right mindset. Go for gold. Just a thought.",https://genius.com/360-just-a-thought-lyrics

We hear 'em, we hear 'em, but see we don't know how

Running on through with a need for speed
One of the few with something to prove
And nothing to lose, so leave us be
If you feel like there's nothing to live for
Honestly, why the fuck would you live for?
That's the reason I give it all
But still feel the need to give a little more
Uh, now I feel like there's nothing more to say
Uh, I understand what I'm in it for
I know I could run this all the way
I won't get another chance if I miss it all
See if could have a crystal ball, I wouldn't

See, we all need an outlet
But it seems it's a dream that most people ain't found yet
I knew it was out there, somehow from the outset
But believe me, it ain't easy picking a different route
It took a bit of living to figure out
Most keep on fitting in with the crowd
I don't fight it, there's no time to slow ride it
It'll all go by you, shit, life is too short to cruise forth
Gotta keep improving and move forward
Let the rest all happen in due course
Down there, I've been there before, don't want to be anymore
So hold steady while I walk this tightrope
I know I might fall but I don't care

When it comes to girls would you play the same game
When a baby girl's gonna take on your name?

If the future you could go and write a letter to yourself
Imagine all the shit that it'd say
Makes me wonder if you reckon it'd help
In the way that you treat girls and the difference it'd make
I wonder if you would switch it up and respect women
Instead of tellin' all these lies just for sex with 'em
There's nothing wrong with having sex, but what's being a dog
Is you leadin' 'em on just so you'll get with 'em
Would you hit then kick her out so she's all alone
Instead of doing what's really right and walk her home?
Would you call 'em bitches? Would you call 'em hoes?
Or would you be riddled with guilt that you called 'em both?
'Cause when you go and have a baby girl you call your own
Those words, what if someone went and called your daughter those?

When you're young as fuck you run amok, always fuckin' something up
It's funny though, that attitude eventually will come undone
If your stomach's rumblin' and churning like there's something up
That's the beginning of you learnin' how to trust your gut
If you're hurtin' just be open, never suck it up
Force it out, homie, 'cause there's none above your mothers love

Promoters booking us for gigs, but we billed below
You see we ain't the main acts, but we steal the show
I feel we're the best and yeah, I know this country want it
I know we joke a bit but I'm being fucking honest
And with my friends lately I'm a little bit distant
The music that I'm making is a little bit different
I locked myself away to make a masterpiece
Open up my heart and I'm giving you a part of me
Now the singles, I hope we picked the right one
Try and run with the best to represent what I have done
And understand it's so important that the radio plays it
It can make it or break it, what I'm basically sayin' is
That I ain't tryna cater to a market
I'm tryna be creative as an artist
And if you don't feel what I felt it's all good, homie
'Cause I keep it real yo, real to myself
Yo, this is what I wanna do yo, listen dog
This is me, why would I write it for you, huh?
Don't get me wrong though, I ain't hatin' boom bab
Yes, I am a fan of that, but I ain't gonna do that
I knew when I was making this I would cop flack
But I stand behind what I'll do so I'll cop that
And friends sayin' I should diss dudes on track
But see I'm twenty-four now, I'm beyond that
But see, I gotta leave my ego at the door
So from now on I ain't gonna see 'em anymore

Lights Out,Please Be Seated 3,2016,"Uh
If I'm looking at you in the eyes then you better run
Never talk shit, if I want it I just get it done
Anybody sending me a threat yo they never come
You'll be knocking at the front door with an intercom
You could have your whole city there I'm like ""bring it on""
I feel the change in the atmosphere
I'm amazed at the way that you act so scared
I'm afraid that I have no fear
I'm the one to watch
You gotta know right now I'm a underdog
On my way back up, yo I love the top
To reclaim that crown that I fucking lost
Imma kill em' all
If they hit me in the face I'm like give me more
If they want it in the street then we gonna brawl
Everybody want a piece, I'm like ""give me war""
I'm messing you up
Hit you so hard that you'll never get up
Can you feel the adrenaline rush?
Better than any energy you ever will get from a drug

Understand me it's (lights out)
Disrespect me it's (lights out)
If you want to go toe to toe we'll go blow for blow 'till it's lights out
Underrate me it's (lights out)
If you underestimate me it's (lights out)
Yeah, we'll go head to head so protect your neck or it's lights out

Sun on that come down
Sitting view while I come up
Don't want beef from them punchlines
You can get it like Ronda
Difference 'tween me and you
Nigga
Phones up while my phones off me
Me and '60'll leave you 6 deep, and we still yelling out one love
Take it on this bump off
I'm straight ill like I'm on drugs
Got a lot of people that do not believe in me
Cause they ain't mean shit where I come from
Walking 'round with my chest up
Block my dreams, better vest up but it
Don't matter, still gets splattered
Bitch I'm aiming for the neck up
The headshot
You fucking with a nigga then you're really gonna get it
On every beat I be killing it
I never see a limit I don't know where the finish is
In every race I be running motherfucker I be winning it
And I swear it's been a minute since I seen another kid writing records on the Guinness
If you wanna know the name of the next kid
Check back, insane, have a guess, bitch

Understand me it's (lights out)
Disrespect me it's (lights out)
If you want to go toe to toe we'll go blow for blow 'till it's lights out
Underrate me it's (lights out)
If you underestimate me it's (lights out)

Mamma Mia,What You See Is What You Get,2008,"Hey, Lleyton
I've been told a couple of times that I look like you, right?
Now, I don't mind that
But, in my opinion, I deserve Bec a lot more than you do
I've put in more ground work, I've been there a lot longer
And I love work a lot more than you do
So, I think it's time to give her up
Please!


 Mamma Mia
Now, I don't even know what that means
But it sounds good so I'm gonna just sing it

 Mamma Mia
Yeah, this one's for Snuzzleberry
That's my pet name I gave her

Yo, I remember watching this girl on Home and Away
Wouldn't miss an episode if I was home or away
I really wanna put my little hands up in her bra
While I'm glancing at her arse, watching Dancing With The Stars
Little Aussie queen I define, how's that?
I really love the way you get them eyebrows waxed
You'll see me every year, lurking in the grandstand
Eyes locked on Bec while the rest of the fans chant
This whole time, I've been dreaming of a lap dance
I'll show Lleyton the true meaning of a backhand (take that motherfucker)
And, really, he should be an honest register
As a non-competitor that could never beat Roger Federer
And I'll be honest though, Australia's hoping
For Lleyton to stay away from the Australian Open
(Nah, you can't come in) He wants to slap me? He better get the stilts out
She was hot before, guess what?, she's a milf now


 Mamma Mia
Now, I don't even know what that means
But it sounds good so I'm gonna just sing it

 Mamma Mia
(I see you every year at the Oz Open)
Please look at me next time!

Yo, it's like every year at the Oz Open, I'm feeling loneliness
Switch up my style every time, hoping that she notices
And, last year, I thought I'd go in as a chauvinist
Pull the helicopter out and yell ""Please notice this!""
I find pictures of her, surfing the net
Or you'll see me on the main court, surfing a net
And, everywhere she goes, you'll see be perving on Bec
I'll lurk under steps if she's in a skirt or a dress
I'm sorry Bec but I'm really jealous of Lleyton
I've seen you cook breakfast, I was smelling the bacon
I died when I found that you were marrying Lleyton
But I like cornflakes (that's an irrelevant statement)
You've got the worst voice for a TV host
I'd still let you talk on my CD though
Everybody can see it, even BP knows
We all agree, you need to break up with that peewee, yo


 Mamma Mia
Now, I don't even know what that means
But it sounds good so I'm gonna just sing it

 Mamma Mia
(I dream about you every night
But you don't love me, you don't love me)

I was with Bec Cartwright in my bed last night
The dream was so good that I slept past nine
But, when it comes to really having sex, I'm fine
I've got my Woman's Weekly magazine when I have a dream
Mamma Mia, the mother of Mia
Could turn me from a Satan to a mother Teresa
We'll get food nasty, having fun with a pizza
I'll be your only lover if you chuck me a Visa
Cheesy but true, sleasy but smooth
I'll show you another sport that's easy to do
Yeah, so what? I use a mic and not a tennis racket
But you could get a real rock star like Lenny Kravitz
Yeah, it's true that I like celebrity types
Because the TV bimbos are what kept me alive
And now, I've got my sights locked on Jennifer Kye
Why? 'Cause Greg Norman said the sex was all right


 Mamma Mia
Now, I don't even know what that means
But it sounds good so I'm gonna just sing it

 Mamma Mia

All those celebrity females, watch out
That's my whole thing, that's all I'm about
That's the only reason I rap, is so I can get closer to you guys
At the awards nights
Lara Bingle, Bec Cartwright, Kerri-Anne Kennerly
Fuck yeah, you're all gonna get it
It's all gravy Lleyton
Don't take offense, little boy
Come on!",https://genius.com/360-mamma-mia-lyrics
Man On The Moon,Utopia,2014,"Ay yo I hardly read the shit up on my Facebook wall-posts
Cause some kids are gonna hate me although
I read one from a kid who was in his teens
How he hated life and he didn't have shit to be
He couldn't take it, he hated this place
And he was gonna kill himself but didn't because of me
Yeah, I ain't a saint and I ain't perfect
But posts like that make the hate worth it
People say the fame hurts of change
All I've done is grown up, your still looking at the same person
If my views can re-arrange your beliefs, oh
If my songs can be saving a teen, yeah
If my words go and change how you think
Then I'ma make 'em believe in chasing in dreams
You see that rock I'ma land on it soon
And be the motherfucking man on the moon

Keep my head above the ground
I know the time is only now
And we can part the clouds and pave the path that
No one else has ever run
And I know it’s time to ride the moon and chase the sun
And we can part the clouds and make our way
So tell me what you want but I don’t wanna live a lie

Making music is nothing like working a job
People think I ain't deserving this spot
Being real yo, I know that I deserve it because
I worked my arse off so I feel I've earned what I've got
See me battle different rappers, always serve 'em a lot
Try to clown, bring 'em down taking personal shots
Then a certain response
Made me understand when I said faggot really how hurtful it was
I didn't mean to offend at all
But those stabs I won't have in my vocab anymore
I ain't standing here defending myself, just to gain new fans, I'm trying to better myself
I'm trying to better the world, I rap to get my point across
I used to be the dude you'd avoid a lot
Now I'm making a living out of my voice
Staring out at the stars and the moon and playing join the dots

Keep my head above the ground I know the time is only now
And we can part the clouds and pave the path that
No one else has ever run
And I know it’s time to ride the moon and chase the sun
And we can part the clouds and make our way
So tell me what you want but I don’t wanna live a lie
Keep my head above the ground
I know the time is only now
We can part the clouds and make our way
So tell me what you want but I don’t wanna live a lie

Ay yo I never just thought that I'd be anything more
Than a shitty rapper filling out a Centrelink form
On a level I thought I could never be on
Addicted to natural highs like when I perform
Got out the hole that they buried me in
Got sober, more grateful now than anyone is
I wouldn't change any of this, if I can have whatever I wish
Cause I'm stronger now than I ever have been
I don't wanna preach, but the message is this
The past happened, if it sucks then accept that it did
The past is all mental, in your head it exists
So live in the present and then it won't effect you a bit
Channel all my energy to capture the moon
Had it keep revolving and naturally grew
See that rock in the sky I'ma land on it soon
And be the motherfucking man on the moon

Keep my head above the ground
I know the time is only now
And we can part the clouds and pave the path that
No one else has ever run
And I know it’s time to ride the moon and chase the sun
And we can part the clouds and make our way
So tell me what you want
But I don’t wanna live a lie
But I don’t wanna live a lie
But I don’t wanna live a lie
But I don’t wanna live a lie",https://genius.com/360-man-on-the-moon-lyrics

Hi, I'm from the Generation Y
See they really wanna label us and separate us, why?
Look me in my eyes, we in a better place in time
And fuck what they be thinkin', I'ma never change my mind
Yeah, hear me out, I think livin' in this country's great
But there's a few things this government should fuckin' change
To our soldiers, man, lest we forget 'em
How the fuck are we still warin' when it's twenty-eleven?
Wrong, we move forward, but we take steps backwards
Like those of us who don't believe in same sex marriage
Yeah, this is the modern day segregation
See, I defend and praise 'em, I could give a fuck if you resent and hate them
So if you with me on this track then throw your ones up
And if you racist in this age then grow the fuck up
I'm being real 'cause that's how we do it son
We representin' one race motherfucker, the human one

You ain't gonna take me out, can't throw me or slow me down
Nah, you must me crazy to be thinking I'd let you manipulate me
So come on, I won't give up
You've tried for so long, but they go on 'cause you're not strong enough (Yeah)
Now that's life, pick any one reason if that gives you reason to fight

The Alfred Hitchcock
The Alfred Hitchcock of Melbourne hip-hop
360
One of a kind

Hey, yo, it’s me, myself, I, yeah, it’s '60 now
It mighta seemed like a dream since I’ve been around
I’ve been and found my feet, killin’ nouns and beats
I’m still a clown, don’t worry yo, I’m still around
I’ll only call Melbourne home when this album’s known
And I’m rockin’ sell-out shows down at Telstra Dome
I’ve felt I’ve grown, clear of all the yes man
It’s weird, my favourite MC's also my best friend
What up, PEZ? Man, I’m grateful you help me
That guidance that you gave me will be making us wealthy
This album’s fine and proud, straight from the underground
It’s got some uplifin’ shit for anyone who’s comin’ down
It’s my flow, mixed with lyrics that I write yo
People say their albums, but to me it’s like my bio
And from the crack of dawn it’s the same kid in the rap performance
Who ain’t afraid to rock a catchy chorus
And what I’m giving you, experience I’m livin’ through
Inspired by my own life and shit I listen to
And this is life, I’ll be rhymin’ 'til I’m 65
I make golden era hip-hop with a 60 vibe
I know you’re excited, but try and breathe and settle
Check all these tracks and get to know me on a deeper level
And stay positive, maybe  comedy
Whether deep reached or straight in your face honesty

What you're seein’ is what ya get now
I stand my ground and I won’t be left out (Yeah, I’m pretty excited)
I still believe in myself to get proud (Yeah, yeah)
I’ll never let myself fall or step down (360)

But I know I shouldn't stay the same
I dunno what I want to do
And I dunno what I want from you
So I'm on my way
Looking for another one to get me through
It's my bad if I met with you and you left confused
What the fuck am I meant to do?
What the fuck am I meant to do?
What the fuck am I meant to do
With you?

See you know the girl, yeah, you know the type
Yo, she doesn't know the world, but she knows a fight
She wants a boyfriend now, go and have a closer look
Talk about a bad choice like she wrote the book
She been talking to this guy for a while and he wants in
But he's a nice guy, so she don't want him
But why is it that the ones that are bad for you
Always seem to be the ones she's attracted to
Yo, it's the same shit, yo, you have to chill
You turn a small thing into a massive deal
See you don't have to care but
We have a good week and then it's back to square one
In this life that you lead most the time
You just fight with the weak then you cry as the cycle repeats
But you don't think it's a problem
I guess the first step is admitting you've got one

What the fuck am I meant to do?
What the fuck am I meant to do
With you?

Yo, I don't know who you are, where'd you come from? (from)
Why you getting so mad, where's the love gone? (gone)
Why I feel like there's somethin' that I've done wrong? (wrong)
And why I feel like you're someone I should run from?
Hey, yo, it's endless
Listen to me, come on, I don't wanna punch on
I feel like I'm fighting myself with no gloves on
Why is it that the ones that are bad for me
Always seem to be the ones that are attracting me?
'Cause she love me, she love me
But why she always wanna fucking erupt me?
It's never me though, trust me, it must be you
'Cause you always turn nothin' into something
True, but you stay upset
Yo, I can't count each and every day I've left
I give it twenty-four hours till we break up next
But I guess it's all worth it for the make up sex

Living in the sex and the drugs and the rock and roll
I'll admit it, though, I lost control
I met a girl with a positive soul
She regretted that she ever went and got involved
Couldn't handle all the people talking
I let 'em keep going and I keep ignoring
I'm past those days always keeping score
And I said it and I meant it, that ain't me no more
They see the lights and it's seeming exciting
But see as time goes by it is blinding
But see I really, really want to meet wifey
But the way that I'm living ain't likely
Yeah, being a rapper ain't getting me far
I don't have a house or a pet or a car
I'm twenty-four living in my parents' garage

Miracle In A Costume,Falling & Flying,2011,"Yeah, listen, before music was a piece of my life
I used to play basketball, that was me every night
I wanted to play college to, yo I'd reach for the sky
Until, at eighteen, I caught some disease in my eye, yeah
I had to stop playing, what should I do?
When ball was the only thing I wanted to do
Listen, that forced me to focus on music
Pez sat me down like ""bro we can do this""
After hearing that I didn't need more really
Going half blind made me see more clearly
Yo, I've learnt to take the good with the bad
I'm half blind yeah but now have a look where I'm at
When something seems to turn negative in life
You can always go and turn it into anything you like
So if it happens just remember every time
Yo, a tragedy can always be a blessing in disguise

When you're on your own
No one's there for you
When you're all the way home
There'll be a miracle in a costume

Yeah, uh
When I was young I was attracted to the dark side
I wanted everyone to see me as the hard guy
Walking around with my mates trying to start fights
Hoping they wouldn't want to cause I can't fight
Thinking back now that shit could of ended crazy
I'm just glad that situation never faced me
Back then I was thinking you could never change me
What a dickhead, that's not how my parents raised me
See I wasn't facing the facts
Acting crazy, wishing I could take it all back but
It took one of my mates to get stabbed just to realize
This shit wasn't a game, it was wack
That's how I wrote ""So Fake"" so easily
'Cause, apart of those dudes, I could see in me
So, if somebody is wanting to fight
Just swallow your pride and leave it be and that's real

When you're on your own
No one's there for you
When you're all the way home
There'll be a miracle in a costume

Yeah, yeah, uh, I nearly died in an accident
Yeah, and so I wrote this story
It's funny though how the worst thing to happen
Probably was the best thing for me
Falling and Flying shouldn't take this long
But thanks to the crash, yo I made this song
So now I ain't afraid to see the day that I die
Because, with this, I'll be staying alive (I'll be staying alive)
Yeah, I believe in believing the sky's the limit
Have a look and you'll see me up there, flying in it
It's a nice view, sometimes you might lose
But understand when you fall you can fly too
Don't let anybody tell you what you can't do
Don't let them enter in your head because they aren't you
And understand you could have anything you want
If you put the effort in to remember what you've got

When you're on your own
No one's there for you
When you're all the way home

Money,Vintage Modern,2017,"Money isn’t somethin’ that you live for
Every time you want it just a little more
Spendin’ every dollar like it’s not enough
So watch you get rich and fall in the end, so

Life is all about gettin' paid, make it all at that mental rate
Go and put the shit where your mouth is, showin' off your expensive taste
Ayy, livin' it up, not givin' a fuck, all you wantin' is a million bucks
Spendin' every little bit in a month and showin' you richer than us
Yep
Shinin', shinin' wow, how you buy that nicer house
Always spendin' that high amount, what you wearin' is hired now (woo)
Got you thinkin' that what you're makin' it'll buy the crown
What you spend it'll make you better than everyone in your entire town
Boy, you got mad loot, ain't nobody that is boss as you
You will never be the one without real ones so you go and get a squad tattoo
Look, where you shop at, yo, you drop stacks, and you pop tags, and you got cash
That Fendi that was not bad like, ""Where the fuck did you cop that?""
Like goddamn, these younger kids they've have gone mad
They see the way you livin', homie, they want that too (want that)
When you fuckin' grow they'll come to know that it's nothin' though, but it's funny, yo
You got a money phone 'cause their contacts as lost as you, you're gone

Money isn’t somethin’ that you live for
Every time you want it just a little more
Spendin’ every dollar like it’s not enough
So watch you get rich and fall in the end, so

Why live a lie, live a lie
Lusting me into the money (why?)
So why live a lie, live a lie
Lusting me into the money (why?)

Hustle, hustle everyday livin’ for that paper, boy
Sellin’ drugs and be your own boss so you ain’t employed
Money over bitches (what?), money over bitches (what?)
Are you really gonna go and tell me that it’s money over women? (oh)
I was the guy who was fine with it all, up in my mind I was dying for more
I took advice from the guys who had tried it before
(They took an L) Decided my life was designed to be more
The sky was my callin', I took it all, and we’re only alive for the tiniest portion
Acquired a fortune, livin’ it up, life—it was sorted
Buyin’ up all of society’s thoughts and make me a guy who was highly important
Life was so awesome, finally scorchin’, throwin’ around until five in the mornin’
Addicted to money and diamonds and thought it was all about that and the high of performin'
Kinda distorted, the title was awesome, decided to call it
Falling & Flying
, but kind of ironic, ‘cause suddenly shifted from flying to fallin’
Funny how everyone think of the poor, thinkin' their life ain't worth livin' at all
Go and visit some kids in Nepal and see that the poorest are richest of all

Money isn’t somethin’ that you live for
Every time you want it just a little more
Spendin’ every dollar like it’s not enough
So watch you get rich and fall in the end, so

Why live a lie, live a lie
Lusting me into the money (why?)
So why live a lie, live a lie
Lusting me into the money (why?)
So why live a lie, live a lie
Lusting me into the money
So why live a lie, live a lie

Monument,Loosies,2015,"Yeah

Thinking back when it all was a dream
Coming up, being close friends with all these MCs
Looking at it now, it ain’t what I thought it‘d be
There’s all this tension behind closed doors in this scene
In my opinion there’s room for us all to succeed
This ain’t a sport, why the fuck are we all forced to compete?
As a friend you’d never have a dude as loyal as me
I support them, why the fuck aren’t they supportive of me?
On the outside they’re proud of what I’ve gone to achieve
But deep down they’re praying I fail and fall in a heap
Is it ‘cause I’m in a position that they thought they should be
Or because I didn’t conform and had the balls to be me?
When I see them on the weekend we pretend to be friends
The second that I leave them I get thrown in the deep end
The depth of it, it depends, what’s said from it, it depends
That just shows my strength is their weakness
Yo, I feel like I kept my composure
My real friends, yo, we’ve never been closer
My fake ones act like everything’s kosher
‘Cause you keep your friends close and you enemies closer

This will be my monument
I can say I did it all with love
Love, love
All with love
Love, love
All with love

I guess I’m not your stereotype
I’m more that 'bump me in your stereo' type
We're so driven; keep the sound on the stereo high
On the up and up, this never felt so right
All these vices though, man, somebody’s testing me
But I ain’t stressing at all, it’s my destiny
This is my moment, do it for the love
And I do it for necessity, they’re praying for the death of me
It's a celebration, we're tryna stay strong
I ain't getting rained on, I'ma make it rain, don
Laugh at the people saying don't quit my day job
Never quit my daydream, live like it's my day off
Yeah, I'm really tryna see it through
You'd be amazed to what happens when there's belief in you
I mean really, this is where I need to be
So I'm just doing what I need to do
It's like that, and I say

This will be my monument
I can say I did it all with love
Love, love
All with love
Love, love
All with love

Yeah
Shooting for my dreams like a showdown
Lucid when I sleep, so real I can taste it
Time doesn't wait but we know now
So we can't be here to sit around and waste it
Shouts to my real friends and all my believers
Rid of all the snakes, I ain't sad that you're leavin'
No, I ain't sad that you're leavin'
Hatin' on my dreams, funny they're the ones sleepin'

We're all programmed to want what we don't have
And if we don't get it then we go mad
We spend our life searching, it's so sad
Imagine all the things we could change if we could go back
Let's take a journey into my soul
Break through the ice cold till eventually you find gold
Deep down still a kid but with high goals
Rapping ain't my whole life but it makes my life whole
Play the game, yeah, it's that time again
In a scene full of fake cunts who act like your friend
They can't handle being second best
They'd probably cut your throat if it meant success
Remember that if they ever approach ya
Especially from anyone who's ever below ya
You never know their motives if they're getting to know ya
So keep your friends close but your enemies closer",https://genius.com/360-monument-lyrics
Must Come Down,Utopia,2014,"The only muscle that I'm working out is beating in my chest
So every time it bleeds , it is feeding me some strength
I swear that I'll wear it on my sleeve until I'm dead;
That I hold it in my hands, when I need a BPM
My closets full of skeletons I'm eager to forget
It’s time for them to leave, so I need to get them dressed
I try to ignore the demons in my head
I won't speak to them again
But at the same time, they keeping me in check
I'm grateful that I figured out the secret to success
Now any goal I’ve wanted, I’m believing I can get
If I keep my head clear while competing with the best
With my eyes on the target, then my feet will do the rest
Stay humble to my fans and the people that I've met
'Cause arrogant motherfuckers are easy to forget
And I'm thinking I should strive to be addicted to sobriety
And try to make the most of this gift that is inside of me

I’m coming down from the most natural high
Feet on the ground
I’m coming down from the most natural high
Feet on the ground
What goes up, must come down
And I'm counting on it
I stay close, to the ground
So I don’t go too far
What goes up, must come down
And I'm counting on it
I stay close, to the ground
So I don’t go too far
So I don’t go too far
So I don’t go too far

Searching for some happiness and went got it
Feeling on the verge of having anything that I ever wanted
To be honest, it’s weird cause when you living in a life
That’s so surreal and sometimes it’s hard to know who's real, for real. Still
It’s my life I’m not giving it away
I’m sure these people hanging around who I can’t trust, but fuck it, Let's toast of success
Celebrate it;  couple more fucking faded
I could stay here all night hoping to get a little bit more high
Off a payment that all came
From having a bit of foresight
And I’m just trying to make my way through all that ego
Haters taking shots, you stave them off and then they reload
No point trippin’ off of people that I never met
Finally realising that this life I got is Heaven sent
With opportunities a lot of people never get
It’s gone by so fast and I'm just trying to keep a level head
Yeah

I’m coming down from the most natural high
Feet on the ground
I’m coming down from the most natural high
Feet on the ground
What goes up, must come down
And I'm counting on it
I stay close, to the ground
So I don’t go too far
What goes up, must come down
And I'm counting on it
I stay close, to the ground
So I don’t go too far

My Favourite Downfall,Please Be Seated 3,2016,"You only call me when you're drunk, saying I might be the one
Talk me into it even though my intuition
Tells me not to listen, it feels so damn good
To hear your voice
And I don't want to quit it's like stepping on a cigarette
That just goes on
You're my favourite downfall
You're my favourite downfall, up all night
You're my favourite downfall

Breathe me in, keep me inside
I'll be your friend, I'll teach you to lie
I'll bring you to life and I'll teach you to cry
You got a demon inside, hard to swallow when I'ma eat you alive
Yo, it's time to stop
I created all of these feelings that you keep fighting off
That commitment that you keep hiding from it is kinda gone
Why deny it for?
Meant to be with no strings attached, now we about to tie the knot
""I'm forever yours,"" no, you're forever mine
Without me happiness is something that you'll never find
'Cause I define you, listen to me and I'll guide you
You're defensive of everything I do, 'cause I've got you believing that I'm you

You only call me when you're drunk, saying I might be the one
Talk me into it even though my intuition
Tells me not to listen, it feels so damn good
To hear your voice
And I don't want to quit it's like stepping on a cigarette
That just goes on
You're my favourite downfall
You're my favourite downfall, up all night
You're my favourite downfall

Don't ignore me, I know you hear me, I ain't quiet
That wall you think is gonna keep me out, I walk straight by it
You're so fed up, try to run but I won't let you
You don't get it, like to think that you know better but you're no better
Will you leave? No, never, see I don't let up
One day I'm gonna come around and put you so low that you won't get up
(You won't) See, they say you're ill
There's something wrong with your head and that you gotta take some pills all because how I make you feel
But I'll make you feel, feel this
What would you rather: feel shit or not feel shit?
The meds will silence that devil in your ear
Until we're toe-to-toe though I will never disappear

You only call me when you're drunk, saying I might be the one
Talk me into it even though my intuition
Tells me not to listen, it feels so damn good
To hear your voice
And I don't want to quit it's like stepping on a cigarette
That just goes on

You're my favourite downfall, up all night
You're my favourite downfall",https://genius.com/360-my-favourite-downfall-lyrics
My Old School,What You See Is What You Get,2008,"Uh, yeah
Get out your memory hats
We're going back, uh, yeah
Get out them brain photos
Try and think back
It might be different to you but this is my old school
It's 360, with M-Phazes
Reminiscin' shit, check it out

Yo, with the video games, playin' 
GoldenEye
 on 64
I swear I coulda played that game till I was sixty-four
Or Double Dragon or maybe playin' Ninja
Turtles workin' the whole time on savin' Splinter
Young discos, it's funny when you have a dance
And not afraid to leave your house rockin' happy pants
Yo, I love to make my family proud
That's why I rock free dress days in hand-me-downs
And watchin' TV, hated 
A Country Practice
I chilled by myself watching Monkey Magic
Or maybe 
SuperTed
, Eric the Bananaman
Rockin' down to Granny May's and checkin' out the lava lamps
""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", I was a Nirvana fan
Ridin' down to the milk bar in my pyjama pants
For Bubble-O Bills and a stack of Warheads
Or maybe meetin' with mates to throw a Vortex
And 
Transformers
 was classic with Optimus Prime
When Megatron killed him, yo, I honestly cried

It's my old school, hell yeah, them times were good
If I could spend one week back in time I would

I sit imaginin', if I had a time machine
So I could go back in time when ya life's a dream
The happiest days, remember the past
When you were young, remember how your energy lasts? (uh)

I was a fiend for the basketball, preachin' that I had a dream
Every month I'd buy a 
One on One
 magazine
Dreams of meetin' Michael Jordan in 3D
The closest I came was Come Fly With Me in Three-Peat
And with the hip-hop, it happened in grade six
Me and mates writin' down the credits from skate vids
Method Man to Smith and Wesson  the stages
My first hip-hop CD was 
36 Chambers
And Michael Jackson, my definite best age
Obsessin' to press play and wreckin' cassette tapes, like
""Smooth Criminal"" and ""Thriller"" and ""Bad""
I watched his movie, I was glad I didn't live with his dad
And with any type of music you're forever learnin'
And a Midnight Oil fan, yo, my head would turn for Beds Are Burnin'
And when it come to Slim Shady I'm a real addict
Big L to Nas, 'cause 
Illmatic
 is still classic
Every item of clothing was bought at Kmart
But it'd always get ripped down at the skatepark

It's my old school, hell yeah, them times were good
If I could spend one week back in time I would

I sit imaginin', if I had a time machine
So I could go back in time when ya life's a dream
The happiest days, remember the past
When you were young, remember how your energy lasts?

Someone tell this cunt to go back to Eurella
No matter how hard you try, you're pitiful g

I grab both my hands for this crew 2Up
And pick two fingers because your fuckin' crew sucks
Talkin' about how you hate corners
When you dress and look like some reject bloody skateboarders
And now I'm dissin' you cats
Let me bring out this dickhead who's thinking he's black
And I'm about to let you know about a thug rapper
I'm talkin' 'bout this Judge fella, he's a fuckin' grudge

That's too bad, white kids ain't supposed to wear Doorags
When you rhyme, you should cover your mouth you slob
You wanna-be-50 Cent, jockin' how to rob

Now I'm dissin' these dudes, Suffa and Pressure and shit
The Hilltop Hoods, they can suck and just press on my dick
These guys suck cock, they named their album The Calling
Because they're getting called to fuck off
And I've got the better style
Reason loves his job at teaching because he's a fuckin' peadophile
This dude thinks he raps original
I know for a fact he told dudes he was aboriginal
I'm not being racist so listen through
He's not aboriginal, his fuckin' kid's a Jew
You're dead kid, you better believe it bitch
I'll leave you headless just like your penis is
Yeah, I diss this maggot, he's gonna get flopped away
Don't cry pussy, go to a fuckin' mosque and pray
Stop sooking you little bitch
And maybe you could get Little Mick to touch your little dick
I'm talkin' about Unknown, you little whore kid
You know that faggot you get to sing your chorus?
You thought no one would ever rebel
But your music video was just pathetic as hell
And you're a nerd, just listen
I use words of wisdom while you practice the art of circumcision
And you'll forever be shit
And maybe quit rapping and stick to sucking Pegasus' dick",https://genius.com/360-namedropper-lyrics

I'm watchin' money grow, yeah, I got my wealth on me

We'll meet you in Beverly Hills, we already paid for the medical bill, for real

National Anthem,Loosies,2012,"Ayo
People need to know I got a weakness, I'm anxious
They think I should be happy 'cause they see that I'm famous
Weekends my favourite, see friends get wasted
Weekdays, I hate it, I'm insane and jaded
And yo, I'm feeling like I'm nearly dead
See now the glass is looking foggy I should probably go and clear my head
I know it's hard for people to understand it
But when it comes to alcohol, I ain't got no self control
I know it's something that you mightn't think
'Cause two quiet drinks is like a few minor sips now
I need more, I'm knowing that I shouldn't
But I keep going, now I'm getting better and I'm clean ya'll
Airin' out my bads is a stupid move
I could give a fuck, 60 is a human too
We've got problems even when your thoughts are hitting rock bottom
Most important thing for you's to not dodge it
It's not often that I try to give advice
So maybe just ignore it, it likely isn't right
So when I go ahead and write some shit like this
I'll be going through hell and it'll fix my shit
I just really felt the urge to let you inside 6
So know I'll never reach the point where I slit my wrist
Anyone who's high yo', you have to be landing
When you come down this can be your National Anthem, yeah

Tell me I'm your national anthem
Booyah baby, bow down, making me so wow now
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Sugar sugar, how now, take your body downtown
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

Uh
It probably ain't the right environment to make it known
But the closest person in my life tried to take their own
Now my girlfriend is going through the same shit
And she knows exactly how I'm feeling, the same shit
It's fucked she had two friends hang themselves
To understand what she's going through, imagine hell
It's such a shame those girls who were leaving this life
Could never really know the pain they were leaving behind
And now I can see in her eyes that she is bleeding inside
So when I start to get down I just keep it in mind
It's fucked that we related, so dope
But after all the tragedy it made us so close
That's what I mean when there's positives in negatives
Even in a tragedy there's positives in everything
I must be crazy, I could be out fucking groupies
But that's meaningless, that life means nothing to me
Yeah, I could fuck that slut
But yo' I've lived that life and I've done that stuff
And to be with somebody that I love that much
There is no chance in hell that I would fuck that up, no
She's like my medicine for actual pain
When I'm not around her I go back to insane
So, I'm praying everyday that that happiness stays
And she can make Colwell her family name, please

Tell me I'm your national anthem
Booyah baby, bow down, making me so wow now

Go to Vanilla Bay to say “hey”
Down paninis when I'm takin' the paper the same day
I'm a loud mouth, I fiend for the loud crowd
Rock a show hard then lounge down at the town house

What? You don't think he is because his hair's crazy?
He loves to run around, representin' Forthwrite

Battered with bad vision, the opposite of hawks' eyes

It's sort of hard, we're out livin' a confused life
He'll talk his heart then they're givin' him a bruised eye

Thought I'd quit rap to be a hype man instead
And they ask ""Why is PEZ always getting shine?"" (Getting shine)
I'm like, ""It's all good, yo, it's PEZ's time""
He deserved it, apart from the beats that we murdered
The time all for me, it was worth it (Worth it)
It feels good to have a major label
They warned us, ""Don't ever let the major change you""

And I won't be out walking the fence anymore

“Equality is not a concept. It's not something we should be striving for. It's a necessity. Equality is like gravity. We need it to stand on this earth as men and women, and the misogyny that is in every culture is not a true part of the human condition. It is life out of balance, and that imbalance is sucking something out of the soul of every man and woman who's confronted with it. We need equality. Kinda now.”

Listening to this shit'll pump you up
Shit's so raw but it's never underdone
Your top five better have six number one
But I'm proud as fuck if I swallow it
Better be getting ready for stomach pump
If I leave it, I better get a tummy tuck
Not ready to be a rapper with a chubby gut, no
I'm the highest I have ever gone
On a level you were never on
In the best shit I have ever worn
All I'm hearing's ""where'd you get it from?""
This isn't cute
Rappers are terrible, this is the truth
I'm thinking this shit so I'm thinking of you
Like ""what the fuck have I been listening to?""
In the studio, they rock up
They walk in, they're like ""what's up?""
Find them a beat where the drop's tough
And spend a minute in the shit like ""job done!""
It's like damn, you and your man
All you be thinking when making your jams
Kicking catchphrases and making a slam
Think of words that they can say in their chant
Know it's working so you cater to fans
Fuck 'em all, you? I'll be making a stand
See that label? They will pay your advance
Stab you in the back while shaking your hand
See to them? Real shit's corny
They don't listen to shit, they ignore it
Their condition to think that it's boring
They want that ignorant shit inapplaudded
Rather be hitting a lick, dick in a chick
Drinking at six in the morning
'Stead of political shit that is riddled with everything that you think isn't important
This is your warning, smarten up
Say how you feel, they're like harden up
All I want, a culture that's hard as fuck
In order to do that, they target us (wooh)
The powers to be they not being honest
American radio got them some bosses
And look at the prisons, he got ‘em some stock in (wooh)
Why? When prisons are filling the stock hits a rocket
So, what is the logical model to fill all them pockets with dollars? It's gotta be obvious
What is a prominent topic of all of the songs at the top is
They talk of a life in a popular genre
They glorify crime and they want you to want it
They don't want your conviction, they want you as convicts
Even provide you that rock in your pocket
But they are the ones who are profiting from it (wooh)
The cops on the block, they don't want you to want it
Their jobs are more promised when locking up convicts
You go to prison, you top up their wallets (yeah)
You learning that life is not what you wanted
So, when you get out, you promise to stop it
Because of your past, you not get a job again (nah)
Apologies, sorry, I gotta be honest
You needing to eat, you gotta get dollars
You're forced to go out on the block and just hock again
I sorry to say they don't want you to change
What good are morals? There's dollars to make
The US of A, convict anonymous (yeah)
I sorry to say they  want you to change
What good are morals? There's dollars to make
The US of A, convict anonymous

Yes, I'm so fucking glad that I did that in one take
Fucking, fucking gl- I'm so gleeful now
I've-I've been like fucking doing this
So many times and just fucking it up
Because I haven't got it downpat yet
But, that time, I just fucking did it
 Got a fucking semi now
You should see my dick, it's like that big
But like, on a floor, it looks- kind of looks mad
I'm just joking, eh, my cock's like that big on a floor",https://genius.com/360-panda-lyrics

Went to Sydney, hit up EMI with arms out
Then I told 'em how I'm gonna murder ""Pass Out""
Let it rain, let it pour away

Until we hit the ground and pass out

Ayo, I guarantee you suckers that I'm one of a kind
Change your perspective and have you wondering why
I'm being honest when I'm saying that I'm loving my life
If life's a bitch, yo, it's 'cause you ain't fucking her right
(You're pretty loose ayy, 6?) Yeah, mate, I reckon
I'll pass out drunk on the stairway to heaven
These bitches wanna see what making love will get them
Dangerfield shirts; I got a crazy dumb collection
Had these labels in a bidding war
Had to decide that if we're gonna be signed and what figure for
Gotta lock 'em in a figure four, see
But I've gotta make a killing 'cause I can't be fucked living poor
I don't do it 'cause I think it'll sell
I'ma do the same shit if it sits on the shelf
But I gotta go and treat it like a business as well
So if the shit ain't gonna kill it, I'll be kicking myself
Me and Pez are gonna see more and get more
The champ is in the building, go and gimme my belt (Cheers)
A major label ain't the be all and end all
But trust me, motherfucker, I'm convinced that it helps, yo
I don't feel like swapping the flow
Keep doing what I'm doing and I want you to know
That it's a one-way street, but I'm blocking the road
With no choice but to sit there and watch it explode
Yeah, head overseas, man, burn it down
And fly back, watch him fade in a blurry cloud
And if you got a big sister, go and turn it loud
The show's over, so go and put the curtain down (down)
Check your size, bitch, you're below me
If you pouring me a drink, you better pour it slowly
I ain't pouring out liquor for my fallen homies
Nah, I'm pouring out liquor 'cause I'm awesome, blow me

Pez ‘N’ Six,Rarities,2003,"Uh, yo
Some people seem to think that we're arrogant
Well, you're right

Shit, I rock ridiculous bling
I made this shit at home on my own with some glitter and string
Plus I rock Cheezels on all my fingers as rings
Stole a granny's wheelchair and got it fitted with rims
Then I got a sound system, hooked it to the seat
Now my walker has to push me to the beat (Do it)
Plus we're so famous I got my own stalker
I hate to speak, I've even got my own talker
Stunt doubles, I got three on pay
Fuck performing, this isn't even me on stage (nah)
I don't record either, shook by the choice
Sixty does the vocals and just puts on a voice (
What? It's true
)
So who's heard of that Xzibit guy?
I took a trolley to his house and told him, ""Pimp my ride""
If he didn't then my fists would fly
Mess his face up so bad even his fish would cry
To pick up girls, I just say that we're rappers
Ask 'em out to dinner then I take 'em to Maccas (
Too cheap
)
If the bitch complains then I'll flip raw dude
But it doesn't bother me 'cause then I get more food (
Yes
)
And fuck hip-hop, I only started rhyme
So I can go on Oz Idol and fuck Marcia Hines (
That's it, bend over
)
And half my lines, cats question aloud
'Cause I choose my worst rhymes and leave the best ones out (
That's how we do

Ah, that-that's the chorus, dude
Are you gonna do a chorus, man? 
Ah, nah, man
Fuck a hook

Uh, it's Sixty Cent, the vocal bastard
Rockin' fake bling from your local market
Smokin' grass until we're chokin' hard
And I'll smile with gold teeth in my open casket
Always on the list for V.I.P
.
And these stupid motherfuckers wanna see I.D.?
Bitch, everyone in here wants to be like me
Plus we don't pay to travel, 'cause we fly free
I never catch the train, babies reek
If I did I'd have my own allocated seats
In pinstriped suits, we dine in class
Our drinks make my  taste like wine from casks
And my butcher's got the nicest arse
I've got diamonds in my rings made from fibreglass
I need a shit, but I got tired arms
So I'll pay a motherfucker to wipe my arse
Yo, I'm tight with money, I may be Jewish
I don't like to talk, so I can save my fluids
Fuck Bec Cartwright in front of Lleyton Hewitt
And tell him Mark Philippoussis made me do it
I don't watch O.C. on a Tuesday night
I got the whole cast at my house to do the play live
Send the bitches to my mattress, hop on
Make 'em tell me that I'm rappin' hot songs
And fuck the faggots from Saturn dot com
I only fuck bitches with platinum condoms (ha ha)
So fuck off if I'm not arrogant
I'm so arrogant that I don't even have to rhyme",https://genius.com/360-pez-n-six-lyrics

Yeah, here's the dream, I wanna go for it
Doubt's got me feeling so cautious
See my folks thought
I should probably let it go 'cause I'll have nothin' to show for it
That's when I told Six back in '04
I know we can make it, I'm so sure
I know it's just us  if it fucks then we both fall
But we won't, all right P, just leave it with me
I know I got a job, but I'll leave it quickly
I gotta say thanks for believing in me
'Cause hearing you made a believer in me
That's all that I needed 60
All these other people just reason with me

We can't just live what we think in our thoughts
We're gonna have to dig till we dig to the core, or
Everything that we're ever gonna give
I'll only ever wanna give a little more, more
Now we got a lot of push behind it
We ain't even gonna look behind us
There's a place that is put inside us
And now we're both knowing where to look to find it (yeah)
See we don't need a book to guide
But it can act as good reminder
Why're you acting we could well find our dream

For years, there's no better timing
It's been an upwards climb our entire career
See these people, they all around ya

See the haters wanna call us out, but
Compared to the love they're a small amount, uh
That's the reason we keep our distance

Power,Stand the Fuck Up,2011,"Yeah, Illy Illy, uncle 6 Dog
Stand the fuck up, cunts
Yeah

And I hear motherfuckers dissing me, tryna bait me or battle me
Berate me to rattle me, it's pitiful
Already gave a few K to charity, so I ain't giving any leg ups
To any fuckheads calling me faggot switch up your strategy
Like ""Shoosh cunt"", it's hard to keep it passive every day
When you're incessantly attacked for every action that you take
Every statement, every track, though I brag you can't escape
The fact, my arrogance is purely my reaction to the hate
'Cause I would never step on people's toes
For real, I think it's honestly 'cause nobody expected me to blow up, but
In 30 months I've gone from practically unknown
To practically the biggest fucking name without a plaque to show
But some don't matter what I give it, I could wrap it up and gift it
They'd skip it and say whoever on the track with me ripped it
Same way they say my album missed and actually think
Someone who's only heard hit singles has a valid opinion, nah
I hate feeling like I need to justify this, like
Because I'm doing must be writing just so fuckers buy it
What a cop out, haters brush aside my sacrifices
Tall poppies in a sea of ply punching pirates
Came up in the scene, paved my route
From seventeen I been giggin', thought I paid my dues
Only took a few rave reviews, a Triple J play or two
For all the knives to aim at guess who, fuck am I to do?
I don't beg no one for help for shit that I can fix
And I don't blame nobody else for sitches that I find I'm in
Ain't never withheld admiration for the pioneers or kings
So why the fuck would I begin to, I just do my thing
All haters got for their venom is jealous talks
Fuck a twenty for their disc, ain't got a penny for their thoughts
When I'm questioned with hate my only answer is love
Forward slash Illyal, tell 'em Stand The Fuck Up, right

Ayo, my plan is unstuck
And when they question who the best is, yo, the answer comes up
With 360, check the madness uncut
Yo, I said Please Be Seated but Stand The Fuck Up, yeah
I was smart to give a taste in what I'm gonna do
So sit and watch and see lotta dudes follow suit
I understand if it's not for you, true
But I wrote it for myself and it's exactly what I wanted to
I got a name from the battle scene, battle scene
I got featured in some magazines, magazines
Just another kid who had a dream, but see
I'm knowin' where I came from, I'ma never stop battling
Shut the fuck up haters
Yo, I can't battle someone nameless just to make another dumb cunt famous
I'm living in the twilight zone
Where we treatin' every battle like it's fight night though
And I'm winnin', I will never let the limelight go
But yo, I seen a lot of styles, gotta find my own
But conform to what you want, I'd rather slice my throat
And when it comes to business, I mind my own
See it's not quite underground, not quite pop
And it's not quite indie and it's not quite rock, no
I never listen, doin' 
And keepin' everybody happy, yo it's not my job, no
So you can have fans that like it
Then they turn their back on you the second that the masses find it
But not knowin' that you made a lotta sacrifices
But when the haters get you down, let 'em go, you don't have to fight it
Uh, I'm a believer in good music
If I like the beat, fuck the politics, I should use it
Yeah, them times were raw
But it's 2011 and these motherfuckers rappin' like it's '94
You can never go dispute my fuckin' passion for it
I enjoy making songs that have a catchy chorus
Never lackin' in my raps at all, plus
I am always energetic, never see me give a flat performance

That's power, bitch!",https://genius.com/360-power-lyrics

Yo, what’s attracting people to the life of fame?
The nights away binging, getting blind for days
Would you expect a tidal wave of guys
All disguised as mates to try to take a slice of that pie you made?
When you’re famous, you’re the person people like to hate
Are you prepared for all the rumours and the lies they say?
Yo, looking back at life, I’d never thought I’d go this far
Yo, I’m just thankful people welcomed me with open arms
All these new friends and people that I hope to trust
Try to take advantage, got me thinking what their motives are?

And it’s my songs then drive on 'cause a fan is not what I want

Imagine it, never thought I’d be havin’ it
Keep belief and be confident, but stay away from that arrogance
Yeah, I’m cashing in, that ain’t what’ll bring happiness
And I’m lucky, making a living off of this music, that’s what my passion is
I could go and buy a crazy fresh Mercedes-Benz
But I would rather help my mates in debt and pay their rent
Yo, I could make a trip to ATMs at 8AM
After I’ve been placing bets and partying for days on end
But what’ll happen if I never see the same success?
Yo, in the schemes of things, I think there’s better ways to spend
When I was young, I saw my grandpa get laid to rest
And what I’ve got, I’d trade it in, if I could see his face again

I said I stopped but I didn't
It's another world that I been in, listen
When I'm on it I think I'm a king
Top of the world without doing a thing
When it's gone, I'm literally sinking
And I'm tryna look for a lizard with wings
Let me get some sleep
And some rest in peace
Got me scratching a lot
And my head is nodding without hip-hop beats
Eyes closed, where'd sight go?
I think time's going to waste
We're mind blown
I think mine's goin' to space

Time wasted, so wasted
Run away from me
But I'm jaded, no escapin'
The escape I need
Time wasted, so wasted
Run away from me

And we see double now
Un-gripped
I've had enough

Leanin', can't stay up
On one, that main buzz
Purple all of my paint brush
Found a way to make pain stop
Made up a nocturnal breed
Stay stuck in this perfect dream
I'm faded, but I
Wake up the second that the curtains bleed
And I'm slurring speech
Yo, I think I needa learn to speak
Been a while you ain't heard from me
But I stay, drown in that purple stream
Eyes lookin' like it hurts to read
And it burns to see
But if I lose spit, then just let me know
If my eyes close I deserve to sleep

I'm chasin' the dragon to hide the pain, hide the pain
Come see the cloud that I live in
I said I stopped, but I didn't

Real Friends,Please Be Seated 3,2016,"Have you ever not trusted yourself?
Or wished that you were somebody else?
Like you're barefoot running through hell?
There's nothing worse than a messy junkie with endless money
Especially one on an empty stomach that's getting hungry
I seem good, but lately I've been better, trust me
Tears up on a steel frame and I'm getting rusty
I'm from a good home, I'm knowing that my parents loved me
But it's like my dog's the only one who'll never judge me
One year clean, something that is hard to get
I give it everything, I put my fucking heart in this
You wanna know the hardest bit I nearly can't admit?
'Cause when I do I'm feeling like an narkie bitch
'Cause when I'm seeing friends I used to party with
I've had to cut ties 'cause I'm feeling like I can't resist
When you get clean, it's not drugs you've parted with
Friends and lifestyle are just as much a part of it
See I would love to catch up and have lunch
But when I see you, I just wanna rack up and that's fucked
Stop being angry and fucking mad
Are you a loose end, because a true friend would understand
Never force the progression of a soul
Give me time, let me get it in control
I'm doing well for someone that was never in control
Doing well for someone that was never in control
Let me get a hold on it and then we can evolve (Yeah)

Here, take a little bit of this and
Wash it down with a little bit of drinking
Watch it now any second it will hit
But don't over do it in a minute it'll kick in
Looking down from a bird's eye view
See me running from a world like you
Yeah it might be your first time
But with me you don't need a return flight, true
This is what the galaxy's for
We'll come down when gravity calls
I understand that there has to be more
You ain't seen this planet before
All it take is to ride the right cloud
You just gotta look inside to find out
If you wanna have the time of your life then
Stop thinking the time is right now

Ahh ahh ahh, I'm running away from my faith, but I won't run alone
Ahh ahh ahh, I don't want you to love me but I'd love if you want to run
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh

Do you want me
We're a thousand mile away from anyone
Do you want me
If you want then run
You want then run

Yo, Please Be Seated, bitches
Number two, bitches, what up, bitch?

Yo, I don't understand your shit, yo, explain it first
Nerd rappers need to rap in layman's terms
For me though, it's fuck 'safety first'
It goes alcohol, drugs, then safety's third
In the last months, I have fuckin' wrecked shit
I'm a ball breaker, pun intended
I'll bust ya head 'til none forget this
Don't come correct then you'll come corrected
Fuck the world, go unprotected
Keep on going 'til it's fuckin' pregnant
I am never early
If I'm booked in at 6:00, then expect 360 at 7:30
Hey yo, bitch, cook me some eggs
And if they ain't runny, fuckin' cook 'em again
The last time I got stuck in a booby trap
Yo, I was like, ""Where the fuck are the boobies at?""
And this is how I be livin' in tune with rap
But why you gotta get rude with that?
'Cause these hoes on my dick 'cause I'm lookin' like Ted Danson
Maybe so, but Teddy is less handsome
I used to wake up, first thing, blaze up
Hey, yo, my taste buds only ever taste bud
Then me and Mary had a break up
See, I didn't want to but I didn't get the same buzz
Sick of livin' like a king for two days
Then spend the next fortnight livin' off loose change
I think I need a new name
Because I ain't made for livin' underground like Bruce Wayne
Uh, this the definition of Aussie swag
I got the crown, come get at me if you want it back
360 rockin' over Shutterbug
Because I, I, I am a funny cunt
[Chorus: Big Boi & 
Cutty

Now party people in the club, it's time to cut a rug
And throw the deuce up in the sky just for the shutterbugs
I'm double fisted and you empty, you can grab a cup
Boy stop, I'm just playing let me dap you up
Baby baby, you're in my system
Baby baby, tell me you're listening

I said, ""Fuck you, dickhead, this is me styling""
Callin' you inferior and this is me dialing
I own this microphone
So go fuck yourself if you don't like my tone
Back, I'ma fuck you tip, ignant
I don't even know who the fuck you is
Non-discriminatory
High on skill, my flow got me feeling euphoric
It's GMC, so guaranteed this speed gonna need a burial for it
Now I don't skeet, watch me go ahead
And do a bunch of motherfucking aerials off it
I stunt with the flow, nobody double lead it
Write my own shit, like Robby Rodriguez
Ride my own dick, like I lovin' my penis
Also in love with Rosario Dawson
The things I'd do to Rosario Dawson
Would both be scary and awesome, Miranda Kerr
That's the question that I answer first
But then I gotta big load and I hand it to her
Buckle your seat belt, motherfucker
You buckle your seat belt now
Sending you in like an email now
Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated
Tres-seis-cero

Sixavelli,Utopia,2014,"I'm at the Kwik-E-Mart to find where the Simpsons are
I got money to give Bart 'cause he ticked me shard (come again)
Yo, someone tell me where the strippers are
I get it poppin' like throwin' ninja stars in a titty bar
It might be a bit bizarre
But I'm at my best friends funeral I'm cryin', but my dick is hard
My mate showed me his minibar (check out my minibar)
I couldn't stop askin' the cunt where the fuckin' midgets are
Last week, I bought a Nixon mask
Stole Bill Clinton's car and drove it into Monica Lewinsky's spa
My girlfriend's a Gypsy with a job to do
I'll sign your CD, she'll rob your shoes and your wallet too
Drive by in a Commodore, ride right to the bottle shop
Rock tie-dye, no knife fights I'm a white guy with a tomahawk
Pause and ask the owner if he knows the fuckin' soccer score
If our team's losing then we're fuckin' up his shop some more

I'm the kid your parents like to hate
And I'm the kid that girlies like to taste
Yes, I'm the kid that cuts all the lines and shows up late
Everything you got, yeah I got it by mistake

I think from all the benders I've rocked and all the ecstasy popped
I suffer memory loss which means I don't remember a lot (what's that mate?)
I like machetes because it's the weapon I've got
Use it start connect the dots and your freckles and spots
Even when I'm not right I'll never be wrong
I'm levels beyond, on a level that you won't ever be on
I take a photo of how Jesus died and I'll text it to God
Message across
I got a question for God, if we got the first Testament wrong
Tell us where we got the second one from
Yo from this day I never will flop, you want proof?
I'll stab the end of my cock with this adrenaline shot
Hey yo, my cock is a Cyclops, got Nikes on and they're high tops
Meet you then tell you that your girl got a nice box
Everything I do in life is quite wrong
Need an apple a day, so I stole your fuckin' iPod

I'm the kid your parents like to hate
And I'm the kid that girlies like to taste
Yes, I'm the kid that cuts all the lines and shows up late
Everything you got, yeah I got it by mistake
I'm the kid your parents like to hate
And I'm the kid that girlies like to taste
Yes, I'm the kid that cuts all the lines and shows up late
Everything you got, yeah I got it by mistake

I getting it in when I get in the ring
It's a right left to the chin, I side step then I swing
Got two bisexual identical twins
In my ride, dressed up as gimps on a wild ketamine binge
Getting more head than forceps
You get T-bagged for sleepin', I let my balls rest on ya forehead
If you're wondering why I haven't said ""pause"" yet
And presumin' I'm talking about a dude then you're bent
Speakin' at the court hearing naked, with my balls shaven
That's what I call a bald statement
Whole world on my shoulders, didn't think that I could balance it
But it's lighter than you think like Michael Jackson's kids
You don't know where the fuck you been, from Bradford to Melbourne we run this thing
Took your chick to go fuck but the slut just sucked my dick till she bust a lip
Fuck what I said before, I ain't got no money bitch
Girls call me an arsehole 'cause I'm tight as fuck and full of shit

I'm the kid your parents like to hate
And I'm the kid that girlies like to taste
Yes, I'm the kid that cuts all the lines and shows up late
Everything you got, yeah I got it by mistake

Most people wanna say something but it takes 'em a day, you see
I'll tell you 'bout somethin' taken away from me
See I've forgiven people makin' mistakes
But different places they were basically just changing their face
I can't imagine living life with no control
And blocking all feelings in your heart frozen cold
Living fake is something you can't undo
And you've lived it so long that it becomes you
For no reason, all the hate made it so wrong
But you can only hold a brave face for so long
The brave face soon turns into an evil one
It's like the wind changed, took away your peace and fun
Dig deep past the front and you'll start to yell
Shit, I know, yo, it's hard as hell to ask for help
But me, I'm coming with the welcoming mat
Even if you think I'm weak I put myself in a track
See, if I have emotions then I'm coughin' 'em up
Over years and years, you dudes bottle 'em up
There's no wonder you don't hesitate to fight a dude
It's the only way you let out what's inside of you
You can call me weak for having an emotional track
But you're more of a pussy because you're holding it back
You always talk about the bloodshed
The only reason you don't cry, 'cause you don't want your boys to see you're upset
You're scared they'll laugh, taunt and belt you
If they were your real friends they'd fucking help you
Then behind closed doors, you let your dough poor
And let it all out and cry till your throat's sore
See if I'm feeling down like what everyone fears
I'm not afraid to let it out, if anyone hears
If I had the power, I'd change you to the old you
And take away all the people that control you
You're in denial and you're stuck in a binge
You don't think for yourself, you're just a puppet on strings
I know you're insecure, motherfucker, just think
Why else would a song like this get under your skin?

You're so fake (Yeah)
You're so fake (Uh)
You're so fake
Why can't you be yourself? (Why not?)
You're so fake (Ha)
You're so fake (Listen)
You're so fake
You're never gonna be yourself

Uh, yeah
Honestly, fuck taking my time
Yo, I'm after the spotlight and I'm making it mine
And I had the haters claim that I was faking my rhymes
But I've left that shit behind, fuck saying goodbye
Because I love hip-hop but I hate the Australian type
A bunch of meatheads acting all crazy in fights
Yo, I'm brave enough to say what I say on the mic
On some real shit, I'm staying that way till I die
Optimistic and I place all the hate to the side
Hate these days, always patiently waiting inline
I know I shine but it's making me blind
There's heaps of beats to destroy and paper to find
You're all caught in an image, ashamed when you cry
I'd rather cry then have my face imitate a disguise
It's like I'm always being faced with these lines
It ain't my life, but you say that it's mine, I used to take it in stride
Wish I'd talk with Australian pride
But I hate this country, I hate what you like
Superficial, high-strung, pretentious and fake
The fucked thing is 90 percent will never relate

Uh, yeah
Have a think about that one
If you think it's about you then it probably is

And you can step in a ring and you'll be worse off
I ain't religious but I'm ready to serve God
And there be no O.T

And go and get so high that I never land

You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel

If there's no vodka the chronic'll do

Sick of wings in hospitals, dude
In the winter always got my sunny's on
Why's that? 'Cause I haven't slept all summer long

Packing a MAC in the back of an actual Ac'
Like Big Pun, but I'm actually fatter than that

I know it's harsh but you're doing nothing for me
And we were just helping each other out when we were horny (Yep) Don't get me wrong, yo, I really do respect women
But that don't mean that I don't wanna have sex with 'em
You broke the rules though, we had an agreement
From the start we agreed no attachments were needed (Come on)
But I'm the one that's stupid for the fact I believed it
I was about sex, and your attraction was deeper though
We wanted sex though with no strings attached
And you say you love me, what kind of no strings is that?
Yo, I think you're really cool and you know you're mad fine
But to fall in love, yo, I think you picked a bad time (You did)

I couldn't help it, the shit was so wonderful
Never thought that it would be me to be the one to fall (Uh)

The snow falls for so long, you're frozen

Cause I'm sick of just spending our time up
Feel like I'm loosing my head
Viewing the end, 
don't want a funeral yet
Cannot go through it again
Feel like I'm writing the plot of a beautiful death
And they say that, if you love somebody, set them free

Subtle Way of Suicide,What You See Is What You Get,2008,"[Verse 1
Uh, I've spent a lot of time working over the past years
Turning sober, bourbon over the last beer
Intoxicated, contemplating in conversation
Lose my feet, chopping, changing my occupation
Not today though, too many hours choking hard
I finished work at five and head straight to the local bar
With open arms while I'm talking to the mates I see
They ain't my real friends but they suffer the same as me
We just drown our sorrows as we waste our green
Pretend we're having fun but really yo it's make belief
It makes me see as I drink to myself
I'll buy you drinks cause I'd rather that than drink by myself
And I had a dream too
I wanted my passion
But through lack of support I chose a job that's relaxin'
And I regret it now, why not follow my dreams for?
I'm another robot but yo I should have been more

It's just the subtle way of suicide (suicide)
Life ain't worth livin inside this blurred vision
It's just the subtle way of suicide (suicide)
I'm drinking away while sitting in pain
It's just the subtle way of suicide (suicide)
Yeah, I should have been more and work for my dreams more
It's just the subtle way of suicide (suicide)
Yo it's the only way out, uh

Yo, I remember bein' raised on what real life is
I've got a wife, kids, a job and still feel like shit
Yeah I've got a job, but I want more cause who wants
Responsibilities for shit you don't have love for
And even though I chop and change every job's the same
I'm gonna try to raise my kids the way I wasn't raised
And yeah I know I've got a great son
But if I haven't had a happy life then how can I create one?
And in their teens not be ashamed to say they love their dad
And not think of their childhood as something bad
And understand why I'm not something great
It's cause I work in a job for years that I fuckin' hate
I could have been something, had the crazy skills
Now all I work for is drinking it to pay the bills
And for my son if you follow your dreams but die
Don't worry it's the best thing at least you tried
And it's the subtle way of suicide",https://genius.com/360-subtle-way-of-suicide-lyrics
Swim Good,Stand the Fuck Up,2011,"Uh
Yo, yeah

I'm being honest, yo, I think that I'm a good dude
But I have no idea lately what I should do
I just can't believe the test that I've been put
And I just got no choice but to be strong and push through
Had a simple plan, now this shit is different, damn
Unexpected negatives and everything has hit the fan
I wanna run, but I gotta be the bigger man
The shit that's going has me feeling like a little ant
And if you really understood then you would not blame me
And people seeing my success and see I'm complaining
I know my song's played every single day
But apart from all the music everything is going wrong lately
And if you don't know me well then you won't know
I've mastered the art of feeling that I don't show
And don't go and judge my life if you don't know
Half of it is high, but the other half is so low
And music's good, but unfortunately
I've seen a standup family get brought to their knees
Normally he'd  deal with it would talk to a beat
But lately that ain't an option and frankly that is a problem
You see I wanna write these words 'cause it helps
But I can never put it out 'cause it'll hurt someone else
Listen, so the pen is like my psychiatrist
And the music is the only set of wings that I am flying with
It's hard to describe exactly what I get from music
I'd be a fucking nervous wreck if I ever lose it
I've got problems and this shit is therapeutic
I start hitting rock bottom if I never use it
I love life, but honestly I'm stuck
See it's got me in a rut, I wanna run, but that's the worst way
And sometimes it makes you wanna turn to drugs
But the drugs are the reason that it's fucked in the first place

I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit
And swim good, and swim good, good

They got us fighting for control over somebody no one's ever heard of
Swearing on a bible that we don't believe a word of
Too cool for a mentor, there's no one we can learn off
This show's getting too real, I vote that we should turn off
But every channel's the same, reality's changed
You can't tell who's putting on an act for the game
I can't tell if I'm actually sane 'cause people tell me
I'm different when everyone else is exactly the same
Or how even though I'm attracted to fame and people tell me
""Shoot for the stars,"" all I do is practice my aim
So you can say what you want, you can say I'm deceitful
I can say in a song what you can't say to some people
You been keeping up appearances, I was coming on slow
60 tell me ""Tryna get my game on pronto""
I was at the party, off my face on Cointreau
I was tryna party, get my rage on: Rondo
Career had a tag without a name on: John Doe
If they identified it as dead they were wrong though
It ain't a crime, I wanna live clean
Doing what I done best since I was sixteen
I got a small opportunity, a big dream
Tryna see both points of view like a split screen
My ears pinned back, ready for the future
Till I get my cape on and everything is super

I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit
And swim good, and swim good, good

I'm goin' off (Oh, my pretty love)
Don't try stopping me
I'm goin' off (Throw me a line)
Don't try saving (Broke my heart)
No flares (Broke my heart)
No vest (Drove my love)
And no fear
Waves are washin' me out

I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit
And swim good, and swim good, good

Oh no
Don't die, don't die, don't die
Oh no, oh no no
Don't die, don't die, don't die
Oh no
Don't die, don't die, don't die
Oh no, oh no no
Don't die, don't die, don't die",https://genius.com/360-swim-good-lyrics
Take Me For Granted,What You See Is What You Get,2008,"Don't take me for granted
I ain't your fool
Ain't gonna take your shit no more
Said I'm leaving, won't be back home
I tried so many times
So many ways
Don't throw it all away by
Sayin' you love me
You didn't mean it
You just got my heart and left me cold (Uh)

These scattered memories, a list of broken photographs
All the things I wanna know, if I could only ask
It seems always accustomed to have a broken heart
But honestly we both should start admitting that we've grown apart
And in the past years, I've only grown to hating love
'Cause all the beauty is ruled out by the pain in love
And don't get angry when I say that I'm afraid to love
Because you took too much advantage when I gave you trust
And now I try to see it normally and clear in my eyes
But now I can't 'cause of fears and the lies
I try to make it work, but know that really it's died
Every day I'm sitting praying I can feel it alive
For just a split second to taste the feeling of life
'Cause every time it gets remotely close, I feel it's a lie
I try letting down the shield in hope of healing my eyes
Now I'm barred of all emotion, now I'm merely alive
But why?

Don't take me for granted
I ain't your fool
Ain't gonna take your shit no more
Said I'm leaving, won't be back home
I tried so many times
So many ways
Don't throw it all away by

The Ghost Inside,Please Be Seated,2010,"Uh, yeah, Forthwrite
60
P Easy, 
Please Be seated
Yeah

I feel that something inside
Right when you feel there was nothing inside
I know now that it's somethin' this time
Now I feel ready, I got nothing to hide
Yo, it's funny things come when you least expect it
Right when you're just about to reach the exit
And now you're hoping that these people get this
And those who admire will at least respect it
See, a lotta wanna watch you fall
Why the hell they wanna stop you for? You don't have to though
They wanna see you drop the ball
Now they got you thinkin' ""What's it for?"" It doesn't matter though
I write while inside I bleed
Got a hang on every word that your timeline reads
'Cause I'm cool with the life I lead
If you wanna follow suit, yo, it's fine by me

Feel like a star 
I feel like a star tonight
Without warning
We gave up the ghost inside

Yeah, yeah 
I was focused on my destination
While thinking ""I can get there!"" with an exclamation
 all my first attempts to make it
Were just clouded by hesitation
Had to sit down thinkin', find my style
Couldn't fix that quick, had to bide my time, this time I
Won't let that bit of me talk negative
To ensure I never repeat that lesson
Now I won't wait, no way, gotta make my own way
Sometime soon or it's done, I'm through with it
Shit, I'm too close to the finish
To burn out, turn 'round and pack up, are you kidding?
I won't let that happen, no chance, won't even
Think of backtrackin', nah, there's just no time
And I prove it, I can free the ghost in me
I think it's time I start living where I'm sposed to be
Thank god

Feel like a star 
I feel like a star tonight
Without warning
We gave up the ghost inside

The Take Off,Falling & Flying,2011,"Hey yo, it's me myself and I, yeah I'm back again
I played the background watching what's been happening
I never thought, when I was fucking up in school
That this shit would even work, if it doesn't I'll be cool
Even if, for now, I only manage to scrape by
As long as I'm living off of rap, it's a great life
So I'ma take my ways I create this
And take time, cock back and aim at a great height
This is it though, I'd better step forward then
It's a chance to be forever airborne
But I'm never happy with the second best score
While I'm chasing after a dream, I never slept for
Just to get my rap on, talking about whatever I have done
Find believe even when I have none
So fuck it, I'm about to have fun
And not think about this life 'cause we only have one

I'm sorry that I'm so late, yo I slept in
You can't blame me, I was having the best dream
I was watching my life up on the big screen
Had the present on pause, flicking to the next scene
It had me and everybody coming together
Sky high while we're running to heaven
Let me take you to a place where it's summer forever
So there'll be no chance in hell of feeling under the weather
But look, I know that I can be whatever I believe
I keep my feet grounded and bring the sky to me
Most people have grown egos
But it's so see through, I'll show that there's no need too
Even go that route
I did it before, but see I know that now
But see I know it's hard, but I laugh in the face of death
While living life on the edge without a safety net, let's go

Either the sky is falling down
Or that's me flying up again
The sky is falling
I see the sky is falling down
Or they got me going up again
The sky is falling
I'm falling again

See I know that it's a fight to the top
And any other day, yo you're likely to flop
Some lies will arise in your eyes and entice you to stop
But the sky is the prize that I want
And how to show my style and to boast my skill
And I don't know how but I know I will
'Cause I have to be the best
It's win win for me 'cause rap relieves the stress
The industry now is in a big crisis
It's innocently down by these kid pirates
And if you listening now and think this shit's fire
Stop being ignorant now, you think it's sick? Buy it
Uh, I understand if you don't buy it
Supporters need the supporters who go find it
But for now I'ma go fly and
I'm so high that you won't find me so don't try it

Either the sky is falling down
Or that's me flying up again
The sky is falling
I see the sky is falling down
Or they got me going up again
The sky is falling
I'm falling again

'Cause, even when I'm falling, I'm flying
The sky is falling
'Cause, even when I'm falling, I'm flying
I know you're trying call me
Down, down (the sky is falling)
Before the sky can reach the ground

Either the sky is falling down
Or that's me flying up again
The sky is falling
I see the sky is falling down
Or they got me going up again
The sky is falling
I'm falling again

Throw It Away,Falling & Flying,2011,"Hey yo, money makes the world go 'round, we know that
Is it gonna change your life if you own that?
Is it gonna have you high in the sky where you're so glad
Will it just define what you're known as?
While I'm wishing that I had a mint
I'd share it round if I had some riches
See with money though yo it can't bring us happiness
But it will bring the things we'd be happy with (indeed)
While the homeless are begging for some change
There are some who are begging for a change
You disagree, start begging for a change
We need change but everything's the same
I can't be another one running in a rat race
Living in a life where it's all about the cash mate
So forgive me, I'm a go and practice me
'Cause I feel like that's for me so...

I know that it goes on but we don't want to know that
I know that I've been wrong but I don't want to go back
So I throw it, throw it all away
I'll throw it, throw it all away

Yo meet generation yes, we party so much
Got our folks worried that our hearts will blow up
It's funny that we can't say no but
I hope we don't hit it too hard and go nuts
Yo, we will know in time
Man this shit that kills us is why we all feel so alive
And get paid on Friday from working all week then
Forget it all by blowing it on the weekend
And some will say 60 is a fool
The kid's a beginner because he didn't finish school
Yo it wasn't for me mate
Working in the office on weekdays is not what I'll be mate
It ain't 'cause I'm broke that I'm wanting to seek change
I'm a treat this like my job and I'll see pay
So forgive me, maybe it's my lack of sleep
But I feel like I have to dream so

I know that it goes on but we don't wanna know that
I know that I've been wrong but I don't wanna go back
So I throw it, throw it all away
I'll throw it, throw it all away

Hey yo I can't be one of them dudes no more
I ain't gonna be wearing them shoes no more
Won't waste time all for the loot no more
With no idea what I can use it for
Yeah, yo I don't wanna work 'til I'm fifty
And then spent what I've earn't 'til I'm sixty
So forgive me, I know it's got a hold on me
But no way is it controlling me, no

I know that it goes on but we don't wanna know that
I know that I've been wrong but I don't wanna go back
So I throw it, throw it all away
I'll throw it, throw it all away

Tiny Angel,Vintage Modern,2017,"So this story, is about a really close friend of mine
I love you, brother

My mates talk shit about their wives, but I love mine
Yeah we fight sometimes, but ain't that just life?
She’s been pregnant now for some time, it took us years
And enough tries, I thought it wouldn’t happen from my young life
From the drunk times, or when I tried drugs twice
I thought downstairs had gone and messed it up, right
The doctor told me that I need to stop stressin’
The only thing that’s working against us is just time
That was true, two months by
My wife called me up while I was workin' at the pub, right
She told me I was gonna be a daddy
We both broke down, she said there’s something that I done right
I called my mother, told her I was gonna be a father
Mum cried, so did I, I was tongue-tied
I can't explain this feelin' but I love life
I’ve never had a purpose and this had just become mine
To create this little person that’s fun size
A little bit of her, and a little bit of me
But I pray he gets his mum’s eyes
I say he ‘cause I’ve always wanted a son, right
The ultrasound said it's a boy, my little ray of sunshine
It dawned on me, I can’t wait to see my son rise
You know what they say about time though? It does fly
Fast forward nine months and suddenly it’s crunch time
It's been a few days of goin’ through contractions
Gotta stopwatch timin' every moment that it happens
We reached five minutes so it’s hospital time
I call ahead to see the doctors arrive, my wife’s laughin'
Now I properly drive like the cops are behind
But there was barely any traffic so we got there in time
I’m a little scared, but she ain’t got a worry in sight
She’s a warrior, exactly what you want in a wife
It’s been several days of epic pain, every day she wakes up
Finally she's comin’ to that second stage of labour
I sit next to her, squeeze on her hand
Put a sponge up on her head and say, ""Breathe if you can
I love you so much, baby, you’re so strong
I could never do this but you so easily can""
She said the pain is insane like her abdomen’s ruptured
Like someone’s got a knife, and they’re stabbin’ her stomach
She’s like ""We have to do somethin',"" the nurse said, ""It’s natural
Relax, it's just a sign that it’s actually coming""
She’s like ""No, it’s too much, it’s too hard to get out""
I’m sayin’ any words I think’ll help at calmin’ her down
Doctor’s like, ""You’re nearly through the worst part of it now""
Take a look and see my little king is startin’ to crown
They all tellin’ her to push, and she’s screamin’
She’s saying that it hurts, I tell her to keep breathin’
It’s like ‘push’ is the only word that they’ve said now
Then I’m shocked by the massive scream she lets out
The doctor’s like ""Yes, now the head’s out""
And then I watch as he quickly pullin' the rest out
It’s so amazin’ to see my son in the flesh
I can’t help but notice he hasn't taken a breath, now
They put a little plastic thing in his mouth
While the doctor’s two fingers are slightly pumpin’ his chest down
I start panicking, something’s gone wrong
They push me to the side, I can barely see what’s goin’ on
He’s not breathin’, they need to resuscitate him
He’s suffocating, I see that it’s something major, I feel
So helpless, I wish I could come and save him
I pray that my son’ll make it, it’s taking ‘em fuckin’ ages
Everyone’s in shock, I’m just listenin’ in
Holdin’ my breath, wishin’ I could give it to him, fuck
At twenty minutes, now they’re stoppin’
They turn around, they say, ""We’ve lost him""
I’m in shock, I can’t talk
I’m starin’ at the ground, I can’t walk
They hand him to us, can’t believe the size of him
The most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen but there’s no life in him
My wife’s cryin’ like, ""Why aren’t they reviving him?""
I said, ""They tried for twenty minutes"" she’s like, ""Try again""
Now I’m feelin’ like I’m stuck in hell
This is the worst pain I’ve fuckin’ felt
I’ve been ten years clean, but now I’m drunk and on the drugs as well
I’m doin’ anything to numb myself, but nothin’ helps
I believed in God, for that I feel dumb as hell
Can someone please tell God to go and fuck himself?
I’m sorry, yo, it’s hard to be faithful
It's painful, heaven must be runnin’ out of angels
He died from asphyxiation, no air in his lungs
A parent should never have to bury their son
Especially one that’s so precious it has barely begun
That’s one thing in life that should never be done
I prayed for a son, and they blessed me with one
My biggest gift, now his presence is up
And I’m crying at the thought, he won’t ever feel a hug
Or the tenderness of love that he’d be gettin’ from his mum
Sent him from above, but why take him?
It’s like I'm being punished for the negative I’ve done
And it’s killin’ me that Christmas time is barely in a month
So I’m doin’ what I have to do to spend it with my son
(No)

Where did you go?
Are you alone?
How did you get there?
I need you at home

Are you alone?
How did you get there?
I need you at home

Top Billin’ [Freestyle],Loosies,2008,"When I was five, I wanted to fly a starship
Now I'm twenty-five and I can't even drive a car, shit
Ask girls to come back to my apartment
Try to dink 'em on my push bike and I get laughed at
So these days, when I'm askin' out dates
I pick 'em up around eight in the car with L plates
And my mum up in the front seat half an hour late
But nothing much changed, they still laugh in our face
So I'm carvin' out a name
As a rapper 'cause I'll never get a girl without the fame
And plus I'm bored with watching porn and gettin' rope burn
I need a fortune to afford myself a chauffeur
But luckily my flows works and it's so perfect
Even if I rap with no words, it's still a dope verse
Did my homework and pressed myself an EP
Sold three copies, now I'll probably be on TV
Bought myself a big wallet for the profits that I get from it
Then I saw my shit up on a bit torrent
Got pissed off, at least I got some big props
From this kid Koptic when he said my voice was hypnotic
So get on it, go and buy yourself six copies
From the MySpace or download it if you're dishonest
But it's nice if you bought the album, legit
Shit, I could use all the help I can get
I'm so sick of gettin' bouncers at my own sets
Who won't let me in unless I tell 'em that I know PEZ
But that's my own mess that nobody knows Seth
I should probably do shows more and get stoned less
And it's a battle on the road, less traveled
'Cause most heads I know just rappers if they're tone deaf
And that's cool, I got a sing song flow I guess
And you can hear it on the EP that you should go and get
I had a guy that asked me for my autograph
Nah, not really, but that'd be awesome, huh?
So when I say ""Seth""
You say ""who the fuck is that?""
And guess what? Seth's not famous man
Most people know me from my Xbox gamer tag
Yeah, I heard he had a face like a one tonner
Why you think I put artwork on the front cover?
So if you got a friend that loves rhymin'
I got a present, but with better darn prices
Even if you're in a credit card crisis
Buy the shit and I can get my car licence

I don't even get scared in cemeteries
You get scared when you don't know where your teddy bear is
I'm where it started, I'm everything that matters
If the Devil wears Prada then the Devil is a faggot, uh
I’m gettin' in it the minute I start rappin'
I'll hit 'em with sarcasm and kick 'em and laugh at 'em
If you know some sick women, introduce me
Girls love Matt Groening like Simpsons groupies
But I don't like having sexual intercourse
I just like knowin' that my genitals fit in yours
I'll send a message to Biggie Smalls
I can't find my style yet, yeah, you get it? Then gimme yours
I'll win awards for my next release
But won't thank no one in my acceptance speech
And PEZ and me haven't sleep for weeks, Seth can see
But he'll never know if it's meth or speed
To calm me down, you better get some weed (weed)
So I can see time fly through my mind's eye
And if you're talking about the highlights, you're talking about my rhymes
Talk about the high life, talk about my life
At night time, I might just ride by
Saying ""take your fuckin' watch off your wrist because it’s my time""
I'm already high on life
But I get high on ice just to get twice as high
When we're stepping on stage while you're reppin' your train lines
With fans that take time to get their Mexican wave right
I’ll have my Conchord with a built in squash court
And still be complainin' that I want more
And we about to go on tour with Tom York
I know you've heard of us, wait – what’s that song called?
And while you’re standin' in a circle kickin' frees
We're drivin' 'round a park in a perfect limousine

Uh, yeah, you might have heard of Six and me
Yo, it's Forthwrite bitch, the only surfers in the scene
Rockin' tight top shirts and fitted jeans
Listen close to this, it's the only verse you'll get for free
Off one song man I'm earning fifty Gs
While you want a punch on because you're turnin' fifty-three
Fuck the urban city dream
Give me a house in a suburban little street, I prefer to live in peace
I’m killin' shit if you don't know by now
You better turn this off and go find out
I'm not jokin' homie, turn this off and go right now
It's showtime, blow! I'm building up a buzz
So motherfuckin' big that it won't die down
I'm the future, yes I'm in O-nine now and we the captains
See the weaker rappers keep adaptin'
It's easy you can speak to me or Three and see what happens
I can't see the reason half you dudes are even rappin'
You're fuckin' terrible, I'm incomparable to most
'Cause the flow's impeccable it's so
Incredible now everybody knows
I hear raw cliques talk shit about ""The Festival Song""
When they can't even comprehend the fuckin' level I'm on
They can't really even seem to ever pen a good song
Go and listen to the rest of my songs
And come back and we can talk, man I'm leadin' forward
You're just doing things I've already seen before
So I'm not listenin' to it or skippin' on through it
I'm sick of gettin' shit and thinkin' this isn't music
I hear these dudes still preachin' that keep it real shit
Yeah that's what you dudes do, you keep it real shit
I begun, no wonder you people fear shit
Fuckin' hell, I can't even finish that shit

Fuck those cunts man, let 'em be, they're worthless
A bunch of centipedes who would never reach the surface
I'm sendin' dead MCs and enemies in hearses
And dead in beef and every week and never leave the churches
And say that 360's centimetre perfect
But even when I'm off by a centimetre, perfect
And my initials are my destiny, get the letters M and C
Get it, get it's meant to be I'm perfect
Acclaim asked if I fuck heaps of fats
The fact is I lost count, fuck keepin' track
Man, you're probably thinkin' what the fuck beat is that?
But make you forget the beat thinkin' fuck he can rap
Uh, remember the days of basketballin'?
Man, I only rap for kicks 'cause I can't afford 'em
And my sights are as high up as Michael Jordan
Only job I’ll have in my life’s performin'
See you talkin', see you in the afterlife son
You biting many styles 'cause it's hard to find one
But we have that after night fun with these hot tarts
We ain't rockstars but we party like some
Yeah, it seems these days, the topic's swagger
Cool now but don't rule out the subject matter
Stop rappin' I ain't wantin' to hear ya
'Cause people love Sixty's music and ain't talkin' a era, no
We hit up rap with heaps of decent dimes
Who like to lick their fingers just to read between the lines
Rubbing their gums while we're runnin' amok with more
Junk in the trunk than a truck full of drugs to haul
This is do or die, it's either suicide or crucify
You decide, either way, you lose your life
There's a 360 crew but they're spelled different
My name has no letters in the alphabet
I can smell success and man it smells like sex
And so smell it

You know we're comin' live from Triple R
Takin' Aussie rap music on a different path
The kid who spits the sickest bars like it isn't hard
On that breakthrough debut, sittin' in the charts
Another month, I'll be a bigger star than Jimmy Barnes
It's pretty simple, you don't like it, you can kiss my arse
I'm out having rich dinners 'cause I'm livin' large
You're at home drinkin' Vic Bitter, tryna fix ya car
It's a laugh mate you try to call that hip-hop?
Shit, as soon as I turn it on, I just switch off
Even if I just burn it, it's like I'm ripped off
People probably heard it, that's why your shit flopped

I'm pretty certain I'm the laziest person I know
I sit at home in the day with the curtains all closed
Just burnin' a roach, watchin' Murder She Wrote
'Cause I lost the remote and just search for it
So hard I'd rather sit and work for the show
Until it's over then it's Oprah? I prefer a good soap
Shit, I watch commercials and I purchase my phone
And then return it after thirty days, dirty and broke
I gotta leave these burgers alone
'Cause I've almost outgrown the only shirt that I own
Plus, I'm pretty sure that someone burgled my home
(No) I swear I had a girlfriend and some furniture though?
I'm broke dope rapper murder a flow
But it's so much work to go rehearse for a show
Shit, I used to do gigs and freestyle for two minutes
Lose interest and be home in bed before the tune finished
Illusionist at work, I had it good
Just stand in one spot at a job and try to look stressed
Yep, and that's the key to success
Success sucks PEZ, I couldn't give a fuck less
I'm feelin' the ceilin', I'm killin' these tracks
I just write the punchlines and PEZ fills in the gaps
Perhaps it's a fact that if I napped less
I'd have more time to practice and get my raps fresh",https://genius.com/360-top-billin-freestyle-lyrics
Tormented Kid,What You See Is What You Get,2008,"I really—I really do love ya mate. I really love ya. I'm really sorry I hit you all the time. I promise it won't happen anymore. I promise you. This is the last time. I'm so sorry
I don't fucking need you! I hate you! You mean nothing to me! Get out of my fucking face!
This is my house, I will do whatever I want!
Get the fuck out of my way!
Don't tell me what to do! Where do you think you're going?! Get back here! Don't walk away from your father!
 I really do love ya mate. I do. Don't tell me what to do, I own this place! You get out!
I hate you!

He was a young kid, tormented and hurt
His father nearly pushed him to the end of the earth
On his birthday, December the third
That day his dad was drunk, couldn't even remember the birth
And he'd wish he'd go on holidays and never return
His whole body was cut up and severed and burned
Used to wake up shaking with an image of dad's face
And how he use to use his body as an ash tray
No one suspected shit, always acting fake
The kid was forced to smile put on a happy face
He used to try and keep his chin high
If he let an ounce of sadness out, he'd see a fist fly
Teachers asked about the bruising and he'd give lies
A kid's mind with no reasoning to live life
A thin line between hate and depression
If it wasn't with his fist, he'd hit his face with a weapon
The thought of suicide, he'd jump a lake in a second
Without him, his mum wouldn't be safe and protected
He often thought of standing up and fighting back
Was too scared, he knew he'd cop another strike and bash
Except for one day, he came home from school
He was about to leave to a mate's home for pool
He heard screams from upstairs in the bedroom
Mum was yelling but it sounded like sex too
He was raping her, cold blooded and fearless
Nobody was near it and nobody could hear it
And why did they deserve this punishment for?
Then he snapped; he couldn't give a fuck anymore
Then he ran to the room, possessed by a demon
Saw her throat seething and her nose bleeding for no reason
She hobbled down stairs, broken her leg
Poured his gin all over his wife, an emotional wreck
And the kid stood in the doorway, eyes darkened and black
The father was smashed, laughing as he start to attack
He ducked the first swing, it didn't connect
Out of nowhere the dad grabbed the kid at the neck
Squeezing his life away, stared in to his eyes, it rained
He didn't show it hurt, he managed to hide the pain
He sat squeezing and screaming and crying
But the kid let him do it and squeeze it in silence
If he kept going, he would dead him for sure
Then his grip let loose, he flopped next to the floor
And the mum stabbed him in the back with a kitchen knife
Ripped inside screaming in pain, ready to give her life
He saw his mother on the tiles of tears
It was the first time he'd seen his mum smile in years",https://genius.com/360-tormented-kid-lyrics
Trouble,Vintage Modern,2017,"Pray for the love of the children
I pray for the ones that have killed them
I pray, but I don't know who to pray to
Help me to understand

Yeah
It’s like hate’s been popularised
Love turns to hate at the drop of a dime
I’ve seen my own fans crossin’ a line
But if they’re fans of hate, I don’t want ‘em as mine
It’s got me confused, yo, I’m not gonna lie
I've got Muslim friends, they don’t want me to die
They ain’t tryna build a mosque to provide
A place where they can go and build bombs and to hide
Look, a burka is not a disguise
It’s foreign to you, so it’s a shock in your mind
All you need to do is spend some quality time with ‘em
To know they just wanna live a positive life
See, that’s the nature of human kind
In a life they just 
They see a war goin’ on and they wanna survive
And not see their whole family get hospitalised
It’s got ‘em thinkin’ everythin' that Islam is
Where every Muslim's a terrorist, a Jihadist
And every Westerner is a target
But look at ISIS, America is who armed ‘em
And they plantin’ the seed of the fear in the street
So when you see a man with a beard you retreat
Got you scared of a face full hair, but what’s makin’ him
Ain’t what he wears it is really beneath
I understand though, we have to discuss it
All the progress is actually nothin’
We wanna live in peace, but the shit in the middle east
Is still goin’ on where the acts are disgusting
If you ever raise a fact on the subject
All we ever do is attack and get upset
If you wanna evolve and help the problems to solve
Stop bickerin’ and have the discussion
What a joke, people killin’ each other
Over a book, and they suffer a lot for land
I love some of the scriptures, but fuck a religion
‘Cause I’m suddenly thinkin’ that I’m askin’

Why the trouble with God is Man
The trouble with God is Man
Why the trouble with God is Man
The trouble with God
The trouble with God

Yeah, the scriptures are full of lots of knowledge
But I feel like it’s misunderstood
It’s easy to misjudge a book
When people start killin’ in it’s name, then it did nothin’ good
I’m not saying that I’m right at all
I’m just speakin’ my mind, I wish others would
But it grew from a cult to a big brotherhood
Where you do what you’re told though, ‘cause big brother looks
As far as religion’s concerned
I hate to see the innocent's hurt
Hundreds of years of abuse towards kids in a church
And still Islam is considered the worst?
We can’t go back, the damage is done
Compassionate is what we have to become
I don’t blame all the catholics for what was actually done
You don’t taint a whole group for the actions of some
Instead of worshiping a power that’s higher
We need to understand that the power’s inside us
The hours in time are allowed to remind us
Any goodness within you, allow it to guide ya
If I’m wrong, then I trust He’ll forgive
Everything I say comes from love from within
Stop lookin’ down on others who sin
And if you do believe in God, leave the judgement to Him

The trouble with God
The trouble with God
Why the trouble with God is Man
The trouble with God is Man
Why the trouble with God is Man
The trouble with God
The trouble with God

Oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah

What I’m sayin’ isn’t definite, right
I ain’t sayin’ what you fed was a lie
These are the thoughts that I get in my mind
And for me, I just can’t go accept that it’s right
The core to religion’s fundamentally right
And the Bible might work as a general guide
But a story that’s told over centuries
Surely it's eventually gonna get embedded with lies

I just can’t go accept that it’s right
These are the thoughts that I get in my mind
And for me
I just can’t go accept that it’s right
These are the thoughts that I get in my mind
And for me",https://genius.com/360-trouble-lyrics
Unborn Child,Loosies,2014,"Lock me away for a while
I'll be your unborn child
Lock me away
I wanna start again, start again

Yeah, I've done stupid shit that I need to make up for
Your biggest nightmare can be your biggest wake up call
And I'm lucky I ain't still poor this life is what I'd kill for
Thought I got everything off my chest but there's still more
I'd change a lot of shit if I had time again
The price of fame is costin' me the life I crave
I can't believe these girls who wanna fuck me
When they know I got a girlfriend it honestly disgusts me
I bet before the fame they probably would of judged me
If I wasn't 360 then they wouldn't even touch me
All this substance abuse is so disgusting
I get over one thing then another drug gets subbed in
Went from a drunk kid to being a drug pig
Tellin' people that I'm clean, What a fuckwit!
Look at this random chick actin' like she knows me well
I'm sorry sweetheart, but I don't even know myself

Lock me away for a while

Now all I want in Australia is a private life
To leave my house and not be seen, I need the right disguise
Sunnies to hide my eye and a scarf to cover the tats
I'm so anxious, fuckin' relax
See me and  are done for sure
Stop askin' why is it, yo it's my business and it's none of yours
These little kids were so hopeful about us
I guess it's my fault for being open about it
It was hard for a while but I've moved on dude
But now both her and the public need to move on too
Now word on the street, she fuckin' an MC that I know
A dude I thought was my mate but needless to show
That even though I helped him get a name and feet on the road
I'm happy either way as long as she leaves me alone
Yeah, now look at these kids actin' like they know me well
I'm sorry motherfuckers, I don't even know myself

Understand For Me,What You See Is What You Get,2008,"Uh, uh
Yeah
Yo
Yep, uh

I was sent below, followin’ an endless road
Progression slow, but I’d rather that than never know
A lot of small things I feel I need to question though
And I know I’ll be better if I let ‘em go
I think back on which lesson to quote
But I can’t, can’t seem to remember the notes
And every second I hope to see a memory float
I’m in a bottomless pit so please send me a rope
I hate fakin’, the pain’s taking control
Try to tell the difference between my brain and my soul
To confront the emotions I feel
I hope and appeal to understand devotion is real to myself
Any odd pain, I turn and run
Every day I’m hopin' and prayin’ that my purpose comes
Will I make it in this earth as one?
Please be up front, ‘cause false hopes are worse than none, yeah

I’ve got that ex-psyche ward type mind
Scribe rhymes on the type writes, tryna find a kind of finite
Answer, which is kinda like a phantom
Its presence can be felt but it can’t be physically fathomed
Shit, I've been to the maddest spaces in my imagination's atlas
Travelin' places for affirmation, a axis
But all I ever really found was understanding
Understanding that I could never quite understand it
I mean all of this, all of this in front of us
How could we ever try to comprehend the point of it?
Even if we figured it out, wouldn’t it be kinda spoilin’ it?
Then in the end we would really be missin’ the point of it
So I’m just avoidin’ it, you know, all these questions
I’ve been there, I’ve asked that, too much time invested in it
Guess my questions are in the form of raps and a beat
Not to figure it out for you, but to understand it for me

I don’t know why we walk this Earth
But I’m tryna understand for me
I don’t know why we walk this Earth
But I’m tryna understand
I don’t know why we walk this Earth
But I’m tryna understand for me
I don’t know why we walk this Earth
But I’m tryna understand

Take it back to the days when I wasn’t quite all there
Let you know where I got the ex-psyche ward stare
A time where my various personalities were all there
And they were all scared, yeah, a mind for the warfare
Found myself in a white room wearin’ all white robes
Never woulda been on this road if I'd have known
Spending all night alone, heavy crying and chokin'
Seemed like fire but  that I was smilin’ and copin'
But my soul was shut like, like Charlton Heston's heart
Now my head’s lookin’ like a big fuckin’ question mark
 so many times, I forget, where’s the start?
Your remedies pass full of the most dreadfulest scars
But it took an experience like that (Yeah) to understand
The fact that I’m alive is what I’ve come to thank
So if you need to question the truth, keep doing what you do (Yeah)
Not to figure it out for me, but to understand it for you

Yo, I live in the present, feet embedded and I’m standin’ my ground
It might never be evident but, man, dammit, I’m proud
To stand in the clouds and show the world exactly what I’ve grown to be
Flaunt the inside of feelings that are known to me
I hope to see my mission's finished and refined
To the perfect expectations livin’ in this life
Innocence combined with an easily changed belief
Keep it the same and don’t just leave it as tainted dreams
There’s endless time for you to send a cry for help
But try and recognise and identify yourself
With substance, meaning and a purpose to grow
When you’re truly content, well then the curtains will close
And then it’s over, completed it’ll help you to fight
I can’t tell you the price for my value for life
I held on and strived to be a man, happy and attached with pride
Unearthin’ in the deepest me, then I’m satisfied
Huh, yeah, yeah, yeah

(Understand the way)
I try and understand how it all works
I try and understand how it all works (Understand the way) Uh, uh
I try and understand how it all works
I try and understand how it all works (Understand the way) But we'll never know
I try and understand how it all works
I try and understand how it all works (Understand the way) So let it go

I don’t know why we walk this Earth
But I’m tryna understand for me (Understand the way)
I don’t know why we walk this Earth
But I’m tryna understand (Understand the way)
I don’t know why we walk this Earth

You had a good thing goin’, look at this life of yours
Yo, we’ve lost the plot, what are we fightin’ for?
We need to come together, but they divide us more
I’ve been at rock bottom, it’s cold and nothin’s there
I know you must be scared but it’s only up from here
It’s time to knuckle down and get a handle on it though
‘Cause anytime you fail that becomes a chance for you to grow
Make the hatred that you hear from your Satan disappear
From that devil on your shoulder to an angel in your ear

When they say dream on, that’s exactly what you fuckin’ do

I hope things will come

Shake off  that dust now, what you once had you'll get it back
Never thinkin' what you coulda been, what you shoulda been
'Cause you never listened when they told you what you couldn't be

And when you reach the top don't be frightened to fall
You can't believe it while you're speechless at the height of it all
Don't be afraid, just admire it more, you found a way out

What I Need,What You See Is What You Get,2008,"Slow it down

Uh, I'm here to talk about love
A certain feeling when you walk with a buzz
Can't stop thinkin' 'bout the person, yo, it's more than enough
I'll be upfront, I'm kind of scared of falling in love
It's the falling part, I'm scared of being caught and then stuck
Inside of her mind kind of design with no control
Walking in with everything and leaving with a broken soul
All hope's revolve around you try to see in hindsight
Nothing else matters now, it seems you got a blinded mind
I try to find the right girl in the right time
I need to breath and proceed to read the right signs
Where's the guidelines? I need some sort of help for now
I speak to anyone who thinks that they can help me out
I've held it out in front, I'm feeling kind of guilty though
That if I didn't change my ways it woulda killed me slowly
My shields up 'cause real love conceals me
And when she knows the real me whether she'll really feel me

All these words might be hard for you to see
It's honesty, what I really need for me
It's all real what I need in her to be
And this song in itself sums up exactly what I need

It took me years to reach the level where I'm at
That confused way of thinking, yo, I'll never get it back
And you've got years to grow, I know it takes time
But I can't be your boyfriend and your teacher at the same time
'Cause I need you on the same level I'm at
'Cause where I'm at now my brain's at a climax
And why's that? 'Cause I learnt to love my own company
And underneath my blood I've got a lot of love for me
Your physical's good if were bumpin' for the night
But what turns me on is if you're doing something with your life
'Cause I'm gonna wanna chick who's ambitious
Passionate too and who sticks to plans, listens
And got her shit together and she's hardly in need
Open honesty, always wears her heart on her sleeve
And that's it, when you find yourself you'll find me
But this song in itself sums up exactly what I need

All these words might be hard for you to see
It's honesty, what I really need for me
It's all real what I need in her to be
And this song in itself sums up exactly what I need

I know it ain't easy to say ya need me
Believe me, I'm gonna be pushed away if you needy
Need and want, they're two separate identities
But now you're in a state where you'll go and try anythin'
To be around me, can't be alone by yourself
Don't rely on me though, because I won't be your help
That's not harsh, I'm actually helping you in the long run
But once you found your feet you'll go and get that job done
But that don't mean that I'll never be around
'Cause I'm here whenever I can, whenever you be down
But if I'm the only thing that can pick you up
I can't have that pressure whenever all of this shit gets tough
You gotta sort all your own shit out first
Work it out yourself when you're feelin' like an outburst
This song's here and it's out to help
But know you'll find me once you've found yourself
It shows

All these words might be hard for you to see
It's honesty, what I really need for me
It's all real what I need in her to be

What you see is what you get now

Hey yo, I try to find a common ground
And I sprint from the start while everyone else is joggin' out
And yo, I got the right plan with a nice fam
All I need is a mic stand in my right hand
I'll do it myself, no need for a hype man
I'm never stoppin', spread my wings in this life span
And I think, as I stare at the sky
""60's not a hip-hop stereotype""
And I dress well, not a derelict guy
For my views, yo, I'm ready to fight
'Cause I always hear the same dudes every year, rapping next to us
The same crew from back then with added extras
And yo, I wanna be part of a scene
But not a part of this scene that needs to part at the seams
You start to believe that I harness the dream
60 ain't my real name but, regardless, it's me

What you're seeing is what you get now

Every day, you effect the air and breath you take
And definitive days when your friends are fake
(Nah, I try) I think of what helps
And then uh, sometimes, you gotta think of yourself
But maybe is that selfish? Or maybe not
Maybe we can decipher what made the plot
People forever tryin' to take your spot
If you don't let them, then you're safer
What I wanna do is bring the musical raps
So you know you'll enjoy when you're choosin' a track
In this life, yo, I try to be the odd one out
'Cause you know all the rest you forgot about, let's be honest now

What you're seeing is what you get now

I’ll never let myself fall or step down

I'll stand my ground and I won’t be left out
And I'm never stoppin' until I just make you see
What you see is what you get now

Uh, I won't apologise, I dress to impress
'Cause deep down, I'm an approachable, respectable head
You should never forget that I plan to be sincere
'Cause I wanna make the music that my family can hear (ye-yeah)
While turnin' the page, I'm learnin' that hate
Is workin' a stage and cursin' 'til you're certain to break
And I'll sing my favourite song to people who don't know
I'm gettin' hated on for smiling in photos
And, whether rockin' thongs or wearing kicks
I'd rather look porno than dress a bit like a derelict
Because I don't want chicks thinking I'm hardcore
I'd rather have 'em see my face in their heart's core
You want more? You want me to keep going?
While rocking the beats, knowing that honest MCs know him
It's not a disease, no, I'm just on top of my feet
I'm getting dissed but coppin' it sweet, hopin' for more

What you're seeing is what you get now
I'll stand my ground and I won’t be left out
I still believe in myself to get proud
I’ll never let myself fall or step down
What you're seeing is what you get now
I'll stand my ground and I won’t be left out
And I'm never stoppin' until I just make you see
What you see is what you get now",https://genius.com/360-what-you-see-is-what-you-get-lyrics
White Lies,Vintage Modern,2017,"Yeah
I am naturally gifted and they hate that (they do)
I’m attracted to women, homie, straight facts (facts)
Woke up one mornin’ with a face tat'
Looked in the mirror like “Damn, I can’t replace that”
I got a multiple question before you take me home
Be honest with me, what’s your favourite show on cable though?
The Wire
, 
Walking Dead
, 
Breaking Bad
 or 
Game of Thrones
?
If none of the above, bitch, turn around and take me home (U-ey)
I like when asses are big, it makes it harder to grip
I know that karma’s a bitch but she got marvellous tits
My career nothin’ but net, yeah, but it’s hardly a swish
Boy, you’re in over your head, homie, you’re garglin’
Piss, yeah, there’s nothin’ that I’m scared of
This is everyday shit, never been in rare form (never)
Walkin' round tellin' everyone that I'm in the Air Force (yup)
But they never seem to let it fly at the airport
I was the loosest, they will never not remember (uh)
Goin' out on a limb like gettin' legless on a bender
When it comes to rappers, dog, I'm the softest one out (truth)
I'm the type to shadow-box and get knocked the fuck out
I was the bright-eyed finite
In my prime time livin' life like this shit'd never skydive (breath)
A white guy tellin' all these people white lies
Like I wasn't chillin' where the white lies

Here’s to them white lies
Oh, to them white lies
Ooooo, baby, take my
All, ooh
Here’s to them white lies
Oh, to them white lies
Ooooo, baby, take my
All

Uh, I love fashion but these hat fads
Went from fitted's to snapbacks to rockin' a fuckin' lad hat
Now everybody just walkin' around in dad caps
And all I wanna see's a legionnaires with a back flap (I do)
Yeah, I'm back, bitch (yep), I'm on that rap shit
I'm here to tell 'em that the fact is
That you can't have a foot fetish with anybody who's not good (why?)
There's nothing worse than gettin' off on the wrong foot (oh)
All my organs are weapons of mass destruction
I told my girl, she reckons that that's disgustin'
I got fire arms and a fuckin' missile toe ()
But I get more screams when I use my fingers though
Yeah, that's pretty gross, yeah, that's sorta wrong
Yeah, that's just the level that I'm talkin' on
I got a small dick and foreskin that's sorta long
When I take a piss it's like I'm fillin' up a water bomb (Gross cunt)
All the shit I did on drugs as a little cunt
I set fire to my pubes, it was lit as fuck (It's lit!)
And why is Snow White? (why?) 'Cause the winter came
I'd say danger's my middle name but, yo, the shit is James
I am L with a bit of Wayne, Drizzy
With a little Jay, a bit of Ma$e, Biggie, with a smidge of Ye (settle down, mate)
Honest guys, I don't wanna fight wit'cha
Got the flow on fire like the Condamine river

Here’s to them white lies
Oh, to them white lies
Ooooo, baby, take my

Here’s to them white lies
Oh, to them white lies
Ooooo, baby, take my

I know it seems lately I get my ramble on
Fuck this bipolar shit that I have landed on
But with the right medicine and right therapy
It's made it somethin' that I'm managin' to get a handle on
Depends on the plane that you travel on
You can't handle the baggage, how the fuck can you carry on?
And deep down, yo, I can be strong
But the best way to do it though is go and get my rappin' on
Always doin' shit that I prob'ly shouldn't
On the dance floor three-oh never lost his footin'
Goin' HAM like ""He's the man, like goddamn""
When I dance like Neo when he's dodgin' bullets (believe that)
I could screenshot DM's and horrify Twitter
That girl out her mind, I don't wanna fight wit' her (Nope!)
But this male package is gettin' me fed x's
More than a woman who's endin' a text message
Kiss, hug, bae",https://genius.com/360-white-lies-lyrics
Witness,Vintage Modern,2017,"I keep tellin' 'em ""As God as my witness
Who I'm runnin' with is none of your business""
'Cause fuck it, I'm the same as you
I can't wait until I'm free of ya
I keep tellin' 'em ""As God as my witness
I'll be damned if I'ma pray for forgiveness""
'Cause fuck it, I'm the same as you
The same demons I am facin' too

Same God, same boy
Same whispers in my ear
Fuck it, I'm the same as you
The same demons I am facin' too

I wish my grandpa could see me now
I wonder, would he be disgusted? Would he be proud?
It ain't about the choices that you shouldn't've made
It's about what you did when they couldn't been made
See I'm dancin' with the devil, one foot in the grave
The eyes are windows to your soul, take a look at my pain
It's all about the risks that you lookin' to take
And fuck what anybody says, yo, it's good to be brave
Focus on the positives, don't look at mistakes
I shoulda been a failure if you look at my grades, ayy
Feel that inner zen, in a sense
Innocence is just a lack of inner sense, mmm
I don't rate success in the numbers I am paid
I rate it from people just tellin' me their lives were saved
Wasn't the person the media would try to paint
Haters read the headlines, fans read the entire page

""God as my witness
I'll be damned if I'ma pray for forgiveness""
'Cause fuck it, I'm the same as you
The same demons I am facin' too

Same God, same boy
Same whispers in my ear
Fuck it, I'm the same as you
The same demons I am facin' too
Same God, same boy
Same whispers in my ear
Fuck it, I'm the same as you
The same demons I am facin' too

Yo
There's a monster growin' in me, and I have to feed it
The last one to go, the others though I have defeated
I'm self-destructive, perhaps I need it
I know deep down I gotta do everything that I can do beat it
I don't have the key, it's locked away deep inside
My chest in a place I hate goin' so I have to leave it
I don't know if I ever can gather the strength
To grab it and face up to it and get my hand to reach it
Every time I just lose my fuckin' mind
Whilst it stands over me again and again and I'm trapped beneath it
So maybe I never can and that's the reason
I portray this image of a better man when I haven't been him
It goes back to when I was a child
Life is meant to be all smiles
Instead it took away my innocence, where everything in life
Became negative and ever since it I keep tellin' 'em
""As God as my witness""

Same God, same boy
Same whispers in my ear
Fuck it, I'm the same as you
The same demons I am facin' too
Same God, same boy
Same whispers in my ear
Fuck it, I'm the same as you
The same demons I am facin' too",https://genius.com/360-witness-lyrics
Woah!,What You See Is What You Get,2008,"Woah! (Forthwrite) That's what people say when they see us. It's like, ""Woah!"" (360 and PEZ) Like a rude awakening. Like a massive shock. Like, ""Woah!""
[Verse 1: 360 & 
PEZ
]
Hey yo, we kind of stand out of a crowd, yeah, you notice this
Only ice that I try to smoke is the frozen shit (Uh)
If you think I'm gonna pass blame you silly son
Only finger that I'm ever pointing is the middle one
Now I'm talking in a little conversation
There's a crowd so just switch off your patience
Now raise up your hands, we making a stand
Hold 'em up and wave, just wave, wave
You know were better than the norm and if you question it you're gone
So just believe it and leave all of that aggression at the door
All who even entering the place know
That we're real rapper nice, so just chill back and vibe a little bit
You might sit, sipping on your wine
But I get sick of just sitting in one position for the night
So I like to move and find my mood
Just wave your hands side to side if you like this groove
It's like that, now back to the matter at hand
If you're an arrogant fan then get to clapping your hands
And go crazy, don't do it any other way
The party's right now, now everybody say

Woah! Everybody going sick in the crowd
You all know what we're singing about, just get loud
Woah! Make the place jump, go and turn the bass up
If you wanna raise up, everybody say ""Woah!""
Woah! Everybody going sick in the crowd
You all know what we're singing about, just get loud
Woah! Make the place jump, go and turn the bass up
If you wanna party then throw your hands up high
[Verse 2: 360 & 
PEZ
]
Yeah, 60's in the house
While I'm kickin' this rhythm at all the kiddies sitting down (Yep)
If you be drinking it go and stick it in your mouth
Even if it's nearly full then you're finishing it now, 
yeah
Fans 
chant
  light the fuse
If you can't 
dance
, damn, man, buy some booze
And clap hands 
from the grandstand
, riot too
Make this show wild enough to hit the nightly news
On Channel 9 and 2, and then on 7 and 10
Until every regular resident reckons that it's repetitive
 (What?)
You know the game when you got fame on your mind
I'm tryna get myself a plane so I can take it and fly
Away to the sky and write, ""Yo, I made it"" in white
With my name next to it, yeah, my aim is to try
And get so famous I can go places
And get my own waitress even when they have no waiters
 here
And now we switching back the flow while we bringing it back
Making music that we love, I'll be singing a track
And anybody get around with a plan to diss us
Rock up late, have you saying, ""Damn, you missed us""

Woah! Everybody going sick in the crowd
You all know what we're singing about, just get loud
Woah! Make the place jump, go and turn the bass up
If you wanna raise up, everybody say ""Woah!""
Woah! Everybody going sick in the crowd
You all know what we're singing about, just get loud
Woah! Make the place jump, go and turn the bass up
If you wanna party then bounce, woah!

Words I Never Said,Stand the Fuck Up,2011,"It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said

Yeah
This is more than music, it's a way of life
You can call it stupid, you can hate it, right?
This is not some torture, this is self-inflection
It's what happens when you scream and no one else is listening
This is ugly, this is tasteless, this is imperfection
It's adultery, this is hatred, this is indiscretion
This ain't David Blaine, this isn't misdirection
The music is the drug, the lyrics are the intervention
This is placebo effect, man, this is Panadol
It's free falling, no, shoot down that rabbit hole
It's the equivalent of TEC's guns, lock and load
It's the epitome of sex, drugs, rock and roll
It's your deepest fear, unbearable to think of
It's what I see when I'm staring at a ink blot
This is my brain, my eyes, this is my spinal chord
This is my state of mind, this is my life support
This is the truth underneath all the lies, but they know
That they fall deeper and deeper the higher they go
And even though you're on the edge an' you're tryna say no
You end up right back here, so might as well just let go

It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said

Yeah, with this I can reach a higher state
But without it, I'm fucked up and wide awake
I can't handle thinking anyone's above it
Can't even live until everybody loves it
And now I've gone and found the rules that I live and die with
Found myself tryna fight those who criticise it
Try to prove what it meant when they'd simplify it
To realise that I'm the one I'm in the fight with
Because I don't need this
But if I'm happy with myself, then they won't mean shit
I drop names so I might see some repercussions
I'm being honest though, so if they get offended; fuck 'em
I'm not a fighter; I'm a lover, mate
But if you are standing in my way then I'ma bite you in ya fucking face
Wait, 'cause that ain't even a threat at all
I'm just never stopping in this shit that I was destined for

It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said
Never said
I can't back the words I never said

A gift can be curse, a talent can be a burden
Could mine be one of those talents that's never hearda'?
Just another echo in a hallway full of has-beens?
Just another rapper who will always be the last in
Line? You get my piece hungry, like my last meal
But forget my priest, look
I ain't dying, I'm fighting to live
The only real fight that I gotta win is the fight in my head
And such is life, Cay-sa-ra-sa-rah mafucker
I'm on my grind mafucker, and such is life
For us generation F.L.Y
So stay tuned, the revolution gon' be televised
In the comfort of ya living room, watching us falling
Fly and find out what a mafucking milli' do
Yeah, so we'll see you when we touch down
Matter fact, fuck that, we ain't gonna come down

It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said",https://genius.com/360-words-i-never-said-lyrics
Yesterday,Vintage Modern,2017,"Yesterday I said my
Prayer for you
Now I feel that I
Won't be by your side
Yesterday I said my
Prayer for you
When I realised
This is my goodbye

Yeah, have you ever been dogged
By a best mate or even by a friend that you got?
Well, you been gettin' 'em wrong
They put a knife in your back to get ahead in their job
You been definitely gettin' 'em wrong
All this hatred, where the hell have they been gettin' it from?
Every time you succeed like you're settin' 'em off
It's like your life is somethin' that they're envious of
Don't get jelly when they win though
Anytime they're killin', go and cheer for 'em
Don't be happy when they get low
Hit 'em up and let 'em know you're here for 'em
Throwin' hands what you're gettin' ready for
Never been a friendship where there's never any flaws
In the rulebook there's forever been a clause:
'Never bring a life down just to get ahead in yours'
Yo, tell 'em

Yesterday I said my
Prayer for you
Now I feel that I
Won't be by your side
Yesterday I said my
Prayer for you (said my prayer for you)
When I realised
This is my goodbye

I feel that I
Realised
My goodbye
Is goodbye

Yeah, I know it hurts to get backstabbed
Your first reaction, you wanna go and stab back
It doesn't work, there's nothin' worse
It's undeserved, now they're spreadin' lies and it fuckin' hurts
They prob'ly did it out of vanity
What's killin', they were meant to be your family
The shit'll burn, but give 'em worse
Live and learn, swallow your pride and be the bigger person
That's the problem with friendly competition
Only gonna end as opposition
You don't ever wanna get in that position
Tell 'em but they never gonna listen
Yeah, if you do that's some shit that you'll regret it
Either isn't gonna end well or isn't gonna end
Forgive 'em, start wishin' 'em the best
'Cause while they prayin' that you fail, go and hit 'em with success
And kill 'em

You gotta know, you gotta know
How you've betrayed me
And you oughta know, you oughta know
I hope you make it
Until you grow, until you grow
Out of this hatred
You'll never know, you'll never know
Until you change it

Yesterday I said my
Prayer for you
Now I feel that I (feel that I)
Won't be by your side (by your side)
Yesterday I said my
Prayer for you (said my prayer for you)
When I realised
This is my goodbye

I feel that I
Realise

You And I,Utopia,2014,"When I was young I bought two wings
Then I got myself airborne
Felt the rush of this new thing
The only thing that I cared for
Would've never of guessed it
So strong I don't get affected
Doesn't matter if you never get it
Levels ahead, but stay level headed
Spent years in the sky
Lucky that I'm here and alive
Cause' that come down when you touch down
You fear for your life
Hadda really decide
Get on course and then steer to the light
In the sky for so long
It'll make it a little unclear in your mind

Ain't no you and me, baby life goes on
Uuuu—uu—uuu—uuuu—uuu—uu—uu
Never speak again
Say goodbye, so long
Uuuu—uu—uuu—uuuu—uuu—uu—uu

Found a way that I'll open doors
Now I know that I'll grow for sure
See it'll open my mind;
Take a second, let it open yours
Had you here with me for so damn long
But now I am a new me
And now i know that's what I needed
I don't want to ramble on
But I let go of everything
That I never had a handle on
Check the cloud that I landed on
What the hell are you waiting for?
Tell me something you're praying for
Say the things that you're grateful for
Feel it coming and wait for more

Ain't no you and me, baby life goes on

Is it real or what?
Eyes closed, I feel the buzz
I'm knowin' where freedom's from
Mind open and clear as fuck
I was feeling stuck
Now I don't need no drug
Eyes closed so it doesn't matter
Life's shown me what really does
Never felt love like that
Now I'm sending the love right back
I hit rock bottom
Shake it off and just come right back
I ain't chasing the rush I had
Yo, I'm cool with the rush I have
All it took was a little bit of time
And a little bit of pain and just like that

Ain't no you and me, baby life goes on

Never speak again
Say goodbye, so long
