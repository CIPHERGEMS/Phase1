Fire,Fire,2015,":
Yo I cook that right up in my basement
Make your bitch go ape shit
While you be feeling vacant
I'm a sex pistol, boy
Bang my bullet into who I want
Ooze dirty rotten but he vicious if a punk wanna start him up
Oh fuck I love to run amok
That's why in school I always flunked
But now my jobs to stand in front
Of a packed house and make 'em jump
Like I be Kris Kross, like I'm House of Pain
Like Busta Rhymes, like DJ Kool
If y'all motherfuckers didn't know me
Then I'm gonna show you how I overrule
On point like that damn decimal
While I'm grabbing on my genitals
And yes bitch they're fucking edible
So after this, we'll get flexible
I got what you want, I got what you need
So let's begin this stampede
Wait we playing Jumanji
Nah just smoked too much weed
:
I love to get higher, oh I can be your supplier
See I got what you require when it comes to your desire
I be that hyper, nicer, live wire, power voice like twenty choirs, fresh attire
I'm like Springfield tyres
 x4
I bring the fucking fire

Bump, bump, bump this shit
Get my people in the back door quick
We cause havoc
Never ever gonna stop this shit
Always let loose 'til the belt fit
I spit that lava which
Melt another rapper like the Wicked Witch
Turn a rich girl to the baddest bitch
Make her suck dick in a nurse outfit
Uzi's sick
See these lames all sound the same
What do they hope to attain
Biting Drake
They biting Wayne
Bite anyone with current fame
But the thing about me, I'm original
And for this rap game yeah that's a miracle
And artists fucking hate it
But at my pinnacle
The love they'll give will seem unconditional
Oh, so you wanna know about my dope flow?
From here to Tokyo they call me Godzilla
Cause Ivan much iller
Monster walking through streets
Blue power beams gleam
When i un-clench my teeth
I roar rap, I soar
But leave many listeners craving for more
I ignore little fucking bad sports
Shit in 2 years you'll be my supports
You better watch what you say
Hope you comprende
Cause I know a few goons
From another platoon
That won't let you see your next birthday
Ey, ey, ey, I gotta get it
Shredding like I'm Eddie Vedder
And sever any competitor
Cause they ain't nothing et cetera
Never regular
I'm always better amongst a nebular
Got a little letter messenger
I bring that fucking fire
 x3
I bring that fucking fire
 x4
I bring the fucking fire (fire)",https://genius.com/Ivan-ooze-fire-lyrics

You feel the whole world be your nemesis
I know one way to reap benefits
Mask it up
Forever, forever ever, forever ever?
I never say never, but I never say much
Collect dirty cheddar then I send it in a letter
To my mother motherfucker, just to get her through the winter

Baby mama screamin' she broke
Car dealer need that note

District 9,The Social Alien Mixtape,2015,"I got that, smooth shit, all up in ya mouth like a tooth pick
Tune girls tight like acoustic
Who's sick, got that bang bang music
Fuck therapeutic, Uzi just loose it
Growing on you dickheads like fungus
Changing up judgements, bringing more ruckus
Check ya compass, I'm the right direction
That beast from the east, gaining all that attention
But I ain't cocky no no
Got a dynamo flow, on audio
Hypnotic like a row of falling dominoes
You know my manifesto when it comes to hoes
I fuck em, feed em then leave 'em
Maybe keep one cuddled for the winter season
No drama, more marijuana, spitting with iguanas
Over fruity loops, man thatâ€™s bananas

I'm outta my mind, yeah man, I'm outta my mind
I'ma alien god damn, you can catch me at district 9
I'm outta my mind, I'm outta my mind, yeah man, I'm outta my mind
I'ma alien god damn, you can catch me at district 9
I'm outta my mind

Yeah this that shit
Biggidy Bumpin' out a Cadillac
Smoked out, smoke bomb, window cracked
Slow reactions from the ziggidy zags
Ziggidy zags, iddy biddy drags, mind lagged out
On route, gotta gotta get to that house
Gotta gotta get up in a blouse, arouse a south mouth
Pound it down like a porterhouse
One to many swigs of the 151
Yum rum in my tum tum, come get some
Fee-fi-fo-fum, feeling very large son
Little precaution, please watch my tongue
Smart ass, ever since class
Yelling obscenities behind glass
Undoing bras, yeah a little bastard
But who the fuck else gonna make you laugh

Jimi Hendrix,The Social Alien Mixtape,2015,"This weed got me looking Asian
Hit me harder than a hurricane
I been running on this pain like an ankle sprain
Bullshit holding the wheel, driving me insane
Okay, feeling little relaxed now
Little reefer it be helping me out, roll that shit no doubt
I can feel it flowing up my snout
Smoke forming rings out my mouth, Look like a wolf when he howl, 
Oooooo, life much better
When you relieve pressure, so you spend a little cheddar
Get the bag of weed, invite a friend indeed
Blow trees in the winter breeze, seize that
Need to please, utilize the substance
Comfort the adjustments, bring it all to justice
Hold that joint right up to sky
And show these fuckers how you getting by, this is the reason to why

I used to look up to Jimi, used to listen to Marley
Teen influences have me doing DUI's
Baby why I like to get high
Spark the joint, baby give it a try
And you just smoke that, toke that, up in the air
Yeah, I smoke that, toke that, up in the air
Smoke that, toke that, up in the air
Mind becomes so clear, oh so clear

Eyes red, lounging by the bed spread
Equip the headset, spark another red head
Sliding by, high, dread head on a bobsled
Cool Running's mother fucker, I ain't even dead yet
Was upset, in debt, laced a cigarette
Now I forget my threats, and thoughts I regret
Little space cadet, never hurt nobody
My silhouettes the only dark image, radiating do you copy?
Houston we don't have no problem
Blue didn't solve them, Mr. Green got to the bottom
It was Ivan with the scissors, in the bedroom
Gloom and doom evaporated from these fumes that bloom
My face got craters like moons, a self conscious buffoon
Yet when I'm blow sticky monsoons, I sing a different tune
So come and chief with me, share this leaf with me
And enjoy life ever so peacefully

I used to look up to Jimi, used to listen to Marley
Teen influences have me doing DUI's
Baby why I like to get high
Spark the joint, baby give it a try
And you just smoke that, toke that, up in the air
Yeah, I smoke that, toke that, up in the air
Smoke that, toke that, up in the air
Mind becomes so clear, oh so clear

And your mind becomes so clear
Oh so clear",https://genius.com/Ivan-ooze-jimi-hendrix-lyrics
Eroc,The Social Alien Mixtape,2015,"(Bratttt) Highjack this track, how the fuck are you gonna react
When these trap fiends stream this crack, hit those veins, cardiac
Bag and tag, this Ebola contagious, Zombies surround these stages
Feeding off earthquake vibrations, enables their elevation
Uh uh uh, getting higher, bring that fire
Put them pills up in my mouth and suck my dick until I'm tired
I don't give a fuck about no ho, no no no, if she wanna go slow, no no go go
Get buck like a rodeo, till I blow, now her head be swimmin' like vertigo
And oh shit, Oh god, she keeping my cock hard
She slurping, teasing, give me a reason to not hit it raw
My tongue all up in her clitoris and I be speaking that Arabic
You fucking nothing, you celibate and I'm insane, where's my therapist
I'm chill, drop that Xanax, brains mechanics, in a panic
Eyes erratic, reaping havoc, breathing deeper, so asthmatic
Am I gonna die, I'm flying, intergalactic, feeling like 2pacs      holographic
Feeling like Diddy rubbing fur fabric, this cocktail bring a whole new magic
Faded, sedated 'n' situated on earth
Deactivated reality, activated rebirth
Nor for the better or worse, just wanted to feel diverse
And stamp my feet down on this universes turf till it burst

You now fucking with the I-V-A-N double O-Z-E
R dot L dot G R I M E, who this be?
Burn this house down to debris, ain't no fancy jamboree
Place looking like the dirty film clip when Christina Aguilera had them bangin' titties
Now all my honeys with them double dee's, if you wanna fuck tonight then say please
All my fellas up in this bitch, hope you packing your jimmies
Cause we riding, she riding, she bumping, she biting that neck to neck
Ecstatic, dramatic, acrobatic you know that freaky sex
Oh I fucks with that, my brain always fluxing that
Top 10's stop through my habitat, so hot they pop my thermostat
They drop, they drop, then bring it back, I counter attack with a wack, wack, smack
Cheeks glowing red, while getting head mother fucker milking this spot light like being breast feed
And you know, I got it, ye, ye, I get it
The best to do it, rest to prove it, this that boom banging music
This that tune to fucking lose it, this that beat that I'm abusing
This that uzi fusing a new level, try fucking stepping to it",https://genius.com/Ivan-ooze-eroc-lyrics
Same Ol',Ringwood Rich EP,2014,"I walk the streets with only shrapnel in my pocket
Wallet full of dead moths
And no shopping dockets
I work two to three shifts a week at best
Barely enough money to buy a new tee to impress
Im broke it ain'tâ€™ no joke
Thatâ€™s why I smoke
To shake the door out of the broke neck choke
I know a lot of you people can relate
Got a boss ya hate co workers irritate but can't retaliate
We in the same boat like immigrants
Show the world our innocence yes theyâ€™ll feel the imprisonment
Work every day remain diligent
Still treated like a piece of shit
Power makes the billions ignorant
All I want is a bike with handle bars
Some strings on my guitar
And a home brand caviar
You might think thatâ€™s bizarre but im sick of being poor
Sicka sick of sitting at the bar
Pour me another one aaar
Same olâ€™ day
Same olâ€™ shit
Same olâ€™ paycheck in your midst
Same olâ€™ arse snoring in the same ol' lips
Same olâ€™ barstool were I take my sips
Call it the same griss and I must admit
That the same olâ€™ me is much better than this
Its just the same olâ€™ same olâ€™ yea yea
Its just the same olâ€™ same olâ€™ yea yea
(buzz) (buzz)
Theres another buzzer another soul crusher
Another 5 oclock start
Doesnâ€™t get much ruffer
Empty toilet roll
There goes another soul
Sometimes I just think it would be easier just on the dole
Washing machines leaking
Life is fully peaking
The only time I get away is when im daydreaming
My real estate agent called speaking
My rents over due have until the weekend or I must be leaving
So fuck it ima do my own thing
Ima make the cha ching
Ima make the crowd sing
Ima be the next thing
Ima make my name ring
Ima live like a king
Ima buy some bling bling
Might be a rapper
Might be an actor
Might be the guy that cans the x factor
Whatever I can be i'll reamin me
And Transform my life to bigger things like bumble bee you feel me
Same olâ€™ day
Same olâ€™ shit
Same olâ€™ paycheck in your midst
Same olâ€™ arse snoring in the same ol' lips
Same olâ€™ barstool were I take my sips
Call it the same griss and I must admit
That the same olâ€™ me is much better than this

On & On,Ringwood Rich EP,2014," x2
No matter what we do the world goes on and on
Whatever you've been through, the world goes on and on
Forget your blues, taboos, the world goes on and on
The world goes on and on
The world goes on and on

Yep
You know that feeling you get, when your flooded with debt
Quit smoking but you light a cigarette
Had a one night stand, fired from your job man
Or even issues with the missus but she still don't understand
Got ya hand in ya face, happiness, not a trace
Scrolling down and down for hours on the social cyberspace
Erasing, regret, will take, time
Guys we've all been through it, look at us, were all fine
I had a crazy ass bitch I missed, I know it's hard to resist
We used to kiss, now she doesn't exist
I felt like the s-h to the it, liquor helped me a bit
Dug myself a ditch, was ready to quit
Despite the sad plight I brought upon myself
Time heals everything from the emotions to the health
Fuck the farewells, screw the goodbyes, be some words of wise
Exercise what lies and remember
 x2

(Man I don't even know what I'd tell them, like what would I say? Alright)
Well the message I would send would be kick it with ya friends
Laugh about the dividends, they'll help straighten your bends
Have a night in town, you'll end up at Crown
Clowning around at Velvet Bar until your sorrow's been drowned
There's no hour, minute, second to spare, life can be unfair
But no room for depression in there
Girls saying yeah yeah yeah Uzi blah blah blah
Got the boys covered, how about us honeys with bras
Pfft, Women easy peasy, tub of ice cream and a TV
Sex in the city, cuddled up to ya kitty, when ya feeling shitty
Don't take life so seriously
Fuck self pity, let ya mind be free
No matter what we do the world goes on and on
Whatever you've been through the world goes on and (yeah, you know)

D. Triumphant,The Social Alien Mixtape,2015,"The long awaited, highly anticipated return of the faded
Favourite, making them classic statements, up up on ya playlist
Got them eyes shaded, rolling off the highway
Cruising down my driveway, singing thank fuck thank fuck it's Friday
Feeling like Bruce Almighty, while dancing in my tighty whities, boys mouth must be spicy, what he spitting, so hot
Non-stop, pussy poppin', it's ludicrous, popularity
New to this, Optus telling me to upgrade my usages
Guess I'm in it for the long haul now, raw hide
Ivan Uzi blown wide, competition terrified
Why, oh why, would you fuck with a cut throat looking samurai
My soul has already died, replenished, ready to rise
Spent a childhood memorising rap anthems
So hidden in my atoms is patterns to afford mansions
Shit I used to imagine, is something giving me chances
Hard work finally paying off in unlikely circumstances

This ain't that Donald trump shit, this be Donald triumphant
All my life been at the bottom, now I'm making it something
When this crowd go (ohhhhh), and when that crowd say (hey)
All I know is I'm alright, ok ok, alright, ok, alright
Alright, alright, ok, let these people out to play
I say, I say, I drink, I sway, I lay, I lay, until away
Then I wake up, coffee fill this cup
I caught break what, he caught a break what

The illest civilian living within the village
Reputation growing stronger like my fans are cans of spinach
In a minute I diminish push it to the limit, every visit
Leave heads spinning like a pivot, grab a girlies digits even if she frigid
Uzi does it, Uzi did it, GBC the first to spit it
Ivan wicked, never caught behind, unless I'm playing cricket
There's a wicket, guess I'm out, bounce, bounce coming on bounce
Loudmouthed hooligans, forever we shall speak our clout
I'm proud to be representing myself on these stages
All different races come together to hear my pages
Shit I used to imagine, is something giving me chances
Hard work finally paying off in unlikely circumstances",https://genius.com/Ivan-ooze-d-triumphant-lyrics
Trippin',The Social Alien Mixtape,2015,"She say I ain't gonna make it, my mama be trippin'

Mama be trippin', mother, mother don't listen

Caught up with the drinking, while she thinking
Her son's clothes stinking, marijuana Oder, brain shrinking
He plays that boom bap boom boom boom smack
Over the head, would make him listen to things I once said
Study, study, study, fuck a fuck buddy, buddy
You'll be dressing cruddy for the rest of your damn near life
Pick up the pencil, yes you have the potential, up in ya mental
To pedal and achieve a lovely house with wife
He retaliates, hates what I'd like to create
Would rather go skate, get baked, dig threw these damn so called crates
He's concealing his fate, I can't take it
Threw these halls I be pacing, waiting, hoping, he changes this mind-state
Losing hair, stressed, he don't care
Can tell by his glare, was once my little boy now I'm scared
He's so unaware, I am always there but it's useless
Like a 3 legged chair, he's beyond repair

You ain't bringin' home this bacon, my mama be trippin'
Mama be trippin', mother, mother don't listen

Caught up with a dream and vision
Pumping through his sound system is a 90s rhythm
Scribbling words nouns verbs, plain Dr. Seuss rhyme
Adjusts the pattern and in due time his name will shine
But mother ain't to sure, every second through the door
Grow the fuck up Benjamin, hip hop is immature
You really think your gonna make living gripping microphones
It's in my blood mama, fathers done it since he left home
Music's the one thing that brightens my day
If it went a stray I could say I probably wouldn't be here today
This is more than a hobby, this my gold and diamonds
I was born to spit shit so fucking oath I'mma keep trying
If I don't succeed, please don't be mad at me
Know my blood, sweat and tears entered every single story
No guts, no glory, when I'm in the laboratory
Every song is to make you proud, I'm sorry

She say I ain't gonna make it, my mama be trippin'
Journey ever so forsaken, my mama be trippin'
You ain't bringin' home this bacon, my mama be trippin'

Mt. Moon,The Social Alien Mixtape,2015,"Yeah we own the night, light that stick like dynamite
Quite a appetite for that green in sight, a little delight for what's rolled up tight
When ya ignite, don't rotate right, pass the Dutch to left
Hold your breath, but I must stress that
Fuck with it, now you don't wanna shit high, you wanna cruise by like a dragonfly
Add some drippy droplets to clear those eyes, let this Kush coma intensify
Something 'bout this Mary, no young Diaz, tripping hard like a shoelace joke in class
One puff, two puff of this potent gas and the aftermath are these paragraphs
Mind climbing past planets, chilling a top of Mt. Moon
Floating around in zero gravity while singing this tune
It's like Beedrill up in this bitch, how I broke free from cocoon
And bought my platoon with me, shout out spark master tape and his goons
I'm uprising like the cloud of nine, televising how bright I shine
Enterprising within these line, world domination, soon be mine
My name chime, though every bell, these prime time rhymes, will always outsell
Mother fuck a sum, still get shit done, Uzi weigh a ton, public enemy number 1
Yeah mother fucker, giant awoke from slumber, already 9th wonder I'm 10th mother fucker
If a sucker utter, he'll soon discover, it's hard to recover broken bone structure
Started from the gutter, never disappeared, that weird kid, geared with some phenomenal speech
With sable on the beat, my flow increased, now

While I'm chillin' on top
Of Mt. Moon mutherfucker and I'll be smoking my crops
Like BG up in this bitch, I'll  free from cocoon
And both my peeps are with me, shoutouts 
We up on mount moon mutherfucker
We up on mount moon mutherfucker

Hustle me all the time, while I'm writing my lines, she wasn't happy in the slums, I had overdue fines
I would, contemplate getting a apprenticeship, for our relationship, call it quits on this music shit
Hit the muscle labour, minimum wage paper, wasn't in my nature but for her I would of catered
Ah, read the local leader looking weekly, for my sweetie, so we could make a peace treaty
A plumber called me up, had my first interview, got nervous, got high, fucking blew it dude
Her anger stewed, sky rocketed beyond the moon, couple other small factors had her leaving before noon
I stared out my window while I watched night consume, thinking of a decent reason to venture out my room

You gotta make the money to keep a honey, you gotta make the money ain't nothing funny when comes to honeys

Wasn't ready for another girl, only had appetite for drinking in abundance till I hurled
I was, stuck sitting writing depressing lyrics, wishing she was here in spirit but certain there wasn't a snippet
Parents on my back now, get employment or your out, ciao, so I printed a little resume down
Went to town, eastland, the shopping centre of Ringwood, handed A4's out, while looked i distinguished
Called by the toy shop, come in for trail chop chop, dropped the phone told my pop, got props
Attained a position, working mainly with women, on my first shift, the prettiest girl climbed in my vision
Way out of my league, became friends indeed, she was older than me but such a unique breed
Talked about computer games, couple comics and music, she loved music, I said she really loved music

You gotta make the money to keep a honey, you gotta make the money ain't nothing funny when comes to honeys
You gotta make the money to keep a honey, but she really like music, she really likes music
You gotta make the money to keep a honey, you gotta make the money ain't nothing funny when comes to honeys
You gotta make the money to keep a honey, but she really like music, she really likes music

It's my 21st birthday, hip hip hooray, had a party in my backyard with friends and family
Big speakers, BBQ, lot of drinks, lot of jays, reminiscing on old days in our school phase
In came the pretty honey I invited from work, chilled as always, payed her out, damn I'm jerk
Half way through the night, I was drunk as hell, massive headache, couldn't bare another story tell
Boom, landed vertical on my spread, rubbing my temples, smiggin of spew on my threads
In walked you know who, laid next to me to, said she was drunk, I said love you too
She smiled then our lips connected, highly unexpected, ever since I've been infected
And anytime I ever ask ""do you like what I do"" she says it doesn't matter what you do, I like you

You gotta make the money to keep a honey, you gotta make the money ain't nothing funny when comes to honeys
Unless that honey don't want your money, she just funny, nothing come between you, her and the music
You gotta make the money to keep a honey, you gotta make the money ain't nothing funny when comes to honeys
Unless that honey don't want your money, she just funny, nothing come between you, her and the music",https://genius.com/Ivan-ooze-money-hungry-honeys-lyrics
Kokkaine Candy Kamp,Kokkaine Candy Kamp,2016,"Just swallowed H2O bottle
Now they reminisce till my mind full throttle
Yolo be the motto
Lookin' like I won the lotto
Talkin' to the baddest model sayin' she from marracho
I know she wanna fuck
Actin' like she starstruck
Claimin' she never met a rapper who be up with the buzz
Speaking of buzz, I think I be feeling them drugs
All I'm thinking of is love luck think he want rubs
Every beat comin' out of the system
It bein' sounden real good in my waxxy ear drum
Did you got the serum
And I caught the rhythm
Mix the bitch together and hit the fucking ignition
Such a bunch of wisdom

Planets,The Social Alien Mixtape,2015,"Lets take flight, yeah yeah lets start from the beginning, free your whole imagination, be whoever you wanna be whether good or sinning
Whether hero or villain, this is your world now, issa what you live in your choice might roll in a Royce or relax in a hot tub with fined out women
Whatever is written, your the author illustrator, the mastermind behind any little detail you've penned down on the blank sheet of paper
Create your flashback to the moments cherished deep in your heart, even depart into those cloudy dreams where you're dedicated to leave your mark
And i know that we can do it, the impossible can be achieved all we need is persistence, determination, mind body and soul, big picture believe, i know its so naive, like the kooks, my lyrics i wrote just for goose, stepped up in the booth, dropped a EP just playin my thoughts and roofs young till i youth
Walk down the street, people shout in groups, not offensive anymore, more confidence boost, if ya hate what i produce kiss my caboose, Ringwood motherfucker, bootlegged juice
I'm proof anyone can sissy, made music for lovin them v v grade, made music to represent who i be, what's that dudes name, that's Ivan Uzi (hoo)
Look at all the planets, just look at all the planets and i know yeah you know we can go we can go we can go
Look at all the planets, just look at all the planets and i know yeah you know we can go we can go we can go
Look at all the planets, just look at all the planets and i know yeah you know we can go we can go we can go
Look at all the planets, just look at all the planets and i know yeah you know we can go we can go we can go
My planet consists of workin 9 to 5 to keep me alive, then another 9 overtime releasing this fascinating verbal hobby of mine
Practice see, practice dream, practice makes perfect and sleep, laying underneath this fleece, while unconscious i'm at peace
Better than any reality, swimmin through stars in the galaxy, sum it up in one analogy, these visions keep our sanity
While i'm floatin in this fantasy, spin around in zero gravity, let me address my high school faculty, hope you hear this and you're mad at me
Don't ever let another being bring you down, that's you princess, you wear that crown, keep your head high, no word of a lie, i know you'll make it name renowned
Yeah that's you boy, enjoy enjoy, be who you wanna be, please don't ask me, within your heart is a destined path you will fulfill so happily
We all have our world, unique in every which way, yeah yeah we all have our world, you don't like it walk away
From Pluto to Jupiter, smallest to biggest, our world is our world so you choose how you will live it (oh ooh ooh)
Look at all the planets, just look at all the planets and i know yeah you know we can go we can go we can go
Look at all the planets, just look at all the planets and i know yeah you know we can go we can go we can go",https://genius.com/Ivan-ooze-planets-lyrics
SUTHN WOT,,1990,"I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
I ain't wearin' na nada
I'm sittin' pretty, impatient, but I know you gotta
Put in them hours, I'mma make it harder
I'm sending pic after picture, I'mma get you fired

I know you're always on the night shift
But I can't stand these nights alone
And I don't need no explanation
'Cause baby, you're the boss at home

You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work, work, work, work
But you gotta put in work, work, work, work, work, work, work
You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work, work, work, work
Let my body do the work, work, work, work, work, work, work, work
We can work from home, oh, oh, oh-oh
We can work from home, oh, oh, oh-oh

Let's put it into motion
I'mma give you a promotion
I'll make it feel like a vacay, turn the bed into an ocean
We don't need nobody, I just need your body
Nothin' but sheets in between us, ain't no getting off early

I know you're always on the night shift
But I can't stand these nights alone
And I don't need no explanation
'Cause baby, you're the boss at home

You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work, work, work, work
But you gotta put in work, work, work, work, work, work, work
You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work, work, work, work
Let my body do the work, work, work, work, work, work, work, work
We can work from home, oh, oh, oh-oh
We can work from home, oh, oh, oh-oh

Girl, go to work for me
Can you make it clap, no hands for me?
Take it to the ground, pick it up for me
Look back at it all over me
Put in work like my timesheet
She ride it like a '63
I'mma buy her no Celine
Let her ride in a foreign with me
Oh, she the bae, I'm her boo
And she down to break the rules
Ride or die, she gon' go
I won't judge, she finesse
I pipe up, she take that
Putting overtime on your body

You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work, work, work, work
But you gotta put in work, work, work, work, work, work, work
You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work, work, work, work
Let my body do the work, work, work, work, work, work, work, work
We can work from home, oh, oh, oh-oh
We can work from home, oh, oh, oh-oh

I Hope You Get It,,2017,"Can't escape your shackles of time
We both prison into our old mind
Don't forget it now
Sunshine after shrouded behind
Total darkness, closed venetian blinds
I hope you get it now

I hope you get it now
Feelin' like there's no way out
Lead me by the hand
Show this man there's a greater route
I hope you get it now
Feelin' like there's no way out
Lead me by the hand
Show this man there's a greater route

Take me to a place where the quiet's found
Take me to a place where there ain't no sound
I know it exists, only seen a glimpse
Feel your soul drift, feel your soul drift
Feel your soul drift

Pull me up, set me free
Let my conscience be around this world that I can't see
Been gallopin' with Binky so long it's quite hard to believe
I finally made it from beneath, this air's much fresher to breathe
Those trials and tribulations convinced me on occasion
Where I belong was somewhere better than this civilisation
So, I was waitin', waitin' with a telescope and some dough
Hopin' to hit you down before I learn a bit more

Take me to a place where the quiet's found
Take me to a place where there ain't no sound
I know it exists, only seen a glimpse
Feel your soul drift, feel your soul drift

Take me to a place where the quiet's found
Take me to a place where there ain't no sound
I know it exists, only seen a glimpse
Feel your soul drift, feel your soul drift
Feel your soul drift, feel your soul drift
Feel your soul drift, feel your soul drift

I hope you get it, I hope you get it now
I hope you get it
I hope you get it, I hope you get it now
Feel your soul drift, feel your soul drift
I hope you get it, I hope you get it now
I hope you get it, I hope you get it
I hope you get it, I hope you get it now
Feel your soul drift, feel your soul drift
I hope you get it, I hope you get it now
I hope you get it
I hope you get it, I hope you get it now
Feel your soul drift, feel your soul",http://www.songlyrics.com/crooked-colours-feat-ivan-ooze/i-hope-you-get-it-lyrics/
Flying Cars,,2018,"Fly, fly, fly, fly
Fly, fly, fly

Get out, go
You know what heals your soul
To conquer any milestone you need to loose control
We step out of our comfort zone 'cause we uncomfortable
We wanna make a change, 'cause being chained is vulnerable
Break restraints do whatever it takes to taste the gold
Make mistakes only where you'll escape them shadow calls
Fuck a cape, there's a hero within each one of y'all
Once the fire ignites, the night will hear your mighty roar
This for the kick downs, we movin' bruised up
So put your twos up, we livin' ruthless
Been through them sewers
We've dodged maneuvered
The lights in view (ah)
Like Slick, we rulers

Let's [?] (fly)
Let's [?] (fly)
Let's [?] (fly)
Let's [?] (fly)
Let's [?] (fly)
Let's [?] (fly)
Let's [?] (fly)
Let's [?] (fly)

No, there ain't no way that I'm ever goin' back
Got these voices in my head tellin' me I'm stronger than that
If you quitin' at the intermission, don't finish the match
Then you'll never know your true potential, where you could be at
One more [?] in my [?]
Life is what you make, either [?] or [?]
[?] struggle on the double, don't you let a hole bubble
Pick the [?]
Embrace the [?]
Levitate through the ceiling",http://www.songlyrics.com/kuren-feat-ivan-ooze/flying-cars-lyrics/
TWO WEEKS,,2014," [verse 1]
the night lurker, used to be a burger flipper
hated getting called names like champ or skipper
made some money off selling mary jane to trippers
was a stoner myself, no shipper, door deliveries
most of teen years, are the best memories
brings a tear to my eye, how close we used to be
fell apart like hunters spearing glacier
it’s in our nature to move on, your worker, i’m a entertainer
f-ck money, man i work for smiles
work for my fans, if they get buck wild then it’s worth while
i’m inspired by the ways the family man thinks
planned out his future at 20 with some quiet drinks
they’ve chose the road of a modern life:
modern wife, modern kids till the afterlife
i’m a capricorn, so f-ck that right
i’mma make my own little money of the love that i recite

[hook]
i ain’t working 5 days a week
till my physiques antique and i can’t speak
you say you have one life, do with it what you will
i plan to fill, all my days with good vibes and chill
i’m a misfit, i guess could say my heads not the clearest
haters say ooze is so undistinguished, can you hear this
but in my mind it’s just oh oh ooo ah ah ah ah ohh


 
[verse 2]
mother thinks i’m grow into a man soon
get a decent apartment, watch night consume moon
shout out to wzdkid, guess us boys share the same view
stare at the stars outside of a bar on mars, i get lifted
since i started my rhymes have consisted
of a vivid past life, much of which i was addicted
to drugs, crime, alcohol, not ya daily protocol
spraying walls with aerosols, mental scars will not dissolve
but i’m still living, breathing, and seeing
i’m not the only one dreaming of the day i make it emceeing
the support i’m getting is such a lovely feeling
and i ain’t gonna stop till i reach sky’s ceiling
don’t like my sh-t, good, get it off ya playlist
but minds eyes says if your friends play it you won’t debate it
funny but i won’t hold that sh-t against n0body
guess i am man, you band wagons are carbon copy’s

[hook]
i ain’t working 5 days a week
till my physiques antique and i can’t speak
you say you have one life, do with it what you will
i plan to fill, all my days with good vibes and chill
i’m a misfit, i guess could say my heads not the clearest
haters say ooze is so undistinguished, can you hear this
but in my mind it’s just oh oh ooo ah ah ah ah ohh",https://azlyrics.biz/i/ivan-ooze-lyrics/ivan-ooze-two-weeks-remix-lyrics/
