Who’s Next,,2019,"Who’s that who’s next man still grinding hard for that set – man do 24 with no rest from that double six so don’t test x2

Verse 1 (Nox) My Uce switches gears when my opps disappear
Running in the trap knock knock who’s there
It’s the double six back in town – free all my lads stuck in the freaking jail cells
We ain’t letting out rounds or swinging that blade
Being quiet till long time to hit the front page
Keep that shit over there, my lads like rambo ain’t no musketeers
Get off the field you’re acting like Shakespeare
Too much chit chat – watch man get bitched slapped
Leave him laying like he’s playing flat cat
I carry my ghees like I got a backpack
I came to ensures the double six coming in quick call me john wick on the field from The 2166 dibs hook it up for the boys in the mix
Watch shit bang like a Glock when it clicks

(Chorus)

Who’s that who’s next man still grinding hard for that set – man do 24 with no rest from that double six so don’t test x2


 
Verse 2 (Jayking) I guess It’s my turn Jayking rocking the makeup with the 6 on the map say the 6 twice
Drillers getting got we got them running like mice
If a pussy tryna beef he get the set now its a oppose 9
Never fold when it gets tough that’s a bitch move
I know a opp a bitch like a see-through – begging on his knees like a little bitch’s tool aid
I put the steel to his head I call it checkmate
Got popped now we on the floor trynna call back putting Cabramatta on the map
Tell them that we all back, tell them we aint holding back – take a trip around the Block coming back holding stacks

Like (edgy burchie?) – like who gonna purge me – like who gonna trynna cop a L when trynna test me (x2)

(Chorus)

Who’s that who’s next man still grinding hard for that set – man do 24 with no rest from that double six so don’t test x2

Verse 3 (Breezy) We ain’t gonna stop ‘til we come up on top
Cabramatta double 6 youngins watch us slice through them dogs
Show those lads what we been on – show these opps where we from
Keep that energy up and going cuz we grind ‘til they gone
Now they claiming they taking risks but never taking them trips – now they talking like they got straps but never banged off them clips
Let them lads know who it is it’s 21DOUBLESIX – let them lads pick up the blades while mine be gripping their fist, now tell me

(chorus)
