Whut!,Audio Projectile,2010,"Listener's fiendish, like they're addicted to D-trix
Sinking their teeth in, each verse licking their fingers
Spitting the deepest thoughts written in English
Giving this linguist that he admittedly  it
I break lines like Petero Civoniceva
Spreading words like sexually transmitted diseases
Rip you to pieces, beats of paper mâché
Torn like sugar sachets, left in café ashtrays
Fuck the rap breaks, I'm in here with the black trades
Here to milk the world like the planet's made of lactate
So get the facts straight or back away
Or else you're doomed as much as smokers who're lunging over three packs a day
Well I'm admittedly spread, viciously there
I visually stun with the extent of my imagery's depth
I'm in to the end, consider this the final credits
Plutonic Lab, 2Bucks, Dialectrix, what?

I'm such a freak, I make Silverchair look normal
Make a highlander mortal, the perfect awful
I dawdle while you sprint, I mortify the rich
My poor communication can borderline a hint
Cause I rock stupidity one sock to millipedes
And literally epitome of a contradictory act, yo
A similar will never be found
For ever he readily down, with nothing letting me out
Just get serious and drop jokes
I get dissed by the same people who say I'm a top bloke
So what hope do I have to make a hot flow
With what's brutal my page is weak as man, a compo
Not so I just tricked ya
I say the opposite of what I am just to fuck with ya
A rough picture of me is clearly distorted
And even though my game is cheap no one here can afford, it's like

Zahir,Audio Projectile,2010,"Dialectrix
Wake in the morning I'm yawning and stiff
And stepping to my day with a morbid affliction
Wanting that buzz man it's all that I'm wishing
Unfortunate victim, taunted by liquids
Falling and slumping, appallingly grumpy till boiling a jug
Then I pour it and drink it
Call it addiction, call it obsession
Until I got a drop I got a poor mans attention
Taurine, caffeine, ginko, guarana
The drinks that are bringing the speed of my heart up
Need of a fiend till my thinking is faster
Or shitting my pants like the first fleets of europeans seeing the haka
Teeth decay with the breath of a demon stinking like garbage
Sugar erosion see be the reason its reeking like armpits
As the day dims and it leads into darkness
Switch up gears and I reach for the lagers
Going to the bottleo for me be the target
Sort of like an animal that feasts on a carcass
Hunting down what I want ravenously, as rapping on beats
Has needs as an artist
Stuck with a curse when I fill up a cup man as long as I'm drinking I'm deep in the carnage
Tommy Illfigga
I’m a slave to the booze and the porn
Now a days I’m amazed that I’m using it more
When Abusing the whores in the magazine spreads
When I’m adamantly at it and I’m battin in bed
None of these babes gunna ask for devotion
When their ass on a page in a bath full of lotion
Suits me fine when the coochies mine
When I line up and shoot from the booth behind
The glass in the peepshow where I find the ass
N i Never beat slow so my time‘ll last
Hate to have a wife where u never get the beaver
U know a DVD is never going to leave ya
Free in fact no fees attached
Thum nails the thumbnails and eases back
I ain't social devoted to net
Hoes that drop clothes and pose for the cheque
Never pay for a date to day
Cause my hand got a date with ann angel and Katie fey
Lady ey, ya better down loads
Ya better download on my 80 k
Day to day I’m droppin my draws
Never get it done when mum is knockin on doors
Not gotta stop what I’m doin when It’s locked
Don’t need a lap dance when u gotta lap top
Joe New
Let me start this off to the ones that knock what I drop
With a big fuck off
When they're functioning wrong and they're lunging a bong I put their foot in their mouth like they're munching a thong
Want to bet what I gonna gets, in a bigger brown paper bag and it's wet with a longer neck
What I want to get is atmosphere like I'm on a jet saying your captains here
Tap that when I hit it to the limit
I blow a pay cheque when I sit for a minute
The village idiot I'm in a rhythm when I hit them then I go home yo and admitted that I did it
If I didn't I'd be illegitimate, and a little bit messed up
Got to give it up, never winning it , next up
To the chapter of liquid, I set that trap to capture the victim
Raps an addiction smoking a marbrough
Blaze that up like a shot of galliano
We work the day to make or brake the arvo
Wake up the next day make the macchiato
Get the blood pumping legs running
Head hunting for the next drink coming
Lords of deception, call it obsession
Cause and effect but it's all we invest in",https://genius.com/Dialectrix-zahir-lyrics
"This Is Like, Mental",Audio Projectile,2010,"Yeah, that’s right
The whole world is mental
Nothing makes sense in this bitch
Don’t believe Liberal
Don’t believe Labor
Rip your newspaper to shreds with a cheese grater
Truth more shockin’ than fascist police tazers
And breathe danger like a drunken p-plater
I’m literally mad, actually crazy
The main stream regime insanity made me
I may have just came from an alien ship
The world’s my oyster
Gone off and makin’ me sick
I’m statin’ this shit – the obvious
While witnessing apocalypse
Meditating deep breathing oxygen with smog in it
Fat food, man boobs, heart attacks
And the depressing recess of market crash
We got nazdaq, wall street and adal jones
How it all makes sense only hell knows
Work, eat, sleep, shit, buy and sell homes
While expandin’ at the rate of abnormal cell growth

Outcast,Cycles Of Survival,2008,"We're bred to acquire an invincibility
And let's simplify to fix this civility
And then minimise existence with liberty
Led down a line which hits instability
A sign of release, Time to unwind
Time to redirect life for frontlines
All I need is one mic and one mind
Isolation helps fight the unkind
When we move forward, A new dawn arrives
But we choose to ignore food for the mind
Who's mortified that we ought to buy a piece of land
In order to form a life?
Who authorised this competitive normality?
Causality's accepting the formalities
Caught battling impetuous mortality
Traumatically misled into storing clarity
Yo
Heaven-forbid I don't be a slave and
Heaven-forbid I go my way man
'Cause I know that it's hard to accept
I'm an outcast, Outcast, Outcast
Yo
Step to the plate, Like a batter up
Who's mad enough to smack the ball out the park
Now, How bizarre, Man, That I act bizarre
As an option I close in and self-destruct
And now I gotta get it together
Whether it's now or never
Make moves, A man is pressure
My plans are never to advance
So we handle better
Inevitably, Your family stands together
A man's dilemma is less where there's unity found
Who can be down of mind, With this movement of ours?
Who, In their cowardice, Who threw in the towel?
Who, In their outcast, Will keep true to themselves?
Because we don't need a reason to boycott our dreams
And follow the lead and I take the lead, Man
With me, I'm the king of my kingdom
Shouting out loud, The things that I'm thinkin
Yo
Heaven-forbid I don't be a slave and
Heaven-forbid I go my way man
'Cause I know that it's hard to accept
I'm an outcast, Outcast, Outcast
Heaven-forbid, Our lives are different
Whether you're choosing to abide by the system
Whether you're losing touch, Like ice addiction
Whether or not you live in a tight position
Whether your cause is based on a righteous mission
Or capitalising and providing riches
I hope your drive'll supply fulfilment
Both ends of the spectrum require persistence
With my religious guide and wisdom
Is like a Christian's bible scripture is
Loving the time that you have on this earth
And just be free, Then capture the worth of a choice
'Cause that's all we've got, At the end of the day
So call the shots, This man in solitude won't change the making and no matter what you do, Someone will hate it so...
Heaven-forbid I don't be a slave and
Heaven-forbid I go my way man
'Cause I know that it's hard to accept
I'm an outcast, Outcast, Outcast

Came For The Sound,Cycles Of Survival,2008,"One, two, we came for the sound
Three, four, we came to get down
Five, six, so let's hear it now
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump

Jump up and down 'til you're breaking a disc
When you're clutching your  making a fist
When we're pumping the system the neighbours are pissed up
 for the kids who
Come to the shows with their mates and their chicks
Like blazing the  while taking a piss
Breaks in the mix, turntabler spin
And the pretty little things start shaking their tits
We running amok, starting(?) to try hard
Cycles who bust when we come in the club
So don't, don't tell me to stop
You stick around  'til I drop
With  at the top, we be bombing

Back into the place
We getting downtown like minimum ways
Tearing the set to this like paper mache, yeah
We're doing this for  everybody 
Even if it don't  listening
Soothed by the music, it's lifting the heads
And I move to the groove when we flip a little bit of text
Next set to go, I'm wrecking it
To metronomes 
Boast to brag so cope with that
Fuck cafe hip hop, a bogan rap
Man, this is what it is and it is straight live shit
Loose shit, tight shit, nothing quite like it

Dialectrix: Rapper Tag #44,Rapper Tag Australia,2011,"Well this here is Ruffneck Reality here
And all Rudeboy 
Fire!
Waddup, Dialectrix, DJ 2Buck, alright
Shout outs to Pegz, rest in peace Hunter
Shout outs to MC , we gon' do it like this, yeah

D to the motherfucking
Trix in this bitch tryna get my tag it happening
With DJ 2Buck in it 'cos when you tagging me, you're tagging him
Add it in, mix it up, whatever back my spit
When I pickpocket in every style that a rapper gives
It's packing to the maximum I'm back to the
Have to put it to that it should be actually rappers
 figured it out, now, I'm on a couch slouched
 stopping my psychological meltdown
Because I got a confession: I fall to depression
From all the cause and effect from E to the war recession
Not to mention the attention from doctors and medics street
In my my son's life, like they actually wanted to end it
Wanted to send it straight up to heaven
Chillin' in God's presence, no solitary breath in
And man this life that I let I'll probably regret but
They say that I fucking rock like a paleontology fetish
Shout out to 
 for a punch line to help me moving forward
Star chameleon, picture ambition that's higher than helium
Feeling empowered, I ride and  on this beat
When I thrust in, then I eject, uh
I wreck, sir, whenever the Wish is Def, uh
Be in my ear like ""checka checka check"", uh
I'll make them cheeks shine like them reflectors
Nah, man, shit, just chilling
Spitting out a rhythm on the shit 2Buck's spinning
Sip a little liquor for that gritty sustenance
While I flip my middle fingers at our shitty government, but
Hold back now 'cos I'm all
In to the point, I gotta pick up my pen and let it rip
But I'm still rocking mics, while the rest are sucking dicks
So put the mic down when I'm coming onto the stage,  when I spit

Alright, once again, rest in peace Hunter
This one's for you, man
This is stress release welcome to my rest in peace
The death of my cousin means that I never sleep
McCartney state of mind let it be
With a drink that I flee to like a refugee
But my poisons ain't killing me softly
When I fiend an almighty high - god speed
Truth being the human being is not free
When they're tuned in to heaviness like drop D
Nu metal, new mortar, new concrete
Working like a slave pays for my boss feed
When I should be making you shake your cans like Dondi
But instead I'm the one that's shook - Mobb Deep
I've got to milk my music till I've got cream
Cause my sons eyes are 2Pac - on me
Looking if I've got the goods to raise him properly
Living up at 5th gear at top speed
'Cos my world is a war, peace is the obstacle
War is time, constant and unstoppable
Time is my enemy, limiting what's possible
But enemies are friends whenever they're unconquerable
That's what I'm telling you
If you don't understand, rewind it, say ""yep"" (yep)
You fit into a primitive mould
And you do what you're told, I'm living with a mischievous soul, it's like that

Alright, Joe New, you're up next, brother
I'm outta here, peace",https://genius.com/Dialectrix-dialectrix-rapper-tag-44-lyrics
Go,The Cold Light of Day,2013,"Go! Go!
Go! Go!
Go! Go!

Ya, ya, oh
Hickory dickory dock, I'm watching the clock
That's counting my seconds down
But every hour then amounts 
To my future near, but my present's now
 and the time's on my hands
Left like grand theft taken away
Placed in a cage, waiting for days
Slave to the ways of an age
But I tried  when I 
Said it may change me but I can't change it
I live trapped in the gift of
A pitiful moment 
I  free time killer
Opportunity for me slipper
Waiting in a haze of day-to-day hiccups
Not just in a place ready for pickup
So with or without it
It seems to me I'm sitting here doubting
But forget about it
Time is ours and we claiming it now
Let's go!

I hear my time ticking down (Go!)
As the world goes around (Go!)
I hear my time ticking down (Go!)
As the world goes around (Go!)
I hear my time ticking down (Go!)
As the world goes around (Go!)

Land of the giants, clash of the titans
Man vs. science, stamped in the fire
Stand in defiance, add to the riots
Anger and violence, ambulance sirens
Where time just keep spinning and
Swing like a fork like pendulums
And then begin to take a seat
And wait and see what the day can bring
Many  lives some A to B
Tick, tick, gone - that's the way it seems
And some will drink it or smoke
It or lose it any way they can
We gladly pass it by
Thrown to the wind left asking, ""why?""
We part with time like a Grand Exchange
And think for the now, don't plan next day
Just go!

I hear my time ticking down (Go!)
As the world goes around (Go!)
I hear my time ticking down (Go!)
As the world goes around (Go!)
I hear my time ticking down (Go!)
As the world goes around (Go!)

Yo, peace, love, war, hate
Crossing calendars of dates
Work, eat, sleep, play
Wait to see another day
Live fast, die young
Past is gone, what's done is done
Tick tock, tick tock
Live for the minute I got on my watch
I roll with the masses, home of the facists
This my home where I soak in the madness
High density, identity
Everybody wanna go where the cash is
Madman living, man made prison
Life behind bars, we doing our time
Losing our lives, setting in stone
As our time will
Go!

I hear my time ticking down (Go!)
As the world goes around (Go!)
I hear my time ticking down (Go!)
As the world goes around (Go!)
I hear my time ticking down (Go!)
As the world goes around (Go!)",https://genius.com/Dialectrix-go-lyrics
Take Flight,The Cold Light of Day,2013,"So check the life of the new rap I write and choose
Cause there's no other type of life that I would like to do
And people criticise and tell me what they're thinking of it
An immature daydreamer with a drinking problem
So while others go to get careers to be a man
I'm forever young and never age like I'm Peter Pan
For me, the plan is working hard to feed a greedy fan
And keep 'em amped up with every beat I speak on, man
I play the best type of beats in my stereo
And try to keep my happiness high, and stress level low
I hit the road like it's part of life's episode
And everywhere I go is sort of like a second home
I'm soaking in the sunset and the summer breeze
I'm feeling utterly inundated and under siege
From the north to southerly scape suddenly
We banging these beats, boys, from Byron Bay to Bungaree

Take flight, I'll see you when I get back
I'll see you when I get back
Excuse me as I kiss the sky
Take flight, I'll see you when I get back
I'll see you when I get back
(That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype)
(I keep my song tight, let these lines stay flight)
Yo, I'm a tradie in the day and a muser in the night
Then I'm going through some new tracks and dutifully I write
When the weekend comes, I'm cruising on a flight
To my next destination, get you moving on the mic
From the mountainous ridge to the Valley of Bris
I scour the rim of this land for the crowds of my gigs
Whether it's out in the sticks or surrounded by bricks
I got more pound in that fist like the Alex da Kid
And I savour all the faces I ever seen
And next year, there's plenty more places that I've never been
We're from a soil that is ancient with deadly beings
Spanning the vast desolation to evergreens
My destiny got me adrenaline packed
From my pen and my pad to everywhere I been on the map
I spiritually levitate every second I rap
These fleeting moments are history I'll never get back
And so...
(Excuse me as I kiss the sky)

From skateboarding or wake boarding on clean waters
My temperament is envious of extreme sportsmen
Surrounded by recreational resources
And all I do is sit on my arse like Steve Hawking
But I head to the snow and get on the slopes
Of Victoria mountainsides and perilous roads
And I'm down to endeavour to get out in the weather
And when I'm ready I get up to shred the powder or perish
And so, from the heat to the freezing cold climates
We're dealing with the needs of the greedy coal miners
Plus, we got the symbol of simplified credence
Who gave my stars in the sky, a stigmatised meaning, yeah
From the opulence of gold and treasures
My gratitude conflicts with unwholesome ethics
And my memories are gems which I hold and cherish
But they're like tainted jewels from a stolen premise
It goes

Black and Gold,The Cold Light of Day,2013,"Getting my piece of the pie I hustle away with the work and the deadline
While leaving behind my catalogue with a story like bed time
Leaving my freedom even ignoring importance of sleep
Dreaming of living large in a big apartment on boulevard settings by the sea
See I've been down a bit been out of it sort of like a raving mad man
Inadequate to handle shit all I do is work on my rapping
Chronically on it honestly losing the use of my mind
I need a holiday and bath off a bay my face wrapped in a bit of sunshine
But wait now hold up wake up older no ultimatum weights on my shoulders
Got enough thoughts that are taking their toll going
All around the head like the lines of a bowl cut
Under the pressure of getting shredded I know that it's bold but
I've been up and then down down and I'm ready for the winter when the snow and the cold come

I've seen the greenest hills things that give me freezing chills
But still my work can be my weakness like Achilles' heel
It's not a pretty deal living with this gritty feel
I keep it real black and gold no frills son
I've seen the greenest hills things that give me freezing chills
But still my work can be my weakness like Achilles' heel
It's not a pretty deal living with this gritty feel
I keep it real black and gold no frills son

Day in day out my life will see the
Same things play out it might just be the
Way that I'm paving my future soon it is clear that I need to
Change this break out to find more freedom

It's sort of like the shining so isolated and dedicated to not wasting time that it's
Driving craziness into my life. I need to stop need to let my hair down and watch
Watch all the world that is surrounding me not thinking of then
What's around the corner when I wake up in the morning
Man I better get up all of what I'm waiting for to pile up
On a platter put upon the shoulders heavy with the burden
Betting all of what I want to get is unattainable to pull off
Voice that's inside me forever needing to speak and release
I'm never going to get ahead what I want to do and now
I'm taking time off living life free
I take it day to day while witnessing this beauty
And then I find that place of all the things I'm losing
Claiming it back and attracting all of the things that I need
For my whole life toward the raw light the thought is all right with joy to just be

I've seen the greenest hills things that give me freezing chills
But still my work can be my weakness like Achilles' heel
It's not a pretty deal living with this gritty feel
I keep it real black and gold no frills son
I've seen the greenest hills things that give me freezing chills
But still my work can be my weakness like Achilles' heel
It's not a pretty deal living with this gritty feel
I keep it real black and gold no frills son
I keep it real black and gold no frills son
I keep it real black and gold no frills son
I keep it real black and gold no frills son

Fire in the Blood,The Cold Light of Day,2013,"First off fuck the world I'm straight over it
No debt to no man I owe no one shit
Yo life's a bitch and fucking turned into one
Taking on slavery in order just to feed my son
And be an M.C trying to push boundaries
And pay rent each week with another mouth to feed
It's almost impossible to come to grips with
The Sick 66 nature of art and business
There used to be artists who inspired me
Made me want to rhyme on beats
One signed me others want to fight with me
26 still on minimum wage
But destroying other rappers when I spit on a stage
It's ridiculous shit I've got the skills to get paid
But the bullshit of the world man it fills me rage
It's the flame in the blood that I can't escape
And it's too late to turn around now can't start again

Fire in my blood ignites in my veins
(Visualise the flame - flame - flames)
Boiling inferno the flow of the flames
(Lemme tell you 'bout my - my life)
Fire in my blood ignites in my veins
(It's in my blood - blood line)
Boiling inferno the flow of the flames

My life is a mess violently stressed tired and restless
Dreaming of squeezing guns against the side of my head
With that Jake the Muss blood line history of violence
Breaking all the rules and unwilling with compliance
And it's harmful to see as a father to be
That the apple really doesn't fall far from the tree
Yo and every man should try to aim or want to be a better Dad
When they've got a child and give them what they never had
I'm scared shitless of the flame in my veins
Or the fact we stoke the fire with the way that we raise
Our children if they copy what they see and what they see's disgraceful
We pass it on to the next seed up in the navel, yo

Fire in my blood ignites in my veins
(Visualise the flame - flame - flames)
Boiling inferno the flow of the flames
(Lemme tell you 'bout my - my life)
Fire in my blood ignites in my veins
(It's in my blood - blood line)
Boiling inferno the flow of the flames

Bi polar, depressed, insane, schizophrenic
Psycho, alcoholic, drop kick with depression
That's what you're called when you go against the grain
A by-product of the fire blood blazing flames
No longer playing games I've got to make a change
I can't raise my child living with these crazy ways
And so suitably I need to lose lunacy
Learning to love life just like I love Lucius Leaf
The powers that be and the powers within
The gamble ain't worth it no more because the house always wins
I'll forget the whole world forget about it for him
And freeze the blood lines, the dousing begins

Fire in my blood ignites in my veins
(Visualise the flame - flame - flames)
Boiling inferno the flow of the flames
(Lemme tell you 'bout my - my life)
Fire in my blood ignites in my veins

New Generation,The Cold Light of Day,2013,"Yeah I used to have these idea's and dreams of
What they future would be like as a kid it sort
Of went something like this…
I used to wish I could time warp through lie I could time warp through life forward
And see a cyborg shoot fire balls like Guy Fawkes
But in this real life it's nothing like a child's thoughts
Just cities full of smog traffic jams and eye sores
So why talk about a future that you would happen
When automatically it's nothing like we all imagined
Technology boomed blossomed and bloomed
With innovation changing what we all use
Something we choose to try to make our lives more organised
But when the shit breaks down you feel it's all a lie
Sort of like a contra dictional box we fit in
Cause you don't want the gimmick but got all their stock admit it
A new era of group pressure to be the same
With youth bred to consume every leading chain
So we remain to see these up and coming people change
In these re arranging times where kids will never be the same

They got it all at the click of a button
But I'm feeling that I'm doomed every minute that I touch it
They got it all at the click of a button
But I'm feeling that I'm doomed every minute that I touch it
They got it all at the click of a button

Living the hecticness of this interconnectedness
When were given the internet and then billions vent on it
Uneducated opinions in a twitter subjectiveness
Grammatically incorrect in aliterate sentences
In due time we suffer to puerile abundance
Where every things available viewed by the public
This era of entitlement fuels my repugnance
With every artist got to face futile redundant's
This age of piracy invades my privacy
With shit that don't make sense but stated righteously
And you could stalk me with ways to spy on me
Alone but together you can't escape the irony
Try make us buy an add via a viral spam
The tangible disappears on their diagram
A human inside a machine like iron man
This age brings the play things of idle hands look

They got it all at the click of a button
But I'm feeling that I'm doomed every minute that I touch it
They got it all at the click of a button
But I'm feeling that I'm doomed every minute that I touch it
They got it all at the click of a button

Cause I'm inclined to know the cycle go
Like ini mini miny moe
I picked it were voluntarily followed by GPS
The terms and conditions are pushy like BMX
So re assess the problems often common from the
Technological era that I'm watching
Is the digital man part of sinister plans
Or is it advanced ideas for living expanse
I'm given a glance of future evolutions of man
To be a hunch back figure staring into his hands

They got it all at the click of a button
But I'm feeling that I'm doomed every minute that I touch it
They got it all at the click of a button
But I'm feeling that I'm doomed every minute that I touch it
They got it all at the click of a button",https://genius.com/Dialectrix-new-generation-lyrics
No One Believed,The Cold Light of Day,2013,"A shimmering shape suddenly appears out of thin air - a shape that takes on human form

I freestyled over cassettes without a hesitant guess
When suburban Australia hadn't accepted it yet
I never was a follower I read up on philosophers
I read books and wrote raps and neither one was popular
Pro skater or rapper people thought that I was stupid
They thought I was a clown and too unorganised to do shit
A slacker with my studies but inside a straight nerd
So all my teachers thought I cheated when I came first
And every single person would doubt my ambition
With as much hope as breaking out of Alcatraz prison
And career advisers were severely bias
Cause it was clear that I was a punk destined for years of violence
The first cut cuts deepest in your upbringing
My art perceived as drug dealers or thugs stealing
I snuck in underage to bust free's and dump pingers
Cause for some reason my attitude was unbeaten

But my goals and my dreams they were sort of like a ghost story
'Cos no one believes
And my goals and my dreams they were sort of like a UFO sighting
'Cos no one believes
They're like, ""yeah yeah""
""Okay, alright""
""Whatevs""

Miraculously I found dudes who shared the same head space
And like me they disregarded all the lame templates
We got a local buzz from the shows we done
I was only young sixteen and on a path to blowing up
My little kiddie raps got my friends to interact
And most gigs were packed with skate boarders and hippy cats
A few thousand from blazing a few stages
We made a new album and radio soon played it
And I truly believed that my crew would achieve
The pursuit of my dreams and were due to succeed
But little did I know that the roads long and gets tough
Egos soon grow the love lacks and heads butt
We were like big fish in a small pond
With some worshipping the ground that we walked on
Tall poppy parents couldn't wait to see it to fall off
Waiting for the bubble to pop and see it all gone

But my goals and my dreams they were sort of like a ghost story
'Cos no one believes
And my goals and my dreams they were sort of like a UFO sighting
'Cos no one believes
They're like, ""yeah yeah""
""Okay, alright""
""Whatevs""

I then felt like everything just went south
Kicked out of home, no job, and living on a friends couch
My girl at the time she's sort of my stability
But even she changed of what she thought of my abilities
More a liability a fruitless pursuance
With usage of booze made me viewed as a nuisance
My crew were like a path to a brighter picture
But now we try to figure who's right and fight and bicker
I nearly died when I had to break up the crew
I met those dudes before I had fucking pubes
Every thing the haters wanted was becoming true
Washed up, broke, defeated, and bad luck ensued
So in the end I lost belief in myself
With no time to find anything that could help
It was time to give it up and put my dreams on the shelf
For a voluntary death and to see you in hell

Cold Light Of Day,The Cold Light of Day,2013,"I want to turn this black mourning to a brighter day
I want to turn this dark mind to a lighter shade
Don't want to waste time I want to change lives
I want to take flight from the cold light of day
But my reality hits
And that's were sadness hardship and tragedy lives
I handle my biz with people from the land down under
Some times I'm feeling like a man outnumbered
Work life drudgery hurts like buggery
And hollowing my soul like termites tunneling
Our politicians preach promising purity
The main promise that they keeps followed by cuity
Get it? Promiscuity jokes I make them
But this whole world is the joke I'm raised in
Amazed at the pain it may produce
And so I change, so I change, so I change my tune
It's like...

""Cold""
""Cold light of day""
""Cold light of day""
""Cold light of day""
""Cold light of day""

This is stress release welcome to the rest in peace
The death of my cousin means that I never sleep
McCartney state of mind let it be
With a drink that I flee to like a refugee
But my poisons ain't killing me softly
When I fiend an almighty high - god speed
Truth being the human being is not free
When they're tuned in to heaviness like drop D
Nu metal, new mortar, new concrete
Working like a slave pays for my boss feed
When I should be making you shake your cans like Dondi
But instead I'm the one that's shook - Mobb Deep
I've got to milk my music till I've got cream
Cause my sons eyes are 2Pac - on me
Looking if I've got the goods to raise him properly
While living life at 5th gear in top speed
It's all like...

""Cold""
""Cold light of day""
""Cold light of day""
""Cold light of day""
""Cold light of day""

When I think of all the times that I should have said, ""F it""
I didn't say, ""F it"" instead I gave effort
Careful what you wish for you might just get it
I've spent a lot of life in being Dialectrix
Admittedly my struggles can be quite pathetic
But then again they've lit my soul like pyrotechnical shows
The devil you know will meet us in the future
And if you snooze you lose like fighting Freddie Kruger
I need prosperity for longevity
But prophetically we never see the complexities a head
Getting me to bless Plutonic drum rhythms
And turn pain into euphoric upliftment
My world's at war peace is the obstacle
War is time - constant and unstoppable
Time is my enemy, limiting what's possible
But enemies are friends whenever they're unconquerable

Shadow in the Light,The Cold Light of Day,2013,"Yeah, yeah, uh, uh
Wear the shadow  like me so you can see my vision
Outline a source of portrait definition
I'm put on this planet to paint you my personal picture
Intertwined with rhythm till it's hasta la vista
I'll break it down just like a scene from CSI
Cause I think truth and have a need to speak my mind
I hold a wish that more people realised
And saw through ugliness like Steve Buscemi's Eyes
We get demon eyes and come to jealousy
Political wars, crimes, drugs, felonies
I gain chills but skin bumps to melodies
While the window winds was sweeter than the soft smell of spring

Not all good, not all bad
Yo I see through the vision of man
(It's the yin and the yang)
Not all good, not all bad
Yo I'm thankful for freedom I have
(Yes the freedom I have)
Yeah, nah, it's not all good and then
Yeah, nah, it's not all bad, ok?
The shadow and light, the shadow in the light now
The shadow and light, the shadow in the light now

Sun shine the light that I see
Bright in the dark like night and lightning
Come from vision my eyes providing
But man can't see when he blinded by greed

Our sun shine the light that I see
Bright in the dark like night and lightning
Come from vision my eyes providing
But man can't see when he blinded by greed

Yeah, yo, yo, yo, yo
A dystopia woke from exposure
Camera mind document it when focused
This corrosive human implosion
Building  sever is still growing
Big numbers climb like cliff jumpers
It's hard to ignore control and injustice
Simplistic pleasures hide a swift judgement
Spliff, Dr. Pepper, sushi or Mythbusters
From our day to day life decisions
Religious indifference, conflict of the spirit
Colourful souls kaleidoscopic world visions
We still can't deny the beauty living within a jar

Not all good, not all bad
Yo I see through the vision of man

Not all good, not all bad
Yo I'm thankful for freedom I have

First World Venom,The Cold Light of Day,2013,"Yo I step out to get in gonna claim the night as mine
Revitalise my soul by force feeding it cyanide
Not in a literal sense it's the kind of line I make up
To put a visual sight inside your mind
Green light off the leash roaming the streets
Taking in the poison like were soaking in bleach
No longer sober as the cohorts we meet socially greet
A toaster of drinks what I've chosen to be
Those who work hard and play hard they know what I mean
You go to release that tension as it grows in the week
Bars and pubs they take our money like a poker machine
And I can't settle petal this kettles blowing off steam
Butane on a plate is gonna get my head spinning
Nek Minute Excellent
Becks sipping and exhibiting energy
And while that sweat dripping in festivity revelry

Another night that I've wasted being wasted
Blight of the first world venom
Another night gone and I can't replace it
Should have stayed at home and not left it
Check it, all I need's a second to wreck it
More, more venom

We can't replace the time it takes to detonate
Detonating our bomb with party time when lead astray
I renovate a self medicating meditation
And put in place of educational demonstration
Every sip from a glass like a kick in the arse
And killing me faster to harbour silly debacles
Swigging with rhythm of the dizziest rascal
Till my liver and kidneys shit it and pickled in jars
So pass out regret it acidic and harmful
Half arse awake as I sit on a bar stool
Harsh idiot arse hole gritty as charcoal
And thinking when I'm drinking that I'm king of the castle
But I'm not I'm a joke and reason that I'm broke
Is the reason that I cope with demons that I know
So I glorify nothing son it ain't a pretty picture
Swimming pools of liquor and I'm diving in the mixture

Another night that I've wasted being wasted
Blight of the first world venom
Another night gone and I can't replace it
Should have stayed at home and not left it
Check it, all I need's a second to wreck it
More, more venom
Come on bro
Bartender, yo can I have two tequilas for the two handsome men at the bar here
 of time

Slow slow down down low smoked out
Heart tick like a metronome merry go round
Room spin mood rude crude crew ask 'Who is him?'
Make a prude pure type like all my pure sin
Lure so alluring moves getting fewer from the sewer I be spewing in
Cure of the lunatics full moon move back goon bag hooligan
That's not a Nurofen nor is it a eucalyptus, this bud
No cuz round ones ludicrous speed up mind blur
Out of my jurisdiction been there been back and moving in
But I'm going up when I'm out and I'm doing this
Oh and feels son good when I'm in this madness
Yeah in an unreal world with our messed habits
I'm a good guy but I'm tricked by badness
So I'm a messed up man when the venom happens
Being wasted

Another night that I've wasted being wasted
Bight of the first world venom
Another night gone and I can't replace it
Should have stayed at home and not left it
Check it, all I need's a second to wreck it
More, more venom

I have the alcohol in me

I'm Joe Galuvao 'cause I'm behind the props
You think that style you got is fly but I just write it off
So what's this (fashion?) that you're bragging about?
You think you're swaggin' on some tight shit, my jeans bagging you out
Rich kiddies use their parent's credit card and banking account
To try to match the charisma of what I have in my sound
And it is clear we are here and appear
Re-arranging style to give our scene a re-up
I proceed to redirect a teeny trend to be a leader
Standing on my own two to burn like gonorrhoea
Your heart is in to stay true, that's laughable, go pay dues

Not a follower of pre-written politicin', nup

Or sections out of the bible, I'm repping a sound that's tribal

Wanna check this weapon's a cerebellum? Step in the dojo
Better make connections with dots, struck gold when the X marks it
Don't fiend for the spotlight and not sold by the next bastard
That's moulded on pop stars, shot holes in their chest target
Stop holding your breath, soon they'll be rolling the red carpet

My World,The Cold Light of Day,2013,"When I first started out it was me and this art
No thing in this world could keep us apart
It's a key to my heart healing my scars
Why I breathe every breath why reach for the stars
It's no sport and it ain't no game
It's not to be cool for the fame nor pay
It's raising the bar with an aim on improvement
While losing the time that it's taking to do this
But I'm sick of this ridiculous
Inhibitance and bitterness I'm living with
So I get it out when I'm going in
Going in on the passion I hold within
Don't mistake that kindness for weakness
I'm mean when I'm riding this beat kid
Fighting my demons rhyme and the reason
Rising above and defining achievement

I go in to go win
Slaving away on a way to the top
I go in to go win
Never going to stop never gonna stop - stop
I go in to go win
Slaving away on a way to the top
I go in to go win
Never going to stop never gonna stop - stop

And the world is a hazardous place
With ravenous animals rats in a race
And they have us all captured to assimilate
And distract from the fact that were trapped in our cages
With grog, toxins, and poisons
There's bosses, jobs, and employers
There's cops, doctors, and lawyers
I watch with a loss of enjoyment
As I had to deal with death
Deal with the stress of feeling depressed
Raising my child in a world where the rich stay
Rich with the rest of the people in debt
Knock back comes real in the flesh
Bringing pain that I need to express
That keeps me in check, puts me to the test
When I speak from the heart as it beats in my chest

I go in to go win
Slaving away on a way to the top
I go in to go win
Never going to stop never gonna stop - stop
I go in to go win
Slaving away on a way to the top
I go in to go win
Never going to stop never gonna stop - stop

I'm taking control
To try break the control
Yo I'm taking control
To try break the control
I'm taking control
To try break the control
Yo I'm taking control
To try break the control

I could be on a path of destruction
With turning a blind eye part of my custom
But instead I work and I starve with the hunger
And won't sit around on my arse doing nothing
Ha I stand while you sit
Plan while you quit, advance while you slip
Slave to the grind my attitude lift
I'm in and I'm winning this championship
I ain't gonna take this no more
Stuck in a rut with these sickening thoughts
No view from a crystal ball
Just running a gauntlet to risk it all
From my burdened years that have hurt the dearest
I've learned perseverance to earn my clearance
My works worth is clear from my first appearance
The worst turns my gears to emerge as fearless

I go in to go win
Slaving away on a way to the top
I go in to go win
Never going to stop never gonna stop - stop
I go in to go win

How many worthy of heaven, no not - not - not one
Gettin' realer by the second in the future

Now these are thoughts here of one man thinking
Indulging in the act and just letting his mind roam
A lifeboat in the eye of a cyclone, just another freak of nature that's living the sideshow
When it's the primal in the instincts, survival of the fittest
We're segregated gene pools divided by religion
I know that no one makes you in the likeness of their image
When accumulated lies like proprietary business
So many unforgiven too many underprivileged
With oligarchy structures we call the ""justice system""
We implement conformity toward destructive 
Being alpha male, top dog, number one positions
Stability, fragility, facility analyst
Of what is right and wrong are moralistically accurate
From our downfalls to collateral damage
To the Lord of The Flies with these habits of savages

How many worthy of heaven, no not one

How many worthy of heaven, no not one

Tragedy and comedy masking the same faces
Self-centred entity sinning depraved natures
Tradition and our history stays to remain sacred
But I'm staying independent and thinking in grey spaces
I call a spade a spade and day-to-day I say I hate
The people who have paved the way to turn us to a race of slaves
Where mystified and too many apocalyptic lives
Through fear and simplify the mind of an infant child
Just like a test tube with models that connects glue
And set the foundations that supporting a select few
Thoughts bleed like flesh wounds to get through what's wrong and evil
All the people gone deceitful and beyond retrieval
Lacking a choice in the vacuous void
With no plan to enjoy higher powers employ
They facilitate the ways that leave the planet destroyed
This is one man's thoughts through the sound of a voice

How many worthy of heaven, no not one
How many worthy of heaven, no not one

How many worthy of heaven, no not one
(See through fallacy with my x-ray vision)
Gettin' realer by the second in the future

Please go to your colour-coded tram which will take you to the world of your choice. While you are there, please feel free to indulge your every whim. Nothing can go wrong
Ha ha ha ha, it is I. I bred you, I made you
I looked into the face of the force that put the idea in your mind
You're bred and lead yourself
We've all been lost and reused and  and amused

Wrong Turn,,2008,"Before I sat and relaxed in this peaceful state
There's many things which I had to alleviate
There's many things that were hard to release with change
Most of us don't learn the easy way
I've had my fair share of drugs and my fair share of violence
Fair share of pubs, clubs, and all-nighters
Relationships - they made me skitz
But I stomach the downfalls and take them in
It's a puzzling world, it's hard to make shit fit
It's a challenge like a parent trying to raise ten kids
It's one step forwards and two steps backwards
And, what's important, we soon stop to practice
I've been a boy, and a man who got burned
And I've seen the barren landscape of a wrong turn
I'm only 21, I've got a lot more to learn
And I'm sure I'll learn more in the long-term
It's like:

Sometimes we take a wrong turn
If we try we can get back on track again
And faults in the past can lead to improvement
Learn from mistakes and just keep moving
Sometimes we take a wrong turn
If we try we can get back on track again
And faults in the past can lead to improvement
Learn from mistakes and just keep moving

If you were there, and saw how my family split
When my world crashed down, and calamity hit
You would've seen the tragic detour
Down the liquid devil river lighting wicks to my c4
Vice was a bottle and that's what I reached for
Lost in oblivion move ignorantly forward
'till I backtracked and re-formed
And the journey gave a new appreciation to a clean norm
A lot of people see shit in their lives
I find the dark days give a definition of light
I find the dark days and the truly miserable times
Are the ones that give us strength and the will to survive
And at the time it might not be easy, I know this
When all avenues will seem hopeless
With all these sensations, experimentation
Can lead to the road less taken

Sometimes we take a wrong turn
If we try we can get back on track again
And faults in the past can lead to improvement
Learn from mistakes and just keep moving
Sometimes we take a wrong turn
If we try we can get back on track again
And faults in the past can lead to improvement
Learn from mistakes and just keep moving

I'm no preacher, no saint, no teacher, no sage
And I know it's cliché but no pain, no gain
I've learned to accept some things won't change
But you've got a chance though, if you hold faith
I don't know my destination yet, I bet
I'll make plenty of mistakes again and again
I respect that with faith you won't see what's ahead
You won't learn a lesson if you hold the press
I guess it's just a mixed bag, draw it up
When you travel down life and the course is rough
When we don't know we hold support for us
When we don't know what type of wars will come
And you gotta keep moving on
Even when the turns that we take are the ones that are wrong
It's the ones that are wrong that are keeping us strong
So we get to the place we belong

Sometimes we take a wrong turn
If we try we can get back on track again
And faults in the past can lead to improvement
Learn from mistakes and just keep moving
Sometimes we take a wrong turn
If we try we can get back on track again
And faults in the past can lead to improvement
Learn from mistakes and just keep moving
Sometimes we take a wrong turn
If we try we can get back on track again
And faults in the past can lead to improvement
Learn from mistakes and just keep moving
Sometimes we take a wrong turn
If we try we can get back on track again
And faults in the past can lead to improvement
Learn from mistakes and just keep moving
