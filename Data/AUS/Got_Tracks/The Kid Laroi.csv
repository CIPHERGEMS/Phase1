I wake up and count my

I wake up and count my blessings, never stressing
I wake up I pray to God lead me in the right direction
Yeah, wake up I count my
Blessings, never stressing
I wake up I pray to God hoping that he get my message, yeah
I've been on the low, low, low
I do not know, know, know
Just what I want, want, want
So got me Lord, Lord, Lord
I’ve been on the low, low, low
I do not know, know, know
Just what I want, want, want
So got me Lord, Lord, Lord

No one ever saw the vision
Told me I was too young
Too calm in this game
But I envisioned something different
Yeah they turned me down
Told me I was tripping
Now we planning trips
And plotting on the mission
And because of my age, man there's been division
They say pave the way, man that's my decision
Never been forced
Honestly its sickenin’
Now they making claims (They making claims)
Man that's so insane
Talking about I changed
But I've been this way
They said your dream's too big
Now take a look at what I did
About to take over the game
No questions boy, that's it

I wake up and count my blessings, never stressing
Every night I pray to God lead me in the right direction
Yeah, wake up and count my
Blessings, never stressing
I wake up I pray to God hoping that he get my message, yeah
I been on the low, low, low
I do not know, know, know
Just what I want, want, want
So got me Lord, Lord, Lord
I been on the low, low, low
I do not know, know, know
Just what I want, want, want
So got me Lord, Lord, Lord

I know they hatin'
I pay them no attention
They trying to imitate me
But I should probably mention
There's only one little kid
Couldn't care less about what you did
Or what you doing honestly
Too concentrated on my biz
I don’t got time for their games
Don’t pay no mind to these lames
I'm in my own separate lane
I mean I’m just saying
I'm gonna put in honest work
I've seen how far I can get
See all the hate it don't work
We got the platinum on set

I wake up and count my blessings, never stressing
Every night I pray to God lead me in the right direction
Yeah, wake up and count my
Blessings, never stressing
I wake up I pray to God hoping that he get my message, yeah

Boss Up,14 With A Dream,2018,"Yo -
Yo, what’s up what’s up?
Nah, I’m at the studio right now
N-Nah, but I’ll give you a call after the session
Alright, bye

Damn!
Isn’t it funny how far I came?
Told me my dream was a reach
So I reached for the stars and it since hasn’t been the same
And ever since I paved my own lane
They’ve been looking for directions
And ever since they’ve tried to clone me
But they don’t got the same connection (WOOO!)
Haven’t been posting on Instagram
Keep myself secluded from the rest of them
Hitting up my line, they keep pestering
They ask for features, well it just depends
‘Bout to be a boss in this business
‘Bout to be a cost just to witness
Yeah, you popping now, enjoy it while you can
It’ll last for 5 minutes (Yeah)
I swear
Had this dream all my life, convinced myself to chase it
Now things are starting to happen
And I’m making moves and landing all these placements
Landing in all these new places
God damn, it’s outrageous
I’ve been in it for a minute
Trynna get it, I just gotta have patience

Boss up, boss up, the young boy dun bossed up!
Bossed up, boss up, the young boy dun bossed up!
Boss up, bossed up, the young boy dun bossed up!

Disconnect (Demo),14 With A Dream,2018,"Yeah, ooh
Yeah, hold on
Yeah
Let me tell it
Okay, yeah
Yeah
Yeah

All I wanted was respect
Just want to be accept-ed
Too focused on being perfect
And now that I reflect
I was blind and I shouldn’t have listened to what you said
Now there’s a disconnect
Between me and you
Now I’m true to myself
And I make my own moves
I used to try and be cool
Impress the kids at school
But I wasn’t being true to my Goddamn roots
(Hol' up)

I speak from my heart, not my throat
I said no longer I’d be told the person I am
Still finding myself, I really don’t need you to hold me back
No holding me back, no more discussions 'bout that
Boy it’s a wrap
Used to worry about so called “friends”, but they’d never hit me back
Like damn
Look at how far I’ve come
But I’ve only just begun
I tried to run from the person that I was
Goddamn, how I was so dumb
But I don’t need your judgement
Was somebody I wasn’t
But now I’m here to change that
And take over the country, oh man

All I wanted was respect
Just want to be accept-ed
Too focused on being perfect
And now that I reflect
I was blind and I shouldn’t have listened to what you said
Now there’s a disconnect between me and you

I was lookin' out for way too many (lookin' out)
So I started looking up, hopefully my uncle hear me
God damn just thinkin' 'bout him gets me teary
'Cause I remember that last conversation that we had so clearly

He said; ""Boy you got a dream so go and make it work
If you listen to them others they gon' put you in the dirt
Yeah they always be watchin', quietly they'll lurk
And I want you to remember this until you're in a hearse""
I said; ""Okay I got a dream, so I'ma make it work

And I promise I'll remember 'til I'm all up in a hearse"", ah yeah

Yea-uh, now they tryna tag along
I can not mess with that 'cause dey ain't always been around
Couldn't care about  but  to them all
From the studio to the stage you know that I shut it down
Woah, hold up, wait a minute, just spare me the moment
My uncle told me; ""Get it, put your stamp on it and own it""
And I told him ""yeah I get it"", at the time I didn't know but
I'm all the way up and to him I kinda owe it

The Valley*,Unreleased Songs,2020,"Lyrics from snippet



Ridin' around the valley playin' cheeky with my brothers
You be acting funny like your mantra I don't trust it
I fuck with lil' shawty but I wouldn't say I love her
How am I too in love with all these racks up in the dozen
Shawty I'm a dog, put that on god, time for cover
Starting to feel in love, so I might decide to cut her
Ridin' around my whole city listening to the cutter
I will never learn, I just keep on gettin' caught up

I will never change, never switch up on my brothers
They've been there from the start, ever since the boy had nothin'
That's why I tell them come and get these racks up by the dozen
That's why shawty in love so you know I can not trust her
Loyalty and love is lost, nowadays our eyes are crossed
Yeah, they doubt us 'til they brace us, was never down in the mud
Yeah, I told them to be patient but they never listen once
Yeah, they was chasin' fun but I was just chasin' funds

Ridin' around the valley playin' cheeky with my brothers
You be acting funny like your mantra I don't trust it
I fuck with lil' shawty but I wouldn't say I love her

Love
People are gettin' caught in love
People are gettin' caught in love
People are gettin' caught in love

I didn't even gotta say, she already know what's 
She say, ""you look so damn young, how'd you get up in this club?""
Oh now, oh now, oh now 
Yeah, bitch I'm young, rich and handsome
I got funny on my hearth
Is she aware, that actually I don't care about my hair
All I see, she just see all the dollar signs in her head
Trap bands all the time, but we never had a dime
Used to fuck with her arrest, now  let me come inside

Ridin' around the valley playin' cheeky with my brothers
You be acting funny like your mantra I don't trust it
I fuck with lil' shawty but I wouldn't say I love her
How am I too in love with all these racks up in the dozen

Moving,,2019,"I'm tryna do it, so
People who are making dope shit can literally do the same as me
But in order to do that, the world needs to open up to Australia first
There's a lot of things in Australia that people have misconceptions about
And I say that breaking those barriers is the key to opening up Australia to the world
Cause it's not all like, Kangaroos and deadly animals and shit
Yeah, Australia needs somebody that
Nah, a group of people that
I guess open up everything for the rest of the people
(World first)

I've been movin' so damn quickly
I've been getting in my bag, I guess
Ooh, execute the plan all day
I can't get caught in all the games, I got no plans to rest
Ooh, not until I pass the test
Let me tell you that
I've been movin', I've been movin'

Move
I swear to God I've been on the move
It feel like I'm livin' out a movie
Almost like it's too good to be true
Now I can't lose, no more
Blue ticks in my inbox, silver tick  the hat
Like a dog from the pound boy
I done came from out the back, yeah
Motherfuckin' high stats, I'm on a song with Skies
I'm winnin' in real life

I secure the bag, I'm poppin' tags, I guess
Shawty lookin' from the side, I'm 'bout the bags, you bitch
Yeah, my doors are suicide, she tried to crash the whip
I'ma motherfuckin' spend it, nigga, look at how I'm livin'
Made it because I'm gifted
I told my momma, ""Stop trippin, I'm putting food in the kitchen""
Times I thought I lost it, I asked God for forgiveness
Niggas acting like bitches and we ain't with all the bitchin'!
Yeah, mad 'cause my money long
I'ma make right my wrongs
I'ma get high, no bongs
It's lit, light
And she gon' suck me off
Baby girl neck too strong
Tell me she love my songs
I hit, aight

Bet you was talking down
I got them talkin' now
I guess it's workin' now
It's lit, light
What ever goes around
Finally comes back around
And back and back around

Too Much,,2019,"Just the other day, shit was all cool
Now I can't catch a break, thinking 'bout you
I promised that I wouldn't, but I ran back to you
'Cause one more night alone, just might not be good for
What got into you? Why you acting brand new for?
And what I ever do? Maybe I just took it too far
I did fall apart, maybe I was a little too much
And now I'm thinking too much, drank a little too much

But I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
And I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
'Cause it's all a little too much, and I'm in need of your love
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you

You used to say it was forever, I remember
Tryna' forget, I can't forget ya
Still got your makeup on my sweater
And I know that it's all over
But memoriеs live forever
For thе worse or for the better
Can't let you go, my heart won't let her
Can't let you go and you know it
Yeah, I put my all in
I gave you whatever
Gave you my heart and you broke it, yeah
You were so selfish, did nothing to help me
And I was so blinded, but I couldn't help it

Her name in my brain
I'll never leave her alone, no way
No you can't go back home, you're with me
When you're not here, can't sleep, can't breathe, can't think
I can't seem to think of a world without we
Vision cloudy, you need me
I need you more
The girl in my dream
The girl from my dream
Is sittin' right next to me, next to me
Is sittin' right next to me, next to me
The girl of my dreams
Is sittin' right next to me, next to me
Shout your name in hills in the valley
Whole world's gonna know you love me
Scream your name across the galaxy
Now the universe know that I'm on the same thing
Shout your name in hills in the valley
Whole world's gonna know you love me
Scream your name across the galaxy
Now the universe know that I'm on the same thing

But I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
And I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you

WINNING,,2019,"Yeah

I been focused way too much
Need to get out, need to do something
Feels like I'm going distant
Music made the pain too numb
Money bringing out the demons
Life-changing, never seen it
My life changed in an instant
Never been the same since then
That's why I do what I do
Not for the Bentley coupe, nah
Not for the Louis V shoes
This for my Mum and the crew, yeah
Used to be tight like glue
But I dun went and switched up on you
But not because I wanted to
But not because I wanted to

And now I'm all up in mine
I tell myself lies constantly
I been fighting
All of these demons that are dancing inside
Bawling my eyes

Rest up in paradise

But I haven't lost myself

But I'm not talking wealth
And they still chuck their dirt
But I still got my stealth
And as long as I got myself
I don't need no one else
I pour my pain on these pages
And I been doing it for ages
Deaf ears to what they're saying
Never given to me, had to take it

But not because I wanted to
