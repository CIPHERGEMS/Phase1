You know I do this everyday!
Everyday, everyday
Me and my squad, we don't play
Roll up to the club and pour some chardonnay
You know I do this everyday

We don't really mean to be flexing
Got a merc' but I roll with Alexis
I do not chase and I show no love but I see a couple O's with my X's
I been down my whole life and I'm still tryna build like tetris
The boy so fly but down to earth like ancestors
Hol up

I been tryna settle but the bitch go down
I been tryna tell these niggas that I'm back and I ain't going nowhere cause I been so wild
Been so wild it's been a while now
Look at all these people on my dick now
Back in high school, I couldn't get a bitch now they all want a piece now, good lord!

I put on for my city and that's everyday

Wake up in the morning, man I gotta get it
I don't waste time, meant it when I said
I'm not the one to call like I'm out of credit
You know my last name Adu like I'm at a wedding
I don't pay mind, don't tax me
If you ain't my girl, don't stress me
If you ain't with the clique then you ain't with the biz bitch
Please don't call or text me
'cause i'm working on the daily swear to God I can not pretend
Gotta be outstanding that's the reason we do not attend
I'm aiming for the stars that's the reason we do not decend
And everyday we pray the lord becomes our closest friend (God damn)

Manifested the dream, now we livin' it
Now I got bigger fish to fry
I been stressin' 'bout this life
Why you wantin' all my time?

Lately, I'm sensitive
I be so negative
I be so reckless
Usually I'm arkin' up
I am the bigger kid
I am the better man
I am embodiment of what the dream is
Ayy, look
If I'm gone, it's gon' be for a reason
I could've stayed for the whole damn season
Hell if I inherit what they beefin'
Look, free Scrap, Raph
Should put your face on a shirt
We put the greats on my merch
We leave the opp in the dirt
Then we left his with his girl, like skrrt, skrrt
Blood, sweat, tears
We put in all of the work
Really we came from the dirt

If you don't bang when the gang kicks shit off (True)

Yeah, this for my bros in the pen' that I see in correction
This shit can get hectic
'70
 my brother, bitch you guessed it
Just another brother on the guest list
They didn't need a rubber, I was destined

I don't wanna brag a little
All the talk is for the little boys
Tell them boys we gotta keep it real
Whole team in the maze
New wave that we'll pave
I ain't tryna say I'm running shit
Cos' all that talk is just irrelevant
Yeah how you feel about the realest yeah
How you think you getting honeys
When you buzzing on the internet
Yeah this new wave's gonna get em' wet
Pause, I run it back and never break a sweat

I can't seem to catch a break, woah
Call my phone you know it's late, yeah
I got so much on my plate, woah
But never living under pressure
We're not falling under pressure
I just count up all the blessings
I can't seem to catch a break, woah
Call my phone you know it's late, yeah
I got so much on my plate, woah
But never living under pressure
We're not falling under pressure
I just count up all the blessings

I just count up all the blessings
Living life is not a stress ting
Never call before you texting
Cos' I don't wanna run a rest ting
See, I got hoes that wanna triple me
Like they don't really got directions
They're just coming with the flexing
And all that shit don't impress me
Get on it, never get reactions
Not even a three dots from the messenger
I don't want it if it's easy
You not fucking with a nigga that's regular
I don't settle for no average
All your man's are so average
I'm humble as fuck but I live it up

I can't seem to catch a break, woah
Call my phone you know it's late, yeah
I got so much on my plate, woah
But never living under pressure
We're not falling under pressure
I just count up all the blessings
I can't seem to catch a break, woah
Call my phone you know it's late, yeah
I got so much on my plate, woah
But never living under pressure

Catch me on the west side
Doing dono's rolling duku in the coupe (aye)
Ski mask like I'm in the snow
Put the ice on my flash like my wrist is broke (ice)
Time ticking in my paper now
Just to get the bag gotta tippy-toe
Every week I got a different hoe (woo)
Every song I gotta different flow (woo)
Bitches acting like they really know me (aye)
Tell me who the fuck you really know?
Kept it real with my niggas
Whipping this work up in this kitchen (whip it)
Tell them Spacely gone shine
