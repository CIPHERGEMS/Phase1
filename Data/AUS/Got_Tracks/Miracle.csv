Endless Summer,,2014,"We are setting for the endless summer
'Cause even when it's gone, we see the color

Feels like it was only yesterday
When we didn't had bills to pay
And we couldn't even guessed the day
Have a little sense to blow the stress away
Warm breeze in the palm trees
And I could feel your heat on me
Remember people used to want me
But I was too dark for sun screen
And I'm on other beach from here
Sunshine, can you take me there?
Sunshine, can you take me where
The Sun is always shinning and the sky is clear, (yeah)
Every year get brighter, temperature a little higher
Yeah, you can burn like lighters
And have my heart on fire

We are setting for the endless summer
'Cause even when it's gone, we see the color

Feels like it was only yesterday,
When we were having the best of days
Woke up feeling blessed today
The sun's out for the best of today
With the message all clear,
Hoping you could chill all year
But your five fly doesn't run the whole world
Hoping you still can hear
Some reason some reason you're going with the season
In winter I'm freezing
There's no air, no breathing
Yeah, every year get brighter, temperature a little higher
Yeah, you can burn like lighters
And have my heart on fire, yeah

We are setting for the endless summer
'Cause even when it's gone, we see the color

It was only yesterday
When I had you next to me
The air never tasted so sweet
Cold drinks more beats, that's the recipe!
Now you're getting so much brighter
Uhm, temperature a lot higher
Uhm, I fell in love with summer
Yeah, she had my heart on fire.

Feel the summer, hope it last forever now
Forever now!
If we can find the piece inside, we'll settle down
Settle down!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

We are setting for the endless summer
'Cause even when it's gone, we see the color
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!",https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/31579969/Miracle/Endless+Summer
The Seventeen Nineties,,2018,"Gaudy hotel pattern
Makes you feel secure in nostalgic immersion
The jewel of the lotus
Multi-storey carping
Metallic erosion

A universal destiny
Spinning crazily back through time to the Seventeen Nineties

An arcing curiosity
From the tempting dessert menu variety
Some details of his history and a wealth of life in good facilities

Using local materials
Pick a part and get a job in the ministry

Perambulating river
Taking note of the cherubic faces
Always looking for kindness
Narrative uniformity in the archetypal",https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34683489/Miracle/The+Seventeen+Nineties
The Parsifal Gate,,2018,"The cenobite tamed
Megastructural reign
The Parsifal Gate
Realtime has ceased
At the Godhead's feet
Determining the separators

Where did you get the notion that time could turn into space?

Reclothing the emperor
The multiverse manifest in hypostasis

Libera me Domine
Uh huh",https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34683493/Miracle/The+Parsifal+Gate

And drop these bows on that joker jepper pickin' wit' me

(It's huntin' season) 

(My lungs ain't weezin')
(My heart ain't seazin')

[Chorus]
We bout to lay 'em down 'cause it's huntin' season 
We bout to lay these haters down 
We bout to lay these bitches down ('cause it's huntin' season)

I off this shit and fuckin' wonder if I die early 
I got my blessings every day that I was able to be 
Now sit in jail or well should I say in the pits of hell 
Stuck up in the stank cell with no motherfuckin' bail 
I done been there before 
I ain't goin' back no fuckin' more 
Sleepin' on them cold floors 
Teach these niggas 
F*ck this ho 
Say they can kiss my asshole 
Suck my big pinky toe 
Somebody gotta let them know 
Niggas ain't takin' this shit no more 
Say how is it they can drag us around 
Sticks up in our ass 
You done forty-one times 
Hit my head then sag 
Quick to point the fuckin' finger 
Quick to set every nigga 
Y'all ain't bang drank liquor 
How the f*ck do they figure 
When they bang fuckin' triggers 
Jealous guns I did nigga 
Man pistol swore niggas 
Every glock and six figures 
Judge when you look he in his eye 
Not because you think he high 
It ain't right to take a life 
Just because a man ain't white 
How is it they can kill us and then motherfuckin' walk 
Get suspended with pay 
Lie and say it ain't so 
Set that fed bullshit 
We gonna see who get dick 
Label me a lunatic 
F*ck that injustice shit 

[Chorus: x3]

It's lame ain't it 'cause 
Matter fact it's fucked up 
There ain't no fuckin' war on drugs 
It's to light our ass up 
If I'm guilty then I'm guilty 
If I'm not then I'm not 
In the end it only matters what loyal that I got 
I ain't gonna do the damn crime 
If I can't pay the damn fine 
Let you point your damn hand 
Have you lost your fuckin' mind 
I ain't mad at you for it 
I'm just tryin' to let you know 
When they close that cell door 
There ain't no son let me go 
I'm gonna tell you what I know 
Not some shit I fuckin' wrote 
You gonna do the damn time 
Rain sleet fuckin' snow 
So ride with no dope 
If you black that's a no 
Get somebody that's white 'cause they won't get pulled over 
How much can a man take? 
Before his soul fuckin' break 
And he think bein born is his worst fuckin' mistake 
Stick to milds 'cause he brown 
Never smile always frown 
Keep his head down low 
Don't know where he want to go 
So he turned to the blow 
Now that's all that he know 
Tell me what's his breakin point 
Every time he let go 
Should I fear for my life 
When I go out at night 
Why they take away my rights 
Give me no money to fight 
Am I that damn right 
Am I high as a kite 
I ain't puffin at the mouth 
Y'all know I'm fuckin' right 
Now how is thay can kill us and motherfuckin' walk 
Get suspended with pay 
And lie and say it ain't so 
Set that fed bullshit 
We gonna see who get dick 
Label me a lunatic 
F*ck that injustice shit

We finna do this 

hook
Bounce, bounce, bounce if you're with me nigga (4x)
Okay, okay
Want war, what's up?
Want to fight, nigga what?
Niggas like y'all talk too much, scared to buck, like to f*ck
Here I am, here I go, defeat me, hell no
Try though, watch yo', you'll see, die slow
Give a f*ck what you know, who you know, how you know
I do though want to know, do you got it, where it grow
I stay blowed, Optimo, Elbro, (?), dry bud, pepper weed
And I'm crunk, hydro
Shit, give me a leaf,f*ck swisher sweet 
Your Louisi-Anna, I'm Texas Pete
F*ck obsolete, nigga too discrete
Sit back and pastor when the 'Port chief
Nigga f*ck peace, love beef, dinner time, let's eat
I'm the only one on the seat, ohh no that's me
Who dare test me, show yourself, be ready to bleed
I hope your strapped, I hope your deep, I taste sweet, I spell defeat
Freak chicks love this, more than stiff dick
This here my shit, my advice, f*ck this
Motherfucker

hook
Been here, been real, know the facts, see the deal
My only goal, to rip a mill', my only fear is what I kill
Thou who test me, please Lord, keep blessin' me
Never forsake me, deliver thee from the thy enemies
Help me, misery, nightmares, agony
This the pain I see, make it stop, make it leave
Georgia Boys, Real McCoy, Miracle with Pastor Troy
Ain't no Tonka toy, nuclear, we'll destroy
Ain't no stopping me, the only way, kill me
And either way, best to believe, every nigga gonna feel me
Bump this shit when they bury, and leave the funeral smokin' weed
That's how we mourn in the A-you-G, oh no it's DSGB
A nigga like me love to ball, never fall, stand tall
I done came out the south, had my back againt the wall
F*ck the buck, a hundred fall, shot this nigga in the fall
Label me above the law, money is my only cause
Yeah, I'm a real nigga, f*ck the Tommy Hilfiger
Glen Hill made nigga, red eyed dope dealer
Punk me out, bitch I stick this pistol in your mouth
Beat you 'till you pass out, kick your fucking grill out
Violence what I'm all about, f*ck a quarter, f*ck a ounce
750 all day, ain't got it, bitch bounce

hook
I'm a Cougar not Puma
Fucking mice and not nice
I blazed my motherfucking writing so they couldn't read my mind
I was bad as a kid, thank the Lord for filthy kids
And I never got the thanking for shit that I did
I was more than willing unfortunantly not that able
y'all niggas sporting that Polo, I sport that Knight Of The Round Table
Took my partner in school, ran that bitch up my sleeve
Told the teacher ""Bitch, f*ck you, I'll listen when I please!""
A nigga can't bother flexin', ain't nothin' but shit in my hood
I push a motherfucking Honda, but that bitch run good
My Ho' takes me where I need to go, rain, sleet, hail, snow
In the winter, see the bed, in the summer slow hoe
What you know about them gold triple D's hundred spoke
Window down, system pumping, puffin' on an Optimo
Hell, I'm blowed, head to toe, 'bout to let y'all niggas know
Sitting up in the studio, f*ck that shit, lets start the show
Hell, I got to let it go, we ain't playing
WE AIN'T PLAYING

Miracle,,2000,"If you're gonna save the day
And you're hearing what I say
I feel your touch, your kiss
Is not enough

And if you believe in me,
Don't think my love's for free
I won't take nothing less
Than a deeper love

Let me tell you
You know I,
I need a miracle
I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to feel from you

Let me tell you
You know I,
I need a miracle
I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to get me through
Tell me that you understand
And you'll take me as I am
You'll always be the one
To give me everything

Just when I thought no one cared
You're the answer to my prayers
You lift my spirits high
Come on and rescue me
