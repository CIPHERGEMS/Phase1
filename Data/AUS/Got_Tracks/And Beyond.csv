Clouds,,2016,"Feeling like Malcolm in the middle
John Doe spit a riddle
Sky falling on me you can call me chicken little
People don't understand I'm sticking to a plan
I'm a prostitute to the system, I work for the man
Because the system pays to fuck me every chance that it can
Don't want to be another slave, a copy, another Stan, I'm not a serious black man, half cast to Azkaban
One look at my complexion, and they call me fucking tan
Starting writing lyrics, I'm feeling like the man
Shitty song on footy loops my brother's Toucan Sam
Comparing you to me I'm just a grain of sand
If you tell me we'll never make it, then I'll prove it that we, Can
P-s-y-c-h-o have too many one night stand friends they come and they go
Fuck with my mental
Momentos of why I started making music with my kinfolk
Skip that weak shit, I'm only spitting innuendos
Who am I, tell me who I need to be
Never fit in any crowd 'cause I'm too low key
I can't open up my heart 'cause I'm too lonely
I struggle to understand how you can love me for, Me
And that's the shit that fucks me up
What the fuck can I do my minds running a muck
It's like I'm stuck, I need to figure out what I'm doing
My passion is my purpose and that's what I'm pursuing

Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?
How will I ever know if I never fucking try?
Reasonable doubt is like the cloud in my eye
I'm questioning these thoughts but never have a reason why


I'm not the type to try and live my life and one day regret it
Feeling sympathetic inferior feelings, feeling magnetic
Attracting pathetic fakes, people acting synthetic
It's not the sort of pain you numb with local antistatic
I, question myself
Question my mental health
Question if these feeling are stuck with anyone's else
It's like there's a, price on my soul and if that shit sells, I'll know devil too well if my perception is, hell
Aggression, depression I've had this shit since adolescents
I had to make mistakes for them to add to lessons
But now I'm stuck in the past and it's affecting the present
I pray my oppression, lesson, I'm under lucifer's possession
Caressing this sick mental
Never been sentimental
Police take down my credentials 'cause I'm way too temperamental
Spit on instrumentals
Write down lyrics until I'm paid for shit I've thought
I guess that's being fundamental
Imploding into my temple
I'm putting my thoughts central
So when I spit a verse nothing ends up confidential
I've got potential, sharpen my mind like a pencil
Shavings go into a verse to try and match the tempo
I try & erase my thoughts but I rub too gentle
People acting like they don't know me, how coincidental
A bunch of fake, fakes, fake smiles from my dental
Trying to give a fuck is me being experimental

Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?
How will I ever know if I never fucking try?
Reasonable doubt is like the cloud in my eye
I'm questioning these thoughts but never have a reason why",https://genius.com/And-beyond-clouds-lyrics
See You Later,,2020,"You won't see me, focus on my paper
You don't need me, I'ma see you later
Gettin' in deeper, add another layer
Know there's things that I just need to say to ya

I been sayin' things that I don't really mean to say, yeah
If you fuckin' leave me, I'ma kill myself today, yeah
What's inside myself can't make my problems go away, yeah
Cuttin' people off 'cause I ain't dealin' with the pain, yeah
I been sayin' things that I don't really mean to say, yeah
If you fuckin' leave me, I'ma kill myself today, yeah
What's inside myself can't make my problems go away, yeah
Cuttin' people off 'cause I ain't dealin' with the pain, yeah, yeah

People be callin' me up, ""Where you at?""
I just need to get away and relax (Yeah, yeah)
Sick of bringin' up the past 'cause nothin' nice
In thinkin' 'bout you but I'm not goin' back
Ayy, runnin', runnin', runnin' back
Givin' you meaning, you just need to ask (You just need to ask)
Ayy, keep it movin', way too fast
Tell me why lovin' you feel like a task (Yeah)
Never winnin', runnin' back
Wonderin' when all my feelings will pass
Grippin' your ass, show me some sass
Show me some love if we really can last
How many times did I come and I go?
How many times did you leave me alone? (Yeah?)
How many times did I say that I'll focus
On stacks just to get us to four in a row? (Yeah, yeah)
Lately, we been in the wrong
Hit up a bitch when I been in the low
Now that your winnings are low
Put it up on the 'gram just to put in the show
I just been livin' to grow
No longer sleepin' with demons no more
Stuck with this thought in my head when I'm goin' to bed that I'm not even livin' no more
Heart in palpitation, missin' conversations
Skippin' a beat, I ain't writin' no more (Yeah, yeah)
Had an awkward situation that I'm facin'
Lookin' at me, well, I'm hittin' the floor (Ayy, ayy)
'Cause I'd rather see you naked, I'm faded
And lookin' at pictures and burnin' them all
Life is on the line, she told me many times
If you leaving me, I ain't livin' more (Yeah, yeah)
Ride or die for this, do you really wanna die for this?
I've been livin' two lives, I would die for this, but
She ain't got no time for this, uh
Think it's been six days
Six months turnin' into sixteen days
6th of May, gotta change my ways
Got six-six-six on my mind all day
Wanna speak in tongues like what I say
Wanna get the message, what I say
Wanna see us go our separate ways
Wanna have to act like it's okay
Wanna press rewind or hit replay
Wanna live for the moments, I can't say
But when we haven't spoke for years
Is this all that I need to say? Hey

Take me to the blossom where there ain't no time
And we're sittin' on the trees where the sun gonna shine and
Every conversation make you spill your wine
But as long as you got me, I'm hittin' up your line
Take me to the blossom where there ain't no time
And we're sittin' on the trees where the sun gonna shine and
Every conversation make you spill your wine
But as long as you got me, I'm hittin' up your line

You won't see me, focus on my paper
You don't need me, I'ma see you later
Gettin' in deeper, add another layer
Know there's things that I just need to say to ya

I been sayin' things that I don't really mean to say, yeah
If you fuckin' leave me, I'ma kill myself today, yeah
What's inside myself can't make my problems go away, yeah
Cuttin' people off 'cause I ain't dealin' with the pain, yeah
I been sayin' things that I don't really mean to say, yeah
If you fuckin' leave me, I'ma kill myself today, yeah
What's inside myself can't make my problems go away, yeah
Cuttin' people off 'cause I ain't dealin' with the pain, yeah, yeah

If you fuckin' leave me, I'ma kill myself today, yeah, yeah",https://genius.com/And-beyond-see-you-later-lyrics
