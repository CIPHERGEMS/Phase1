I am,Maya Jupiter,2010,"I am
A magical, mystical manifestation of life
I am
A professional, powerful lyricist grabbin the mic
I can
Imagine a world where all boys and girls
Have a reason to live
I stand
For justice, equality
Present and past what was and what is
I am

Guiding the ships to shores
In the still of the night
Beams of light
Reflecting
On the past and the stories held
Beneath my waters
Marauders fell
Deep
I am eternally yours
Hand in the jaws
Yearning for freedom just because
It brings me
Closer to the omnipotent one
Love is a tumble thatâ€™s second to none
I stumble and get right up back upon
My feet screaming the words Iâ€™ve heard
I shall overcome
Retreat
Never an option
Stay with concoctions
Love and honesty, truth eruptions
Combining power to kill corruption
Still never missing a beat

I am
A magical, mystical manifestation of life
I am
A professional, powerful lyricist grabbin the mic
I can
Imagine a world where all boys and girls
Have a reason to live
I stand
For justice, equality
Present and past what was and what is
I am

I am..
The shining star
Held by a crescent moon
Bright (brillante)
At high noon
Prayers resonating illuminating
Through the mist of misjudgement
I endeavour for peace
I sing through the voice of the wind
I dream with the hills and the streams
Release me
Into a place where truth lies
See me inside
The eyes of a child
Many miles deep from within the earth
I smile
Patiently waiting
Holding my breath
Feeling the beauty in stillness and depth
Life flows through my body
I know Its something Godly

I am
A magical, mystical manifestation of life
I am
A professional, powerful lyricist grabbin the mic
I can
Imagine a world where all boys and girls
Have a reason to live
I stand
For justice, equality
Present and past what was and what is
I am

Iâ€™m the eyes of the eagle
Perched on the cactus
Snack on the serpent
Food that nurtures
Strength is built and I can not go back
Held by my neck, carried by slack
And broken backs that never grew weak
Folklore sung when forbidden to speak
Hidden identities not how its meant to be
I am forever who I am eternally
Grateful and gracious and patience protects
The future unfolds in a new dialect
As i clutch to the words trying hard to affect
Ink disappears and I can not connect
New cropâ€™s harvest, I must yield
Deep asleep in the old corn fields
Ready to waken the spirit of youth
Powerfully present persistently Truth
I Am",https://genius.com/Maya-jupiter-i-am-lyrics
Smile,,2016,"Home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home

I've been waiting
I've been waiting
To come home again
So now I can smile
So now I can smile

Walking with dignity in the face of the sun
A brilliant light shining down, I have come
Holding the truth in my heart with every beat
And the proof is in every breath that I speak
Do you know what it takes to have no fear?
When you've lost everything you held so dear
If there's a last time, let this be the last crime
The scale is off balance and justice is half blind
We don't create wars, we create life
We exist in spite of the strife
Unrelenting, unbroken
Speaking for all that is unspoken
Under pressure but unsilent and undeterred
Unapologetically demanding to be heard
Unwrapping the layers of what is unseen
Uncover the dirt and come clean
I'm home

I've been waiting
I've been waiting
To come home again
So now I can smile
So now I can smile

It's unbelievable to think how many people
Think that they can get away with such a violent act of hate
I understand in many cases system is complacent
But with these complainants all of that's about to change
It takes strength, courage to speak up and speak out
Truth is on your side beyond a shadow of a doubt
Make something out of misery, now we're making history
Condemn the uncondemned, turn a tragedy to victory",https://genius.com/Maya-jupiter-smile-lyrics
No More,,2010,"Times up won’t somebody save me? The church tried but I don’t buy lies
hear kids cry in the middle of the night where gun fire is an every day soundbite
we turn off so we don’t hear the screams
Mother’s want peace more than they want dreams
Mother’s want food more than they want wealth
soldiers make their life a living hell
colonisation continues this year
borders pushed back in Palestine brings tears
keffiyeh’s are worn from ear to ear
symbol dilutes
pride will never disappear
kids don’t know what they wear brings fear
to those that oppose what it all really means
freedom to a people who are held captive told how to live and controlled by the pigs
right wingers everywhere pushing your ideas on me
I decide what is right and which God I believe
isn’t it enough you control my needs
making billions every day with your oil companies
economic hit men employed by the banks
designed for decline now who’s the real gang?
digging deeper in our pockets trying to get all we have never ending cycle always wanting more from our land
gang raped the Earth and left her dying when the rape kit comes there’s no denying

generations of oppressors
NO
dirty dictators
NO
cultural devastators
NO
freedom imitators
NO
greedy calculators
NO
heath perpetrators

people put up your fist for the
peace cultivators
YEAH
children educators
YEAH
people motivators
YEAH
freedom liberators
YEAH
rights activators
YEAH
unity creators
YEAH

we wont go on like this NO MORE.

(Will there be peace?)

Never be an equal playing field when you’re always changing up the rules I jump to continue.

(Will there be peace?)

Must find a way, must find a way

(Will there be peace?)

refuse to believe my brown skin is worthless caught up in a system of backwardness

(Will there be peace?)

Must find a way, must find a way

Money disappearing from my hands and I blame the man who developed this monetary plan
more that I earn, less that I make
more vexed I get when the tax man take
and I hate when companies discriminate against Mother’s trying to put peas on the plate
as if they had no purpose, their worth was worthless, corporations make me nervous
starting wars that don’t make sense so they can pocket tax dollars in the name of defense
and you can see it from the evidence when business men become presidents
like after world war two, my grandpa vaccinated cattle to prevent disease, what they told him was untrue, Mexico’s livestock was killed for America’s greed

dirty dictators
cultural devastators
freedom imitators
greedy calculators
heath perpetrators
war instigators

people put up your fist for the
