Oh, got it!

Fruit salad
Yummy, yummy, yummy
Cannot wait to get you up in my
Tummy, tummy, tummy
Druggie love me
When I'm bummy, scummy
Nah baby take a chance on me
Take a chance on me
I could give you three I assure
Open sesame, genie at the door
I know you're getting bored of those old chumps
You just stick ya nose up
That's how they know that the show's up
Striking out got no luck
No love, no love, no love no more
But you should see the dance floor baby
Give ya reason to dance for maybe
Some people like to call me crazy
Seal said we all were a little bit
So let me seal the deal
At your heart's content
And if you are content
I'll show you more content
Sorry I can't resist 
my english - is saying
That I'm not playing games
And that I'm meaning what I'm saying
What I'm saying is you're great
I hope you stay and
Chill with me

And I bet the only thing on your mind is me
Number one
And I bet the only thing on your mind is me
Number one

She has an aura like aurora borealis
In a ruby studded palace rotating upon a coralasis
Sipping out of your golden chalice
Carried away in a horse carriage
Untied from the forceful habits
Used her time - Hugo Cabret
Inspired from the fashion in Paris
First in line for the newest fabrics
Spending extra for more than average
Never mind she's gorgeous all the time
Like its automatic calm
Always never panic
Make your ticker pita patter with a pat a pita
Others strike out fucking with her
No love now
No more sounds in a old ghost town
Drowning out them old false doubts
Doubt she'll be leaving with you
She got nothing to do with a fraud ass dude
Smoking a few doobs up in her room
Watching DVDs on a PS3
Smoking G Zs out a oz
Til' we started singing ODB
Like 'hey dirty got my money'
Mondays just another day for her to make a grip of pay
She's making a way for women around the way
Perfected prototype for a protege
Nothing really left for me to say
She appeared that day with a letter on the window by the bay
To gladly say namaste
I'm not playing games
And I meaning what I'm saying
What I'm saying is your great
And in laymans I hope you're staying
(pause)
And never be complacent in this race that you're racing in
I don't know what they're thinking
But to me you're always ranking in",https://genius.com/The-outside-inn-number-one-lyrics
Ashdro,Intro,2014,"Uh, joints over vegetated
Baby are we mediated
Medicated
Joints over balcony views
, 
seashore
See it from your penthouse suite, seat indoors
Champagne bottle popping, car service she adore
Hell yeah, I be smoking while I'm stroking
No cigarillo
, 
she smoke one as she she roll one
Walk around in that ruby red gown naked
If you want to, 
all those stacks never stumble
Fly guy, kept it humble
Dig? Yeah I dug her
We sit and ponder
Break it down to a pound of sticky bubonic chronic
She twist her body like a super bionic
Moving faster than a comet
In and out her - space
Lace the cakes with hash
Release the breaks fast
J-U-L z'd off in a shuttle
Somewhere outer space
Dark everywhere
Saw a blue hemisphere
Oh dear oh my...

We be smoking on that outer planet dro
Baby you can keep one rolled
Take it to your home
Let your friends hit that dro
You can have it by the OZ
When you rolling with the Missiles
Keep it on the low key
We be smoking on that outer planet dro
Baby you can keep one rolled
Take it to your home
Let your friends hit that dro
Baby girl wanna roll two-three more

It's about that hour
We get it chiefing on the weekend
With the girl you were seeing
She ain't tryna' keep secrets
Ain't tryna' be decent
Puff pass and repeat it
Saw you blowing up her phone
She acting like she ain't see it
Checking updates on her facebook
And now look
He had his place took
Now she talking about you a sore loser
And I'm 'Michael Jordan on a scooter'
On my grind getting hang time
Off that fine pine, Sebby mang - high
I take on no hesitation
Up up and away, you can see the constellations
While I'm puffing on this indo like a whistle
Eyes so glassy they looking crystal
She give me hot brain, I let it sizzle


It ain't official til' its a Missile
Yuh!",https://genius.com/The-outside-inn-ashdro-lyrics
Follow You,,2015,"Your everything I fought for
Everything I sought
Everything I fought for
And every time was war
Therefore ill be there before
You even know
Got my guard up
So I rarely do show it
One thing I hope you're really knowing
When i'm not around i'm not running round
Trying to bust a nut
Rather get a cut of the pie
This our fucking lives:
One as a king
One as a queen
A baby with a couple siblings
A pot of gold when I gotta go
But to let you know
That I'll hold u down
I'll leave you my crown
My promise to return
For the unborn time
I know I gotta gift that some do have the difference is ....
The time and the mileage
The skill and the knowledge
The every night rhyming
Surviving on ramen
The mental blocks from writing
Going crazy some nights
I'm trying to get everything
That i left on the write
Running for my life
Not away but closer to my dreams
Try to learn how but the best times
Are ones of the moment
Live and console it
Even through the rough times
Often wounder sometimes
Where is my life really going..
Guess I gotta be the one chosen
Or choosing whichever your preference is
My lesson is that i'm running out of time
I know one day my soul will fly
But I gotta GO Johnny GO, GO
Get on your flow
Get from the floor
Floor when you back up
To the driver position and steer four wheels to the end of the mission
I got no time for an intermission cuz....

I'll follow you until my eyes turn rouge
I'll follow you until my soul runs through
I'll follow you until my eyes turn rouge
I'll follow you .... I'll follow you

Throughout your bullshit, self pity
Reason why you never fucking dealt with me
Reason why you never dealt with yourself
You're stressed over wealth a decline in health
AND I KNOW
Your ego's starting to show
I'll spot the weight of your brain
Alleviate some pain and the end of the day just sang...
R.I.P E.G.O
R.I.P yeaaah
R.I.P E.G.O
R.I.P yeaaah
That's exactly what this sound like
But never will i ever let it blow your high
Leave you stuck on the ground
Leave you nowhere to be found
If you needed help I gladly do it
If you need back up ill gladly prove it
The plan you better pursuit it
Getting lost in the movement
Stay jiggy and groovin
Choose what you be doing
Adapting like fluid
From the cup to the teapot
As the moon circles for the Kallyuug
Sipping High Tea from The Outside Inn
Crashing n dripping
While other barley living
Not gonna let you dwell in regret, this is not the end
My dear old friend to you that I send this
Your life could be so fucking tremendous
Staying ascended
Room for amendment
I recommend this
Get on your own two
And do what you gotta do
Just to get it through the avenues
Of the lows and blues
Even when it all falls down
And you feel like your about to drown
Better know i'm the one you can call on now...

I'll follow you until my eyes turn rouge
I'll follow you until my soul runs through
I'll follow you until my eyes turn rouge
I'll follow you .... I'll follow you",https://genius.com/The-outside-inn-follow-you-lyrics
HighTea. - What's Cooking,,2014,"I reminisce the times I had you
My stomachâ€™s pretty sad just eating itself
My homies tell me that itâ€™s bad for my health
I wake up every morning raiding the shelves
You know why?
Let me cleanse your spirit
You know why?
Move on forth youâ€™re near it child
You know why?
Donâ€™t tell me you canâ€™t feel it?
So thatâ€™s why itâ€™s hard to find
The tumbleweed rolls through kitchen
Saloon doors swinging
Natives singing
Ancient living
This human condition
Iâ€™m sure that it was lost before
You know why?
Fading by the minute
You know why?
Float off with the bleeding clouds
You know why?
Donâ€™t tell me you canâ€™t hear it?
So thatâ€™s why itâ€™s hard to find
Hard to find
The rest of the recipeâ€™s
In my mind
Buried in this chest of me
Heart to find
Hard to find the answers, answers
My mantra
Whatever is left of you
Together Iâ€™m next to you
Each other
Discover, discover
(x2)
To capture satisfaction
Balance is the action seek
Where you are is what you need
Told you could trust in me

Rude Boy,,2015,"Guess who back up in the motherfucking room
Iâ€™m that dude, Iâ€™m that rude
Banging chest like baboon
I assume you in tune
When your eyes popping like cartoons
But you crashing the party early, the shit gonâ€™ start soon
Iâ€™m coming and buzzing
Gunning with something
You ducking and running
I buck it and front it
You canâ€™t function to push my buttons
You suckers weak off my consumption
Fast AK flow but I ainâ€™t Russian
Wear my heart on my sleeve like a set of cufflinks
Why you step through the spot so pretentious?
I ainâ€™t on the guestlist and I wonâ€™t see to the exit
Snatching up your girl because you seem so protective
And take her to the back where the smoke so offensive
You toilet rappers are giving me a pot to piss in
Iâ€™m toe tagging you all, facebook check in the mortician
They say donâ€™t rap over dubstep cause that shit sound turd
Got my balls banging on your eardrums like fuck what ya heard
Wake up in the morning to oats and chai vanilla lattes
Kermit rolled up in a paper, no tobacco in my ashtray
My eyes donâ€™t go red when I smoke my leaf
Call me an environmentalist cause I love my tree
Oh fuck it
We getting real ruckus
We came to bust it
You canâ€™t adjust it
Do it cause I love it

RUDE BOY",https://genius.com/The-outside-inn-rude-boy-lyrics
Honest,Lost Sessions,2014,"Smoking volcanoâ€™s in my own living room
Dark lights loom
Welcome to the vapor lounge
My mind's running wild
I donâ€™t wanna sit and wait around
The days may come to an end
I may never see the sun again
I may lose my closest friends
And if it all goes down
Whom am I to call now
When I'm falling now
Hence why I'm doing this for the ones that mean the most
I mean the ones I call my fam
I mean the ones I call my friends
I mean the ones that will ride it out until the very end
I know they trying to do the same
Working 9 to 5
Getting fed up with chasing the cheddar
But keep your head up
Support your son and daughter
They ain't getting no younger
Yet we keep on growing older
Getting bolder
Seeing the past decisions flower to the futures fruition
I feel as were all on the same mission with a different vision
Let that not be the cause of a permanent incision
Leaving us in a division
I know we can sum it up
Minus the minor commissions
The minor commissions
(pause)
So let's roll up a white a paper, pass it your neighbor
Pour up a cold glass for the ones that passed in the past
We cry about it then yet now we laugh
I remember - in December
We used to kick it
Talk about the immanent vision
Discuss what local house party we would be hitting
Smoke a little something something
Now thereâ€™s more then liquor flowing
Energies imploding
The skies our road and
No condolence
For the unfocused
Unaware dreams of lyrical masterpiece
Sought out to be
A kindred art to me
Itâ€™s a part of me
Mastery set to an artist keys
I feel this came out of me
Throughout my verbal alchemy
I know I want the best from me
I know you want the best from you
I know we push each other for a better point of view
I know I want the best for me
I know you want the best from you
I know we push each other for a better point of view",https://genius.com/The-outside-inn-honest-lyrics
HighTea. - Midnight Locomotive,,2014,"Are you there? Iâ€™m home
Tell me how to say in other words
Iâ€™m heading on down my own road lately
Everything moves at hyper speed
Magnetically this shuttleâ€™s hasty
Zooming - in and out of focus
In my mind are locusts
Chasing me attacking
I think I can I know I can outrun them man I have to
Even though theyâ€™re swarming me ability is action
Itâ€™s not the destination
Itâ€™s about the journey
Hope youâ€™re all observing
Make yourself at home right here while window seated
Midnight impeding scenery seeing
My reflection is in clear view
Landscape translucent
Pardon me canâ€™t hear you
Iâ€™m busy drawing up solutions
I think I left behind my sorrows
Try not to think about tomorrow
I'm only living for the moment
So what you waiting for you own it
Condone it
Control it
Itâ€™s knowing
Opponents
Itâ€™s you just you
Not me or whoever whether
You think that or not
Youâ€™ve got more than enough
Youâ€™ve got all that you want and still it's
Never too much
Ooo

Are you there? Iâ€™m home, Yep
Are you there? Iâ€™m home, Yep
Are you there? Iâ€™m home, Yep
Are you there? Iâ€™m home, Yep

I think I can I know I can I think I can I know I
I think I can I know I can Iâ€™m on my way
I think I can
I know I
I know I
I know I

The Cheel,,2014,"Itâ€™s that old soul in a new body
Canâ€™t top me feeling godly
Once I get it going properly
Iâ€™m probably
A nuisance to society
Hallucinogen to the music
Puppet of Illuminati
Or putrid to the cool kids
Give a damn who you is
Or what he spit
Or what she did
Or what they give
They is something I am not
I surrender to hip hop
Canâ€™t stop it, wonâ€™t drop it
They in a box I wonâ€™t hop in
Itâ€™s gotten rotten
With these false lens
Pretend friends
The plot ends at the bottom
Got new eyes for these problems
Now Iâ€™m rising to the top
And man I already forgot them
Dreams in my hands, they canâ€™t spot it
The ones that claim it normally ainâ€™t got it
Even when they do, they too far behind me
Taking shots at my hiney
Look back and they so tiny
Try and find me

Now donâ€™t this shit make a ninja wanna
Now donâ€™t this shit make a ninja wanna
Now donâ€™t this shit make a ninja wanna
Make a ninja wanna
Make a ninja wanna wanna

Iâ€™m coming off a couple yearsâ€™ experience
A few months delirious
Some weeks too serious
But only a day for you to be hearing this
On the road to success having trouble steering this
Cliffs that I nearly miss
My destination is a fearful wish
Til I reach a tearful bliss
My gift be an earful of spit
It may sound disgusting
But with entrusting what is happening
Laws of attraction brought me back to rap again
Now Iâ€™m packing in, you just panicking
Walking on the sky, first name Anakin
Damaging, cancelling, anything you managing
These jedi mind tricks ainâ€™t nothing to be tampered with
And I get it done, I do it while Iâ€™m having fun
I pack a punch for the rest of them
Star reaching to see what I become
A million ways to be fly man so all you gotta do is choose one

Why they gotta
Mess with my mantra
Did it proper
Kicks it like soccer
Smooth like Wonka
Feel it in my chakra",https://genius.com/The-outside-inn-the-cheel-lyrics
A LOT CAN CHANGE,,," 
brace yourself for impact waiting
i’m just saying
sometimes it’s hard to overcome these systems of control
i do my best to hold and holdin on
i try console myself
words from someone else unfold i
cross my tongue whats done is done
the future’s coming for you don’t run
gotta take it head on
take the bull by the h-rn when the morning comes
well
you can lead a horse to water
but you can’t make it drink
but you can make it think
so i think positivity’s the key at least for me
i see my dreams are dreaming of me to
skies above are fading blue
people round me loving what i’m doing
surround yourself with true friends
energy’s the new sense
get rid of f-cking nuisances says me
you will never be free
if you dont know the world outside
you’ll never be all you can be
if you don’t look within and find
a lot can change x4

yeah
if a lot change
change can happen a lot
can’t start from the bottom

if you were always on the top

life is more parallel depending on your clientele
either way i excel never dwell till my farewell
you loving the view from inside
fillin your heart with the? i’m taking my time
i’m cutting the screws to your pride
all feelings collide all feelings aside
i’m feeling? i’m filling your soul
i’m feeling the glow i’m feeling the flow
i’m filling the hole i’m fillin that hole

home is where the heart is
yes it’s true
but the heart can fill with darkness
from me to you
you can change your view in whatever you pursue
even if the day is through there will always be a new
you will never be free
if you dont know the world outside
you’ll never be all you can be
if you don’t look within and find
a lot can change x8",https://azlyrics.biz/t/the-outside-inn-lyrics/the-outside-inn-a-lot-can-change-lyrics/
