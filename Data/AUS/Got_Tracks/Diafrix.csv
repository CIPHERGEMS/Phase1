I'm A Dreamer,Pocket Full of Dreams,2012,"Oh, I'm up before the birds
Groundhog Day, let my dreams replay
Good morning, am I really awake
Or am I lost in the moment in a dreamy state?
Thinking back to the days when it was all simple
Sandpit politics, no big issue
Win some, lose some, grow and brush it off, man
But nowadays everybody's got it twisted
No time to love, but plenty of time to diss you
While they diss you I see the way, yeah, I
Yeah, I'm a dreamer, a true believer
Pray for better days, hoping things will change
So I let the sun shine, wash away the pain
(Yeah) Live to see the day where my kids can say
(Uh) ""It's been a long time coming
For the change in the air and it all feels good, we made it""

I'm daydreaming every day
My head's so far away
Excuse me when I say
I'm a dreamer, yes, I'm a dreamer
I'm daydreaming every day
My head's so far away
Excuse me when I say
I'm a dreamer, yes, I'm a dreamer

And I'm a dream, I'm a dream, I'm a dreamer
You say it's not possible, I don't believe ya
I live my life, live my life to the fullest
I walk around all peaceful like a Buddhist
So check me out if your mind is a mess now
You're always trying to hide that you're stressed out
Man, you need to chill out
Take a deep breath, think what it's really 'bout
Uh, remember when I was a child
I was so wild, couldn't keep me in the house
I'd be out all day, playing in the park
My mom call my name every time it gets dark
'Cause I come from a place where you only get nightmares
People shout it down so you never put it out there
Keep it to yourself and that's where it's best kept
And this is the recipe behind my success, so

I'm daydreaming every day
My head's so far away
Excuse me when I say
I'm a dreamer, yes, I'm a dreamer
I'm daydreaming every day
My head's so far away
Excuse me when I say
I'm a dreamer, yes, I'm a dreamer

I'm a dream, I'm a dreamer
I'm a dream, I'm a dreamer
I'm a dreamer, yes, I'm a dreamer

I'm sitting in a room and I'm daydreaming
How all this success is a strange feeling
And will it all last, or will it all pass?
And all this random shit that my brain deals with
Yeah, I got my head in the clouds
Random raps, got the phone out to get it all down
Thinkin' 'bout the next show and expecting a crowd
Too excited, got a Valium to settle me down
Spent years home at mom and dad's messing around
But now my favourite part of it is my parents are proud
Never listen to the hater if he getting me down
And no words are ever stopping me progressing my sound, no
Stay positive, I do prefer this
Looking forward to the things that I can do with my kids
And I'm thinking 'bout flying to the moon to work this
'Cause the sky ain't the limit, yo, the universe is, and

I'm daydreaming every day
My head's so far away
Excuse me when I say
I'm a dreamer, yes, I'm a dreamer
I'm daydreaming every day
My head's so far away
Excuse me when I say
I'm a dreamer, yes, I'm a dreamer

I'm a dreamer, yes, I'm a dreamer
I'm a dreamer, yes, I'm a dreamer
I'm a dreamer, yes, I'm a dreamer
I'm a dreamer, yes, I'm a dreamer",https://genius.com/Diafrix-im-a-dreamer-lyrics
"Easy Come, Easy Go",Pocket Full of Dreams,2012,"(Damn)
Lost my job today, my boss told me to take a holiday
A one-way trip, no return
Still got bills to pay, but oh well
Dang, it happened again
My girl keeps saying ""Can't happen again!""
It's the third time now and I'm shit outta luck
Gotta turn it around cause I can't give it up now
Now, I got robbed today
They took everything, took my sashery
But I don't stop, I'm going to get it back
I never worry cause I'm not about that
And sometimes I don't want to hear 'em
When they're saying shit happen for a reason
But I gotta make tea, life is a game that I gotta keep playing

No time to worry cause your world will turn, baby
I seen it all and I became undone, darling
No need to worry 'bout the things we got
Cause you feel it when it's gone
I guess it's easy come and easy go
Easy come and easy go
Guess it's easy come and easy go
Easy come and easy go
Yeah, I'm in the top place and it feels so good I'm running the race
New deal, gonna double the fame
But I won't be shit without none of the pain
It's a long way from the Footscray flats
Where you're safe and asleep with your baseball bat
Not many can escape the track
But I stayed on track and I changed on that, yeah
Misery was kin to me, now I travel overseas making history
Yeah, it was never easy
They label me a knockoff? cause my hair was frizzy
First style that a lot of y'all stepped on
Cookin' up big things, get my chef on
And the love from my fans got my head strong
So I gotta give it back, gon' tell 'em all


Yeah, mama said there'd be days like these
Where the world wouldn't spin around
Don't let the past never hold you back
Cause it's easy as it comes and goes

No time to worry
Yeah",https://genius.com/Diafrix-easy-come-easy-go-lyrics
Simple Man,Pocket Full of Dreams,2011,"I guess I'm a simple man
I got no money, no dental plan, baby
And I don't even care
I got my weed and I got my lady

Yo, I'm a simple man with simple ways
I'm short on change, but my girl don't care
I don't ever fuss, I'm happy to catch the bus
And if the dollars ain't enough I'ma roll on my push-bike
A simple life, no bling, no thick bits
No wannabe producer all up in my video clips
A good life, yeah I'm happy with my cooler bar
Fourteen bucks, I'm as high as you are
Fly as you are, drinking at the same bar
Use your credit card 'cause mine's a debit card
No need to act hard or tango with a facade
I'm like a little kid having a ball in the school yard, yeah
Uh, huh, you can call me Mr Simple man
Bullshit aside, take it easy no drama man
I got my weed I got my lady so I'm living
No need to stress 'cause I'm reclined and chillin'

I guess I'm a simple man
I got no money, no dental plan, baby
And I don't even care
I got my weed and I got my lady
So don't treat me like that ('Cause I'm a simple man)
Don't treat me like that (No money, no dental plan)
Don't treat me like that (I don't rock no special brand)
Don't treat me like that (Un-un-understand)
So why you treat me like that ('Cause I'm a simple man)
Don't treat me like that (No money, no dental plan)
Don't treat me like that (I don't rock no special brand)
Un-un-understand

Uh, right there on the one and twos
Simple man life, let me tell you how I do
All I care about, my shirt matching my shoes
Call up work and tell 'em I got the flu
'Cause today I can't be bothered
Always in a good mood, never find me stubborn
Rock up in the city with $4.50
By the end of night there's always a girl that wanna kiss me
Smoke weed with me, chill with me
On the stairs right now, we both tipsy
So, come on rock steady with me
Like a gypsy I move from city to city
With my backpack on, sleeping on your couch
Like there's nothing wrong 'cause I truly don't care
Every time you see me there's smoke in the air
Azmarino live that good life right there

I guess I'm a simple man
I got no money, no dental plan, baby
And I don't even care
I got my weed and I got my lady

""I'm a simple man""
""No need to stress""
""Always in a good mood""
""Simple man life, let me tell you how I do""

'Cause I don't need no telephone line
'Cause the credit on my phone's pre-paid
When you know that your money might go
But your woman and your weed gon' stay

I guess I'm a simple man
I got no money, no dental plan, baby
And I don't even care
I got my weed and I got my lady
I guess I'm a simple man",https://genius.com/Diafrix-simple-man-lyrics
Running It,Pocket Full of Dreams,2011,"You're never on time unless you slow it down
Never find out unless you go down
Get up again, you're running it
Get up again, oh
Another long weekend approaching and I wanna let my hair down
They say the best things in life are free, and right now I have to agree
I'm feeling super like Superman, so pass my the kryptonite
If it puts me on my ass I ain't going out without a fight
Life is tasting good, so I'm reaching for the highest heights
Get me through the storm, blue skies, I'mma fly my kite
All I need is fam, 'cause they're the first to understand
They're the first to lend a hand, no, they never doubt me, man
Even when I'm hustlin', bustlin', tusslin'
Slowly counting my chips and profiting margin
And they're always around to slow it down

I'm still in my bed
I wonder if I should go out and surrender instead
I got some ? stuck to my head
And it's really fucking boring, need to call up a friend
L-L-L-Look here, I'm running the better budget
Last weekend was a big week and now I'm left with empty buckets and
Eyy, I wanna do it all again
Get ? in my head and have a good time with my friends and
Eyy, what possibly could stop me?
They say the best things come for free, let me see where this will take me
Go play, with the dinosaurs and monsters
Mingle with the devil 'cause I'm looking for a sponsor

I'm running it
I hold it down
It's gotta be now or never
You're running it
You slow it down
It's gotta be now or never",https://genius.com/Diafrix-running-it-lyrics
Concrete Jungle,"Illusive & Friends, Vol. 1 (Best of 2009)",2009,"Ye, this song goes out to all the displaced refugees
All of the displaced lovers
All of the displaced families, this one goes out to all ya
Every single one an all of yours if ya listening
This one goes out to you man
Especially if ya ain’t got no visa
We’re all survivors in this concrete jungle
Some play hard, some play it humble
Either way we all wish our own hustle, because everybody’s got to eat
Up north, down south
You can hear it in the east
All the way to the west
Back home, I use to jump on top of my roof and stair
At the stars for so long
Think why everyday I do wrong
Try to find an inner place where I belong
Cause it’s not dat my eyes can no longer see people miss treated
Even though my life I feel defeated
So I travel seas to be it
Grown ass man providing food to eat
My family are thankful
Even though my mum on the phone saying missing you is painful
Reminisce and make a laugh about the days when I was a hand full
But that’s cool cause we’re all
We’re all survivors in this concrete jungle
Some play hard some play it humble
Either way we all wish our own hustle because everybody’s got to eat (cos everybody gotta)
Up north (put food on the table) down south (and wear shoes on their feet)
You can hear it in the east (sleep safe tonight)
All the way to the west (all the way all the way)
Am I alone in the clouded space
How did this song wind up at ur place
Can this reach far enough to embrace
Penetrate your mind, can you empathise the case of a hard working u and I
I'm talking modern day poets dabbling in ink notating life with rhymes
Cos life’s bigger then size bigger then the, lies they speak see
Some can’t eat so they eye a sheek
Some get it all from the lies the speak
Some get by, praise god for the feast
You got to have faith when your living in the belly of the beast
And yeah sometimes it feels hard watching your parents working two jobs
While the bills keep piling up and your trying to finish school but the stress got u acting up
But we all
We’re all survivors in this concrete jungle
Some play hard some play it humble
Either way we all wish our own hustle because everybody’s got to eat (cos everybody gotta)
Up north (put food on the table) down south (and wear shoes on their feet)
You can hear it in the east (sleep safe tonight)
All the way to the west (all the way all the way)
Thanks for my rhyme for keeping me neutral
Still on the hustle but type humble
Organic like vegie drink mineral
Squeeze my fist tight when it’s time to be physical
In the lion jungle so to many funeral
Keep my head low try not to be judgmental
Climbed many trees only purpose survival
But that’s the way it goes in the concrete jungle
Many wana, see peace in the Middle East
Many wana, stop 3rd world poverty
Many wana, make this world free disease
But what it is, is
We’re all survivors in this concrete jungle
Some play hard some play it humble
Either way we all wish our own hustle because everybody’s got to eat (cos everybody gotta)
Up north (put food on the table) down south (and wear shoes on their feet)
You can hear it in the east (sleep safe tonight)
All the way to the west (all the way all the way)
Displaced misplaced refugees everywhere man
We’re gonna hussle man

Better With You,Pocket Full of Dreams,2012,"]
Hey'o, it feels like yesterday
You and me hanging out smoking purple haze
Getting blazed on the rooftop and drinking case
Broke as now but we always had good taste
Always in shit cause we never had shit
We tried to hustle but we made a little bit
And our folks split us up when you had to go travel on your own
Now I'm here reminiscing this, cause I thought life was a game
Till I got that phone call and my life changed
She was like, yo this shit is messed up
Your cousins been shot, I can't take the pain
And I'm never gonna be the same again, hey
Cause I lost my homie and my best friend
And it cuts so deep every time I reminisce
My hand on my chest, you'll always be better with you

I'll be better with you
Feels like one of those days
Where I can't (I can't,) be strong
Just tell me what to do
I'll be better with you
Feels like one of those days
Where I can't be strong
But your love will get me through


First class flights on the daily
Rocking mics round the world, yeah they name me
Star, guess what I'm saying mainly
I wish I'd spent more time with my baby
We were always apart
Video calls only took us so far
Always let them know
How much you love them before they get cold
Ooooo-ooooooh
I need you baby
But you're flying now
Flying now
 but I'd be better with you
]
My chest kinda heavy
So many words I wanna say to you lately
Been ten years since I haven't seen my family
My God, my sister don't recognise me when she see me
I live back home since she got a better place
It feels like I'm stuck running in the rat race
Don't know what to do cause I'm losing the plot
And sometimes I wonder if its worth it or not
I 'member when mum used to say
""Whatever happens it happens anyway
Just accept it and keep going with ya day""
Fair play, she raised true soldiers
So she know that I'ma be okay
Survival of the fittest
Never be defeated 'cause they told me I'm the illest
Yeah, I killed it
But I still wish you were here so you could see it

I'll be better with you
Feels like one of those days
Where I can't (I can't,) be strong (be strong)
Just tell me what to do
I'll be better with you
Feels like one of those days
Where I can't be strong
But your love will get me through",https://genius.com/Diafrix-better-with-you-lyrics
