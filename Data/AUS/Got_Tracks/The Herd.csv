77%,An Elefant Never Forgets,2003,"""77% of Australians, um, agree with John Howard's actions on the Tampa""
""What happened to the others?""
""The thing is to use military force, er, against, er, refugees, isn't that, er, a little overkill?""
""A spokesman for the line that owns the ship says Australian SAS troops are in danger of breaking the laws of piracy""
""Undoubtedly this is the most popular decision, as far as the Australian public are concerned, the government's made during its reign""
""The captain's been pulling our strings in Australian waters, he had sent out a distress signal""
""Clearly, our solution was, um, well, it wasn't only farcical, it was, um, it was immoral""
""I wish that this problem were not ours""

Well, I'm left sitting here staring into a beer
Shaking my head at the same old loathing and fear
Stranger in my own land, can't understand
How the very word 'Australian' has just been damned
I fuckin' hate myself, take 'Ozi' from my name
Erase this endless shame, forever casting blame
If you don't act the same, will I destroy you?
Everyone looks the same beaten black and blue
So I've had enough of these redneck pricks
When fact is the only real shit that sticks
Watch as I tear the very skin from my face
So none'll see my race, my deep disgrace
You're not even from here in the first place
And those that are, you wanna further debase?
Nup, no more, never again whether by fist or pen
I will defend, 'cause I'm at a loose end
The shattered remnants of Aussie dignity
I'm a skip, whitey, round-eye, surprise me
Use your shrivelled brain to please explain
How the clever country just went down the drain
We rode the sheep's back, now the sheep ride you
If this is how it's gonna be, don't call me ""true blue""
I denounce my ancestors, wounds still fester
If you say it ain't so, I suggest ya wake up

Wake up, this country needs a fuckin' shake-up
Wake up, these cunts need a shake-up
Wake up, this country needs a fuckin' shake-up
Wake up, these cunts need a shake-up
Wake up, this country needs a fuckin' shake-up
Wake up, these cunts need a shake-up
Wake up, this country needs a fuckin' shake-up
Wake up, these cunts need a shake-up

Talkback squawking hacks won't relax
Until Jonesy, Zemanek and Laws are all axed
77% of Aussies are racist
If you're here, I'll say it to your faces
Rich redneck pricks still hold all the aces
I'll buy you a beer with an arsenic chaser
""Better off dead?"" Is that what I've said?
Tempting to take for all the blood you've shed
No doubt you're as bad as your dads and your mums
Mainstream media making me so fuckin' glum
Just Anglo reality, intellectual cavities
Channel 9 fostering prejudiced mentalities
I won't be a casualty, just mention casually
I can't stand for you shit-eating bullies
Preying on peeps without a mainstream voice
Most of you stay silent, but I've got no choice

Wake up, this country needs a fuckin' shake-up
Wake up, these cunts need a shake-up
Wake up, this country needs a fuckin' shake-up
Wake up, these cunts need a shake-up
Wake up, this country needs a fuckin' shake-up
Wake up, these cunts need a shake-up
Wake up, this country needs a fuckin' shake-up
Wake up

Well, I've yelled my lungs out but to no avail
Well, I've yelled my lungs out but to no avail
Well, I've yelled my lungs out but to no fuckin' avail
That you're a stranger yourself, now that's the sting in the tail

Captain Cook was the very first queue-jumper
It was immigrant labour that made Australia plumper
Enough is enough, whiteys, go pack your stuff
Don't wanna live in England? That's fuckin' tough
I'm sick and tired of this redneck wonderland
Most of you stay silent and I can't understand
I just can't understand (Understand)

It's time for you to wake up, this country needs a fuckin' shake-up
Wake up, these cunts need a shake-up
Fuckin' wake up, this country needs a fuckin' shake-up
Wake up, these cunts need a shake-up
Wake up, this country needs a fuckin' shake-up
Wake up, these cunts need a shake-up
Wake up, this country needs a fuckin' shake-up
Wake up",https://genius.com/The-herd-77-lyrics
Burn Down the Parliament,An Elefant Never Forgets,2003,"Burn down a pub, we heat up a club
Get a punter feeling hot like they use dencorub
When we do what we love
Smell the smoke above
With a hot-headed approach
Turning push to shove
Like a bushfire in scrub
We ambush the dub
Set alight our rap books like a pencil stub
It's essential cuz, feel it heat ya blood
We be blazing on the mic like Nimbin blazes bud

Singe the ears keep it lit like gear
With no laws to fear, let it burn in here
Flush you out like a sniffer dog prowling near
Cos it's arson dear, get the crowd to cheer
The beats got an edge like dropping off cliffs
It's a major risk, just like nature is
Leave us with no choice when you make it fizz
Throwing fire on your lukewarm liquid disc

Let these words incite, like molotovs in flight
And set a panic in the public like a meteorite strike
Have you got a light? I've got a bomb tonight
And I will set it off when I feel the mood is right
Firebugs delight, as the fuel ignites
And turn a civilised affair into construction site
When our raps are tight fire burning bright
We make the others look about as hot as Michael Stipe
 {x2}
Burn down a parliament, we burn down a flag
Burn down a liar like we burn ounce bag
And the dutch oven cooks with the smoke that was grabbed
So the fire flew fast and the flame licked the red rag

It's the place to be like South Park hell
Call your agency, better tell Ma Bell
But there's no place to sell and no vacancies
As the furnace starts to melt I smell baked MCs
But it's pay per view so just close your eyes
While the conflagration spraypaints the sky
It's not humid, so why do these fellas need fluids
Man pass the joint, we're near boiling point

Was a quiet show, now an inferno
Fire start to make you disappear like 
Sheryl Kernot
In a riot below, watch the fire grow
Outta control like a pushy when the tire blows
Let the word be known let a flag be flown
We take the mic in heavy fire and make the stage our own
Til the fakes go home, place is set to blow
Cos this rhythms dynamite and the spark is the poem

You don't need no torch with the background scorched
Cos the char will report, this is not just sport
Sport could never be bought in this circumstance
Unlike ghetto street clothes or urban dance
Turn up your clock radios to nightmare awakening
Crank the beat, enhance the de-stabling
The Herd confuse the labeling
Just here to make you think, we're near ya
We're here to take it in

LG,An Elefant Never Forgets,2003,"A moment passes as life flows through glasses
And I hear laughter from the long grasses
Babes in baskets and drinking from casks
Now cigarette throats crackle and rasp
Asking questions about my family and folken
A real conversation with no jingles or tokens
The circle is broken it's split wide open
Now a spliff is lit and the perimeter is floating
Lips that are split become angry and spit
Yo backflipping pollies create a shit pit
Now swags dragged away forms filled in with ink
With bolt cutters drawn they're snapping the link
The most social of cultures judged anti-social
For living with families out in the open
Whereas we live in boxes preoccupied foxes
Yet nobody stops when an old lady crosses
Hey
The game's begun
The dice rolled
Now move along
I said hey
The game's begun
The dice is rolled
Now who has won
As i look into the eyes of these old fellas
As they look up into mine these storytellers
For the richness of culture I get jealous
As we hold up the cup and we drink from the chalice
Legs spread cross-legged again in the park
Hard fed stories inspirational spark
Dragonflies (??) signaling dark
Over my shoulder yes a night patrol car
Mob's moving song's soothing path choosing
Perimeter perusing has become a way of prooving
Displacement adjacent to the concrete jungle
But once whispered currawong to warraguls
I can't help but be a little bit ropeable
Hey
The game's begun
The dice rolled
Now move along
I said hey
The game's begun
The dice is rolled
Now who has won
I take flight with my bike and go cruise through the night
When confronted by shadows in an absence of light
My palms are getting sweaty I'm already forgetting
The netting of the bedding when the sun before setting
The shadows unravel telling stories of travel
And long (joyless?) walks across car-parks of gravel
Oval smiles pasted dials worthwhile tales for conversational styles
While all the while our canines hear/hit fences
An imaginary defense against walking a while
I dabble then I dibble when I'm stuck in the middle
Could you buy a vowel to help me solve this riddle
Piddles and skiddles and size mc jiggles (???)
Selectively alert now plays the fiddle
Hey
The game's begun
The dice rolled
Now move along
I said hey
The game's begun
The dice is rolled
Now who has won x 2",https://genius.com/The-herd-lg-lyrics
Ray Of Sun,An Elefant Never Forgets,2003,"31 in the shade and I can't understand
How i feel like the only man left in Iceland
It's rainy and cold and everyone looks glum
But I feel like I'm standing in a ray of sun
Motorbike on a kickstand, waiting for Zen maintenance
Broke down on the highway and stationary ever since
It all seems futile, count the hours till sleep
With every breath a little closer to death I creep
Man, don't sink too deep, don't be so f**king heavy man
Just keep on writing raps with a steady hand
Because that's all that matters, infact, it's all there is
I got spite and envy mixed up for married life with kids
I fear the path of least resistance, so, time for a rain dance
To make sure I don't dry up, like, never took a chance
But I' wouldn't rap on a Polka, so who 'm I talking to?
Maybe like the Buddhist's say, life's like a GroundHog day
We're all stuck in our cycles, forever and eternal
Perfecting our lines, and making notes in our journal
If there's one kernal of truth in everything I've known
It's at the end of it all we're really all alone
If you stress out and try to answer all the questions
Life will be like a spacebar, a series of depressions
All I know is I'm as insignificant as a flee
But yet the most important thing that's ever happened to me
And that will set you free, even if shit looks bleak
And you can change your way any day of the week
But who am I to speak for any but myself
'cause I can only see the cards that I've been dealt
Now you can diss the dealer, 'cause the dealers corrupt
Or you can do like Krakatoa and just go errupt
If you've had enough, don't call the dealer's bluff
Just walk away from the table, like you don't give a stuff
It's like Metallica say, nothing else matters
The game is full of checia cats and mad hatters
It's 31 in the shade and I can't understand
How i feel like the only man left in Iceland
Rainy and cold and everyone looks glum
But I feel like I'm standing in a ray of sun
I can't see my way -
It's like a wall, you see, you can't really see over it from that side
You can't see the other side, but you still know it's there
What's there? -
Man, everything's f**ked up, I can't find my way
But you were still alive at the break of day
Oh that's just like you, eternal optimist
But you get so negative when you get so pissed
I'm only drinking 'cause I'm sober and not going places
Yeah, but then you diss everything on the value of faces
But if you dig deeper things will seem even worse
Man, life is more like a bicycle than a herse
Don't you ever feel like an old lady with an empty purse?
If that's your attitude maybe you should get a wet nurse
Oh so I'm immature 'cause I see how it is
Yeah but just having a whinge is acting just like a kid
You can't take every twist and turn without skids
But you can stick to the road if you don't blow your lid
Man, I don't really see the point to all your advice
Yeah but one day you'll look back and you'll see that I'm right
It's 31 in the shade and I can't understand
How i feel like the only man left in Iceland
It's rainy and cold and everyone looks glum
But I feel like I'm standing in a ray of sun
It's 31 in the shade, I can't understand
How i feel like the only man left in Iceland
Rainy and cold and everyone looks glum

States of Transit,An Elefant Never Forgets,2003,"...East Hills line
First stop Green Square, Mascot, Domestic Terminal, International Airport
...Sydenham, Marickville, Hurlstone Park, Canterbury, Campsie
And then all stations to Bankstown
Then Yagoona, Birrong, then all stations to Lidcombe

You smile to yourself as you ride past the panel beaters
New pieces last night, early morning on the bike
Eight hours in the shop most days of the week
Maintaining food on your plate and your place in the street
Keep one eye on the clock and so you're ready to bail
Learnt long ago never to rely on CityRail
When you ride the Sydney system, you're up there with the best
They're all laughing out loud at that ridiculous nest
Past the park with the Tai Chi stretch and Yoga heads
And the people with the bottles and the benches for beds
Hell for leather down Crown, hold your breath at the lights
Keep monoxide from your lungs and keep it fresh for the mic
Band practice tonight to try and keep the set tight
But before then, spend time with the love of your life
Got priorities right, maintaining love with respect
There's a thousand roads to travel but you know your direction

Same line, same day, all on the same track
We cross paths but barely interact
You got no time to chit chat, you've got a schedule to keep
Shooting straight across the city and you're dodging the sheep
It's the same line, same day, all on the same track
We cross paths but barely interact
One more 24 hour stretch from daylight to dusk and dusk down to desk

Waiting for the 4:28
Ragged old suit briefcase looks much older than his age
Like to catch the bus home
Not concerned by the traffic and the lights and the ticket price hikes
Kinda like the bus, no one talks that much
Keep the conversation hush, the city's pretty at dusk
And most places are expressionless, pressing the bell
While peak hour reeks perfume that you just can't sell
From Central up to King Street, window washers hussle all the cars
The bus driver just looks and laughs
I pass fools in parks and pass people by
He's content, never meeting with no reason why
You have a cold yet? Comfortable, welcome at home
A little bachelor pad, a gold fish and a phone
Where he'll go back to sleep dream and wake up at eight
Get prepared, catch the bus back to work again... it's like

Same line, same day, all on the same track
We cross paths but barely interact
One more 24 hour stretch from daylight to dusk and dusk down to desk
Same line, same day, all on the same track
We cross paths but barely interact
(It's all I ask of this complex town
Share a tale or two and watch the sun go down)

The sun set so fast I didn't see it happen
Like I look back on days just to see the patterns
See the way the last rays of the day are scattered
In such a different way to when I first sat here
(Another beer?) You know the more some things change
The more some things are bound to stay the same
It's a shame about those units across the street though
We used to get that much more light in the arvo
Still it's a good place to sit for a while
Even if these days I don't quite fit the style
It's the people I come here for though, not the decor
And they don't seem to think of me as too much of an old bore
I used to live just round the corner
But then the rent got too dear so I moved from here
Still it's not so far, and just to come for a beer
I'm not a local but I'm still a local here

Same line, same day, all on the same track
We cross paths but barely interact
You got no time to chit chat, you've got a schedule to keep
Shooting straight across the city and your're dodging the sheep
Same line, same day, all on the same track
We cross paths but barely interact
(It's all I ask of this complex town
Share a tale or two and watch the sun go down)

I try to think global
Remain hopeful
Act local
Necessarly vocal
And so social
I ate now I'm so full
And bloated to excess
On the plate there's nothing left
Gotta take it to the chest
Complete it like a test
Or maybe not
Should I not be saying yes?
Knowing when to stop
Looking for the best place for a great feast
In the U.S., half the population is obese
Meat follows soup
Move your feet if you can see 'em
Seems we're all consumers
But rarely human beings
The soup's got controls
Caviar and gold plates
Environment raise down more ways (?)
We grew food
Genetically engineered more food
More processed food
These factories to force you to get in touch with your chemical side
Your pesticide
This whole enterprise makes me question why
We've got it so wrong
One too many swan songs (?)
Is sustainability long gone or what?
Am I right to call out these criticisms?
A full bellied outspoken straight contradiction
I look into the face of those who are starving
Asking myself am I just making noise
With half the planet poised, waiting for an answer
I hold my place in the protest with an anchor

Annd so social
I'm noble as the next man
And that's generally poor
We're self absorbed and hard to deplore
And in order to afford it
Wack it on the plastic
Snap it like a brittle wooden match stick
Come with me
To gluttony
Accumulate and destroy
Repudiate and employ
Rejuvinate and enjoy
Hormone injected burgers
Make them little cattle bones grow quicker
The skin sits but quivers (?)
These God damn fast food chains
Food looks strange
Let alone like anything the ads claim
Marketed to families
Get 'em young
Do the sums
Sell it by the tonne
Where to run?
One ad campaign across the whole planet
So we can sing the same jingle they branded
This is my candle-lit vigil
I'm standing fearful
We got pulled in by a lame ritual
I'm not a rock
I think despite what I'm not I'd sink
It's over when we blink in unison on the brink
Well I pump myself up with more pharmaceuticals
Add more life to my expectancy
It may affect your pregnancy
But it might be profitable
Jump blindly into whatever's possible

It's ages since you graced my pages
But this shit goes in stages
How the machine rages
I've got a spanner for your works
Whole patches of industry
I've got no manners for you jerks
You wouldn't listen to me
An Eco friendly emblem on a petrol station
Like a fucking referendum for a queen without a nation
Lies about land rights
Build uranium mines, avoiding millions in tax
You've never paid a fine
When, in the ear of our leaders, to start a war like that
If we don't know who were fighting, well then we won't fight back
So I'm calling you out
To let you know we know
Your branding shines like gold
And hides the shit below
Ever thought that's why Jordan is no politics major
Because he can't stand the thought of his slaves in asia
Who puts a B-boy and a surfer in the same ad break?
I beat the real thing, because it's so fucking fake
He tells a pack of lies and then tries to murder the truth
He's just the same two guys, who tell you all the news
And who's that chimpanzee, straight out a western movie
And here come little Johnny wanna be his deputy
The world is cleft you see
Made to fight one another
Economic big brother operating deep cover
So Im calling you out
To let you know we know
Your branding shines like gold
And hides the shit below
Because everything is really not okay
Despite the forecast of another beautiful grey
I mean a beautiful day
Blessed with optimism
A few more companies are killing off their competition
Even blackouts couldn't make these devils sto-op and listen
A rat race, that's disgraced and should not be forgiven
It's not your pipe to piss in
So there's a price to pay
Whilst burning you'll be thinking about it everyday
The gap gets greater
And so I'd watch your step
Once slip and there goes your neck
Sleep with a sweat
There's too many now looking for your downfall
In the eighties all they thought about was how tall
Could a corp climb higher than a star sign
Make money marry money
And make more money
Mankind suckered out like a bloodthirsty vampire
They call you citizens upstanding
But we call you damn liars
Image built brand empires all targets
We'll ""boycott attack"" and defame just for starters
Press charges? And bring your lawyers to the table?
But the tables are turning so get out while your able
SAMPLE
""I love convenience, I love corporations because they give me convenience
I I i-saw on the news that there's all these people trying to stop these corporations spread the convenience
And that's err.. that's why we've got to help the developing nations get their mc'donalds, get their 7/11s
Ahmean they haven't even tasted the goodness yet man.""

Whilst ever there's oppression up will rise dissent
Seen through every century, the anger finds a vent
US forces - Just like WWF
Iraq's getting body-slammed - By george dubya's best
Keep pushing till the point comes - Where the people have had enough
And disillusion cause of ills - That are struck or are corrupt
Can't trust a cop, a politician or a tv set
Now everyone's upset
And yet they still forget
Forget facts
Remember brands
We get jacked
But bite our hand
The media is on crack
And (they) hide our heads in the sand
Now every Woman and Man
Sing your favourote theme song
That catchy jingle
Opposite to what really goes on
Our movement's strong
We're going from strength to strength
Your fradgulant future's - Something that we can prevent
We've come to cause a dissonance - Within your picket fence
If you still say dismissing your staff's - Good business sense
More protesters will die
As more companies collapse
So we're questioning the false wisdom - Lying behind that
Shout to the people - To stand against this crap
And revolutionaries who act with beats and raps",https://genius.com/The-herd-the-plunderers-lyrics

Darkened Paradise,Better Alive EP,2012,"Verse 1:
I flew here for a bargain souvenir at the markets and
Baskets and artwork, extra stamps in my passport
I've worked hard in my office and read all the brochures
These beaches aren't like they are in the posters
Shower me in roses (?)
Be on the walls of the resort
I hear gunshots, screams and calls
It ain't relaxing at all
I don't wanna see this, hear this, smell this, street kids, beggars diseases
I wanna do as I please
Cocktails, desk chairs, tropical breeze
(Hook)
Exercise a high degree of caution in the streets
Watch your back
Don't get lost in a paradise
Best beware of where you place your feet
Please come back to our mirage of a paradise
We advise you stay indoors, 'cos when night falls
In our darkened paradise
Every dream has a prize
(Verse 2):
You come and go like the tides
You'll never know my mind
Unless you spend the time to meet these friends of mine
In this new best place to spend your time
They're the ones who never smile
But when I told you all the trials of being me (?)
You just looked away and checked the scenery
And what was meant to be a problem
Is all too easily forgotten
And it's so hard to get to the bottom of this conundrum
Please come on in, I left flowers on your pillow to make you feel young again
Please come on in, be my guest
In my uniform all starched, depressed
To impress our visitors, well, everyone will give their all
Because there's a vast difference between sleeping on a bed and on the floor
And as long as you have a ball
And you tell your friends to stay with us
There's an extra dollar in it for me if you make our paradise famous

In the middle of a storm

That was 65 and that’s a civil ?right??

Verse 2 (Ozi Batla) :
Born near Goulburn at the height of the gold rush
Taught in Broken Hill and preached social justice
With Lawson she wrote about what a nation could be
Then moved to Paraguay chasing utopian dreams
She edited the Worker, wrote for the people
The first, the oppressed, to her they were all equal
A union is too radical but more progressive than most
She was scoffed to see her face on a bank note
Chorus (Ozi Batla):
You never lived your life like a riddle
I cannot imagine what you went through in the middle
Here I stand, inspired by a great, she was a giant of a men
She was a giant with the pen",https://genius.com/The-herd-like-a-riddle-lyrics
Same Song,Better Alive EP,2012,"And in the hour of chaos the beat got us 
Let the rhythm hit 'em with a little bit of cynicism
I see around me, fear of a black plan
With the clan in the front, but not Wu Tang (what)
I’ll never really know the struggle that it came from
I try to take it on and re-create the same song
Paint a picture for history to put a frame on
We going off with the brain on
(Make some noise)
See we're following the legacy of lions
Ain't afraid to speak to their minds, they leap aside
Hate the hate 
My high school syllabus was way behind
Now you love Aus hip hop 
Gotcha BNE merch but ain't done homework
If hip hops alive but white and sunburnt
Well that’d be a sad day for all concerned
So we learn and we carry the debt
Truly understand the cause to enjoy the effect
Check your head
Is this gangsta shit what we can't relate to
Same as the places movies take you
Do you really hate that US rap
Or is that a code for what you view as black
I hope not
I'd rather you pirate me then make me tolerate the irony

We all live beneath the stars
So when you stole the Southern Cross
I felt the loss

Following the spirit, came from the Broncs
All of the streets that the beat built on
Take it to the bridge, take it to the sea
Run-DMC where the beat found me
Look to the future but know of our past
Don’t let the Southern Cross block the stars
We singing that same song
Same song we were raised on

I understand where it came from
Sometimes it's like we're not hearing the same song
Makes me cringe thinking that you bringing shame on
The only religion I ever put a name on
Hip hops my bible, not my Aussie Aussie idol
When the chorus kicks in do you feel what I do
I yearn for the return of real rap music
It's made with art whether avant garde or purist
Always been about unity; a community
And just because you're Aussie doesn’t give you immunity
Gotta apply the same scrutiny
Not about radio play, more and express your self-mutiny
I fight the power moment gotta say something
You talk loud, say nothing, straight dumbing
I know what originators did before us
Though misplaced, patriotic, off key chorus
We're just people tryna begin again
So when the beat comes back I begin again
And I been pressing on you like a tattoo gun
Man you blind if you don’t recognise where it came from

Following the spirit, came from the Broncs
All of the streets that the beat built on
Take it to the bridge, take it to the sea
Run-DMC where the beat found me
Look to the future but know of your past
Don’t let the Southern Cross block the stars
We singing that same song
Same song we were raised on",https://genius.com/The-herd-same-song-lyrics
Comrade Jesus Christ,Cannot Buy My Soul,2007,"He was born in Asia Minor
Colonised Jewish man
His dad a carpenter
This was occupied land
Apprentice to his fathers trade
His country paid its dues
To the Romans he was
Just a working class Jew
Conceived few months out of wedlock
The stigma never stuck
Began a three year public life
And never made a buck
Spoke against injustice
Because it was there he saw
He saw how capitalism bled the poor
Attacking those self righteous hypocrites
And what's more
Condemned the lawyers' law
Even at their front door
But they've commercialised his birthday now
The very people that he defied
And they've sanctified their system
Claiming that he's on their side!
But if he crossed the floor tomorrow
How many of them would follow
Staring down their bosses
And even if he had to pay the highest cost
These agitators getting nailed to the cross
And being labelled radicals
Left-wing fanaticals
But left or right
He'd still be standing side by side
With the ones who leaders try to hide
Out on suburban housing estates
To be forgotten
Kept the oppressed and down trodden
Break bread with the bottom rung
A lot have sung to save their souls from church pews
The same hypocrites who turn his words around and curse you
And use the scripture just to justify their own greed
Puritans with closed eyes see what they want to see
They call the police with the bullet to enforce the peace
Or CCTV cameras on the corner of every street
Prevail against their false wars
Using terror to define us
Taking our freedom to
Spy on us
He'd fight with Joe Hill and Waleca
Mandela and FriereNoel pearson
Rohan Gillies and Lex Valencia
He'd feed the hungry and
He'd work with HIV
Understand the dispossessed and undernourished needs
Flee from shantytown to Campbelltown town
Amidst the people
A voice for the voiceless
And those without choices face bulldozers and battle tanks
A leader on bail
He'd fight the conservatives
And rot in their jails
He'd denounce what it takes
And demonisation
Ignorance and exploitation
A fortress mentality
Rogue states and hate
And sales of yellow cake
Increased in deformative rates
And he'd be known on the streets
Of sex workers and smack
And those with glass homes would throw
Stones in his back
All compassionate
An agitator for change
The world remembered his name
He'd denounce dictators
Even if they were allies
Even those in democratic disguise
And if he crossed the floor tomorrow
How many of them would follow
Exchange hate with a brave face
He'd stand on street corners
Where he's needed the most
And offer truth
And give them hope
All compassionate
An agitator for change
The world remembered his name
The world remembered his name
He'd condemn all corruption
He'd question all lawmakers
Topple hierarchies
And be labelled a saviour
See status and title as dominance in the politics of greed
Filling pockets while the populace bleeds
He'd fight against the racist hoards
Whether it be out on the streets of Cronulla
Or behind the boardroom doors
Or on parliament floors
From skinheads with flags
To One Nation
And all them talk back radio stations
Standing up against the leagues of the Ku Klux Klan
A fundamentalist
The radical right
Make demands
A socialist of a humanitarian strand
No one has been like

Clash and Collide,Future Shade,2011,"]
All the colours that make us foes
From the same brush the paint does flow
And the colours that make us red
Are the colours inside our head

I stood at the bridge, looked across the border
Saw that it was just drawn on, really just water
On the other side seemed grass was greener
But the face staring back shared the same demeanour, huh
When we're warring,  same old story
Only twice as mean
Our faces dirty, can't shake the hurting
Both grew from the same seed
Then the wind carried the fruits to different sides
Shared the same face but seen with different eyes
The sun and the moon rise at different times
Occupying the same space in distant skies
A thinly disguised and reluctant fighter
And the struggling only pulled the knot tighter
Until the desire to draw blood, it dried up
Until the lengthening shadows said times up

We will clash and we'll collide
As we try to shed some light
We'll take sides like the shores of the
Rivers running through our lives, but the
Same streams that divide us, unite us

Did we raise our fists to tick the box, or
Was it 'cause we're boxed in that ticked us off?
You and I we are manoeuvring to pick the lock
Hope and fear's something that we commonly got
Break, that's unlikely
'Cause you're unlike me, but we both bleed bright red
And if inside me, it's unsightly
Well, that's what we both share
And when one's different, one keeps distance
Anything to stay consistent, how did our instinct
Become so inward?
When there's nothing better than our co-existence
That's the summit, but also the place we plummet
There's a million different ways to cut it, choose one
One of many million why I love it
With the drop below we gotta be a bit above it, above it or get done

The feeling of freedom when you democratise

Trust us on it, crack some eggs to make the omelette
Better that than bomb it, baby, this is springtime, look at what we got potted
Tree will bear what we wanted I hope, the plant that we install is my vote
If not then sniper and murder she wrote, got it

Locked in, your type of awe seems shocking
With a headshot on a head of state, your peace can devastate
Our peace can't wait for a moment, thought we owned it
The truth hurt, ruffled the hem of a blue skirt
Then forgotten back to the well to drink the poison water

Grandma's Song,Future Shade,2011,"I was all I could do to stay calm
I had woken up, before the call had come
After partying all of the night before
I woke suddenly, at 5am
Didn't yawn I sat up and took the call
The voice held firm at the other end
Gently speaking of the things that were happening
And it set my mind racing, as I steadied with my arm
It was all I could do, to stay calm

I could not recall the number for the place
Nothing was open but, I tried calling just the same
All of my logical thinking, was scrambled
Over and over, just trying to get a handle
I remember she was apathetic
Plain as day asked, which account she could debit
I read her the credit card, and I welled up
It was all I could do to stay calm

I left as the sun rose by the beachside
Joggers looked at me, as they ran by
I tried to hurry my tears
And wiped them away, but they reappeared
I heard there was a bushfire back as home
And the freeway to get there was closed
I clenched my boarding pass, tightly in my palm
It was all I could do to stay calm

I found a backroad but it was closed
So we turned round and drove back, and tried to joke
Then the freeway opened up, we were on our way
Shortly before the call came
We had no words to make it okay
We just hurried back to the bedside where she lay
Goodbye I whispered, as I held her arm
It was all I could do, to stay calm
 x2
And I wondered what kind of song I would play
On the morning of, a day like today
Gently lift me up, show me the beauty

Well on the day my cousin chose a Tina Turner tune
A celebratory belter that strangely works
And I let all the calmness out, and the tears flowed freely
It was a nondescript Central Coast Church
Where I released I'd held in the hurt
And I let all the calmness out, and the tears flowed freely",https://genius.com/The-herd-grandmas-song-lyrics
Market Forces,Future Shade,2011,"You wanna buy some, I'll sell some
Of course kid, it's simple market forces
Raw shit is exxy, what you expected
If not you'll get the rough texture
Extra extra, read all about it
Over breakfast if you can stomach it
The plunderers will have their fill
Seems the CIA is still trying to kill me
The middle man is still gonna get beat
Even if the senator's daughter's discreet
Frontier hotheads dying for dead prez
Where gold is worth less than lead
Question is – who's the real pusherman?
I'm just one man tryna feed his clan
But beyond el rio grande - es otra cosa
Got me pegged as if I was the boss, but I'm not
Profits always rise to the top
So nos matamos — that's how they want it
That's how the planned it

When he says ""Doing there"", what he means, doing here
I tell him that I flew in here I tell him I cannot believe the ruin here
Yep, my guy's armed with live rounds
Security guards grind on the perimeter lines
Per capita the capital of violent crime, but
I get paid on time, so yeah
I got a few shops making a killing
In the region, in this city I'm a big man
Back home no one asks 'where you been, man?'
I'm a king, man, hundred-fifty grand man
Milk costs twelve bucks if you want it enough
And I sell it, imported international palettes
Have power, I don't need a ballot
I need a bodyguard and a fat bank balance
Felt like I met a vulture
Feeding on an old kill, it's a clash of the cultures
If you got a government official in the pocket
It's a trump to a gun in the holster
Uh, still gold in a city with a crushed soul
Young adults that aspire to a payroll
Knowing only ten-percent get it, that or be a rascal

My Sister's Palace,Future Shade,2011,"My sister I hear you calling
You feel your world has fallen
Gather your possessions
Muster up your strength and walk away
My brother now I'm pleading
My sister needs to leave now
Let her leave with safety
No need for more chasing again

Sister mother daughter
Not treated how you oughta
Cut off by a river
Someone burnt the bridge
Random acts of malice
From up inside your palace
Wall's too tall for scaling
Who's gonna do the saving
I wait for your arrival
To know that you're surviving
Smoke I see arising
Way upon horizon
Far from other shores
Escaping any laws
Get into that boat
With your hands upon those oars


None of this shit made sense
All of the biblical rules that it went against
What are fences for, to keep the trouble out right?
What if the trouble is in, who will save them then?
And the walls are thin, they hear him go at it again
Quietly sobbing, her brother his holding her hand
They dare not turn on the light
For fear of worsening the fight
So alone and frozen, both eyes open
Every sound magnified in the dead of the night
Their mum pleads and begs him please
Tears wiped away with pyjama sleeves
Life went about its business of bearing its teeth
Big brother being brave gets up
Little sister says stop
In the kitchen a glass drops
As a kid, dad's so big
Enough to drag em all down in the hole he digs

She is so withdrawn in class
But there's a world in her head
That they never thought to ask
I doubt she would tell them anyway
I asked her the other day
Are your parents going to the PTA
She said they'd gone away
Something volatile behind her eyes
That makes them nervous
And they haven't got the strength to ask
To scratch the surface
So she sits in class drawing rowboats in silence
Drifting away from a tower rising from an island
Her brother's got her back
But he's not always within range
So she fights her own battles
Girls think she's strange
No teachers that I've asked would even know her name
And would barely notice
If she never even came to class
I wish that her shame would pass
And mine would dissolve as fast
As the dreams of six year olds
She is so much older than her tender years
I wish I could do something to end the tears
Her eyes like a bottomless lake
Deep and clear
I wish I could do something to end the fear",https://genius.com/The-herd-my-sisters-palace-lyrics

What do we want?
We want that muthafucking bomb
And we never pause to consider if we got it wrong
What we really want is a magic wand
Sell it for a song
Whatever the Red Queen wants
Chase Alice through Saddam's palace 
?
 if your feet don't keep balance
Develop wings like Daedalus
Your neighbors get jealous and develop their own
But in the meantime consolidate your place on the throne
You prohibit alcohol and make a king of Capone
You had it coming, you better do more than running ?
Skipping is jumping its outmuscling them and then bumping em
Its evolving ever better ways of outwitting the other come on
The endless cycle tit-for-tat
Cat-and-mouse game and never end the risk of that, nah
Empires expire, systems collapse
Viruses attack, bacteria fight back
It just don't stop, keep running on the spot keep running round the clock come on
Watch what's behind you, cos now they're beside you
Before you know it they'll be flying right by you

What are you walking for? Run!
Run like your life is in danger
Keep running but stay on the same spot
Imagine where we'd be if we stopped... Go! Go!
What are you walking for? Run!
Run like your life is in danger
Keep running but stay on the same spot
Imagine where we'd be if we stopped...
Keep running, running
Keep running, running

The Red Queen said keep the refugees locked up
Or ship em off to Malaysia, trying to persuade ya
That we can take a strong stance, stop the boats landing
They said that in 1788, still standing
Well we're running on that treadmill, the polls demand it
Say one thing and do another, that's underhanded
Let's say racism was Hanson's invention
But she wasn't the one that put the kids in detention
But we really care a lot, look at the NT intervention
Running hard on the cure but not prevention
Now that's a ""Too-Hard Basket"" if I ever saw one
It makes your apology look like a fucking poor one
Send in the troops to control the pay packets
Yo we're taking the land
Well that sounds like the same racket
If we didn't do something it'd be time to fret, ha
Genocide through benign neglect, yuh

What are you walking for? Run!
Run like your life is in danger
Keep running but stay on the same spot
Imagine where we'd be if we stopped... Go! Go!
What are you walking for? Run!
Run like your life is in danger
Keep running but stay on the same spot

If you were born in the wrong nation - your salary's capped
If you don't speak English - then your salary's capped
If colour is an issue - than your salary's capped

And that's that, you got the wrong name
Like let's say Mohammed or Hussain
You sent your resume but never heard back again
Can't say why for certain, they're hiring other people
Man, it seems to me this mix ain't equal, but be cool
It looks bad if you act mad, and play into the stereotype of that man
Black, white, green or whatever, you gotta know brother
They've got their clique together, and want to rule forever

If you won't be a pretender - then your salary's capped
If you're not the right gender - then your salary's capped

Matter of fact, how bout we move past that
How does ability relate to my marital stat
Everytime I move forward, you keep pushing me back
Isn't it time we addressed the gap
Long time in the game, thought I'd paid my dues
So why my feet so sticky, I can hardly move
Tough enough to find work then made more scarce
By your assumptions of the load I bare
You want the skirt and blouse, not the brains and the clout
I choose the ladder to the top, not two and a half mouths
God forbid, ha ha, I try for both
Jump of the wheel only to find I'm broke

If you blow the whistle - then your salary's capped
Take the road less travelled - then your salary's capped
Pull them up on their behaviour - then your salary's capped
Your decision to keep singing the tune

You bundled him up in the back of a van
A private security firm, one man on remand
God damned by the justice of the peace said he's
Too drunk for bail, put him in a cell drive him through hell
So they did: He died, never saw the other side
Never tried and nobody guilty of any homicide
Stats do not lie, innocence does not apply
With deaths in custody a fact of life, why?

If you try to defend that - then your salary's capped
If the law won't bring a result - the salary's capped
We know the law won't bring a result - just salt in the wound
Sign the petition by singing the tune

Austerity package, and you're back in the club
Until then, well, the IMF is cutting you off
On a long list of creditors and no-one's taking haircuts
You'll eat a shit sandwich until you're fucking squared up
Fair? - nup, they're dragging you down and not their share's up again
Muscling your leaders, pinstripe hustling
Rich men with hand outs, belly up, sales down
Loving small government until they need to be bailed out


Palestinian in Palestine, they know who they're dealing with
With a foot in their neck, treating like second class citizens
Or foreign armies in Afghanistan: ""We will prevail!""
We'll win the battle but surrender holding up our hand
Is it cynical if it's fact you give it that
Are you another that find it difficult to live with that?
We'll shake the sand out your hair as you come back up for air
We'll give you a cap to wear, fucker

Shihaba,Future Shade,2011,"Even if I swear life isn't fair in a song
There's more than part of me hoping that I'll be proved wrong
The disappearing view from my, my ivory tower
Do I let what I feel decompose to powder?
What is my life worth, if I let that die?
That ideal, that I feel
Don't seem so surreal
What is my life worth, if I let that die?

Let me tell you 'bout the story of Shihaba
Of adventure of disaster of dreams worth chasing after
The first born of six little sisters and brothers
Duty bound to help her mother, it was second nature to help another
See that was bread and butter but she would hold it down at school
Not every kid can afford a phase of being a fool
Locked in family routine still a teen, future still a dream
The view of the world from home - all's not as it seems
Picture when she graduated, the freedom that activated
It hurt when her mum begged her to stay but she was motivated
By, the rite of passage, sky opened up before her
As she imagined what it'd be like across the water
With the desire inside for living the life only the fire burned
Will she be the same when she returns?

Even if I swear life isn't fair in a song
There's more than part of me hoping that I'll be proved wrong
The disappearing view from my, my ivory tower
Do I let what I feel decompose to powder?
What is my life worth if I let that die?

So she saved up for a year and used it
A return ticket to Europe
Excited eyes below a disguise of a naive tourist
One stop on the way included where her mum and dad were born
Sri Lanka just a postcard 'til she flew in at dawn
Warmly welcomed by family she'd barely met
A visit that was too short, now she back up on a jet
And she clicked between the channels in her seat, stretched her feet
Got the feeling that freedom was found at thirty thousand feet
Fell asleep, but woke up to ""This is your pilot speaking
Immigration slips we give you need completing
Please be seated as the plane descends""
Her heart beat faster then
Thinking 'bout all the adventures in the months that lay ahead
And below in the snow of Glasgow... she stared
And she remembers what her dad said just before she left
Of the importance of appreciating how adept the culture will enrich you
Illuminate the bigger picture, the greater issues, that despite it all unite us
What is my life worth, if I let that die?

You need clear eyes to see it
The reason to believe in
The good in everyone even when looks are deceiving
We're all living breathing
Real life flesh and blood
The injustice huh, it never quite be enough
To kill human kindness
Sever the ties that bind us
Colour, creed or nation
Yo they're not enough to define us
Let the singular nature of our blood stain the great space
Close your eyes and see the human race

Her navy blue Australian passport
Did not stop customs being sceptical of how long her stay would last for
Raw fear and confusion and tiredness engulfed her
'I don't believe you, you're lying' is what they told her
(Come this way)
Meanwhile others looked on, passengers she sat near
They could hear her pleading, being dismissed by deaf ears
(She lost it)
It can't be happening, there must be a mistake
(Panic set in)
The tears that took it in were streaming down her face
(Breaking down)
Arbitrarily deported, reported and recorded
'Shut up and stop crying', official customs orders
A rite of passage - the sky opened up before her
Humiliated she was heading back across the water
Desire for a life lived, the fire burned
Will she be the same when she returns?

Even if I swear life isn't fair in a song
There's more than part of me hoping that I'll be proved wrong
The disappearing view from my, my ivory tower
Do I let what I feel decompose to powder?
What is my life worth, if I let that die?
That ideal that I feel
Don't seem so surreal
What is my life worth, if I let that die?
That ideal that I feel
Don't seem so surreal
What is my life worth, if I let that die?",https://genius.com/The-herd-shihaba-lyrics
Signs Of Life,Future Shade,2011,"Stand, stand your ground
Form a chain, hand to hand
Start again, turn the page
We'll rebuild again

Although it broke our hearts
It did not break our will
We look for signs of life
We call your name

The chair that he leans against
One of many in a home that'll be condemned
Barely holds him up, he gotta hold it in
He can begin to survey the mess but it's so immense
The morning after the day the laughter died
With the ground beneath him cast aside
It looks like right after the bomb had hit
As if the house had found hell and cornered it



The human is the hardest part to factor in
Like how will they react when it comes crashing in
With a mad monk's grin or be compassionate
Hoard what they got or will they try to ration it
It's just a patter of patience, we're back to basics
How the moment left your heart racing
Hoping that the worst was over, blown outta proportion
News reader got it wrong, issued a false caution
But if it all comes true, what will I do?
The whole world cut off from my neighborhood
And strangers will react just the same as me
Probably meet us in the street to survey the scene
These times will remind us, of the ties that bind us
And everyone we haven't met yet, or it's hollow trust
Ie. all of us, or we're all dust
I, ie. all of us",https://genius.com/The-herd-signs-of-life-lyrics
Spin Cycle,Future Shade,2011,"You're not here
There's a sense of fear
Everyone's fighting they want to be heard
The excerpts state that it's too late
The people have spoken but where are they now
See I don't know what is real
Who is right and what I feel any more
See I'm not sure what's the truth of it all
Please won't somebody tell me the score

Follow me, follow me, follow me, I follow who
I see you hooked up on my feed too
So see through, another slow news day
What the people say
Spin doctor gotta get paid
Watch which way the polls swings
And the story evolves from rational to revolving
Revolving door debate centred of the
He said - she said, blind being willingly lead
Shock jock jumping off the deep end again
Scratching empty heads in intellectual dead ends
These are our core beliefs, our mission statement
That's util the public says they hate them
Then it's time for the elegant backflip
Some eloquent bullshit, one news cycle and that's it
Using stats to cover up facts
But 77 percent of people know that

And the polls put us in the lead
We're out in front we have everything that you need
We'll be what you believe
We'll be what you need
The illusion of conversation
That we participate in
This echo chamber going round in circles
I'll be what you need
I'll be what you believe

Enough of your polling, it murdered the surprise
Enough of that whole thing that got us paralysed
Enough with the holding information analysed
Speaking out before the findings of the focus group is ill-advised
But the findings isn't getting wise, what do you think
I mean, seriously, what do you think
Not the pitter patter bit of rat the media print
Where you don't even sound convinced
Ironic given we're the Herd, but these are my words
Imagine if I surveyed you people for each verse
And delivered in a country slang for the people in Bourke
Demographically more flexible if we don't curse
But fuck that for a joke I won't fall for that
The stakes are high but to forfeit that
What am I a robot with a battery pack?
Re-enacting the rap with the best reaction?
It just won't happen, there is no old Tim
There is no new Tim, there is just Tim
With an ability to say what I think
Without the need of a group
Yo to give me the hint",https://genius.com/The-herd-spin-cycle-lyrics
The Sum Of It All,Future Shade,2011,"What is the trade off in your life?
What did you pay? What is your price?
What did you weigh it up against?
What is the trade off in your life?
What did you pay? What is your price?
What did you weigh it up against?
Was it worth it? (one, two, three, four)

My dreams run amok, they don't take in my means
They break-in then break-out, they're making a scene
I wake up and leg it, I chase 'em with both hands
They float and don't care where my feet land
Gotta stay fed but you gotta stay friends
What I'd do for the roof over my head (my head)
The blood; the sweat; the tears I've shed
What I'd bend for the ends well, it depends
On the prize and the pride of the name I inherited
Dirty hands; clean heart; rose up from the sediment
I ain't tryna build a mansion or expand a settlement
Be an empty headed guest on Letterman, fire
Gotta keep the engine purring, and the fire stoked
Redemption round the corner holding on the higher hopes
Bigger than the music and all the liner notes
Good and bad, sum of everything that I had hoped

What is the trade off in your life?
What did you pay? What is your price?
What did you weigh it up against? (one, two, three)

Was it worth it?
You compromise so much
That you
Forgot what you want
You are the sum of it all
Is that what you want?

Report read she's a dreamer
Something wrong, we should screen her
How could they know of the carnival in
Her fix when life got grim
If only they could taste the real thing
Beneath their feet, beyond the ceiling
Like hounds they'd be stuck on it
Chasin', lovin', hatin', bathin' shakin' it
They'd be doped on the feeling of it
Move mountains clothed in it
Battle waves that swallow ships

Was it worth it?
You compromise so much
That you
Forgot what you want
You are the sum of it all
Is that what you want?

I run myself away-oh
Into the ground away-oh
I live up to my way-oh
My father's name away-oh

Once more at a crossroads, looking up at signposts
All of those lies you'll never live and cannot know
So I wonder, will I wander or hold my line
And find myself longing for what can never be mine
This tale's tied together with invisible threads
Lingering on what she said, what if instead
Of a missed opportunity it just wasn't meant to be?
Please believe I never faked what it meant to me
(Everything must change!) Don't I know it
In a moment hesitate ad you've blown it
You want to know the possible, but it would freak you out if you were shown it
So I'm holding my course until this road ends
I know the pen is the constant, but the ink is transient
More inclined to letting it ride than planning it
So I take my lumps, 'cause I wrote this story
It's always feast or famine, always death or glory

What is the trade off in your life?
What did you pay? What is your price?
What did you weigh it up against? (one, two, three)

Was it worth it?
You compromise so much
That you (compromise so much)
Forgot what you want
Forgot what you want
You are the sum of it all
Is that what you want?
Is that what you want?
You compromise so much
That you (you compromise so much)
Forgot what you want
Forgot what you want
You are the sum of it all",https://genius.com/The-herd-the-sum-of-it-all-lyrics
2020,Summerland,2008,"It's not as if you didn't get the warnings
You got the transcripts and recordings
History was a way of sunning herself in the morning
But you're a late starter make it easier to ignore it
Later not recall it, yo
You had unfettered access to the facts
But the fact is your back was turned to the atlas
Nothing like not being in the crash test
To help you make your mind up
Unknowingly the young sign up
The enemy of our enemy is still our enemy
So why are we arming them? Is this insanity?
That's how the Taliban began
Watch em as they turn around and aim their weapons at Americans
How's it feel to be a widowmaker?
Taker of the father of the family
Your tragedy is fate, that's the stakes
So scoff at the Saigon link
Flash those pearlies take us way past the brink

And we knew you were frauds
But onwards we went to war
Nothing could be said to convince you
We've already see it before

Someone could've told you it would end like this
We did, you didn't listen you can't take a trick
Lookin back 2020 mistakes I got many
And the truth is that I'll probably do it again
No one could've ever hoped to sway your mind
We've been there before but it's not that time
Lookin back 2020 mistakes I got many
And the truth is that I'll probably do it again

There's something familiar about the story you told me
The way that you mouthed it was not what you sold me
Well yes I'm one of many yet you ignored the signs
You made it personal don't spin me that line
You can't relax, cause it occurred on your watch
History will judge you cause you're all that we've got
Is anyone listening? Are you fucking insane?
Am I to sit watching as it plays out again?

The truth is we knew this, people aren't stupid
You play the innocent because you think we let you do it
If we think you're too ruthless
Show you where the point of the boot is
It's all about where the fuck your proof is
Keen an eye on that new kid
He's liable to do shit
If you don't keep a check on it, beyond your electorate
Peace in Iraq, man stay in Afghanistan
Looking for Osama, getting killed by the Taliban
War on drugs? War on terror, 9-11?
We knew where Johnny stood, where's Kevin?
Don't get me wrong, alarm clocks from heaven
Going off when the country woke up in '07
But there's no letting up
Yo we're just getting up off the canvas
That very fact demands that
We stay as vigilant as can be, transparency?
Another AWB, well let's see

Even as we applaud
And we show them the door
Thought we'd warn you that we're wary
Cause we've already seen it before",https://genius.com/The-herd-2020-lyrics
A Few Things,Summerland,2008,"1st Verse unknown
I got a few things i must do
Runnin out of times, nothin new
I got a few things i must do
No choice but to push on through
I got a few things i must do
Runnin out of times, nothin new
I got a few things i must do
Got no choice but to push on through
Yeah I know, 'been a 'lil absent
I can see that my tyre's lost traction
Living in a see saw like fashion
Part of me is compelled to seek the action
What it is is moderated chaos
And well (huh), maybe i can tame it with a day off?
A fire walk with the hot coals under me
I wonder if the companies will keep me living conformably?
The Grey-Hound runs ragged for the rabbit
And i never even got to think of changin' up the habit
Well i laid a blanket, sat back while the world kept going
I waved at him, ""you can all get gone!"", and if..
It lasted moment it lasted a week
Only know that im back up on my feet
Id refer it to the corners and the curbs
??????????
Right now im keeping it up for the tunes
I got a few things i must do
Runnin out of times, nothin new
I got a few things i must do
No choice but to push on through
I got a few things i must do
Runnin out of times, nothin new
I got a few things i must do
Got no choice but to push on through
The other day I opened this box from years ago
Like a pirate who had stumbled upon a treasure trove
You never know how far back the paper trail goes
Cross continental, well ""its mental"" as the saying goes
Takes some videos, meet some mates i didn't know that..
Id drift away from, never have to start from....scratch
Lets say hi to your perfect match, like the plans you made that didn't quite hatch
Looking for the magic key that fits this latch
Not just the matter of always striking up a match
And hoping to see fire, catch that wire and swing to what you desire
Now it's been a quiet patch, its back to the grind-zone
Chase up some leads and cross a couple of time-zones
I've been minding my own now im tired of The View
And i got a few things that i... really must do
Got a few things I must do
I got a few things i must do
Runnin out of times, nothin new
I got a few things i must do
No choice but to push on through
I got a few things i must do

Got no choice but to push on through",https://genius.com/The-herd-a-few-things-lyrics

But it'll be propped up by the all boys club
Get a bit of big business love
The uniform doesn't need to be cut
It doesn't matter who your dad goes to the gym with
Or the person that your mum gets with the face lift
All of the private tuition won't help the one that won't listen
No one can buy the rights to wisdom
You retain control over the ignition

Emergency,Summerland,2008,"The revolution will be industrial!
Well, charged like the Battle of Beersheba and Istabulat
And didn’t you know it’s all combustible
We got born again greens just because its tax deductable
I'm optimistic but the dots need to be joined
And now you lift a finger in response but just to point
That's the quickest way to disappoint, Maybe you missed the point
This is way bigger than the list have joined
We can spruik credentials. No matter how inconsequential
We treat it like essential. I could sacrifice a non-essential
Call myself environmental!
Anything outside of this is accidental
(New Orleans) Yasi!
Slogans are their mantra
We can't look to government and industry for answers
They only got a golden hand shake and a plan to abandon the ship way before we deal with the cancer
This is an emergency!
This is an emergency!
This is an emergency!
Calmly, you told me you had a plan
Even Arnie in the 90's had a car that ran electric
They held back the tech. shit! Now its gotten hectic
They can't deflect it, Not like its unexpected
Aussie kids dying at the tyrants directive
In the dust of the cradle of civilisation
The middle east was once well vegetated
Now, check out Australia, a fragile equation
Even the Anglican Church says that a terrorist invasion is not the real issue
If your waiting for an end to floods and drought; here's a tissue
The Nats will dismiss you and pray for a solution
Shame, there is no neighbour to blame for the pollution
At least there is absolution and carbon credits
It begins and ends at home if we let it
A letter to your MP, sign the petition
We're waiting on you man, to make the hard decisions
This is an emergency!
This is an emergency!
This is an emergency!
Calmly, you told me you had a plan
It was the dumbest thing we could have known
We take and take 'til there was no more
Justify the human breed. We are blinded by our wants and needs
So the seas will swirl, disease be rife, the soil became dust and dust become life as we know it
And you denied it, And yet you told me you had a plan
And you told me you had a plan
This is an emergency! And you told me you had a plan
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust. And you told me you had a plan
This is an emergency!
This is an emergency!
This is an emergency!
And you told me you had a plan
This is an emergency!
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust

Freedom Samba,Summerland,2008,"This is the CBD emergency warning system
A major incident has occurred in the city
Please take shelter where you are...
We hope that we never have to use this
But it is part of the security measures that we put in place
Are you worried that there are going to be a few
Bad apples amongst your group who are going to
Tarnish the lot of you?
I'm more worried there'll be bad apples amongst the police who will beat heads!

It's after curfew, so make sure that no-one heard you
Just the suggestion of free expression could hurt you
Untamed aggression on the faces of the faithful
El Patron is merciful, eternally grateful
Coming out the pep rally down at the stadium
Where they say the secret jail is - just put the cages in
Tear gas and horses, disperse the demonstration
Turn the native army on the native population
Official TV station has taken a different view
They say they're banning gatherings of any more than two
Cos the President lives in mortal fear of a coup d'etat
He's raised his own militia - it's autumn of the patriarch
Ordered his body double, ride in an open car
Distribute gifts to the barrios that done it hard
Some took the bait
They see him as the father of the nation that they can't hate
Others just can't wait to take back what they lost
They rally under black flags and toss molotovs
It's always freedom at what cost
The pamphlet they drop said that pacifism is a paradox
You turn the other cheek and cop another shot
Exiles wanna shout 'You don't know what you got'
Sometimes freedom is defined by what it's not
You never really know where the road you walk ends up
You've gotta keep your heads up

They try to tell you they're only trying to help
They'll lock you up to protect you from yourself
They'll lock you up to deflect you from their wealth
Create fear of a foe you can't see
Eventually now it's so plain to see
It's your freedom that's the first casualty

Tut tut go the paper - call 'em terrorists
Paint 'em as psychopathic murderous savages
Isolate 'em try and make 'em illegitimate
Pro-government sources condemn 'em on the internet
The hearts and minds of the people are with the will of the warlord
But they don't think of him as a warlord
You can send in new and improved anti-terror units
And move and eliminate, that's a civilian fate
Late night raids by nameless death squads
Small kids snarling at soldiers to 'Get lost!'
You don't even know all the feet you stepped on
Say you neutralised the area - well you're dead wrong
What about the missing we haven't heard from?
So there's plenty more volunteers to strap bombs
Doesn't take your forces long to catch on
This is anything but romantic - this is terror for two
Me with absolutely nothing to lose
Only one of us is seeking the truth
We wanna know the truth

They try to tell you they're only trying to help
They'll lock you up to protect you from yourself
They'll lock you up to deflect you from their wealth
Create fear of a foe you can't see
Eventually now it's so plain to see
It's your freedom that's the first casualty
They try to tell you they're only trying to help
They'll lock you up to protect you from yourself
They'll lock you up to deflect you from their wealth",https://genius.com/The-herd-freedom-samba-lyrics
Kids Learn Quick,Summerland,2008,"And they still build walls - to keep us in or out - I'm not sure
And they still build walls - to keep us in or out - I'm not sure
I am the sharp tip of the army's claw
Must look the part, must look the law
This uniform's a red rag to bombers
Knowing that my death would bring them honour
So f**k the scholars and their white collars
Your nerves aren't as ragged as this soldier's
It gets colder - feels like everyone's got a chip on their shoulder oh
What if today's the day my luck leaves me?
Everything is normally uneasy
No reason why it wouldn't be this evening
That's why every day I dream of leaving
Still they come - they queue
Clenched are the hands who are tightening screws
Control how their population moves
This is what the rebels are making us do
Alert and on edge
The tablets go straight to the head - I'm jumpy
They holding the scruff of the neck of the country
So much sun does the blood see
The checkpoint is teeth and guns
The bad apples make me numb with their cries with a request denied
I hate the f**kin look in their eye - but I don't wanna live like this
Let you in but not your wife and kids
Who may or may not aspire to by martyrs
But the state will clamp down hard regardless
Pre-emption as self defense and that might be severance for live rounds at residents
When even their children throw stones
That's why I can't wait to go home

And they still build walls - to keep us in or out - I'm not sure
And they still build walls - to keep us in or out - I'm not sure
And they still build walls - to keep us in or out - I'm not sure

Temporary, yes signed today - legit
This kid's making it too hard
The worst part - I clock on in five minutes
Are we at war with them or are we their Mexicans?
When testing them means resting in bed with a bump on your head for many days
Like my mother says 'we can't afford that anyway'
Which ever way you look at it
The lay of the land is crooked
Holy Lands mad shook with hatred
This road is ancient
And now the gatekeeper is 18
Which he's clearly hating
That doesn't change the fact he's still got me waiting
On land the UN states is mine
You can see how that frustrates the mind of a young man
Young man opposite - holding the gun
Telling him to stop - run - even just for fun
And if it gets too much
That other man runs
No such luck if a rocket struck tonight
We might be stuck for the night
Along with some tired men who might be up for a fight
Ain't seen enough of the light
Seems nothing is right
This kid's tired and it shows
But he's seen me enough times to know
Let me go - by the scruff
Am I Fatah? Hamas?
Why d'you give a f**k
Either way you won't let me up out of this dust
I see you through a cloud of mistrust
This affirms it - burn shit

Pearl,Summerland,2008,"Don't worry ma'am your child's going to be just fine
Nothing more than a bruise and a scratch - but you know that happens all the time
Just like he's got to fall to find he can - take it in his stride, he can
Navigate his way through and that's little more than a chink in the armour
Maybe he can be a mini-Hurricane Carter
Will he withstand yet more tribulations than his own father?
Nowadays hearts are rigid - a symptom of the world weary
The more information that the eyes get to see the more they get bleary
Our children will inherit all this and they'll say it's not fair
What we gotta deal with, don't forget that it's your burden that we bear
This magnificent constant systematic disrepair
Is one trait that every single generation must share
And the oldies can keep their fond memories of the good old days
But, at the core of it, well - maybe nothing's changed
These times have gotten pretty dark but the sky didn't fall in
At least that where we're at now hope a little luck calls him
Oblivious to his resilience let alone ceiling
He knows as well as anyone he is one in 5 billion
For your offspring's health it's worth all those tears
But I really think you can let go of that fear

I remember the good old days, no doubt it was a bigger place
It's a complicated rat race, it was simpler in my day
Yes burdens vary, and it's wise to be wary
Keep your perspective, simple pleasures aren't for sale

Now the future seems a fine thing - so bright that it is blinding
It can seem your destiny's so tight that it is binding
But put these new eyes in, kid, and see the world unwinding
Take the time to see the sights in - yo - there's nothing to be frightened of
'Cos night will follow day again and life is still the main event
Explain it - educate ya - it's mostly what you make of it
You're a first world resident - you're starting way ahead of them
You could rival Edison or invent a new medicine
Some parts of the past are fashionable - irrational
We focus on the contrast - less attention to the actual
What is right in front of us - it's not like there's no facts at all
One thing that this generation has never seen - and that's a war
They're clamping down for sure - yo - but it's still your stamping ground
Don't let them say it's all be done - there's still all that's not been found
The dance doesn't end just because they play the champion sound
There's bound to be a way to blaze a trail up in this fancy town
Ideas are like hand-me-downs - and the memories get faded
So watch for the nay-sayers - and the raining-on-paraders
It may not be brave but it sure is new - same they gave us
So dazzle them as a way of repaying the favour",https://genius.com/The-herd-pearl-lyrics
The King is Dead,Summerland,2008,"We dance like new years eve, we
We dance from sheer relief, whoa oh
Everything must change

The people that you projected us as
We were nothing of the sort, sold us all short
Put down the champagne, no toast to the legacy
(No way) And all the propaganda of prosperity
That's what a machine does and they don't need therapy
You turned us into a nation of haters
Far-right appeaser/ believer in whatever get you leader
Dog whistle through the speakers
See who bites it, I noticed a hell of a lot of people liked it

Conquer by dividing that's why you admired him?
Unless pushed we would never have retired him
Fuckin pirate history will damn him
Once it seemed like nothing could damage him

Crook, you got your arse played in Mandarin!

Finally the King is Dead, we cried ""off with his head!""
Everything must change (Everything must change), everything must change
We dance like New Years Eve, we dance from relief, everything must change

Nothing stays the same ohhh

Yeah
Cats I know are feeling just like the rapture
And I can tell who this mood is failing to capture
It's like somebody finally did light that match up
And burn down the parliament, learned from the argument
Can't be non-partisan, when you're an artist
And you put your heart in it, and that's not even the half of it
Like my man said, we're talking butter and bread
Better if his words were never uttered again
Mostly vindictive, who could have predicted
Just a few tax breaks to keep us all addicted
The dickhead dictator, leader, imitator
Made me feel immature when I said ""I hate ya""
Did you read the paper the day after and hear the laughter?
I'll read it to you, it starts with M McKew and ends with you
No broader view from the people on your ship that you used to call crew Huh!
That's typical, now I guess it's difficult
For the type of person who only thinks of individual
No residual, you'll see our resilience
Take your bat and ball and head for the pavilion

Finally the King is Dead, we cried ""off with his head!""
Everything must change (Everything must change), everything must change
We dance like New Years Eve, we dance from relief, everything must change
(Nothing stays the same), Nothing stays the same oh
Nothing stays the same ohhh
Nothing stays the same ohhh
We dance like New Years Eve, we dance from relief, everything must change
Just promise me this, no rose petal glasses, quickly confine him to part of the past
Just promise me this, no rose petal glasses, quickly confine him to part of the past

Finally the King is Dead, we cried ""off with his head!""
Everything must change (Everything must change), everything must change
We dance like New Years Eve, we dance from relief, everything must change
(Nothing stays the same), Nothing stays the same oh
Finally the King is Dead, we cried ""off with his head!""
Everything must change (Everything must change), everything must change
We dance like New Years Eve, we dance from relief, everything must change
(Nothing stays the same), Nothing stays the same oh
Nothing stays the same oh..
(Everything must change)
Nothing stays the same oh...
Nothing stays the same oh...

Time To Face The Truth,Summerland,2008,"You make sure your blokes don't go walkabout on Saturday, I want everyone there at least an hour before the game
It ain't like that no more
What?
I said, it's not like that anymore
What's not...?
Yo can't see what's not incarceration
And yet not one cop yet to be locked up
Palm Island lock up, look up, the sky's falling
Change courts, look the law's talking
Saying nothing that we ain't heard before
In my hood, the police step out the car door
Is it too hard? Or is that what you're there for?
Racial profile? Huh, and therefore
Assumptions get made
Man it must've been a good dose of hate
Made the country this way
Know they took the children away
And there's still two systems of justice to this day
Sorry - see, that's a long way from sovereignty
White fellas still get away with robbery
Seems like we need a big corroboree
Well we don't have to turn our backs on the apology
You can turn away or you can try to end the pain
If you can see how it really is
No time to entertain thoughts with one-blood yes of course
We're off-course as it is
Sun beats down and burns the white skin
Forefathers armed with sticks of lightning
Disease and booze with dehumanising
Cold iron of an empire rising
As pale as skin as pale as death
Got swept like floodwater down full of blood
We kidnapped children
That's what our enlightened pilgrims did
They killed them
This genocide – God's work
We don't know a thing about shame
Just Darwin's supreme
Pass the blame like we share a dispute
The racism inherent in the endless cycle
How can we celebrate Cook's arrival?
Now a whole people celebrate mere survival
What if your brother was doomed?
'd you be like Kev Carmody, he planned his own eulogy
We're disgracefully so far along
With half-hearted attempts to address the wrong
This is your land I'm on. We owe much more than money
But that's where we're restarting from
You can turn away or you can try to end the pain
If you can see how it really is
No time to entertain thoughts with one-blood yes of course
We're off-course as it is
I said, it's not like that anymore
What's not...
Youse white fellas telling us black fellas what to do
So much work to do
So much pain still
My heart cries out for you
No more excuses
No more blindfolds
We've got a job to do
I'm so sorry, we're so sorry
It's time to face the truth
It's waaay overdue
You can turn away or you can try to end the pain
If you can see how it really is
No time to entertain thoughts with one-blood yes of course
We're off-course as it is
I'm so sorry
We're so sorry
It's time to face the truth",https://genius.com/The-herd-time-to-face-the-truth-lyrics

Sing toorali-oorali-addity
We're bound for Botany Bay
Oh, what a tale I tell
They thought that they had me for raising hell
I never raised no hell
Nor did I rebel
They told me they knew me well
I said ""you've made a mistake, you've got the wrong man""
And screamed as they cuffed my hands
But they pushed me, hooded me into the back of a plane
Deprived of my senses and locked in chains
They asked me again and again
Until I could barely remember my name
What part I played
But it's hard through pain
To see their process, it seemed hopeless
To seem less dangerous, I admit
I named some total strangers
I'm ashamed to say it, but I think I'll say what they want me to say
And I know there's a freedom that's still in me
But they've taken all I have away
And the torture they do
Well it's killing me
And we're doomed but there'll be no escape
Oh, somewhere my name was put on a list
That's left me feeling the weight of your fists
Apparently I'm the risk
Worst of the worst
Where is the lawyer in this
Let alone trial
Just give me some sleep
Night the same ones weep and dream of home
Across the seas
Away from wherever this may be
And I know there's a freedom that's still in me
But they've taken all I have away

And I turned to despair
Man, I'm sorry I blinked
It could've been me that put you in the drink
I didn't have time to think what they're doing
Divide and ruin
Maybe I spoke too soon
A lapse in judgement
But what they're doing to me is beyond repugnant
At least I know I could never do that
So let's not talk of judgement
And I know there's a freedom that's still in me
But they've taken all I have away

When You Escape (Music Vs Fashion),Summerland,2008,"From very early on
I was absorbed
I was outraged
By the injustice of the day
What I'd read of to that day
It Conflicted with everything
I had been brought to believe
And my school didn't teach none of it
So underneath we used to wonder
If this was messed up, mixed up
Give the lad a pen
While he's still a boy
Watch what he makes of it
Can he make an ace of it
Before recreation and rap
What anyone and everyone
Rap (chuck?) was a king
But you jumping again
And waiting for that time to come back
This territory's untapped
Or at least that's what it seems
When to cops swarm
Celebrated for a God Com
Maybe we already long gone
Just don't let any of it
Interfere with escapism and a door to...
Christ no not even as the ship takes on water
This is how we view the world
Art is an imitation of life
Well throw away the air brush
I want to know what it looks like
Now I've scratched my head
I've chewed my pen
(??) in something else to say
The lyrics make you nervous
But you like the music anyway
So I'll stick to the hard stuff
And you can keep the throw away
The prefabricated pop stars
So light that they could blow away
There's too many (??)
For the things that they believe in
So what's the point of talking
If you say things and don't mean 'em
I refuse to accept it
If you bring the same old reason
That no it doesn't effect me
Well yes it does directly
And my music's a reflection
Not meant to be a lecture
It's a sonic insurrection
In the face of disaffection
And I've kept the fingers inky
And the mic was never dusty
And i bust a gut on Friday night
To make the punters trust me
And what is it exactly
That you're wanting me to write about
Sing baby baby with a crazy
Haircut and a tiny pout
I'd prefer to hide out
And contemplate my passions
I'm talking about music
And you're talking about fashion
Man, half of them are actors
And they rise from the same pattern
Pretending they're all accidents
That are just waiting to happen
And the tiny hands are clapping
'cause that's their demographic
They went straight for the money, man
What about the magic?
Yo, I'm not so tragic that i think
This music is our savior
There's no way that the bastards
Will be changing my behavior
At least i gave you something
You can get your teeth into
Some real nourishment, man
Some real soul food",https://genius.com/The-herd-when-you-escape-music-vs-fashion-lyrics
Zug Zug,Summerland,2008,"Oh, who booked the flights this early?
It was you Tim
I don't know - I point the finger at the shoestring
Cop a red eye all-nighter, that's not a new thing
It's all part of the fun to lose sleep touring
Amusing in retrospect, don't forget to check what state we're playing
Is there daylight savings?
The airports in Queensland and so's the accom
What, were we wrong?
Yep we're suppose to be on!
It's up north but not the straight out of Brissy gig
You know the one?
Yeah right I recall that night
That almost got us electrified - the water level flowing
Round the wires and the leads yet the show kept going
That reminds me of the toilets overflowing at the Cambridge
Not enough security, they understocked the bar fridge
Step away from carnage, we rocked it with Blades
Then I stepped to the manager to see how we got paid and he said
Zug zug zug zug zug zug (it's a charity event tonight that's Shelley behind the bar...)
Zug zug zug zug zug zug

We gotta poker table you can lose your per diems
Zug zug zug zug zug zug
That's what it means
Do you remember the prosthetic leg?
Man how can I forget
She took it off and wanted us to sign it (stop lyin'!)
She was fresh from the UK on a drum n bass odyssey
She said she had another one signed by the Prodigy
Oh shit that takes me to Pyramid you got legless
Yeah I popped my knee mid-set
Oh yeah you couldn't get a chair
So I hobbled to the end
And got some medicine
You mean the warm beer that they sent
It was activist, acid trips, tee pees in Tassie
Oh you're talking bout the forest festival? Yep exactly!
We lost our minds but found them in time to play
At roughly 6 in the morning - and that was the Monday!
What about the sunny coast ghosts?
Oh the kids that we saw by the side of the road, motionless with the glow
Like the village of the damned up in Coolum
Maybe they think we are here to school 'em?

Scallops,The Herd,2001,"Fatty cells expand when we take the mic in hand
Check out the land on which we dwell with the rhyme unplanned
Now central coastin', not like central heating
MC's minds meating like the lake meets the sea at Swansea
On solid rock, yes you know we don't stop
'Til we got everyone of you poppin like bottle tops
Like a stubby on the verandah nothing we planned'a
Just spontaneous banter when we take the chance to
Entice you to do this nice to whatever vice you choose
I think we prove that you got nothing to lose
By following us - in my tongue I trust
To get done what we must swirls of red dust behind me
So hard to find it so why try, getting high
Wide open skies and country side
Just gimme some beats and rhymes and room to thrive and
I swear that I'll always come live and direct
Inspect the jam from every angle that you can
And you might interpret the master plan
But if you don't I'll still be rockin' the boat
Chillin wit traksewt and tofu, lake side

Torches reflect in oily water, scorching sun
Ordinary laws, bored people run off the day don't stay
So they pack up, stacked up equipment and set out
The way to play at Lake Placid, snake acid, reak havoc
Groove grabbing, thought skanking, travelled on trains
Buses pains main lines, trusted train departing
We rushed it, discussed it, with lack of preparation
Separation from city scenes littered streets, reversed beets
Immersed in the heat from the batlas technique
Wants and needs, verbal speed darkness feeds
And bites and beats through the night that are sliced with a knife
Ripe with the rhymes that run through my life
With stacks and piles of pancakes and pears
For goodness sake I'm aware when we wake
Opportunities we take to break and break
And frantically tickle me; it's rushing all over me

Like a $3.40 bag of fresh hip hop
From your local fish n' chip shop

Clip-art cobras descending on wyee station
Not of the rave persuasion, we are our own rave
Trakswet tofu and I disembark in strange days
Swarms of Christmas beetles you have to get through or shoo away
Quick a select few knew what to do
Or chose or choose to fly to flew
To coastal aboads for tunes
That knew the wind that blew
No seeds be sewn it's all be blown in breezes
Reflective foils sonic releases and eases me
Essential, like sunscreen, SPF 15 slip slop slap on this track
When you wanna feel like summer laid back
Song gets stronger, MCs go longer
When folks in live shows nod along to their flows

Can't Breathe,The Sun Never Sets,2005,"I knew this girl who was drowning talented and pseudo
She was bound to computers just to make her bread
She would keep her head down though her feelings burned her
To sit around in her bed gown and dream of Burma
Alaska, Morocco, Peru and other places
One day she must of up and packed her suitcases
Leaving no traces but an overgrown yard
Box full of bills and a trail of postcards
He loves her and so he works like crazy
To try and provide a life that is worthy of his lady
Lately she has been saying that he is too often away
She is resentful of his work and all the time that it takes
He tries to explain that he doesn't want to be a martyr
But he needs to balance soul of his art
And then the crying starts and he watches her wilt
Over tired overworked overwhelmed with guilt
He's been on the run needs to be reined in
Weeks and months did it with the same old things
Reruns bring back days been
Feels like when he first realized his parents were aging (its lucid)
So free and so caged in but deep down
Cradled a dream and doing so
Just to hold on to it while all else speeds by
That nobody can take away
Needs time
Can't breathe cannot stop
You've got to be on the move
Be on the move
She is only 25 and she is always run down
She is working from the early shift to way past sundown
Studies full time night classes mostly
Two jobs hospitality to pay for the groceries
Hopefully soon the tips will get better
On the fridge late Uni fee the ultimatum letter
Meet her so exhausted couldn't hold a conversation
Is it worth it for the qualification?
This guy I knew vanished in the silver screen
Hated patrons talking cause it killed the dream
So he would see the late sessions
Make suggestions of a secret liaison were totally out of the question
Cause that urge had left him same time as the girl
You could say that he was saved by a magic world
Casablanca, Sunsets, MGM, trumpets, stumbling out of the cinema like a drunk
She was barely in control of the wheels
As they slid around the corner
She panicked as the vehicle got airborne
Split second whiplash all quiet then a squeal
In shock she starred at the steering wheel
Now she definitely won't make it on time
What exactly she was hurrying for crossed her mind
Violently jolted right here now
A near death made her see through the clouds
Can't breathe cannot stop
You got to be on the move
Be on the move
Can't breathe cannot stop
You've got to be on the move",https://genius.com/The-herd-cant-breathe-lyrics
Effortless,The Sun Never Sets,2005,"We never asked for your permission
Or requested assistance
So I put my hand on my heart
And beg for forgiveness
We had a point of difference (?) but god damm (?)
So maybe you better stick to the pond
Only when you want from me
I’ve been patient framed a few paintings
Some the emanated out of radio station
Hold the shit down like it was family traditions
Till the dead ridicule the living
So while I keep my letters regimented and embedded
Objected instinctive hecklers Sucked in and infected
Dope players making it look effortless
It's like SOS the herd one of the best there is
And Shock horror the dogs got no collar
All he got is on Are you waiting for us to spell it out?
Well I’m not indulging I’m loose jointed
You don’t like it then you avoid it, get it?
Ruff
Man just stop, with all that hula bulula
You see there’s more to this biz than homophobia and mula
It’s a movement the foundation solid
This pack of packet (dubs)? making your crew sound horrid
And little whipper snapper wanna get on the net diss
Then you got the gall to hit me up for the guest list
I guess this is nothing new you two faced jaynus
You best drop your pants you wanna talk out your anus
I’ll say it plainly, your ignorance is my nemesis
We shine on the track illuminate you mind crevasses
Like prowlers on your premises penetrate perimeters
And redraw your parameters with sonnets and pentameters
Bam!
It's time to settle it like sediment
These celebrants are eloquent and making it seem effortless
Elephants stamped beats smash clichés your encased in
So tell me, hows the devon tasting
Seems simple you make it seem effortless
Ease up on the breath just for emphasis
Take a shot you ain’t getting next to this
You're forever apprentices
Seems simple you make it seem effortless
Ease up on the breath just for emphasis
Take a shot you ain’t getting next to this
You're forever apprentices
(Braintax)
I will recline
I will take my god damn time
Talk slow say something and stop your mind
I’m braintax gonna start the cerebral flow
Easy though, still have minutes and words to go
Correction of depression, what my anger incurs
Steady in the rat race rap confurs
Never slave to the phoney
Tunnel vision ain't us
Can't see my light and you're lonely?
The same dubs check my carbon usage
Gonna out flow larva with my monsoon Stupid
Say something like breaking silence
No violence here we stay peace the shit
Say something on the track for peace n shit
Thermostat won't work and your copiers broke
Can’t copy me regardless stop the joke
Tug-o-war I can’t play but I made the rope
Seems simple you make it seem effortless
Ease up on the breath just for emphasis
Take a shot you ain’t getting next to this
You're forever apprentices
Seems simple you make it seem effortless
Ease up on the breath just for emphasis
Take a shot you ain’t getting next to this
You're forever apprentices
Player, you best just fold your cards
You made a dust bowl out of your back yard
It wasn’t the hard we just fed the crops
Back since when we gave heads the bops
Heads is lost his edge a lot but when they slip
We will catch them I stay anti-fashion
With a passion for perfection
As if each new track that’s rapped on
Could be a new direction
Egg shells you should stay on
With a HB, pentel or a crayon
It’s still what you say on
And on and on you could wander on
Chuckin' shit around like you were Donkey Kong
The time's too long gone for beating round the bush
If you ain't saying nothing, pipe down and shush
Being liked by the right people is vital
Is this hip hop or Australian Idol
Seems simple you make it seem effortless
Ease up on the breath just for emphasis

Full Moon,The Sun Never Sets,2005,"We pulled in that town by the bypass
That you drive past without a second glance
She's had her last dance
Yeah we took our chance on a street about four lanes wide
Dead quiet seven or eight at night
She was the 1985 tidy town winner
But now it's quiet after five you can't find dinner
Potholed roads just as the locals like it
Some top spots near by spoken of on a quiet tip
And the hire car felt the bumps
The only light was at the pub
Shrug of the shoulders we headed in for counter grub
""Unlucky son the missus has gone off to bed
I can do a bowl of chips or some butter on bread""
Sweet n' four schooies, three lemon-lime and bitters
One for the driver, two for the big hitters
And we eat quick as if it's last drinks
""Bar shuts at nine"" he said, after I asked him

Wind blowing through, ghost in my head
This lonely road, has been left for dead
Wind blowing through, ghost in my head
This lonely road, has been left for dead

""A game of darts"" the fella asked the only drinker in the place
An older bloke with worry lines that made a roadmap of his face
Now he could see that we were blow-ins
But was showing hospitality
Gradually we warmed when he chalked up a tally
He stammered a little hammered, but totally balancing
He leaned over and added ""Hey you up for a challenge?
Test your talent, but what you say you tell me a tale""
Tried his hand on the land, freight job with state rail
He said ""This was town of industry so many years back
But black years of drought and fire have left some fierce cracks""
He says ""You youngins probably don't wanna year that
I served in New Guinea, believe me son we adapt""
It's nothing to be sneered at, we all fought
It was a busy boom town now become back water
It went Telstra, NAB then Australia post
But when that bypass went in
Thats when we failed the most


Formerly a town of bushrangers I felt like a stranger
The air thin as the area paper
Days feel long as The Hume, few semis through
Never thought they'd see the day they give thanks for diesel fumes
Just two visits from memory by the local member
In the past century, to the war memorial at the cemetery
The train stations shut
So the only way to get north of the border is by catching a bus
But the bastards only stop twice a week
Roadhouse, got some yellow postcards of roast and peas
And the young mostly being city gives the feeling
That a home quickly becomes a house with paint pealing
This fellow was jovial
It won't be all over till the last beer's poured
Man, it's more than ceremonial
Our last cheers sure, raised our schooner's in respect
Had to jet full moon, long road ahead",https://genius.com/The-herd-full-moon-lyrics
I Was Only 19,The Sun Never Sets,2005,"Mum, Dad, and Denny were some amongst many
Who came to watch the passing out parade at Puckapunyal
Seemed every man and his mongrel came to watch cadets stumble
On the long march to the Viet jungle
""Oh Christ"", I mumbled as I drew that card
And my mates came to slap me on the back with due regard
We were the sixth battalion, yep, next to tour
We did Canungra and Shoalwater before we left, rest assured
Seemed half of Townsville turned out to see us leave
And they lined the footpaths as we marched to the quay
And the papers wrote it up like you wouldn't believe
But we were only looking to the future for fast reprieve
And there's all of us looking young, strong and clean
Rocking slouch hats, slung SLRs and greens
God help me, I was only nineteen

From Vung Tau in black helicopters
Chinook pilots seemed relieved at Nui Dat when he dropped us
Seems like months running on and off landing pads
Letters to Dad cause it's like, man, he's sad
But he can't see the tents that we call home
Cans of VB and pin-ups of chicks off TV
The heat, the mosquitoes and the noise surprising
Like the first time you see an agent orange horizon

So please, can you tell me doctor why I can't get to sleep?
The scars left in me?
Night time's just a jungle, dark and a barking M16
We keep saying, ""Rest in peace""
What's this rash that comes and goes?
Don't suppose you can tell me what that means?
God help me, I was only nineteen

Sent off on a four-week-long operation
Where every single step could be your last one
On two legs, it was sorta living hell
Falling with the shells, war within yourself
But you couldn't let your mates down 'til they had you dusted off
So you closed your eyes and thought of something else
Someone yelled ""Contact!"", another bloke swore
We hooked in for hours then a god almighty roar
Then Frankie kicked a mine, the day that mankind kicked the moon
God help me, he was going home in June

And I can still see Frank with a can in his hand
Thirty-six hour leave in the bar at the Grand
And I can still hear Frank, a screaming mess
Of bleeding flesh, couldn't retrieve his legs
You see the ANZAC legend neglected to mention
Mud the fear, the blood, the tears, the tension
Dad's recollection beyond comprehension
Didn't seem quite real until we were sent in
Chaos and confusion, the fire and steel
Hot shrapnel in my back I didn't even feel
God help me, I was only nineteen

So please can you tell me doctor, why I can't get to sleep
I can't hardly eat?
And the sound of the Channel Seven chopper still chills me to my feet
Still fuels my grief?
And what's this rash that comes and goes?
Like the dreams, can you tell me what that means?
God help me, I was only nineteen

Mum and Dad and Denny saw the passing out parade at Puckapunyal

Long Lunch,The Sun Never Sets,2005,"Top dog settled at Kirribilli house
Give me a can of kerosene and it get liberally doused
Miserable louts
You made my home a target for terrorists
And we created wealth and then we see you not sharing it
You be staring down the barrel of some pissed off youths
If you hypocrites on fire they wouldn't piss on you
They saw you and your cronies all rortin' the system
So they rort the dole and asked what's the fuckin' difference?
Only a couple of million not counting the super
And then if you want less than 50G you out of the loop
Like the rich you got the better tax accountants
Like the ones who made a molehill out of Packer's mountains
So for six years counting I haven't paid a cent
And if my 
HECS debt
 hit I couldn't pay the rent
Don't forget that these cunts who got a free education
Are the same ones that talk of mutual obligation
Lay back and take the pay packet
Top dogs all play the same bracket
Long lunches, cars and hotels
The boss don't know so don't tell
Lay back and take the pay packet
Top dogs all play the same bracket
Long lunches, cars and hotels
The boss don't know so don't tell
He rode the elevator to the seventh floor
Sweaty palms, collar tight as he walked into the board room
Trying to look convincing in his in fitting suit
He took his place before the panel for the job interview
Now how could you contribute the questions game
He's only in it for the loot but he's still playin the game
And telling them, what they wanted to hear
Bout how the advertised appointment was his dream career
The office monkey, he got the job
Prey partition, grey desk, grey suit, grey hair, grey position
Great hustles, he had the promos in the post
After hours photocopying the flyers for shows
Long distance phone calls international faxes
But soon enough his actions caught his manager's eye
Written warning, last chance he was put on probation
Fine fire me he said but think about the piece your taking when you
Lay back and take the pay packet
Top dogs all play the same bracket
Long lunches, cars and hotels
The boss don't know so don't tell
Lay back and take the pay packet
Top dogs all play the same bracket
Long lunches, cars and hotels
The boss don't know so don't tell
(Frankly, I'm just about sick to death of it
There's no corruption story
I'm not gonna step down I'm not gonna resign there's nothing
There's nothing there
I'm not gonna resign anyway over a good deed
There's no corruption, it's simply an act of good faith)
Look me in the eye and say you never saw it coming
Imaged by our good will hunting
By any means nothing
We stand tall but my minimum wage keeps cutting
You wedge me in and expect me to watch you keep cutting
Dolph Lundgren mixed with Mr. Ricky Gervais
You can consider this a tribute to the shit that you pay
Casual rates, evict us, shutting the drapes
Lower the conditions no one even feels for the place
You can have your caviar man I'll keep my crumbs
Paycheques that pay salary I'll manually add sums
So bang your hand drum, take production offshore
But John will stop falls through cracks in the shop floor
What, you're wanting me to be loyal to this chain?
This bullshit name paying me this short change?
People, have their revenge range
You know what I'm saying we speak the same
Lay back and take the pay packet
Top dogs all play the same bracket

The boss don't know so don't tell
Lay back and take the pay packet
Top dogs all play the same bracket
Long lunches, cars and hotels

Mischief,The Sun Never Sets,2005,"And the mischief we make
Feign memory when we wake Woaoh!
She's a hell of a temptress
No regrets yet, we intend to get reckless

""Look, most of us are on the dole
We can't even afford, mate, to pay for bands
There's good bands in there, you know?""
Just jumped offstage, half dazed, half hyped
Late Saturday night, let's not be here for the ugly lights
Something might be bumpin' down at the local jive
I'm open to it man, as long as I can socialise
With some exotic types, let's spit this drunken lingo
I got more penny pinchin' than a session at Kinko's
I'm kinda skint though, where's the cab splitters?
Grab the last of the rider to bribe the fence sitters
Stepsisters as it turns out, lecherous things
The kinda late night venue exodus brings
She wear a g-string well, like an inch above her belt
And if the lights are on at home, man, you really couldn't tell
And she fell down shouting, friends all pouting
'cause the bartender cut them off at ten (but who's counting?)
Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here
Yeah, it's time to bail
And so I'm flailing for a cab seven cats and Dale's base amp
Can you fit five, and two in the boot?
It's not far (come on son, fuckin' get in the car)
'cause a fight had just erupted over Fords and Holdens
Get pissed, punch on, take it back to what's golden
Wallet and the phone, keys, check, yeah, got 'em
Shirt still sweaty and wet, but no problem
The taxi almost hit a punter as we run the red
Overdrunk, underfed, ready for anything

And the mischief we make
Feign memory when we wake Woaoh!
She's a hell of a temptress
No regrets yet, we intend to get reckless

""I'm really digging this ??
I'm really into it! You like the sound of ??""
So what you reckon fellas, after-party at the warehouse
Yeah, nah, fuck that, what was it called?
You know the joint we were supposed to have our names on the door
My guts are spinning', progcrumb, it'll be chockers for sure!
That's bullshit! Man, what you knockin' it for?
Nah, cuz, I can't wait to see you rockin' the floor
A little shockin' and awe, kitty cat to get your paws on
The clientele here are bound to drop your drawers for sure, son
Watch the bartender as he carefully pours
1, 2, 3, hey, next round's on me
4, 5, 6, 7, hey, hang on, cunts!
(But I saw you on the Hottest 100 once!)
Woaoh! the dizzying heights of fame
And though we met, and you said it before, I've forgot your name
It really doesn't matter, maggots look the same when it's late
And, yo, I'm gonna take these mackin knees and give 'em a shake
And so I move across the room like an octopus
A spectacle of chaos, checking out the view through the binoculars
Opposite the bar side door, trying to sneak in
Some trashed cunts we lost at the start of the weekend..

""Uhh, I guess, I don't know, I like some stuff, you know, um, shit I don't know""
Degenerated into a free-for-all, sleazes ball
The people all writhing, dudes in leather tights high-fiving
Making requests, DJ, behind the decks, man he's shaking his head
He says, ""you're breaking my balls."" Baby, fuck your Nutbush!
Took a wild swing at him, it didn't do much good
And you can bash the DJ while we're smashing it
The bouncer said, ""You pissed kid?"", I said, ""Nah, I'm passionate!""
But the dregs didn't notice, they were deep in conversation
Trying all their best lines, for a night's accommodation
And when the house lights come on, it's just me and you
And maybe a friend, and maybe this is not the end
And still I'm making a dent, in a kick-kick-en kebab
The best late night minced meat you ever had

""Um, yeah, nah, nah dude, I gotta go, there's my ride!""
""Everyone else seems to be having a good time""

National Holiday,The Sun Never Sets,2005,"Nation time, the party day
And all that come to display the colours that make them like the others
The brothers and sisters come to wish the tyrant well
And dance around the wishing well
The well-wishers forget the cuts that were so vicious
At one day only banquets so delicious
They trade it in for the quiet of afterlife
It's their children that will feel the carver's knife
Of emperor's that they revelled for
Leave it to them to settle the score, what's more human than that?
Never look back, never look forward
Never forget the rule of law is so important
They protect us from the hordes at the gates
And they define us with their borders and states
Look through the grates down at the castle wall
And ask yourself if you're prepared to be the last to fall
In defence of the crown that you will never hold
That makes martyrs of sons who never grow old

Come wave your pretty flags in the air
Come and make peace in the dragon's lair

Each house put up red ribbons, and then cook great feasts all week
Children stirred, pilgrims returned
Quilts sewn all for his throne
The pallet(?) that he pockets, tax nonsense(?)
Someone is still taking kickbacks in
Where's your ribbon? Is it hidden? Get it up
How you gonna show the king you love
Look through the bloodstained glass
Commoner, you simpleton, you arse (ask???)
Never asked, only bowed to the great lords
Subordinate of the great sword
While you quarrel on immoral excursions
All the kings men murder
And the Empire cries ""Oh for freedom! Lead on""

Come wave your pretty flags in the air
Come and make peace in the dragon's lair
Come wave your pretty flags in the air
Come and make peace in the dragon's lair

Come prepare your penance and presence for his procession
With dishes of dispossession and whispers of sedition
Each and everyone must show respect
Fail to do so on the pain of death
A stain of shame, acknowledge his reign and swallow our pride
Another one cursing his name and a pox on his line
A watchman's sign of writer's symbols
Here's a rival, fly a ribbon red for sure
Survival swine who murdered and pillaged and burned
Ruined our village, will refuse to serve
Instead we'll choose to turn and purge this vile scourge
Notes been broken by the beast that burned
Cast the burden from the castle gates
Storm the barricades and take the tyrant from the tower
People rise, the time is now to
Claim your place in this, our nation's finest hour",https://genius.com/The-herd-national-holiday-lyrics

(""Join the Navy"")
Lost in deep cover
""Dear John,"" said his lover's last letter
Emptied a full clip to feel better
Slipped a rung on Jacob's ladder
Desert boot camp deserter got stung by death adder
Don't get mad get even madder
A10 tank killer fodder
Interrogate? Why bother...
My brother for a last cigarette (no please not yet)
One last dance, lest we regret
Look me in the eye, GI, and tell me you're not tired
I'm tired to death sir, I'm tired till it hurts
But when you thought it couldn't get much worse
Well it may...
We march at the break of day
And come what may, rules of engagement say
We will stand to the very last, shrapnel blast
A casket goes home...
Sons and daughters wrapped in stars and stripes to keep 'em warm
(""Give peace a chance... that doesn't mean anything""
""It's like give peace a chance"")
Under red orange dawn we draw the line
And those on the other side must stand and fight
Tracers like fourth of July in the night
Light it up like Hiroshima
The perfect sight

I'm a Starship Trooper
This is my letter to dad, transferred from Saigon to Baghdad
And now I'm dead
An allied soldier, with skin boils from Ebola
I'll bring you back a souvenir of what we stole
I was only nineteen
Joined for the pay packet
Now my full metal jacket won't take one more hit
I don't give two shits about oil interests
But depleted uranium, just gave Joe a fit
Captain Kurtz said, ""fight till the hurt stops""
Yet all I can see is burned crops
And mates shell-shocked
Morphine under lock and key
Their AK's talking to my M16
Pray for friendly fire
Haven't seen a priest, but plenty of funeral pyres
Triage nurses is dying
My name in the paper
Next to a faceless dictator
And another flag to drape
Hey yo, check
Here's the commanding officer
A total mess again
Crying in the mess tent
How to make mice or mince meat of his men

I'm a Starship Trooper
This is my letter to dad

And now I'm dead

The Metres Gained,The Sun Never Sets,2005,"I hear the oldies harking back to the old days
Work hard, respect your elders and the old ways
My grandma tells me about the war and her old mates
My great granddad barely ever told a soul, hey
Now his correspondence lay on pen and paper
But I find the cursive writing kinda hard to decipher
Apparently he joined in every annual veteran's march
My grandma reflects maybe he remembered too much
I wonder how much he could have forgotten if he tried
Fought for king and country's pride, twice he almost died
First time hair combed by a German bullet
And maybe that's why she became a hairdresser, I don't know
Left at 19 years of age
A country boy from Singleton way
Shipped to France, Wellard's the name
Anything but to be labeled as a shirker
The shame of being sent a white feather in a letter
Life is hell

Churchill don't know what he's doing in the Dardonelles
The newspapers sterilized til it's hard to tell
Say that General Hamilton is getting diggers mowed down at Lone Pine
Still they say ""there's no dying""
And mum the stench of death is so trying, well
We fall in line behind the British line
And hell is all around this 700 kilometre borderline
That's like a trench from Canberra to Melbourne, help me god
They're sending wounded men back to the front
While in the training camps fresh enlisters dormant for months
40 000 taken by trench foot, the feet rot
Knowing if you stick your head up you're for sure to be shot
Try hand to hand combat when it's pitch black and foggy
And unable to collect dead bodies, beyond sorry
Sorry for the sons of these nations, in death there's no war reparations
 {x2}
Life is hell, this is hell
Write me soon, hope you're well
Len Hall Gallipoli veteran
Gently passed away thinking we learned not a thing
Played the Commonwealth cannon-fodder, his ominous words
That if he had to do it again, he'd fight for the Turks
And the facts made way for the mythology, like you remember Bondy's victory speech
Great granddad, would you believe we're the agressors now?
New technology, you should see all the weapons now
Listen closely when the diggers say that we're forgetting how
You shouldn't railroad your citizens to war unless you absolutely have to
Never sell a war you go to war to defend
More than alliances in support of your women and men
Only once has there been a direct threat
Forgetting wars that we still haven't left yet
The next Tojo or Hitler I don't know and who wants that close to home?

And in those days, they measured by the metres gained
As then today, still measured by the metres gained",https://genius.com/The-herd-the-metres-gained-lyrics
Under Pressure,The Sun Never Sets,2005,"'My dearest Grandma' was the way he always started the letter
It wasn't the only occasion he wrote to keep it together
""Thank you for the birthday present, it'll really come in handy
I'm writing quietly, cause I hope you're not angry
Mum and Dad are yelling at each other, like every night
Like every night, I end up locking my door and I write
Would you please be able to visit, and maybe make 'em make up?
I'd hate to think that it was me that made my parents break up
Next year I'll be in high school, I'm pretty nervous, actually
Though I know it's common, I don't want no broken family
It's my fault, and I don't like it here
And it's my fault, and now my little brother's in tears
And Gran, I hope you're not mad, I swear I'll try to be good
Cause Mum and Dad'll get along much better when I'm being good""
Signin' it, 'Love, your Grandson', quietly he stored it in the cupboard
With the others, and tightly held his brother, he was...

Under pressure, I'm heating up
Under pressure, calm, but it's all front
Under pressure, boiling point has come
Under pressure
{Verse 2: Bezerkatron]
Fast forward twelve years, and he's been out of home for seven
Never really understood the way he carried it all with him
Even years later, he hated things gettin' too heated
Whole section of his history he tried to delete
New school, new city, reason justified his leaving
He couldn't leave his guilt seeing his mother's spirit beaten
She was bleeding, eyes streaming, he had to depart
Frightened sunken-eyed kid became the life of the party
Only been in town a term, social life like a soap star
Still wrote his grandmother the occasional postcard
""Doin' fine, working hard"", he thought that she'd be relieved
And perhaps a little proud of all the things he'd achieved
HD's and team captain, a prize in his class
A string of love affairs, but never close enough to see the scars
Kept the cards to his chest, stressed to less and conflict
Between the lines his Grandma only one who heard his bomb tick, he was...


""Child, I miss you greatly, haven't got many letters lately
I just wrote to let you know that it's OK to show when you're under pressure
Though I never really needed to explain this is true
I see a lot of your dear father when I'm looking at you
He worked hard, and enjoyed inebriation
And clearly that's a trait that doesn't skip a generation
Once removed, I see clearer than most, dear boy
I see though your illusions, boy
All life's lessons are under pressure""

Now he's old enough to know better, looking through those old letters
That he's never sent, he's sure the past is omnipresent
He won't resent the sum total of experience
From delirious days, to some so serious
""Never got those letters, but be sure that I'm hearing this""
They're really just signposts, landmarks, clippings
Some repetitive themes, like record players skipping
He has torn off the layers and always found something different
Inside him, tiny sparks like stars colliding
And they let him live again, he's never giving in
And without those few friends that always meant well
It might have never got to ""all's well that ends well""
Pen fell, swiftly, why he's writing now is still a mystery
Has the feeling history forgotten tends to repeat
So some nights before sleep, he writes to keep it in his sights
And when it's close enough to touch, he lets fly
Just to get by, by any means, to walk the path of many dreams
The penny seems to fall at the very last moment
The ability to love is like the vast ocean
And with lead-lidded focus, he writes the last lines of this one
And signs off, ""With love, your Grandson""",https://genius.com/The-herd-under-pressure-lyrics

We Can't Hear You,The Sun Never Sets,2005,"Alright, let's get this party started right and let your brain rest
As we just press play and play the court jesters
The stress...(uh), gets to all of us at some point
Until the DJ got you falling for a dumb joint
Dance halls held at gunpoint, with songs that explode and oversexed boys
Get the next toys and learning tools by no means, dudes
Brain dead, tone deaf, so fresh, so clean
Would now be a good time to say ""throw your hands up""?
""Nah, bro, just kick the next stanza!""
Don't get me wrong, I love it when you answer
But would you say ""ho!"", if I said ""Pauline Hanson""?
Live from the Elefant mansion, imagine
This life so handsome, holding the Libs for ransom
We'd arrive at every gig in a chariot
And Rok Postya'd have a bass amp with a trolley to carry it

Now, if you're sick and tired of the news reports
And your modern-day life is a blues of sorts
Put your head in the sand with your Walkman on
Put this goddamn song on and hum along... it goes
""La, la la la la"", we can't hear you!
""La la, la la"", we can't hear you!
""La, la la la la"", we can't hear you!
""La, la la la""
He got up on his high horse, and jumped on a dumb song
Never been in it for money, but keeps getting the punts wrong
He's offering his lyrics, but nowhere they come from
His name is Junk John, alias is a month long
Dumb it down deliberately, then renegotiate the fee
Hopes his opiates will open up a market overseas
But sober beats, irregular show proceeds (fuck that)
He took his bag to only eight ads in a row and unpacked
Eagerly awaited groupies up in his nut sack
Smoke a lot of weed, but when he's platinum, he'll cut back
Public liability ain't covering that though
Nor his rag flow, we think he a modern day Banjo
Battla Patterson, with a pad and a pen
It don't matter, as long as it rhymes, he'll be back back it again
He'd rather have it on them, but sadly, it's not my scene

(""Serious uncool, man
Where's my limo, dude?
We gotta go to Crackhead FM and do a spot with Kyle and Scrappy Dog!
Scrappy Dog? Oh, he phoned mate"")

Yeah, that's right, close your eyes, swing your hips
And fling yourself around with this song on your lips
Let your guard slip, drink, we all need balance
And check out, we rock a party with a stick and a carrot
And while you barrack for our 
Peter Garrett stances
And out of habit parrot all the proper answers
Indignant standards, chantin', signifying what's wrong
And then The Herd turn your concerns into a three minute pop song
So join us on a voyage, our immodest peripatetical
This dude'll take your blues on a mental sabbatical
Fanantics, jump aboard and appropriate it as an anthem
Or just nod your head and smile, try to pick up while you're dancin'
And chances they'll brand us naysayers
But if we add a catchy chorus, radio might still play us
Maybe pose for alley photos with scowling hoodlums
Or bootleg my sex tape with Delta Goodrem

Somethin' in the air is gettin' dangerous (Somethin' in the air)
Somethin' in the air is gettin' dangerous
Everybody watchin' us, hey, oh, ha

We're just bodies
We are bodies in the night
Move your body
Move your body in the light
Trust nobody
Trust nobody in the fight
We're just bodies
We are bodies in the night

Woah—oh—oh—oh, woah—oh—oh—oh
We're just bodies in the night, woah—oh—oh—oh
Woah—oh—oh—oh, woah—oh—oh—oh
We're just bodies in...

Telling us to let go (Let it go)
Just shrug it and you'll forget it, yo
The situation's regrettable
We're all just scrollin' to forget it all (To forget it all)
They say the uprisin' ain't right (The uprisin' ain't right)
They pay a rebel for a soundbite
Whatever the help you sleep tight ()
They see a helmet and paint it white
This is for us, what do they know? (What do they know? Yeah)
Never had to make another home
They salt the earth when their cover's blown
Five eyes on another zone
And we could do it all night (We can do it all night)
'Cause this fight put bodies in flight
Scattered across the black sites
Just a matter of gettin' your facts, and that's why

All our friends are watching us, it's become serious
Somethin' in the air is gettin' dangerous (Somethin' in the air)
Somethin' in the air is gettin' dangerous
Everybody watchin' us (Everybody watchin' us)
All our friends are watching us, it's become serious
Somethin' in the air is gettin' dangerous (Somethin' in the air)
Somethin' in the air is gettin' dangerous
Everybody watchin' us, oh, uh

We're just bodies
We are bodies in the night
Move your body
Move your body in the light
Trust nobody
Trust nobody in the fight, no
We're bodies
We are bodies in the night

We're just bodies
We are bodies in the night
Move your body, yeah—ayy
Your body in the light
Trust nobody
Trust nobody in the fight, no
We're bodies
We are bodies in the night
We're just bodies
Come on and move your body
Trust nobody
We're just bodies
We are bodies in the night",https://genius.com/The-herd-bodies-lyrics
A Change Is Gonna Come,triple j Like a Version 8,2012,"I was born by the river
In a little tent
Oh, and just like the river
I've been running ever since

It's been a long
Long time coming
But I know
Change gon' come
Oh yes it will

I was born by the river in a small coastal town
Where the smell of the strange fruit still floats around
I was shown that tree where the fruits used to swing
They was strung up as  swayin' in the wind
With blood on the wattle, trees with lifeless limbs
I turned away and then cringed, mum said ""Listen to them sing""
Then I heard the breeze bring the terrible thing
All that's changed now is that rope's a tire swing

Change, well it won't happen in a day
They said eventually, how many weeks, decades or centuries?
Mistakes made, they can't be washed away so simply
And symbolisms weak medicine for grievous injury
False smiles, frontin' false idols hiding discrimination
A feel good slogan, some self congratulation
Empty statements, while the hangman's ghost is still waiting
In the lockup, the paddy wagon, 12 shells on the pavement

It's been too hard living
But I'm afraid to die
'Cause I don't know what's up there
Beyond the sky

It's been a long
Long time coming
But I know
Change gon' come
Oh yes it will

Ayy
It's all about history but that's his story and I'm tryna tell ya 'bout mine
Still coppin' chases from the bacon, my brother taken by swine
They're the biggest gang in my country, the ones that pack the Glock Nine
And them guns be with them Gunjies who say they're here to stop crime
Now that ain't that ironic, no Alanis, but you oughta know the truth
The Queen was boss when they stole us, the Kings Cross and they shoot
Surrounded by abuse, lemme tell what I'ma do
I'ma rep for all my youth with the big F.U. to the boys in blue
They picked the wrong time

Go to the movie
And I go downtown
Somebody keep telling me
Don't go hang around

It's been a long
Long time coming
But I know
Change gon' come
Oh yes it will

We thought the war was over, but nah, we have to fight more
We got the right to vote, but I don't see no one to vote for
Devoted to the cause, I live for everything I'd die for
Yeah, have my shoes, take a walk, try to understand my life and
My dreamin', the government is scheming
Oops, I mean they're intervening
Mind the land while we're leavin', but we ain't leavin'
These words are my last 
The past can't be changed but our future can

So I go to my brother
And I say brother help me please
But he winds up knockin' me
Back down on my knees

First up, I'ma change the flag, southern cross, leave that
Exchange the union jack for that red, yellow and black
Sick and tired of waiting for change so I'm making a change today
An' I beg that my people out beggin' be given a new begginin', okay!
A long time (Long time) Too long if you asked me
(Said a change gon' come) Long gone (Long gone) Has been
Only way to move on is to get along, you better not get it wrong
'Cause after all (Aren't we all) one under the sun, I'm done

Oh, there's been times when I thought I couldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able to carry on

It's been a long
Long time coming
And I know
Change gon' come
Oh yes it will",https://genius.com/The-herd-a-change-is-gonna-come-lyrics
Apocalypta,,2005,"*radio chatter*
The command came, hold your fire
And if I ever meet that man I’ll ask him, why we were put on standby, while the scenario got dire?
Peace-keeper with no teeth, can inforce no peace and just becomes an eyewitness to grief
Number of times I wished to leave…
Couldn't believe that we were here for nothing more than the lip service
Nothing more than the empire servants, trigger finger oh so nervous
Number of times I almost let the bullets go, the footage shows
The day approached to the checkpoint, with hands raised the civilian closed
Vincedin shooter he went home, awaiting an inquest who's to know
If the punishment could be worse, in his own thoughts when he's all alone
And I wish he could've been here, when we really needed a shooter
We stood by and watched as the town we protected was pillaged, raped and looted
We were hamstrung, the commands come from HQ
And blood on their hands is the last thing they wanna report
To the politicians that they answer to
So what am I supposed to do?
Why am I here, dyin' of fear?
That the faces staring up at me will continue to appear
And the dreams that wake me up in fits and sweats, and all the counsellor has said
Won’t let me forget about Shreve rent it say yet
-----
Overnight trucks in convoy, butte red cross on the side and the back
Escorted by two gene officers on the off chance they’d be attacked
On a private contract, roads are a gauntlet, trouble none yet reported
Guards get little commission as we ride the soldier and reach the border
Now he’s got medical supplies for a refugee camp, humanitarian mission
Held up a week at customs, took over a month to ship from Switzerland
He knows nobody would be listening, and as the burials start increasing
So he keeps the frustration under rapped as seen that it’s self-defeating
And though he joined up to make a difference, good intentions can turn out vicious
As they helplessly provide aid for cancer disbanded militias
They got caches of illegal arms, hidden away in the country-side
Former colonial rules ensure they get yet more clandestine supply
Seening won’t as broken down to their former selves
Till their not so afraid of death ‘cause they’ve already seen hell
The danger pay is good but every cent that he gets is earnt
And he’s alive, but burnin out, driving through the scorched dirt
Then all in all, it’s worth it even if it’s for the little victories
Standing by as a witness to the dark rumblings of history
-----
We left home as heroes
With photo ops and press releases, a handshake from the minister
And a speech of freedom shining
Peters of democracy, the monitors of freedom’s fair elections
Midwifes to assist the birth of a distant fledgling nation
As we taxied out of Williamstown, you could smell the nerves in the Hercules
Excitement and uncertainty, prestigious posting overseas
We deployed through the provinces, out project voter education
To dispel fears of retribution well to local staff and a Thai policeman
Campaign worked and ten months later
The battle was held and turned out greater than expected
The result unknown, then the call came through on the satellite phone
Projectiles thrown in some locations, mobs attacking holding stations
HQ called evacuation and ordered our withdrawal
We sheltered in the compound while militias torched the town
The glow of burning buildings as night fell, had tensions running high
The flow of refugees and a praiser wife (?) to the protection of our presence
Automatic gunfire rang out premeditated menace
And calls for backup to Canberra were met with silence and indecision
Domestic interventions outside the mandate of this mission
And at dawn the order came, for all essential personnel
At 0900 the choppers would come to fly us out of hell
Now how can I meet the eye?
Of this man that I’ve worked beside
And tell him that I’m free to leave today while he is sure to die
I wanna hide, don’t understand how these people can be abandoned
And I wonder, if the minister will be there to meet us when we land",https://genius.com/The-herd-apocalypta-lyrics

Got the coolwhip kidden, mom’s mercedes
Come into my party, it’s me and iCarly
Batman and Robin coming, now you are chopped meat
Cook you up in chili then I feed it to your Mommy
AK-47 incase the neighbors try to rob me
Ten-hut, left-right-left
Rock and roll from my birth till death
Gretta Garbo in the backseat relaxing
Swish and gargle tough actin’ Tinactin
Calming down Madden. Rock and roll
That’s all we do is just rock and roll, we rock and roll, we rock and roll
Now do the white people on the fucking dance floor",https://genius.com/The-herd-do-the-white-people-lyrics
