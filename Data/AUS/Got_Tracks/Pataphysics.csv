First Casualty,,2017,"Verse 1
The news is Pr for the rich
Shifting the focus and maintaining groupthink
Manufacturing consent,  it's building up dissent but nothing happening with even 99 percent
It ain't about facts,  what that narrative lacks
And about redrawing borders on the cognitive map
Damn man,  propaganda gone outta hand
With a plan to give all refugees a lifetime ban
The leaders had them fooled
It started in the schools
Preventing revolutionaries was a golden rule
No need to control with the fear and violence, cripple with apathy
Hear the silence,  power will always take subsidised by the state
Over saturation of information but what is fake
Political processes’ don't work
Systems of government don't work
Free market economics don't work
Legal, judicial homie it don’t work
Hook
That old grey mare it ain't what it used to be
Said it ain't what it used to be
Coz Ain't nothing ever free
That old grey mare it ain't what it used to be
Said it ain't what it used to be
Where truth the first casualty
Verse 2:
If the Law is reason from passion
It’s fashioned by federal institutions irrational
Resistance transnational, as  production of capital
Hope within a people, woke  dreamers vote factional
Now it don’t even matter if the thieves get caught
Devoid of consequence legislatures been bought
There's no critical thought  Cause it's never been taught
Since after after Vietnam we don’t see the war fought
The devil learn quick Armed new tricks
PR campaigns, reactionary politic
Contract private military security forces
Mercenaries for hire that easily cross borders
Flying under the banner of corporate orders
Not safe for local activists or even Reporters
Finite probability, total system collapse",https://genius.com/Pataphysics-first-casualty-lyrics
