Chemical Haze,,2017,"[Verse 1: Adam Koots]
Am I creating medication?
Or Scrambling your molecules like radiation?
Examining a patient, a gathering of ancient patterns on a page
How i'm practicing my ways
I burn sage then I enter the stage
I make my name rocking off of minimum wage
I been caught up in a chemical haze
Trapped deep in a spiritual maze
The sacrifice is the price that I pay
Until i'm frozen up like an ice tray
I been trying to open up the eye in my brain
You an I are the same
They want to see me burning up in the fire and flames
I admire the game
Even if they think i'm not entirely sane
And I don't give a fuck what society's saying
Im swinging my blades on a front line of life
Fuck the fame, I'm a prophet in my own right",https://genius.com/Must-volkoff-chemical-haze-lyrics
Poison,,2013,"[Sample: Cary Elwes]
All right: where is the poison? The battle of wits has begun. It ends when you decide and we both drink, and find out who is right and who is dead

[Intro: Fluent Form]
Yeah, yeah
Return of the 4Aces
Fluent Form, Mata, Must
One slash six

[Verse 1: Mata]
Never stoppin' the blood flow, deep as the Capulet love go
Marked by the skull and the crossbow
It's the return of the spade, heart, diamond, club
Four images, all have got that Midas touch
Don't breathe in my vapours or succumb to the toxins
Found in my cadence
Pump the adrenal that gettin' amped when it comes to a sequel
Take a shot without flickin' the needle
The drop of my ink can either leave you paralysed
Or send on a one-way trip back to paradise
Like ingesting Formaldehyde
Hard to swallow, Mortein to a parasite
Sink your teeth in, take this and capture
The body may end to take another form of matter
Drink a dose, hope the present not apparent
I'm poised to the sun playing out the full gamma


[Verse 2: Fluent Form]
Graphs poisonous, venom from snake bites in my pen
Causin' paralysis, you see 'em red like brake lights
Breathin' becomes laborious
Smugglin' scorpion tails, extract toxins in the late night
This the writing of the nomad traveler
Scavenger, using poison ivy for a note pad
Brought pests aside for those bugged
Your nose runnin' the fever glandular, the antidote's hunted (Hush) Though what they're tryna find (what's that?)
Was laced with the cyanide, placed inside the rhymes they write
'Cause if they lackin', they contractin' a rash for the itchin'
That slowly arrest the cardiovascular system
Uh, now I'm back like Lazarus spittin'
Knapsack packed with them packets of hazardous mixtures
Sprinkled on your dinner plate (uh-huh)
Fate accelerate like interstate crash in the distance

[Turntablism: Must Volkoff]
""Poisonous""
""Poi-poi-p-
""Poisonous""
""Poison bars from the gods bust holes in your mirage""

[Verse 3: Must Volkoff]
One splash becomes a lethal dose, makin' flavourless additions
To the recipe to entice the enemy that gets
Copped a flush from a greener chrome
Yo the rush with no remedy
Pain in the gullet through the stomach
Make you howl like a pack of wolves, feelin' like you must
Have reached in, ripped your guts out and stitched you up
With a rusty medieval tool, visions of your life
Flashin' through your mind, I'm hopin' you don't die
Before the drugs got you seein' ghouls, dish your dinner out
The caldroun, soul-snatchin' skeletons patrollin'
Watch you roll up and eat the grool
Toxins in the pan for the fam like Mary Ann Cotton
Prize winnin' jams undefeatable
Creatin' symptoms untreatable, grotesque and inconceivable
Lines ghostwritten by a dead author, make you sweat
And feel cold, makin' your breath short, you tell 'em all to torture


[Verse 4: One Sixth]
I spit sick grime one slash six is all a pig gristle
Physically feel me embedded in your intestines
When I'm getting a beating, [?] you're gettin' turned off
Yo, I'm talkin' 'bout life support at your bedside
Stiff spine, eyes glazed over
You'd be lucky if you blink twice when I take over
You'd be guppy when I get mine, I might make a corpse
Of your cremated, assorted decorative ornaments
Converted many a man to a memory
For many centuries, many drank to forget with me
So many Alpha Romeos, they're all like Juliet to me
Put you asleep when I'm registered in your chemistry
Deep, feel it burn like a rupture split
Warned that you couldn't stomach me, ask me to keep you company
Sulphuric citric phosphoric liquid
Shock cause statistics lost Jordan's slipping, tripping off the venom
Poison

[Turntablism: Must Volkoff]
""Poisonous""
""Poi-poi-p-
""Poisonous""
""Poison bars from the gods bust holes in your mirage""""Poi-poi-p-""Poisonous paragraphs""
""Poi-poison-poi-p-p-
""Poison bars from the gods bust holes in your mirage""


[Outro]
""Once the poison gets into your bloodstream, you will start to see what I can only describe as the most extraordinary display of blue objects.""
""Well, I'm not worried. That Peter that came in today. It contained a dose of poison. You're gonna die any minute now, I promise you.""
