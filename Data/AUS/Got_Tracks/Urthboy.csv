Last Chance,Distant Sense of Random Menace,2004,"Somewhere in the desert is a telegraph pole
Holding up a telephone line full of copper wires
With your voice and mine and a profound silence
Trying to build a word-bridge between our islands
I'd like to hold you but like I told you it's hard
To look beyond tomorrow with this wounded heart
Like a lion tamer who got mauled by his favourite
This memory's still painful, time won't erase it
And you've been through the same shit, ain't this, strange how, life shifts
When you least expect it, Cupid beckons
And love can live or die in a second
So I'll say it now or forever wonder if, if
Would our grip have slipped or was this the real shit?
I pour some more change into the payphone
And If there's something that you gotta say, please say so

The last chance, this'll be the last time
This'll ever feel like this so don't miss
The last chance, this'll be the last time
This'll ever feel like this so don't miss

I met her when I wasn't in a good state
Sore sight couldn't sleep right toss and turning all night
You see I've never been a ladies man so wasn't like
I whispered softly in her ear ""yo baby let me take your hand""
I try to play it cool though inside I'm inanimate
Frozen up impossible to play like a real candidate
Yeah I'm an MC they all call me 'wordsmith'
But somehow the context changed and all the words miss
But who'se to say you're not my life's purpose, It's Urth
At your service, for once there's no question I'm certain
But little does it translate, until the dam breaks
I've got no rabbit in my hat yeah I'm not Mandrake
I haven't got a trick, and no pick-up line
Give me a sign and I'll repay it in kind
Multiply it a by a dozen and we can call it a day
And if you were inside my arms then this is what I would say

The last chance, this will be the last time
This will ever feel like this so don't miss
The last chance, this will be the last time
This will ever feel like this so don't miss

I would've told you I was inspired, in awe
Enthralled captivated by the way you bring
Your self to the task, food for the starved, love
For the heart, talking deeply, still sharing laughs
And if I'm half what you are well I'm content
When I have a couple kids I hope to pass on your sense
And damn, I've seen the way that life can slip through the fingers
Death might interrupt but the love will still linger
My friend said that losing love is like a death
But then love lingers long after the final breath
And these sentiments I'm thinking of in retrospect
Got me really wishing that you hadn't left us yet
And if I'd known of what you were gonna do what could I say?
A magic phrase or two which would've made you stay?
In the storm cloud of your life you were the silver lining
And in each one of our hearts your star is still shining

Resolve it all before you sleep man
This could be your last chance (this could be your last chance)
It's water underneath the bridge man
This could be your last chance (this could be your last chance)
Because no one lives forever man
This could be your last chance (this could be your last chance)
It's either do it or regret it man
This could be your
 {x2}
Last chance, this will be the last time
This will ever feel like this so don't miss
The last chance, this will be the last time
This will ever feel like this so don't miss",https://genius.com/Urthboy-last-chance-lyrics
No Rider,Distant Sense of Random Menace,2004,"I was working as an MC the other day
With a cup o' instant coffee and some marmalade
It's hard to play when just wanna run away
It's underlay underlay since underage
Then the phone rang ""It's Urthboy here
I'm Elefant Traks just like Kenny Sabir""
""Hi, someone led me to believe you're an MC
I've got an offer that would maybe even tempt me
What I meant means we give you a set fee
You play at our gig for peanuts and a little prestige""
Ah so the rest see me as a success
But I'm struggling to pay rent with records to press
But yes I agree to it, how can you not?
Thinking of the fluid with the international slot
I've got no time for rhymers, slash social climbers
It's just another gig I'm doing for the rider

There is no rider my friend, so why we doing this then?
We all go broke by night end (like, broke as hell, can't you tell)
There is no rider my friend, so why we doing this then?
We all go broke by night end (broke as hell, it's not hard to tell)

Leave the house, lock the door, catch the bus
Or the train, it's a rush tame the peak hour crush
To the venue, nothing but trouble on the menu
Cock-rocking headstrong soundmen to get through
This shit can really send you to the pub next door
Either that or make sure he leaves with a broken jaw
(Ahh) nah man I'm just joking around
Just hoping to soundcheck without choking this clown
I'm just about over it now and I'm not hopeful
Can I get a test vocal from the pleb locals
This opals got rough edges and a hard centre
I'm doing it for the love music's my warm sweater
Kinda like a second placenta so when I enter
In performance endeavours there's Desmond Decker-like measure
And ever different, but listen, there is that divider
Drink up cos the other act will steal all ya rider

There is no rider my friend, so why we doing this then?
We all go broke by night end (broke as hell, it's not hard to tell)
There is no rider my friend, so why we doing this then?
We all go broke by night end (broke as hell, it's not hard to tell)

I was working as an MC the other night
With a couple shitty mics and an appetite
Cook MCs like, look it's a parasite
Eat em up but first wipe the dirt out of sight
I'm your superman's cryptonite talkback
Shock jock sponsorship, politicians dirty money
Heard you coming from a mile away you got the
Right-of-way yeah that's what all the rhymers say
I'm inclined to play cos in the end it's entertainment
Crafted and created, loungeroom and the basement
Break-in, and of the things stolen by the sly crooks
Cash, backpack, laptop and rhymebook
Start from scratch, and scrap the last seventy-ish
Pull out every second hair and tear em to bits
Material things are gone with the pied piper
(Okay Winona, I'll do it for the Ryder)

There is no rider my friend, so why we doing this then?
We all go broke by night end (broke as hell, it's not hard to tell)
There is no rider my friend, so why we doing this then?

Come Around,Distant Sense of Random Menace,2004,"Now don't ever come around unannounced
Nor if you announce there's one too many run of outs
One too many counts far too many dumb it down
I came here to do my job, not to hear your run-around
I do okay believe me man I ain't come to pounce
I haven't come to scrounge I haven't come to cut you down
I don't want no gown, I'm not trying to hunt your crown
No twenty-one gun salute flags or trumpet sounds
I'm just running now, and yeah it's summer now
It's warmer in the water yet I sorta wonder how
How it's cold now, I see your thunder clouds
But you should keep it in a teacup and just shut your mouth
Simply cut it out your one number I'm rubbing out
Not number one or even 101 still you strut about
From middle to the mainstream and the underground
Your not in this struggle so don't you ever come around
""Get out of my sphere""

Yeah I'm warm but that's volcano ash
Followed by scolding golden molten lava trapped
It's no, party track it's a, heart attack
It's a master's tact with scars to match
It's a card saying don't come back I'm part of that
It's upside your neck til you start to scratch
But I'll stand my ground put on a harder hat
It's impossible to get here if you can't adapt
To the karma-strapped, to the ignorant and out-spoken
Talkback radio always with their mouths open
Big money brokers dressed all sugar coated
All the way to presidents who never should've got voted
In, treacherous seas we all sail hoping
Tomorrow's calm but I can't cos your arms choking
This little neck of mine, but don't look for tears
Just simply don't attempt to ever come around here

There's a million other places underneath the stars
It's an extra large planet filled with people and cars
But I'll tell you this again if it's not quite clear
That I don't want you coming round here
There's a million places underneath the stars to see
It's an extra large planet filled with Adam and Eve
But I'll tell you this again if it's not clear
""Get out of my sphere""

I don't want your money nor your pre-emptive wars
Or your small talk hawks or your live cause
You can keep your Porsche mansions and tennis courts
Interact with power tripping like it's intercourse
Let me have my book, let there be a pen with ink and
Silence in a busy day to have a little time to think
Let a little peace prosper in the middle east
Without politicians boiling up the bitter heat
Drop a feast at famines feet do you follow me?
There's so much more to life than fueling the economy
Give apologies acknowledge we're on stolen land
Say the obvious it's conscience, not the dollars man
I'm just a common man, I like the simple life
Thankful for my luck is how I'm livin' right
I thought I made it clear, do you understand dear?
Don't ever think of coming back around here!

Keep It Relevant,Distant Sense of Random Menace,2004,"I never ever entered any beauty contest
And I never gave a shit about a supermodel search
And this verse first busted on my twenty-third birthday
Earned some cash for rent, now it's rehashed and bent
Spent like government cents, in the the bank
Out the bank like the  tell us their thanks
 crank it up like the PA at a death metal gig
This is no lecture or a lesson, I'm just 
You wanna show the world your flow bro 
I listened to your whole album and it wasn't that great
Haven't dug into crates as much as searching my mind
You're looking for the perfect beat, I'm looking for the perfect rhyme
 patient, practice takes exercise
It's like tryna look at someone with the sun in your eyes
I never compromise integrity, I'm not a sellout
My perspective is  no penthouse
So get the hell out like a rabbit at the races
These greyhounds in suits got murder written all over their faces
Stressed out like paces, place your fake 
Create an image from the simplest speech, it takes weeks
I beat the drum like single mum: till exhausted
Devoted to what's important, what's my calling
So caution, I'm forced in and trampling like elephants
You wanna contribute son? Then keep it relevant

You're gonna use your effort and your time, use your wretched little mind
Don't forget your spine and get the rhythm relevant
You wanna rock the spot and give the people what they want
But who cares what you give 'em 'less you get the rhythm relevant
You're gonna use your effort and your time, use your wretched little mind
Don't forget your spine and get the rhythm relevant
You wanna rock the spot and give the people what they want
But who cares what you give 'em 'less you get the rhythm relevant


This is for the people and only for the people to consume
It' a method of relaxing, spark 'em up and write tunes
It's just a little thing we developed in our rooms
Voice, pen, pad and computer, tools of a user
Machinery accompanies the raucous 
And vocal rhymes, a pleasing little fiery collision, isn't
It 'I wanna rip the mic up to bits
I wanna dance like a breaker with wings on  hips
Surely we don't need another half-arsed braindead
Well-dressed breastfed volume annoying emcee
On this stage talking Benzies, cash flows and cars
In a whack induced frenzy,  your own stars
Please man don't even tempt me, you cut yourself in half
With your empty bag of battle raps that's tearing us apart
Not looking for the last laugh nor the past etiquette
I'm just here to contribute and keep it relevant

You're gonna use your effort and your time, use your wretched little mind
Don't forget your spine and get the rhythm relevant
You wanna rock the spot and give the people what they want
But who cares what you give 'em 'less you get the rhythm relevant
You're gonna use your effort and your time, use your wretched little mind
Don't forget your spine and get the rhythm relevant
You wanna rock the spot and give the people what they want
But who cares what you give 'em 'less you get the rhythm relevant

This is for the losers and the bruisers who just 
 skills built from useless, now take 'em in
Improvised on the fly, no, there's no instructions to read
 be in doubt, plus no 
Another day, December 31, the time has been felt
Another year has pasted him,  ring of a bell
Am I that much older or that much an 
I'm at clubs or , bum-rushing for a verse, I'm not a rambler
Microphone fiend shit chatterer
Not a pro nor an amateur, I'm not a barrister
More like Ozi Batla, live and full frontal
Got the flows mixed with substance to confront you
We run through like streakers, freak the whole show
Not a game ladies and gents, it's all about the pros
That's in poetry sense, plus some samplers computers
Here to alienate the damn pop consumers
Lessons but no tuners, all day with the Biro
With or without hyrdo, filling out the rhyme book
Just wait for the side look, I'm runnin' at you like an elephant
If you wanna contribute then make it relevant",https://genius.com/Urthboy-keep-it-relevant-lyrics
Natural Progression,Distant Sense of Random Menace,2004,"Who'd have ever known it'd come to this trying to
Predict your future sitch is simple as peace is a flick of a switch
Hitter. No prizes for not guessing that there'll be some days
Where I get most of my protein from this paper that I write on
This same little 
Timmy
 was a sporty kid, and yeah the sun
Worked its fryer on my pail skin funny thing frailty
I kept attending practice when my dad was having episodes
That left behind a family in tatters
And the subsequent descent under the poverty line
Still we had a roof above our heads and friends to grow and build with
And who'd have known of who I'd be if I had different early cards
But whose to ask what might've been I exercise my right to turn a
Blind eye to the rear vision, at which point the third eye'll hopefully
Kick in and then make a mark or something maybe
We can all look forward to some added time to sleep in
And do some home improvements on the weekend out in Eden
Or, if it's okay, don't ask me any questions
Just let the pen make a natural progression
If it's okay don't ask me any questions
Just let the pen make a natural progression

I'd have never even tried to guess from three to thirteen
To eighteen what's now got me on full court press yes
In retrospect the hints were there, timid as a billboard
A 
batsman, keeper
, graffiti writing creature
Sort of wrote a bit, it's now embarrassing but there's love
For those nursery rhyme raps in primary school Nug
They were bugged out but as if we weren't I copped
A tonne of verbal abuse but I'd say thankyou sir
I never came to cause trouble, we even wrote a rap
As peace offerings to Mr Beaumont when he had a baby
That was at 11, at 15 you could've seen them early morning
Petty crime schemes I've got a pin inside my foot to prove it
You'd be stupid to assume that there were no regrets
But it's not over yet, I wind my window down a bit
Shifting gears from fourth to fifth
Left the career back at the tollway
Generation cynic Y2K without the rollplay
 {x3}
Stranger things have happened, and it's not shock horror
And if you were to buy the bio then I wouldn't bother
It's just the way it is, call it my live review
Yeah I remember all these things while I'm hyping you

I had a fella tell me once of all his ideologies
You know the kind of scholarly filled chemical philosophies
Significance of numbers and your stars and your bloodlines
Scars from the sunshine tragedies and punchlines
Premature deaths occur before the person's ready
Said the fella before gently falling down and passing out
Well there you go the emporer proudly put out all he had on show
And here's a million bucks for guessing what tomorrow holds
Bank vaults and catapaults a liberal dose of smelling salts
To snap you back to Urth and yeah I've got present tense on lock
Known to deviate a little I guess, solving the how'd I get here
Riddle and yes, there's still a bit on my chest
Was it the year I was completely depressed 
I swore I'd
Never take for granted when the skin disease left
. And still don't
Still evokes potently as turning points tend to do
And sometimes I reflect on this while I'm hyping you
 {x3]
Stranger things have happened, and it's not shock horror
And if you were to buy the bio then I wouldn't bother

Distant Sense of Random Menace,Distant Sense of Random Menace,2004,"Maybe it's too complicated, maybe it's a minefield
Maybe it's like someone else's murder, it's not quite real
Buried page 10 of today's paper
Read about another road rage of a crazed teenager
The mother gives the vox grab saying she's just
Sad, and all the justice in the world won't bring her daughter back
Flavour of the 48 hours til the news finds another
Utter tragedy to increase the views
And you still never know if you've reached the truth
30 seconds to a minute and you're in it up to the tips of your toes
And the truth can be a dodgy uncle
Media moguls and leaders act like Simon & Garfunkle
The, right wing squarks for yet more hawks
And the, left wing calls for yet more peace talks
And many people left are asking who to believe
Cos reality is as muddy as token olive leaves
And apparently you can't wear your heart on your sleeve
Cos the menace is too distant for listeners to grieve
And even umm, I've been numbed til the cartoon alternative
Just trying to learn to live

Kigali
It's just a distant sense of random menace
Chechnya
It's just a distant sense of random menace
Lebanon
It's just a distant sense of random menace
Woomera
It's just a distant sense of random menace

Try as I might I cannot get my head around the
Hutus slaughtering the Tutsis in Rwanda one-nine-nine-four
And then on top to comprehend how the United Nations
Let it happen with their blue helmets armed by the door
Eight hundred thousand in less than
Ninety days, is Africa just too far away
Or is the genocide convention only mentioned in connection
With the Nazis and the Jews during World War Two
Cos your world views seen through the same few that drew
Their bloody colonial maps for custodial taxes
Historical pacts, treaties and age-old arrangements ignore
In order for the dominant order to be restored
Warlords, dictators, puppet regimes installed
While cold wars and old walls did fall
Wars on drugs and wars on terror
Later on there'll be concessions made by governments of intelligence errors
Is to understand to simplify? Black and white, good
And bad, learn not to sympathise unless it's of an allied flag
I'll be damned if my land is the fifty-first state
Both a realist and idealist on the same day

Vietnam
It's just a distant sense of random menace
Sierra Leone
It's just a distant sense of random menace
Zimbabwe
It's just a distant sense of random menace
Bosnia
It's just a distant sense of random menace

It's not a soapbox, or at least I hope not
These are things that affect me so much they're what I dream of
Dream of different endings where lessons are learnt
Before good and bad were copyright foreign policy terms
Before hip hop was either barbeque or bling
Before it seemed like everyone was operated by string
So align yourself, define yourself, design yourself
With any luck your life will all work out
And you won't find yourself the victim of an effort to ethnically cleanse
Left to defend the rest of these men
Women and children, from rape, pillage and killing cos
Every evil got it's coalition of the goddamn willing
So forgive me if I can't give you something to laugh to
This is for you to argue, shake your mind and arse to
It's for me to ask you just who can you trust
Dust to dust, and if tomorrow is us? What if...

Whose Morals,Distant Sense of Random Menace,2004,"At full volume, you let all know you know whats going on
What's right to one to others is wrong
You can force feed it, 'til we passively receive it
Is one opinion better than none if you don't need it?
Minds become uniform in groups
And there's nothing quite as flexible as truth
And that's true
Commodities like truth have got any definition
And money changes hands in secure payments
Pick your favourite, and proudly propagandise
Make sure to run forth and hype it like it'll save our lives
And fight the other side like you were paid to lie
Smile for the camera and say that they provoked attack
Keep it like a boy's club you're free with G.W.B
But you can't chose your sisters, and brothers, and others
With chins high as midsummer
Talking loud throughout a dead rubber
You need your meaning of live more than i need yours
I've got one that functions ok though, scattered as it is
Home is where the attic is
And the heart is where panic lives
What matters is not outstretched hands from false prophets
Trying in vain to catch the substance like a comet
There's just to much that they could never understand
And with such great plans we're all confused as ever

What do you expect of us?
If you want our trust
Then try you must
To reach with an honest hand
What do you expect of us?
If you want our trust
Then try you must
To speak like an honest man

I'm not asking for a moral, a patriotic motto
A try-your-luck emotion angle lotto
I'm quite happy without influence
And my intuition stays tight with trust
So you can imagine I could never accept your truth
Version or moral view or what you expect of the youth
What you expect of the peace-brining troops or minority groups
What you expect of the feds when your storing up nukes
How to respect someone who's ignoring you
And contradicting all with doctrinated values
And malnutrition, ethical foundations
Of which you take aim from
Means I'll never wait on your every word
Is that more misinformation I heard?
Or a policy i heard to actually serve people over profits
How can I follow in footsteps of those in office
When every speech is just another empty promise?
How can I follow in footsteps of those in office
When every speech is just another empty promise?",https://genius.com/Urthboy-whose-morals-lyrics
Long Walk Home,Distant Sense of Random Menace,2004,"If you look just through the mist in front it’s there it’s small but you can just see it
See what
You can just see it through there just look a bit more carefully
Yeah but there's like nothing there
And that’s cause your looking out my window look out your own window man
Float back

It’s gonna be a long walk home
And I’m just a stone’s throw from a telephone tone
You can tell from the groan it’s engaged, throw the phone
In a rage, rip the yellow paper page like a poem
Watch me show’ em say the lips to the mountains wide hips
Smiling like a crisis before applying like this
Keep calm let the mist take you by its blind vision
Walk slowly don’t bother with the offers to be driven
There ain’t nothing like living, stay cunning fight systems
Keep running right writtens, speak something like missions
Don't sleep but if you do then dream freaky bright thrills
Steal souls like television, listen if you will
Fill her up drill it out spill your beans like a journal
Still the scenes never certain with my verbal in reversal
Get immersed in your words, create verse and wake up
A long walk a short day and no place to stay stuck
With the mind not fully made up, but up and going
In a time when a rookie gets cut for not glowing
Open trips throwing ship it’s whatever way possible
It's gonna be a long walk home but not optional


Its gonna be a long walk back
I never asked for directions now I’m guessing which track
There many and the maps like a riddle with a trap
I collapse in the quicksand its gripping like sap
Isolated and exhilarated biting off a chunk of a cloud
Throw the scrapes to the crowds open mouths
As it drops hear ‘em shout, watch the doubt fade away
While all pals find the minutes in the day to conversate
As opposed to conglomerate, we operated our intellectual property
And act beyond rhetorical philosophy
Another moon another odyssey with clipped wing
An anomaly on instinct hanging on to thin string
Laughing at your lip sync sinking for success
It’s a long road I think you need a rest, catch a breath
Yells the city to the soul but deaf ears were to cold
So fresh beers were sold cheap to the questions unsolved
And the page folds easily, the hero failed dismally
The crowd applaud decently, and they hear of no conspiracy
The advice is too rich for me, delivered by clones
I reject it and keep going on the long road home


There ain’t nothing like living
Speak something like missions",https://genius.com/Urthboy-long-walk-home-lyrics
Urthboy: Rapper Tag #2,Rapper Tag Australia,2010,"Ayo, thanks for the tag Six
And thanks to the neighbours for the bandwidth
MCs in the cypher I stand with
No stage, no records, just damage
Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout lounge rooms
Outside gigs, no soundproof
For real that's the ground crew
No one buyin' these days so fuck it if that ain't value
To me, the cyph' is a ripped couch
Longneck mob, bowl and a big mouth
Lot of dog rappers that you never hear about
We talk shit then  we kicked out
What we do to get a rep?

Stories,Smokey’s Haunt,2012,"When I get to you, no I won't forget
What it took and takes, by the book and breaks
By the crate and limb, by the state I'm in
By the skin of my teeth took it on the chin
I was up for it, ""yep"" more than ""no""
I was down for the cause and you ought to know
Spent all day on it at work and then brought it home
Something like an addiction, never fought it though
Got a debt to the stars, debt to the gutter
A debt to the bars, debt for the wisdom
That I will discard, you can bet I'll do it
In the future as I have in the past
All of it has scarred me but I'm still here
Through the imperfections that interfered
Feeling like a thief, stole a whole career
Wanna know? Let me lend your ear

I had to
Go about it, ride it out and
Find it myself, and there's some
Stories I can tell you
I had to
Fail, had to fall just for
What I did well, and there's some
Stories I can tell you

Don't get it twisted though
I don't wanna blink and then miss its glow
Get choked and saved by the same rope
By the time you hear this you already know
Dear future me, nothing you can do for me
Sorry you are not what you used to be
Whatever you've got is news to me
What I handed you wasn't handled beautifully but it's done
Tainted blood cells and bad ankles
I did damage that was substantial
The body's a temple but I am a vandal
That could not live life at a standstill
I'm unapologetic of my path
But by the time you're me it's all of your past
Hope you remember this when you're falling apart
If not I wrote down a few remarks

I had to
Go about it, ride it out and
Find it myself, and there's some
Stories I can tell you
I had to
Fail, had to fall just for
What I did well, and there's some
Stories I can tell you

You've got to go about it
You're going to ride it out
You're going to know about it
You're going to let it out
You've got to go about it
You're going to ride it out
You're going to know about it
You're going to let it out

Bet it all on the vocal chords
Reassure the in-laws, dear lord
You're girl's in safe hands we're making great plans
That we will make sense one day
Maybe when I'm grey, if this can pay into old age?
Someone get that granddad down off stage
Hey kids, your gramps never drank kool-aid
In his own time did it with a few failed greats
But what? Worse the story, better the redemption
Worse the quandary, better the retention
I ain't breezing and I ain't George Benson
I ain't protected brother I ain't fenced in
If my future questions my current senses
That'd be the same we've been doing for centuries
So sorry if I ran it to empty
I wrote this so you know what I meant here

I had to
Go about it, ride it out and
Find it myself, and there's some
Stories I can tell you (yeah)
I had to
Fail, had to fall just for
What I did well, and there's some
Stories I can tell you
(Some stories I can tell you) I had to
Go about it, ride it out and
Find it myself, and there's some
Stories I can tell you
(Some stories I can tell you) I had to
Fail, had to fall just for
What I did well, and there's some
Stories I can tell you
(Listen up, listen up)

You've got to go about it
You're going to ride it out
You're going to know about it
You're going to let it out",https://genius.com/Urthboy-stories-lyrics
Knee Length Socks,Smokey’s Haunt,2012,"Rushing out of Kings Cross Station spill into the
Glow of Darlinghurst Road underneath the 
Coke
 sign
Hidden in the hip folk, bright red and white
Lights and the bouncers inviting me to strip shows
I was seventeen with a face of fifteen
Carried my skateboard with me through the slipstream
You could be the king of the Cross or just sightseeing
Or take flight from the limelight like me
My brother ran a nightclub playing Britpop
In a club called Les Girls
Once upon a time it was owned by 
Abe Saffron
Long way from Oasis to the underworld
He would sneak me in before 10 when the doors opened
And the dancefloor dark and scarce
And the bartender knew I wasn't legal
Both of us pretended that the other wasn't there
I was about to learn

There girls in knee length socks
Did not dance like I did, I
Did not dance Indie kid, they
Did not dance like me
In Fred Perry shirts, these guys
Did not dance like I did, I
Did not dance Britpop kid, they
Did not dance like me
So whatcha whatcha want?

By 12 with the party proper kicking
Room full of Albarns, Cockers and Frischmanns
A couple Ian Browns and they're dancing to The Smiths
And there I am in the middle of the dancefloor pissed
I was showing of my Running Man, shake it like Q-Tip
Bonita Applebum clip like I was on some new shit
Proper etiquette: hide it, shield it
But Screamadelica had Don't Fight It, Feel It
Indie girls danced like perky little penguins
There She Goes I fell in love but afraid to befriend 'em
I wish I could've told her that I loved Suede
Or the way she swung her hands by her sides like rotorblades
Could've put a British accent on
Pashed her in the chorus of a catchy song (yep)
With the charm of a trashy Pom like
""'allo love, wanna snog?""

There girls in knee length socks
Did not dance like I did, I
Did not dance Indie kid, they
Did not dance like me
In Fred Perry shirts, these guys
Did not dance like I did, I
Did not dance Britpop kid, they
Did not dance like me
So whatcha whatcha want?

Grabbed my skateboard from the cloakroom
Found Kings Cross with her legs wide open
What kind of trouble could a kid get his nose in
When the best of the seediest part of Sydney blows in?
I was never caught by the fuzz while I was still on the buzz
A bit before I dabbled with drugs
Pills, Thrills, Bellyaches, E's and Whiz
Whatever it takes to medicate please a swig
I did a bit I admit I was not innocent
I didn't fit in but I felt magnificent
Banging through my eardrums differently
Like I got a new set of antennas for them bitches to listen with
I look back realise what it meant to me
Why I wrote hooks and melodies
I'm part of their legacy
But I never did get her next to me
I guess that was for the best Goddamn

There girls in knee length socks
Did not dance like I did, I
Did not dance Indie kid, they
Did not dance like me
In Fred Perry shirts, these guys
Did not dance like I did, I
Did not dance Britpop kid, they
Did not dance like me

The Big Sleep,Smokey’s Haunt,2012,"The passage of a thousand sunrises came and went with calm resolve
And like clockwork they shone on
The one that we’d forgot
Her truth entrenched by eight decades in a white flag of bitter wisdom
Leavin' her front door with no more than the odd cursory knock
A classic two story terrace
On a central sloping street
Affluent couples would cast their eyes as they looked to buy in Sydney's east
Three-quarter eight-hundred at least
But this lady wasn't selling in fact
No one ever saw her
But that's the city for ya
She was there with a low profile
Never made a sound it ain’t her style
At her age didn’t want no one to rile up till she invited nobody else to her island
When the sirens drowned out the silence quietly her pension cheques kept arriving
They cut her telephone line she wasn't dialing
Killed the electricity the damn wiring
Operator said they could not get through on the phone
For all they care there ain’t nobody at home
Little do they know that she on her own
Disconnection notes come and they come and they go
And the junk mail collected in the letter box
Constant papers stuck together squashed
The neighbors wonder why it never stops
Cause she never answered if they ever knocked
Oh my love
You’ve been sleeping so long
In a world where you don’t belong
Its time to get you back home
Where the sun meets the sky you’ll be resting tonight
Gotta let it go
Gotta let it get away back home
Gotta let it go
Gotta let it go
Gotta let it get away back home
And as real as she was maybe she was just somebody I dreamt
Like her presence was passing the brim
Of all the people that she had never met
Wondered if it could’ve happened, could it happen again
The passage of a thousand sunsets had walked her to the end
Her signal lost strength and she fell right out of range
The truth sealed in eight decades when she closed her door on the world
And all that lonely sorrow set free and washed away
And that terrace on the sloping street did not change
Real estate agents still cast their eyes as they drove past in cars they leased
Three-quarter eight-hundred at least and they say
Did ya hear the story
Apparently the neighbors they never saw her, but that’s the city for ya",https://genius.com/Urthboy-the-big-sleep-lyrics
On Your Shoulders,Smokey’s Haunt,2012,"I see em talking like I talk it
I can walk it if you cautious at times
Fumbling words at verses I'm perfect
Yet to define or explain
It's kinda hard rather simple and plain
We maintain by ourselves do-gooders seek the change
Go about it the wrong way like
It's been a long day
We all in this struggle together
These are the breaks that we face
We can change but ourselves then others as well
Lead the example then follow they shall
So young Padawan, word, get ya battle on
Respect is a two way street, remember what up
Knowledge is the key to the treasure we possess, hold ya head
We in it for the long haul respect, uh huh
My mother said ""think before you says"", word 'em up
My unc said ""look before you step"", so uh
I let the music speak for itself
One love to each their own and everybody else

You can carry it all on your shoulders
Like you're the only one to resolve it
Let's just try to be, to be
What's your motivation?
Is it yourself or the change you're making?
Let's just try to be, to be, to be

Believe they hype
Moving faster than the speed of light
Each day it's getting harder to get to sleep at night
Still it's funny
Trying to appease the guilt and worry
That comes with sunny living in the land of milk and honey
As fate would have it, we inhabit an era where
Activism's considered sharing a facebook status
Cover the night and make Kony famous
Simplistic ideas and benevolent strangers
(So what you're saying is)
Who gave you the authority?
Put you in a position of superiority?
You got to ask yourself, what's the priority?
The change you wanna see or who you want to be seen to be?
Straining under the weight of a heavy conscience
But people got to solve their own problems man
Won't ever accept what's forced on em
Best we can do is lend a helping hand


Cos you've seen first hand what people can do
How it defies the beliefs that's feeding you view
It's like you didn't know the devil was sleeping with you
And sleeping with me too it's gotta be better anew
Afresh, and we ain't set up a a colony yet
On Jupiter and Mars batten down the hatches
And bars we get
A little protective of our patch of turf and yet
Apparent we're not apparent of it
Or more clever than it
Come here we'll tear you to bits
How many lessons can you fit in a classroom of kids?
How many billions could you reach that you care to convince?
And those you hold dear, are they there in your midst?
Do they know you battle with pen or the fist?
Trying to make everything right
Trying to make everything fix
As if everything you consider wrong wasn't meant to exist
But to somebody then that'd be this",https://genius.com/Urthboy-on-your-shoulders-lyrics
Naïve Bravado,Smokey’s Haunt,2012,"Naive Bravado
Yo, yo, check it

Now if I were you, wouldn't be listening to me
I would trust about as far as the eyes can see
A heart that's bleeding from the dream you're leaving
Through debris you're breathing you can smell defeat
What you're receiving is for far beyond reason
Where you grieve every evening every day of the week
Ducking and weaving and you're stuck in the deep end
Nothing of it is even nowhere to put up your feet
All of it beating a drum eating away at the one
Doubting the ray of the sun inevitably
Can't carry it weighing a tonne every day in a month
Hoping you day it'd come, never to be
They wash their hands of you and nobody notices you it's like
They abandoned you as if you were cheap
They don't know how far you've come just to compete
The cards you've been dealt were there to be beat

Come with me get hypnotised
Free you from your troubled mind
Naïve bravado, get you naïve bravado
Come with me get hypnotised
Wake up, and realise
Naïve bravado, get your naïve bravado

Fuck the world is part of your armour, part of your honour
Part of your karma like you're ready to die
Christopher Wallace you give it your hardest
Swim with piranhas, guilty of charges no one letting em fly
Come as you are you're singing Nirvana, a Donnie Darko
Digging in darker but it's sucking you dry
Fight for your mind it's something like Harper
For starters you are smarter than the credit you garner but why?
They wash their hands of you as if you don't matter enough
Like they can abandon you as if they were blind
You ain't come this far to end up standing aside
The limits imposed are there to defy
Until, you're neck deep in the breaks
And it gets real, non-believers kneel and pray
And when all your dreams drift and slip away
And you're pushed to the brink about to break
Until, you're neck deep in the breaks
And it gets real, non-believers kneel and pray
And when all your dreams drift and slip away
And you're pushed to the brink about to break

Come with me get hypnotised
Free you from your troubled mind
Naïve bravado, get you naïve bravado
Come with me get hypnotised
Wake up, and realise
Naïve bravado, get your naïve bravado

Let it be known, you're never alone
Come with me, c'mon tell me are you with me
We've come too far to be conned
I'm a tell you straight you're strong
Come with me, c'mon tell me are you with me

Come with me get hypnotised
Free you from your troubled mind
Naïve bravado, get you naïve bravado
Come with me get hypnotised
Wake up, and realise
Naïve bravado, get your naïve bravado",https://genius.com/Urthboy-naive-bravado-lyrics
Empire Tags,Smokey’s Haunt,2012,"How long will it take?
How long do we wait?

Tell me once again Cook fount it
A ghost town they claimed for England
Sunburnt realm of a distant kingdom
Untold riches, that is what it would bring them
Guided by the righteous whiteness within them
Terra nullius land that belonged to no one
Some black fellas here, they got no guns
And we'll quell rebellion but that ain't no rum
She's got red dirt, she's got blue gums
She knows drought well, yeah she'll bring you some
She'll swallow you up like Burke and Wills son
And this ain't London, but we'll try build one
Though it's uphill, and done by spilt blood
We did not know the land or climate
The eyes that we farmed with for years were blinded
But there's no going back, that's why we signed up
We made our mind up, you let me say

Mark my words, we in a gold rush
Youth can't hide the fact we getting older
A little outpost that boxed above weight
In the process became great
Mark my words, we in a gold rush
Youth can't hide the fact we getting older
And all of this could be what we imagine
And that could be the national anthem

How long will it take? (How long will it take?)
When we gonna get our new flag
How long do we wait? (How long do we wait?)
When we gonna get our new flag
How long will it take? (How long will it take?)
When we gonna get our new flag
Come on, tell me

She knows bushrangers, she's got bankers
Captain Thunderbolt to Rodney Adler
Too many crook cops and she watched gangsters
Couldn't save Doomagee but she knew the answer
She's seen Razor gangs, Armed resistance
Stolen Generations put away to the Missions
Sunburnt realm of a distant kingdom
A colonial imprint on an ancient wisdom
How we found victories in the battles we lost
From an unmarked grave a Victoria Cross
And democracy born in a Eureka plot
Now she's loyal to an alliance and eyeing them off
Gallipoli and the Somme, Vietnam and beyond
She's so far from the frontline but part of the song
Hit and miss little myths that are part of the bond
Lond trumpet at an Anzac dawn so

Mark my words, we in a gold rush
Youth can't hide the fact we getting older
A little outpost that boxed above weight
In the process became great
Mark my words, we in a gold rush
Youth can't hide the fact we getting older
And all of this could be what we imagine
And that could be the national anthem
Come on now

How long will it take? (How long will it take?)
When we gonna get our new flag
How long do we wait? (How long do we wait?)
When we gonna get our new flag
How long will it take? (How long will it take?)
When we gonna get our new flag
So come on tell me
Come on, tell me

Now once upon a time it's who we were
Once upon a time we clung to her
Once upon a time but no longer
One corner of our flag is insecure
From a time when the empire tagged the globe
We ain't cleaned that graffiti off the front of out home
What I'm telling you we already know
That it's time, time for the Jack to go

How long will it take? (How long will it take?)
When we gonna get our new flag
How long do we wait? (How long do we wait?)
When we gonna get our new flag
How long will it take? (How long will it take?)

Calling Cards,Smokey’s Haunt,2012,"I never could walk that mile in your shoe
Guess it wasn't my size
But I followed in footsteps guided by you
When you took me aside
Caught a glance of something that reminded me of you
Thought I saw your smile
It sent me and my mind right back to you
Like a prodigal child
And the memory flooded back that bag unpacked
What I'd left untapped, and we lost track that way
What I'd left for a latter date
Should've checked your caper though
Instead of waiting for you to phone
But as usual it gets postponed
If only we could've both known
Of course I should've called
Right now that's a bitter thought
The thing you think after your wall collapses
And your world comes off it's axis
Why we lost touch I don't know
I don't think we were right or wrong
Either way stuff was going on
Wide awake we grew apart
Hard to think about you in the past
You went and passed
And I can't get past it
Wish we had one more handshake
I can still hear your laughter
I hope you can hear this
From where ever you are now

Just checking in
Hope you can hear
Want you to know that
We'll meet again, we'll meet again
So now I say
Goodbye, my friend
Want you to know that
It's not the end, it's not the end

I wish I could've closed that door too
And made my peace with you
Sails that adorned our masts
Once were our calling cards
Unrecognized as it passed though
Let that regret go that you bear
We're guilty as each other there
One day we'll meet up in the air
Let that regret go that you bear
We're guilty as each other there
One day we'll meet up in the air


Make sure you say goodbye before you go
What I never said
I wish I'd told you so
Waiting for the right moment
Time froze
Just make sure you say goodbye before you go",https://genius.com/Urthboy-calling-cards-lyrics
Glimpses,Smokey’s Haunt,2012,"My mum asked me did she do a good job
Did she bring us up right, within a rough ride?
For real ma, I swear there ain't nothing that I'd swap there
So you should feel pride is how I replied
My blood made brighter by your sunlight
You told me fireworks form with words, when you run riot
The way they races you head when they're untied
You let me know they'll run dry but they'll fly again
The colour of our eyes different the tears the same
But I've got your smile when I hear your name
If I'm to inherit your deaf and blindness
Let me get the hope and the kindness
I'm cut from the cloth of the finest
From the same stock as your highness
No one deny me of this so please
Don't ask me how you could've done a better job
Cos there ain't nothing I can think of

I saw myself in the mirror
Got a glimpse of my dad
I did a double take
Realised what I had
I'll found my own way
I've got to but I'll always come back
To be honest it scares me
Thinking about that

Memories sting and sooth me
My blue eyes the way I adjust my shoulders
For a moment she's still here with me
The pain erased and the weight released
I join the dots to make a picture
So many gaps where fables are builders
It gets me closer to who she was
What she gave me, what I lost
She gave me compassion
See and trust what I imagine
So I stand where she stood
Share the footsteps that she took
With my feet in her shoes
I do what I do for two
I transcribe our truth
Hope one day I'll pass it on too

I saw myself in the mirror
Got a glimpse of my dad
I did a double take
Realised what I had
I'll go my own way
I've got to but I'll always come back
To be honest it scares me
Thinking about that
Yeah, thinking about that

I got this from my old man
He used to sing and jam with my Sis on the keys
That self-belied, my mum's side of the family tree
I owe it to my grandmother for that will to achieve
And all the dreams that I perceive because I put in time now
On the principals and morals what I base my life around
It's the foundation: Larrakia, Dutch, Yanuwa
Can't forget Philo blood Spanish cuz, what up brah?
Talking all corners of the globe just to get where I'm from
And yet I still call this home
Like the coast when I see it after forty thou years
So precious I'm connected through the ghosts of my peers
Ancestors, bless us with an angelic presence
I can feel it in my vein now the strength that I treasure
Re-up for the blessing as now
I can look at my hands and see a life-long investment
Questions

I saw myself in the mirror
Got a glimpse of my dad
I did a double take
Realised what I had
I'll found my own way
I've got to but I'll always come back
To be honest it scares me
Thinking about that
Yeah, thinking about that
Thinking about that

Clean Slate,Smokey’s Haunt,2012,"Looking at a black page, with lines on 'em
Script unwritten of fortune, ironed on 'em
As if a fresh set of lives we designed on 'em
Where my hopes jockey for space, they ride on 'em
How many times has the ink gotta cover it
Before I'm satisfied by what I come up with
You don't need me to feed you the cookie cutter shit
Just a heart that's bleeding when you discover it
Friend and a foe, pen and a page
Ay yo a piece of paper can never be set in its ways
But until I bring it to life it's end of my days
I'm making my bed a maze in my head
It's why I don't rap about wealth
You could want it so much that your brain melts
A corporate conveyor belt? That ain't me nor Delts
I only ever wrote music that was true to myself

Every slate is clean to me
Cos I'll be rhyming and shining frequently
And from what I know now what would I change
Unputdownable, every turned page is a clean slate
Every slate is clean to me
Cos I'll be rhyming and shining frequently
And from what I know now what would I change
Unputdownable, every turned page is a clean slate

(Transmitting live from Smokey's Haunt)
Each day when I wake I'm living out my fate
Diggin' a nice crate, writtens that I state
And delivered to the plate, turned gentleman primates
Why hate Benjamin for hitting the prime slate
High grade numbers invade, made the verse toy
Not arrogant we stay down to Urthboy
Mainstream is a mess, leaving a dirt void
The Herd murder joints with reverb noise
The suburbs poised the blow, don't call triple 0
Wrote a message in the smoke saying ""bro let it go""
Till nuclear winter snow snap froze the globe
My rap chose the road less travelled for dough
Immaculate road, mansion home matching the green
Same eggplant y'all different aubergine
You jealousy fiends, my team all hate the scene
So we do our own thing, wipe the slate clean

Every slate is clean to me
Cos I'll be rhyming and shining frequently
And from what I know now what would I change
Unputdownable, every turned page is a clean slate
Every slate is clean to me
Cos I'll be rhyming and shining frequently
And from what I know now what would I change
Unputdownable, every turned page is a clean slate

Through binoculars his eyes looked timid (yikes)
Focused out beyond city limits
He was told the other side it lies infinite
Not a second to lose, cos no one gains a minute
Every point in the path is there to pivot
Every cast got a character that think they got it figured
Lost souls at the crossroads being delivered
Oasis in the palm of your hands the sand shifted
Heat haze tricks on the brain remain lifted
Prepare yourself for the Alien visit
Watch how you take each step can slide different
Every rhyme that's written's a slate of white linen

Every slate is clean to me
Cos I'll be rhyming and shining frequently
And from what I know now what would I change
Unputdownable, every turned page is a clean slate
Every slate is clean to me
Cos I'll be rhyming and shining frequently
And from what I know now what would I change
Unputdownable, every turned page is a clean slate",https://genius.com/Urthboy-clean-slate-lyrics
Cleopatra,Smokey’s Haunt,2012,"Winning is so much fun she could be the
One with a lucky streak sign that broke the bleak
Layer of a surburban street, that leads to
Nowhere red roots, paint-stripped shop fronts
Like a commercial pock-marked
Reminding her of the past like ""x marks the spot"" once
People on their own trip, they got to
Get places, need-to-know basis keep a
Straight face  with car horns ring out
Someone stole with traffic lights sing out
She keep walking, purse by her side
She head into an oasis shuffling of the light like
Winning is so much fun she could be
One of the lucky people, one of the ones that won
She as good as they come and the luck will come good
Rose in the pavement long as she in a haven
Taking a view, she looking for something to savour
Even though the odds clearly must act in her favour
It's about time they kicked in and repaid her
Yep, that is what is gonna happen today, sir
She looking for pay dirt to boost her paid work
Navy blue slacks, tucked in beige shirt
Fella in a fluoro vest must be council
Bumped her on her way through, young scoundrel
Barely looked back, she raised her hand up
Sympathetic shrug from an old bystander
Collects herself and carries on to the club
Where the big glass doors at the front open up
Winning is so much fun and she on the cusp of it
Step on the carpet that bring out her rush in it
Banality reality and now she departed it
Casablanca Ilsa Lund and she got a part in it

Cleopatra, Indian dreaming
Gotta keep the heart of the golden goose beating
Lights are flashing, the machine is beaming
(It's a write your own race, the machines are beating)
Lake placid on acid, and the seas are heaving
Twisted symphony, keep believing
Last time a tenner flipped a thousand
How many tenners presented, but who's counting? (who's counting?)
Winning is so much fun, just one more
Let 'em run like the footsteps of a race horse
On the screen like a hypercolour musical score
Sign says it ain't a spectator sport
Bells ring, credit a bet win
Five kings, they zing past, they in sync (in sync)
So close, but don't land, but she don't blink
Hands back in her purse like she don't think

Push the button
Push the button
Push the button
One more, one more, press the button
One more, one more, got a combo
One more, one more, the machines think
One more, one more
One more, one more, one
One more, one
Back to the haunt

She listen to the wailing chorus
..that is all that is  on it (c'mon)
Now she reaching into her wallet (uh)
'Cos she know somewhere she got it (I got it)
They listen to the wailing chorus (sing it)
..that is all that is  on it (it's coming)
Now they reaching into their wallet (their wallet)
'Cos they know somewhere they got it (I got it)

Orphan Rocker,Smokey’s Haunt,2012,"See where I grew up we had a roller coaster
They- They called it the Orphan Rocker
Like officially called Orphan Rocker

The blue mountain blood,
That run under my city skin
Lost in tell-tale signs and fitting in
Where I’m from is a part of me and i ain't giving in
More than a recollection up in your memory bank
My background led me to lower the tempo (its true)
Like a wound bag brand new you're retro
Trikky got it slow as I like, and on that note
That’s why I like blues, reggae, rock, steady and folk
Somehow it made me feel like I’m at home like
The pace of the last style space in the road
Being on top of the mountain, the place of the know
Being on top of the world when you're basically broke.
Never set my mind to shoot for the stars,
Went through a phase of pool, jukeboxes and bars
Cheap wine and four litre cars
Go on a half-pipe passed, black flag, nah's
Bout the only time the beats got fast
I had my long hair black that was punk rock making a mark
Slow it down till you're makin' me laugh, but hey,
Don't slow it too fast you never know cause

We could fly with the jumping blocks,
Down here with the brakes off
Get enough speed
We can take off
We could abscond if we get a day job (lets go)
Cause we're crawling (we're crawling)
Then we're walking (we're walking)
Now we're running (we're running)
Running on, running on (woah-oh-oh)

Year 12 finished, man half of us failed
And it’s hard to keep on course when you're way off the rails
The pace that you pick up pales
In comparison the kids that learned quick with winning the sales
I had to balance the scales,
Always have always will at the end of the day it’s my holy grail
It’s my skill never passed the post first
That'd be unreal I will pass that post fulfilled (no doubt)
In Katoomba, yo they tried to make a roller coaster
A death trap for tourists, called the orphan rocker
Took a mannequin to the cliff and then up and over
Dunno what happened but I know it never opened
Hair raising just wasn't our style,
But we've sent a lot of dummies in the wild
Even though the strobes and the lights take a moment in my life
I’m coming back every once in a while


I was ready when the city called my name,
Looked back at the blue from where i came and
Flickering lights in Parramatta road lanes
We rub our hands together to feel the flame
I thought it wasn't mine, I phoned from an outside line
Outsider to a fault default to find, a feeling with fam
I found i can stand behind, some of our soul brighter than our soul is to shine
Took it for granted man, Took off and landed man
Never been the type to abandon it,
Got up and ran with it, two of the same with it,
An unforgettable bond with them that we banded with
Went to sleep just to dream... The audacity about with no self esteem
Once that was me and all of this unforseen, now i got an ego and i just keep it lean
With a whole lot of love for the mountains in my blood,
Little bit of Bradbury, Campbelltown what’s up?
Do it on my own terms till time is up, yo guts drop the drums let’s bring it back a touch, come on
Let’s do it
Let’s get up on this orphan rocker
Let’s see where it takes us
Let’s see if it’s for real
Let’s head up to the cliff and find out, come on

Springstein, Nebraska, slow down your speed.
Put some new Paul Kelly on they thought I was asleep
Drop down your anchor, turn up place some thieves
Now that nothing matters
Come drift down with me
Come drift down with me
Come drift down with me",https://genius.com/Urthboy-orphan-rocker-annotated

Hey Dianne
Don't you worry about a thing
There's asylum in the secrets
There's a freedom in the things that you keep for yourself

It starts off silently, and the tension is tightening
You swear that on your life you wouldn't lie to him
You wonder if the same rules apply to him
You fight with him, something isn't right with him
Nip it in the bud before it might begin
Like who is she and why is she alright with him?
And you ain't trying to hear him when he sighing
And he saying it's a minor thing, fidelity is everything
More than pride to him, so why the doubt sliding in?
They talk about it but, she don't know why she think
That she can confide in him, but only when the tide is in

Yeah, who is she and what she want?
She make him mad and you don't like the way she flaunt
You ask him why the hell you even need to talk
And why she flirting all up on your fucking wall?
Maybe yelling back that ""it ain't that at all""
And ""oh my god we talked about this shit before
What you bringing it up for?""
He says he don't know what he can do to ever make you sure
So he don't wanna talk no more
And she becoming overwrought
Maybe he'll leave her, she believing in the Murphy's Law
And end up hating herself because the heart is sore
And now they're going back and forth like a swinging door, like a swinging door

Hey Dianne
Don't you worry about your man
Hey Dianne
Don't you worry about a thing
There's asylum in the secrets
There's a freedom in the things that you keep for yourself
There's betrayal in the things that you keep for yourself

The years pass quickly (quickly)
And though it's unresolved, they had their victories (victories)
The niggling suspicions are so prickly (prickly)
And through it all they never really lifted
Now he's away and she go out and hit the town tipsy (tipsy)
Only for a drink so you would cap it off with Emily, Joanna and Christie (Christie)
And you at home is someone else's history, it's done
And he come home and ask, ""Did you miss me?
'Cos I missed you. I wish that you'd tell me why your eye is so misty
Darling, what the fuck have I missed here?""

Don't you worry about your man

Stories [Alternate Version],Smokey’s Homies Remix EP,2013,"You know when you were a kid and they said ""don't tell stories""
Yo Mantra
Yo Drapht
Let's tell some stories

When I get to you, no I won't forget
What it took and takes, by the book and breaks
By the crate and limb, by the state I'm in
By the skin of my teeth took it on the chin
I was up for it, ""yep"" more than ""no""
I was down for the cause and you ought to know
Spent all day on it at work and then brought it home
Something like an addiction, never fought it though
Got a debt to the stars, debt to the gutter
A debt to the bars, debt for the wisdom
That I will discard, you can bet I'll do it
In the future as I have in the past
All of it has scarred me but I'm still here
Through the imperfections that interfered
Feeling like a thief, stole a whole career
Wanna know? Let me lend your ear

I had to go about it, ride it out and find it myself
And there's some stories I can tell you
I had to fail, had to fall just for what I did well
And there's some stories I can tell you

Whether or not you went and got a better job, got fed up
Instead forget Mantra I'm better off being robbed
Went along with whatever the others want
I got a lot on my chest I gotta get it off
My heart was heavier than it ever had been
Barely ever slept kept seeing the bad dreams
Ordered three cigarettes and caffeine
You know I'm cheap but you are no antique
There's no need to thank me
Just thank your lucky stars that we never had beef
I never wanted to kill you though I tried
Although it wouldn't have been you but me that would have died
I decided what seems like a long time ago
That I could put my life into the microphone
Even if it meant I'd never buy a home
We'll die happy even if we gotta die alone!

I had to go about it, ride it out and find it myself
And there's some stories I can tell you
I had to fail, had to fall just for what I did well
And there's some stories I can tell you
 x2
You've got to go about it
You're going to ride it out
You're going to know about it
You're going to let it out

Ya
Had to strip it all back to discover me
Discover you see the love in each
Ugly gutter it was a part of me
Had a gargoyle on every artery
Guarding my heart a marksman
Locked on a target in darkness
But fuck it was hard to sleep
'Cos everything I feared became part of me
See we became a carcinogenic thought
Cause and effect that would mimic war
Walk through the valley of death with the dark
To grasp the importance of breath
Before we would war with the rest
You and me we were chalk and cheese
Always a lesson unless I had to let you be me

I had to go about it, ride it out and find it myself
And there's some stories I can tell you
I had to fail, had to fall just for what I did well
And there's some stories I can tell you
I had to go about it, ride it out and find it myself
And there's some stories I can tell you
I had to fail, had to fall just for what I did well
And there's some stories I can tell you
You've got to go about it
You're going to ride it out
You're going to know about it
You're going to let it out",https://genius.com/Urthboy-stories-alternate-version-lyrics
Easy Baby,Smokey’s Homies Remix EP,2013," x2
Let me down easy
For your love for me is gone

I know you wanna leave, I wanna let you
If I could buster up the courage to forget you
I can think of nothing else but to speak these sorts
But I would never take that course
We don't to the things that we used to do
A night walk and takeaway food for two
A few coins in the buskers tunes for you
We would talk about the people and the things we knew
My dumb books don't enjoy the same mileage
I used to always have a way to get you smiling
I noticed in your eyes at a glance
The difference to the big round ones that took a chance
Calling out we're older now
Yo, why the hell we been holding out?
There's no buttons to stop us growing apart
So I don't even know where to start

Let me down easy
(You don't even need me)
For your love for me is gone
(You don't even see me)
Let me down easy
(Let me down easy)
For your love for me is gone, gone, gone
(Let me down easy)

Baby won't you put me out of misery
I can't say it but I see it all vividly
A long time ago we let go of symmetry
Surely we don't want to finish this bitterly
Hate to say it, but we don't talk we nag
We got comfortable and we got mad
We lost something that we once had
We given up on getting that back
It's not for my best of intentions
I know I'm no-one better than I am for mention
You're all I know even if a shadow of the former
Woman that I know, you let me down easy
Don't see grief, looks deceive me
And I got a good (??)
Meaning what?

I put it off a little bit more
Cause maybe I could open your door
Find a bit of peace in this war
But baby

Let me down easy
(You don't even see me)
For your love for me is gone
(You don't even need me)
Let me down easy
(Let me down easy)
For your love for me is gone, gone, gone

We can make the paper work like a bureaucracy
You print it out you fill it in you got to do it properly
Got form with the forms it's a modern day 
odyssey
On hold again, speech recognition, listen!
I can't say it any clearer damn, machine listen!
This is in the name of being efficient
Seems to me it's just a cheap system. What would I know?
If there's any human on the other end let me speak with em
Make me wonder how my grandma would've dealt with it
Even the younger generation say to hell with it
She probably would've tried to have a conversation with it
That's how it used to be so she'd be very patient with it
But connect her incorrectly she'll be hatin' on it
I don't want to know the reason why you're charging so much
Or your new surcharge from not charging enough
A healthy ignorance is often a must
You try to cut it out but I want to keep it off the cuff
I'm outty 5-thou and that's what's up

I sense some teething problems
Complaining ain't gon' stop em
No wonder everybody is escaping
Is it too much to ask for patience
I'm not buggin' I'm just shruggin'
Is it so wrong to want some time out?

You don't know me 'cos I'm out of the loop
A little slow but I'll catch up with you
No hating I'm just from another school
I was upfront now back in the queue
My pop says he got a déjà vu
The gap was a chasm that grew
Industrial revolution ends…
When will it end?
Better hit the ground running if you're keep up with them
They'll put a hole in your pocket if you're gonna keep up with them
Forgive me I'm a little glazed over
Compromising my role with the monster
Just gotta gotta gain composure
Before I'm on the same page as you
Is it so wrong to want some time out?

Hellsong,Spitshine,2009,"Everybody, come on
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Everybody throw your hands right up in the sky
Let's go, let's go, let's go

Even your grandma and your grandad
Distant relatives you never knew you had
Never kept tabs
To their far-fetched friends either ends of the map
Whatever goes everybody knows that
To the party crowd, every week they turn it out
They work their fingers to the bone, they deserve it now
And when the big tune drops hear the floor shout
When we get the call out, we all out

According to the people
The people that resemble
Disciples of the temple
We're all going to hell
We're all going to hell
We're all going to hell
We're all going to hell

We'll be joined by agnostic and atheists
And loopy cuckoo cults across the Earth's radius
The brightest of the bright will be
Coupled with the shadiest
Workaholics condemned to pens with the laziest
The passive and the ropable, no hoper and the
Forgettable and uh, the quotable
The centre of attention to barely audible
Not even any privileges for the laudable
What Ben Lee meant, with we're all in this together
On the high road to hell we're birds of a feather
Nothing can unite us like endeavours to the nether
Bureaucrats lobbying Lucifer with a letter
I swear that Satan will get sick of it quick
Leavin' the evilest of evil even thinking to quit
To the tune of Kenny G playin' saxophone licks
Thinking hell has really gone to shit

According to the people
The people that resemble
Disciples of the temple
We're all going to hell (let's go-o, let's go-o, let's go-o)
We're all going to hell (let's go-o, let's go-o, let's go-o)

We're all going to hell (let's go-o, let's go-o, let's go-o)

The Gallagher brothers are hanging with the brothers Grimm
Church choir mingling with them that never sung a hymn
The pope and all the endlessly devoted under him
Fellas that lived to the fullest to them that died wondering
And all the underlings, up to the chief
Execs, the celibates that never had great sex
Are getting cosy with the X X X, the devil accepts all
Creatures great and small (yes he will take your call)
The booking agent, label rep manager
Professional promoters hard to pick from amateurs
They hard to pick from anarchists who're hard to pick
From lawyers that are lining up for damages (isn't it all fabulous!)
Whatever happened to happily ever after
Obama and Bin Laden, gathering clouds darken
It's not the way it was supposed to be
""don't stand so close to me""

Everybody c'mon, we're all in the fold
There'll be a bright future for all
Everybody c'mon, we're all in the fold
There'll be a bright future for all
Everybody c'mon, we're all in the fold

Above The Canopy,Spitshine,2009,"You'd swap it all, swap it in a second
From bust to boom, you'd uproot it in a session
Something bigger beckons, you could have investors
More than a line of work, it's a line of living that impresses
Too refined for the wretched, yo where's the respect
In that? No need to mention that, they'll get defensive
Where your new friends live, nothing's too expensive
Cursed to be the subject of envy
Ya met with Saudi princes in penthouse suites
Where you joke about a run for a senator's seat
Turnbull know as well as Berlesconi know it to be
Cash rules everything around me, cream get the
Money, do as Donald Trump did and brother keep
It coming, keep your motor and Moey running
Pimped out steady slumming, son of a mogul
Daughter of a magnate, both agreeably noble
And you would swap it all to be connected with an oligarch
An army of aristocrats with their collars up
Button up in Zurich, undo 'em in Florida
Never let 'em know that you were once a commoner

Can it be, that you above the canopy
It's taken more than touching wood, it's all good
Glory bound but heavy is the head that wears the crown
So don't look down

You'd swap it all, swap it for the jewels
Ain't I ain't talking about the trash around the neck of fools
Talkin' Tutankhamen and enough to fill up pools
When you take 'em from the tombs you can set your own rules
You don't need a getaway with a fleet of Bentleys
Billion dollar black holes does not imply it's empty
Same shit different century, triple-A reserve
Evening gowns, black tie and hor'deurves
You could swap it for the burbs, the lawn
And the letterbox, a legacy your daughter will be the heiress of
Then she'll never miss the charm of an arms dealer
Softened by his diamonds and chinchilla
He'll look around the hall and whisper that they're all killers
Make love in the master room of the king's villa
Become a narcissistic dame with an insecure son
Blazer-wearing cocky little cunt
Loves the hunt the thrill of killing rabbits
Hates his trophy wife and her heroin habit
They live in different wings of the mansion
And Let their kids run loose 'cos they can pay off any ransom

Can it be, that you above the canopy
It's taken more than touching wood, it's all good
Glory bound but heavy is the head that wears the crown
So don't look down

You'd swap it all every litre of blood
If it left you with the bloodline of a landowner, what wouldn't you handover?
No need to keep the coupon on the ticket stubs
Someone else can cut the lantana while you cut the lambada
Doesn't matter that your grandfather owned nothing
Now you're selling gas pipelines to the Russians
And kissing cousins is as cool as fuck
Cos it's better than a mongrel, better than an uncle
The ear of a general, the mouth of his daughter
She giving you much better head than the wife of the former
Stakes are increasing in tempo just like Zorba
Millionaires who get sent to trial cry paupers
Skate like Torvill & Dean over the system
Invitations from the queen to Sunday Christians
You don't need to know the rules to break it
You were born to make it, take it all the way it's automated

Wait up can it be, that you above the canopy
It's taken more than touching wood, it's all good
Glory bound but heavy is the head that wears the crown
But don't look down...",https://genius.com/Urthboy-above-the-canopy-lyrics
Ready to Go,Spitshine,2009,"Yo I ain't done yet, there's still gas in the tank at sunset
Leave em to believe that your days are numbered
Stopped to reflect got lost and wandered
Not running on empty nor forgotten the hunger
Keep swinging til we outta the bunker
Yep we'll filter through like we in a plunger but
Hear me out brah they dunno the pressure we under
Don't need to steal we reclaim your thunder
Ones to watch steppin' up a notch
Mock meat can't copy the chops
Another white boy lovin the one drop
Ordered the cake now we breakin a chunk off
This the jumpoff, connect like steel cap Dunlops
There's very little difference if the doors are locked or
Unlocked, check the stocks shits hot like what!
What ticka what ticka what ticka WHAT!

I got a fire inside and I'm letting you know
Heads will roll now I'm ready to go
I've got a fire inside and I've said it before
This is a takeover now I'm ready to go

It's about to blow so you best be warned
One minute all calm, next minute the descending swarm
In the air an impending storm, we off steady
Like the city at dawn, one blink I'm gone
Take another shot and make me strong
Heart rate at a machine gun pace and still so
On-song, fly like the Shinkansen
Never pause not a second til you're totally spent
Light up like neon and shine when the night is darkest
A catalogue of seeds now need to harvest
Speak with ardour still bizarre as harpers
We them bastards on greener pastures
In the thick of it need no master
Harder-better-stronger-faster we can't be stopped
Like Geto Boys said now all doubters drop
What ticka what ticka what ticka WHAT!

Clock keeps turning over
It might just burn your motor
Exhausted doubled over
We're coming alive
Clock keeps turning over
It might just burn your motor
And from the death that it defied
I've never been more alive

Heads will roll now I'm ready to go

I got a fire inside and I'm letting you know
Heads will roll now I'm ready to go
I've got a fire inside and I've said it before

Over and over and over and over
And turning and over and turning over…

Over and over and over and over
And turning and over and turning over…
We're coming alive

Of course we reinforce and endorse the fairness

Got a fire inside that I ain't let escape yet
And I ain't made yet, but I ain't made until I'm up in

Been called a lot but not that I got a fake rep
What came out in the wash is what I stuck to
You pissed at the fact it cut through, fuck you
I ain't stooped to talk down and suck you in
But by the same token I ain't gonna tuck you in
So keep me at an arms length by all means and
Sanitise the life out like chlorine
But be a good host, come invite this tiger in
Maybe he won't bite you then

Make the fuckers talk
Standing in the flame of fire
Fire
Say it like it is
Shout it like you're in the fire
Fire

As angry and as urgent as a teen, I try to set
The scene, natural human instinct is to intervene
The same that cut the ones who dare to dream 'cos shit is so
Naive, are cutting down the very thing that the people need
'Cos everything is already been seen
And already been deemed to be agreed and disagreed
And it seems we're first past the post steez
In a post modern post truth world truth's ghostly
For what it's worth you can quote me and
I'm a lay it like an IED and trigger it remotely
No wonder these bars get banked with boasting
Privilege does not necessarily mean you're coasting
So keep a pin close to burst the bubble
Of some earnest motherfucker that has gone to the trouble
Of being a grave digger digging the dead to life
There's nothing to suggest that salvation will arrive
To remind me of it is so contrived. I don't need
A broken record to bring me down off my high, I just need
These green eyes to roll back and sigh
As much as I wish that I had the answer why

Make the fuckers talk
Standing in the flame of fire
Fire
Say it like it is
Shout it like you're in the fire
(Fire) Fire (Fire)
I could never tell you
The impossible story
Words will never get close to
The colour of your mourning
You know that I am so sincere
But what is that helping
I can't be the author of a
Story that is not mine to tell

This is not the body that has grown out of a squalor
This is not the optimism born from living horror
The guilt could make a brother wanna lose a white collar
But uh he need it today he'll give it up tomorra
The dirt under the fingernails was never the grains
That the bones had replaced in a rubbish tip grave
The sweat they wiped off when they put their knives away
Is the same sweat we get when we dance the night away
And if I could turn the sun around and illuminate the hell
'Cos you best believe it can be found where humanity dwell
And I could write a book about a book that wouldn't sell
Be the author of a story that was never mine to tell but
Where would that lead us? Preach
To believers we're needing relievers but
I am no teacher and you resent the grievance
But if I don't at least try it's like I deceived yaz
The story must be told, some narratives must
But it won't be delivered by the man in the tux
Nor will it be heard over the inner city folk
Saying, ""fuck it all, fuck it all, fuck it all"" for all 12 months 'cos

I could never tell you
The impossible story
Words will never get close to
The colour of your mourning
You know that I am so sincere
But what is that helping
I can't be the author of a
Story that is not mine to tell",https://genius.com/Urthboy-impossible-story-lyrics
Til They Snatch This Last Page,Spitshine,2009,"Let me make an announcement
I’m a sound it down and get around it like
It’s 07 found and rewound it
Not part of the pack that floundered
Count Bounce Elgusto counted
Urthboy and Tyzzle got the place surrounded
No doubt Dubs bound to crown it
No goal lower than you leave astounded
Spirit of The Signal something bout it
Love it when you mouth the lyrics as much as shout it
That’s clout brother none of it scouted
Following on from what Kool Herc sprouted
You’re with us or your judgement’s clouded
Tell me you don’t hate us for the skills we flouted?
Chose me a flow not a nose to powder
Time keeps ticking week month year louder...

Til they snatch this last page out from my hand
We hold it down, we hold it down

And until that night
I’m a let these darts find bullseyes
Shoot for the stars and accept the skies
Aim for light speed, settle for full flight
My crew are some of the most tight
Dream of a pipe? Nah I’m seeing the sights
God only knows the heights when
Hype and substance collide and cubs earn their stripes
Fuck gettin’ by I’m a get fly
Will it end will it, with an empire?
Doesn’t sound right, see I’m another type
Not the one to simplify to black and white
Instigator of the action to ignite
Like TLK, sup Nay! Keep it tight
We need every one of us to speak the light
And no one telling nobody to keep it quiet

We hold it down, we hold it down",https://genius.com/Urthboy-til-they-snatch-this-last-page-lyrics
Them Shackles,Spitshine,2009,"Deck the halls, paint the town
Everybody get your people up, gather around
Not bound to no-one, contract to no thing
Contract to no thing, you got to know things
This the sound to walk away, you walk away
Today you pop the cork and say, pop the cork and
I'm out, I'm gone, even before the song
Whether or not, uh, any of you come along
You won't hear a gong of departure
I am not the arrow your wannabe archer
(You wannabe archer) and I won't be frog marched
To your rut, I am not your pup so keep up
Catch me in no man's land, never yes man's land
Understand what I rep man, what I rep man
I'll take back my liberty, take back my liberty
Cause I had this epiphany

You break them shackles (shackles)
Them shackles (shackles), them shackles (shackles)
You break them shackles (shackles)
Them shackles (shackles), them shackles (shackles)
You break them shackles (shackles)
Them shackles (shackles), them shackles (shackles)
You break them shackles (shackles)
(Break them shackles down - down - down)
(Break them shackles down - down - down)
(Break them shackles down)

I really like your motto
The part where I just follow
The bitter pill
That I'm supposed to swallow
With my feet in irons
Narrowed my path
Gave me a focus
Somewhere to start
You must break them

You break them shackles (shackles)
Them shackles (shackles), them shackles (shackles)

You break them shackles (shackles)

Call your family and friends
Tell 'em that the saga ends, it's all done
We will celebrate with them
Yo we're not to be outdone
And what it is to be undone to be unlocked for free
Free from the cramped
Stamped and dated emancipated
The mandate that won't be faded
I feel like cutting loose
Against my better caution
Eradicate that distortion
And it feel awesome
Let me just stretch my arms
Stretch my legs, kneecaps feet and head
No thing can be compared, can be compared
When we leave that there for dead",https://genius.com/Urthboy-them-shackles-lyrics

Mantra, Urthboy, Count Bounce, Nay, The Last Kinection
Yo
Now I'm gonna put it down on this one for D
Yo, don't let them get in the way of your swagger, man

Now I live by the motto where I choose my own battles
Do I look like I need the petty hassles? Sure I'm with The Herd
But I ain't caught up in the politics of cattle
You can push but don't think that you'll knock me off the saddle
My job, my role, my love, is a black artform
I'm a teacup that carried the storm
My needs, my ways, my means, something outta the norm
Giving shape to what hasn't been drawn and
That requires a little of Ali and Erik Satie
Boutros Boutros Ghali, solemn gotta party
But up from them calm waters rise tsunamis
The eyes conceal the kamikaze
That's a divine wind, crush an uprising
You be the bouncer and I'll be the lightning
And I'll be the left hook that's sinking your right wing
Motherfucker drop quicker than on an ice rink uh!

Make no mistake, we'll fight fire

Don't forget that we'll fight fire
With this fire, you can bet on it

They got so much to to say but so much less to do
And I'm not hatin' on you I've just heard better than you
You should go and get your mind right but you keep on playing a part
Searching for that limelight but haters get left in the dark
And they keep knocking, knock on the door of opportunity
While I'm not stopping picking the lock off this industry
Even though they say I'm more welcome in a penitentiary
Or cemetery like Doomadgee it's hard to see the reasons
To keep up with trends and the friends that you like to follow
I'm doin' it, I do it like the rent is due tomorrow
On this beat is right where my heart is
My home is where my art is, you can bet on this
We gonna finish what you started

Make no mistake, we'll fight fire
With this fire, we can settle it
Don't forget that we'll fight fire
With this fire, you can bet on it
Make no mistake, we'll fight fire
With this fire, we can settle it

Time to get their  about the same old shit
TIme - time about the same old shit
And when it comes time to battling, they don't want
They don't want
They don't want


It goes, eye on the prize, head in the clouds
Ear to the ground, finger on the pulse of the town
Skulking around, if you got an itchy digit on a trigger pull it
Just be sure it's loaded with garlic and silver bullets
'Cos ain't no telling what'll land us in intensive care
Steady rhymin' to the crack of military snares
Guerrilla journalist mind frame, lurk in the mist
Genuine article burning in my brain
Circling my veins, unafraid of living dangerously
Unashamed so I readjust my aim
Fly folkloric, atom splittin'
I'm spittin' acid at 'em my lyrics hydrochloric
(Going to show) you gotta be watching the quiet ones
Small unassuming squids about to take down a giant one
True Elefant Traks level a minefield
Let 'em fire on us they ain't fuckin' with strongwill

Baby
Baby I'm all alone
Baby
Baby
Baby I'm all alone, alone, alone

His charms came and took me by surprise
The intensity of my love and I ain't denying it
We're fenced off but it's not goodbye
There's no wall they can put between us that's too high
I've never known a rush like that
Dragged my whole heart into this plan he hatched
And though he's a career crim, I wanna be near him
I don't fear a thing when he calls and he sings
And he says

I got no one else to turn to
And I really don't wanna burn you
But you're all I have, will you set me free?
I got no one else to turn to
And this old fool, he don't deserve you
But you're all I have, you can set me free
Baby rescue me

He said that I could bust him out the prison bars
You could fly a chopper straight into the yard
'Fore you know it, it could be like we not been apart
And I believed him but it's hard cause I'm scared and I'm scarred
All of those locks and those guards and that barbed wire
None of it could stop our escape, I hugged him till I hurt
And the tears weighed heavy on my tired eyes
Then broken and fell free, Jesus Christ the plan worked
And they shot at us, all the while inmates cheered on
Little fragments of reality no match for my adrenaline
And when it all may have erupted he said ‘fear not'
I felt safe like everything else around me was irrelevant
Tightly your hands gripped the steering wheel
Tuned into the news, your eyes glued to the road
And I realised the fear that I'm feeling is real
Cause I don't know how to run and you don't know where to go

I got no one else to turn to
And I really don't wanna burn you
But you're all I have, will you set me free?
I got no one else to turn to
And this old fool, he don't deserve you
But you're all I have, you can set me free
Baby rescue me
Baby rescue me
Baby rescue me
Baby rescue me
And it feels so good to have got you back in my arms
But we don't have time to fuck around
No time to fuck around
And it feels so good to have got you back in my arms
But we don't have time to fuck around
No time to fuck around
I got no one else to turn to
And I really don't wanna burn you
But you're all I have
Will you set me free?",https://genius.com/Urthboy-long-loud-hours-lyrics
Daughter of the Light,The Past Beats Inside Me Like A Second Heartbeat,2016,"See Granddad wanted a boy, but he got three girls, huh
You found yourself trying to bridge these worlds, Ma
That's a childhood guilt that you might've felt, huh
But he's a man of his time and in his shell, Ma
But is it normal to see mouths move?
Up and down, no sound alongside
You learned to lipread, you learned you had to bluff too
Then lit a flame to look up to a light
That would guide you back home on the darkest night
Robin said ""a kid's drowning"" you cast aside your safety
Swam on out and saved his life
At just eleven years old, something age defied and the
Woman that girl became Worked Kings Cross lanes with the bottom rung
And have never really known of forgotten ones
The hopeless, the homeless and on the run

So when I see you walking with that gangsta limp
A 'life lived properly' limp that grandmas get
I think about the path taken and the number of steps
And how it's shaping you, whatever come next
To sing your song, knowing that some things go wrong
I'm not loving that it's Peter Paul and Mary you want
But like a bridge over trouble, carry on
You're like a bridge over trouble, carry on
Still singing

Despite it all I rise
Though I may walk blind
I'm guided by a bigger force than me
I tried to live my life
As a daughter of the light
But you find out nothing's guaranteed
Despite it all I rise
Though I may walk blind
One day all of this will disappear
And I ain't got no use for all this light
If I can't share it with you dear

I look back through a mix of blurred vision
From a childhood lens and a distant rear vision
What the bible says, well it seems to have gone missing
When the violence there makes your home feel like prison
I remember that much, I remember your clutches
That held us all together from the start
Broken little family to mend and I'm not pulling punches
It took a lot to pull us all apart
Yep, take it all slowly, get a part time job
Got to pay the bills, got to take the kid to cricket training
Got to try to keep the front, everything will be okay
How long can you keep it up, underneath the poverty line
Somehow you just did it but got us through it over time?
Gotta do it full time? Nothing to it Overdraft?
Every other month and I never got the Pumps
But instead I got the mum who pulled us up out of the dumps
So now it goes

So when I see you walking with that gangsta limp
A 'life lived properly' limp that grandmas get
I think about the path taken and the number of steps
And how it's shaping you, whatever come next
To sing your song, knowing that some things go wrong

You're like a bridge over trouble, carry on

Despite it all I rise
Though I may walk blind
One day all of this will disappear
And I ain't got no use for all this light
If I can't share it with you dear

And there's a moment at 6am, waking up bleary-eyed
Jetta wants you to read her a book
She taps you on the head and says ""wake up Namah look!"" Dog and Bird with a bit of theatre in your just woke up voice She's wriggling one foot ""Grandma more!""
And I smile half asleep at the door",https://genius.com/Urthboy-daughter-of-the-light-lyrics
The Arrow,The Past Beats Inside Me Like A Second Heartbeat,2016,"Sup, I wanna welcome you to my crazy world

Hey yo, I started like a voice trailing off in the distance
Like I stumbled over someone else's fate and switched 'em
Nothing much going on, I may as well risk it all
On a career, probably blink and miss it all
Wasn't trying to wait around on no industry call, huh
Settle wherever chips would fall, huh
I just wanted to pick the ball up
Find a crew that'd lift us all up
See how far we can take the dream
If we can plant the seed, what could we make it mean?
Going to cities I'd never been, people I'd come to know
Like you did when you're doing the door at your own show
Every door led to another that led to another
From the start of Autumn through to the February Summer
We on the come-up, none of it was chasing a number
Just put it down enough to never go under but underneath
Immense skies, I was uncertain at times
What I let into the present part of my mind
If I'm lost you should understand
I'm just headed wherever my arrow lands (till I'm gone)

I'm sending myself wayward
Looking for a local shortcut
Where does my arrow land?
And I know you told me your name
But I forgot it baby, I don't want to be that man

Digging in deeper, now I'm really writing
We can do it all if we don't stop driving
Don't stop signing and building a fam
Even when half the week we hang in a tour van
Yo it isn't just business, do you think we're playing?
If we don't take it serious it all goes away
By now the label going day to day
And many artists on the roster that were making waves
I'm opening a little milk portion in a motel room
Let me make a cuppa, I got something to tell you (come here)
Tickets to your next tour quicker to sell through
Following the arrow, in a way it compels you
In a way it repulses you but it's drawing you forward
Gotta stay on the pulse here, you gotta write and record it
Gotta make a mistake, gotta know it's important
Just trying to hang in in the curves and the corners
Underneath immense skies, I was uncertain at times
How I'd get through with this lot on my mind
If I'm lost you should know that I'll be back
But I've got to put my foot upon the track (then I'm gone)

I'm sending myself wayward
Looking for a local shortcut
Where does my arrow land?
And I know you told me your name
But I forgot it, baby, I don't want to be that man

Cause every now and then
The walls are closing in
My arms stretched either side
My arms stretched either side
And who knows where it may end
The weird thing is that I've never had
A better fucking time in my life
And who knows where it may end
The weird thing is that I've never had
A better fucking time in my life
Ain't that the truth, but still

I'm sending myself wayward
Looking for a local shortcut
Where does my arrow land?
And I know you told me your name
But I forgot it baby, I don't want to be that man
I'm sending myself wayward
Looking for a local shortcut
Where does my arrow land?
And I know you told me your name
But I forgot it baby, I don't want to be that man

Little Girl's Dad,The Past Beats Inside Me Like A Second Heartbeat,2016,"I kept a little journal from before you were born
And wrote about the shape of mama's belly you formed
I filled a lot of pages up inside that first six months
You notice every single movement and it's all too much
Brought you back to our tiny two bedder in Dulwich Hill
Salute to the red brick—to some of us you're still a big deal
You see I never thought I'd own my home
But here we are as the sun sets, neighbour chats away on his phone
They say you grow up so quick, I don't know about that
But your clothes sure as hell do
And now lunch is getting packed and my diary lost track
So I've got something to tell you

You ain't daddy's little girl, I'm a little girl's dad
That's the way it's going to be
And I'm sorry you inherited a man's world, baby
It's not the way it's got to be
You ain't daddy's little girl he's a little girl's dad
And it's your world to take back
Cause the men are going to try and tell you what you can and can't be
And you ain't going to stand for that

That's a nice way of saying that *laughs*
So let's start this one again

There's so many textbooks, websites, experts
Telling you the way you should bring up your kid
When genetics kick in there isn't a way of knowing anything
About the thousand lives you may live
We don't keep it safe as we can possibly make it
Cause I don't want to wrap you up in wool
Thought it was different but I was mistaken
If I ever led you to believe that we're in control
See your chubby little arms reaching up to be held
I just want to hold you tightly and shield any pain
With your head upon my shoulders you can feel how the fire works
But also be protected from the heat of the flame
And when it seems like despair in this broken world
Knowing I will be there and ready whenever you fall
Ou're somebody's revelation, ain't nobody's girl
So no matter what direction you walk, kid you've got my support
They say you grow up so quick I don't know about that
'Cause you learn with everything you do
Now the months are so packed and my diary lost track
So I've got something to tell you

Let me say it like

You ain't daddy's little girl, I'm a little girl's dad
That's the way it's going to be
And I'm sorry you inherited a man's world, baby
It's not the way it's got to be
You ain't daddy's little girl he's a little girl's dad
And it's your world to take back
Cause the men are going to try and tell you what you can and can't be
And you ain't going to stand for that


You make your mistakes; I've made mine
You do as you wish, take your time
Say whatever you think that's your right
What does life in the other's shoes look like?
Ou were born with a strength you could never hide
So when they try you push you to the side
Push em right back, you don't ever have to step aside
Cause a lot of rules made well, they don't apply
You make your mistakes; I've made mine
You do as you wish, take your time
Little homie you don't ever have to step aside
Cause a lot of rules made well, they don't apply

You ain't daddy's little girl, I'm a little girl's dad
That's the way it's going to be
And I'm sorry you inherited a man's world, baby
It's not the way it's got to be
You ain't daddy's little girl he's a little girl's dad
And it's your world to take back
Cause the men are going to try and tell you what you can and can't be
And you ain't going to stand for that",https://genius.com/Urthboy-little-girls-dad-lyrics

Tell you where I'm comin' from
I know where I've been
I've been with you, you've been with me

Leather-bound diary, faded handwriting
Great-granddad thought it was a war worth fighting
He ended up surviving, had a daughter named Dot
That's my grandma, fell in love and married her boss
That's my grandpa, had a little hairdressing shop in Lakemba
First child ninth of December, in the years following the war ending
A baby boom set in, and now we call 'em boomers (hey mum!)
You were a straight-laced girl, say what
Went and got hitched to chain-smoking guys, say what
I've got a bit of both sides no surprised, say what
Like you're looking my different coloured eyes, say what
I got blue from brown and green songs of Donald Byrd the Trumpets
The came from a thirty-three and a third, maybe they got me
My memory is a cluster of notes
Forming a familiar melody I swear that I know

Stress in the mornin', stress in the evenin'
Stress is what I'm feelin', it's no wonder I ain't breathin'
Music is my life from before I could breath
Cause my daddy sang my mommy some melodious keys
Melodious G, melodiously
In the end it was the birth of melodious me
I picked up the tune when I was in the womb
And I promise I would pride 'em with the songs that I'm doing
I wonder if they thought that I could change the world
If I could change the world well I would change myself
First-borns seem to always know better
The past is in the future so I get to know better
Get to breath better, get to dream better
You paid for my college so I get to eat better
I saw you in the past working long hours daddy
I saw mama give dreams so we could be happy
It's deep like my African lin'age
I bet you're gonna need an African Minute
Ode it to the ancestors
Cause they answer prayers, cause they answer

There's just nothin' I'm runnin' from
Tell you where I'm comin' from
I know where I've been
I've been with you, you've been with me, oh baby

You may not even know
Things you don't know, somethin' you feel
Fading like photos, somethin' so real
It's like there's a second heartbeat
A light to lead me home
Things you don't know, somethin' you feel
Fading like photos, somethin' so real

Subconscious is monstrous, underneath like the Loch Ness
Never seen but ever present like my blackness
Puffing out my fro to to check my bestness
Makin' waves, like the flowing song of my ancestors
Dig beneath the layers
Tryna see what they are saying
Looks like I found a treasure worth displayin'
I take it down from the shelf
Shine it up like a diamond, see what it's worth

And I know some things they are forever
Know some things they hold together
I won't walk this road alone
I won't walk this road alone
And I know some things they are forever
Know some things they hold together
I won't walk this road alone
I won't walk this road alone

Nambucca Boy,The Past Beats Inside Me Like A Second Heartbeat,2016,"And all of those thousand thoughts
That could be in the back of your mind
Looking at the dressing room door
Am I good enough to don these 
whites
?
It’s the SCG
But the nerves are bilingual
Often settled by a single
Just hit the damn ball
Yeah the game is that simple
Jitter the fear of a cheap dismissal
On the walls hung the accolades
The names that have been engraved
The Bradmans, the Benauds, the giants of the game
That rose up like a fig tree out of Saturdays
The kid was seeing them like basketballs
The summer that he had been recalled
Feet moving and a better balance on the shorter ball
Scoring freely and barely getting caught at all
He was brought up Nambucca River way
Town of Macksville young kid begins to play
The way he wields the willow outside off
No matter what was throw at him well it would bounce right off
Runs came in fifties and tons
Ever since he was young
Save your legs, Phil, it’s four more runs
Baggy cap was not a match for the Australian sun
Next to noses got burnt but the emblem on the front
And the write up in the local paper
But this time not in the back of the sports pages
A local lad had cracked the Shield side
A couple of years after the Ashes of ‘05
Raised his bat that much that he got his baggy green
Flying across the Indian Ocean with the Australian team
Number 1 ranked opposition, 
Dale Steyn at the peak of his powers
Debuting against him in a nerve wracking hour
He failed at first, caught by the keeper
But it was the second innings of the match that he featured
Second Test of the series a century in both innings
The youngest to do it at twenty, no longer a secret
And it had all gone to plan
But his destiny was never that simple
Cause simple is rare
A temporary member in and out of the Test
But soon enough a permanent threat
But there, they’re in the middle that November night
Let the groundsman turn on the lights
Radio reports saying the batsmen died
So let the groundsman turn on the lights
And all of these thousand thoughts
That would be in the back of their minds
There walking out the dressing room door
Solemnly and side by side
So let the groundsman turn on the lights
Grown men crying at traffic lights
And every day there were bats outside
So let the groundsman turn on the lights",https://genius.com/Urthboy-nambucca-boy-lyrics
Wade In The Water,The Past Beats Inside Me Like A Second Heartbeat,2016,"Hey baby, baby don't you think we're lucky that we had it good for so long
We hit the jackpot, edge we got from where we come from
Poplar trees swaying in the wind, dead quiet
'cept the single engine of a passing headlight
Do you remember what that life's like?
And now your dad project a slideshow on Christmas night
My heart sunk on weekends with the rain outside
Because the cricket's called off, we could've got outright
Right? Right, day to day is cruisy on the mountainside
And bushfires used to only come in summertime
Apart from that it's fine, life's so easy otherwise
Sleepy streets mostly all free of crime
Kind of place to raise a daughter
We can reconcile our fortune in the natural order
But what's around the corner?
I know for sure that if you're ever dragged into the deep
I'll wade into the water

I'll be staying by your side
I will be staying by your side
Whatever we're facing I won't run
Wherever we're drifting from
I'm staying by your side

But suddenly you're standing there in front of me, I'm crushing hard
And part of me is to excited
Dive into a love affair, right into each other's arms
Neither of us frightened
Not a single person on the planet could've swapped, nah
Yeah that feeling when you think you're gonna be with someone till you drop
Till you drop, till you drop, till you drop

We had been together since forever when the tipping point came
Dam broke, that's when everything changed
We had been through thick and thin but bigger things lurked
Have you ever envisioned your city in flames?
No, neither of us think about when we were of a certain type
Of people that just never thought they were in range
Well, we raised a kid to think the same
The fighting that was taking place well that was always somewhere far away
Channel 24 got it, run it round the clock, got it
Switch channel,
 get on Twitter, read it, retweet it
Look out your front door, streets are at war streets
Streets to the mall and an army being called
Is the city gonna fall while they tell us stay calm?
With another close call, why are children being armed?
As we join other people tryna flee to the border
Promise if you're at sea then I'll wade in the water

I'll be staying by your side
I will be staying by your side
Whatever we're facing I won't run
Wherever we're drifting from
I'm staying by your side",https://genius.com/Urthboy-wade-in-the-water-lyrics
Rushing Through Me,The Past Beats Inside Me Like A Second Heartbeat,2016,"Take your places, dinner's served
Poets and painters, musicians, there they were
There's Pinot Gris or Merlot
Whatever you prefer
Lovers and sinners and innocent others
Oils and inks and the mixing of colours (come on)
House they called Heide, the things you discover
Different if you're over or under the covers
(Come on down) You let the breeze clear the air
(Say what, say what) The food is getting cold, I couldn't care
Your fingers running through your hair
Underneath the table I can feel the brushing of our legs
The chattering of voices, the cutlery is tapping
If we drink enough than maybe it will happen, I'm feeling tipsy
And for something risky, a nervous rush of pleasure
I'm ravaged by the pressure

Rushing through me, yeah
Rushing through me, yeah
Use me, touch me, you don't have to trust me
I don't really care if it's wrong, no
Quickly, hurry up and take me
I don't really care if it's wrong, no

Faded lipstick on the glass, okay top me up
Lavender that's in the vase, delicately cut
Across the table from my past, unruly passenger
Will someone calm my fucking heart
Cause it keeps speeding up

Every time the door is opened, the candlelight is wavy
The windows fogging up, it's hazy, the air is crazy
Below the chairs our feet are touching but neither pulls away
The pots are clanging in the kitchen, we're a thousand miles away
Then someone yells 'what are you two up to?' And I think
Trying to be world famous twenty years after we're dead, 'I'll drink
To that' he said, you got up and left and had a cigarette
This single-minded lust had consequences I ain't figured yet
Maybe it's the red but the room is spinning around
And all the colours come to life the shadows that they're bringing out
I'll join you in that darkest night, dreaming of us laying down
Blind to every thought except you're

Rushing through me, yeah
Rushing through me, yeah
Use me, touch me, you don't have to trust me
I don't really care if it's wrong, no
Quickly, hurry up and take me
I don't really care if it's wrong, no
Use me, touch me, you don't have to trust me
I don't really care if it's wrong, no
Quickly, hurry up and take me
I don't really care if it's wrong, no",https://genius.com/Urthboy-rushing-through-me-lyrics
Hey Juanita,The Past Beats Inside Me Like A Second Heartbeat,2016,"She never would've set foot in the Carousel Club
If she'd known her steps took her up to where she got shot
Wouldn't take a second look, look where she could end up
Opposite upset crooks slamming that door shut
Years later when the secretary came forward
When nothing could be done with what she said she saw
And the life of the woman gone lying on the floor
The men standing over her the gun still drawn

Hey Juanita where did you go?
We miss you and there's something that we want you to know
You never left in our memory though it's so long ago
We send search parties to look for your spirit
And know you

Put your life on the line
When they took you away from the light
And they pretty much got away with it
Yeah they pretty much got away with it
When they dragged you west through the night
It was not the time for goodbyes
And we'll never let them get away with it
No we'll never let them get away with it


The same men visited her five days prior
To let her know that she was in the line of the fire
Intended to abduct her but it didn't transpire
Her friend got the door when they enquired
They invited her to talk ""We can chat"" they said
Last thing we want to do is put a bag on your head
Paid by powerful enemies but she wasn't scared
But she don't want to follow Arthur King's steps
Tied up in a car boot, locked up in a cheap room
That'd have to scar you, watch out who you speak to
Juanita knew as King knew, just what they were up to
At high noon, corrupt cops were the hired goons, friendly warning
The kind that makes most stop talking
Pack bags, get walking, bad things happen under moonlight
Depending on what you write, friendly warning

Hey Juanita where did you go?
Hey Juanita where did you go?
We miss you and there's something that we want you to know
You never left in our memory though it's so long ago
We send search parties to look for your spirit
And know you

Put your life on the line
When they took you away from the light
And they pretty much got away with it
Yeah they pretty much got away with it
When they dragged you west through the night
It was not the time for goodbyes
And we'll never let them get away with it
No we'll never let them get away with it


You see, long before the battle wreaked havoc on Victoria St
When evictions notices gave one week
Three hundred people, leave where you live
And they left, well at least most of 'em did
They were supposed to disappear; this should've been clean
They came in heavy handed and she described the scenes
They knew it went to Askin, a premier who happened
To work Hand in hand with Saffron
Back then a bag man and bad men
Their mate Theeman, developer who bought the public housing
Overlooking Sydney Harbour, knew the place was worth a pretty penny
He could make a killing putting up new apartments
If only all the residents departed
That's when the hard men come in
Thugs come knocking while the cops are just watching
Friendly warning, pay attention to the friendly warning",https://genius.com/Urthboy-hey-juanita-lyrics
Running Into the Flames,The Past Beats Inside Me Like A Second Heartbeat,2016,"I remember what the man said, when it's time to take the next step
And you finish this degree in this industry, what you come to expect
Minimum made at the bottom of the deck, each year the rate will it's got a bigger cheque
Yeah the thought of that money it went to my head like 'I'd never have to worry about paying my rent, right?'
(Running into these flames) Kind of job that we could expect
If we took that corporate walk of respect, and the needs of the powerful that we'd protect, right?
(Running into these flames) We could end up driving Corvettes
Like big shot advertising execs, but I'm no rabbit up in them headlights
Swapped all of it to work for nothing, we take the nothing and make it something
Desktop, PC, speakers bumping, do I run from it or do I jump in?
Feel like I've been pulled back from the brink of life that I wouldn't want to have
You can keep your houses, I'll keep Blue Mountains, yaeh we'll keep putting it on the map
Let me make this clear, I see beyond the flash of the kings shilling
I don't need no one doing my bidding, I'm not top billing
But don't stop winning, I've got no choice 'cause

Everything is everything, none of this is in vain
So I keep my eyes wide open as I'm running into these flames
Running into these flames, running into these flames
I keep my eyes open wide open as I'm running into these flames
I know what you're gonna say
(Running into these flames) Do it for the starting wage
(Running into these flames) Do it for the family
(Running into these flames) Do it so that you can change

Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run

Finished high school, yeah, it was a little bit tough
Graduated university, parents be on top of me but it still ain't enough
I feel like Craig in Friday, so it's time to get a J-O-B
Minimum wage, working in a cage, feeling like a slave but it can't hold me
Now taking somebody's orders, that ain't ever been part of my style
I've been thinking for a while, all the things that I said I'll be when I used to be a child
Tell me how the fuck did I end up here? Never in life has it been so clear
That I gotta make my own way, I can give a fuck what you say
I'm feeling like God when he made the new day
So I had to get down on my indie
Took the long road cause no one was with me, left the job when others thought it was risky
Bank account low shit was not crispy, don't believe me you can come frisk me
Say to fake it till you make it, but it's hard when you're a real one so please don't mistake it
He was like a 9 to 5 still on a mission, treating every show like 'who the competition?'
Working my way out of minimum wage when you know you're educated to start 70K
And I don't know what you don't understand
I will never trust the man, I'm the one in control and I make the plans
And so

Everything is everything, none of this is in vain
So I keep my eyes wide open as I'm running into these flames
Running into these flames, running into these flames
I keep my eyes open wide open as I'm running into these flames
I know what you're gonna say
(Running into these flames) Do it for the starting wage
(Running into these flames) Do it for the family
(Running into these flames) Do it so that you can change",https://genius.com/Urthboy-running-into-the-flames-lyrics
Rubble of the Past,The Past Beats Inside Me Like A Second Heartbeat,2016,"The wounds we licked
And losses inflicted
Drifted off in the distance
And battle scars lifted
If history is told by the victor
Rip the old script up, painted over picture
The official version of the vista, rose coloured glasses
But can you hear the whispers? They're singing
And of all of those winters
Those incremental inches
The memory of which is
Like sand through the fingers
If history is told by the richest
Maybe you could pay to fix the painted over picture (picture, picture)
Official version of the vistas but can you hear the whispers? They're singing

We're still trying to swallow down the past
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Before the past takes us down with her at last
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

I can remember on that day
We were the reigning champions
You swallowed down that trophy
All you remember is what they said
You're digging in to debris
For shards of glass that reflect the self
You thought was good and now all those parts
Of you are dying somewhere else
Cough it up it's gonna hurt
But if you cough it up you'll remember
All the roses that you grew
And all of the beauty that came through
Dusty skin from the rubble of the past
Wipe off the shit and find at last
We are right here, we are right now
And we're gonna get through all of this somehow
Somehow

Going through the rubble
Going through the rubble (somehow)
Going through the rubble
Going through the rubble

We're still trying to swallow down the past
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Before the past takes us down with her at last
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
We're still trying to swallow down the past
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Before the past takes us down with her at last
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

So we tried to write it down and document it in the hope
That maybe later you can understand the fuck where we're coming from
And the photograph is sepia and thinnin', you could swear to God
It's not a version of ourselves we're running from
What's necessary to forget for history repeating
The finer details like a hairline that had receded
So we're going through the rubble looking for a treaty
To find a pulse when you thought the heart had stopped beating
And if a spoonful of fiction helps the history go down
Can you trust the version of events that we know now?
Who we think we are become a battleground
The past is a thing that we fling around
A thing that we fling around, a thing that we fling around
A ship we can run aground, wreck for the treasure found
Settle on a new account

Going through the rubble
Going through the rubble
Going through the rubble
Going through the rubble
Going through the rubble
Going through the rubble
Going through the rubble
Going through the rubble
Going through the rubble
Going through the rubble
Going through the rubble
Going through the rubble
Going through the rubble
Going through the rubble
Going through the rubble
Going through the rubble",https://genius.com/Urthboy-rubble-of-the-past-lyrics
Wolves at Bay,The Past Beats Inside Me Like A Second Heartbeat,2016,"Why'd you do it
Went ahead when there's no one to guide you through it
Like nothing to it, the present danger, you mighta knew it
Either way you're walking right into it, like you're invited to it
Was it worth it?
Trying to throw the tide back at the ocean like maybe you could divert it
But maybe it's already certain?
And they're saying that it's a lost cause Jack, you should draw curtains
The sacrifice, that you offered up
Followed through and coughed it up, they want to knock you out
They want to lock you up, did you ever think twice?
Cause if it's economic or not, everyone has their price
And the toll that it took, from rolling the dice
And dedicating your whole life to getting integrity right
From the bush to the bright lights, and the building sights
On the frontline gathering to fight

There was no hesitation, no thought of being brave
Just a certain elation, keeping the wolves at bay
Keeping the wolves at bay
Won't let the light go out in me
Can't let the light go out in me
Can't let the light go out in me
Won't let the light go out in me

Why'd you stick your neck out, enough to get it cut off
You could've gone under the radar and then caught the run-off
The lifestyle will rub off, the perks of the plum job
But then you never sold your people out for the pay of some boss
The young city that wants to be a metropolis
All of these apartments, skyscrapers, offices
Acquiring of properties, driving out the poverty
Askin was the premier and everywhere he's pocketing
Nobody was stopping 'em, they never gave a second thought
To what they were demolishing, if they got fined
It wasn't what the profit is, they say couldn't stop progress
Money, power and politics and the cause seems hopeless
But if progress at any cost is this
When people are steamrolled and pushed out like they cease to exist
Well, what kind of process is this
It was time for the ground beneath to shift

Danger all around us
Time to stand up and be counted till we number in the thousands
Time to take back what's ours from these cowards
Corrupted by their power in their ivory towers
So we making no allowance
For the greatness of the labour or the lateness of the hour
Time to take back what's ours, never cower
In the belly of the beast where still the weak get devoured
But

There was no hesitation, no thought of being brave
Just a certain elation, keeping the wolves at bay
Keeping the wolves at bay
Won't let the light go out in me
Can't let the light go out in me
Can't let the light go out in me
Won't let the light go out in me

I've faced the menace, I've seen its teeth
Casting its shadow
Can't let the light go out in me
Let the light, let the light in me
Won't let the light go out in me
Let the light, let the light in me
Won't let the light go out in me",https://genius.com/Urthboy-wolves-at-bay-lyrics

I frown and down my brow
I pout, how you like me now?
Yeah, we scout, I pray we out
I’m kitted out much better than the next man
I’m the damn groom he’s the best man
Cut, tailor made ready pressed and
I can help you out make you see like a desk lamp
It’s suitable, freeze it pause it
That’s beautiful I’m really important
Don’t let the public inside of the cordon
Bodyguards do whatever you need to sort em!
Check me on a magazine cover
Ask my opinion on something or other
Ha, so I say something or other
After all motherfuck' gotta sing for his supper, right?
Trash the room, check out, leave
At least that’s the way that they’d have you believe
I’m a give you whatever dream you need
What you walk away with’s not what you see, no sir, no way

I’ve seen your photo, your photo don’t look a thing like you
I’ve seen your photo, for a second I could see right through
I rubbed my eyes, swear that they must be telling me lies

I am not a crook how could I, I'm a christian?
V for Victory, V for Victim
T for Trust me man T's for Tricked em
It's all down to how you depict em
Can't always pick em, win some lose some listen
We could bang heads, bring a new slogan
No more known as Irwin, used to be Hogan
That’s what we promote, let the quote do the work
It’ll work it’ll be worth the dough
Unlikely, “crikey” is just unlike me
It’s not like it’s in the national psyche
Who could be fake as that?
Like Phillip Ruddock and his Amnesty badge
That's why I prowl, I growl, I scowl
I frown and down my brow
I pout, oh you like that now?
Yeah we scout, but fuck that, I'm out

Express conga line to underline the last name
It seems we’re behind and we don’t wanna start late
This adrenaline is meddling with the heart rate (Ah)
Some of the list, well, it’s unticked and can’t wait
Can’t wait to sit still and can’t break
Can’t shake the shit, through it all we still partake in it
Facing it like we haven’t lost faith in it
Of course you got stakes in it
It’s not a matter of you wasting it
Like black crude in Kuwait and it, cat ‘o’ nine tails rat-racing it

Gets sold like fools gold gets extolled
Your absence is felt tenfold

It ain’t a contract either party need to rip up
Don’t want no mix-up, you could get a lift up
Nobody decapitated others over hiccups (Yo)
You’re the kind of person that you notice when they’re gone
And the little hand tocks as the clock ticks on
And I miss that song that we sung so long ago
I know a little place you can dock your boat (Right there)
You’re not Ronnie Biggs, you’re really not on the run
It’s like I haven’t seen you since the Rabbitohs won
So welcome back whenever you come (When you come)

Look, I can’t stand the distance
I’ll give up all preconditions
All will be forgiven and if you

No Other,The Signal,2007,"In case you don't know
Just in case
Nah, I think you know
But you know
It's not like I say it every day
But still
Still

She's asleep now, I can tell by her breathing
The slow and steady rhythm that her pulse is beating
Mine's more frantic, I wonder of what she's dreaming
I wake up in the morning as she's off and leaving
And I peel the covers back, she's my big deal
My doctor Phil fulfilled yeah, she's my Brazil
I'm seeing why she chose healing
The way we get along is a symptom of the close feeling
And though my monitor gets more of me than she does
We've got love but love does not always lead us and well, that's the grind
I wanna look back on my life and say I've done my time
And underline these cloud number nines
We've both got our own hustle, the view we look out over
Isn't always panoramic so our feathers get ruffled
Let's stay on our toes, we never played it slow
Lay low but we stay on the go, so hear me out

You should know that you're my best friend
And there's no other
Love for me I got you and you got me
And you got me and there's no other
You should know that you're my best friend

Love for me I got you and you got me
And you got me and there's no other

There it is
And there's no other
And there's no other

You should see the way she greets me
With her day changing smile, she heats me, arms out to reach me
Years down the track could it be that it's so easy?
I'll keep believing, as long as she still needs me
Steady as decade-old oaks
I find I'm envious of old folks who stay together until they croke
And still flushed with rushes of love to the head
Even after the years worth of words said
I want to share a deckchair and there
I'll run my worn out hands through your beautiful grey hair
And we'll laugh about, what we worried of in our twenties
And We didn't stop to consider if we were ready
And we rarely placed the penny in any priority
We could groundhog day it without any monotony
Our love never sought no headline, nor sort no deadline
Here we are again, it's bedtime

You should know that you're my best friend
And there's no other
Love for me I got you and you got me
And you got me and there's no other
You should know that you're my best friend

Over Before it Began,The Signal,2007,"Oh my God, you were excitement on legs
And everything you said gave me an incitement to beg
I don’t claim to be no expert but I like what I read
Was just tryna get your attention, not get you in bed
We’d hide in your dorm room, you were easy to talk to
You led me on a boulevard of respite I could walk through
For 36 hours thought I’d uncovered a fortune
The truth is I saw nothing else from the wharf’s view
Touched you escort you, court you and hold hands
And you were joking of how I’d be as an old man
My pulse was racing, shaking up my cold hands
Good christian kids behaving like adults can
But it was more than that I had to ask you for your number
This could be an endless summer, that’s the spell I’m under
Didn’t get it even as I bid you adieu
With an ache from something I couldn’t pursue

Oh baby (Baby!), it was over before it began
It was over before it began
It was over before it
Was started, we parted, you walked home
Baby, it was over before it began
It was over before it began

Was started, we parted, you walked home
Baby, it was over before it began
It was over before it began
It was over before it
Was started, we parted, you walked home
Ou
(Come on, yeah)
And I walked home

He smiled timidly and that had been how he had hooked me in
Telling, like that awkward split second that I looked at him
He shook my hand, I shook within, barely had I even met him
I wanted to let him occupy my time settings
We sat for hours talking on the rollaway
I flirted how I only knew and laughed at how you’d look like at an older age
It was a golden day and a half another, last of summer
I had to laugh it off right after you had asked my number
You see we’ll both be going back in separate cars
This’ll never last, almost love you my regretful epitaph
I longed to tell him that I meant what I said
When we emptied out it all, all the stuff in our heads
I meant it when we touched as well, was flustered as hell
Tempted by the same reason I can’t trust in myself
Yeah, I bit my lip and waved goodbye, the phone rang
“Oh Fuck!” It was my boy on the line...

Oh baby, it was over before it began
It was over before it began
It was over before it
Was started, we parted, you walked home
Baby, it was over before it began
It was over before it began
It was over before it
Was started, we parted, you walked home
Oh baby, it was over before it began
It was over before it began
It was over before it
Was started, we parted, you walked home

It was over before it began
It was over before it began

Nuthin I'd Rather Do,The Signal,2007,"Could’ve played stocks, badge says bank teller
Deluded shoe salesman with a statesmen’s umbrella
Think of all the things that I could’ve put my heart into
Truth is, there’s nothing that I’d rather do

Ha ha, come on
Yeah
Oh
That sounds so sweet
You know who it is! I'm back, yeah

Because the wind can blow in a falsetto, enshrouding 'em
Clogged up crowd in the cold sun cowering
Like where despair and rare hope encountering
Or even getting through that twenty-four hour thing
Making monsoons out of afternoon showerings
They say, “get that cash” 'cause what it bring’s empowering
Experience enough loss you get sick of salvaging
Gutter living star-gazer, daily life devoured him
But fuck that, we follow on like Laxman and Dravid
Serve it up, we got our fill, still we keep carvin’ it
Lot of shit went down when you were passing it
Far too busy guarding it, an Elefant never forgets, it pardons it
We put the art in it, that’s not even the half of it
We make it marvellous in honour of the pioneers who fathered it
So whether we leave you carpeted like moulting hair
Or don’t care at least you know there’s nothing false in there, yeah (Come on!)

When I think of all the things that I could’ve put my heart into
The truth is, there’s nothing that I’d rather do
Nah, there’s nothing that I’d rather do
 what? What?
When I think of all the things that I could’ve put my heart into
The truth is, there’s nothing that I’d rather do
Nah, there’s nothing that I’d rather do
Turn it up

L—Lord let me know
When I get to this f—fork in the road
What I need is one decision, god speed
Instead of me w—w—walking it slow, exhausted and cold
Please give me strength to the tenth degree
Give me strength to stand up like there’s no empty seats
Which path should I take? Both are big passions
And I know I’m responsible for this kid’s action
Don’t really need to be a wealthy man
But I do need that helping hand
I've got size and skill to follow my dreams of rugby
And hear the holler and screams as fans follow the team
But I also got that knack to word things
Exact then rap superb to murder tracks
And I saw where my purpose at
Now I’m here before you with my decision in a horse shoe, I say

When I think of all the things that I could’ve put my heart into
The truth is, there’s nothing that I’d rather do
Nah, there’s nothing that I’d rather do
 what? What?
When I think of all the things that I could’ve put my heart into
The truth is, there’s nothing that I’d rather do
Nah, there’s nothing that I’d rather do
Turn it up

Ayy
Who wears the pants stands out like a sore thumb
Highlighted aura moving towards the forefront
Seduced my focus, hopeless when it’s all done
All settled options called up, we can all run
Pace of the naive and my sleeve is draped in freezing rain
Half-shredded couch, I can count the doubts
But they always seem to leave the lane
Etched my name across a stone cold surface
Suspect on the game, I throw rocks at the circus
First thing is many sleepless nights
When it feels like you ain’t really dreaming right
Tryna balance in the centre when the Jenga might
Topple in front of my eagle eyes but I legalise
Justify this addiction, this is my life
And you can put it in your Discman
(C’mon and press play) I wouldn’t have it any other way, ‘cause

When I think of all the things that I could’ve put my heart into
The truth is, there’s nothing that I’d rather do
Nah, there’s nothing that I’d rather do

When I think of all the things that I could’ve put my heart into

The Clocks,The Signal,2007,"Yeah
Aeronautical activity is all grounded
No F16 jets, no alarm sounded
Not even a rumour that a terrorist downed it
Without any hint of controversy around it
No police called, everybody is accounted
Cover-up unnecessary, so no facts shrouded
Traffic grinds to halt leaving streets crowded and
The authorities don't know nothing about it
No little old ladies heard saying ""oh my""
People getting later but not looking to know why
It's like suddenly the signs said ""Don't Drive""
Shouldn't someone worry the economy'll nosedive?
The young and ambitious stop as life goes by
Cities that never sleep caught with a closed eye
Two year olds get ignored but fail to cry
By the side of their parents as they look up to the sky

And the seas would part and they’d part for you
I’d run anywhere to join you on a path for two and I
Don’t wanna contemplate what I might do
If I lose you I’ll find you, I will find you

Stop the clock, I'll walk away
'Cause we've got something untamed
If what's beneath falls through
Then I'll fall, yeah, I’ll fall, but I’ll fall with you
Stop the clock, I'll walk away
'Cause we've got something untamed
If what's beneath falls through
Then I'll fall, yeah, I’ll fall, but I’ll fall with you

As if it never happened, a computer went dead
We could fix this is what an technician would've said
Everything froze only one thing spared
Email spam's like cockroach eggs
People sat in cinemas where darkness glared
And analysed the blank space like architects
Systems stopped dead not even half a step
Dogs stopped barking not 'cause master said
A father paused reading to his daughter in bed
While a bloke stood around, looking lost in his shed
Doctors watched on as their patients bled
Their patients, unfazed and intrigued by the red
For a second y'all suckers stopped trying to get cred
And the West ceased pumping Islam full of led
Yeah the god damn world sat perched on the fence
All the analysts hadn't figured out what it meant

It’s why the seas part and they part for you
I’d ask that you join me on a path for two
See, I don’t wanna ponder as to what I might do
And if I lose you I’ll find you, I will find you

Stop the clock, I'll walk away
'Cause we've got something untamed
If what's beneath falls through
Then I'll fall, yeah, I’ll fall, but I’ll fall with you

Darling, let's let them sleep
Come and lay next to me
Before we set them free
I wanna hear your heartbeat
Let's let them sleep
Come and lay next to me
Before we set them free
I wanna hear your heartbeat
Yeah

Finally some downtime due to the deadlock
Electricity is cut back down to bedrock
Hordes watch on as we walk by shellshocked
As if five billion waiting on a bellhop
I can whisper the things that I need to
Blanket of silence surrounds when it sweeps through
The world’ll hold on whether or not it agrees to
And it’ll start again but I will never leave you

Darling, let's let them sleep
Come and lay next to me
Before we set them free
I wanna hear your heartbeat
Let's let them sleep
Come and lay next to me
Before we set them free
I wanna hear your heartbeat",https://genius.com/Urthboy-the-clocks-lyrics
Modern Day Folk,The Signal,2007,"We the modern day folk singers, even if
The old folk singers think we're just dope slingers
Ode to the idiom and the flow Gideon
My ear a melody net, yet there's no singing em
Some are not kidding they're puzzled at how we talk
I tell it's not talk, like cheese and chalk
And we walk without fear in the ground we tread
And it's flawed 'cause you're hearing all the thoughts goin' 'round my head
Where paradox and respect wed
And I work to my catalogue not my nest egg
And the wordplay is direct and unashamed
Taken in all the frame with a ridiculous name
So many of us made a claim
Some soared so high, plenty fell off like a shot down plane
The wind blowing your bridge over troubled waters down
But don't worry we'll sort it out

And you've got to be engaged
You're not just listening to your mates
We're trying to save the world, a brave new world
I love that bitter taste
And you've got to be engaged
It's not a grudge match every day
It's the necessary phases
'Cause no folk song ever saved us

Like A Tribe Called Quest said, it's all expected
Things will get hectic, change is a threat
Like when Dylan went electric 'cause we all affected, directed, defected
In puffy chested but then out dejected
No massage for every bad back
It isn't Hollywood, it's just Mad Max
It isn't the serum to get rid of your anthrax
No Mother Teresa, it's just the beat of a damn track
I don't really care for half of these MCs
But some of them are like the path of a set-piece
All of it and more we can't let you get sleep
No relationship was started on a wet dream
So we knock down doors and we rock our jaws
And we don't turn our back if it's not our cause
Stand and stare upward form the ground floor
Get up, what you down for?

And you've got to be engaged
You're not just listening to your mates
We're trying to save the world, a brave new world
I love that bitter taste
And you've got to be engaged
It's not a grudge match every day
It's the necessary phases
'Cause no folk song ever saved us
And you've got to be engaged
You're not just listening to your mates
We're trying to save the world, a brave new world
I love that bitter taste
And you've got to be engaged
It's not a grudge match every day
It's the necessary phases
'Cause no folk song ever saved us

It's really not that profound, the way a phrase
Knocks you down to others it's nothing more than a background
But some are weak at the knees at that sound
I rewind the song and sit down now
Constantly flip between the FM stations
The jocks spruik the next sensations
But I care little for the next sensations
I'm sorry taht I left you waiting

Uh-huh, yeah, yeah
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

Black Dog,The Signal,2007,"Yeah, yeah
He never thought he’d think of killing himself
Nobody had a doubt of anything to do with his health
He wasn’t ever that kind of gentleman that needed help
Just an everyday bloke tyna handle what he’d been dealt
But it was steadily more difficult to conceal
When he was too proud to reveal, the loneliest fear that he feels
Envious of those on an even keel
'Cause from where he’s sitting that disposition is completely unreal
It’s not like his car’s lost any one of its wheels
It’s just as if it’s been clamped up, secured and sealed
Yo, he’s flown the white flag and shown he’d yield
Yet the 
black dog
 relentlessly honed his heel
In a planet of 6 bill’, still not a soul to understand
Too long ago relinquished the upper hand
Got him suffocated, tightened like a cummerbund
Recalls what happy is but that’s for another man

Yeah, yeah
His path is lonely, even when it’s public
The clown cries tears, the crowd cheers and loves it
Coils with his inner turmoil, cups it, tucks it
Neatly, keeps 'em sweetly unflustered
People of prominence are just as likely
Even if they’re as hyped as hyphy, bright and feisty
They might be the John Conrads and Steve Rogers
Gold medals, best and fairest, they got notches
Cars and ski lodges, they might even be doctors
Tragic characters, silver screen operas
Convinced that they’re imposters, row with one oar
Ones that made themselves now think they’re done for
And they can’t talk, someone on the mute button
Men die in bachelor pads, nobody knew nuttin'
The view from here is as grey as vacant car parks
Don’t ask why it’s so hard to laugh

It’s 2 a.m, he’s wandering streets alone
Can’t remember these avenues, they feel unknown
Listen to the drone of a distant truck, compression brakes
Afraid of the frailty of the things he’d set in place
He’s had better days, some worse than others
Not the kind of fella proud of sleeping in under the covers
Close up the shutters, take the phone off the hook
And if they enquire he’ll reply he was crook
It overtook him too long ago and took his honour
Slow but surely, imprisoned like 
S. Corby
17 years since he celebrated 40
Too many candles to blow out, and it’s too corny
He might make a decision and set off a chain of events
Find a way to say what he meant
But he’s spent just looking to get by the black dog
In the corner of his eye won’t back off…

Yeah
Getting stalked by the black dog
Stalked by the black dog
You back down but still he won’t back off
Trying to navigate without a map of
The way home, stalked by the black dog
Stalked by the black dog
Follow , why doesn't it back off?
Getting followed, followed by the Black Dog
Getting stalked by the Black Dog
Stalked by the Black Dog
You back down but still he won’t back off
Trying to navigate without a map of
The way home, stalked by the black dog
Stalked by the black dog
Follow , why doesn't it back off?

(Wrong one) And it's most definitely not the Tongue
(Wrong one) And no one mistakin' it for Ozi Batla, right?
(Wrong one) My name's Urthboy, now here we go

The crowd all watch and shout at the shot
Now we’re off and running we’re out of the blocks
You’ve already put in your lot
Unable to stop like Peter, follow the leader
Leave it all out on the line, you’ll see the
Fade, ideas get early graves
On top of a face to save
There’s still more mistakes you’re waiting to make

You backing the bull or the matador, son?
I’m backing the sword, I’m backing the pen
It’s muddier than any weapon you’ve got
Stop, turn it up, Gus, I’m ready to rock
Not going to misplace
My bet now, no sweat now
Put a thousand on those Elefant Traks boys
To pull their best out

Man, you got no credits left now
Like a pokie addict, you incorrectly
Adding up your takings, who got you shaking?
We take you to task, and while the fun lasts
The bandwagon stay gagging for the favourite
When the underdog tastes a victory
You got no say in it

You backed the wrong one
Long shot, stole your thunder
You backed the wrong one
You had the rug pulled out from under
You backed the wrong one
You fall in, we all in
Hate to be the one to break it to you
But you backed the wrong one

The sound of those drums
Make this field look like a cattle run
You wasted your time making
Those tallies of battles won
But that all comes to naught
So hold that thought
Till your nose is past the last post
Charge a glass and make the winning toast
Who’s having the last laugh?

Well, you looking at him and you wouldn’t want him
To be getting ahead of you so you’re puttin’ one on him
But who are you conning, the one just born?
On the Titanic, you can’t run from the storm
You backed the fraud, we pulled your card
Built on sand we pull it apart
Forget your class, forget your cast
Son, it’s how you carry your scars

It’s funny how moments are frozen in time
Vital mistakes turn a stone in your mind
Whips you across that finishing line
And there’s always another who’s better designed
Is it luck, is it skill, is it..., is it talent?
Co-ordination, strength or balance
Or none of 'em, or the sum of 'em?
Standing on giants shoulders is humbling

You backed the wrong one
Long shot, stole your thunder
You backed the wrong one
You had the rug pulled out from under
You backed the wrong one
You fall in, we all in
Hate to be the one to break it to you
But you backed the wrong one
The long shot stole your thunder
You backed the wrong one
You had the rug pulled out from under
You backed the wrong one
You fall in, we all in
It seemed certain but when it's said and done
You backed the wrong one

When they find there's something that they gotta have
Any means justify any ends
A storm in any port whether enemy or a friend?
A hen in a wolves cloak, legend with a remote
The manifestation of a lemming is often a bloke
A lot of big notes might swing a lot of votes
With the same principle as the war of the worlds hokes
They're as common as canetoads in Queensland
You know that I play fair
Keep these hand where you can see man
I'm gettin' sick of the He-man, the thuggery
You need to be cut right back down like shrubbery
Don't call it conscience, call it a recovery
The spoilt kids that produced it I'm taking custody
Lost and found and found and lost
That you wear around your neck like an albatross

Because what you do is not brave
No matter what your megaphones say
Better off if bad laws break
And what you do is not brave
No matter what your megaphones say
Better off if bad laws break
They'll be a riot in the streets of Sydney tonight

How can you allow it, not wanna know facts or
Anything about it, keep your head cowered
By the week, month and year the days counted
Relying on a betrayal of how we were founded
Now there's no other way around it
They're coming to roost, I wonder if you'll reach a moment of truth?
The things going on under Guantanamo's roof
Even conservative christian groups ask for proof
I know you never said we're not autonomous yet
But yet the blatant neglect mean it don't need to be said
Check your fuckin' concept of self respect
Don't get it twisted, history beckoned and you missed it
The menace is distant but no less real
On our streets like the opium of Afghan fields
The only honourable ones are the ones that squeal
How's that for an inditement but that's the deal!

Because what you do is not brave
No matter what your megaphones say
Better off if bad laws break
And what you do is not brave
No matter what your megaphones say
Better off if bad laws break
They'll be a riot in the streets of Sydney tonight

I call bullshit on think tanks
Bandy to whatever conservative think tanks
Laugh long and hard like big banks
Son it's just business, don't you force that upon the listeners
'Cause the risk is that you devide your market
Some of your consumers might feel that they're your target
What you got is small and this might halve it
C'est la vie cos that's the way it's gonna be

Laugh long and hard like big banks

Ha ha, 

One of them sat
Working the pen
The other one analysed
Waves and the sands

Just like a nightly weather report
We are who you see hold court
Off track, but yet we stay on course

See, I don’t go to the bother of getting a lottery
Ticket that often, so when I do, I wanna win right
Wear my clothes baggy but the flows skin tight
A collector, with one eye out for insight
I got the arsenal to indict or invite
C'mon take a hit from the windpipe I’m inflight
The way I move even sitting still
See I could channel Cube but instead chill at will
In a town full of flag waving Blinky Bills
Just trying to ink a deal, they don’t collab they do dinner deals
I’d recommend it if you keep it sealed
Don’t worry we’ll return it you just watch the steering wheel
Time has a habit of revealing your Achilles heel
It’s that, phonetic etiquette gettin' grilled by the chisel steel
It’s been a while since the D.S. to the O.R.M

Combine Q-Tip with some fortified new shit
Not too lucid make it fit loose-knit
Lose it, little shuffle, if the shoe fit

Do something with it like Robinson Crusoe and his island
Eye to eye wilin’ talk that cause sirens
We ‘hawk-eye’ em, heh heh, just walk by 'em
You in denial while we in the Nile swimmin’ in it
Speak of big fish we’re bringin’ in it
Can someone check my ears there’s a clear ringin’ in it
Come to grips with the pen but not the sting in the tip
We’re livin’ in it, the funk that make you get on the phone
Remember where you were when you heard it and set it in stone

Still take 'em down to the cleaners though I am unbrushed
Nobody is untouched (Nah), immunity? Nah, there’s nonesuch (Yes sir)
And you wonder why we can’t trust
That’s why these tales can take animosity (Can take it)
Since the prose and blows are cacophonies
But I’ma do it properly, lock down the spectrum (Right down)
Deliver the tension, chase down redemption
But if I leave and forget to mention

Take that, take that, take that, take that
Take that to the, take that to the bank, out the bank, c'mon

Dedicated equally to right and wrong
The numerous grey areas that we divide along
I dunno, maybe it’s something like a hybrid song
'Cause the truth don’t give a shit about what side you’re on, ha
It just is whether or not the vibe is strong
None of us got our alignment on
My assignment is not to bring you a cartoon
My sixteens can cut through like harpoons
And true, I got conflict like Khartoum
You’d be in the same shoes, you will if you’re half human
I like the dark side maybe I’m half mutant (Simmer down)
My phonetics are street fighters (Ahhrduken!)
I swear I got no agenda here
Just giving you a place to surrender, dear
And no catch (Nah), I don’t even want a thanks, man, but
What I say you can take to the bank, man


Take that, take that, take that
Take that, take that, take that, take that
Take that, take that, take that, take that
Take that to the, take that to the bank, out the bank, come on

Yeah
It’s implausible but damn near impossible
Damn near enough to be illogical, oracle
Never mentioned the ending, kept the rest of us pretending
We had figured it, give it, you got it, now get rid of it
My scars are a sign I’m livin' in lived skin
Unsettled river replaces the baby face that I’m in
Played a cameo, I finally get
Marked me like hip-hop culture, and tape cassettes
You can Botox and get a nose job
And everlasting youth but the bones don’t stop dating
Give me age you can bear witness
Where I’ve been, where I’m going, it’s the best litmus
It’s just that bit that hit the spot that made you stop
That bit that got your life to drop, clear the clot
You what? Must’ve been the Kool Aid they drank
Sucker, take that to the bank

""I like the dark side""

"ROCKHAMPTON, The Pilbeam Theatre",Tour Diary: Paul Kelly Spring And Fall Tour,2013,"Friday 26 July
Today we drove 9 hours from Townsville to Rockhampton for our show at the Pilbeam Theatre. Playing shows supporting Paul Kelly in regional spots like this is pretty far removed from the audiences I play to, and I love the challenge. Still there's nothing like wandering outside the venue before the show starts and feeling like I'm about to rap at a rodeo. Aussie Blokes with Aussie Guts under tucked-in show shirts, wader in alongside their wives dressed in Sunday Best. Immaculately attired old ladies carry handbags and smile warmly as they catch my confused glance like ""don't worry kid, you'll be fine"". Either that or ""are you my grandson?""
At worst, the shows have received polite applause at the end of each song; at best, fairly raucous yelling and some heartening support from an open-minded audience. 
Paul lurks side of stage like Mr Miyagi, welcoming us as we finish
. This guy is unreal, the amount of times we peel off stage and see him nod approvingly is an honour I can't process at the moment.
We fade out hard after the long drive and crash out. Jane has the original Jurassic Park - classic tour movie for a budget motel. It turn out to be one of the sequels and T-Rex is let loose on America. This movie needs more The Rock. I go to sleep.",https://genius.com/Urthboy-rockhampton-the-pilbeam-theatre-annotated
"CAIRNS, Cairns Civic Theatre",Tour Diary: Paul Kelly Spring And Fall Tour,2013,"Tuesday 23 July, 2013
I still get excited by flights, or at least flights long enough to watch a movie. I boarded my flight from Sydney with every intention of studying the work docs our accountant gave me as homework, then proceeded to watch a movie with The Rock. Fuckin' The Rock. I imagine a salon-tanned prune riding a garish speedboat around the canals of Surfers Paradise when I think of his acting career. Of all the places in the world where people are happy to suspend their disbelief to enjoy a shit movie it's on a plane. Nope. Tired
Content with having ignored important work, my mind wandered to this tour supporting one of the best songwriters Australia has ever produced and the looming possibility of my grand scale public humiliation. I was sitting next to Lozz Benson, our 22 year old drummer on her first proper tour, who compulsively says sorry. Will the audience responses on this tour cause me to pick up this habit?
Jane met us in Cairns, having moved back to Melbourne recently. She's a great friend, an amazing singer and super important to our show so it was great to see her. The fourth piece of the puzzle is Alex Dawson who plays keys but his knowledge of audio engineering and tour managing make him a good guy to have around.
I look at this tour as a great challenge - our plan of attack is to give a little context for my songs and hopefully trick people into tolerating the show. Just as a hypnotist waves a pocket watch. We get out there and enjoy the gig; I think the spell worked.
Paul very kindly asked Jane and I to join him for a song so I madly try and memorise the lyrics between my set and his. It's all for nothing though, as I find myself standing next to Paul in front of a full theatre and promptly forget almost every line apart from the fist and second last. You haven't lived til you've painfully mumbled non-words beside a hero in front of a full house. I'm the best! Jane wisely opted out.
All was momentarily forgotten when we piled into Paul's dressing room drinking his very tidy whiskey, all a little relieved that show #1 was in the bag. 27 to go.
The early set as 7.30pm meant we skipped dinner so my last triumphant moment was staring blankly at a frozen pizza in a microwave at 2am. Bought it from a BP. It was The fuckin Blob.",https://genius.com/Urthboy-cairns-cairns-civic-theatre-annotated
"TOWNSVILLE, Townsville Civic Theatre",Tour Diary: Paul Kelly Spring And Fall Tour,2013,"Wednesday 24 July, 2013
The drive from Cairns to Townsville is one of my favourite drives anywhere. The rainforest and sugarcane; the mountains that shoot up like South East Asia and the rusted old factories puffing plumes of smoke. Jane and I sepnt time working on her verse for the aforementioned song we were doing with Mr Kelly. Given last night's events I probably should've been working on my verse.
At Townsville's Civic theatre I caught up with my Japanese sister-in-law Yuki and her 1 yr old Ren. When we ventured outside she laughed guiltily at the older men and women milling about. I tried to explain that is wasn't quite the entire audience, but secretly I opened up the possibility of a awkward gig, like a packet of chips in a cinema. Our set was great though - the audience laughed and clapped and we walked off stage and back to our dressing room.
Paul and Dan saunter in strumming acoustic guitars to go over the collab that I'd forgotten the night before. Last night I told him I wouldn't forget the lyrics again and in his easy way, Paul just shrugged it off with a smile. But not so much so that he didn't want to practice it a little more tonight. Jane and I spent most of his set pacing backstage trying to learn the lyrics - Jane was a bundle of nerves moving around with headphones and a laptop going over the song.
Then the time comes and the first notes of the song ring out. We walk onto the stage.
We didn't forget the lyrics.
Next show is 750kms away in Rockhampton, followed by Bundaberg and Maryborough as we make our way down to Brisbane.",https://genius.com/Urthboy-townsville-townsville-civic-theatre-annotated
Roll Up Your Sleeves,triple j Like A Version 12,2015,"Roll up your sleeves
And face the face it’s looking right back at me
It’s easier to leave it
It’s easier to fake it, oh oh
So I’ll go and I’ll join the free
There’s people there, they’re just like me, oh

Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright

January tricked you when it looked you in the eye
And said no matter what you've been through with me, you'll be renewed
A promise made at midnight, a fire sale that
Knew it couldn't drag you into something that
You don't wanna do, a heart that's full of nightfall
Hanging on dear life for first signs of daylight
But what if I refuse? What if it all passes like cycling of news
While I'm searching for an ocean I can wade into
What if I don't stick around for February's saving grace?
Maybe I don't know it now, I'll be in a different place
What I wouldn't dare to face if I don't find my feet
Til March I'll find a way of giving chase, best believe
The arms of april may have open hands that hold you up
The pages we're reopening from what we'd folded up
We're not tryna front with all that 'winter isn't cold enough'
But we can handle anything they throw at us

Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright

July had left you waiting, and August wasn't answering
In touch with everyone you've ever known, but never so alone
A starry-eyed September
Reminding you of something that you cannot quite remember
So you're reaching for your phone, you're calling in a favour
But it's ringing out, you're hanging up before it goes to message
Is anybody home? There's trouble in your palms
And you're making for a handrail, but if you fall
It's something that you'll own
Breathing in the time we borrow
Won't be gone until november we'll be here until tomorrow
May as well take a risk
People singing carols while I'm singing this
Roll up your sleeves this is it, you can sing it, come on

Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Ohhhhh

Crushing Hard,Turning Circle - EP,2016,"You make me nervous just by being here
Maybe I'll disappear, sneak myself away, chin on my chest
Just anything, just get me out of here
I'm going
The problem is the thought of you has got me grinning ear to ear
I'm overthinking it, walking out the door
And why can't I go through with it?
You're back inside, where am I going?

I'll rip the wings off these butterflies
They make me say things I don't mean, things I don't mean
Being so knotted up inside
Something that I don't need, that I don't need but

Suddenly you're standing there in front of me, I'm crushing hard
What if we dive into a love affair right into each other's arms
Oh, not a single person on the planet coulda ever swapped
Could've ever swapped
Could've ever swapped

And I don't know what to say so I say something that I immediately regret
And I have no idea what I said
And I become momentarily obsessed with what I've eaten, whether that's all up in my breathe
Fuck, just be cool, calm, collected
If it were that easy if I weren't bound to this harness
Immersed in wherever leads me so I'm charging in open-hearted
Propelled by the rate it's beating, and I know that I can be charming
But there are moments all of it leaves me, then our eyes lock and I ask ""How was your evenin'?""

And I wanna rip wings off butterflies that stop me from saying what I really mean
Stop me from saying what I really mean, stop me from saying what I really mean
Why am I so knotted up inside, these sweaty palms that I don't need
I'm all at sea and you took my hand and took the lead

Suddenly you're standing there in front of me, I'm crushing hard
What if we dive into a love affair right into each other's arms
Oh, not a single person on the planet coulda ever swapped
Could've ever swapped
Could've ever swapped

This is just crazy, gliding into a daydream when really
I know we've got nothing at all
And there's a glimmer in your eyes as we shake hands

When have so called experts ever sorted this out
When we're swamped by muslims, swamped by asians

Have & Hold,Turning Circle - EP,2018,"I’m blinking, staring at the sun
Thinking how far we come, punch in a number
What's in a sum? We want it on the scales
So you know we’re , but what have we just begun?
Can a line break from the scrum?
Now watch the boy run, now watch the boy run
What if these crowds were our boss yellin' out
To ""Get the job done!"",  to ""Get the job done!""
Come on, I didn’t caught a quick fame
I talked a big game, and fought for this flame
Stay lit, even when the voices say quit
 when the pace go breakneck
Some balls bounce back, some too sacred
We are not yet conquered, complacent
'Cause that's our basement, and they're our losses
But we’ll still win, just watch us

I don’t wanna let it go, I already know
How easy it falls
And oh—oh what it means to
Have and to hold, to have and to hold

And I know it’s really easy to say
To have and to hold, to have and to hold
But it’s got me feeling some kind of way
To have and to hold, to have and to hold

And the crowd noise rose till deafenin'
Let them in, let them in
Like anyone, they only want the best of things
Let them win, what have we become?
 we be honest
When the loudest ma'fuckers jump to promise that evil is upon us
And the the trees in the forest
Would you miss like Man Haron Monis, damn, look what that got us
There’s a shadow over every street
 has washed out of most of the sheets
Swinging in the wind, hung out to dry
It’s the same most weeks, but she gets by
You can’t even look me in the eye though
Time to hide behind a plebiscite though (no, no)
You find a Boogeyman lying low (where?)
Any lower you’ll be right at home, any lower you’ll be— I don’t know

To have and to hold (, what you doin'? )
To have and to hold you after all that we've gone through

Matilda,Turning Circle - EP,2018,"Verse 1 (Urthboy):
I wonder what they thought
As they stood on the ship
Looking out over the docks
Where they boarded
All that was before them
Shed their fair share of leaves
And skipped autumn
Populate or perish
Yeah I think that’s what they called it
And every single passenger is tryna to get a glimpse
Of the foreign city
Holding tattered brochures
There was hope where there was none out in the roaring ocean
Looking for the bridge that’s on the posters
You would not know anything about this new land
Carrying all your possessions in your two hands
The one millionth one to land since the news stand
It was hell out on the high seas on the ship for 6 weeks
What would it have been like taking that first step
Walking into a new life, Parramatta sunset
You don’t know much more than what you read
And never knew when you headed into burbs it changes forever
Chorus (Ev Jones):
Oh Matilda, oh Matilda, oh Matilda
Do you forget everything that we have built?
Oh Matilda, Ooh Matilda
Strike a match, burn it to cinders
Oh Matilda, where do we go now, where do we go
Where do we go? where do we go now?
Verse 2 (Urthboy):
Put in government housing in exchange for their labour
You don’t need to be skilled, just some good will, work and their favour
Number of them without language, except the tongue of their father
Greek, Italian or Spanish, the older you get, the more it gets harder
Sweat drops on a factory floor
Sweat shops before they went offshore
Steel works for the manual grunts
Second job for but you’re keeping score
New developments, building roads, schools, hospitals, post codes
Needed to get the kids educated
Needed to give them a fighting chance
They will be the ones joined by people fleeing Saigon
Life and death, will someone leave the light on?
I said will someone leave the light on?
The one upon the hill before it died come on
Chorus (Ev Jones):
Oh Matilda, oh Matilda, oh Matilda
Do you forget everything that we have built?
Oh Matilda, Ooh Matilda
Strike a match, burn it to cinders
Oh Matilda, where do we go now, where do we go
Where do we go? where do we go now?
Urthboy:
We don’t know a thing about open arms, never have
You can get robbed with an open heart so you push it back
Sailed into shore with the muskets drawn, then took it by force
Never looking back, if we don’t like it, we don’t look at that
Admit it for my book, admit it we aren’t in it for the facts
Chorus (Ev Jones):
Oh Matilda, oh Matilda, oh Matilda
Do you forget everything that we have built?

Someone Else’s House,,2014,"Took a second as he looked over the unmown lawn
His hand froze on the handle of the front door
Feet felt glued to the floor
Driver side opens, here we go once more
With the front seat feel safer than whatever lay beyond the yard
The weight of disappointment lay upon him like a scar
Red brick veneer look the same as the last
What's the chance that this won't be the same as the last?
Someone else's house, someone else's rules
Someone else's room, someone else's school
He don't fit in anywhere and knows it
Hate it when a caseworker try to sugar-coat
What the fuck? These people aren't mum and dad
So fuck 'em when they try to tell me that my goodness is becoming bad
I must be good at it, the way that they keep coming back
Kick me out, pick me up, take me to another pad

Maybe this time will be different
Start from scratch and begin again
Maybe this time will be different
Rebuild trust, restart that shit again
Maybe this time will be different
I'd swap it all for somebody who'd listen
Maybe this time will be different

You let me down again

Boys on the inside looking out
What are we waiting for?
Well maybe there's a crack in the wall that will open up
And swallow me whole
And I would disappear
But I fear that the outside world
Is a mirror that mocks me, and this is all fucked up
And they keep shattering illusions
Every time they move me on
I've been moving so long, start to forget
Where I even started from
Like a sad old song, where the feeling stays
But the words are all wrong
And no one listens, and you let me down again

Maybe this time will be different
Start from scratch and begin again
Maybe this time will be different
Rebuild trust, restart that shit again
Maybe this time will be different
I'd swap it all for somebody who'd listen
Maybe this time will be different

Part of a descending force
Nothing that the navy can’t sort

Men and the women and the children on board
Don’t fix it block it that’s the logic

Drop the access, stop the facts, get Morrison
To come in with a chopping axe head
That’s in our name now
Even though it’s really more of the same now
Here we are again don’t you think it’s funny how
What these ministers about when they choose to go the same route
Not our problem like fuck you world you solve em
International security is what we told em

Big spend for the big vote yoyo
Put em on a one way trip to Manus
Throw a billion on the boatloads make em vanish
Wash the blood off our hands that inflict the damage
We can pretend we care when our hearts are savage
If they react and they riot
Even if they’re attacked in the dead of the night
Either way they’re the villain we don’t want em in sight
Too bad look the loss of a life
You’ll be sent nowhere and you might die
We don’t care about your back story don’t try
77% of us abide by being more brutal
We get what you want with a roaring approval
Act like that doesn’t leave a stain
What is being done in our name is inhumane
Says a lot about us and Australia’s shame
Fuck you if you don’t feel the same
This is how we let it go just turn your back
This is how we let it go when we don’t have your back

Plug it in the mixer,  flow
We independant as fuck  stuck
Maybe we can make our own luck
Cause all these majors suck (that's wassup!)
We came in here to kill that noise
Stay asleep while we fill that void
One and one, two and two till we feel employed
Make a sum of our dreams like Sigmund Freud
At that point the industry were enemies
No idea,  destiny
E—T is the entity
And none of this happened accidentally

And even if they block the exit
And lock the gates
And everything around is hectic
And all of us make mistakes
Try to throw off direction
Barriers in our way
I got far too much invested
You gotta keep pace

No good reversing away
Been going to long to stop now
Thought I was against the grain
Startin' to see what I got now
No good reversing away
No good reversing away

We formed a band that we called The Herd
Unaware Peter Frampton had got it first
From upon comin' together to put in work
If we could subvert well  first
And we were lucky enough people listened
By the time the second album dropped we saw the mission
Fingers up against the powers that control the system
How did the math conquer with the long division
And who care about drugs when you seein' that addiction to power
Vinyard so beautiful, grapes so sour
Had our first run in with shock-jock coward
Pissin' off rednecks, couldn't be prouder
But the rich old white man still got the country on lock
In many ways nothing has changed
Finally the king died, only for the new guy
To end up being more of the same

And even if they block the exit
And lock the gates
And everything around is hectic
And all of us make mistakes
Try to throw off direction
Barriers in our way
I got far too much invested
You gotta keep pace

No good reversing away
Been going to long to stop now
Thought I was against the grain
Startin' to see what I got now
No good reversing away
No good reversing away

See Elefant Traks been goin' for a while now
Ain't lookin' like anything will die down
And I'm part of this industry right now
And until I put the mic down
I'll be able to cite them
Will I be another one of these white men
At the top, no idea about entitlement?
What I hated all the way back in the cypher when
Goin' indie I will always look like them  growin' up poor
Gave me what I need to open up these doors
I ain't even paused to reflect on the advantages I get
Yeah, the privilege that I can afford
All I know is tread carefully
Shut the fuck up, tread carefully
Intentions get misplaced
But you gotta keep pace

No good reversing away
Been going to long to stop now
Thought I was against the grain
Startin' to see what I got now
No good reversing away
Been going to long to stop now
Thought I was against the grain
Startin' to see what I got now
No good reversing away

No good reversing away
No good reversing away",https://genius.com/Urthboy-block-the-exit-lyrics
Your Thing,,2010,"To think that once upon a time I thought about suicide
I can make em miss me/ a cameo in history
Thought about the misery and the ripple out effect
I was out of order thankfully without a chord around my neck
I needed a net but more important s...elf respect
Walked through the valley of the shadow of death, then left
Never looked back well not much and as such
(Delta sample) “Come on down to the rut”/ Fuck that you see
You can’t swap what I’ve got for the status or the cash
Yo we’re putting where we’re from on the map
Cottage industry that came from the tracks
That may have never happened if I never came back
I would not know the Elefants, the Herd through to Horrorshow
Or heard about the horrors from Rwanda through to Kosovo
Now that may not make much sense but
If I weren’t alive I wouldn’t live to know what it meant
I’ve done gigs with the god himself
Paul Kelly I don’t need money that’s my wealth
Can’t Buy My Soul said Kev Carmody
Indie rock folk pop hip hop harmony
You must be kidding right ha! This is living right!
So make noise for yourself if you’re here tonight
Such is life, it is what it is
But for now let’s pretend we’re kids (Don’t waste Your Thing)
CHORUS
Sooner you get what’s staring you straight in the eyes
Fate gotta have faith (Don’t waste Your Thing)
All for the chase, all for the taste
Crack that code, lighten that load (Don’t waste Your Thing)
They all say go and we all get gone
Don’t matter where you’re from to belong (Don’t waste Your Thing)
Live for the reason, love what I am, what I do
And that’s something to believe in
To think that once upon a time I thought about suicide
I can make em miss me/ I can make em misty
I can make a misery to mimic what I met
When my head was out of order felt I oughta press eject
Wouldn’t have toured Zurich and other parts of Europe
We got fans like my man Tetsu in Japan
That makes me wanna dance and I don’t dance well
I get by but I’m bluffing as you all can tell
My lady loves the dancefloor a lot more
Still infatuated with her check my dropped jaw
Nothing like coming home to the bliss of the Mrs
The lifestyle we lead make it limited to visits
But I would never swap it for the riches of a king
Name whatever brother trust me not for anything
To think I’d never known of that love
(ATCQ sample) “Oh My God”/ someone got my back up above
To remember this, that’s why I write it down
To warm me up when I’m cold like an eiderdown
We’ll announce it to the night like lighters out
Glad to be with you to ride it out (Don’t waste Your Thing)
CHORUS
Sooner you get what’s staring you straight in the eyes
Fate gotta have faith (Don’t waste Your Thing)
All for the chase, all for the taste
Crack that code, lighten that load (Don’t waste Your Thing)
They all say go and we all get gone
Don’t matter where you’re from to belong (Don’t waste Your Thing)
Live for the reason, love what I am, what I do
And that’s something to believe in
3rd verse
I did not know what I could and could not do
Got to get going but I know that it ain’t click through
How could that be? I am not the sum of what I can forsee
I am not the one done playing poor me
You may believe I am out of my league
But I am not finished so how can I leave? (Don’t waste Your Thing)
Sooner you get what’s staring you straight in the eyes
Fate gotta have faith (Don’t waste Your Thing)
All for the chase, all for the taste
Crack that code, lighten that load (Don’t waste Your Thing)
They all say go and we all get gone
Don’t matter where you’re from to belong (Don’t waste Your Thing)
Live for the reason, love what I am, what I do
And that’s something to believe in",https://genius.com/Urthboy-your-thing-lyrics
Letters to Jamshed,,2010,"Fenced inside, I see sky
They call the camp 'Topside'
On an island named Nauru
Fenced inside, I see sky
They call the camp 'Topside'
On an island named Nauru
Please keep writing and send your picture
Best of luck and my best wishes
Lots of love, your friend Jamshed
I put this letter in an envelope
Wait and hope to hear back from you
Lots of love, your friend Jamshed
Do you mind if you and I we share the sky?
It made my day when your letter came
Thank you very much for choosing my name
Write another letter to me I'll be doing the same
My name's Jamshed Urfani
I'm an Afghani being detained
I'm twenty-one I come from a town called Saschishma
Three hours from Kabul in a pick-up
I am the oldest of six; my father helped me escape
I do not know about my family's fate
I like books and soccer and chess and
I'm in charge of the sports equipment
You tell me that you're going to marry your boyfriend
I'll pray for both of you and offer you my
Congratulations, thanks so much for still remembering me
You can let me dream. That's what every letter means
I've travelled alone across land and sea
Three years since I've seen my family, so
Please keep writing and send your picture
Best of luck and my best wishes
Lots of love, your friend Jamshed
I put this letter in an envelope
Wait and hope to hear back from you
Lots of love, your friend Jamshed
Do you mind if you and I we share the sky?
I'm tired of the bad news I don't want to read it
They gave us a TV but I don't want to watch it
Maybe I could die here is anyone watching?
They send another twenty home Australia don't want them
I received your last letter at the perfect time
And I am not radical but I know what's right
It made me happy when I had been on a hunger strike
Thanks for the CDs I like 'The Verve'
But more than anything Polly I like your words
Languages are something that I'm just loving to learn
Loving to learn, and U.N.H.C.R
Arrived to conduct their interviews
And that is how I met Marion Le
Now I'm hopeful of what lies ahead
My best wishes, much much love, your friend Jamshed
Please keep writing and send your picture
Best of luck and my best wishes
Lots of love, your friend Jamshed
I put this letter in an envelope
Wait and hope to hear back from you
Lots of love, your friend Jamshed
Do you mind if you and I we share the sky?",https://genius.com/Urthboy-letters-to-jamshed-lyrics
Get It Out Your System (300 Hours),,2015,"They go get it out your system to learn the lessons
You want that wisdom, go ahead, live that adolescence
 pistons, how they work your engine
Some swear that it's forbidden but still the rules should be bended, right?
Like what's that on the other side
What's being passed by the person on the right
Like what you're seeing twenty/twenty side
Either way what happened took me to this very point in time
Faded on , knowing I'm nine albums in
Tryna make somethin' different to all the shit surrounding me
None of this is guaranteed,  goes around again
What I've gotta do to get up, get on my bike again
Get up, get on the mic again, get up, get on a flight again
Get back inside ready to work but fuck it, too hard to find a pen
But I'm back in my writing den
Till I'm back in the light again and I'm not tryna hear when they say

Get it out your system, show me your resistance
Raining on your  and go, go
Get it out your system, that ain't on your list of
Things that we ever lettin' go

They say I'm wrong
And fuck it I might be
They say I'm wrong
But I do it the right way
]
 I was 
 make it out alive
 I was 
 do to make it out alive

They say go get it out your system
But man, I never listen
Maybe I couldn't hear
Cause the kush too loud,  pass the joint 
Baptism of fire
Chase the pay and chase desire
Choose one if you gotta but
If I said I didn't choose fun you'd be callin' me a liar
Think we're the best but we're still tryna be better men
That's why you catch us takin' notes around the elephants
Wide-eyed  a stage for the hermits
Definition 
So what you recon that all I do is get high?
Kiss fly girls and shit happens cause we patient
Nah, we masters of our 
Up all night cause we searchin' for inspiration

They say get it out your system, show me your resistance
Raining on your  and go, go
Get it out your system, that ain't on your list of
Things that we ever lettin' go

They say I'm wrong
And fuck it I might be
They say I'm wrong
But I do it the right way

I'm just lookin' for something new
I just do what I gotta do
True or not I'll be comin' through
And I'm fine so what up with you?
(They say I'm wrong) I'm just lookin' for something new
(And fuck it I might be) I just do what I gotta do
(They say I'm wrong) True or not I'll be comin' through
(But I do it the right way) And I'm fine so what up with you?

They say I'm wrong
And fuck it I might be
They say I'm wrong
But I do it the right way
They say I'm wrong
And fuck it I might be
They say I'm wrong
But I do it the right way, right way, right way",https://genius.com/Urthboy-get-it-out-your-system-300-hours-lyrics
