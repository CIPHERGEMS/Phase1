Cause An Effect,Cause An Effect,2009,"Throw your hands in the sky with me
Put ‘em up like a dirty cop told you to freeze
Now close your hands to a fist and squeeze
If you represent freedom, and you fight for peace

It’s the all out fall out, I’ll come if you call
Run with it quick, I’m fitted fit, more fit then’m all
More fitter than them busty booty milfs at the mall
Milk leaking out the tit, I pounce quick and I maul
Them baller cats need to sit back in the bench
N’fa’s the fresh breath amongst the virulent stench
The violence won’t end, I document with biro or pen
Blood leaking, while their freaking ‘cause my rhymes are immense
I climb over or dig under any fence they erect
Break it down to a wreck without breaking a sweat
Call collect, collect debts owed and cash the checks
Mic check to check mate without saying jack shit
I smash it, mash your wack smash hit
Major record exec’s flex prophylactics
Ready to bend you over ‘til your ass can’t ever be mended
That’s why N’fa stays independent
 (x2)

Get up, get up, man cause an effect
You know the rep, some say sleeps the cousin of death
But most folks sleep walk through life
Eyes wide shut blinded by the big city lights
Some like to take life ‘cause they don’t know the meaning
Like ‘em stick up kids, stressed out and fiending
With so many pressures, we’re all so precious
We’re all rock stars god bless us
I’m feeling the rush right now like when I’m up on stage
N’fa speaking loud ‘til the crowds in a rage
Pays a bonus, I got a bonus for her
Limbs gripping, sweat dripping all over her curves
And honey bunny don’t care for me money
That’s why your giving me money, the irony is kinda funny
Wheels squeal when the pigs fly by
And like the moons gravitational pull, N’fa’s here to change the tide
 (x2)

I represent those struggling to pay tax, struggling to eat
Amidst fat aristocrats we can’t make ends meet
I represent the lonely working, searching for more
Suffering at the bottom, I’m here to settle the score
I dead the phonies jerking off at the tip top
Trying to define, and make guide lines for hip hop
Its free form so to hell with conformers
I’m raw, I stand tall, check my live performance
I grab my balls and I spit on the floor
Throw a fist for freedom to shock all ya’ll
No 50/50. If you ain’t with me then fuck all ya’ll
If your with me let me hear you roar, come on now

Blessings,Cause An Effect,2009,"Verse 1
I’ve had so many close friends in my life time
God ble ssed me with friends of a life time
The light shines upon me, I swear
My friends show me the sphere when I declare that I’m trapped in a square
Now for real, some friends changed for worse
Some found jails cells, some found church through a church- rest in peace
Some changed forever, found peace
Found love, found worth, found who they wanted to be
Some friends will turn on each other and feud for so long
Ya worst enemy is the best friend that does you wrong
The same song continues looping over
Caught in a haze between drunk and being sober
Grown older but I’m still the same
They all look at me different, but its them who changed- I’m sure of it
And I’m sure I can’t be sure of a lot but I know
Is I intend to keep my life long friends close cos...
Chorus
We live in a world of dead ends...
Where people cut you off before ya journey begins
And its hard to listen in to the voices within
So I say it’s a blessing, yeah I say it’s a blessing if you can trust family and friends
-Count your blessings... You have your friends
Verse 2
Some of my best friends, have been my girlfriends
Current or Ex-friends I’ll love them til the world ends
The world spins like my mind on its axis
And no matter how hard we chase time, time will always catch us
Pain pricks like syringes
We dream big, til small failures make us lose interest
But fuck that, I get up and move
That’s like telling me to stop freedom fighting cos I got bruised
You better knock me the fuck out... Or at least concussed
Cos I’m a revolutionary and I won’t let up
No I won’ t give up my heart
Life’s a prac-test, we sit with no practice, trying to pass
Savoring the last drops of an empty flask
Like an alcoholic begging for some turps to grasp
Sunk deep into a hole that’s blacker than black
Absorbed by the loneliness aligned with that
I’m finding that bright light at the end
Discovering that the light I’m following is shone by my friends
-shone by them... They light the way for me, cos
Chorus
Outro
Shout outs- Styalz, Peril, and Kem. My bro Kabba. One love forever
Yes yes. All My Friends. Troy Hightower. We keep stepping right. We keep moving
One love. You have your friends",https://genius.com/Nfa-blessings-lyrics
Pemulwuy,Black + White Noise,2014,"Wake Up
You There?
Wake Up
Hmmm
I am forever unknown
You can never understand the truth of anything about me
No matter what is written as labels and stones or thoughts
From something only those above the clouds see
A brown tree was failed to form the bounty
Which brought those to the land that we know
The sad thing is that we expelled a native mind so great and fine that it could separate self from ego
Ego is the belief that we are more than the sky above or the land beneath our ever softened feet
So weak that we can barely speak or breathe without needing to believe that we can control everything we think we perceive
When reality be
That we be spinning out of control in a spiral
Lonely at the end of the vinyl 
It's now primal fear gone viral
Yet for survival we claim to false idols
Clutching glossy magazine, korans and bibles
Bibles taught never to tell that heaven and hell are not locations
But the inner realm of consciousness and true self relations
The contemplation listen to your outer thoughts as they talk shit in your ear
Try to separate yourself from the voice in you ear is far more clear
Only then will you realise that this fear is neither here nor even our conscious thought
Only then will it disappear along with the constant noise of the mind that we have not yet learned to lessen
Heaven and Hell are not destinations, nor freedom, nor prisons
It's clear from creation  man and earth have always been one, expanding and evolving
As we rocket towards the sun
So as the world changes and rearranges
We in turn turn with it the question is
Will we let go of our Ego and ascend the end?
Or will we simply burn in it?
Wake Up
Hey
Hey
Wake Up",https://genius.com/Nfa-pemulwuy-lyrics
Make Moves (The Get Up),Cause An Effect,2009,"Verse 1
There’s no contesting, I’ll crush your whole camp of actors
Like secrets, I’ll leak the air out ya mattress
The fact is, the black market on stock trade
In fashion. Still when we march, the cops raid
I’ll not fade or sway from my direction
Inflicting pain with my inner intention
My direction brings suspension
Like protesting students suspended beyond detention
Did I mention?.. We don’t break rules we shatter them
I puncture lungs, cut tongues to cut chitter chattering
I’m adamant, I don’t stop to breathe
I circulate like didgeree-doo’s played by aborigine’s
Original seed, native red dust
That you’ll be forced to bite if you’re breaking our trust
We creating a thrust like hot lovers at dusk
I adapt to any point like universal plugs because...
Chorus
I won’t be set up, its time to get up. Make moves, lift ya heavy head up
I won’t be set up, its time to get up. Make moves, make moves
I won’t be set up, its time to get up. Make moves, lift ya heavy head up
I won’t be set up, its time to get up. Yeah you know we get down
Verse 2
I’m a soul shocker, warrior dance like Hakka
Call me papa, N’fa means father
It might worry your man how N’fa fight like Shaka-
Zulu- nationwide enterprise from down under
Yeah, I’m Mandingo/Creole
Mixed blood brother- Oz meets Sierra Leone
I’ll bury the bone, and while ya dogs sniffing it out
I’m on the peace pipe with my peeps, spliffing it out
You got a clip then you better empty that shit out
I bring peace, but I’ll put your piece back in you mouth
You pussy gun talk M.C’s don’t impress me
The only time most of ya’ll see a shel l is down at the beach
I’m down to impeach ya love like an ex
I’m vexed I see poverty and stress world wide, east west
South north. It’s a foul force. If we don’t rise as force
Then we’re just whore’s, waiting in all fours
Chorus
Verse 3
It’s a universal thing from hopeless goon scullers 
To Verve toasters, who’s crystal cups cling
To grown folk trying to get their pockets to ching
To adolescent adults who sulk, crying for bling
Arrested for assult, adding salt to their wounds
Like junkie mums to be, getting kicked in the womb
With pit-bull lock, bad lick be gripping to you
Too concerned with yaself you don’t listen to crew
Like family mean nothing when family mean everything
More than work, church, boats, cars, or heavy rings
I know it hurt when you gotta let go
Its universal- like my diabolical flow
I know some heavy hitters, who don’t care for the love
They never see god, cos they’re never looking above
Too busy looking over they’re shoulder
The hatred will fold ya soldier. I’m here to hold ya, I told ya....

Bali Party,,2012,"[Hook: Drapht]
We party, party, party, we party Bali style
With girls that shake their body, like we in Carnival
We party, party, party
Another hot night
In another world, with another girl who takes it off like

[Verse 1: Drapht]
What up, what up, just jumped off a plane to a place
So hot, but can watch the rain washing away the weight
It's sort of like watching the way Heather Graham skates
If you're saving yourself for the marriage, not a good idea, don't come here
A day in the sun and one beer
Girls running around in their underwear
Wear what you want to, whenever
Never a bouncer to tell you to wear that collar, or leather shoes
And I never, do and never will I ever
Be changing my get up for you, or you, or you
Won't change just to wait up in a long a** line
You, you, I ain't changing for you
Let me try one more time
Where the f** you at?

[N'fa]
Man I don't know where I'm at
Them girls ran off with my sombrero hat
And I don't care about that, she be bringing it back
I'm No Fixed Abode all across the map
Go with the flow like soda splashing
Full moon high, we get to dancing
Make virgins fly like Mr. Branson
Party on the beach, soiree in a mansion

[Hook]
We party, party, party, we party Bali style
With girls that shake their body, like we in Carnival
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/nfa/-/bali-party.html]
We party, party, party
Another hot night
In another world, with another girl who takes it off like

[Verse 2: Drapht]
What up, what up, clap to the beat
And the girls gotta move them feet
What up, what up, clap to the beat
And the guys you can grab your drink I ain't gon' get mad

[N'fa]
Yeah come on move it around
If you like that clap right now
Yeah I said move it around
And if you like that clap right now, break it down
See I don't sip draught
But me and Drapht be chilling at the bar
With a senorita with the fattest a**

[Drapht]
Yeah I'd like to sink my set of Dracula's into that
Coming out swinging, but I gotta bring a little bit of Jimmy back
Cause she ain't gonna give me a chance
When my best move on the D-floor is the sprinkler dance
It was summer alive
[Hook]
We party, party, party, we party Bali style
With girls that shake their body, like we in Carnival
We party, party, party
Another hot night
In another world, with another girl who takes it off like
We party, party, party, we party Bali style
With girls that shake their body, like we in Carnival
We party, party, party
Another hot night
In another world, with another girl who takes it off like",https://lyrics.az/nfa/-/bali-party.html
Hope You Don't Mind,,2012,"I'm a get on my sorta emo shit on this one, gonna vent a little,
I hope you don't mind.
Yeah, listen.

I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don't is like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?

See I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don't is like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?

I wish I had a time machine
To change the way that my mind perceives everythin' my eyes have seen
And make me look at life through a wider screen
It ain't what you might believe's happenin' behind the scenes
I treat the beat like an X-ray
Press play looking inside
The best way to express pain
Fucking up is becomin' somethin' I'm used to
Cause sometimes to find yourself you gotta lose you
To those listenin' sorry for bein' emo
But fuck what the doctor says
This is what I need though
Yeah, and so I'm walkin' into that cloud
Where it has to hurt just to bring you back down

Almost became addicted to the painkillers
Cause without that feelin' yo the pain's killer
You'd think having a near death experience'd
Make a smart person take their life more serious
From nearly diein' to feelin' so enlightened
To nearly cryin' and feelin' only frightened
Releasin' this is hard yo it fuckin' hurts a bit
It's the only way I know how to come to terms with it
And this is Matt here I'm givin' you the real me
I just hope that you can feel me
And I know you're probably thinkin' I should keep it to myself
But I can't yo I need it cause it helps

I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don't is like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?

So I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don't is like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?

And with the partyin' I think I need to settle down
To be real I'm gettin' a little messy now
A few drinks and I'm stressin' out in another state
Looking for my mum to come and get me out
I've got no idea when I'm coming home
And all I want is to be left the fuck alone
I'm only being real the depression comes and goes
Ignore it cause tonight there is yet another show

Looking in the mirror like what the fuck am I starin' at?
Not recognizin' the brittle mess that is staring back
So I'm givin' you the deepest shit you ever hear
So if you've got time for Matthew then lend an ear
I'm just hopin' that I've said it clear
If I stay on this path the end for 360 is gettin' near
I know you're thinkin' I should keep it to myself
But I can't yo I need it cause it helps

I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don't is like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?

So I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don't is like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?

I see my mates like my brothers yo
I hardly see 'em anymore
The last time was a month ago
They either workin' or gettin' in relationships
I should do that too but yo I hate this shit
Don't get me wrong yo I love women
With what I see though it makes it hard for me to put my trust in 'em
All it takes is one person to fail you
And then you feel like majority will fail too
My insecurities will swallow me whole
And when they arise yo I'm not in control
They watchin' every move and they move with me
Like ""Look at that dude 60, that motherfucker's too skinny.""

I can handle friends tellin' me I'm underweight
But from a stranger it's somethin' that I fuckin' hate
I know you're unaware that shit's a low blow
But you feel the need to tell me like you think I don't know?
No, that's rude, find a bridge and jump off
And if I tell you to fuck off then fuck off
That's not bein' immature about it
That's me admittin' I'm insecure about it
And yo I'm sorry if I'm seemin' insane
But I wrote this while I was at the peak of the pain
But now it's got me thinkin' I should keep it to myself
But I can't yo I need it cause it helps

I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don't is like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?

So I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don't is like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?",http://www.songlyrics.com/360-feat-nfa/hope-you-don-t-mind-feat-n-fa-lyrics/
