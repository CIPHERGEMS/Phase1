Still HSV,,2011,"Fucken' yeah you shoulda seen the cunt
You shoulda seen how far he was going sideways for
Look, no shit, you fucken' you wouldn't believe it like
You think I'm bullshitting like I know I'm from fucken from the northern suburbs
But I'm not fucken' bullshitting
Look the cunt was sideways like you wouldn't fucken' believe
What a fucken crazy cunt like fucken' shoulda seen it

So I'm riding in a VL with two subbies, stereotype
With a huge intercooler, doin' it right
You might be like ""I'm confused, whats the attraction?""
But some dudes just love to lose traction
That cruise action, Saturday night
You could do it at the lights
Or get in a fight, right
You heard the systems bumpin' rap
Saying ""I'll drag you with two cunts in the back""
Something to that, running flat elevens in a street car
Outrunnin' two dudes in a police car
Sideways and if yo shit don't roll you better
Hope you don't hit no pole
Better, my man flipped the dole sole a few years back
And now we can't get that few years back
Cause that ain't always the case in his advantage
In his case its like, brain damage
So if you manage to get home fine
You'll probably get a fine
From the Bracks goldmine
Cause the road sign went from hundred to eighty
Now they got the whole state drivin' like ol' ladies
Shit's all crazy, state coppers are starvin'
So the cops on yo ass
Run reds like Stalin
They startin' to cash in hip pockets where they stay
Till they leave yo ass out like drift kings
Representin' petrol heads all across the world (STILL)
Out the back with the promo girls (STILL)
Doin' laps in the same damn streets
Still outrunnin' police (IN THE HSV)

Yeah fucken' oath fucken' oath
Hey he might be a fucken' rapper rapper cunt
But I'm tellin' ya
He knows, He fucken knows
Listen to him
What do they call you cunt
Fucken' Easy, Easy fucken' this cunt
You know alright?
Everyone whos been on the fucken' western roadway
You know they fucken' change the speed signs
Fucken' you know what they want you to do
They want you to lose your license
They're out to get us
We're endangered species
Endangered fucken' species
You know, fucken'...
The Bracks government has a consperiecy out against us
You know, so I think we should all unite, unite and say fuck these cunts
You know, I dont care if your from fucken' North Point Shopping centre
Or fuken' Oakley
I dont care if your fucken' used to hang out at the bus stop at shoppo
And now you fucken' do demos on the roof of the carpark
I dont give a fuck, you know who you are
We need some, uhhh solidarity
Fucken' that's all
Get there, get out there
And support your local fucken' car club alright?
I'll see you down at Calder, alright
Fucken' oath, you know who I am
You seen me, you seen the VL
You seen the canary yellow
You know alright? Alright
So when you see me
Say you know
Fucken' SCARNON!",https://genius.com/Weapon-x-still-hsv-lyrics
