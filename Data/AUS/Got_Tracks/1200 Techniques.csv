Karma,Choose One,2002,"Karma
What goes around comes around right? (Right)
How you treat people is how they treat you back
Disrespect them or knock them
They're gonna slap you back (Yeah)
Sometimes it hurts and that's
Bad karma, watch out for it

How am I supposed to live
In a world full of negatives?
How am I supposed to love
In a world full of push and shove?
How am I supposed to breathe
In a world full of lust and greed?
Well, I guess I'll have to live day to day
And pray to God that'll I'll be okay-ay-ay

These fat rats think they fit like they the Iron Man
I got the iron tongue and the iron hand, I'll make the final stand
The final showdowns come round and hit ya
As I throw down my gauntlet to switch the picture
If ya look in the mirror, you're bound to get a reflection
Like with 
every action, there is a reaction
With your dodgy actions, you're causing negative drama
And if you know God's law, you best watch for karma
Now I'ma bomb ya, running your traps like tacks
You think you're floating on the cream, you and your rat pack
Well I'm take that, thought back, now let's dwell
How I should lock you like jail cells so we can exhale
I'm a bull 
and you's a matador
, I'm seeing red
, 
you outta sorts
I'm a target like 
darts boards
, you floating in space like astronauts
I started off last but now I'm first
While you're shaking, I cut off like umbilicals at birth

How am I supposed to live
In a world full of negatives?
How am I supposed to love
In a world full of push and shove?
How am I supposed to breathe
In a world full of lust and greed?
Well, I guess I'll have to live day to day
And pray to God that'll I'll be okay-ay-ay

I look around the city and it's all such a pity
Everybody trying to be pretty, don't care for nitty gritty
I look around the block, nobody's playing hopscotch
They're to busy on the internet surfing that rock
Just converse kind of rude, like
""So what you trying to prove, mate?""
I say, ""Nothing, I'm just tryna build the feeling, not live like you""
I got plans to take this city up to Senate
As life's one big race and I want all entries to win it
If you're not with it like quitters, then get out of my face
You got no place in my grace with your grimace
You're a disgrace with a sire, you need to recon through your fire
And look higher, higher! (Look around)
I got sounds that help you get down, so you can get up
And avoid them stinking rats that get me fed up
Yeah, they make me wanna throw up, they gotta grow up
Or they'll be feeling abandoned while I'll be sailing like Noah

How am I supposed to live
In a world full of negatives?
How am I supposed to love
In a world full of push and shove?
How am I supposed to breathe
In a world full of lust and greed?
Well, I guess I'll have to live day to day
And pray to God that'll I'll be okay-ay-ay

Melbourne
Sydney
To Brisbane
And Darwin
To Perth
Adelaide
Tassie
And all across the O-Z-Z-I-E

Picture I'm the boulder, it's time to roll
I will continue like part two with no to and fro
Aiming at infinity, start a nasty road
Had to leave the poor luck souls before they fall, so
I got the key to the door and I'm searching for the keyhole
And I unlock the door, I bring new love to my people
Unlike these fickle fanatics that wanna cause death
Cut hopes late, praying we fall to hell's depth
As I watch and see all our progress regress
As what goes up comes down, nevertheless
We stung by the horror, cold hearts with armour
Boomerang effect as we all face our karma

How am I supposed to live
In a world full of negatives?
How am I supposed to love
In a world full of push and shove?
How am I supposed to breathe
In a world full of lust and greed?
Well, I guess I'll have to live day to day
And pray to God that'll I'll be okay-ay-ay",https://genius.com/1200-techniques-karma-lyrics
Where Ur At?,Consistency Theory,2004,"Nfamous - step, step, step, step, step, step, step up!

Caught between a rock and a hard place
Nfamous, 
rock the mike and fill up the bar space
A car chase couldn't match the adrenaline, that we're sending them
And haters who talk shit, me not befriending them
Me not defending them, too busy ascending them
They lacks in like albinos lack melanin
Ventolin, couldn't help them catch their breath
I got bored waiting for them so I soared ahead
Now each tread is made, on pavement we laid
To reach the next stage, the pavement is grey
But hey! We're not in it for the checks
We do it for the love, respect
The cause and the effects we get from
Fatter beats, fatter rips, fatter matter of subject
To free your mind state, man there's nothing above that
Now wind the clock back, when it came to urban music, radio and then rock that
But now they're playing local hip-hop acts, it's even on the tellie
Coast to coast, it's got to grow steady so I'm ready
To boast the most or get spiritual hope
Cause hip-hop's a mind state, not an area code

From the north, to the south, to the east, to the west
Come on everybody, go off, a go off
I said it's not where you're from, it's where you're at
1200 put the boogie in your body bag

Lyrics are my language, my ink stains canvas
I study syntax in my world map atlas
Looking up foreign cities and towns
New borders we got to cross to rock these crowds til they're
Bouncing to the rhythm we delivering
Announcing it god given like everything
Blast the pop critics who think we're pretending
When we give our heart to the art, spill it now he no billing
Peril: Yeah we gave blood for them!
Oh yeah, you know it man
And after the show, we stay around and say hello to them
Meeting new peeps that we never met before
Crowds that once stared now cheer for more
We've been booed at hits, we've been swooned and kissed
We've copped it all, we're not new to this
The future is, unknown but we've got to grow
Cause hip-hop's a mind state, not an area code

From the north, to the south, to the east, to the west
Come on everybody, go off, a go off
I said it's not where you're from, it's where you're at
1200 put the boogie in your body bag

Hey all around the world there are people like me
Loving hip-hop renegades and sanity
From Aotearoa to Iceland to Ecuador
Aboriginal, Japanese, German, French, what's more?
Nations at a battle, separated by a war
Their kids connect over friendly battles on the floor
No money to go out we're staying indoors
Trynna build a fat beat like you've never heard before
Constructing rhymes to bust the mind, oh!
In destructive times we're got to find goals
1200 Techniques started with nothing at all
Now we're onto LP number 2, on tour
The evidence is when the youth of New York
Created different elements and they travelled abroad
All the way to Aus, touching our souls, it shows
Hip-hop's a mind state not an area code

From the north, to the south, to the east, to the west
Come on everybody, go off, a go off
I said it's not where you're from, it's where you're at
1200 put the boogie in your body bag

Clap your hands everybody
And everybody just clap your hands
Australia, clap your hands
South Pacific, clap your hands
Europe and Asia, clap your hands
And plus the Americas, clap your hands
Middle East and Africa, clap your hands
Well Ryde, clap your hands
Ahahaha",https://genius.com/1200-techniques-where-ur-at-lyrics
Eye of the Storm,Consistency Theory,2004,"*scratching* ""times running out""
*scratching* ""got to decide now""
*scratching* ""but something inside won't let me quit""

People are so fickle
These days its so despicable
Like tentacles, they all try stick to you
Hold you down if they can or besicken you
They try to blind you with they aim too
Enforcin written jurasdictions that we all got to stick to
The laws disappear and reappear to suit their needs
Which to me is a joke, like short term peace treaties
I see disease, swarmin like bees
Stingin these undeveloped war torn countries
Apparently I'm on the good side, but this worlds so shaky at times
I swear this planets on an intergalactic fault line
Every time I race I can't win
I keep pace till these land mines blow up in my face again
Dismembered, I still gotta keep pacing on
Treading strong, facing the eye of the storm

These days, replay, the life game of wrong
These days, what we say, can do such harm
I replay, each day, like an endless song
Billing through my mind non stop
Like the hands of ti-i-i-iiime

Whats with this financial envy
We got so much poverty but we keep spending
We're like pigs they just won't stop eating
Till they hit the bottom of the trough
And thier guts leaking ,im seeking the truth, but
How can it be, we're in a world of broken familys
And fallacies, taught to praise stars and seek fame
Do what we must to obtain monetery gain
And even im with it, but there are limits
Whatever happened to a conscious idea, emcees talk verbal diarheoua
Caught up with gun talk and bling-bling
Hip-hop producers, who work with pop singers
For ching-ching, im thinking
A rich soul, is now of no value
Light turns to dark when cold breath hits the candle
I'm here to rekindle your spirit
Keep the flame burning strong
As we press on, through the eye of the storm


The clock ticks, your name off the list
Life moves quick so we gotta move quicker
The world's devilish, makin me sicker
I smell the remanents, of drugs sex and liqour
The kids are, immune to these
Cos they leave, they get a fix on they new tv
Parents dont need to talk to their kids no more
They feed em videos, show em the internet
Log on to the porn site, here we go
Television, the drug of a nation
Breeding ignorance, feeding radiation
Frenzhal hit the nail on the head
Wish we were sailing ahead
But we're shipwrecked and failing instead
But the tests have changed, we're all passin
So long as your a expert in arson
I'm askin, which ways up, cos my compass has gone
You know what? I'm a let my beatin heart be my guide through the eye of the
Storm

*scratching* Nfamas ""how am i supposed to live in a world filled with
Negatives?""
*scratching* Nfamas ""the final showdowns come round to hit ya""",https://genius.com/1200-techniques-eye-of-the-storm-lyrics
Fork in the Road,Consistency Theory,2004,"Yeah

You and me got to be
Living life, dignity, integrity, sincerity
Cause honestly thats how its got to be
And when you come to that fork in the road
Which way will you go

Got get your destiny
Yeah thats what my god advised
Dont be resistently
Seek someone to help us grow wise
Cause mentally, spirtual excellence
Is far beyond any Physical (?)
Acceptance is great, yeah
But it will be a brittle case
Trying to please all
And find a middle space
Where you belong
As a little kid I dreamt intense dreams
Now as a grown man, these same intense dreams
Are what I'm chasing
Feel a man amazing, right
But I can't see how my life
May have fallen by the waist side
Scenario one
Hanging with mates who like to stay high
Fucking up, going out, acting up, getting drunk
Chucking up, acting tough, far too much got me copping upper cuts
While though they keep me snacked up
Killing my soul while I'm high
Head to toe
But I'm only talking about a possible scenario

You and me got to be
Living life, dignity, integrity, sencerity
Cause honestly thats how its got to be
And when you come to that fork in the road
Which way will you go

Scenario two
What would I do
Not amused
Sitution I'm facing
Got me confused
Back to me and my girl in high school
Both 16 years of age
Doing what lovers do
Confusing independance with ignorance
Having unprotected sex
Now she falling pregnant
Now we stressing bout how our parents going to act
Will they kick us out of the house
Or will they have our backs
To bring a child into this messy world
Could be no more going out
No money for me or my gal
Scenario Three
We get rid of the child
Before we get to hear it laugh
Or see a smile
Live with the grief and keep the pain underneath
Like six feet deep may it rest in peace
Whats to become of us
God only knows
But you know
I'm only talking bout a possible scenario

You and me got to be
Living life, dignity, integrity, sencerity
Cause honestly thats how its got to be
And when you come to that fork in the road
Which way will you go
Life moves on. life flys by
Life talking flash back
At the blink of an eye
You and I had best be aware
You and I had best be prepared

The future said
That only a believedant man
Can live a full life and
Draw accurate plans
To understand
Why I choose scenario four
That be the life I'm living now
The life I'd die for
Maybe I might score the top of the list
Maybe I might fall but I'm ready for this
Like being offered bullshit
This steams the cream
A million dollars for my soul
Or a priceless dream

Faith is a Red Rose, is a red rose
Almost a thought
But it will grow

You and me got to be
Living life, dignity, integrity, sincerity
Cause honestly thats how its got to be
And when you come to that fork in the road
Which way will you go",https://genius.com/1200-techniques-fork-in-the-road-lyrics
NOBODY’S FOOL,,2004,"fall back, take a look at me and you’ll see
i’m for real, i’ll feel what only i can feel
and if that don’t apeal to ya let me know
and i’ll go cause i flow better when my colours show
and that’s the was it has to be, honestly
cause creativity could never bloom in my room
i’d throw it all away before i’d lie, so don’t call me with a compromise
hang up the phone, i got a backbone stronger than yours

lalala ….. yeah
[chorus]
if you trying to turn me into someone else it’s easy to see
i’m not down with that i’m n-body’s fool
if you trying to turn something else
i’ve seen it enough and i’m over that
i’m n-body’s fool

if you wanna bring me down…. go ahead and try!

[verse 2]
don’t think you know me like you know yourself
but i fear that you’re telling me what you want to hear
do you give a d-mn understand that i can’t be not what i am
i’m not the milk and cherios in your spoon it’s not a simple
here we go not so soon
i might have fallen for that when i was 14 and a little more green
but amazing what a coupe of years mean

la la la….. oh… yeah

[chorus]

[verse 3]
so go ahead and try to look me in the eye
go ahead and try to look me in the eye
but you’ll never see inside
until you realize……
things are trying to settle down
just trying to figure out
exactly what i’m about
if it’s with or without you
i don’t need your doubt in me
