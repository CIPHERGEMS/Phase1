You Sleep Out Here,Against All Odds (artist: Devious),2014,"You sleep out here sleep out here
Can't be sleep out here
Mark of the beast out here they feast out here
Ain't  no peace out here
You sleep out here sleep out here
Can't be sleep out here
Can't show no teeth out here teeth here
Mark of the beast out here
Verse 1(Devious)
Land of the free how can we sleep
What are we doing?
Stand up for me hand up for me what ya pursuing?
Death or it's life life or it's death
Ashes to ashes or take your first breath
Take you a right or take you a left
But never just chill with the cousin of death
How could you judge how do you know what is the premise
They kill in the hood but livin is good
Look at our prisons
And dreams are deferred when life is a blur but mind ya own bizness
And god has the gavel and god is the jury who is the witness
Through peril and famine our teens carry hammers and go to the slammer
No thought of regret or presence of mind and nothing's examined
They pay it no mind they see but they blind they narcoleptics
But how could you sleep and never consider who's really affected? Who Knows
Chorus
You sleep out here sleep out here
Can't be sleep out here
Mark of the beast out here
Ain't  no peace out here
You sleep out here sleep out here
Can't be sleep out here can't  show no teeth out here
Mark of the beast out here
Verse 2 (Kevin Gates)
Psychoanalysis which I performed on myself
What that is? Alarming myself
Seeking help from the higher power divine knowledge can't call on myself (Oh Lord!)
Thought that I may have encountered my happiness
Only in that I made it hard on myself
Spirit willing when the flesh weak
Profit of god in the makin
In the mirror I see it my left eye is evil
I'm beautiful, Lucifer, Satan
In the kitchen we cookin no apron
Providing the poison who willing to take it (it's raw)
Selling they soul like when we sellin gold
Only led to a cell and me layin alone
My plug on the line my delivery comin
I'm tormented lord just deliver me from it (Get on the ground!)
Jumpin up outta my sleep to get money or could I be rushing to an early death (Blat!)
Ran in the streets lotta ignorant hustlin
Guns go to bussin they'll burn ya chest (ew!)
On my knees in the hospital another chance and I'm back in it
Lied to God in jail again said I was quittin but I'm back with it
Chorus
You sleep out here sleep out here
Can't be sleep out here
Mark of the beast out here
Ain't  no peace out here
You sleep out here sleep out here
Can't be sleep out here
Can't show no teeth out here
Mark of the beast out here
Verse 3 (Devious)
Tossin and turnin twistin and burnin what are you learning
Who to believe are u deceived
What are you earnin
What's if it's right what's if wrong
Turn on ya phone check out this song
Should you rebel or should you condone who got the answer to carry us home
That's deep huh like Plato, that's devious and gates yo
No sleep huh just wake bro that's confidence or that's faith yo
All in the mind all in the brain who can protect it
Keepin you in or keepin you out now what is neglected
The prince of our peace r the mark of the beast
Should we go west or should we go east
Free from it all or tied  on a leash
Whatever the answer we never gon sleep
----we meditate, we all wanna go inside heaven gates
Compliments of Devious, courtesy of Kevin Gates

Chorus
You sleep out here sleep out here
Can't be sleep out here
Mark of the beast out here
Ain't  no peace out here
You sleep out here sleep out here
Can't be sleep out here
Can't show no teeth out here

Welcome To The Birthplace,,2013,"This is New Orleans. The crescent city. Paris of America
It's squashed in the middle of the Mississippi mud with
The levies of the 19th century mist on one side the dykes
Of modern Industrialism on the other. And the old
French Quarter, bright eyed and exciting automating the
Cities beginning. Tourists still gasp at its enchanting courtyards...

Welcome to the birthplace NOLA is the first place
Where every day we party non-stop like it's your birthday
More than the murder rate, Southern hospitality
Katrina was a lifestyle we lived in actuality
Meet me on Bourbon Street stop and get a daiquiri
And take it to the Calliope, the domicile the Master P
Grubbin' by the Manchu , hangin' on the Riverview
Ridin' on the streetcar coolin' at the House of Blues
Dancin' at the Zulu Ball chillin' by the Port of Call
You can see the Indians and brass bands going off
We can hit St. Claude get a Gene's PO-boy
And every single night somebody gotta show boy

We get to showin' out, get-get to showin' out
We get to showin' out, get-get to showin' out
(Groove City, Groove City, Groove City)

Yeah they got a place where everybody go
You already know it's Groove City N-O
Mardi Gras mambo craw fish gumbo
Take it to the 9th ward, Hollygrove or Congo
The land of the Who Dat the city of the breeze
Where the ladies love to bounce and the fellas stackin' G's
Mondays never blue we eating rice and red beans
Anywhere you go you can taste the cuisine
Chillin' on the lake barbecuing on the grill
Deep in the Superdome aka the battlefield
From the 3rd Ward to 17
Eastbank to West
My city is unique
New Orleans is the best",https://genius.com/Devious-welcome-to-the-birthplace-lyrics
Take The Pain Away,,2015,"Verse (Devious)
We gon hit the mall cop brand new everything
Livin in the moment take a trip away from the pain
Sunny outside we might as well make it rain
For all the hardwork and good times in the game
Hair hang it low while you spending the dough
If you Feel a lil needy gon spend you some mo
Got a diamond on your finger and one on your toe
Late nights in Jamaica dance slow on the  flow

Fly High King,Fly High King,2017,"Fly High King by Devious
(Verse One)
When it comes to my brother imma spit through your speaker
That's the heart of a warrior that's my goon and  my keeper
That's my first so it's major who can't Hear me or feel me
That's a language unspoken yo that's a reason to kill me
Cause my bloodline my guidance; you know that I miss him
All his homies still ridin', they was there standing with him
Do this one for my mother for my sisters and cousins
For my family's pain cause it flow through our veins
But the heavens are smiling though; it's lonely at Christmas
All your kings and your queens they still be postin your pictures
We had nickels and quarters, we went to chasing them millions
They can hear what I'm saying but they can't see what I'm feeling
And they can never be another you
My brother Country is a legend, dog I love that dude
So Imma keep your spirit living strong
It's no more pain but still we hurt because your body gone
(Body gone  body gone)
(Chorus)
Man we traveled the states shrimp and steak on the plate
Hollygrove to Hollywood my destiny to be great
Fly High King you got your wings now you Smilin
Fly High King and if its beef then we riding
Man we traveled the states shrimp and steak on the plate
Hollygrove to Hollywood my destiny to be great
Fly High King you got your wings now you Smilin
Fly High King and if its beef then we riding
(Verse Two)
See we been through it all, we surviving these streets
From 86 on the block; up in the lab on these beats
I'm the day; you the night, still we one in the same
And you taught me the game on how to handle these lames
We used to ride out to Texas letting nothing affect us
And When the devil tried to kill us; only God could protect us
But your heart made a gold, and you stayed with your fam
Never holding on to grudges but you know how I am
I ain't taking no woodens; Imma make em respect it
When them boys tried to jump me; you were there acting reckless
That's the badge of a brother and you know that you wore it
Even when we would argue but still the love you would show it
And they can never be another you
My brother Country is a legend dog I love that dude
So imma keep your spirit living strong
It's no more pain but still we hurt because your body gone
(Chorus)
Man we traveled the states shrimp and steak on the plate
Hollygrove to Hollywood my destiny to be great
Fly High King you got your wings now you Smilin
Fly High King and if its beef then we riding
Man we traveled the states shrimp and steak on the plate
Hollygrove to Hollywood my destiny to be great
Fly High King you got your wings now you Smilin
Fly High King and if its beef then we riding",https://genius.com/Devious-fly-high-king-lyrics
This Life That I Lead,,2015,"(Chorus)
This
 life that I lead, that I lead, that I lead, that I lead kinda hard to believe
This life that I lead, that I lead, that I lead, that I lead got some scars you can see
(Verse One)
Try to hide that 
feel
 but the heart pumps real
Took em off my sleeves but they still wouldn't leave
So I get it now I'm frigid you can call that freeze
But my mind on ease and I chase that cheese
But I'm down on earth and I found my worth
Been a passionate soul since my mom gave birth
Good times came last bad times came first
If you walked my shoes you could talk my blues
But I stayed in tune battled with my wounds
Had a smile at 6 had a frown by noon
But I still can't lose I will always win
I was hurt by 5, back on the grind by ten
(Chorus)
This life that I lead, that I lead, that I lead, that I lead kinda hard to believe
This life that I lead, that I lead, that I lead, that I lead got some scars you can see
(Verse Two)
Some will call that luck, but it was destiny's child
Now I'm all grown up I been here for a while
Yeah I paid my dues, I'm in the black with the rap
Spent a whole lotta time to hit the map with the rap
Yeah I sacrificed love that's a heavy price
Just to get it out the mud, missed the married life
Wasn't travelin outta town or seeing baby showers
Just a blessed songwriter working navy hours
Never cast your pearls because of images
Or be mad at the world and seeking vengeances
Have a plan b and c to start up businesses
And every book ever written was only sentences
(Chorus)
This life that I lead, that I lead, that I lead, that I lead kinda hard to believe
This life that I lead, that I lead, that I lead, that I lead got some scars you can see",https://genius.com/Devious-this-life-that-i-lead-lyrics

Coffee House,,2018,"Coffee House feat Fiend
Bridge (Devious)
Is it Latte or coffee
Machiatto or iced tea
Just pour it up in my cup for me
Freshly brewed is the wave and the mood B
Verse One (Devious)
Push the button on the whip to start up
All I need is sunshine and Starbucks
Sadday mornings windows down to feel the breeze
Switching lanes on my way to Magazine
Cop a caramel drizzle, have a seat
Surf the internet a while, then I'll leave
My ambition stimulated feeling free
Now a Cuban cigar is all I need
Then I saw her out the corner of my eye
Call her mocha she was ebony and fly
Could hear the beauty in her voice passing by
She caught me looking and politely told me hi
At the coffee house
Chorus (Fiend)
It's that wake up wake up wake up won't you wake up
I hope your morning be good as a cup of coffee
(wake up wake up wake up)
That's what she said softly
She told me wake up wake up wake up baby  wake up
I hope your morning be good as a cup of coffee
(wake up wake up wake up)
That's what she said softly

Is it Latte or coffee
Machiatto or iced tea
Just pour it up in my cup for me
Freshly brewed is the wave and the mood B
Verse Two (Fiend)
Morning espresso, help me shine like my bezel
Staying focused, keep both of my pockets without the echoes
Bow ties, sport jackets, and retro
Yo, toasted croissant I'm in effect mode
Drive through a dine-in, it all depends on the shedual
Sometimes I get good vibes when I  ride so I  let it flow
Up before the roosters and hens let me begin
Cool as dewdrops on leaves from oil vapin
Meetings and emails go together like large bodies
Of water and seashells
And women let tea spill
My name Jones and everything we could talk about
But not on social media fam, meet me at the coffee house
Chorus (Fiend)
It's  that wake up wake up wake up won't you wake up
I hope your morning be good as a cup of coffee

I want you for myself
You can't have no one else
I want you for myself
You can't have no one else

[Verse 1: Dubee]
See I'm a cold polecat
I hope she know that
sh**ty off the titty and dope as Prozac
Spit the anthrax, leave a dick in your brain
Believe ain't no cuffing me mayne, f** dame
Trying to put her hooks in me, I go Bo Billy
Wanna get with me, let her dough get with me
Keep the beat heads crispy, ducking it up
I do the bird then I'm f**ing it up
b**h what the f** is you hollerin'
b**h check your noggin
Pull out the pecker then peck at your noggin
Sug don't go for that
Check the skully with the cutty of dosha sacks
Forty racks

[Verse 2: Devious]
I'm not the average dude although I'm digging you
I can't be tied down now I deal in ho's and brew
Money is all I need, a backwood and a bag of trees
P-I-M-P is me your wildest dreams between the sheets
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/devious/-/4-myself.html]

 

I got to have my dough, like you don't know what I'm here fo'

 

You got to break mines off, I'll do you when I'm with you
On [?] and [?] we'll do the thing and I'll show off
I can't be locked down now, that's not how I get down

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
The b**h is fatal
Plus she play all day like cable
I'm a pimp baby, I run a stable
I got H-O E-S's
High heels and cold gear is how she dresses
Too skrilla and I'm a true playa
You looking for a cuddle up, a Poo Bear
I need a b**h that's gonna move some work
Do some dirt, she can't then I'm not goosing her
I'm using her for her cards and her credit
She's breaded, super unleaded
Super saucy, super what you not
She need a man that not tripping off what you got
Too much meezy for one beezy
Plus, I like my nachos cheesy
That one on one sh**, I can't go for that
I'm laid up with three b**hes smoking fat

Yeah, I'm in a all black khaki suit
In an all black room feeling like I'm in the back of the room
And I'm strapped to something that's like, out of a movie, That's cool. k** like I'm in a Dracula movie
That's too practical, did a tactical movement
Next thing you know I was loose and I was moving
Brotha Lynch Hung go through the jungle, wit' a machete and I hunt those, then I cut throat
I don't know what's happening maybe I'm blacking out
k**ing everybody in sight then smashing out
Murder date n***a go head ask 'em out
Coathanga Strangla n***a ask about him
Like J-Lo.... Oh a** is out
Anybody will tell ya' that n***a's a acid mouth
I will never lose, I'm cruising past your house
I'mma start chewing his meat if he's as I'm out?
Hit me wit the .50 - get your brains blasted
Carry me a Billy the Kid and that's plastic
Buried n***a, hid in the crib, and that's-that's it
I be on some dumping the dead n***as in caskets
Do it for the bi-bi uh chop chop
Do it for the b**hes, tch-tch-tch, slash em'
I get all up in a n***a head, aspirin
I could get a n***a shot in the head, ask 'em
Orville Redenbacher, n***a I'll pop ya'
Tore his head like cotton, go need the doctor
Call the coroner, leavin' him in a corner
Called his boys up, they gon' be looking for him
Put these toys up, disappear in the morning
Eat these boys up, it was a little boring
sh** his prime guts, I'm nuts, I'm sick
I must consider Your Highness, b**h

Suicide Watch

[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/devious/-/suicide-watch.html]
[Verse 2: Devious]
Yeah boy, got my mind on the milli
Hand gripped tight on the milla
Finger on the trigga', and you f**ing wit' a straight guerilla
Dominate the enemy tremendously, and leave em' wit' his face on the pillow
Reppin' MadeSicc n***a, they don't really want it
If you want it come get it
Come wit' it I'm a spit it, from the start to the finish
Wit' no fault or pretending, hit all in yo' mouth like a dentist
(Is it the siccness!?)
They got a n***a all in it to win it, busta better pardon my Cripness'
Put you on my hit list, *gunshot*
And just bring a witness to the lyrical ma**acre of these b**hes
Played a part in inventing this
Cut, slice, dice, chop, beef scrambled up, test and cook syrup
n***a, 'cause I'm a hit em' wit'
Right, left, punch, uppercut, then throw pronouns and verbs
And many other words, I'm like a Thunderbird
I mean a Thundercat, that's just the way I act
I put em' on their back and that's a known fact
I leave their motherf**ing sound and their line flat
You wanna habitat, where them G's at?
I flip it like a mat and light it like a match
Freddy Krueger Luda, wit' a Ruger on his lap
Poom, pang, ping, k** a dream like that
So where my n***as, yo? And where the b**hes go?
We paint a pretty picture from the ceiling to the flo'
We tear the club up, been done f**ed the streets though
If you really want it all you gotta' do is let me know
You f**ing wit' my brotha Lynch I'm busting Calicos *gunshot*
I creep up on you, you don't wanna give you mo'
Hotter than the sun, colder than an Eskimo
Blap at 'em wit' the 4""
And have 'em yelling Geronimo!
