Hursty,In Bed With Bias,2003,"Dedicated to all the crews who said that Id never amount to nothing
To all the people who live next the train yard in Macleod and Eltham
Who called the police on me when I was just trying to paint a panel
To feed my ego
And all the writers out on Hursty line, go on spraying
It's all good out in Hursty

It was all a dream
I used to be amazed by the hip hop scene
AKA and DMA up in Hype Magazine
Graff photos on the wall
Every Saturday stepping to the AM Cruzy taking calls
I let my tape rock while waiting for pot
Smoke weed in al frescos, chilling round the local shops
Way back, when I always seem to have a marker dacked
And the trains are really trashed
Remember USA crew, and Jolimont yards
I never thought Melbourne crews could leave the trains so scarred
Wanna get my tag right, bag packed tight
Whipping out my spray, get up on the subway
Transit pressure, strip search
Dont let it stress ya
Check ya backpack, hoping that they can arrest ya
Peace to MD, pudgy, JME
Watsonia, Heidelberg to Montmorency
Writers getting up but they knew they should
Painting trains, same city, same hood, was all good

It's all good
And if you don't know, if you don't know
If you don't know ""Represent Hursty""
""Borough to Eltham""
""Represent Hursty"" ""Borough to Eltham""
""Represent Hursty"" ""Borough to Eltham""
""Represent Hursty"" ""Borough to Eltham""

I'd made the change from doing graff on streets
To up in PBS busting raps over beats
It was far from sweet
I smoked bongs with my mates all day
The bong breath kept the girls away
What these rappers used to say got me shitty
So I got busy
Now they wanna backstab and diss me
I always knew it could happen, this rapping stuff
I got busted twice for graff and racking stuff
And its funny how we both spent those days being the most
From 87, 88 that shit was dope
Whole cars, I'm dreaming. Train yards, I creep
Bags full of paint stashed inside a train seat
Racking all the fresh gear
Getting new clothes everyday of every year
A young kid
Acting cool after school being a fool
Catching blue trains on Hursty line
Pieced by pest and jewel
Getting hyped, a teenage graff writer, misunderstood
Greensborough neighborhood

It's all good
And if you don't know, if you don't know
If you don't know ""Represent Hursty""
""Borough to Eltham""
""Represent Hursty"" ""Borough to Eltham""
""Represent Hursty"" ""Borough to Eltham""
""Represent Hursty"" ""Borough to Eltham""

No ticket inspectors, or cameras on the fence
From the age of 13, with a marker represent
20mm super flow pen, or the posca
Got 2 empty middle cars, about to bomb yah
Tempra markers, 30mm fat
Hang out of Hitachi, bomb, do panels at the back
At the paint store, browsing
Wait for the right moment
Dack 3 cans and I'm bouncing
Thinking back on all the good paint racks
Getting chased by the jacks
Along the train tracks
Doing graff was like a sport, of course
No smile on my face the day I walked into court
Transit force, used to bust and raid us
Gave us $1000 fines that we payed up
In those days, when the smoke blazed
Never want to get a can of paint and go spray
Damn right, I like the life I live
Growing up on the line known as Hurstbridge

It's all good
And if you don't know, if you don't know
If you don't know ""Represent Hursty""

Now You’re Gone,Been There Done That,2007,"I know you're looking down on me, are you proud of me?
Or are you upset I don’t spend time with the family?
Or do you understand me, the way I’ve become?
There’s so many things I wish that I could say to you mum
I was seventeen years young when you past away
I found it had after you and Dad divorced to find my way
I’ve cried away the pain, although I didn’t complain
Caught in the middle of the family separation
Was stress in my brain, depression came I don’t know how I coped
Hit the pipe, all my dreams up in a cloud of smoke
It didn’t help but got me more confused
Then I went to stay with Dad when you moved and you were crushed
When I saw you in court after that letter I wrote
The one that I’m regretting I wrote
Felt like you’d lost your son, felt like I’d lost my mum
That was enough and there was worse to come
 x2
You know I miss you Mum
I really miss you
(Now you’re gone)Now you’re gone
(Now you’re gone)Now you’re gone

I never felt so close to anybody
As I did with you and now that I’m older
I understand why people do the things they do
But I was lacking life experience, around ’89 shit got serious
Started with some lumps, next thing I hear is tumours
And everything the doctors tried was useless
Radiotherapy, Chemotherapy, 4th of July ’91 down at the cemetery
Knowing that this day would eventually come
Hope you know what you meant to me Mum
You were the one who said experience the world
And do whatever you wanna do
So I hope you’re really proud of this man standing in front of you
I know you’re watching me and I can feel you at times
You’re still in my dreams and you’re still in my mind
It’s been fifteen years since you left me behind
And I wish you were here now with me, sipping this wine
I miss you
 x2
You know I miss you Mum
I really miss you
(Now you’re gone)Now you’re gone
(Now you’re gone)Now you’re gone

When I look back I didn’t even know you at all
I was still growing up and just a little confused boy
Who never said goodbye when you left
Last time I saw you, Nan told me not to talk about death
On the day you passed away I was the last one called
And when they knew the day before nobody called at all
But you still see me going to Christmas, buying gifts
Doing it for you, that’s what you would’ve wanted me to do
I’m getting through life, yeah and I’m doing okay
Started with you watching break dance back in the day
How funny’s that? And you were there when I first did graff
And you were my inspiration to get out and rap
I miss you so much Mum but I’m not sad and grieving
When I was younger I was mad at you leaving
But the reason don’t matter anymore I still love you to death
And forever after when I see you in the next
 x2
You know I miss you Mum
I really miss you
(Now you’re gone)Now you’re gone
(Now you’re gone)Now you’re gone",https://genius.com/Bias-b-now-youre-gone-lyrics
Changin’,In Bed With Bias,2003,"Change my focus, visions of a brighter future
When all seems hopeless, choose to make a new manoeuvre
Time to improve the person who I'm getting used ta
Used to be a drug abuser, be a user
Felt like a loser, but who's to say?
I moved away from the former self and into the new
I stay searching, but never know where happiness is lurking
Working towards my goal, but from the path I'm swerving
Mind changing like seasons
The mind chasing a reason to continue down this path
When half me wants to be leaving, and making change
Repeating the same things day after day the way I'm seeing
This world through the eyes of an exhausted kid
Aborting the negative thoughts and tryna get my shit sorted
And so I'm searching deep inside of my heart
Taking pride with the art of writing, trying to ignite a spark

Changing my focus, time to make new goals
Strangely devoted to jumping through the loopholes
Majorly bloated because I grew my soul
Hater views take hold, no more cruise control
Blues unfold, then the wind gust picks me up
And I'm up for the positive transitions, I've got
Beautiful visions though I'm missing the past
And there may be collisions where my path enters the dark
The centre of my heart needs to reveal
And feel that same part, cold as steel
I rolled with the wheels serrated, edge sharp
Hold the meal, it didn't appeal, pass the cask
I was stuck, drinking in the park
Searching for the leaf, relief and a brand new start
It's hard but it's far from impossible
Evolving, moulding myself to become unstoppable

Change my focus, stop and pull my socks up
Thinking this life that I've got sucks cause I haven't got much
I'm part of the mainframe but feel like an off cut
When life seems hard, search for the soft touch
There's not enough, just make and do, I've made it through
The first twenty-eight years, always facing new hurdles
Sometimes I feel I run around in circles
Get myself back on track, out of this mental whirlpool
Mind changing gears, I let my conscience steer
My every thought towards the future and ignore my fears
I try to stay focused as each day approaches
Cause everything's changing, that's the thing I've noticed
Through these eyes of frustration, the situation is
Things that change this strain on my brain, I need replacement
And I'm looking deep inside of my mind
Taking time with the art of writing, trying to recite these lines
Gotta change myself
I've gotta change my life
Wanna change my thoughts
Wanna change my sights
I can't change the world
I can't change the past
But I can change my future
Just don't know where to start
Change myself
I've gotta change my life
Wanna change my thoughts
Wanna change my sights
I can't change the world
I can't change the past
But I can change my future
Just don't know where to start",https://genius.com/Bias-b-changin-lyrics
Goin’ Down,Been There Done That,2007,"Gimme a second let me catch some feelings
On the paper the ballpoint run around
Its only lyrics I deal in
Bias B, Doc Felix got the sound you're hearing
Something so appealing
Don't stand around when the party's going down
Throw your hands at the ceiling
Now, now, now

I've got the illness
Needed a shot from Doc Felix
You hit the spot, feel it
What we've got be the realist on offer
Flow like a 20 ml topped up
Couldn't shut this shit here down
Even if the cops rocked up with a cease and desist
It's Bias B and D Smit
It's going down like smoke when the roach be leavin' the lip
Take two hits and pass man you're kiddin' yourself
I take at least five myself, make sure the effects are felt
From the west of Chelten to the heads in Hallam
And all my brothers out in B-B-'Borough to Eltham
Victoria, Melbourne, baby born and bred
Dropped a couple of classics you've heard the talk, got cred
Now to the local scene I'm more than a vet
Spent some time abroad, spendin' my royalty checks
Money I made off my last album, I called it in bed
Cos I was sleepin' on the shit, I heard it bored me to death

Gimme a second let me catch some feelings
On the paper the ballpoint run around
Its only lyrics I deal in
Bias B, Doc Felix got the sound you're hearing
Something so appealing
Don't stand around when the party's going down
Throw your hands at the ceiling
Now, now, now

Catch me rolling through the 'hood
Hurstbrige, Heidelberg, Collingwood
To Richmond 3121, Its Bias B don't front
When you feel the funk runnin' through the beats
With the drums and kicks
Head to the streets of Brunswick east
Coming with something sweet
Something to pump on repeat
Something so butter comin' from underneath
Bias got you up on your feet
When the eruption peaks, nothing but heat
Every time the mics turned on
You heard otherwise, you heard wrong
Your best doesn't compare to my worst song
All I needs a beat to get spurred on
I rap 'till it hurts son
You heard the word, I burst lungs
Other rap careers are third-rung
I'm top of the ladder, building my rep getting work done
That's how it goes, these shows I'm stealin'
Doc Felix on the decks
Take a second, let me catch some feelings


Gimme a second let me catch some feelings
On the paper the ballpoint run around
Its only lyrics I deal in
Bias B, Doc Felix got the sound you're hearing
Something so appealing
Don't stand around when the party's going down
Throw your hands at the ceiling
Now, now, now",https://genius.com/Bias-b-goin-down-lyrics
Flavour Thru Ya Speakers,In Bed With Bias,2003,"My dad keeps on bugging me to save my cash
You'll need a house and all that, I should be making stacks
But I'm waiting back, hanging out with mates who rap
Always late paying tax, don't save a cent, I always raid the stash
I like to splash it on some dinner and wine
Having the time of my life, late nights comfort me, I wind my mind
I find I spend too many hours on end
Putting a bend in my brain with substance I shouldn't recommend
I settle in for a night on the couch
But this Hip Hop life has got me waking up, I should be passing out
Walking past my house, smell the passing about
A free paper, time for play, but let me spark it up now
Flavour thru the speakers, smelling lovely
Sometimes I wonder why I bother to rap
Travel interstate just to rock on a track
Wake up after the show and I'm coughing up black
I wish my wallet was fat, I've got to stop and look back
And all these kids want to chat, always the same old convo
Disable that shit and let me sit and sip my Cointreau
I've got no time for this idle conversation
Damn right it's wasting, trains the same in every state
And I'm hating the scene like Lyrical Commiss' at times like this
Wanna find a chick to kiss, but some kid's got some lyrics to spit
I've had enough of it, sometimes I can't be fucked with it
You roll that scoob yet D? Let's puff on it
Flavour thru the speakers, smelling lovely
My name is always on the door list so fuck the cost of it
Everything always free with a rhinoceros hanging off of it
On top of this I've got to write lyrics that Chopper ripped
I used to send out promos, now I'm shipping out a box of shit
Watch kids stop me on the street, they want their shit signed
Spit rhymes into my ear and let me know how much they dig mine
Gone are the days getting pissed, drinking to get blind
Instead go out for dinner with mates and slowly sip wine
See basically my shit shines on stage when I kick rhymes
Drinking Cointreau cranberry with a twist of lime
The radio cohost who occasionally smokes
Go crack a bottle of Moet with chick's breast cause I'm so stoked",https://genius.com/Bias-b-flavour-thru-ya-speakers-lyrics
Pervert,In Bed With Bias,2003,"I can't help being a pervert
Love a sneak peek up a girl’s skirt
Started for me in primary school
Copped my first perv up the teacher's dress
Sneaking under the desk
Asking girls in the playground to undress
Taking off their undies
Me and my buddies playing kiss chasey
With the young hunnies coz it was funny
Running around in the girls' dunnies
Got me excited, a young Bias B running riot
Didn’t know about sex till this girl named Christine
Taught me what a dick means, kissed and licked clean
And I was only nine or ten, as I reflect I wasn't even erect
I didn't understand the concept of ejaculation
Still I had a fascination with girls taking off their pants
And placing my hands on their delicate spot
And I got my intrigued with the beaver the older I got
I didn't know what to do
And to tell you the truth
I was scared but my mates were like ""Go get a root!""
I found a cute little blonde, and it was on no doubt
But couldn't help perving on all her friends when we were out
Or at home on her couch
Always seem to
Going for a sneak preview
Seeing her mum in something see through
Just a young teen who needed a serve
And nothing changed always been a pervert

When she walks by
My gaze stays locked on her thighs
No woman is safe from these wandering eyes
Even feral woman that be looking like they  rock
Still get dick and licked like a Paddle Pop
I slide in calmly when I'm hiding the salami
Loves a battlefield and I'm a one man army
Pull roots like Don Burke digging in the dirt
Up your skirt I do work like a true pervert

This other girl I was with her names Melissa
Like her a lot but got infatuated perving on her younger sister
Walking 'round the house in her bra and undies
Couldn’t keep my eyes to myself she was so lovely
She must have only been seventeen
With the best set of teenage breasts I’d ever seen
I had dreams of touching my girls younger sis
When I was sexing Melissa thoughts of her sister made me cum quick
My next door neighbour had me staring
Perving through the curtain at the white bikini she was wearing
I had dreams of touching her too
But would have copped more than a thumping if her husband knew
It's just something I do, and just something I love
Catching the bus and looking at girls in their cars from up above
You can look but don’t touch, that's the rules of the game
Sometimes I had to have a pull, I was going insane
At the pool my aim, concentrate and swim
Coz when I do backstroke my dick protrudes like a shark's fin
I had to go swim a few extra laps
And let the fat go back down so I relaxed
Keep my eyes off the snatch for a minute or two
But everytime I close my eyes I'll still be thinking of you
And the way your body curves
What a fine piece of work
Like everyone else
I’m just a pervert

When she walks by
My gaze stays locked on her thighs
No woman is safe from these wandering eyes
Even feral woman that be looking like they  rock
Still get dick and licked like a Paddle Pop
I slide in calmly when I'm hiding the salami
Loves a battlefield and I'm a one man army
Pull roots like Don Burke digging in the dirt
Up your skirt I do work like a true pervert
When she walks by
My gaze stays locked on her thighs
No woman is safe from these wandering eyes
Even feral woman that be looking like they  rock
Still get dick and licked like a Paddle Pop
I slide in calmly when I'm hiding the salami
Loves a battlefield and I'm a one man army
Pull roots like Don Burke digging in the dirt
Up your skirt I do work like a true pervert",https://genius.com/Bias-b-pervert-lyrics
In Love With The Music,Biaslife,2011,"I never knew a love like this
I never knew a love like this

I fell in love with you at such an early age
My parents didn’t like it, telling me to stay away
I couldn’t fall asleep at night, you made me feel so good
So I promised you that I’d keep it as real as I could
You trust me? A little rusty, you taught me a thing or two
To have control and how to hold it when I’m hitting you
Flipping over you on the sofa boasting too
Telling all the blokes and they’re scopin’ who’s devoted true?
Every word I wrote for you
You let me hit it every night, like you’re supposed to do
Up in the studio vocal booth, getting vocal struth
I got you open like my Subaru sunroof in December
Could never get you out of my head
Songs and love letter I wrote I left them next to the bed
Whatever they said you never read the word of a lie
You’re the one who gave me wings when I was learning to fly

It’s the music, day, night
I’m in love with the music, we keep it really tight
I’m in love with the music, feel it deep inside
I’m in love with the music, can you feel my vibe?
I’m in love with the music, you make me feel alright
I’m in love with the music, nobody tell my wife
I’m in love with the music

When we started going out I liked to show you off
Smoking hot, trying to keep a focus on the flow I got
Even when the alcohol wrote me off, you never broke me off
Through all the ups and downs
You kept me grounded like Motorcross
When I tried to close doors you broke the locks
Then I went all in like a Poker Pot
We had lots of roads to cross, you had to show me who’s boss
When I got too stoned off chops constantly dozing off
You turned my life around look at me I’m smiling now
Flying now at thirty thousand feet above the whitest clouds
I’m never touching down, I’m high on life
Look at me amongst the stars baby I’m shining bright
I climbed to heights I thought that I could never achieve
And endeavoured to be the best I could be
Guess you’re my destiny
You’ll be right next to me 'til the day that I die
Whenever I breathe, believe it’s you that’s making me vibe

It’s the music, day, night
I’m in love with the music, we keep it really tight
I’m in love with the music, feel it deep inside
I’m in love with the music, can you feel my vibe?
I’m in love with the music, you make me feel alright
I’m in love with the music, nobody tell my wife
I’m in love with the music

We’ve been together like forever now
I know I let you down at times but things are better now
You helped me settle down and get my head around this relationship
My world was spinning around so fast
I had to stop and find a place to sit
When I lost my faith it was too late to quit
You made me hold you tight like a paper clip
Yes I played you for a bit
And you forgave me for the days that I missed
This was just a little stage that I hit
That’s all behind us now, let’s celebrate and blaze a spliff
Take a trip to Brizzy sunshine and bake in it
There’s no mistaking it’s cemented in stone
The love flowing like the Trevi Fountain Italy Rome
Over time we’ve grown together now we’re better as one
In any weather, get together, but it’s best in the sun
You give me credit for the effort and the lengths that I’ve gone
I never mentioned I love you, there I’ve said it I’m done

It’s the music, day, night
I’m in love with the music, we keep it really tight
I’m in love with the music, feel it deep inside
I’m in love with the music, can you feel my vibe?
I’m in love with the music, you make me feel alright
I’m in love with the music, nobody tell my wife
I’m in love with the music

I never knew a love like this",https://genius.com/Bias-b-in-love-with-the-music-lyrics
