Jan-26,Reclaim Australia,2016,"[Chorus: Dan Sultan & 
Briggs

You can call it what you want
But it just don't mean a thing
No, it just don't mean a thing
Fuck that, homie
You can come and wave your flag
But it don't mean a thing to me
No, it just don't mean a thing
Fuck that, homie
You can call it what you want
But it just don't mean a thing
No, it just don't mean a thing
Fuck that, homie
You can come and wave your flag
But it don't mean a thing to me
No, it just don't mean a thing
Fuck that, homie

They said, ""Hey, Briggs, pick a date"" (Okay)
""You know, one we can celebrate"" (For sure)
""Where we can come together"" (Yeah)
""Talk about the weather, call that Australia Day""
I said, ""How about March 8th?"" (That's a good one)
And we can do it on your Nan's grave (Got that, bitch?)
We can piss up, piss on her face (Hahahaha)
Get lit up and burn out like Mark Skaife
They screaming, ""Love it or leave it"" (Love it)
I got more reason to be here, if you could believe it (Ha)
Won't salute a constitution or who's underneath it (Nope)
Turn that flag to a noose, put a cease to your breathing
I can't get in my whip, I get a ticket for that
I get a DWB, and that's a 'Driving Whilst Black' (Ha)
I turn the other cheek, I get a knife in my back
And I tell 'em it hurts, they say I overreact
So fuck that (Fuck that)

Fuck that, homie
You can come and wave your flag
But it don't mean a thing to me
No, it just don't mean a thing

I said celebrate the heretic any time outside Jan 26 (Any time)
That's the date for them suckers doing that sucker shit (That's true)
That's that land-taking, flag-waving attitude
Got this new Captain Cook dance to show you how to move (Move it)
How you wanna raise a flag with a rifle
To make us want to celebrate anything but survival?
Nah, you watching tele for 
The Bachelor
But wouldn‚Äôt read a book about a fuckload of massacres? (What?)
I remember all the blood and what carried us (I remember)
They remember twenty recipes for lamingtons (Yum)
Yeah, their ancestors got a boat ride
Both mine saw them coming until they both died (Blaow)
Fuck celebrating days made of misery (Fuck that)
White Aus still got the black history (That's true)
And that shirt'll get you banned from the Parliament
If you ain't having a conversation, well then we starting it

Briggs

You can call it what you want

Dumb Things,triple j Like a Version 13,2016,"Welcome strangers to the show
I'm the one who should be lying low
Saw the knives out, turned my back
Heard the train coming, stayed right on that track

In the middle, in the middle
In the middle of a dream
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings
I've done all the dumb things

Yeah, them dumb things
This goin' out to all my brothers down there in Don Dale
Dealin' with that disaster that them guards are there and not jail
Thinking we gettin' our welfare, huh? Thinking we gettin' our healthcare, huh?
Think about if it was your son, now think about sending some help there, yeah
What's dumber than that mate? What's dumber than dressing up blackface?
What's dumber than doing it knowing it hurts and don't even work to make that change
Let's go

In the middle, in the middle
In the middle of a dream
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings
I've done all the dumb things

We got
We got islands for the ones who seekin' asylum
We got silence for the ones who died in confinement
If you're complacent to the words of a racist
Don't you dare complain when that's what leading your nation
Send in the clowns, they're blackfacing
They're locking up couples, they're locking up brothers, but they ain't leavin' the station
The date's changin'

In the middle, in the middle
In the middle of a dream
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings
I've done all the dumb things

Ladies and gentleman. On the keys and drums Mr John, Mr Paul Bartlett AKA SixFour. On the guitar, my brother Dan Sultan. And to my right, Mr Paul Kelly

Yeah, them dumb things
Lumped in, looking for peace, but won't find it
They holdin' us back from closing the gap by keeping them close minded
See, no surprises there, hearing both of them sirens blare
Them coppers where I'm from are kind of fair, if you kinda fair

What's a royal commission to the ones who live on a mission
To the ones who's killed by the system by the ones that's meant to assist 'em
At the hands of policemen, who's gonna police them?
They killin' us Koori's, they got it on footage, they need to release them

In the middle, in the middle
In the middle of a dream
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings
I've done all the dumb things

Mr John Bartlett


My brother Dan Sultan


Mr Paul Kelly


In the middle, in the middle
In the middle of a dream
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings
I've done all the dumb things

Yeah, I melted wax to fix my wings
Threw my hat into the ring
I thought that I just had to sing
I've done all the dumb things",https://genius.com/Ab-original-dumb-things-lyrics
2 Black 2 Strong,Reclaim Australia,2016,"The brothers are back, they pay stacks to see 'em
Fuck it up worse than Eso in a wax museum
This plastic scene like Plasticine
You see the mould is old and the facts are being
That I rock shows like I had four clones
Eight microphones, and cuss so much it sounds like Morse Code
So fuck you and where your horse go
Cause once you see dorsal it's too late, that's ya torso

Call me the man that's 
(2 black)
 with a plan that's 
(2 strong)
Said authority keep stopping me then asking me to move on
That's calculated, medicine is out of date and man
They fucking love it when you sound afraid but this is not that one
This my mother's black son, driving like I stole it
Blind-folded and eyes closed, wearing a pair of bifocals
And I'm still rocking, them black bodies still dropping
Still filling prisons, still filling coffins

Smart black man with a plan, nothing scarier
Now blackout, yeah, they still wanna
Kick the blacks out, yeah, I get the feeling
That I'm dead even though I'm still here walking
All said and done I can still hear talking
Now blackout, yeah, they still wanna
Kick the blacks out, yeah, they still wanna kick the

They could never do it better than this
And if they say that they did then terrorists win
It's the A.B. Orig-in-al they are
Bringing that dope shit even if they aren't
They wouldn't know rap if it jabbed their trap
And snapped their back (damn near put your face in your lap)
I'm like a breath of fresh air in a fresh pair
Watching your demise with a stoggie in a deckchair

I let 'em check the method, roll another blunt until a chest infection
Right up till it sounds like a dial-up internet connection
Get it like it's credit at the deli when you're hanging
More raptours than John Hammond god damn it
Bring a famine to your food court in just one lunch
Till I'm happy as a pig: two girls, one cup
Brother run up and get wrecked mate, Netflix and chill
Till I hit it with that Scott Disick Didick then I peel

Said it don't, it don't, it don't
It don't? It don't get more blacker than this
It don't, it don't, it don't
It don't? It don't get more blacker than this

These motherfuckers just never listen. It's like they never got flogged, they never got hidings. Where's your fucking dads at? Fuck is wrong with you?

It's the blackout, 2 black, 2 strong
2 wrongs made it right, been white too long
It's the blackout, it's everything that you fear
Tired of this shit, like I've had a good year
It's the blackout, like when Suge bailed Pac out
Like what you see before you tap out
It's the blackout, like you didn't see it coming
It's the blackout, like I'm here with my cousins

The atheist afraid couldn't handle the God (you scared?)
They handle the pipe and try to handle the nod
Was gonna dismantle your squad, the damage was done, you flopped
Somethin' like Kardashian socks: Rob

You can catch me at that pie cart
Maxing out my tab with Gina Rinehart (that's frightening)
I hit you with that Andrew Bolt of lighting
Right inside your fucking comfort zone, choking from them undertones
You catered to the nature of the dumb and watched your bunda grow

I C U,Reclaim Australia,2016,"I never hesitate to burn a bridge
Sometimes I just remind 'em what a furnace is
And with the burners lit it feels like the perfect gift
I could see the future, figure out what ya purpose is
You're like a burden on a certain tip
And the iceberg's lurkin' to pull the curtain on a virgin ship
You ducked out while the work was thick
So now I point out to these clowns where the circus is
I am what, you pretend to Be, that might offend you
But I been through, might end you
With no one, to avenge you
Friends come and friends go, that fucks with your mental
Until its just benzos and endones in ya friendzone
So don't ever call me lucky
You don't know what I done, what it was, who I lost, or what it cost me
If our next meetings kind of frosty
Its 'cause you were taking too much time trying to watch me

And you're too busy watching me
When you need to watch yourself
Choose your words more carefully
But play the hand you're dealt
'Cause you come around, with your running mouth
Call me stupid... I see you
'Cause you come around, with your running mouth
Call me stupid... I see you

I never hesitate to burn a bridge
I lift a pint glass then watch the Reichstag when the curtains lift
On the right path to end up in that wrong place
With the reaper, in deeper than Dantes
Yes, aching in my chest is what I'm living with
Stress, youth incarceration's my privilege
Death on the cards since I was a youngling
Paul Kelly with the big belly did them dumb things
I hit 20, they said he might be lucky
Guess that funerals are beautiful and life is ugly
Brothers and my sisters, love 'em and I miss them
Stuck within the system, can I get a witness?
I get the feeling that me breathing is a bonus
But if I'm taking anything I'm doing what they shown us
So when ya call 'ern and you wonder where the cops be
It's cos they taking too much time trying to watch me

And you're too busy watching me
When you need to watch yourself
Choose your words more carefully
But play the hand you're dealt
'Cause you come around, with your running mouth
Call me stupid... I see you
'Cause you come around, with your running mouth
Call me stupid... I see you

My brother - you gotta watch your health
When they come around you better watch yourself
My sister - you gotta watch out for me
I'll watch for you while you're watching police
My niece, my cousin, my nephew
Understand that your fam won't forget you
You gotta get up, breathe - get up, breathe!
Get up, breathe - get up, get up!
[Chorus 2: Thelma Plum (
Briggs & Trials

And you're too busy watching me
When you need to watch yourself
Get up
Choose your words more carefully
But play the hand you're dealt
Get up, breathe!

Call 'Em Out,Reclaim Australia,2016,"I wonder if you'd believe this as a solution to the 
""Aboriginal problem""
? Herd the worst of the Aborigines into one area, then put a chemical in their water that sent them sterile. In time, there'd be none of them left. 
Well, that solution has been put forward by none other than one of the premier's closest friends, West Australian mining magnate, Lang Hancock

Yeah, my trust in the police died in custody (pow)
Hand cuffed and stuffed inside some fuckery
Double knees to keep my breathing shallow as my grave is
On my best behaviours, till we end up leaking on the pavements (why)
Best believe its racist if we both walk in the same shop tomorrow (tomorrow)
And only one gets followed by the same cop
The only difference is our pigment, at least' that's what the pig meant
They wanna put us all back in the pig pen
But not all are, still thinking we fauna, this real life
Hit 'em with that one-two: Tamir Rice
Clear signs nothings getting better and they ain't gonna let up
Till we get that gut full and fed up (we starving)
That's when they told me looking out for justice was outdated
Deal with it and trust the judges
 (what the fuck?)
Newsflash motherfucker, I don't respect ya (hell no)
Ignoring it is easy when it won't even effect ya
[Chorus: Trials & 
Briggs
]
I call 'em out, what what, I call 'em out
I said I call 'em out, what what, I call 'em out
I said I call 'em out, what what, I call 'em out
I call 'em out, and then I sort 'em out quick
Hey Briggs, you called 'em out? 
Hell yeah, I called 'em out
We did another lap and gave them something else to talk about
We called 'em out, what what, we called 'em out
We called 'em out, and then we sort 'em out quick
Bitch
 - and then we sort 'em out quick
They want beef, then we sort 'em out
Then we sort 'em out quick
And then we sort 'em out quick

The ones that are no good to themselves, can‚Äôt accept things
, the half-castes‚Äîand this is where most of the trouble comes‚ÄîI would dope the water up so that they were sterile and would breed themselves out in future and that would solve the problem

Yeah, skin of onyx
Manatronix, sippin' gin and tonic and hittin' chronic
I spit ebonics, fuck the system
I heard they buildin' up another prison
Right outside the subdivision, Officer Friendly
Swallowing Henny, intoxicated off power
Following any vehicle occupied
With people of colour, so I'm keepin' my brother
The powers against me, Mama convinced me
There's good in everybody and e'rybody was good
When they used lynch me and drench me
I'm speaking for victims, many don't have a voice
Shuffled in the system, so we share the wisdom
Speaking of lives lost, they killing our kind
And barely getting' time off
They said we really shouldn't talk about
I say the opposite and call 'em out

Yeah yeah, I call 'em out
I call 'em out, what what, I call 'em out
I said I call 'em out, what what, I call 'em out
I call 'em out, and then I sort 'em out quick

The do-gooders came along and they‚Äîthese beurocrats and the rest of them who would write great thesis on things down south... and they decided that they better go and civilise these savages of ours, so they brought 'em into the towns

Third class citizen, never got rid of 'em
Locked in the system, no presumption of innocence
I keep the mindstate militant
I keep watch on my brothers because my states killin 'em
I keep my whips inconspicuous
'Cause these pigs give a fuck what you in
'Cause what you drive may be where you die
If you pull over you mightn't pull out alive
Raisin' my hands, drawn a line in the sand
So there's no excuse for a gun and a badge
To let anything fly, if anyone dies
Make sure every cop shop in the city fries
It's easier to kill us than skill us
What good's a gorilla in a world of vanilla
Other rappers ain't finna to talk about (Fuck Boys)
Fuck that, I say the opposite and call 'em out

Now I wouldn't mind Philip, if it was just the black‚Äîthe true Aborigine‚Äîbut there are so many hybrides, and they're nearly white, and this is where it hurts me",https://genius.com/Ab-original-call-em-out-lyrics
Take Me Home,Reclaim Australia,2016,"[Verse 1: Briggs & 
Trials
]
You can't contain my authority, restrain the minority
Take the hand, everybody would follow me
From a long line of leaders and warriors
I pathed the path through the face of intolerance
Through the face of a colonist, half-arsed apologist
Celebrating death on Australia Day
More they making a change, more they staying the same
In a blink watch an 
officer
 turn into a coroner
You ain't got the balls to walk these corridors
Rip the claws in Namorrodor's jaws
""Everything's getting heavy,""

And if things don't change somebody's getting buried

Yeah, I stay clever to the man
Hip to the game, watched every claim
Saw them speak up, watch them detained
Again, again, again, again
They claim brotherhood, but never act how a brother would
Put it on my name, we ain't the same, get it understood
And pass a nulla nulla to the other fulla
See, love is cool, but love is blind
You got pride in what son? Leaving kids behind
Until they die and the rest getting locked up
Nah, we making change, no question
Call myself Trials 'cause my people don't get them

Aye Briggs!
 Yo, whattup?
Yeah we should probably get this record done dog
Yeah, yeah a'ight, 
I got like five minutes left in me
Of life!
 Shit I'm already dead

The clock ticks on (on, on)
Numbers over the face (face)
Every day is a victory
In this invisible race

I will always begin knowing I will never finish
I will always begin knowing I will never finish
I got too much to do
I could be dead in a minute

When I was fifteen they hit me with this midlife crisis
Blood in my background like it‚Äôs filmed by ISIS
We mixed breeds and hybrids that run up to your parked car
Hit you with this arm bar, now who got the half-caste?
Nothing sweet as winning when you always got to start last
You Jar-Jar big mistake
, cokeheads lick the plate
Wack rappers lick the sack, government don‚Äôt give it back
So we gon‚Äô take it all while we can 
before we take a fall
Like Owen Hart
, they watchin‚Äô me like I
Barbecued half of Noah‚Äôs ark and jumped inside a lowered car
With tinted windows while I‚Äôm rippin‚Äô indo
Even though I‚Äôm sober, but that don‚Äôt mean a thing though
(Come here, son) {bang}, I could be dead any minute
They want me out the way, in the grave or the prison
A slave to the system so I‚Äôm talkin‚Äô on the mic
To bring black back in fashion as I walk into the light

The clock ticks on (on, on)
Numbers over the face (face)
Every day is a victory
In this invisible race

I will always begin knowing I will never finish
I will always begin knowing I will never finish
I got too much to do
I could be dead in a minute

Throw me the keys to the Lambo, notify the fam though
Call the Ambos, I‚Äôm goin‚Äô out like Rambo
Suicide by cop, are you alive or what?
The crisis of midlife got me swinging this Bowie knife
My life is just throwin‚Äô dice and livin‚Äô on borrowed time, I‚Äôm
Clappin‚Äô students like I‚Äôm bowlin‚Äô for Columbine
The strong and the silent type throw caution to the wind
Gettin‚Äô drawn and quartered, forcing every horse to drink
It‚Äôs the awesome force within, thing I‚Äôm forced to win
Jesus, you crossed me once but never crossed again mate
Ya kid get a big home and lovely foster kin
Feel awful for the orphan but that‚Äôs what imposters get
Let my epitaph read: ‚Äúcome down here and say it‚Äù
I‚Äôll be hauntin‚Äô all your prayers and fuckin‚Äô up your s√©ance
I lived half your life but lived twice as nice
I did twice the stuff and lived half the time

I will always begin knowing I will never finish
I will always begin knowing I will never finish
I will always begin knowing I will never finish
I will always begin knowing I will never finish
I will always begin knowing I will never finish

Talkin' all that bullshit and now they tryna hide from me
Please Briggs you don't wanna shoot messengers
But I wanna do somethin' to leave the messages
Livin' proof you're gonna learn what the lesson is
You fuck around and I'm a have to make a mess of yas
I got a letter from the government, took it where my oven is
Cooked it on the stove top, fuck 'em I want none of it
I asked 'en' where my cousin went? You had him in your fucken pen
Killed him, got a holiday, and that's not a punishment
So line up the white like I'm Maradona
You fucked around made do some shit that I don't wanna
Apologies don't follow me or you're a goner
I know you're sorry, and I'm sorry but I gotta

I'm sorry, you're sorry
You caught some feelings from me
I might just kill somebody
La di la da di la dah la
I'm sorry, you're sorry
You caught some feelings from me
I might just kill somebody
You make me feel some kind of way
La di la da di la dah la
La di la da di la dah la

Deep down down down down

Firing Squad,Reclaim Australia,2016,"You can tell when they sweatin' and they breath hard
Hit the pipe and then he turn into a Scream mask
Drop a grand on a gram type scenario
Now they deeper in the pipe than Mario (sup Luigi)
Try that shit over in Bali bro
You'd be in a prison gettin' beaten with a garden hose
Eating with rats, all the scraps off the floor (yum)
Garnish it with blood from the scabs on your jaw (delicious)
The friendliest will turn into the envious
Dumped their moral compass and got higher than Dikembe is
Mutumbo, Dumbo, your point's fuckin' Jumbo
Eyes on the prize left them lookin' like Columbo
My squad said you wanna diss me
All alone with your homie chasing all them twin peaks (nah)
Said they like Lance without the cancer
Told them all them drugs they doing are not enhancing
The squad (hey)

From the front to the back bullets over the track
From the firing squad (hey)
No a vest ain't special, it can't protect
From the firing squad (hey)
You can hear us coming but there ain't no running
From the firing squad (hey)
Do as you're told, put on your blindfold
It's the firing squad

Direct from Methlehem
Jesus Christ put down the pipe
Actin' like Bjork from the land of ice, if they
Hand you your change you better count that twice
The only thing you can count is the men from mice
You're about to deal with the myth, the legend
Nice with the the fist but now I reach for the weapon
They put the meth in the method, the sess in the essence
Talk but they step in the presence
Scorin' points on the court, they was trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple-double
Best there ever was, best there ever will be
Blindfolds on when the squad's in the building
Jon Snow, a song of fire and ice
The marksmen are nice and they're firing right
Can't look me in the eye, reciting your lies
You fuckin' kidding me, now the squad take you out your misery (brrap)

From the front to the back bullets over the track
From the firing squad (hey)
No a vest ain't special, it can't protect
From the firing squad (hey)
You can hear us coming but there ain't no running
From the firing squad (hey)
Do as you're told, put on the blindfold
It's the firing squad

What you gonna say when I'm up in your face
And then what happens next is how you react?
What you gonna do when the room closing in
And then all you can see is a mountain of black?

From Philadelphia PA
That's a hook you can cook, bitch
A.B. Aboriginal
Always all that
Always black

It's a cool Saturday night
Drive around leanin' on the passenger side
Ya not feelin' these sounds you can get the fuck out
Sorry, I'm nice but I'm never polite

Roll with 2 T's like I'm Malcolm Little
Don't know what your dad does: Malcolm in the Middle
I made a phone call to Scuba Steve
And he let me know he gonna hook up whatever Trigga needs
King T, couldn't get a bigger G
Swiggin Alkaholik and Trigga got a bigger tree
If they ain't high you could'a fooled me
Stogie on the dash and the purp on the front seat
That's the shotgun, 'fraid not son
And you can't sit there if you ain't got one
If you want some get some if ya bad enough take some
Oh no? Then get the fuck out the way cuz

You know, we eating, you know, we eating
You know, we eating, we feasting!
You know, we eating, you know, we eating
You know, we eating, we feasting!
We stay eating, you stay starving
You stay mad while we stay laughing

My nigga Trials (yeah) Briggs (yeah)
What's happening? A.B.ORIGINAL
It's the Likwit, check it

It's another west coast swig and I'm pulling up with Briggs
With no more fucks to give, I'm a hub city nightmare right there Standing with the Likwit
Locked in with A.B.ORIGINAL, they the business
I'm so solid I eliminate frolics
Call it what you call it, it's the gangsta Alkaholik
TRUST That ol green, KUSH no seeds
A different type of cloth I'm cut, that ol' creed
Man these ho's ain't knowing I'm a show 'em
King still trifling, Likwit still flowing
Blowing on nothing but the best, fuck stress
Show ya how to rock it from Australia to the west
Turn down for what? A nigga'll sleep
When he rest in peace In other words deceased
Till that part I'ma just beast
And kick back with Trials and Briggs and just feast

You know, we eating, you know, we eating
You know, we eating, we feasting!
You know, we eating, you know, we eating
You know, we eating, we feasting!
We stay eating, you stay starving
You stay mad while we stay laughing

Well it's a hot, hot Sunday, blowing hydro in the breeze
Never wore a watch cos I got nowhere to be
With a scuba tank, hooked it up directly to the hoobastank
Hooked up by Scuba Steve rolling with that super dank
Dabbled in the dab, so fucken sticky
Couldn't pack it in a bag (let that bitch breath)
Then I'm in it till its finished, snap like a mousetrap
If I don't get it then I'm bench-pressing house cats
(A.B.ORIGINAL) Handle the difference
The illest black villain since Lando Calrissian
And hand over fist I break bricks with my paws
Roll the weed at warp speed while I listen to the sword
Keep bouncing magician with the marijuana
Dropped the bomb in megaton dutching out my power armour
With my squad large, leaping over cop cars
Inside a hydroponic shop to put a pot plant inside a pot plant
And feast

When we connect you know we eat
Daz, Trials, Briggs, King T
Fix a plate and take your seat
Grab a drink and join the feast
When we connect you know we eat

You can see everything that we've done (take a look son)
We come and we take what we want (take your )

In TAFE you was the man homie (once upon a time)
Then nothing went to plan homie (nothin', you a bitch)
Like a stint in the casting couch you went from arse to mouth

I said damn homie
You walkin' on my fuckin' land homie (my land)
You better jump back in the van homie (get the fuck back in it)
Or else I need to see at least an even couple fuckin' grand homie

Man I ain't even high
But I'll try 'cause I like to fly
And I'm all that, why? 'Cause I'm the type of guy
To get up in ya, like a fuckin' jalape√±o

Yeah we bossed it, pedigree dog shit, we got this
Even if you had it like a habit man you lost it
I'm blackin' out, like a Pacquiao
In the afternoon, hit saloons in my karma suit
Faded

Read a palm or two when I hit you
We the Marmadukes, you Shih Tzus
And you should be alarmed
We rocking Obama proof armour suits
You bitch you

BRIGGS: Excellent. And um... when you hear a record like the record we put together..
ARCHIE ROACH: Ah, it gave me goosebumps. It's strong, like, you know? Gets your blood up. It's real; it's today. You know? We, we, we marched down the street back in the 70s, 80s, 70s. We marched for land right, we marched for land rights, you know? We walked down the street to Melbourne. We brought that city to a stand-still. We had 2000, and we wouldn't move until we were ready because there's still rights  land and so many others things. And listening to your album it just reminds me so much of the old days. And it brings back that time when we did pump our fists in the air because you had to be, you had to be in their face. You had to be in their face

They got the A.V.O. on the A.B.O
They still play the joints on the radio
Now the A.T.O tryna find me (come get it)
Was ballin' too hard, now they're tryna fine me
I never took a handout (never), I took the mans route
Now I'm what the fans demand like, ""Who the man now?""
Eighty-seven  caught 'em with their pants down
Twenty-sixth of Jan, ain't it funny how it panned out?
Took that advance for the new album
I took that advance and bought the used Falcon (it's a piece of shit)
We got the whole world captivated
Rapper's emasculated, word is they want me decapitated
'Cause they can't see me head on
I bring flames to their face till their hair gone
They got their hands up, but never shoot a fair one
Talkin' blackball, but where's their pair gone?

Yo, the chronic got me feeling delphonic (yeah)
The first hit I'm understanding all the planets, by the second I forgot it
They can polish on my sack while I'm dumpin'
While I'm being fed eggs by girls with bodies like buttered up pumpkins
They stay dominated by fear
If you see us coming, guarantee we're closer than we may appear
While you bitch about your bullshit (my brother that's lazy)
If there's booty in  (motherfucker that's )
They ballin' on a budget, 
Ball so big you can't detect him with that 
No doubt, line 'em up and I'ma take 'em out
While I'm tryna find a place they serve my type like a paper-route
And even if the weed's shit, man, I still smoke it
I tap it like the dunny door's locked but still open
If you're not already rappin', what happened? I wouldn't join today
I wish 'em well and watch 'em throwin' all their coins away

Turn that flag to a noose, put a cease to your breathin'

To make us want to celebrate anything but survival?

I remember all the blood and what carried us (I remember)
They remember twenty recipes for lamingtons (yum)
Yeah, their ancestors got a boatride
Both mine saw them comin' until they both died
f** celebratin' days made of misery (f** that)
