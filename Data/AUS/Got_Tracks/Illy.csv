6 Shooter,Bring It Back,2012,"Yo, this joint right here is dedicated to all the motherfuckers who fell off (yeah)
And the motherfuckers who’s about to fall off

It's uh Mr 'If The-If The City Had A'
Turn the bass up till the place jump and the window shatter
Miss me with the banter, my man, I been a factor
The benefactor with ink - your man's the missing chapter
Phizzle, this a banger
, Illy let's get it cracking
Twist the fabric of time with a rhyme, my style is systematic
I scribble something so ill you wish that you didn’t catch it
Twist a fat one and sprinkle this here with a little magic
When you and your friends rhyme it's bedtime, I'm snoring
Whether or not I headline, yes I’m supporting
Flavour drip through the speaker when I’m recording
If charisma’s a disease I could be dead by the morning
My man, we are the entire fuck out here
Lights up, Ryan's up, fire up the sound gear
Been accused of the recklessness but I don’t dispute the evidence
I just reload the clip and shoot the messenger

Hey it's that bloke from the water’s edge
One stroke gets your daughter wet
You're getting served like you haven’t ordered yet
I score a rep by putting verses in the morgue
Till my services are more sought after than a whore’s
I’m getting plenty buddy, how you getting yours?
I’m getting paid the pen and page, add a little more
We smack a stage till it needs to be restored
And I do this shit because I love it not because I’m bored
Moved away from Beauy but it’s pumping through my heart
Now I represent the Frankston line and going fucking hard
Aiming for the stars, been rolling from the start
Now I’m sharing tracks with motherfuckers holding golden plaques
Braithwaite Steeze, Wild animal mentality
And haters getting mad at rappers doubling their salary
They’re talking shit, I ain’t hearing what they telling me
The colour that they seeing's greener than a stick of celery
Celery

Yeah
Introductions aside, you askin' who am I?
I’m the owner of a gallery, your tour guide
And you can leave with stained shirts
'Cause tryna understand how my brain works is suicide
I got a beautiful mind covered in sewer slime
And if you look a little closer there’s a clue inside
To get past the putrid grime like few have tried
Then you could possibly ruin your eyes
Am I crazy? You decide
All I know is my rhymes are so pimped that I write them in a suit and tie
I’m Superman flying through the sky
But you guys wouldn’t recognise a hero in a new disguise
Life’s like shooting the dice or gambling
But you just rambling, standing with your hand on the mic
I ain’t battling an amateur, get your calibre right
I’ll leave you pussies afraid like you’re Hannibal’s wife

Check the floodgates (what) that door needs closing shut
They’re like a fuckface in porn scenes, I know they suck
Put ‘em on parole so they can walk free to go get fucked
Get your own style 'cause y'all seem to be clones of us
With no character, boring stoner cunts
It’s so embarrassing, it’s like the Portuguese showing up
The Spanish with Brazil, the whole East is owned by us
I have 'em crashing at will like torpedoes blowing up (boom)
Hit the battleship and all fleets that floated sunk
Quicker than a cattle whip on raw meat drove to cuts
The prodigal son, since fourteen token bud
Still tropical sun with tall trees and coconuts
My art sells for peanuts like poor street folk that busk
The Cartel Team bust with more heat than smoking guns (blam)
One of the finest, If you fought me you only just survived if you’re Irish
Four-leaf clover luck

Uh
If you were gifted then it must have been a lump of coal
But still you’re full of yourself like one of them Russian dolls
If you’re shooting for the top you should adjust the goals
If I walked a mile in your shoes it would crush my soul
Saw you live, who would pay though to book yah?
If you tried to get some girls there then they overlooked yah
Men, men, men like that lame show with Kutcher
Total sausage fest like a trade show for butchers
Uh, this is Adelaide talking, I’m an animal coursing
Through my preys, natural habitat stalking
Just hungry, if there’s beef then I’m jabbing my fork in
At the mere fuckin' mention of a battle they walking
And if not then they got more than your standard death wish
Weird, most of them are sweeter than a candy necklace
Always got something left to write like I was ambidextrous (
yeah
)
And if my music’s declined. how come my fans accept it? (
yo
)

Chopping up with blunt papes, rocking with a verse
Hopping off the runway, dropping in a 
vert
Either way I’m rolling, optimal at worst
You ain’t seeing me unless you got binoculars at work (bi-atch)
But don’t get mad about it, be a man about it
Chin up, it's brand-spanking steeze, hand back the hand-me-downers
Swap those rhymes and swallow pride
They still paying dues off 'em on borrowed time
And cue my flows monsoon shit
You pals dog food, barking up the wrong eucalypt
Six-shooters, grip mics
We see red and blast like a hoover crip
Higher than thread counts on your goose-down dooners, bitch
It's big kahuna shit, and I ain’t heard of you
Small fries in big towns, man up or sit down
Mercenary spits, hired guns on the disc, bound
To kill by the contract, and keep putting hits out",https://genius.com/Illy-6-shooter-lyrics
98 Bulls Freestyle,Friday Flips: Season 3,2020,"Fuck your thirty-for-thirty, I'm one-on-one
Givin' off rope, puttin' opponents in double dutch
Singular focus, triple threat from the jump
Too much drive to fade away in these Nike dumps
Eat rappers for breakfast, songwriters for lunch
Catch up, go hard in the pain and the clutch
Letter lane, got my lane, pass, school me to your game, pass
Yeah, I'll pass on everything but the bump
Game tired, strong D, mean offence
Wannabes playin', go please, you ain't top ten
Couple seasons past beginner's luck
A few multi-plat, beyond givin' a fuck
Yeah, these monsters nonsense, your beast modes?
I don't see those, I guess you're lochness
I'm stopped in on free throws, got hits, yeah, heaps of those
Franchise player, take the loss on the gym
But keep goin', better devil, the one you know
How you tall poppies? Your statch shorter than Muggsy Bogues
Please, I'm all ears, no lie
I'm Paul Pierce on the mic, no question, I'm AI
Losin' don't compute me and Bluff, ally oup
I will not rest long as there's shots left to shoot
Play ball, man, I'm on my best, when it's war
Ain't no run I test, I run press, I am not impressed
Don the ones for the title defense
Brushed every rival's advance, they hide at the bench
Pushed it up inside of they heads, fuck walls over beds
I'ma posterise your life, tryna follow me steps
Me vers a whole world seem fit
'Cause in a fair one, you're lost before a ball been kicked
Yeah, y'all wouldn't know what longevity is
Empires rise and fall but legacies live

Pick your role, either be inside it or be inspired
Push peers to leave, retire or reach higher
Process of desire, one
Two, three
Stay three steps ahead before I bounce; travel
Only final scores count; actual
All star, bring that all razzle dazzle
Make things complicated now
Better skate, boy, never catch me on a break, boy
No pool table to sink an eight, boy
Up late, no weight can bake, this a cakewalk
Man, all my joints got 808s, boy
Teen work, make the dream work, listen
I still put my town on my back, who I lent it
They go for my lane, ashamed, the shoes ain't fit 'em
Since all they songs got my footprints in 'em
Play their game to my image, Jerry West
I will not lose, nah, Jigga said it best
Try to catch an L, try again, add apostrophe S
I do me thing, nothing but net
I love this game, stay afloat as the currents change
Let's go, what's another ring?
Man, it's like Jordan to the magic
They only champions of the East in my absence
I got the league shook off the crossover
Got high, got Js, SEA, got Nova
Live from where you'd rather be, no Corona
No to wolves or my timber, Minnesota
I hit the coat of NXL
I never ask nothin' I don't demand of myself
Rather be the bag out the leaders and stand as fell
'Cause history's written by what winners tell, like",https://genius.com/Illy-98-bulls-freestyle-lyrics
All The Above,Bring It Back,2012,"Yo, allow me to introduce, allow me to redirect your views
Allow me to reconnect the roots, ready shoot
Stick and move, flicking ciggies at the suits
I got too much soul to be fitting in them boots
Could be the love of lifestyle, rhyme or coin
But whether I'm here to light, write or buy the joint
The fuck you sweating on my final choice
Aussie rules baby, fact is, my goals is beside the point
You dig? I'm deep, they shovel you shit by the week
We speak, we mean something, they sheep, they just bleat
The chase and foreverlutionaries link
We steady the ship, these motherfuckers look ready to sink
And elsewhere, i'll see that they dealt fair
Beat 'em in life, die, meet 'em in hell, and beat 'em as well there
Can I get a hell yea (hell yea)
Fuck bel air, the fresh prince of m e l's in here, and

I ain't in it for the fame, I'm in it for the love
I ain't into getting framed, I ain't into getting cuffed
Y'all already know the name, we came get it done
This is dope, fresh, fly shit, all the above

Ayo it's obvious
There's plenty of half wits that are more popular
But ain't too many artists that could open up your oculars
Yo what it is
Went from anonymous to eponymous to bombing shit
To this posish where ain't nobody stopping us
All aboard the rocket ship
I'm taking y'all to outer space
I display astounding grace while haters eating sour grapes
This is for my people feeling out of place
I'm working on another album mate so grab your calendar and count the days
Time's ticking on simpleton rhyme spitters
The wickedest bi-linguist my lyrics worth five figures
Some people think that it's hard to define brilliance
But I find the definition reflected in my mirror
Don't mean to brag and boast
But we're ripping the maddest quotes
The difference 'tween a panadol and sniffing on a gram of coke
Consider this the antidote to the anti-dope
Kicking cannon balls at ya cantaloupe now adios yo I'm a ghost

I ain't in it for the fame, I'm in it for the love
I ain't into getting framed, I ain't into getting cuffed
Y'all already know the name, we came get it done
This is dope, fresh, fly shit, all the above

Up and at 'em, my body nothing but a vessel
Use to wonder what would happen
Once the dust had come to settle
But for now I'll probably down a couple red bulls
Help a brother butter up his mental
And rush in another schedule
I'm running amongst the madness, rusty has-beens
Asking ""who's that fucker Tuka? Snatchy, he raps in funny accents""
Wants some monkey magic
Suck on my banana
While I fly on carpets
Munging cactus with my pack of mayan shamans
Lion hearted, enlighten darknesss, my mind is universal
Catch me chatting with tiny martians
In hybrid human circles, my life's a music journal
Inspired by buddha sticks and stupid shit
I'm kinda quirky, like a stanley kubrick flick
(The voice of god) I join the dots
Like manuva and tuna fish, who is it?
Holler at your boy, get in tune with it
Dropped it like it's nuclear, I'm getting suited up
Thundakats and Illy
 on smash from here to Jupiter

I ain't in it for the fame, I'm in it for the love
I ain't into getting framed, I ain't into getting cuffed
Y'all already know the name, we came get it done
This is dope, fresh, fly shit, all the above",https://genius.com/Illy-all-the-above-lyrics
Am Yours,Cinematic,2013,"How do I even start?
Like, where do you start this?
I don't know

I'm only starting to understand it
I apologise if I'm running late
But it's so easy to miss the magic
When you're seeing it every day
And if I ever took that for granted
Well the hard times caught me out
Because we got it down, no matter how, you held it down
How'd you do that?
Cause you're the warmth in my embrace
And you're the heart that got my heart beating
And I don't know your ways
I'm just thankful I'm there to see them
And I don't know how you're so amazing
And I'll probably never understand
So I wrote this song to let you knowhow proud I am of you
And mum I hope you know its all us
You're beyond compare
I could lay my whole soul bare
Long as you're right there I know I'm in luck
And I love you so much, tell you all the time
But sometimes all the time still don't seem like its enough
No, I am here forever
I am here forever, I am here forever
I am yours forever, I am yours

Haven't heard dad cry more than a handful of times in my life
So that tearful phone call where we both broke down still burns right hot in my mind
Long nights, scared sleepless
Through your hospital stage where our whole world fell apart
You never blinked, just let it pass
I'll never ask you how'd you do that
Cause I don't even need the answer
Its just a miracles work I guess
How you stare in the face of cancer
Fight it and never once lose your breath
And for the rest of my days I'm awestruck
And for them all I won't ever forget
That you are still the most beautiful
And you didn't need a hair on your head
How'd you do that
How'd you do that
How'd you do that
How'd you do that
And this is all for you
I am here forever
I am here forever
I am here forever
I am yours forever
I am yours",https://genius.com/Illy-am-yours-lyrics
Ausmusic Medley,Cinematic,2013,"It goes round full circle, yeah, there’s diamonds in the rough
We got a motherfucking earthful
Patience is a virtue, but time's of the essence
As attention spans get shorter
It's hard to drink, must be something in that water
A nationwide celebration of creative sides
So, ain't no surprise if you make the time
Man, it's amazing what you may just find
Whatever flavour you like
Take your pick, bars, guitars, serato from far and wide
The artists from our own backyard here to Carry on tradition
Looking up at the stars, saying
""One day we’re gonna be where they are,"" and
You wait till tomorrow
You wait till tomorrow
That well-worn routine shows that you reap what you sow
So those seeds gonna grow
Get dope, get unearthed and leave home for the road
And as what the seasons change, ebb and flow
New crops fall in love with the people in the front row
Right? Now I know something 'bout that
I was a fresh faced seventeen, snuck in the back
I couldn’t buy you a round, but I could jump with the pack
What a great night, thank Pressure and Suffa for that
Under the surface, a scene bubbled and hissed
Too many kings to name, countless others to list
And like that, doors broke and the flood commenced
And now our hip hop's all up in this bitch
Watched a fresh style be bedded in the psyche
Of the general mass by gentlemen just like me
Every unlikely leader, was getting live (if it's your flavour)
If it's your flavour, celebrate it beside me because
My happiness is slowly creeping back
(Why's that?) Just gotta listen to the song, bro
I found it off my head with my friends in the front row
And I looked around, the faces I’d know
I fell in love with the people in the front row
And I looked around, the faces I’d know
I fell in love with the people in the front row
Now don’t get it twisted, the gigs didn’t teeth it
It's been here for years, shhh, that’s our little secret
Now, it might not have gave birth to a genre
But it found its feet in between rehearsals and encores
Soon enough, tours done for
And then it's back to the lab again, the pen and pad again
For soul and glory, word to Paul
We love those great tellers of Australian stories, right
And he said since I left you
I know, not somebody that I used to
Leave lonely, she said better be home soon
Or something’s gotta give
Man, it's the tale of the travelling musician
She knew, but still struggled with the distance
And he wished a big jet plane could take her with him
'Cause it's always better when she's near
He was shaking in his seat, riding through the street
From a Virgin flight, to her
Shaking in his seat, riding through the streets
To Newtown and straight to her door
To her door
To her door
To her door
And so it goes full circle, as those stories of yesteryear
Give way and the next appear
No less revered, nah, they’re treasured as legend here
But new diamonds in the rough make their presence clear
And all they want in this life is the chance to do their thing
But who got next can wait, I got now, I say
I want the top, top, top, top, top, top
All my people in the back of the spot
I want the top, top, top, top, top, top
If you know me you don’t know me to stop
I want the top, top, top, top, top, top
All my people in the back of the spot, let off a shot
Bringing that knife through butter flow out
Got summer sewn round my pinkie
One, two, won’t suffer no clowns
Didn’t know then, they about to know now
We run this shit like the buses broke down, huh
Now that’s one for the kids
Two for the stories, three for the gigs
Four for the right now and it don’t stop
When Cinematic drop, bets off
I said I want the top
I want the top, top, top, top, top, top
All my people in the back of the spot
I want the top, top, top, top, top
If you know me you don’t know me to stop
I want the top, top, top, top, top
All my people in the back of the spot, let off a shot",https://genius.com/Illy-ausmusic-medley-lyrics
"Back, Back, Forward",Bring It Back,2012,"Yeah, you what they say
Everything's gotta start somewhere, right
Well that's what this shit's about
In order to get to wherever we're going
We gotta go back, way back, like
Back in time

We going back, back, forward
Always looking past where I brought it
The choice is yours, you can let it pass
Or take part, regardless, this is where it starts
We going back, back, forward (We're going back to get forward)
Always looking past where I brought it
This choice is yours, you can let it pass
(Always remembering and always being ahead)
Or take part, regardless, this is where it starts
(So shut up and listen, yeah)

Before it’s performed, and before it’s released
Before it’s recorded, before it’s written, before I scored the beat
Before the emails back and forth, hassling Trigga
For whatever heat, The Quickening ain’t need
Before sold out tours, where the runs on the board
Got it looking like I never been bowled out before
And sure, it’s before daughters and sisters and Mrs nationwide
Caught a glimpse and turned vicious, uh
Before listeners dissed 'cause the kids had a run
That’d leave Usain Bolt in the dust
Going three years young, what I’ve done with The Chase
The whole country embraced, they still rapping to their mates
So that love turned hate, when this unknown punk
Turned famed and it happened at an unheard rate
But before they lay blame, put ‘em up on this
Before they gave a fuck what I did, I been doing it

We going back, back, forward
Always looking past where I brought it
The choice is yours, you can let it pass
Or take part, regardless, this is where it starts
We going back, back, forward (yeah, yeah)
Always looking past where I brought it (right, right)
This choice is yours, you can let it pass (so )
Or take part, regardless, this is where it starts (yeah)

Before hitting my bed, after driving from Tullamarine
Before a flight spent trying to sleep
Before lying in the lounge, waiting on a plane
Still higher than the clouds looking out through the window pane
Before check in, packing, dressing
Before sitting in the shower for like half an hour
Before our tour manager is banging on my door (fuck off!)
Waking me up, before I pass out blind drunk
Before shot after shot after whatever the fuck
Punters got for me, cut for me, crushed or rolled up for me
Before I step off stage, before I kill it for an hour straight
Before Cam hits the first snare, and we away
For the set, before I pray, before I stretch
Before I chase straight vodka with the redbull that’s left
It’s just three motherfuckers sitting backstage
Hungover like “I swear I ain’t drinking again”, so

We going back, back, forward
Always looking past where I brought it
The choice is yours, you can let it pass
Or take part, regardless, this is where it starts (where it starts, man)
We going back, back, forward (yeah)
Always looking past where I brought it (and this is where it's goin')
This choice is yours, you can let it pass (check it out)
Or take part, regardless, this is where it starts (yeah)

Before I’m gone, before I’m old
Before I’m big into classical and twilight strolls
Before I retire, fuck it, before I’m hired
Before milestones acquired, in my time in this rap shit
Before my business man’s on, before they try and market this shit as a brand, stop
Before my whole damn camp’s on
Known as the Frankston Line Champ
And each fan thanked by hand, before
The whole future has come
I’ll be chilling right here writing raps in tune with the drum
The truth hard to swallow when you don’t chew once
Still hungry, dummies saying I already blew up
Nah, you don’t believe me, watch
I got the next decade locked, by doing what I’ve done from the dot
So before I start talking like somebody I’m not
To please other’s I'ma be in a box, like peace out (peace!)

We going back, back, forward
Always looking past where I brought it
Yeah man
The choice is yours, you can let it pass
Or take part, regardless, this is where it starts
(It's up to you, what you wanna do man?)
We going back, back, forward
Always looking past where I brought it (gotta start somewhere like)
This choice is yours, you can let it pass
Or take part, regardless, this is where it starts (so let me know, yeah)
We going back, back, forward (yeah, dude)
Always looking past where I brought it
This choice is yours, you can let it pass ( back to go forward)
Or take part, regardless, this is where it starts
(Trigga Trials on the beat)
We going back, back, forward (Illy Al on the mic)
Always looking past where I brought it (like that)
This choice is yours, you can let it pass
Or take part, regardless, this is where it starts",https://genius.com/Illy-back-back-forward-lyrics
Before I Leave,,2007,"[Verse 1 - Drapht:]
Define me like a lion defines a whole jungle
Definition of street and humble
Like Bruce Lee in Rumble in the Bronx
Summoned to the tops like we just stumbled across
Rapunzel's locks ahh, whatever Barney Gumble gots
I want it, Plutonic blaze, hitting harder than bubonic
Plague a convict, confiscate
Record to take the weight off like Fonda's tapes
Everyone's like Charlie Chapplin
And Tom Cruise is acting like Michael Jackson
It's crazy, maybe the global warming
Or maybe, just the famous are falling
Call me Pauly Polter, roll in a six
White like a polar bear stare a solar eclipse
Kick the goal like kids switch kick flipping the rock and roll
On top of the bowl, that's control

[Hook - All:]
It's Obese, here to leave impressions
Beathedz, bring the heat relentless
Crooked eye, bout to speak the essence
""I came too far not to be respected""

[Verse 2 - Illy:]
Before I leave, I'm setting benchmarks each release
Rock, debut drop retiree and every disc between
And I'm a be seen with at least one Veronica sitting on a beach
Sipping something sweet, somewhere in the tropics
Fat wallet in my deep pockets
For now I got no cash, no smash hit
Just dash and tip the next shit, no slash, no Asterix
When the champagne bottles pop, victory cigars lit
I'll leave my classics and an arse to kiss
You believe the cheek of this kid?
Believing nobody out equal this except a few at the top
Before he hit the door, I thought I'd drop a send off fit for a boss
I'm on a track with Pegz, so that's one less task left
On my list to address, before I leave

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Patto:]
Before I leave, I want a house with no lease
And bed down with a fatter momma than obese
Drunk in the streets, running a muck
Junk hanging out the front like a Peking duck
Pump mad weights, get large as hell
So I can hang around with pussy like Gargamle
From getting blow once a year like a birthday candle
To getting more chicks than Heffner can handle
Moved from Coburg to Coburg North
From a bedroom house, to a house with a porch
Get mad rich, make a smash hit song
And be the first in the charts that won't feature Akon
Go triple plat with best rap tune
Collect my award in an Adidas bapsuit
It it's all bad and my plan turns shitty
At least they can say that he rocked burn city

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Pegz:]
Yeah
I thought I knew the difference, between the music business
And gay rappers break dancing on Euro Vision
But who will listen to somebody with a shoe addiction?
Living with their mums, talking about their crew is pimping
Spinal tap with laptops and final scratch
This is for my real DJ's bringing the vinyl back
On a diamond back, with a biker's patch
20 inch biceps, covered in tribal tats
Chasing hits like a junkie ho
One dole day, walking down Studley Road
Got a beautiful mind and a heart of gold
But you don't want to push me around like Russell Crowe
Not a role model, Godfather that's not me
If I touch a few souls that's extraordinary
But all I want is respect, before I leave
Paying homage to the New York streets
Come on

Bills, Friday Flips: Season 2,2015,"[Intro: Illy & 
LunchMoney Lewis
]
Friday Flips, Friday Flips
Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn, goddamn
Goddamn this song
Oh man, oh man, oh man
, oh man
Let's give it a shot, Nic!

I got bills
I got bills
Bills, bills
Work, work
Bills, bills
Goddamn, goddamn, work, work
Bills
Oh man, oh man, I got

Yeah
Yeah, money in the trunk
Pockets so deep, ain't dug in them for months (nope)
Nah, Wednesday's still a hump (yep)
Hungry as fuck, tummy like a krump
Yeah, I been eating rappers for lunch
Still eating rappers for lunch
But these lightweights don't seem to get my calories up
And I don't share drinks, yeah boom, no punch

I got bills I gotta pay
So I'm gon' work, work, work everyday (everyday, everday)
I got mouths I gotta feed
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats
I got bills

Look man, I could school bookworms (true)
Every rapper I welcomed took Burns (true)
Drop punted, jumped into this foot-first
Truth hurts, I'm as Melbourne as hook turns
Can't care less what the government says
Demented, push back every time Telstra presses
Had a paid plan, guess I messed it up
Charlie, no XCX's
Been three months of phone calls, SMS's
Mailbox full, think they get the message
And no matter how fuckin' read the text is
I'm still not shook on collection letters
Like, ""Dear Mr Police, thanks for the fine
Top of the garbage, back of the mind
Take me to court, happily oblige
See you in six months, actually psych""
That was my way through a lot
Now they pull me over, I'm payin' on the spot
I give a fuck what the neighbourhood wants
Want this bass down? Take it up with the cops
What's the point if we can't get a vibe
 when did sick cunts get marginalised?
Man is magic, hit targets in life
Just a part of the price and I got

Bills I gotta pay
So I'm gon' work work work everyday (everyday, everyday)
I got mouths I gotta feed
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats
I got bills

Yo, special shoutout to Nic Martin for making this beat something crazy. And all you rappers talkin' like you got no bills

You ain't here to talk shop, get the hell out
Everyone so quick to say sellout
But the back catalogue's full of sweet shit
And a whole lotta pimpin' themselves in the mailout
Still, they talkin' harder than club bouncers
Dummies throw steel bars through the glass houses
Till they tire them arms out, let your guard down
Then we barge round and go Rick James all over your white couch
We kill shit, and every  from the past vouches
And I'm hardly for narcissists
The same way these arseholes are hardly for artists
Stay out the , they are the martyrs
It's as if a decade ain't passed us
It's as if my rhymes aren't so fat
That you don't hear the net weight then gasp, mate, you asked
Gone off-topic
Half-cocked it, you scissor, bitch, I rock it
This isn't for giggles and shits
It's honest work, boy, got a pocket, 'cause I got bills
[Chorus (Extended): LunchMoney Lewis & 
Illy
]
I, I, I got
Bills
I got bills
Bills, work, work
Bills, goddamn, goddamn
Work, work
Bills, oh man, oh man
Look, I got bills
Mama got bills (everybody got fuckin' bills, man)

What it's all about""
""Nah, y'all  hear me""

Yeah
Step in the gridlock blastin' Aussie hip-hop
I'd rather listen to Hilltop's than Kid Rock
Watch Chris Pop? I'd rather sit on my arse
Swiggin' a Draught in Windsor Park laughin' at Tin Dog
Ain't ill, next to who? I'm yet to met the dude
They go an extra mile, I go an extra few
Since in utero the flow super soak
Pistol Pete meet Bazooka Joe, I'm Rufio
To the pack, locked in a lab, my studio tan
Got my face white as Kabuki's with a nose full of brat
Heard the meek inherit the Earth, but for what it's worth
I'ma strong-arm this shit till I'm six foot in dirt
With raised middle fingers, big game winners
Burn City born, bred, goin' nowhere in a
Hurry motherfucker, Illy Al Murray motherfucker
Obese, Crooked Eye in this bitch, like what

Black cap, hoodie on my back
Obese on the track, we got it like that
And I'm ready for war, my words are my weaponry
Step to me ("" hear me"")
Black cap, hoodie on my back
Obese on the track, we got it like that
And I'm ready for war, my words are my weaponry
Step to me

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're cold chillin', we're cryogenically frozen
Waitin' till your motherfuckin' mind's ready to open
Pegz and Illy, the biochemistry's woven
Hypothetically killin' the rhymes of any opponent
You know I worked from the bottom up
And turned my life round from the start I got
From emergin'  to Burn philosopher
With verses strong enough for virgin polymer
I dropped science in theology class
Like, ""How long will the motherfuckin' novelty last
Before knowledge is born, autonomy scars?""
The new jack give 'em polygraphs, wobbly arms
Comin' off like another self-righteous zealot
Never worked a day, singin' ""fight the power""
Gettin' paid in records to paid by the hour
Now I write the cheques to sign the talent, come on!

And I'm ready for war, my words are my weaponry

What's goin' down around town, what?""

""What's goin' down around town, what?""

Bring It Back,Bring It Back,2012,"Yeah, we're losing 'em, the call rang out
Only a few ran for helping hands, most dudes stared blankly
Standing mute, fame whores off where the new fad's at
While fans cried ""bring that boom bap back""
Saw lines crossed between hip-hop dudes and dance acts
So I U-turned my arse out the booth
Told my label, new plan I'ma take it to my roots
With the new jam after that resume programming
So I gathered beats, got at MC's, mapped the strategy out
The chase sequel's in the background for now, sorry
A little longer until that album's out
Doubters can either back down, tap out or bounce
Either way, pay that no mind, our two cents bound to count
Uh, their two cents get rounded down
Uh, this for the love of the rap
Breath it life 'til our lungs collapse, and bring it back like that

It's like that, heard 'em saying ""bring it back""
Screaming (breathe motherfucker) like that, see the flash
Of the ambulance lights and the sirens on smash
Like (woop woop), and they like (woop woop) and they like that
Like that, heard 'em saying ""bring it back""
Screaming (breathe motherfucker) like that, see the flash
Of the ambulance lights and the sirens on smash
Like (woop woop) and they like (woop woop) and they like that

I'd be lying if I said this wasn't to serve
As to remind and alert your mates
I have returned, tighter
Harder better faster stronger, vying for the first
Had to decide on the circuit
Took a ride on a detour
To tie up any loose wires, inspired to work
By the words of those sayings I lost my nerve
So if you wonder why this music ain't my usual sound
I needed shit to do in my time out
I'm dropping records in between rounds
This a break in play, I'm of the court, beating them at their game
But this more than a training sesh for the main event
Sparring hard with the nation's best, even a day's rest
Is still at a breakneck pace too much to bear for the brain-dead
Tear through the pain threshold, fuck a taste setter, fuck a pay-cheque
This for the love of the rap
Hit it hard, clean up my act, then flip and relapse, bring it back

It's like that, heard 'em saying ""bring it back""
Screaming (breathe motherfucker) like that, see the flash
Of the ambulance lights and the sirens on smash
Like (woop woop), and they like (woop woop) and they like that
Like that, heard 'em saying ""bring it back""
Screaming (breathe motherfucker) like that, see the flash
Of the ambulance lights and the sirens on smash
Like (woop woop) and they like (woop woop) and they like that

And you fucked up young guns, I like you but you're crazy
Two-year Facebook careers don't entitle you
To write about your haters, I'm two-fifty shows deep in the majors
So it's real life when I talk status
Ain't saying I'm the saviour, just saying I'm invested
In whatever's coming later I just ask you be creative
Foundations were laid, we just building other layers
Of design spec's for a sky scraper
We started on a higher plane thanks to pioneers that were able
To break doors down for us
So love thy neighbour
Bet the house on it, they sent our music through the roof
Some jealous, some overzealous, out to wet the fuse
Just know better than to let a clown effect your view
Only fools get influenced by the loudest in the room
So uh, ignore that, this for the love of the rap
And in order to advance where we at, we gotta bring it back
We gotta bring it back!

It's like that, heard 'em saying ""bring it back""

Catch 22,Two Degrees,2016,"And stay, stay, stay, another round
'Cause who wants to live forever?
Who wants to burn it down?
Down, down, down, down
And we can paint the town
'Cause who wants to sing the blues?
So some you win or some you lose
It's all a catch-22

Yeah, I could be getting old, but I'm getting round
Call it immature, sure, but hear me out
'Cause the only thing promised is the here and now
If we didn't live it up, never live it down, yeah
And when I jump I hold on, I'm like, ""Oh my Lord""
If it all goes wrong then it's all my fault
Man, some just want to watch your world burn
But some on the straight and narrow lost first turn, so
Before you play, take a page of my own advice
It's all a game, know the price when you roll the dice
And what's the rush man? Nowhere else to go tonight
And we ain't getting out on time, let alone alive
The choice is yours, your down for the cause
Be hated or adored, but never ignored
And whatever card you draw you can't win them all
So leave the sad songs at the door, get involved and

And stay, stay, stay, another round
'Cause who wants to live forever?
Who wants to burn it down?
Down, down, down, down
And we can paint the town
'Cause who wants to sing the blues?
So some you win or some you lose
It's all a catch-22
It's all a catch-22

Oh, you're not happy where you at heart, fuck it off then
Just make it not for nothing when you cut your losses
You haven't got it made, but you got your options
Ditch smokes for sleep, ditch shots for crossfit
What you tryna live longer? Take a bow
What's the point of all those years if you spend them missing out?
Some of it's worth the risk, hoping you don't forget
Bad as the world can get none of it's permanent
So no politics or parties, even if
We solving world problems with our lager on our lips
And for all the easy ways out, the harder that it gets
Now isn't that ironic? No Alanis Morissette
We a hard act to follow, pouring the bottle
YOLO the motto, could all end tomorrow
Set your watch fast, stay ahead of your time
If you wait, might never arrive, that's the vibe so

And stay, stay, stay, another round
'Cause who wants to live forever?
Who wants to burn it down?
Down, down, down, down
And we can paint the town
'Cause who wants to sing the blues?
So some you win or some you lose
It's all a catch-22
It's all a catch-22
It's all a catch-22

Man all over the world they're pumping our tunes
From where you'd rather be, say it's unfair then come here dude
'Cause each hour the sun's setting somewhere new
Get fly, fuck a commute
At least for now 'cause real life can fuck up you're view
And real life, gon' be back all up in it soon
It ain't perfect, but all's said, what can you do
This is love and the truth
And I ain't waiting to see it on the tube
Stress, darken, mood, let a little sunlight through
Sometimes life's a mad dash, sometimes a cruise
But some day you find there ain't no time to lose
Stamps in the passport, man on the move
World in the palm of my hand, and parts on my shoes
Yeah, you gotta pardon a dude
I'm just settling in to my groove, young world, check it out

Let the good times soar, happiness fly
The fuck I care, never been gravity shy
Happy to land, all a part of the traveller's high
What goes around comes around, exactly right
The same time that we saying have a good night the sun gradually rising
Up in African skies, damn, that'd be nice to check
Next time I guess, map out the flights
Some dreams are worth not checking out tags for the price
And, for all life's riches, still some you can't buy
And you might not realise when living out of packed bags
And lunch is steamed rice at months at a time
But being young and out in the world, it doesn't come twice
Doesn't have to be done flash to be done right
For real, it just needs to be done, one flight
Is never just one flight when the travel bug bites
See this is for what it is, one world, one life, let's go

Set sail for the other side of the globe
And that was something like thirty five years ago
And my mumma the same, it's in my veins, yeah inside of my flow
So, it shouldn't come as no surprise each time
The opportunities arose, I've been so excited to go
Getting lost, getting found, getting real, getting grown
Going broke, getting home, (huh) live in the now
Live from wherever this bag of bones roams
You never check it you never gonna know, that's the truth
So we set the route, line 'em in a row
Spot by spot, hit 'em, missed flights, smashed phones
Flew the coup, fuck keeping up with the Jones's
Whether with bros or gunning it alone
It's dark shades, checked luggage and runaway clothes
Coming out arrival gates to something unknown, let's go

Cigarettes,The Chase,2010,"He draws out, the cigarette smoke trail spins
Thoughts crowd the room till' it's only him
He feels it, lives for it, spent half a life pushing it forward
What he wouldn't give for it
Saw naysayers put in their places
Feels like he's scaling foothills to greatness
Holding all four aces, he braced for the next few years being some for the ages
No time to heed, pride comes before the fall
For now he shines. all rose, no thorn
Full bloom like his plans fool proof
High noon, sun beaming, spoke too soon
The dark clouds scream towards his door
And a house of cards can't stand in a storm
Wind picked up, sunshine stopped
The world came down with the very first drop

So light me up like a cigarette and just let me burn
Catch fire and burn, catch fire and burn
Light a spark and ignite it
In the dark, so when I'm no more
They'll know I was here, so let me just burn

He still gunning, beaten but refused to be broken
What some call delusional
What others call focus man
He's focused, came back for the re up
Now's not the time to kick back with his feet up
Stands in the rain with his face to the heavens and his arms outstretched from the pain that he let in
World keep kickin' hard, ain't gonna get him
He's willin to fight and die for the path that he heads in
And that's a bittersweet faith
Knowin' highs and lows will come boy but them's the breaks
It's pride it's madness, it's seein' what others can only imagine and then reachin' out to grab it
And sayin ""I can say whatever comes hapens
But I follow my heart goddamn it""
Exposing reality to magic
It's hope, that's all it is
He walked through fire, Its all he came back with, saying

So light me up like a cigarette and just let me burn
Catch fire and burn, catch fire and burn
Light a spark and ignite it
In the dark, so when I'm no more
They'll know I was here, so let me just burn

Come what may some memories fade
But some stay as vivid as the moment they were made
Dreams of the days where he stood like a mountain
It's been a while since then but who's countin'?
He lies awake, lies in wait
For the light of the mornin' to bless him and shine again
Summon the rise of the fallen
Laces tied, comeback trail still walkin'
Lives for it, lifetime on a mish for it man
There ain't thing he didn't give for it
Make a bet til' his last sun sets
He'll be pushin' for the light mate he ain't done yet
Head held high slow danced through his hell
Still a point there gotta prove to himself
And, the beat drops same songs on next
So he sparks up a cigarette takes a deep breath and says

So light me up like a cigarette and just let me burn
Catch fire and burn, catch fire and burn
Light a spark and ignite it
In the dark, so when I'm no more
They'll know I was here, so let me just burn
So light me up like a cigarette and just let me burn
Catch fire and burn, catch fire and burn
Strike a spark and ignite it
In the dark, so when I'm no more
They'll know I was here, so let me just burn
Let me burn

Cinematic,Cinematic,2013,"Yeah, long as cameras on us hold it, let it roll
And I’ll give you the greatest story I’ve ever told
Started green, and out of my reach
On the Bayside beaches and south-side streets
Frankston line trains: I found my niche
Teenage dreams bound by speech
Native tongue I talk rap shit but of course
Fluent in the universal language of fuck 'em all
Testament to patience
Shattered every estimate they gave
With hat and hand never said it’s greatness
Put in four or five years, that work ethics amazing
Either pay respect or be mistaken
Dudes tried startin’ shit, youse no part of it
I don’t raise my voice I improve my argument
I’ve done it before, won’t hesitate to do it again
My city, my pad, my pen

Life feels cinematic right now
Life feels cinematic right now
And life feels cinematic right now
And life feels cinematic right now
Life feels cinematic right now
And life feels cinematic right now
It’s all lights, camera, action right now
And life feels cinematic right now

There’s no pressure to prove none of you wrong
You the same ones judging whole careers off a couple of songs
Man my skills still tight as shit, but skills ain’t love without icing
So I slid a velvet glove over iron fist
It worked, deal with it, I’m my own meal ticket
Did it while they stayed home still bitchin'
So fuck a death threat, my family’s proud
I can’t please everyone, but I can buy a house
I’ve been humbled by love, toughened by hate
I’ve grown thick-skin, never been coloured in jade
I’m still as hungry as I ever was, we stayed steady on
Look at everyone else, where’s the effort gone?
Worked magic with the mic
Since the days where the pay was a fraction of the flights
Now the proof rules, we don’t buy in the hype
It’s the fourth time, cue the highlights

Life feels cinematic right now
Life feels cinematic right now
And life feels cinematic right now
And life feels cinematic right now
Life feels cinematic right now
And life feels cinematic right now
It’s all lights, camera, action right now
And life feels cinematic right now

Middle finger to the magistrate, the one that got away
Middle class white boy, stand with my back up straight
Navigated fake friends and false accolades
Swear I’ll never break bread with that pack again
New day more extras and advances
Hand in hand with more pressure, better standards
I’m well aware by expressing it with grandeur
I ask more questions than I answer
Rack your brain, hip-hop my guardian angel
Married to the music, game to stay faithful
Never satisfied that where I’m at’s right
Cause success ain’t final, failure ain’t fatal, I
Fall down, straight back on the bounce
Diamond in the rough, now jewel in the crown
Might not be much but it’s all I’m about
When I stop and look out at the crowd

Life feels cinematic right now
Life feels cinematic right now
And life feels cinematic right now
And life feels cinematic right now
Life feels cinematic right now
And life feels cinematic right now
It’s all lights, camera, action right now
And life feels cinematic right now

Maybe one day you will realise what this means to me
Maybe you won’t, but I know
This is me from twelve till now
My life has been put in these rhymes
For almost as long as I can remember
And this is it
The moment I’ll look back on as one of my greatest highs
And all of you made this possible
I couldn’t thank you if I tried

No small feat would step to this
Hang off him, surgical work tracks
Get fat and flayed off him
Haystack it ain't coffin
Bowled over the batsman the fact this ain't gotham
I talk snow and powders white caps it ain’t Hotham

Swing from a building like King Kong
Eat em' up and, spit out a pussy like some Thailand ping pong
Monstrous, Nietzsche: God killer, godzilla
Controversial like Ice-T dropping cop killer
I'm off kilter like a naked scotsman
, often
Holding court like Kim-Jong and Rodman
My rhymes are like my heart, a little left of centre
To the left is pressure, (feeling fresh as ever)

We funnel through the train yards
Through the tunnels and the drains
We're coming down, we're coming down
From the rooftops, from the hills
We're running through abandoned buildings
Coming down, we're coming down!
We're coming...

Man these rappers are so roped for a quote
They attack on my character
Download, home phone and apertures
To capture a dose of the most potent caliber
And napper my geneomes for a clone like Gattaca
(So spectacular) Throw stroke and amateur
The coroner's notes wrote overdosed vernacular
So known, the carrier, phone broke the barrier
From south of the globe to the frozen coasts of Canada

Suffa

I'd never phone it in, live wire on short call list
Pick it up if the situation calls for it
Switching country's when summer's done
Is my take on what a sure fall is
Bringing high power to tall orders
With more rhymes than him, boast
With more lines to sync
But look right you get more lines with big hooks
And if it's a big look, then you get more biters
All these kids are crooks, but call themselves writers

Coming down, we're coming down!

I'm like illy from been there, done that
Every time we come back they treat it like a come back
Only because we got that dope that don't go turn your lung black
This a fun fact for all you futile little rug rats
Pupils of this shit I'll pierce your pupil with a thumb tack
(Oh you just got here?) You're gonna wanna unpack
I gotta lotta bullets and I fuel up for the comeback

Excuse me like, fatality, facing the great tragedy
Now, rappers actually making a base salary
Ain't it, so safe until the day we create anarchy
(Out for fame) Then paint my name in the state gallery
Daily event for us, Saying that we're menaces
But we the voice they can't contain with the genesis
Like you gonna up lift weighing all your sentences
Playing with these dangerous percentages

Right... because 10 to 1 (Fair game) and 10 more? (Bout' same)
They can outgun, no matter I can out aim
Yeah, they left swallowing sour grapes and bitter pills

Yeah
All right, so I told her like

Goodbye, won't be seeing me around no more
Made that cal, bounced out the door, peace out
Look, I'm hitting the road, she's hitting the floor
Feeling faint, too late, she triggered her own fall
No finger pointing here just writing on the wall
I'm a man, keep my business above board, but I ain't getting fucked for her
Waiting for beraters to come forward
Cross that bridge when they arrive, take it all in my stride
Like ""What's a fucken a stick to a druglord?""
Laughing how her friends tryna make this a bloodpsort
Now that the love's gone, this chick could make it hail
Golf balls in a dust storm, umbrella's up
No trust talk, never unsure what I'm after
So I don't need your two cents bitch, who asked ya?
Ain't with it, witness me move past ya
I gave my heart, now I'm heading for new pastures
Peace

And I walked in here
With my heart and the shirt on my back, little else
It's all love and it always will be
From me, so I give you my thanks if it helps
Uh, but this house ain't mine
No more so I pack my bags and let 'em know
I'm on my way
I'm on my way (yeah, yeah)

No outside forces at play
No others in the frame, but you saw that we fought anyway
Stayed loyal, but my time spent bought no praise
It's a broke heart to leave, fortune to stay
So I'm out before the ring, look, I ain't touch
No vows with you, in truth your word's coulda hurt once
But now I'm in the world for a girl that loves me
How we start so perfect then all turn ugly (how'd we do that?)
Bow out, keep whatever cash I left
'Bout to zen just to catch my breath
Feel like after being swept in a hurricane I've actually stepped
On my first patch of solid ground in years
A ""sob"" without the tears is son of a bitch, juggling careers
No time to fuck around, no one nights here
Getting busy I'm over her, and all that came with me's
Coming with me so missy don't miss me, get me?
Peace

And I walked in here
With my heart and the shirt on my back, little else
It's all love and it always will be
From me, so I give you my thanks if it helps
Uh, but this house ain't mine
No more so I pack my bags and let 'em know
I'm on my way
I'm on my way (yeah)

I guess that we grew together then we grew apart (yeah)
Been treading water in a pool of sharks, sharp mind, fool at heart
Thinking I can change you, old habits die hard
And mine too, I write rap not valentine's cards (fuck that)
Sorry that couldn't stamp that out of me instead
You broadened my vision, brought the Gus Van Sant out of me
Comfortable to expand, branch out these comfort zones
On my own no crutches on hand, stand proudly
By myself, wishing you the best though
Tough love hurts, makes it difficult to let go
Sad to see all that I invest go to waste but I guess those
The breaks
Had to get the weight of my chest
We know my work ethic's always standing in the way
So I can't feel bad, shit happens at this pace
And in a few months a new album for your mates
Only few months wait, only few months late
Peace

And I walked in here
With my heart and the shirt on my back, little else
It's all love and it always will be
From me, so I give you my thanks if it helps
Uh, but this house ain't mine
No more so I pack my bags and let 'em know ()
I'm on my way
I'm on my way home
And I walked in here (yeah)
With my heart and the shirt on my back, little else (so I'm out)
It's all love and it always will be (take care of yourself )
From me, so I give you my thanks if it helps (take back your key)
Uh, but this house ain't mine (take back all your stuff, I'll take mine)
No more so I pack my bags and let 'em know (and I'm hittin' the fuckin' road )
I'm on my way (way)
I'm on my way
Way home

I said ""Bye bye, baby, gonna leave this place""
I'm coming home",https://genius.com/Illy-coming-home-lyrics
Dammit,Friday Flips: Season 1,2012,"It's alright to tell me
What you think about me
And it's alright for me to tell you
That I don't give a fuck, as a pup look
I liked Limp Bizkit, preferred shit Blink did
Already know I had Big in my Discman
Big bowls, 17 cig mixes
A big distance from gyms and pink singlets
Pre-gig shit, post Vic kick
Blue light disco first kiss
With the girl at the top of my wish list
Man, I was so nervous I nearly missed
I’ve been a worker, a dropout, a fighter, a lover
10 years of soccer, 6 months as a drummer
5 years giving booze money to big brothers
A product of hip-hop and Bayside summers
Just saying been a lot progress since
A messy haired kid wanting big kids acceptance
But it's remembered, and know it comes only once
It’s all love man, this just growing up

You know that I’m leaving the pictures are falling down
The season is calling it feels like I've been here for too long
You must have your reasons, it seems like everybody’s gone
So I’ll face it on my own, shit I guess this is growing up

A day late, a buck short
Wrote the report, finished my course
Wrote a record, itching to tour
A long way from gakked out double dropping at four
But I'm sure
Same clubs still kicking
Dance floors stay filled, new kids there pingin
And that's all to the good, I just ain’t there with ‘em
Well not entirely true, parts there in spirit
But I grew up, and moved on, now we do what we want
But still I, don't forget, or confuse, where I’m from
And I know all the times I’ve been hurt and been wronged
Cause I’ve hurt and done wrong myself
So many in the past, love lost magic
Some got busy, some got married
Some got gone, pacific, Atlantic
And some round the way just as distant, dammit
I’m past that, went from crass to a class act
Take less than 3 seconds with a bra strap
The more things change, the more some remain
No one to blame mayn, its just grown up

You know that I’m leaving the pictures are falling down
The season is calling it feels like I've been here for too long
You must have your reasons, it seems like everybody’s gone
So I’ll face it on my own, shit I guess this is growing up
You know that I’m leaving the pictures are falling down
The season is calling it feels like I've been here for too long
You must have your reasons, it seems like everybody’s gone

Diamonds,The Chase,2010,"Let's run away together
Escape from the parades
It's better late than never
To be on our way
Don't need a map
Just follow the track, track
Don't need a map
Just follow the track, track, track

Cuts a diamond, cuts a diamond, oh
Diamond cuts a diamond
Cuts a diamond, cuts a diamond, oh

Cuts a diamond, cuts a diamond, oh
Diamond cuts a diamond
Cuts a diamond, cuts a diamond, oh

And she said, ""I'm leaving, I'ma take flight
When I've gone I won't ever come back, and I know it's
Not fair, you can come or stay there
It's on you, but I couldn't take that, well I couldn't take that
Turned down any offer of a map
Said she'd find her own way, heading off familiar tracks
We caught between war and the opposite of that
But that's what you expect when two opposites attract
Me and her walking two straight lines, my equal
Lead to the answer, she more than a sign
Sparkle in the limelight, its more than the shine
And it ours, not hers, not mine, we'll be fine, but still
She'd lay you down, heart bleeding through the mattress
Offer you the world and not leave you with an atlas
Soft words, fast actions, she catches
She held out her hand, without ever looking backwards
Said

Escape from the parades

Cuts a diamond, cuts a diamond, oh
Diamond cuts a diamond
Cuts a diamond, cuts a diamond, oh

Yeah
And what a tangled web we weave, said she couldn't breathe
Knocked off her feet but she'd never retreat, and me
Although first cut's deep, its a release
And I'm too lost to try and stop the bleed, I could never let it be
Can't decide if I'm everything you need
Or if I need to be your everything for me and my reasons
Guardian angels fighting inner demons
And clarity of thoughts impeded, still I'm
In the trenches for her, ride to the ends of the Earth
Lost in the sunset, done spent what it's worth
But here we are, hand in hand
For better or worse off, my jewel, vice versa
As much beauty as danger when you talk about trust
And it's a trip, too good to pass up
Shit, soft touch, hard love
She closed her eyes let herself go, felt the rush
And she said

Let's run away together
Escape from the parades
It's better late than never
To be on our way
Don't need a map
Just follow the track, track
Don't need a map
Just follow the track, track, track

Yeah, Yeah
And I'm sorry to interrupt
'scuse me but been amazing you and me, yeah it's time to take a breather still I'd hate to see you leave
'Cause 24 hours a day, 7 days of every week, I just lay it on the beat so you can play it on repeat
Keeping them hours got me way behind on sleep, so imma fall back to my fortress 'til the fall and autumn leaves
A faded memory, lose the , illy out
Just my take on what I see, peace back to you
Over and out, now the talk of the town 'cos I turned a little talent to a corporate account (whoops)
Got knickers twisted up in corsets and gowns, the feelings raw when the crowd wanna play it on repeat
Making 'em sick, got 'em cuddling up to porcelain, killing the moulders here, someone calling the mortars, shit
They made the bets so let 'em corpse it
Sure to firing up the DeLorean, no way they crawling back to you

And we don't run no way, we don't do gimmicks, we don't want no games
You come around here with the same old same, get the fuck out the way (eh yeah yeah eh)
And we don't run nor hide, rather go on my feet, defend my pride
Then live on my knees and break my stride, I'm a thorn in their side like my, my, my

Booty calling again, 'cos who recalls the lames that sit on the computer calling out names, nah man
I followed the trail blazed, made my own lane, can't complain now the whole nation play it on repeat
Balls deep into shows, force feeding them dope, if they ain't know before, now they know it, yes bro
If we ain't talking progress, 'scuse me I'll get my coat
Price to pay for the success, most choke at the quote
Not me I go for the throat, I mean no choking, I won't
They being over their quota, I be like okitie doke and get it done
Fuck with me, fade to black like setting suns, work ethic second to none, they can play it on repeat
Me, I bring the fresh shit, ever the unexpected
Ain't a show without the boy, never mind me on the guest list
To making a mockery of haters for the status, it will be a cold day in Hades when I'm crawling back to you

And we don't run no way, we don't do gimmicks, we don't want no games
You come around here with the same old same, get the fuck out the way (eh yeah yeah eh)
And we don't run nor hide, rather go on my feet, defend my pride

Did a full one-eighty (Woo)

Oh boy, hard times we live in

Like every time I (*coughs*), rappers scared to death
No different, forget you, forgiven
Exhibit caution on approach
Nowadays, you're paid to keep enemies close
Bottom feeders keep on a ""need to know""
Mic on fire, cabin fever flow
Took one pandemic, blew the dust off it
Blew the dust off it? Sure, but no coughin'
Craft lips readin', next you come knockin'
But Cam Bluff got in, no problem
I left them scrap for toilet paper
I wipe my arse with these rappers anyway, bruh, no stress
From Frankston Line to your patch on the map
We been back, they trapped, I'm sayin' (Don't show up)

 don't show up
 don't come out
Six feet then walk away
I bet you care about it now
Up in my room all day
Watchin' this shit go down
Six feet then walk away
I bet you care about it now

Self-isolate deez nuts, who we kidding?
You tried tellin' fuckwits beach is off limits?
But I keep distance, no cheap gimmick
Only hand I shake got dill' bags in it
No news too much for me
War goin' on on your TV screens
I go off tap over Cam Bluff beats
For real life, tappin' on at least six weeks
Can't act like that's new trajectory
'Cause since rap paid the bills, my hands been clean
Goin' back to my roots, these brokes can't fill my boots
ScoMo couldn't track my moves
I don't lose, when you last seen me chase?
I don't reach, nah, I do a leap of faith
Smart money on me, that's a goodbye like

Took a re-up to relax
I used to take crips out to street taps
My shit on beast mode, yeah
Never beast mode enough, I'ma keep rats
How you kick raps with your knees capped?
You on your couch with cramps and a heat pack
Somewhere in Georgia
On COD Modern Warfare, fought 
I'm on the cheese snacks, yeah
Iso body like beanbags, yeah

Dreadlock Holiday,,2014,"Verse 1
It's one for the country
One for the city
It's time for summer, sunshine and innings
When all the kids on the coast playing beach cricket
And every street has wheelie bin wickets
So step to the crease, let your team get balled
Leave them told
Heart bleed green and gold
Classic catches, bagging tons and from now to the pull up stumps
Chorus
I say
I don't like cricket oh no
I love it
I don't like cricket no no
I love it
Don't you walk through my words
You got to show some respect
Don't you walk through my words
Cause you ain't heard me out yet
Chorus 2
And life feels cinematic right now
One day international matches right now
Great times, big crowds and high scores
Balling 50 overs with a white ball
Toast to the past times of a nation
That's some with daylight savings
As we run down the batting order, bounce back
Send them on their way with a how's that?
Chorus X2
I say
I don't like cricket oh no
I love it
I don't like cricket no no
I love it
Don't you walk through my words
You got to show some respect

Got to show some respect
Don't you walk through their words
Cause you ain't heard me out

Chorus 3
Coast to coast, and top end to bass straight
And below and all between
There ain't no surprises so many feel like there's only one game when the mercury rises
Born and raised learning tools of the trade
Grew up on idolizing the greats of the game
Whole country backing good times to come again
Simple, nothing more to explain

B-itch
Uh-huh, yeah
Glasses up, yeah
Taku beats

Get another round and light ‘em up from now ‘til we passing out
Get another round,  dumb it-dumb it down-down
My people, I got you now
Are you with me? Yeah, we got you now, Illy
Well, get your glass up, paint the town
And get your drink on, we can dumb it down

Off tap, upsetting the birds
Avoiding the bouncers for getting my words
For getting my fly, spilling shit on my shirt
Couldn’t give less of a fuck, for what it’s worth
I’m a BB Swiller, D-Floor killer
Shit’s so beast, real seesaw tilt
I’ve got moves man, the method in the hips
Like a cross of Mike Jackson and an epileptic fit
I bend it like Beckham, free kick
Light ‘em up  for her high 
 through the bird’s eye twist
Worked Monday, looking like stir fry sh-
Mate, maybe it’s time to pump a break
Splash a little cold water on the face we assessed but hey
Who we kidding? A seven day space
We’re right back at it again, and we’ll be yelling out:

Get another round and light ‘em up from now ‘til we passing out
Get another round,  dumb it-dumb it down-down
My people, I got you now
Are you with me? Yeah, we got you now, Illy
Well, get your glass up, paint the town
And get your drink on, we can dumb it down

Now, none of us intellectual, a three-eight year
From the beer jugs and spirit and we blame them
We’re like glue how we stick to the bar
And go wild when the club bang Jimmy Recard
And I’m fresh from a backyard barbie or the beach
With a long legged  and an army of my peeps
We’re all  booze ‘til we’re hardly on our feet
If we can’t get in the club, we’ll party in the street
In twenty years brother, you’re one of a kind
The brain damage will suffer like butter to a steel cutter
But cross that bridge when it arrives
For now, I’m loving living life, draw clench wide-eyed
Ride one for all in butter low calling
It’s sunrise, no time for yawning
Now, who said we’re stopping at six in the morning?
We’re rocking ‘til the afternoon, yo bartender

Get another round and light ‘em up from now ‘til we passing out
Get another round,  dumb it-dumb it down-down

I still can't walk a mile in your shoes
Trouble comes in threes, we do just fine me and you
I hate to be the bearer of bad news

Yeah, hear ye hear ye, oh boy hear me
Neighbours hearing us over their TV's
Fight like you Spartan, but smile like you cheerlead
Live on the scene and message through the ear piece
No good news today
Whole lot of curse words, a couple of broke plates
Dress it, I'll pay your light, can't have it both ways
It's pouring but no coat, umbrella with no rain
But hey, it's just a season
And if you don't want it, up and leave then
And you can keep asking ""what's the reason""
But wait, wait, wait
I'll stop you there, good luck and good evening, damn

We go together like PB and celery
I failed math, but breezed through anatomy

Buy the gloss, but not a thing rang true
So I'm hitting haters up like bim, bam, boom

Wig out and give 'em something new to bitch about
Can barely tell, you kicking it or kicking out?
Back right after the break if you stick around
Stop the presses, circuit breakers, drop the pressure
Read between the lines on the message
It's 2016 now, even forever's not forever, man
Already plotting a part two
Brought to you by a coffee and dark moods
On our way, no stopping to argue, I'm sorry
It's just something i can't do, but you know what they say (Ok)

And I don't
Wanna hear another thing about it

Feel Something,The Chase,2010,"Freed by the feeling, losing all control
Across star systems, bottomless soul
Its rock and roll baby, it never gets old
The jump's only as far as how tight your holding on
So let it breathe, let it build
Future is meaningless, reality's killed
Take the breaks off, let the thoughts spill
Technicoloured words, luminescent fills
And this feels like heaven to me
And the beats like the prettiest sound you've ever seen
Define clarity, redefine gravity
Kiss the sky, flirt with insanity
Just some thoughts for the mind
Conceptualise brain patterns in a rhyme
And were doing just fine
Living life one deep breath at a time

Cause I'm just trying to make you feel something
I'm just trying to make you feel something

Each thought like a jolt, each sense gone numb
We feel nothing and everything at once
Synchronised madness, the children of the sun
Setting fire to their temples, whatever may come
You can't make sense of the chaos
So close to meaning, still such a way off
Rise and decline
Blinded by truth, our eyes tell us lies
Sleep beneath hyper-coloured skies
Brain stems legs, reality would amputate
The greatest thoughts here captivate
Then crystallise, then evaporate
It's all in how you let it go
Awake in the dream, we ebb with the flow
So stay tuned for the next episode
Lets find how deep this rabbit hole goes

And away, we go

Any grasp of reality left behind
Embrace life in precious time we given
See the starlight shine in the distance
The path of least resistance, leave a sense
Of content in the minute, comfort in here and now
Build it up just to tear it down
Forge bonds that never were
Till daybreak saboteurs arrive to fray shattered nerves
Let the warmth rush over me, course through my veins
Thoughts caught in webs we create
Ha, you won't remember the date
But the sensation lasts after memories fade
No regret, no remorse
Overwhelmed without cause, but you gotta let it
Run its course
Feels like an immovable object struck with unstoppable force
But its just trying to make you feel something

Be cool baby
Be cool baby
Just trying to make you feel something
Close your eyes, let it go",https://genius.com/Illy-feel-something-lyrics

Came a long way man, from tours
First act on doing encores
Fit in or stand out, either or

Went high grade, gone top drawer
Game on point, numbers on board
Made my second home airport floors
Been on call for those long hauls
Damn (damn) Said I'd do it, I did it (I did it)
Put my mark on map like I googled the image (Ayy)
Let 'em get used to the shit, nothing usual in it (Yeah)
I took my backpack and my accent there and back and, there and back again
Yeah this life's a bitch but I fit this bitch like a black dress

Same shit different story, that's a hard sell
And they ain't big enough to sell it
Always talking 'bout those tall tales
Never doing it before they said it

Let me put that right, yeah, I took my time
'Cause number four did damage, so cooking five
I locked the kitchen down, mixed good advice
With too many late nights in St Kilda, too many late nights in the L.E.S
I'm pound for pound the best, and this is where the buck stops, my two cents, not a penny less
So what I miss? Man, let me guess
Some poser shit, faux heaviness
I don't rock the boat, I capsize the bitch
And if this the wave, they all getting swept
I'm the architect of my success
Hand made this house of cards, went upper deck
Since Cinematic came and went
I reload, five deep this round, no time for breath goddamn
Tried to let y'all miss me for a second
Come back and I hear my influence on all these rappers records
And goddamn, even I'm over reiterating the message
But it feels like if I ain't here to remind how quickly they forget it
That I'm geed up, I've been up, I'm living la vida
That bullshit, you ain't bout that life man, me either
Damn, the boys back, I II tell you something for nothing
I ain't mad I missed these summers, it's just been motherfuckers

I'm no side show, I'm no life coach, Mr. Tightrope don't slip, nuh uh
Tall poppies get clipped But how many track stems you gotta dig, damn
Made my own lane, they rehashing, yawning at their bars
Yea got it, you rhyme, blah de blah, count myself to sleep with all the ways they rap bout rapping
Two classics under my belt, another put an ARIA on my shelf
And the other was my first one, didn't make that for anyone else
And still it's onwards, upwards, let it build
Crossing genres, bending steel
If you don't respect what it takes to make this look easy by now, you never will

You never will, you never will

So here we go again
Oh, oh
So here we go again",https://genius.com/Illy-forget-it-lyrics
Full Tank,Long Story Short,2009,"I got my suitcase and a full tank
I got my keys and I'm ready to drive
So we can head for the highway, yeah
And just ride off into the night
I said I got my suitcase and a full tank
I got my keys and I'm ready to drive (yeah)
So we can head for the highway, yeah (it's Illy Illy)
And just ride off into the night (yeah)

I got my phone, wallet and fresh clothes
A sense of adventures, worries got left home
So let's go, there's no time to waste
And there's no day like today to escape
All the work pressures stop right here
We got one job each mate, you chop, I'll steer
Cheers, and with an esky full of beers
And a fat glass pipe why not disappear?
My life soundtrack's in my CD case
With a system that bust from the bass
I love hittin' open road with my mates
Gettin' drunk, find myself in a state when I wake
A black VX, Victorian plates
And a leadfoot alegic to brakes, it's a race
Against the setting sun, so just to be safe
Buckle up your seatbelt, let's try to keep pace, come on

I got my suitcase and a full tank
I got my keys and I'm ready to drive
So we can head for the highway, yeah
And just ride off into the night
I said I got my suitcase and a full tank
I got my keys and I'm ready to drive
So we can head for the highway, yeah
And just ride off into the night (yeah)

I'm taking us and this old backpacker 
Past roadblocks, gridlocks and traffic lights
Staying high like a satellite
'Cause four in a five seater ride's no lavish life
But I wouldn't have it different with cash
Just as long as we're splittin' the gas it's all that
Five hours in, thought  an hour back
Shit, I guess the road sign's our map
Servo pies are messed
And that shotgun call's lookin' more like life or death
Funny how when it's said and done
We'll sit back and laugh 'bout how gettin' there was half of the fun
But for now on the road, the bud's running low
We got some waitin' at the show, we better go
Like Renegade Lightning, from highway to centre stage
Fuck it, who needs speed limits anyway?

I got my suitcase and a full tank
I got my keys and I'm ready to drive
So we can head for the highway, yeah
And just ride off into the night
I said I got my suitcase and a full tank
I got my keys and I'm ready to drive
So we can head for the highway, yeah
And just ride off into the night

Generation Y,Long Story Short,2009,"Yeah, my Generation Y
It's just what we do!

Yeah, now where were you when the towers fell?
When folk washed away under broke levees and tsunami swells?
And it ain't hard to tell, so wide like it's hard to see
The separation of uzi shells and artistry
Guess it's the heart in me, flowing like an artery
The can't-figure-for-the-life-of-me why our army be
Overseas fighting, Bin Laden been hiding
Oil fields guarded, why the fuck soldiers been dying?
I'm the first to salute the troops, send 'em prayers
And the first to give a middle finger to the fucks who sent 'em there
And brother, why would I ever care?
How tit-for-tat get us anywhere? Come on, what's the method there?
How's that gon' seek peace?
When did Hip Hop die? Probably the same night as O.D.B
When we gonna realise hope is free?
You can call this a love song, you can call it poetry.. whatever

So we say what we say like it's all or none
Cause we're the ones there when the problems come
So we're the ones trying to change the world
My generation asks why
We fight, we fight, we fight, we fight
We fight, we fight with a fist to the sky
We fight, we fight, we fight, we fight
We fight, we fight with a fist to the sky

Yeah, what happened to the power of one man's voice
When boys my age die from one man's choice?
Happy sipping brews in the sun with the boys
All I need is a push bike, fuck a Rolls-Royce
How long we gonna let cash rule in the habit of
Not appreciating what the planet's got?
I stopped, switched off the idiot box, fuck a channel swap
Why not? It's real life when the camera's off
I'm like Martin Luther King with a dream
And it sure as shit don't involve Gretel Killeen
Make use of my God-given right to speak
No threat of bombs dropping's gonna silence me
Ain't it worth it if we die free?
When did Hip Hop die? Probably the same night as B.I.G
This from the heart, piece by piece
You want to call this a love song? Well it's sweet by me.. whatever man

So we say what we say like it's all or none
Cause we're the ones there when the problems come
So we're the ones trying to change the world
My generation asks why
We fight, we fight, we fight, we fight
We fight, we fight with a fist to the sky
We fight, we fight, we fight, we fight
We fight, we fight with a fist to the sky

Mad props to the trail blazers, no path guide
To show the way they made, we don't ask why
We just laugh at how the industry was so damn blind
To Hip Hop from our backyard, no gang signs
And no cocked nines, none of that nah
Just hot rhymes from our own kind, young Aussie minds
Why some push poison like the love's there for exploiting?
How long can the culture avoid 'em?
Why bother? We good brother, they took cover
They mainstream, even our big names hooked up underground
I'm asked how I grind till I'm beat
Like why would I stay? Bro, why would I leave?
It's one life, one may do with less
They say Hip Hop died, but that's a lie in the A-U-S
We going strong from strength to strength
Aussie youth of today backed us, so we represent for them.. my dudes man

So we say what we say like it's all or none
Cause we're the ones there when the problems come
So we're the ones trying to change the world

We fight, we fight, we fight, we fight
We fight, we fight with a fist to the sky

Gimme Shelter,Friday Flips: Season 1,2012,"I ask that you pour your heart out, drown the threat
We march, not one out of step
Think this shit's bad? See how loud it get
If that lit fuse get to the powder keg
We got crowds in the net, crowds in the streets
Weak exploited by the powers that be
It's no new thing, just new found reach
World wide web, worldwide greed
 dreams get broken
Fenced in routine, repeat the process
You paint ‘em in a corner provoke ‘em
For generations poked sticks hope that cage don't open
When the gap is padlocked from have's to have nots
Chat stops, time to act, cause
This calm ain’t peace, throw the balance right off, man

In 4 months
Don’t get cute thinking you work harder than us
You don't, you only shine when we done
I can’t stay in the middle of the road all day
So I pin my colours to the flag I raise
Melbourne made, hip-hop boy
Bad bitches love and wack guys hate
What I do, to put it in your brain
I give a fuck about what you say
Mate might wanna make your next few waters
Cause I ain’t cared since ‘08, for real
Don’t be fooled, cause I smashed a tax bracket
My whole career is back to back classics
And yours isn't, so if your thinking bout swinging
Best pack a flak jacket biatch

Roll like a tank does

Go,The Chase,2010,"Yeah

What a difference sixteen months make
I couldn't fit it in a thousand status updates
Foot to floor at these speeds, dangerous to pump brakes
Blur of hotel rooms, runway lights and pub names
Sunday flights hidden behind dark shades
Live for the days between ""can't wait"" and ""can't take it anymore""
Waiting till it's ""can't wait"" again
For now we can make a name, later we can make amends, okay?
Took it to show-stopper, from show-stealer, from show-starter
Worked my little arse off for it, I did
Juggled uni and music, pretty much hit both targets
One change if I had my time again? Go harder
Double the workload, opportunist to the bone
Shit, I'm opening the windows up in case the doors close
The past is the past, the new days rose
And what's next, only god knows

And on that note
Welcome to the chase

On your marks (on your marks)
So where you at?

Well, as it stands, I'm making progress
And as if money ain't an object
I put my eggs in a basket, sitting on a bullet train in the pouring hail
So either I'ma break some records, or I'm sure to fail
Belief can be a nuisance, present on both sides
Genius and stupid, it's down to if you reach what you're pursuin'
Ain't much between reasons and excuses
And they'll think your crazy arse can't achieve it till you do it
But let suckers fence sit, hoping they don't pick the wrong side
I've always said I'll back a good trip over a long ride
I keep my vision tight, never lost sight
What's twenty-twenty if you're cross-eyed?
It feels like I'm so beyond noticing the road
That my expectations can't be the only thing that's grown
With the first I stepped out of every shadow that I know
And with the second, I'm about to cast some shadows of my own

And on that note
Welcome to the chase
Welcome to the chase

Ready set
Ready set
Yeah

I tip my hat to the past, seize the moment, look ahead
Head up in the clouds, keep an eye on where I put my steps
'Cause from the things we didn't mean to things we never said
At times, it seems like it's an inch between contentment and regret
Getting my vanilla sky on, jumping off the ledge
Rocky running up the steps, feel like ""Hurricane"" Carter
'Cause the truth sets free, but it's tougher to accept
The one thing worse than hate's when they love you then forget
Don't forget me, feel whatever way but feel deeply
'Cause indifference the cousin of sleep, dream sweetly
But speak freely, be open, this as much yours as mine
From the second you owned it, I hope you find
Beauty in the flaws, obsession in the finer strokes
My heart extends beyond the thank yous and the liner notes
Art vs science, my canvas, your microscope
And only god knows

So on that note

Great To Be Here,The Illy Mixtape: Volume 2,2008,"“It’s great to be here”
Uh-huh, yeah
“Great to be here”
 I see you, baby
“It’s great to be here in your arms”
Yeah, now this is me, Illy
Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, Illy
Yeah

First off, I want to thank you all
To everyone involved for all of your support
I couldn’t do it without ya
I mean it from my core
Without you here, it wouldn’t be real
I’d still be in my bedroom rhymin’ to myself
Yeah, rappin’ up my wall
But passion for the cause
Turned a little somethin’ to a little bit more
And I ain’t got a problem at all, na
I’m in a league with the apes and with the greats
And tell these kids to stick to their playpen
As far as I’m concerned, my flow’s the illest out (yep)
Regarding Melbourne, I still carry the Frankston line on my back
Like a big bad ass tattoo (Frankston line)
So, when they see me “that’s you”
And when they see you, that’s me too
My Frankston line dudes, come on

“It’s great to be here, great to be here”
Thank you, I ain’t goin’ nowhere, man
“It’s great to be here in your arms”
I’m right here
“Thank you, baby, thank you, baby, oh”
Yeah
“It’s great to be here, great to be here”
Thank you, I ain’t goin’ nowhere, man
“It’s great to be here in your arms”
I’m right here
“Thank you, baby, thank you, baby, oh”
Yeah

I was just a little fucker, Frankston liner, chucker upper
Beefin’ with my old folks, no big brother
I’ve never had much, but I never had nothing
Can’t say I suffered anything tougher than you’d expect from some scruffy head teenage punk getting’ messed
Huh, actin’ he’s livin’ on the edge was a must
But livin’ on the edge wasn’t us
Closest I came to death was my stomach pump
What can I say? The Aussie blokes love a drunk
What can I say? The Aussie girls love a trick
What can I say? I played the role comfortably
And I ain’t sayin’ that I done it hard or by any measure
I just recall and record it better
This is for you, you’re the reason I wrote this
The reason I bit that, my reason to give back

“It’s great to be here, great to be here”
Thank you, I ain’t goin’ nowhere, man
“It’s great to be here in your arms”
I’m right here
“Thank you, baby, thank you, baby, oh”
“It’s great to be here, great to be here”
Thank you, I ain’t goin’ nowhere, man
“It’s great to be here in your arms”
I’m right here
“Thank you, baby, thank you, baby, oh”

Yeah, man
“It’s great to be here, great to be here”
So, when it’s all said and done, what matters is , man
“It’s great to be here in your arms”
People’ll go “you’re back”
“I’m right here”
“Thank you, baby, thank you, baby, oh”
And this is a thank you to the people who have mine
“It’s great to be here, great to be here”
Just no super star shit
It’s just me, my fam’, my mates
“It’s great to be here in your arms”
The people supportin’ me
“I’m right here”
What up motherfuckers?
“Thank you, baby, thank you, baby, oh”

Guess I Could,The Chase,2010,"Yeah
I'ma let these other dudes talk about how they're the best
I'm just gonna get right into it and prove it
Phazes, you ready?
Then let's go

I'd say I'm back but I never left
And I could say I'm right but I never guessed
I could talk shit for days but I never would
But I could if I wanted, yeah I guess I could
I'd say I'm back but I never left
And I could say I'm right but I never guessed
I could talk shit for days but I never would
But I could if I wanted, yeah I guess I could

It's Illy Illy, yeah back again, backing it up
Sophomore slum not happening, chum
Still ride through the Frankston line in my VX
System cranked to all fuck, black cap with the hoodie up
I got 'em tripping like I stuck my foot out
Turnaround so quick 'cause it reads so sick
That my rhymebook is hard to put down
But it's always a safe bet that anything I put out's how hip-hop should sound
They used to tell me my vocal chords didn't warrant a snowballs chance
Ain't got a snowball no more man
I got an avalanche
Look at what I created with my two bare hands, when given half a chance
I'm representing the future
So I don't need no guest verses to prove shit, just talented producers
Phizzle we still killing em before he hit the tarmac to split
Left me some classic boombap as a parting gift
Thanks for that, took it, ran with it and I never looked back
I put my patch smack bang on a map
Burn city where you at?

I'd say I'm back but I never left
And I could say I'm right but I never guessed
I could talk shit for days but I never would
But I could if I wanted, yeah I guess I could
I'd say I'm back but I never left
And I could say I'm right but I never guessed
I could talk shit for days but I never would
But I could if I wanted, yeah I guess I could

Raised middle finger to your raised nose, home sweet home on a beat
I make 'em move like the rates rose
I know whats up, whats nothing and what matters most
I ain't acting what I'm not knowing that I don't, never that
I take none of this for granted, the privilege ain't lost on me
It's common knowledge any minute it could stop (shit)
So even when humility is tossed with the brags
Still always thanks given for the props
In this chase that I'm on, the road's steep
I could tell you 'bout the peaks, the lows, little bit about the nosebleeds
A little bit about weekends on no sleep
Or jumping deep ends with both feet
But it's worth it for my folks' smiles when I tell them bout my nights
Or the front row reciting back every single line
Or the people thanking me for the lyrics that I write
Y'all pretty much validate the last decade of my life
Humble thank you, for round two I've been run ragged but I must add
Don't call it a comeback, 'cause um, yeah, about that

I'd say I'm back but I never left
And I could say I'm right but I never guessed
I could talk shit for days but I never would
But I could if I wanted, yeah I guess I could
I'd say I'm back but I never left
And I could say I'm right but I never guessed
I could talk shit for days but I never would
But I could if I wanted, yeah I guess I could

I took my hobby, made a job of it and honest
See the plane in the sky, or tune into the J's, man I'm probably on it
But still broke mate, my quotables
Have earnt me self-satisfaction and a few beers at my local
Slice of humble pie, shit I lick the plate dry, but hey
Not being big headed ain't easy with a size eight
The time took to refresh the page
We stood on our yesterdays triumphs leapt fences in the way, now
Danny's international, Phazes' international
J-Skub's a genius, Phrase is an animal
Flag goes the business, me? I'm kicking goals from a distance
Crooked Eye on that bullshit big shit
I'm like a proud brother watching all my peers doin' it
Still get a kick when kids say my music influenced 'em
I promise I won't stop until it ain't just
The fellas who be getting my lyrics tattoo'd on 'em, huh
I celebrate the past but can't wait for the future to start
Raise a glass for my graduating class like

I'd say I'm back but I never left
And I could say I'm right but I never guessed
I could talk shit for days but I never would
But I could if I wanted, yeah I guess I could
I'd say I'm back but I never left
And I could say I'm right but I never guessed
I could talk shit for days but I never would
But I could if I wanted, yeah I guess I could

You studied your craft 'fore you put it on the internet
You'll never pass if you spittin' it illiterate

Led, eatin' together and bein' fed
Anything that you hear may not always be what was said
When you playin' Chinese whispers with the prisoners in your head
Never let another's position effect your vision
We don't own no television, we go-getters, we livin'
Listen, the truth missin' like the desert in the rain, or
Kendrick and Sherane, so I'm the black box on the plane

Hazard To Myself,Two Degrees,2016,"I guess I got my problems, so what's one more bottle
Cos I don't need nobody else, I'm a hazard to myself
I've had my chances, but I can't break these habits
Guess I don't need nobody else, I'm a hazard to myself

I gotta bench myself just to wake myself
Or I drink myself into hating myself
Again, yeah, enable myself again
Rehab coming up around the bend
Like, welcome, come on through
Seems a quiet drink's never one or two
I know your friends think you're the bad influence
But you think they're one on you, well, true that
But, right now, I'm a few rounds in
So, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Like my plans just like my Jamesons
You could just put them on ice
Look I heard what time the bar closed
Don't have to tell me twice
And all these bad decisions seem fine
Without hindsight on my side, okay, alright

I guess I got my problems, so what's one more bottle
Cos I don't need nobody else, I'm a hazard to myself
I've had my chances, but I can't break these habits
Guess I don't need nobody else, I'm a hazard to myself

Yeah, yeah, high as a kite to the world below
Those downward spirals give me vertigo
I was none the wiser, like who'd have known
It takes two to tango, man, I do my own
And my tolerance up
I could float in this bottomless cup
Everybody's been novices once
We just wanna have fun, my god, what you got against us?
All the patrons ain’t to stay in place
Repercussions still a decade away
Shouts to bad girls, yeah, the saving grace
All the Charlie's, Molly's and Mary Jane's, shot
Chase them then what’s next
Wake up still taste it on my breath
One day we’ll face it and confess
And maybe we’ll change to them, god bless, oh yes, I guess

I guess I got my problems, so what's one more bottle
Cos I don't need nobody else, I'm a hazard to myself
I've had my chances, but I can't break these habits
Guess I don't need nobody else, I'm a hazard to myself

And this arm don’t need no twisting
No doubts or second thoughts
I’ll find trouble in an empty house for sure
(I’m a hazard to myself)
All the way from the happy hours
Down to the last of the last calls
And no, I don’t need no help at all
(I’m a hazard to myself)

See straight and narrow didn’t work so good
Oh man I really shouldn’t
But oh well what the hell, cheers
So it’s too and all those best intentions get twisted
And then end up as something else
(Ah baby yeah)

I guess I got my problems, so what's one more bottle
Cos I don't need nobody else, I'm a hazard to myself
I've had my chances, but I can't break these habits
Guess I don't need nobody else, I'm a hazard to myself

And this arm don’t need no twisting
No doubts or second thoughts
I’ll find trouble in an empty house for sure

Down to the last of the last calls
And no, I don’t need no help at all
(I’m a hazard to myself)",https://genius.com/Illy-hazard-to-myself-lyrics
Heard It All,Bring It Back,2012,"Seems like we grew up in a
World where marketing's the reason you sell
So everybody's got a story or achievements to tell
These days, seems everyone's repeating themselves
I'd change it, but in truth it can't really be helped
Because what you about to do has been done one hundred times
Before you had thunk it from Melbourne to London
Producers made beats before you could spell drumkits
So really how unique can you be? I mean, c'mon, kid
From the days of record stores to the days
Of online message boards, it's all been said before
For ages, I'd have sought inspiration
To create the same place where now you draw yours from
With your aim's to paint an image
But I know you ain't breaking limits with the same same but different
It's like 
South Park
 when 
The Simpsons
 did it
I try to be one of a kind with my lyrics, but

Please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you heard this all before
I'm only one voice in a world of billions
And no idea's original no more
Please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you heard this all before
I'm only one voice in a world of billions
And no idea's original no more

Right, I'm feelin' like Jay, what more can I say?
Only two albums deep, like a quarter of the way
To the finish line, some claim ""Kick back, give it time""
Other's like ""Hustle hard or it'll slip by""
So here it is, conscious of the fact that the rhymes
That I spat in past time just might overlap
If they do, dig deep and cope with that
Repetition is the father of learning, you're dead if you don't adapt
And I built it I'm 'bout it so I'ma still rep proud
Stick to my guns like the building's surrounded
And bring the house down till they kickin' me out it
You still have the freshest shit out on each album
'Cause it's true, no idea's original right
But a different perspective can give 'em new life
So I pulled a pen out, now I'm giving you mine
It's on you to press play, sit back and decide, but lookie

Please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you heard this all before
I'm only one voice in a world of billions
And no idea's original no more
Please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you heard this all before
I'm only one voice in a world of billions
And no idea's original no more

""Know you heard this before""
""Nine, eight, seven
Six, five—five
Four—four—four, three, two, one""

One mic, two mic, three mic, four, check it
Fine line between five mic and broken records
Between recognising flaws and applause
Let's see what shit I can't tackle anymore
No momentary happiness or footprints in the sand
No pedal to the metal chase or cigarettes in hand
All good, I'll get by, but I hope you understand
The same values I had still define who I am
I'm a hip-hop boy, leave the dubstep to club heads
I lose my shit to it but ain't rapped on it once yet
It ain't me and trends come and go
By the time it got known, I'd already outgrown it
I guess what I learnt as my golden rule
Is the only thing that matters is the fans, that's who
Made this possible for me, so I'm responsible to you
It might not be the new, but nothing can beat truth

So please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you heard this all before
I'm only one voice in a world of billions
And no idea's original no more
Forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you heard this all before
I'm only one voice, yeah, I'm only one voice
But that voice speaks up for y'all

So please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you've heard it all
I'm sure that you heard this all before
Please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you've heard it all
I'm sure that you heard this all before
Please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you've heard it all
I'm sure that you heard this all before
I'm only one voice in a world of billions
I'm sure that you've heard it all
And no idea's original no more",https://genius.com/Illy-heard-it-all-lyrics
High, Friday Flips: Season 2,2015," (Peking Duk Cut)
All that you give
Is what you don’t deliver
Stuck in a phase
Misguided by mistakes
Your addictive poison is dragging me down
Trying to swim out I’m stuck
You’re watching me drown
- FRIDAY FLIPS -

Yeah, we're going way up
We going forward like the brake cut
Hit 2014 with a Chain-Gun
And it stayed here, and that ain't changed once
Spent time studying the game, kept it near by
Get more attention when you pay close up
3 papers in a Range Rover
Cigars and  for the late 
Yeah, a brave heart never phased Hova
Whether from a 5 Star or a mates sofa
I'm Michael in Mike, and only beat one, two, three
Yeah, I gotta bring it like it's stuck to me
Cos really who gives less of a fuck?
P Duk and Illy on the turn up (Yo 'Kill Me')
The flow infinite pool, so the rule is:
Hi to the good life, by to the bullshit boy
 (Peking Duk Cut)
I’m high and rising
Alive now I’m fine cause I let you go
I’m high and rising
Alive now I’m fine cause I let you go x2

WOAH! Fair play my brethren
Two Step at a time on a Stairway To Heaven
I put it in the air like it levitating
Fuck waiting for it imma get-get-get get it
And small minds don't matter, nor chatter
We chasing all time ghost status
And most rappers ain't a candle to my back; catalogue
Let alone the fire that's 'boutta happen here
Laugh Now, Cry Never
If not now why ever?
Knocked down, mines better
Cos you only get a diamond with pressure
And you only get free when you let it go
So it's straight to the point - Derrick Rose
So Mumma raised no fools, so the rule is:
Hi to the good life, by to the bullshit boy

I’m high and rising
Alive now I’m fine cause I let you go

Imma pack my bags, head straight for the highway

And when I'm gone I won't ever look back
No I'll never look back

And the story 'bout love's ain't one about heartbreak
And when I'm gone I won't ever look back
No I'll never look back

I know, there's no fuel  but I'm bored
Pass well-worn streets and same old horns
Long forgotten storms, like one day it just dawned
That it's gone, kids grew up and moved on
Tired of the dead ends, cycles that we get in
See there whole lives played, titles to the credits
Imagine if over horizons our repentance
Tonight we gon' find out, fire up the engines
As I ride the line between infamy and legendary
Dunno how it ends, but this will be my legacy
Son of the four fathers and it's hereditary
But truth is, there ain't much in this town left for me
As the empire falls to a fucked-up place
The runaway still allergic to pumping brakes
As long as nothing's sacred, nothing's safe
Left in the hands of my fate, like my, my, my

No I'll never look back, no

And this a cold world, no fate but the one we make
We come of age and stumble on a change
Now I'm a young man, but that ""mad at the world"" --
An even younger man's game -- have fun in that lane
Shit, I did my time here, but the love of that fades
And I ain't hanging around to grow jaded
Top down, motor quick and over on the pavement
And I don't know owe a cent, a second or explanation
Nah, I'm ghost trail of dust to the sunset
What was once give way, to what come next?
'Cause boys do what boys gon' do
Old timers mad, like they weren't the boys once too
But I'll leave that for you, what is and ain't real
Hard to let go, but harder to stay still
So both hands on the wheel wherever life steer us
The rear-view mirror never looked clearer

I'm on my way
Life pass through quick, you could blink and fade, so
I'm on my way
On a hope and a prayer look how far we came, so
I'm on my way
Before my tomorrows, my yesterdays
I ain't leaving wondering, these are risks you take
Switch lanes, hit the gas, press play, all day

I Know,The Chase,2010,"I talk a good one, but know that beyond that
I know I would never'a made it without you
And I know there ain't much I can do to repay that
The reason I made it through, all I can say is thank you
I talk a good one, but know that beyond that
I know I would never'a it without you
And I know there ain't much I can do to repay that
The reason I made it through, all I can say is thank you

And that’s life, its crazy ain't it huh?
From temperamental teenage days seemed like all roads led to blazing up
Put my olds through shit deeper than a bass guitar
I couldn't play but I wrote, and although
My poor folks tried it all, still caused 'em to tow
A borderline war zone within the walls of their home
All outta love, me risking my future, they watching all of it
So desperate to help, being forced to let go
Now I know my story's no different to most and I’m not saying
I’ve done more than the average Joe, just making it known
What happened here, how many parents you know
Could go through that and still back their son's rap career, the case ain't closed
And fate saw me come good Mr Magistrate
Turns out chasing the dream is worth the battle pain
This for those who walked me to my first school day
And who'll be right there when I graduate, thank you I had to say it
Yeah

I talk a good one, but know that beyond that
I know I would never'a made it without you
And I know there ain't much I can do to repay that
The reason I made it through, all I can say is thank you
I talk a good one, but know that beyond that
I know I would never'a made it without you
And I know there ain't much I can do to repay that
The reason I made it through, all I can say is thank you

'Cause with me, you'd leave nothing to fate
And for that, I know I account for every one of your greys
And the kicker is, I know you'd have it no other way
And that's love, there ain't much I can say, but let me try
'Cause every problem I faced, they faced it with me
And added handfuls of stress on top of already chokers plates
And Stephanie, everything I lack, she's got it in spades
Look, I’m just sorry this song's an album late, 'cause if I’m honest
From sports days to court dates, from forty-forty
In the hallways to kicked out of schools, they backed me always
It made for quick recoveries 'cause no matter
How bad I fucked up, they never once gave up on me
It goes much deeper than just something I wrote
I’m choking up, trying to get this past the lump in my throat
Guess I could never say enough, I could never make it up
But till I’m dust I’ma try 'cause it's love, and with us
It's nothing but 

I talk a good one, but know that beyond that
I know I would never'a made it without you
And I know there ain't much I can do to repay that
The reason I made it through, all I can say is thank you
I talk a good one, but know that beyond that
I know I would never'a made it without you
And I know there ain't much I can do to repay that
The reason I made it through, all I can say is thank you

For your support when I was down on my luck
Credit's due, I feel I owe you that much, all I can say is
Thank you for all the heartaches that we've overcome
Wish I could change it, but what's done is done, all I can say is
Thank you for all the times that I've bitten my tongue
And later on, kicked myself for not speaking, believe me
You're second to none, and this here's just for being your son
I just wanted to say, I just wanted to say that I know

I talk a good one, but know that beyond that
I know I would never'a made it without you
And I know there ain't much I can do to repay that
The reason I made it through, all I can say is thank you
I talk a good one, but know that beyond that
I know I would never'a made it without you
And I know there ain't much I can do to repay that
The reason I made it through, all I can say is thank you",https://genius.com/Illy-i-know-lyrics

It Can Wait,The Chase,2010,"It's like that money in my palm, soon as I spend it, want it
Soon as it's on, I'm off it, soon as I get it, lost it
It's like the moment compared to staring at pictures of it
It pick you up then drop you down
You blink, you missed it, wish you watched it
So amazing when it's there, when it ain't it's so unfair
Go from square one to atmosphere, then back to here, and
I thought I had it on lock, turns out you can't restrict it
Can't rush it, can't predict it, that's part and parcel with

Happiness, happiness is fine but it's momentary
A momentary lapse of reality
Reality is fine, but for the moment it can wait
I'm addicted to the chase of my
Happiness, happiness is fine but its momentary
A momentary lapse of reality
Reality is fine, but for the moment it can wait
I'm addicted to the chase of my happiness

We take that weekend by storm, tick tour dates off tour posters
Start that long sleep to sober, then just like that it's over
We party like rock stars, looking down on how kings would live
And wake up to setting suns, smoke stains on our fingertips, but
It's perfect in that moment, we own it, it's ours
No happy ever afters, just happy for right nows
So fleeting so profound, thoughts full in my head
It's nights I won't remember with mates I'll never forget that's my

Happiness, happiness is fine but it's momentary
A momentary lapse of reality
Reality is fine, but for the moment it can wait
I'm addicted to the chase of my
Happiness, happiness is fine but it's momentary
A momentary lapse of reality
Reality is fine, but for the moment it can wait
I'm addicted to the chase of my happiness

Full tilt, we hit them highs, man they come and go like seasons
I know when it's arrived, hardly catch it till it's leaving
Hold tight for them up and downs
Hold tight for them up and downs
Hold tight for them up and downs
Hold tight for them up and downs
Hold tight, hold on, and don't slow down, no, no
That's my up and downs
That's my up and downs
That's my up and downs
That's my up and downs

Yeah, ain't no amount of words, close to define that feeling
Reality and dreaming, tow that fine line between 'em
Soon as it got here, it's leaving, dunno when it's going round again, but
Move forward, push towards it, means justify the end, so
We're scouring far and wide, through love and fear and hurting
But after all that searching, goddamn it it's worth it
Bang the head of the nail, we don't dream to scale
Long as there's wind in my sails, I'ma stay hot on the trail, my

Levels,Friday Flips: Season 1,2012,"Now what am I to do? No time to appease both sides cause
Haters will stay mad till the girls pantyhose dry up
So keep hating, keep bitching, get my profile up
This is how you flip it man, fuck Flo Rida
Don't need to make dance music for you to dance to it
When I can make crowd bounce with a hand movement
I got a genius on the beat, so don't act stupid
Course we gonna crush shit, fuckwit, man who is
You to doubt it, I ram raid booths down
We tear through, fuck moving round it
Built it with our conviction
And no bulk billing or filling out prescriptions, killing our addiction
Took the rap game unfiltered and triple distilled to drip some
Real music through your system

What’s doing where the fuck y'all at?
On the real, on the real, on the real
Can’t put my finger on that, but sometimes
I get this feeling that I never, never, never, never had before

Stranger things can happen
Rap took me from Frankston line to lower east side of Manhattan
My beats loud and my pants saggin'
Hip-hop boy, the emos can miss me with the handbaggin
Poor diddums with your damp blankets
It's so hard for ‘em, need a box of tissues and a backhanding
My pockets full of phone numbers wrote on blank napkins
It ain’t shit to add carriage to the bandwagon
Missing in action, been missing the action
Set a 20 plus date tour to rekindle the passion
Cause I, uh pardon me, we go live
Light it up till they read our rights, I just go for mine
On the grind, put in overtime
We on the road, we on the flight
Wherever you might find me's
Where the beat be
Holler when you see me

Lightshow,Two Degrees,2016,"She said, ""you ever have one of those days?""
I've had 'em on loop, each worse than the one it replaced
But there's comfort in routines, even in bad ones
Arrived to the fight of my life with a cap gun
Time after wrong time, bad place
Stuck in a long line, rat race
Can't palm off a quick fix, Band-Aid
These dramas, got my fingerprints hand made
I lost my way, messed with my essence
Depression, a guest in my head that I’m wrestling
It's left me for dead and I'm desperate for strength
But I'm scared, it's anyone's guess where it ends
But I'll crawl through the rain, 'til I walk again
My pain, your pain, it's all one in the same
So when I told her my fears were the fame
Half smile on her face, she said, ""I can relate""
I know

Said I know, I know, I know the rain
I've been places where that light can seem a world away
I know, I've been low, never seems too long ago
Never seems too long ago, oh

Yeah, yeah, you told me
Man I've been knocked flat on my back
Went off track on a map, and every turn
I tried to recapture the passion
It ends in a brand new scrap, but never mind
Blindsided, they left me first
My sense of purpose followed by sense of worth
And regaining those senses, relentless work
But I will, I swear it, mark my every word, 'cause
Hitting bottom only lead one direction
And one step up worth a million intentions
See, first you test it, then come to questions
Then the lesson, only then the redemption
So if you low, listen you gotta know
It's part of the show, come back you gotta go
The hard truth in the cold light of day
We all finding out way, I said, ""I can relate""
I know

Said I know, I know, I know the rain
I've been places where that light can seem a world away
I know, I've been low, never seems too long ago
Yeah but from the ashes phoenix rose
Get yourself a seat man, here's the lightshow
Get yourself a seat man, here's the lightshow

I said I shot my light
As the rain poured, when that flame got dim
I just sheltered 'em all
When the whole chorus told me I couldn't I nearly bought it
Almost had me doing the dirty work for 'em
Ain't no cause for retreat, and if I left them, when
What they say about me?
Look, the world thought I was brought to my knees
I break the storm, made the gale force look a breeze, please
Get me, stop it already
I love myself, without poise or a penny
The stakes weigh heavy, and I'm sure plenty more to come
The strength I got from it could break levees
They tried oh they tried but they knock us down
And all the no's in the world ain't gon' stop us now
Hell nah, not a chance, you lied up your weight
You line up a name, you fire away
I know

Get yourself a seat man, here's the lightshow
Get yourself a seat man, here's the lightshow

Said I know, I know, I know I know the rain
I've been places where that light can seem a world away
I know, I've been low, never seems too long ago
Yeah but from the ashes phoenix rose
Get yourself a seat man, here's the lightshow
Get yourself a seat man, here's the lightshow
Get yourself a seat man, here's the lightshow",https://genius.com/Illy-lightshow-lyrics
Long Story Short,Long Story Short,2009,"There's more to life than getting leg up and foot in the door
I mean, I'd love more money, hey wouldn't we all?
But putting cash over loved ones couldn't be more
I could be flat broke, still wouldn't be poor
And as for all the hard times that I guess should hurt
I didn't skip a beat, still put my best foot first
Wish I could talk about my fam, but it wouldn't have worked
Cause when the love's that strong, it can't be put into words
So I dedicate this better songs, better grades
Trying to be a better son, better brother, better mate
And I've learned from mistakes and I don't know what I am
But a part of that's knowing what you ain't
And I ain't never put a dude down just for trying to catch his break
Never gave shit based on the ways
They'll never said I did it any other way than my own way
At my own pace, with my own wrong terms, no brakes

Said I'm going to be somebody
Knowing no one can stop me
They can say what they say, just watch me
And when I get  they know

And high school wasn't for me much, nah
Most of my teachers swore I was fucked
But then a couple had faith in me, helped me back up
Probably never quite thank them enough
But thanks to them, I'll be stepping on stage at my graduation
Long way from walking train tracks from the station
Riding the 405 from the street, in amazement
Spray-paint can control, dedication
Displayed on the walls, disputed its name
As artform until I tried and wasn't able at all
I still wonder how graffiti goes under
When naked little girls go on magazine covers
Okay, but I grew up, now I'm all of six feet
No more fucking around, it's uni courses and beats
And what's important to me is my family tree
The now and knowing whatever will be will be

Said I'm going to be somebody
Knowing no one can stop me
They can say what they say, just watch me
And when I get paid, they know
Thanks to the love, we gave me
The road up ahead don't faze me
Looking before we come, it's crazy
When I get  they know, you know

So, I live with aims to make the most of it when
I know that we'll never have this moment again
Headphones on my head, board shorts on my legs
Cigarettes, note pad and a pen
Going back to them lunch smokes, weekend binges with my kin
In my FUBU jeans, with my fringes to my chin
Even before that, barely finished being kids
When we'd give shit to the girls we interested in
Growing up, soda bottles keep us entertained
When I kept my cigarettes in my pencil case
And couldn't wait till each 6th of September came
Come the 7th, pickin' days off the calendar again
And some mates went astray
I love 'em, but things change, what can I say? You lay in the bed you make
And I'm tryna make mine a king
But life's now, so I slow down, take it all in

Said I'm going to be somebody
Knowing no one can stop me
They can say what they say, just watch me
And when I get paid, they know
Thanks to the love, we gave me
The road up ahead don't faze me
Looking before we come, it's crazy
When I get  they know, you know",https://genius.com/Illy-long-story-short-lyrics
Looks Could Kill,Two Degrees,2016,"You see it in their eyes, no need to say it
When you know, you know
And we just drive them wild, oh man
Those animals get territorial
I don't really get it
It's not for me to work out, I don't really sweat it
I go diabetic kicking sweet shit, Venice with a flow
All thirty in a circle, hands off the windows
Tell 'em no, they starin' inside
Oh they mad, clear as daylight
And whether they gon' run with or get run by
Just know they gon' talk till they all tongue-tied
Man, hell of a thing to get used ta
Fuck it, we'll live, tell the truth man, sucks to be you
When you see where they're coming from can't blame their view
If I was them I'd hate us too, walk in the room

It's all eyes on us
If looks could kill
We light 'em up
Come get your thrills
It's better when you feel it
It's better when it's real
If looks could kill
If looks could

Take a photo, make it last longer
Like what more can they ask from ya
Standing like a statue in frame
Make all the boys want to tattoo your name
I'm well drilled in flattery acts
Red carpet to front, red  back
But oh man that e—n—v—y gives me life
Gotta say thank you for that, so thank you for that
And that mood could change
Any second I know, I know
So it's in one ear
Out the other it goes, shit
Who knows, this fairytale
Might not end well, oh well
How far these angels fell
But take a look around it ain't hard to tell

That it's all eyes on us
If looks could kill
We light 'em up
Come get your thrills
It's better when you feel it
It's better when it's real
If looks could kill
If looks could

And it's all eyes
On us (They on us)
If looks could kill (The others)
If looks could kill ()
And it's all eyes
On us (They on us)
If looks could kill (The others)
If looks could kill (They on us)

And I don't get mad at that
I just don't put any energy on it
I know we the focus
I live for these moments, I swear it, I promise
But never caught up in that
I'm looking beyond it
And apart from the lights there's nothing in sight
But we're used to it

'Cause it's all eyes on us
If looks could kill
We light 'em up
Come get your thrills
It's better when you feel it
It's better when it's real
If looks could kill
If looks could

And it's all eyes
On us (They on us)

Loose Ends,,2020,"CDs in their covers all the tapes thrown out
Yeah we made mistakes I lost count, last count
Summer nearly over it's already dark now
Somewhere on the way I guess we grew up
Every time I drive past your old place now
Think of all your dreams that we'd talk about
Wonder how your big plans all worked out
Hope the future was good to ya

We blink it's gone
Look around, we ain't kids no more
Never be what it was before, no no
How it go, you can never go home
Keep moving forward
Let the fork in the road change course
Always be a piece of me that's yours, oh oh
I don't know much, but I know that

Some loose ends don't get tied up
Still seem real enough to touch
Made my peace with letting go
All those things we don't need to know because
Some loose ends don't get tied up

Dear summer, I was right there
Window down, Jeezy floating through the night air
Didn't know where we headed but I'll drive there
Must have seemed something like your parents' nightmares, ha
Hurricane youth saved patience for the calm
Loved your head to your toes to the bracelets on your arm
Swore we'd ride together, burn bright forever
Through highs and lows, through wins and lessons
With one hand on the wheel and one on your thigh
Still seems real on nights like tonight
Could reach out and touch you, hell of a ride
The walk in my life to the long kiss goodbye
The hurt when we know it can't work
Be a whole lot of love but there's only one first
There's only one you, there's only one me
But it's only one life so it's how it's gotta be

We blink it's gone
Look around, we ain't kids no more
Never be what it was before, no no
How it go, you can never go home
Keep moving forward
Let the fork in the road change course
Always be a piece of me that's yours, oh oh
I don't know much, but I know that

Some loose ends don't get tied up
Still seem real enough to touch
Made my peace with letting go
All those things we don't need to know because
Some loose ends don't get tied up

Don't get tied oh don't get tied up
Won't get fired oh won't get fired up
Every breath was a memory in my lungs
Every breath was another day young and dumb (x2)

Some loose ends don't get tied up
Still seem real enough to touch
Made my peace with letting go
All those things we don't need to know because
Some loose ends don't get tied up (x2)",https://genius.com/Illy-loose-ends-lyrics
More Than Gold,Cinematic,2013,"So here we are
Years on, came good, found a second voice
And made art out of personal reference points
It's scary, I check my songs
And it feels like so many of my best times gone
Guess I'm scared; man, I'm so scared
'Cause I don't know where this road ends, don't know what lies there
And with age comes wisdom, lose some, win some
On my lonesome for this one, but still my
Heart beats with them; bars, beats and rhythms
Take care of your memories, can't relive them
When I wonder about my own worth
I just hope I splash some bright colours on a cold world
Through a life long career away
On the chance that, for a moment, you'd hear me play
And I'd make this sacrifice again
For these precious few moments on stage, I swear that

This is worth more than it's sold to me
Worth more than these words to me
I need you to know
That is worth more than gold to me
Worth more than you'll ever see
Ever see, oh

I don't expect y'all to remember me
When the dead leaves fall from the evergreens
When our summers end, our paths cross here, it might never come again
It's that well worn fate of the music man
Something like an admission of mortality
That old foe times like gravity
Can't beat it, only hope to look back happily
And say ""If I had mine back, I'd do it all again""
Yep, every misstep and regret
That I've grown to accept, whatever comes next
I commit you my future, give you my past
Gift you these words 'cause the present don't last
So before I'm an old flame in your heart
And my words fade as quick as the next song starts
I made this for you to take, thanks for believing
Just let me keep that, we'll call it even

With blood and sweat, with 
We grow, we age, fade and die
We die, we die
We live 

This is worth more than it's sold to me
Worth more than these words to me
I need you to know
That is worth more than gold to me
Worth more than you'll ever see
Ever see, oh
This is worth more than it's sold to me
Worth more than these words to me
I need you to know
That is worth more than gold to me
Worth more than you'll ever see
Ever see, oh

And it's sad, but to start something new
I had to wave part of my life goodbye
So these the first steps of Illy's ONETWO
And this the last roar of Phrase's Crooked Eye
So this one's for you, my brother
Long way it echo, years after the final scene
Could never pay you what due, my brother
So this is a toast to what is and what might've been",https://genius.com/Illy-more-than-gold-lyrics
No Tomorrow,Cinematic,2013,"Because the DJ just dropped a classic
Because the mirrors are painting us with neon and music
Because the the dance floor’s full and you’re young, high and fucking gorgeous
Because the your heart’s brimming with sky and the sky is a melody of blue and diamond, it trembles with joy
Because this feeling is real, it’s coffee and a cigarette, it’s a home cooked meal, it’s payday, it’s a swish, it’s making love all summer, it’s scoring a 90 minute goal to win the game
Because you’re one kiss from midnight
Because X marks the spot and you’re right on it
Because you’re with your family, blood or chosen and the bassline just dropped
Because there’s you, her, him, them
Me, us and no tomorrow
So live this
Now

And now you see it, and now you don’t, it’s gone in a cloud of smoke
Yeah you never know how’ll you go
So just in case tomorrow don’t come
Tonight we singing at the top of our lungs
Turn it up, no high school musical
One with the dark side, two to a cubicle
Ah, free from the consequence, life's beautiful
Leaving after a cheap suit at my funeral
And I'm sweet, yup, I'm good, yup
Cross fingers, yup, touch wood
If tonight's it, take it one for the books
Doing everything my teenage self would
And when the clock strikes midnight
If we still standing when all the smoke clears
Tell em' they can keep all the fortune, all the fame
And I'ma stay right here cause man I swear

I wouldn’t miss this for the world
Not for the world
No I would beg, steal or borrow (woahh ooh woahh ooh)
Ain't no telling whats ahead of us so I'm living my life like there's no tomorrow (woah ooh woah ooh)

Yeah voodoo magic and the dark arts
Thrill seekers and bar staff
We don’t do shit by the half glass
And I'm right there with them so I can't laugh, nah
Just young, dumb and gifted
Call it what you want, what's the difference?
I am here for the heights not the distance
So I will spend these nights like ill miss them
Cause there’ll come a day, a time and a place
An age where we will wish we were right here again
When we’d die for the chance and kill for the same
So I think of that future and live for the day
And I've been, I've been hoping up and down
But for now my feet don’t touch the ground
So as soon as the sun set
Lifting my drink in the air with my loved ones
I'll share this round
With red blooded royalty
All my kings who never wore crowns

And there's nowhere else in the world that I'd rather be right now
I swear that

I wouldn’t miss this for the world
Not for the world
No I would beg, steal or borrow (woahh ooh woahh ooh)
Ain't no telling whats ahead of us so I'm living my life like there's no tomorrow (woah ooh woah ooh)

So love me and leave me and let me go
And I'll find my way back home
To the sounds of my radio (oh oh oh)
Highways and winding roads
Can try, but you can't have both
The risks we take
And even so
That's okay cause I know

I wouldn’t miss this for the world
Not for the world
No I would beg, steal or borrow (beg, steal or borrow)
Ain't no telling whats ahead of us so I'm living my life like there's no tomorrow ( living my life like there's no tomorrow)
And I wouldn’t miss this for the world
Not for the world
No I would beg, steal or borrow (woahh ooh woahh ooh)
Ain't no telling whats ahead of us so I'm living my life like there's no tomorrow (woah ooh woah ooh)
And I wouldn’t miss this for the world
Not for the world
No I would beg, steal or borrow (woahh ooh woahh ooh)
Ain't no telling whats ahead of us so I'm living my life like there's no tomorrow (woah ooh woah ooh)",https://genius.com/Illy-no-tomorrow-lyrics
Numbers Game,The Chase,2010,"Trading floors exploded, down arrows, red numbers
People losing everything, convinced that their world was ending, no small thanks to a lotta chest thumping
And paranoia, but thats a sensitive topic
Cause on one hand homie lost his home, on the other hand, the ones who caused it go in and post record profits
That was just the tip of it,
 the icebergs vanished, species vanished daily
Countries literally drowning, under the threat of an ecosystem failing
To cope, gave us enough rope, we were swaying by the days end
Big business dollars bought slaves, blind eyes, coastlines, goldmines of ambivalence, digging our own graves then
No lie, oil fell from the sky, suffocated oceans blackened
Eyes of the world on a room of conspirators, not one knew what happened
Not one stood and hacked it, noone took blame
Global crisis justified for private gain a world insane (that's what it is to be a slave
Every city
In every building
Sits another like me
Watching, waiting, watching, waiting
They pushed us, tested our indifference, just to see how far they could milk it
And its funny cause the ones with the money didn't care long as it was the one without who felt it
Ha, they felt it alright, for lifetimes across all borders
Smooth talkers, cold blooded, exploit it, export it
My generation, was caught between caring more than all that came before us
And a self induced apathy that almost tore us, destroyed us and brought us
To the brink, then we stopped to think, its crazy in age where
We could drop bombs via satellite we were too blind to the forces at play there, to stand up against their
Willpower, to quick to cower in the face of conglomerates
And as the world hung there in the balance, enough said enough is enough about time we put a stop to this
Straw by straw till they had a haystack, only took one more
To break the cycle, united took to the streets, to the halls of power, to the governments doors
Every city
In every building
Sits another like me
Watching, waiting, watching, waiting
Every city
In every building
Sits another like me
Watching, waiting, watching, waiting
It's all a numbers game, but all the corporate wallet flashes
Of financial strength couldn't counter the power of the masses
When it came to the crunch, when the lust and greed threatened everything we love
Divided they had us but fuck that man, push came to shove
And we beat the fucking cowards back, and under a shining sun
Showed we could silence their influence, but try as they might they couldn't silence love
Can't silence love, let history shown how hard that war was won
So we may never know how close we'd really come, how close we'd really come
Quite an experience to live in fear isn't it?
That's what it is to be a slave",https://genius.com/Illy-numbers-game-lyrics
Oh My,Two Degrees,2016,"You don't know what you're missing

Yeah
She gotta work out a play 'fore
She bail on her day job 'cause bae got
New orders to wait on
New Yorkers and ASOS
Spent years on her plans to ditch a plan
One spark went inside the avalanche
Whole world out there she set to span
You can tell that by the Instagram
You gonna run the world someday

First sight, it works like a charm

Hardly has time besides that
And the cocktails take her mind off the fact

On & On,Cinematic,2013,"Yeah, life's a song that plays once through, true
So I keep my best days in my front view
Cause sure thing, one day I'll be gone
But I don't want forever, nah, I don't need that long
Look, I just need, like, 15 minutes and a chance
Cause I don't wanna think man, I just wanna dance
With my friends, with my love with a drink in my hand
With a full house rocking out, singing our jams while the beat goes

On and on
And it plays and it plays and it's gone
And it goes around, comes back around
And it's been around but it goes
On and on
So it plays and it plays and it's gone
And it's all good but till that comes
The beat goes on and on

Yeah, life's a song so I write mine with love
And I write mine with truth till the life out my lungs
How they say ""Youth's wasted on the young""
When our minds like bullets rounds rolling off the tongue
Hearts beating like..
You'd think it was the drums
So full of sweet melodies, we'll sleep when we're done
Take in each ray of sunshine, save it for when rainy days come
Cause them rainy days will come for each one the beat goes

On and on
And it plays and it plays and it's gone
And it goes around, comes back around
And it's been around but it goes

And the best parts in are the ones sung together
So look, I don't wanna be alone
So play it through the speakers, you can keep the headphones
Shit, I just wanna go but you can come too
You could share my view, we can sing the same tune
All roads lead to somewhere, life's like music
For each new direction you move in, never lose your roots
Cause it's not what's now it's what lasts
It's less about the outcome, more about the path
Cause life passes, blink hard you miss parts
So look 'em in the eye and you speak from the heart
You're never what you aren't
No point trying to swap your voice for another's
Laugh loud, love lots and dance like nobody's there to watch
Cause one day the song will stop like..
But till then the beat goes

On and on
And it plays and it plays and it's gone
And it goes around, comes back around
And it's been around but it goes
On and on
So it plays and it plays and it's gone

On the Bus,The Chase,2010,"(Yo) Yeah, I'm talking way back
Like way, way, way back (Illy Illy, M-Phizzle on the track)
Like way back (Illy Illy, M-Phizzle on the track)

Man, I was on the bus with a Discman in my hand, banging Biggie with a bottle of
Passion pop in the backpack, ciggies in the pockets
Penning raps thinking, 'damn, when I’m big enough to rock it
I’ma rock it till wheels fall of it', yup
High school finished, every night, we were getting blazed
One by one rocking p-plates, cruising to the j's
At the time never crossed our mind that those were the days
Weekday benders man, weekends were the same
Found freedom on the road, found money in the sofa
Wasn't much, so a six-pack would wanna tide me over
Probably get a slab sorted if we pooled it all together
Still be on the beach at midnight depending on the weather
As much time as forever, the shared times brought us together
The same times make the ties hard to sever
And I honestly couldn't ask for better
Memories except for parts that I can’t remember but fuck it
Twenty going on twenty, forever young at heart
Didn't matter, whether parks, or the studio or bars
Man I was right there, look again here we are
Seems like I blink once and a lifetime past, and now
Old mates are turning new leaves
And killing it from worksites to corporate life, I’m living a movie
Like 8 mile, nah Billy Madison of Uni
With exams in a few weeks, I’d settle with a few c's
But that’s the life I chose
I opted for the scenic road and left the highway alone
I guess I’m learning as I go, these the ropes
Feeling right at home with being the oldest kid I know

I’m trippin' like that was just the other day
It couldn't be that long ago, shit, there’s no way
I wonder what my younger self would look at me and say
Yeah you're doing all right, but I’m happy on the bus
I never really noticed till the whole scene changed
Everybody’s tied down, I wanna fly away
There’s no need to wonder what the younger me would say
You can keep your obligations, I’m happy on the bus

And pretty girls, god bless ‘em, no question
I kept ‘em close, letter passing in class, if I slept through lessons
Shared notes, never good with the parents
The bloodshot eyes didn’t make for good first impressions
Don't wanna think of the prepaid credit I spent
On text messages I’m amazed by the lengths that I went to impress ‘em
Rarely committed, never fully in ‘em when I was
Barely listened when they'd call to call it off
Was already onto the next, broke a couple hearts
And regret to this day, but I guess that’s the way that it goes
And go it did man, round and back
'Til that one came along that made my heart collapse
It's bittersweet when you catch it, like sunshine in winter, shit
I thought I was pimpin' with a futon and dimmer switch
But that’s how it was, no one knew different
Fun loving sinners just young dumb and innocent, now
My mates putting wedding rings on their girls fingers
Down for the count, babies in the world with ‘em
And I’m still up at eight pushing through a whirlwind of
Strong mixes, scar tissue, cheap rack, and fast women
And it’s a ride that I don't want to get off
But I don't wanna be the last to leave when it all stops
Shit, I guess change is the fact of life
Have a tough time tryin' to balance my age and what I’m acting like

I’m trippin' like that was just the other day
It couldn't be that long ago, shit, there’s no way
I wonder what my younger self would look at me and say
Yeah, you're doin' all right, but I’m happy on the bus
I never really noticed till the whole scene changed
Everybody’s tied down, I wanna fly away
There’s no need to wonder what the younger me would say
You can keep your obligations, I’m happy on the bus

Yeah
And everybody’s gettin' serious, and I don't think I’m ready yet
Not sure if I’ll ever be, wouldn't put a heavy bet
On it, wouldn't promise anybody that I care about
That I’m prepared to cut my hair or wash my mouth out
Shit, I don't use alarm clocks
Can’t cook, can’t clean, can’t read stocks, can’t keep watch
Of my health, and my finances are a mess
But I still feel happy as it gets
And if I’m honest, it’s all good, shit I got high hopes for the future
I’d be long gone if I hit it like we used to
Been over clubbing, not really missing much
In that regard, I guess it’s just getting older sucks
It’s a tough pill to swallow but no kicking up a fuss
But I guess it's kinda dope how full circle shit comes
'Cause, these new adventures keep me interested as fuck
And if some other kids turn to bang biggie on the bus
So thanks for the memories, I hate to say goodbye
But all good things come to an end, we’ll meet again
Somewhere in the next life, fingers crossed next ride
I’ll be able to savour it before it’s in hindsight
And that’s word to the kids, in a sprint to be grownups
My only advice would be live for the moment
You got a whole life to get it right
For now it’s Life After Death or Ready To Die, you decide

I’m trippin' like that was just the other day
It couldn't be that long ago, shit, there’s no way
I wonder what my younger self would look at me and say
Yeah you're doing all right, but I’m happy on the bus
I never really noticed till the whole scene changed
Everybody’s tied down, I wanna fly away
There’s no need to wonder what the younger me would say
You can keep your obligations, I’m happy on the bus
I’m trippin' like that was just the other day
It couldn't be that long ago, shit, there’s no way
I wonder what my younger self would look at me and say
Yeah you're doing all right, but I’m happy on the bus
I never really noticed till the whole scene changed
Everybody’s tied down, I wanna fly away
There’s no need to wonder what the younger me would say
You can keep your obligations, I’m happy on the bus",https://genius.com/Illy-on-the-bus-lyrics
One For The City,Cinematic,2013,"Yeah, now I don't mean to brag but I'm a big city kid
Gone with the wind, shoot from the hip
And all across the world, no difference
Every city in the world, at home within
Man, it could be nothing like the hard life
Shit, still a sucker for a skyline
The open road's fine to write a couple of lines
But the cities tell the story of a lifetime
Cut; Lights, Camera, Action
It's all that, everything you imagine
It's right there, you can reach out and grab it
Dreams turn reality big smoke magic
Maybe I'm biased and maybe the set up
Maybe it's just that I don't know no better
City don't sleep, speakers at eleven
If they got a question this is what I tell them (them)

Them city streets are endless
Them bright lights catch the eye
We push it to the limit
We build it to the sky
And anything can happen
It's on you to roll the dice
Hold tight and get ready to ride

I'm home, I'm home and I'm one for the city tonight
Said, I'm home and I'm one for the city tonight

Yeah, you could live the dream
Have it fall in your lap
Fall in love or fall through the cracks
Tough call to avoid those traps
But in high-stakes business you gonna get that
Take it from the streets to the penthouse suites
All you need is a dream, a belief
A little luck and a bit of guts to achieve
Heart of the city, belly of the beast
Yeah, what you pay for, cheap thrills ain't cheap
Pay a high price if you wanna taste free
All the good isn't always what it seems
But that's fine with me, this is where I wanna be
Amongst the bright lights and the beat of the city
In any direction people are with me
We get busy, what a trip, what a blessing
They wanna question so I tell them

Them city streets are endless
Them bright lights catch the eye
We push it to the limit
We build it to the sky
And anything can happen
It's on you to roll the dice
Hold tight and get ready to ride

I'm home, I'm home and I'm one for the city tonight
Said, I'm home and I'm one for the city tonight
I'm home, I'm home and I'm one for the city tonight
Said, I'm home and I'm one for the city tonight

I'mma stay hard till the sun goes down
Till the lights come out
Till the lights go down
And the sun comes up again
I'mma stay hard till the sun goes down
Till the lights come out
Till the lights go down
And the sun comes up again
I'mma stay hard till the sun goes down
Till the lights come out
Till the lights go down
And the sun comes up again
I'mma stay hard till the sun goes down
Till the lights come out
Till the lights go down
And the sun comes up again",https://genius.com/Illy-one-for-the-city-lyrics
Opening Night,Cinematic,2013,"Live and direct us, Crooked Eye directed
This life’s like a movie, these opening credits
Nine times as epic, white lines for breakfast
Low lives in presence, but the highlights is hectic
As I level measured up here with giants and legends
But I built it myself, just minding my business
Fuck I’m high as the jet is, shit I’m flying forget it
Shit I fall from grace, but shit I climb from the wreckage
Ain’t here to smash it, what you here for?
Shotgun summer cause suckas hit the rear door
Long as I hear applause, cheering me on
They like Illy, Illy, it’s yours, kill it, kill it
Let’s go, sure I don’t see why not
ONETWO my own label, now the deals signed off
I’m a franchise player, put my home team on
We toast to the winners with our own theme song
And ain’t no match for it, y’all act like it’s an accident
Me and Phizzle smashin’ shit, it’s arrogant but accurate
Four discs deep, they can wonder how
With all respect to the underground

We put it down my brother, black suit, black tie
Cue applause, kill the lights, welcome to opening night
We put it down my sister, we composed that score
Making silver screen records while they scream encore
And it’s real beyond reels, way beyond stills
Motion picture shit, like we put it on film
We roll, we roll, we roll, we roll
We roll, we roll, we roll, we roll

Ain’t shit changed but the year and the album name
And the album number and the label, and the standards way up, anyway
I ain’t been gone that long, still missed y’all fam’, couldn’t keep me from it
I promised to be right back, so here I am, run a track get a canter
And they still can’t keep up with the pace I set, matter fact they ‘bout to get lapped
And already blessed with the grace to accept it, never that nah man never that
I don’t rush I’m prolific, I don’t give a fuck if they different
They just lazy, at a snails pace, still lucky they finished
Still leads us to the hoops they credit in, for how I got ahead of them and I’m like
Hmm actually that’s probably true, fuck, forget it then
I’m a competitive son of a bitch, I got enough friends, fuck what you think
I’m on that I-L-L-Y ONETWO tip
No respect if none’s deserved, no glory if nothing earnt
With that I present to y’all the Nexis worth, of verses of my words
Rest assured, fourth time lucky, 2013
Viva la un deux dios mio, bitch we…

We put it down my brother, black suit, black tie
Cue applause, kill the lights, welcome to opening night
We put it down my sister, we composed that score
Making silver screen records while they scream encore
And it’s real beyond reels, way beyond stills
Motion picture shit, like we put it on film
We roll, we roll, we roll, we roll
We roll, we roll, we roll, we roll
We put it down my brother, black suit, black tie
Cue applause, kill the lights, welcome to opening night
We put it down my sister, we composed that score
Making silver screen records while they scream encore
And it’s real beyond reels, way beyond stills
Motion picture shit, like we put it on film
We roll, we roll, we roll, we roll
We roll, we roll, we roll, we roll

The camera’s pop, snare’s snap, record’s crackle
Serial cinematic’s capture every angle
Peel that curtain back, see them wheels churning
Poetry in motion my dream works, I’m Spielberg’n
And I Tarantino the flow, lotta slick shit, pulp fiction
Adrenaline hit that dope, flatline then back to the living
Sh-Sh-Sh-Show of my life, hold your applause
Welcome to opening night",https://genius.com/Illy-opening-night-lyrics
Our Country,Long Story Short,2009,"Yeah, this track is dedicated
To the Indigenous people of Australia
And the soldiers and the firefighters who protect it
Yeah, yeah

The strong stood silent, much harder men wept
Pollies broadcast live from the parliament steps
City slickers watched on, bush cousins held breath
Hell on their doorstep and only half of them left
I fell asleep that night and dreamt the arsonist bled
And woke up to cries of ""Off with their head"" soon drowned
By the sight of the nation standing proud, lockstep
Made me feel there's some issues to address like
Those who don't agree with my freedom or choices
Should at least respect here they got the freedom to voice it
Media hype, sensationalised poison
Divide by our difference, not build common points
But all from Bagdad to Britain
Ain't feelin' our lifestyle of livin', pack your bags, good riddance
Can't question our morals, can't query our spirit
'Cause we know the fire come heroes come with it, like

And this is my country, flaws and all
Still what our boys overseas at war for
So I'm not hearin' we ain't doin' it right
'Cause it's easy to criticise, it's easy to divide
But this is our country, young and free
We the sum of all nations, some of all creeds
Yeah, we , knowin' when it's crunch time
We the sum of our people combined, come together, right

Yeah, we rise to the problems
We're Australian, the size of our hearts stretch the size of our wallets
From guys on the front lines to guys in the office
To the firefighters tryna stop it, we ain't perfect
There's flaws, but in times of crisis we drop it
Count the losses, look to the Southern Cross
And pray to whatever God we believe in to offer
Respite to those left worse off from it
Uh, so each Anzac and Australia Day
We celebrate black, white, doesn't your race
Whether it's dawn services or barby's with your mates
I wonder if diggers knew the pride in country they'd create
State to state, coast to coast
There's hand on heart recitin' the oath, it's a hand off
To lighten load, it's that fair go attitude
That says more than anything presidents spoke

And this is my country, flaws and all
Still what our boys overseas at war for
So I'm not hearin' we ain't doin' it right
'Cause it's easy to criticise, it's easy to divide
But this is our country, young and free
We the sum of all nations, some of all creeds
Yeah, we , knowin' when it's crunch time
We the sum of our people combined, come together, right

Yeah
I love hearin' Europeans talk like we lie beneath 'em
'Cause our culture ain't built on galleries and museums
But put us in arenas, or a put us on a beach
Or talk freedoms, ain't no motherfucker gon' beat us now
I'm nothin' special, I just rhyme kinda decent, kids
Look to Anzacs for what a leader is
The lucky country, home of the brave
Bastards who stand up, fight, and punch out their weight class
This an ode to my home, one love for those
Who strength they can't replicate in a photo
For souls in Gallipoli, one love from home
And one love for those who shot back on Kokoda
I'm over the anti-Oz vibes, let 'em slide
I'm ashamed as the next man by the race riots
But I bleed Aussie, so till the planets collide
I'll be a proud motherfucker with my flag raised high

And this is my country, flaws and all
Still what our boys overseas at war for
So I'm not hearin' we ain't doin' it right
'Cause it's easy to criticise, it's easy to divide
But this is our country, young and free
We the sum of all nations, some of all creeds
Yeah, we , knowin' when it's crunch time
We the sum of our people combined, come together, right

Yeah
Now I'm not sayin' we're perfect, we're far from it
Sometimes the bullshit gets in the way of
Us seein' how we've actually got it
They wouldn't call it the lucky country
If it wasn't, man

Papercuts,Two Degrees,2016,"En garde, my god, how she get at me
Either we'll never get it right or it's meant to be
My ego, her pride, some recipe
We're our biggest fans and our own worst enemies
Ain't shy, let the whole world know
Have 'em tuned into the blow by blow
She move, I move, let her go, I go
Stir it up, stand back, watch the firework show
Ayo, too proud to quit when it's broken
Too in denial to admit when it's over
Drowning at separate ends of an ocean
Both in too deep to know where the coast is
Surrounded by waves in a hurricanes
Gaze, when we together ain't none of y'all safe
So buckle or get out of our way
Up in smoke, down in flames cause man

When we fight fire with fire
When we cross the line, ayo
Maybe happy ever after's ain't for us
Ain't no surprise
When we play with knives, ayo
Ain't no broken pride and these aren't paper cuts

Ain't no broken pride and these aren't paper cuts

One by one on the hunt
Nowhere to hide, nowhere left to run
But I'd rather war with you all of summer
Than a low key peace with another, ayy
One by one every cut
Yeah, it gets deep, but who they to judge
'Cause when it's on we roll like the thunder
Then it's RIP to the others ayy
Cycle repeat till the lesson get learned, man
You play with fire, bridges get burnt, man
The standoff only making this worse
But don't nobody move and nobody gets hurt, man
We just caught in our ways
Sucker-punches traded, all fun and games
Until the cards, fall where they may
Then it's all 'can't even, whatever, anyway'

When we fight fire with fire
When we cross the line, ayo
Maybe happy ever after's ain't for us
Ain't no surprise
When we play with knives, ayo
Ain't no broken pride and these aren't paper cuts

I know when you're weakest
You know where my demons hide
Put us on a knife edge
We tear down everything inside, and
I know when you're weakest
You know where my demons hide
Put us on a knife edge
We'll tear down everything inside

When will we learn
We've come too far in this to see
How much it hurts
When will we learn
You and I
We've come too far in this to know
When to let go

Are we our better halves
If we only make it worse?
Are we better off apart
But can't say the words?
When will we learn
You and I
We've come too far in this to see
All we ever do is bleed

When we fight fire with fire
When we cross the line, ayo
Maybe happy ever after's ain't for us
Ain't no surprise
When we play with knives, ayo
Ain't no broken pride and these aren't paper cuts

I know when you're weakest (I know when you're weakest)
You know where my demons hide
Put us on a knife edge (put us on a knife edge)
Ain't no broken pride and these aren't paper cuts
I know when you're weakest (I know when you're weakest)
You know where my demons hide
Put us on a knife edge

Parmas In June,Parmas In June,2020,"I can't wait for parmas in June
With my mates in the local 'till we're carried out the room
I wish I could be there sooner with my whisky shot and schooner
'Cause I can't wait for parmas in June

Yeah, it feels like we're on our way back
Raise an iso glass to that
Stuck on loop
Who knew when the curve turns flat
For the rest of my life singing 'Happy Birthday' is gonna make me wash my hands
The cafe is reopened, it's taking cash
Whole control rocking tracksuits like lads
And the all Murdoch press ganging up on Dan Andrews
It feels like we're back on track

And me and TV needs
Social distancing measures
Z-grade celebs saying, 'We're in this together'
We get it, we get it
But months have passed, it's been hard
Can't hug mum from two metres apart
March and April came and went, May finished
Last thirty degree day I stayed in
And now the news telling me restrictions getting eased, fuck yeah!
Just in time for winter
But all good 'cause

I can't wait for parmas in June
With my mates in the local 'till we're carried out the room
I wish I could be there sooner with my whisky shot and schooner
'Cause I can't wait for parmas in June

Yeah, I swear I'll never trip out of Middle C
I'll fly 'till ? extra baggage fee
Or rocking up before the hotel room ready
Took it for granted, didn't we?
Silly me
I don't mind spending time on my own
I like home
But when it forced, I get the itch to roam
And I can't complain 'bout how bad I got it 'cause the next person in the same boat
And right now we need hope, and that's me included
'Cause shit's weird after two months of being secluded
And in February who the fuck knew what Zoom was
Swear, Uber used to not drop my food off
And don't it all seem so long ago?
And as we crawl slow to the normal we know
Man, every night when I put down my phone I close my eyes I'm dreaming of my first show 'cause

I can't wait for parmas in June
With my mates in the local 'till we're carried out the room
I wish I could be there sooner with my whisky shot and schooner
'Cause I can't wait for parmas in June

And I can't wait to step back on a stage again
If it's not until next year
Just wake me when December ends
From the country to the coast
My band of bros back on the road
Don't know when it will be
But I will see you then

I can't wait for parmas in June
Man, it turns out it's the little things that mean everything, if we only knew
But when day this will end
Be like old times are back again
And look, 
you can call them parmys if you want bro, it's on you

I can't wait for parmas in June
With my mates in the local 'till we're carried out the room
I wish I could be there sooner with my whisky shot and schooner
'Cause I can't wait for parmas in June
I can't wait for parmas in June
With my mates in the local 'till we're carried out the room
I wish I could be there sooner with my whisky shot and schooner
'Cause I can't wait for parmas in June
I can't wait for parmas in June (can't wait for that golden brown schnitty)
With my mates in the local 'till we're carried out the room (with the red sauce and the ham and the melted cheese)
I wish I could be there sooner with my whisky shot and schooner (and I'll go the chips and salad, you can go for the mash and veggies if you want)

Pictures,Long Story Short,2009,"Footprints in the sand, change of plans
Make a new one, take my hand
We're young, we're live
Chasing the memories, not enough time
So I keep a picture in my wallet of you, you, you, you, you
Footprints in the sand, change of plans
Make a new one, take my hand
We're young, we're live
Chasing the memories, not enough time
So I keep a picture in my wallet of you, you, you, you, you

White sands, crystal waters
Can you imagine a world without borders
Imagination don't cave to gravity
These dreams pale this insane reality
Let the pressure come, we shine like a settin' sun
Like the good times never done
Snapshots with fella's in Prague
Or a beach in spain, umbrella in the glass
Board shorts, long necks, cruise through the night
Summertime cowboys do what they like
Move like the tide, sure as there's blue in the sky, the youth got my future on side
Heard pictures a thousand words but I guess that shit ain't about a verse
So I made an album of photos, an album of music
And can't figure which comes first

Footprints in the sand, change of plans
Make a new one, take my hand
We're young, we're live
Chasing the memories, not enough time
So I keep a picture in my wallet of you, you, you, you, you
Footprints in the sand, change of plans
Make a new one, take my hand

Chasing the memories, not enough time
So I keep a picture in my wallet of you, you, you, you, you

Yeah, from behind dark shades
Watch in the skies, man
Like the world in the future in my hands
What more can a young man ask for?
Good mates and stamps in a passport
Light joints on a lonely beach
With a beer and a feed while my hometown sleeps
It's as real as it gets, I can't fake a thing
I moved on but still start to take it in
I swear don't care where I'm at
I'll always have time for a laugh with the lads
I keep memories close to my cash
So I'm never too, too focused on that
And look, I heard pictures a thousand words
But I guess that shit ain't about a verse
So I made a album of photos, an album of music
And can't figure which comes first

Footprints in the sand, change of plans
Make a new one, take my hand

Bad man, bitch, more banded than bandwidth
Tell the forum to suck ballbags
Run the track, no Caulfield or Randwick
But puttin' down like a pure bred holds its advantage
Gold ain't your average, neck up and quit
Gave your disc half a minute, mate, fucking skip
Stiff upper lip, buds piss off
Or bunker down before the clique bum rush your gig
Before something give 'cause my crew
Have accomplished, accomplices on some shit
The real rascals, we bonkers bitch, Taku
Got them basslines, 'bout to make the concrete split
So, take the attitude, leave at the door
It's all love, you know the deal if you'd seen it before
We throw bombs in the mosh, C4 your jaw
And when the motherfucker's screaming for more you give it to 'em like

Like you rolled in literal like glaucoma victims
But the crowd bounce like there ain't a single fucking stoner in 'em
We hit the road like the homeless
And return like homing pigeons, roll like a pig in shit
Black out like solar eclipses
My peeps leap fake Capones holding their stitches
When the front of house and the fallbacks banging
It's a given, follow tradition, get on the band wagon
We pole position, ain't giving an inch and
Ain't willing to  system
These pussies might as well be hair pulling and pinchin'
For all the affect they're havin', Ill's on a mission
I'm killing it,  swift kick to the gut
Run amock, couldn't give two fifths of a fuck
If the man ain't with 'em my foe going

Uh-huh, uh-huh
Yeah, Burn City stand up
Double S, One Dayers
Illy, Illy
Syd City in the house
Illy we looking fly as fuck, man, we joyriding
We joyriding on these toys

For now they call me Mr
Nice, y'all stuck in the pits and I'm glad
You're mad your boat's gone and y'all missed the flight for me
So on, so ready, no wrong
You're tripping off your Haterade mixed with ice, and I—
I know exactly how the scene does
Just between us I'm kinda proud that, Sydney's cleaned up
No diss to my predecessors, I heed your lessons
But Sydney looked dead till I put my team up
You could stumble from the sky and
In all your troubles you could find I'm flyer
Spit it like a scene from 
The Wire
, baby, I'm clean
Still the biggest oughta check my priors
Toy boys, some jack the flow for ransom
If I get my hands on a slice I come back with a loaf
That's food for the family, red light, greed light
Who don't want my team to eat right, huh?
[Chorus: Cisco Taraves & 
Illy
]
We don't stop, we don't stop
For no red lights
Uh-uh, say this shit don't stop
We ride till the end of the line, give me the green light
But to me, all I see is
The gleam of the green in the lights
That's the family, red light, green light
Who don't want my team to eat right, huh?
We don't stop, we don't stop
For no red lights
Uh-uh, say this shit don't stop
We ride till the end of the line, give me the green light
But to me, all I see is
The gleam of the green in the lights
That's the family, red light, green light
Who don't want my team to eat right, huh?

It's been a minute since I picked up the pen
But Illy put the call out, so I'm 'bout to buck the trend
And ball out, but I'm not talking bucks my friend
I'm not rich in what I got, but what I got to give
Sitting in gridlock city traffic
Monday madness got us stuck in stasis
But I'ma do a Tracy Chapman
Hop a fast car, hit the gas, never look backwards
See we come pretty far since sixteen years
Way more than I could fit in these sixteen bars
A couple deadlines later
We made a couple headlines, got the haters up past their bed time
So from the Inner West lines to wherever these lines take me
We hit the brakes if we have to
But if not (But if not,) we non stop (We non stop)
Suckers seeing red, all I'm seeing's the green light
[Chorus: Cisco Taraves & 
Illy
]
We don't stop, we don't stop
For no red lights
Uh-uh, say this shit don't stop
We ride till the end of the line, give me the green light
But to me, all I see is
The gleam of the green in the lights
That's the family, red light, green light
Who don't want my team to eat right, huh?
We don't stop, we don't stop
For no red lights
Uh-uh, say this shit don't stop
We ride till the end of the line, give me the green light
But to me, all I see is
The gleam of the green in the lights
That's the family, red light, green light
Who don't want my team to eat right, huh?


As soon as the lights change I'm with a baby
Everything in my range, yeah I hit it, I'm crazy
Lupi: It's so good, it's so gravy
These rappers shook, looking like they just seen Swayze
There ain't much more than a cinema screen
As I stare back eyes with a villainous gleam
So what you wan' do, girl? Just give me the green
And I'ma do what I do, yeah, get you to dream
Soon as I hit Melly, Illy on the cell
And he got some five broads at the telly and I wonder
If they only wanna fuck 'cause I'm in Spit Syndicate
But, more importantly, do I give a shit?
Oh no, not even a little bit, I'm a boss
I'm interstate, then any minute taking off
Nouveau riche, Nick the Don in the inner west
Get busy boys and we getting it on, I'm gone
[Chorus: Cisco Taraves & 
Illy
]
We don't stop, we don't stop
For no red lights
Uh-uh, say this shit don't stop
We ride till the end of the line, give me the green light
But to me, all I see is
The gleam of the green in the lights
That's the family, red light, green light
Who don't want my team to eat right, huh?
We don't stop, we don't stop
For no red lights
Uh-uh, say this shit don't stop
We ride till the end of the line, give me the green light
But to me, all I see is (Yeah)
The gleam of the green in the lights (Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh)
That's the family, red light, green light ()
Who don't want my team to eat right, huh?
 ()

So I gotta match the attitude, still much respect
To those that blaze the same avenues I use
But to come from the shadows in the city of kings
Can't give a shit what anyone thinks, so with that
I said, ""Fuck waiting in the wings"" Leapfrog them
Jog and I'd still run rings, no problem
Dig no turbo, no tints, fuck it, I don't need rims
I could tram it and have your girlfriend want dibs

Wanna get their toes wet, jump in (Come on)
But take it as a warning, I won't hit the brake, I hit the horn
So if you in my sights, goodnight ()
And baby, if they stopping at the red light wave 'em goodbye
 
from I Dub to Frankston line
A young gun with a , allow me to remind 'em

We don't stop, we don't stop
For no red lights
Uh-uh, say this shit don't stop
We ride till the end of the line, give me the green light
But to me, all I see is
The gleam of the green in the lights
That's the family, red light, green light
Who don't want my team to eat right, huh?
We don't stop, we don't stop
For no red lights
Uh-uh, say this shit don't stop
We ride till the end of the line, give me the green light
But to me, all I see is

Riptide, Friday Flips: Season 2,2015,"Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Yeah, yeah. And I remember, I remember, yeah yeah
And I remember all the times I'd ignore my cues
Either let it pass by or talk to soon
That's the thing about dreams they don't all come true
But I won't let a little rain spoil my view
I guess it's growing up, I caught those blues
Wish the floor would open up and I'd fall right through
Switch skies, riptides any shore would do
Somewhere over the Atlantic I thought of you
And I swear, name a time and place and I'm there
Let the world try and find us
Take her away to the dark side and she still shine in the room of young Michelle Pfeiffer's
My bad, can't be mad where it's at is so far from where it began, yeah
The main event is still a humble fan
Life long memory, one night stand, but

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Yeah yeah, and I mean even I've told you life's a song
Either, write your own or recite it wrong
And it ain't always clear what side their on
You gotta play the right angle, 9 o'clock so
Check your watch, go time we're off
I've got a lump in my throat and right now lost
I've been between what comes next and remember them days
Every second spent, every cent made
Between the new crew and the friends that I met in tenth grade
Stayed together didn't fade, I'm a lucky man
Cause since I didn't have a buck in hand
I've been blessed, and in wherever the sum I land
And this a trip, better than the one I planned
Some by fate and some by chance, and it's just my luck, I spun my jams
In to a life long memory, one night stand, but

Illy
(1, 2, 3, 4)
Yeah, let’s go

Yeah, live grenade when the drum is laid
Machine gun , game by the bass
And, even by another name
A wack rapper’s still a wack rapper, same shit, different day, man, nothing changed
Let the snake slide to the last snake
Like a hurricane, it’s come correct or it’s come again
I took the hard road, when the rest wondered down lovers’ lane
It’s how I take my tracks where the others 
A dirty game and I did mine
Fuck big lies, my words ain’t to live off, they’re to live by
The hype’ll fuck you if you let it
The hoods proved you ain’t gotta slum it to make something poetic
My life’s a movie, still looking for the message
Crossed fingers, happy ending come before the credits
Baby, if it’s banging, you can bet it’s M-Phazes
On the beat, and Illy trailblazing when we kicking this
It’s Crooked Eye with the wickedness
So you ain’t gotta guess who the sickest is, motherfucker

This is rock star shit, yeah baby, come with the hard shit
Turn it to a moshpit, do it like that (like that)
Let ‘em know where the fuck we’re from
M-Phazes, Illy Al on a song, now
Rock star shit, yeah baby, come with the hard shit
Turn it to a moshpit, do it like that (like that)
Let ‘em know what the fuck we’re on
Too strong to be stopped, too right to be wrong

The Bon Scott of the bomb drop
The key  to the Skryptcha, bitch get the picture
This the product, the hard liquor mixed substance
And skills too dope to fit in whizlahs, zigzags
Or Tally Ho’s, to all those rocking shabby flows
Time to clean your act up, laddie, daddy’s home
They can compete but can’t come close, nah
They twist statue, posturing like an oath
That old beaten rouge, sipping glass of 
With a  bag of stones, waiting to unload
Some like  show me how your arm is 
Take more than that to tarnish me 
Kill me with warmth, I invite you
The cold shoulders only make me hold onto self-belief tighter
So, if you’re with me, grab your lighters
Pump a fist for the music, living fast  sideways
One sixty on the highway
So, if you do the speed limit, get the fuck out of my way

This is rock star shit, yeah baby, come with the hard shit
Turn it to a moshpit, do it like that (like that)
Let ‘em know where the fuck we’re from
M-Phazes, Illy Al on a song, now
Rock star shit, yeah baby, come with the hard shit
Turn it to a moshpit, do it like that (like that)
Let ‘em know what the fuck we’re on
Too strong to be stopped, too right to be wrong

I’m living proof that the truth hurts
And ain’t a crew worth their salt that ain’t know that this dude lurks
I’m like “who’s first to get the short views?""
Think I’m tripping out (shit) I’m still waiting ‘til the shrews work
Spitting sharp angles 
Cutting lies, stars  out of Andrew's guitar
Want to leave my mark on people’s hearts
 John Lennon in west Central Park
 jealousy  fall upon you
Let it known, I ain't ever played the stonch, dude
I ain't even want to
My skills got me this far so it's them that gotta make me
Love to the fans,  like my love to my fam
Two hyptheticals and one in the hand
So I take stock on what I got, eye on the haters
‘Cause Kurt Cobain showed it only take one shot
We are off the charts, we can’t be stopped
Melbourne city stand up like what

This is rock star shit, yeah baby, come with the hard shit
Turn it to a moshpit, do it like that (like that)
Let ‘em know where the fuck we’re from
M-Phazes, Illy Al on a song, now
Rock star shit, yeah baby, come with the hard shit
Turn it to a moshpit, do it like that (like that)

Yeah
All city journeymen, rolling highways, dirt roads
And everything in between, just another version of home
Melbournian show-stealer, feel I'm worthy but know
Don't always work according to plan, gotta learn as you go
And I found life's a game of inches, I'm still playing, gaining digits
Making calls, so if i fail, never blame it on indifference
Since when train missions to Obese were every teenage listeners
Right of passage, discern banging boom-bap there and back
I remember wagging to visit, imagine me when the chance was given
To weave my own stories in at 4A Izett's
Couldn't wake me up with pinches, if the launch opened the door
Then the block party blew it off the hinges
Fast forward a year, and its my second LP, but I'm Victorian baby
Already coming after three, don't worry 'bout me
I'm straight, rep my city by the bay
Spread love, all day, every day

And all I know is that I love our music, I rep my town
We stand too strong here to ever step down
Now they all hooked, I never change, let 'em know
That it's all good, same number, same hood
And I love our music, I rep my town
We stand too strong here to ever step down
Now they all hooked, I never change, let 'em know
That it's all good, same number, same hood

I'm paying forward all the chances that the Melbourne scene gave me
Represent for 'em, even if it ain't reciprocated
To the kids with a dream writing rhymes to make their statement
This is where hard work, and a lot of heart can take it
In fact I've barely began, with steady hands I'ma plan
Craft mine for the fam, and the friends, and the fans
But they don't need me to tell 'em, they've already planted the flag
For hip hop, on burnt copies of American bands
I'm in the bay-side sunshine, repping for the Frankston line
And that's where I'ma be residing when they call time
This culture of kings kept me honest when I had a dream
A ballpoint pen, and nothing in my wallet
Swore if I got a hold of what I wanted, I'd be bringing it home
And I'ma work fingers to bone to keep the promise
This is one love for the kids still struggling
Melbourne city, bar none, but nothing

And all I know is that I love our music, I rep my town
We stand too strong here to ever step down
Now they all hooked, I never change, let 'em know
That it's all good, same number, same hood
And I love our music, I rep my town
We stand too strong here to ever step down
Now they all hooked, I never change, let 'em know
That it's all good, same number, same hood

Save Me,Cinematic,2013,"Somebody help me, I need a doctor, clear!
So put that call out, there ain't no other option near
I can hear them sirens, sirens, coming to revive me, cause
I'm out here blinding, my baby shoots on sight
But I, don't mind, done both sides
Don't blink, won't front, won't hide
And her fire the same as mine, so
We're both in that line of fire
My baby's a killer: Ain't one thing that I would change
But she got me in that crosshair: Those arrows on their way
I'm sayin

Help me, come save me
Before she puts me straight to the ground
'Cause my heart ain't for the taking
And you know I ain't playing around
You know that we're, side by side
It's all fair in love and war
Side by side
You know it's all fair in love and war, Love and war

Big threat in a small frame
Dead set with a sure aim
An AK to my saw blade
She don't fight, she play war games
Little miss misdirection strikes when it's least expected
Sweetheart slash lethal weapon
Love me then leave me for dead
Over my head, checking my front
Watching my back when the next drink comes
Could be red wine or red rum, ta!
My advice: Shoot first, or get done
I've been told 'bout sticks and stones
My baby's pro with the click, clack so
We took ten steps, I tripped, I froze
She unload, reload, Bang

Help me, come save me
Before she puts me straight to the ground
'Cause my heart ain't for the taking
And you know I ain't playing around
You know that we're, side by side
It's all fair in love and war
Side by side
You know it's all fair in love and war, Love and war

Fair in love and war
Stood in silence
No one made a sound till
Bang, Bang, My baby shot me down
Maybe I won't make it home
Chalk my name on a grave stone
Hardly able to say no
Tempt fate: That's the way it goes
Said she loved me the most, then
Took aim, let go, unload, unload, unload
That's all she wrote

Help me, come save me
Before she puts me straight to the ground
'Cause my heart ain't for the taking
And you know I ain't playing around
You know that we're, side by side
It's all fair in love and war
Side by side

Say It To Me,Bring It Back,2012,"You ain't got nothing on these moves, you're two left feet
Years since I've been beat, you can suck it through your teeth loose
We beat the beat until it's blue, black and beetroot
Leave it to bleed through, please, no need you
Can miss me with the critics and reviews
From peeps who couldn't move a couple feet in my shoes
Dismiss me fuckers, but there's one thing to claim
Not so easy to prove, how would you reach your conclusion
Without leaping to them, so peace then
I'm keeping out it, deep in the beats, yeah we shoe ins
Nothing new, spit it to me, I've copped it for all
From my lyrics to finishing uni. And dissing didn't move me
Whether from another continent, interstate
Or in your face, still hit the stage not a minute late
Still, any given day, haters gonna hate
So let my work rate vindicate. And, if it ain't, then say it to me

""You wanna hate me then hate me""
""When you on top there's-there's envy""
""Well, fuck it, I ain't budging""
""Get at me if you want more""
""You wanna hate me then hate me""
""The critics are blasting me""
""You know the type, loud as motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight""

I made the music I wanted, gave a fuck who's watching
Wound up on a route, just a couple of dudes trodding
Sudden move such as it doesn't prove often
The outcome's left me with one of two options
Either fight everyone who targets me. Or
Move forward, accepting you can't win 'em all
When success breeds hate, the bigger you are man
Harder you fall, that's just par for the course
So I took the latter, climbed the ladder
Got a foothold in the crack of a door
Footprints on their arse crack to match with their jaw
They cooked and battered, me bringing it raw
Bringing a tour de force of fucking awesome, grand prix of sick
But don't take my word for shit, just peep the gigs
Fuck what you think, don't matter, watch what I did
You can't win, and still wanna talk shit? Fine, but say it to me

""You wanna hate me then hate me""
""When you on top there's-there's envy""
""Well, fuck it, I ain't budging""
""Get at me if you want more""
""You wanna hate me then hate me""
""The critics are blasting me""
""You know the type, loud as motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight""

Now, I've been struck off as simple when judged off my singles
By boys who ain't finished popping pimples
Fucking with the botox flow dog, check your bifocals
Rub your lenses, it's no wrinkles
Iron smooth, I improved
Y'all impaired, try, lose
Like that's news, like that's shit that I'd fight back to
Like that shit's gonna light the fuse, mmm, nah
Took near a decade to find my voice
And six months more to be a target, so go on fire up boys
Stay mad, unheard and unsigned by choice
Yeah right ""by choice""
It is what it is, I remember old heads said ""Son
Kill 'em all, then quit when ahead or get done""
But I'll never quit and God willing never slump once
But, if that day ever does come, I just ask that you say it to me

""You wanna hate me then hate me""
""When you on top there's-there's envy""
""Well, fuck it, I ain't budging""
""Get at me if you want more""
""You wanna hate me then hate me""
""The critics are blasting me""
""You know the type, loud as motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight""

Illy, M-Phazes, Friday Flips #2
White strips, Seven Nation Army
Fuck you know Phazes is going to kill this one
I had some shit written to this
I had to change it at the last minute
Pay homage to a legend
I don't mean any disrespect if I haven't done this well enough
Check it out

Fire up the DeLorean, hit the time warp
2012 Melbourne, 80's New York
Twist bottle tops, I don't pop corks
Mic is my tommy gun, pen is my sword
We could go to war, bum rush ya fort
Seven nation army couldn't hold us back with force
They all talk, so allow my retort
I do dirt but I don't get caught
Sell records but I won't be bought
Put that in your companies quarterly report
Kick raps till my voice is horse
Cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce
Rhyme reason and cause, I hold all cards
And to sucka emcee’s its sabotage

Just put your hands up high
And hold your lighters to the sky
And would you please make noise
This ones for the beastie boys

MCA R.I.P
Stay sucka free, I know it's all G
Cause I’ma tell you like a rapper told me
We all intergalactic planetary
But we losing our idols, times up, needle off the vinyl
Pray for an end a little less final
We seldom see timeless in this age of album cycles
Where bottom lines more vital than messages recited
They glamourise basic, for advertising space, and generations raised with televisions on
All the media portrayed with Chris Brown is basically you're  able to hit women long
As you can sing a song
Mmm, nah, wrong, I ain’t having that
Young girls hear of whips and chains in Rihanna's trash
And tough guy rappers say if you ain’t a tough guy rapper
""You a faggot"", Jesus caveman thanks for that
I’m fitting somewhere in the middle
Actually I’m to the side of it all, cause all they trying to score
Points off of is talk, but listen to what their saying
No substance, no thought, both sides the same
You don't need to buy into it, or give a shit
Or think because its in your face, you gotta be interested
You don't, fuck it, we all, choose
Cause while they profit, music loses
I was probably born a generation late
To the beastie boys party, but they still had a place
In my teenage life, so its only right I pay
My respects, to a caliber we hardly find these days
So rest in peace to the late MCA
Not saying he's a prophet, but this next clips from '98
Fuck the gloss and lollipop shit
How many pop culture icons drop knowledge like this...",https://genius.com/Illy-seven-nation-army-lyrics
Sometimes,Friday Flips: Season 1,2012,"Sometimes we chase what's out of reach, and
Sometimes it's easy, sometimes you grind like your peaking
Sometimes to climb up you dig deep, cause
Sometimes life's a contradiction, sometimes completely
And sometimes it's aligning of the planets
But most times, it's blood sweat and tears with two hands
And I know sometimes life won't go the way you planned and
Sometimes, sometimes, I don't even understand it, but
Fuck it, we still party like we young forever
Shining stars, warm as stage lights, tough as leather
When we look back at all the shit we done together
It was me and my people, only you, come whatever
And cause of that, and with props to Big
Damn right we turn the negative to positive
Cause sometimes it's the life you wanna live
Verse the life you got, and sometimes, something’s gotta give
Lets go

Sometimes, when all that's lost remains
Drink from the fountain of youth and never age again
Sometimes we jump across to every cloud
Fly away, get lost and never be found

And sometimes I just wanna lose myself
Sometimes I refuse when I could use the help
But even when I’m scraping by, like tooth and nail
It's always 'bout way more than if my music sells
Sometimes some might, take a couple steps
But none work hard as me, except for my brother M-
Phases, cold fact, so goodnight and good luck to them
Sometimes just being humble bucks the trend
Sometimes the way it is, ain’t how the finish be
Sometimes history will look and judge differently
Sometimes a pan flash, sometimes a dynasty
And sometimes you will lose, but never lose dignity
And sometimes it's tough, no excuse to pass the buck
Sometimes you've heard it all before, shit, half my luck
And sometimes the balance act can't be struck
Sometimes it's heads down, sometimes glasses up, glasses up

Sometimes, when all that's lost remains
Drink from the fountain of youth and never age again
Sometimes we jump across to every cloud
Fly away, get lost and never be found
Sometimes, when all that's lost remains
Drink from the fountain of youth and never age again
Sometimes we jump across to every cloud
Fly away, get lost and never be found

Swear Jar,Two Degrees,2015,"Way back in adolescence, I learnt one simple lesson
First impressions last and showing love don't take much effort
I fanned out on an idol, got brushed and still won't forget it
So these days when I see artists on that too cool shit my message to 'em's like
All due respect here there's no respect due
So fuck you, fuck you, man
Some artists on that high horse like they just put 
Thriller
 out
Some artist care about music less than Instagram accounts
They told me drink that Kool-Aid, oh, hell nah, I spit that out
And as much as I would love to give the benefit of doubt
I'm saying. nah

All due respect here, there's no respect due
If you in it for the status I dedicate this to you, I'm sayin'

Fuck you and you and you
And you, you're cool, fuck you and I'm outta here
Fuck you and you and you
And you, you're cool, but fuck you and I'm outta here
All due respect here, there's no respect due
So fuck you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, let's flip that to the wild shit people say to get attention
You know the reason mama said don't read no comment sections
I'd hit back but whenever I tell them kiss my bare arse
My two cents got me emptying my wallet in a swear jar
Still all due respect here, there's no respect due
So fuck you, oh my bad
Pardon my french (putain) big no-no, wash my mouth out with soap, oh
You don't like it, by all means, yo, hit my socials, let me know so
Hold breathe till I reply then die waitin' then have your folks post
Funeral details online so I can come take 
Snapchat photos, man

All due respect here, there's no respect due
If you spend all day online just cutting down what people do my words to you are

Fuck you and you and you
And you, you're cool, but fuck you and I'm outta here
Fuck you and you and you
And you, you're cool, ah, fuck you and I'm outta here
All due respect here, there's no respect due
So fuck you

ONETWO, ONETWO
Now ladies and gentleman I know I'm not perfect, hell
I'm probably guilty of this shit myself
But, ah, I tried, oh, I try not to put myself above nobody
Or get my kicks kicking someone else, yeah
But if you tired of the bullshit people throw your way
I've got this one little phrase that helps, it goes

Fuck you and you and you
And you, you're cool, fuck you and I'm outta here
Fuck you and you and you

Talk,Cinematic,2013,"I hear 'em talk, but I'm not listening
I hear 'em talk, but I don't hear a thing
I hear 'em talk, but I'm not listening
And everywhere I turn turn turn turn...

I feel my ears burning, whispers turn to a roar
Play games till the curtain call
Till the truth ain't heard no more
Burdens fall like sunlight
(Seel like brick)
Watch that word go round, too loud, turn that down
And face that furnace now, burn them bridges down
I keep my kicks clean, my name clean
My aim high, they waist deep
They play with fire they change themes
They-They lie, they-they cheat please...
Leave that trash talk in the gutter
Ain't fuck to the gutter in a minute yo
With all there like a back bone
But I wonder what the motives are but you never know!
I hear rumours let them be
I hear that truth sets you free
Less you want, less you need, just after space, let me breathe
I'm above that ""he-said-she-said"" leave that shit to the gossip columns
They can comb that top-to-bottom
Their issue, not my problem
I don't see how we should care what they speak about
Fact is they'll always be story tellers as long as there is people to tell
People gonna take the fact, twist the fact we package and re-sell
I don't blink or skip a beat I shake their hand I wish 'em well
I'm yelling

It’s an earthquake, all you can make is noise about my life
It’s a battlefield when shit gets real, I’ll leave you behind
It’s an earthquake, all you can make is noise about my life
It’s a battlefield when shit gets real, I’ll leave you behind

They tell them white lies, they blindside
They drop bombs, they pile drive
They spark they spread like wild fire
Same times I light mine up
We-we move in the same circles
All work in our own angles
Note from that gate it'll hurt you
But you don't earn what you don't handle
Never in a noose knot
If I'm going down, going down with my boots on
Ha, fuck rules brah
Show me a good loser I show you a loser
Most of you loyal when it suits you
But I ain't immune to manoeuvres
Shit I ain't afraid of a little dirt
Just say the word we'll do this
I'm baptised in fire ain't been burnt well
Once or twice but lesson learnt
Cold revenge the sweetest thing and
Success best way that served
So Bon appetit you can eat your words and
Get what you deserve
Get what, get what you deserve
I feel like ""gossip, gossip"" never the truth
Ain't got nothing better to do
After the lowest levels been stooped
What comes next for you?
Make your move we can go to battle
Words are weapons loaded barrel
Cause if I click this trigger finger watch how fast this travels like...

I can pound, pound, pound on my chest
I can beat down the dark with my iron fist
Your shit don’t weigh me down no more
I stand tall and proud while you run your mouth
I can pound, pound, pound on my chest
I can beat down the dark with my iron fist
Your shit don’t weigh me down no more
I stand tall and proud while you run your mouth

It’s an earthquake, all you can make is noise about my life

Out to get respect upon the mic, I hope they felt it
No originator, more a second gen
A main participator of the paper and pen (yeah)
Props, no fad, became a longterm member
Hip-hop's my drink, a twenty-five year bender
Take you way back to the eyes of the beholder
Initially I was infantry, a late eighties soldier
Way before revolver homies and lads
Used to sport pony and chill with undergrads
Went from theory to practice, 
three stripes and maxes
Batter down the hatches, fights and malpractice
I called your bluff and tried to keep it fresh, bro
I just can't get enough like Depeche Mode
(Woop woop) was the sound of Obese
(Woop woop) I'm out and just peace

""I was born with the boom—boom—boom bap""
""I'm a rhy—rhyme ar—artist""
""And let me say a rhy—rhyme in your ear""
""I was born with the—
Boom—boom—boom bap""
 
""It was all a dream""
""Long as the mic is loud and the volume's pumpin'
I'ma move crowds to two-thousand and somethin'""
 (yeah)

From battle raps in backyards, back when the accent
Was a replica of rap stars, I didn't know better
Heard Bias B's ""Hursty"" and overnight the U.S. style
That I'd flirted with converted to my native tongue
I met up with some older lads in school, remember riding nine to a van
To see mates play gigs to twenty fans
When Obese Records was the mecca
Sharing ciggies with Muph on Izzett St at the shopfront, I remember
Playing Solomon my demo tracks, remember hanging at
Prahran park parties, drinking metre's from where legend's sat
Too shy to speak, but too inspired to leave
Pegz's 350Z may as well have been a Rolls-Royce to me
Since, I've did it on my own, still I tip my hat for those
Who made it possible, and wouldn't even know
Cheers for that, bridge the gap, resonate on the track
Single moments in time, generations of rap like... that

""I was born with the boom—boom—boom bap""
""I'm a rhy—rhyme ar—artist""
""And let me say a rhy—rhyme in your ear""
""I was born with the—
Boom—boom—boom bap""
 
""It was all a dream""
""Long as the mic is loud and the volume's pumpin'
I'ma move crowds to two-thousand and somethin'""

Like it all began in 2006, spinning Def Wish up in my Discman
 Showing love to the ones that weren't afraid to go the distance
Persistence and train trips with mates, it amazed me
I'm looking back now loving that it wasn't the mainstream
Embracing what I saw deemed as a dream
Was different to the other kids while living through my teens
I seemed free, though intrigued by defeating the reach
Eighteen perceiving the means, which involved achieving to be
Everything I wanted too, 
inspired by the culture of kings
Since Hilltop I had some love for the shit
Pumped for the gigs, train rides to the city of sins
Rhyming syllables every time if the line wasn't in
Building a bridge in order to branch the gap, influenced advance to rap
An answer back from being a fan of that
Infatuated from the Capricorn cat
And now months after my first track, I've enacted a firm grab

""I was born with the boom—boom—boom bap""
""I'm a rhy—rhyme ar—artist""
""And let me say a rhy—rhyme in your ear""
""I was born with the—
Boom—boom—boom bap""
 
""It was all a dream""

The Chase,The Chase,2010,"The chase, the chase, the chase
The chase, the chase, the chase
The chase, the chase, the chase
The chase, the chase, the chase
The chase, the chase, the chase
The chase, the chase, the chase
The chase, the chase, the chase
The chase, the chase, the chase

Ayy yo, I'm putting the pedal to metal
Might as well cut the breaks 'cause we don't stop
And we don't wait until it's too late
Ayo, I'm putting the pedal to metal
Red line for the chase, full tilt
We hit the red line for the chase

Welcome to the chase, that's life man
What you can hold up in your left and your right hand
And it could change overnight with the right plan
With little more than a Mac book and a mic stand, look where I took it
And I don't tail coats, nor suits and ties
And I don't ride coat tails, bye to the routine, I'm
Buckled up for a beautiful, if at times
Suitable for vagabond dude type life
Don't view it as failure if I miss it
I just figure I proved that that way gets turfed
In the process of elimination
Gotta keep proving wrongs till the right one works
So we're perseverin', polishin' the tracks
Till it hurts to hear em, 'bout to embark
On the journey of an era, so it's only right
I'ma build us a ship worth steering, say it with me

Ayy yo, I'm putting the pedal to metal
Might as well cut the breaks 'cause we don't stop
And we don't wait until it's too late
Ayo, I'm putting the pedal to metal
Red line for the chase, full tilt
We hit the red line for the chase (yeah)

Screw the rules if they mess with the tune of my message
What's expected, can't touch what you're doing if its' destined
Do the hard yards, step by footstep
'Cause with opportunity comes effort
It's more than a debate on whose is the greatest
Credits due to all the true imitators
I followed in their footsteps, now I'm blazing
A new trail for the future, till fruits of my labour
Are ripe for the tasting, forever be chasing
Success, it's for those who despite condemnation
Kept going, and failures forsaken
For those who didn't know how close they were when they gave in
Stay patient, but don't hesitate
'Cause everything comes to those who hustle while they wait
So let em kick back, I'ma overtake their place
I'ma chase it until it ain't a chase, but for now I'm saying

Ayy yo, I'm putting the pedal to metal
Might as well cut the breaks 'cause we don't stop
And we don't wait until it's too late
Ayo, I'm putting the pedal to metal
Red line for the chase, full tilt
We hit the red line for the chase

I make a promise to you mama
If I don't end up a lawyer, swear I'll still be a rich motherfucker
One way or another
But I don't need all the world's money in my life to love it
I'm gonna ride for the come up, rise till I lay down
Shine till the sun's up, rhyme till I break ground
Lights blurred, no safety belt
I'm on the chase hard out man, success ain't gonna make itself
And I ain't gonna wake when I'm old
In regret that I woke out of a dream, just to chase the gold
Nah I'ma hold tight on this rollercoaster
Of a ride called life, and I am
Prepared for the worst but expecting the best
You can ride alongside or get left for dead
Repping A.U.S man, Melbourne in the place
Since we finish where we start yo, welcome to the chase

Ayy yo, I'm putting the pedal to metal
Might as well cut the breaks 'cause we don't stop
And we don't wait until it's too late

The Real,Bring It Back,2012,"Yeah, Who gonna equal this, none of them count
The sum's the whole of their parts so no point interrupting 'em now
They just divide themselves by themselves, staying boxed under the ground
Square roots, no fucking around, we nail it
They tools man, they wanna compare cuticles
The last one's standing out, like the chair's musical
Peace and games now, but ain't a distant scene to see
The blast cavities indicative the history between us
It's been war, and all's fair in it
Beware of the truth, can't raise troops off of fairy bread
At this range, our caliber won't put a hole in your head
They'll blow your head clean off your neck, bomb squad stomp in
Lock step, Illy Al, Grey Ghost, Mantrizzle
Trigga Trials in the building, supplying death till demand filled
It's a minefield, blow up appeal
Their LP's landfill soon as we sign seal and deliver the real, uh

""Hydro Bazooka shit"" ""Hit em where it hurts""
""Blow them motherfucking back—back out""
""We keeps it real inside the battlefield-battlefield
Battle-battle-battlefield""
""This ain’t rap-rapping""
""This is warfare""""Bitch""
""Nobody move ‘til I say-say so""
""Time’s up over-over, blaow!""

I traded in an AK47 for a pile of 45S
So my weapon is the music in the war tonight
Call this gorilla warfare cos I'm about to go ape shit
Grey Ghost/Jeremedy double agent
Door to door killer, semi-automatic villain
Spit it at a million miles a minute 'til I'm finished
Send a prayer to mother earth cos we tortured to girl
Write lyrics as a way of declaring war on the world
Words of mass destruction (WMDS)
Instructions only seen by a couple of MC's
Playing cops and robbers, I would always play cadet
A plank of wood with a stick taped to it as a bayonet
A rapscallion's adorned in medallions
Don't ever wanna fuck with me and my battalion
Strictly lyrical kid, criminal mind
Scribble over your lyric page to cross enemy lines

""Hydro Bazooka shit"" ""Hit em where it hurts""
""Blow them motherfucking back—back out""
""We keeps it real inside the battlefield-battlefield
Battle-battle-battlefield""
""This ain’t rap-rapping""

""Nobody move ‘til I say-say so""
""Time’s up over-over, blaow!""

Who could even assume that another living human
Could possibly do what I'm doing, let alone prove it
I move in and out of reality, truly unique anatomy
This unity on a track is nuclear fusion
A volatile, highly flammable, collusion of chemicals
Caught on a collision course with whoever try stepping to
Arms dealer got my crew standing sentinel
Checking the bomb is armed and to the letter exceptional
No expectations, we merely make examples
Rap to break records, occasionally clear samples
Tamper with the fabric of classic rap shit
Put a tear right through it and stare right through it
As far as I'm concerned, it's there for my amusement
So when I tear mics, dude, it's meat at my truest
Soothsaying superhuman sharp shooter, who's playing?
I'm aiming at you, setting 'em ablaze in the booth

Comical shit (?) It's horrible shit
Couldn't tell the difference between comical and wit
Shit, these new Jacks bring the poker face back
And we don't like jokers in the pack

They trying to hard to be unrehearsed
You joking but forgot to be funny first (uuh)
Call me a cunt 'cause I don't mince words (nah)
Well you're a shit cunt and that's worse (ahaha)

One or two dudes, man, they won't do nothing (nope)
But give 'em  and a little bit of booze
And the fuckwit status shines through (there it is)
And I got the same problem wear the trackie pants or the fubu jeans
Same deal wear the kappa jackets or fluoro tees ()
Psychopaths could be chilling out the back, relax
But their little mate's looking for a scrap

Tightrope,Cinematic,2013,"I was like what you want me to do?
She was like ""what you want me to choose?""
I was like well I didn't say that, but you know
Help me help you
I'm on the balance beam to keep you happy
Or say fuck it, stay mad at me
Know how that goes, drink, fight, patch things up in the back of a taxi
She can skate thin ice on wheels and not once get wet
She could walk fine lines in heels, not one foot out of step
And I swear I'll leave you swept, off your feet it's just I guess
I'm falling hard myself here, yeah over my head

Yeah, it's like I'm walking on a tightrope
And every step could be the one where I fall
It's like I'm running with a blindfold
And I could be wrong but I don't know, I don't know

Headed for the deep end
Thursday we fight and forget it by the weekend
Fast learner, I figured out quick
With her it's not the getting it's the keeping
Cause she's a gem
So everyone wants her shinning with them
Gettin' my bulldog on bro
Mind your step, keep it on your side of the fence
I play my demo's (one last one)
Smile if she likes it, (laugh if it sucks)
Cold blooded, she the first in my corner
But now, what's that if it ain't called love
When it's all said and done
Baby ain't happy till my head's spun
So I might get lucky, I might get none
Like I'm right back at square one

It's like I'm walking on a tightrope
And every step could be the one where I fall
It's like I'm running with a blindfold
And I can't help but feel that I'm about to lose control
It's like I'm walking on a tightrope, running with a blindfold
Rolling with my eyes closed, Woah!
It's like I'm walking on a tightrope, and I could be wrong
But I don't know, I don't know

It's like I'm walking on a tightrope
And every step could be the one where I fall
It's like I'm running with a blindfold
And I can't help but feel that I'm about to lose control
It's like I'm walking on a tightrope, running with a blindfold

Truce,Two Degrees,2016,"Yeah, and it goes like this
Love at first sight, brought you on the greenest
You're music to their ears, symphony completed
You see it, and you believe
From top of your New Era, to the souls on your Adidas
You couldn't put a foot wrong even if you wanted
There's magic in your moves, they all tell you that you got it
But that vibe got a shelf life and the clocks ticking
You can tell when it felt right, then it didn't, and
They say it's gone to your head
Dammit, it was all love when you wasn't a threat
And scare yourself to death, expectations ain't met
Second guess every move
That paranoia don't mean it ain't true, it's on you
No one hear you calling for help
Battle lines in your mind, in a war with yourself
And you drown in the shots, ringing out all around yelling
""Man down, man down, man down""

And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know the breaks
And I know, I know, I know, I know, it's all to lose
But I know, I know, I know, you are not your mistakes
So I call, I call, I call, I call, I call a truce

Yeah, preempting my own fate
Feel me fading away at the going rate
Convinced and inevitable, fall from grace
Fear mixed, we're hating myself for shit that I can't change
For my opinion over anyone else
You think there's anything they're saying
I ain't thought of myself?
Fuck it I'm nothing, less that that
A fraud man, better if I wasn't here
Wrestle those thoughts to the floor
Like a fuck if I defeat myself, before my turn
I prefer to assume the worst, then to get hurt
When success is self worth, lines blur
Perfect storm of outside force, and self-saboteur
'Cause the world scratch the surface, barely sinks teeth in
But personal demons, could tear me to pieces
I know they say to know, 'you're not alone'
But no one else inside this fucking war zone
Like

And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know the breaks
And I know, I know, I know, I know, it's all to lose
But I know, I know, I know, you are not your mistakes
So I call, I call, I call, I call, I call a truce

Yeah, so this it how it ends
Better getting by with a little help from you're friends
Going without, accepting what up within
Self-respect and self-forgiveness
That's a hell of a thing
And if it's out of my hands and control
Then I don't really talk about that anymore
Won't always be the good days, for sure it'll storm
But you can't feel the black cloud above 'til it's gone
Yeah but live and let live, 
Coup de grâce
I gets heavy but just know, this too shall pass
Man, solace is a promise land
Two hands, either end of an olive branch
And it cannot change without reason
My inner peace, still a long shot, but I'm reaching
I know what, when I say it's all good and I actually believe it
Believe it, believe it
Yeah

And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know the breaks
(I know the breaks)
And I know, I know, I know, I know, it's all to lose (yeah)
But I know, I know, I know, you are not your mistakes
(You are not your mistakes)
So I call, I call, I call, I call, I call a truce

And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know the breaks
And I know, I know, I know, I know, it's all to lose
But I know, I know, I know, you are not your mistakes
So I call, I call, I call, I call, I call a truce

And sometimes I'm like, ""Fuck it, why even try?""
Then a message from a fan, will say I saved their life
So just know, inspiration has a two-way street
I drive myself crazy, then you save me
So let's see where the new day leads
Let the motor run, I know it can be hard trynna open up
But at the heart of the matter, man it's only love
And if you don't know your own story, no one does",https://genius.com/Illy-truce-lyrics
Two Degrees,Two Degrees,2016,"Word to Obama

Ain't no revolutions, I just move it two degrees
Then two degrees, then two degrees

Real influence, lead by example not decree
I keep my focus tied to the music and not a scene
And I've been through it all, just doing this for sport
I'm kind of getting bored of beating the top score, y'all
It's Illy man, Baysides boy, Nepean made
Roamed, wasn't built in a day, this started '98
Since a kid, been scribbling, repping the citadel
No one's selling out, it's 2016, what's left to sell?
But they'll buy into lies despite all the times I could tell
Where I turned my back on the money and ran like Dave Chapelle
One man army, king of my own mind, a warrior Dothraki
I'm throwing my own party, hall pass it out at class
Greener pasture calling part of me
Quote JC, ""Bro, they're Commodores to a Ferrari""
Vroom vroom, click clacking, chh-chh, straight dapper
Run rings, been lapping there and back around the block
And I got my plan B in the end, if shit happens
That said, name a law firm hiring ex-rappers?

This ain't no revolution, I just move it two degrees
Then two degrees, then two degrees

'Cause at this point I'm sick of success, did it to death
I'll do it for life, fuck it, this the shit I do best
And I been sick since Vickick, little lunch and Pikachus
Man, since show and tell, I show and proved
Real life's the interlude, flashback to my folks' living room
Me at the dinner table whispering
Through long-forgotten lyrics and verses, my folks on the couch
While The Bill or Midsomer Murders play feet away on the tube
Headphones on, Discman on loop, LimeWire instrumentals
Finally gave your boy a platform to rip into
I've learned if it ain't genuine, that image shit'll limit you
This my story, against all odds, turned a dream into what I do

No revolution, I just moved it two degrees
Then two degrees, then two degrees

From BMXing over McKinnon tracks
Up and down Frankston line, bag packed with Dilly bags
Every school night, without fail, save those for the classes
Can't say the same for rap, I'm all Ws like Pac, bitch
Son of Bill and Rose, stoned on the last city-bound, homes
Me for years, BPS, one eye on the coppers in plain clothes
Can't count, close call, forks in the road, on fingers and toes
Fuck it, my luck rode and so, put it all out on the table
Like it's '05, just me myself and I, digi scales
A plateful of bad news and a peace sign for the faithful
'Cause the past don't define you, even if it creates you
Curly Wurlys and grape juice, I'd rhyme till my face blue
I'd die just to break through, met writers on the way
Me, Lup and Jimmy Nice, bumping Kanye down Chapel Street
Phrase shotgun, with a pound under the driver's seat

It weren't no revolution, I just moved it two degrees
Then two degrees, then two degrees

Through life, I've hunted gigs, man, I fought to progress
And turn this shit into a shot, no auto-correct
If I went back to beginnings, I'd tell me, ""Kid, you do you
Though you'll learn the hard way, trust me, kid, you'll improve""
And I wonder how much the younger me would trip if he knew
Some of my close-to-centre dudes we grew up listening to
How sick is that? Illy-Illy and Phizzle on the track
One last time for the dynamic duo, man
Fizzle spazzed, hit the gas, red flag turned chequered
Ain't an LP, bro, this our victory lap
Cut the check, you can bet that the smart money says
Phazes' got next, the way he got now, the way he had then
Road for ten years, wherever the shit take him
That's my brother for life, and I say the same about Flagrant

Look, it weren't no revolution, we just moved it two degrees
Then two degrees, then two degrees

From undercut to a mop, underdog to a God
Understated to major, unemployed to a boss
Title-winning form, give it all, catch a breath, then applaud
Ask me what I'm in it for? Forty-love, tennis score
Always been game over, summer so I guess I took their spot
Well, too bad, 'cause I ain't giving it back
Zoomed out from a pin on the map to bigger pictures
Had my share of indirect jabs and Twitter fingers
Still carry my city with me, every ounce that I give ya
This that west of the freeway, this that south of the river
And when I say goodbye and my number get retired
Hang my jersey off the Rialto and let it ride
Apologise for none of that, and real rep real
So when you see him, just tell him Al said to holler back, wassup",https://genius.com/Illy-two-degrees-lyrics
We Don't Care,The Chase,2010,"Yeah
Picture me lose a wink of sleep
Over some forum user saying what they think of me
Literally away at least twice a week playing
The crowd noise counter every fuckin' word they're saying
Long may it live, my long range is sick
Kick in the door with a footlong spliff
If it's true what they say, loose lips sink ships
Fuckers, whole fleets must sleep with the fishes
Talk too motherfuckin' much (just like bitches)
They can't accept this (ain't just about pictures)
Now I ain't got the time to give ya's so I'ma keep doing me
Bring the old ways with ya
I love fanning flames, fuck what the risk is
They're trying to maintain, trying to think big
I'm trying to do big, when my shit hits
Have you only fast forwarding when the disc skips, fuckers

For all the love, the hate comes with it
One prop gained's still one less given
Tired of the politics, tired of the dissing
Bring it in, now that you're listening
We don't care, get it right motherfucker
We don't care, step to the side motherfucker
We don't care, and you ain't keeping us up
And all my people they ain't giving a fuck, so go on, we don't care

And it's a crossed heart promise
My flow will keep getting colder 'til there's shards of it
If life's a bitch and all that, I'ma take my one chance to fuck the arse off her
Never call her back, hit my casket proper
Soon as I rock the stage, get your mind blown by it
Soon as I'm off the stage, get your iPhone primed
This my life, it's how I've come so high
Blow a goddamn blizzard up in hell before this sun don't shine
And fuck game, I'ma fuckin' owner of mine
Ain't no better broads at your shows than at mine
I still don't need this to get me over the line
I fuck models man, they don't even know that I rhyme
I cross borders, right now I'm like a couple horizons away
With girls who know all the words, but don't get what they say
And I could give a flying fuck about pay
Life's a beach mate, couldn't even tell you the day

For all the love, the hate comes with it
One prop gained's still one less given
Tired of the politics, tired of the dissing
Bring it in, now that you're listening
We don't care, get it right motherfucker
We don't care, step to the side motherfucker
We don't care, and you ain't keeping us up
And all my people they ain't giving a fuck, so go on, we don't care

I heard word about town that we out
Like the house Aussie hip-hop built couldn't stand a little drought
Like somehow, the shit had changed round
Couch critics call the shots now? Hold it, stop now
You're fucking kidding right? Y'all turn a blip into a crisis
We good, all I need's a stage and a liquor licence
I'm eating from a smaller pie, but it's bigger slices
Big shoes to fill, one day I'ma fit the sizes
I'ma six foot high motherfucker
Twenty five this summer, something like my prime
Something like my stride with my rhymes
Give a fuck what the next man talk about mine, get it right mate
They ain't a challenge, they cannon fodder
Taku beats don't rattle your teeth, they knock enamel off em
Rock my Obese two-finger ring
Like a badge of honour, Illy Al, burn city, what, we back up on it

For all the love, the hate comes with it
One prop gained's still one less given
Tired of the politics, tired of the dissing
Bring it in, now that you're listening
We don't care, get it right motherfucker
We don't care, step to the side motherfucker
We don't care, and you ain't keeping us up
And all my people they ain't giving a fuck, so go on, we don't care",https://genius.com/Illy-we-dont-care-lyrics
Where Is My Mind Pt. 2,Bring It Back,2012,"Yo, Part two
Where is my mind, man?
Yo

Starry eyed, checking contour lines
Addicted to this universal feeling called life
Astronomy class, round here we own the night
Good gracious, kiss gravity goodbye
And fuck a big jet plane, we get fly
So they all wanna know, what did you pay? What was your price?
It was like fifty in five; shit, I hope you don't mind
But you ain't gotta wake up tomorrow, do it again like
Reason, closing the window of time
But I'm still trying to find what scene to call mine
Still on the chase, pedal to the metal
Who's the sickest hey? Speak of the devil
This city crazy, need exile quicker than with tyres by Michelin
Heart beat quickening
Full tote technique, no half arse lyric
And paint the town red till the bar staff sick of him, what?

They all wanna know where is my mind
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
They all wanna know where is my mind
I'm probably listening to hip-hop like
They all wanna know where is my mind
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Still
They all wanna know where is my mind
I'm probably listening to hip-hop

It's all good, I'll walk you home,
I know we need somewhere, we all need somewhere to go
And if the city had a voice then the power of the spoken
Wouldn't be wasted on jerks with phones
Yes, Yes I'll be staying right here
Till my testimonial year, my people got the same idea
We got a good thing, You know it's true
She said I don't mess with boys like you
What am I supposed to do
You don't know me, you have got me wrong
Still the beat goes on and on
Gonna hear that all summer long
Make you wanna go back, wanna put it on wax
'Cause we get it done proper, we move it up
We take the party with us, even on the bus
Shit, can't forget that when we were kids once
And, on that note, one love Huntz

They all wanna know where is my mind
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
They all wanna know where is my mind
I'm probably listening to hip-hop like
They all wanna know where is my mind
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Still
They all wanna know where is my mind
I'm probably listening to hip-hop

And as the days go by, savour the taste
'Cause it call all wash away in the rain
So as far as a cigarette break it can wait
We party party from burn city bars to Bali
Bombs away! Piss parties Chris Farley couldn't contemplate
Brain need a new coat of paint
Mind games not limited to our CD's
Who am I? Where's Elvis? How TV? What up!
I feel I've been down this road before where
They all wanna know what you in it for
Drama? The money? the sum of it all?
I just wanna wake to a good morning with my faith restored
And spend the night prior rolling balls
On the prowl, still a mister no body
Yeah I know the score
But like pieces to the puzzle, we does it
Australian hip hop, I love it, I love it

They all wanna know where is my mind
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
They all wanna know where is my mind
I'm probably listening to hip-hop like
They all wanna know where is my mind
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Still
They all wanna know where is my mind
I'm probably listening to hip-hop

Yo, So there you have it
Where is my mind, I'm still looking for it. shit
Shout outs to everybody involved in the track, right
You write this shit not me
So thanks for that",https://genius.com/Illy-where-is-my-mind-pt-2-lyrics
Where Ya Been,Bring It Back,2012,"Man, PEZ, what up? (Yeah)
Like I've been gone for a little bit, I didn't think it was that long, but...
(Where you been, mate?)

Yeah, man, I guess I took the summer off (Why?)
Why? I was buzzing, didn't wanna stop
Flying seaplanes above the yacht
Threeways on the beach, smoke signs to the southern cross
These days, just another notch on the belt
Hell nah, leave the holidays for the others to
I toured so much the flight path's stuck on loop
A guy stopped me, asked what'd I been up to, dude
I've been everywhere man, where the fuck were you?
Sucks to come off rude, well nah, it doesn't
'Cause it's fucking true, my luggage frayed, but ain't underused
The shit's legendary, and new tracks ready
Full of beats, rhymes and melodies, my peeps like, ""They better be dope""
I asked 'em last time to remember me
Shit, I hope they got a damn fine memory
It's time to come back, gotta pick it up, slack
For a minute or three, and the fans gonna scream

Where ya been? I haven't seen ya face in a minute
Been looking, nowhere to be seen
Man, where ya been? Checking for your new songs daily
The wait gets worse by the week
I wonder where ya been, I wonder where ya been
Hear it all the time, man, like it was my theme
Man I'm back, you'd be crazy if you thought I'd leave
So relax, put your mind at ease, yo PEZ where you been?

Man, in Vietnam and Milan
Off to Amsterdam, then Japan, then to France
Every second day was on a plane on a holiday
Went around the world and saw a lot of shit along the way
Word? Nah, in truth I've just been in my house (Shit)
Spending most my time here, sitting round, chilling out
Stressing on the album, I just want to get it finished now
'Cause I been feeling like I'm missing out, shit
Been sick, but I don't need nobody's sympathy
'Cause my health helped me look at life a little differently
Instead of going out, partying like every day
I just gotta stay home and try to meditate
But it's all good, finally I'm on board
And now I'm in it for the long haul, yeah
I can't wait to stand with Illy up on stage
At a sold out show and hear the whole crowd go

Where ya been? Ain't seen your face in a minute
Been looking, nowhere to be seen
Man, where you been? Checking for your new songs daily
The wait gets worse by the week
I wonder where ya been, I wonder where ya been
Hear it every day, man, like it was my theme
Man I'm back, you'd be crazy if you thought I'd leave
So relax, put your mind at ease, Illy, where you been?

Man I've been on tour, wishing I was home (Sure)
Nah, if anything I'm living for the shows more
Looking back to '04, I was so poor
Fuck eating off rap, I couldn't buy my own fork
It's no sure thing, but we don't care
Always, hopeful it would lead somewhere, and now
Nearly every MC seems to be known
In three years, can't believe how the scene's grown
And rappers can afford to leave home
And teens got Aussie hip-hop on their ringtone
Even old folks are down with the lingo
It's a trip, I've been everywhere, everyone's loving this shit
Yeah, who'd of thunk it would be something this big?
Hopefully this is just the beginning (yeah, I hope so, P)
What can you say, man? It feels like a dream
If you don't know what we mean, then fuck

Where ya been? I haven't seen ya face in a minute
Been looking, nowhere to be seen
Man, where ya been? Checking for your new songs daily
The wait gets worse by the week
I wonder where ya been, I wonder where ya been
Hear it all the time, man, like it was my theme
Man I'm back, you'd be crazy if you thought I'd leave
So relax, put your mind at ease, where ya been?",https://genius.com/Illy-where-ya-been-lyrics
Without A Doubt,The Chase,2010,"Roll like Sonic the hedgehog
The competition X'ed off, my big mouth seem to find me more Barney Rubble than Bedrock said ""fuck a desk job""
Next stop: top of the world, we hectos
It's a combination of curse words and clarity
Mixture of vision and vulgarity, middle finger to gravity
Sticking em up, like Lara Bingle on the balcony
What's been ain't shit on what's about to be
So who's next on the guillotine? Illy, M-Phizzle
Drop the bomb, we rock shows not skinny jeans
Fuck what you're saying, what you really mean?
It's Obese, twenty-ten's killer team, marching onto victory
And they say you're only as strong as your crew's weakest link
I move mountains on a day off, part seas when I spit
We raise the bar without even having to blink
My crew be the shit and it's one hell of a stink

And you know, we turn the party out
Is hip-hop in the house? without a doubt
High low far wide east west north south
Is hip-hop in the house? without a doubt
We back, on that, we back, we on that
We back, on that, we back, we on that like

First the underground love, you have a hit and you get hated on
But keep up and at 'em, they'll come back to loving you later on
And I know fate favours the bravest
But anybody taking on M-fucking-Phazes, laters
No rest for the wicked so I don't sleep
I just don't listen to your Little Bo Peep net whinging
Get in where you fit in and ain't no room
Around here for that kind of punk bitchness
My mish is a surface to airwave, heatseeker endowed
Like a walrus no doubt, hitting deeper than the drowned
Rock an aura like Rick James bitch, stomp sneakers in your couch
Never been one with feet left on the ground
I'm all for leaps abounds, procedure
The barman's bringing the jugs, chicks bringing their jugs out
Getting down, you can tell by the people in the crowd
That brother we won't leave, we bounce

And you know, we turn the party out
Is hip-hop in the house? without a doubt
High low far wide east west north south
Is hip-hop in the house? without a doubt
We back, on that, we back, we on that
We back, on that, we back, we on that like",https://genius.com/Illy-without-a-doubt-lyrics
Wonderwall,Friday Flips: Season 1,2012,"Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
 (
Illy Illy, M-Phizzle on the track
)
Feels the way I do about you now
 (
Friday Flips Number Six
)
Oasis, ""Wonderwall""

I'ma talk my shit about the scene
Yeah

Back beat, the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now

Yeah, and we came such a long way
Built a flame from a flicker
Stood back, claim young'uns left the framework in cinders
I get it but to me there’s a difference between us
Doing it different and abusing tradition
As generations shift, rebuilt it and we thought
Gotta be about more than appealing to the core
Couple tall poppies broke glass ceilings for us all
Mine was high profile, some don't feel me anymore, well
I still love it, and you can find me at the gigs that they’re brushing
Their words say they down for the scene, their act doesn’t
The loudmouths always got by keeping stubborn
Can’t tell me nothing
I look at ‘em like, 'Where the fuck did the pride go?'
The result of their rise, but, we did in spite of
Years trying to open ears and minds
Till young emcees gave up and left the scene behind, its like...

Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

Back beat, the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now

We came such a long way
Winding roads, bright lights in the lost days
Train trips, bong haze, right in the wrong lane
And there’s so much I’d like to but don't know how, so I won't say, high octane
Beginning our tour
It’s cool getting paid, but its always been about more
Been about dreams, hope y'all living out yours
I reached mine by spitting out my inner thoughts
And I would never take back, or refute, or retract
Any statement or act, mate, told you the fact
I never turned my back or changed my tact
Chasing a fan base, you can go and hold me to that
Probably sound scorned when I talk about the scene
Only brought it up, 'cause it was once important to me
But it ain’t what it was, let it be what it be
And we'll keep moving on, where it ends we'll see, 'cause...

Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

You Say When,Two Degrees,2016,"So put it on, turn the whole party to a riot
Bad habits, don't mock it 'til you try it
Look up for ourselves from a mirror
You know me I'm down for whatever
And I'm so far gone, feels so right
Seems wrong? Sure, but you want what you want
Rooms full of empty bottles and rolled notes
Imma do this 'til I'm gone, I'm gone broke, now
Liquor in the system (woo) let's get it
Hotel room like a typhoon hit it
I'm living in this life whether highs or religious
And goodbyes are love letters, written in her lipstick
Sitting on the fence won't get you both sides
Heaven ain't far, it's a hell of a night
It's whatever you like, we can go or go in
Burn a candle both ends until you say when

So come in close
Tell me all your secrets no one knows
We don't chill until you tell me so
And we up right now, we don't have to come back down
Again, again
No we never at the end, just say when
Just say when
Just say when

Ain't no emoji for the feeling
Let 'em autocorrect that
I didn't mean to throw you in the deep end
But look at you already doing laps
Shit I don't ever fortune on fast car
But I got an escape plan and a map
The Clyde to your Bonnie, wake up smell the coffee
Not exactly Vodka and Cottees, but obviously
Fucking with the fly shit, you're meant to indulge
In my element, right, making memories roll
Y'all know, make the kind, either never get told
I tell 'em all the time and they never get old
You my sidekick, my highness, yeah what's good?
Fuck the fine print, write this in the books
And I'm down to tear the city up with you tonight
Just say when

So come in close
Tell me all your secrets no one knows
We don't chill until you tell me so
And we up right now, we don't have to come back down
Again, again
No we never at the end, just say when

Just say when, just say when, just say when
Just say when, say when, just say when
Just say when, just say when, just say when, just say when
Oh, Just say when, just say when, just say when, just say when
Just say when
All you gotta do, oh

So come in close
Tell me all your secrets no one knows

Woah oh, woah oh, woah oh, oh, oh
Woah oh, woah oh, woah oh, oh, oh

Now, I would never claim to have the answers
Shit, I failed as many tests as I advanced in
But I rised above
Hear the fuckin' war, Simba to the lion cubs
I'm that Iron Man swiging tiger blood
Beasts repeat 'till the last straws snap
Whatcha' think, a fuckin' fortune just falls in your lap?
Nah
Bring it like Freedom Fighters to the tanks
If they act up we gon' act right back like
Rebels with a cause, weather in a storm
Devil on the shoulder, heaven's at the door, so
Knock, knock, my generation's sure
You can judge it by the words or the level of applause
I ain't the only one, the real show's to come
We all waitin' for our shot, loaded guns
Spark a fire in our eyes then we run amuck
There's one love to my fuckin' youngbloods like

Youngbloods, run free forever
Forget the death that's ever nearer
Youngbloods, young hearts alike
Let the fires burn inside your eyes
We won't give up these memories
We won't go near those cemeteries
Youngbloods, young hearts alike
Let the fires burn inside your eyes

Yeah, we light it up like a firework in flight
In with the new before the bust
And that bullshit they pushin' you to buy ain't worth the price
So we say, ""Fuck you, we doin' this for us!""
Get it done while they ""um"" and ""ah""
(""Um"" and ""ah"")
'Till they come apart
This shit's strictly for the young and the young at heart
Who in the building, fuckin' guest list, the cover charge
We doin' it big while we here for the ones that aren't
A lot of people tell you what you're meant to do
But only one can decide on what's best for you: You
Me? I'm just tryin' to get the message through
It goes like, ""Save the drama, spend your youth."" Truth
To the sky and beyond, with the vow that I'm holding
Young mind with a song
Game-face on to the world cause it only comes once
Love to my fuckin' youngbloods like

Youngbloods, run free forever
Forget the death that's ever nearer

Now, there's nothing but love all my youngbloods like
Four, three, two, go!
