Woke up six o’clock, tickety-toc at my block
First time on the train, I was shocked
Same time back home, teaching little Arlys to get on
Spear in my hand, in my zone
Hunting bush life, I can feed 'em
This is

City lights, the sound, too much for my mind
But the quiet, the nature sound, now that is mine
Live it, breathe it, represent
Let it shine before the end of time

I'm on cloud 9

They see you really humble, don't ever change, you might crumble
(Yolngu Matha – English translation)
Don't ever turn back on God
(Yolngu Matha – English translation)
We gonna fly high like an eagle, don't wanna see no ego
Don't think about it, let go
Just hold on to my hand and let's go
Gotta do what Baker Boy, young man, not a boy
You can't control me like a toy
I'm a human being, just like you and me
We are family, stop the jealousy
Come with me now, break it down
North side of town, stop being the clown
Be the person that chases the crown
'Cause at the end of the day, you'll be found
So never back down (Back down, back down)

You wanna be as good as me? Boy, you better practice
Step back, feel the power of my blackness
You wanna be as good as me? Boy, you better practice
Step back, feel the power of my blackness

Can't stop me now (Can't stop me)
And you can't bring me down (Bring me down)
I'm on cloud 9
And I'm not coming down (I'm on cloud 9)
Can't stop me now
And you can't bring me down
I'm on cloud 9 (Bring me down)
And I'm not coming down

(Yolngu Matha – English translation)
Whenever the truth comes out, your heart is ripping out
You gotta stay strong, no doubt
The bigger the crowd, the bigger we are
'Cause the internet changes the line
'Cause they they don't want us too divine
From the human race, always on the case
Ending up getting chased, now we're standing in chains
Flash back, being black, reality hits back
Your system is whack
Trying to find a way to change the track because
(Yolngu Matha – English translation)

You wanna be as good as me? Boy, you better practice
Step back, feel the power of my blackness
You wanna be as good as me? Boy, you better practice
Step back, feel the power of my blackness

Can't stop me now (Can't stop me)
And you can't bring me down (Bring me down)
I'm on cloud 9 (I'm on cloud 9)
And I'm not coming down
Can't stop me now
And you can't bring me down
I'm on cloud 9
And I'm not coming down
Can't stop me now (Can't stop me)
And you can't bring me down (Bring me down)
I'm on cloud 9
And I'm not coming down (I'm on cloud 9)
Can't stop me now
And you can't bring me down

Can't stop me now (Can't stop me)
And you can't bring me down (You can't bring me down)
I'm on cloud 9 (I'm on cloud 9)

I don’t need no butler cleaning cutleries
Never find me sleeping under money trees
Never power tripping tryna find the seed

Spreading that mood, bruh, get me on the dance floor
We could have a dance off, do it all night
Feeling all juiced up, getting my groove on
Clean it up, super, we could take a flight, a'ight?

Black Magic,,2018,"Black magic, either you do or don't have it
Young, black and gifted, talking the whole package
Magic, magic, lights, camera, action
You are now witnessing the power








Then you will be known as unstoppable, beast
We used to be together, living happily, beautiful weather
Thought he would forever 


Reminiscing, chilling 




Black magic, either you do or don't have it
Young, black and gifted, talking the whole package
Magic, magic, lights, camera, action
You are now witnessing the power of black magic
Black magic
You are now witnessing the power of black magic
Black magic
You are now witnessing the power

When we gonna see another Mabo?
Someone who really cares about tomorrow
Not about where to get his next bottle
We need more Cathy Freemans, possibly more free men
These days blacks gettin' locked up for no reason
Archie Roach on while I'm preaching, armed for the beggar-man
They took our children away apparently for the betterment
Now they take our land, big money for the settlement
Kevin Rudd said sorry and they that it would settle it
But that ain't settle shit, middle finger to politicians
The day I listen will be the day that I see a difference
Our people are  prison
They think that it's livin' but it isn't, see a different vision
Young, black and talented, we all fit the description
What a time to be alive, boy, I'd die for my district
Vivid Picture, the lyrical Namatjira
And I'm pointing at my skin, Nicky Winmar, boy, you know I'm

Black magic, either you do or don't have it
Young, black and gifted, talking the whole package
Magic, magic, lights, camera, action
You are now witnessing the power of black magic
Black magic
You are now witnessing the power of black magic
Black magic
You are now witnessing the power
[Verse 3: Baker Boy & 
Dallas Woods

Black skin, white skin, centuries fighting
Straight to the point like I just stuck the knife in
Throw me to the bush, come out as a warrior
Put me in the city, come out as a Prime Minister
If you don't wanna close the gap then close ya yap
Heated combo, I'm cold like that

You are now witnessing the power of black magic
Black magic
You are now witnessing the power",https://genius.com/Baker-boy-black-magic-lyrics
In Control,,2019,"I got this (Yeh, whoop, whoop)

Kicking goals opening doors to a new era
Making sure it’s correct not an error

Even brighter days come sooner or later

Gotta do watcha gotta do
It’s up to you where you wanna head up to
It is hard you gonna have to break through
They turnin' up the pressure till it breaks you so break through

I will not let them hold me back no more
I shoot I score I give my all
My future I am in control

I am in control

No matter young and old having dreams and goals
Take control and the fundamental roll
Negative roles it ain't good for da soul
Having that motive is good for us all
Keeping the ball running for the future
Got me feeling like a preacher (Ha, ha)
There’s nothing that you can’t achieve when you're a seeker (Say what?)
Keep on moving straight ahead
And be a icon like a pillar for the next gen (Okay, okay)

When you see people tryna break ya dreams and you know we like
No they won’t hold us back
When they say they know but you know they don’t we like
