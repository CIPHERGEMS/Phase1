Rosie,,2020,"[Chorus]
Get out my face, get out my face
If you don't know me, I don't know?you?I don't waste?time
Get out my face, get out?my face
If you don't know me, I don't know you?I?don't?waste time

[Verse 1]
Heard the?same story but?the facts changed a bit
I don't have no time for no gas tiff
I'm at the gas station pourin’ out the unleaded
She gon’ come get it
Watch her come get it
Come get it

[Pre Chorus]
Ri-ri-ri-ri-ring around the rosie
She tell me she love me but I told her don't get cozy
A pony, ride me like a pony, I'm genuine
So do not waste my precious time
No do not waste my precious time
Ok, ok, ok, I'm with real bitches everyday
I said ok, ok, ok, I got real bitches everyday

[Chorus]
Get out my face, get out my face
If you don't know me, I don't know you I don't waste time
Get out my face, get out my face
If you don't know me, I don't know you I don't waste time


[Verse 2]
Kiss it like I want it but I really really don't
She tell me she want it but she really really don't
Bitches on my dick tell em what I'm what I'm gon' do
Tell em what I'm gon' do
You don't really have a chance
You should ask your man
Your bitch on my abdomen, pussy avalanche
I'm real in the city tell em what I really feel
And I put it on the line in the jungle like I'm Jill
And she see me in the limelight I'm ready to kill
Yeah I'm here to stay

[Bridge]
Let me see that ass shake like an earthquake, like an earthquake
Let me see that ass shake like an earthquake
(Shake it) like an earthquake, like an earthquake
Let me see that ass shake like an earthquake

[Pre Chorus]
Ri-ri-ri-ri-ring around the rosie
She tell me she love me but I told her don't get cozy
A pony, ride me like a pony, I'm genuine
So do not waste my precious time
No do not waste my precious time
Ok, ok, ok, I'm with real bitches everyday
I said ok, ok, ok, I got real bitches everyday


[Verse 3]
I just want my money like Escada, like it's gone
She just wanna play me like a, play me like trombone
She don't wanna see me singin’ singin’ on the song
When I get that fame I'll be cashin’ cashin’ cashin’ out

[Chorus]
Get out my face, get out my face
If you don't know me, I don't know you I don't waste time
Get out my face, get out my face
If you don't know me, I don't know you I don't waste time",https://genius.com/Sophiya-au-rosie-lyrics
Chief O’ Kief,,2020,"[Chorus]
Who be runnin’ up the streets like me?
Like Chief, like Chief O' Kief
No beef, more?streaks
Who?be runnin’ up?the streets like me?
Like Chief, like?Chief O' Kief, like

[Verse 1]
Like, can I roll a leaf?
I just?need?another?raw in my?teeth (in my?teeth)
Got the bag, now they all want a piece (uh)
And if they can't inhale, then release
And they call the police, cause their talk is so cheap (uh)
Fuck you mean, I'm the hottest in the scene
Tell me how u feel if you don't then you weak
Real bitches only, you just know the old me
I am now the grown me, you are not a homie (yeah)
Gotta lotta females mad (uh huh)
So I turned the pen and the pad (uh huh)
When I spoke what I wrote it made em gag (uh huh)
You do you booboo and just relax
Shoutout Aries, shoutout Leo, shout out Sag

[Chorus]
Who be runnin’ up the streets like me?
Like Chief, like Chief O' Kief
No beef, more streaks
Who be runnin’ up the streets like me?
Like Chief, like Chief O' Kief, like


[Verse 2]
Like, get out of my seat I gotta a million places that I got a be (gotta be)
I'm a boss Rick Ross and Kelis (yeah)
Bada bing bada boom I'm a freak
You're a Jeep, you're a sheep
I'm asleep when u speak (yeah)
All this chitter chatter, it don’t really matter
I'mma swing batter batter swing, then smoke a bat after
I'm all that and some, pretty and I'm handsome
Took your bitch for a frisk, now this song her anthem
Pretty thickie and she bitchy turned her to a dancer
Talk Mercedes but she push a Mitsubishi Lancer
Makin’ money where there wasn't money turned a rapper
Used to sing on the ting, now I'm in the mantra (bitch)

[Chorus]
Who be runnin’ up the streets like me?
Like Chief, like Chief O' Kief
No beef, more streaks
Who be runnin’ up the streets like me?
Like Chief, like Chief O' Kief, like

[Verse 3]
Like, this is do or die to me
So don't say hi to me unless we cool lil mama
I'm as big fish, got a wish list full of designer
I'm a major bitch, you a minor hater lil mama
My baby mama call me baby daddy cos she wanna
Buyin' her everything turned me to the Don Dada
Used to rep Nike now I'm representing Prada
I want more dollars, more dollars, more dollars
I'm upping my charges
I'm adding more commas, more commas, more commas
More Balenciaga boxes (hey)
Watch me go dumb go dumb on ‘em
Pra-pa-pa-pum I'm a drum on ‘em
Of course I'm gonna fire, they got a gun on ‘em
I'm the beat and the bars so im stuntin' on ‘em",https://genius.com/Sophiya-au-chief-o-kief-lyrics
White Ivory,,2018,"[Chorus]
Too many bitches don't like me
Too many bitches tick me off like Nike
I could bag your girl in my white tee
Make her my side piece
I’m too smooth, white ivory

[Verse 1]
You can tell your bitch to stop eyeing me, period
I take my music real serious
Got your girl feelin' it
She whispered in my ear, I'm curious
Told her I could be the one, her man got furious
I just wanna pull up in Givenchy
I just want my girl laced up in Giuseppe
People make claims but they ain’t met me
This one's a killer, I guess that's a felony

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't have no time for no enemies
Cut 'em off, fuck 'em off, zero bad energy
Artist of the century
Fuck with me heavily
Headed for the clean sweap
Pure greed, pedigree


[Chorus]
Too many bitches don't like me
Too many bitches tick me off like Nike
I could bag your girl in my white tee
Make her my side piece
I'm too smooth, white ivory

[Verse 2]
Sit yo ass down
You a class clown
I’m the teacher, smoke that reefer like Khalifa (uh)
You don’t like me?
Well that's on you
And I always keep receipts to put the facts on you
I just wanna pull up in a Bentley (truck)
Girl ballin’ out in the Louis and the Fendi
People just really don't get me
I'm my own producer so I write my own melodies

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't have no time for no enemies
Cut ’em off, fuck 'em off, zero bad energy
Artist of the century
Fuck with me heavily
Headed for the clean sweap
Pure greed, pedigree


[Chorus]
Too many bitches don't like me
Too many bitches tick me off like Nike
I could bag your girl in my white tee
Make her my side piece
I'm too smooth, white ivory

[Post Chorus]
Too many bitches don't like me
Too many bitches tick me off like Nike
I could bag your girl in my white tee
Make her my side piece
I'm too smooth, white ivory",https://genius.com/Sophiya-au-white-ivory-lyrics
