Home boys,,2019,"Verse 1
You took off your panties
Fucked off and let go
My home boys are nearby
We are walking around Moscow
Killing this beat
Your baby mother is crying at the window again
Happy New Year
Your little whore a
Happy New Year
Your little whore is
In my room there is the
Smell of kyrosin
In my the room is
The smell of kirosin
Your bitch spoils me with a blowjob
I move a bitch with the president wok
Yes we smoke gas
In a glass of triple cap
Elku we throw
Boys do not forget
Triplesix mp3 he’s with me
You sit
Fuck so you don’t get up
Better don’t get up
Triplesix mp3 he’s with me
You sit
Fuck so you won't get up
Better not get up
Chorus
I maneuvered on a bitch
She arranged a squirt
I tacked on a baby
She arranged a hey
Verse 2
My homie Tim fucks Double time
And I fucking tru, only tru I
flew to the fluff
Drowned in Hype I
flew to the beef
Arranged spling hit
Chorus
I dodged a bitch
She made a squirt
I dodged a baby
She made a hey",https://genius.com/A-love-home-boys-lyrics
Out Of Place,,2002,"Draino:

Cornered by my own free will
I reveal what I wish to reveal
Hence full control of me will prevail
And build a sturdy structure that has
Ten percent fluctuation , so when conversatin
With me it's pure truth in the making
Cross my heart and hope your words weigh the same as mine
So I suggest you refine your intentions
Missed scheduled conventions are not good
3 times max is where slack gets decapitated
Sorry but I've navigated too much
For too many people like you
Cancellation after cancellation
My social relations are shaking and
My patience is decaying
Whilst your ignorance is plaguing
Your future as an associate
So please take note kids
Enjoyment should.. stem.. from... within
And not just from the assistance of expensive fluids
Funky plants and prescription drugs created by Druids
I wanna move serious units to sooth kids insecurities
And alter the obscurities viewed when straight
..can you relate.. music to enjoy and absorb
Not to pick on or ignore
So I implore you to investigate the passages of play
Relax on your bed, with your head on your lovers chest
And invest in the natural high, why?
Cause it might help you to perceive the lives we live
So ask yourself is it a gift or a curse
To disperse love and create
Whilst fighting that urge to escape for just another day..


A-Love:

Wake up, another day, another dollar
Another attempt, to try and be a scholar
Holler at the things I don't dare understand
Was this strange personality all part of the plan
I'm out of place, (out of place)
Yet uncomfortably fitted
Try to blend in, don't talk like a dickhead
Different, such a catch word these days
Can't help feeling like no-ones on my page
Was amazed that I could relate to your crazy observations
But I've hated , smoky clubs and drunken breath, time heals
But I can't let it repeat, at best
Fifty per cent is understood
The rest of the time I master the art
Of doing what I should (it's all good)
Should it bother me that no-one sees me clearly?
Nah, cause I love dearly
Silver platters and spoons were never served with my food
Using different cutlery to you
Formulated leftist tendencies, always written poetry
Watched the sky from different heights
It'll be alright when we take flight
Put our hangups aside, realise the beauty
Of being alive , with good health and mind
We strive to find the other percentile
And enjoy the drive (just for another day)",https://genius.com/Draino-out-of-place-lyrics
Steady Dippin’,,1993,"[Intro: Do Or Die Aka A-Love]
Smooth, baby
Steady dippin'
And for all the B-K's in '93
But you don't hear me though
Straight everyday banging
Slanging, you know what I mean?
Huh, that evil-ass C-Side
Steady dippin'

[Verse 1: Do Or Die Aka A-Love]
Back into my neighborhood, stop at daytime
Get a bag of chips and a dollar wine
Roll down Greenleaf, make a left on Caress
Fire up the indo, can't fuck with the stress
Hangin' out with my niggas (Fire up the bud, Cuz)
Sittin' in my '4
With fingers on the trigger
Always ready for some set trippin'
That's why I'm dippin' and dappin', crippin' and dippin' never catch me slippin'
Checkin' out the bitches (What's up bitch?)
Raise up the phone
And fuck with the switches
Front back
And pause on threes
Rag Top Four
Sittin' on them D's
Checkin' ass for the big booty one (Damn, she got ass)
Mackin to the skunk and let her ride shotgun
Roll by the park
And check the niggaros
Straight-up Crips and G rolls (What's up Cuz?!)
Checkin' out the niggas from hangin' like nuts
Even when One-Time pulls up
One-Time'll get checked like a bitch
White boys in his niggas' click (Bitch!)
Move on before you can't pass
And before April 3rd come back to haunt your ass
You ain't gon' change a goddamn thang
The plan is simple cause thangs don't change
When you're gone (Shit ain't changed Cuz!)
We still be crippin'
And makin' cash money
Steady dippin'


[Hook: DJ Quik]
The underground is moving thangs!

[Verse 2: Miss C-Note]
Watching Boyz N Tha Hood with do or die
Them Crips is rollin' deep and I’m slob niggas drivin' red Hyndias
That’s why I couldn't be a Snoop, I gots to have my 9
My BKs an' my muthafuckin’ Coupe
In my Caddy hittin' corners, hittin' the switches, droppin' quick 'Ru niggas by my Tip
Like a bitch
6-0 Rollin deep murderin' them 20’s Crenshaw Mafia
I kill them good and plenty
C-Note is the muthafuckin' G-Bitch
I got my grip tuck down in my cleavage
And if a nigga wanna jack I got my steel dip gat
Strap down, where the muthafuckin' pussy at
Hit a ‘Ru nigga cause I gots somethin to prove?
Take him to a motel and pull a muthafuckin’ jack move
Me become a slob oooh, never!
C'Note: a muthafuckin' Crip forever..

[Hook: DJ Quik]

[Verse 3: Sin Loc]
Much Crip love
On a blue day like this
Packin' a .44
Roll in a Crip 6'
They call me Sin Loc
Yes, the G that ain't no joke
The mystery of mess
With a killa Snoop rat flow
See a Slob's brain dread while I'm dippin'
And I'mma hit the fool up
With two C's cause I'm steady crippin'
Sin Loc a mastermind of respect
So you don't get it twisted
Cause if you do Stretch you get stretched
Sayin' to keeps no bustas outta gangbang fool
Much Crip love and we can't stand die-'Rus
Now if it's twisted then I twisted for your kid sake
See cause I'm roll about mine that means I don't fake
So put your dead rag back into your pocket fool
Only thang you swingin' on us nuts when I drop you
Ain't noboby living like no dead rag busta
And when I'm steady dippin'
Respect is from the shoulders
Cause Sin Loc'll peel any Snoop At his own will
But It's time for black folks to try to take a chill pill
And quit going against the grain on each other
Cause worst than dread, I can't stand to see a dead brother
So I ain't trippin' on them bustas if I catch 'em slippin'
I just don't give mines up and just keep steady dippin'


[Verse 4: Blue Ragg]
I'm dippin' on the East Side of the Compton Hub
For the neighborhood Crip gang Cuz I got much love
I'm givin' it up
To the rest of the Crip gangs
Steady crippin' and puttin' in work on them Slobs main
Kelly Park, Atlantic drive and South Side
Spook towns always down to hoo-ride
Farm dog, nutty blocc and tragniew
It's killin' up them Snoops like Vietnam goose
Lantana blocc, the swamps and original front
Be hoo-ridin' on Slobs all through the month
Ducky hood, Palmer blocc and original pocket
Be pluggin' on off brands like a plug socket
Park Village, Santana and Mona Park
The ?come-up? is up to way
Puttin' a slug in a Snoop's heart
And by the way: Crippin' don't stop!
Cause them Front Street crips in Watts gots much props
Jordan downs, fushed town and P.J's
Two 1-11 N-HOOD is steady crippin' on them Avenues
Main Street, East Coasts and Rollin' 60 N-Hood
Is always crippin' and nuthin' on damn good
Two C's up to L-B-C
School yard shotgun and A-G-C
Shot outs to them 9-7 kitchens
And Original Crip sets
That I couldn't mention
Much Crip love, Blue Rag's outta here and I'm steady dippin'..",https://genius.com/Bloods-and-crips-steady-dippin-lyrics
