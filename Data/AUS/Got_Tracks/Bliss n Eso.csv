Lighthouse,BnE7,2020,"I've been tryin'
Tryna find my way back home
Cannot make it on my own
In the storm
It was raging and roaring
I saw it

Man, I really hope we can all float
In this storm that we're trapped in
'Cause the ocean is so cold
And the water's like black ink
We're all lost at sea
Lookin' for a brighter day
It's like life's full of tidal waves
But believe me, those ups and downs will help you find your way, ayy
And there's a sea full of demons
Tryna get a good grip on my tail ()
But I'm blessed by the breath
Of an angel that keeps putting wind in my sails (Amen)
And if they get your soul
Man, that's somеthing that you'll never get back
'Causе in a world that profits off your self-doubt (Come on)
To love yourself is a rebellious act, yo (Oh)
And there's a house full of lights (Lights)
Always watchin' where I go (Go)
And I'm drawn to it's shine ()
Like a moth to a lightbulb (Bulb)
But just know (Yo)
You can reach heights that no man's climbed (Yeah)
You can breath life into all mankind
'cause you been a light the whole damn time

I've been tryin'
Tryna find my way back home
Cannot make it on my own
In the storm
It was raging and roaring
I saw it

Like a lighthouse
Shining down across the night
Like a million stars inside my mind
It's the fire that ignites
All these diamonds in the dark
Somebody show me the light
Somebody show me the light
Somebody show me the light

4 AM
I'm out on the streets and I'm ridin'
I'm all types of fucked up
It's freezin' cold and dead quiet
Tears runnin' down my face
As I peddle this 10-speed
Man, my girl just left me
Got home and the whole damn wardrobe was empty
She was my bestie
I was at the studio, the irony of a cruel world
'Cause as she was packin', I was rappin'
""Lean on you, all about you, girl""
And I know things haven't been great
But I can't help but think I would've saved this
If I just sped home, I would've played it
But I just missed you, I was too late, shit
I let you slip through my fingers and I know
It's all my fault, I had your love and lost it
Five years of love and laughter
Now down the drain, gone and shipped off in boxes
And now I'm flickin' through the radio
And everyone is playin' Dean Lewis like a twisted joke
And what's more, today is my birthday
I couldn't make story up any worse, ayy
Now I'm callin' up the Devil just to party like a demon
Goin' off the rails 'cause I'm heart broken
Then I plunge into a sea of sadness with a cannonball
Around my neck and now I'm drowning in this ocean
Got Eso calling me like, ""What the hell? You MIA for weeks
And missed a whole 'nother studio session""
Oh, Lord, somebody pull me out the sea
But ain't nobody gonna save me but me

I've been tryin'
Tryna find my way back home
Cannot make it on my own
In the storm
It was raging and roaring
I saw it

Like a lighthouse
Shining down across the night
Like a million stars inside my mind
It's the fire that ignites
All these diamonds in the dark
Somebody show me the light
Somebody show me the light
Somebody show me the light

Ain't nobody gonna save me but me
Ain't nobody gonna pull me out the sea but me
Ain't nobody gonna save you but you
Ain't nobody gonna come and rescue you but you
Ain't nobody gonna save me but me
Ain't nobody gonna pull me out the sea but me
Ain't nobody gonna save you but you
Ain't nobody gonna come and rescue you but you",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-lighthouse-lyrics
Act Your Age,Circus in the Sky,2013,"When I wake up

When I wake in the morning I smile to myself like I'm thanking God
Shit, no more folks like, ""Jonathan, when you gonna grow up and get a job?"" (Uh-uh)
‘Cause I made that job, no Steve, that job's kept me hungry and foolish (Yup)
It's the coolest, I'm ‘a dive in like Kendrick and drink some rum in the pool bitch
Or beers on the roof, it's the workaholic in the magic sun
Till the esky is empty, shit, what's life if you ain't having fun?
So forget your age and those walls, I'm bursting through that maze
On top of the tour bus in a teen wolf mask surfing USA
And we got that baggage packed, happy gas, massive laughs, yes, I can dig it
So I joke like Tom when Josh, Baskin in these toys like a big kid
It's my habitat, I can't leave the trees like an Orangutan, I'm a
Running on air anchorman and I never land like bangarang.

Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?
Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?
You know what I'm saying, yo, enough of that shit, check that

Yo, I'm acting the fool, no shame, I came, I shat in the pool
Yeah, better pass that blunt, I'm ‘bout, ‘bout it, you can ask my Mum
She'll tell ya, I'm psycho mate, my ideas make your lightbulbs break
I make it look so damn easy when I rock that Borat mankini
Fuck what they say, you don't miss your chance to eat chocolate cake with your hands
You rock a bubble beard while you're taking a bath and where a simple fart still makes you laugh, like
Hahahaha, blurp blurp, hahaha
And then a big brown shark came, now I'm
On the stage acting up, yelling bombs away while I grab my nuts
Still living it like it's all a movie, still killing shit on Call of Duty
And I still think I can move like the Matrix, real shit, shrooming in Vegas
Or when I play with my dogs, even right now while I'm making this song
So how's about it, let's laugh till there's power outage
That's all I have to say, fuck them all, and don't act your age, I'm makin’ pancakes

Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?
Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?
They're always saying to me, they're always saying:
""Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?""
They're always saying to me, they're always saying:
""Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?""
They're always saying to me, they're always saying:
""Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?""
They're always saying to me, they're always saying:
""Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?""",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-act-your-age-lyrics
Animal Kingdom,Circus in the Sky,2013,"To the kingdom of all creatures
You have risen spirit souls
Don't turn back now, hear the sages
It is time to reach the goal

Back in this bitch, I'mma kick the door down
Down right dirty like shit in your mouth
Nah, just pullin your leg
And all that shit talk, mate, I'mma put it to rest
Yes, you know what this is
Hip-hop, and 
neurolinguistics
I'm real, I don't rap for the dough
Tell it to a friend, bitch, act like you know
I'm a dedicated motherfucker, living my dream
And I'm 'em keep them coming like I'm flicking their bean
Set the kitchen ablaze
Then take to the stage like Ricky Gervais
Tell it like it is in a world gone mad
I paint the town red like a girl on rags
Got three blunts, like tree trunks
You know who it is, ""These Cunts""
Big Macka, doing the do
And with an open mind and beautiful view
I said, mate, check it out, 
it's rough as rugby
Stand back, I'mma fuck this puppy
If you want it, I got it and since you need it, let's get it
I got a chainsaw wrapped around a baseball bat
I said ""Bitch""

Through the who ha, boo-ya, you know what it is
My crew flies, blue skies, on them southern winds
Like ooh ah, woo ha, my eye glides
Out the jungle of my mind, like
Bitch don't kill my high, bye

Matte black bat, out the cave like Gotham
Change my lane when I aim my conscience
Grew from rap, I was raised on Compton
Put 'em in a cage, make a name like Bronson
It's all gold when summer hits autumn
This is my trip and there's nothing this awesome
In a Carl Sagan built ship, with Bill Hicks holding a suitcase from Hunter S. Thompson
Caution, Jonathan's mind's like a spaceship
Trying to hide from the prying eye of the Matrix
I've lost my marbles, hell it's fun though
I left my knowledge in El Segundo
Boo-yah, I don't have time for the who-hah
I'm Martin, massaging my ears like woosah
Woo-hah, I got you all in check
When I busta rhyme and bomb the set with a
Jaw Cracker, gobsmacker
With this hunger I built a life I sought after
The best thing I've ever had, like Eddie Murphy starving, chewing on a raw cracker, shit it's all laughter
(that was rich, that was, they wanted rich)
And right now I'm more ready than I've ever been
It's a zoo and we're heavy as some elephants
Shit the Wolfpack is back on the map
With a crew of cats, riding a semi full of pelicans

Through the who ha, boo-ya, you know what it is
My crew flies, blue skies, on them southern winds
Like ooh ah, woo ha, my eye glides
Out the jungle of my mind, like
Bitch don't kill my high, bye

Thank you for that lovely tune
That funky music will drive us 'til the dawn
Let's go
Let's boogaloo 'til we puke
I've lost my marbles",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-animal-kingdom-lyrics
Bomb Like Banksy,Circus in the Sky,2013,"Yeah! I want it, and they need it
I stay on it, it's no secret
So I talk to you through telekinesis
Then bomb like Banksy, you better believe it
I want it, and they need it
I stay on it, it's no secret
So I talk to you through telekinesis
Then bomb like Banksy, you better believe it

Yo, see I did it for you, I did it for myself
I did it for the crew and when we did it, it was felt
Being phoney is the only fucking image that'll sell
In a room full of mirrors, taking pictures of yourself
So I hit 'em with the belt like Pootie Tang
Tell 'em pull your finger out and introduce my gang
MCs, art freaks, DJs, dreamers
Storytellers, trippers that preach that freedom
Smokers, painters, lovers of the music
Your fam, your clan, the hustle for improvement
The lights, the mics, the roof's on fire
Set that stage ablaze and Krush Grooves all night
I'm that little bugger with a boom box banging
If ya can't hang, better move on Madam
Cuz every moment is honestly magic
Like South Park writers at the Oscars on acid

I want it, and they need it
I stay on it, it's no secret
So I talk to you through telekinesis
Then bomb like Banksy, you better believe it
I want it, and they need it
I stay on it, it's no secret
So I talk to you through telekinesis
Then bomb like Banksy, you better believe it

As a kid, shit, I'd like to challenge what my limit is
And with that pencil, used to draw a lot of images
Now I draw on the mental with the pencil
But it's the words it writes that serve to paint what the picture is
The lyricist and art is like autumn, is fall
So these songs are like the drawings that we bomb on the wall
Catch the array spray in Jonathan's view mode
Breaking out this island like it's Robinson Crusoe
Blue ocean hungry, rock spots, and bungee
Then we're back again, it's like hopscotch with countries
My crew's on the move in one jet, we're flying
With my sights set on that sunset horizon
Sipping sake with Mr Miyagi
Dropping crane kicking, knock you out, wisdom of Gandhi
Facing my fears head on, so I'm into the fray
When it's black and I'm white it's like the end of The Grey, let it play

I want it, and they need it
I stay on it, it's no secret
So I talk to you through telekinesis
Then bomb like Banksy, you better believe it
I want it, and they need it
I stay on it, it's no secret
So I talk to you through telekinesis
Then bomb like Banksy, you better believe it
I want it, and they need it
I stay on it, it's no secret
So I talk to you through telekinesis
Then bomb like Banksy, you better believe it
I want it, and they need it
I stay on it, it's no secret
So I talk to you through telekinesis
Then bomb like Banksy, you better believe it

Can’t Get Rid of This Feeling,Circus in the Sky,2013,"I'm not leaving
I'm not leaving
I'm not leaving

Check it out, yeah
Its that moment, when your lost in the feeling
You own it, your on top of the building
Your front row with your favourite shows
You love it loud and you wanna let your neighbours know
That right now, we run the town
Its our chance to dance like no ones around
Love like this can't bite with a buck better
Dig hard for your diamond in the rough
Like me, my girl and a timeless classic
At peace with the world when the vibe is magic
Close your eyes, vision the scene
And for a single moment you'll be living the dream
And even though, it might take a while
When your song comes on bet it makes you smile
Laughing like martin, run and tell that shit
Fact is right now nothing else matters, madness

I can't get rid of this feeling
I can't get rid of this feeling
So you know I ain't leaving
Cause I'll be standing right here
I can't get rid of this feeling
In a world full of angels and demons
Oh you know I ain't leaving

Its times like this that sets me off
It when i get the feeling that lets be lost
The tunes got me so in the mood, its like
My feet just seem to know what to do
And I do set off that energy shift when I
Set the drift on memory bliss
And that ship takes me like I'm just a passenger
Sending me back like a flux capacitor
Into a state where you'll dance if its raining
The jump with the perfect land on the pavement
For me, its a grand in the basement
Where the hairs on my neck stand in ovation
Feeling like a kid back when I can win at this
Back when I had the world at my fingertips
But I still got the world at my fingertips
Every single time I feel like this it is limitless

I can't get rid of this feeling
I can't get rid of this feeling
So you know I ain't leaving
Cause I'll be standing right here
I can't get rid of this feeling
In a world full of angels and demons
Oh you know I ain't leaving
I'll be standing right here

This ain't no accident man, we, we stayin here
This ain't no accident man, we, we stayin here
This ain't no accident man, we, we stayin here

Oh shit, I'm just feeling the vibe ya'll
To stay here is a hell of a right call
Its the moment when the stars align
Its the times with your girl when your hearts combine
The harmony sings, and what it brings is amazing
Propelling me back to relive the occasions
Its the win at the last strike of the clock
When you clock the feeling you got right when it stopped
Yeah, we live life like minutes or hours
And it feels like there's something religious about it, but
This ain't church and I ain't preaching
This won't hurt and I ain't leaving, like
Kids at a party, crew round the barbie
The old couple that dance at the Ari
Touch the lasers marry the beat and carry belief
Till you're happy to be free

I can't get rid of this feeling
I can't get rid of this feeling
So you know I ain't leaving
Cause I'll be standing right here
I can't get rid of this feeling
In a world full of angels and demons
Oh you know I ain't leaving
I'll be standing right here
We don't, we don't, we don't stop, we don't stop
We don't, we don't, we don't stop, we don't stop
We don't, we don't, we don't stop, we don't stop
We don't, we don't, we don't stop, we don't stop
We don't, we don't, we don't stop, we don't stop
We don't, we don't, we don't stop, we don't stop
We don't, we don't, we don't stop, we don't stop
We don't, we don't, we don't stop, we don't stop

Home Is Where The Heart Is,Circus in the Sky,2013,"I feel the morning sun, walking to the bus stop
I got my backpack, books and my lunch box
Let's travel back, so you can capture that
Old school image like an Ansel Adams hasselblad
I was on the 208 passing Castlecrag
Headphones pumping, listening to classic rap
Rocked up at school, yeah I was the misfit
Cause I had an accent, bullied by some bitch kids
But this one dude Max, he was a friend of me
We bonded over Cube, Eddie Murphy and Public Enemy
Reciting lines, we'd rap and laugh in a free state
Rolling with our handicapped mate so we could be late to class
Shout out to Bates, we couldn't hear one teach
In the back sharing an ear bud each
Just waiting for lunch when it was B-Ball galore
And back then I swear, we were gonna be pro for sure
After school I went to JP's fortress
He made beats, and that's where me and Macka recorded
See Nug had given him our first beat machine to rock right
Cause we couldn't figure it out, like 'What the fuck is quantize?'
Then Tarik came over for the first time
Blowing us away with cuts to compliment the verse rhyme
Like the missing piece seeing him perform
And that's the night, baby, BnE was born, what a day

Home is where the heart is so hip-hop is right here
Home is where the heart is so hip-hop is right here
Home is where the heart is so hip-hop is right here
Home is where the heart is so hip-hop is right here

Rolling down the road that I know is my home
It's alright, it's okay, yeah
Rolling down the road that I know is my home
It's alright, it's okay, yeah

I awake feeling great while my queen's asleep
My best-friend and lover is what she means to me
She pulls pranks while I least expect it
Trying to make me laugh while I'm eating breakfast
Wife-beater on, throwing out the garbage
Realising that home is where the heart is
Take the dog for a run in the park
A sneaky billy then we jump in the car
Check the fuel, I hope we got some
Let my baby drive, rappers ride shotgun
Then we play fight, when we choose songs
Then we compromise and throw a groove on
Where we go next builds another chapter
As long as we're together then it really doesn't matter
Cause we're two lovers on an open road
Where we're going, brother, no one knows
We connect, and make the world stop
I'm only half here, if my girl's not
Cruising, hearing barks from the back
Freestyling while she laughs at my raps
We're a team, it's a dream and I'm lovin' it
They're only jealous cause they can't fuck with it
It's the simple things that make the world spin
From my dogs, to my job, to my girlfriend

Home is where the heart is so hip-hop is right here
Home is where the heart is so hip-hop is right here
Home is where the heart is so hip-hop is right here
Home is where the heart is so hip-hop is right here

Rolling down the road that I know is my home
It's alright, it's okay, yeah

House of Dreams,Circus in the Sky,2013,"Yeah, yo
Every letter is love and every word's an oasis
Trying to reach new heights like a bird in a spaceship
And you're damn right, we've been working the late shift
Trying to see how far on planet Earth we can take it
This is poetry in motion, the mystery of why
Every motor is in motion and it's visually divine
On a roll like Timmy, and they're stuck in bad traffic
So when I rock it, the bottom looks like Buckingham palace
I feel fucking fantastic, a viking with the rhyme
That lightning in the sky mixed with Tyson in his prime
I tell it how it is and they got nothing to say
I tell the haters I love 'em, just to fuck with their brain
Duck, I'm insane, my flow's like a swordfish
This is one hundred percent straight up uncut raw shit
I can't be bamboozled, that's faker than a dollar sign
Beat me in their dreams and they wake up and apologise
Non-believers, trying to piss in my boots
Don't they know they'll have to fly just to fit in my shoes
Got the world in my palm, and my feet on the dash
So let them bitch and wish I wasn't the reason they rapped
Shit, I'm trying to write a song with insight
So look past the mask, there's diamonds on the inside
We're unplugged, and blessing you with magic
Our drift is in the air, but the question's can you catch it?

And it is love that can set you free
Watching the sun setting on the sea
And you can lift me above the highest mountain peak
And now I see (say what?) live from my balcony
Welcome to my house of dreams

Kind of comic how a kid from DC would Marvel at his superheroes
Draining his Walkman battery juice to zero
A teen with a dream, and since the whole start I've
Been like Quentin, plotting from the video archives
So I direct my film like Jack Sparrow's compass
Cut sick, shooting like a black barrelled gunship
Just like when the rain and thunder hits the planet
Dreamt once in the clouds, now the mothership has landed
God damn, it's spectacular, lock it up and load
With that flip of the tongue and hit of the drum, rock and fucking roll
I spark an idea, ignited from my balls
Add it to the ninety-nine bottles of lightning on my wall
In a boat of hope, on an ocean where the sharks live
Spitting fireflies to paint my poems in the darkness
Connectivity is in my stare
Shit, electricity is in the air
So throw your islands in the sky if you feel the vibe
Hip-Hop is still alive every time we fly
And when I find a line, like a rope I can use it
To lift me out the sea of disposable music
Which can't touch my soul 'cause that dog shit smells
I wanna be taken away like a cosmic spell
So no need to show me the money of bomb hit sales
'Cause this song gives me the quan just like Rod Tidwell, and so

Just let me enjoy this for a minute

And it is love that can set you free
Watching the sun setting on the sea
And you can lift me above the highest mountain peak
And now I see, live from my balcony
Welcome to my house of dreams
And it is love that can set you free
Watching the sun setting on the sea
And you can lift me above the highest mountain peak
And now I see, live from my balcony
Welcome to my house of dreams

I Am Somebody,Circus in the Sky,2013,"Come along children
Now we're going to have a little music
Like old times

Straight out the gate
This is our story we're scripting
Our film, our glorious vision
Our sound, our score that is written
In this sport, this division
My my, how the tournament's risen
Shit, everybody wants to soar in an instant
Everybody wants to be the Lord of the Ring wins
We laid dormant and listened
Hit ignition, tore up the system
Elevate, accelerate and demonstrate
Live the dream and keep the horns to the mission
The formula's mixing to fire the
Engine up and bring the force to the pistons
Never say never whenever together we give and go
With the flow flipping like Jordan and Pippen
Slam the points home
Incite a roar to ignite the board
Wipe the floor with the notes that we write
And hold down with a mic to strike a chord
And then they can hear that thunder with the hooves
When we come with the hunger of the wolves
They were warned and the red flag flew
And his crewed cracked through, it's the running of the bulls
Today, we are together
Whenever we come together
The writers write
The cameras roll
Because together we got power
That's just rappin'

I said
Ay yo, I'mma
Lay my tracks down, I'm that
Freight train tearing through the
Sky in the clouds, I said
Ay yo, watch this
Hail mary fly, keep on
Runnin' keep on gunnin' with this
Fire in my eyes, and I'm
Sky high
I'm sky high, yeah (yeah, together)
Welcome to the time of my life (raise your fists high)
I'm sky high
I'm sky high, yeah (together)
Welcome to the time of my life

Sun, rain, snow or hail
We never got lost in the storm
And you best to respect that you
Never really know what you've got till it's gone
And a monster was born
With a want to explore
Life's roughest weather
But we know the code so we stuck together, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)
And as life unravels
My mind's what fights my battles
I rhyme like lightning travels
Think quick, how you like them apples
Cuz I'm ready as I'll ever be, my head is in the
Melody, I'm flying now each
Feather is so heavenly, the energy of seven
Seas couldn't tie me down, bitch
So no fucking around dumb
Cunt, one jump and I'm up in the clouds
Trying to make that moment last
On a beat like Heath in a Joker mask
Which means, don't change that dial
Could've, would've, should've, just ain't our style
Shit, we got things to build
If your luck's low just know your wings are real

I said
Ay yo, I'mma
Lay my tracks down, I'm that
Freight train tearing through the
Sky in the clouds, I said
Ay yo, watch this
Hail mary fly, keep on
Runnin' keep on gunnin' with this
Fire in my eyes, and I'm
Sky high
I'm sky high, yeah (yeah, together)
Welcome to the time of my life (raise your fists high)
I'm sky high
I'm sky high, yeah (together)
Welcome to the time of my life

Yo, yo
I'm so ill in my timeless timepiece
I keep a dime piece in arm's reach
Keep it 1000
From the housing projects I found my niche, you better
Find yours, I used to run with a few
Crime lords, Ramadan taught me use the
Mind more, though I'm not religious
Nas y'all, just the realist
My imminent, conspicuous
Synonym, sincere, rhyme and flow
Developed some images up in your
Mind bro, I survived continuing
Criminal enterprises that
Surrounded me, innocent, no
Exaggeration, I don't pimp my
Past, I don't brag, no faking
My apartment had some break-ins
I'm thinking my past is worse than today is
That's when Biz Mark came with the vapours
It was anarchy, live in a heartbeat
Of the city that never sleeps
Niggas will gas you up to handle their beef
Peep game, you're dead if you don't think
Fast enough, we keeping it way
Street

I said
Ay yo, I'mma
Lay my tracks down, I'm that
Freight train tearing through the
Sky in the clouds, I said
Ay yo, watch this
Hail mary fly, keep on
Runnin' keep on gunnin' with this

Our experiences determine the texture, the pace, and the sound of our soul. All of us are one people singing our music, pumping our thing up, and doing our thing. Let's give ourselves a great round of applause",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-i-am-somebody-lyrics
I Feel Free,Circus in the Sky,2013,"Just the other day you walked into my life
And now every time I see you look away, I feel a change
My body starts to shift in shape
The strings to my heart start to break
And everybody looks the same
And I feel free, ooh I feel free
I feel free, cause you're not looking at me
Holding onto memories like rollercoaster handlebars
Holding onto memories like rollercoaster handlebars

Yeah, the lone busker
With no coin in the hat to pay the rent
Music's the only thing that's makin' sense
And he sits there all day, hopin' you hear it
With his eyes closed, he opens his spirit
He's focused and fearless once spoken his lyrics
Like pain in the rain, you wouldn't notice a tear drip
A simple story of a girl and guy
So watch what happens when their worlds collide

It was yesterday, I went walking alone
Out of the corner of my eye there you were
Starin' deep into my soul, I felt different just three days ago
Because now it's me who's in control
Ooh, and I feel free
Oooh, I feel free
I feel free, because you're looking at me

The true artist is
Forever together, nothing can kill this dream
Cause with or without her he'd still be free
Strummin' his heart's strings, striking chords
Every moments a choice like sliding doors
He would roam from home but love was here though
And love’s that stuff that adjusts the bureau
It wouldn't be worth it without his mates
He wouldn't have learnt shit without mistakes

And I feel free
Holding onto memories like rollercoaster handlebars
Oh, I feel free
Holding onto memories like rollercoaster handlebars
I feel free
Holding onto memories like rollercoaster handlebars
Cause you're not looking at me
See we all be kind of fly
Just can’t be scared to spread your wings
Holding onto memories like rollercoaster handlebars
Holding onto memories like rollercoaster handlebars
See we all be kind of fly
See we all be kind of fly
See we all be kind of fly
Just can’t be scared to spread your wings
See we all be kind of fly
See we all be kind of fly
See we all be kind of fly
Just can’t be scared to spread your wings

Jungle,Circus in the Sky,2013,"If my head is a jungle, I sew the seeds
Of positive thought to grow the trees
Into fruitful groceries
For my heart and my mind and my soul to feed
Kill the doubt, smoke the weeds
Then it's full steam ahead on the open seas
A place where I think and see lateral
The free radical, dreams magical
Sitting on my canopy with a sunset stained mind that burns bright burgundy
The universe is in all of us, the spark in the dark that can surge my circuitry
Brainstorm and out breaks a whirlwind
I'm surging, the soundscape is Merlin
Feel life in the blood
Sit back and buzz, live, laugh and love

My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head

My head's a jungle with a view of earth
And I didn't really know what to do at first
Every thought is a seed, so I used the dirt
And let it grow, till it opened a universe
Now I bring to life, whatever I imagine
Eyes open, you're heading for a labyrinth
Fields of flowers, trees to the heavens
And to win the war, we won't need any weapons
Free in thought, cosmic bliss
The speed of life through the forest mist
Airborne, no stopping the dream
When my tummy's getting tickled by the top of the trees
It's a breath of life, and a burning rose
It's where I start my journey and return to home
The imagination is a head trip
So enjoy the ride, it's the best bit

My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle

Life’s Midnight,Circus in the Sky,2013,"Just listen to the sound of the charge
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen

Imagine a 5 year old, without a doubt in his mind
Where Star Wars was still real; and no mountain's to high
That mountain was blue, my first birthdays residence
And since then, I've made earthquake evidence
See, positive thinking's an actual fact
Way before gangster rap had you packing a gat
I'd watch Breakdance and idol Ozone
Way before you had that bling bling
Way before I puffed the home grown
Rented it so many times, back in Kurrajong heights
I wore out the VHS, imagine long nights
Day after day, I'd let it play, reciting the lines
Try and fathom what I imagined, inside of my mind
Grabbed a dollar off my dad, Shabadoo I had it for ya
To save the centre, If I ever made it to California
And then the moment came, my mother said we're going
Jumped on a jumbo and we sailed across the ocean, like

Oh lord, I want to live to life's midnight
And keep running through dark to that dim light
And to the world, I say when I'm humming the blues
If you're coming at me, then I'm coming at you
Oh lord, I want to live to life's midnight
And keep running through dark to that dim light
And to the world, I say when I'm humming the blues
If you're coming at me, then I'm coming at you

My arrival was an eyeful, of everything I thought
My Disneyland Dream was everywhere I walked
With that dollar in my pocket, I was on a mission
Deep inside, I knew I'd meet him, I had gone the distance
And on that last day, down Melrose Avenue
2 worlds collided when my eyes saw Shabadoo
There was a crash, so you can capture it accurate
But the accident was no accident, it was actually happening
My mum hit the brakes, I jumped out the car
Ran to an angel, blood pumped through my heart
He showed me his Jag, he took me to his restaurant
Photos signed, B-Boy stance, this is the best of
My memories that I cherish forever
The last time I really remember my parents together
Lifting the movement, they never pictured I'd do it
But I'm a living example and I got the pictures to prove it so

Oh lord, I want to live to life's midnight
And keep running through dark to that dim light
And to the world, I say when I'm humming the blues
If you're coming at me, then I'm coming at you
Oh lord, I want to live to life's midnight
And keep running through dark to that dim light
And to the world, I say when I'm humming the blues
If you're coming at me, then I'm coming at you

From the back of the yellow bus when PGC brought me new music
Singing and mimicking what I heard, beat boxing in a blue Buick
From Virginia, continue to when Max and I met
With our heads between 2 boom boxes, making tracks on cassettes
Yeah we were sifting through them singles, searching for some instrumentals
Thirsting how to make 'em, when we learnt that we would be instrumental
Late 90's, back in NZ for a visit
Shit, my cuz gave me Che Fu to be specific
Brainfighta in my head, man it gave me light
Like Rachid giving Izm that X-Men tape that changed his life
And I remember Macka's mother's Joan, calling me on the phone
Telling me to turn on basic equipment and we learnt we weren't alone
And saw that SP and that MP up in Benz or a Beamer
Back when if you were white, you were speaking through the pen of a dreamer
Outkasts, from the farthest depths finding fate
Lay your own track, art express 98', check it

Oh lord, I want to live to life's midnight
And keep running through dark to that dim light
And to the world, I say when I'm humming the blues
If you're coming at me, then I'm coming at you
Oh lord, I want to live to life's midnight
And keep running through dark to that dim light
And to the world, I say when I'm humming the blues
If you're coming at me, then I'm coming at you",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-lifes-midnight-lyrics
My Life,Circus in the Sky,2013,"Pop this tape in the deck, place the key in the ignition
We won't wait at no red light, only green's in my vision
Yeah a journey to the mind again, all aboard the brain
These feathers make me levitate in waterfalls of paint
Keep your fortune and your fame, mate, I'm chilling on a tree branch
Laughing at the squares, drawing perfect circles freehand
We kill the doubt, the path divine is limitless
My rhyme is the reason that they can't define the pyramids
Travel at the speed of light with Ceekay Jones
With full faith of where this freeway goes
A spectrum of colours, it's like our time has come
To ride high till we fly to that rising sun

Baby it's a new day, driving on the throughway
All I see is bright green lights
Forget what you would call me, know that shit ain't for me
I'ma just live my life
My life, it's my life, it's my life
I do what I want, I do what I want to do
My life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life, my life
I do what I want, I do what I want to do

When I wake each day, it's like a new timeless moment
The chance to steer your drive as soon as your eyelids open
I bush bashed a path that tipped the scales
And made it to the sea in time to catch my ship that sailed
Played the game my way, with my mind in the zone like Michael
Recite my diary like I'm flying on a motorcycle
The Easy Rider on that road that stretches nations
Life's speeding up and all I feel's acceleration
With that wind in my face and I got that past to my back
And I got that prize in my eyes and I got my passion intact
So I ride through the night and dream bright into the cosmos
Now all I see is green lights at every crossroads

Baby it's a new day, driving on the throughway
All I see is bright green lights
Forget what you would call me, know that shit ain't for me
I'ma just live my life
My life, it's my life, it's my life

My life, my life, my life, my life
I do what I want, I do what I want to do
Baby it's a new day

It's my life
Baby it's a new day
Baby it's a new day, driving on the throughway
All I see is bright green lights
Forget what you would call me, know that shit ain't for me

Next Frontier,Circus in the Sky,2013,"Yep yeah
Yep yep, yep yeah
Yep, yep, yep

So I heard
If you really, really want something, live like a goal kicker
See the target, envision the whole picture
Clock strikes every second of your life
Till the bottom of the ninth and you're pitchin' a no hitter
Like on that note, I'ma carry this flame
Of these ideas with the marriage of change
So connect like the eyes that sight the shooting star
It's the pride to fight for who we are
A home is what mother earth has given you
And mother nature makes you individual
To shift your eyes off the tube to the view
Of these motherfuckin' elephants sittin' in the living room
The reason my thoughts are free is
'Cause I’m dreaming before I fall asleep
And if you're present in the present, it's a present
The essence of the message is a legend
Symbiosis the wonder life brings
Create your fate, it's just somethin' I sing
'Cause everything we do, everything we say
Everything we touch resonates like butterfly wings

We won't run, we can fight
All that keeps us up at night
There is far to go now
Let's not waste a minute more
In denial

""All the people who can cuss like-"" ""All right""
""All the people who can cuss like ""

If it's real, it can blow your mind
Like when DJ Izm first showed me Tribe
Call it a quest but it's more like a trip
Every thought is a gift that can cause an eclipse so
Don't listen when they tell you lies
I'm proof you can rise above
Fear's not here, I kicked out doubt
So I have no excuse to hide or run
So I let it flow in the booth when I'm rhymin' (rhymin')
Just to show you the beauty behind things (behind things)
Think positive, seize the chance
Like the ball's in the hoop before it leaves my hand
Damn, that was a Jordan quote
Still, I thought you ought to know
I'm just tryna pass on wisdom
And hope there's a message in the last song written (written)
If not, keep the toys
Doin' nothin' is an easy choice
Whatever genre, we need a voice
To fight for our rights like a Beastie Boy

We won't run, we can fight
All that keeps us up at night
There is far to go now
Let's not waste a minute more
In denial

We won't run, we can walk
To a place we escape free of thought
We can fight, we have a choice
We can build, we have a voice
We won't feel or be controlled
It says right here that can feed the soul
Light year's a speed
 we can bring to flight
The ideas that a seed can just spring to life

We won’t run, we can fight
All that keeps us up at night
There is far to go now
Let's not waste a minute more
'Cause we won’t run, we can fight
All that keeps us up at night
There is far to go now
Let's not waste a minute more of our lives
Our lives... our lives",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-next-frontier-lyrics
Pale Blue Dot,Circus in the Sky,2013,"When I lift off, I blast right through the clouds and up through the atmosphere
And I hit space, and I look back, and I peer at the massive sphere
Our home, a beautiful island in the vacuum, as I blaze the way through the solar system
One voyager alone, 6 billion K's away
And from here Earth looks like a pale blue dot in the vast enveloping cosmic dark
And suddenly the problems of our world fall apart with the conscious spark
That our similarities far outweigh our differences, we see how connected life is
Like the moment of clarity is what this image is, nothing puts things in perspective like this
I embark, new freedoms, the stars and truth lead us
The positive vibes that charge my nucleus
Every step, every breath, every life, every death
Every age, every act, empire and collapse
What we know, our beliefs, ideas, every dream
It's everything we think in our minds
The entire history of mankind in time
Summed up by that dot in the blink of an eye
I fly

Turn up the music, right about now
Cause if it wasn't for the music I don't know what I'd do
Turn up the music, right about now
Cause if it wasn't for the music I don't know what I'd do
Turn up the music, right about now
This is music I've been waiting all my life to hear, and I didn't know it
Turn, turn, turn up the music
""What do you see when you close your eyes?""
""All of the positive messages""
This is music I've been waiting all my life to hear, and I didn't know it

Welcome, to the next dimension
I myself wonder, how does music place itself in your brain?
Why does it make you dance?
Why does it make you think?
Our message is much deeper than most
It seems that, this is our only escape
And music, is universal love

The arrival, was survival, positivity was power
We cracked the concrete, to deliver you those flowers
Now that day has wings, and you can run on air
With a hope, if we spoke, there was someone there
Now I owe it to you to give back what you gave us
Cause the fact is, you practically saved us
From being trapped in a cage, to prove my mum right, Max will be famous (Mother!)
But the cash couldn't change us, we're just thankful our passion can make bucks
Yeah, and with my fam' right behind me, I can hang glide through lightning
Motherfucker I told you I tango, with a gang, of the chain like Django
In-flight, at a height you could touch an eclipse
Cloud nine's got nothing on this
And what a view of the atlas, out here playing pool with the planets
That's right, it's all love 'round here
Cause we don't give a fuck 'bout fear, tell 'em

Turn up the music, right about now
Cause if it wasn't for the music I don't know what I'd do
Turn up the music, right about now
Cause if it wasn't for the music I don't know what I'd do
Turn up the music, right about now
This is music I've been waiting all my life to hear, and I didn't know it

I feel unified, mate. Shit, I'm feeling the same
This is paradise, so enjoy the weather
A perfect time to get the boys together
We need old school, new school pioneers
Who can flip that shit like Primal Fear
Sun's up, man, I'm callin' the lads
One love, that's twelve balls in the bag

Yo, my crew's on some bullshit
And I ain't talkin' 'bout a poo that a bull did
I'm talkin' 'bout what sets the bar
BnE, Seth, '60, PEZ and Drapht

He said ""sets the bar"", that'll blow like Escobar
Six dogs out the reservoir
Let's play connect the stars
And paint a circus in the sky, yeah, PEZ can start

Yeah
Now we thought this crew should pull
Out something a little unusual
Sounds a bit like a musical
It doesn't matter, we make any kind of music cool

Yeah, uh, when I heard the word footpath
I just thought it meant it was a foot large (I did)
But then I walked on a footpath
And I had a look, and I swear it was a good yard

Yeah, rule of thumb
Never been the one to open up a can of worms
Never underestimate
'Cause some say we the best to date like Miranda Kerr
Hi Seth

News flash alert
Something stirred underground where the rappers lurk
In a cloud of weed smoke, with a hand full of Cheetos
I'm in Beast Mode, you better enter a cheat code

Now check it out, look who's up in the mix
You can dream, but you ain't seen nothing like this
This place is off chops, like I'm waitin' for a mate
So just ""give me the mic"" so I can take it away

I'm like Outkast mixed with South Park
And my rhyming flow is like Dynamo
So when I bust on the beat
I'm rude like Cube yellin' ""fuck the police!""
Raise 'em up
It's like all your Christmases came at once
Yes, we're too much for these rookies
Seth, let's knock the dust off their pussies

Man, I feel awesome, nah, I mean awful
Yeah I'm pretty sure I've put on weight since Autumn
Pass me the pork roll, don't really walk anymore
Ever since I invented a gun that shoots portals
Yeah, my body's gone bad
Tried to get myself a Hollywood tan
Me and Drapht went to Bali for a holiday, man
I must've put the weed in someone else's bodyboard bag
Fuck

Leadin' from the get go
Yes, I believed it, even when they said no
Yeah, fear's like half of your thoughts
Follow your heart, that's par for the course
Of course it ain't easy
I can tell you that first hand, but it's all good
Look at us, went from studying the fundamentals
Back when we were young and now we're up here on another level

Now check it out, look who's up in the mix
You can dream, but you ain't seen nothing like this
This place is off chops, like I'm waitin' for a mate
So just ""give me the mic"" so I can take it away

(Yeah, check it out, yo)
This sounding like some Austin Powers shit
Someone gotta tell '60
This ain't the sixties, this ain't the same mixed
Bag of lollies, that ain't the same Frisbee
Interesting, yes, I guess
I can adjust, I guess it just means
That we gotta do it different. Good
And I'm glad 'cause the records are wrecking my Discman

When I heard the beat on, I said turn it off
I thought it was the theme song from Circus Oz (turn it off)
I'm being serious, I don't give a fuck how
Turn down the sample and switch up the drums now
I got the sick drum loop
Walking 'round the city in my pink gumboots
If a hater wanna talk like ""Six, fuck you""
I tell my bodyguard ""Smash this cunt too""

Last shot of the six slug revolver
Tree swingin' in on a big fucking Cobra
Shit cunts, it's over, with my honourable brethren
It's destined, Mr Orange done stepped in
The card shark, the way I play in the carpark
Doing doughies, spin a rapper out like Nardwuar
And Izm, here's a line to scratch
Hate, ""Ain't nobody got time for that""

Good god look who's up in the mix
You can dream but you ain't seen nothing like this
So there goes the neighbourhood get elevated with us
It's like ""UNITY"" it's a celebration, bitches, good god

I'm so provocative, I hit your town like I'm Razorback

I'm feeling marvellous, so monstrous, I target it, I conquer it
Now, I looked up at a golden sky, electric filled and it opened wide
Rays of sun started beaming down and the clock stood still in frozen time
And steadily, heavenly energy entered me and I began to soar in flight
So when it's night, I project these poems, you can see my work in the northern lights

Unite,Circus in the Sky,2013,"I’m sorry, but I don't want to be an Emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible: Jew, Gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that
We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. we don't want to hate and despise one another
In this world there’s room for everyone and the good earth is rich, and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way
Greed has poisoned men's souls has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much, and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities life will be violent, and all will be lost
The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together
The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all. Even now, my voice is reaching millions throughout the world: millions of despairing men, women, and little children; victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say “Do not despair.""
The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish
Soldiers, don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you, who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think, and what to feel, who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts. You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men
You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don't hate only the unloved hate, the unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers, don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty
In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written “The kingdom of God is within man.” Not one man, nor a group of men, but in all men
You, you the people have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness. You the people have the power to make life free and beautiful to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then, in the name of democracy, let us use that power
Let us all unite!",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-unite-lyrics

We blazin' with a nasty bass
That makes the bar shake and the glasses break
We blazin', blazin'
Blazin' on

Yeah, while the beats are banging and the barbecue's burning
And the heavier we get bro the higher the learning
Bitches that are fake, I'ma show you where it's at
Like a system with a steak and I'm Homer with a bat
There ain't nothing that compares to jumping on stage
With the self satisfaction I got something to say
Yeah we're coming your way with the southerners bounce
No fucking around I came in puffing an ounce
And I was told as a kid that I'm not a success
But as cold as it is I'm as hot as it gets
I move mountains with nothing in my hands
That modern day muddy motherfucker with a plan
So knock down walls, break the border
But believing in no walls will shake 'em all up
Bliss n Eso baby and we're blazin' hot
There ain't nothin you can say or do to make us stop
(We get down)

We blazin' so light 'em up
Put your hands in the air if you like the stuff
We blazin', time to amp the troops
And feel the vibration from the stampin' boots
We blazin' with a nasty bass
That makes the bar shake and the glasses break
We blazin', blazin'
Blazin' on",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-blazin-lyrics
Coppin’ It Sweet,Day of the Dog,2006,"He was just copping it sweet
Copping it sweet?

Yo, Bliss n Eso is a chance to see
Something different from another cheap dance routine
I'm a, fist for freedom, I'm as deep as it gets
I don't own a home in Rome or have keys to a jet
But on this mic i write like life's just another lovely day
I won't stress at no desk for another croppy pay
We drop for the intelligent, do this for the kids
I don't have to fit their image bro my crew is on some shit

On some shit, hold up! Who just stepped in some place?
Like flipping them flows and ripping themselves without a second to waste?
Yo my name is Bliss and I admit that I'm bumpin' the bomb shit
I'm just a yank who's splittin' join the country of convicts
Full of Africans, Indians, Asians, South a north Americans, Arabs, Europians, man, no matter what your heritage
This country is like hip hop, it don't matter where you came from
We all a part of it, And get down under the same drums

Well I don't know where I'm going but I know where I've been and I can tell you that this is true
(This is true)
Without a dollar to my name or a care in the world, there ain't nothing that I can't do
(Nothing that I can't do)

Like who are you and (
How you living

Why you rapping (
What's your motive

What you making (
What's your planet

Where you at (
And where you from
)
Fuck that, Get up, Drop the flow, What's not to blow
Jump up, Jump back, It's a jump off, Geronimo
Rock a show, At the pack festival to make an exit
Now check this for a second bro and look at what you left with
You gotta pickit fence, A pool and a mortgage
Divorced wife 3 kids 2 porshes
Worked hard for the joys of the wealth
But on the way, did you enjoy yourself?
Spent 50 years at your 9-5, Rich but sad by the time you die
Chasing their dreams just blinds the mind, Now snap has gone keep it right on the time
Just knock off early (
Crack a beer and
)
Dust them shoulders (
Wipe them tears and
)
Walk and talk and (
Hit the club and
)
Loosen your tie and (
Feel the buzzing
)
Feel the loving (
Paint a picture
)
We all in the same LIFE BOAT
Live to the max an smash the gas
Til the tank's all empty and die

Well I don't know where I'm going but I know where I've been and I can tell you that this is true

Without a dollar to my name or a care in the world
There ain't nothing that I can't do

So stop, Drop lets go, Get up
Sup now, We're brothers, And with a fist brother throw it up

Evening Breeze,Day of the Dog,2006,"Let those windows sink, feel the evening breeze
Let's just zone out, now come on, now people breathe
It's the moment where the show has got you soakin' up the vibe
Dim the lights and bring the mics, we're gonna show you somethin' live

(Gon' do it like this)
See, they won't catch me, I'm way too fast
In a world gone mad, I'ma break these bars
Won't chase these cars, don't make me laugh
I'm a drop some insight to blaze this grass
And I'm off again
That nutty motherfucker straight droppin' gems
Mister anti-government stops the trend
I don't believe no lies like cops are friends
And this hip-hop is right where I left it
Think about the people that my rhymes have affected
My mind is a weapon my life is a wreck and
Whenever I spit, it's divine intervention
Satan now is the face of a job
So I break him down, and trade places with God
I made that sound and gave face to the loss
To create my crown out of paper and rocks
So if you're livin' in the cold, there's some scissors in the bowl
To make a motherfuckin' mix until this bitch is on a roll
The news is proof life is tragic when killing
So I choose to use my magic verses your millions (ha ha)

Let those windows sink, feel the evening breeze
Let's just zone out, now come on, now people breathe
It's the moment where the show has got you soakin' up the vibe
Dim the lights and bring the mics, we're gonna show you somethin' live

Where's the party at, let's hit the fort
Get her poppin' like a bottle that spits a cork
This track is a drug that Bliss endorse
(Will ya listen to it?) Nah, it's for your whip to snort
So pop it in your old bomb and your ritzy Porsche
And when you listen, sport you feel a buzz, well your Vista's forced
To turn it up 'til the shit distorts
And damn near OD, make your system short
Oh lord, low and behold
The big truck and basilla got the show on the road
And these fuckin' haters act all cocky
Try to cut us down like we're tall poppies
Man, we grassroots that retort the shoot
I mouth off in the face of the corporate suit
So force the troops that won't fall short in the stoop
Their severed arms sold for a sore salute
So freeze, please cat, now breathe, relax
And let the poem set the tone, 'cause under every ego
Is flesh and bone
Now sway, right left and zone
Got the crowd lookin' like a giant metronome
Let's go to my world, give my record a spin
Let the melody massage and beckon you in

Let those windows sink, feel the evening breeze
Let's just zone out, now come on, now people breathe
It's the moment where the show has got you soakin' up the vibe
Dim the lights and bring the mics, we're gonna show you somethin' live

 is humbled with love
My style's down to earth when I hover above
I'm so fresh, so clean that, if I'm covered in mud
I make the mess just seem like it's bubble and suds
I got a knack for this rappin' shit
If you don't know, ask Amiss who's that dope flow activist
A grown bloke, but a wacky kid
Well it's your very own Loco Captain Bliss

And I'ma hang glide over your franchise
'Til the music seems like a lucid dream
Then I wake in the morning and I shave my head
Then have non-believers come and make my bed
And while they're making bread, I gotta shake my head
'Cause I'm the bloke that flows broke to make the rent
So relax and let your brain breathe
In a hammock amid the daydreams

Let those windows sink, feel the evening breeze
Let's just zone out, now come on, now people breathe
It's the moment where the show has got you soakin' up the vibe
Dim the lights and bring the mics, we're gonna show you somethin' live",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-evening-breeze-lyrics
Get Loose,Day of the Dog,2006,"Bliss n Eso, Hyjak, bring it precise
We singin' it nice, fresher than a minger on ice
If you all up in this bitch then start breakin' somethin'
Ain't this bumpin'? Every fuckin' patron jumpin'
And this came from nothin', fuck radio airwaves
Shit to save I've got my hair shaved
""Bro, that's fair play""
To all my troops, get your boots stampin'
You get me booze slammin', I'm a loose cannon
I found my companion, IZM was so blind
Passed out on the shitter 5 minutes to showtime
You hoes fine? Well even if you're not fly
Cock-eyed, with a head that looks like a dropped pie
Turn it clockwise on your volume meter
All you lads scream out like you callin' beaver
""Come here"", wakin' up all you sleepers
Shit's so fuckin' loud like we're bombin' speakers

Grab your partner do-si-do
To the rhythm of the rhymer with the dopest flow
""Heehaw"", my crew's sussin' the sitch
""Oh yeah"", let's get loose up in this bitch
Grab your partner do-si-do
To the rhythm of the rhymer with the dopest flow
""Heehaw"", my crew's sussin' the sitch
""Oh yeah"", let's get loose up in this bitch

Are they ready for this? I don't think they are
We ain't weight lifters, but still game to raise the bar
Face it, you basic, we state of the art
Dedicate, you're dangerous like demons playin' the harp
You play your part, I make my mark and go the distance
Got studio equipment for Christmas, now you think you can spit this?
We made our own path rollin'
With rims spinnin' we just stolen off Mark's Holden
What you tellin' me? They jealous we controllin' our destiny
I'm the piece of the puzzle that's been dipped in LSD
Fella you see in the RTA lightin' weed
Why the fuck you need photo ID to get photo ID?
Bad guy you need to point your finger at
Slap you in the face with a dick attached to a fuckin' cricket bat
Bring it back, rockin' Sydney nightly
You the finest, we the illest, west side of the sea

Grab your partner do-si-do
To the rhythm of the rhymer with the dopest flow
""Heehaw"", my crew's sussin' the sitch
""Oh yeah"", let's get loose up in this bitch
Grab your partner do-si-do
To the rhythm of the rhymer with the dopest flow
""Heehaw"", my crew's sussin' the sitch

To all my troops gettin' loose, get your boots stampin'
Where you at? Oh yeah
To all my troops gettin' loose, get your boots stampin'
Where you at? Oh yeah

Oh shit, another track I can bless
With psychedelic side effects, got Hyjak in a dress
And I'm chillin' like a villain bro, rollin' skunk
While Bliss is buck naked bloody bowlin' drunk
Man you know what's up, that authentic shit
Less bling bling bro and more penmanship
Man I'll send this shit to the moon and back
Then burn somethin' backstage where my crew is at
See there's a couple of things that I've wanted all year
To live off this mic and be sponsored by beer
Since that won't happen I'm 'a show you a trick
How to piss and walk while you're smokin' a spliff
And it's makin' 'em sick, lower class blowin' smoke in the face of the rich
What I spit hits kids like takin' a trip
And I'm 'a tear these walls down, so buff, touch pricks can stare these balls down

Get Your Boof On,Day of the Dog,2006,"Ah, put that away darling, goodness gracious
You're going to embarrass me in front of this lot
Your chardonnay's fine, darling; is my bow tie on properly?
Good, good, good; ahem, mic check
Now, ladies and gentlemen, hurry now to your seats
The show's about to begin and, my word, you're in for a treat
Buckle up your belts now, hold on to your knickers at all costs
As we welcome you to part two of ""Pigs in the Porn Trough""

It's like my life's a song and everyone knows
That if my lights are on that everyone's home
And that's a serious shindig, a guaranteed fix
'Cause even 20/20 motherfuckers haven't seen shit
I want the fans at my show to put the mosh in pit
Barbecuin' with my crew, chillin' off my tits
With a maid that'll slave, cook, and wash my dick
In a house that I own that didn't cost me shit

So just bounce, we up in the club bumper to bumper
I just wanna jump in the bunker and hump her like Thumper
And Mrs Purty's ass wouldn't stop buzzin' and shakin'
I wanna take her to the shed (For hot lovin' relations)
Still love the touch of pudge spillin' out the top of your britches
I wanna put you on a plate and sop you up with a biscuit
The twisted man on the job when you ain't lovin' her right
The perverted, poetical plumber that's pluggin' her pipe

Hey, yo, ladies? (Yeah?)
Does rubbin' the nub make you crazy? (Yeah)
You got tits and butts with no maybes? (Oh yeah)
Well, answer me this, do you love a good boofin', well? (Hell yeah)
Hey, yo, gentlemen? (Yeah?)
You ready to up, jump and represent? (Yeah)
If she's game and you game, you adventurous? (Yeah)
You got that look in your eyes
Now, everybody, break the ice and get your boof on tonight

I got my willy in your mouth, ho; Sydney's in the house, bro
Writin' free, lightin' weed, chillin' on the couch, blown
And there's no holdin' it in
Roll out your red rug, love, give me that Dolmio grin

Ew, I'm that stench trench digger like Dirk, workin' your lawn
Servin' the words of this song, got birds slurpin' my schlong
Watch it grow huge now, my tower that's made of wood
That just rolls though town to deflower the native bush

See, they might have money for a Lex or Rolls
But I got these mingers pingin', wishin' they had extra holes
So let me plait your puss, while I hang you from your undies
No note in the morning, just a kanga in your dunny

See, I just tickle your nipples and give you giggles to your stomach
Flip you and hit you and watch shock waves
Ripple up your buttocks
Make you scream like Gale Weathers, dick dippin' in your clit
As I ream your tail feather, leave knickers in a twist

Hey, yo, ladies? (Yeah?)
Does rubbin' the nub make you crazy? (Yeah)
You got tits and butts with no maybes? (Oh yeah)
Well, answer me this, do you love a good boofin', well? (Hell yeah)
Hey, yo, gentlemen? (Yeah?)
You ready to up, jump and represent? (Yeah)
If she's game and you game, you adventurous? (Yeah)
You got that look in your eyes
Now, everybody, break the ice and get your boof on tonight

We've got Buddha and booby to blaze and bounce when we chill
Consumed by hooters that truly make me bounce on her frills
Ha-ha-ha, fireplace fondling, fingers in your funhouse
Growlin' at Mother Nature 'til it's sundown

Through a mist of toxic bud, the Gov rocks the club
And if you fly, I'm the pilot for your cockpit, love
Bathin' with black booty beauties like the Prince of Zamunda
Love is blind, I'm Richard Prior, like, ""Punta, punta, punta""

I might be bearded with my pipe, but this naval captain shabby
Will not explore down under unless you shave your map of Tassie
Too right Governor, ain't nothin' new to these cunnies
So drop your dacks, young love, show us that zoo in your undies

There was a beaver, two calves when I found her lair
A hundred crabs and an ass with a thousand hairs
A purring pussy that plays head tricks on my mind
An oily oyster and a dead fish I can't find

Hey, yo, ladies? (Yeah?)
Does rubbin' the nub make you crazy? (Yeah)
You got tits and butts with no maybes? (Oh yeah)
Well, answer me this, do you love a good boofin', well? (Hell yeah)
Hey, yo, gentlemen? (Yeah?)
You ready to up, jump and represent? (Yeah)
If she's game and you game, you adventurous? (Yeah)
You got that look in your eyes
Now, everybody, break the ice and get your boof on tonight

Get your boof on, now get your boof on
'Cause it's a good song to get your boof on
Get your boof on, now get your boof on
'Cause it's a good song to get your boof on

Get your boof on tonight, get your boof on tonight
Get your boof on, get your boof on
Get your boof on tonight
If she's lookin' that tight, with that pussy delight
Then get your boof on, get your boof on

Good Morning Australia,Day of the Dog,2006,"In this world, I’ve sacrificed a lot for these dreams
And all I can say is everything is not what it seems
I won’t stumble through life, without gravity’s reigns
And gallop through this motherfucker been tagging these brains
But now they’re looking up to us after copping out rap
And suddenly we gotta move people at the drop of a hat
Like an inspirational tap, when are our records blessed
And they don’t know half the shit I say, and fucking second guessing
Like I got the answers, they yearn for wisdom
Man, I’m just scrounging for some motherfucking words to give 'em
On stage, I say confidently in between if you say hoes
But I know my confidence is about as solid as playdough
But hey yo, forget it man you’re lifting the art
Let’s ignore the fact your whole crew is drifting apart
Let’s ignore the fact it took three years of tears, sweat and blood
To make an album made of spits and fucking three seconds buzz
Give me something (fuck 'em)

I just don’t know, I just don’t know
I just don’t know

Looking for someone to hold, waiting for love, I stare at cupid
But until then this writing’s so therapeutic
Trying to make this rap shit work, and move units
It’s what drives me, loves me back, let's me groove to it
Just a kid with a radio up in the blue Buick
To this day still pumping through me like it was blue fluid
They’re used to it, hearing beauty up in this booth
You wouldn’t believe my insecurities and that’s the fucking truth, like
Why am I shy when people read the same rap I write
I’m about to kick in front of ten thousand guests tonight
It don’t make sense, man, it’s simple and plain
I get depressed too, but it’s this that rekindles the flame
They say we sing to the days and rap to the fellas
I’m safe with the winds and the rains, man we out like umbrellas
I wanna be fit, eat good, live good, no bluffing
All I know's the wisest man knows he knows nothing
Give me something

I just don’t know, I just don’t know
I just don't know

Good morning Australia, Good morning Australia!

I found, hope in the sky and a mic in the meadow
So on a page I can bring this shit to life like Geppetto
And if freedom can be touched I’ve been chasing her scent
But I can’t afford flowers cause I’m paying the rent
So all you rappers on telly, who be clocking the riches
I guess you got it made, and I’m washing the dishes
Cockroaches in my kitchen, real cheap plumbing
My rubbish is full, and the bills keep coming
And behind closed doors, I know they kill for fame
The media made 'em do it, it’s all still the same
Gaze through a glass eye when I chill with Jane
I bashed out, down damn it just to build a plane
Amusement park mind state, surreal terrain
My knuckles are bruised and bloody and my shield is stained
This is why kids will sing blues, to deal with pain
With ghetto blast to getaways, that’s real as rain
Yo I feel the same, as my broke motherfuckers
Still loving and spitting and kicking real deal rugged shit
Midnight, moonlight, my rhyme is its own
I wait for, blind hummingbirds to find a way home
See I’m nothing but another with a never ending feeling
For the gutter and a way to get above the government
To say that together, hey bro I came with the pressure
To pimp slap John Howard and make a change for the better
Catch a piece of pleasure, when I puff the weed smoke
I'm tight on a mic, like nuts in speedos
So how could just a caveman, put flowers in the pavement
And still fight for freedom through the powers of enslavement
Easy, cause I’m writing even after school's over
'Cause a page is place I can park my bulldozer
I wander in the winter, I’m naked in the summer
And my wordplay is hot like it’s my favourite fucking jumper

It’s the poetry we push, it's the art that had us driven
It’s the stage we set our lives, it’s the apartment that I live in, bitch

Good morning Australia, Good morning Australia!
Come on!",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-good-morning-australia-lyrics
It’s Working,Day of the Dog,2006,"Things Have Just Started

Here I am motherfucker... Here I am
Told you I was coming didn't I tell ya? YEAHHH!

Ahh shit, I think we done fucked up the industry
Cause every tom dick and dumb cunt is dissing B
L I S S plus Eso and Izm so this is dedicated to you, so you best go and listen
Now don't you try to tell me what hip hop is not
You don't own that motherfucker man, you got it pops?
Some gonna chop the crop, some gonna cop the rock
Some gonna cock the Glock and they gonna pop the shot
But us? What we gonna try and do is rock the spot
We hot to trot, it's not our fault we top the lot
And you just can't hack it can you? You lost the plot
So put your wack album out and I'ma watch it flop
So cop my cock and quit acting tough
You mad at us cause at a show you lack the punch
To pack in cunts and hear em' all react at once
With every front-row minger trying to snatch your nuts
Your rapping sucks, ya faggot chumps, the facts are rough
""I'ma sell out man"" that just cracks me up
So back the fuck up, at all of the lessons when you step to me
And don't you dare ever try to question my integrity
Even your meanest diss is like a harmless joke
Dude I'm right here, quit dissing the bar of soap
You varmints choke knowing that my style is ill
You can hate us all you want but you can't deny the skill
So fire at will and any song you tyrants still
Won't even affect me, I just smile and chill
So please it's over someone give me a drum roll
You numb skulls can take it straight up the bum hole

Hit me hit me high, hit me hit me low
It don't really matter cause you know we're gonna grow
It's Working... It's working
""You god damn right""
It's working
""And that's a guaranteed fact""
Hit me hit me high, hit me hit me low
It don't really matter cause you know we're gonna grow
It's Working... It's working
""Bliss N Eso is back""

Ya see Bliss N Eso's back and that's a guaranteed banger
If you haven't seen us then you haven't seen hammers
Hit concrete and then bloom something beautiful
Cause this song means there's no room for the usual
So get off my gonads, I'm proud and broke
Where my head is a notepad in a cloud of smoke
Jealous rats in the city, they know I'm king
Cause I remodel the world with the flow I bring
See you rap for the cash and I pity your job
My style's wild like a child from the city of God
And Eso's headspace is something you can't touch
Head-bobbing at me is like fucking with hard drugs
In the park drunk living it up
With my state to state crews not giving a fuck
We stay ""fresh"" even when shit gets so bad
That we gotta be those fathers for kids with no dads
And that's how we bust and build this
Put my heart in a track bro, touch the real shit
There's no word to describe how real it's been
But it feels like flying down steep hills on wheely bins
I did it my way, I self-promote
This ain't Bentley's parked out the front of wealthy homes
This is for those who's words arn't usually heard
Who can grab that mic and bloody prove what they're worth
I'm not a player at a picnic with my biscuit cocked
I'm not the type to ask kiss the boss
I'm the blackout that wipes out like 50 blocks
That middle finger up kids give the cops

Hit me hit me high, hit me hit me low
It don't really matter cause you know we're gonna grow
It's Working... It's working
""You god damn right""
It's working
""And that's a guaranteed fact""
Hit me hit me high, hit me hit me low
It don't really matter cause you know we're gonna grow
It's Working... It's working
""Bliss N Eso is back""
Hit me hit me high, hit me hit me low
It don't really matter cause you know we're gonna grow
It's Working... It's working
""You god damn right""
It's working
""And that's a guaranteed fact""
Hit me hit me high, hit me hit me low
It don't really matter cause you know we're gonna grow

Lights Camera Action,Day of the Dog,2006,"This is dedicated to the emcee that struggles with the funds and
Most of his shows, you can count the crowd on one hand
He's straight up ill with every tune that he's played, he wrote
But barely even gets played on Community radio
And he ain't got a label, he rolls dolo
Pressing up his own shit and doing his own promo
He holds no dough, like an old hobo, they think he's so loco
But oh no, no, he's like a lone Frodo
That won't give up, through any turn of the weather
Even though the road is slow, he's still determined as ever
Until he's churning out cheddar, because his flow is butter
He gotta get exposed like he needs to blow his cover
They start to feel his vibe 'cause his rhyming is hot
So the deal arrives and he just signs on the dot
It started so simply, all about the words that you say
But now there's jerks that are paid off his works that are played
And he ain't getting shit, just a few perks of the trade
He sees a real industry and what lurks in the shade
'Cause everything he worked for, the struggle to build, the love and the skill
Ain't worth shit next to a couple of mill
So he sits back, feels lame, jaded and old
The game is taking its toll, the fame's raping his soul
Of the industry, 'cause they forgot that this is art
The aim was breaking the mould, not trying to fit the part
But if he, spits it smart, he can hit the heart
He only got one dart and he ain't gonna miss the mark
Creative control, only a few who are found
Completely credible music but with that lucrative sound

It goes, lights, camera, action, you're on son
You wanna rhyme but are you in it for the long run?
'Cause you dream about platinum on this mic
Best, wake the fuck up, it don't happen overnight
It goes, lights, camera, action, you're on son
You wanna rhyme but are you in it for the long run?
'Cause you dream about platinum on this mic
Best, wake the fuck up, it don't happen overnight

This is dedicated to the MC who lives in the spotlight
With teeth shown from hunger like dogs in a cockfight
They're frightened by his freedom so they call the police
But he's the one who wakes you up, when you're falling asleep
That kid with an idea, who catches the bus
Who writes life through his eyes, that's attached to a brush
And he paints the world, exactly how he sees it
And if rhyming is a secret I don't know, how he keeps it
But believe me it's some deep shit and these kids all relate
You can't see it but you feel it like a kick in the face
And when he grows up, shit, so will his rhymes
Time after time again he'll keep, blowing your mind
His flow is divine, just a young buck with a curse
He sets fire to a cypher with a couple of words
Man he's out for the cause, man he's out there on tours
Trying to visit your town there's no, bringing him down
So, get ready for the ride of your life
Trying to maintain but have a slice of the pie
It's a damn shame, that their life has a price
But they can't touch me or tell me what to rhyme on this mic
So I rhyme what I like, trying to bring that love back
Wild, and young and hard like a rugrat
Still walking in the club packed, yelling ""where the bud at?""
Living like the underdog who promised that he'd come back

It goes, lights, camera, action, you're on son
You wanna rhyme but are you in it for the long run?
'Cause you dream about platinum on this mic
Best, wake the fuck up, it don't happen overnight
It goes, lights, camera, action, you're on son
You wanna rhyme but are you in it for the long run?
'Cause you dream about platinum on this mic
Best, wake the fuck up, it don't happen overnight",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-lights-camera-action-lyrics
Mad Tight,Day of the Dog,2006,"Y-y-y-yyyyo check me out right here

It seems, rappers are unhappy with the price of the gold card
While on this mic, I'm like ice in a cold glass
There's no doubt I man handle a track
And break this bitch down like Bam Bam with his bat
You players act pussy like Jessica Rabbit
I'ma hit you with some shit to get your head in a hammock
I'm that poet burst on that park bench to smoke
The only Superman who knows Clarke Kent's a joke
I fist fuck freedom, I fight for my right
To hit the lab with my pad and have the time of my life
You're damn right, I've been sparkin up the high state
And fight in the night with my armoured butterflies
But note this, I throw bricks. I'm heaven sent throw this
But no shit, my flow's sick I represent so
Drown in my dreams when you look at my eyes
And just bounce to my beat to prove the boogie's alive

Hey yo, Sydney! What? What? Your style is mad tight
Your style is mad tight. Your style is mad tight
Hey yo, Brissy! What? What? Your style is mad tight
Your style is mad tight. Your style is mad tight

You see I dream to be on TV flashing my balls
Throwing it up for my lads like graff on the wall
That's why we gotta maintain and struggle through the drama
And stay on the rise like bubbles in my lager
But right now you better make some way
For new talent that pretty much covers state to state
And, when it's all done, I'll be riding the back
With uncle Sam getting drunk, with my eyes on his cash

While you pursuing the cash bro, I'm doin the mad flows
Spittin more dirty shit than players chewing tobacco
Bragging they blast fools and how they pimp slap hoes
But I think I'll be less bored watching grass grow, arsehole!
I'm not a new face, I know this record shit is big loot race
They asked to see my tour budget, I held up my shoe lace
We could only afford two plane tickets and some toothpaste
Hey yo, Eso, help me shove Izm in my suitcase

Hey yo, Melbourne! What? What? Your style is mad tight
Your style is mad tight. Your style is mad tight
Adelaide! What? What? Your style is mad tight
Your style is mad tight. Your style is mad tight

So you co the first record at the hip hop store
Man that shit was fresh man but this is sophomore
And I ain't even gotta to ask if you feel us
You know the Bliss n Eso throws the illest bash in the village
Oh, you know bro, it's those nutty loco kids
Got the crowd bouncing like a sea of cats on pogo sticks
We on that next level, dropping turds, bombing your whole plane
2008 rap Jonathan Coltrane
My lab was built great, plush leather couches and silk drapes
Try furniture made out of planks of wood and milk crates
We both underground blokes spitting profound quotes
Sipping the local lager mingling with the town folk
Just two white boys and a half Arab man
Travel the land in a old busted thrash caravan
See hip hop finds us when we feel all lost
So we gonna ride this motherfucker 'til the wheels fall off

Hey yo, Perth! What? What? Your style is mad tight
Your style is mad tight. Your style is mad tight
Hey yo, Tassie! What? What? Your style is mad tight
Your style is mad tight. Your style is mad tight
Hey yo, Canberra! What? What? Your style is mad tight
Your style is mad tight. Your style is mad tight
Byron Bay! What? What? Your style is mad tight
Your style is mad tight. Your style is mad tight
To the rest of the land, your style is mad tight
Your style is mad tight. Your style is mad tight
Your style is mad tight. Your style is mad tight
Your style is mad tight. Your style is mad tight
Your style is mad tight. Your style is mad tight
Your style is mad tight. Your style is mad tight",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-mad-tight-lyrics
Nowhere But Up,Day of the Dog,2006,"We ain't from life in the gutter, so they don't feel our stuff
What you like to be stubborn? What we ain't real enough?
Cause we white from the suburbs and we write from a brother's
Raw and uncut emotion, blazin' a mic in the cupboard
You motherfuckers make me laugh with that ridiculous shit
Who brings it like Nick-ity-split, as wicked as Bliss
See these ballers see a white boy, start kiddin' and laugh
But I'm like Billy Hoyle hustlin' Sidney for the cash
And you just talkin' loud, you an imposter clown
Where'd you pick your style up? The fuckin' lost and found?
Gosh it sounds like you washed it down
And sprinkled it with sugar just to get your little career off the ground
They can't stand to watch it, next to us rock it
You look like Randy Watson with sexual chocolate
(and we) bet you would cop this perpetual hot shit
Now you MC's can't blow with this testical chop bitch
Two hands on the mic straight bustin' this ammo
Crossing the kings is like fucking with Pando
Throwing rocks at our house won't crack the glass soldier
We make one hell of a racket so we smacking back boulders
""Hey yo Bliss, you heard what the message board said?""
No but I will knock you out with my nuts on your forehead
Take a pic and post it up when you noticed these three lads
Shit, cos what's words when you was served the Bliss teabag

They love and hate me, need me, leave me
But I can't stay away
I gave you pieces of my heart and you just threw them away
So now's the time to tell them all that I just don't give a fuck
No matter what they throw at us we're going nowhere but up

Okay, this is the moment of truth
Are you a tourist to the art or is your home in the booth
See this is my house, I rhyme for the cause
Bend spoons with my crew and cut diamonds with thoughts
Then hoon down hills with wheel barrows for laughs
I'm Robbin Hood on this mic splitting arrows in half
And they know brick by brick I built this house
Cos only shit like this can show me out
But when I bust my free's I'm psychotic when I rock it
When I'm on the streets I got narcotics in my pocket
When I bomb the beat bro you cop it like a *dropkick* to the face
From the kid in the cockpit gettin' blazed
It's still B.E.I. and you can trust me bro
I still sailing the seas in a rusty boat
I'm still heat on this mic when I bust my flow
I still chill with Jane the biggest slut I know
The slave that will serve the king
With a crew this tight like virgin minge
And in a dark world I use my rhyming as a light
Bliss N Eso is back, I'm Bruce Almighty on this mic

They love and hate me, need me, leave me
But I can't stay away
I gave you pieces of my heart and you just threw them away
So now's the time to tell them all that I just don't give a fuck
No matter what they throw at us we're going nowhere but up",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-nowhere-but-up-lyrics
Party at My Place,Day of the Dog,2006,"Yo I know a place that you lot can play
It's a party that you can hear like two blocks away
Fuck an attitude and fuck the right to apparel to wear
Fuck driving I rolled up on a barrel of beer
And busting through the door to Bliss N Eso blessing the speakers
It's so packed in here that I'm stepping on sneakers
But this MC corners me, he's got my patience spent
'Cause he's wack but thinks he's the shit like David Brent
Gave me his demo to Sus, He wouldn't let go of my nuts
I was like ""Dude I'll be right back just need a bevo to clutch""
Yo, Weapo what's up? I got the urge to write a sentence
Izm rocked up with three Virgin flight attendents
When his beer runs out there'll be some trouble and some bugging
So open the fridge and stash a couple in the oven
I'm a sneaky little cunty but believe me
It was funny when I found two mingers gettin' freaky in the dunny
(""Wait that's not a girl, what's up bro?"")

It's me Motley
Didn't I tell you fuckers to watch me
Bliss, you know I'm pissed man you should've stopped me
Now I'm drunk and this fat chicks got me
Hand-cuffed to the taps and now she's filling the bath
I'm from the UK so she love the way that I rap
But the bitch got sideburns worse than Shaft
Shit's not funny man please don't laugh
That's when Eso bust down the door
Hey yo, get your arse up off my bathroom floor
You've only had a couple of drinks we got more
It's beer o'clock bro I told you before
Now hit this weed. But I don't smoke
Ahh what the hell man just one toke
Nah, take two hits but watch you don't
Watch you don't-watch you don't choke!

Well there's a party at my place and you're all invited
A place to just chill, get ill and spend the night in
You like that? ""Hell yeah!""Well, get amongst the buzz
And crack a night cap bro, this one's on us
Well there's a party at my place and you're all invited
A place to just chill, get ill and spend the night in
You like that? ""Hell yeah!""Well, get amongst the buzz
And crack a night cap bro, this one's on us

Ay yo it's freak fest two double o' five
It's quiet in the hood but there's trouble at mine
Brothers that are broke, we don't know how to be rich
There's stolen steaks on the barbie on my balcony bitch
I'm teaching newcomers how to shape and make a bong
While Bliss hides my beer so we can take em' later on
Plus the colour of my c'mons like the Canberra Raiders
It got me crackin' jokes with Izm playin' San Andreas
We got the whole block shacking outrageous
Cause a party ain't a party without waking your neighbours
Or makin' arrangements to go break in a basement
And steal another motherfucking case for these cavemen
Kicking flows freestyling on some ill shit
If you ain't down with us then you not on the bill kid
So piss off cause this cost nothing for my brothers
Just a house party full of nuttty motherfuckers
So bounce, break something, shake the house down
Get on a stage and then make the crowd shout
Bounce, break something, shake the house down
Get on a stage and then make the crowd shout

Well there's a party at my place and you're all invited
A place to just chill, get ill and spend the night in
You like that? ""Hell yeah!""Well, get amongst the buzz
And crack a night cap bro, this one's on us
Well there's a party at my place and you're all invited
A place to just chill, get ill and spend the night in
You like that? ""Hell yeah!""Well, get amongst the buzz
And crack a night cap bro, this one's on us

""Party people in the place I'd like to get to know ya""
""Party people in the place I'd like to get to know ya
First push up your hands if you's are weed smokers""

Look, I'm so dizzy Izzy Izm got busy
On the ones and twisy; two's
Now I'm drinkin' Victoria Bitter out of my shoes
That's when Bliss told me the bad news
The door bust open there was two cops to see
They turned the music off and said ""Who's got the weed?""
And everyone went quiet, but then they told us the point
""Calm down love, just roll the copper a joint""

Well there's a party at my place and you're all invited
A place to just chill, get ill and spend the night in
You like that? ""Hell yeah!""Well, get amongst the buzz
And crack a night cap bro, this one's on us
Well there's a party at my place and you're all invited
A place to just chill, get ill and spend the night in
You like that? ""Hell yeah!""Well, get amongst the buzz
And crack a night cap bro, this one's on us

It goes on and on and on 'til the break of break of dawn
Everybody gettin' loose, everybody gettin' on
And it's all good
That's the motto so grab a bevo and let go until tomorrow

Party people the place I'd like To get to know ya
Girls shaking their tootsies
With a bim bam boogie and a bottle of whisky...
With the hip-hop hash, fix with the big cities
When the people on the party to get LIP
Cause its my house, my crib, my kingdom
Where the floorboards creek and the kids keep singing
Hell Yeah!",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-party-at-my-place-lyrics
Soldier On,Day of the Dog,2006,"Yo, Bliss n Eso is like back and fourth like Jack n Torch and trust me
We tap the source and rap with force but fuck me
These rapping dorks are crap of course
So why when we do a show it's always as these whack cats' support
And why do there tracks go north and ours go nowhere
Why do I lack a Porche why is it no fair
Please pull your fucking skirt up
I'm proud of everything we've done
And everything we've worked for
And I wouldn't read you shit if I could I feel darko
'Cause if I open for ya'll it's still our show
Bliss, I'm just a brother with a given goal
So don't you dare try to shove me in that pigeon hole
Of being boring and lame to gain fortunate and fame
When I just walk the darkness with a torch and a flame
When it's pouring with rain, I drop gems in the drizzle
And stay forging are name where my pen is a chisel
Where my mind is a mallet, I'm rhyming to Alice
And gallop through sleepy hollows to the side of a palace
Man I could dive in the sunrise
I could swim in this breeze
This poem makes me a jungle and I'm swinging from trees
What could u possibly utter to be like stopping us brother
When we out on the road man all we got is each other sloggin it out (c'mon)
On the sundick round circuit
Just running a muck, it's like a three clowned circus
But we found purpose to speak our minds
Through beats and rhymes and we ain't even reached our prime
I'm just a poetry peddler who found the lavish gold
And you can see it too it's just down this rabbit hole

Oh I've been marching for so long
Representing where I'm from
When I make these songs it makes me strong so I can soldier on
Been marching for so long
Representing where I'm from
When I make these songs it makes me strong so I can soldier on

(Yo check me out right here)
On this mic I'm a stampeding buffalo
My fingers paint pictures of a man cleaning up his throne
Getting ready for any attack
'Cause me and this mic have become very attatched
And I won't let go of this feeling I've got in my belly
The revolution is here and it's not on your tellie
Have you ever had to hate when you're trying to be calm
Have you ever had your own mother die in your arms
Well I have and her outlook keeps me strong
The rolling stone of this home since shes been gone
So I know what its like too only have your crew
Where meaning seems lost and you know you have too choose
To get up or get down when life's trying to be serious
Like get up like school's out and life's a free period
But when it happened I didn't wanna go out
'Cause if people couldn't relate, shit I'd wanna throw down
So how can I write and stay out for the cause
When hell's in my lounge room and there's doubt in my thoughts
It was the sun through a smile when I look at her pictures
It's the face that my rapping not a hook for the riches
And if I give you my heart, I hope it makes me rich
'Cause I don't roll in a roice like a Jay-Z clip
But if you're fake you're rich bro, take these hints
That's just Satan bum fucking you for eighteen cents
But me I'm willing too roll I'm willing too ride
Shit I'm still in control I'm still on this mic

Oh I been marching for so long
Representing where I'm from
When I make these songs it makes me strong so I can soldier on
Been marching for so long
Representing where I'm from
When I make these songs it makes me strong so I can soldier on",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-soldier-on-lyrics
That Feeling,Day of the Dog,2006,"One, two, one, two mic check respect
To the old school and new lest we forget
That we come along way through the pain and lovin'
To get that feelin' of freedom we wouldn't change for nothin'

See I sprouted in the spring of 80's, sailed the seas for
A third world, home ship wrecked in Indonesia
Drifted to Virginia where my cargo like in a story
And I take you back without Donnie Darko in a delorean
I learnt to beat box mimicking P.G.C
You remember the titans but I never did C.T.C just
Public elementary the PTA called a stray noise
NWA tapes hidden under beds before playboys
In 92 I went down under but im like E.T
Cause no-one spoke this language cept' some dude in the B.E
See we found a baron just an excuse to cuss lots
But you damn right the only two dudes rappin at the bus stops

This is hip-hop, a sick man's medicine
This blood, sweat, tears and love and adrenalin
And it just (And it just) gives me that feelin
(It just gives me that feelin')
This is hip-hop, a sick man's medicine
This blood, sweat, tears and love and adrenalin
And it just (And it just) gives me that feelin
(It just gives me that feelin')

So from tryin' to stay up late to not sleepin' for days
Till my inner child smile when the reefer gets blazed
From crews that drift apart to mine that keeps shit in sync
From the girl that I love, to the peace that she brings
Cause her harmony's the only thing that makes me behave
Hoping next month grows wings and takes me away
If only you could see this poet dance on his note pad
Oblivious to things I don't have
Cause, music is everywhere, music is life
And to the rhythm of the tap drip music is mine
Music is yours
And you can feel it on tours
From trains to bus rides, down south to up north
May the force be with you
See this crew three fists full
Poetry with power, life I know it's in the flowers is magic where my mind's in orbit
This brain's a foster home and these rhymes are orphans

This is hip-hop, a sick man's medicine
This blood, sweat, tears and love and adrenalin
And it just (And it just) gives me that feelin
(It just gives me that feelin')
This is hip-hop, a sick man's medicine
This blood, sweat, tears and love and adrenalin
And it just (And it just) gives me that feelin
(It just gives me that feelin')

We gotta, live for the minute die for the culture
Young at heart but only gettin' older
Lord knows ill never put the mic down
Let's go we'll make it happen right now
Live for the minute die for the culture
Young at heart but only gettin' older
Lord knows ill never put the mic down
Let's go we'll make it happen right now

I got a lot to give, but I gotta live
So we win of this mic man is my prerogative
This game is ill so I'm just livin' for the minute
Can't play life from the bench man you gotta get up in it
And its all worth it
From the page where my lead roams
So touch any spirit
When I fed poems to wet foams
Workin' in the mud but yo I'm dreamin' in the clouds
And shit I can feel your love when you're screamin' out loud

It goes hip-hop, a sick man's medicine
This blood, sweat, tears and love and adrenalin
And it just (And it just) gives me that feelin
(It just gives me that feelin')
This is hip-hop, a sick man's medicine
This blood, sweat, tears and love and adrenalin
And it just (And it just) gives me that feelin
(It just gives me that feelin')

It's not dead, it's just been forgotten. Nobody teaches so no one knows it exists.

Them Boys,Day of the Dog,2006,"It's those underground cats who know the skills
Who drove miles to a show just to know who's real
Who's flows are ill, who's flows can still
Blow the roof off this bitch, drunk, stoned or chilled
See these kids now days think if you're rapping, you're well paid
When they knew nothing I was dropping acid in L.A
But I'm an Aussie like Commodore's and Falcons
A head-fuck compared to another boring album
So if you're used to a prison, I know a crew who can kick it
They touch down that rough sound without using their fingers
What we do is religious, what you do is a business
You got chicks in your clips but they're usually mingers
That's right, the life of a cave man
The dirty dog barking who writes in the basement
Bro, my crew's unique, after this you'll remember me
We lift kids lids with a fix you could never dream
[Hook: Bliss & 
Eso
]
Oh shit, you heard them boys
Raising hell, and making that noise
It goes stand up, hands up, right in the middle
I said hands up, stand up, it's live and official (uh-huh)
Oh shit, you heard them boys (uh-huh)
No shit, they bringing that noise
Put 'em up, middle fingers to the system
Cookin' up that shit to bring in the resistance

 hypothesis, there ain't a punk that's stoppin' us
We chargin' through this bitch like a drunk rhinoceros
Yeah they poppin' us loud
 for this preposterous sound
Ridiculous flow, locking this metropolis down
Sipping a , spitting out my mouth gold flames
Like didn't you know?
 You're fucking with the household name
(Syd city's finest) just a couple of letters, we stuck them together
To fuck with you and ruffle some feathers (suckers)
We be rebels with the hunger to win
And that's why three cheeky devils just got under your skin
We're rappin' flavour they tasting, aggravating the hating
Cause we just shat on the scene while captivating the nation
It's the prominent, dominant, hot shit
Bombing 'em, taking the whole fucking continent hostage
Bliss n Eso!
 Tearing round the country
Gallivanting, get the whole town chanting

One for the loving
Two for my people
Three for the feeling that the lyrics will leave you
They said that these kids couldn't do it, so make way
We're coming through to stick it to them
Four the the beat and
Five pumping proudly
Six for the lads in the front getting rowdy
Put em' up, middle fingers to the system
Cooking up that shit to bring in the resistance

No shit, they bringing that noise
Put 'em up, middle fingers to the system
Cookin' up that shit to bring in the resistance

We need loving, you think a pop song's enough?
They're all Barbie dolls, I'm a Tonka truck
The audio affirmation with a dreamer's torch
And a dog so big, he takes me for walks
So if these kids wanna hide then give this a try
Believe half the bullshit and pass that spliff to the right
Like, could I give a flying rat's arse, man? Fuck that
'Cause everything they say, bro, is water off a duck's 

We arrived on the scene, wide-eyed with crooked smiles
They gave us an inch, you damn right, we took a mile
We came a long way, this is not a quick swindle
Not bad for a crew without a hit single
Without a video thrashed on Channel V
A band of three who never paid a sample fee
We just do it for the love, that's why the punters know it
So put your fuckin' hands up for these underdogs, come on

Then Till Now,Day of the Dog,2006,"(Yeh Hell Yeah)

See it was hip hop that damn near changed my life
From meeting Ozone in L.A. in '85
From my attempts to try and step on stage and rhyme
To my beyond 2005 state of mind, from a copy of a culture
To teaching a tradition, from electric boogaloo
To the beat that keeps my rhythm, from
Wanderin' the tracks, to the mud that's in my hand, from
Wantin' to be black, to lovin' who I am
From not knowing where you're from
To the image of Sydney
From noone knowin' hip hop to kids thinkin' they're 50
From the dramas on film
To the dramas in life, from posh clothes
To now knowin' they're worth half of the price
And from thinking to be king you gotta have wealth
To the inner revolution I call knowledge of self
So from back then till now I still rap for the pleasure
Being rich or poor man, I'm still happy as ever

(You gotta understand me)
You gotta understand me
(I gotta understand you)
I gotta understand you
So we can stand together, recognise and vision
It's one love, one life, sets aside our differences
(You gotta understand me)
You gotta understand me
(I got to understand you)
'Cause that's what gets me by, in my life

From a punk in the Bronx to the heart of the 'burbs
From a dyslexic kid to a artist of words
From a wild child to my parents try'na steady me
From taking my Pac and Cube to givin' me Heavy D
From mimicking thugs thinking the lyrics were dope
To gettin' no satisfaction cause it was mirrors of smoke
From a home of hip hop to a land owned by rock
From rhyming to my mirror to thousands blowin' the spot
But through all the cheers and the brew and the beers
Was just a kid on the bus, headphones glued to his ears
Who just grew through the years, to pursue with the tears
The blood, sweat and make somethin' with his crew and his peers
See it was hip hop that put three lost souls on a map
From showin' us the country, to puttin' clothes on our back
And from finding myself in my mic's reflection
To this musical marriage that gave my life direction

(You gotta understand me)
You gotta understand me
(I gotta understand you)
I gotta understand you
So we can stand together, recognise and vision
It's one love, one life, sets aside our differences
(You gotta understand me)
You gotta understand me
(I got to understand you)
'Cause that's what gets me by, in my life

From a major label deal to buskin' on the street
Know this soul's not for sale when I'm fuckin' with these beats
The landlord of these lyrics with a touch of what can be
And if it doesn't break ground you could trust it wasn't me
The deepest of minds can't frame what I've imagined
Three eyes on the train writing rhymes on a napkin
See these kids don't have Bentley's, they sit and take the bus
But if you're playin' this tape your situation's sussed

From backstage butterfly's to a passionate debut
From not having a path to bush bashing a way through
From this rhyming release to stress I've got off my chest
From chasin' a dream to holdin' it hot off the press
And from shoe store days to writing sessions at night
To a culture that ultimatley taught me lessons in life
So from back then till now I still rap for the pleasure
Being rich or poor man, I'm still happy as ever

And we won't stop until we get that feeling
That's why we get on up (yeh)
That's why we get on up
Ohhh we won't stop until we get that feeling
That's why we get on up

(You gotta understand me)
You gotta understand me
(I gotta understand you)
I gotta understand you
So we can stand together, recognise and vision
It's one love, one life, sets aside our differences
(You gotta understand me)
You gotta understand me
(I got to understand you)

Up Jumped the Boogie,Day of the Dog,2005,"Yeah
It's that new Bliss n Eso shit straight out the wood works
So

Ladies and gentleman, friends and crews
I came here to represent and vent my views
See they want you brainwashed like everyone's for the money
While we want the scene to blow like cherry bombs in the dunny
So check it out, (Check it out) this is Eso on the mic
No fuckin' around, I came to get you in the vibe
Grab life by the balls and never look behind
'Cause when that bling bling dies, you can bet I'll be alive

A revolution of radical rebels writing raw, reflective rap
Of this cataclysmic cool calm collected cat
The front row covered when I'm spittin' the rhyme spray
Got skeletons on stage playin' rickety Steinway's
I sit with the owls, flippin' 'em out, flippin' the vowels
The midnight paddock runner who's tippin' the cows
Spittin' it foul, down and dirty 'cause my crew's shabby
All I want's my girl, a beer, a used caddy and this dude's happy
[Chorus: Eso & 
Bliss
]
Well, you heard about them boys from a foreign land
They gonna stroll across the globe with the mic in they hand
And they be puttin' it down the only way they know how
So sing it
, ""la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la""

From the moment the show starts and we emerge when the curtains break
Your chest starts burnin' like you're slurpin' the bourbon straight
We blow the spot with more heat we servin' than a furnace makes
Percolate this bitch until we certain every person shakes (
C'mon
)
The bim bam boogieman is drinkin' till I'm plastered
All over your ears, rappin' swingin' from the rafters
Got asses leavin' the seat when I'm freakin' the beat
Just husslin' like Larry Flint with the freedom of speech

So while it seems like there's millions of cats that stack loot
My crews here to stay like tax and tattoos
And there's no match for the kid that blows your mind
'Cause beatin' me's like me returnin' videos on time
And the music I make is like peakin' on a trip
Call me Jimmy Open Doors, day dreamin' with a spliff
Puttin' pressure on the player tryna look like the cool guy
But couldn't come close if he spoofed on the bullseye
[Chorus: Eso & 
Bliss

Well, you heard about them boys from a foreign land

They tried to put it down but up jumped the boogie (Shh)

They tried to put it down but up jumped the boogie (C'mon)

I found my tears on the pavement, some beers in the basement
Stuck, glassy-eyed in the year of creation
But I'm cheap like taking girls on a Mickey D's date
That's why you emcees can't see me like Dicky Knee's face

From shows of a thousand, we bounce 'em with rap and spinnin' tunes
To packed house parties rockin' some cats living room
We shakin' the ground, breakin' the bounds, makin' a sound
Your hands up, we hands down taking the crown (C'mon)

Yeah yeah yeah what's up party people (Nah) (Come on man!)
Yeah yeah what's up this is Mighty Mystro
The natural born spitter outta UK (Yeah motherfuckers)
UK and OZ connect
This is to all you half arse MCs out there (Take this)

For the chances of beating me for any coward are slim
'Cause I got the power to finish any clown in the ring
See I'll mark you for death and leave you with scars from your chest
To your legs and sever your head off with the largest machete
Then after I start and the ref shatter some glass on his head
And I'll grasp his neck till he's partially dead and he's starving for a breath
Blud I'm a devious man, the hardest to stop
Rappers claim to be harder than rock and I beat them to sand
And if you beef with this man I'll probably tie your feet to a van
And drive you through the streets of your land
Not messing with me fool, I'll take you to the steeple of a cathedral
And tie you to the peak with your hands and leave you to hang
So don't come around here talking all that jazz
When your crew ain't got as much juice as my ball bags have
Don't ever let me see you sport that badge
Or I'll leave your face with more footprints than my granny's door mat has

When the chances of beating me for any coward is slim
'Cause I got the power to finish any clown in the ring
This is a spit battle, you rappers talk shit like piss louts
Constipated rookies mad they ain't got shit out
I gallop at midnight through the darkest valleys
And keep heads rollin' in the city’s hardest alleys
I’m on a bigger bender than  Deltora when cop chases
After robbin' Danny Ocean for what he got in Los Vegas
I'm the lost pages of a lonely tale
Fuck beers, I chill with Indy, sippin' the Holy Grail
Man, I'm past the lemon grove, I'm past the light house
I'm past the steppin' stones; I'm past your wife's spouse
I'm the dreamer in the clouds, throwing lightning with Zeus
Striking at you spitting fire and igniting the booth
Emcees say they on the rise but then scream it's not fair
'Cause I burst their bubble and show the world its hot air
Shaking the populous round, breakin' monotonous sounds
Takin' the opulent crowd, thinkin' of chopping them down
They can't be stopping us now, down a beer, we out of here

It's the flowers in the pavement
 that led you to the harvest
And crept through then left you webbed between the armpits
That’s why these rappers don’t think
They lay in bed and they sulk
While I go the government like the Incredible Hulk
With insight that these hoes are brainless
Because even Tarzan doesn’t know where Jane is
She’s at my house, tryna get lifted
Cryin' her eyes out 'cause her life is her business
I said that most of these guys now have their eyes on a ribbon
So I'm hoping you fly now and remind me of living
Because I live in the jungle where the buildings are bamboo
The kids are in huddles and we chill on the sand dunes
Like Mad Max, but the sad fact
Is that's my actual name, I shouldn’t have to explain why
My shit's a pool stick in the devil's eye-socket
And I flip lids of school kids whenever I rock it
Get it? I got it, my raps hit your dome with knowledge
And my life's a rifle at the cracked window of a cottage

Worldwide,Day of the Dog,2006,"Yea check it
Man I never said I rap from slums or I pack a gun
But look around and at what that old booms bat’s become
Banging bullets, bitches, beamers, rebels, and blunts
And I’m just trying to be myself and stay ahead of the bunch
And muster up a buck for this rap peddler’s lunch
But at crunch time man these rhymes seem never enough
And shit what the fuck you think we give um on stage
Whose spinning those synonyms living on a minimum wage
Chippin’ away flipping the page just ink in the pain
Contained in this modern day age citizen Cain
But fuck it in a perfect storm you don’t abandon ship
We stand with fists and spit tattered manuscripts
Navigating off moonshine and spin these rhymes
Into cloth in our sails on a crimson tide
And every song we wrote while on this boat
Was raised to catch the wind of the common folk
Armies of mad troops unite and work underground
Harvesting grass roots to fight and stare adversity down
A worldwide revolution on a fleet of these boats
Scrubbing the decks of the craft that keeps us afloat
It’s like I’ll feel like that one day MC fortairer
It’s the hip hop community
It’s from the MC 
It’s peace love and unity
This is worldwide (you know the struggle)
Worldwide (you know the hustle)
This is a worldwide sound sea
Hip-hop community
Rappers with no boundaries
They can do anything
This is worldwide (you know the struggle)
Worldwide (you know the hustle)

Bliss N Eso
This is hip hop blues that what we’re talking about
There’s a part of every MC that’s walking this route

There’s no margin to my magic, there’s no borders to my writing
There’s no part to end the madness hit that all of us are fighting
And it’s funny to think that countries can link
Through peace on a page to the blood that runs through my ink
So let’s celebrate the fact that I levitate a track
And the devils I do away with will never make it back
This bricks, bats, and badgers - pigs, rats, and taxes
Five finger discounts for kids acting savage
And that’s the way that game is played
Peace and war putting pressure on the same days
I’m trying to maintain, keep a focused mind
That’s probably why their rhymes aren’t as dope as mine
See I fight for the free bro fuck their money
I steal toilet paper from local public dunnies
And there’s nothing funny about that or how broke we get
So to the system shit I show no respect
And that television it got um brain washed
Different names it’s a shame it’s the same song
That’s why we huddle and burn this broccoli
Cause they know it takes a lifetime to earn the lottery",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-worldwide-lyrics

Creepy,Flowers In The Pavement,2004,"Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to welcome you inside the mind
There'll be no bell for lunch without a popper
And back then I was never embarrassed even with my dick out like chopper

I get so lonely I brawl with the music
I'm so underground, you silly bitch, I crawl through the sewage
Commercial shit, it's just all a nuisance
And Esoteric to aid he calls on the purest
To emerge from the gutter and do away with one dimensional
MC's who have to turn to their mother in a battle situation
Ring the bell when the cattle reach my station
I love riding on donkeys with headphones on
I see visions when I walk
I know a whole lot of fucking pigeons that can talk
They remind me that the hunger's real
And if you're gonna come at all you best come with skill

It's like B to the E to the I, it's just so creepy
Take a stroll through the woods and believe me
We're doing this of embers, no kindles
And the pioneers of small crease, they see a smoke signal
It's like B to the E to the I, it's just so creepy
Take a stroll through the woods and believe me
We're doing this of embers, no kindles
And the pioneers of small crease, they see a smoke signal

You see, Lucifer couldn't catch me, he's playing soft
I play cards with Merlin, I blow smoke with Gandalf
Blinky bill and I rob banks and shape shift
And the only icy shit I got is my dick in the cake mix
I'll take this to a land of snakes with red bellies
Secret handshakes with Ned Kelly
I came to prove, that we can too
When your whole style reminds me of an ad for cheap shampoo
That's right, life's a puzzle and I'm making it fit
And don’t bother me on the dunny, son, I'm taking a shit
But when I'm off, and no doubt about it, I'm partly mental
Meet me in the tool shed with all your sharpened pencils
Envision the calligraphy that hacks the gift
And slap on your thinking caps to catch my drift
Porn king ding fish burn makes the world move
Poetical principal of rhyme the girls do
So, come on, lads, please, pass the billy
We got hip hop, at ease, arse and titty
And I'm stumbling (shit) numb of a case
I got a dick in my pants who thinks he's running the place
Walking like a wooden puppet this track goes out
To anybody talking like I couldn't cut it
A little faith, trust me, goes a long way
That's why my magical wand waves so that the song stays in
Timeless like I'm on stage rhyming
Cause in the sky rhythm and rhyme living the live
And the moral of the story is , I juggle just to manage
I'm a ghost for now, but I'm subtle when I vanish

It's like B to the E to the I, it's just so creepy
Take a stroll through the woods and believe me
We're doing this of embers, no kindles
And the pioneers of small crease, they see a smoke signal
It's like B to the E to the I, it's just so creepy
Take a stroll through the woods and believe me
We're doing this of embers, no kindles
And the pioneers of small crease, they see a smoke signal

We're just kicking it so beautifully and usually we just chill out
Next to broads that foolishly with these carps of jewelry
I found these balds of nudity and it's all just new to me
Such an odd community (hey yo it's probably puberty)

Ey yo we've got to grow the fuck down
We still in adolescence
To come to the clearing in the woods
Lit by the incandescent moon
Yeah I see you smirk and say not likely
Original vocab just don't compute
Like we were pikies
(So I stand there)
And all I hear is
""Geez, you're a pair of slopes""
Weaze, no caramel so please don't parallel (that's right)
Us to candy rappers cuz they end up in the waste basket
When their style spit there ain't no flavour, no
It's that taste lasting
Oompa Loompa, doopity doo
Man I’m that Everlasting Gobstopper that blew the city fuse
So don't think you're gonna get away
You little rascal
Cause we got the country locked down like we're from Nashville

It's like B to the E to the I, it's just so creepy
Take a stroll through the woods and believe me
We're doing this of embers, no kindles
And the pioneers of small crease, they see a smoke signal
It's like B to the E to the I, it's just so creepy
Take a stroll through the woods and believe me
We're doing this of embers, no kindles
And the pioneers of small crease, they see a smoke signal

Some outskirt hillbillies just chilling on some dirt bikes
Rounded up these Varmints taking them back to the turnpike
When the herb lights, we’ll pass it, when we spy ‘em from the ditch
We show 'em they got a wardrobe and a lion and a witch
You wanna pitch your tent right here at our camp site
(There’s a crack in the back of the closet)
Oh oh, I'll get that lamp lite
[?] the wood hatchet these splinters kill
Then I feel a winter, chill and I'm in a timber mill
Through the prairie, I storm through the grass and night thicket
Past the bushes, the brambles, the billygoats and white pickets
And I'm here
I crush the petals with my sandals
I'm walking through the woods
With little Gretel and Hanz
Look west on the hills
Up here i hear a moan, bellow
From an old fellow at a park
With a couple of stones yellow
And he was more bubbly than a geiser
That Old Faithful freestyler
Was more [?] kaizer
We jumped on a snow plow
But like a magic trick he made a dragon puff up
With a gadget fit for bagging up all the adjectives
I ask you this
Yo, in all sinsavity
Does it even occur to you
Half our shit is all a pavity
All those prissy little nitwits
Just trying to make their shit flip
When they spit fits of mindless crap
I mean, I guess we are some misfits
And you might call me a cynic
But I just don't mimic
At the hands of today
We still make you bounce without the gimmick
Like we're pumping this club
And we’ll up and make it so fresh
In the southern we’re coming with something different from the rest
And by the time I get to the club man
I'll be hurting
I get there, there's one guy there
Some dude named Tyler Durden, man

It's like B to the E to the I, it's just so creepy
Take a stroll through the woods and believe me
We're doing this of embers, no kindles
And the pioneers of small crease, they see a smoke signal
It's like B to the E to the I, it's just so creepy
Take a stroll through the woods and believe me
We're doing this of embers, no kindles
And the pioneers of small crease, they see a smoke signal",http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blissneso/creepy.html

Swimming in mainstream
I don't wanna be stuck there
I want freedom and a side order of fuck yeah
Well fuck this, 'cause I've had enough shit
Time to get our backs rubbed
And have our dicks licked

She just curled 
And I twiddled my thumbs
'cause my penis jamming
To the middle of buns
I'm protecting women
I'm a-guarding hoes
And when Eso's near
Watch your garden hose

Home is always singing
The freedom's always falling
The people are always there
The bosses are always calling
""Oh my God! Can you do your job right?""
Fuck jobs my 9-to-5's a ride all night

Give thanks to the blossom
It's the anker that got him
To the deeper 
When the rose sank to the bottom
To the bank 
Where the people dream, and so

This day better get night
Looks like vampire's been on our tail for years
And there won't be no backstage party
If these Aussie lads don't get their beers

When I look through my eyelid's slid
I see a pirate ship with twenty vibrant hits
In a row swinging synchronised sequences
I sheepishly blink my eye singing to my flow
When it go

Lalalalalala Y O
You've gotta get up to get down

This is hitting like a hot box in your car
Got every crowd member screaming ""Lalala""
You know the joint, it goes ""lalala""
You know the joint, it goes ""lalala""
Take to the sky, savor this high
Rip off that motherfucking cage on your mind
Clip wingmaking on stage with our mic
But behind closed doors I set pagers alight
Could you pitch a rebel
Could you pitch a revis
Could you keep it humble if you handle all the riches
Painting on the pigeons'  making it so different, hey
Don't you even go there 'cause I've got this 
On and on, give a kiss, sing a song
Get down, wobble wobble, one hit and it's on
Feet to the street and I struck when I step on my 
One more, let me take another breath
I though about this thing in 
Dudes are creeping 'round my house
I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout
But oh my God, I must be thinking something
Girls are getting high in my room and humping
Oh don't shuffle the plank that we walk on
For years and years Bliss n Eso can talk on
And last question: are we gone? Oh yes
And we blew the track up like Marylin Monroe's dress

Lalalalalala Y O
Lalalalalala Y O
You've gotta get up to get down

If you 
 experience and save yourself the door price
Enter the venue, look at these shoes, all them fit them
Then I looked down, I knew what two would fall 'em victim, see
When we rock the name brand, fed's are rising
Did you know your occupation's advertising with common billboards
I know we must face these vibrations as I tough base
I feel the material under my sweatshirt it seeks essentially the
Serial number that's your unique identity
A race that turn the pencils , now

Greenhouse,Flowers In The Pavement,2004,"I know you've met all the rest of them...
... but, seriously...

Have you ever met a hippie
From the city called Sydney?
An emcee who's no joke
And blows smoke like a chimney
No? well, get with me (bitch)
I'm bound to break the barricades babbling
A hundred thousand fucking savage apes

So welcome everybody to my bud's imagination
Where my heart sings blues
And drunken affirmations
The flowers in the pavement
Are there to salvage hip-hop
Crooked and loopy in the greenhouse
Like alfred hitchcock

Hundreds acting brainless
So something has to change, kids
Or else this axe is mine
Forever hunting on the rangers
I elevate the cause
While I celebrate the force
The words rotate the stress
And meditation bores

Hey yo, put 'em up, throw 'em up
Do your thing and grow the stuff
It's the words, now ya heard,
Repeat the name and know the suss
It's bliss 'n eso and they
Gobble our sound down
And get off the ground
And wobble around

Hey yo, put 'em up, throw 'em up
Everybody grows the stuff
It's the words, now ya heard,
Repeat the name and know the suss
It's bliss 'n eso and they
Gobble our sound down
And get the whole land to wobble around

When they make you a partner
I'm starting to not believe in this legion
'cause we be growing fresh words
And it's not leaving this region
We heard farm wide, stars collide
Ain't no finer carnival
The state that always scrape the hull
Free from rhyme or barnacles

On our vessel, prepared for voyage sea
Packin' on beef to serve me
Scurvy won't corrupt my buoyancy
And we arrived at the bash like migrants
And the reception was grand
'cause we re-hashed that vibrance
That they once had but lost
To a sea of starving cats
So the harvest was brought
By these three charming chaps

... the right cogs loose
To break free from that farm
And bring the right pro-duce
For this rappin' sitcom
A program laughter
T0 make you think it's good
But really it's just a toe jam cracker
And they feedin' you, it's like a
Flea market full of dumb shits (of dumb shit)
'cause we remarkable...

Hey yo, put 'em up, throw 'em up
Do your thing and grow the stuff
It's the words, now ya heard,
Repeat the name and know the suss
It's bliss 'n eso and they
Gobble our sound down
And get off the ground
And wobble around

Hey yo, put 'em up, throw 'em up
Everybody grows the stuff
It's the words, now ya heard,
Repeat the name and know the suss
It's bliss 'n eso and they
Gobble our sound down
And get the whole land to wobble around
(It's the greenhouse)

You're bound to get hooked
On the ink I bleed on my soul sketchbook
Accepted at the entrance
I paid without cash
Stared dragons in their eyes
And laid them out flat
Perverted poets watching the fairies fly
It's underground and stay in the trench
When the canary dies
It's eso, if you didn't know the king's name
And every time I fly
The colors of my wings change

Loud burpin', hanggliding
Cloud surfin', man I been here for years
You've just never looked
That furry feathered book
Holds my thoughts on voodoo sex
Do your thing, flew over
The motherfuckin' cuckoo's nest
Who you think it is? me
I cry colors, an only child
Who wishes he had five brothers

I'm up next, bitch
And I represent proudly
Born and raised in
The year of the rowdy
Allow me to let my dog loose
On your beach mouse
A monkey with a mic
In a mahogany treehouse
Read the sign, it says keep out
I keep it lit and blown
In the big bad greenhouse

Hey yo, put 'em up, throw 'em up
Do your thing and grow the stuff
It's the words, now ya heard,
Repeat the name and know the suss
It's bliss 'n eso and they
Gobble our sound down
And get off the ground
And wobble around

Hey yo, put 'em up, throw 'em up
Everybody grows the stuff
It's the words, now ya heard,
Repeat the name and know the suss
It's bliss 'n eso and they
Gobble our sound down
And get the whole land to wobble around

Man, at least I'm not lying
Tryin' to recoup the bait
Then buyin' the used loop you take
You're lying about the loop you make
You fallin' short of the hoop, you's fake
While my troop can make
Any shot we shoot and take
We keep it down to earth
Where grassroots don't break

And that's just the feelin'
These words will make
And all the flakin', make an offer
Is bringin' regurgitation
And it's filthy just thinkin'
About the hand one set
My words were spiccity-span
But my biggity hands
Still kept that penmanship

So though I wrote like three books
It's right on the news page
And uh, no we're not on street hooks
Our style is engaged
Not a stroke past midnight
And all through the club
Not a emcee stirred
Not even a rappin' thug

Just a clown being me
So jelly pumpin' see
Where do they go
They had to return that flow
To the rental company
Oh! so people, let loose
And wobble your frame
They say, where ya grow your words?
I tell 'em, boggle, the game

Hey yo, put 'em up, throw 'em up
Do your thing and grow the stuff
It's the words, now ya heard,
Repeat the name and know the suss
It's bliss 'n eso and they
Gobble our sound down
And get off the ground
And wobble around

Hey yo, put 'em up, throw 'em up
Everybody grows the stuff
It's the words, now ya heard,
Repeat the name and know the suss
It's bliss 'n eso and they
Gobble our sound down
And get the whole land to wobble around",http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blissneso/greenhouse.html
Headless Princess,Flowers in the Pavement,2004,"One breath
As I sit and smell the flowers, the berries, the very fern that will
Excrete this aroma as I sit at the ferry terminal
With the sky above, my eye moved towards it
I soaked up an image, freeze-framed the portrait
An instant, turned into an ocean of eternity
It's Vincent, filled with this emotion that is burning me
For what I saw before me needs no explanation
She just riveted my lungs, there was no exhalation
So many questions darted through my frozen, pondering mind
My interest had arisen from her fondling spines
And I must confess, that I am so impressed
With the way she strides and the way she sighs
And the way she glides with those dreamers eyes
It's more than just a term that lies between her thighs
And through these beer bottle flavours in my life
I see clear what can neighbour with my slice of bliss
The dormant evil that awaits in the grunge
Only to emerge after you have taken the plunge
And I don't understand how a serpent has a heart
While I'm just a man, a merchant with his cart
And all I wanna do is barter a mere couple of phrases
I admit this is the clear trouble with gazes
To decode this combination, she's the glitch in my system
From chaos to what is simple, it's the hitch of encryption
It's the pursuit of the chase, it's the fun of the catch
To find that beautiful face, that lies under the latch
When you unlock the mystery, below undercover
You see the simple beauty in just getting to know one another
It's like my motor, she can just soothe cool
But only a few fools, would ever risk it and look into those pupils
So I pluck my vocal chords, so I can sing to this butterfly
But I can't utter my thoughts, and they reverse to see her flutter by

Feel it in your chest, feel it in your heart
I need a place to lay, I need a place to start
If this ain't it, you've been lying all along
Cause the path you laid girl, it only made me strong
Cause I was once a seed that needed, loving from the seasons feeded
Off your stream that's bleedin' treason, now I'm a tree breathing freedom
On my bank but you burnt those bridges
So now I stare across at you pile of bitches

Bars, pubs, clubs
Freak-nicks, drenched in vampires blood
But wait, she looks like a nice girl, I'd like to meet her
She seems a little lost though, I'll try and reach her

""Nah, that's oblivious, don't get involved
She's known to hold the dice of life and let it roll""

Oh, I see, a bit of a gambler
I'll grab my cape and a bag of convo', I think I can handle her
There's stories that she owns a red light to tell the time
I'm ready to judge a book from the inside as well as mine
So excuse me miss, as rude as this is
I'd like you to take this tape I made, cause my crews on some shit
And we hit the coffee shop, she's singin' lullabies
We should probably stop, I don't wanna get played like those other guys
That's why this mix tape, is for you to borrow
And if you dig this shit here's my number, call me tomorrow
And as the sun fell, and the moon climbed
She went home, locked herself in her room, only to soon find
That music can manipulate your mind state
And if you use it as a wish it'll find ways
To blow out all the candles and know
How to handle your mind, hitch hiking near my place
Her night was a highlight, listening close was not what she'd usually do
Her ceiling was a skyline with a beautiful view
There's the vision and the truth from the booth
See girl I told you what this motherfucking music would do
The next day she was happy as hell
Skipping down the block, now she's back to herself
Anyone could naturally tell she's no longer trapped in a well
And the music in her mind, fool, had actually helped
But all it took was a taste
To see those ""get-money"" motherfuckers dangling dollars in her face
You punks don't know me or my eerie feel
I learnt rhythm from ghosts tapping on the steering wheel
Every car ride, was like a start
I've got, art in my heart
Girl and there seems to be no light left, my soul is on empty
I'm running out of love, I'm running out of mud
Send me another note, some energised words of wisdom
Let me go, to a place of isolated vision
But I'm steering this boat to uncharted lands
We need to understand, that one part of man
It three parts of the devil thinking why I can't make this boiling water settle
A dog alone in his kennel
Oh but wait, you see it's just a dead end
That headless princess could've been your fuckin best friend
Unsettled by the fact they don't see the good times
Blind as bats to the future they could find
But it never really does, cease to amaze me
Why I scream fuck swamp donkeys and peace to the ladies
Cause money is a hypnotist they're dazzled by the lavish shit
You wanna give me a blow job, I'll act like I have to piss
I'm no brick wall, you wanna leave, grab your shit
But don't come back in my life, like yo let's have a kiss
If only through my eyes you could see the shit
But you can't, oblivious, so go ahead beat it bitch


Alright now, this is the breakdown, here is the setting
Alive for 24 years and already forgetting
What it felt like to be, one-half of her and me
Until forcibly, I'll return to twenty-three
Never have met, I didn't ever expect
To have crept into a situation I never will let
Be something I've left when I leave, quiet as kept
While the sea parts, the beast starts to speak hearts
I see an artful approach to convey what I wrote
A thousand times, in my mind with the hope
That for once, people don't just come and go
Yeah, I know that I'm supposed
To fly away, in a sunset serenade
While tomorrow cherishes the memory of today
I stay hollow, this time my back wasn't exposed
To the passing of someone I never would know
I never would grow, despite the cost
And at the end of the day, I've come to love the loss
And on the off chance that she falls again
I'm walking backwards so she still knows who I am",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-headless-princess-lyrics
Hip Hop Blues,Flowers in the Pavement,2004,"Man I've been around the block and I've seen a lot of faces
Made a lot of friends and drunk a lot of cases oh my
We just take people up, so high, to find faith in the love
Welcome to the old pictured house on the hilltop
Midnight movies screen while my quill jots
A chilled spot, a foreign place just follow the user
His name is Norman Baits and he will seat you in my head
When I'm performing late and you can feel how I miss my girls warm embrace
This is a lonely road I can't ignore the fate cause
Only know I was born to make is hip hop freedom
Until the craving is over in a land of starving MCs and shady promoters
Hey Bliss raps for the country, yeah that's a nifty assumption
Well it is the green and gold yeah the fifties and hundreds
Its like were modern day rap slaves on a crap wage
But in the six pack with ten cats backstage sleeping on floors
Fast food sipping on bupple, economy class pimp bitch piss in a bottle
To read our name on a flyer, yeah I'm a crack the shits I need a magnifying glass
Yo this is backwards bliss like I'm a shit in the shower
And I'm a jump in the shitter, 'cause were the kids with the powers
But the runts of the litter
But now you cunts are just bitter 'cause we must crap gold nuggets
Yo they digging our shit that we made from no budget
But I'm still selling kicks stuffed in a cell cooped up
In them all but I keep tracking though hell for this

Hip hop movement
You there ain't no pit stops through
And it's a colourful world if you adapt to life
But can't feel you're real if it is black and white
Hip hop movement
You there ain't no pit stops through
And it's a colourful world if you adapt to life
But can't feel you're real if it is black and white

Yo yes it Esoterik and Bliss is an intelligent twist of life (it strikes) that fights hell with a kiss
Upper class always looks and gives me shit
'Cause I'm a white kid that bounces on a beat like Jimmy Cliff
Singing this, got me high like music was drug oh shit tell 'em why coz I do this for the love but there's no love
Cash will kill your marriages
You know I'm so chat to chill in chariots
But were broke and can't afford the fast life
So we flow like hover boards in half pipe
I think like I drink: until all the case drunk
In a cold world killing the Bedbugs
They live in a mansion I live in a shed but
When I spit it hits like an intimate head rub
So Grammy's for the gangsters playing the part
One love for my heirs that can savour the art
Cause when I write I rhyme like a day in the park and use
Mother natures rib cage as a harp and look forward to the future
Like Sydney in December and express
An experience like Jimmy on a bender
Avenger whole view of looking at shit
Aee things of fishermen with a hook in your lip
And this is Bliss n Esoterikizm, Suffa and Pressure
You put these motherfuckers together and nothing is fresher


Hip hop movement
You there ain't no pit stops through
And it's a colourful world if you adapt to life
But can't feel you're real if it is black and white
Hip hop movement
You there ain't no pit stops through
And it's a colourful world if you adapt to life
But can't feel you're real if it is black and white

It builds bliss when you're round us cause we built this from the ground up and it still hits
Like a town truck with a steal fist that hasn't found love
But when he does he remembers what its like to live in this world as one despite our differences
Change is here and the vision is ours within seconds the pavement was littered with flowers you know the rapping is shady
You know I mean she's so blow and your shits still only close to so, so
Oh no did I just feel the ?? and not conform to whatever the fuck you say hot is?
You're living off old school props, give it up fool you lost
Our spitting will hold you hostage for that gold your rock its bullshit ops meditate
Their Bliss n Esoterikizm fuckers get it straight


Maybe that'll teach his",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-hip-hop-blues-lyrics
I Love You But...,Flowers in the Pavement,2004," Tell 'em what they gotta do. What they gotta do?
 W-What?
 What do they gotta hear?
 I fucking don't know what I said, dude
 (Unintelligible)
 Yeah, are they gonna fucking hear it from me, mate?
 They're gonna hear it from you
 They're gonna hear it from me, dr. Eso on the mizzy-wizzy mic-o
 What are you gonna tell 'em?
 I'm gonna tell 'em to clean up their act. No, no, no, no, no, nothing like that. I love you, but I'm bored as shit",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-i-love-you-but-lyrics
Pigs in the Porn Trough,Flowers in the Pavement,2004,"Please no offense to the voluptuous Fräuleins
I'm using beer as lubrication
Haha, there you are looking greasy in my pig farm
Someone just fell in a puddle of mud!
I like it, I like it

You better tell a friend, or knock on someone's door
Cause Bliss n Eso came with that new song of porn
Bang boogie, here's the star
Better yet the duo!
But no no for you homos
Which means no go in my poo hole!

He said bim bam, boogie and a bottle of whisky
I just think damn! could she see that hobbling gypsy!
That told me to be a recluse a hermit with God
And make pornos with Miss Piggy and Kermit the frog

Well that's his job, and me? I've been expecting you
It was in this house of lies that I met the truth
Don't get Eso twisted, mud is a storm
Sex isn't a movie and love isn't porn!

Cinderella spin her fella into her pumpkin
I said surely your prefer your temple, it's the lost sunken city
Went up into mud, balling nice dirty lovers
And eight voluptuous freulines with two dirty buggers

Is this a simple invite to take off to the hills
And watch the moon make love with wolves (*howl*)
She pushes she pulls, she dribbles she drools
Laying back, blowing smoke, claiming my scribbles are cool

Yeah, I had her bent over the banister and handcuffed to the railings
She thought we were sailing but no baby I was waiting
With my spear stuck in deep, I want to poach this walrus
Damsels don't be distressed we're about to approach the chorus

Bump! Everybody let your knees buckle when you feel the thump
Of a thousand hungry lads that are all on the hunt
Girl let me see your panties kiss your ankles get it crunk
To the rhythm of Izm two cents and mud
Bump! Everybody let your knees buckle when you feel the thump
Of a thousand hungry lads that are all on the hunt
Girl let me see your panties kiss your ankles get it crunk
To the rhythm of Izm two cents and mud

Yeah felines shave your whiskers and call me cousin Vinnie
I can feel those V-holes buzzing under a dozen minny's
So I selected a maid, and said I'm uncanny tonight
May I court you and later see your vag fanny delights

He's right, it's uncanny and unorthodox what we do to them
But ladies daze and dreaming of pigs fly in unison
I've been waiting for this chance to talk
To show you how I boof like Santa Clause when my pants are off

Oh slow fucks, oh shucks, I'm inspired to think of brandy
Cause my dick went tired and limpy
Didn't wanna ruin the vibe like the fun had ended
But for her I was falling short, no pun intended

I don't know what to say to you make you laugh
Maybe we can shave each other's legs and take a bath
You see, I'm the grand entrance baby here's the plan:
I wanna snorkle dive in your bearded clam

Oh please I'm not concerned that your doid's feeling raggity
There are other places, my dear, I'll exploit every cavity
You may begin there, just for the moment and don't fiddle
And I'll enjoy ravaging you and watching your toes twiddle

See when Max kissed ya, you showed him where the axe hit ya
But for dessert I'm having a croc like Steve Irwin
I'm the reason there's so much yoghurt in your beef curtain
I teach love and just to get amongst your peach muffin

Bump! Everybody let your knees buckle when you feel the thump
Of a thousand hungry lads that are all on the hunt
Girl let me see your panties kiss your ankles get it crunk
To the rhythm of Izm two cents and mud
Bump! Everybody let your knees buckle when you feel the thump
Of a thousand hungry lads that are all on the hunt
Girl let me see your panties kiss your ankles get it crunk
To the rhythm of Izm two cents and mud

Bum, bum bum
You'd best believe that we're drunk, drunk drunk drunk
Can you agree that we hump, thump hump thump
We're getting free with a skunk drunk crunk bunk
Bum, bum bum
You'd best believe that we're drunk, drunk drunk drunk
Can you agree that we hump, thump hump thump
We're getting free with a skunk drunk crunk bunk

There's not a problem that I can't fix
Cause I can do it with my dick
And if these girls wanna rumble man I'll be there on the double
Like Rick, I won't be subtle when I put it in your twattle

From cue sticks to cubicles, I found you
You invited me in, you wanted the scoundral pounding your jewel
I get the jelly running, so I left a warm pool up in your belly button

You're my love, where have you been?
I've been slipping a micky in a snake called salary and a bitch called whiskey
But loving light in your eyes just like a street life escape
And when she smiles it keeps my peace pipe ablaze

Yo I'm drunk and tanned but I think the fumes have
Got me into the tripping zone with pink balloons
She blew me a kiss and left myself swang and sue
Then I saw a tootoo and a tootoo, I was dazed and confused

Ooh, take this as a smoke signal
Bliss n Eso terik choofing in the city
We're two cents under her gown
And big bad mud with one eye on her titty

I'm so gassed and blown off this whiskey and rum
My head was speaking to me
My dick was all twisted and numb
The bed was squeeking she was squealing and it's naughty bizarre
Dipping my quill into her ink we're like a Marky the saur

Bump! Everybody let your knees buckle when you feel the thump
Of a thousand hungry lads that are all on the hunt
Girl let me see your panties kiss your ankles get it crunk
To the rhythm of Izm two cents and mud
Bump! Everybody let your knees buckle when you feel the thump
Of a thousand hungry lads that are all on the hunt
Girl let me see your panties kiss your ankles get it crunk
To the rhythm of Izm two cents and mud

Me again, she been looking at me strangely
My bedroom's full of strobe lights, that bitch wants my baby!
She makes my knees buckle, we fuck all night
And we have stoned sex under the moonlight

Well she listens to how my rhyming pattern sings
I thought I met you upon Saturn's rings
I can still taste your juice under these stars
I'm tracking this caboose sipping moon shine from jars

Bump! Everybody let your knees buckle when you feel the thump
Of a thousand hungry lads that are all on the hunt
Girl let me see your panties kiss your ankles get it crunk
To the rhythm of Izm two cents and mud
Bump! Everybody let your knees buckle when you feel the thump
Of a thousand hungry lads that are all on the hunt
Girl let me see your panties kiss your ankles get it crunk
To the rhythm of Izm two cents and mud

I'm a pimp on the dance floor girl
You best believe it
You know, you meet us after a show
We taking care of the situation
We got bubble baths with electric blankets
Don't worry, it's okay
Hold on Kenny, hold on
Jesus I got a hard on from that",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-pigs-in-the-porn-trough-lyrics
Rubbed The Lamp The Wrong Way,Flowers in the Pavement,2004,"Ooh sing it
Cavemen dwell here
There's a circus in the sky
A place where dreamers dream
And we all can fly

Oh my
Yeah, that’s good, lets make a trip to the bottleshop
Gotta pop, knock knock
Would you like to wobble chop?
'Till the rythm hop
Give the women cock
‘til the kittens savour days of play
Major flavour hey

Oh oh dear God
Can you get the kitten wet
Can you leap with frogs
Can you look into the sky
'Cause it's written in blood
And the music in your mind 's
Unconditional love

I can hear destiny echo off my fear
Dreams whispering, just feel the beats of
I’m coming down, we’re just children having fun
Mics in the ground, If we build it they will come

To camp on the moon when the world's gold
And don’t ever Look back, my mic is stole  
Its cold but its great when Im wrestling tigers
And wild when I'm flying X-wing fighters

The mistress of mystics missed it
Did you let your lips blurr, twisted
Words that leak a lisp
In my garden plot plotting them pops
I Won't stop 'till the jukebox copping a crop

I’m still holdin’ it
With a fat wooden oar
Oh my I couldn't store
This in my belly anymore
Sick of mental cages, throw my telly at the door

I need some music to relax my mind
I need some music so I can recline
I need some music that can chill me out
I need some music I can think about

Everybody like the good rhythm, rip it
Everybody like the good living, live it
Everybody in the house here sure give up
To the people in the back and the front row
Everybody like the good rhythm, rip it
Everybody like the good living, live it
Everybody in the house give it up
To the crew Locked in that Looney bin HO

Lower the drawbridge to get over the Pub moat
And we don't sink 'cause we’re bailing the tug boat
And observing the perks like a wise owl
Throw off the stools in search of a slice bowel
You a nice girl at the top of the ferris wheel
Getting acquainted with the sun rays, it's rare
It's reeling in the feeling to the way you purr
But you won't be mowed in the way I stir the cauldron

Relax and grow in a cauldron’s water
All I want is to marry a sultans daughter
And be invisible when no one's looking
I'm an easy root touch my willy wood pecker

Damn straight I would like to tell you
I would like to get into you
You’re revvin my engine now you’re on my soul
But you stepped on a couple pennies in a mud hole

My feet barely touch when we drift on the sidewalk
Say, what big beautiful glass eyeballs
Step out the booth drenched in wet clothes
Waltz through the fuckin’ head of DJ bros
I got a head full of memories a head full of blues
I got a head full of chemistry a head full of booze
I got a head full of dick for obnoxious folk
I got a head full of I wanna go rock this boat

I need some music to relax my mind
I need some music so I can recline
I need some music that can chill me out
I need some music I can think about

I need some progress
Are we ready to roll, yes
Grab a piece of ass
Pass a piece of hash
Oh baby it's so fresh
Put your pedal to the metal in your shitbox ride
We got that bump, bounce, jump down
Get up and touch the sky

Forget this I'm not making my bed
I hate the motherfucking club, stop breaks your necks
I got hands in the air like whoop-e-dee-doo-dah
Intelligence hits when you look at it too hard

Ooh let's break free of this spell
People see when they yell
Sing to the song boy going straight into the convoy
Three stowaways

Everybody like the good rhythm, rip it
Everybody like the good living, live it
Everybody in the house here sure give up
To the people in the back and the front row
Everybody like the good rhythm, rip it
Everybody like the good living, live it
Everybody in the house give it up
To the crew locked in that looney bin HO

I need some music to relax my mind
I need some music so I can recline
I need some music that can chill me out
I need some music I can think about

Flowers in the pavement

There's many roads but there's only one you'll take
You never know when your gonna meet your fate
Face to face eye to eye
With the inner truth
So I spill my soul and swim in the booth

Yeh, I'm like a man with his thoughts on a
Lonely road. I stand and I fought now I,
Only know that these gun minds only want punch lines or gun minds
If you don't kick well then your most likely unsigned, (when I'm lieing)
Now you can tell me if your rhyming is
Live.
And you don't wanna live of it without a nine to five.
So why you strive
The sound underground
Just bring it naturally,
Like my eyes looking under gowns.
I use to label it but now learn it's evolving
I guess the tables have turned they're not just revolving.
Light it up
Hear the crackle
Bliss an' mud
Through the evil it's a drug
That sits in blood
Yo this is love.
That god only breaks the mold
Like that twist of bud
Reality only takes a strole
It can lift you up
Make you sore like that kite
You can drift with us,
Cut the cord with the knife.
Swimming in oblivion,
Above such evil.
It's amazing what we gotta go through to touch people
When I spit ears just prick up
I sip beers and hick-up
And rocking the same jeans for six years and it sucks

It's like I mean I dress in junes and my weapons too
Fuck that
Give me truth through these desables
The unforfilled talk of cash and power
Wait, the wine they're sipping is nothing but sour grapes.

There's many roads but there's only one you'll take
You never know when your gonna meet your fate
Face to face eye to eye
With the inner truth
What stuff do you put on when your in the booth
I'm super man I'm a killer
I'm a smoked out pimp
I'm trailer trash
I'm a gangsta with a fucked up blimp
An old geazer with a story to tell
I can hold a crowd
Yo I'm boring as hell.

I can feel you can feel it we can feel it for sure
I can feel the opportunity, knocking my door
I can feel you can feel it we can feel it for sure
I can feel the opportunity, knocking my door

Imagination of an eights year old
I feel you by my side
There's flowers in the pavement
To filter out the crime
And I'm an egg missle bitch
I build this house with rhymes
I coloured in my wings
And still drew out the lines
So don't take my love for granted
Untill you understand it
The day dreamer, dog lover
Wish, wonder bandit
I swear a day doesnt pass when I don't feel the pressure
I got a thousand keys,
But none reveal the treasure
Just a tital wave, an earthquake
And then the flood
Should have thought twice before you gave the pen to mud
Cause when you do,
Religions all calapse
And I free run through hell
With matchsticks and no maps
So go back
To your labaratory
Cause a cunt like me
Wants to marry at 40 and carry a 40
Down the wedding isle with pride
And have a bong in private
After I marry my bride
I'm happy as larry inside
But with the wieght of these waves
It's hard to carry the tide
And all an honest man can do
Is ask for a calery rise
I do live in this world and this cannot be right

So I mean when I see you, rolling through the cities
See ya pumping our tunes,
Hopping on the sneaky green
All I want is to raise my kids
Up in the bush
Everybody seem to be pulling to fuck it
I'll push

There's many roads but there's only one you'll take
You never know when your gonna meet your fate
Face to face eye to eye
With the inner truth
What stuff do you put on when your in the booth
I'm super man I'm a killer
I'm a smoked out pimp
I'm trailer trash
I'm a gangsta with a fucked up blimp
An old geazer with a story to tell
I can hold a crowd
Yo I'm boring as hell.

I can feel you can feel it we can feel it for sure
I can feel the opportunity, knocking my door
I can feel you can feel it we can feel it for sure
I can feel the opportunity, knocking my door

Supermarket Chick,Flowers in the Pavement,2004," Put a penny in the dollar chain
 I rap real well, especially 'cause the beat's fat
I found that fucking girl hanging near the meat rack
I said ""man, you're a supermarket chick, yo""
We'll spark the fucking... Twix
Ha, candy bar, any car
 I'm kinda lost in love, I need direction
Your pussy's cold, but I didn't find it in the freezer section
You've been sneezing, yes it's true
I wouldn't put you in the blue
I've been on streets for years, and you've been  my clues, ha
 Oh, your name's Molly? I'll give you-
Your name's Molly, I'll give you Molly's meal

The Tunnel of Love,Flowers in the Pavement,2004,"Check it out this is Eso right here were bringing it back to the essence
And all you Australian MC's I love you but I'm bored lets get it on

Welcome to my wonderful world of word wizardry
Where my verbs literally turn symphonies in to a place
Where the sun doesn't go (home)
The beast sweeps the streets for bundles of dough
In the middle of the jungle where these kids are in a huddle
Straight up pissin in a puddle keeping bitches out of bubble
Fell the rhythm of the struggle the vision isn't subtle
But living in the bubble keeps you distant from the trouble
I'm Choppin it like the captain of the saw mill droppin shit
Putting patterns in the corn fields
After this every town knows that Eso rocks up and pumps the merry-go-round smoke
I love boobs they cushion my hands
I love dogs so much I push them in prams
But freedom though the pencil is what floods my zone
And my pick-up line is take me drunk I'm home
That's right I drink and yell at the bar
But at home I have Tinkerbelle in a jar
I shepherd orphans though graveyard
Littered with vampires
My thoughts are ready to play card and piss on camp fires
A mans life is point blank with the beast I wrote it and ruled it
My joints stank up the streets they call me Max Mcfly
So damn your crystal ball
I've got a license to drive so suck your ass and jam that pistol pork

Shit
Were not trying to be cool or the cleverest kids
But it was probably this crew who drank the beverages
That's why writing time is designed for the whole calendar
Cause lyrically we killing it like Kilik from Soulcalibur
So come on people all aboard the night train first class pass direct to my brain
Wave and laugh at some of the funny people in my memories
And how an only child gained brother hood chemistry
I'm just a dreamer with a love for the taste
I keep it hardcore without a gun on my waist
I sit with Bliss and laugh while you're running that race
I'm just a young buck who grew up with mud on his face
So I spread love if you pass the time hearing this
Signing out is Eso, Mud and the glassy eyed lyricist

It Goes Bliss and Eso
Gallop though your metro
Dropping fresh shit what part you don't get bro?
One for the fun and Two for the crew and
Three for the world but we love those girls
It Goes Bliss and Eso
Gallop though your metro
Dropping fresh shit what part you don't get bro?
One for the fun and Two for the crew and
Three for the world but we love those girls

I clambered like the bandit with a band of mother fuckers
Having fun and booming in I mean booming in from the Looney bin
I can't hide from lies. I don't know if both eyes can go inside
But I feel better when these veterans of Leddison
The weather men like shitting in like Edison
There ever been some cleaver men with feather pens
For pleasure man endeavouring till we severin
Get to the swing and get to the bling, bling she got that right protocol
Make that pay and take me away I see the sight that Frodo saw
We keep it romantic by the fire and I call a star?
But I'm still a big boy making love up in you jar
Ohh no look what I've done she's calling me ignorant
Well I can not stop also stop being belligerent and their
Clapping and screaming notice some call
Platinum dreaming even though we are ahh the dope of the mall
So hoping its y'all fault cop on three?
We reach the mountain up in ball all that I see to keep them bouncing
It's like around the clock I'm lying with lines I'm lying in line I'm lying with alliances Forming and to find the sure thing
The kite is flying the cool string the kids hold this bold vital source wing
We'll chop down the scallywags wallowing rich
Amongst the diamonds I'm rough with my walloping stick
They say tempest out of the boots you stray?
Wondering wastelands looking for the true crusade
Cause the hippies go so what they take stems from my shit?
And we tippy toe over the lake with gems that have slipped
This far luster keeping these quick MC's on
Par buster in secrecy frequently in my star cluster hear a
Decency teaching me to seamlessly sequence these bar structure frequencies
And type to maybe they don't hear what I'm hollering (no they don't)
Which is not accessible at least shit get to caught up in my
Technical flow and it wreaks a ho though in affects it won't go so just snap out of it bro
And just go spit some grammar that gets some payment you know some dumb shit Under the banner of entertainment
Cause I'm sick of all winging about whose bluffing cause I will not wake these fools up and disconnect the schools button
No I will not
You hear what I'm saying
Will not

Don't Fuck around

Twisted Road,Flowers in the Pavement,2004,"B-E-I you couldn't define it
And even you did shit
You shouldn't have tried it
'Cause I'm telling you now
This rock in my hand
Will spell it out proud
And leave us all dwelling on clouds
Are you gonna peddle with peasants
Without your 
I don't think you've ever walked a road quite like this
So attractive, an abstract bitch
Gold and her mic, check her  that shit
Spill sunshine but the masses world wide
Still want rhymes without cash and 
To be a zombie for this industry's a piece of piss
You take that route 'cause it's easy shit
You sleezy prick, how dare you discriminate my shit, yes
Man, I'll teach you this
Thinking every girl in the world wants to see your dick
I'll paint you a seven headed beast with tits
That's when you on

And sing the song
 when I reach for clips
And bring it on
'Cause, see, I know my options
My presence in essence is the crow that watches
See these boulders 'round my shoulders
'Round my ankles is a ball and chain
I've listened to you rappers but you're all the same
That's why my balls are framed on the wall and named
(certificate of courage)

Life's like a twisted road
Shoes like a giant and a fist of 
Stereotypical MCs they piss us off
But that shit be old
So when you're walking down that twisted road
Find and buy a place 'cause the shit be cold
Headphones on and you're all alone
The B-E-I got you in the zone

Well I just love walking down this windy trail
With some fresh , griny 
So kindly snail, have 
(No they're still )
Well then search, you're talking
I'ma fuck the big rivers and their current flow
Is currently the currency become the COO, oh no


Like people, do you recognize the evil that surrounds us all
And every 
We got some meager beavers by the dam up brook
 gee whiz, crikey  'till the see this 
Just a little off a tangent
So try and keep up, like them cowboys to engines


So don't you play the game of fault
The mainstream ain't fresh with a grain of salt

Life's like a twisted road
Shoes like a giant and a fist of 
Stereotypical MCs they piss us off
But that shit be old
So when you're walking down that twisted road
Find and buy a place 'cause the shit be cold
Headphones on and you're all alone
The B-E-I got you in the zone

So everybody stand, let it be told
Your reason to be scared, let it be told
And if you feel the flow, let it be told
That everybody knows
Everybody grows

Vagina Ice,Flowers in the Pavement,2004,"Yeh... cold rain... outside
Under some tropical plants is my topical stance
To enhance your craniums

It's like 5 in the morning, sunrise
Cage full of birds one flies
I'ma tell you I'm beached on the sand where
Jeepers creepers with features that span
From head to toe, oh lead to know oh
How to move my lips when I met this (hubba-hubba)
Male with a fee first no money given
Just an ale by the sea surf, go sunny livin' so
Follow me now but don't be a slow poke
I'm in the pool again to let my flow soak
And my tools the pen so I can sew hope
Into these hooligans so dopes know
To reverse their words these chirpin' birds are writin'
It hurts the herds so curse the surge enlighten
Straight off the b-team bench
Oh my good goodness, look what these three clench
Yo it's Bliss N Eso found pulling cars
To listen to echoes down the boulevard
No radio we travel on whispers
I'm two feet old when I unravel my whiskers
So what's this shit their all Skippin' to
Go to check it out but it's nothin' different dude
Gotta come to grips with a grip a few have
But when Bliss write it mix like I hit a new ave
And I'm back to the paddock and I don't stop man
Call me an addict, well I know I am
After what doesn't make your sound a trend
It's the business takin me around the bend
The way the rims go windows sink and breathe
The wind blow, in flow Indonesia
Thinkin you're pimpin you just clog the creek
You shelve yourself when you turn obsolete, like that

Ring around the rosies
Pocket full of poetry that got you in the mood
Could ya, would ya love me if the other pocket
Had nothing else but love to prove
Ring around the rosies
Pocket full of poetry that got you in the mood
Could ya, would ya love me if the other pocket
Had nothing else but love to prove

I'm runnin through the field, free as a bird
And free lets see well that's me as a word
I roll with knowledge, I don't stroll I frolick
I piss in the devils face when I hold my bollocks
Can you picture me chillin' on the sun or moon
Using the galaxy as my rumpus room
Didn't know mother nature had a rump that's cute
If your neighbours can't hear this better bump the tune
This is somethin' new, you can spread your wings to it
Swing to it I'ma show you how the kings do it
Unity between you and me, sing to it
A blank piece of paper watch what I bring to it
Love, which will encourage your next visit
Mud, I'm a poetical sex wizard
Run, there's no doubt it's explicit
You've gotta get up to get down and get with it
Fuck reminiscing I'ma tell you 'bout my future
Me with some kids, chillin' with some buddah
And like the pictures in the book I'll be livin' in the bush
Mother nature with my kids we'll be giving them a push
And I'ma rest my feet in the kings bed where the queen gets her sleep
The only way that it's meant to be
I hope my woman and my young get the best of me
Cos I need a little love man, I need a little trust
I need a little bud man, I need a little us
Sometimes I need a little bit of rain
Just to take a little edge off the pain
Use my love (ha) to kill the blues
You got me thinkin' ferris wheels weren't built for two
Remember no one can fill your shoe
Read between the lines when I tilt the view
See me and the music, we misbehave
Sippin on cold drinks while we sit in the shade
Never ever dream to give it away
We tell stories to each other like we live in a cage
I get harsh, leave cowards in the wasteland
Put down your gun, the powers in the statement
We're the early birds spending hours in the basement

Watchdog Water Dragons,Flowers in the Pavement,2004,"With continuous ease
Our words form leaves, in deciduous trees
And they fall in slow motion down past Old Kent and Whitechappel
All the way to Parks, Lanes and fairs in may
I dare to say some even nudge up against your nephews left shoe
I watch him fetch too, it whispers and sketches of blue trees with green sheep
Now who believes dreams speak
What seemed bleak becomes noticeable
It gleams deep so we can cope with the dull
And these are my Watchdog Water Dragons
And I guess...

...that I'm just a jar drifting by the tide
And I hope that a star will lift me to reside
In the hands of a single soul that can relate
To these crawlings, my fingers cold, still relate
By the force, that draws the cogs in my clockwork
That lights my way through the fog in the hot dirt
In your youth you’re just blowing in the wind
And ya, see the truth and they throw you in a spin
Of this vicious cycle it won’t clean the stain
And I, think it’s vital I dont seem the same
When I, look in the mirror see the long hall bound
When I’m stumbling, crumbling and it all falls down
Like, do ya, feel the rythym and like
Will ya, still be living a lie
Will ya, kneel and listen to yourself
The only person that can peel the prison walls away
They all, fall to dust
And ya’ll are saying we can call it trust
And if we call it trust then now all of us
Can get down together and live tall and just
Cause I never plucked an eyelash, I only, wished it goodbye
I said I never plucked an eyelash, I only, wished this could fly
Into books, poems, stars bloom and movies
Theme park scenes, dark cartoons of scoobie
It soothes me, it’s all the same don’t confuse it
Bored to video games, create the music
Just use it
Children, thank you very much
I’m aware that you’re building a sanctuary up
Cause reality creates the sadness
We rely on these things to escape the madness
Like doing those “that I can tell by your stare”
Our common ground is that we’re both aware
My first tv murder the night in anti-poor
My hole into a closet of 1984
But when I wrote something lovely with my ink
I stopped being humpty dumpty on the brink
Of losing my balance I found it shit
It was a point man
The feeling I get when I'm alone but we join hands
Chilling out but I’m bound by a necklace
I don’t know but I get a little reckless
And if I don't make it to the end of the road
I don’t even know the weight that I will unload
I wish I could relapse another time
Turn back the tap discovered rhymes
Back and forth, forth and back
Ya’ll pulled me in but that cord went slack
 (x2)
Just me in my room writing rhymes
To listen when you barbeque outside or
Indoors jam-packed in the club
Going 60 in your car you can feel it in your blood

Let’s build a world of our own, so start to gather rocks
The shire’s known chatterbox
To build a home for unfathered kids
And guide the population cross the Harbour Bridge
The harvest is controlling, my Watchdog Water Dragons
I’ll never stop writing, that’s just a great author’s passion
To write a million books and not look back at one of them
And to notice when the children look
There’s something that the buildings took
From their natural purpose
And in a state like this, I can never be nervous
This is my house, my crib, my kingdom
Where the floorboards creak and the kids keep singing
We live each season just to give beats reason
Step into my house, all kids leave dreaming
Vanilla sky walking with a halo and some cannabis
My t-shirt reads “minorities in management”
And yeah that’s right, I’ll die for this habitat
Glide young poet, fly, bring the magic back
His nest is home, home is nest
I wanna rest my dome, I wanna hold your breast
And if the world would give me a chance and I could write on by
And fly just like a kite in the sky
See this matchstick, signifies my love
It won’t burn out it’ll only rise above
What a view from here, we survived the flood
Too many blind and deaf to hear the cries of doves
Anymore cause the parks been crushed by the buildings
And the view has been, replaced by a ceiling
Plus the carpark was a paradise, underneath
That ground won’t be free to breathe
So I ride on a dragon and my couch is a tiger
To stop the towns flooding and the houses on fire
But no that's not true reality's a bitch
Stuck in a catagory where your salary is shit
So, capture my love, whenever you feel it
They say that’s just mud, he doesn’t have feelings
Well I do and it’s true, I cover the canvas
Me in Strawberry Fields looking for answers
All I wanted was a mansion, for my mother
Fat houses all around the world, for my brothers

Studios in every basement and girls with wings

But in the evning you'll be seeing them drop

It's the weathermen reporting the sounds unknown

In the morning you will be seing a flock
But in the evning you'll be seeing them drop

At Midnight,Flying Colours,2008,"Midnight guitar strumming, being one with the moon
Laying down my lyrics, near a lovely lagoon
With a bucket of shrooms, and a staffy to pat
Mans best friend, yeah I'm happy with that
I wanna be happy, I bet that we all do
Ninety percent think they'll never afford to
What a shame what moneys done to the brain
Any country any colour everyone's in it's range
It's like (uh), but I dodge the missiles
So duck down motherfuckers hip-hop's the issue
I will not get played, like hansel and gretel
Do it for the dollar, or dance with the devil
You know why, cause I know how to fight back
And transform this mic stand into a spike bat
So with a smile on my dial I write raps
And hold down my ground till the empire strikes back
It's me, and I'm a tell you how I feel
I'm the real, I'll be flying with or without a deal
Can't tackle what you can't touch
It won't matter when you can't love
So imagine me at your window singing this song
With twenty eight thousand kids straight up singing along
So through basics eyes, I'll be blessing the beat
With a raw reputation like everly street, rest in peace

I won't be put down, I won't be shackled
I won't be held back, I won't be tackled
I won't be locked up, I won't be thrown out
Now that I know how to fly
Now that I know how to fly
I won't be put down, I won't be shackled
I won't be held back, I won't be tackled
I won't be locked up, I won't be thrown out
Now that I know how to fly
Now that I know how to fly

(Oh yeah, uh huh, it goes like this check it out, yo)
From the seas turn region I roam
On my tree trapeze, through the leaves I have flown
In stained glass skies, the evening unfolds
(In the dark) Stay sharp like a beak of the crow
I just creep on the low, through my secret window
Feel the niche and my mic plugs a leak in the boat
Never hit the mainstream in the creek where I row
Feel the wind in the willows from the breeze when it-
When it's freezing below, when I'm deep in the snow
Opened up my heart, brought heat to the cold
And I, won't follow sheep like a clone
In this, rat race they compete for the throne
Treat freedom of speech like a breach of the code
So I unleash and stampede the beat with a flow
Oh lord! All I want is peace for the globe
Yeah were so segregated, it's like each to their own
To my freaks and my peeps that I peep at the show
I'm a keep this brief, can you reach in your soul
Feel free with the seeds of the dreams that you grow
Till they eat what they speak and you reap what you sow
Left this message, like I heard a beep on the phone
*At night on a beach see my teepee aglow
Send smoke signals from the weed that we blow
Hear the bigger picture like what the bleep do we know, you know*

I won't be put down, I won't be shackled
I won't be held back, I won't be tackled
I won't be locked up, I won't be thrown out
Now that I know how to fly
Now that I know how to fly
I won't be put down, I won't be shackled
I won't be held back, I won't be tackled
I won't be locked up, I won't be thrown out
Now that I know how to fly
Now that I know how to fly

Bullet and a Target,Flying Colours,2008,"I believe that together we can really make a difference
One man cannot make a difference, but if we can partner
If we can have a collective will, and a willingness to make a difference in our nation
We can really do make a difference

What you have done, is put yourself between a bullet and a target
Won't be long, won't be long...

All it took was one in a trillion
In a world where they're gunning civilians
Where conspiracies just drop on us like plummeting buildings
Government villains at night, we are renegades who fight
Under a pilgrims plight for a better way of life
See we sail the seas with a sun stained atlas
To escape the day to day mental mundane madness
That consumes us, it's true, though my real answer lays
Is stepping back to view life's real grand Monet
But crucial issues are lost in this crazy worlds wealth
How can lust for bucks outweigh one baby girl's health?
Through the cyclone we hit the Third World and found heroes
With nothing but still everything, smiling at ground zero

What you've done here is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before you're pulling yourself away
What you've done here is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before you're pulling yourself away

So let the bullets in the air turn to raining rose petals
That covers the Earth's surface while the children throw pebbles
From dreams to themes, to a crack in the concrete
From a seed to a tree, I make it happen at God speed
Whatever happened to increase the peace
Fight the power for people to defeat the beast
Well its right here, its right now, it's anything I plan
It's a poem that proves a point, it's everything I am
So on a rainy day I made my way to the promised land and back
And now its safe to say in a crazy way, this song is where its at
Its equal verse what wasn't given, teachers verse the problem children
Evil verse the honest living, people verse the politicians

What you've done here is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before you're pulling yourself away
What you've done here is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before you're pulling yourself away

This is definite, like the sun will rise
Pure like the thought if I jump I'll fly
I am revolution, my path is belief
So how can they possibly stop what they can't even see
See they tax the poor, their evil got 'em coughing up
There's no real freedom under a legal modern mafia
Set the goal and unite, get cocked and take aim
The people are the power to make change, so make way

What you've done here is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before you're pulling yourself away
What you've done here is put yourself between a bullet and a target

Choof Choof Train,Flying Colours,2008,"Twenty six years of my life I never met her
Til a van on tour where I found that very treasure
Janky joints, moroccon special, carry on go forth, kingswoods, I'm puffin' on a gabatron blowtorch
Cooking up these cookies, bud is mashed into butter hash
Took a bite and laughed then I dashed to my hovercraft
That conductor cat on a sunny day rollercoaster
Feed the weed engine on my runaway locamotive
List of ben botanists speaking outta herbal stories
Stargaze from lack of booze, greenhouse observatory
Choofin through the hillside blowing doja wicked easy
Rider escapade with a stolen golden ticket
I just lounge by the billabong, sing a song with hella flavour
When I hit a bong I'm going to Willy Wonka's elevator
I'll see you later, I'm talking to Mary when I'm lost in a parked car off with the faries, so

All aboard the chooof choof train
Hit it left hit it right, brother use that flame (all aboard)
All aboard the choof choof train, turn it up in the speakers let the music bang (all aboard)
All aboard the choof choof train, toot toot mother f**ker Mary Jane's my name (all aboard)
All aboard the choof choof train
What you smokin' on brother?
That good shit man
Baseball bat blunts in ya face cunt
Yeah, baseball bat blunts, Mary Jane's a stripper
Macca's on the mic again rollin' up a rizler
Astronomical like the words that come out of me, blowing bongs off a burgundy balcony
It's virtual reality, my verse is a galaxy where birds on the canopy observe my whole family
In paradise, puffin purple profanity
Walshing through the worlds when burning one casually
Struttin' through the hood, like f**k it it's all good
It's that lumberjack macca cat cuttin' through the woods
So on the real ain't nothing liver than this, cause what I bring swings through on some spiderman shit
And when the wooden wheels turn, I arrive on a chariot
Stoned insecure, high but still happy bitch
I rhyme with the savages, blindfold the beat and sky dive with this cannabis
I think I can, I think I can, I think I can, I will
I think I can, I think I can, I know I've got the skill
I know I can, I know I can, I know it's gonna build
So let's ride this locomotive through the rivers and the hills, yo",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-choof-choof-train-lyrics
Climb These Cliffs,Flying Colours,2008,"I don't know why the sky is blue
I don't know why I write these tunes
But with a vibe like this, I'ma climb these cliffs
So I'll be there for you

Well, how you doin' bro
Sup man
Chillin', I'm cool
It's hot as hell
I'm thinking 'bout taking a dip in a pool
Fuckin' notes
I'm 'bout to hit the beach
And roll me a fattie
And grab a case of that cold shit
You know where to catch me

Welcome to the jungle by the beach where the sea sounds gorgeous
Three night owls been cooking in their treehouse fortress
With them fresh herbs bet the whole pound got blazed
Escape that nine to five perpetual groundhog day
We just glide off the runway charge tracks like Phar Lap
Smell another state when I step out on the tarmac
Convertible cruisers in a tropical summer
We don't have all the answers but we got one another
And these warm waters, have broken up my colder days
On a piece of driftwood, soaking up these solar rays
My god, this works to revert that old feeling
My own therapeutic version of the soul healing
My crib's cool, I chill and rhyme in my igloo
My music Mediterranean come dive in this big blue
Bohemian balcony Bliss been bent with absinthe
I stroll through my life like a Jim Henson Labyrinth
Walk with me

I don't know why the sky is blue
I don't know why I write these tunes
But with a vibe like this, I'ma climb these cliffs
So I'll be there for you
I don't know why the sky is blue
I don't know why I write these tunes
But with a vibe like this, I'ma climb these cliffs
So I'll be there for you

Hey yo, I'm fresh out the woodworks, carvin' a masterpiece
Painting a paradise of audio archery
The paper plane architect stoned on a house boat
Reporting live from my home in the South bro
Turn off your televisions walk with me, talk with me
Behold the elements palm trees and pelicans
So climb cliffs, when they place those bricks
Get up, hold your head up, and don't take no shit
'Cause today, I ain't got a worry in the world
I'm that local scrub rowing shorty with my girl
Middle finger in the air like throw a dog a bone
'Cause Macca ain’t an actor I'm a poet on a throne

And I'm a christmas fucking carol
I'm a lonely night on a beach
I'm a simple action
And I'm a complex brother
With motherfucking A.D.D
And I don't know why I roll like this
I don't know why my soul exists
And I don't know if I told you this
But you can bet your bottom dollar
Brother, I'll be there for you
I don't know why I roll like this
I don't know why my soul exists
And I don't know if I told you this
But you can bet your bottom dollar
Brother, I'll be there for you

I don't know why the sky is blue
I don't know why I write these tunes
But with a vibe like this, I'ma climb these cliffs
So I'll be there for you",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-climb-these-cliffs-lyrics
Destiny Lane,Flying Colours,2008,"Daddy, who lived down the end of Destiny Lane?
Son, two poets sit above the clouds down in Destiny Lane, you haven't heard of them yet, but you will

From a crooked cottage on the hill, I can see tomorrow's rain
Rumble through destiny, down a Sleepy Hollow lane
If we're all merely players in a play on this great stage
The problem is the script writers ain't on the same page
I echo through the mountain when I'm singing in the air
From my lab, a lad with lavish lyrics, living in his lair
I just write in my haven, set the challenge so to speak
Recite it to my raven like Edgar Allen Poe-try
I've been serving gems, with a thin swerving pen
Transcribe the world I see through a Tim Burton lens
To the grim certain end, these rebels stay proud
Hear the levels way loud at the Devil's playground
From my tower at sunset, I watch all the misled
Slow motion, human lemmings running to the cliff's edge
With this said, let's get free from their grasp
Cuz there's no path to peace ya'll, peace is the path
So I chill under the Arctic with my mellow cup of tea
And broadcast transmissions from my Yellow Submarine
I've been trekking this trail since the earth was born
I sail my Black Pearl through this world's Perfect Storm, it's like...

See every night through my eyes is a window
I watch life pass by like the wind blows
And when I turn from my mirror that's my intro
To step into this life with my mic and some inspo-
-Ration, please forgive me for my sins though
When I'm alone in the dark left in Limbo
I light a thought like a spark to my indo
Forever put it down for my art and my kinfolk

Daddy, who lives down the end of Destiny Lane?
Son, two poets sit above the clouds down in Destiny Lane

I'm a field full of flowers, I'ma bring it back by dinner
I'm the skill, I'm the power, I'm a silverback gorilla
You still a caterpillar, thinking your killer raps are iller
So while you beef I'm fishing, writing, chilling by the river
So let me introduce you to my castle of calligraphy
The lights are on, we're all at home, we march to a new symphony
That Mad Hatter of that motion music
Whose liquid lyricism leaves the oceans moonlit
So my pirate ship can set sail through the
Sun (sun), rain (rain), snow or hail
Cuz there's something 'bout to happen like there's something in the wind
On a quest without a vest like I'm Huckleberry Finn
So call me that book with a spectacular twist
Cuz even Hogwarts ain't seen magic like this
See I'm that author in the attic that'll liberate the mind
With a bird's-eye view trying to illustrate time, I was born ready

See every night through my eyes is a window
I watch life pass by like the wind blows
And when I turn from my mirror that's my intro
To step into this life with my mic and some inspo-
-Ration, please forgive me for my sins though
When I'm alone in the dark left in Limbo
I light a thought like a spark to my indo
Forever put it down for my art and my kinfolk

""The next scripture will be read by none other than the big Macca-licious""
""I have served a 7 foot thousand wave to be here this evening to greet you with the thoughts of a cosmic cowboy who will travel the land to spank the monkey in front of the queen's face while watching television in the debate to tell you that that is brain washing...
Bullshit back at it, it's big Macca...""",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-destiny-lane-lyrics
Eye Of The Storm,Flying Colours,2008,"Yeah, check it out
This is how this shit goes right here

You see time stops still in the eye of the storm
The foundation of my home where my rhyming was born
It’s a rhythmic reality, a remedy through riddles
Where loves a hurricane and you meet me in the middle
It’s the good, the bad, the house I furnish
The crystal clear sea, the sound I worship
The rush of the city, the calm of the outback
The film called life where my heart is the soundtrack
It's that lucky streak, without no warning
It's the memory of cartoons on Saturday morning
It's that classic culture that connects the country
Through raw energy that reflects we're hungry
It's that timeless feeling that I get on stage
It's those government bills that I'll never pay
It's that fun I have freestyling with my mates
My little getaway that only music can create, c'mon

Gotta say mmm
Beautiful day
Mmm, mmm
Gotta say mmm
Beautiful day
Beautiful day - beautiful day
Gotta say mmm
Yo, check it (Gotta say ...)

You see time stops still in the eye of the storm
The foundation of my home where my rhyming was born
It’s a rhythmic reality, a remedy through riddles
Where loves a hurricane and they meet me in the middle
It's the exotic breeze at the festival night show
That hot sweaty air with the twist of that hydro
It's the power of my passion, the picture my pen paints
Caressing the canvas to put my clique in a zen state
It's that zone with my thought, the peace when it's starlit
That blazing fireplace, bare feet on the carpet
Or sitting on my porch where this one sways freely
And right through the night until the sun rays greets me
It's the past love still cooking inside
It's that warm fuzzy feeling when I look in her eyes
It's pouring out my heart and soul when I'm flipping the gems
It's catching my dreams lost in Pulp Fiction again, it's like...

I'll tell you what gets me by and gets me high, yeah
It's watching flicks with my chick making love on the sofa
It's the bread that I can afford to chuck in the toaster
It's the real (hip-hop) that nothing comes close to
It's finally getting Bliss to puff on the dohja

Yeah
On more than one occasion we're sure to come and blaze one
When it's heavy, hit the hay at home, my horizontal haven
It's that echo through eternity that still hits live
It's life, a beautiful journey on a Bill Hicks ride

It's the chemistry, the brightest light, the 8th wonder
The recipe of dynamite and Blade Runner
It's the truth (the truth) that justifies this
It's the father I have and the mother I miss

It's the love through my pencil when I feel the beat
It's 40,000 going mental on St Kilda beach
It's three kids in a club down a alley that were sounding ill
To march on through the Valley of a Thousand Hills

Gotta say, mmm
Beautiful day - beautiful day
Beautiful day - beautiful - beautiful day (To march on through the Valley of a Thousand Hills)
Beautiful day - beautiful day
Beautiful day - beautiful - beautiful day (To march on through the Valley of a Thousand Hills)
Gotta say, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Beautiful day - beautiful day
Mmm, mmm
Beautiful day - beautiful - beautiful day
Gotta say, mmm
Mmm, mmm

Field of Dreams,Flying Colours,2008,"So I guess I gotta...
Guess I gotta, guess I gotta, guess I gotta...

Yo, eyo, I spit like an M16, I let them all know they can have it
That flash of magic, with an imagination to match it
So catch it, it's classic, but it will not be contained
In an industry man made, 'cause it runs through my veins
It pumps through my brain, through my name, nothing will change
Don't make me huff and puff and turn this fucker to flames
But enough of the games, my shadow is a tidal wave
My idle, there's a brighter way, fight for it night and day
I've built fires inspired to keep my hands warm
I've hopped through hurricanes, and step-stepped through sandstorms
I've climbed cliffs, you can see what I'm dreaming
Even walked on water, just to be here this evening
So, here we go again, I gotta prove I'm no magician to you
Rabbit in a hat, rappers that's clueless how I kick it
This is blood, sweat and tears, flesh and bone a better way
A brotherhood of hope, with a megaphone at heavens gate

Shoot me down, raise my head
Walk my field of dreams instead
'Cause there's no way, you will march on top of me
Not how this is going to be
Lift my feet, raise my head
Love and sweat and tears I've bled
Create the path I see ahead

Well, he's still kickin' it so beautifully, bet he's re-writing the odds
'Cause he knows it's not the dog in the fight, but the fight in the dog
See, the kid couldn't spell for shit but could draw like a photograph
Fuck a hit, he rather his rhyme on the wall of a poet's class
He dicks with a phonograph, caught a flow and wrote the flavour
That archaeologist, artist’s audio appropriator
Ghost rider, flaming chopper, carresing the night
And chasing the glimpse of a forever fading fluorescent horizon
He just lights up the skies (lights up the skies) while running through this circus
With the heart full of good vibes (heart full of good vibes) that's pumping through his circuits
Live wire, high flyer, spit fire out his lungs
Soars a war-torn Mustang, through an empire of the sun
Catch him diving in his rhythm, rhyme and gliding in his vision
Manifest music momentos to remind him of his mission
He just rolls like a bowler, a soldiers forward composure
With a butterfly net full of dreams hangin' over his shoulder he says..

Shoot me down, raise my head
Walk my field of dreams instead
'Cause there's no way, you will march on top of me

Gorilla Militia,Flying Colours,2008,"Aw yeah, just gettin' warmed up in here
I'ma lay it down like this, yo

We didn't rush shit, kick back and bubbled slow
Didn't suck dick, hit gas and rumbled roads
Now, can you hear this magic grumble bro?
We move like the drums, tic-tac and bumped a toe
Spit facts with swift raps untouchable
With syntax to bitch slap a slumber (ho)
With impact to hit past a Hubble probe
Spin back to flip massive summer shows (one, two, three, four!)
Ill tunes, trip acid undertones
Filled rooms that sit past the country's coast
What if after this batch the bubble blows?
Lord knows where the chit-chat and mumble's stowed
Thrust in the ringmaster's Thunderdome
Sniff crack with big cats with Wonder Dough
But through all the mish-mash, I wonder, bro
With that shit, I predict tragic troubles so
I bring it back to this patch and drummers know
Make peace to whiplash a punter's dome
And pitch black with knick-knacks, I fumble flow
To fit tracks and this cracks the puzzle's code
And in fact, since slick chaps have bummed me clothes
We're trailblazin' a lit path by jungle's glow
So with a spliff packed with crumble drow
I sit back in the Bliss bachelor bungalow

Direct from the shit shack at Lover's Grove
I sit back with a six-pack and punch a cone
'Cause this lad will bring back a bucket-load
Of raw thick hash and zigzags on buffaloes
I twist raps, I flip raps, you fuckin' know
So kick back, Big Macka's comin' home
No rich rags, I kick back so it's touch and go (one, two, three, four)
So splish splash, click clack, let's bust a flow

""Aw yeah""

Yo, when I start to get busy, I'm off from Sin City
There's no turning back once Macka's on the track
I'm like Jack Frost with a heatwave of new shit (one, two, three, four)
So back off as I reclaim this music
Yo, I'ma tell it how it is
This is B.E.I. and I ain't sellin' out for shit, so
Now you know who spits the raw sound
And taught these kids how to kick the door down
Arrows in the air, run for cover
This world loves hatin' as the young may suffer
It's like there's a huge hunt for butter
But, funny thing is we end up trying to hunt each other
Stop shooting

""Crank this bitch""",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-gorilla-militia-lyrics
Happy In My Hoody,Flying Colours,2008,"Direct from the Secret Garden, next to my hovering castle
I break it down fresh like the crunch of an apple
Shit, so just plug in my channel
It's that nutty motherfucker with a bundle of cashews
In his head, I just sled, as the jungle unravels
With my satchel, my lasso, I jumped on my camel
Set forth with my pallet and my colouring pastels
Jonathan Swift-ly writing his Gulliver's Travels
At the Bliss brewery, guzzle a bubbling glass full
Went under my chateau, where I hung up my shadow
From the mantle, free from the government shackles
I can handle anything the governor tackles
They have grappled deep with these troublesome vandals
You can catch me in my hoodie when I come to the battle
In my crooked canoe, pick the puddle to paddle
Still a wonderful chap, who tipped the slumbering cattle

I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
If you ain't fucking with us then you ain't going my way
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
With caps and kicks, pack the spliff full of high grade
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
And I can't see you if you coming at me sideways
Bitch

""Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
Welcome to something you've never seen before.""

It's the rainy days vs the endless summer
The place she made, God bless my mother
It's the laws they make, the laws I break
The highs, the lows, the windy roads
The knowledge in rhyme, versus the bullets in your pistols
The dollars they dive for, the pusher with a Pit Bull
The too cool for school, but never under pressure
The rebel with a cause, who's ready for whatever
So catch me in my hoodie, flipping off the pigs
Don't come around here, there's no shitting where I live
My whole platoon reps one love daily
Mad like Stewie yelling, ""Fuck you, pay me"" (Got my money?)
On the double 'cause I'm trouble if you don't
Motherfucker there's no muzzle on my nose
I'ma bite back, you like that (Hell yeah, kick it Macka)
I don't need a bike rack, I ride that shitty tractor

I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
If you ain't fucking with us then you ain't going my way
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
With caps and kicks, pack the spliff full of high grade
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
And I can't see you if you coming at me sideways
Bitch

Cats love it 'cause the flow look hot
Like the body of a coupé with a cream drop top
Let's go, readjust, kids strap your belts
Let's take a little ride to the wishing well
That well which inside my wish had fell
Where this wretched witch then cast a spell
And she must've used herbs like twice as strong
'Cause it made me want to smoke like Cheech and Chong
Right or wrong, I was hooked, I had found my calling
I couldn't get enough of this downwards falling
It's not to say the sound on earth is boring
But I knew the underground was worth exploring
So I packed my bags and I grabbed my swag
And I haven't been back since then, since then
You can catch me in my hoodie on a Friday
Getting pissy with the lads on the highway
Blazing one to Frank Sinatra, did it my way
I can't believe we're getting paid for getting sideways

Kiddies, please block your ears
This next guy gets a bit noisy

Where my dingoes at, we out to trample the track
Hyjak: The straw that broke the camel's back
Got my whole career in shambles but I'm handling that
Watch you leave in an ambulance and we sampling that
{Ambulance Siren} That's the sound of the city
We chop ounces of sticky, 
ride round like Mr. Whippy
Catch me in my hoodie getting blazed again
Run out of weed, I smoke the sleeve of some made of hemp
I gotta pay the rent, you mafuckers should know
Don't make me beat you down with a phone like Russell Crowe
I flip a couple of shows, hustle a bundle of smoke
Watch the bills crumble and chuckle like, ""Oh
Shit, I'm rich"" Feels so important
Till I wake the next day, it's gone by the morning
Raw like Michael Moore, got the government strung out
I kicked a rhyme about Howard, he got kicked the fuck out

I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
If you ain't fucking with us then you ain't going my way
I feel happy in my hoodie on a Friday
With caps and kicks, pack the spliff full of high grade

Lonely Streets,Flying Colours,2008,"I walk the lonely streets I watch the people passing by I used to watch the falling rain and listen to the sleeper say
Every single word here now is coming right from my heartless heart and I... I've never felt like this before this feeling

I'm pure with my passion impossible to predict
My mind is a mention my heart is a gift
The world doesn't owe you shit you owe the world everything
From the magic on this mic to there fake diamond rings
I create rhyming sing to get me were I am
Turn your headlights on this heaven where I stand
An adventure with the Sandpeople to push
The purity kindly conduct this biz beautifully
They tell us to sit down my people they'll stand up
'Cause yes bro Eso is Houdini in handcuffs
Sunrise moonshine another day lives a little
Reminder from god your money ain't shit
And that my ideas are bullet proof my teams in the house
My hope can't be hung, my dreams can't be drowned
Man makes money, money doesn't make man
Monkey see, monkey do, this monkey's got the upper hand (rejoice)

I walk the lonely streets I watch the people passing by I used to watch the falling rain and listen to the sleeper sayy...

Mother help me it's happened to my brain again
The beat plays and the flames descend
So I become Sapient being to be at peace with my monsters
The swords from the stone, I'm the king of my genre
Yeah, I know I'm so bro bardic
Dependant on machines to grow does product
Making little seeds that'll die or stem out making your head north west bound
We've all made sacrifices like money and physical health
But I'm not ringing the bell, I'm stitching my belt up
When the bullshit blows I've never sold my soul
So there's a chance that I won't up in hell thus far
But I know that things change and I'll convince the devil to free my soul from this instrumental, in my home land security over heats
I'll be over sea smoking weed with Izm, Bliss and Eso

Every single word here now is coming right from my heartless heart I've never felt like this before this feeling

Yeah, I've been feeling all right keeping the quiet
Is kept to approach knowing that these crews are the next to blow
Up right stand on my own two feet we touch mics and demand that you focus please
Feeling fortunate learning that Portland is where the hemispheres converge on these coordinates I can gorge this shit yeah of course where sick, one listen will have you worshiping porcelin
I've bin more than a dreeg that feats you the knowledge that I gained when 
I ate from the trees fruit
, and now I pass it along become a passionate man that puts cash in his palm bringing action to plans and my back getting strong feeling like Atlas and my fam is a faction relong on the tip of your tongue I spit for the drums while the bassers on a rampage that's only begun

I walk the lonely streets I watch the people passing by I used to watch the falling rain and listen to the sleeper sayy...

We gotta stop living for I and start living for we
'Cause we all ball on this ball together spinning so free
I sing in the breeze but they won't stay to listen
'Cause individually they think we don't make a difference
Time to blow and break the business put the system into spin
I'm that midnight vagabond whose drifting in the wind
Who just listens with a grin through chaos that mans facing
I'm speaking clearly but it's like it's lost in translation
'Cause out the pavement we dried the orchids
From the ground and blazed with these mines in orbit
Yeah we find in Portland that kids are free the youth
Poetical polecs painting in an inconvinient truth
I'm that mind sleep walker travelling hellish dreams
Bridging a playfull ego and battered self esteem
Whether it's a joke or hot whether it's dope or not
You want stop what's popping out of my vocal box, it's like that",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-lonely-streets-lyrics

I'm reloaded!

Calling all guards to catch the chaps at large
You pack the bong brother? Changing of the Avant-garde
You cats on charge?
Well I ask you can I kick it?
Well that's the magic ticket

I'm the usher in the theatre, Screenin' Jack Slater
It's my never ending story that creates my fantasia
Poetical landscaper who bakes the mad flavours
Puff the magic on my rough track and hey
It's my damn nature
Pu- Puffin the herb
Ohhhh Lord this is track murder
Hit the town with 73  in my backburner

I hold my lightsaber swinging through the skyscrapers
Feel the gorgeous air travel to my fortress lair

I project my words on the canvas of the promised land
Picture this hollowman standing as a hologram

Yo! I teach monkeys how to wrestle
In a spandex suit
Then send them to steal Roger Ramjets boots
A circle of psychos, I hang with the realest
To shoot shit with a gang of gorillas
They call me Mad Max a million
The abstract chamelion
Who gets his hustle on in a jam packed pavillion
I'm sunlight for those, who live in the dark
So let me grab the bat and send this bitch out the park
Yeah
I'm the mack with no money
Still livin it up like mr happy go lucky
Every kid wants to fly
Every dog has his day
So everything I write is another wall that I break
Duck down, when I'm coming through the door
Jugglin chainsaws and running from the law
It's a bird, It's a plane, nah it's me when I ride
Flippin off you motherfucka's on my BMX bike

Straight start slangin out the back of my lunar rover

That parachute lagoon diver
Air balloon glider
It's Shako, the twelve monkey time transporter
Audio, NVA the rhyme transformer

I take world famous models to an all you can eat
Rib House then back to mine to slaughter the meat
I'm an audio freak and by a quater to three
You'll get a hum dum dinger when you order from me
I made a porno for free, at Oporto's with three
Midget bitches call me audio thief

He's verbally violent like Oprah's vagina

Never give up for your day will come
Through life is hard in this day
Never give up for your day will come
Through life is hard in this day
Never give up for your day will come
Ey yo we march to the melody
Ey yo we march to the melody

Yo, Ey yo we march to the melody
Preach to the percussion
Charged by a chemistry deep within our gut
And I'm a mad bright mag light bridging the gap
Soul swimming in sun rays bringing it back
See there's AK747's in the sky
But I'm still free guilty of never saying good bye
That's why I sit on the sun and watch the storm
They won't clip my wings I will not conform
Cuz this empire was built by generation X
Every brick placed perfect together on a quest
To simply find one heaven on earth
And touch the untouchable and every verse
And sky dive with webbed armpits to make a difference
Coz my life is worth more than any business
Music is my kingdom
Rhythm's my army
Life's a doing word and we link through a heartbeat
Through life is hard in this day
Never give up for your day will come

Lord ang'na bay i-aw'th yami ing'shiyile
(Lord there is nothing I can say, my friend passed away)
All I can say ukuthi lala ngoxolo
(All I can say is rest in peace)
Lord I realise there's no me without you
Insuku sezihambile nemini isidlulile kufa umthithile

Kuphenduk' inyembezi kukhalwe isililo

Through life is hard in this day
Never give up for your day will come

In the wilderness of greed we slog for the boss
Caught between being free and when I clock on and off
But that negative realm I leave cuz I'm constantly lost
And ride a magic carpet weaved out off positive thoughts
Dance in the deep end certainly tossing in mix
Until we chase our dreams and beat adversity off with a stick
Travel a trail of grass roots and cross the seas blue
A road that touches the souls of those who walk in these shoes
With the fight of a gladiator I write on my pad and paper
With Max on my bright life Flight of the Navigator
I trot through time canter where the path's leading
Work hard and use my head to hammer through the glass ceiling
And dreams run through the villages to the mean slums
How can people have no food but got machine guns?
We don't have equality but got the same skills to bloom
Some eat with dirty hands some hand fed with silver spoons

Never give up for your day will come",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-never-give-up-lyrics
Never Give Up,Flying Colours,2008,"From the streets of San Diego to the slums of Echo Park
Broke down and homeless is where I got my start
I bounced around for years doing this and that
But now I'm doing good and I'm never looking back

I began with nothing, I still ain't got much
When life got me down I had to be tough
From the age of 14 I was on my own
No one would do it for me so I did it alone

Shelter to shelter and jail to jail
I'm here to tell you right now that I will not fail
I wish my old friends could see me now
Because they never would believe what I am doing now

I never gave up

Right now I'm where I want to be
Maybe not for you, but it's good enough for me
Don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings
All I wanna do is get on stage and sing

My dream is today and I'm doing it strong
No matter what the odds, I will still push on
I will do it for the poor who have no voice
And for all of the victims who had no choice

I will do it for the weak who cannot fight
For those who were wronged I will make things right
It's been an uphill battle, my fingers have bled
But I'm almost there and I am far from dead

I never gave up

When I came to the city of Hollywood I was broke down and beat
I slept behind dumpsters on the side of the street
There's one thing that always got me through
The one thing I always held true is that I never gave up
I'm never gonna give up",http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blissneso/nevergiveup.html
Royal Flush,Flying Colours,2008,"GARRY!
How ya doin' Bob?
That fucking cunt!
He was at me house last night!
I think I saw him at the cheese factory
He's kind of like skinny but muscular
I don't even know his name
Shut your mouth bitch

Well hello, let me introduce myself, they call me
Macka, Big Macka
And my voice-activated house doesn't even work
But I'm back in the lab again making something out of dirt
I got a spliff in my top pocket, I got a cannon
The size of something you can't possibly imagine
I jump off boats, I cut through hills and gutters
I bluff the whole table like fuck you, silly duffers

We changed the game like when the first boat came with cocaine
Paved our way with gold flame, flows aim to blow brains
(With cards up my sleeve I play old maid with dope dames)
Undercover secret agent, code name is Coltrane
In a dusty jazz bar is 00 deuce with 008
The two 008 troublesome two
With a robo-tech DJ I'm cued across the fader
To the crew who drops the flavour, three smooth operators

(Just like that...)
(Just like that...)
(Unfortunately, we haven't time to play games...)

008
Yes 00 deuce?
Have you got your trusty set of monkey wrenches?
It's in my purple bag
Great, you stick them up for the gummy bears, and I'll take care of the sniper on the roof
Okay, you take this puzzle, there's no answer

With my researchers, I do sidewalk astronomy
We burn the weed in seconds, I'm just chillin' in my building
With a verdun street collective, see, we struck a major chord
With the magic from the stage, I soar, doubt nevermore
The raven's rapping at your chamber door
So praise the lord and see unusually different
Beautifully gifted sailing forth, mad musical misfits
Me, myself and my melody mistress make a monster meek
With magic in misty mountains where the mace and mobsters meet

They call me
Cosmic cowboy, Kookaburra killer
Max back on the track, yes I'm iller
And the last emcee I barbecued on my grilla
Yes, for rilla, yes, for rilla
So back the fuck off me and go and make me coffee
You rappers think you're Rocky but not one of you can stop me
That's why I puff opium with Christopher Walken
In an Amsterdam cafe at six in the mornin'
I'm kickin' the door in, you bitches are boring
I'm bringing the storm in cause you chickens are snoring
(Can you vision me soaring in this blizzard performing
And paint crosswords like clockwork in glistening orange)

(Just like that...)
(Just like that...)
(Unfortunately, we haven't time to play games...)

Heeey, I saw you put that ace up your sleeve honky
You gonna cheat me out of my money?
Hoco, loco, lets bounce on these honkies

I'm at the gambling spot with my hand on my cock
Lookin' for another block I can damage and rock
I'm surfin' with fishes, I'm pervin' on bitches
My mission on this bus is to get dirt on them minges
(When news framed troops came for Hussein's fuel chain
They say dollars make cents but all I got is loose change
Shoot game, I'm that wild cat through the hoop's flames
Till doomsday, it's Bruce Wayne on a crusade)

I'm the king of the committee, watch me think of something witty
Like a boring board meeting and I slip myself a mickey
Don't eyeball me, bitch, my clique is the goonies
My guard dogs are hard rock, bitch, with an Uzi
(Through the world wind we pass batons, swinging it like a magic wand
Poetical patterns like pebbles perpetually skipping across that placid pond
Are you catching on? Let me give you a key
True love is not a cage, it's a home in which you are free)

I would like to talk to you tonight
You see I am a guide from another galaxy in time
And if you sprinkle what I give you over your golden eyes
Then you will lift up and rise above, and fly the night sky

I grew wings, yo' I grew wings within a matter of minutes
The rainbow feathered mad hatter of lyrics
Trying to find freedom and manage a business
Searching for sunlight, trapped in a blizzard
It's like dungeons and dragons with M.C. Escher eyes
Dance in my dust storm, rent free enterprise
So let my emphasise the fact
I'm a Jet Li chess piece bending rhymes back
To its original position
So every track is an imperial dominion
I kick flip words in a Cancun cottage
And ride my flying fox over a bamboo forest
Now that's enjoying the high
Straight from the mouth of a boy who can fly
You can't hold me back all these housing tenements
'Cause we're reigning heavy like a thousand elephants
So welcome everybody to my caravan of courage
The Aussie Jack Sparrow, not a parrot talking rubbish
On my way back from the Degobah system
Writing rhymes to my heavy hearts rhythm
Listen, I don't chase the charts, I make it last
And pedal my bike through blazing blades of grass
I'm that missing brick in the wall
That frees the butterflies so you can see the other side

""It's not gonna stop, it's never gonna stop!""
""I would like to talk to you tonight""
""I'm fucking flying...I'm fucking flying!!""
You see I am a guide from another galaxy in time
And if you sprinkle what I give you over your golden eyes
Then you will lift up and rise above, and fly the night sky""

At dusk I glide in flight through the violet light
Soak up the sweet symphony of the silent night
Venture through Vegas valley, vibe with these vets
A calm and kingdom collage where cats collide on the clef
Catch crazy colourful characters creeping in the canvas
I'm just swimming with the mermaids staying deep within Atlantis
It's that primo novelist action hero audience
Extraordinary gentlemen in Captain Nemo's Nautilus
I carry the flame over unravelling planes
Transit into transparent time travelling trains
Stroll through 1984 with the cameras on
That ever growing snowball in this Animal Farm
Roam the night golf course in electrical storms
Swinging the 3-iron fighting whole sentinel swarms
'Til my pencil is worn and I'm etching to the sound
Gallop fast on rolling meadows that are stretching to the clouds
With a battle axe, Shadowfax, swinging through Helm's Deep
A nightmare like the whole world living on Elm St
With a dodgy old economy when caught in this monopoly
It's the automatic airborne audio anomaly
Dropping these philosophies paint the face properly
Bliss n Eso's 2008 Space Odyssey
In a world run by digits with a glitch in The Matrix
'Cause we're all in the same boat but we're missing the mateship

The Sea is Rising,Flying Colours,2008,"And all I know is the sun is shining
Yet we fight on through the night
While the 'burgs are melting and the sea is rising
I don't know so I ask them why

Yeah, why are they refusing to listen? Why are these troops on a mission?
And why are they shooting these victims over their view on religion?
Yeah why do we all search for love like we got cupids addiction?
Why with politicians you can't tell the truth from the fiction?
Why do we pollute where we're living? Why are these youth put at risk and
Why is this ruling dominion kept us consumed in this prison? Nah, nah, nah
I won't jump through the hoops of this system
Nothing stands between you and the pursuit of your vision
I grab a loop of this rhythm it puts the juice in my pistons
So jump back, react spit in the booth with precision
When I'm cruising with Izm' yeah I'm dueceing the spliff
It's a BnE show, bitch, getting loose was a given
I don't want them to look back when the future was written
And know we killed ourselves with nuclear fission and stupid decisions
Shit I'd rather an asteroid due for collision
Then know the planet got fucked by the human condition
Sing the tune with conviction!

And all I know is the sun is shining
Yet we fight on through the night
While the 'burgs are melting and the sea is rising
I don't know so I ask them why
And all I know is the sun is shining
Yet we fight on through the night
Well if you don't know, shit I don't know
I guess all we can do is ask them why

Yeah I'm an old school poet, yeah, yo, yo, yo

Yo I'm an old school poet, I cherish the ink
That cosmic cowboy that doesn't care what they think
Real magic isn't card tricks, big cribs and cars, bitch
It's making something out of nothing through this hardship
And even though that the Earth is weak
We still bomb each other and idol what the churches speak
It's like this land is either run by Labor or Liberal
But don't get it twisted they're the same as the criminals
So open your eyes simply notice the issue
That we stuck to our guns without promoting the pistol
We only orchestrated the sound that we all love
Split because of colour but bound because of blood
So before we all blow and they sell the scene
Know that the only thing that's bullet proof is my self-esteem
See this is way beyond cash, and ego tripping
It's an epic electric Eso ecosystem, grow with me!

And all I know is the sun is shining
Yet we fight on through the night
While the 'burgs are melting and the sea is rising
I don't know so I ask them why
And all I know is the sun is shining
Yet we fight on through the night
Well if you don't know, shit I don't know
I guess all we can do is ask them why

I don't have to tell you things are bad
Everybody knows things are bad
Pollution th-thr-threatens-
Recognise the icecaps are melting quick
Kids trust no one 'cause fire burn dem
The air is unfit to breathe, our food is unfit to eat
It's an inferno land, pollution th-thr-threatens-
Recognise the icecaps are melting quick
Fuck all that shit; we are here together in this country as one
As fucking one!
It's all about peace, love and unity
Sing it, peace, love and unity
Peace, love and unity

And all I know is the sun is shining
Yet we fight on through the night
While the 'burgs are melting and the sea is rising
I don't know so I ask them why
And all I know is the sun is shining
Yet we fight on through the night
Well if you don't know, shit I don't know
I guess all we can do is ask them why

It was pass on through generations through monks, students and many others. Just like the poets
That's right. Ladies and gentlemen, poetry has been in existence
Since  the dinosaurs used to move 
Even the ancestors, the sharks, used to ""hooo"" in a sea-like manner. My friends, poetry has been among us since the beginning of time

The Truth,Flying Colours,2008,"Step right up, take a ringside seat bro
At the Hip-Hop big top, midnight freak show
Where kids fiend rap dreams that seem majestic
Line up at the Zoltar machine to get big
And walk with giants to shake up the system
But behind the carnival curtain see the makeup magicians
Wake up and listen, hear what's not for the public's ears
Pinocchio poets played by profiting puppeteers
Talent sharks want blood, rappers hook them with the Gat talk
See a full fashion show, just look at the cat-walk
Corporate snakes, boardroom fellas
Clowns that rap about their wealth are the fortune tellers
From fire flow breathers, come and witness the illuminance
To one hit wonder disappearing industry illusionists
Ringleaders with whips, quick, the fifteen minute fuse it lit
My poems paint movie script imagery that's ludicrous
From Portland basements where the rapping is real
To sunset beat boxing in the African hills
I creep with a pack of dreamers who are deep in the mountain
The wildcat trampolinists who are keeping you bouncing
Under the circus my thoughts design the sound effects

Before judging me, know that I hustle, I work
If I sold to someone you know, try judging them first
It's like that till the day I lie under the dirt
I speak truth and shouldn't have to rhyme once in a verse
The proof is hidden right under my words
But to hear it you got to buy some of my merch
Come get it, we go-getters, this cold business
Is the reason me and my homies don't kick and have grown distant
Record labels and gold diggers, there's no difference
They're both bitches only out for their own interest
I'm just another guy that's rapping
To justify my action, while you run it by your captain
What has this even come to? You see the end result
But don't see the hoops you feel the need to jump through

Ignore the wrong and see the right this is leading up to

This ship's been sunk in an industry of distaste and mistrust
I rip stage till your rib cage lifts up
Trying to blow but the grenade pin's stuck
Unrightfully so, I'm a young likeness of dope
To the millions in the scene, who try to build it
But look like little children bewildered by the king
I turn my back to them but I'm guiltless
How long I got to milk this before I gain fulfilment of the dream
Look, look, hard to find the message
It's bigger than that, see my art defines my essence
That's why I'm offended, that they can't write a sentence
Without sugar sprinkles till Hop-Hop's diabetic
Now murdering rappers is sort of my obsession
I'm taking vengeance like the war on 9/11
But I use a mic, I'm not glorifying weapons
Bragging about dirt you do is borderline pathetic

Bang, boom, here comes the stampede
Dusty drifters that dominate the damn beat
Sand Peeps, B.E.I representatives
We came to drug your brain with no sedatives
And spawn light to shine for the kiddies
While Mother Nature lets us write rhymes on her titties
So just relax, indulge in the rebirth
(The underground don't fuck around), we're gunning rounds of free dirt
Feet first, that's the motherfucking key word
With minorities and management on my t-shirt
The translator of the compass in a golden chair
With 100 poets saddled up on polar bears
Yeah, now that's a sight to see
When they flash their fangs and they fight for me
So kill the puppeteer, murder the matador
'Cause all I got in my head is a motherfucking cannonball

Woodstock 2008,Flying Colours,2008,"[Verse 1: Eso & 
Bliss
]
Hear the pistons pump, hear the engine roar
That's my heart and soul trying to bend the law
It's a beautiful night to fly like a phoenix
Bang the beat and get high like I'm Jesus
I had a choice before I got lost on the canvas
Conform to the norm, or go off in a tangent
To a field of dreams
, we built it with no bucks
So I aimed for the stars and tilted my scope up
Suddenly at gigs we were packing the floor, having 'em roar
It took 2 LPs to get a crack in the door
Here's Johnny
, but I'm happy of course
I talk total true thoughts when I'm tackling tours
Matter of fact, I just rap, not a cat with a Porsche
I'm in a tug-o-war of words whirling backwards and forwards
And I can't get enough of this feeling
Blaze the bonfire up on this beach and
Welcome to Woodstock 2 double O 8
You better buckle up, this ride has no breaks
I'm 'a fang the bitch, till it flames out the back
Out of control like a train off its tracks
You know God damn well who burnt the house down
Buried the bullshit and turned the sound round
B.E.I, we bring it back to Basics
And get the whole crowd ape shit

Well I've been slaving for five days
(Say what)
And finally the weekend's arrived
(Say what, say what)
The walls and roof is on fire
(That's right)
Now that's what I call Saturday night
(That's right, that's right)
[Verse 2: Eso & 
Bliss
]
See if the vibe is right and the beat is tight
Trust me my brother we gon' eat tonight
And that's a seven course meal for my people in the gutter
If we all can't share, I ain't eating, motherfucker
I went down to the woods and took a look into my soul and
A kaleidoscope of colours started cooking in my cauldron
In a dark world I got to fight through the cruel night
Spread my wings, take flight into the moonlight
I'm just basking in the sunshine of fates soothing innocence
Painting with a personal palette of moving images
I am my life's editor, you bet I might
Be that Jedi Knight on your red eye flight
Direct like Billy Walsh,
 I'm in charge like the Dalai Lama
Roll with my Entourage like Johnny Drama
Sky surf a computer of destiny
Back at the Bliss batch, booze and Buddha is the recipe
It's a baboon bash, a barbarian ball
Where we all get together and we never get bored
Yeah we're clever with swords, look what popped out bitch
Came stomping through your hood with this knock out shit

Well I've been slaving for five days
(Say what)
And finally the weekend's arrived
(Say what, say what)
The walls and roof is on fire
(That's right)
Now that's what I call Saturday night
(That's right, that's right)
[Verse 3: Bliss & 
Eso

I don't move crack rock in a fat sock
I move dope rhymes snap locked in a laptop
Going eighty on the freeway, chilling with my DJ
Hot to trot and we drop with no delay
This is my heart and soul bra, my art and culture
We hold this bitch down like Spartan soldiers
So God forsake me for telling my rhyme
But Big Macka does tell it on time
With the sirens blaring, I rock the damn Richter
I'm the fire of Aries, the cosmic transmitter

I can't complain that you don't know my name
And if that's the case then baby please let me explain
It be that Lumberjack Macka and Jonathon Coltrane
Izm in the back, digging through the wax, doing his thing
God forsake me, God forsake what we do in the hood
God forsake me, God forsake what we do in the hood
God forsake me, God forsake what we do in the hood
God forsake me, big Macka is up to no good

Well I've been slaving for five days
(Say what)
And finally the weekend's arrived
(Say what, say what)
The walls and roof is on fire
(That's right)
Now that's what I call Saturday night
(That's right, that's right)
Well I've been slaving for five days
(Say what)
And finally the weekend's arrived
(Say what, say what)
The walls and roof is on fire
(That's right)
Now that's what I call Saturday night
(That's right, that's right)

Put the pedal to the metal, I'm on another level
You cannot bring me down
I never settle with the devil, I'm a renegade rebel
You got to feel me now
Put the pedal to the metal, I'm on another level
You cannot bring me down
I never settle with the devil, I'm a renegade rebel
You got to feel me now",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-woodstock-2008-lyrics

Yo! Well this is Smokey Dopey Arab and the dynamic duo
The cutting committee, the lyrical mechanic hero
And you know (what's that?) that we serve the people nice
And we're good live, like reversing evil twice

I'm from a world where your cash couldn't buy an idea
So fuck the po-po, we're getting high up in here
See, my rhyme is official, time's not an issue
Sit back, click clack, yo, my mind is a missile

Yeah, we're rude with the manners, but we're cool with the grammar
So we got mothers feeling this to fucking dudes in the slammer
Brewing the bangers and our show is a spectacle
My damn crew is bananas, the flow is impeccable

We just roll up through the hills in the meadows
Would you hold up? This is Bliss to the Eso
So just go nuts let me hear you really bellow
Okay (
okay!
)

We don't flash cash under neon lights
My name is Mad Max,
 pitching ""we want rights""
I've got the bull by its horns, the beast by its tail
A brain off its leash, that's deeper than Yale
Shock waves through your hood when I properly drop this
Double barrelled brainstorm to bang in your cockpit
So how you feeling Bliss?

Man, I never been better
This veteran's clever, he's stringing every letter together

Banging like a set of berettas not a getter of cheddar
Instead I roll up to the bash in the fucking Nebuchadnezzar
Oh my god, throw 'em up like Krylons
And we going get it cracking like a party in Zion

We just roll up through the hills in the meadows
Would you hold up? This is Bliss to the Eso
So just go nuts let me hear you really bellow
Okay (
okay!
) (Check it out)

Hey yo, I blow 
Briggs
 back, that's what happens when I talk
Smoked out, no doubt, hey, Staffi's on a Porsche
And I'm not a joke, I blaze up the broccoli
I rock the boat, I break the monotony

You need a pick up? Well, this'll make ya switch lanes quick
Like hitting Charlie when you're drunk, just like Rick James, bitch
My nickname's Bliss, but wait a second, you buster
You don't know me, my brother, you may address me as Gunther

Well if you got it, motherfucker then you know my name
I make it rain lit matchsticks and snow cocaine
And I'm down for the cause like a dog for its owner
While shit-talkers spill grog off my boner

Bitch, back the fuck up and build your spaceship right
You dilly dally dummy

We just roll up through the hills in the meadows
Would you hold up? This is Bliss to the Eso
So just go nuts let me hear you really bellow
Okay (
okay!

We just roll up through the hills in the meadows
Would you hold up? This is Bliss to the Eso

Everything I said I wouldn’t do, I did
Life just happens and it is what it is
That’s how I used to think as a kid
But better learn to swim or you’ll sink with the ship
'Cause in a blink of a lid, you’ll be twice your age
And then till now is like night and day
And that perfect life that you’re fighting for
Can be lost in a series of sliding doors
Too proud to say that you need some help
When you look In the mirror do you see yourself?
See the way I was I couldn’t stand it honestly
'Cause the old me was tryna kill the man I wanna be
And so life took me on the scenic route
To reach deep inside and get the demons out
Then turn that storm to vanilla in the summer sky
Caterpillar to a butterfly

I must be going crazy
I got blood across my face
I've got tears that I can taste
I swear this world is tryna break me
‘Cause the walls are closing in
And my soul is wearin’ thin
But you should know that
[Chorus: Mario, 
Bliss & Eso

I’m right here waiting
When you’re done, baby
Had to tell myself I believe in you
Had to tell myself I believe in you
[Verse 2: Bliss &

Lord knows I been running from my dream
But I keep trippin' when the devil’s tugging on my sleeve
And the game don’t stop when the ball's in my hand
But that party life will put a pause on my plans
But we don’t make our faith
And mistakes are what shape you and make you great
So to sum it all up into words
I never win or lose, I only win or learn
All the drugs and drink, I’m a victim of that
You know what curiosity did to the cat
We were looking for a high where we knew we'd never land
But now that I’m a dad I’m tryna’ be a better man
And the music allowed us to give you something
When it hits home it can stop a kid from jumpin’
I was on the wrong path but I made a turn right
Then I opened my eyes for the very first time, like

I must be going crazy
I got blood across my face
I've got tears that I can taste
I swear this world is tryna break me
‘Cause the walls are closing in
And my soul is wearin’ thin
But you should know that

It doesn’t matter what god you worship
‘Cause here on earth, no body’s perfect
You wanna be the hero that saves the day
But the truth is everybody makes mistakes
So, when you’re out her fallin’ down
And temptation is all around
Put your good foot first and bust out the other side
Just like a butterfly
Livin’ in a world where 
this binge is the norm, and
Every night out was like till six in the morning
But I should be kicking goals, my passion’s musical
So why the fuck am I back in this cubical?
Shit, flying off rails
Like a train wreck but I will not fail
So tonight imam pack my bags
And leave the old me behind and the past I’ve had, like

I must be going crazy
I got blood across my face
I've got tears that I can taste
I swear this world is tryna break me
‘Cause the walls are closing in
And my soul is wearin’ thin

Wooo, I am off work and free
How you feelin’ Macca?
Man, I can see a field of festive freaky family members

I feel this field of people vibrating
Fuck my boss, I’m on vacation
These tunes got me elevated
Yup, I think I’m off my face and
Oh! Wassup motherfuckers?
Hell yes, I’m goddamn free
On the real I feel unreal
'Cause the wheels so steel, just drop that beat
That drug is massaging my brain
That buzz is a God in my veins
So put your birds in the sky, we’re B.n.E
For a little group therapy, let’s scream:
""Fuck work
'Cause right now, bitch, I'm free""
Yeah, that feel good, don’t it?
I mean really, that feel good don’t it
The spinning waxes feeling magic
The melody that enters me is sending me the energy
If you are Jasmine, it’s like I’m Aladdin
Our chemistry is heavenly; your destiny is meant to be here
I feel blessed with you
I could dive in your eyes of electric blue
You’re my Tinkerbelle and this is love
You wanna fly? Have a line of that pixie dust
Because, baby baby

Hold up, I just rolled up
Here with all my mates

This shit right here's what makes me happy
If I’m not writing rhymes then I’m changing nappies
Call me MacDaddy, I’m a joyful cat
You can tell from the feel that the boys are back
If you’re still rappin' about selling a brick
To be honest my brother you ain't telling me shit
See I shine when I rhyme 'cause I spit the truth
When I hit the booth, I uplift the youth
Yeah, I’m down to earth, but my head is in orbit
My life is rapping and my weapon's are cordless
It’s time for action and it’s very important
That you know when I flow, I put the ""eso"" in awesome
Killin' it, before compact disc
On the real-ly all the kiddies won't know what that is
But they mosh that pit, 'cause I got that gift
To get the whole crowd yelling; ""Macca rock that shit!""
And when I jump, I'ma tell you the outcome
I, fly, like the millennium falcon
I'ma kiss the sky like I don’t give a fuck

Hold up, I just rolled up

Blue,Off the Grid,2017,"Yo
Wherever you are
Yo, I'ma be there
Whenever you need me
You better believe me, just put on a pair
Of headphones, let’s go deep in our zone
Off to a place where those people don’t know
No judgement, fuck them, they don’t know nothing
We are connected and they cannot touch it

And that’s why I love it
All the bullshit, we’re above it
And that’s gangster and we’re love sick
On a level that they just can’t fuck with
But I see that they get you down
They make it hard for you to hold your head up proud
But I hope, when I bust this verse
We gon’ feel like we’re the only ones on earth
Lost in the madness
Is it all an illusion?
Do we only exist in the music?
Make you think about it
Nah man, this is real magic
Turn it up and let me feel that shit
Yo, if it’s real magic
Turn it up and let me feel that shit

I’ll always be there for you
Even when you are blue
I’ll always be there for you
Even when you are blue

One day I got a text from a number that I didn’t recognise
It said “Bliss, you don’t know me but I’m a huge fan of you guys
The thing is I got cancer and I’m fighting to stay alive
I’m at the hospital and it would mean the world to me if you could come say hi”
It made me think, damn
There’s a magic in the moment you put on those headphones
And no matter what you’re going through
If only for a second that drama lets go
And lets your brain shift until it’s painless
Sometimes you just gotta know you’re not alone there’s people going through the same shit
Because when that rain hits and you’ve entered the jungle
And you’re lost in the dark those speakers will glow like the light end of the tunnel
And that black cloud that follows you around like day and night
This pierce like a ray of light (Yes)
I’ve seen it fuck around, straight savin’ lives
And ain't that something man
Shit, that’s humbling
Yeah, my stress reliever
'Cause sometimes we all need a breather
So I got to the hospital
Walked in and he got a grin
I said, ""If you ever feel alone, put your headphones on
And know you always got a friend""

I’ll always be there for you
Even when you are blue
I’ll always be there for you
Even when you are blue

I'll always be, I'll always be
I'll always be, I'll always be
I'll always be, I'll always be
I'll always be there for
There for, there for
There for you
Be, be, there for you
Be, be, be there for you

I'mma burn this bridge as soon as I get over
Baby I can see it in your eyes when I hold ya
So I gotta kill the devil

Yo, check it
I got a bullet for the devil, and that is the truth
You won't believe who he is until he's actually you
Reaching out to anything to use as an excuse
When my mother passed, all I knew was smashing the booze
Now my bands on the rise but Vic' Bitter got me rude
A loose cannon when I'm hammered, tryna bicker with my crew
A head full of anger got me trapped when I drink
Ten years, a case a day, how's that for a binge?
And the music industry's a constant celebration
Caught up, but we don't see the hell we're facing
And the flames only grow once your name's getting known
Now everybody's backstage shit-faced at your show
And I wanted the right route, but nobody showed me
If I knew then what I know now I would've blown up the pokies
Give back the free beer so Max can see clear
I gave it all up and I ain't look back in three years
And it's the best thing I've ever done
I told the devil run
I blew his head off my shoulder, now who's the clever cunt?
They're just a memory, those days of acting crazy
I put them all behind me for my lady and our baby
And under the bridge is where my mother lay in peace
I buried those ashes next to my mother's favourite tree
Surprised I'm alive as I leave her a candle
I'm a work in progress, trying to lead by example, yo

'm trying to shoot the devil off my shoulder

No for real, this game can fucking nuts
And I've been cooped up in this bus for a couple months
Bro I tell you man, it fucking sucks
But ayy, haha, let's rock and fucking roll, baby
Another day another show I gotta go, baby
Another plane it takes a toll but it's all gravy
'Cause I’m rose-tinted, sipping on that Rosé
We live a life where every day's a celebration
A Garden of Eden with every temptation
So honestly if you were in my spot right
Would you be swept up by the fame and the spotlight?
(Spotlight, spotlight, spotlight, spotlight)
'Cause every night it's a party
It kicks off the moment I get on stage
(And god damn you're the mother fucking man right)
You're damn right this fame'll get you anything you damn like
So, after the show, it's the after-party
And after the party, it's the hotel lobby
And after the lobby, I'm sloppy tomorrow
I'll be sorry, a zombie, yep there goes Jonny
On and on and on, that's the circus every night, yo
But you don't see the devil underneath the tight-rope
Throwing bitches beers and bongs like they alley-oops
Screaming ""Slam ‘em, Johnny, fucking values""
It's poison, binge drinking is just standard
But you can't nail goals when you're hammered
Put my career in the mirror and I wonder, huh
Is this rockstar living or just fucking up?
And Macka, I'm fucking proud of you brother
It couldn't be any rougher on that road to recover
And now you got through the withdrawals, lord knows!
Stuck in a 50 degree Afganistan warzone
That's g shit so I pay homage
Now you bet I got a bullet with the devil's name on it
I right these wrongs as I write this song
I wanna right these wrongs as my life goes on

Got a bullet for the devil, for the devil (devil)
Got a bullet for the devil, for the devil (devil)
Got a bullet for the devil, for the devil, yes I
Got a bullet for the devil, for the devil
Bang bang, bang bang, bang bang

And I'm out with my wolves, we all dressed in wool
Slow-motion through this giant masquerade ball
Everybody got their mask on and face off
Yeah, you're damn right we having fun tonight
I got shit to do, but I've had a few so fuck it right
I live a year round festival season
All it takes is a few drinks and I'm texting my demons (hello)
Slow dancin' with destiny on this tightrope
I hope I make it home to you before the light shows
And I know I said I wouldn't do this again
But baby right now, you're my only friend

You see those dark clouds covering my conscience?
I need help, I'm in love with my own monsters
I did it again, but never is it my mistake
Until you're wide awake and life feels like a tidal wave
Night and day I used to welcome the high
And at that moment, black roses fell from the sky
It's like, ""They want the truth,"" well fuck it man, I'll be honest
You may see a happy chap, but not a recovering alcoholic
You can see I'm blessed, but not me being self-abusive
You can see my success, but not my wife that got me through it
And like a ray of light, I see my baby boy
You make your mother glow, you bring me crazy joy
Too many reasons to love life
Watching the sunrise in my son's eyes

Friend Like You,Off the Grid,2016,"Ayy, lemme try it from the top again

My mind is scaring me right now
Somebody shine a little light down
Tell me is there anybody out there
Feeling like I do?
Oo-ho-hoo
Sing it brother

Yo, this is a leap of faith
I got heart, you can count on that
It's all mind over matter
When you hit rock bottom, you gon' bounce right back
Pick yourself up, dust yourself off
And you start from ground zero
And, if you need any help
Just believe in yourself, you are your own hero
Look at your cape in the wind
Everything you do is cinematic
Light speed through time and space
And with a pinch of magic you can rip the fabric
But I guess it all starts with you
'Cause getting here is pretty hard to do
There's pitfalls and brick walls
But when you know there's no spoon
It's pretty hard to lose, yo

My mind is scaring me right now
Somebody shine a little light down
Tell me is there anybody out there
Feeling like I do, I do?
Well here I am, I got the blues again
I'm on my knees and I could use my friend
Tell me is there anybody out there
Feeling like I do, I do?

One shot, hit the white
8 ball in the pocket, winning right? (Winning)
Well, look at what Charlie did
I can't build my dream in this party bitch
'Cause life is like a race, but then you get a little pace
And have a fender and you fall and you go trippin' on your lace
This is my life and I don't like to cuss y'all
But everyone here can go politely fuck off
This is what I should do, good voodoo
Hit the surf, it'll put me in a good mood
If I—If I believe I can achieve
Gotta be the best version of me that I can be
So remember, when your thoughts are wild
Only you hold the key to unlock your smile
Do I keep the fight up, best bet I do
It means the world that I found a best friend like you
Come on

My mind is scaring me right now
Somebody shine a little light down
Tell me is there anybody out there
Feeling like I do, I do?
Well here I am, I got the blues again
I'm on my knees and I could use my friend
Tell me is there anybody out there
Feeling like I do, I do?
My mind is scaring me right now
Somebody shine a little light down
Tell me is there anybody out there
Feeling like I do, I do?
Well here I am, I got the blues again
I'm on my knees and I could use my friend
Tell me is there anybody out there
Feeling like I do, I do?
[Outro: Lee Fields & 
Les Brown (Sampled)

Oo-ho-hoo, yeah
You will discover some things about yourself that you don't know right now
Speak your mind
What you will realise is
Tell it like it is
What you will realise is that you're more powerful than you can ever imagine
Don't hold back
Sing it brother
Your—Your dream, Your—Your dream
Your—Your dream, Your—Your dream
Sing your song
Your—Your dream is possible

Great Escape,Off the Grid,2017,"Yeah, yeah, we back baby
I ain't gone lie, man, I ain't gone lie
Tell 'em

Last time we partied was fucking massive
And I'm still scattered, haha
But you know we still at it
From my mic in my mumma's cupboard to rap
With Mr Illmatic, I'm Phil Jackson
Got eleven gold rings on the wall
Shit, if you gone ball make sure you have a ball
'Cause it's a great escape so day to day
I keep hammering away word to Andy Dufresne

Yeah, them boys are back, you better buckle up
Switch to flight mode as we forever run amok
I'm zen with the pen, I'm in Chi mode, bro
So I wrote a rhyme to blow your mind like CeeLo's phone
I'm on another level, let 'em flap their lips
Decapitating gladiators, call me Maximus
And if you really believe, man, that's all that it takes
I ran up, slam dunked and put my balls in their face, hahaha

Never gonna
Fade away-way-way
Fade away-way-way
Fade away-way-way
Never gonna
Gonna break my way

""Yeah—Yeah, yeah""
""Oh Lord, I'm ""

Ever since a kid I had my hand up on the globe
And I would spin it 'round in circles just to watch the world unfold
Before my eyes and now I literally spin around the planet
Flipping rhymes around these melons like it's fucking acrobatics
What up? Yeah, this shit's banging
I made a wave hitting sharks like I'm Mick Fanning
In the wind, man, I gotta say there's nothing sweeter
'Cause the only time I fade away is when I hit the buzzer beater

I spit red flowers, these lyrics all help
To break through and take you beyond the physical realm
Yeah, you'll never find none iller, for real-er
You're fucking with a three headed Godzilla
In reverse, a benevolent beast building on earth
Putting feathers on letters after killing a verse
Yo, I ain't turning back, I'm prepared and you gotta love it
Like Bernie Mac, ""I ain't scared of you mother fuckers"" (""Kick ass"")

Never gonna
Fade away-way-way
Fade away-way-way
Fade away-way-way
Never gonna
Gonna break my way
So you best make way
It's the great escape

Don't call it a comeback, we've been here for years
Rocking our peers, yeah, we covered the sphere
Blood, sweat and tears, rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
So, Macca, what up? How your microphone sound?
She sounds tight, well aight, show 'em what it's about
Yo, man, they musta forgot, we 'bout to blow up the spot
We double trouble, bubble-bubble, bubble, bubbling hot
So throw yo hands in ayer
And wave 'em like you just don't cay-er
And if you like fish and chips or hitting big spliffs
Everybody in the house say oh yay-er
We been in the game for ten years making rap tunes
Way before the internet and chat rooms
So stay awake 'cause together we're a movement
We'll never fade away we live forever in the music
Music, music, music, music

Never gonna

Moments,Off the Grid,2017,"Yeah, I just wanna feel this way forever
How we did when we were young
Yeah, I know I've been changing
Yeah, life's been rearranging
Those times were golden, but I—
I couldn't hold 'em all at once
I lost that moment
But now I got it back, yeah, I ain't gonna give it up

Yeah
You know, growing up happened so fast
And you only get your first times once
Those moments were special, like

The first breath, first step, first chick, first kiss
First time in love, first time on drugs
The first time I heard Pac, the first time it's all new
The first time the earth stopped, the first time I saw you
Yeah, those moments I'll always hold onto
Forever stained in my brain in a golden hue
Like when I was a kid just dreaming of the things I've built
Those autumn leaves would cover my hood in a crimson quilt
The world was mine and the memory of my home
Still triggered by the smell of fresh snow and pinecones
Those early days of the six-packs and stimulants
Before the demons came and kidnapped my innocence
Before life swept me up and I was hurled in
And I lost pieces of myself up in this whirlwind
But I had to find them again, 'cause they're the miracle
That took me from feeling invisible to invincible, yeah

Yeah, I just wanna feel this way forever
How we did when we were young
Yeah, I know I've been changing
Yeah, life's been rearranging
Those times were golden, but I—
I couldn't hold 'em all at once
I lost that moment
But now I got it back, yeah, I ain't gonna give it up

Oo-hoo-ooo, oh, get up
Yeah, I ain't gonna give it up
Oo-hoo-ooo
But now I got it back, yeah, I ain't gonna give it up

Yo, see I remember how it felt making paper planes
Pretending I was Superman so I could save the day
I swear that I would see Santa if I could stay awake
And finding ways to fly away was like my great escape
An only child, a single mother, a small apartment
Didn't have that silver spoon, but we were always laughing
Staring at the clouds, chatting for hours
Where a simple smell lets me time travel through flowers
And I'm happy I believed, and everything happens for a reason
'Cause if your angel dies and your worlds crashing through your ceiling
Hopefully you know you own a map to your own freedom
Realise tears dry and it's a natural way of healing, yo

Yeah, I just wanna feel this way forever
How we did when we were young
Yeah, I know I've been changing
Yeah, life's been rearranging
Those times were golden, but I—
I couldn't hold 'em all at once
I lost that moment
But now I got it back, yeah, I ain't gonna give it up

Oo-hoo-ooo, oh, get up
Yeah, I ain't gonna give it up
Oo-hoo-ooo
But now I got it back, yeah, I ain't gonna give it up

It up, it up
I ain't gonna give it up
It up, it up
Well, I ain't gonna give it up

They say time is precious and there's no going back
Shit, if I could only unfreeze this photograph
And dive in the windows of my eyes to feel how I felt
Inside right in that moment in time, I'd bring it all back to life
So fuck the money, cars, and accessories
'Cause the only thing we take to our grave is our memories
I said fuck the money, clothes, and accessories'Cause the only thing we really own is our memories

Who's there? Oh shit you know who it is
It's been a while
Yes it has
Now it's time for the solar eclipse
They watched us grow
They know we're the rose that broke through the bricks
Yeah we rolled our patrols, got over that bridge
Yeah, it's three G.O.A.T.S in this bitch
So what you know about being out here repping peace
Fuck beef we're going ham on this
So come and see what it is off the grid
Let me show you where the kids of the vanguard live
We say raise your fist, take no shit
Yeah, like our grandmas did!
These haters might be in the house but who do you think the mother fucking landlord is?

I'm off the grid-grid-grid-grid-grid-grid
I'm off the grid-grid-grid-grid-grid-grid
I'm off the grid, that's the anthem homie
I'm off the grid and you can't control me

Huh, oh
Welcome everybody to the sixth
Time travel on our latest adventure into another dimension, off of the grid
We been deep in the woods and cooking up hella shit
Audio alchemy with periodic elements
We never took shit from no one, we just kept on growing to show the world a little anthem across the elephant
Oh lord, I'ma show you what I'm rapping for
To flip a door mat into a matador
And groove when life's trying to hurt ya'll
You can hit home runs off of curve-balls
And sail on the sea of those tears
Destiny whispered that dream in my ear
I shake every hand of every fan at every jam at every land
'Cause god damn they're the reason we're here
Straight up, I gotta thank ya'll
It's BnE fans that I treasure because no matter the weather
Everyone banded together when all of the shit hit the fan
That's why we're family forever, and that's real
Life on the gauntlet ride, best believe only the strong survive
So, remember to love yourself like Conor McGreggor
Where the fuck's my belt
What up, haha

I'm off the grid-grid-grid-grid-grid-grid
I'm off the grid-grid-grid-grid-grid-grid
I'm off the grid, that's the anthem homie
I'm off the grid and you can't control me

Yo! It's the return of the Mac
I'm back yeah you better listen up
Came in the game like fire in the rain cause I didn't give a fuck
On stage in a rage
All we do is wanna make love and riot
I got a unicorn that shits rainbows
From a father that loves face fucking lions
Oh, I got a squad full of ninjas
And that's a gang of gods on a Nimbus
Zenned out and playing with lightning
Unplugged, eating cake on a bison
See with this I can float above the atlas
And make it rain multicoloured acid
Magic, it's happening right now
Imagine a world where you finally defeat the dragon
But on the real, no jokes
I nearly died tryna live this life
Now all I think about now, is how many blessings I can give my tribe
And raise my seed off love, compassion, and empathy
Let them know that his soul is golden and we all hold that magical energy
Oh yeah, there it is I can feel it
That's what happens when you're dealing with the real shit
Fuck a beer I'll be happy to order
Some teriyaki chicken and a gallon of water
My wilder-people are in sync with nature
We live off the grid like Ricky Baker (come on 2Pac)
This shit's my outlet, I don't look on the bright side
I built a house there

I'm off the grid-grid-grid-grid-grid-grid
I'm off the grid-grid-grid-grid-grid-grid
I'm off the grid, that's the anthem homie
I'm off the grid and you can't control me

We're out here all alone!
Don't worry about a search party! Haha
We like it out here! Hahaha
Come one, come all, to gather round!
For a story will be told
The future is ours!
""I heard they were off the grid""
""I can't believe what I saw, I don't think I've ever seen this before""
""All I saw was the light and then these feathers""
""I was off the grid when I saw it""

When the beats up, on the speakers
I hit the floor like a pimp in his sneakers
I get a little bit of minute like I’m rocking the thermometer of a john Saturday night fever
Best believe I’m coming to America just to tell Randy Watson, that my soul glows
Like I’m that sexual white chocolate
So get up, bitch
Like I just said nobody puts baby in a corner
Yeah Johnny’s got a dirty dance
And sure ain't, no Swayze performance
‘cause when I bust a move I don’t give 2 fucks
I own it, y’all can witness
Shit I can cruise out with no pants, or I can rock n roll no risky business
I got the day off like Bueller
I'm on the beach on a cruiser with my kangaroo named boozer
We’re ballin like we’re some boomers
Smokin’ this Buddah in cubans
I’ll take it back to the future
So I can break a kids scooter
And hover board like a ruler
‘cause I ain't givin' a fuck, I’m like Elaine from Seinfeld rippin’ it up
Let’s get it on like Marvin Gaye
Hit the floor so hard that Harlem Shakes
So girl let’s dance like nobody's watching

Super-cali-fragalistic Eso’s got that dope shit
Back up in the house and there’s no doubt they’re bout to notice
Yeah I got that fire, that fire that keeps your soul lit
That bass, got you off your face
And the crowd is shouting, “go sick!”
Oh shit, you see the way that I live my life
In dark times, sparks fly, every time that I grip the mic, and when I rip my face off, you’ll see a rainbow covered ninja
Then I’ll set the roof on fire, spinning this halo round my finger, yo
I’m feeling blessed just waking up, I got that vision
I kiss my baby’s face then hold him high up to the ceiling, dancing silly with daddy
Music helps you find your wings it’s all Hakuna Matata
My lounge room looks like Lion King
I'ma bring that vibe on in that makes you groove grind and swing
Break it down, body rockin', you ain't gonna wanna stop it
So eshay. Let’s get those hands together
Press play and we can dance forever

That is sprawled on the walls of your mental
You ain't get the memo, shit
Better check mate 'cause I'm making moves like a chess pro
Free My Mind like En Vogue
'Cause I'm a fucking Hail Mary that is caught in the end zone
No strings attached from the get-go
I'm real, boy, like the wish of Geppetto
Shit man, I was born a rebel
Been playing this game way before Nintendo
Ever since I could record a demo
Makin’ a mic out of a corded headphone
Got bars locked down with a record to release
To make it big from the pen like Gordon Gecko
When the beat bass leave 'em on the zemo
I killed that bitch with a Jordan-esque flow
And as sure as that go
Ride around the planet quicker than a fucking soaring jet goes
Keep getting louder like more crescendo
The hands of the crowd are now horns of devils
I’m amped now, never have doubts, settle back down
Charge the track so hard it's a black out

It’s B.n.E. and my team glows
I stay up just to make love
To that paint brush, and give 'em heat strokes
I’m a speed boat down a ski slope
Sippin' miso, puffin' weed smoke
All g’d up, 'cause our VW’s
That one with a candy apple green coat
As far as dreams go, I’m sweet bro
My fam is all I need, yo
I'ma stick it in your brain, just to fuck with your cerebral
On cloud nine’s where my fleet floats
I got kilo’s of that free hope
It’s Friday and in my brain
I don’t give a fuck about no Deebo
Let me tell you about my steelo
I'm like Neo vs. Magneto
Having lightening fights at frightening heights
On the top of Jesus in Rio
I’m Han Solo mixed with CeeLo
Smoke Greedo on the D-Low
And when Macca spits I'm immaculate
'Cause I can decode the human genome

Sad violinists when I sold their violas
Mad like a hippie when you stole their granola
In the desert lookin' for a cold cherry cola
Life's hard like a cold areola, my
Thoughts tend to do hand grenade harm
I think, therefore I amputate arms
I’m not always a man with great charm
But I’ll be there like the man from State Farm
I’m dedicated to getting better
Like meth-heads are dedicated to finding methods of getting faded
Defecated on microphones on every state in the land
So I better be scrubbing up before you’re shaking my hand
I’m making a stand, put me in a jam I hang tough
Scram when I break my handcuffs
And I will shake every snake, every soft fake motherfucker off like flakes of dandruff
If they use my back as a staircase, I get up in their face
And give 'em a rare taste of genuine bear mace
If you're in my airspace I'm shooting you down
If you think you’re king, I’m surgically removing the crown
I’m movin' around, have some trouble choosin' a town
'Cause when I move I never lose any ground
At any given moment it's hard to really tell at what city I dwell
Find me in Philly bangin' my head on the Liberty bell
City in Brooklyn or, Heart Boulevard
Cause if you’re looking hard, Watsky and B.n.E
Never caught being seen where the rookies are
Luke Skywalker, any hand caught in a cookie jar
And now that the day's before me
Gonna go out in a blaze of glory
Savour the phases, the crazy, insane
And then tell an amazing story

A dollar and a dream and that’s the shit I ain’t forgotten
My tribe got that vibe that'll make you feel accepted
My soul is in these songs and the record its reflection
I’m on a quest to spread our music through the planet
Let us open your mind and we'll use it as a canvas
Now I count my blessings as a worldwide traveler
From getting pissy in Paris to waking up in Africa
I’ll draw a map for ya, I been across the Atlas, bruh
From Niseko Japan to the snowy mountains in Canada
And my Jewish manager, he’s my doobie handler
Could’ve shown you the world but yo, he’s useless with a camera
Life on the road and I’m still surprised
How our bus was hit by a train and we still survived

It goes, one for the love, two for the soul

We drove the mountains in the van, rode the powder in Japan
Then we rocked Afghanistan under the threat of Tali-ban
Sippin' fine wines in Paris, MyThai’s and hammocks, in Miami
Seen it all it’s like I’ve skydive the planet
And when we end the show, afterparty at my place
The whole crowd's screamin’ “afterparty at my place!”
Tryna smoke up all the weed before we fly afar
""You got that shit to roll a blunt?"" Mmm, close but no cigar
Then I sit back and nap, watch Indiana Jones
While you see my plane back track and spin around the globe
Flyin' in and out of zones, all from cinematic poems
Seen the whole world but nothing's like Sydney as a home

It goes, one for the love, two for the soul
Let’s take a trip through the stereo
We’re a traveling band, moving through tape decks
Pack your bags, we found the oasis

Whatever Happened To The DJ,Off the Grid,2017,"Oh lordy, good god

What ever happened to the DJ
Have you seen him?
Shit, people treat him like he in a museum
Acting like he ain't built this bitch
With the 1—2—3, like this

We jumped on a plane and we flew to America
First tour there, and we were new to the area
Hit every state and saw a lot of shows
Supposedly the home of hip-hop, well I don’t know
‘Cause we saw a ton of rappers but it totally seems strange That every single one of them was missing a DJ
But if you’re missing a DJ
Then you’re pretty much a karaoke singer, man, and that’s on the real mate
What happened to the cuts? What happened to the mix?
What happened to the juggle? What happened to the tricks?
Shit! The DJ was the god damn man
In hip-hop he's a good damn band
Now kids these days, part of the new school
You ask them about Kool HERC, they be like Kool- Who?
Ah well, there ya go
Shit, Angel Haze hadn’t heard of Biggie till a couple fucking years ago
Fuck CDJ’s, stop being absurd
Real DJ spins, 33 and a third
Yeah, let’s give hope to the people
Save the culture, bring the dope through the needle

What ever happened to the DJ
Have you seen him?
Shit, people treat him like he in a museum
Acting like he ain't built this bitch
With the 1, 2, 3, like this
DJ, where’d he go?
People act like they don’t know
It all started from scratch, let’s set it straight
With a kick and a snare, yeah, them's the breaks
""D—D—DJ""
""Izm""
What ever happened to the DJ?
""Baddest DJ in the land""
What ever happened to the DJ?
""1—2—3""
What ever happened to the DJ?
Acting like he ain't built this bitch
With the 1—2—3, like this

Damn right, better give me lee-way
‘Cause I don’t go nowhere without my Dj
Yeah, B.n.E handle the rap
And DJ Izm is ""the man on the wax""
Turntables get blessed when you touch it
‘Cause all you do on the daily is cut sick
Don’t believe me? Watch and see
The whole crowd shit bricks when he drops the beat
Yeah, that’s how it makes you feel
Sucker DJ can't fake the real

Addicted,Running On Air,2010,"I was born in the 80s with that summertime love
Then changed the whole game like ""what have I done?""
Out the gutter I come to touch the bright sun
And from the highest heights motherfucker, I jump
Free in the sky of belief I can fly
Ain't no tellin' what they're sellin', man they're sheep in disguise
Keep this in mind, I keep on my grind
I can do it any way I wanna do it
Bitch, I'll sleep when I die
Explosive, ferocious, get up get down that's showbiz
Power to the people that have freedom in their focus
I hope this helps you when you're under the thumb
When you feel like nothing can save you
When you feel like jumping the gun
Stop relax and remember even in the worst weather
You'll find a way cross it, there'll be brighter days honest
So get up, get out and get somethin', that's on the real
Forget what you were taught and show these people how you feel
Like

Who are you to tell me how to live my life
'Cause I won't give this up
These are my shoes, my view
My cue to say I do give a fuck
And pretty soon I'ma bloom and it'll be all right
Every day's another chance to ignite
'Cause I'm addicted (uh-oh), I'm addicted (uh-oh)
I'm addicted to this universal feeling called life

""Guidance is internal""

Since a foetus, explored life's subtle secrets
From my fingertips to my unique double helix
I can see history, I can see the past lessons
It's your right, never be afraid to ask questions
How can every religion claim to be the only one?
How can they preach love yet fight each other holding guns?
I think the golden sun may be able to shed some light
I'd rather push peace and knowledge to defend our rights
These leaders in suits tell us to fight for one side
You think they got their sons and daughters on the front line?
Not down for war but down to get an education
We're all equal yet they push synthetic separation
But in this matrix, I won't be failin' to make it
This is my cosmos baby, space sailin' with Sagan
I heard it's not where your from it's where you're carvin' your view
I heard you don't have to wear a suit to argue the truth
And so

Who are you to tell me how to live my life
'Cause I won't give this up
These are my shoes, my view
My cue to say I do give a fuck
And pretty soon I'ma bloom and it'll be all right
Every day's another chance to ignite
'Cause I'm addicted (uh-oh), I'm addicted (uh-oh)
I'm addicted to this universal feeling called life

""We're through the region of maximum dynamic pressure now"" ""Yeah, they finally gave me a window to look out""
""Visual is Go today""
""And ignition""

They spoon feed but I won't be takin' that sedative
'Cause my thoughts are way too precious to waste on the negative
I keep them critical yet positive to break the chains
Every dawn is a new chance to make a change
Think about all the energy swirling all around us
We project it, we get affected, this is profound stuff
Earth is my garden and I grew from it
I pay the youth homage 'cause I know their view's honest
Can you read between the lines of the news comments
Fightin' over land just to take some fuel from itI guess oil boils down to some cool profits
But war, what is it good for? Really, who wants it?
Like

Who are you to tell me how to live my life
'Cause I won't give this up
These are my shoes, my view
My cue to say I do give a fuck
And pretty soon I'ma bloom and it'll be all right
Every day's another chance to ignite

Art House Audio,Running On Air,2010,"Man I venture to find, life's adventure is mine
Enter the mind of the lemon on the assembly line
With the heart of a lifesaver swimmer
When I'm pounding through the arctic, it's the ice breaker skipper
Life pace depicter, sky scraper swinger
In flight late in winter, it's that night raven singer
In a dark world with the mind state of splinter
The light ray emitter when my mic paints the picture
Topic synergy mixed with exotic imagery
I'm the conductor of this cosmic hypnotic symphony
So witness me, dancing in the spot bruh
The ghost in the machine, it's the phantom of this opera
Let's find the truth behind America's hit and run
As they heard me rearing and tearing through Area 51
The ants scurry under the eye of Echelon
Let's get in orbit, let's revive the renaissance
Look at history, half of it is mistold
'Cause the winner writes it in this atmospheric fish globe
The grand vista, truth is the best ally
And that's the clutch point through the hoop and the net shall I
Continue till we're together in reality?
Look how far we've come, we're Magellans of the galaxy
See the dots you connect and sew the tapestry
Then stand back from life's mosaic masterpiece

Rebels with the hunger to win
That's why three cheeky devils just got under your skin

I'm a soldier of the sun with a gun that blows roses
Did what they said we couldn't, now look who's the no hopers?
We can touch God through the power of a crowd
Bush bashing with the butcher knife, how you like me now?
They call me Mister Magic when I handle a track
I'm from a world where the rabbit pulls the man out the hat
So come along, there's nothing wrong with seeing Max on a bear's back
With a bong singing songs in his trackies and Air Max
Yo, they want me to leave it or love it I'd rather keep it and fuck it
'Cause this reefer I'm puffin' has got me deep in discussion
And nobody is as free as Eso
I spin the mind out like a BMX spoke
I was sent with a destiny to protect my own pedigree
Keep this kept in your memory and I'll bet you'll remember me
This is mental telepathy on the edge of the cemetery
Where the devil eventually has to step to my weaponry
I'm got infinite ammo, I'm like a ninja in camo
I sit in the shadows and spit like the tip of an arrow
I shoot shit with the sparrows until I master the pain
Pardon the flames, carving my name in the park when it rains
In the garden of chains, we get lost in the labrynth
Even using half of my brain, bitch watch what'll happen
So, do you really think you're faster than my blade?
'Cause I got a liquid sword and I'ma park it in your face

Rebels with the hunger to win
That's why three cheeky devils just got under your skin",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-art-house-audio-lyrics

Coastal Kids,Running On Air,2010,"Man I kick shit daily
See the scene change flip backgrounds
Roll the rim of the island and put my tracks down
Tight linguistics, quite descriptive
With the boom, the bat, the bam, well damn I rip shit
Hug the shoreline rapping the land
It's the radical band, sailing on a Catamaran
By the seaside life on the beach road
Far north, south west, down south, east coast

I don't know but it feels so easy
Coastal kids who just sing in the sea breeze
Who am I to judge? We just kick it, it's like
Boom, bat, bam, hot damn!
I don't know but it feels so easy
Coastal kids who just sing in the sea breeze
Who am I to judge? We just kick it, it's like
Boom, bat, bam, hot damn!

Yeah
From Manly, Maroubra to Margaret river
If you ain't been down you only get half the picture
Populated skateparks where they pass the liquor
Being broke's no joke so I'm laughing with ya
I'm like a, father figure for kids without guidance
Life, respect women, bitches bring violence
The hot shot with the heart of a sailor
That's chopped pot with like half of Australia
Birthday, bathroom, cocaine bumps
Fuck blow, I'm for the kids making home-made jumps
Kickflipping the beat, on a hot day watch mate
You can see off the rocks face crops blaze
A community of unity and handshakes
And truthfully there's beauty in our landscape
So if you're rockin' a hoody or watching the footy, it doesn't matter
We’re all fam, call me cousin Macka

I don't know but it feels so easy
Coastal kids who just sing in the sea breeze
Who am I to judge? We just kick it, it's like
Boom, bat, bam, hot damn!
I don't know but it feels so easy
Coastal kids who just sing in the sea breeze
Who am I to judge? We just kick it, it's like
Boom, bat, bam, hot damn!
Who am I to judge? We just kick it, it's like
Boom, bat, bam, hot damn!

To all my beach bombers, each summer holding it down
Where the free runner's feet hover over the town
Raft up at the marina, leisure and pleasure
Float and bash of boats, all tethered together
Good times, laid back and out on the free range
Easy going folks bring about a sea change
Starlit sky, high above the land
Beach lights burn, campfires in the sand
Hear the acoustics, let the tune touch me
Under the moon kids cane dune buggies
BMX Bandits that ride through the calm breeze
Skateboard wheels glide through the palm trees
What a paradise, look around clockwise
From Bell's beach round to boogie down Bondi
Surfers ride right through life's tube
A nice view when the sky view's bright blue

I don't know but it feels so easy
Coastal kids who just sing in the sea breeze
Who am I to judge? We just kick it, it's like
Boom, bat, bam, hot damn!
I don't know but it feels so easy
Coastal kids who just sing in the sea breeze
Who am I to judge? We just kick it, it's like
Boom, bat, bam, hot damn!

This has got guts like the rush in the surfer's head
When he's out there, staring down a perfect set
The dream's extreme, you'll earn your rep
To make an average motherfucker turn to nervous wreck
Let the sun set in the west and rise in the east
Life at work, getting high on the beach
I'm a lit cannon, you bitch rappers, I split atoms
And I came like I made the same shit happen
Hugging the coast line, sea shore residence
Hugging the coast line

Down by the River,Running On Air,2010,"I'm in the back of a ute and I'm freshly serving
BnE brew I got a esky bursting
From doing loops and a rexy burning
To the babble of this beat started jet ski surfing
I, keep keep it I keep I keep on it
Dig beats deep as a creek and speak sonic
The waves I'm making capsize canoes
You can bathe in the wake to baptize your crew
When I'm down by the river, banging from Sydney
Hand on my outboard fanging my dinghy
Streams run free, all over the globe
Still water runs deep, so go with this flow
As long as the Amazon, as deep as the Congo
The heart of the party, the beats on the bongo
A bonfire is the inner camp visual
Werewolves howl at the river bank ritual

Down by the river, learnt how to swim
Where the records play and wash away all the stress that's been
It fuelled my fire higher
It took me higher, higher
Up and up and up let's go
Come on come on come on, let go

Yeah, funhouse is open
And now the sundowns approaching
The boatshed is where I live it up all day
And magic mushrooms litter the walkway
To a gumtree swing for the hot sun
Where we fish off the dock with a shotgun
And a BMX track out the back not giving a shit with a pig on the spit
And you can bet your bottom dollar there's a bong or two
We got the backyard looking like Taronga zoo
With a fluro skyline, bats in the distance
Fact, you won't catch Max doing dishes
We got an AK, shooting clay pigeons
And Izm on the decks banging Gravediggaz
And if the cops come and stop the beat
That's when I let a pack of Ridgebacks off the leash

Down by the river, learnt how to swim
Where the records play and wash away all the stress that's been
It fuelled my fire higher
It took me higher, higher
Up and up and up, let's go
Come on come on come on, let go
It fuelled my fire higher
It took me higher higher
Up and up and up let's go
Come on come on come on, let go

It's the time on the clock when the train goes
So I glide off the pot on a rainbow
See my sight at the top of the range rose
And I'm right on the dot when I aim bro
I just ride down the block wearing plain clothes
With the eye of a croc-killing cane toad
When I'm live in the spot of the main grove
I love to here the whole crowd say ""AYO""
And not a second of silence
BnE worldwide repping the island
It's so much when their bopping and their vibing
So go nuts like a rocket in a silo
Drunk in a dinghy, actin like pirates
The boat that rocked once Macca got violent
Bad to the bone on a Hanzo classic
While kids backflip on a jumbo mattress
So bounce, and let your hair down
Up the body count and let off spare rounds
And don't hurt no one, and don't touch my perso punk
So, take it from me I stay on the top when they're shaking the tree
Yeah, and in a matter of minutes no matter the limit
I rap and I rip it so you know Big Macca done did it

Down by the river, learnt how to swim
Where the records play and wash away all the stress that's been
It fuelled my fire higher
It took me higher, higher
Up and up and up let's go
Come on come on come on, let go",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-down-by-the-river-lyrics

Never, ever, ever take no shit

My Dad taught me how to handle the riff raff
And Mum bought the paint first time I did graff
One time for the fam' that you got
Granny got a gun and never ran from the cops
So I stand on this rock with a Zen mentality
And drift this bitch 'til we bend reality
My bloodline bangs when I handle the beat
So don't bark up my family tree
I say what you think but I'm not a mind reader
I'm good to my girl but I wear a wife-beater
Happy as fuck when I rap with my cuz
If you're battling him, then you're battling us
A world full of wolves, who's the leader of the pack?
When they teach you how to act, try to keep you in a trap
Conditioned 'til you're blue in the face

Though it's hardly a job cause the two forms refuses
I'm an uncle now, with a newborn nephew
Flowers grew, ground broke with the buzz
Jam with my fam', sound voce with my cuz
We don't say it enough, so, from all of my band
I'm a take a second now to give it up to all of my fans
I just stand in the kitchen
With a plan and a vision, I'm a man on a mission
With my folk on a Friday, soak in the light rays
Carolina, blue sky, coast on the highway
On track, fired up and steam-powered
Never listen to the dream-doubters they're the bean counters
Join the mental, consequential song writer
Lit the island up, like a continental bonfire

My Grandma told me
Never, never, never take no shit

I don't budge mate, you ain't got what it takes
Got Tinkerbell's magic dust and I'm saddled up
Down at the jam, rattled up in a cattle truck
Paint those pics with the pallet of a dreamer
Make those sick and rally the arena
Take no shit, we were revved up from the start
To the sleepers we were the bedbugs in the dark
In this pool won't shed blood for the sharks
The best drug is the head rush from the art
I remember when Grandma would make the meals
My uncle didn't like bikes with training wheels
And me and mum would work at local markets
For tax-free cash with a backseat dad
Which makes me the man of the house
With a girl and a great dane, hand me the crown

All engines go, yo, I'm ready for blast off
We've been in the building, They're looking for car spots
I got the pedal to the metal in a monster truck
A full tank and a constant rush
I just jump to the front like a track at Daytona
With a super fat twenty-eight pack of crayolas
I colour the canvas
, I'm the tycoon of my tunes
I fly through like a typhoon at high noon
I'm a runaway slave on a runaway train
Trying to turn pain to a summer day rave
Motherfuckers make way 'cause I spit like a shotgun
I'm here to stay like bitch I got top bunk
From the boy who dared to dream to be bigger
The supersonic sunset sight scenery flipper
The stereo slideshow, blaze a bag of good crop
Here we go, my folk wave the flag of Woodstock
The visual is epic, my lyrics are a head-trip
And trust when I bust I got the minerals to bless it
They're all sheep to my cattle dog rhyming
'Cause my fleet's more street then the Paddle pop lion

It's all right in the city, people look nice, kind of pretty
Even though it's a little dirty, it's all right in the city

If you know where to go

Boombox on blast, blazed in a Kombi
I walk what I talk and it's shaking the concrete
Chase my jet stream, I'm going into the heavens
A great escape where I live as a legend
So press play and set it to soothe
The styles us, making waves when we get in the groove
They hear us broadcast from a beautiful bungalow
Our rumble grows like the hooves of the buffalo
So go, go, Johnny, go, go, go
Go Johnny go
So B'n'E, the black sheep have you any wool
Yes sir, yes sir, three lads full
And I roll with dope rhymes and a lot of kin
Hitting summertime coastline metropolitans
Flying through the lights in the centre of the civic
One life, bet I'm going to live it, going to bend her to the limit

It's all right in the city, people look nice, kind of pretty
Even though it's a little dirty, it's all right in the city
If you know where to go
If you know where to go

I'm a mad monkey having lunch with stray cats
On a grand brumby with the luck of saint pat
In my damn undies with a blunt and 8-track
Mad hungry like I'm Nudge from Hey Dad
I'm on a level that you'll never be mate
You'd need to finish every game that's ever been made
So get ready for my Syd City committee
Moose dog Macka, shitty bo bitty
In my hang glider, got my eye socket in my Spy Optics
I been hot, slingshot in my sky rocket
Fly in my flock, air platoon
Pop the pop, one hit wonder hot air balloons
Drop the top in the summer, got to blare the tunes
I'm a skinny white boy, give papa bear some room
Shit we rock no matter the weather
The bold B'n'E is back, bigger, badder, better and we're

It's all right in the city, people look nice, kind of pretty
Even though it's a little dirty, it's all right in the city

It's the warmth when it's cold and it's storming
It's drifting off to the sound of the rain
It's getting up, kicking goals in the morning
It's lifting off from the ground with your flame
It's the strength to withstand life lessons
It's the clock as the hand strikes seconds
It's my movie, where every memory's another colour I collect to expand my spectrum
It's the simple days
Childhood here now, then it's gone in an instant
Back when the wall around my world was a little too high to see beyond in the distance
It's the smell of my mitt in the fresh grass
Little league and the times that I'm so free
It's snow days, Martachello park
When the sleds hit the hills and they're flying through the oak trees
It's the kid who collects cards
Back in '91 summertime coming out the store, and
It's the fact he's unwrapping the pack with a smile on his dial cause he's scoring the Jordan
Past times, I hold 'em dear
It's Maryland, Virginia, bold and clear
The way the leaves on those trees in the streets would fall
In the fall all to paint my golden years and yeah

When the sky is gray, I live on light rays
I've written every page of my life's play
I've drawn through my eyes, I've coloured outside the lines
Trynna hold these golden years that are flashing by
When the sky is gray, I live on light rays
I've written every page of my life's play
I've drawn through my eyes, I've coloured outside the lines
Trynna hold these golden years that are flashing by

It's a bumpy road
Trynna steer through the years of a genius
Can't conceal what I feel, this is real and the deal is it heals like the tears from a phoenix
And I remember those days with my dad
In the great outdoors getting raised by the land
Not knowing how hard life gets
Call me Huckleberry when I start my quest
So jump on my cloud, sit back and lounge
My wings are the size of a rich rapper's house
I'll never leave, so picture a viking who's
Memory is like Christian the Lion
That was me going town to town
On fireworks night you couldn't count me out
My mate's older brothers had a hundred of the buggers
Take cover cause we nearly burned down the house
I remember when they took away my Wu-Tang
Sitting there till the bell in my school rang
Playing pool on the cool where the rules are abused
My adventure to the center where the youth hang
And grandma's, we'd visit every journey
A living room stage where I'd mimic Eddie Murphy
Or kid and play, I'd play delirious
So damn much they couldn't take me serious

When the sky is gray, I live on light rays
I've written every page of my life's play
I've drawn through my eyes, I've coloured outside the lines

I can space travel when I got it in my lung
Clouds, step planets, spitting hotter than the sun
Faster than a bullet from a gun
With the logic of tongue, squashing beef before any killings done
I can chill on one, blood on a vibe
Talking to the earth mother now I'm on the other side
Stare God in the eye till my vision is blind
Cuz the sun is the God and the wisdom is the light

Yo, I can do this, I can do that, I can make the
Whole map react from where I be at
I can do this, I can do that, I can make the
Whole map react from where I be at
Ayo, I can do this, I can do that, I can make the
Whole map react from where I be at
Ayo, I can do this, I can do that, I can make the
Whole map react from where I be at

We can fly tons of steel through the sky as an airplane
Shit we can move mountains with our bare brains
Ambition is the call to fight for me
I don't have to join an army to be all that I can be
I can call it how I see, I can exercise free speech
I can walk the beach with the fresh sky sea breeze
I can track my path in the sand through my footprints
I can capture life's garden in a book's ink
They pin us with the cruel thumb of fear
But I can see their game and the truth's coming clear
I can feel the rain like cool summer tears
And I can come back in a few hundred years
Look at our track record, our favourite high achievers
The common thread is, I can all bright believers
I can hurdle every single obstacle
With training, man you're optimal and anything is possible

Yo, I can do this, I can do that, I can make the
Whole map react from where I be at
I can do this, I can do that, I can make the
Whole map react from where I be at
Ayo, I can do this, I can do that, I can make the
Whole map react from where I be at
Ayo, I can do this, I can do that, I can make the
Whole map react from where I be at

We can send people into space and use laughter as medicine
And drop bombs behind the mask of a president
I can see through the lies of the government
I can hit rock bottom and then pick myself up again
I can free myself from being tied up in prison
I can go the distance, I can mindfuck the system
I can pick the lock, crack the code, ship this off, stack the load
You can find me on a misty dock packing cones
But I'm high without the pleasures of a drug
And I can change my girl's mood with a gesture of my love
I can master my courage to fight another day
I can bend that spoon that tried to run away
I can tame the rage of a cage full of primates
I can spit with Jehst and put the H in the right place
So, I guess it's safe to say now
I can fall down the rabbit hole and make my way out

Yo, I can do this, I can do that, I can make the
Whole map react from where I be at
I can do this, I can do that, I can make the
Whole map react from where I be at
Ayo, I can do this, I can do that, I can make the
Whole map react from where I be at
Ayo, I can do this, I can do that, I can make the
Whole map react from where I be at

Late One Night,Running On Air,2010,"Yo, yo, yo
Straight from the shed with a shovel in my hand
My bible's a rifle, you gotta understand
That the streets need a weapon
And out here, the sheep need a shepherd
So as long as I'm here you won't witness evil
I'mma rhyme to a sky full of Christmas beetles where
Mind power cracks the code
My welcome mat to a happy home
Rattling bones and a broken compass
Watch me use those bones as drumsticks
Bam-Bam it's bedrock baby
Ringing the alarm that we set off daily
Gone with the wind when I'm out the sunroof
I sleep on the gas in a money pair of gumboots
In the back is my lucky dingo
And he attacks like a punch from Kimbo
Slice, dice, scratch my lyrics
Yeah see my DJ,
 yeah that's my lizard
Still there when the ship is sinking
'Cuz we're the kings of wishful thinking
In the house that lays in my head
And if sun was money there were days that I've spent
With my face to the fence
Speechless, until I made you my friend
That's when your mates came by
Said ""listen to this"" and you did
With headphones on in a zone unknown
Now I'm glad you know where I live (right here)
Together we stand, divided we fall
To play this game, keep your eyes on the ball
Live for the minute
Die for the culture
And see through the dark when the violet is ultra

Smoke don't rise, fuel don't burn
Sun don't shine no more
Late one night, sorrow come around
Scratching at my door
But I cut my hands and break my back
Dragging this bag of stones
'Til they bury me down beneath the ground
With dust and rattling

I just daydream
From the front seat of a Hum-vee
Press eject and bungee to Jumanji
The place where the rhinos rumble
Spread far like the hydro hustle
In the jungle fall with chainsaws
Sell faith to walk through maze walls
Free thinkers, free talkers
Waltz on water like sea walkers
Rise up, levitate like this
'Til time's up, celebrate life's gifts
Paint pop culture like Warhol
With the words that I churn from my portal
An electric lightning bolt sky
Dive inside my kaleidoscope eyes
The vision is a sight to see
There shouldn't be a place on Earth where life is cheap
Space pirate, cat with golden wings
Raise your sail, catch your solar wind
I just write away, have a story
Cats cook in their hideaway laboratories
Let it simmer, bubbling slow
Beers in the bin, bud in the bowl
Never pursuing piles of paper
My office desktop is DOS invaders
My band spans the high and low frequencies
Love life in its idiosyncrasies
Simply called a rap with friends
Another artistic awesome accident
This is for you, I stand in the rain
With a vista view to champion change
Until it's late and my canvas is stained
When the paint's sprayed and the canister's drained

Smoke don't rise, fuel don't burn
Sun don't shine no more
Late one night, sorrow come around
Scratching at my door
But I cut my hands and break my back
Dragging this bag of stones
'Til they bury me down beneath the ground
With dust and rattling",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-late-one-night-lyrics
Never Land,Running On Air,2010,"You might think that there’s. . .there’s many. . .many kinds of people in this world. But there’s only two kinds: The buyers and the ones that get bought. No, there’s another kind

What kind?

It’s a kind that don’t belong no place at all. There’s a kind of bird that don’t have any legs so it can’t alight on nothing. So it has to spend its whole life on its wings in the air. I seen one, once.  And its wings spread out that wide. And you could see right through them. That’s why the hawks don’t catch them. . .because they don’t see ‘em. They don’t see ‘em way up in that high blue sky near the sun

What about in gray weather?

They fly so high, in gray weather, the hawks, they’d get dizzy. See, these little birds don’t have no legs at all so they have to live their whole lives on the wing. And they sleep on the wind. That’s what they do, they just. . . they just spread their wings out and go to sleep on the wind",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-never-land-lyrics

In Syd' City with Aussie chicks with huge titties

We bring it back and let Biz mark the damn beat
They tried to tell me that I couldn't have a dream
Now I'm knocking 'em and boxing 'em like I was Danny Green
Plotting with a battle axe under the mill

Yo, I've come for the kill, time's up, rise up
And anyone in our way can take a whiff of my nuts
I got kush in the bush, bangin' beats 'til the shack's shook
And X is rolling blunts out a pack of Backwoods
I'm that good sweetie, seven days on this Earth
Fuck watch me bloody making a verse

The revolution's brewing man, you should see behind the curtain

Rocking this banger as I hit the circuit droppin' the hammer

It's the next level rebels in and out of elevators
My whirlwind, fell the valley of the vortex
Twenty-eight thousand strong rallied at your doorstep
So rise up man, we're holding up the common kids
It's the hang glider rider rollin' off a monster cliff
Taking flight with my chosen flock of congregates
Known to drop the bombs a bit and boulder hop the continents
On the roller-coaster goin' over the Pacific
Sunset strip, vivid, blowin' dosha with Xzibit
Aim for the stars, it's the kid who rides comets

Reflections,Running On Air,2010,"Well I've been
Running round this globe for a couple o' spins now
Grown from school days the outcast from the in crowd
I keep my chin down as time flies and seasons vanish
Hold the self-belief to manage grip and seize my canvas
Paint the colour that connects with me and speaks my language
Try to release my baggage be free to relieve the anguish
When it's freezing cold feel the warmth between my toes
Of this earth I walk, creation is what feeds my soul
It can ease the load climbing on the steepest road
So I preach this ode to remind myself to keep control
When it's all too much and I dive to free fall
I try to centre myself on the centre of life's see-saw
I crave the fun times, the sunshine entices
Of wandering temptation and unwind my vices
From the drugs to the girls and the beers I'm drinking
And remember what's at staking staring in the mirror thinking

Well I've been down this road before
It's been one hell of a ride
The challenge is to balance on that fine line
Between the earth and sky
And I will wait for the morning sun
Till the way is clear as day
Well ok hallelujah
Now watch me take the stage
Oh a oh
Oh a oh
Oh a oh
Oh a oh yeah

It's the hunt for the high, the people I've met, the places I've seen (ohh)
The stories I've told, the forks in the road chasing my dream (woahh)
On the brink stop and think I'm telling you dreams don't cost a thing
I know we all die alone but I feel faith within that cosmic link
I surf the starlight where every wish is worthy
Only happy when you've got it often makes you miss the journey
Coincide with chemistry, flow and ride my energy
We'll grow our grass greener than that other side will ever be
The man on the mic, the rose on my drum kit
Happy with my reflection even though I've done dumb shit
And sometimes I think of stuff keen to get that instant rush
Fiending for that pick me up that's probably why I drink too much
It's not the feeling of the high when you're running round
It's the friends that you find when you're coming down
From smooth sailing to foggy rocky roads
I won't be faked by my reflection like that dog that dropped his bone

Well I've been down this road before
It's been one hell of a ride
The challenge is to balance on that fine line
Between the earth and sky
And I will wait for the morning sun
Till the way is clear as day
Well ok hallelujah
Now watch me take the stage
Oh a oh

Worldwide Hip Hop, let's go
(Check the script, me and the Gods getting ripped)

Dressed up like the Joker
Ready for a good night
Happy on the handlebars of a push bike
(What it look like)
It look's like the Wu's in this
And I'm about to blow this booth to bits
So buckle up, click clack front and back
I'm on point bi*ch
They'll never win against a double headed coin flip
Spitting pictures with the RZA, howling
All the way from Syd city to Shaolin
The King Kong chief chonga
Big bonger, beat bomber
Double barrel cone puncher, bone crusher
The stone chucker with devils in his eyes
I can't tell if this is hell, or heaven in disguise
Either way I'm 'a spit rounds of dope shit
I even taught bliss how to smoke, bitch
So why so serious?
Puts your fist in the air for this hydro lyricist

Smoke like a fire, drink like a fish
Hope when I'm broke, Think like I'm rich

Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip)
Smoke like a fire, drink like a fish

Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip)

I had a nightmare, that I slept for a light year
A thousand tracks was going in my right ear
Then I found myself trapped in a circle
With Eso and Bliss pza-puffing on that purple, bong
You trapped me in the closet like my girls shoe
Hip-hop done changed the whole world's view
I mighty like Joe Young, my son carries a blow gun
We roam like we're chased by the Shogun
Lou Pine, wolf and cub, cut your arm to a knob
Fill your body with holes they can't plug
Leave you with pains in your head that they can't drug
You covered in plastic, lying flat on my rug
This is the microphone bullying boy
Don't try to strike me
It's Crooklyn, do the right thing like Spike Lee
For real, once I get a puff on that ill
I get wild like Uma trying to Kill Bill

Smoke like a fire, drink like a fish
Hope when I'm broke, Think like I'm rich

Smoke like a fire, drink like a fish
Hope when I'm broke, Think like I'm rich
(Check the script, me and the Gods getting ripped
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip)

Deep in the woods, out in a lonely cabin
Chronic capsule flying on my Doshja dragon
The chameleon holographic craft
Bought a bag of hash for an automatic blast
Beam me up Scotty, I'm ascending to the stars
Catch me with the Abbot
Where I'm tending to my gardens
Running on air through the night till the morning
Flying colours
 like killer bees swarming
Buzzing through to BnE town Sydney
Spot my smoke signal out my greenhouse chimney
You'll see in every village
Mary comes to meet us
State to state
Another brother bearing bud to greet us
When we roll through hear us rock all the bells
And I told you it's beer o'clock all is well
So let's all this good reefer
The outcast, outback, racing bush cheetah

Smoke like a fire, drink like a fish
Hope when I'm broke, Think like I'm rich

Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip)
Smoke like a fire, drink like a fish

The Children of The Night,Running On Air,2010,"When the sun’s out, and the moonlight is in
It blankets the land and a new life begins
With headphones on, stargaze lying in a paddock
Feel the veil of the night wrap its inner fabric
Get the picture from the photo spinner’s magic
And let your view go slomo and cinematic
Kids come far and wide to the urban sprawl
All the way to daybreak when it’s curtain call
They scurry in like sweet synchronicity
Moving like music in a street city symphony
When people sleep and the masses shut shutters
Like clockwork, freestyle after dusk buskers
Motor full of mates, late night escapades
Stealth renegades, burners they set ablaze
Paintings flourish all the way down the boulevard
Block party, late, whole street full of cars
Skaters illuminate the bowl with their headlights
Hear the street riders roll when they rev bikes
Nightriders carve the mountain in the valley haze
Covert op, talent sprays in the alleyways
Kids in the palace of play, cloaked in the dark night
Summertime shooting hoops under the park lights
Guerrilla activists seeing freedom clear
Across the globe sticking up, BnE was here

In the evening, when the stars climb
You can see them, children of the night
Through the seasons, on the dark side
In the deep end, children of the night
When the day’s gone and it unwinds
Let them play on till the sunrise
Rise till we’re all in flight
This is for my people who are children of the night

There’s to many places to park down memory lane
So let me simply start when I remembered the rain
Hit the tin roof, while sitting on my balcony
Isolated like a pirate cast out to sea
Intrigued by what those city lights offer
The world is your oyster type shit, and that’s proper
Hypnotised by it’s highs and it’s lows
A lifestyle that keeps your eyes on the road
See there’s searchers on the prowl for that crowbar access
And graffers throwing up those whole car classics
It’s magic to watch the world trying to compete
A tapestry of culture intertwined with the beast
And that’s right where I eat, where the night never sleeps
And all I need’s a mic and a beat for life in the streets
Over years I’ve put strength in pain, standing strong
Writing songs on an empty train, yeah
I’ve lived a life worth of movies framed through my crooked lens
I’ve travelled way beyond where the book will end
I’ve seen the visual effects behind the scenes
I’ve found a whole other world trying to find my dreams
And temptation will test if you can keep your faith
With the smile of a Cheshire cat to lead the way
Under night-lights, we’ll never stop building
So welcome to the city of the lost children

In the evening, when the stars climb
You can see them, children of the night
Through the seasons, on the dark side
In the deep end, children of the night
When the day’s gone and it unwinds
Let them play on till the sunrise
Rise till we’re all in flight
This is for my people who are children of the night

From the kids in the burbs playing capture the flag
To the cans packed in bags, lads attack with their tags
The core elements, forces of sick skills
Back lane breakers in an orbit of windmills
Writers hit the tracks in the yard where the trains stay
The beat spills and it trickles down the laneways
The streets are bubbling, the beats are rumbling
The free runners swing across an urban jungle gym

In the evening, when the stars climb
You can see them, children of the night
Through the seasons, on the dark side
In the deep end, children of the night
When the day’s gone and it unwinds
Let them play on till the sunrise
Rise till we’re all in flight
This is for my people who are children of the night",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-the-children-of-the-night-lyrics
The Moses Twist,Running On Air,2010,"Yeah
Hell Yeah
This that dance where no one's looking
You can do whatever the fuck you feel like doing man
That's the Moses twist to me

I'm the shepherd of these letters
Watch them dance with my essence
Weightless in space with a hand clutching heaven
So answer the question do you like to get down? Hell Yeah
I'll be twisting every time I hit town
Lets bounce to the spot where the ounce of the bar
Where the sound doesn't stop where I found what I lost
Fear doesn't live in my heart or my mind
I've escaped to a place where the stars are aligned
Together forever, we hunt for a new view
Like it only comes once in a blue moon
Let the room spin dust your shoulders off
And let's ride 'til we fly like motocross
Man we'll show the boss, he'll have nothing on us
Well have our little piece of paradise I fucking promise
So, until that day, they'll fear the man of magic
Simply, 'cause his ideas are panoramic

Now everybody do the Moses twist
Now everybody do the Moses twist
I believe they do the Moses twist
Now everybody do the Moses twist
Do the Moses, do the Moses, do the Moses twist
Do the Moses, do the Moses, do the Moses

Yeah
Well I'm back in the kitchen, I bust my transmission
And pour myself a cup of ambition
Attack my plans with the winners execution
This is the twist of my inner revolution
It's the sun and the breeze, it's a clean bill of health
Whether science or religion just believe in yourself
The real leap of faith when you're lost in trance
Deep in space as we spin in this cosmic dance
Summer time highway just me and my girl
The movement to be the change you want to see in the world
The corrupt and tangled network run by annual net worth
I fly head first with the love to stand and rep earth
So part the sea man, make your own advancements
A step of independence, obey your own commandments
And live your opus, wake up and sniff the roses
And waltz through your world wind with a twist of Moses, Soldiers

Do the Moses, do the Moses, do the Moses twist
Do the Moses, do the Moses, do the Moses twist
Do the Moses, do the Moses, do the Moses twist
Do the Moses, do the Moses, do the Moses
[Verse 3 - Bliss & 
Eso
]
I eclipse when I twist with my missus and our dog
Love freeze framed like a visit from the gods
It's the wizards of the Oz with the colours on the easel
It's my worlds nature, the mother of my people
It's the sun dance, moon walk
, swing of my system
The boogie to my beat
 with my wings making rhythm
On the ocean of emotion
, it's the choir of the pirates
The chance of a lifetime
, the fire in my iris

Out on these open planes
I'll touch the stars above
Face to face with my fate
I know it's hard to touch
Out on these open planes
I'll touch the stars above
Face to face with my fate
I know it's hard to touch

Now everybody do the Moses twist, now everybody do the Moses twist
Now do the Moses twist, now everybody do the Moses twist
Now do the Moses twist, now everybody do the Moses twist
Now do the Moses twist, now everybody do the Moses twist
Do the Moses, do the Moses, do the Moses twist

Weightless Wings,Running On Air,2010,"A wise man once said we exist in a bizzare combination of
Stone age emotions medieval beliefs
God-like technology many people can reach
I can sit on the beach see the sky turn violet red
While moving through a planetary spiderweb
See the jungle through the eye of the tigers head
Black hat hackers fight from their lions den
While truth lives and dreams that go free
We got rickety boats bursting at the seams with refugees
Check it
While some kids fight just to make the honor roll
Other kids fight just to claim the waterhole
And you know it, the moment the air is motionless
Compassionate emotions stick when your ocean shifts
And I don't trust my TV news caster
My world flips likes a 3D view master
Look out the window and put it in a paragraph
Watching life travel past back in cattle-class
Harness the beat and the passion that your heart gives
The Noah Ark kid, captain of his starship
Don't let him tell you different to all you school kids
Being smart is cool, prepare your mental toolkits
And with this knowledge start to gauge your bandwidth
The architecture of science and art can change the planet
I got the fresh force
I hopped and leapt forth
So check it mate, I'm the pawn to cross the chessboard

Sometimes they try to break me down (hey-ooh)
Other times I feel safe and sound (hey-ooh)
And I don't know why I'm weightless now
But I'm guessing it's because we're running on air
Sometimes they try to break me down (hey-ooh)
Other times I feel safe and sound (hey-ooh)
And I don't know why I'm weightless now
But I'm guessing it's because we're running on air

I was told that life is as easy as can be
But apparently the tragedy is freedom isn't free
I've been bleeding on this beat and spilling my guts
At the last supper where the gods fill up my cup
See the truth is, it's all in your head
And time will only stop still when your wings are spread
There's no map to buy for the trail to my heart
So I'll be coming home after I sail to the stars
And that kid hovers high yelling live, love or die
While he swallows caterpillas and spits butterflies
With a mic and a molotov missiles on a message
It's a lunar eclipse when I'm listening to records
I brainstorm to rid the taxes and change laws
The worlds on course to clash with the claymore
The captain that came forth packing a chainsaw
I never knocked, I took an axe to the stage door
I'm like the ever-lit match when the rain pours
A legend to my friends coming back from a great tour
The true cruisader stands up to the man
Mind Over Matter turns handcuffs into sand
It's contained in a flame and it lives in a heart beat
So fuck this party man, give me the car keys
I wanna give like Mr. Smith in Seven Pounds
To change my brain to a plane that never grounds

Sometimes they try to break me down (hey-ooh)
Other times I feel safe and sound (hey-ooh)
And I don't know why I'm weightless now
But I'm guessing it's because we're running on air
Sometimes they try to break me down (hey-ooh)
Other times I feel safe and sound (hey-ooh)
And I don't know why I'm weightless now
But I'm guessing it's because we're running on air
Sometimes they try to break me down (hey-ooh)
Other times I feel safe and sound (hey-ooh)
And I don't know why I'm weightless now
But I'm guessing it's because we're running on air

Has gone from love, to a thug with a million dollar watch
But see I'm talking 'bout the jungle, the outback, the city I live in
That cunt that'll always bounce back with a witty dominion
An ill flow like this and a 'still don't like pigs' attitude is what I got
I'm flipping, I'm tripping, I'm puffing on pot
So don't even think to sleep on me cuz I'm a dodgy mattress
I've figured it out, I'm the king of the house, I'm a flying flock of axes
I'm going vampire killing with stakes in me holsters
Shooting them down, ripping the faces off vultures
The trolley's full of goodies for the kids
So rat-a-tat-tat Big Macka is back and I'm loading of the dick
What up cunt

Are you still with us or what?
Let's make some noise for the state of Australian hip hop

There's blood and there's guts coming out of the speakers
There's fire in my veins and it's right off the metre
With a fist in the sky I'ma fly like an eagle
Come on, hit me again
Come on, well shit there it is

I'm plugged in, the sound is connected
Rise up, the crowd is electric
A place with Zen good nature
I'm the shore, your 10 foot breakers
It's fun when I'm out and about and I'm bouncing around in summers naked sun
Naturally high when I breathe in the breeze and I run full steam through mother nature's lungs
I'm ripping and snipping the rhythm like Izm, my man on the decks, no-one cuts quicker
Let's proclaim ourselves free and make a principality like up at Hutt River
Head out the window, the air sings
Howling, tearing through hair pins
It's the crazy rap vocalist
Monster truck maniac motorist
Power up, lock into the socket
Pull a Johnny rocket out my pocket
Ride a lightning comet
I write these sonnets with a spice of comics
Fresh, ripe and honest
I pick up the pieces like I was a hunter-gatherer
Inspired by life, our people leave deep dents up in the punter barrier

There's blood and there's guts coming out of the speakers
There's fire in my veins and it's right off the metre
With a fist in the sky I'ma fly like an eagle
Come on, hit me again
Come on, well shit there it is

In the search for fame everyone wanna be bigger than Kurt Cobain
After he burst his brain and left his curtain stained
What do ya think?
I think it's bad for them to stare at the sun
Save my soul with a flare and a gun
You can find me on tour nightly
I'll be lightin' up a stick like Hermione
Excuse me miss if I ransack your handbag
Flow so heavy the damn track needs Tampax
I'm so good I spell M.O.M with an X and a zillion F's and it's still correct
Tripping in a theme park with a ski mask
This house is where the wild things are
Playing with fire, allude the darkness
Where shooting stars are just moving targets
On the highway to hell with a stronger engine
Grow the fuck up like crops in Nimbin
Big league now, gotta move a little tougher
Take to the plate with a Louisville Slugger
I'm getting drunk with angels to keep the blood pumping like jumper cables

Mind Over Matter in the building!
You know it!
BNE and M.O.M. knockin it out the park!
Why don't you think outside the box like a new born baby!

There's blood and there's guts coming out of the speakers
There's fire in my veins and it's right off the metre
With a fist in the sky I'ma fly like an eagle
Come on, hit me again
Come on, well shit there it is",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-where-the-wild-things-are-lyrics
Dreams,The Arrival,2000,"*If you believe you can achieve, just look at me*
*If you believe you can achieve, just look at me*

Dreams are you
Dreams will come true
Dreams are you
Dreams will come true

As I awake from a brush with fate, relate and listen
To Blissnesoterik, share it for all who question
To clarify their existance crossing canals 
... distance
I feel your resistance, as you fall into that stone throne 
... shown
Your mind contents, this song hence
Ain't living blossom nonsense it's driven by subconscience
At the wheels of steel, through the memories back to past years
The fears burst out like tears but when the fog clears
I'm thinking can it be another fantasy, I'm chilling on a rainforest canopy
My mind's amnesty
Makes my thoughts free in creation
With my, imagination and my, aspirations
Plus I hate it when people tell me their dreams, rather pursuing than procrastinating
Believe, achieve and you'll be doing them once you conquer your mind, that's essential
Getting lifted, with gifted potential you build an expedential
I'm out 
... you do enhance the world and lose to the chance
Change you life, yeah

Dreams are you (these dreams are you)
Dreams will come true (yeah, yeah they will come true)
Dreams are you
Dreams will come true
Dreams, everybody has 'em imagine of what you want to happen to make the action
You only live once  energy
That's the essence of dreams

Check it, my eyes open to the broken laws, that now are open doors
Esoterik's for the cause, who's ready for our revolution
Excel the evolution, there's enough elevation to have a solution
But is life just a dream  floating upstream, the world's going crazy
And I'm stuck in between, the unseen will never come clean
But some seem to only keep their eyes on one dream
You need to, expand like the sand on a beach
Or water to the ocean, a bird to the sky
Observe how I fly, Esoterik's on the case I'm still berzerk when I'm high, yes
Nothing else is comparing to this, it's Esoterik and Bliss
Down deep I know everybody's baring a wish to be free, fly away to a brighter day
Like tomorrow's today, that's how, one should think
Ink sinks into my pad when I'm writing rhymes
Inspiring minds, not just reciting these lines
I bring falling avalanches, taking chances
Yes I'm breaking branches, off the Buddha Tree
Who was he, turning a blind eye to opportunity
Trust me, there's always space to expand
I'm knee deep in the sand like Egypt
I keep this pure and positive so you can see this
Through the bullshit the fools get forgotten
And fall victim to the Izm and this is how it's like
When I write a rhythm it's Esoterik and I'm out
*If you believe you can achieve, just look at me*
*If you believe you can achieve, just look at me*

Dreams are you
Dreams will come true
Dreams are you
Dreams will come true
Dreams, everybody has 'em imagine of what you want to happen to make the action
You only live once  energy
That's the essence of dreams",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-dreams-lyrics
Next Shit,The Arrival,2000,"Hmm, damn, that shit dolo

Esoterik one time
Future bright like sunshine
I set it off of one rhyme
You're curious so come find what you're looking for
The essence that shook the floor
I get it hot and cook em all
I'm motivated so I look for more
Yeah, you can catch me chillin'
I got the killer's skills you won't match me villian
Because good triumphs over evil
But through my eyes people are equal
It's just a matter of time
Before I shatter your mind
Gather the signs
Only to present you with a ladder to climb
At the top picture a place in your mind
That you've never been
Beyond what you've ever seen
Conjure up a better dream
My style stays forever green
My goal is forever seen
I dream unseen it seems to have never been
A problem
So I'm off with the fairies to have a session with the goblin

Bliss and Esoterik
On the next shit check it
Did you expect it?
Check it out, yo

As I clamber like a panda
I hurdle verbal fences and trenches
And past tenses held in amber
I get a hand decanter
The influences
That give me six senses
Hence since  my context
Huh, and ejects concepts which your shallow
Which reflects erects and gets gallows
To hang em all by necks
Now pay your respects
Now Bliss, a little less complex for all that missed it
This is how ya rip shit
I got realistic statistics
Showin' relative to the chances, a futuristic
Dices
High probability of MC characteristic crisis
Caused by linguistic, devices
Which entices
Artistic slices
To be amputated
The way you made it from related past individuals with lyrical residuals
Dated from back years so
Now relative to the way you're evaluated and most likely degraded
Oh yeah, B L I to the double S N
I'm out with the E to the SO

This is the feeling I'm having
Esoteric's how I imagine
The Izm rips the record the rythm that's how it happens
Down with whatever
My lyrics brought the weather together forever we're clever my rhyme will always remember
Wipe you're feet before you enter the centre
I'm livin' my dreams and my life's an adventure
I picture rivers running
My visions coming
Clearer, I steer a car off a cliff
Lay it down without a part you could miss
Let's take a break and spark up a spliff
It's like that, Bliss come on down and check it",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-next-shit-lyrics
Shogun,The Arrival,2000,"(Hey!)
I admire talent, you might like to join us and earn wealth and fame
I have all the wealth I need
Now then, would you come peacefully? Or must I kill you? 
You think that you can take me on? You are already a dead man
Now we will have to see about that
It's the arrival, Bliss n Esoterik with the primal thoughts which ought
To leave them breathing needing a revival, the final hoard of words
Izm with a vinyl sword, this drama forward put your back to crack
The spinal cord
These rhymes are part of me mentally and we arrived fresh like the
Start of the century and   without a ground thoughts
Break the barricades with broomsticks, there's boof underneath this
Underground force, kids who swung 'round swords, I leave the
Dumbfound floor they get sliced and diced. I guess they're literally
Paying the price, this is lyrically driving, dodging other cars while buzzed off the buddha bouncing off the bumper bar. Thats when the lightning and thunder starts, Surprising the children like diving off buildings. Create a spectacle like a rider. My spirit stays symmetrical like a spider. I light electrical wires on fire. Bring the barbaric beats that bomb your brain life in delirious at the bank where I have gone insane. Leave songs stained for eight weeks of strong rain. Blizzards and bricks and hail. Esoterik's off the Richter scale
Amidst the failure, you're screaming we write the biggest island, but hold up. If you are talking about freestyling without breaking any laws, see? My partner Esoterik will call , Cerebral Palsy. Broccoli. 'Cause we were crippled as fuck. You can't scribble the block. Try suicidal days with tidal waves. Doom like a room with ugly braun phrase. In the vinyl days, you had an idol phase that was whack. Rap's about to come back. See minor leaves. Tripped on the suicidal waves, it hurts and thrashes to curfew where you idol blaze, got the whole area lit, trust me, it's better than that malaria shit. I'm very equipped, I'm very descript, want a scarier tip? I'm stronger than a boom-terrier clip. 'Cause I blow magical dust, Scream when you fall off , but I got news for you buddy. Your whole fuckin' rap's a catastrophy if it makes you feel any better, no one's verses are perfect. Stay true to the words that you wrote. Im wordin', workin'",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-shogun-lyrics
Beer O’clock,The Bliss n Eso Mixtape,2004,"Scuse me Bro - You got a watch?
Yeah
So you know the time then?
Yeah
Well you gonna tell us?
Stick around and find out...
Oh shit

It's beer o clock and all is well
So rally up the lads and everybody sing!
It's beer o clock and all is well
Bro-Bro-Brothers that broke out the loony bin
It's beer o clock and all is well
So rally up the lads and everybody sing!
I found freedom through the tip of my pencil
Top em up, We just did it again!

Man this rap shit is not for those dreamin of cash
It's for my absence which triggers my bohemian lads
We make these dicks smell our skank like a Harlets beaver
We make it hot like scarlet fever, not the market leader
Shoppin for fresh records to admire the taste
But man be careful and always check expiry dates
Yup, another rotten rapper, that fakes it with pride
But pick up bliss n eso's second that's an 8 on it's side
I'm twisted I been in the jungle kissing monkeys
I'm fresh, another colour of your sisters undies
I guess, I'm a cheap bugger, that needs some lovin
But the stress, is just another struggle that keeps me hunting
For a better day, and when you look you miss
Ay yo that better day, probably fucking look like this
My long Johnson dips, where ever the birds flock
My minds a lighybulb that never gets turned off

It's beer o clock and all is well
So rally up the lads and everybody sing!
It's beer o clock and all is well
Girls rockin panties get moist and ready
It's beer o clock and all is well
So rally up the lads and everybody sing!
I found freedom through the tip of my pencil
Top em up, we just did it again

These cats eat what we drop
No need to ask if it hits
Cause I can see them wipe their face and mouth after I sht
And a cypher with my lads, passin a spliff
Kickin, enough knowledge to father your kids
We've mastered this shit with no pots of gold
Yo that's my dollar on the table bro it's not your go
See you whacker's... whack em up and take all your profit
Bliss n Eso in the house 8-ball corner pocket
Cats on your radio, bricks through your telly
Steak on a plate, fish in your belly
Mud's back, on that street light swing
I wanna roll in the grass I wanna eat like kings
From crackin' a longy
To clutchin' a forty
To inside my mind, where nothing is boring
Clockwise on the dial man that's fucking important
Cause this is that sh*t that gets you up in the morning

It's beer o clock and all is well
So rally up the lads and everybody sing!
It's beer o clock and all is well
Brothers that broke broke broke out the loony bin
It's beer o clock and all is well
So rally up the lads and everybody sing!
I found freedom through the tip of my pencil
Top em up, we just did it again

Ay yo cut that cut that
You folks don't know where you are do ya
This is DJ Izm's magical mix tape of bliss n eso
You best be lookin' out in all directions for flowers in the pavement
When we drop it you cop it
DJ Izm
KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS!

From heads nodding
To girls shakin' their tushy
Just cause we're young guns you dumb cunts take us for rookies
Tryin' to be our daddy, so when your busy snoring
I'm a dig up this hatchet and fuckin' flip to lizzy boardin
This is...
And you can trust that I'm bringing
All the ruckus you love, yo this is just the beginning
We rhyme on your shit, and reap the props of the feature spot
But still gettin' paid from Centrelink and sneaker shops
... The speaker box cause we some rhyme hoodlums
And after the show, rest my head up in some fine bosoms
Make the after party our room get chucked out the large
Wake up with a splitting headache get the fuck outta dodge
And it's back to the lab for the next punters
You damn right Bliss n Eso got the fresh numbers
Just a smokey dopey Arab and two white dudes
We been professors of this shit since we blew high school

It's beer o clock and all is well
So rally up the lads and everybody sing!
It's beer o clock and all is well
So rally up the lads and everybody sing!
It's beer o clock and all is well

Creepy,The Bliss n Eso Mixtape,2004,"Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to welcome you inside the mind
There'll be no bell for lunch without a popper
And back then I was never embarrassed even with my dick out like chopper

I get so lonely I brawl with the music
I'm so underground, you silly bitch, I crawl through the sewage
Commercial shit, it's just all a nuisance
And Esoteric to aid he calls on the purest
To emerge from the gutter and do away with one dimensional
MC's who have to turn to their mother in a battle situation
Ring the bell when the cattle reach my station
I love riding on donkeys with headphones on
I see visions when I walk
I know a whole lot of fucking pigeons that can talk
They remind me that the hunger's real
And if you're gonna come at all you best come with skill

It's like B to the E to the I, it's just so creepy
Take a stroll through the woods and believe me
We're doing this of embers, no kindles
And the pioneers of small crease, they see a smoke signal
It's like B to the E to the I, it's just so creepy
Take a stroll through the woods and believe me
We're doing this of embers, no kindles
And the pioneers of small crease, they see a smoke signal

You see, Lucifer couldn't catch me, he's playing soft
I play cards with Merlin, I blow smoke with Gandalf
Blinky bill and I rob banks and shape shift
And the only icy shit I got is my dick in the cake mix
I'll take this to a land of snakes with red bellies
Secret handshakes with Ned Kelly
I came to prove, that we can too
When your whole style reminds me of an ad for cheap shampoo
That's right, life's a puzzle and I'm making it fit
And don’t bother me on the dunny, son, I'm taking a shit
But when I'm off, and no doubt about it, I'm partly mental
Meet me in the tool shed with all your sharpened pencils
Envision the calligraphy that hacks the gift
And slap on your thinking caps to catch my drift
Porn king ding fish burn makes the world move
Poetical principal of rhyme the girls do
So, come on, lads, please, pass the billy
We got hip hop, at ease, arse and titty
And I'm stumbling (shit) numb of a case
I got a dick in my pants who thinks he's running the place
Walking like a wooden puppet this track goes out
To anybody talking like I couldn't cut it
A little faith, trust me, goes a long way
That's why my magical wand waves so that the song stays in
Timeless like I'm on stage rhyming
Cause in the sky rhythm and rhyme living the live
And the moral of the story is , I juggle just to manage
I'm a ghost for now, but I'm subtle when I vanish

It's like B to the E to the I, it's just so creepy
Take a stroll through the woods and believe me
We're doing this of embers, no kindles
And the pioneers of small crease, they see a smoke signal
It's like B to the E to the I, it's just so creepy
Take a stroll through the woods and believe me
We're doing this of embers, no kindles
And the pioneers of small crease, they see a smoke signal

We're just kicking it so beautifully and usually we just chill out
Next to broads that foolishly with these carps of jewelry
I found these balds of nudity and it's all just new to me
Such an odd community (hey yo it's probably puberty)

Ey yo we've got to grow the fuck down
We still in adolescence
To come to the clearing in the woods
Lit by the incandescent moon
Yeah I see you smirk and say not likely
Original vocab just don't compute
Like we were pikies
(So I stand there)
And all I hear is
""Geez, you're a pair of slopes""
Weaze, no caramel so please don't parallel (that's right)
Us to candy rappers cuz they end up in the waste basket
When their style spit there ain't no flavour, no
It's that taste lasting
Oompa Loompa, doopity doo
Man I’m that Everlasting Gobstopper that blew the city fuse
So don't think you're gonna get away
You little rascal
Cause we got the country locked down like we're from Nashville

It's like B to the E to the I, it's just so creepy
Take a stroll through the woods and believe me
We're doing this of embers, no kindles
And the pioneers of small crease, they see a smoke signal
It's like B to the E to the I, it's just so creepy
Take a stroll through the woods and believe me
We're doing this of embers, no kindles
And the pioneers of small crease, they see a smoke signal

Some outskirt hillbillies just chilling on some dirt bikes
Rounded up these Varmints taking them back to the turnpike
When the herb lights, we’ll pass it, when we spy ‘em from the ditch
We show 'em they got a wardrobe and a lion and a witch
You wanna pitch your tent right here at our camp site
(There’s a crack in the back of the closet)
Oh oh, I'll get that lamp lite
 the wood hatchet these splinters kill
Then I feel a winter, chill and I'm in a timber mill
Through the prairie, I storm through the grass and night thicket
Past the bushes, the brambles, the billygoats and white pickets
And I'm here
I crush the petals with my sandals
I'm walking through the woods
With little Gretel and Hanz
Look west on the hills
Up here i hear a moan, bellow
From an old fellow at a park
With a couple of stones yellow
And he was more bubbly than a geiser
That Old Faithful freestyler
Was more (?) kaizer
We jumped on a snow plow
But like a magic trick he made a dragon puff up
With a gadget fit for bagging up all the adjectives
I ask you this
Yo, in all sinsavity
Does it even occur to you
Half our shit is all a pavity
All those prissy little nitwits
Just trying to make their shit flip
When they spit fits of mindless crap
I mean, I guess we are some misfits
And you might call me a cynic
But I just don't mimic
At the hands of today
We still make you bounce without the gimmick
Like we're pumping this club
And we’ll up and make it so fresh
In the southern we’re coming with something different from the rest
And by the time I get to the club man
I'll be hurting
I get there, there's one guy there
Some dude named Tyler Durden, man

It's like B to the E to the I, it's just so creepy
Take a stroll through the woods and believe me
We're doing this of embers, no kindles
And the pioneers of small crease, they see a smoke signal
It's like B to the E to the I, it's just so creepy
Take a stroll through the woods and believe me
We're doing this of embers, no kindles
And the pioneers of small crease, they see a smoke signal",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-creepy-lyrics
Ghost at my Window Sill,The Bliss n Eso Mixtape,2004,"All these drops just keep on fallin'
(these dreams i dream)
Which way do I run?
Can't you hear the ghosts just callin'?
(these dreams i dream)
What have I become?
(these dreams i dream just become my life)
All these drops just keep on fallin'
Which way do i run?
Can't you hear the ghosts just callin'
(up late nights scribing these rhymes with candle light)


Where should I start?
Oh let me see
I met Tinkerbell underneath the Maulberry tree
And we made love for hours and she showed me some tricks on how mud can give power or blow them to bits

Yo
I got weapons and a sword, a sickle and a dream, I got questions I pour, they trickle from the stream
And every rhyme it's like my pen tip's been muttering
It leaves my heart gently fluttering

Now picture an apartment block full of memories
A staircase with sacrifice and art is the energy, the remedy
The only form of freedom has befriended me
The need of love, the time alone, the chemistry

We hang out with the heads with the workmen at the galloes
Just watching all these pussies just surfing in the shallows
I scurry off to mother and tell her who we badger
Or toast your beer high and sing this with Casper

If you don't love me then no one will
Another ghost crawls over my window sill
And he's stabbing for the rap that I keep in motion
My bedroom's a castle, I keep it open 

Yo
We travel over acres and hills
And hills and acres
So I'm shaping these gills so I can chill with nature
And just cool out and pause the ripples for a moment
And watch these tune numbers and believe in the zone
And I'm optimistic like the last wishing son
Reflecting naked in this pond as I cast my fishing rod
Into that uncharted plane of thought
And I never departed until my aim was caught
In this land of giants, I climb the beanstalk
Yeah I've been to the top and I've see how men walk
And it's just that crawling up under my skin
We paint these worlds that y'all are slumbering in
I bottle up my dreams, I blow them out through my trumpet to kids asleep
How many can you encompass?
But I forgot that I'm standing in a pond of hope
And we might not be heard cause we're beyond their scope
We grow
Lyrics in the heavens watch the stars get fertile
But we might as well be rapping at the arctic circle
Cause y'all are hibernating
We're flying over your nogins
I'm all alone writing in this fucking rolling tobagin
So we injected this crop
When you were man enough to bump us
We connected the dots
And we expanded your circumference
It's the words that you missed that could be the most valid
So I sit in between the lines and hear the ghosts galloping


(?)

Yo
Show me a light
Show me a spark
I've been trying to take flight all alone in the dark
In a bedroom that I pretend's my palace
The paper's my landscape, the pen's my balance
See there's no map to buy to know where my head goes
Sometimes I see her ghost by my bedpost
But when the sunshine hits the kids on the hill
Three billygoats are born for every bridge that I build
Cause as long as I'm alive I'm a fix that flat
The smile on her face I'm a bring that back
I need a dog by my side, some sneakers for walking
And a boat to leave on the sea in the morning
But the storm is towering over my tugboat
Would I pack up shop now? Fuck no
See I'm a positive man
But when I look back on hell's hole
I buy a pint with my lads, sit back and tell jokes
Yo all through Summer went to Autumn and Spring and not once did I fucking fall off that swing
Has proved that under the dirt is hundreds of birds waiting with an infinite hunger to merge
That's why I walk the street with a leash chained to a butterfly
But when I talk to the beat I free reins to the other side
But when I catch them with a net made of magic
And throw them back with a shepherd's heart to save the paddacs
There's no doubt I make it happen
It's a party on my page of poetry
So peel back those prison walls and arrange to go with me
Their show is over
We want to show you free
Where you can walk through walls to a place that no one sees",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-ghost-at-my-window-sill-lyrics
Greenhouse,The Bliss n Eso Mixtape,2004,"I know you've met all the rest of them...
... but, seriously...
Have you ever met a hippie
From the city called Sydney?
An emcee who's no joke
And blows smoke like a chimney
No? well, get with me (bitch)
I'm bound to break the barricades babbling
A hundred thousand fucking savage apes
So welcome everybody to my bud's imagination
Where my heart sings blues
And drunken affirmations
The flowers in the pavement
Are there to salvage hip-hop
Crooked and loopy in the greenhouse
Like alfred hitchcock
Hundreds acting brainless
So something has to change, kids
Or else this axe is mine
Forever hunting on the rangers
I elevate the cause
While I celebrate the force
The words rotate the stress
And meditation bores

Hey yo, put 'em up, throw 'em up
Do your thing and grow the stuff
It's the words, now ya heard
Repeat the name and know the suss
It's bliss 'n eso and they
Gobble our sound down
And get off the ground
And wobble around
Hey yo, put 'em up, throw 'em up
Everybody grows the stuff
It's the words, now ya heard
Repeat the name and know the suss
It's bliss 'n eso and they
Gobble our sound down
And get the whole land to wobble around
When they make you a partner
I'm starting to not believe in this legion
'cause we be growing fresh words
And it's not leaving this region
We heard farm wide, stars collide
Ain't no finer carnival
The state that always scrape the hull
Free from rhyme or barnacles
On our vessel, prepared for voyage sea
Packing on beef to serve me
Scurvy won't corrupt my buoyancy
And we arrived at the bash like migrants
And the reception was grand
'cause we re-hashed that vibrance
That they once had but lost
To a sea of starving cats
So the harvest was brought
By these three charming chaps
A bit louine the right cogs loose
To break free from that farm
And bring the right pro-duce
For this rapping sitcom
A program laughter
To make you think it's good
But really it's just a toe jam cracker
And they feedin' you, it's like a
Flea market full of dumb shits (of dumb shit)
'cause we remarkable...

(It's the greenhouse)
You're bound to get hooked
On the ink I bleed on my soul sketchbook
Accepted at the entrance
I paid without cash
Stared dragons in their eyes
And laid them out flat
Perverted poets watching the fairies fly
It's underground and stay in the trench
When the canary dies
It's eso, if you didn't know the king's name
And every time I fly
The colors of my wings change
Loud burpin', hanggliding
Cloud surfin', man I been here for years
You've just never looked
That furry feathered book
Holds my thoughts on voodoo sex
Do your thing, flew over
The motherfuckin' cuckoo's nest
Who you think it is? me
I cry colors, an only child
Who wishes he had five brothers
I'm up next, bitch
And I represent proudly
Born and raised in
The year of the rowdy
Allow me to let my dog loose
On your beach mouse
A monkey with a mic
In a mahogany treehouse
Read the sign, it says keep out
I keep it lit and blown
In the big bad greenhouse

(It's the greenhouse... makin' it hot)
Man, at least I'm not lying
Trying to recoup the bait
Then buying the used loop you take
You're lying about the loop you make
You falling short of the hoop, you's fake
While my troop can make
Any shot we shoot and take
We keep it down to earth
Where grassroots don't break
And that's just the feeling
These words will make
And all the flaking, make an offer
Is bringing regurgitation
And it's filthy just thinking
About the hand one set
My words were spiccity-span
But my biggity hands
Still kept that penmanship
So though I wrote like three books
It's right on the news page
And uh, no we're not on street hooks
Our style is engaged
Not a stroke past midnight
And all through the club
Not a emcee stirred
Not even a rapping thug
Just a clown being me
So jelly pumpin' see
Where do they go
They had to return that flow
To the rental company
Oh! so people, let loose
And wobble your frame
They say, where you grow your words?
I tell 'em, boggle, the game

On a Bender,The Bliss n Eso Mixtape,2004,"For all you baboon headed mother fuckers
Yo, Yo. Wake the fuck up

Don't you dare pack a bong yet, captain on deck, Bliss the
Vegabond vet, pack a strong bet, Mr
Crack a long neck, grab a song wreck, sip the
Oracle of bugger and just stagger on
Bliss like ""wohhh""
My oral treatment to the ear canal
It's soul so even when I speak you can hear the style
But no, you wanna hear pretentious shit?
""I got ends, a benz and gems, pretty pearls
And I'm with 10, 10, 10 freaky girls
And my pen sends them cheeky whirls
Then it cries ""fuck me silly""
Rappers suck the willy of the industry
You feel a slong? You a killer - Wrong
I'm just hoping for a milla-song floating in a billabong
I spin bam boogie and a bottle of whiskey
Then I drink ""damn lookey now I'm wobbling tipsy""
But either you a fast hustlin' pimp
With cash, muscle and wit. (Bliss: I guess)
A gas guzzling wip
Or you ain't' doin' nothin' and I'm past shovellin' shit
But fuck, it's like we're the last struggling clique
In this land it's a game and every second they score
We on the bench player, cos we ain't got a record in stores
But still they're begging for more
I'ma go silly and show Sydney
We're the freshest rappers out since MC Bomiddy

Where you at?
On a bender just having a ession
Who you with?
My Sin City crew cracking a fresh one
Yo who's that singing?
Some drunk pop-star contestant
I don't know how I got in this mess but this melody's fresh
So let's do this, rock this
Ruin this, knock this
World of its axis
We back to get it poppin'
Let's do this, rock this
Ruin this, knock this
It's part of your taxes
Cos this the way we rock this

Avoid cameras when we came to damage the place
On stage acting like characters from Planet Of The Apes
Steal your laminated plaques right off your neck
Then rock a set eating hash cookies - chocolate chip
What would you expect from Dr. Es, you don't want no nonsense
Carrying fishing rods so you can catch a Loch Nest Monster
Still convict minded, this island got me blinded
Gatecrashing the party like a kamikaze pilot
Don't try no funny business
We some tummy ticklers running fingers 'round your hunnies nickers
I'm the vicious, this is lyrics with a difference
Too persistent, it even reads ""perverse"" on my birth certificate
These misfits, a few sandwiches less than a picnic
You got ants in your pants, dance to this shit
My lyrics drawn in a second
That's right we come through turning Walkman's to weapons

Where you at?
On a bender just having an ession
Who you with?
My Sin City crew cracking a fresh one
Who's that singing?
I guess some French porno star
But I'm a pro-baller but can't afford no car

I'm here, so go nuts and break some shit
And watch tears turn to coco nuts and naked chicks
A summer nutter ""with fresh flows for the nation""
And I gotta love a ""Es Es O in the basement""
But I stroll and roll with the bandits full of thinkers
And still live like we're dancing under sprinklers
This big bad mic here to give back love
Chronic cupid(?) with the zig zag stuff
So while this world turns into an American sitcom
I wait for change like staring at lit bombs
I wasn't hanging on board just like a gang of angry orphans
That's the reason why I couldn't give a fuck who sang your chorus
See Bliss and Esoterikism got that head splitin' inspiration
That everyone craves
And I got a look in my eyes, given from a hit over the head
That I copped at a very young age

Where you at?
On a bender just having a session
Who you with?
My Sin City crew cracking a fresh one
Who's that singing?
That's ah, Bonez on karaoke
He started a new crew and Izm called it the Smokey Dokey's
Let's do this, rock this
Ruin this, knock this
World of its axis
We back to get it poppin'
Let's do this, rock this
Ruin this, knock this
It's part of your taxes
Cos this the way we rock it

Split Soul,The Bliss n Eso Mixtape,2004,"Flowers in the pavement
Flowers in the pavement
There's many roads but there's only one you'll take
You never know when your gonna meet your fate
Face to face eye to eye
With the inner truth
So I spill my soul and swim in the booth
Yeah, I'm like a man with his thoughts on a
Lonely road. I stand and I fought now I
Only know that these gun minds only want punch lines or gun minds
If you don't kick well then your most likely unsigned, (when I'm lying)
Now you can tell me if your rhyming is life
And you don't wanna live of it without a nine to five
So why you strive, the sound underground
Just bring it naturally, like my eyes looking under gowns
I use to label it but now learn it's evolving
I guess the tables have turned they're not just revolving
Light it up, hear the crackle, Bliss an' mud
Through the evil it's a drug that sits in blood
Yo this is love
That god only breaks the mold
Like that twist of bud
Reality only takes a strole
It can lift you up
Make you sore like that kite
You can drift with us
Cut the cord with the knife
Swimming in oblivion
Above such evil
It's amazing what we gotta go through to touch people
When I spit ears just prick up
I sip beers and hick-up
And rocking the same jeans for six years and it sucks
It's like I mean I dress in junes and my weapons too
Fuck that
Give me truth through these decibels
The unforfilled talk of cash and power
Wait, the wine they're sipping is nothing but sour grapes

There's many roads but there's only one you'll take
You never know when your gonna meet your fate
Face to face eye to eye
With the inner truth
What stuff do you put on when your in the booth
I'm super man I'm a killer
I'm a smoked out pimp
I'm trailer trash
I'm a gangsta with a fucked up blimp
An old geazer with a story to tell
I can hold a crowd
Yo I'm boring as hell
I can feel you can feel it we can feel it for sure
I can feel the opportunity, knocking my door
I can feel you can feel it we can feel it for sure
I can feel the opportunity, knocking my door
Imagination of an eights year old
I feel you by my side
There's flowers in the pavement
To filter out the crime
And I'm an egg missle bitch
I build this house with rhymes
I coloured in my wings
And still drew out the lines
So don't take my love for granted
Untill you understand it
The day dreamer, dog lover
Wish, wonder bandit
I swear a day doesnt pass when I don't feel the pressure
I got a thousand keys
But none reveal the treasure
Just a tital wave, an earthquake
And then the flood
Should have thought twice before you gave the pen to mud
Cause when you do
Religions all calapse
And I free run through hell
With matchsticks and no maps
So go back
To your labaratory
Cause a cunt like me
Wants to marry at 40 and carry a 40
Down the wedding isle with pride
And have a bong in private
After I marry my bride
I'm happy as larry inside
But with the wieght of these waves
It's hard to carry the tide
And all an honest man can do
Is ask for a calery rise
I do live in this world and this cannot be right
So I mean when I see you, rolling through the cities
See ya pumping our tunes
Hopping on the sneaky green
All I want is to raise my kids
Up in the bush
Everybody seem to be pulling to fuck it
I'll push


Check it out
It's ridden pretty vagas
143 crew
Coming straight out of prizzi
Kicking it
Having a few beers with Bliss n Sso
A few beers
Be sure to check out the new album
Flowers in the Pavement
Yes yes
This is infamous
1200 techniques
And you are listening to bliss n esoterics
Flowers in the Pavement
It's dropping soon
Infact if you listen to this shit
It's probably dropped right now
So turn it up and rock with it",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-split-soul-lyrics
The Anthem,The Bliss n Eso Mixtape,2004,"Come on, yo
Yo, yo

Yo, Australia, copy, I'll spill it, you want rap stars?
Well here's the coffee, you smell it, check your backyard
We rap with no guns, no bullets, no triggers
Still three young guns took over the island, go figure
Leave 'em so bitter, like Eso with no liquor (yeah)
 ho's bicker about whose flow's sicker
But look up little minnows, do you spot the hawk?
We're above your fuckin' pond, 'cause we walk the talk
And every town we hit, we find a army on the same buzz (yeah)
 stole the show, the beer, and your dame's love
So blame us, some bandits bumpin' out
Are we some heartfelt artists, or just some drunken louts (drunk cunt)
It's getting rough so I bust with my crew in the place
And you can huff, you can puff till you're blue in the face
When you're in the house, you know when you witness this sound
We're the only cats to blow and bring this bitch down

This is the anthem to get off your arse
Hit the pub, hit the club, and fill up your glass
Toast to this, coastal kids poaching fish
Roasting pigs, (how you livin'?) Broke as shit
This is the anthem to get off your arse
Hit the pub, hit the club, and fill up your glass
Toast to this, coastal kids poaching fish
Roasting pigs, (how you livin'?) Broke as shit

When it comes to how I feel I'm a book that's ever lasting
I'm a film that runs forever, I'm a crook that wears a class ring
We are shook from all our marching, we cook to stop the starving
You can't see us, but you hear us, like those kookaburra's laughing
I'm a broke bugger with a bus ticket to the promise land
Who clutches the mic, like the ring in Golem's hand (precious)
I got a plan, to get loose in the booth and crack it in one take
And make fans storm the capitals' front gates
I've sipped water with God, he made the sun stop still
Stared me dead in the eyes, told me money's not real
Took the devil on a date, shouted her a schooner
But still had my hatchet hidden, I doubt her when the moons up
Staring at the sky like sunflowers in a lonely paddock
Far away from gunpowder and their phoney magic
I freak shit on a track like lovers under covers
And Bliss 'n' Eso roll like brothers from other mothers

This is the anthem to get off your arse
Hit the pub, hit the club, and fill up your glass
Toast to this, coastal kids poaching fish
Roasting pigs, (how you livin'?) Broke as shit
This is the anthem to get off your arse
Hit the pub, hit the club, and fill up your glass
Toast to this, coastal kids poaching fish
Roasting pigs, (how you livin'?) Broke as shit

This Is For You,The Bliss n Eso Mixtape,2004,"Yo, from half a headphone as a mic and a busted boombox
To rockin' the spot from Sydney to the fuckin' boondocks
To the fans when we pass through who love to wave high (hey)
To the arms that hold me up when I jump and stage-dive
To kids outside the venue who ain't on the door list
They love the music, they just can't afford it
Watch them build that cypher smiling quite glad
Why aren't they glum, what you dumb?
Cos hip hop has no price tag
And everybody's welcome, it has no nationality
This is for rappers who ain't just in it for the fast salary
Who don't just push violence and money with all that damn braggin'
Who don't just jump on the (""it's all entertainment"") bandwagon
To the DJ who drops his tune and ain't paid to play it
To anyone who loves their partner and ain't afraid to say it
To everyone who's shown love when I looked unsure
Friends and fam, shit even the girls I boofed on tour man
(x2)
This is for you, you're the reason I wrote this
You're the reason I stand in the rain and get my clothes wet
Oh it's just another taste from the bottle
Oh it's Bliss n Eso's page from the novel

Keep your cash, your gold, your glitter and cars
Keep your royal red carpet for your city of stars
This ain't for the system to put a cage on your mind
It's for those who don't suck dick for radio time
And the only time you'll ever catch me aimin' a rifle
Is when there's nothing on my telly but *Australian Idol*
We rock rusty mics, and spit what we think
Shabby hotel hoppers that piss in the sink
See cos rich make money and poor make magic
(""We're gonna make you a star"") bro they all say that shit
A habit for the headphones (kid's ride the merry-go)
'round down to meet me (inside the stereo)
With no Ride, and no meals full of shrimp
I'm broke, but hip-hop can make me feel like a pimp
See the man who lives patient handles displacement
Writing rhymes for you in a candlelit basement
(x2)

This is for the cause in the music, the gift that we're building
We all gotta use it for lifting these children
I haven't been the same since I fell in the well
I wished and found love where them ATLiens dwell
See it's the rhymes, it's the beat
It's the song, it's the mix
It's the times that we're free
It's the bomb, it's the shit
Opportunity's blind I don't wonder if he's coming
So look mum, no hands - I made somethin' outta nothin'
(x2)
And I hope this feeling stays till tomorrow! (x3)",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-this-is-for-you-lyrics
Weathermen,The Bliss n Eso Mixtape,2004,"La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Ladies and gentlemen, babies and elephants
Ravens and serpents, cavemen and merchants:
If you've felt the rain, then you've felt the pain
That's what it's all about, Bliss N Eso won't get caught in no drought

Now in the morning you'll be seeing the flock
But by the evening you'll be seeing them drop
It's just another rainy day in a town we call home
It's the weatherman reporting the sounds unknown

Well I guess we're the weathermen and we report the storm
When it forms from the corn fields to college dorm meals
When I was born seals as flavors, and they savor
Letting the rain wash away the past
Forgetting their way lost the page and grasp
Of how to make a right turn, where they go
Left the will to learn behind
And now they're so
Susceptible to germs you'll find
When the silence is deafening
There's no guidence thats beckoning us
To minus the violence so this alliance is gesturing
That these pleasant ads, pushing present fads
Put you in peasent rags when you succumb to the tag
Of an artificial kingdom where most reside
Hell I'm sitting on the fence watching others decide
And the truth is so scarce in the babble that travels
To a landscape of non-unification
A school bomb blew up the nation
It takes too long, queing impatiance
For the new song doing in basements
From the few strong, viewing the statements
Of the true pawns polluting the tamest
Asking ""who's wrong?"", shooting the stainless
""Time to put my shoes on, I'm pursuing to be famous!""
I say move on, because your flow is so aimless
But when you choose your own don't let the dough make you nameless

The weathermen, reporting the storms
He said, the weathermen, reporting the storms
He said, the weathermen, reporting the storms
It's the weathermen, reporting the storms

Now in the morning you'll be seeing the flock
But by the evening you'll be seeing them drop
It's just another rainy day in a town we call home
It's the weatherman reporting the sounds unknown

Flashlights and faith, magnificent altitude
Fist in the air for those who salvage thruth
And allow your blues to be a thing of the past
Engage with us as we bring in the craft
Man, I'm loony like an old man who sings in the park
But serious about doing your own thing with your art
In the beating up, Buck watch your spaceship
I'll take this way beyond the matrix of you fake kids
Like a turtle in the race of life I go the distance
I relate my sense of humor to Homer Simpson
That poet whose purpose feeds the righteous
My mind is a movie, the curtains are my eye lids
And for that special part in your brain. (this is the ticket stub)
I met the music under the bridge, and this is love between
Men and magic, words and a microphone
A dreamland of adlib when I turn to the twilight zone
My Nevilles are heavy like four elephants
MC's are dope. (shit I need more evidence)
I'm the core element to this raw elegance
Hugging the coast line, sea shore residence

Now in the morning you'll be seeing the flock
But by the evening you'll be seeing them drop
It's just another rainy day in a town we call home
It's the weatherman reporting the sounds unknown",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-weathermen-lyrics
Two Weeks,Two Weeks - Single,2015,"We are the music makers
And we are the dreamers of dreams

This is like a leap of faith
From the Empire State
Taking me to a zen higher place
I kill the doubt and fly
And see the whole world through the falcons eyes
Feel love rush in my blood, in my brain
That electricity that runs in my veins
It's the key to break my thoughts free
Now I travel through this motherfucker with God speed
And I don't need the greenest chron from Cheech and Chong
No boat load of blow from Pablo
Fuck the ice that's served by Heisenburg
You don't need none of that shit to get high as a bird
We all get down, I know man it's rough
It ain't how you fall, it's how you stand back up
So I'm running and gunning
And making something from nothing
Living with nothing but loving
That's the motherfucker that gets me high

I'm getting high again, I'm getting high again
(Higher than a motherfucker, dreaming of you as my lover)
And I can fly again, and I can fly again
(Flying like a streamer, thinking of new ways to do each other)
I'm getting high again, I'm getting high again
(Higher than a motherfucker, dreaming of you as my lover)
And I can fly again, and I can fly again
(Mouth open you're high)

I am higher than a motherfucker flying on a phoenix
Traveller of light, my societies a secret
Yeah, I'm a pilot on a peace trip
Making music lucid until my mind is where your dreams live
Influential when I write these songs
But you don't have to do what I do
You know right from wrong
So, even if the lights are off
I'm still an Indigo that sees through the eyes of God
This is dedicated to the people that related
To the music we created just to keep them elevated
So, let us celebrate it in a way of meditation
On a state of elevation tryna shape a better nation
Food for thought, you're the apple of my eye
So I used the force, to build a palace in the sky
The view's so awesome it balances my mind
Setting galaxies alight, that's what happens when I write",https://genius.com/Bliss-n-eso-two-weeks-lyrics
Video Games,Video Games - Single,2012,"“What were some of the things you learned, or focused on to get, to get through, to get by?”
“Just an insane belief in my own ability to manifest things. Insane belief. You know, that… I think it’s ultimately complete sanity. But, I believe we’re creators. And I believe we create with every thought and every word. Every moment is pregnant with the next moment of your life.”

Yeah
New outlook, new angle, new view
New channel, I surf the frontier with extra focus
My mind's third eye reflects the opus
I see you, you see me
That’s one love, let’s be free
Then paint the town
Red as roses
Sky high till the heavens open
I bleed for it, I cry for it
I’m free falling, my mind's orbit
Chase that dream but you’re never gonna get it
So I live that dream 24/7
I’m out there try and kiss that sun
Reminiscing how kids have fun
Timeless, you better watch this shit
And find us where the clocks don’t tick

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do

He sails and rides the tide
With a dream inside his mind
Blood orange moon illuminates the room
From a dark blue hue to a fiery sky
See the heights that he hovers
What a flight what a life full of wonder
Like when somehow those stars lined up
And he made the winning shot drop right at the buzzer
He can do it because he knows the mission
He can paint the picture
He can hold the vision
He’s in full position with sonar thinking
He can hit those goals like a homing pigeon
So, on a ship from the maritime
He makes it lift like a paraglide
And he soars to the heavens
Watching his whole world flip and shift for the paradigm

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do

“I think people need to believe in stuff. And I think you need to believe you’re involved in something here. Believe this whole thing is your imagination. You know? Like you're in charge. I kind of live my life that way.”

Remember those games we used to play
Like you get one wish then you chose your fate
Or a magic power you can have for hours
That’s what I wanna do today
But you made me begin to start
Thinking heaven is within the heart
But we’ll miss it
Try and grip the stars
To die rich and fast

He’s learned lessons, kept in his tale
Felt like they were etched into braille
He hammers anything yet to be nailed
Any mountain, any wall, that’s yet to be scaled
There he goes, set to his trail
He won't stop until the breath in him fails
In a boat that he built with the world in his hands
Space riding on destiny’s sail

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do

“So you just gotta keep going and look at this as a wonder, look at it as a trip. You know. Just go on this trip and just look at all this stuff. It’s fantastic. You’re actually here and you got a dream. You got to look at the dream as the actual thing.”

We're all the missing puzzle piece that makes the picture complete
We all march to our hearts and a signature beat
No-one can walk in your shoes and leave the prints from your feet
In my celestial body, internal astrology
My atoms dance like stars in a circular odyssey
This is my universe where fear and doubt don't live, bro
Elevating my perspective as I'm peering out the window
With my eyes on this ride at the vividest carnival
So let your pride fly, you're the original article
Travel with that as you step over the Earth and see
