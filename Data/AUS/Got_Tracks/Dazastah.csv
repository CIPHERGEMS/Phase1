When We Were Kids,,2011,"[Verse 1: Drapht]
Yeah, uh, see. To me, a lie and a young start to my crew
Only comfortable at my drunkest, drink 'cause I never knew how
To conversate, communicate without the booze out
If I knew what I knew now, wouldn't have ever known
What amount of alcohol could ever help me
In my room, my Humpty Doo house
Go with you the twin towers melting
Done the alkane and LP change
Everything better than any medicine that could derange
I reign the Pale Rider
Mr D-rapht, the name's sustained from days of a graff writer
Know what? Saba Indians on the internet
Start it, you better finish it
Are you a target of a star-picket after they
Picking it off a picket fence?
No ignorance on these street smarts and vigilance
No time for bickering, time ticking away
Remember like it's yesterday

[Hook: Drapht & Dazastah]
Remember? We were kids, just living like kids
What did we miss? Never thought that it would come to this
We were kids
We were kids
'Cause we were kids, just living like kids
And we were fish out of water but thought we were kings
We were kids, life for some can be hard and selfish
We were kids, you gotta make the most out of the cards you're dealt with (we were kids)


[Verse 2: Hunter]
My flat, top of the block
You know the door is always open, ain't no need to knock
Got hip-hop posters, flyers plasting the wall
Over time we doing these shows, man, rocking them all
Crew would rock up. Commence the drinking the Recard
And any second, second stubby freezed offside for start
And we be laughing, dreaming of making a CD
Believe me, back then, it wasn't that easy
Let the DL grow darn, had so much fun
Shows interstate, SBX be number one
When it comes to rocking shows and flows
And I suppose I seen pain as the city style grows
And those who dropped off, surrended their lost off the scene
Never again to be seen
But if you follow your dream, like chase it, grab it
Make it your habit, like, know you gotta have it

[Hook: Drapht & Dazastah]
Remember? We were kids, just living like kids
What did we miss? Never thought that it would come to this
We were kids
We were kids
'Cause we were kids, just living like kids
And we were fish out of water but thought we were kings
We were kids, life for some can be hard and selfish
We were kids, you gotta make the most out of the cards you dealt with (we were kids)


[Verse 3: Dazastah]
Yeah, when we were so young growing up with the world in our palms
While other crews acted like a bunch of girls in the dark
The main go with Jonah Holmes, kills and focus the art
Hunter run-off apartment, filled from those from the heart
Remember the smoking, the laughing, the omens that past
Searching for crumbs strapping the resin, the hope for a blaster
The teacher said, we were hopeless in class
Who would've thought that we really knew, we chosen the path
And now I flip back, trying to drink as much as I could
Going against the grain like a plane cutting the wood
Learnt the blunt truth, gotta sharpen up on the good
And now I'm straighter than a hammered nail stuck in the wood
Locking the hood and the dodgy places I came from
Now the spirit of life has got me dating a seance
Getting my ground, trying to save place in this little sun
Trying to escape the hectic fast lane without the brakes on
Trying to slow down and not get the pace wrong
Demons in the mirror still want to face off
I'm reminiscing about the days that I came from
'Cause Syllabolix is what I'm made from

[Hook: Drapht & Dazastah]
Remember? We were kids, just living like kids
What did we miss? Never thought that it would come to this

And we were fish out of water but thought we were kings

Yah think,,2005,"[Intro: Drapht]
Oi Daz, do you think what I'm thinking?
I think that they're thinking that we care about what they think
But don't you think that they're thinking about all this thinking a little too much?
Fuckin hell, all right
This going out to all you tough motherfuckers

[Verse 1: Dazastah]
Check. D-r and Pegz will hang you high from a clothesline
Strip the sheep of wolves clothing with a dope rhyme
Head first, I'll throw you into my walls of passion
And still you fucking eggheads wouldn't know what's cracking
Stirring the pot, I scramble your brain for breakfast
SBX kid, the fathers of some next shit
Gotta dark iron flow like a pint of Guinness
Fuck Steve Irwin - I'm notable like the Indigenous
I never let you take my style out, sick, fluent
And loud like I worked out a way to make my bomb shout
Spit versatile on topics in life's list
While you scene jocks only battle emcees that don't exist
Fuck a hip-hop scene, I make music for your mind
And turn bandwagon jumpers into followers for life
And on that note, I'm signing off on this tip
You thought woody woodpecker was all about your bitch

[Hook: Drapht]
You think your shit don't stink? You better think twice
All I see is soft pussies like a pair of pink tights
You think I shouldn't sing and just bring it to 'em raw?
But I'm bored of the wars and the way that you record
You think you're in a struggle, thinking that you're hungry
You live in paradise, not a third world country
You think you're the shit, yeah you're better than the rest?
You don't want to risk death


[Verse 2: Drapht]
In the heat of the moment D-r's known for getting malicious
My fucking issues in a penthouse, still I'm staying ambitious
So I won't be washing dishes (nah), won't be working for peanuts
Who's sposed to be dumped in trunks quicker than a mobsters cleanup
A pre-nup agreement when I'm reaming this rap scene
The pack's been infected and I'm leaving no vaccine
The cat's been let out of the bag on you
Watched the rats run, so every doubt I had is true
Got gratitude for many, anyone in my vicinity
Battered and bruised egos wanted to fucking finish me
Who? I should've knew that you would scoop to the lowest path
Fucking animals treating this scene like it's Noah's Ark
Know your heart's in the wrong place, there's enough room
For tough crews and hippies that are rhyming about mushrooms
Don't even start if you're thinking you will bust through
Obese and SBX, killing this? I fucking must do

[Hook: Drapht]
You think your shit don't stink? You better think twice
All I see is soft pussies like a pair of pink tights
You think I shouldn't sing and just bring it to em raw?
But I'm bored of the wars and the way that you record
You think you're in a struggle, thinking that you're hungry
You live in paradise, not a third world country
You think you're the shit, yeah you're better than the rest?
You don't want to risk death


[Verse 3: Pegz]
9 to 5, works monotony
Tryna survive and serve the economy
Obese Crew - burn methodically
Terminology experts learn it properly
Pegz and Drapht inspire passionate people
Live from the motherfucking Axis of Evil
Where fascists are people in this War Against Terror
How many gotta die for George's vendetta?
Born September, the Devil's advocate
Fear campaigns and mental arrogance
Our governments sold out, nothing's sacrilege
Except the Catholic Church and corporate affluence
Worse than liver disease, addiction to speed
Powers like smack for the rich and elite

[Interlude: Drapht]
We nurse the illest emcees with this diction we breed
Untraceable tracks from west to the east

[Turntablism Interlude: DJ Selekt]
""Possibly, you might try stopping me""
""Well obviously boy, you ain't thinking properly""
""Possibly, you might try stopping me""
""My philosophy is to keep this shit poppin""


[Hook: Drapht]
You think your shit don't stink? You better think twice
All I see is soft pussies like a pair of pink tights
You think I shouldn't sing and just bring it to em raw?
But I'm bored of the wars and the way that you record

You live in paradise, not a third world country

Inspiration Island,,2005,"[Verse 1: Drapht]
My Mecca of motivation is facing destruction
Develop growing hatred, the face of seduction
My patience erupted, now my liberation's
Abducted, living through this name I've constructed
Not paid, so reluctant. Sucked into darkness
A place where I couldn't give a fuck if your heart's with us
Half your love doesn't even compare
To the energy I get from an enemy's stare
Is anyone there? I'm short of replies
I'm starved with nothing to feed off in this Lord of the Flies
I'm cornered by tribes of doubt without an escape
I'm screaming and shouting louder to get out of this place
Looking out on the space, thinking, ""How the fuck did this happen?""
I thought I would've kept on rapping till my lungs are collapsing
But I'm lacking all inspiration, racking my brain
I want it to be just like how they had it back in the day

[Verse 2: Dazastah]
Stuck in the timeless thought
Brought up to think my dreams are made
From the future, but of course the suckers were wrong
As I pulling the bong bubble
My thought's on a course inspired from a song
Cos everything I think of stems from the past
Learn from my idols not from a paid teacher in class
My heroes weren't rock stars or sport celebrities
The truth'd be, I look up to my friends and family
I'm thanking everyone who gave me a chance
Who gave me a hand, when my head was stuck in the sand
To my Mum and my Dad, for their eternal love
My brothers, cousins, uncles, aunties and my little godson
You're the reason and drive, why I put up with these critics
Take the disses and see very low financial figures
I'm saying, ""Thanks mate and your family, without you
I probably hang on the streets with the bong crew.""


[Hook: Drapht]
Deep in inertia (Stuck in the cold)
Last asleep, but the first up, (Taking it's toll)
But we keep moving further. (We'll never fold)
We just roll and we roll and we roll and we roll
But we're deep in inertia (Stuck in the cold)
Last asleep, but the first up, (Taking it's toll)
But we keep moving further. (We'll never fold)
We just roll and we roll and we roll and we roll

[Verse 3: Optamus]
Never gonna quit this biz, it's too far gone
I walk the monumental step like my name was Neil Armstrong
One giant leap for mankind, nothing major
Syllabolik, historically I find a later
It's time for the peeps now, I feel this deep down
Echoing through your soul, now feel the rebound
Piercing your heart, now open your eyes
And light, your like near-death when you're showing the lie
Cos I spitting these lessons of the Stairway to Heaven
So, the gods can hear my call, when I'm no longer present
I got a penchant for dramatics, but never mistake my lyrics
Be the cogs turning that will instigate change
Every phrase, every verse, every word, every sound
Every little bit of shit that's coming out my mouth
So get on down kid, yeah
Drapht, Downsyde, Layla
Singing Da da da da


[Hook: Drapht]
Deep in inertia (Stuck in the cold)
Last asleep, but the first up, (Taking it's toll)
But we keep moving further. (We'll never fold)
We just roll and we roll and we roll and we roll
But we're deep in inertia (Stuck in the cold)
Last asleep, but the first up, (Taking it's toll)
But we keep moving further. (We'll never fold)
We just roll and we roll and we roll and we roll

[Verse 4: Dyna-Mikes]
The days, we're all getting older
The nights, it's all getting colder
I need a shoulder to cry on
Hear the call of the lion lost in Zion, Babylon
Perth city, stand with me, march with me
Laugh with me and fight with me
Sip a drink from this cup and live forever
Listen to this song, it'll all be better
See, the road we chose ain't covered in gold
It's smothered with blood and then covered with love
It's the Wiz that I want, cos I need a heart
I need to be brave to face the past
I'm inspired by life, cos these words I write
Are non-fiction, listen to the wisdom
A reactions all preordained
Once you make a choice, things'll never be the same


[Verse 5: Layla]
Welcome to the explanation for the waited on one
Patience push us, slash voodoo cushion with a half vacant tongue
Casting the plaque of an aardvark scums
Wasting spirit like gum, bust up of our lies
More undown and tied than a car park
Hated mirrors, the first a slump and the last up
A dark angel number one
Steer to the ground, I'm a stark naked souls
Unfolding now, so, come and fill my gaping holes
I staple peeled feathers to doubt and once blazing coals
Pillaging this staff of clues and treasures
I'm still missing, pulls your path like carcass lepers
Or six-year-old girls left a piss glass
In African deserts, I'm a split vases searching for my petals
Before I tip the basket in
Harping on one string, far from laughing with inspiration
In fact I think he's taken my man on a lont
Cos he's passionately groping her curves as I'm deferred
Hanging for hope, struck high, caught up in moping
Can't even teach myself the ropes I'll tire
Nah, you're coping, revising bring me eager reason
When I'm pinched and I'm bleeding, I'm like, ""La, you're here breathing.""
But it's clearly eating away at chips
And I apologise, I only wish I had some advice for you kids

[Hook: Drapht]
Deep in inertia (Stuck in the cold)
Last asleep, but the first up, (Taking it's toll)
But we keep moving further. (We'll never fold)
We just roll and we roll and we roll and we roll
But we're deep in inertia (Stuck in the cold)
Last asleep, but the first up, (Taking it's toll)
But we keep moving further. (We'll never fold)
We just roll and we roll and we roll and we roll",https://genius.com/Drapht-inspiration-island-lyrics
Front Line,,2003,"[Verse 1: Drapht]
Pushing your luck (whoa!) treading on thin ice
Don't know how to play the game, then why roll the dice?
My battle tactics I kept locked in a chest
The right time to strike is your one wrong step
Classed a pest by the eye of society
Sun goes down, appears Drapht almighty
Sight me, unlikely, a shadow in the night
Leave a trail of fat cap chrome that shines in the night
Aggressive appetite for destruction
Bombing or busting, won't be brought down by your suction
Number one function, I illuminate the moment
Uncontrollable damage unleashed on opponents
Like anacondas, rapping tight and deadly
Stunned, left breathless by more class than Bentleys
This deranged frenzy feeds off a soul
Rocking more heads than medieval catapults
Necks jolt, led by S-B-X cult
The rest bolt from text that burns quicker than volts
Your fault, for even thinking you can step
Not saying we're the best but don't call us nothing less

[Verse 2: Hunter]
I live my life on credit, spend my cash before I get it
It's true because I said it, in the paper I had read it
Now it's all lies, open your mind's eyes
See the disguise of people living their lives through possessions
And I, found wealth and it's written on this track
I take what I want from Hip Hop and give it right back
A true player and I'm always on the Hunt
And that's the reason why I wrote the song 'I'm a Cunt'
I'm out the front taking pictures of pretty girls
I'd like to travel the world and see the banners unfurled
Of Hip Hop, and its cultural diversity
I stay to the walls of beats like textbooks to universities
A professor, an obsessor, don't accept nothing less
From the West, but the best of Syllabolix unrest
The quest, the text is through with making fans
I just want the shit out there before the world ends


[Hook: Drapht, Hunter, Dazastah & Layla]
The front line, where battles are first met
Explosive text dropped on swirling heads
S-B-X, the platoon from the West
Skills progress as we demolish the best
The front line, where battles are first met
Explosive text dropped on swirling heads
S-B-X, the platoon from the West
Skills progress as we demolish the best

[Verse 3: Dazastah]
The notes and keys of this mad melody
Unlock the secrets of Dazastah's wizardry
Spawned from a single idea
The S-B-X germs spread a disease called fear
Starting out maggot, we feed off this shit
Buzzing proteges fly under my wings
Syllabolix drop like paratroopas
All armed with a mouth like bazookas
Heavy artillery, don't take us lightly
The soles of our shoes are landmines see?
Cunts, join us or perish
On this Aus Hip Hop voyage the journey is endless
Walk through hell and swim through lava
The nights get cold and the days get darker
Extreme conditions, built to last
My problem is you won't hear me have the final laugh


[Verse 4: Layla]
I Hunt for Dazastahs and perfect my Draphts
I force tasks on myself and stay true to the art
We sharp lines like darts, I hit red every time
And got threads through my eyes so I joined the front line
A fanatic warhead eager to campaign
And what I'm believing in today is your fall of fame
To be frank, you were just singing in the rain
In gutter as you shatter as I soak up the hand shapes
A hurricane, I sweep cunts off their feet
Not with fuss but with a gust as powerful as this beat
You got no choice but to remember me
With a giant rejection, Jack can go fuck his beans
I stalk instrumentals like tomcats on heat
Then pull my thoughts in like open doors on submarines
You come to see the techniques of the West
A performance barrier that keeps the crowds pressed

[Turntablism: Finatik]
""[?]"" ""Over the front line""
""Talk in the streets while the whole world's sleeping""

Rest in Peace,,2008,"[Verse 1: Dazastah]
Rest in peace to the innocent children who were shot in the back
Running from the military, Junta hot on their tracks
For the love that why their uncle packs a bomb in their bags
What the fuck, you'd do the same with no options in hand
So stop with the wack raps you illiterate stale
Horse shit, you're just a piss in the gale force winds
Battling me like I have to start busting for you
I'm like a suspect package, I got nothing to prove
Fuck it, I'll serve you straight from the kitchen
And kill your fly shit like Norman Bates with a pigeon
Listen. I'm deaf and blind to your fallacy war
Like a land mine child victim all bandaged and sore
Damage and break you down until your spirit is vanquished
Like traditional ownership does to indigenous factions
It's more than just black and white, like racism
'Cause the face of hate appears when you face the mirror
This is for the people starving to eat
'Cause food for thought is running short in this marketed scene
It's hard to believe when you feel like smashing the mirror
But Charlie Chimp will pick you up like an angry gorilla

[Verse 2: Ciecmate]
Yeah I'm back in that pattern
I sit up late with a spliff and wait for the magic to happen
Just for rapping wack, you're catchin' a slappin'
I'll put you under pressure like a pilot with cracks in his cabin
Have another shot, see if you can take this spot
I'ma play strategically and take everything you got
Checkmate, game over, now you know the deal
Here with my bros and we're pros in our chosen fields
Standing tall like a wall to wall, public letter blockbuster
Got a lust for life, plus a lot of love for those I trust with my life
I'ma live my life like I like on any given night and anything else isn't right
Time's ticking by, time's making changes
Time's turning friends into strangers
I'm trying to find what the aim is, but time's limited
I've gotta make payments and for everyone, every day it's the same shit
Big brother wants us all to put it in a statement
But it's built on lies like the Bush administration
The media be feeding ya and we just believe it, huh
Behind the curtain, men are getting greedier
We need to peel the curtain back and hurt 'em bad
And then spread the wealth around to all those who've been getting held down
Can I get some help now? Or can I get a hell yeah?
I'm saying this for everybody's welfare


[Hook: Turntablism]
""Now, may these MC's rest in peace""
""Rest in peace"" ""Rest in peace""
""May these MC's rest in peace
Because when I come to town, the population decrease""
""Now, may these MC's rest in peace""
""Rest in peace"" ""Rest in peace""
""May these MC's rest in peace
Because when I come to town, the population decrease""

[Verse 3: Drapht]
Rest in peace, two thousand and six, shit changes quickly
Deaf to all man so I'm trained in lip read
Pick me like a gypsy picking a pocket
Depict me like David Hicks holding that rocket
A mix breed of Scottish and a modern day Australia's
Home but Mundine treats us like an alien, no
Man fuck that
Singing Waltzing Matilda with my rucksack
Cut back on the ego, leave rap to the albino
Rip you quicker than teeth wrapped around a T-bone
See know evil speech insightful
Solid gold heat like Hussein's rifle
I'm spiteful, only loyal if it's like that
Starve man's best friend, he's gonna bite back
What, it's just the way that it is
Dig your grave like letting Michael J play with your kids
I can't live in this world full of rock heads
Finding a good one like finding the Lochness
Monster, and not Kody Scott
But down for my team and known what I got
When it's my shot, take it never look back
Or ever make it, dedicated to my fate a known gladiator
Yeah your favourite, I run with wind
Pauly Poltergeist and the Brothers Grimm, yeah you know me


[Verse 4: Trials]
Rest in peace bottom feeders, the scourge of the earth
Proof God doesn't need us, from fetus to birth
First mums didn't plan me, so meet plan B
The worker bee, Ron Burgendy where the pants be
Quite a big deal, ninety something kilo
Aim for the best but got Shaq at the free throw
I'm overweight, shit I can't hold a job but I can hold a steak
Wash it down with a bunch of brown bottles
Plutonic made it for snake charmers
The bass bang harder than face planting in chain armour
Heavy metal, hammers banging the hangover
In my head space, until it's dead weight
Until the next day, return of the Jedi
Sun up to sun down, return of the red eye
Dr Jeckle, Mr Trials
Mean me on on the beat be the recipe for rest in peace",https://genius.com/Drapht-rest-in-peace-lyrics
