All Fall Down,Computer Love,2008,"Joelistics Verse 1
Twin towers, new police powers, petrol in the bowsers
We all fall down
Big liars, new world messiahs, political survivors
We all fall down from
New concern, bird flu's and phantoms strike back at random
We all fall down like
Idea's and pop stars careers and fear of the fact that we all fall down like
Kids playing games, smacked up veins
We all feel pain and we all fall down like
Rodeo riders or lovers intertwined
We all climb high then we all fall down
How long do we have to wait
Before we realise it's too late
How long most we sing this song
Before we know something is wrong
Joelistics verse 2
Flag waving, chest pounding, war waging
We all fall down
Race riots, proud violence, big silence
We all fall down
Old hatreds, drunk celebrations, confrontation
We all fall down like
Mark Latham, Pauline Hanson or Skase in his mansion
We all fall down
Misused authority, refused apology's, world wide economy's
We all fall down
Resource robbery, third world poverty, hushed up atrocity
We all fall down
How long do we have to wait
Before we realise it's too late
How long most we sing this song
Before we know something is wrong
How long do we have to wait
Before we realise it's too late
How long most we sing this song
Before we know something is wrong",https://genius.com/Tzu-all-fall-down-lyrics
Axis Tilt,Computer Love,2008,"The city is on acid
The city is on... fiyaah!
The city is on acid... fiyaah!

Paint a picture with language and memory
Beaten into shape with the rhythm and melody
My performance more like therapy
Translate poetry to punishable heresy
And so you know it, cliche's the enemy
Freestyle skill level more like telepathy
Word play grey matter designed for damaging
Down for chaos, getting up to anarchy
And I'm managing, heart beat galloping
And I'm actually gravity's mannequin
And I'm back again, there in the front
Tryna make sense but sense don't come
It don't matter, tonight I'm brave
My behaviour strange and depraved
I stay awake for days on end
With an MPC and a mic and a pen
I got a problem with space, there's lots of it
In the city, I can't get enough of it
I like the touch of it, infinite rush of it
In life, we stand on the cusp of it
In death, we dress in the best of it
That's the promise that we keep when we borrow from it
It takes a body and a heart to stay solid
You got a heart, tell me what you get from it


City got reception, cross interference
Speed through tunnels, rap feel got the clearance
Slack on the beat like smack on the dealers
Watch the beat drop, street got heat
Not one of them on me, fear not, I'm fearless
You can fake fantasy but can't fake the realness
Cause the dumpsters got the landfill in it
And the waste of the city, some stealing it
And these words are a back alley deal and it
Ain't that hard for you to tell who's feeling it
Cause mama got a gun and she's holding it
Hip Hop interrogator still not solving it
Dropout demonstrator, finger on the pulse
Can't ever take the heart or the soul from it
Drunk, sober, the night ticks over
As the rays of the sun draw closer
Shed light on the ugliness running this
In a cipher outside the pub and shit
Magic, ignite like matchstick
Still pumping out smoke with the factories
Plug into the feed, now fantasy
No game, now to play all reality
No switch for you to go and rerecord it
Move foreword, the future calls
And all four walls are like Mediatronic
Snow crash the brain, no trees for the forest
The streets in chaos, are the demons upon us?
Or are we the beings who be bringing on the ruckus?

Language is a virus that breeds in the silence
Feeds on the minds of people who devised it
Books and the poems and the slang that designed it
Reality defined by the words we assign it
We gave a name to the apple and the diamond
Dive in the depth in the realm of Poseidon
Speak with a breath that ring like the horizon
Meaning has a melody that rings like a siren
Sings like a siren, spins like a DJ
Playing for the players in the Arkham Asylum
Now hit the replay and analyse timing
And look what I made harnessing lightning
To battle the right-wing and travel the day
See what the night bring, get out of the way",https://genius.com/Tzu-axis-tilt-lyrics
Burning Up,Computer Love,2008,"You might be on the street with a
Feeling that's got you beat and you
Can't wake and cannot sleep ever
The pain is burning
Deep, Deeper now
But don't you worry
Hey, yeah
I'm burning up I'm burning up
One more time, yeah
Just burning up just burning up
One more time, I'm
I'm burning up I'm burning up one more time
Over there
Yeah burning up yeah burning up one more time
Stand up if you hear me
All you have is what you need and the
Light is on now don't you see ever
Just wake up from your sleep brother
Get off that mercy seat
When you fall you'll find your feat coz I
Know you got something beating up, beating up
Got something burning deep in ya
Can you feel that fire heating up?
I feed the fire with the fuel of my words
I hold a match to my lips so i can sit and watch it burn
Your burden is mine man I've seen when you shine
But now i can't recognise nothing in you
I called you up to pursue you just brushed me off
I don't judge the drugs i just need you to stop
The cost is the people you've lost and for what
You got burnt chasing dragons from the madness they breathe
You're murdering dreams and that's just simple and plain
And it's the saddest thing to watch you nodding off on a train
And everyone who loves you feels they are to blame
And now we watch on as you fade (as you fade)
I wanna shake every dealer and slap him in the face
I wanna take away your craving for just one more taste
I wanna see you get your life back on track and win
Cause if you conquer this you can do anything
Well it's a fine fine line
It's a fine fine line
Everytime
You'll all forgive him for all the people he's hurt
For every unkind word for every turn for the worse
Well it's a fine fine line
And it's hard to define, but don't you worry
Hey, yeah
I'm burning up I'm burning up
One more time, yeah
Just burning up just burning up
One more time, I'm
I'm burning up I'm burning up one more time
Over there
Yeah burning up yeah burning up one more time
I am the voice of the people that you let down
I am the noise in ya head that don't make a sound
The cold sweats and the walls that you crawl around
The light shining on you when you're in your dark hour
I am the gunpowder that you start the fire with
The fire burning in your chest there beneath your ribs
I am the differences that you're now forgiven for
The hard worn lesson learnt that regret taught
I am the tympani the strings in your symphony
The things you do differently the things you'll do eventually
I am the dignity of overcoming pain
I am the flame and the blaze and the ash that remains
I am you and my name is change
It's a fine fine line
And it's hard to define, but don't you worry
Hey, yeah
I'm burning up I'm burning up
One more time, yeah
Just burning up just burning up
One more time, I'm
I'm burning up I'm burning up one more time

Computer Love,Computer Love,2008,"Every planet that we come across
Is empty and there's only us
Fall down, then we get back up
Hard wired for computer love
Computer love, computer love
Computer love, computer love
Hard wired for computer love

I'm a modern day +Blade Runner+, take cover
Code breaker with a stun gun called a microphone
Take an upper and a painkiller brother
Insane how we suffer on this planet that we call home
Time travelling through the universe
Third stone from the sun on battleship Earth
Hunt down all the +Replicants+, clones in the tenements
Probe this planet for intelligence
Is there life on Mars or on any other stars?
Is there anybody out there or are we all alone?
Call on the telephone, only get a dead tone
Maybe this is all that there is right?
Send a satellite out into the dark night
Knowing that the whole time it might be lifeless
Split an atom with a drum pattern
These are the impressions of a planet in crisis


Yo, computer love
Jump in cortex brain response
Limbs shake, this bass is way beyond
On this ball we all dance upon
Stratosphere, atmosphere and love
Up in the cosmic octave
We chase down alien life to rock with
And back on Earth we just got this
Hot piece of rock that we call the shots with
We're just a blister in the sun
In the infinite distance up above
You go fathom universal forces
Oh shit, I think I just lost my orbit
But fear is a fact that I forfeit
So I walk where the eye of the storm is
Let your mind spin right off course
Into a black hole full of soul, so gorgeous",https://genius.com/Tzu-computer-love-lyrics

Get Up,Computer Love,2008,"Get up, come on {X2}
Don't get stuck

Get up, get up {X4}

I got a good fan, a valuable lady
And we used to live close, then she moved away yeah
She was having a sea change, then she met a man
With working hands and a bitter can
What can you do? You give 'em your blessings and give a damn
Well hold up, a couple months later
It turns out her man is something of a hater
So far away from us was an emotional cripple sounding dangerous
Well I said ""Get out"" and she said ""Hold on""
And the tone went dead on the telephone, c'mon

Get up, get up
(Pack up your bags and move on)
Get up, get up
(Don't let this madness go on)
Get up, get up
(Pack up them bags and move on)
Get up, get up
(Don't let this madness go on)

He was a young man out to get what he could man
A prodigal son who would never let anyone inside his head
Never the less he'd captured this girl
With a head full of dreams under her curls
She'd changed his world but couldn't sustain it
Complicated that was his life it seems
He wasn't all bad, he dreamt of a fam
He never had anything to do with his dad
Quick to get mad and raise up his fists
And fuck with the things he treasured the most
Treating his girl like property
Never been taught how to love properly
Jealously burning his brain
A poisonous venom, aggression, he's making no sense
Preventing her leaving and seeing her friends
Telling her things that sounded like threats
No one could guess why she was with him
Tomorrow he's gonna be different, is he?

He gets you down

Always seems so hard to get out",https://genius.com/Tzu-get-up-lyrics
Got to Do,Computer Love,2008,"It just hit the season, everyone breeding
Slap on my face, elevate my breathing
I just gotta see her so I'm off and leaving
Tracks wind back to the coliseum
The villagers and aristocrats uneasy
Horde for the spectacle, they want to see me
The sun done shine as they take their seating
Arms in the air, wave around like seaweed
And nothing be as good as you chick
We got a special unique loose fit
And everything we do is to prove we tuned in
We sticking to each other like paper to glue stick
Reminds me of kittens and newspaper
Slipping in and out of it all like two vapours
Intertwined and we smoke ring crusaders
Caught in a crux, I'm calling it love or
All that above and below the surface
This contact sport got me sort of nervous
Bliss, with an itty-bitty sort of purpose
Likely to cause all sorts of hurt, let's go

One thing that I really want to do
Get close and personal with you
That's one thing I just got to do
Eh, eh, eh
Caught deep in the deepness of the blue
I'm sick from the sweetness of ah you
You're one thing I just got to do
Eh, eh, eh

You got class like red wine and soul tunes
And when you laugh, you can light up a whole room
You play your mind like a beautiful instrument
Cut a fool down to size with your intellect
Yeah I know you're kind of scared of getting intimate
We both hold back from really getting into this
Well let's risk it, see what come
Because we fit together like bass line to bass drum
I know you got a lot to do love
We all do love, looking for true love
And ain't it just like love to get you confused love
Win and lose love, well then we'll make new love
We all run from something so strong
We give up, then we get back on
We both get busy with a lot to do
But if you'd like, well I'd like to do a lot with you, so c'mon



Sometimes it's early in the morning
Outside the sun is shining
So we just stay in bed
The world is ours, we can pretend
Sometimes it's late into the evening
We are silent, we ain't speaking
Because nothing can be said
Round and round it goes again

Mondays,Computer Love,2008,"Alarm bells and ringing and I'm up and out of bed
Coffee's in the pot, it's on the go, it's on the boil
Six in the morning and I'm jumping on the train and
Once again it's Groundhog Day
And I catch a glimpse of the man I am
My life did go according to plan
I went to high school, university and then a steady job
Two kids and a divorce I got burnt from
I pay my tax like everyone else
And I can't relax like anyone else
And I can't believe that it's coming around
So I brace myself for a nervous break down
Quick step, I ain't got time to think
More stress every single time I blink
The nine to five lullaby worldwide
Day to day grind got me asking if there's more to life, c'mon

Wake up on Mondays, uh oh
Making my coffee, uh oh
Day's fall like dominoes
That's just what I know
All I need to know, uh oh

All I need to know
Lunch break coming and I need a pickup
I got nothing but some emptiness inside of my gut
I got rubbing eyes crazily, I'm vaguely lost
I've got automatic pilot on the albatross
When you take a good look and see it piling up
An order will be executed by the robots
Cause they running the show, yeah they calling the shots
And every Monday morning we just want to call it all off
But even in the thick of it different trials are lost
In a court that we thought would never suffer a loss
I'm taking a long walk, no I ain't taking a bus
I need a minute to configure or I'm gonna combust, so wake up


We walk into the walls like ghosts that haunt the night
Almost dead before we die
And this ain't no kind of lie
Takes more than all of these long days to make me face up
To the fact that nothing changes
What is this that keeps me running?
What is this that keeps me running?
What is this that keeps me running?

Newspapers talking bout war in the Middle East
I don't see it so I leave it to the war chiefs
Murder one gunman in the city streets
I don't feel it cause it's just another news brief
To get my wage I've lost lots of days
I've locked up my rage for the money that I'm paid
And my attitude is do what you need
But what will it mean next century?
And I'm daydreaming that today will be my last day
I'll either leave or throw grenades in my work place
And would I even know if the world explodes?
I'mma quit my job, pack my bags and go

Myriam's Song,Computer Love,2008,"This is the story of a girl and boy who fell in love
And then love kicked them both in the groin
It all began when they were both young fresh out of high school
Clutching at their hearts like a soldier does a rifle
She was on a holiday, He was on a road trip
They both arrived up North like postage
He was from a working class suburb of Sydney
She was from a European Family of privilege
And then they met and suddenly there’s romance
They took the ride like look ma no hands
Six million human beings living on the planet
These two managed to meet and make magic
French Chorus
She said she saw him for the first time outside
Dancing in the rain to the rhythm of a swing band
He said his memory of meeting her was vague
He claimed that his friend introduced them on the boulevard
They had a chemistry like lightning and kite flying
They both recognised fate in the fine print
He had a quick mind and she had a sharp wit
They used to make love and both feel their heart’s skip
They lived together on an island on a river
Coconut diet fresh fish caught for dinner
Naked in the morning when they bathed and washed
They were happily lost like time had stopped
They were first time lovers in an endless summer
Sleeping in a hammock with no need for covers
Hearts full of courage reminiscing of thunderstorms
Learnin how to love like it had never been done before
French Chorus
Reminisce
It makes me sad when I think about it now how
They fought hard when they made it to the third round
Mistrust crept in and they both dropped the ball
Neither one read what was written there on the wall
Eventually she left and she flew back home
To start a new life in a different time zone
He got a phone call 5 years down the road
Maybe they could meet, have a drink and maybe say hello
They had dinner and compared their memories
Had a little cry about all their petty jealousies
He didn’t blame her and she didn’t blame him
First time love is such a delicate thing and still
Since then they’ve become good friends
They talk about their new lovers in the present tense
And as a monument to what had come and gone
They sat down together and they wrote a sweet love song
French Chorus",https://genius.com/Tzu-myriams-song-lyrics
Number One,Computer Love,2008,"I got to be number one, gotta be number one
Come on, yeah
Count Bounce verse 1
Love and politics, sex and sadness
Step by step all tryna be the baddest
When the storm come better check your ballast
I and pray that the wind blow dust upon your canvas
Reach for the stars, pray not for failure
When you're stuck in the pit with all the other gladiators
Lookin for more meaning reason to keep living
Climb to the top cause the race needs winning
Want to be a radiant sun that shines forever
Through better or worse we gotta keep things spinning
Fame, recognition, purpose and vision
With a small little snake in your ear cold hissing
Want to hear the music? Go buy tickets
But kick it on the street with the freaks in the village
Feelin too green, soak up the spillage
Who is the number one champion in your village?
I got to be number one
Wanna be number one? Gotta beat on your drum like this
Gotta be number one

Joelistics verse 2
Said the world's obsessed with the competition winner
But all that glitter's not gold, (no)
The trophy and the cheddar don't define a man's measure
Man you gotta get it in your soul
And you can heed the pressure or turn your back
Follow your own path or follow the pack brother
Go discover what you love in life
The aim of the game is to love your life
And if daddy don't tolerate loser's in the family
You tell him he can stick his sausage in the pantry
If he gets hot headed then pull a funny face
Kick him in the shins and choke him with a shoelace
Cash athletics. You commin last?
Become an academic, give your life to the arts
You'll get more girls and have more fun
And anyway the mainstream's for suckers and chumps
I got to be number one
Wanna be number one? Gotta beat on your drum like this
Gotta be number one

Crack the bitumen, haters we gear shifting them
Lovers we give em rhythm to blast out they're system with
You ain't feelin em cool we still delivering
Brilliant chassis shimmerin grinnin the wheels spinnin em out

Back on the beat like a week of Fridays

And people wanna know what kind of fuel we drive with
How we get from A to B clockin up mileage
We move like a stylus no fear for rejection
What's the new sound, what's the new direction and
Is it outrageous to smile at strangers ???
Do you have a concept for all of your changes ???
The truth of the matter we don't drive with a map
We don't know where we're going
We only know where we're at
So we check for road signs, know when to go signs
Roads with no signs, we're out on a limb and we
Use our own minds, treat em like gold mines
So we got the right of way when we're doing our thing

Step With the Pressure,Computer Love,2008," {X2}
Step with the pressure like...
They say something and we say it better
They do nothing and we stay fed up
Everyday pressure, gonna ease up never
Step to the rhythm or fall back forever

From my early days of having this rapping inside my Adam's apple
Crashing computers from all the data I done babbled
Travelling, I saddled up subject to catalogue
Push a bit to battle on, knowing what goes on
Pressured with the everyday wrestle and navigate
I focus and I hope for the best and try and get it straight
My map made from ice age provisions
And time-space continuums, tirades in rhythm
My highlight conditions of folk, hard living, who won't
Start sinking, they float and keep swimming, they know
They're on a mission from God like Blues Brothers
And man we're all brothers and damn we all suffer like
Goddamn sinners, we all stand together
We all face the pressure, all laced with melancholy
It ain't metaphoric, man it's really meteoric
And this rap is for him, her and everybody
 {X2}

From the first episode in the embryo
Every step upon the world got its ebb and flow
Things figure, well some you never know
You can feel the tension like a cello doing tremolo
We forward and back, cause we caught in a trap
We all walk on and you know we never know when we gonna get back
Somebody open the latch and let me speak like ""ahh, breath catch""
Well I read about the capitals pedestalling the valuable resource
But is actual fact it's just a chaperone
And I can see the neon flashing and creeping into the future
Just to deepen all the damage done
And every citizen riddled within ambivalence
Gazing into the distance at a Babylon
But every human in the place, any familiar face
We got a long track to travel on

Reflecting Off That,Computer Love,2008,"Shh..
Deceptacon rap
reflecting off that
Deceptacon rap
reflecting off that

I am from a generation raised on TV
And every other day I behave like E.T.
Believe me, pop culture conceive me
Jump food for thought bought from a canteen
Yeah, clogging up my head and defining my damn dreams
Yeah, 'aint it funny how shallow it can seem
Indeed, like the rhythm of a drum machine
Locked into the grid as if you know what I mean
See it every day of the week
From the billboard to the shoes on your feet
It's in the way I speak, It's in the way I dress
It's everywhere like sex and death
These, advertisements, hypnotisers,
catch the virus, loud noise and violence,
look outside yourself and get set
Get in line to get your head checked

(reflecting off that)
(you now how we do)
(reflecting off that)
(deflecting off that)
(you know how it is around here)
(reflecting off that)

(So kick it on)
I never had information, just a radio in the basement
From the top 40 to underground statements
Heart palpitations for primitive cavemen
Pools of information for any occasion
Flood your synapse with your tools of engagement
Any interface from throughout the ages
From the print press to the binary matrix
From your front door to a seat on a spaceship
Strap yourself in, it's a hell of a ride
Simulated and created with a limitless eye
Broadband or crack whore a sign of the times
Inundated, pixilated, updated design

My shirt, my shoes, my aftershave
My car, my coat, my brand name
My TV and my DVD
My laptop and computer screen
Reflecting off that
(can you see yourself) reflecting off that
(can you see your girl) reflecting off that
(can you see the whole world) reflecting off that

So is it in the wallet you stole but gave back
Or was it in the job you had but got sacked
Is it in the boot of the car you first had
Or was it in the digital tape you 8 tracked
Is it in the lover you let into your draws
is it in the cause you're willing to fight for
Is it in the heart that keeps your blood warm
Is it in the pregnant pause
And when we talk with the grey old man
or is it at the festival rocking to the band
Is it at home alone where you crash
Or is it in the jokes you tell when you're smashed
Is it in the form of loss or the dawn of lust
Is it in all of us and is it juiced enough
To catch a glimpse reflecting off that
And then see yourself reflecting right back

My shirt, my shoes, my aftershave
My car, my coat, my brand name
My TV and my DVD
My laptop and computer screen
Reflecting off that
(can you see yourself) reflecting off that
(can you see your girl) reflecting off that
(can you see the whole world) reflecting off that

Yeah I take it easy like Allakazzam
Like a poker player playing with a devilish hand
Stress don't impress me that ain't part of the plan
It don't do nothing at all like boobs on a man
I do what I can to push and make it better
Combat dilemma with a cool calm collected thought
I gotta brand new walk like a hovercraft
I gotta band and we're all fans of entourage
We got game like summer rain
Like some lovers who break then come again
Shoot like a sun of a gun
Never run of the mill
We at the top of the bill and until
We hit the peak and pass out
Baby it's time now
To stay up late until it's time to lie down
Life is so good I'm catching a buzz
They tell me it's S.A.C. what's that?
Sweet As Cuz
I won't let this world get me down
Speak my truth and hold my piece of ground
Keep your head when the whole worlds losing theirs
Some things you can change and some you can't
And mamma said ""son learn to tell them apart""
Take it easy, Take it easy
Take it Easy. (Just believe)
Count Bounce verse 2
So step up here and get the whole place ready
Kick up dust with in the camp like Kelly
On the dance floor where you feel so steady
Medicine for your heart beet remedy puncture
Let the air seep out the junction
Decompress complete delete function
Try to get by like said a McCartney
Wake up the neighbours with a hell of a party
Shake the zombies bring on the Klingons
Hey DJ you got anything we can sing on?
And take us down a track that we never ever been on
Cause I can feel it. I do hear it
I can not see but I do not fear it
I do hope soon we can all be near it
So lord give me grace and a good sound system
Or just a few good friends chillin in the kitchen
I won't let this world get me down (sing it sister)
Speak my truth and hold my piece of ground
Keep your head when the whole worlds losing theirs
Some things you can change and some you can't
And mamma said ""son learn to tell them apart""
Take it Easy, Take it Easy
Take it Easy (Just believe)
Take it Easy (Just believe)
Take it Easy (Just believe, come on)

We Got The Feeling,Computer Love,2008,"We Got The Feeling
Hey you guys ...
Good morning people
It feels so good don't it?
Joelistics verse 1
Back once again with the third instalment
Bubblin away we been lying dormant
Took a bit of time off we didn't want to force it
TZU still feelin' awesome
In the spirit of Henry Lawson
With a bit of Hendrix distortion
Me and Pip are like rhyming Mormons
Door to door man going back and forth and
South to Northern like body contortion
Push a boundary to break the boredom
With our music and rhythmic talkin'
And the feel is all important
Naturally high like a rush of endorphins
Get with it stay with it and warm it
Feel good, real fine and fortunate
You're tuning in from your hidden co-ordinate
To TZU now sing the chorus...
We got the feeling again
That good old feeling my friends
He's got the feeling and
She's got the feeling and we got the feeling again
Yeah
Count Bounce verse 2
We been on an island isolated
In the studio on a regular basis
We been prepared for the feeling we got
Cause it's bean along time but yeah we made it
Basic, complex, change the concepts
Inflect the rhythm to inject the bomb threat
Still clear in your ear, still on this track
Incredible when the beat crack
We the same fear man with a few more scars
A few more debts is the same old bars
A new concept like a jet to the stars
And if we walk this path will you follow
Or jam in complete disregard for tomorrow
We come this far and I hope that you want to
Join up for the ride cause we got the feel you on the same side
We got the feeling again
(feel that way) (X8)
We have come so far from where we started from
And we go on and on and on and on and on...
(we got the feelin') We have come
(we got the feelin') So far from where we started from
(we got the feelin') and we
(we got the feelin') Go on and on and on and on and on...
(Joelistics talking shittles over the top)
We got the feeling again
(Yes ladies and gentlemen
You tune back into TZU)
That good old feeling my friends
(We had a bit of a beak but now we're back
With that old familiar feeling)
He's got the feeling and
(Straight out of Melbourne
We're gonna take it out from here)
She's got the feeling and we got the feeling again
(We got all your familiar your faces
Mr Paso Bionics, Mr Yeahrock, Cow Patch and Joelistics)
Yeah
(Yeah, it's a beautiful day)
We got the feeling again
That good old feeling my friends

Beautiful,Millions of Moments ,2012,"They say he lives alone
He had a wife but that was long ago
The town drunk he always talks to himself
He says it's her and who are we to know
In the room down the hall on the second floor
Above the counter in the pub at the edge of town
Still living in his memory, obsessed with the act of remembering
The only one with a key into the cold room
He replays the scene and she's there with him now
Standing drunk like a leper on the threshold
Broke down staring at the emptiness and he says
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
Your beautiful grotesque love

They say he couldn't live with himself
Blood on his hands but that was long ago
He found his love lying silent and still
In room four, that's how the story goes
And now he comes back every night to drink there
The same place long ago where she was found
Still air crackling, cold feeling back again
He unlocks the door but never goes in
A woman's face in the window stares him down
A shiver runs up the back of his neck
But he won't cross the line of the dead
When he says
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
Your beautiful grotesque love

You visit me in darkness, every night I find you
Deliver me from torment, no light will guide you
I wish that there was some way, to bring you back beside me
I wish that there was some way, some way, some way, ay, ay, ay
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
Your beautiful grotesque love",https://genius.com/Tzu-beautiful-lyrics
Back Up!,Position Correction,2003,"This is a rap attack
It goes goes rata-tat-ta-tat-ta-tat-tat-tat-tat
My cookies where choc-chip and my Stussy's were black
I chuck a wheelie on my BMX in my trackie-daks
And then I tic-tac on my blue Tony Hawks
I was king of the handball court by age 4
Before I scored the highest score on Shinobi
I was doing sword tricks and more like Kenobi
The only boney homie staying true
Watching Monkey Magic and my man Doctor Who
My crew represents all the way from the eighties
I got the funky tales the comet of Haylies
Like the old movies, Tron and Goonies
And I used to diss my sister when she shopped at Katie's
So back up, back up
You take it too serious
Woah, you need to go and see a therapist
No, we’re not your average
We are one love up and we hold the advantage
Back up, back up
You know not
Back up, back up
You hypocritical chaps
Back up, back up
You robots
You can take pot shots but we shoot you right back
Cool like KITT from Knight Rider
And mad resourceful like my man McGyver
The best tree climber of the underage minors
More hardcore than anyone recognises
Fool, yeah, you know what I mean
I’m not Mr T but I’m on the A-team
I raid the liquor cabinet until my face turned green
I eat the Nutri-Grain like a man of i-ron-
E, We have yet discovered
F, It’s back to mum’s liquor cupboard
G, Can my mates sleep over?
H, Hell no you won’t get any shut
I, couldn’t spell very good
Why? ‘cause I watched too much TV
Cry, when my brother beat me
It was up with an uppercut
And down to the corner shop
So back up, back up
You take it too serious
Woah, you need to go and see a therapist
No, we’re not your average
We are one love up and we hold the advantage
Back up, back up
You know not
Back up, back up
You hypocritical chaps
Back up, back up
You robots
You can take pot shots but we shoot you right back
Remember calculator watches, Volley Dunlop trainers
And before crossfaders we used Lightsabers
An angry mother run cover chew your Life Savers
She’s worse then the threat of Boba Fett or Darth Vader
I had GI Joe figures and regular sugar binges
On the couch after school with the Teenage Mutant Ninja's
I used to pretend I was in the Special Forces
Hidden camo nets but now my ammo gets recorded
Yeah, my clothes on the floor, never in the clothes drawer
Raw data Salada, like a commodore 64’s
I’m the Hulk with jaw, Wolverine with claws
No I'm the Human Torch full of fire from the Fantastic Four
In ’84 my folks split up
So now I godda get the floor and just dope this shit up
And I wasn’t really old when I was in the ‘80’s
So I do it for the mothers and I do it for the babies

Curse of the Word,Position Correction,2003,"Ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum-ba-dum...

Are you in it for the fame or the dames or the untamed
Need to explain? It's a shame so many rappers
Sound so lame when they tell you their name
And proclaim they are worth international acclaim
They just sound the same like they just found the game
And they play it like pilots grounded in name
Now refrain cause I'm fed up again
Hip Hop became like a storehouse chain
Too plain, too stained by the individuals
Sounding typical, identical to every other fool
While they're tryna rock and drop shit, I'm dropping rocket jewels
Cool, breaking all the rules
So smoke your sense samilla, painkiller from Manilla
This is gorilla B-Ball, fair on the snare
For the blue-collar worker working for the dollar
Holler loud if you think this system treats you unfair
Sunup to sundown, runners up get run down
Beat in the forefront back to the background
Back down while I bounce around
And I go to town and break ground
Cause I'm about more than eight bars in a punch line
I'm about more than battle raps in a party rhyme
I'm about more than tall tales of street crime
Each time I rhyme, it's sublime
I'm about more than the ""Yes, yes y'all""
Throw your hands in the air, sing ""Hey, hey""
But if you only understand the lowest common denominator
I'mma give you what you want and some shit to ponder later
Ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum...

I will verse with word, immersed in the word
Fight with the word when I flirt with the word
Take flight with the word when I work with the word
Shine bright with the word when I recite words
Cursed with the word, I am bursting with words
Nursing the word when word is born
Verb to noun torn when I perform
Now I form a storm with these words well worn
I'd like to have a word with the world at large
With words I'll weave this work of art
Pull it apart and put it all back together
Word for word, now letter for letter
Hm, front lawn to my backyard slang
I'm doing my thang when I chill and hang
I bring the bang like GANGgajang
Now let me take a second just to pay for the tang
For all your critics who chill and relax
Listen up to the snare kicking the hats
And if it collapse then we'll fill in the gaps
Cause we meant it to happen like that, perhaps
And all the fanatics who be loving the tracks
I'll make your sign ap-snap like whip cracks
The better the beat and the better the raps
And we'll put it all down on 24-tracks
Ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum...

Yeah, yeah, yeah...
One and two and three, music move the feet
For centuries people use the beat
To free the speech and keep the peace
And speak the defeat to assemble the ritual
Reach the deep and recite the spiritual
Ignite the literal insight from another identity
Massively fascinate the attention of man
Impact just like disaster can
Demonstrate the crux of who you am
Invigorate the body, carry out the master plan
From cumulonimbus to altostratus
The soul apparatus of the artist
The light-hearted and cathartic
Soul of the solitude, heart of the party
A cardiac arrest, a sarcastic activist, a catalyst
For copious amounts of cannabis listen, now...

Jig to the rhythm, this inhibition is definition of what?",https://genius.com/Tzu-curse-of-the-word-lyrics
Good Dog,Position Correction,2003,"Now, let we warm this beat up and then put my feet up
Turn the system up and then we'll blow the speakers
We've come to fill your cup until it flows over
We've got more flows then there are rich people driving range rovers
Now, Call me Noah cos you know I never spring leaks
I bring more heat to these beats then a flame thrower
Tight like a boa' Krakatoa mamma-mia
We're blowing up like Aaliyah??
Word to Melbourne my sister by brethren
It's all in the family here like Tasmanian loving, yeah
We go to work on 'em, then go berserk on 'em
We go where no one's gone before get captain Kirk on 'em
So come on get into it, these flows move fluid
We came to hit you with a little bit of our music
And guys love it when girls shake their big bottoms
So come do what your body feels the beat warrants
One day I'll make Bjork my wife
And we can share hot nights
In the land of ice
'Til then I'll rock the back clubs pubs and shitty dives like
Psilocybin up-sliding absorbent minds
I can make it hard for you hard headed guys
I can point out that the government lies
I can make the lord of the dance lord of the flies
I can even make a Christian believe god switched sides
Which is why you better perk up, I get worked up
I drink encyclopaedias and lyrics get blurghked up
I shudder to think, what I could do with this ink
Just some paper and pen, my mic mouth and some phlegm
And when I begin and begun, weapon concealed by a tongue
Ammo inside my two lungs, letting the beat run then I'm killing it
And no you don't want to miss it
I'm different, this is the sum of my spirit, in it and everything near it
Lyrics like babies delivered, word is born
I'll even make an atheist believe it and say ""good god""
It's all about a good time and if your
All out of order get feeling better
I want your daughter, wants someone better
Work it out, come on, work it out
Now It's all about a real good time
And if you feel all out of order get feeling better
Man I want your daughter, she wants someone better
Work it out, come on, work it out
We'll take the piss, escape your disses
Smoke your spliffs and take your misses
Like Moses, I'm gonna part MC's
Like David and Goliath, don't even try it
I'm half in it for the art and half as a joke
Just something to do while the human race chokes
And hopefully inspire a rebel alliance
Take the empire and meddle with science
So they won't cut genomes or make smoke free zones
I'll die an organism puffin' on your Al Capone's
Hey bong smokers, who's in the house?
Chilling on your sofas dodgy bottles in your mouths
This if for the yuppies the monks the hussies
And the musicologists and border collie puppies
So rock to the rhythm like a Casio rap man
Listen to my bloke on the decks from Pakistan
Aw shit, that's fat man
Elastic bands can't flex like this
We give ya gastro when we're dropping our shit
We turn it up, like heaters in Darwin
You digging my jargon? Check what's happening
I got more ladies then the men in the Vatican
I rocked first floor now I'm ready for Madison
Step to my tower like my name was Sarumon
Joal wrote that cos my flows are gelatinous
Sometimes I suck, other times I'm fabulous
I got more hippy chicks then a rock of Amethyst
I got more props then cops got cannabis
I got more fame then freight trains got carriages
My brain waves to blame, I got speech flatulence
I blow up spots, like teenage acne
Got so much ?? everybody wants to...
It's all about a good time and if your
All out of order get feeling better
I want your daughter, wants someone better
Work it out, come on, work it out
Now It's all about a real good time
And if you feel all out of order get feeling better
Man I want your daughter, she wants someone better
Work it out, come on, work it out
Get the picture?
Get the picture?
It's all about a good time and if your
All out of order get feeling better
I want your daughter, wants someone better
Work it out, come on, work it out

Humans act the same when they dance to this sample
Like hammers to anvils, whack MC's get cancelled
Tzu hold the title, I just can't hold a candle
We're shining examples of some lyrical vandals
A rocking ensemble that be known for scandal
I'm one of the handful of these hands who command
Cool mics with the lyrical integrity on rambles
I'll grab them by the ankles and make them take flight
I radiate light like a flare at night
Now, we do this like no other so don't stereotype
We'll rock any stereo with any type of mic
At gigs we get hyped to crowds they get psyched
Bring life to dead nights cultivate the vibe right

We rock in mono, don't need surround sound
Got more style then Franko Coso's got beds in Brundswik town now

You gonna get down, do something
Music you lose it to, that's ok
Anyway it's all a casual affair and we don't really care because we're
Back packing rap patterns that fashion fat Latin
Bush walking nut cracking word smith tacticians
Essentially there's many things that make my crew different
And if you're off rhythm we'll give you treatment to
Correct you position now, make your decision now
Move to this rhythm and choose with this rhythm
Stock with ammunition to rock your whole condition
And lock down the rhythm when the rhyme is upon us
Drop the coalition, politicians in office
Who cut back on education like they cut the forests
Then increase the budget for my military horrors
Social programs get jammed for top dollars
And bureaucrats and fat cats stab backs
With mad tax that hit and trap poor buggers
Their hard hearts come from hard margin profits
They get beat down from beats and street sonnets
To Hop Hop, we giving you, don't pop for revenue
Too hot but all of your respect goes to those who
Stand up and demonstrate pumped up to penetrate
Rebels and renegades break down the barricades
Aggravate the main stream, cripple with conformity
And watch it burn in the light of rhyme revelry
Anarchy, (woop) let's ruin their games
I keep an honest approach to stick up my rhyme play",https://genius.com/Tzu-position-correction-lyrics

A cool drink of lemonade, doing nothing all day (uh huh)
Summer days and the yummy displays (uh huh)
Mangos, nectarines, apricots and grapes (uh huh)
Summer days, and I get blazed (uh huh)
Rolling up big Js, sparking up them flames (uh huh)
Summer days, and the boring girl games
And the long hot nights that make you wanna misbehave

It's too hot, slip-slop-slap the sun block
The soundtrack to summer is deep dub and Hip Hop
And crank the boom box while we bellyflop in rivers
With some Coopers Pale Ale to exercise the livers

People assemble in the watery spots and
Get drunk and disorderly lots and
Do nought cause it's awfully hot and
Keep the party constant J., what you reckon?

Summer days we chase a cool embrace and drift
And let the world exist with no stress, we chill
A cool drink distilled and a sausage on the grill
If you can't get with that then you know that we will

Bumping in your car speakers (with loud frequencies and)
Food eaters, (my man we make it seasonal)

Well it's the hot day anthems ringing in your ears
And we've been waiting so long for clouds to clear
So we jump in the car and we turn up the beats
And we rock to the river and bounce to the beach

And sweet sweat drip drop like rain
Like when love gets made into the middle of the day
Sticky-icky, I live in the inner of Melbourne city
My budget for the week barely a dollar fifty

Heat waves wriggle of the bitumen
To pre-eighties reggae, to which we're listening
The city's an oven, cook me like lasagne
I sink a few beers and pray for rain and thunder

But nothing refresh like a summer thunderstorm
The skyline confined by the cloud forms
We sleep butt-naked and leave the fan on
Camped on futons, summer nights are long

The Horse You Rode In On,Position Correction,2003,"SeedMC verse 1
I'll give you one chance to answer (answer)
These rhymes don't seem to match up (match up)
You'd better go and call for backup (backup!)
Cause this shit's gonna publicly crash your systems and isms and formulaic flows
Every day it goes to try and get votes but don't know the correct tactics
You think you're immaculate
In fact you think yourself apt at it but you're just crap at it
You're inaccurate, hotheaded like a Capulet wanker
Check my slant on it, give me a beat and I'll dance on it while you act robotic
Just another puppet
Now I'm no prophet, but the rhymes you vomit
Are the uranium deposits and the genocides you closet
Old growth forests, first you go and log it
Then you get your planes and with napalm you bomb it
And in the meantime take an indigenous culture and rob it
Now as a citizen, I've asked you to stop it
But you haven't so now I grab this vocal and just cock it
So draw your weapons (woop)
Too late there we go
I send you back with my raps banging in your stereos
Fuck you
And your long list of isms
You, and the holes you put pigins
Me, and my own inhibitions
And fuck you and you and in addition
You and your patriotism
You and your religionisms
You and your criticisms
And if you don't like it then don't fucking listen
Joelistics verse 2
Fuck you and that horse you rode in on
That high horse you get on from bullshit you where fed on
This rap is the kick back from toes you tread on
The people that you pick on
What? Because there different from you?
Check you attitudes those narrow views are bound to be the death of you
Swing back at you and hit you up black and blue
And we'd all been better off if you’d been born mute
You step up to talk and you start to go on
It's question time, listen I've got my suspicions
Ignorance plagues up this planet that we live on
You might think this song is about rappers, you're wrong
It's about people who use power to trip on
My aim is dead on from my room with a view
It's too true we all have some flaws to admit to
So fuck it, guess what, this rap is about me
I'd rap this sonnet in the senate if I could
If I thought for a second it would do any good
Well take a look, take a walk, read a book
Let's burn down the parliament and watch the flag cook
I'm using bogon and I'll take on all comers
You sexist, racist, homophobic fuckers
The dull, the dumb, the dirty and the dumber
My friend from overseas said this countries got the dumbest
Pull back the covers, read the newspapers
Listen to talk back radio, watch Neighbours
Talk to a politician or to a cop
Talk to Pauline in her fish and chip shop
I'm proud I'm Australian, whatever that means
Probably bad dreams if you're a refugee
I love our sunburnt country, I love it a lot
It's just a pity about all the redneck fucks!
Fuck you
And your long list of isms
You, and the holes you put pigins

The Travel Song,Position Correction,2003,"Note: Anything in italics is unknown. If you think you know what the words are feel free to edit away
Any time…
Lets fly this chicken coop and take the scenic route
The long way around there is no wrong way now
Lets sleep, eat and dream and savour our travels
And babble our stories to anyone who'll listen
You see I've walked the Himalayas singing praises to the music makers
Saddled up horses, Greyhound buses and aeroplanes
I've lived on riverbanks and in the tropics of this land
With an amazing lady all the way from Switzerland
I've driven in a Kingswood to the rhythm of Bob Marley (hey Joe)
With a friend who played a Cassidy to my roving Kerouac
I've slept by the road and I’ve hitch hiked the Hume
From Cedar Bay to Lady Bay to bain maries in diners
I've taken time slow, so slow that it grows and grows and grows
But how long? Who knows?
The open road moves, seduces and aligns you
And every road we happen down is to be continued
It loosens up this soul, the present tense resolved
Travelling unravelling this narrative that goes on
It swings us and swoons us and pulls us to push on
So far from home and where we come from
But it's love at first sight with the sights you see
Love affairs with the everywhere and everyone you meet
It nourishes the curious, the restless uncontained
We travel their path like blood in the veins
We free-falling, free-spacing, this world with free reign
Fall in love with love and love when we change untamed
I'll enjoy this view from this patch of ground
To all my companions whereever you are now
My smile stretches inside out and back around
Let's keep travelling
Keep travelling, travelling…
Keep travelling this earth while we're
Earth bound because its
Time to journey while this
World is turning while the
Sun is burning and this
Life's for learning so let's
Keep on moving making
Tracks snaking making
Maps trace the changing
Moons wax and waning
Heartaches for craving
Expeditions crazy
Strange food for tasting
Strange words and sayings
Strange strangers meeting
Open-minded people breeding
Keeping good relations, leaving footprints in your memory banks
Gutter-trash and of angle saints
And of missing cash and of better thanks
The way this world operates is sure to keep you spinning
West of Sundays, we’ll get there some day
Travel all ways in more ways then one
Remember where we’re from and how far we’ve come
To chase the rising sun on and beyond the back
We're on the track this song is rapped from hidden flats
Living out your suitcase, your sleeping bag, your back pack
Tap the source of troubadours, stay on course, we use the force
All nomads know that, all nomads know that
All nomads know that, come on all nomads know that
(all nomads know that, all nomads know that...)
Our cup is twisted, grease lift
I open up and read this as a grand and epic thesis never to be completed
On highways and bush tracks with trail mix in my backpack
Strangers becoming friends becoming friends becoming stranger
Caught in the rip of this ad-lib existence
Like being drunk in a pub somewhere screaming, ""I love this moment""
Rolling in the mists of too many spliffs
In conversations on the cusp of incidental love affairs
I’ve driven a truck called Bess from Alice to the Gippsland wilderness
Sat around the campfire with some crazy tribes at Confest
But none the less I’ve done my best to catch a fire and hold my breath
To cut my thumb and hope for the best but know that now is perfect
I've run the east coast circuit, zigzagged the Great Divide
I've found myself absurd and nervous mad in love magnified
I've talked to crazy hobos about the science of having no home
And beached comb a better one only stopping when the wind does
My vagabond drifting, call it searching for hunger
The hungry road digests me in its stomach of awe ingests me
There's a sign pointing left but I know my impulse to be right
The cafes are my lounge rooms & their bathrooms are my bathrooms
With an office in my pocket, fortune in my walking boots
I'll talk in tongues and spoon loose eating time and almonds
The tiniest of molecules floating in anything is possible
That small wind of intuition kicks me like a soccer ball
I find myself in Kakadu rapping rapidly down the avenues
Of ""where am I?"" and ""What have you?"" and it's time to go pick fruit (yeah)
'Cause this world is ripe and ready and I don’t want to stay in the same spot
I want to see it revolve from the bottom to the top
Yeah, expose myself to culture sunshine and raindrops
And gently become in tune to the path paved in the flow",https://genius.com/Tzu-the-travel-song-lyrics
Who?,Position Correction,2003," + (Seed MC)
First off, I'd like to offer you all a warm welcome
From here in Melbourne where the sun shines seldom (right?)
You might be anywhere at all in this world
B-boys and B-girls, we're bringing gems and pearls
And like you we're unique in the treasure we speak
And this music we make cultivates our belief
So, let me kick an introduction on the drums
And get beginnings begun and role call the components
My name is Joelistics (I'm Seed MC)
Paso's on the scratch and Yeroc works the beats

We are T-Z-U
How do you do? Do you
Do what you do cause you
Love to do what you do? We do

We started off on street sides with hand drums
Upgraded to this, we're the grandsons
Of diggers and widows, immigrants, engineers
Gamblers, jazz collectors and fishermen on piers
Our roots are panoramic, looser than pan-jamming
From Syd' to Melbs, New Plymouth to Pakistan
You could be on the bus daydreaming out the window
Or walking the bush track, it don't matter what you're in to
We've been chopping beats talking bout what we've been through
Now we've done the mic check, let the show continue

Cause these four fellas are Terence McKenna storytellers
Telling our tales and leaving trails like entrails
Tipping the scales until the cloud cover clears
And these weird ideas move minds and rears
From earliest beginnings to these current proceedings
From trees down to seedlings, we age well like Riesling
So while we're breathing people keep breeding
Tzu's mission statement is to keep on keeping

For the cats with no cash or the folks in the mansions
We formed the band for the thinkers and dancers
The one's curious looking for answers
 + (Joelistics)
The instrumentalists (rocking the jamming shit)
The gold medallists (or the swimming-in-dam kids)
The old settlers (or the tribes whose land it is)
The pub rockers (and the bar staff)
The fruit vendors (and the art smart bohemians)
The whole damn demographic
This band stops traffic from backstreet to paddock
(We put it down for the addicts and the fiends
And the friends who feel the soul of the music)

Da-da-da-da-dum, da-dum, da-dum
Da-da-da-da-dum, da-dum, da-dum
Da-da-da-da-dum, da-dum, da-dum

Wild Stylee,Position Correction,2003,"(In the track, in the track, aha!)

Comin' in a wild stylee
Your lookin kinda fly but your status is free
And all the fellas smile flirtatiously
But figure, your looking for the guy like me
Well the whole world wants to get to know you more
Like how you make love and how you like to explore
Well you just want to live adventurously
Ah, your looking for the guy like me
(this guys up there)
Yeah, your looks and glances, effect like arsenic
And the way you drive makes most guys car sick, man
I could play corners for eternity
Your looking for the guy like me
Now, one more thing that I think you should know (what?)
I dig you, I ain't chasin' though
You say you can't commit you want polygamy?
Well you're looking for the guy like me

(yeah bring it in here, come on
Come on Seed, do your thing)
Yeah, well let me have a look at you
You're the band and I'm booking you
I'm the venue and your the menu
And I'm the customer, how can I order you?
I admit I want to corner you, stop, and configure
This train is home bound
I believe you're a passenger
Your not from round here? What, you come from Canberra?
Intoxicated by her strong scent of lavender
I'm like ""would there be any chance that I can dance with ya?""
 x4
We're comin' in a wild stylee, it's a figure
Your looking for the guy like me
I walked through the door and it was you I saw (ouch)
Now every door I go through it's you I'm looking for
Eyes peeled to steel another glance of your
Fine firm figure form that made me drop my jaw
And what's more you got a sweet smile when you talk
And when you look away it's like your deep in thought
And I ain't that tall so I'm happy your short
Now I've just gotta gather up the courage to talk
And its a figure (what?)
I'm feeling giddy getting sicker
Well how should I approach the cutest kitten in the litter?
Should I drink more liquor and step like Godzilla
Flow like a river or let the vibes simmer
Or should I approach in a wild stylee
And just be myself and keep my style free
And maybe, while I've been looking for she
Coincidentally she's been lookin' for the guy like me

We're comin' in a wild stylee, it's a figure
Your looking for the guy like me

Nice (ah ha)
I love the way you do your own thing
A sense of humour like a bee sting
Lets eat chocolate and
Watch videos all weekend
Stay up late and then sleep in
The way you talk you got good flow
You got style by the truck load
If you where a program I'd love to file share and download
Let's play like big cats and antelope (browee)
I love the way you take your own time
You keep me hanging like a clothes line
Artistically inclined, Oh
You got a body and a beautiful mind
And if I'm like Adam, I think your Eve (that's me)
You make a brother like me believe (that's me)
I'd eat the apple and the whole damn tree
Girl, Your looking for a guy like me (like me)
(Huh huh huh)
(Mm hm)

Wuh ow, wuh ow, wuh ow, wuh ow!

Back To Front,Smiling at Strangers,2005,"Get rowdy and raucous we're on the attack
From the front to the middle to the people up the back
There ain't nothing to it i do it to see you smile
And if I forget my lyrics, fuck it I'll freestyle
I rock a beat while you get down
While the soundman's checking the sound (one check!)
This track's like pow - bang - smack
Onomatopoeic from front to back
To make a crowd react, bend and twist
Whether you getting juiced or smoking a spliff
Whether youre paid up or on the guest list
Whether or not you know it its a good time hit (know that)
Its a beauty when we're rocking the beat (come out)
Time to party stand up on your feet (my shout)
I'll meet you at the bar later for a drink
Rock the house and the bar man will give em for free
Hands up stand up feel the rhythm now
Tzu's going to drop the funk on em
Back to front, front to back, right to left
Everybody in the house crazy fresh
Front to back, back to front, right to left
Cats in the house go wo-ah
X2
Yeah, move to the skin of the drum
Get the blues out and give it some sun
Move around like thingamajings or protons and neutrons
Scribble on the page of the picture that you drew on
The backwater tinny and were throwing the hooks out
Cats on the jetty that are throwing us looks now
Flirt with the pretty girls glowing in kimonos
They like us so much they start taking photos
I met them with the who, take them with the ha
We all get together thats the sound of the groove back
Move back or step in with us
We got a few love songs and a few rippers
Ive said it once before but we are the bold diggers
So charismatic like 20 ben stillers
Were off the wall like 70s flick
With us get down with us jam with us shout with us bounce with us
Count down for the run, were are the sound givers
Put your hands up if you really want to bounce with us
Wow yeah...!
Drums!

Hey Ok,Smiling at Strangers,2005,"Damn!
I beat my fist on the table again
My convictions are the fort that I fail to defend
You just pillage and pillage, woman you won't give in
It's only so many times that I'll keep trying to swim
Well I can get funky over this here beat
Singing ""expand the format!!"" and all that
But you just treat me like a doormat, no more rockstar or nice guy
I'm just getting thrown off the horse back
I could keep it cool and pretend I'm unaffected
Emotionally stable, no flaws detected
Except I got this addiction to addiction and lust
Baby I'll obey you just say you'll make me your master
Make me your bubba, guru goodoo child and crush
Chilli vanilla, silly gorilla, I'll do what I must
Keep me informed, Im nearly appalled at my behaviour
No I won't, okay I will, oh will I won't, danger danger!
CHORUS:
Hey OK alright I know I'll do what you say x4
Yeaahhh
Hey OK alright I know I'll do what you say
Hey OK alright I know I'll do it cause you got me babe!
Everytime we fight we aggravate each other
Get loud, push back, make war, melt butter
I'ma let you know how it really is momma
It's a bonfire burning in the middle of Summer
I stick it to the drama in the B-boy stance (yup)
I'll burn up the page with a pen in my hand
But baby I've got plans to rip this hip hop mask off
Kick up, cast off the shackles of doubt
Cut the beat, i wanna kill the crap
I'm emotionally retarded I just happen to rap
This whole album is testament to that
In fact every song is like dejavu
It's my kind of music, it's my kind of blue
Alright okay okay its true alright okay okay!
I'm all ears, all yours, all fears, all flaws
All fired up feeling in the whole ninth room

In Front Of Me,Smiling at Strangers,2005,"She's sitting right in front of me
I'm caught up in a fantasy
She's taking all my mind away
And she's sitting right in front of me
It's all in your mind don't get contorted
This type o' lady bend you back and forward
Got the effect of something that you snorted
Everybody rockin to the way her body orbits
Round and round she looks so awesome
Maybe I could-
""Nah thats just your endorphins""
We gotta work together act with caution
""She'll pick you up and drop you like porcelain""
We'll go and get a coffee I just want to get to know her
I'll write her a rap
""man she'll wrap you like a boa
Look, just go home and write a lament
Go and listen to your INXS live cassette
A suicide blonde""
Well my pride is strong
""uh uh, she can make any guy reform""
She's sitting right in front of me
I'm caught up in a fantasy
Yeah, she's sitting right in front of me
I can't believe her company
She's taking all my mind away
And she's sitting right in front of me
Right there in front of me I think her name's Kylie
Real intellectual she works in a library
Damn she's sexy
""Man your Keen""
What should I say?
""I don't know , tell her you read""
I'ma tell her that I rap in the hope that she likes me
""She'll think your a freak""
Nah, she'll think I'm exciting
Chicks these days have a soft spot for hiphop
""Nah , she only likes alt country and folk rock""
I'll tell her I'm a balladeer with a career
A guitar and a car and I breathe clean air
""She'll only want you for your money""
That's funny, I'm as broke as a third world economy buddy
""It doesn't matter Mr. rapper you connect like hippies do""
What she likes the inner me?
""Yeah, she likes the inner you""
She's sitting right in front of me
I'm caught up in a fantasy
She's sitting right in front of me
I can't believe her company
She's taking all my mind away

Lounge,Smiling at Strangers,2005,"It's easy to say when it's far from my view
From the night and the day
Something never plays through
It's easy to say but it's harder to do
That all of these lies are only partially true
Let get drunk and talk for eons
Verbally re-route the course we'd be on
Never find a man but just keep on soaking up the tenants from the dark salon
I'll do this and i'll do that
We'll move over there i'll show you the stats
Take this aspect and flip on end
Sample this percussion, time stretch and bend it
Cause time lets a man ponder and consider
Conjure and configure the sums and the position
It's all bubblegum and chicken, ballzack ignition
Talk crap forever but you never really listen
Folk smoke dope but artistically invision
Folk can't cope and watch television
At the cost of how they're living in a box-like prison
Act now freaky mumma because it's all beneficient
Repeat chorus x 2
These days I'm up I'm looking for a brand new thing
It's a brand new beginning and
I get stuck head and my head trips, head held high
But it's hard in these times we are living in
I need aspirin, Nurofen, medicine
Some kind of anything to take the edge off
Kids throw your hands up high in the sky
If you've looked at the world
And you've felt a little ripped off
Cause the blind still lead the blind
With these empty words from empty minds
And it makes headlines in the 6 o'clock news
And we all know the words to the new pop tunes so
Sing a melody, remember the memory
Make more out of every dependable remedy
And (fuck that)
Talk straight not just for talk's sake
Cause I need a little honesty now for God's sake

On A Train,Smiling at Strangers,2005,"I'm a headed on a train
Don't know when I'll get back again
And I'm headed out to sea
Don't know if you're ever gonna see me
Again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again..
I'm heading on a train
Maybe I'll get on a plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Baby let me do my thing
I'm a troubadour knocking at your front door
Travelling shore to shore, sleeping on wooden floors
I get all kinds of lonely when I hit the road homie
Looking for a friendly cosy girl
Not down for matrimony
I'm not the type to tell my boys about the hokey pokey
Okie dokie body smoking sweet flesh moving slowly
I guess I'm not that blokey
Not trying to bag a trophy
I like to socialise to the sounds of Cocorosie
I feel like Ben Kenobi when I get aerobic in the boudoir
I'm too hard, make you scream hoorah
Yeah I'm in debt to it, ahaha
Got my game face on like Ali Baba
Let my tongue tantalise your garam masala
Got you climbing up the walls like Peter Parker
And if we have to let up get up get down
Take a breath in, breathe out, move around
We can pull out, pull in, pull over to the side
Accelerate the rhythm or t-take our time
All this changing round is like public housing
It's got me thinking of the title of my first album
My feet need ground and I'm about to blow!
Scrunching up my toes because time, it dun froze
It's like having 8 sneezes up in your nose
It's like a house party in your chromosomes
It's like - you don't know, oh no, I'm here now
Put that 3 point shoot for hoops free throw down
Repeat Chorus
Looking out the window new day on the intro
Sun hits my face as I exit the metro
Thinking of eggs poached sitting on french toast
A short black attack and I'm back rapping on instro
A train trip
Lounge back like a ridiculous soundtrack
You're kinky with your kangaroo pouch lass
You're beautiful
And you're co and computable
You're rockmelon strawberry and passionfruitable
And I ain't getting off of this train
Because my daydream is taking four fifths of my brain
And I really do think it auspicious again
And I'm getting away to a magical place
Platform a stop, train rattle at base
And it feels like an elephant just sat on my face
And it crushed my bones and I was flattened to paste
And in my train seat now just a vacant space

Recoil,Smiling at Strangers,2005,"First verse is a volley of words
And I'm sorry if it hurts but my anger burns
A conservative curse covers the land
I'll be a spanner in the works of your fucked up plans
Mr prime minister explain once again
Why our country is at war but we all feel ashamed
Tell me what you'd say to all the parents of the dead
Of the soldiers who have fallen or the civilians bathed in red
This ain't a just war, it's just war and business
The aggressive pursuit of financial interest
The sycophantic pandering to US foreign policy
Don't confuse this issue with our economy
Call me unpatriotic if I get this off my chest
I'm as Australian as political protest
Agitators, immigrants, misfits and underdogs
And you know what? That's the Australia I'm proud of
Being wary is good...
Australians all let us recoil
For we have no idea
We go to war for wealth and oil
Our home is girt by fear
Our land abounds in growing rifts
Dividing rich and poor
In histories page this is the age
Of fair justice ignored
(yeah)
Now the rulers they measure the indifference
Can you live with this history blistering
Like Coober Pedy opal images
Social conditions, no one will openly visit
The atrocious revisions of our forefathers decision
That cast a shadow like a desert oak but through my periscope
I can see the descendants hoping for a better sentence yo
Listen close up to the hum of the land
Wheat belt sort of thirsty for some sustenance and
The indelible scars from years of pastoralists hands
I can't understand the land marks of the man
Grandson and grandfather, a real rift between them
The generation gap is gradually receding
Leaving only but a trace of what wars where faced
And what thoughts where paced in courts and states
And what locked doors erase soft spots from lost wars
And faith is a word we don’t give enough weight
(these days) I’m on the train and I’m feeling kind of sad
(these days) I want the rain just to nourish up the land
(these days) I’m looking for a song to sing under my breath
'cuase traditional colonial jigs they don’t represent me
Australians all let us recoil
For we have no idea
We go to war for wealth and oil
Our home is girt by fear
Our land abounds in growing rifts
Dividing rich and poor
In histories page this is the age
Of fair justice ignored",https://genius.com/Tzu-recoil-lyrics
Reminisce,Smiling at Strangers,2005,"I got the letter that you wrote and it was typically distant
While I read it I retraced your footprints
Searching for signs in your words and lines but
Time has since severed ty's that bind
Maybe you only get one shot and maybe I missed it
I miss you, I wish you were here with me now
I remember my time with you, in you, all that we have been through
These memories are something I still cling to
I catch glimpses in the faces of strangers, the strange thing I face is
The same thing on all of their faces like
We're all wearing a mask
And everyone has got a someone who haunts their past
This track is just a chronicle concerning us
Co-authored in each other call it love call it trust
I'll recite it in my sleep when I dream you back to me
Whether or not your in my arms
I will always set you free
Reminiscing walking down these streets
These days we don't even speak
I think about you when I'm on my own
I think about how much I've grown
I'll kill the memory if you do to
You hold me back like I do you
Another break in this space and time
All it does is just remind me of..
Since we last spoke I think I wrote a novel
Let me sum it up, it goes babe I miss you
I could say it in a million ways
Write a million songs on a million albums
It will always come out wrong
If I told you I was drowning
Would you throw me out a rope
Even if I said don't I'd prefer to drown
Would you hold your ground
While I scrambled for mine
Would you dive in with me
Just to spend some time
You were my refuge when it rained
I would run to you for shelter
When the weather pressure built up
I would hide inside your cellar
The sunnier the days became
The more we tried to run
Till it happened that we both struck out and killed the sun
For what it's worth the world is yours
And all that's in it
If I give you space can I one day come and visit
If it's not to much to ask
Can I reserve a piece of sky in your heart
Just a part, you can set the limit
Reminiscing walking down these streets
These days we don't even speak
I think about you when I'm on my own
I think about how much I've grown
I'll kill the memory if you do to
You hold me back like I do you
Another break in this space and time
All it does is just remind me of you",https://genius.com/Tzu-reminisce-lyrics
She Gets Up,Smiling at Strangers,2005,"I know a girl whose laughter makes the whole world feel like it's brand new again
My lover and then my best friend and when
We talk on the phone she makes my heart groan
Like medicine or Thomas Eddison
She gives me lessons in how to lighten up
My baby but she's one crazy slut
And that ain't no disrespect, that's a compliment (true!)
She's angelic a smart Alec and dynamic
All havoc, making me manic a mad panic
Got me going full throttle like my name was Aristotle
I'm enamoured by the damage that she's doing causing trouble
And a damn fool's how I feel I admit it
Whatever you want sweet girl I'll go and get it
For the minute I think I've said enough
One more thing, girl I like you heaps and stuff
She gets up to rock 'n' roll
Gets down with plenty of soul
Is cool and in control
And she warms my bones when the night gets cold
Sweet song got me on my knees
My sins are all redeemed
And it feels like when I'm here with her
Sweet music baby that's the word
She's the kinda girl whose got more finesse
She ace every test and she demand respect
She's got the kinda body that was built for sex
An intellect to match and then smarter than that
She's one of a kind and when she dance she grinds
She don't wear much make up but she makes up her mind
The decisive type she'll have you in a flash
Do you like a car crash and put you out with the trash
And when she's comes well she's loud in the ears
A thousand tears because she's older than time
A big behind and no career in mind
She'll give you goosebumps, send a tingle up your spine
I find I'm in step with her when I get next to her
Blow a kiss to her, baby, you're my cold cure
I could go on you're all that and more
J'appelle mon ami, je t'adore!
She gets up to rock 'n' roll
Gets down with plenty of soul
Is cool and in control
And she warms my bones when the night gets cold
Sweet song got me on my knees
My sins are all redeemed
And it feels like when I'm here with her
Sweet music baby that's the word
She gets up!
She gets down
She gets up!
She gets down
She gets up!
She gets down
She gets up!
She gets down
We go together like stiff drinks and hangovers
We go together like accidents and blood donors
We go together like we should go together, be together, stay together from now until forever
We go together like coffee and cigarettes
We go together like dogs, cats, and vets
We go together like day going into night
Like if we did get together it would be alright
Well you disarm me and charm me too
I wanna wake up every single morning with you
I know it's weird, it's a strange idea
It's the thing with fear, we said we'd never take it serious
But look at us both happy and delirious
The pair of us, yeah it's really quite hilarious
We have a good time and make a good team
And I'm keen if you're keen if you know what I mean!

Won't Get Played,Smiling at Strangers,2005,"I got a head full of drunk and a dick full of horny
So high my behaviour's appalling
It's somewhere between three and four in the morning
And my feet and my legs are unsteady on the floor
I'ma start drawing conclusions on walls with my dinner if
I don't stop drinking now
I gotta sinking feeling I'm sinking down
In a packed club and the music's too loud
I move round just to talk more shit
With the fellas at the bar and we all laugh loud
All scared that we'll never find the love of our life
But prepared to accept some love for tonight
I got friends in relationships who don't play for kicks
Who don't deal with this
And I wish sometimes I was just like them
But till then well I'm single again
I see you standing there
Tryna play it cool
Tryna make a fool of all the boys who run around you
I'm not gonna play your games
I'm gonna do my thing
I'm gonna do nothing
Cause I won't get played like that
You got a body that could stop traffic
I think you know it by the way that you carry it
By the way I've been checking your tactics
Something about you reminds me of plastic
Lipstick packed on looking the part
Perfume on the neck and it's hitting the mark
More weaponry than you'd ever find in Iraq
A smile fixed on like a kubuki mask
There at the bar and your holding your glass
And all the men crowd around like a school of sharks
But your trapped in glass like your on display
They're the prey in this state of play
So yeah, I admit it I was checking you out
Staring at you girl trying to figure you out
But I've got my doubts let me spell them out
It's to you that I'm singing to now
I see you standing there
Tryna play it cool
Tryna make a fool of all the boys who run around you
I'm not gonna play your games
I'm gonna do my thing
I'm gonna do nothing
Cause I won't get played like that
You remind me of the pretty girls in high school
Brain like a brick but a body like a rifle
Such an eyeful of beautiful curves
But not so hot at trying to string together words
Such a pretty girl, it's such a pity girl
You're the centre of attention in your own little world
Your body's hot but your heart stays frozen
You've had boyfriends but never got to know them
The curse of the beautiful girl who knows it
And every guy in this room is a possible opponent
Yeah, I'm not going to laugh at your jokes
When they ain't that funny I ain't like other blokes
When you giggle and laugh well it's all to apparent
Your as fake as the chimes in a ballad
I won't dumb down myself just to get in your pants
I'm not Mr. smiley or Mr. wild stylee
Girl be my guest do whatever you please
Make a mess to provide your needs
I already know the script in your movie scenes
And I ain't playing that cause it just ain't me
I see you standing there
Tryna play it cool
Tryna make a fool of all the boys who run around you
I'm not gonna play your games
I'm gonna do my thing
I'm gonna do nothing
Cause I won't get played like that

And all these people take and take and take til there's nothing left
Its been that way since the early days
It still don't make much sense
Repeat chorus
When you wake up!...
Im walking to vasco, soldier on the soul pan
Bright light, huge sky
The old man desert track
So much to treasure when forever is staring me cold in the face
Lips cracked, jet black
Radiator dust-filled
3-6-0 no uphill
Its just a memory of everything going
Get up early in the morning im mourning
Rain is falling and I'm cracking apart
Like a little message that I found in the park and
Still even though the weather's gone dark
And I guess you know that I'm falling apart
Then love me love me love me cause hate is
All around me like the blackness of space is
Yeah I'm the lover with the magnitude issues
So come up close baby cause ?? i miss you
