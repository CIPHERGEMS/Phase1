Mind your own
Days fly by witnessed
But you're caught up in the minute
Mind your own business (Ayy)
Mind your own

Yeah, I'm really on that private
Flow nice, but I'm never autopilot
Niggas tryna get accustomed to my climate
Finest tarot card, I'm the highest
Flightless birds running like a virus
You can't ride with me, solo ride pirate
And my ego bigger than the Mack truck
Tryna act tough, you might have to cut the banter
And give me five feet stat, nigga, back up
Gettin' way too close with that bad luck
Diamonds are the only ones that match up
And mad ones in my crew tryna pass up
I'm in my element, less is relevant, on a regimen
To my excellence, bitch, do not disturb
Say it once, not twice or I pick up the nerve
I'ma say it one time, better do not disturb
I'ma raise my fees, drive the Benz with the skrrt
Make a nigga wanna hit it but it do not occur
Make a rude bitch mad 'cause my ice got the brr
And your friends pullin' up 'cause my M's lookin' up
Yeah, young, reckless, you can't test it
My game bigger 'cause I'm built like Tetris
New thing, got a groove like Elvis
Going too ham, yeah, don't touch my precious

I been blessed by the gods (Yeah)
Divine my spirit, I'm against all the odds
But I keep winning 'cause I pledge what I say
Yeah, I do what I say, you can leave me alone
Been a wallflower but I lead by my own
Cleared though, chakra, left my demons at home
Got a LV bag with a 40 tag
I be way too clean, you can't jack my swag
Nigga wanna hate, well, that's way too bad
Too much on my plate that I can't compromise
If you can't keep the rhythm, gotta take what you have
'Cause everybody works, I'ma take all my time
If you ain't know know, now you best know now
The one-one, mighty and the best know-how
On to the next, never do slow down
Yeah, they wanna peep, but they can't solve mine

I didn't need a present
Didn't you learn your lesson?
Why did you think that I would let you in?
No, I don't roll that way
I didn't need a present

Afterglow,TKAY,2016,"Where did everybody go?
Where did everybody go?
I'm still standing on my own
Basking in the afterglow
Where did everybody go?
Quick they come and fast they go
I'm still standing on my own
Wait too long you'll miss the outro
I'm shifting gears
I'm clearing all the angles
Told you that you should
Watch now my zone has no tangles
Now bright as the day, their talking is ample
They said I was falling off til I left
Them having like bangles
(Why they?)
Saying numbers, they never move the ball
(Why they?)
Picture places i see them hot and cold
(What they think)
Isn't real they were out when it was told
They doing chinese whispers
Telling tales to fit the mould

I'll take advantage
Land on these people
They in atlantis
They pray for magic
I just be in it
Straight edge not manic
Panic, sheep they panic
Look for light in the stables
Might have to show the diff
I'm moving up the cable
I've seen it, seen it and been frustrated -started
Focused only, attention will not be catered
Save it, save it, seeing, seeing no one
I go in
I'm super saiyan
Never Playing
They blaming
Can't contain it
If I'm rested It's looking dangerous
 x 2
Chances you can find me's
A needle right in the haystack
Too busy looking up they're coming at
Me with payback
If you're not making sense then
Come back when you have status
And keep it quiet x2

Quick they come and fast they go
Where did everybody go?

Yes, I'm a self-made disaster
But there won't be anyone after
They'll look at my name and they will see my reign
And they'll want to experience rapture
They comin' but this a new chapter
And this ain't no ark I revive than I shatter
I'm haunting these niggas
Like my name is Casper
And they'll say my name until you're calling a pastor (Huh!)
I feast on the words of the matter
If this was a race would you catch up?
They tripping and I'm going faster (Huh!)
And I be working no time to elaborate
Killing them softly and I don't exaggerate
Spitting so hard that I need to re-hydrate (Hit it)

They all can suck it like they have sore thumbs
Question my thoughts am I really alone?
Been here since day one and this is the sum
I bet when people see me they stick on like gum
Checking my list because I have in mind
Chasing beyond what is seen at this time
They over the moon but they seem to forget
The time is what matters and then getting it right
When I work and I work all these people they search for
They wrong they don't get that I'm really rehearsed
Seen all their words and it really gets cloudy
These people can't use what I've been in their sound (Huh!)
Soon, I'll be dropping my cards
And everything else that has happened so far
Because they were wrong when they said I was timed

But they wrong (laughs)

At Least I Know,TKAY,2016,"1 + 1 equals 2
All of your people can't add up the two
Trying to flex but can't tie up a shoe
Who are you to ask me where I've been?
You haven't paid attention I'm moving the cubes
Trying to stop me but not paying dues
Never be seeing what you have accused
I know better better 'cause I've seen it
Wanted to be what you wanted and now
You cannot see what is real in this cloud
Surrounded yourself with what you didn't count
Right off the radar like planes in the south
Changing the scripts, leaving you in the out
It's  nothing to you, you're better left now
Know what to lose and what you shouldn't doubt
'Cause I am still here, what is yours isn't ours anymore
Can you look at how you turned things inside out?
Flames caught fire from what we laughed about
At least I know that you weren't right for anything
At least I know that you weren't right for anything
The way that I'd seen you couldn't have changed
At least I know that you weren't right for anything
At least I know that you weren't right for anything
Round it up up, til they go down
Looser now 'cause the place sold out
Missing you but I've made more progress
Since you been a mess grinding hard
I'm in this I go, I been out
Your conditions weren't vibing loud
I get the distance all made you trip
But a listen in will make you sprout
Seeing the difference I now see what matters
Some want me to stay for their own and some scatter
Better alone and I'm dreaming the battle
Is not with some immature people who babble
I'm in a different minds state, you don't travel
Look in my head, you can see it unravel
Constantly questioning why all these people
Are stuck in a box never changing the channel
If you had your way I know you
Would've taken all of me
I couldn't handle it
If you had your way I know you
Would've taken all of me
I wouldn't handle it",https://genius.com/Tkay-maidza-at-least-i-know-lyrics

Stress and anxiety can lead to substantial barriers to sleep
So now look at your clock and tell me to increase pressure, like that sleep
Creating new habits are obviously something to be remembered
If you're having a nice night of sleep by doing them
Lastly, the best way to overcome insomnia is preparing your brain for sleep
For sleep
For sleep
For sleep

Big Things,"Last Year Was Weird, Vol. 1",2018,"Big things come and they run away
Take it as it comes, there's no time to waste
Big things come and they run away
Take it as it comes, as it comes

Big things come and they run away
Take it as it comes, there's no time to waste
Big things come and they run away
Take it as it comes, as it comes

One door opens, another closes
I wonder yeah, I wonder that's the way it goes
Remind me that there's no way I will ever lose control
Eyes for the clouds, higher than life I go
One door opens, another closes
I'm driving to the sunrise, confidently low
And no one  between the words of an open road
Eyes for the prize, I see the light

And I can almost touch the sun but
What is the price I have to pay?
And I don't need one to survive
Just like my father always said

Big things come and they run away
Take it as it comes, there's no time to waste
Big things come and they run away
Take it as it comes, as it comes, as it comes
Big things come, we don't shy away
Take it as it comes, there's no time to waste
Big things come and they run away
Take it as it comes, as it comes

Destiny never comes in late
It's on my mind, they told me time isn't on my hands
I've known what's smart since I was 9 and I see (?)
Eyes for the clouds, higher than the life I go
I'll take a minute but I won't give up
Tears is good but fear is all you know
Always fit where they say don't belong
Stirring my own wheel
I'm driving blind but it's worth fighting for

Big things come and they run away
Take it as it comes, there's no time to waste
Big things come and they run away
Take it as it comes, as it comes, as it comes
Big things come, we don't shy away
Take it as it comes, there's no time to waste
Big things come and they run away
Take it as it comes, as it comes
Big things come and they run away
Take it as it comes, there's no time to waste
Big things come and they run away
Take it as it comes, as it comes, as it comes
Big things come, we don't shy away
Take it as it comes, there's no time to waste
Big things come and they run away
Take it as it comes, as it comes

Rocking jeans from Crossroads, and reading out the Cosmos

Don’t let a hater cause a bead of sweat on your breast
Baby keep it cool it’s the first day of school
Knowing you’re a rebel and about to break the rules
The old folks scared and they want you to be too
Handling you like a toddler. What they want you to be to?
Shit handling like pride tell them no bish no
The world is for the taking take all bish all
You the game oner I say ball baby ball
You the shit no toilet paper no stall
And baby I’m the butt naked truth no drawl
Anybody this SQUEAKY get the ooh and the uh
And that’s from your brother from another mother
Make sure you stunt hard and you shine on a SUCKMOTHER

High like the Himalayas I'll keep it and they be nothing
Tryna get on this scale
But they tripping
Slipping and puffing
Killing the mic with Killer Mike
Busy, and moving moving
The circle is smaller, smaller
But focus
Made me a nuisance. Witness, witness
Got no business
I don't hinder, why you vicious?
Minutes minutes
I don’t have, you not really fitted
Then forget it
Carry on, you’ll never find me, if you get in there
You see, that I don’t care
Cause I’m too young
To be prepared

We're dreaming wild now, visions are burning up red
Keep it down, down, down, but the rhythm won't spare
We're in the castle high painting skies with our own flair

It's like we are the rolling stones and it's the battle of the ages
Our dreams are made of flesh and bones, guarding our fortress from the dangers

We're in the castle and they're trying to get into our souls
We see no limit so high so we really can't fall
Another round, round, round
Yeah we're swimming in gold
We're in our castle they're jelly
Cause they're watching us glow

It's like we are the rolling stones and it's the battle of the ages

Let me finish them 
Underground queen in the zone, it's me 
:
Let me finish them 
:
I'm the underground queen, in the zone, it's me
Fellas up ground, tryna steal my free
Saying arm up, but they're built like trees
When they see me, arm up, spreading out like fleas
Run run like a nigga seen a cop, vroom vroom
Always do the same, but be in the slum slum
Onto something new, but I will never tell them
But when I tell them will be when i sell them
Never with a fella that can not afford them
Need SL, margiela told them
Money tight like assholes, I don't condemn
Better step the game up when I roll with TM
18, got them all in a bunch
I eat him for lunch, no love, I gotta get to the punch
They been waiting out for the brunch
And they wanna munch, but I never let them dig for the scrunch
If a fake wanna be, gotta give a fake fees
Tryna live on me, but I think I don't see
Never sat with me when I sitting hungry
But they're like ""Oh remember? Haha! Funny!""
:
Let me finish them 
Underground queen in the zone, it's me 
Let me finish them 
:
They can't remember their reason for sense
Coz stalking my page more important than rent
Shit will be funny 'til they on the end of the street sinking quick so they can get a pen
:
Let me finish them, fellas with the silly hem
They're not really men, sissy when they're rea-lis-ing
Never seen real tight, 'til im in the den
And they're so tight, I bet they're getting men
Bets on them bets, when I'm in, I pay free
Hiding the residuals, coz they will pay me
I know what you relish, bet you wanna buy me
Three drinks, but I'm armed, only in for sight-sees
I might give it to them, but I'm never chillin with them
They're out here holding hands, but I'm billing villains
Always been loyal, but I'm steady fishing
Big dreams, ain't no fellas in the steady vision
Big dreams, ain't no fellas in here steady listen
Go for mini-skirts, but the brain don't listen
And when it's time to raise hands for who is killing bitches
I'm gonna be alone, coz everybody's missin

Flexin',"Last Year Was Weird, Vol. 1",2018,"I just step in, no conscience
And I do it
This is Tkay

I don't have a conscience, and I won't act responsible
When I pull up I'm flexin', you just do what you s'posed to do
I don't have a conscience, and I won't act responsible
When I pull up I'm flexin', when—when I pull up, pull up

Regular, regular
You're so regular, I am no short of spectacular
Break it up, break it up
All of the cash, stacking up fast, see me I
Set it up, set it up
Look at my bag, look at my hair
And I got multiple cellulars
One for Japan, one for your man
I do what I want with no conscience
Name on my neck and I'm ballin'
Minding my business as always
People don't get it, I'm awesome
Talking they want me to fail
I am too busy to care
Fifth gear in a car seat
With a team member behind me

I don't have a conscience, and I won't act responsible
When I pull up I'm flexin', you just do what you s'posed to do
I don't have a conscience, and I won't act responsible
When I pull up I'm flexin', when—when I pull up, pull up

DUCKWRTH
I don't have the conscience
Big boy, I do what I want
Keep that work up in the truck and drippin' sauce out the trunk
Slapping Ducky out her speakers 'til your girl turn me up
Keep them moshing to that funk, you probably think I make punk
Now baby, talk your shit, swing your fist, I'm that booty activist
Check it like I threw some gasoline and got some matches lit
I'm so hazardous to any salty, hating establishment
Now conscious this, may run off the mouth and lose my sponsorships
Take that boy at his house since you can't take the bullets to that boy's mental
Y'all full thugs, y'all goals mental
Y'all ice melted, that fire did it
Nothing but flames escape these lips
Nigga, that's only half of it
Your whole team is baby lit
Baby, I spit apocalypse

I don't have a conscience, and I won't act responsible
When I pull up I'm flexin', you just do what you s'posed to do
I don't have a conscience, and I won't act responsible
When I pull up I'm flexin', when—when I pull up, pull up

Underdog but I'm switching
I'm rebelling against it
 comfortable being different
Always be me against the world
Manifesting my vision
Making reality from the words 'cause they don't see the difference
I gotta show them to listen
I pull up and take all the options
White puffer jacket and polish
Focus, I move with no caution
Hitting these bitches with topspin
All of my patience is thin
Now I just came in to win
Step in, give 'em dirt
Next year, I'ma work
Take time, then I merk, no eye for a jerk
Been slow with no cosign, I ain't doing it for the perks
So you can miss me with the words, I don't listen to a bird
You can miss me with the words, I don't listen to a bird
(Ah, what else can I say?)

I don't have a conscience, and I won't act responsible
When I pull up I'm flexin', you just do what you s'posed to do
I don't have a conscience, and I won't act responsible
When I pull up I'm flexin', when—when I pull up, pull up",https://genius.com/Tkay-maidza-flexin-lyrics
Follow Me,TKAY,2016,"You cannot trip
You cannot falter again

If you flip all your cards on your own
Follow me

Just say yes
Everything that's undone is done

Whisper the words
Whisper the words, now
Whisper the words, words, words

Whisper the words, now
Whisper the words, words, words, words
We are just
Little particles
We are flawed
Incomplete
Put up walls
Hide our light to show
This is yours
Roll up your sleeves

And if you're running in circles
The way forward is this way
And I won't let you down
Not on my account
We'll rise up against how they tie us down
No problems unfixed so just say
I will always stay clear
Waiting for your account
Whisper the words I'll hear out
So just say

Once we start we will not fall back again

Ghost,Switch Tape - EP,2015,"If you wanna go there, give it some time
If you wanna know whether is it your life
They're heading for me, they don't know a truth from a lie
They're heading for me, they don't know a truth from a lie

Anyone who follow wanna see me going
Side by side they sit and bow
I keep it tight like a virgin show
When they see me fly one virgin ports
Tim to the country when antidote
What a shame in us, I will force it, ah
Just been a minute I'm calling shots
I only pass checks, you passing shots
Plus you pass gimme acid flux
Here to act up, no empire love
What an empire is I'm costing clouds
Could have been uprising states and clubs
5422 catch me right, in the crimson four by four I did
Time goes for you to catch me
I'm in but you won't know where that is

If you wanna go there, give it some time
If you wanna know whether is it your life
They're heading for me, they don't know a truth from a lie
They're heading for me, they don't know a truth from a lie

I don't shake cause they don't wanna show it's weak
They all do this make-believe
They don't have a decent theme
Mixed vibes when they deface me
Displace me, I'm treading on a tip daily
It's day to day basis
Criminal, they put me out don't remember faces
Got a live they hear and I hit it
Got the right to be here so I take it
Move back, I don't do that, that's a wrong lane
New cat's got a new  now I don't play
Who's that, they don't make no diff
True steps where the hoops that I'm running
Who kicks when the scandal fit, no fit
I work hard as I play no quit, no quit
Mind chop but it's in your bucks
Give time and the truth will hit

If you wanna go there, gimme some time
If you wanna know whether is it your life
They're heading for me, they don't know a truth from a lie
They're heading for me, they don't know a truth from a lie

If you won't give it, give it, give it
If you won't give it, give it time tonight
Don't say you will, don't say you will
If you won't give it, give it, give it
If you won't give it, give it time tonight
Don't say you will, don't say you will

No one to speak, you keep on playing
No one to speak, you keep on playing
No one expect you keep on playing
What is your life, you keep on playing
Don't act right on a decent day
Been on site but a decent place
No one to speak, you keep on playing
No one expect you keep on playing

So tell me what you want
They'll whisper, but they won't show too
Cause this could be the last mile come
See far but they don't where ya from
So tell me what you want

Go 'head and talk your talk
Me and my team, we just float
We sit above the flock
Built our throne with all your stones
We're planning for the fall
We're dancing on the wall
Till we rule it all

What do we have to lose?
Tangerine sunset, brown bag sippin'
What do we got to prove?
When we know...

We're made of gold
With aligning souls
Watch us glow
In screaming color
We break the mold

Electric gold

Diamond halos on our heads
And combats on our feet
Made without a silver spoon
Not richer than the kings
Roaming through the haunted grounds
So we remain unseen
Don't tell us who to be
Rebels off the leash

Hop out the furnace
Took years and it was worth it
Yeah, I been learnin'

I been out searchin'
Stay out if it ain't urgent
On top of the hill, I relax
Hot Wheels when I come swervin'

Never put a limit, I'ma get what I desire
Read the inner energy, you dealin' with some fire
All up in the entity, ain't no better remedy
Life blows, I won't let it be the enemy
A target, you can see I'm not a Kennedy
I got a grip on the scene so they friendin' me, frettin' me
Then they turn into my frenemies
A new day, another person feeling jealousy
That shit's gettin' straight old
But my worth get better like gold
Now my work great, greater than most
More bread, more heat, that's toast
Now I'm playing shows on a different coast
Grateful, waking up, I be gettin' calls
Can't touch me, Hammer MC
Can't stop that fire in me
Hundred degrees, ooh

Known to be working with fire
Fourth of July, light up the sky
Came and I did what I said I would do
Blood on my shoes, pardon my moves
I'm on the roof, bodies are piling up under the booth
Probably a hater that said I would lose
Probably an A&R hating the views
By any means, I attack
There is no leash on my back (No)
So I unleash all my wrath
Leaving their limbs unattached
Pass, pass, pass, add a little gas
Add a little more, light another match
Oh, she gonna blow, read it all in caps
Chokehold, I would never tap
I was cold, cold
Back then, they ain't ever wanna see me grow (Grow), grow (Grow)
Took a minute, I stared deep in my soul (Soul), soul (Soul)
Caterpillar, now a butterfly with the doors (Doors), doors (Doors)

Instead I'm getting a bunch of BS
Cooked up a cake and they want a pie
Sample my soul like I'm from Ikea
He buy my shit  in his ca-a-a-ar
Says that she's jealous, I ha-ha-ha
Tkay not not feeling lo-o-ove
Whatever won't kill leave a sca-a-ar

Love growing up, I hate getting older
Hate getting older, love growing up
Bigger the shoes, I ain't getting taller
Inside I feel like I've grown enough
Love growing up, I hate getting older
Hate getting older, love growing up
Bigger the shoes, I ain't getting taller
Inside I feel like I've grown enough

Moving too fast for you, moving too fast for you
(Fast for you, fast for you) wife
Puttin' my seatbelt on, as I been trynna do
(Trynna do, trynna do) right
Moving too fast for you, moving too fast for you
(Fast for you, fast for you) wife
Puttin' my seatbelt on, as I been trynna do
Right (ayy)

When you stop making excuses and start making changes
Realize others will always try taking advantage and not every wound has a bandage
Hijack the will like a bandit, Tkay don't leave it abandoned
In this day and age, no DNA interaction, 'cause internet's making a savage
Owned up the (?), call the distractions
Tick off the duty and put things in action
Don't do no judging, I ain't no Judy
I put a show on like Mila and Ashton
70's, lovin' nothing
Growing up, I'm still a youngin'
Hair so long like I'm a lion
I am learning secrets like I am Ryan

Love growing up, I hate getting older
Hate getting older, love growing up

Inside I feel like I've grown enough
Love growing up, I hate getting older
Hate getting older, love growing up

Moving too fast for you, moving too fast for you
(Fast for you, fast for you) wife
Puttin' my seatbelt on, as I been trynna do
(Trynna do, trynna do) right
Moving too fast for you, moving too fast for you
(Fast for you, fast for you) wife
Puttin' my seatbelt on, as I been trynna do
(Trynna do, trynna do) right

When I get older, put all the memories back in the folder
And fold it all up to the point I be loaded
Forget who was holding me back
(Forget who was holding me back)
That didn't work, I was focussed
Painting a portrait before tape recording
Tkay was bound to expose it
Show 'em no mercy, they noticed (mercy)
Always had manners, managers, lawyers
I don't get careless
All grown, I'll swim in a tank full of sharks
So these toxic (?) raising awareness
Life full of lessons, like Chopra
Rollin' in deep with the pack like I'm Noah
Had caramel but I'm cocoa (cocoa)
If he don't know, now you know her

Love growing up, I hate getting older
Hate getting older, love growing up
Bigger the shoes, I ain't getting taller
Inside I feel like I've grown enough
Love growing up, I hate getting older

House of Cards,TKAY,2016,"Curb, we sit and play out
How the day ends, I don't know
Treasures in the playground
Hidden in the dice that we roll
Dreaming all the ways that
We could tear this town apart
We just sit and faze out
Me and my counterpart

Small talk's in remission
Block my ears, don't listen
Deep thoughts are my mission
Small talk's in remission
Block my ears, don't listen
Deep thoughts are my mission

The lessons we learn, they don't come for free
False starts building big hearts
The lessons we learn, they don't come for free
But we'll be ace in the house of cards
The lessons we learn, they don't come for free
False starts building big hearts
The lessons we learn, they won't come for free
But we'll be ace in the house of cards

Looking for a favour
They don't come that easily
Habitual behaviour
We go play hide and seek
But I got these primal pleasures
Constantly filling my cup
With feels you couldn't measure
So you can go and keep your good luck

Small talk's in remission
Block my ears, don't listen
Deep thoughts are my mission
Small talk's in remission
Block my ears, don't listen
Deep thoughts are my mission

The lessons we learn, they don't come for free
False starts building big hearts
The lessons we learn, they don't come for free
But we'll be ace in the house of cards
The lessons we learn, they don't come for free
False starts building big hearts
The lessons we learn, they won't come for free
But we'll be ace in the house of cards

Envy, what they shower in they try to get me
Don't have base in your resource
And no remorse than us are capable
Got me lots of hair, call me rapunzel
Don't be holding on
I'm running my own race during
The week until the siren's gone
Spend them in the hours seeing blossom, bring us flowers
Life's so easy, they want easy, they've got easy
Never learn at all
Now they coming back there isn't time
They need what I got but it's a secret
Common sense it doesn't come along
This lesson's proved and now will have a meaning

Small talk's in remission
Block my ears, don't listen
Deep thoughts are my mission
Small talk's in remission
Block my ears, don't listen
Deep thoughts are my mission

The lessons we learn, they don't come for free
False starts building big hearts
The lessons we learn, they don't come for free
But we'll be ace in the house of cards

False starts building big hearts

M.O.B.,Switch Tape - EP,2015,"And you I will find
Even if I waste the rest of me
And you will be mine
Until the end, what's new? It's you I seek
But would you wait for me?
I can really make it feel like we
Are diamonds cause you are one
And you'll find if I do waste all of me
Money Over B...Bitches

So you think you're shining watch me in my zone
Owning these fellas when I get to blow
Invest in these things that'll cost me large pennies
Cause I know what I want will give me much more
They think they're shining they're telling me no
They think they're shining I'm telling them so
I used to believe but until they let me down
They're right in the path that I know I won't go (Money Over B...Bitches)
All for the change
People grow up but I'm all forward lane
Getting ahead on that soul food I mean
Getting ahead on that cash I remain up
Stepping on ants cause they small and they follow
I will find mine never mind them they shallow
Don't even up with them I get on the narrow
Don't fit on this one cause I live on that callow (b-bitches)

And you I will find
Even if I waste the rest of me
And you will be mine
Until the end, what's new? It's you I seek
But would you wait for me?
I can really make it feel like we
Are diamonds cause you are one
And you'll find if I do waste all of me
Money Over B...Bitches

So I never do whack
I never do slack
Never be whining I'm shining I dine in
I never look back
Bet they all do that
Timing the day that I reach what I'm climbing
This song's about cash
But I'm not 'bout the money
I do it cause I don't feel like feeling funny
Without all these things I think I would be nothing
Like A-B type rap except there is no rhyming
Get it?
I'm all for the get it
I don't share get it? Get it?
I work and I sweat it
Don't do them fads or hallucinate get it?
I keep it up even if I'm not that ready
Don't even up with them I'm quick on that steady
I do it myself and they do with a teddy
I could bring them up but I'm right there already

And you I will find
Even if I waste the rest of me
And you will be mine
Until the end, what's new? It's you I seek
But would you wait for me?
(Diamonds cause you are one)
But would you wait for me?
(Are one)
But would you wait for me?
(Diamonds cause you are one)
But would you wait for me?

I'm all for the get it (Hey)
I don't share get it? Get it?
I work and I sweat it
Don't do them fads or hallucinate get it?
I'm all for the get it (Hey)
I don't share get it? Get it?

So monochrome, monotone, ride or die, live alone
Monochrome, monotone, ride or die, live alone
So monochrome, monotone, ride or die, live alone

Tell 'em, sit and listen
I'm never sitting with them
They get mad and watch me glisten
Like what these people give 'em?
They livin' on hope but they can't even cope with inner dopeness
Rap tracks and I leave 'em hopeless
Cut 'em up like guillotines and leave 'em soulless
Got a couple thousand, ask me if I wrote this
Like them lost kitties with no pennies, they can blow this
Alright
Tell 'em where I get this offsight
Spitting on this world and it be setting on fire
I do it 'cause I never wanna line up up
For a dumb-dumb, inner slum job for hire
I haven't even warmed up, there's sweaters
No one can tell me where this even get us
These residents already getting jealous
'Cause they're noticing I'm only getting better
Seen the forecast and now I'm ready for the weather
I be, independent, I be doing it free, I do it for me
I get it from my parents GE-netics
Tell 'em come if they be willing to be
On level with me
The winner you'll be seeing is me
Cause they monochrome monotone, ride or die, live alone
So monochrome, monotone, ride or die, live alone

Fuck the dick, where the pennies though?
Sweating, I let him lick all on me
But don't love him though... ew
Fuck the rich, where the grinders though?
All about the looks, ass, titties, ass, cars and their money, clothes
Fuck a diss, let's be friends though
Niggas gotta dream but they only seen in the same stream
When you're on it they be hiding though
When it comes real clean you'll know I'll be all in the other zone

The winner you'll be seeing is me
(Why?)
'Cause they fuckboys with casualty
And casually I'm on poise
But why should you be?
And who you be?
Ya fellas ain't got enough crew to be
Sailing the sea
But they're saline I see
'Cause I'm getting the bread for my table wee wee
These people think they are legit
I ransack and I have to tag these
Frauds since we're going back
I could really give one but I'm holding back

Then I have a meaning

You want to give light?
Nothing ever changes
They stay slime
They'll never own up
Too strong or just too weak
They don't show loss just chic
They don't want us forward

Compare you can but won't attain
Duplicate to praise my reign

I shoot 'em like (Hey, hey, ha, ha)
And I don't care (Uh huh, uh huh)
And they be like

Stop lyin', never 'bout all this flavor
But I know you savor
Cause you tell your friends you're a hater
But thanks because you do all the labor
I don't need a waiver
Cause you'll be spreading out all my paper
You at the front?
Oh no, you side, you my neighbor
I can see your laser
Cause you think you be right on my radar
So don't be near if you be low on the paper
You can save it for later
Cause we don't tolerate broke behavior

And they be like

They're proper dumb
Always sit flat like a papadum
I always sit and I blow bubble gum
Their common sense bangin' like a bongo drum
Zucchinis
So weenie
Always waiting for a greeting
I might be fit for a genie
I grant their wish for no meaning
Don't think you are achieving
My trust can be so deceiving
Might think that you are off meaning
It's like I'm kinda be leading a miss 
Blow kiss, double mean; stand or a piss
Double up, double up, down for the bliss?
And they always cover up their fouls in mist 
And I always cover up my twos exist

White Rose,"Last Year Was Weird, Vol. 1",2018,"Eyes open, eyes open
Watch as the sun goes in
You're just a white rose when
The sun is out
Mind open, mind open
You wear me out, frozen
Where was my white rose when
The light went down?

Is this really how it's meant to be?
Bittersweet, we only disagree
And I can't remember the last time I felt
Safe enough to tell you how I feel
Time and time, my body I was (?)
High on everything you give to me
It's funny how we hold onto the memories when we don't wanna taste the bitter taste, oh

Eyes open, eyes open
I watch as the sun goes in
You're just a white rose when
The sun is out
Mind open, mind open
You wear me out, frozen
Where was my white rose when
The light went down?

Maybe I should have said nothing
It takes time to open up
Plus you hate when I talk
Maybe I should've left my sins
Recovered and given up
Saturdays with you I couldn't get enough
Maybe you could've let me in
We're adolescent, growing up
So we're growing apart
(?) my roots grow in, glowin'
You're showing you're length and growing weeds
Tried to peach the peace but then I lost a piece of me
Shoot, then give a dog a bone if he don't wanna eat
Always matching denim with the 90's vintage tee
Look at how we feel, we're missing symmetry
I could spell it for you, but you wouldn't get the link-up
I'm bad and boujee, you and me are not amigos
You wanna dance but you be asking where the key goes
Watch me while I keep those

Eyes open, eyes open
I watch as the sun goes in
You're just a white rose when
The sun is out
Mind open, mind open
You wear me out, frozen
Cause where was my white rose when
The light went down?

Eyes open, eyes open
I don't usually give a, but I'm
Lost for words
We fought sharing moments and the
Trust was hurt
Did you think I'd be waiting for you with my heart open?
I carry safe with it, I'm broken
You and me don't talk when
Me and you are far
I wanted a white rose when
You wanted me for lust
If we both want what we can't have
Then this only ends up as bad for us
For you, for me
Ooh, yeah...

Eyes open, eyes open
I watch as the sun goes in
You're just a white rose
When the sun is out
Mind open, mind open
You wear me out, frozen
Where was my white rose
When the light went down?

You and me don't talk when
Me and you are far
I wanted a white rose when
You wanted me for lust
If we both want what we can't have
Then this only ends up as bad for us
For you, for me
Ooh, yeah...",https://genius.com/Tkay-maidza-white-rose-lyrics
You Sad,"Last Year Was Weird, Vol. 2",2020,"You so sad
(Haha)

Don't pull up to tell me how you feel
'Cause it won't end up going your way
I've been fooled once, but I won't be fooled again
My zod' told me we don't match today
So I've been duckin', you're buggin'
Like Frank, catch me if you can (Catch me if you can)
Quite frankly, I think that you'll thank me
For this when you understand (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

So tough in your daydreams
Please don't overdose on
Colors in your brain
But here we are again (Yeah)

Three AM, you alone right now
I can't come to the phone right now
You sad (You sad)
I know your ways, you sad (Haha, so sad)
Small hand tryna play a big boy game
Don't say much but I know your face
You sad (So sad)
Yeah, yeah, you sad (So sad)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know you called, I saw, ignored
For the forty-fourth time, aren't you overdue on your bill?
We can't dwell on our old ways, uh-uh (No)
But you're holding on, you're holding on, it's overdone (Overdone)
Sober up, yeah, I see the bullets you sweat
We can't dwell on, we can't go on

So tough in your daydreams
Please don't overdose on
Colors in your brain
But here we are again (Yeah)

Three AM, you alone right now
I can't come to the phone right now

You Want,TKAY,2016,"Time does fly like I will they won't
I see you're tired act like I don't know
They kiss make ties with an X + O
When I see your lies grieving made me know
Who's your tie in if you're decent we'd know
Climb in if you need but we need don't
Ask and you show up like we need an equal
If your ass up you've used your chance
I don't give two, just one at best
Can't buy one and get one free
Like hydrant all the pressure's kept
Then someone comes to relieve
King of cards no heart invested
So hard just to believe
You had a vision I could be your guest
It didn't fit like your mum's jeans
Wish you weren't this way
You wish we were the same
I give you what you take from me
In return you wait for change
Who are you for that? x 5
Are you going to stay outside?
You want, you want
Everything that I have
And you don't
Wishes you cannot buy
You've got, you've got
All the things
But they are not what you want
Who are you for that? x 5
Used to care of them thoughts but I'm out
Fucking the wrist I'm like what you saying
No filter gram keep of and I'm up
Yeah and they act up when you give no grain
You want deep thoughts think for not about
Introspect lost now I'm in this game
Used to seek hope before on a cloud
Now I'm on rise like a Tuesday
Block your thoughts that i want to help
Started to see there is nobody else
The world is so lonely if i find a step
Keeping it closed 'cause I care for my health
Don't seek approval in those who weren't there
Who are you to think you can have a say?
You call in, hide when I'm in and
Got Robin Williams here when I'm afraid",https://genius.com/Tkay-maidza-you-want-lyrics

I be on the next, I see it I don't stop
I be on the next, I see it I don't stop

I be on the next, I see it I don't stop

[Verse 1]
They dont see the colors
But Im tight like a redbone
And my jeans is full
Like an ass in some pants yo
Stuff I didn't do, I put the pressure in the clutch
Point it at a target then I execute with touch
And I dance on chicken looking glances
People from the west to the south and I lead it

Bom bom
Womp womp ba dom bom
I be on the next, I see it, excel with no sweat

Put it on the pedestal
They blink and they dont get
Some of them catch it
No messiah got the place lit
Leopard teeth I'm dangerous
In motion and they regret it
What you are not
You're not gonna want the place lit
And your time is done when I'm out
And the floor hits
Sittin' by the fire
Smelling victory from focus
Cold like the winter
Heart is warmer than the potent
Anyone who stops me
And they becoming potion

[Chorus]
Bom bom ba dom bom
Bom bom

Womp womp ba dom bom
I be on the next, I see it I don't stop

[Verse 2]
Guess who's back dippin' back
But you no fear
I could be the better better
Be the brains in there
Can we pass a dinosaur
I made it in my house
Made it something lit
In the Biz I'm a gift
What they couldn't get
Smaller than a silhouette
See the conversational
The topic in the middlest
Probably why they been and done
And give support
I didn't hit
Made it through the jungle
With some animals that didn't fit

[Chorus]
Oh oh bom bom ba dom bom
Bom bom
Bom bom ba dom bom

Oh oh bom bom ba dom bom

[Verse 3]
Spirit is so kindred
Mogul and exhibition
Kill or be claimed of the single soul ambition
Lotion bottle limitless
Stuffed so green with henna shit
See my time
Ignoring all the stimulus
I be on some other shit
Writing on the covers bitch
The won't see it coming
Far too late
Focus on the mis'
Front upon you now
Music in you now
Made it from the base
No stopping 'til the top

[Bridge]
Try to tell me stop
They all lie
Try to tell me stop
They all lie
Try to tell me stop
They all lie
Try to tell me stop
I be on the next, I see it I don't stop
I be on the next, I see it I don't stop
I be on the next, I see it I don't stop
