One Time,,2019,"Ride for me
Ride for me baby one time
Tell me would you ride for me baby, one time
Would you hold it down for me baby, one time
Would you hold it down for me

Girl I got a thing for ya
And you know it, know it
Lemme keep it real with ya
Keep it real, how you feel
Lets get lost tonight
Take a trip
One hundred on the highway I'm
Moving like its ride or die
Nobody but you and I on our own shit
Versace on your jeans, yeah I notice
Hanging with them girls on the weekend
Working on yourself, still in college
Girl I love how you do thangs
Girl I love how you do thangs
Show me love in a new way
Yeah we're cruising in the nighttime, tell me do you feel a way

Ride for me baby, one time
Tell me would you ride for me baby, one time
Pull up in the night for me baby, one time
Tell me would you ride for me baby, one time
Ride for me baby, one time
Tell me would you ride for me baby, one time
Pull up in the night for me baby, one time
Tell me would you ride for me baby, one time

I no go lie gimme reason
You give me something to believe in
I swear to God you are heaven sent
I fell in love with you melanin
Give me love every season
I know you like to lay low
I know some place we can go
If you want we can ride slow

Girl I got a thing for ya
And you know it, know it
Lemme keep it real with ya
Keep it real, how you feel
Lets get lost tonight
Take a trip
One hundred on the highway I'm
Moving like its ride or die
Nobody but you and I

Ride for me baby, one time
Tell me would you ride for me baby, one time
Pull up in the night for me baby, one time
Tell me would you ride for me baby, one time
Ride for me baby, one time
Tell me would you ride for me baby, one time
Pull up in the night for me baby, one time
Tell me would you ride for me baby, one time

I no go lie gimme reason
You give me something to believe in
I swear to God you are heaven sent
I fell in love with you melanin uhuh
Give me love, give me reason
I know you like to lay low
I know some place we can go
If you want we can ride slow

Ride for me baby, one time
Tell me would you ride for me baby, one time
Pull up in the night for me baby, one time
Tell me would you ride for me baby, one time
Ride for me baby, one time
Tell me would you ride for me baby, one time
Pull up in the night for me baby, one time
Tell me would you ride for me baby, one time",https://genius.com/Adrian-dzvuke-one-time-lyrics
