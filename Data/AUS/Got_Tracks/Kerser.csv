4 The Fans,S.C.O.T.,2013,"I can save your life; shit won’t even take no time
Walked through hell to get here, now I’m meant to fucking make it rhyme
I had the ground pulled from under me so come with me
Said I was the sickest, somehow still I kept humble, geez!
I seen what you seen, maybe seen a little more
I been there hungry, empty stomach, living fucking poor
I’ve seen them fights on the street, domestic shit too
One stage was crazy the whole hood was dacking shivs, truth
I've seen them guns drawn for fun, add a DS
That's fun chasing funds, they was street fresh
Now they in a cell, I watched it fall apart
Talk to Sero's mum, it hurts to hear her when she pours her heart
Plus my own mum, she ain't wanna hear my shit
She's best to block it out if I was her I'd break to bits
What to do? I'm just trying to save my fans now
So it's fuck the world, drinking liquor with my pants down

This for you, now you, you the fans now
This for all the fans who feeling like they need a new route
You can do it if I did it, find a better place
You can turn your future, wiping out your yesterdays
This for her, this for him, this for your life
I'm paying back my fans, so I'm a gonna give 'em more rhymes
No matter what they say...fuck impossible
Make it possible, remove the IM, that's the obstacle

When I heard nightmare I didn't sleep for nights; swear
Me and Rates the same so put us in a psych, yeah
Is that the answer? Is it? Lock down the whole crew?
Half in prison, half in rehab, half in doll ques
I guess I fluked it then, why I sitting at the top?
You decide, 'cause these cunts won't ever bring me props
Jealousy will probably overrule the whole world
I'm with my fans, we just chilling in our own world
I've got my crew too, the ones that made it through the struggle
Mind you, those who didn't make it, I'm still here just know I love you
I should be idolised, I'm proof that the gutter grows
If you do it properly, turn that gutter to a fucking rose
I don't fucking know, I'm eating Xanny tabs
'Cause anxiety has got me feeling like I have attacks
But you don't care for me, I know where to play my part
I won't get lost, I've did it, proven that I'm way too smart

This for you, now you, you the fans now
This for all the fans who feeling like they need a new route
You can do it if I did it, find a better place
You can turn your future, wiping out your yesterdays
This for her, this for him, this for your life
I'm paying back my fans, so I'm a gonna give 'em more rhymes
No matter what they say...fuck impossible
Make it possible, remove the IM, that's the obstacle

And I still spin out. Is this a dream or something?
Nebs my brother and I thank him 'cause he's seen something
When they was doubting me, Nebs was like fuck that
He's like ""
We got this, man. I see we gonna run rap
""
And look what fucking happened. I thank you mad fam
I thank Sarm for giving patience, shout outs to That's Them
And my best mate Boobz I owe my life to
If I never met him never would have picked up mics,
 phew!
That was high school, and they were high still
He said I'm the best in Oz, and he's right still
Shouts to Rates one; fuck, he knew this day would come
And his day is coming from the streets I guess we fucking won
Shouts to Jay Dee, he on top of shit
His music hitting hard, I can't see 'em stopping him
Oh yeah, and April forget them broke days
I told you that I love you, plus I made 'em go away

This for you, now you, you the fans now
This for all the fans who feeling like they need a new route
You can do it if I did it, find a better place
You can turn your future, wiping out your yesterdays
This for her, this for him, this for your life
I'm paying back my fans, so I'm a gonna give 'em more rhymes
No matter what they say...fuck impossible

9 Outta 9,S.C.O.T.,2013,"My raps is a note, that's a hundred letters
Grew up way different so the cunts won’t get it
While you was at school, you was trying to pass lots
Rates was showing me how to weigh up a half oz
My first choof, I was twelve years old
Felt hooked since then, guess the world is cold
Tip of the iceberg, tip of the iceberg
Will be when the ice burns thinking back, I turned
Sixteen when I lit the pipe
With Boobz at a bus stop 'round Christmas night
Back then, shit you see the crystal move
Uneducated like it was the shit to do
I turned into a rap star, proved them wrong
I ain't need another pipe, give me the doob or bong
I'ma move along call me the business man
'Cause I’m busy, no rest, that's a business plan

Move on, I’m the shinin' bit
Rhymin' sick, time tick, you can ride the dick
Ripe tits, nice hips and she grindin' it
Nine hits out of nine when my lines are spit
Move on, I’m the shinin' bit
Rhymin' sick, time tick, you can ride the dick
Ripe tits, nice hips and she grindin' it
Nine hits out of nine when my lines are spit

Break down on the shit I say
I got a different fuckin' pipe for every single day
We won’t say what we don’t need, nah
Eyes half closed, you can blame the codeine, brah
Back on my king shit, rap like a king, shit
Wonder why they call me king, you hearin' what a king is
Big boss hustle, hustle the music
And just like a dealer, my customers abuse it
Word play with a metaphor
I still root rap, that's what I met it for
Kiss the ring bitch, it's the hand of a boss
Beef shit these days, shit, I dare 'em to cross
Need it to sell, I'm the one you still come after
You oh so making money 'cause I'm numb with a gun
On a hoodie that was worn by the Kerser one
If Kerser didn't rock the hood, he probably would've sold none
It's all up

Move on, I’m the shinin' bit
Rhymin' sick, time tick, you can ride the dick
Ripe tits, nice hips and she grindin' it
Nine hits out of nine when my lines are spit
Move on, I’m the shinin' bit
Rhymin' sick, time tick, you can ride the dick
Ripe tits, nice hips and she grindin' it
Nine hits out of nine when my lines are spit

Hot car without the number plates
On the run for another fuckin' hundred days
My raps in your brain, pull your back out your frame
Now you're gaspin' in pain, I'm attackin' the game
This rap shit here in Oz is mine
If you want beef, sweet but not with rhymes
Let's handle it the street way, send your boys
Come back beat up, you a pretender boy
Let me tell you what's dangerous and fun
Rates with a gun
Mind set dangerous when I write like this
The flows switchin' up like the lights on pigs
Hear me rip this shit, you should see me live
Your set's so dirty, got to clean my eyes
Fresh shit yeah, you know where to find it
Head to the stores, find Kers and buy it

Move on, I’m the shinin' bit
Rhymin' sick, time tick, you can ride the dick
Ripe tits, nice hips and she grindin' it
Nine hits out of nine when my lines are spit
Move on, I’m the shinin' bit
Rhymin' sick, time tick, you can ride the dick

Airplay,Engraved In The Game,2017,"ABK Records, everybody wanna sign a deal
To impress me, you gotta rack a line of pills
You gotta have some big tits, wearin' nine-inch heels
And show us how the pussy work, fuck your rhyming skills
I’m walking in to Centrelink like ""remember me?""
I’m rich now, I got a house you can rent for free
I’m only here from when you cut my fuckin' payments
Back in two-thousand-and-eight and I ain’t say shit
Well this my payback, petrol on the front desk
Lit it up, thank you all, then I fuckin' left
They see my getaway, I think it was an Audi
It could’ve been a Range Rover, I don’t know he’s out here
What kind of car was it? Man this shit is marvelous
I just popped like fifty pills and I was meant to halve the shit
Fuck your bitch with a satty full of x pills
Now slit the bag so she trippin', I’m a mess still

Bitches get your tits out, put your fuckin' hands up
All my real song just time for us to stand up
I made this for the radio, I hope I get the airplay
Cunt, clitoris, fuck, I wasn’t meant to swear mate
Bitches get your tits out, put your fuckin' hands up
All my real song just time for us to stand up
I made this for the radio, I hope I get the airplay
Cunt, clitoris, fuck, I wasn’t meant to swear mate

So I was down the beach right, sittin’ on my beach towel
I heard a bitch scream, it sounded like a big ""ah""
I though ""hmm, Kerser to the rescue?""
I let the bitch drown, I had to use the restroom
No wonder parents ain’t let the kids listen up
Hey kids, sniff glue and you can say ""cunt""
Don’t listen to the teachers, don’t even stay in school
But if we talkin’ 'bout my daughter, we got different rules
She a princess and I have double standards
Okay my aim's done, I pissed off all the parents
What about the other night, I was eatin' mushrooms
I tripped the fuck out and hit my missus with a dust broom
Mamma, God, I’m sorry babe, I don’t know what was happening
I know I promised you, I wouldn’t say it in a rap again
But I did as I wheelie on a push bike
I don’t even know these rappers' names or what they look like

Bitches get your tits out, put your fuckin' hands up
All my real song just time for us to stand up
I made this for the radio, I hope I get the airplay
Cunt, clitoris, fuck, I wasn’t meant to swear mate
Bitches get your tits out, put your fuckin' hands up
All my real song just time for us to stand up
I made this for the radio, I hope I get the airplay
Cunt, clitoris, fuck, I wasn’t meant to swear mate

This the part where I’m gettin’ on my sad stuff
And have a sook like ""my life isn’t adding up""
Here’s a tablet bruh, look into the camera
Now take a photo, you’re lookin’ like an amateur
Shut the fuck up, my rappin’ like a nail bomb
I'ma drop it all off at a nail salon
Bitches runnin’ now, you could say I nailed ‘em
And I wonder why the public keep hatin’ man

Bitches get your tits out, put your fuckin' hands up
All my real song just time for us to stand up
I made this for the radio, I hope I get the airplay
Cunt, clitoris, fuck, I wasn’t meant to swear mate
Bitches get your tits out, put your fuckin' hands up
All my real song just time for us to stand up
I made this for the radio, I hope I get the airplay

All i see,,2015,"Can you feel my pain?
Ohhh
I'll be on my way

Fuck just happened there?
Did i cross the line?
Thought i had it worked out
Till i lost my mind
And i'm just standing in the middle of the traffic
With my finger in the air
Cause i see the world is classic and
All this shit is havoc
Everyone causing commotion
And they point the finger at me
Tryna say that i'm promoting all the wrong shit why?
I'm honest i won't lie
My mind is scrambled eggs
I was looking for a high man
Should be happy when i'm chasing my dream
If i forget to take my tablets then i'm making a scene
You ever felt so fucked up
That you nearly chucked
Everything inside wanna die
Like your luck's up
What the fuck's up
Need another new day
Hold my shit together
But i wonder if it's too late
Plus i just got a call from my doctor
She said the progress comin' to a stop fuck

Underneath a sky so grey
And all i see is pain and hate
Look in my face
Tell me that it's all okay
The sun is gonna shine
It's a brand new day
Talking like you on my page
Tell me do you feel my pain?
But still i Pray
Everything will be okay
The sun is gonna shine
I'll be on my way

This my last drop of purple
Spinning in a circle
Just for the fuck of it
Xannies with the Serical 
Blaze a joint
Now i think i'm on the right path
Light that up
Instant change in my eyes Brah
5 star to 5 star
Flight after flight I
Never stop with rap
Till i die or retire
I'm higher and higher
But low at the same time
I can't explain it
You would have to be in the brain of mine
To understand the upper hand
I've never ever fuckin' ran
From any problems
Gotta stand
And face 'em like a fucking man
And able sense
Got you falling asleep
At the wheel, Jesus Christ
Is this the warning for me
I didn't take it if it was
And now i'm fucking famous
All eyes on me
So it makes it more dangerous
I'ma mess I'ma wreck
But the rap shit
I run that
I need a bit of space
Ain't ever had to come back


Rappers won't admit
I'ma major role and inspiration
Instead they type on keyboards
And start with all the hatin'
No debating, I'm slaying these tracks
Till i'm laid on my back
Or i'm sprayed with a Gat
You can't say it like that
You can't stay with my raps
Till the day i collapse
Fans know i got their back's
ABK 225
They my bro's man
14 Smoking weed through a coke can
Now i'm on a program
Don't it all make sense?
If you a hater
I can change your mind in 8 seconds
Fuck you if you didn't get
Scrap that, you're not a fan
You fucking idiot
You hating on me
And i'll bring you to the pit of it
Take you to the industry
And make you smell the shit of it
Where my brain at?
Did the fame effect it?
It's the Kers
On my way to the death bitch",https://genius.com/Kerser-all-i-see-lyrics
Always Been Here For You,Next Step,2015,"(Been here for you
Listen to your heart)

In a space of my own I spent days on the phone
Trying to make this shit happen, felt dazed and alone
Always blazing the cone, still king of this Oz rap
Next decade, tell ‘em chill, cos I got that
Quarter past four wine glass with some high notch
Bottles worth, more than what Sonya Mann’s fly watch
Someone questioned me the other day
They asked me was it worth it with all of the fuckin fame?
I had to think about it, still I don’t know
But if I didn’t rap I’d still be that one broke
But the fuckin fame, oh, man, the fuckin fame
Enough to make me want to hide and never make return to game
But it’s a life that I asked for, what to say
That wanna do shit and I just smashed the ottlebay
Thinking fuck rap, I’d rather live normal
Than that fucking cash sending me immortal
[Hook: Emmy Mack & 
Kerser
]
Listen to your heart, when it’s tough we’ll get through
Listen to your heart, I’ve always been here for you
You know that I’m here, know that I’m there, I be there for you
Without a doubt, that’s my promise and I swear
Listen to your heart…

I watch rappers come and I watch rappers go
But they all crawling back cos they realise it’s my show
And the label that we running, they be chasing for that dotted line
But you gotta be special if you thinking Scott'll sign
I’m writing this, penthouse on the balcony
Put myself in your shoes, I’m thinking how can he
Rise up, run shit like a true bosh
Shooters in my crew, so I’m set if they do cross
Pray every day, so I ain’t see my world messed
Holding shit down, but I stress when my girl’s stressed
All my crew stressed and we gotta move yes
Take our competition, we don’t beef on no computers
We keep it real, if you see me in the new whip
It means I got another park next to my other two
Nothing rented straight invested, I’m the smart one
Cash for life, got it pumping through my heart
[Hook: Emmy Mack & 
Kerser
]
Listen to your heart, when it’s tough we’ll get through
Listen to your heart, I’ve always been here for you
You know that I’m here, know that I’m there, I be there for you
Without a doubt, that’s my promise and I swear
Listen to your heart, (
got it pumping my heart
)

Man, this all spins me out, how I make it out C-Town
They call me king and get the crown
Got these haters facing down
And I’m howdy, pacing round, fuckin stage to stage
Doing show to show, switching flow to flow
And oh you know, I top charts without radio
And that include ARIA’s, don’t you say it so?
DVD’s, CD’s, number one
And when this drops, guaranteed number one
Have to brag, put these haters in their place
Rub it in a doubter’s face like I told you mate, I’m great
And what’s the Kers to do, oh god, it’s hurting you
I’ve got tricks up my sleeve, I could burst with news
Element of surprise, see your eyes and you cry
Cos you watched me from the fucking start and knew I had the drive
And that’s shit you need (shit you need)

Kerser

Listen to your heart, when it’s tough we’ll get through

Attitude been stuck,,2016,"I'm not scared of your stolen power
See right through you any hour
You'll be taking it slow
Feeding my flame
Shuffling the cards of your game
And just in time
In the right place
Suddenly I will play my ace

A fucking mess man 
I wanna see your head slam
I threaten with weapons
They say they hold my blessing
In a shitty rap scene, fucking rappers do my head in
Think they on my level but they Facebook on a webcam
I wear my gold wherever, you might catch me in an ally
If you say you gonna get me, god have mercy on your balley
Ri-ridiculous, so sick of this, predicted it that I ripped the shit
The critics hit, try rip to bits the difference is that I live for this
They criticize how I live my life but I come from the bottom
Got rich, you cried
Why oh why did I hate so much deny and deny now they ain't my stuff
I'll take you to my old style that'll leave you in a hole stole
You realized that the whole world these rappers took my whole style
Never been mad just move along, I made it clear that I'm moving on
Till I die make abusive songs, my main victory I proved em' wrong
Just go hard till album 10
Blame xanex or the valium
Cause at the top it's kinda strange
ABK till my dying day


I chase the dreams and I make sure that they all come true
That's why they hate cause they can't make theirs real
Yeah they got 1 too
Fuckin' skitzin lately attitude been stuck on fuck you
If you think that's gonna change, you fucking sucked the nuts too
Blacklisted from Triple J, they didn't think I'd get by
But I topped like every chart, my names now in the headlines
What you think about Kers or Scott? Fuck school too
I was burning pot, bad advise fucking turn me off
Here's some more never work a job
What you take me for a piece of shit?
Till I saved your kid he was feening this
I helped when harm, I'll leave a twist
My last enemy had bleeding lips
That stopped the talking, why you stalking?
Kerser round you see me balling
My boys strapped with itchy fingers
Talking stops when it hits your winders
Fucken crazy ain't it, don't care if you rate it, hate it
Since I came into the game, the most hated is what I stay with
No one ever cop the hate first like the Kers man
And fuckin' spin out, half you haters turn to Kerser fans, facts",https://genius.com/Kerser-attitude-been-stuck-lyrics
Bad Habits,Tradition,2016,"I don't know how deep to go
But I'ma let it all out so come peep the show
Got my first Xanny of my mate, I ain't gonna say his name
It was fun at the start, I used to treat it like a game
This around the time when 
The Nebulizer
 dropped
I was on all types of shit, but there’s one I couldn’t stop
And it played with my brain, but I focused on the music
I focused so much, didn't realize I abused it
Never had a plan to stop, not in that prediction
Going through fame, couldn't see I had addictions
One turned to two, turned to three, turned to four
Then I need about six a day, a little bit more
Mixin' it with lean, gotta stop people seein'
What damages can be by lookin' at me, shit
What to do 'cause I feel like a fool
And I hate any rapper makin' Xannies look cool
Shit was gettin' bad, I was filled up with hateful
Thoughts in my mind, I would argue with April
Agreed I would stop, shit I'll give it a go
By the first fuckin' night, felt like slittin' my throat
Second night, my body shaking the ambulance appear
And I'm thinkin' in my mind, what the fuck they doing here?
Suddenly I'm caught up and there's no time to muck 'round
Lucky I got here, 'cause my body 'bout to shut down

Back to square one, nah man, you can't quit
You gotta wean yourself off, that's some hard shit
What the fuck man, my brain is a mess
I can't remember that much, feel the pain in my legs
I wish it was that easy, I could give up and go
And people still got the hide to tell me pick up my phone
Maybe that's my fault, I didn't speak on it much
I didn't see it as a problem, I would keep it from cunts
Rates could always tell, when I couldn't pronounce
Certain words, brain dead, yeah should I be proud?
Anxiety was killin' me, the doctors couldn't deal with me
Put me on a program cut me down off the pills and weed
All scared, 'cause I feel on my own
I told 'em ""let me chill"", now they think I'm dissin' 'em bro
Waking up tired, I gotta take more pills
And I don't even wanna take 'em, is this fuckin' for real?
Losin' touch with myself, it's like reality's false
It's like I’m walkin' around without havin' a pulse
It's a feelin' of death, or like nothin' is left
Lose air, I'm holdin' my chest, just put a hole in my head
You see the older I get, it's gettin' scary as fuck
I'm like an eighteen in the head, I weren't aware of those drugs
The shit that they cause, I talk to mirrors on walls
I don't need this shit ever, but to pills I will fall

I opened up on 
No Rest
, told cunts everything
That I done ice, didn't leave out anything
I quit that shit, yeah, I left it flat dead
That was five years ago, they still think I'm a crackhead
If that's what we're goin' off, fuck me dead
In five years, I'll be clean, they'll be calling me a Xanny head
Funny how the world works for a paycheck
Once the fame hit, I became a train wreck
I wasn't shit anyway, so why does it count?
Why so many people love me? I can't figure it out
But I'm tellin' you now, don't you follow my path
Look you couldn’t if you tried, 'cause I'm goin' in hard
Fuck it, poppin' a pill, just to go out today
How'd I end up like this? I don't know, it's a way
Well I'm blamin' the fame, yeah, I said it before
But it's enough to make me high, feel like endin' it all, but I

Brush it off, got the fans on my side too
And my girl and my brothers and the whole crew
Spillin' the truth, it's like all I can do
That's why I don't have time for rappers that are saying they true
When they lie to their fans, apologise in the end
I never lied to mine and this is why I'm the man
I tell you what I'm goin' through, I don't care what they think
That's why I'm triple popping pills, leaning over the sink
I'm almost fuckin' crying as I'm writin' this shit
'Cause of all my close ones, and the lives I affect
I came from the bottom, I made it my problem
Created the option, now fame has adopted
My brain gotta stop it, insane I am not this
Strange we got 
Scott
 sick, I'ma watch a clock tick
Just fuck off, I said it just fuck off
If I won't have my tablets I'll find a bridge to jump off
Fucking idiots, thinking that the shit is cool
Till they dyin' in the vomit of there own drool
What I meant to say? Don’t do what I done
I've cut down on the program, yeah I've won
Repped it from the street, turned into a star then
Caught a fucking habit on the Xanax but the bars went
Crazy and I'm just dealin' with fame
I just want my fans to know that I’ll still be the same
I'm good",https://genius.com/Kerser-bad-habits-lyrics
Battlefield,The Nebulizer,2011,"Love is a battlefield

This is the final straw, yeah, he's high for sure
He's gone to buy some more, stay up from night to dawn
And they always fight, they at it all the time
But, this time, something's changing, yeah it's different tonight
She sick of living her life, she plans to get up and run away
With her kids and just live in another state
They struggle now just to feed 'cause they're poor
Where the kids playing raw, he's leaving needles on floor
He's raging bad like ""don't look at me bitch""
You go cook for the kids or cop a hook to the chin
And it wouldn't be the first, he's always smacking her up
They were deeply in love, but now he's smacking it up
His vain first priority then the kids probably
She knows this shit is going to be a hard move but honestly
She's got to go he needs his drugs and he has to steal
Escape it all 'cause his love is a battlefield

Love is a battlefield

First night without a dime in her purse
They have nowhere to go, she has to find a reserve
But she feels better with her kids by her side
And the known fact you'll never injure her right
Well, she feels freedom but she's hungry at the same time
Stress is on her mind, her kids are sickened, all night they cry
It ain't right 'cause back home he wakes up
Loads his shotty, wants revenge so he scrapes up
Enough dollars to be catching a bus
To the first place they ever met but he must
Hold it all together or he ending it forever
Never see his kid and never find connection any better
But they're long gone it was the same reserve
Her sister rang her up and said you're staying with her
So he's back roaming on the search for his next hit
He's been through the best shit is mind state is hectic

Love is a battlefield

She's living life, it's been a week and the kids' laughter
Happy at last not like a back at the start
But he's got tracks on his arms still tracking them down
He don't want to make it right he wants to smack her on down
Put a gat in her mouth like what look what you've done
He's sipping on bottles of rum over what has become
But he needs a hit to escape all his brain's thoughts
It only been four hours and he's hit like more than eight wroughts
Cashed up, pays a visit to his dealer
Pays his tick and gets some more it can't get any realer
She's long gone he's in love with a ghost
Might be dead to him so he doubles his dose
Eyes roll back, can't talk can't move
See her face move then his kids too
Out cold heart stops head falls
Love is a battlefield and that's what he's dead for

Love is a battlefield",https://genius.com/Kerser-battlefield-lyrics
Be Patient,Next Step,2015,"Kick it off now, got the outro
One shout-out to the cunts who doubt bro
Proved 'em wrong but still they hate
Couldn't have done better, I'm real they fake
And I heard 'em ask if I beef with cunts
No beef, I'm just too far in front
If that cause beef then so be it
Stop asking if I'm sober yet
I'm over it, go ten for ten
Seen the closest mates turn greedy man
And that's enough when I cut you off
Then they all call back like ""I love you Scott""
I've seen two sides, if I quit the rap
Pretty sure you wouldn't be ringin' back
Everyone around me wantin' something
What you do for me? You do fuckin' nothing
Shout to the crew though, always on the move bro
One main rule I'll never ever lose yo
Gotta say my rap, my life
Everything I've sacrificed
Everything I have, I tried
Non stop work, rap has my life
But I'll stay here, for my fans, for my fam and for my friends
Until the end I'll be the Kers
Always here to feed a verse
Feels like that like every day
Covered everything, what's left to say?
I just wanna be like left alone
Can't end up in a mental home
Been chasing my dreams for half my life
Now I'm waiting for the part where I die

This the way it goes, be patient, let me break it down
Done a couple things I'm never gonna say out loud
Thank you all the crew that got my back
They knew from my first rap there's no stopping that
This the way it goes, be patient, let me break it down
Done a couple things I'm never gonna say out loud
Thank you all the crew that got my back
They knew from my first rap there's no stopping that

Steppin' up shit every time I drop
That's the main reason they kind to Scott
And I'm kinda lost but I find a way
Thinkin' ""I'm ahead should I hide away?""
I'm gonna lose patience, time me lad
I don't even wanna write another rhyme with that
I want a clear mind, it's all I want
But everyone's dramas fall on Scott
And I'm sitting in the back like what is what?
Thinking should I just call it off?
But I came so far, too far to quit
I'll write another rhyme and ask you this
If you were me, what would you do?
Would you get personal when they write a review?
Piss on these rappers that doubted you?
Would you get a clear mind from a clouded view?
I'm losing my mind, when I rhyme I don't choose a side
Ready to make career suicide
Dunno what to do, I'll cruise all right
Shout to the fans, you pull me through
Shout to the haters, I'm hurting you
Ain't no tellin' what Kerser do
Last thing that you wanted was me verse you
But I'm lucky as fuck, I got my girl
And she makes sure that Scott's her world
And that shit there, that helps me heaps
More than any other one helping me
Walk a tightrope, don't slip and fall
And with hip hop I give my all
Album five, I'm signin' out
Until next time, all right, we out

This the way it goes, be patient, let me break it down
Done a couple things I'm never gonna say out loud
Thank you all the crew that got my back
They knew from my first rap there's no stopping that
This the way it goes, be patient, let me break it down
Done a couple things I'm never gonna say out loud
Thank you all the crew that got my back
They knew from my first rap there's no stopping that",https://genius.com/Kerser-be-patient-lyrics
Bible 4 My Enemies,S.C.O.T.,2013,"Kerser
I'm just chilling in the studio with Nebs
You know turch
Never know you down like this, Look

ABK heard that clique
Even coppers getting stomped squashed at the gigs
I've learned a lot in the last past five years
I can get your brain shot grab your mum wipe tears
'Cause when you make it to a certain success
You got the boys in the street who want to come with you, yes
So in order for that, that's how they're paying me back
To fuck you up on any circumstances, play with me lad
This ain't a gangster act, not by any means
This the bible for my enemies
I'll leave a legacy behind they can blame me
The first Oz rap to bring the street to the mainstream
And I ain't main stream, but it's strange see
As many people sussing that seem to play me
Ninth wonder of the world, you can lock it in
Read the bible, even close it says I'm gonna win
Says I gotta win, you a ought to been
I'm a fresh motherfucking rocking solid bling
You won't understand if you ain't come up like I did
That's why we laughing when these young-in's fucking biting this
I'll have a stub nose put to your grub nose
Plan the shit perfect even coppers thinking ""fuck knows?""
My boys crazy and they wiling out
If you diss me man I hope that they don't find you out
You'll be six feet under that's a final round
And I don't give a fuck if you want vinyl sound
'Cause we group up and we learned in a violent town
No disrespect but this shit ain't the 90s now
This a whole new era I'm the king of it all
You gotta move with the times or get evicted and walk
We gonna bully all these rappers cos they softer than a waterbed
Said you wanted war instead, man you should've thought ahead
Street shit, backed by the best
X on your chest, hacked to your death
Kers, Rates, ABK and a bunch o' 'nother cunts
225 signing out, didn't think we running up what's up?

 225
 ... sickest cunt out there
If they spit a diss to Kers , fuck 'em
 maximum security jail
And what?
Cunt we hate these fuck wits
Bitches 225

Big Dreams,No Rest For The Sickest,2012,"A young lad and he's searching for that cash right
'Cause he ain't really had much growing up and that's why
He got his eyes on the stars he got big dreams
He started writing raps around the age of sixteen
His friends would trip man, they telling him he got skill
And if he didn't rap he'd be known just to pop pills
He keeps beefing with cops, man his rappings are shit
A young cunt catch a charge, cop a slap on the wrist
He moves along, meets his misses at eighteen
He bugging out he just wishes he'd stay clean
They joke about it, 'magine if he bought a wedding ring
He didn't know it but she stays with him through everything
He got a cool brothers trying to discover
Why you'd never trust a snake, man they'd die for each other
So his life's still kicking it, I swear the kid lives rap
Taking every opportunity, no time to sit back
No money in the bank so he gets to the breaks
No doing it to rap, its to get off his face
Whats more important man his visions distorted
And there isn't a warning, he just leaves without caution
He drops a tape now he kind of got a local buzz
A couple heads in the scene check he knows whats up
Some enemies changed, they wanna be mates
But his eyes on the dream, he ain't dealing with fakes nah
He meets the scene and gathers most the cunts are fake as
Makes his own path while his older brother makes tracks
He steps to battles man hes serving em up
And he ain't even fucking notice cause hes swerving on drugs
But his buzz getting bigger, labels turn and ignore
But that ain't gonna keep him down cause hes burning for sure
At a show hes selling tapes gives out one for free
The best choice he ever made cause the cunt got beats
And at the time he didn't know it but his chances of failure
Dropped cause hes with one of the best in Australia
When it comes to making beats so the lad is excited
Fan base on the rise and the rappings are tightest
He got his sound and the album was lethal
Got a different reaction out of some of his people
From fans to mates, say hes not the same
But the last seven years feel like a couple of days
Go get fucked that hes changed
Man he knows who he is
A couple beats flipped now you gonna say hes a bitch
But he doesn't really care
'Cause the fans are screaming yeah
And the lights in his eyes feels like a dream there
The main plan is officially in motion
Any second now he sees his dream and hes approaching
And they say they know him, well I double please
If you fucking knew me you would know this is about me

Every cunt saying they know everything
Had to break it down for yous, now talk the shit
Kerser, we out",https://genius.com/Kerser-big-dreams-lyrics
Blessed One,Engraved In The Game,2017,"Yeah
This is motivational music
I mean I want you to get here too
Check

Okay, now I made it, I wonder if I trust you
Driving from the beach blowing weed out the sunroof
Got ‘em trippin’ out like they eatin’ on mushrooms
That’s the impact of my rhymes, it’s a rush true
I make you hair stand and a shiver on your spine too
Gift
 of the gab, yeah I got that times two
I knew I use the law of attraction
With a lot of talent mixed, man of course it would happen
On my way to the bank where my card would bounce
To walkin' into that shit to get a large amount
You can ask around, I never stop with the rap
There’s the answer if you wonder why I got it like that
I really live for the shit, don’t you try and compare
Another rapper to Kers, I got a style too rare
So when you see me keep the energy, don’t care if you’re an enemy
There’s no way in this life that you will ever see the end of me

I hustled it the right way, on another flight mate
Heading to my state to rock a show with my five-eights
This is it, this the shit that I made true
Blood, sweat and tears first to do it hope you grateful
I hustled it the right way, on another flight mate
Heading to my state to rock a show with my five-eights
This is it, this the shit that I made true
Blood, sweat and tears first to do it hope you grateful

My albums are treasures that I’m happy you found
Through all my career, I been what’s happening now
From the back of the crowd, to the front of the shit
I spilled my life on the stage, I got you loving the kid
It’s like I can’t do wrong, I move onto the next move
Got a couple shooters that are waiting on my text, true
I let loose, but these memories flash back
Of Tooheys new Winnies filled up in my backpack
Running from the five-O, hearin’ them smash lads
Screaming at the dogs “who you trying catch fag?”
They’re smashing their cars, we had a war of the cunts
Thank fuck I fought the case, the judge tore it all up
Pieces of my life, man I’m givin' you that real
Coincidence this the night the riots in Mac Fields
Started so they gave up and headed to Mac
We was in  sixteen, probably toking on crack, it’s whack

I hustled it the right way, on another flight mate
Heading to my state to rock a show with my five-eights
This is it, this the shit that I made true
Blood, sweat and tears first to do it hope you grateful
I hustled it the right way, on another flight mate
Heading to my state to rock a show with my five-eights
This is it, this the shit that I made true
Blood, sweat and tears first to do it hope you grateful

Let’s get deeper in the track, take you deeper in the rap
Pop a sleeper, have a nap, wake up dreaming in the back
Of my own whip, but who the fuck driving the shit?
They said not me 'cause I’d be colliding like…
Fuck it though I’m ready, everything I do phenomenal
I got ‘em all waitin' on my next shit to drop just to drop in stores
Let’s get back to what you’re here for
You only here 'cause you fuckin' wanna hear more
Paranoid yeah, here we go a-fucking-gain
Time to sit me down and tell me something’s different with my brain
I won’t listen, they insane, try and switch that on my plate
While I’m sittin' with my mate and he’s flickin’ on a blade, shit
Nothing changed but my house and a paycheck
And my car and my jewels and I’m famous
In my brain, I’m the same, I’m a blessed one
After Kers, we won’t never see a next up
We the first from the street to hit the major stage
Since a kid, I’ve been reppin' with the ABK
You take a fall you getting up, that’s what a man do
I’m the Kers, the one the industry can’t handle
Everyone biting, just remember the original
The three lines on the side that was rippin’ you
You can’t blow up off your own shit and it hurts brah
But don’t deny it if you’re influenced by Kerser

I hustled it the right way, on another flight mate
Heading to my state to rock a show with my five-eights
This is it, this the shit that I made true
Blood, sweat and tears first to do it hope you grateful
I hustled it the right way, on another flight mate
Heading to my state to rock a show with my five-eights
This is it, this the shit that I made true
Blood, sweat and tears first to do it hope you grateful
I hustled it the right way, on another flight mate

Bloods Thicker,Next Step,2015,"Have every prayer answered doesn't easily happen
I'm just in love with the music, I don't need to be rapping
Leap into action with every fucking beat we attacking
I speak in imagery, plus you reading the captions
Rappers acting out like sluts that are sleeping with rappers
I'm not speaking to them 
dogs, here's your flea ridden mattress
I walk into the booth and I don't need a reaction
I'll burn the fucking place down until your speakers are collapsing
And yeah we be your attraction like a magnet but we rappin here
We never slackin off in tracks,  bash your ears
Exactly what you wanna hear, I'm attacking them rappers fierce
Slashin these rappers necks from one ear to the other ear
The success that we've seen, the good and the bad
The love for rhyming won't expire, have a look in my bag
Next to the weapon that I carry there's a pen and a pad
And lyrics that'll fucking spin your fucking neck till you snap
After ten years you'll see I'm a master with this
Pass me a spliff, I'm getting harsh within these bars I writ
They wanting beef but I can smell that they're half a bitch
Market fish, licking from your pussies when you start to spit
You can eat half of my dick, I ain't the radio type
I fuckin' told you once before I'm ABK 'til I die
Fully independent rappers killing it with attitude
Pumping it until I cark it, something that I have to do

AM to PM, I be slaying a beat and
I ain't ever gonna stop unless I fade into dreamin'
And I don't know what they been saying
I just know that we be killing shit
Set a blueprint and they bite 'cause it's really sick
Best admit the shit, I gave it all the green light
Brangin' street to mainstream and I made it seem right
I ain't the mean type but if they wanna fuck around
It ain't nothing to hit your house with a couple rounds
Pay a stack on that, fuck it now it's back to rap
Top the charts back to back, back to back
Then back to back
It's so simple, I've got a loyal fan base
Life give me obstacles, you know I gotta stand straight
Cooking pancakes, sipping on a lean mix
When I die, try keep up with the remix
When the scene died, who saved the street shit?
Thank me when you can, I just gotta feed this
Sydney raps, south-west swag
Whatcha talkin' out your mouth? That's trash
Still with the saddie bag stashed in the front seat
Still got these chatty lads thinking they can compete
With the sickest, ain't no chance for that
And your missus love the Kers when she dance to rap
I'm what the scene needed, you fuckin' it up
Putting coke in your missus, straight up in her cunt, she's fucked

We got that bad man, that aggression with rap
It's a lesson in fact, two images and you can't remember what you snapped
Crash, take 'em to your legs and your back
Every line that you ever crossed and tred in your tracks
We ain't generic spitters
Yeah you've all got the same 
It's funny when we rock up and they hit the legs like Usain Bolt
The same old with my team, and I will kill for all of 'em
And they would do the same so check these bangers, we recorded 'em
My brother is my blood brother, the cunt's killin' all of 'em
When it comes to real shit my blood's thicker than water yeah
We sparked a slaughter yeah
We started right there
We fuckin' partied 'til there's fire in the quiet air

The quiet air and we standing like right there
We can tell how they stand that they're quite scared
Right there, blood brothers of rap
Cunts running, you're whack
You catch one in your back
Since we stepped in the game, we come repping with flame
The name remains in your brain 'til you're aching in pain
But I just give you life through words, and it kinda spins me out
Doctors say I need their help but I don't feel like sitting down
I'm a man, I remain on my feet
I'm the rapper that these rappers are training to be
I'm the one of a kind, but then some of the time
So stress eats me alive, never run they will find

These people hunt for cash
I can’t adapt, how you sell your soul for hundred stacks?
My life is worth more, my pride is Kers raw
I’m in the city bout to start a fucking turf war
Cos I’m so proud, my bottle watch it go down
I ain't seen no King, so I'm gonna make my own crown
I coped a call, Stracy's sitting in a prison cell
I'm spinning out, like where's my boys, cos Shoei's in as well
Is this the life we chose? Something for the nicest clothes
Sit back with the ice and doe, watch my brothers fight for hope
Fuck rhyming, if it does than it's a bonus
I say what's on my mind, and if it rhymes I didn't notice!
Hairs up on your arms stand, realness in my palm man
I hold the Earth then curl it round, no wonder people can't stand!
Safe promises, I made the snakes obvious
Sometimes I don't know who to trust, even my mates I gotta to give
Up on paranoia, burnt too many bridges
Just realised it rhymes - Kerser is the sickest!
Fuck rhyming, if it does than it's a bonus
What happened to that line man, my brain is gone it's hopeless
But I still be the realised
That's why they feel this, from the deals that the real missed
That's the bad thing bout grabbing the mic
The best rapper that you find probably hasn't been signed
And it'll stay that way, but me I'm gonna make that change
You weighing up those  you be getting fed, I'm gonna take your plate
Yeah you lads cry, strong - I've got my Dads pride
Never giving up. You holding beef it turns to mash pie
I think I'm built different, you can see the skill in it
I did this shit myself, I never ever got a mill ticket
Since the 'Highest Man', shit I've been the highest man
Promoters call my manager, you best to be supplying grams
Where I go from here? Confused, not knowing what to do
Got no other option to, make a change - I'm opted to
You can dislike, shit ice, spit fire
Imagine what I'd be, if kid never hit pipes
I sware on something you won't witness again
You won't experience I vibe like what I've writ with my pen
Because I'm sicker than them - this is the finishing slam
Fucking ill, you know the deal because I did it again - UH!",https://genius.com/Kerser-brighter-lights-lyrics

Oi, listen!

Livin' legend, I should prob'ly give out game
Get your money, trust you don't wanna live with fame
Have your own shit 'cause everybody spit the same
And no one love you underground unless you in the grave
I was battle rappin' after havin' acid tablets
At seventeen, I had more bars than a xanny habit
Bury me alive, try to bury me alive
Labels had to sign me just to get me on their side
I'm a powerful wreckin' force to be fucked with
Watch a cunt spit, it get better when the blunt lit
Do more for a brand than a brand do
You meant to wear the brand make the brand come demand you
That's how the man do Kers lad I set change
You get killed on your street that's a dead end
I'm feeling good and we can blame the tab I popped
I could quit right now and go and live off my back catalog

You can't handle all this true shit
Showed you how to hustle music
When its facts you can't dispute it
Man i got em' mad cause i didn't include em'
What we gonna do what we gonna do now
Every stage i touch i show em' how to move crowds
Sponsorships other shit and i choose songs
Apreciate me in the booth cause i can move on

Damn, how could you forget
Not like I need to drop reminders, here's a kick to the head
You motherfuckas jealous of me want a shiv to my flesh
But smokin esh the only time i take a stick to my chest then listen
Its the kers you can't find a body more fresh
Im usually in clothes that ain't even hit the store yet
Slick talk syd rap yes i rhyme grime? knocked back pussy that you probably would have died for
Til' i die swear they never gonna find a fresher
Nice jewellery let me hit it with a diamond tester
Likely never
Come see me with my creaming soda
Enough lean in it to put me in a friggin coma
Cunts in music can pretend they my friend
I mean they like you doin good but never better than them
Media attacking me man they writtin these full scripts

Can't Rest,No Rest For The Sickest,2012,"Me and Rates found a magnum .44
It was my dad's we was asking him what that's for
He said he had some enemies and we were too young
He said mum had left him, he can't tell us too much
We went back home to mums now we broke as
She always crying, she depressed I
Need to go back and work out what the fuck was up
It's been buried, block it out now we fucked on drugs
And mum can't work out why cops cuffing us
Slapped Rates in the face cause he puffed and buzzed
And my dad used to ring when he was drunk as fuck
I hear him fighting with mum, I think he loves her but
I'm only ten years old now I hug my little brother
Love my mother and my father but there's gotta be another
Way for us, I watched it fall apart
I'm eleven years old with a broken heart
It's kinda funny 'cause the shit that teared my family apart
Is the same reason why my girl's leaving, gotta laugh
Life that I know, live in pain, gotta go
Cause my brain doesn't know why I play in the zone
On the streets doing breaks where my fate would lay
Felt so locked in, couldn't break away
Don't feel the same today, 'cause rap saved my life
And when Rates hears this, will he play it twice?
Or are the memories too much? Remember it true bruz
Come along the road, don't forget what I do 'cause
You're doing it too, make moves and march on
Take my life now this could be my last song, I'm gone

Life just ticks, I might just quit
In a life like this, is my life just shit?
I got a feeling that for me it's kinda on its way
I had to tell you why I'm here I'm being honest aye
I picture gun blasts, two cunts, one mask
My thin blood marks walls, fuck I must laugh
That's a dream that I had on my birthday
Just luck that I fit it in with word play
Now if that happens I am right I was a genius
If it doesn't I am paranoid I mean this
There's my life hate I'm used to it
Last ten years mate got me moving quick
And I fight with my girl like a movie flick
'Cause she listening to rumours by a groupie bitch
I can't take this shit, I'ma break to bits
I got my taste of fame and it tastes like shit
Everyone talk shit and they taking shots
They don't know who I am but they breaking Scott
Is there anyone there that could make it stop
I don't need no hoe trying to take it off
I just need my road when I'm taking off
And I hit that stage while I'm blazing pot
This the life of a rock star stuck in the past
That's the 2-2-5 yeah I'm chucking it up
Need space today, I need to take my brain
Reconstruct that shit before it's sprayed away today
Yeah, let it roll, yeah

Tell me do you hear this, write a review
They say I can't rap deep what you like me to do?
You wanna hear about a blade tucked since I hit seventeen
Paranoid, fucked up, like I think they getting me
You wanna hear about smoking till your chest claps
Or sixteen, doing breaks I need to get that
Or bills piling up on top of the fridge
Mum yelling at the paper, how she gonna pay this
How we got a place to live but its slipping quick
She has to split, need my own place I'm spinning out shit
But I moved out young, turned boy to man
I got my dad pride now, come and join the clan
Now I don't give a fuck and I'm ready for war
I'll take your head from your neck leave your head at your door
Fuck everyone dissing, you don't know what I am
I'm a motherfucking soldier and I'm going at them
That's why I'm selling CDs on the verge of greatness
Once this drops I'll be referred to as the greatest
So sit back, there's no reason to hate
And if you still hate me now, best believe that you're fake aye

No way will I end it now
I gotta take these thoughts and send em out
I am lost so lost but I need a buzz

Crash,Tradition,2016,"Stuck inside myself again
Covered up in the bruises from my youth
And I don’t wanna face the fact
That I’m off track and won’t make it back
Say it’s never safe to crash
But don’t be sad when it fades to black

I don’t want to face the facts, I’m moving forward racing back
To pick up what was facing back, and turn it round to make the cash
They say I influence the kids in ways that I can’t understand
I’m meant to be a role model, that’s one thing I can’t comprehend
You mean to tell me where I’m from, that they thought I would make it man
The industry can’t take me, I can tell the way they shake my hand
But they don’t know my story, how I meant to paint a picture?
When it’s written with my pen and that to them is just a distant hem
We came up from the bottom and the bottom of my bottles empty
Wonder if we gotem ain’t no stoppin cause the top is scary
They start acting different and my brain is in a crazy place
But in the spotlight they tell you to hide it, it’s amazing aye?
That someone’s finally speakin out, it happens to be Kerser too
Everything I’m going through, I put em in my words to you
Good or bad or right or wrong? If I think it, I write a song
To scared for mental checkups cause they tell me that my mind is gone

Stuck inside myself again
Covered up in the bruises from my youth
And I don’t wanna face the fact
That I’m off track and won’t make it back
Say it’s never safe to crash
But don’t be sad when it fades to black

Waking up a zombie you’re to kind to blame it on me
Ain’t my fault that I am not be one to turn it down, get off me
I don’t need a bunch of parents blaming me cos their kids are swearing
Like they never hear the shit at school but blaming me’s the answer
I’m the cancer if you asking, but wait let’s stop and just ask the kids
Cause I be saving lives and they decide to look right past all this
Hundred emails weekly, here’s one that will never leave me
Single mother writes to management it’s desperate that she meets me
Cause the son he had a habit from when he was age of 14
In and out of rehab but my music’s only thing that taught him
That there’s other ways around it, so he left the rehab clean and all
Kerser through the earphones, got a job, he even sweepin floors
One night he is out with mates he copped a sucker punch and died and she just wants to thank me cause I gave him 4 more years of life
Crazy cause I’m messed up in my own head, yeah you so surprised
Poppin what I can cause I can’t handle this, I’m going 

Stuck inside myself again
Covered up in the bruises from my youth
And I don’t wanna face the fact
That I’m off track and won’t make it back
Say it’s never safe to crash
But don’t be sad when it fades to black

Ok I make a U-turn yeah, it’s time to pull my head in
And hope to jump in bead and get earphones and just forget it
Forget about the drama, life’s to short just fix it upper
When you get home, you know nudda
You can handle this your brothers
Wait along onside a road and I ain’t got my lights on neither
Need my window wipers on cause I can barely see the mirror
Almost home I guess this place is really where I get away
But before I leave I just got one more thing I wanna say

Stuck inside myself again
Covered up in the bruises from my youth
And I don’t wanna face the fact
That I’m off track and won’t make it back
Say it’s never safe to crash
But don’t be sad when it fades to black",https://genius.com/Kerser-crash-lyrics
C-Town,King,2014,"You tired again cunt?
*Kerser and Nebs muttering*
Ayo look, I'm gonna say some shit yeah?

A bad bitch tryna catch me with an eye wink
I tell her ""Fuck off, go and pour my drink""
King Kers, Nebs One at the fresh shit
Your dream girl treating us like she desperate
And she ain't even wanna speak to you
So we throw her to the crew like sweet 
She away, eshay
Everything is esh-fray
My mission is to get paid
Blew a stack at the mall for the fuck of it
Out of everything I brought I only wore half of it
Got 'em jealous, Aussie Hip-Hop has a new face
That's why my posters hanging in your girlies room mate
What's a pawn to a king?
Bitches use my film clips for a porno, it's sick
I'm still flipping cash, Nebs still on the payroll
He gets his cash then he looks at me like 'HEY YO!""

Bitches wanna get down in the C-Town
They know we don't fuck around in the C-Town
I come through with a pound in the C-Town
Sipping lean at the spot is where I be found
Bitches wanna get down in the C-Town
They know we don't fuck around in the C-Town
I come through with a pound in the C-Town
I got my weed with a bottle look at me now

In the studio with Nebs and we sipping on some rich shit
Bitches screaming at the door for some real dick
Money on our mind, Gucci on the shirt
Do the Kers bitch, do it, do it 'til it hurts
Why you angry at your sales, you can't move nah?
My whole crew move units, that's the truth brah
Took my missus to the snow for a month
Came back, new pay fans are loading me up
It's all the same, I'm a hustler I came from the streets
The same ones that play this screaming ""Fuck the police"" (dog)
In the hood, drive through in my new car
See the boys, call the shots, then I cruise brah
I'm a Rap God, no Shady tho
More drugs, more liquor, more crazy bro
Next promoter that is shifty with the bread swap
I'm leave it at this *click* headshot

Bitches wanna get down in the C-Town
They know we don't fuck around in the C-Town
I come through with a pound in the C-Town
Sipping lean at the spot is where I be found
Bitches wanna get down in the C-Town
They know we don't fuck around in the C-Town
I come through with a pound in the C-Town
I got my weed with a bottle with a mean sound

*Kers and Nebs muttering*

Bitches wanna get down in the C-Town
They know we don't fuck around in the C-Town

Da Kers Effect,Lifestyle,2019,"If I fall down, would you pick me up?
Would you come to the bottom and then lift me up?
Cuttin' off cunts, I can see they're fake
I can tell why they wanna be mates, they snakes
It's crazy days till I fade away
Forget who I am, forget ABK
Forget all I done, forget all the fun
Forget all the fame, forget all the cunts
Like wipe my brain, it's quite insane
Will you hit backspace when you type my name?
That's overthinking, where to go?
None of you cunts can scare me bro
Been through more, been here before
Had 'em all doubt me, now they need me more
What you meant to do when the table change?
And your mind play tricks in your crazy days
Catch up shit like Karma now
Had to give me Kalma to calm me down
Had to hit me hard, I'm sparrin' now
Rap turnin' into ""Who be the hardest?"" now, wow
Shoulda seen this comin'
When the scene was runnin'
Away from me, they couldn't keep up, I was patiently
Sittin' there like, ""Who want a go?
Who want it with the team that everybody know?""
And everybody bitin', everybody writin'
Everybody fightin', everybody likin'
My clique, what you forgot?
Forgot what we did for the rap, you gronk?
Forgot if it wasn't for the Kers or Scot
There wouldn't be a scene for you nerds to rock?
Earn your props
I hear your songs, I turn 'em off
You fear the god, I burn the lot
You're not near the top, that's Kerser's spot

Like try break down everything
I did to push the scene forward
Off my own back
After being blacklisted from everywhere
So then I created a new scene
So rappers who would've usually been ignored
Now have an opportunity to get heard and get paid
That's 'cause of me bro

Listen up there, I slap your face
Let me take you back, back in the day
Two-thousand-eight, poor as shit
Kickin' them rhymes, they raw as shit
Made a buzz, yeah, but the radio
Would ignore back then, wouldn't play me bro
If you wasn't on the FM, you wasn't gonna make it
I was the first in the country to break that
I was the first in the country to face that
I was the first in the country to make rap
Blow up from the underground
No barriers to break 'cause I done 'em now
G.O.A.T, that's the reason
With another million, what's the meanin'?
What's the point in me braggin' more?
Reflectin' back, I'm glad I saw
Everything I did, everything that I fought through
Every single kid that is rappin' now, I taught you
Be yourself, don't change for them
I taught you that here in Australia, man
Get that right when they write the history
Don't twist shit, don't make a mystery
When I leave, I bet they miss me
Include this, I'm reppin' Sydney
South west, a monster
Get the doctor
Shoulda' changed me when you had the chance
But you try block me out so I had to stand
Up for myself when the public knew
Kerser fans were like, ""Fuck you too""
Brang rap culture to the streets
I could go on forever, I'ma leave it to the beat

Got a camera again
Look

Fuck's happening? Yeah, it's been a minute
Had to green up in it, now I gotta speak and hit it
I got the buzz lad, I'm set to get paid
If they ain't hating all I gotta say is get great
You just want the position I'm in
But that ain't gonna happen 'cause they listening in
I got the underground rap scene breaking the stories
You should thank me, why the fuck you even hating me for it?
Doesn't make sense, swag in your face yes
What they set to do and I put stains on a shaved leg
I'ma party man, we only live once
A bottle straight sipping looking like I'm owning the club
And they yelling out my name and the phone won't stop
When I was Scott no one even rang me up, like what?
I used to dress poor skinny cunt looking meth head
Now I'm fresh, done it all myself; Deadset
Who would've thought I'm the pick of the bunch
I'm that warm good feeling like a dick in a cunt
Now I've got a party coming and you're all invited
Got the date set now and it's time to supply it
You getting mad I'ma plug my shit
I was meant to piss you off, you can suck my dick
So we kicking off in Sydney, make a move to Newie
Get my bud and rock the show come on you people knew me
From there we hitting Adelaide, I'm gonna steal a massive plane
And park the cunt on stage and hop out with a fucking acid plate
I'm Mozart, I go hard, I smoke up
Picking up a loan shark then I go to Hobart
It's well earned, then Melbourne; the fuck's up?
Set so dopey can't believe I'm a drunk cunt
I must jump up to Brissie with that sticky icky
Get on stage and pick a biccie right into your bitch's titties
Then head west like yes, yes I'm in Perth
Sydney Swager, let me show you how
The king works lets out the way on the track, let me rock shit
Thought I better add, get your tickets now from Oztix
Got no shame come and whitness a star, but
Something that you'd kill to see, I rip 'em apart
I woke up with no drugs you know but
Within ten minutes I was high and toked up
Kerser come on, say it again, call it
What you want my I making it main
I'm loving how I'm feeling, Ratesy asked me at the start
What's my aim? Now we tripping 'cause we gonna hit the mark
To anyone who's doubted, how you feeling? It's all good

You know the name I’m the topic of discussion
Cause they talk about me daily maybe diss me man it's nothing
I got the buzz and they bouncing back

Went up my nose stream oh he blazed and it's so green
Won't see me OD cause I don’t breathe
The home team so I got the support
I'ma plug my shit, I swear I've said that before, ha
This time it's reverse for Kerser
Let's spin that shit around yeah Perth is first ah

In a helicopter yelling ABK

They go crazy when they see my fucking face yes
Catch me at the hifi probably gonna sky dive
Hope they don't write another page about drive-by
Next bruz Brisbane is up ask them I'm known as the sickest cunt
And the thing about briz is that they love this kid

Last track I reversed it yes, but after Briz' this time fucking Perth is next
As soon as I touched down, weed lit puffed clouds
Five star balcony thinking fuck how
Did I get here Perth goes so hard
Kers one king swagged an you know brahh'

Fucks happening
Yeah it's been a minute
Dick inside the box
I think I left my semen in it
Aye lad
It's that time of the year
On stage, new watch and the shiniest ears
I'm rocking Melbourne first
This time around
In the CBD, just drivin' 'round
When I hit that stage in Melbourne man
There ain't many that compete with Melbourne fans
They pumped as fuck, they jumping up
They know the king, gon' fuck shit up
V.I.P in the V.I.C
Melbourne go hard, I might D.I.E
It's the Kers, I could make a nun pop her dress
If I put it in her bum, am I holy blessed ?
Next up is Sydney man
My hometown shit, I got the sickest plan
You should spit it loud, while I'm spitting it proud
Rates and Jay on stage throwing pingas to the crowd
Uh, hold up, we might get banned
That big jet plane, just might not land
Before we crash more, please let me end my joint
King Kong shit, swinging off centrepoint
So dope I'm the colder, open the whole bar
While I'm kicking back having coke with that cola
Then I'm off from Syd to Bris
Big signs when I land like the sickest is, here
Ask shit
The Q.L.D, gonna go so nuts from the new LP
And I bet mother fucking, ready steady raise the roof bruh
Fucking am I dreaming ? Cause I'm beaming in a new car
In a new state, with a few mates, on stage in Bris, with the new pay
Punchline, fuck that ima rack one
Can't afford my album, go to stores and fucking dack one
That ain't the end yet, I got some great shit
I got some bitches throwing bras on the stage, shit
I'm up here with Rates and Jay, and state to state, it's still A.B.K
Uh
Bring me back down to earth, they said I'm lost, fucked up and I'm down in Perth, shit
Where to go, cause I'm late to the show, in Perth, swear mums it's the craziest bro and I left my mind there, like a couple of times
If you find it let me know, what the fuck can I rhyme
Now I'm in Fremantle, west of Aus
Where the pills are popped and the energy hot
Party from the sun up, party when the sun down
Then I'm meeting Adelaide with another comedown
But it's all good, cause the bud here
When I land, have the dealer with the truck here
Screaming ""fuck yeah"", this the life brah
So smooth, so fresh, looking nice huh
See me live bruh, it's the best shit
Throwing ice at the crowd, going hectic
Cunts getting cut up in the moshpit
Only joking get your tickets from Oz Tix
They blame me, saying I'm a bad guy
I'm just looking for some head, like a magpie
More dates on the way, hitting Tas to
Don't ask why, I'm just feeling like I have to
Newcastle love the king
When I hit that stage with a hundred spliff's
And just throw to the crowd, when they get kicked out
Then I rock it in the street, that's how they knew we getting down
Say you gonna shoot, you aim for me
I gotta a pound underground, in da A.C.T
I'll share mother fucker, I'll pass it around
As I leave, drive by's on the Parliament House, huh
King dropped, and it topped the charts
But it happens every year, we told em from the start
Get your tix now, you can call it promo
I should have a dollar sign as my logo
King dropped and they saying it's the best yet, cop your tickets, see ya there, DEADSET !
I'm feeling on the of the world again
And yo Nebs, we've done it again
Go cop that album King
See why it went number 1

Any style I rip to bits
It's Deadset five, can you picture six?
'Bout to hit the road like every year
Hit your state, yeah, the legend's here
Shake your hand but we don't fist pump
'Cause the rings on my hand leave ya fists split up

Make history's page, the King okay
Let me get into the tour, yeah state to state
Finally rich, let the haters hate
Tickets selling quick better save the date
Come see me on stage with ABK
February six will reveal this shit
Five pills popped in St. Kilda, Vic
Melbourne crowd, fuck they off their head
Them cunts don't stop till they drop and dead
Sold-Out Hi-Fi, got a bigger venue
Coke, weed, bass and pills on the menu
V.I.C come see what we can do
We do the shit other rappers pretend to
Back on my shit then I'm back in Syd
Jumping in a crowd an attack a bitch
In my hometown and I'm drunk as fuck
I'm a sicker cunt then a fucking slut
Sydney represent like all my life
I think we connect 'cause we all alive
Bring your bitch along, come see the lad
I'll be stuck to her cunt like a libra pad
Then I'm at Bris at Eastern Hills
Gotta advertise so I'm eating pills
Brisbane fans always keep it real
And you can't tell them that they need to chill
QLD, fucking love this place
Every cunt high like they up in space
Brisbane's set that's some wild shit
We smashing 'em more than Miley's clit!
Then I lit a joint in south of Oz
Northern Lights, grab an ounce of pot
Yellin' out the crowd ""Knock-out a cop""
Loving every minute, ain't about to stop
Adelaide weed, I swear it's so sick
Fuck flying home, I need a road trip
Sleeping on the wheel, Jay pass the coke quick
Rates in the back with the rack
Then we hit Perth, jump out the car
News around here I'm a fucking star
Bitches got their tittes in a wonderbra
And we heading to the city in a marvelous car
Perth go hard every time we rap
Lost my brain here, I ain't find it back
Fremantle come and see the king
It's ABK, we the team to win
From the bottom man, can't deny the skill: raw
Had them all tripped my face on a billboard
Then the ARIAs, topped the shit
Number one album, go and cop the shit
Kers one with a gun in a mosh pit
Thought about it, I can get your tickets now from OzTix
King Kers, I'm the best of them, and
I recommend till Deadset ten man
You listen in 'cause I'm hectic man
With a hectic plan then I set the trend
Death threats got you sitting on your death bed
Saying that I'm dead, got it wrong I'm dead fresh
Picking up a mic, spinning out in a head mess
Bass so heavy that it's leaving cunts breathless
Gotta say Next Step is the best yet
Cop that shit for the hits - Deadset

Yeah, you know the go
I'll catch ya's at the shows
I'm feeling on top of the world again man

It must be for real 'cause now I can feel
And I didn't mind
It's not my kind
It's not my time to wonder why
Everything's gone white
And everything's grey
Now you're here now you're away
I don't want this
Remember that
I'll never forget where you're at
(Oh fuck, you got a camera again?)

Fuck's happening? Yeah it's been a minute
Topping ARIA charts, I don't need to win it
Jump up fresh cunt you be missing me
Kers one still saying fuck the industry
Rocking up to my gigs with a pitch-fork
On the stage yelling ""Where's Tracy Grimshaw?""
Same Kers who had the youth in a frenzy
And send every cunt crazy in their twenties
Once again cunt, I'm hitting the road
Get your missus on stage and put my dick in her throat
There's the lines that they rip and shred up
It's deadset six can you picture seven?
Here we go kick it off in Melbourne
They love me there, I'm the kid they yelling
From the crowd and their eyes are wide
Then their looking at mine, mine are twice the size (shit)
V.I.C I love the cunts
First week of March got a bunch of buds
Drop to the airport and I'm rollin' spliffs
Cunts see me, they're like holy shit
Then I'm up to the Q.L.D
I'm a sick cunt true, well you tell me
Bris they are hoping for me
They want a feature like their something on a pokie machine
Another year with the Brissy vibe
Throwing eccys to the crowd to get ya missus high
That's right girls, you're getting frisky right
And don't blame me if the bitches die (shit)
March seventeenth and I'm back to home
Talkin' in code 'cause they tapped my phone
Sydney city I'm a fucking king
It's ABK still, the cunts to win
Next day, gotta head down to Tas too
In a boat on the wharf 'cause the rack's too
Sensitive for the sniffer dogs
So we going over waves and we sniff the lot (shit)
Rockin' up to the shows in a mac truck
Titties  from the skinnies to the fat sluts
And we back to Fowlers man
Crash a plane into the place like their towers damn
Hopped out, not a scratch, I'm okay dude
If you're givin' me spliff, better make two
Adelaide, yeah, you know what's next
I'm gonna talk about your drugs, buds, weed and sesh yes
That's right, from the east to west
And I ain't gonna lie, your weed's still the best, yes
I walk around like I'm in a maze
With my chainsaw on so they clear the way, ayy
Chop the arm of a cunt in a front row
Hangin' off the other arm of a dumb ho
Now they try to cut my tour down to one show
Never mind, off to Perth, last time bro
Step on stage and I'm drunk with my shades on
No triple J 'cause I never play a gay song
Jump out to the crowd, they won't let go
Can you blame them? It's the Kers, I'm the best bro
Perth city always show me love
Search Perth titties with my boner tucked
Security scared 'cause I own the club
Then I'm yellin' to the crowd, fuckin' show me drugs
Never ever change, always stay the same
Came a long way, never changed from fame
Ten years ago, on a train with Rates
Now, I'm rack fucked up, on a stage with Jay
Fuck backstage, playing the harmonica
I'm a fat cunt next to The Veronicas
Throw a bitch by the head to the moshpit
Wait, once again, go get ya tickets now from Oztix
We're ahead now let me get back on the right track
I'm so fresh, the word fresh won't deny that
I'm the man and this is where your prize at
Diss myself, I'm the only one that fights back
Still the king, still cruising bro
Till I bruise a nose and fuckin' Ruby Rose
Probably get sued when I drop this shit
And tell the judge ""Fuck you, you can suck my dick""
Gotta be my best bet, leaving you on death rest
Turn you to a red head, wait, another death threat?
Can't be 'cause I'm headin' to the next set
I'ma see you at the gigs, deadset

Ch-yeah  (
Get ya tickets now from Oztix
)
I guess I'll see ya there (
Get ya tickets now from Oztix

We gon' party (
Get ya tickets now from Oztix

Deadset 7,Deadset,2017,"I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you
Were you born to resist or be abused?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Oh fuck, you got a camera again?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Feels like I’ve said that before

Fuck's happening? Yeah, it’s been a minute
They surprised I’m alive 'cause I’ve been the sickest
Bitches dance, get your hands in the air now
Shave your pussy, I’m just saying let your hair down
They all ask for a photo, what?
Put grenades on you phone, that’s a photobomb
Getting under your skin, yeah you rap like a homo
Probably get offended if I told you to vote no
I’m the reason why your bitch is late
It’s Deadset seven, can you picture eight?
I’m a different guy, make you hit subscribe
Then delete every video I think you like
Let me tell you 'bout the tour I'ma get you in the hot shit
Hit pause here and get your tickets now from Oztix
Spin it right round, we start in Tas
Snort half the rack and beat a heart attack, back
On stage, I’m fightin' on
In Tassie on the cloud, but I’m twice as strong
They love me here and I’m rapping it fat
Hit stage so hard ain’t a gap in the MAB
Tour starts there on the tenth of March
Tripping out on stage can’t forget my bars
Tas know the G-O, know the beast flow
Gonna fall asleep right where the weed grows
Next up: fuck yes, it’s Vic
Melbourne crowd some hectic shit
Touch down off a plane, drive round in a rental
Copper chasing that but I ran out of petrol
Back to the venue, Kers on the menu
I ain’t even sneeze but they all say “bless you”
No stress, I'm like a local there
They call me King Kers, they know I’m the man
I’m at the casino spending the green notes
M-E-L-B-OURNE let me breathe bro
Oz ARIA, number one
It’s in the charts, they were like ""fuck another one""
What else do you expect from Kers?
Twenty-third of the third when I land in Perth
Jumpin’ off a plane and I’m off my head
Tripping out like I got a fuckin' wonky leg
Can’t fuck with Kers, I’m loving Perth
People can’t say a lot without a hundred words
But it’s all good bro I’m the fuckin' man
If I write you a rap, it’s a hundred grand
Anyway yo, Perth is sick
Good all around like a perfect tit
Now I’m hitting my hometown, bringing my own crown
Wear it on stage like Sydney got the throne now
Ah fuck the crowd is nuts
And my ears kinda hurt 'cause they’re loud as fuck
Feel so high, I could fly away
Put my dish in the box like a microwave
Oh shit yeah Kers is back
And you can’t get rid of me I’m like a herpie rash
Sydney’s on April sixth
On stage with sunnies cause I’m baked as shit
You know how Kerser do
Yeah I’m rich but I still take a purse from you
And the tour got me fucked up, let me chill
Got you seeing double like a eccy pill
Gonna get in trouble 'cause I mentioned drugs
Got the game on fire, check the temperature
Sydney going crazy, let's fuck it up
Got the spliffs in the air now jump you cunt
We run a muck, from the day to night
And we don’t need a plane to be stayin' high
Speaking of bud, Adelaide is next
Out of everyone bud, Adelaide the best
So we blaze a sesh there and celebrate
Every step that I take man, I elevate
Ate a mushroom now I got a belly ache
Did I mention I was high on the telly mate?
When they sat me there right next to a ho
Some feminist bloke name Jessica Rowe
Fuck her off, Adelaide was sick
I mean I think it was, I can’t remember it
Now the Q-L-D still high as fuck
Run a competition, see who got the tightest cunt
Fuck waiting for me at Eaton Hills
I was there two years ago, I’m peaking still
Thanks Bris, now I’m up to Cairns
Had to add a show yeah, 'cause I never been there
Fuck man their King has arrived
They said I love myself, is that a big surprise?
I didn’t think so, Cairn’s know what’s up
I could hit an alley-oop if you throw me bud
In Cairns with a can, you can tell that I’m high right
Cutting off your hands and I ask for a high five
Oh yes, you know we high
So if you in Cairns get to know me right
King Kers with a capital K
Racking up lines at the back of the stage
Better stop there, they’ll cancel gigs
Are you off your head, don’t answer this
I’m a beast when I flow and I set the trends
Get the whole country saying ""Deadset"" again
Too swag and I’m sitting in a sports car
I could turn a good girl into a pornstar
Have her going off tracks like a D-rail
Film the shit, I could send it to your email
Heard you hate me, time it as you hold breath
I just got new diamonds in my Rolex
I'ma get you stamped like an X pill
When Kers on the mic, man it gets real
Sydney representing till my death yep
I don’t know but I’m pretty sure I met death
Might have been 'cause I haven’t even slept yet
Everyone tellin' me I gotta get rest
This is it, gonna go, don’t you stress, yes
Just get ready with a sesh, till your head's wrecked
""Engraved In The Game"" is the best yet
I'ma see you at the shows, Deadset",https://genius.com/Kerser-deadset-7-lyrics

Kerser
]
I've been roamin' around, always looking down
At all I see
Painted faces fill the places
I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you and all you know
And how you speak
Countless lovers under cover
Of the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Fuck, you got a camera again?
Deadset, yo
(Someone like you)

Fuck's happenin'? Yeah, it's been a minute
Drinkin' bleach, what you mean you're meant to clean with it?
I'm killin' cunts like the pingers of Defcon
I turn into a coma if my shit ever slept on
Got my Sportsbet lookin' like a bank account
What I'm on, shit, I ain't 'bout to say it loud
Bang beats, same streets got the playlist
Delete it all, name it Kers if you play this
This the part where I start gettin' selfish
Eighth deadset man, I do it 'cause I sell ticks
Melbourne first and I think I gotta drive
'Cause the shit that I'm takin' is too  to fly with
VRC, yeah, the Kers is back
In the CBD with the purple dacked
They love the Kers 'cause I'm never known to tone down
Hit that stage and it's feelin' like a hometown
Oh now, in Melbs, off my head bruz
She head bang, let's see what her head does
Next up, it's a party bruh
I wipe my arse with the invite for the ARIAs, huh
Syndey, yeah, my home is next
Still get good reception if my phone was dead, yeah
This the vibe that we live, we in Sydney
I rep  everyone know the sick me
Got a bitch here, lookin' like she Britney
You know three, you should leave him here with hickeys
Come along, I'ma be at The Metro
Won't be the first time I killed a metro
Thanks Syd, gotta jet to the next day
Fuck a wave man, I set the whole template
Adelaide, what the fuck is up?
You know I'm 'bout to say that I love your bud, ayy
Fuck me, I'ma be in a 
Paddy wag'
If I'm getting caught with what's in my saddybag
ADL, that's the city of churches
Change that shit to your city is Kerser's
Jump around bitch, I wanna see you got tits
Forgot to say, get your tickets now from Oztix
Ayy, Perth, yeah, the man is back
With a venue change, you demanded that
So I'm in Perth city, yeah, the cunts are back
On stage, got 'em feelin' like Hunter's back (Rest in peace)
Shout out to the SBX
P-city, Kers one, yeah, I get respect
West side of Oz in a pink hummer
Said a name but we just call her dick sucker
Got a bitch here lookin' like Jennifer
Lopez, and know too I'm gettin' head off her
It's Deadset, yeah, a different kind
This is Deadset eight, can you picture nine?
Got some bills that I bring to Tas
The only place that I've seen six fingers at, ha
That's a joke, don't be stupid lad
I love Tas cunt, I got a crew in Tas
Lock it in, eighteenth of May
Got the whole crowd screamin' ABK
Still the same crew wylin' out
Still rep ABK, how you like me now?
Still twenty-two-five to the day I die
Still Kers, same cunt, every day I'm high
Still blow weed, still drop my bars
Still make Bitcoin, still top the charts
I'm the line at the end, I'm the bolts and nuts
Now I'm headin' off to Bris 'cause it's off its guts
What can I say? Man, I'm lovin' Bris
Came on her face, guess I dumped my kids
Eaton Hill, shit, I said that right
I said that all wrong back in number five
Bris city, sick city, yeah, the shit litty
Can't wait to be back, poppin' six biccies
After Bris man, I'm up to Cairns
Ask anyone I meet man, I love my fans
Backstage, red eyes with a blunt lit
Any state, any town, man I run shit
But this place like paradise
And my fans like a cold, they can sacrifice
Effortless tremendous chains hang from Benzas
Maintain my meds and they sway my message
Get tickets, 
Lifestyle
 is the next step
If you mix that with a bit of 
No Rest
You knew what it was when I blew up, true cunt
Made a lot of money 'cause my tunes are too tough
Breakin' all the records and I moved up, crews past
Through me in the middle like I tuned up two sluts
Really ain't a fresher MC than the Kerser
Put you in the ER, followed by murder
Wait a minute, gotta flip the shit
Work it out for yourself, man I'm sick with this
From Mel to Tas and Perth and back
And Adelaide, I'm a Sydney lad, fact
Real rap, sliced up in the flavour
Year later, had my weed in a paper
Smooth flow, don't be trippin', think I'm lazy
Untouchable, they try to recreate me

Deadset 9,Deadset,2019,"And I saw it coming
I saw emptiness and tragedy
And I felt like running so far away
Then knew I had to stay
And I know when I'm older
I look back and I still feel the pain
I know I'll be stronger, and I know I'll be fine
For the rest of my days
I've seen better days
Put my face in my hands
Ah fuck, you got a camera again?
Get down on my knees and I pray to God
Hope he sees me through 'till the end
Kers

Fuck's happenin'? Yeah, it's been a minute
Give a sniffer dog bread with some pingas in it
Been a minute, they been waiting for this shit bruz
God threw the book at me when he was making sick cunts
All you motherfuckers and them other suckers
Had my numbers pumping back when I was starting something
Fucking cuddle, let me cuddle with Kers bars
The scar will never leave, it's staying there like a birthmark
Got gold records I ain't even brag about
I can't be fucked to even take them out the wrapping now
Hear a deadset, you know I'm about to go tour
I ain't like Coke Zero, all my coke pure!
Same as last year I wanna start in Melbourne
Kerser on the ticket every dealer wanna sell them
I'm in Melbourne, it's Kers, yeah they ain't realer
Drop my location, I'm in St. Kilda
Back in the city with the pills and green
On stage, braggin' 'bout how I built the scene
And I brag how I got my artillery perfected
Injected the scene when the shit was on the deathbed
I'm the lifeline with the mic on
What you try find when you try find nice rhymes, I might
Just chill in Melbz and I cruise on the West Gate
Eshay, Melbourne love me but the next state
My hometown Syd with the crew and that
It's still Kers, 225 what we doing lad?
Look, this the place where the Kers come up and spit
Tell radio I ain't need it, suck a dick
Had a pill and I dunno what the fuck it is
Got me doing backflips off the Harbour Bridge
Here in Sydney, it started with my hot spit
Thought about it, I can get your tickets now from OzTix
Or Moshtix maybe even Ticketek?
Gotta keep it real with you man, I didn't check
Leaving Syd, now we off to Tas
I got bags of the racks that's in shopping bags
See me shopping lad just to pop some tags
I'm in Hobart high, bring you Glocks and that (Ayy)
On stage right hand put the Sprite can
I can live forever, you should go and check the lifespan
Backtrack, lost track what the fuck was that?
Forgot to say that I'm gonna be at Summernats
Heard the bitches get around there with no bra
Won't get paid 'cause I'm gonna steal their show cars
Take a joke, fuckin' hell back to my show
Shut the shit down and my fans will kill five-O
On a sidetone, I just met a fine hoe
Said she wanna fuck, I said she gotta get in line tho
Now I'm in Perth city on the west side
So smashed you can tell by the red eyes
I love Perth every-time I stay
I get too fucked up and blames time delay and aye
Fucked up when the Kers in Perth
I drink enough purp on the flight to murder me first (whoo)
Brisbane up next, so you heard that?
The stage stop like ""Shit man, the Kers back""
I bring the city from east to west
I said Eaton Hills instead I'm eating next pills
Fuckin oath, we in Brisbane man
I'm like it's Deadset 9, can you picture 10? (Look)
Love you Queensland, see you when I touchdown
Then I head to Adelaide, I can smell the buds
And in Deadset 2, I had something to say
I said the best buds are here and nothing has changed, wait
I'm at the HQ, looking like a Kingpin
She fell in love, I said ""Bitch, it's a king thing""
Tryna smuggle shit back in a saddy bag
Won't work have to hit it with a vacuum lad
Raising hell in the ADL
Smelling like a weed crop and I'm blazed as well
Back to back, I need something new
Due to high demand, I'm hitting Darwin too (And what)
I'm excited, first time that I'm set here
Darwin been waiting for the Kers for like ten years
I'm in NT, looking like I'm doing meds
Crowds jumping like they on a bunch of sudafeds
Shut it down, it just happened again
I just sold more tix than when I rap on the stage (smart)
Lay it out everybody place your best bet
Roll the Dice album tour, Deadset!

Kerser, you know what happens from here
You know the go
I'ma see you at the show
Roll the Dice March 2020
Tour soon after

Different Shoes,Next Step,2015,"This is for the kid, lost with nowhere to go
The kid that knows that there’s hope when his parents don’t
Understand, staring at the smoke, dreaming big
Or the kid trying to make it out from where he lives
The kid that hits the books and studies for his A+
The kid living like a crook that only takes drugs
To escape, 'cause he’s lost, and never found trust
All he cared, working hard, from the ground up
Or the girl waking up to face the world alone
For the single mum trying to build a happy home
With no man trying to feed the kids on the dole
Or the girl that needs a hit, dancing on the pole
Or the man, who breaks a sweat, but he stays in debt
The alcoholic at the pub always placing bets
The man facing stress, going through a breakup
Wants to give up, but he can’t, gotta make bucks

Different shoes but we headed to the same place
This life we in, contradicting to the human race
Different places, different faces, but the same themes
The highs and lows, gonna face the things what will they be
Different people, different faces all across the globe
It ain't all about the dough, it’s bout what you know
Different shoes but we headed to the same place
This life we in, contradicting to the human race

The lost soul, out of clutch in the mental home
The inmate who doesn’t know when he’s comin’ home
The kid punching cones, thinking that the shit is cool
And not knowing what he’s missing when he’s skipping school
Or the kid just spawned knowing what’s ahead
In this life while another person faces death
For one it’s both, for the other, it’s his worst day
Or the gut working nine to five to earn pay
This is life same day different time frame
Play it right win or lose this is life’s game
Just the way it is, you must adapt to the stress and strain
Never give in to it all when it tests your brain
We all the same different shoes on the same track
The path of life we walking on, we can’t change that
Make the most of what you got, see you can hit the heights
Or you can hit the lows, it’s up to you on how you live your life

Different shoes but we headed to the same place
This life we in, contradicting to the human race
Different places, different faces, but the same themes
The highs and lows, gonna face the things what will they be
Different people, different faces all across the globe
It ain't all about the dough, it’s bout what you know
Different shoes but we headed to the same place
This life we in, contradicting to the human race

Never knew I’d give advice at times I needed it
Why’d I start another habit when I need to quit
Seen some lows seen some highs, what be comin’ next?
Ain't I livin’ in the past the more I think ahead?
Wide awake, still got a dream been through nightmares
And you will fall if you think that life fair
Back in the day, scrapin’ for a stick to get a hit
Now we makin’ hits for the kids scraping for a stick
Now we on the stage doing music
That we make for you, I seeing all the stages
In our life that we made It through
Never give up no matter how hard the circumstance
First you must believe, find a dream, then you work your plan
No matter if the odds against, with common sense, look at me
Started as some kids from public housing, broke and hooked with weed
Made the most of what we got, you gotta do the same too
Stay true, and even though we ain't always in the same shoes

Different shoes but we headed to the same place
This life we in, contradicting to the human race
Different places, different faces, but the same themes
The highs and lows, gonna face the things what will they be
Different people, different faces all across the globe
It ain't all about the dough, it’s bout what you know
Different shoes but we headed to the same place
This life we in, contradicting to the human race",https://genius.com/Kerser-different-shoes-lyrics
Do The Kers,The Nebulizer,2011,"Yeah, this is Kerser, now um
You're about to learn the new dance craze that's taking the world by storm
And all the bitches are doing it
Everywhere you go and it's called the Kers

So you know what I do in a verse
This is different, I'ma teach you how you're doing the Kers
You got your left foot in you got your left foot out
You got the right hand up you got the right hand down
Ya take a little step forward then you're doing the twirl
That's for the fellas now please, we get to the girls
You get your hands on your hips then shaking your tits
You shake that arse, shake your tits til your breaking your ribs
You gotta, stand straight, readjust you clothes
Take a step to the left then you touch your toes
It's the Kers, do the Kers, doing it club to club
And the gutter motherfuckers do it pub to pub
I'ma crack the speakers and attack the feature
If you motherfuckers even try the Macarena
It's the new shit, exclusive, the moves that work
All my fellas and my bitches come and do the Kers

Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Till it hurts bitch; till it, till it hurts bitch
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch, do the Kers bitch
Till it hurts bitch; till it, till it hurts bitch

This is easy, dance shit, chuck it back
I dance at gigs, no need for me to fucking rap
Front to back, yeah they doing the Kers
I got the fellas bopping round, the bitches losing their skirts
I got the guards at the door and they asking for more
When Kerser's in the fucking club it's never hard to score
So if they laugh at ya'll just stop and do the Kers bitch
Play this song fifty million times until you learn it
It's the new thing; you stand aside you're missing out
You really wanna be the lost cunt asking 'what's this about'?
I didn't think so, grab another drink ho
Place your thumb and your index on your big toe
I'm charging lessons if you struggle to learn
Sorry love, you're a fat slut, a bubble to burst
You don't want trouble with Kers
We getting down with the movement
Now we can do it, uh come on, move it

Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Till it hurts bitch; till it, till it hurts bitch
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch, do the Kers bitch
Till it hurts bitch; till it, till it hurts bitch

I got pensioners busting, doing Kers on the bus
They can't help it man they have to 'cause it hurts but they must
Be down with the new phase, nothing you can do mate
Ice Fein's busting out the Kers for like two days
Straight no sleep, a slayer with no peak
If you don't believe it's taking off you better go see
I'm on a stage and I'm doing the Kers lad
I'm in a rage so I'm doing a purse snatch
That's irrelevant; I know I gotta get on track
Yeah girl, on your knees then you bend your back
Send em back if they asking where the Kers at
Complete strangers like ""damn I wanna learn that""
It's real simple; I'm like Timberlake and Usher
Well if they didn't sing and they weren't no cocksuckers
Blockbuster, I'm something you can't miss
So do the Kers while you're shaking that arse bitch

Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Till it hurts bitch; till it, till it hurts bitch
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch, do the Kers bitch
Till it hurts bitch; till it, till it hurts bitch

Yeah, so um, all the ladies that can't dance
Don't sweat it, you can still come see me and do the Kers
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch, do the Kers bitch
Till it hurts bitch; till it, till it hurts bitch",https://genius.com/Kerser-do-the-kers-lyrics

I do recommend that you listen to this
Pump loud, got em shocked and they're staring and shit
Most of them fucking love it but they're scared to admit
I don't give a fuck what you think, I'm from the street
Pow pow past your house when I stomp the beat
Me and Nebs making shit you never heard before
Charlie Poulton and cunts like ""that ain't raw""
I'm a motherfucking maniac, brain attack, ain't you wack
Eyes on your lips motherfucker, can you say it back?
Di-di-didn't think so, staying on my thug shit
Tell me no progression when we just made a club hit
Fu-fu-fuckwit, best admit that we run shit
Never knew we run it then we calling you a dumb prick

Back on track, bet your tracks are wack
Only making boom-bap 'cause you can't adapt
Don't-don't get me wrong lad, I'm into that
Just like to switch it up every time I spit a rap
If you hate me for that, get your fuckin' brain cracked
Get your house ran through, get your brother's chain smashed
Fuck Aussie hip hop man, I'm finding it boring
Hear ten percent, the other ninety is corny
Bringing something for them people wanting a switch up
Switch up, shit bruh, always being a sick cunt
There's a fat slut
Punch her mouth now her teeth look like fat chub
Grab the-grab the handbag, only had loose change
Tic-tac, dollar coin and a bit of food, mate
Too-too-too late, still up in my shit though
You got the wrong idea if you pictured a disco

I'm so drunk that I can't stand up
So much bourbon in the glass, with the joints rolled up
Now I'm running through your club with my dick in hand
Never ever gave a fuck, never know to give a damn

Oi, can I have your number?
Nah, fuck off
Fuck off, you look like a pelican anyway

On a train with a chainsaw, tell me that I ain't raw
Walking barefoot, 
twelve at night
 through 
Claymore
Fuck, fuck, fuck em, fuck em
Fuck em all, shut the front, I want a breast pic
Top-topless no nonsense 
Pull your pipes out and get the motherfucking rocks li-li-lit
What if they never ever give it up
Come on bruh, you really think I give a fuck
I'm the realest rapper holding the mic
My other personality even told me I'm right
Get them hands up
Too fucking drunk, can't even stand up
I'm the man, bruh, you're a fan, ah
Just admit you're a fan of the man, nah
Something wrong? It's-it's-it's-it's all good though
Ain't say my name 'cause you motherfuckin' should know

Dreams will last forever more
I want to go to a place where dreams will last forever
Dreams will last forever more

Massive blunt rolled, I'm about to light it up
Just let me be the highest one
I don't listen to no wack shit
She in bikinis doin' backflips
In the presence of a king, high
They get excited shit it's hard for them to think right
I'm on my live life, jet ski with the fridge type
Matching Gucci shit I ain't never leaving this life
Style anyways
Swag I'm running million leaps and bounds from an alley way
Where I started or that bridge that crossed the M-5
That's Campbelltown learn about it I'm the test, I
Proved it could be done with every thing up in your way
If you can't respect that, man come on, you're stuck in hate
They tried to drag my name through the mud, it didn't work
I was warned that's what they do when you be sitting first, it's Kers

I want to go to a place where dreams will last forever
Dreams will last forever more
I want to go to a place where dreams will last forever
Dreams will last forever more

I broke records, are they ever going to bring that up?
Sitting with like fifty cunts
I don't even know you
Who let you in my showroom?
The purple mixed and
Now I'm on a mission, lay down competition
Effortless, I'm winning, ain't care 'bout what they thinking
My jewellery has 'em blinking, I'm living in a weekend
Which proves I'm winning and I'm living how I'm supposed to
Joints are different when you light 'em down the coast, true
It's my rap dream, that shit be my energiser
I'm still spending money I made off The Nebulizer
What the point in dreaming when your dream is your life?
Still paranoid, if you search my jeans, you'll find a knife
But we staying positive
I'm party and I knock some shit
I still got that side in me that I have with my three lines
That battle shit will die in me, it's Kers you want to be like
You're jealous hurt, they want me dead in the dirt
Let me chill for a second, who said second? I'm first
It's Kers

I want to go to a place where dreams will last forever
Dreams will last forever more (I'm making dreams last)
I want to go to a place where dreams will last forever (That 225 shit)
Dreams will last forever more
I want to go to a place where dreams will last forever
Dreams will last forever more
I want to go to a place where dreams will last forever
Dreams will last forever more
Dreams will last forever more",https://genius.com/Kerser-dreams-last-lyrics
Early Mornin,,2015,"They talking about skill, let me drop it on the head
They talking about pills, let me pop em till im dead
I'm the curse of the shit that means words that i writ, now take you back in time to my earliest shit
When i drop my mixtape yeah they try to ignore
When they cop the shit it's great now they try to applause
I ain't here for you to dick ride, cos I spit the sick rhymes
See my in my clique light up getting rich
I won't stop till I'm claiming it all
I've be warned its gonna hurt, will I remain in this form?
Stand in the depths not a chance of it yet not yet man or ever imma dance till the death
I'm the man with the shit but im loosing my brain
10 years strong only the truest remain
Oh you need a couple facts? Check the charts when my shit drops!
I'm doing this for us, thats a trust - FUCK HIP-HOP!
 x2
Cos I'm up till the early morning
Writing these rhymes same day I record them
Need a brake that's what they keep telling me
Still the same Kers looking for a felony

You say I changed like way to much
I haven't changed once so wait you cunt
I mean I got a lot fresher when I got a fucking cash flow
That's no joke, blow smoke watch the ash, though
This is my whip yeah I bought it out-right
They used to say I was broke yeah now try!
Mother fucker I can hustle my shit
Snowy mountains if I cum on your tits
Let me get into the shit no-one do it like me
That's why you so damn attached it's the truth when I speak
An you watch me rise up, climb up and ride up
Thanking my fans every track I'm your life brah
Cos I'm here I ain't ever going no where
But if they get me killing me back man you better swear
I ain't scared I'm prepared for the future
So many haters, lets see if they shoot brah

Still the same Kers looking for a felony

We ain't ever gonna leave, we ain't leaving
This is spare time crush your chest you breathing
I ain't wanna hear all the shit they talk 'bout
Room full of rappers? Then fuck it man I'm walking out
I ain't wanna hear about your next CD
Unless I'm riding with you, otherwise leave me
I'm in my own zone standing on the top of shit
Once a month for 4 years I've been dropping hits
That includes albums every year too
Fuck a hater I can see shit with a clear view
An they told me chill why you always angry man
Cos you hated now you back here as a fucking fan
What am I meant to do welcome you back
You doubted at first I should belt you for that
Only joking man a fan is a fucking fan
Support me I got you I'm the fucking man (im the fucking man x4)

Looking back shit, I was lookin' like a customer
You ever seen a motherfucker with the blunt lit
Inhale in that shit and puff it all out in the one hit?
I'm on my dumb shit
Make ya bitch front flip
Make it so from every single view I can see her cunt lips
It's some cunt sick shit, I mean the sick cunt
It's some bump bitch
Try it you might lift up
Gunsta want me for the Instajams on Instagram
I said it's free for you but if they ask it's fifty grand
My net worth tripled since the time I dropped Next Step
I was gonna save that line and it for Deadset
Another property I'm 'bout to put a down payment
Fuck this era it ain't cool to be a clout chaser
On fire then these people try to crucify ya
You couldn't get five stars if you were Uber driver
Sloppy toppy bitch really tried to use saliva
Had her going down wet like a scuba diver
Now my throwaways better than their new songs
Double two five get you shot for a coupon
Faggots

Exceptional,Lifestyle,2018,"Oi cunt, I'm about to bring that real shit back
Shit's turned into a fashion show
They been missing and I been busy

I been busy on the hustle, it's the same drill
A rush of blood, my music feelin' like cocaine feels
They want the technical rhymes, I'm like ""fuck that""
I used to have a stash pot in the bottom of my bum bag
Listen cunt, I can break a flow miraculous
I came in an era when it wasn't 'bout the fashion bitch
'Round the time when you really fuckin' had to spit
I battle cunts and my mates would wanna stab 'em, shit
Moments later, I'm a star, pop up everywhere
The sickest cunt and I never needed Medicare
They thought I left, I'm thinkin', I ain't going anywhere
She had a grudge, smash the box, I was getting square
What we doin' with the game, where I take it now?
Steer 'em off a cliff if they try to take the crown
People ask how I make my drink change colour
Two-two-five, I still represent the same numbers

Leave this to professionals
Self made, self paid, I'm exceptional
What you know about the rappin' game?
I used to battle for a tenner in the alleyway
Then I hit the big time
Like, shit, stack it up, we gon' live life
What you know about the rappin' game?
Everybody stop and listen when I'm rappin' mane

No certificate for school, I'm a dropout
First you see the car, then the diamonds when I hop out
I'm in the club, smokin' up, I let my chain hang
They see me and they attempt to do the same thing
Rollin' spliffs in Ubers, travellin' through the CBD
Getting head off bitches, watchin' my old DVDs
I'ma hit it up, you know me as the sickest cunt
My pack of smokes ain't got no ciggies, just filled up with fifty blunts
Ain’t no pressure when you're Kerser, I'm on top of shit
A clumsy cunt 'cause I'm always fuckin' droppin' hits
Let me walk you through the steps of meditation
Preparation and then retaliation
Bitch, I’m still reppin' what I claim
No matter where I hang, it's embroidered in my brain
Baked as and I’m sitting in my house ripped
New teeth, I put my money where my mouth is

Leave this to professionals
Self made, self paid, I'm exceptional
What you know about the rappin' game?
I used to battle for a tenner in the alleyway
Then I hit the big time
Like, shit, stack it up, we gon' live life
What you know about the rappin' game?
Everybody stop and listen when I'm rappin' mane

Sick of brag rap, shit I got mad raps
Swag rap, fat rap, repellent to your back chap
I'ma have this playing in the ghetto
Or anybody with a mission just to get dough
Know the name, it's the Kerser, the shit
You got a spliff? This the one, you can burn it to this
The sickest spit on the track and I'm pumpin' my old shit
Thinking to myself, ""Well, no wonder it sold big""

Eyes on Bigger Prize,Lifestyle,2019,"Walkin' out the smoke, you shoulda seen me through the haze
It’s a man who drop an album, put the scene into a craze
Took the scenic route for days, I was tired of the trenches
Extensions on my house so I could charge more when I rent it
I put my eyes on bigger prize, my music sittin' in its prime
My album sales proof that they all listen when I rhyme
Yeah, I glisten and I shine, best position in my life
Forever on the rise till I go missin' in the sky
Forwards on my Rolly, change the day and change the date
Backwards, change the day, but the date’ll stay the same
Subject matter different, Kerser never been a stupid cunt
Friends before the hitters, they don't like me just for music bruz
They know I keep my word and I ain't never been a troublemaker
I ain't talkin' wrestling, you'll be meetin' with an undertaker
Noises on my phone got me feelin' like a dealer pumpin’
Hoppin’ out my car smellin' like half a mill’ or somethin'

I'm the man and I'm standin’ on my own two
Two-two-five, ABK, we're our own crew
City lights in the state, it's a different life
Earnin' big, the real hustle of this friggin' mic
Ever had a meetin' talkin' 'bout a partner deal?
I walked out, don't insult me with your half a mill'
I'm on a level and I'm feelin' like I'm comfortable
It's the Kers, you know that, but who the fuck are you?

Keep it at a hundred, don't you know we rockin' ABK?
I ain't need to help the scene I done it when I paved the way
All the music, call it motivation for some profit
Inspiration for the younger rappers, time to stack your wallet
I'm a different kind of breed from Campbelltown when it was Campbell-Town
Only rock it if brand new, I used to rock the hand-me-downs
Fuckin' slicin' rap way before you even saw a mic
Rappin' all these years and I ain't never had to force a line
A special kind of excellence and that's why I'm your preference
Used to put my pills in the same tin as my peppermints
I'm stayin' at the front and I'm aware that it's a crazy place
Said she can't say no to me, she blame it on my babyface
They talk about their goals and I just sit there like, ""That's lookin' great""
I didn't bust a sweat and put 10K up for a footy game
When I hit the stage you can tell that I'm a superstar
The clothes I'm rockin', they look like I got 'em from the future, brah

I'm the man and I'm standin' on my own two
Two-two-five, ABK, we're our own crew
City lights in the state, it's a different life
Earnin' big, the real hustle of this friggin' mic
Ever had a meetin' talkin' 'bout a partner deal?
I walked out, don't insult me with your half a mill'
I'm on a level and I'm feelin' like I'm comfortable
It's the Kers, you know that, but who the fuck are you?

Classic after classic, up and bump 'em, get 'em out the way
Red and blue seepin' through my car and it ain't POWERADE
Fuck off, I'm a rapper, everything I got, I really own
Poppin' pingers in your state and I feel at home
Hit another state, get a cheque and then I fly home
Everything I got from what I write down on my iPhone
Before that I had the paper with a Bic pen
Check the stats, I was even writin' hits then
Drivin' fast, switchin' cars 'cause I'm bored of one
Was gonna sell one, I think I'll give my daughter one
I'm a seasoned vet, true, I'm an animal
Of course I am the king, man, I'm only thinkin' rational
Press the issue then you're gonna cop a backlash
Twenty K stacks if I'm walkin' with a backpack
That's cool, now they're sayin' I'm an OG
And only lookin' 23, man, I'm so clean

I'm the man and I'm standin' on my own two
Two-two-five, ABK, we're our own crew
City lights in the state, it's a different life
Earnin' big, the real hustle of this friggin' mic
Ever had a meetin' talkin' 'bout a partner deal?

Falling,Roll the Dice,2020,"Falling, fading
Down, down, down I go
Falling, fading
Down, down, down
Down I go

Never me, I ain't falling, you wish
I had the country all against me, what a story it is
I've gone to war for the shit, still see it all as a gift
'Cause if it wasn't for this, I'd still be poor as a bitch
And I know, if I fall, I come back and get more
You couldn't come up in my area, get macheted and mauled
And what a trip, the shit changed and they lookin' at me strange
I get money out the game but I'm still fucked from the fame
I've had motherfuckers tell me that's an even exchange
But for me to call it even, gotta live in my brain
So what you want from me, you want the bars or the deep shit?
Wanna hear another twenty rappers on my remix?
Handled all the backlash, came in as a smashed lad
Started from the bottom to the top, I'll never backtrack
I couldn't fall from the bottom
And if I fall from the top, just know I'm fallin' right on 'em
I got 'em

Falling, fading
Down, down, down I go
Falling, fading
Down, down, down
Down I go

Never me, I'll never slip on my mission
I gotta trip at the difference that the listeners picture
'Cause they probably spinnin' out on the shit
Like ""How the fuck you still buzzin', doin' albums like this?""
Too many tools to remember, worked too hard for this shit
Just to lay my tracks down, I'd almost starve for a week
Never harmed from a beef, I kept my art in the street
Until it hit your fuckin' radar, spilled my heart on a beat
Never lost where we're at, they had me watchin' my back
I said I want them all dead before they got to attack
Now, have you got my back forever like you say that you do?
Or do you see me as a way to somehow make it for you?
I need a break from the news, I need a break from the views
I need a break from anything that's got a musical tune
Never fallin' and fadin' but I'm scorin' 'em faded
When they saw that I made it, I had like all of them hatin'
They slowly

Down, down, down I go
Falling, fading
Down, down, down
Down I go",https://genius.com/Kerser-falling-lyrics
Famous,YouTube Promotion Tracks,2014,"Seem my dreams won't go away
So it's more like a nightmare
Keeping me up all night
Like a nightmare
It's taking over my mind
My desire
Burns inside, like a flame
And it can't and it won't be contained
'Cos I gotta be... famous

You don't really want the fame though
You don't really want the fame no!

They heard a shot fired
Another shot fired
You driving in a race, spinning with a popped tire
And you've been pushed by the radios element
I'm the first fucking rapper to make the radio irrelevant
Fuck the mainstream, I don't need a handout
There's something about the aura of the Kers because I stand out
4 cunts cruising high in a range rover
Yelling ABK, tell these rappers game over!
I've been working, probably find me in the studio
At the top, and my whole fucking crew can flow
The proof is there, we the team at the top
I'm a sniper with the raps so you  to pop
I've been killing shit for years
You know spitting insane raps
From a town where cunts are on the rocks like the train tracks
If time moves quick, shouldn't life try to keep up
Instead of being slaves to the system you in deep fuck

You don't really want the fame though
You don't really want the fame no!

And here's a picture with words look
He at high school, he started year 10
Things a little different this year, he don't fear them
Peer pressure play a part, started seshin' in the park
Girls undressing him to fuck, introduce him to the glass
And shit he going down hill
Last night he had a puff and some brown pills
Everything in life has gottin' him feelin' irrelevant
It's fucking with his mind and yet his brain is not developed yet
This the story of the victim
Of the suburb, and it's sad 'cos I can pick from them
Meet 'em all the time, kinda crazy with the crime
Got them play with my mind, 'cos they keep saying my rhymes (It's King Kerser)
But it's not want it's is
Like a shoulda started different with a positive twist
And they say I'm saving lives, I'm just giving you mine
And in the process, hopin' somehow you can live through my rhymes - The King

You don't really want the fame though
You don't really want the fame no!

And if I ever get knocked, there'll be riots the next day
The Nebulizer caused commotions as soon as they pressed play
Buds in the sadie, got some raps for the next night
With a fucking xani so I'm sleeping on the next flight
It's fucking crazy, I'm your everyday cunt
But there's something special 'bout me
I'm a legend, what's up? Shit
There's that arrogance they tell me they hate that
The rawest rapper on my level, cannot debate that
Somebody said I fluked it, I'm fluking what?
The 10 year of blood and sweat? I never choose to stop
I was rocking gigs with my mates in the crowd
Broke as fuck, on the train. I had to make it, but how?
'Cos these labels didn't want it, I'm too raw for the air
I made it to the top, now they scratching their heads
Wait.. How'd it happen? I'm a weapon in my own right
You can be inspired, do your thing but don't bite
It's Kers 1

You don't really want the fame though
You don't really want the fame no!

Me and Nebs have that new album cooking
Ready November 7th
Ready to fucking shit up again
Taking over the game
And um... we out",https://genius.com/Kerser-famous-lyrics
Fantastic,King,2014,"Fantastic- Kerser

Started off run away from a cop car
Now they consider me a rock star
I mean rap star someone gotta gat brah
Kill another rapper then kill a racker
Red hot when I drop my stuff
Hit 16 coppas tryin to lock me up
They won’t leave me alon imma cruise the ocean
Used to be broke till I mixed my potion
I rap with the look the skill and all
Sometimes my brain wants to kill it all
I had a case meet the cops
No cops wanna watch what i do
How i move while I’m with my crew
Tell em when you got money you got shit to do
Said she wanna fuck I’d rather piss on you
I got my respect you check on that
You lucky us cunts even let you rap
My bars made a Russ you learn from us
Biting Nebulizer you nervous fuck
So imma lift this shit to another bar
And don’t pop ya Nebs best ill fuck ya scar
Ya face and ya neck and ya arms attached
Ya racing to get ya little army lab
Then gone get got red hot hit gun shot
Writing out truth and it only got one plot
Fuck off with the future essence
And it’s weird, cause we steal the presents
What am I? I’m a fucking king
You a queen then suck it in
Dress good always looking fresh
Sex looks for me, I don’t look for sex
I’m a god imma king I run this shit
You couldn’t rate me with a number bitch, King!

Always high off my gut almost half asleep
I ain't ever give a fuck come and ask for me
Puffing joints sipping lean eating xaney’s too
Fucking oink you a pig fuck you attitude
We still run this rap shit
My crew kill you that's it
Never feeling better than I’m feeling it’s fantastic
We still run this rap shit
My crew kill you that's it
Never feeling better than I’m feeling it’s fantastic
Imma star imma king imma type of god
In the spa with your bitch and she ride the cock
Puffing joints sipping lean eating xaney’s too
Fucking oink you a pig fuck your attitude

Had enough of the talk owe you all that
Send my boys take ya shit where ya score at
I ain't wanna be nothing like the rest
And I don’t chill with nothing but the best
It’s so simple ABK
Run hip hop now till I age away
And once i age away I'll make major pay
Off other new rappers cause I pave the way
My crew are raw, abuse the law, I’m using more
(Mad drugs today)
The future lord, I’m moving more, more unit store
(That’s fucking pay)
I set the path, I let you laugh, Came extra hard
(Now they love me)
I read my bars, now weapon scars, I’m esh and barred
(Now they love me)
Turn a hater to a fan in a matter of seconds
Turn a hater to a hoe with a couple of weapons
Imma beast bow down yo praise the king
Back and forth yo graze your knee
Ain't no one done what me and Nebs did
Fans prove that cause they collect it
Always street kicking in the mansion
I’m posting pics of your bitch like Hanson, King!

Always high off my gut almost half asleep
I ain't ever give a fuck come and ask for me
Puffing joints sipping lean eating xaney’s too
Fucking oink you a pig fuck you attitude
We still run this rap shit

Feelin Like,King,2014,"Ay yo NEBS
I'm glad we saved this one for last brother
Yo
Look

Sometimes I wanna get a shot gun, close range
Ending it all fuck I hope there ain't no pain
Then my families fucked and all messed up
Is this depression or the lesson that the drugs fuck?
I've been hitting shit since I hit 13
Whatever we could get pop a roofie if its dirt cheap
Then I made it in rap ain't that your dream bro?
When you picture it its nothing what it seems though
Constant threats so I'm buying guns
With the shit I spend on that I should supply my mum
A new car or somethin' I threw stacks at Rates
We both the same so that went to waste
I got a massive house and a luxury car
My girl screaming at me I don't know who you are
No excuse but the fame and the drug mix
With the cash turned me into to a fuck wit
I'm sorry

I don't wanna live my life no more
I ain't wanna be a victim of the shoot out wall
I ain't wanna be known as a tripped out lost cunt
Got my freedom but it's feeling like I'm locked up
I don't wanna live my life no more
I ain't wanna be a victim of the shoot out wall
I ain't wanna be known as a tripped out lost cunt
Got my freedom but it's feeling like I'm locked up

I got what I want, why the fuck I feel this?
It ain't Kers if I ain't spit the real shit
I've seen the bitter shit that's why I give you bad stares
I try and block but the memories are trapped there
Got money coming trust me that ain't bring happiness
Tell that Pharrell that fuckin' song is a batch of shit
Growing up kids were searching through a clothing bin
I see 'em lately and they say waddup they don't don't whinge
I'm just gonna fuckin' spill my heart
Hate me or love me I've been real from the start
What you know about a mate almost comatose?
I need you here and I'm worried you will overdose
Cos you the back bone to this shit you're gonna need help
Who am I to talk? I'm sleeping with a seat belt
As a pillow in the passenger seat
Fell asleep halfway through I was having a feed
I need help

I don't wanna live my life no more
I ain't wanna be a victim of the shoot out wall
I ain't wanna be known as a tripped out lost cunt
Got my freedom but it's feeling like I'm locked up
I don't wanna live my life no more
I ain't wanna be a victim of the shoot out wall
I ain't wanna be known as a tripped out lost cunt
Got my freedom but it's feeling like I'm locked up

I hadn't seen a mate for a couple of months
I seen him and it hurt he was fucking it up
And it broke my heart more cos his bro was on the pipe too
The same kid that looked up to us at high school
I said I wanna chat and fix the prob
One ear out the other can I speak to God?
If you listenin' help in some way or form
It's like holding aerials on planes in storms
Someone's gettin' struck every bodies running mucks
Ice will make your best friend wanna fuck you up
The tabs I've popped probably killing my liver
Pain stops sprite so my body don't shiver
I need guidance I ain't gonna hide shit
I hope what I'm saying don't lead to violence
I had enough of that coppers tryna lock me up
Fuck 'em Imma make my music and pop my drugs

I don't wanna live my life no more
I ain't wanna be a victim of the shoot out wall
I ain't wanna be known as a tripped out lost cunt
Got my freedom but it's feeling like I'm locked up
I don't wanna live my life no more
I ain't wanna be a victim of the shoot out wall
I ain't wanna be known as a tripped out lost cunt
Got my freedom but it's feeling like I'm locked up

And whatever I said in this track
It isn't meant to bring you down
You need to find the positive in it
We as a society need help
This is just what I see
Imma march on
Stand tall

What you claim, your neck of woods?
I don't claim some tax in a separate book (Book)
Walkin' 'round, Versace robe
You hardly know how hard we go (Nup)
I'm puffin' on a fat joint
Nothin' but a hit when I rap, boy
My girl's shoes worth more than your wage
I kinda understand it when you hate (I get it)
Off my head like every day
In my head, I might medicate
Got so high, I nearly meditate
Too smooth with this, let me demonstrate
Had the whole scene like, ""What the fuck?""
I held the ball, never dropped it once (Never)
'Member me at the start of this?
So chap and poor you'd laugh at this? (Yep)
What happened then? That Kers effect
Had a bitch give me head till it hurt her neck (Ahh)
Still in my lane, still in the game
Still the most hype when they mention my name
Whole 'nother sound we bought to Oz
Just did it again, don't talk to us (Never)
Hear 'em all talk how they stack the pay
Don't act your age, just rap your wage (Be honest)
Droppin' all these bombs, bitch
Every single song I drop is
Straight telling you I'm God's gift
Motivation, got that locked, bitch (Fact)

The shit I'm on, yeah, it feels so good
The liquor pourin', yeah, it feels so good
The money flowin', yeah, it feels so good
My whip is foreign, yeah, it feels so good

Switch me up that beat, please
Turn to reverse and repeat these
Just for a few more bars so
So I can hit them with that hard flow
Scan your shit on a barcode
More like pay in cash for a car, bro
Difference there, always levelin' up
Why you talkin' 'bout how you peddlin' drugs?
I got a few cunts that will sneak up (Shit)
Broad daylight makin' you leak blood (Ugh)
What I'd rather do is mix my lean
In my Mercedes-Benz, goin' sixty-three (Skrrt)
Feels so good that the money flow
I can tell by the look she wanna fuck me, though (It's true)
But that's just me, accept the fact (Facts)
Blew on her ass 'cause I respect the back (I do)
Pour the drinks and then light me up
Rap smooth in the booth, I'm nice as fuck (Ha)
No competition, it stayed away
I've seen every wave, they all fade away (Yeah)
Catch me out in different cars
I'm sippin' on some different stuff (What's that?)
Two-two-five, yeah, that the crew
Try say that every track I do (I try to)
Hardest choice in Kerser's day
Is if I should drive the Merc' or Range (Hmm)
Bad bitch now, got her titties out
And I ain't even ask, I'm just sittin' down
Feel the presence, my vibe the best
I smell like weed, let me light a sesh
Feel so good, this scene a dream
Underground king, makin' my money machine

The shit I'm on, yeah, it feels so good
The liquor pourin', yeah, it feels so good
The money flowin', yeah, it feels so good
My whip is foreign, yeah, it feels so good

Fight On,Tradition,2016,"Fuck it, where do I start?
Do I make a remark about my life in the dark?
And all the shit they don't know, like I'm a fucking addict
Tragic that it worked out this way, had it happened any other way, I would've spat it
But I'm just laying around
Vision blurry, I'm not happy, 'nother pill, if not
They carry me to hospitals and have feeling like a fucking junkie
But they ain't been through what I've been through, how the fuck they judge me?
Plus I'm only on the downers, is what I tell myself
Like, the highs was any lower, I should belt myself
And all this time I've been working with rap
I don't talk to many people cos they circles of rats, fuck
Lose my mind when I think into shit
And every pill that I pop, memories sink and dismiss
Whats the difference I spit like there's a gun to my head
Leave my life in the booth feels like a struggle for breath

Gotta fight on ain't no way to beat me
Feel like I'm locked away somebody gotta free me
I'm just looking out the ocean as the waves break
And back at me and Boobz were eating off the same plate
We had a dream you told me man you gotta chase that
In Australia you know I came and saved rap
To where I was then to where I am now
It's a miracle 'cause rapping like my pen pal

Keep yourself together, will the fans ever dismember?
I fluke around my clever no one's snooping through what better
That's my confidence boost after popping a few
At least I'm honest to you but fuck a promise I'm through what?
Is that letting them down?
After six albums in they can't question the crown
And it's crazy that I'm still at the front
I was popping a hundred and eighty six Xanax a month
And that was six a day now I'm currently confused
Come on, take it back tell me what was the wrong move
People ask me if I've beaten it yet
Cause I've had heaps of fucking help is there a reason to stress?
Trying to get my teenage years like they never left
But they gone fucking Scott get it through your head
Maybe I ain't ready for the world just yet
Gotta take a pill to handle all the success

Gotta fight on ain't no way to beat me
Feel like I'm locked away somebody gotta free me
I'm just looking out the ocean as the waves break
And back at me and Boobz were eating off the same plate
We had a dream you told me man you gotta chase that
In Australia you know I came and saved rap
To where I was then to where I am now
It's a miracle 'cause rapping like my pen pal

So I'm hitting the road and a brave face for the stage
And no one's taking my place they never hate to my face
I could've fell into bits but I'm too strong for this shit
I got a long list ticking off all of what I can get
Ain't been wrong yet shit I give you my life
And social medias a joke it's how you live in your mind
But me I'm in the real world still repping C-Town
Even though I moved and I'm living by the beach now
To my girl, Jesus Christ, how I thank you
You watched me fall, you were there, you never break, you
Helped me up when my legs fucking gave way
You was holding me in hospital the same day
I cave ways for these rappers do they understand?
It's obvious I'm rocking gold they rocking rubber bands
I'ma fight through everything I've come against
I'm a winner, thought you knew it, don't you come and test

Gotta fight on ain't no way to beat me
Feel like I'm locked away somebody gotta free me
I'm just looking out the ocean as the waves break
And back at me and Boobz were eating off the same plate
We had a dream you told me man you gotta chase that

Find The Sound,,2014,"Life's a road that you follow til its closed off
Pick a turn make a break before the roads blocked
Many follow they dont really pick their own paths
Me I'm different see they welcome me with closed arms
I just shrug 'em off, tell 'em they can have it back
It changes everything, let me tell you tragic facts
Mates treat you different, swear to god they think your changing
In your brain you stay the same and now you can't put up with fame
And once that paranoia settles in, your barely going public
Just to leave your fucking suburb need to rally up an army I mean
Hold my head high, now I got them red eyes
State to state forget about a decent sleep or bed time
I'm on my girls nerves, always on the fucking move
She thinks I changed I tell her girl you gotta trust me too
Otherwise, right in front of her eyes
She's gonna watch me fall apart got people judging my life
But fuck em

Tears come streaming down your face
When you leave something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

It's funny back in class, teachers said I'm hopeless
They said they seen potential but I lack the focus
Funny twist, I was dreaming of this
I hope they see me now compare our fucking payments and shit
Man I swear in the back of my mind, I knew it'd happen in time
And now its actually mine, so
Does that mean what I seen was another sign?
Or am I crazy and I'm searching for another rhyme
Its like there's two of me, rapping what it do to me
All I've done was keep it real, and now you see the truth in me
I ain't never mean to glorify drugs
I just told you bout my road and now the story's blown up
But I'mma ride it out, fucking oath I'm riding proud
We can go together all you gotta do is find the sound
I'm not depressed, nah that wouldn't be the right word
In the studio I leave my mark and the mic's burn

Tears come streaming down your face
When you leave something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Am I ever on your mind? Do you listen when I rhyme?
So far up, never missing a design
Cause I'm the blueprint, time yeah it moves quick
Try and fit my shoes kid, rumours never true shit
Jesus had his haters, haters let me know I made it
Crazy crazy I invade it, maybe ABK be blazing
Blazing up a green batch, me I got the weed dacked
Trying to be a man about it, shit I gotta fiend cash
I ain't used to it, that's probably why I spend it quick
Rappin' is my life I put that shit on everything
I look you in the eye if you admit that this is mine
They like to backstab like a shiv hitting my spine
I just pull it out, sharpen it and throw it back
Bullseye, hit the marker, got a flow that's fat
You could stop the beat I need to know its sinking in
My life is crazy god reminds me that I wished for this

Tears come streaming down your face
When you leave something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?",https://genius.com/Kerser-find-the-sound-lyrics
Flight Mode,Lifestyle,2019,"Wakin' up with a blunt to my face
I’m myself, man, I'm blunt to your face
Mix so much lean that it killed my vocal cord
Got an operation then I went and poured me up some more
I'm in a new car, swerving on a cliff edge
I went from crust and I turned it into big bread
Hi, I’m Kers, I'm well known, I don't sell blow
But when I answer phones it's always to a jail tone
My old mixtape bro, they missin' what was spoken then
To rap like that, shit, you'd have to have me broke again
And that's not happenin', my style influenced you rappers
Then that’s a fact again, I’m miles in the future, snappin'
I’m sparkin' on a blunt again (Sparkin' on a blunt again)
Shit, that's me bein’ blunt again
And today I met the sickest cunt
Yeah I was lookin' in the mirror, but

Fall down and my mind is on flight mode
Facin' struggles everyday, gotta fight, bro
I could be livin' different, wishin' for a ride home
Kers One, guarantee I won't die broke
Fall down, you gettin' up, it's a part of life
And you're connected through the music, you a part of mine
Everyday wakin' up like, ""I made it""
I let it flow in God's hands, I won't change shit

I think if any rapper had the pressure I had
They would've quit and their buzz would've died bad
My bad, back when you thought I was fried, lad
I was makin' moves that went and set me up for life, mad
Then I seen the game of this
I had some lows, was really gonna blow my brain to bits
Tryna' get off Xannies, I was screamin' out for help
Tried to hide it with ""
Bad Habits
"", did the writin' help? Well
Months later, I was checkin' into rehab
Met some fans in there, they were like, ""I thought you're clean lad""
I just looked at them like, ""Yeah"" and I shrug my shoulders
Every minute of withdrawal's gettin' fuckin' colder
Had the scene blamin' me like, ""You spread the Xans""
It went from that to, ""Come on Kerser, we went ten for ten""
And I am meant to be the one who shows respect to them?
That's half the reason with the scene, I start neglectin' them

Fall down and my mind is on flight mode
Facin' struggles everyday, gotta fight bro
I could be livin' different, wishin' for a ride home
Kers One, guarantee I won't die broke
Fall down, you gettin' up, it's a part of life
And you're connected through the music, you a part of mine
Everyday wakin' up like ""I made it""
I let it flow in God's hands, I won't change shit",https://genius.com/Kerser-flight-mode-lyrics
Flyin' in the Whirlwind,Lifestyle,2019,"I'm starin' into space, they like, ""You gotta move, Scot""
The motivation's hard to find when my whole crew's locked
Ratesy, too, while it hurts when your bro falls
And free Sammy till they free him from the closed walls
Anxiety attacks, I can't try to relax
Put a vest back-to-front 'cause the knives in my back
Trust is hard to earn from me
I barely trust anyone
I seen the change from being broke when I was twenty-one
I kept it movin' man, I feel I've told you this before
I see it different now, guess you hearin' different thoughts
From my mind, that's a trip when you break it down
Mix the drugs with the thugs in a crazy town
What the outcome? It ain't that hard to work out
Sippin' lean makes it hard to spit the words out
I'm just tryna paint a picture with my vocab
And put your mind inside of mine, you see I'm so smashed

God give us time, 'cause I'm flyin' in the whirlwind
Wonderin' what's for me when the world ends
Bright lights, fast cars, this my life now
My brain on, but they sayin' that the light's out
God give us time, 'cause I'm flyin' in the whirlwind
Wonderin' what's for me when the world ends
Bright lights, fast cars, this my life now
My brain on, but they sayin' that the light's out

I'm in my car again, off my head on medicine
You're askin' me? I ask myself if it will ever end
I take the blame and blame the fame at the same time
I didn't realise just how much it can change life
And I ain't whingin' 'cause the dollars help it weigh-out
I'm just givin' you perspective with a blade out
That's when it burst and it feelin' like a sudden rush
I'm seein' red, all I want to do it cut a cunt
They mark my name so I guess it never dirt clean
Remember Sero stabbed a cunt when he was thirteen
Don't you talk about my crew way before the fame
You wouldn't know, that's why we die over ABK
If this the bible then I'm writin' down a scripture
And make a fan out of every single listener
Once a Kers fan, guarantee a fan forever
Funny how it took a jail visit to get the fam' together

God give us time, 'cause I'm flyin' in the whirlwind
Wonderin' what's for me when the world ends
Bright lights, fast cars, this my life now
My brain on, but they sayin' that the light's out
God give us time, 'cause I'm flyin' in the whirlwind
Wonderin' what's for me when the world ends
Bright lights, fast cars, this my life now
My brain on, but they sayin' that the light's out

Thought we had it all till I seen my brothers fall
And it's feelin' like ""No Rest"" again, we've done it all
Depression and anxiety, most hide quietly, others act violently
I do 'em all, a sight to see
Gave my life to rap, I really sacrificed it all
Was on tour so I missed it when my daughter crawled
I'm fucked up and I hate public places
The sacrifice I made engraved me as the greatest

God give us time, 'cause I'm flyin' in the whirlwind
Wonderin' what's for me when the world ends
Bright lights, fast cars, this my life now
My brain on, but they sayin' that the light's out
God give us time, 'cause I'm flyin' in the whirlwind
Wonderin' what's for me when the world ends
Bright lights, fast cars, this my life now
My brain on, but they sayin' that the light's out",https://genius.com/Kerser-flyin-in-the-whirlwind-lyrics

They all the same they just lame with their bullshit
It's kinda sad cause you trust 'em but they drool shit
Enough to make me wanna fucking turn my mic off
And go back to being poor at 16 and never write songs
Cause back then I ain't have all these eyes judging
I was hanging on the street, getting searched for nothing
And they spin out cause I'm on a track like ""Fuck 'em""
Like I will forget my past and what they did? Nah ain't like none of 'em
Fuck the 5-0,
 
I'm lighting hydro
You can tell me about the bisso but what I know
Cause on the street there ain't none of this industry
Until I brang it to the industry like this is me
Respect me for that, it's all I really ask for
And we be getting raided by a fucking task force
For years now they went and locked my mates up
My money clean but they still won't go away fuck!

Make cash when I had a new plan
Kids looking up to me, what the fuck am I meant to say?
Its not as hard as it was for me
They shut the door but I kicked it in, I come for more
They knock you down you won't get help
Rise to the top tell 'em fuck yourself
Cause they gonna hate you when you poor as shit
They look, they laugh, ignore your shit
And you gonna feel down you'll wanna quit
But you gotta fucking fight if you want the shit
And you're at the top its not as sick as you pictured it what's wrong with This
Why people turn my mates have changed
Why you thinking shit would stay the same
Stupid man I'm trying to guide the next Kerser
But Imma tryna hide from all the shit that comes with rap
Back on the street with a baggy dacked
Cause the fame ain't sunk in yet (the fame ain't sunk in yet)
In a brand new car I think the fame has fucked my head
But gotta keep control and run this shit
100k another 100 flip
Ever doubt me you can suck my dick
I ain't even know what a budget is
Fuck the scene, have your hip-hop
Skitsing out you got me pissed off
Ain't no love my heart is switched off

Fresh Air,YouTube Promotion Tracks,2013,"How we fuckin' got here yeah they see it as a miracle
They tried to stop the movement
But my hands stayed on the steering wheel
I’m too strong and the message that my raps send
Can stop your mate from suicide
And hold your world from collapsing
Good mates can turn against you on the fuckin' streets
Especially once you get shined for rhymin' over fuckin' beats
Most the scene are just fake, others are a bunch of geeks
Controlled by what their told to do
On strings like they some puppets, shit
Then you come to me, you found a breath of fresh air
In a fresh pair, bunch of haters tryna get square
They can get got, probably gonna get shot
If they make it personal and say they gonna get Scott
Got stabbed for acting hard over a 
bud size
From then in life I realized there’s no point in being up-tight
We was young then, think we just hit puberty
If you think I’m dumb you blaming me I blame the truancy
So what's a true emcee? Talkin' bout the rainbows
How they writing really dope they softer then some play dough
That’s why I watch you rap, to my crew it's a laughing stock
You think this shit is fake I fuckin' beg your pardon gronk
What happened to the love? Guess is slowly changed to hate
While I made it out the rut,
 now it’s time to grab my mates
Will we live to see a better day? I suppose you never know
My worst mistake was lettin' people know that I be getting dough
I just had to brag, 'cause I fuckin' proved them wrong
You feel the goose bumps risin', you ain't never heard a truer song
You want a piece of puddin' but I spat in the cake
You see real when you look at me like the tats on my face
And then everyone's sketchin' over metal detectors
Got em dacked, its my show so they let em in, get ya
Back to the facts that we livin' it raw
Middle fingers to the haters this beginnin' of more
More raps, more shows, more tracks, more dough
More cash, more flows, more hash, more smoke
I’m sticking to the music, you just me do my thing
If its win or loose, you fucking had to knew I win
Now I’m moving in to grounds they said I'd never touch
They ask me how to make it, I just say its effort bruz
There’s something real about me, separates me from the others
Half our shows on stage I swear to god we spot the under-covers
I throw my finger up then I pump 
Unwritten Letter
Kinda crazy every song that I be getting better
The new albums coming so so fat
Picture that if this shit was just a promo track
It's Kers One

Yeah
Me and Nebs have that album locked
So you gotta wait for that shit
October twenty-fifth
That's the new shit
That's when shit gets rearranged and restructured again

And I got a group of mates, I give my life to them
The same cunts that will pop you and do five to ten
For me, facts what I'm spitting out rap who the sickest proud
Used to love the rap, gotta say its kinda different now
It's hard out here 'til i made my tracks pop
I'm down to take photos but I fear a snap shot
On my head that's a fear that I live with

Dropping all these bombs bitch
Ask around 'cause I'm on this
Summer time my hot bitch
Wonder why you ain’t got this
Crowd jump around in the mosh pit
All bitches wanna lock lips
Town come out wanna watch this
Key to the city, I’m the locksmith
Claim to have it all, you ain’t got shit
You want what I got, but it’s Scott’s cheers
Crew got it all with the top kids
Rocking all the hot shit
Catch a glimpse at my watch, tick
Gucci hood, you can wash this
Left the hood cause I got rich
Still go back, cause I’m not bitch
In the ghetto with, Walsh shit
Purple drink we are off tits
Ain’t no one gonna stop this
Chosen one, I am god’s gift
Got famous then I got scripts
Who to blame me or doctors?
Depend what way the plot twist
Catch me out in a hot whip

Crawling ‘round cause I pop trips
Aliens they were not sick
And my engineer's like what shit

Roll with a couple shooters
Rather beat you down your crews fucked
Do the same shit every two months
Now you thinking shit this too much
Cause your legs are broken bruised up
And you’re walking 'round with two crutch, shit
Let’s leave it there, that’s too suss
Ain’t too many that can move us
I’m just giving you the truth bruz
Don’t wanna listen I got two nuts
On your girl cause I couldn’t give two fucks
If she died right now I’d boo slut
Jump in a car and cruise brah
Then send you a letter “you a loser”
Catch me out in a new car
Driving right past your Uber
Yelling out the window “you’re too smart”
Now fucking better duck cause we shoot cars
Couldn’t give a fuck if they move brah
Other rappers look like food fuck
What I meant to do? Make food of ya?
And end your career with a few bars
Speaking of that, I popped two bars
I’m always looking for a new buzz
Whether I don’t or do drugs
The answer is um move cunt
Every album I move up
Saying that you rich, you got two bucks?
Feeling kinda sick, gonna spew up
End the verse here cos I'm too fucked

We are on some shit and I don’t know if i can move right now
Looking for another rhyme, I know I'm lost in music how?

That depends on if you gonna promise that you'll buy me drugs
I enjoy it when they block out the stress
And, for the alcohol, I sip it 'cause it blocks out the rest
I've got no oxygen left, and they screaming at me ""wake up""
Ambos at my house, they ask my mates ""well, did he take drugs?""
That should draw the line, fuck that, I snort the line
Have I lost my mind? It's safe enough to say it's borderline
I think I'm giving it up-nut, I'm snipping a bud-cunt
While sniffing the dust up, I'm living life fucked up

Gonna get high today
Feeling all my troubles go away
Gonna get high today
Feeling all my troubles go away
H-I, I get high
H-I, I get high
H-I, I get high
H-I, I get high

I lost the track of days, like ""what's the date?"" I'm off my face
I'm wondering if what I say can make a kid go pop today
I gotta say, please don't look up to me, it's nothing nice
My fucking eyes look like they've been in scuffle fights and pumbled twice
But that's the lack of sleep that happens when I'm having E's
Fuck getting scattered, I call Nebs like ""let me smash a beat""
While drinking liquor with a Xanny tab, the only way
I'm ever slowing down is if the motor breaks with open flames
I'm broke again and yesterday I had a big wad
Spent it all on drugs and then I bought some kicks, bitch what
A million reasons why I'm off my head, don't question why
I'm wondering if I should even tell them why I'm getting high
The life I'm living got me tripping, sipping, got no chaser
Got no way to ever make it out of getting off my face, I
Take another one, yep, and then break another one's neck
And take the hundreds and jet and waste the money on...yep

Gonna get high today
Feeling all my troubles go away
Gonna get high today
Feeling all my troubles go away
H-I, I get high
H-I, I get high
H-I, I get high
H-I, I get high

I show my face, they know their place, I'm riding 'round with gallons
Of that manufactured slapped and battered rapping hazard magic
But, call it medicine, I'm getting off my head again
I'm mentioning, if they gon' fuck my brain, well, then I'm getting 'em
What the fuck? You think I'm sober? I don't ever think that's
Taken place. I made mistakes like lacing cakes with eights of base
So give me more of anything to give my head a buzz
The deadly drugs; I'm getting up with anything they pressing up
Stamp the pill, enhance the deal 'cause I ain't leaving gronk
Reach is long, I punch you in the face and fucking breach my bond
Tell me, I ain't living how I'm spitting, got the proof
I'm watching you, I turn you into something they call (chopped and screwed)
The lot of you are biters, biting out on what I do
I'm getting drunk and high to try and help the stress I gotta move
But that ain't working so I'm back up on my drug shit
A shot of scotch, a shot of vodka, then I got the bud-lit

Gonna get high today
Feeling all my troubles go away
Gonna get high today
Feeling all my troubles go away
H-I, I get high
H-I, I get high
H-I, I get high
H-I, I get high",https://genius.com/Kerser-gonna-get-hi-today-lyrics

Hello, we on another level
 (what-what you smoking?)
Smokin' hydro
You know me man, I smoke that good weed and
Go and get a feed, come back and smoke weed again

Choppin' up weed, I'm in the mood
My eyes stay closed, can barely move
Scissors, bowl, lighter, weed
All I need on a night like these
Morning man, same thing
All of them claymen
All of them waiting
Quarter, yep, blazing
Sit around, got a bud that's fat
Suckin' on a billy 'til my lungs collapse
Got up at ten, went to bed at six
Got up again, gotta get a stick
See to me twenty bucks, that's a gram
Chopped up, eyes red, smashed again
Hydro sticky orange hairs
I love my weed, man I'm choppin' plants
Stop it man, I got this easy
Never see me without my CP
Weed be the food that feed me
Feeds my things the things ain't eating
More shit, light the bong
Good for my brain, I might be wrong
Right, it's on, I picked a win
I'll hit you clean, no mix with spin

Ever since then, I need to use this
Never fight you by my side
I'll light tonight, it's fine all right
When I'm on other drugs, I think of you
Can't go one day without missin' you
See me and you and you and me
Who's to see what you do to me
I kick or scream when you're out of reach
Stay home, smoke cones like I'm bound to be
Smokin' and I'm never stoppin'
Stoppin'? Nah, can't be bothered
Choppin' up, my lungs be rottin'
Coughin', keep on choppin' choppin'
Stress free, yeah I'll be
I think of you, do you think of me?
You're good in cookies, good in paper
Good in bongs, I could never hate ya
I need you now, I'm glad I have ya
Please try to get along with my asthma
Either way, you're here to stay
I'll light you up 'til I pass away

Look in my eyes, I get so high every night
Every day of my life
Look in my eyes, I get so high every night
Every day of my life

Good-Bye,No Rest For The Sickest,2012,"Yeah, it was nice knowing yous all
You won't be seeing me no more
Yo, I'm gone

Outta reach and I feel like I'm gone now
I never had a clue about the right or wrong route
I fucked up but I found the success
How the fuck I do that and still be down in a mess
I'm into skitzing when I'm outta drugs, the evil inside
I'm knowing why the fuck my misses couldn't be by my side
I tuck a knife on my dacks, no one knows that it's there
Sometimes I rub it on my leg so that I know and I swear
This the paranoid street life I'm stuck in the old route
You faggots still had the hide to say that I sold out
Just cause these people know me doesn't mean that I've changed
It means that I done something different and they knowing the name
Sometimes I really wanna get away and never come back
And just run away for good and turn my back on the rap
Then I'm back on the track, and ain't nobody got an answer
They said I was the sickest 'cause the rapping is my cancer

I'm not knowing who to trust and I'm walking
I turn my back on my life it's important
That you never see me smile again
I throw away the pen again I'm guessing this is the end, I'm gone
I'm not knowing who to trust and I'm walking
I turn my back on my life it's important
That you never see me smile again
I throw away the pen again I'm guessing this is the end, I'm gone

See I gave my life to rap and it gave some cash back
Can I leave it, that's that, cause my mind is a smashed lab
Experiment that went wrong they wanna know my best song
I'm so fucking known but still feel like that I get slept on
Life is like I stepped on a landmine and leapt wrong
Then rolled into another one and now my fucking legs gone
Why they crazy viewing it, I summed it up real
I wish I had some kinda button that would help how I feel
They would never give me props cause I'm repping the street
You don't know what I've popped just to get me to sleep
It's like a never ending cycle, and it's feeling kinda vital
Now they treat me like an idol but I'm cruising with a rifle
And it's pointing at my head as I'm staring down the barrel
Fuck a one minute round, man this is what a battle
And I thank you that your listening but yo I gotta jet quick
About to lose my mind, I guess my life has got too hectic

I'm not knowing who to trust and I'm walking
I turn my back on my life it's important
That you never see me smile again
I throw away the pen again I'm guessing this is the end, I'm gone
I'm not knowing who to trust and I'm walking
I turn my back on my life it's important
That you never see me smile again
I throw away the pen again I'm guessing this is the end, I'm gone

Tell me will you be there when I really need you I'm
Feeling like I need a break, but feeling like you need me I
Never felt this way but I
Think this is my good-bye
Good-night, good-bye, good-life, good-bye
Tell me will you be there when I really need you I'm
Feeling like I need a break, but feeling like you need me I
Never felt this way but I
Think this is my good-bye
Good-night, good-bye, good-life, good-bye

I'm not knowing who to trust and I'm walking
I turn my back on my life it's important
That you never see me smile again
I throw away the pen again I'm guessing this is the end, I'm gone
I'm not knowing who to trust and I'm walking
I turn my back on my life it's important
That you never see me smile again
I throw away the pen again I'm guessing this is the end, I'm gone

Good-bye, good-bye
Make sure I get them visits man (Thanks for your support)
Put some money on the jail account (Amazing man)
You won't see Kerser no more (Fuck I don't want letters, I want to actually see you)
I've had it with this shit, I surrender
I'm going
We out, for good this time
Fuck it
And I feel like I'm gone, now",https://genius.com/Kerser-good-bye-lyrics
Got Me Thinkin,Roll the Dice,2020,"[Chorus: Calicoe & 
Kerser

Travelin' all around the world, it got me thinkin'
Like what the fuck I gotta do to buy a Lamborghini?
The city that I come from so cold
I swear on my old holes was 
If I said I had your back then I mean it
I'm official where I'm from for a reason
Heard they talkin' 'bout a ban, try fuckin' me up
But we got the word first, now they're bleedin'
 (Ayy)

I can hit the club to pop bottles
I can hit the club to fuck models
I can keep actin' like the world ain't my problem
But some shit goin' on and you can see it with the googles
My porridge was down, I needed more, see
I go  with a dollar
This nigga caught a body, went to jail for white collar
The Satan in this lobby, came to  with the numbers
From the murder, admittin' if I spit it bitch, I done it
If you touch a hundred, you can't trust your brother
It changed a bit  still don't know how to 
And bought the bitch ice, she still don't be wanna fuck you
I hit the bitch twice and watched her  in front of you
Chain for my brothers, I ain't even tryna stunt on you
Shoppin' in the hills, these cookies fit comfortable
Just had a threesome with some famous bitches at the W
Instagram fame, but she lay him in a buggle boo
Put her on a train with some cane and a couple blues
When you make a name, niggas claim they don't fuck witchu

I could hit the club to pop bottles
I could hit the club to fuck models
Got it covered girl, here, and she said ""I'm in a rush""
I ain't pack the bitch up, wouldn't let her scrape the dust
She stay, lookin' for the love, she stay, lookin' for the trust
But I never gave a fuck, I'm just lookin' for the bucks
Took my jewellery off at another prison visit
It don't need us doin' drops but they got the dogs sniffin'
What's different? Got a gun, you never shot with it
Most the time I see the crew is through a fuckin' box visit
I was chillin' in the back of the club
I got dirty looks later and got stabbed in the gut, fuck
Kept climbin', nearly killed for my spot
I ain't wanna hear you rap, you 'bout as real as your watch
I really built what I got since my ""Out Cold"" days
You get your house ran through 'cause I'm a household name
Look, I been reppin' for the team before the scene blew (Fact)
Always win, though, I swear this shit is see through
We knew I'm ill shit, ""The sickest"" my nickname
I used to double profit, puttin' pingas in my mixtape

Got the Feeling,No Rest For The Sickest,2012,"Punch your breakky bongs for this (Haha)
Way to start it, good morning!
Look and uhm...

All of them the same, they're lame, we what you look for
Crawling in my brain cocaine has got me cooked more

My brain gets you amazed I'm writing 'til my books worn
Watch me break this gate, crack the safe in the hood floor

Definitely expecting the mic to be the death of me
Writing leaving legacies, the history it's left to me

Now when you see the melody is getting severed heavily
This the sort of shit that have you jetting to your remedy

So jet, jet it off, you won't move 'cause you're soft
And my crew at the top, who are you? You're a flop

So keep it moving along, and it's true 'cause the songs
That we're doing have a flame and I prove that it's strong

Light a flame and quick I came to kick the industry it makes me sick
You're listening to crazy shit, admit that this is greatness bitch

Now wait a minute hit it with the style made to make them think
Place this shit and take it to a level, watch us make the mix

Dangerous, famous, life is what you make it
And I've turned life into something that's amazing
I'm living my dream, you sit and you scheme
Thinking how the fuck the movement its ridiculous bleed to death
Yes, fuck a death threat, deadset, not dead yet
I'm taking out the next threat, there's no threat, so get slept

Deadset they're dead wrong, decapitated head gone
Dead gone and rotten in the ashes of their dead songs
Seen enough and been around, you beefing, gonna hit the ground
Your competing with some brothers positive and leaving proud
Why these other rappers whinging like they fucking gave us help
Jealous cause they know we got it, just the cards that they were dealt

And I see through a poker face so go escape your bullshit
Just come and talk it over mate I know you hate the cool kids
Too fresh, too swag, crew rep, move back
I shack her 'til she troublesome like 2Pac (Get it?)

So move back with your new track and throw it out
Were all yes yes, and you? They don't know about
They say you go around and stick your fucking nose around
And flow to promoters at shows but no one's going out

Cut grass, pour it up, cuff us, ignore the cunts
Court has got my mates doing stretches like they warming up
So free 'em all, and let my crew represent
Movin' to get, all the loot and respect, till the death

This rapping gets me fuelled up, next second kill stuff
Living for a thrill I open minds just like a pill does
Heaps of beats that we destroy, this the key to free the boys
History we make in raps, not fake and you just heaps of toys

Heaps of toys, and they thinking that their rap is real
They're so toy, boy, put them in a happy meal
We blood brothers and bud mutlers all day
You can't touch us, you dumb fuckers walk away
So what you think bro? Off tap like the sink broke
What they gonna do when they witnessing the king flow?

So what they thinking bro? These faggots lack a rhythmic flow
Rapping but we're packing .45's so fucking let em go

Trained to kill, 80 pills, popped in Mercedes still
Watch how the haters feel, not for the lame its real
Crazy gifted with the 80s blade inflicted on your ladies face
Your misses we the AB wait they get it

Wait, wait, they get it you're with there ain't a substitute
The best, what you reckon, you got something that you love to do
Spent a lot of time to get here, yeah man it took quite a while
Doesn't happen overnight go get your rhyming style

Your rhyme styles more weeks than a calendar

You gay rappers are just reeking of lavender

They wanna battle, I won't compete with an amateur

Defeat, what you speak, have you fiending for stamina

Sydney street rap, South West where the street at
Your saying that your street, but the streets hate your speak back

You need a street map, define where the streets at
We're where the streets at, and beats make the streets clap

So talk your shit, cause you rappers are broke
Got punchlines like I'm swinging at a saddy of coke

Just know they're, packing a quote, with maximum dope
Stab your hag in the back of the throat till you collapse and ya choke (What!)

We got the feeling and the feeling is good
We never changed, that's the deal we keep it real with the hood
Kerser, Rates, NEBS is bass, you know it really is good
We got you laced off your face we know your fiending your hood
We got the feeling and the feeling is good
We never changed, that's the deal we keep it real with the hood
Kerser, Rates, NEBS is bass, you know it really is good
We got you laced off your face we know your fiending your hood

Your hood
Tell me that didn't start your day with a bang
Suns out, (good morning)
It's quarter past 7 you've already had like, 3 spliffs, (There's no rest for the sickest)
It's one of them days
Kerser, Rates, NEBS, whatup!",https://genius.com/Kerser-got-the-feeling-lyrics
Hands on the wheel,,2013,"Hands on the wheel, but they barely not/
Shit even Kers is scared of Scott/
Rolling up weed shot gun, you drive/
Just popped an E, it's no wonder why/
You staring at me, so i'm staring back/
Midnight, dark scene, only wearing black/
Walking the streets I walked at 16/
Yelling ""ABK, I'm back, did you miss me?""/
Sydney, go west of that/
Have a look around, its where the best is at/
Cunts gets killed for a twenty dollar bill/
Gun shots ring loud, everybody getting killed/
I'm just tryna stay real and stack the cash up/
Live, life fast like that's the mad stuff/
Back up, Kerser and Fortay/
Duck tape your mouth, you were told not to talk mate/


Who running this what? Public Syd blocks/
From West Syd, where cunts get shot/
Watch on the wrist goes fucking tic toc/
And your bitch will be lucky, if she sucking this cock/
New scams, moving grams/
Taking cones to the head, like I'm Gucci Mane/
Few plans to exp-and, and get the cash/
I ain't about to go out and mention that/
Any given time, I'll be with a pound/
These cunts don't rap, just queef out the mouth/
Love brings energy, hate brings drive/
Fuck all my enemies, making what's mine/
In her anal, interracial/
No beautician, but I gave the bitch a facial/
Kers and the Fort, Holdin' it down/
Hand on the wheel as I roll around/

Got bars like brah I'm an animal/
Eating other rappers, shit 'em out like a cannibal/
New clothes, new bling makes me shine lad/
The style everybody bite and I designed that/
I stay way ahead, riding in a new car/
Hit the corner watch rims spin never lose /
It's the Kers, mashed like potato/
Eyes red, off guts, do what i say hoe/
{​Fortay}​
Move when I say so, boozing the yayo/
Got me fucked up, what I do for the pay bro/
Dropping off drugs, as I cruise to a stage show/
Cock in a slut, nuts blued, then I change clothes/
Pound a smoke, while I'm counting notes/
Best pick up line, just shout 'em coke/
Take a lick, stuck thick dick, down her throat/
2 of West Syd's best, just how it goes/

High,Engraved In The Game,2017,"You didn’t have ‘em back, that was all a lie
I don’t trust no one, I'ma walk with my
Head held high everywhere I go
That’s the Kerser yo, he’s got a murderous flow
Have you heard of him bro? I don’t give a fuck
Got enough fans now, I can live it up
And you ever thought me to be one to care
I have the judge suck me off in her underwear
Came from the bottom and they copying, amazing
Same when we got ‘em and we stopped ‘em engraving
I don’t know what to with y’all
I don’t listen to the rap, I get stupid bored
Super lord, I’m a king, in fact
If I end your career, we can’t bring it back
So I’m being quite lenient, please say thank you
'Cause I got pride and my pride will break you
Ever heard of a Kers attack?
When his enemies end up in hearses act
I ain’t say too much, they call me king
If they need it sick then they call me in
That’s verse catch-up, I’m the man with this
And I speak so sick, it’s cancerous
If I ask some shit, you answer it
I’m a boss stay real, expand the shit
Came a long way, man I always say that
Gotta say that 'cause that’s a straight fact
Where I go on a land that knows me?
Everywhere I go, it’s a picture homie
Man you’re the shit, you’re the sickest bro
We pumpin’ your shit all the time and I know near
Every word to you latest, oh yeah, thanks
I appreciate it but I gotta go get high

I just got to get high
High when I wake up, high when I sleep
High every day that I’m able to breathe
I just got to get high
High when it’s midday, high when it’s night
High every day, it’s a part of my life
I just got to get high
High when I wake up, high when I sleep
High every day that I’m able to breathe
I just got to get high
High when it’s midday, high when it’s night
High every day, it’s a part of my life

What you wanna hear? An untouchable flow?
Every time I hit the mic, I’m in a confortable zone
Still puffin the 'dro, been around a while
The passion that I spit brings your frown to smiles
Seen a bit of shit, never tried to remember
Half of the shit 'cause my mind in a blender
Guess that’s the reason we all got a temper
ABK never known to surrender
I ain’t mentioning that, you don’t need to know
Put water on the seed and the weed will grow
But the seed was me and I blew up so mean
Didn’t use water, it had to be codeine
Oh me, am I off me head?
I didn’t right that shit, that’s what the doctor said
What I meant to do, just lie to you?
No way fuck me, I'm high as too
Lets get back on the track where the rappin’ is fat
And I’m smashing it lad since back of the cab
That single drive from Ingleburn
Stingy cunt wouldn’t risk a earn
I mean risk a loss, he’d make his pay
No discounts for ABK
I see fuck, man I miss the days
What you miss about them getting pissed again?
All the shitty trains, that we used to jump
I don’t know it’s weird, I just miss the stuff
And I’ve had enough of this shit right here
Chinese whispers in my left right ear
If I left right here would you show me love?
Got my middle finger up saying go get fucked
Oh the cunt, just let me fly
If you didn’t fuckin' know, I just wanna get high

I just got to get high
High when I wake up, high when I sleep
High every day that I’m able to breathe
I just got to get high
High when it’s midday, high when it’s night
High every day, it’s a part of my life
I just got to get high
High when I wake up, high when I sleep
High every day that I’m able to breathe
I just got to get high
High when it’s midday, high when it’s night

The sickest CD to come out this year
We out
Don't stop; just keep going on
Haha, Kerser
I'm your shoulder, lean upon
So come on deliver from inside
All we got is tonight that is right till first light
Is it real now?
When two people become one?
I can feel it",https://genius.com/Kerser-high-thrill-lyrics
Highest Man,,2011,"Yeah
It's Kerser
Fuck's happenin'? (nothing man, just pretty stoned)
Pack the billy
Roll a spliff
Crack the drink

I've been around, I seen the streets, I seen a lot of shit
I seen my old enemies, the cunts are on my dick
The world changed I ain't just better on mics
If we comparing me and you, I'm just better at life
I got time for my friends, fam and my fucking fans man
Cutting both your arms off, asking you to do a handstand
I'm the man damn blood spot I'm van dan in the dam bam pass you house it goes bam bam
Try me man I'm higher than the highest higher man
I'm higher then the highest of the highest highest I'll stand
Understand I stacking notes with a rubber band
Is enough to turn the K-e-r-s to an ugly man
You ain't wanna meet me when I'm freakin', peakin', tweakin'
'Bout to sneak into your parents house a lesson I'ma teach em
You ask around you ask em now I ain't afraid you bitches
Kerser is the sickest Ker-Ker-Kerser is the sickest
Who the man, I'm the man and they know this
If they say they didn't they just act like they ain't notice
Bro quick they on the edge of their seat
They can't handle when the Kerser comes to rep on the beat
I'm at the end of your street 'cause you pretendin' to be
A bad cunt 'cause you went and sold a tenner of weed?
At the center is me, I'm the electricity
What you need it when you have it, maggot come try testing me
I'm the L-M-N-O-P, I'm the A-B-C to D
I'm the E-F to the G, scrap that, I'm A to Z
I'm everything you know and need the haters probably blowin' me
The freshest with the poetry the flow with beat, you know it's me
I'm the supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
You stupid faggots battle me, you know I be the dopest
You motherfuckers go and talk about it, be the closest
You'll never find the same until one day, they try to clone this

Kerser
Shout outs to Nebs and Sarm
That's Them
Shout outs to Matt and Matik too
And keep an eye out for my debut LP
The Nebulizer
Cop that shit",https://genius.com/Kerser-highest-man-lyrics
Highest Man 2,YouTube Promotion Tracks,2014,"Yeah

Be the one to say it but they left it to me
Like ain't no one gonna speak up on the edge of your seat
And you wanna see me fail, see me fall, throw it all
But I spit so legit, under skin I make 'em crawl
Like I never knew right from wrong; fighting on
Headspace, they tell me keep on writing songs
I picked a vibe like a move wonder why it can move
Try to hide from the truth my eyes looking bruised
Cos I'm so smashed, triple what I wrote lad
Sitting 'round a bowl, big buds watching smoke grab anything in sight
I'm your medicine you died
Kerser only thing that make you ever feel alive
They look at me like ""Man you at the top, there's no stress""
I'm just cheering that my boys are on there home stretch
Always stayed loyal you can check on that
I respect the fucking crew, they respect me back
Dissing's gonna have you all depressed and bashed
And I won't give you fame I won't mention that
Loyal cunts on my team they will delete you from the scene
Ain't gonna dwell further cause you know what I mean
Rates got these rappers fucking shittin' their pants
They should thank me I tell Rates to give 'em a chance
I tell the crew ""Just chill"" and I'm only being real
They don't like most you rappers, they wanna make your blood spill
That's competitive mix with how we grow up
That's why my attitude's never giving no fucks
Rappers actin' different when in front of the mics
Kinda like fucking haters when they starting to type
Repeat what you rapped about 'Now you got no beef'
They drop their nuts and cry and you thinking 'They so street'
Everyday thoughts I'm just airing them out
You made me arrogant, here you can stare at the ground
The 225 has split out left divers
Bitch out you find the sick sound I might just
Drop another album to restore your fate
Like I didn't pay my dues when you saw me wait
Waiting' 'round the same time as the highest man
It set something off like I had the tightest plan
Execute perfect, top charts I worked it, pop stars got murdered, drop bars like Kerser
I made a blueprint, the greediest shit that Kers does
I designed it, so it's only gonna work once
Laughing in your face now I'm one of a kind
You backstabbed me, get a real one in your spine
Attitude's troublesome, same as my brothers damn
Crawl into your mind and take our brain to another land
We out here, this is real as it gets
What you think we gonna fold if we dealing with threats?
FUCK THAT!",https://genius.com/Kerser-highest-man-2-lyrics
Hit My Spliff 2Night,S.C.O.T.,2013,"Here's a new fact, I make your fuckin' crew collapse
They gon' call it true rap 'cause it's over boom bap
Well, why you do that? They say I gotta thirsty mind
I gotta slow down reason for the purple sprite
Any style, it's been proven I kill
Your bitch want to do to me what I do to a pill, I'm ill
Plus only fans see where the fuck I'm coming from
Moving units, major labels, thinking something's wrong
Yes yes, it is true, I get hated, but I get paid a lot
Just must mean I made it gronk, the raw rap that can split 'em in half
If music was a slut, I got my fucking dick in her arse
Plus I'm hitting it fast, no hands in the driver seat
No breaks, pop pills as I'm lighting the weed
Fresh shirt rockin' with the hat to match
I'm getting head racking lines in a taxi cab, and that's a wrap

Let me hit my spliff tonight
Eyes half closed red, screaming this the life
Stand out from the pack with a different mind
Serving up the rap, you can get in line
Let me hit my spliff tonight
Eyes half closed red, screaming this the life
Stand out from the pack with a different mind
Serving up the rap, you can get in line

Let me hit my spliff tonight
Then hit the mic and bring on back a different kind of fucking shit you like
The next in line to progress, mess your frickin' mind
Yes, you guessed it right, I'm next to climb while I spit the freshest I've
Ever spat before, sure you can try ignore the signs
But truth be told I'm walking right towards a life I ought to find
I slaughter rhymes whenever aiming at my target
'Cause I'm sort of like a sword when I can't wait to rip apart shit
Hated by so many fools, they listen and they like me
Turnin' crazy like some cannibals just wishin' they could bite me
But uh-uh, I made a flow and they should know the go now
This ain't a race, but way too late for me to fucking slow down
I came to make the best and take my fate and I ain't giving up
It's Jay UF, and, yes, I changed my name and I don't give a fuck
It's all the same, same face, abnormal brain. It's simple bruz
The only Jay you today with Ratesy and the sickest cunt

Let me hit my spliff tonight
Eyes half closed red, screaming this the life
Stand out from the pack with a different mind
Serving up the rap, you can get in line
Let me hit my spliff tonight
Eyes half closed red, screaming this the life
Stand out from the pack with a different mind
Serving up the rap, you can get in line

Enemies appear 'cause I'm sitting at the top spot
People everywhere are thinking why I haven't got shot
I'm making music if I'm not on the road then
I chase the dream I'm making sure that it won't end
At a mate's place off my face
Talking bout the days, thinking how a lot has changed
But I gotta keep moving 'cause you only get one shot
Fingers in the air, tell 'em all they can fuck off
Crazy world, Imma paint the picture perfect
Words so explicit that I burn your eye's surface
It's so easy, smash 'em all 'cause they lame kid
We stand out 'cause everybody do the same shit
So real in a scene that's fake
Take away can't rest no sleep today
I am the truth in a dream and they telling me it's real life
I made my world change, I can't explain what that feels like

Let me hit my spliff tonight
Eyes half closed red, screaming this the life
Stand out from the pack with a different mind
Serving up the rap, you can get in line
Let me hit my spliff tonight
Eyes half closed red, screaming this the life
Stand out from the pack with a different mind

How Does This Work?,Next Step,2015,"They whack, they just copying Kers
With a sloppier verse, I hit the top with earth
Then I drop you it hurts, fuck you playing for cunt?
I'll leave you all tied up, laid out in my trunk
Straight out you a punk pussy bitch with a whack flow
Couldn't offer ten fuckin' mills for collab no!
Wouldn't do it 'cause your raps make my ears bleed
You should call your album Nobody Should Hear Me
Warn the public what you're giving to them
I;d rather listen to me take a fuckin' shit in a can
You're fuckin' kidding me man, just give up with the rap
All my fans call me king and I live up to that
I get a fuckin' A+ if the rap was a test
Dissing the Kers, well that's an appen offence
Then you found somewhere tied up to a tree
As I hit my fuckin' horn drive off lighten weed
I'm like

They should just quit (they should just quit)
It makes me sick (it makes me sick)
They on the dick (they on the dick)
Then try to diss (then try to diss)
How does this work? (how does this work?)
I must be first (I must be first)
If you hate Kers (if you hate Kers)
You're a fucking nerd (you're a nerd)

Don't really care about no ARIA
When I get up for my speech I'ma laugh at ya
I swear to god I'ma yell out ABK for life
And if one person boos, man they're losing they life
I gotta move it all right, I'm fucking chasing a dream
Came a long way, used to chase for a beam
Don't you say that I'm mean though, I couldn't give a rat's are
Cunts talk shit, yeah, only when they smash glass
Fucker fiends, they get jealous of Kers
Look how far a cunt come, I come up from the dirt
You run up, you get hurt, you, him, him and her
I ain't prejudice bitch
Cop a beatin' from Kers! Damn
First slams like a beat in your sub does
Charging people money if they wanna touch us
I don't know, did my ego grow man
Bill my doctor for a time at the program

They should just quit (they should just quit)
It makes me sick (it makes me sick)
They on the dick (they on the dick)
Then try to diss (then try to diss)
How does this work? (how does this work?)
I must be first (I must be first)
If you hate Kers (if you hate Kers)
You're a fucking nerd (you're a nerd)

Off my guts on a regular basis
Popping pills cause I look like a face lift has just occured
Now they think I'm using Botox I said ""it's just the Kers""
She offered me a blow job, what the fuck with the sluts today?
I'm here, there, atm but she passed away
Half way through like ""what the fuck should I do?""
Left her laying there dead as I done up my shoes
I'm a nice guy right, I don't need your approval
Sent the nudes around on the same day as the funeral
I'm beautiful, fuck what a cunt think
I take drugs cause it helps me to unthink
About the fucking future with strays he's strapped
He'll shoot ya
ABK 225 that's the crew brah
Got the whole rap game held in a manoeuvre

They should just quit (they should just quit)
It makes me sick (it makes me sick)
They on the dick (they on the dick)

I Ain't Leaving,,2012,"Now shut your fucking face cause the man is back
The man and that raw rap to have you landing flat
On your face speak of face yo I'm hearing they hate that
Whole else you know could get their fucking name as a face tatt?
They ask me why I do it like ya up myself
I'm like yeah fucking oath I fucking love myself
You get me buried in a cemetery scary
If you do it then I'm daring
Take my wallet what I'm wearing
Take it all we can brawl
You can flatten me squashed dead
Reality will have it it ain't happening cock head
Kers around the street with the criminal straight crooks
You in your room you're buying clothes you typing on Facebook
You want the fucking raps who the man to check
I'm telling veterans that Kerser one demands respect
That's why I'm walking into clubs to the V.I.P
You rope it off I want the drugs and everything for free
Now I think I got em mad
They ain't got it like that
With a bag and It's wrapped
Glad fact it's dacked
Back to back champion
Yeah I'm holding the belt
You want a shot line up give me gold and I'll melt
To cash it in cash it in
Yeah I'm holding a nice stack
People love my shit even if they don't like rap
I'm the one that they be talking about I'm fucking exploding
I even thank the haters, thanks for all the promotion
My shit be fucking selling, disappearing from shelves
You wonder why it's not you, are you hearing yourself?
Shit
Jealousy's a curse and you be jealous of the Kers
Cause the Kers on your nerves, move forward reverse
Reverse the fuck away from me cause I'm sicker than swine flu
Meningococcal in a bottle sicker like times 2
I do what the fuck I want to do
So if I want to do you then your twats is bruised
But I got a girl so I don't need a groupie bitch
I take a flick then pass it on for the crew to hit
The music industry ain't ready for a kid from the slums
I'm like the fuck you to music fucking dick up the bum
Don't compare me to no one cause there's no one like me
I mean in real life and I mean when I flow on a beat
See they started off with hating then they turned into fans
So if you starting with the hating welcome you as a fan yeah
In 6 months you'll change your mind he is a sick cunt
They judge a book by the cover rediscover think bruz
Who else has you hanging on every word
I'm exciting and you know it, don't you hate on the Kers
Fuck your crew
Fuck your label
Fuck your music
Fuck your whole town
I ain't packing you up motherucker put the bowl down
The gold sound that's what I create
A good day on the pills yeah I'm popping my 8th
See I never gave a fuck about no Aussie hip hop
And then I come and took over, and they beg me to stop
Narr
I'm having fun and all you rapper are bitches
You's are fucking weak I'll get you bashed by my misses
It's the same old name
ABK 225 yeah the same old game
I'm the finger fuck you to the law and the judge
I've been sleeping on your raps I was snoring you cunt
I got an ego fucking oath I think it needs its own post code
I'm so fucking good so sick man I'm so dope
When I rap about that it piss you off
But I ain't really one to care I'll diss the lot yeah
Campbelltown they say it's rare and it's shitty
I'm a street motherfucker don't compare me to sixty
I been going on a bit I don't know when to stop
Fuck it leave the shit there when it drops it stops
Back with the bars leave you wrapped and I laugh
Cause you're wack and I ask can you pour another glass
You been waiting for the man to go speak up
I'm bad to the bone so they call me a deep cut
My weed tucked and the spliffs are rolled
I light em up my attitude I'm the sickest ohh
There he goes again about him all being the man
I think he doesn't give a damn expand and rule the land

I Am Kerser,,2009,"Way since underage I’ve been the one to hate
And just to piss you off ill steal your number plates
It was worse by 10 yeah me and my friends
We picking buds from the floor so we can smoke ‘em again
Learned to thieve by 12 mixing weed for a need
Had to thieve for the weed succeed then breath
Then one-three I was calm with some hair on my balls
Thought it was staunch like a horse ladies want it of course
What I thought anyway 14 came along
My brain was gone yep wrong already from bong
Smoke before school umm lunch and then after
15 was here and now I’m punching ‘em harder
Remember crew of dudes that did more of the same
Type of cunts to go to church and walk with a chain
16 centerlink I be spending a quid
Attempted dealing smoke a quart and sold like a stick
Coppers knew me by my first name I thought it was fresh they like
""pass all the drugs scot you’re under arrest""
Stole Azzas I.D. so I could go to the pub
At 18 they were checkin’ still was getting fucked up
Forgot to mention pills and gas but they was in their ya cunt
Downing any fucking thing that made me think I was tough
Now I’m 20 years old and still cut like a switch blade
Rorting cunts like you 10 bucks for a mixtape
I am Kerser what you dumb
Sorry motherfucker but there’s no refund
Exchange been done what you think this is
Aww yeah thanks for your support you can suck a dick
I am Kerser what you dumb
Sorry motherfucker but there’s no refund
Exchange been done what you think this is
Aww yeah thanks for your support you can suck a dick
It be known that I manufact the baddest tracks
Walking into battle raps carrying a battle axe
Open mic? Fuck that ill provoke a fight
So place your best cards down like its poker night
You think you Kers? Your smacks got hard
The truth be you’re as toy as a matchbox car
I’m repin’ Syd-hop so you know my shits tops
Pull my zip you’re on your knees as soon as my dick flops
Rip spots on the mic presence most desire
A toast required so raise ‘em high smashing glasses together
As your saying cheers I do tracks in 10 minutes then their set for years
Left to dry like a masterpiece when I fucking speak
It’s a deadly craft of speech that stretches past your reach
Kersers the name kill you faggot fuck metros
Gag it up let’s go I’m maggot brahz lets roll
I am Kerser what you dumb
Sorry motherfucker but there’s no refund
Exchange been done what you think this is
Aww yeah thanks for your support you can suck a dick
I am Kerser what you dumb
Sorry motherfucker but there’s no refund
Exchange been done what you think this is
Aww yeah thanks for your support you can suck a dick
Campbelltowns where I’m at they just took us off the map
Cause the here the only way to get money is by cooking crack
That’s the earn high biz fuck that stir-fry shit
Make that smacked out looking junky turn quite rich
The subjects I spit is like a cougar in your bed
By the time you listen through you have a tumor in your head
When my crew hits the pub with pocket full of drugs
You selling them to dumb sluts who are paying twice as much
I’m a lyrical acrobat you fearing the static crack
But this ain't no battle rap I leave you like flatted rat
You leaning my way like you only got one leg
But I’m stepping even further and you fallen on your head
Fuck giving you an insight work it out yourself
I’m the sickest cunts living, eating, breathing on the wealth
Well as i look at my past some light to my mind
Its only track one bro you wanna hit rewind
I am Kerser what you dumb
Sorry motherfucker but there’s no refund
Exchange been done what you think this is

I Breathe Rap,S.C.O.T.,2013,"Can you feel that? I call this real rap
The medicine for any kid who don't know where his meals at
Probably ask him five years why you deal lad
Flick his paper, grab the satty bag as he seals that
Cold world I'ma do my best to warm you up
Streets are crazy on the daily, better warn a cunt
Not political political so distant
To where I grew up you probably heard about the district
Call it different, heated like a summers day
My rays burn, make a hater fuckin' run away
Till my dying day, I'ma stay high mate
Running down a highway, find me in a driveway
Bottle of the Jack Black, who you trying to rap at?
I'ma try get my head straight but I back track
Every time I think I'ma try not to sink
Drive to the brink, high lightin' a spliff wish
Shit changed but in ways it stayed the same
To this day play the game, try to maintain but the fame
Does my fuckin' head in I ain't used to it yet
Yeah, I used to respect, you knew what I said
But these days I'm not sure if you relate
If you knew my fate true you'd be a mate
Anyone would 'cause I'm destined for greatness
Talking about Oz, I'm the best, I can say this

I live this life, this is my time
This is my mic right in the bright light
Everyday I breathe rap, feedback, I don't need that
Driving with my seat back, puffing on a weed patch
Don't tell me how to live
When there's a thousand kids, high vibed to the sound of this
I drop this here and they feeling free
Feel free till I die, I bet they feeling me

This is fucked man I'm tensing it up
Can't believe I'm halfway through and I ain't mentioned a drug
Does that mean I'm cleaning up? Is my life on a new road?
Soon as I turn the mic on it's like you know
And you know I'm your voice in fucking many ways
That's why you listen getting blazed on your wedding day
Your girl she's a fan too she know I'm the real deal
Walking down the street spinning out cos I feel ill
Sick of all these people acting nice cos I spit rhymes
Can't I sit back getting high and just live life?
Not the fans cos the fans are my whole life
I mean the people being nice expecting I'm a goldmine
They ain't gonna get shit but a fuck you
Too many people needing favours I ain't up too
Let me get away imma do my best to relax
As long as when I go they remember these facts

I live this life, this is my time
This is my mic right in the bright light
Everyday I breathe rap, feedback, I don't need that
Driving with my seat back, puffing on a weed patch
Don't tell me how to live
When there's a thousand kids, high vibed to the sound of this
I drop this here and they feeling free
Feel free till I die, I bet they feeling me

Another world getting cold, I'ma bring the heat
Hoping I am still here, will you even miss me?
Real rap, straight facts and that's that
The king talks, you're not allowed to backchat
Another world getting cold, I'ma bring the heat
Hoping I am still here, will you even miss me?

Hungry as hell, after my tucker
Steppin' to me? You'll be mute like plucka
Get ready for Kerser and Sarm
You merk from above, straight merkin' the young
Get hurt in the bum, 'cause you're thirsty for cum
To me, you don't exist like sers in a run
See that, never cause a commotion
Like a black bear, forced in the ocean
I'm a tag rare, forced in the moment
You're a black queer, snorting the lotion
You get kicked, hit, thrown aside
When we spit shit, stonerfied
You get ripped bitch, open wide

'Cause you're doin' an act, why you doin' it, lad?
It seems so sad and lame to me
That I wait eight hours patiently
Se-se-settin' up a bomb right under the deck
Then you hit the stage; no set
Cunts in your back row equals your front row
Only got one row, now they're all fucked bro
Fucked up and they're leaving with burns
Leaving the Earth, how evil is Kers?
Half these cunts never been on the street
But they speak like they be on the beat with the heat
Why you wanna talk about shit that you never done?
Say you pullin' triggers but you couldn't even get a gun
Get 'em son, yeah, you emptied a full clip?
No you didn't. Never have, don't bullshit
Kers one, you can mark my words
I'll make you fuckin' listen when I start a verse
Y-y-your shit's whack, it's piss weak to me
I could probably get you killed for a fifty of weed
And I listen to the shit that you say
I can tell that you tryna be fifty today

Turn your shy missus to an arse

Yo

They got me buzzin', Album 5 sounds like dynamite
And when it drops another million rappers bite it right?
I'm used to it by now, fuck I've been through everything
A new producer by my side, is this what's meant to be?
Now they questioning but i ain't gonna answer shit
Major labels wanna talk - what's a man to think?
I threw my fucking program off to get my album done
And now my doctor's asking how I'm fucking living ahhh
I don't know what to tell him music runs my life
I don't got the time to be here every Monday night
And, if I have a break with music, fans are on my back
But I don't blame 'em, it's the Kers, you need a lot of that
I'm just staring out the view of my new car
It's almost like I've hit the point where I've come too far
Only do it cause the fans need me right now
So how the fuck can I not give them my life - how?

Do this for my damn crew, do this for my fans too
I don't know if you know, 
I ain't stopped from Down The Drain ooh
See my world change, money made my world strange
Money makes the world go round, but money's on the world's pay
Do this for my damn crew, do this for my fans too
I don't know if you know, 
I ain't stopped from Down The Drain ooh
See my world change, money made my world strange
Money makes the world go round, but money's on the world's pay

Sometimes I think if I was broke then I would be okay
'Cause I've been on both sides of that and seen the people change
Like when you broke ain't no-one gonna hit you phone up
But when you're cashed up you won't wanna own a phone bruh
Learn from Kers I'm the king to hustle music
I got rich from this shit YOU fucking do it
Instead of hating cos your CD's don't sell at all
You should be inspired made a win no help at all
It's what the Kers did all from fucking words writ
Top the charts had the industry like ""Fucking word? Shit!""
And then these labels chasing for another signature
The future's looking even brighter I'm a winner bruh
And I'ma bring the whole crew to the end of this
ABK 225 - Don't forget that shit
If the fans are feeling fucked, who they run to?
They come to Kers I can save their life with one tune

Do this for my damn crew, do this for my fans too
I don't know if you know, 
I ain't stopped from Down The Drain ooh
See my world change, money made my world strange
Money makes the world go round, but money's on the world's pay
Do this for my damn crew, do this for my fans too
I don't know if you know, 
I ain't stopped from Down The Drain ooh
See my world change, money made my world strange
Money makes the world go round, but money's on the world's pay

Calm before the storm, wait till this album drops
I'll have a hater skitzing out like they outta pot
I'll have these rappers copying like ""How'd he do that shit?""
They either gonna bite, hate or admit it's sick
I hit a goal in the states with some new beats
A long shot but they hit me back like do this
And i ain't gonna drop their name till this shit drops
If you knew behind the scenes you would just agree with Scot
I'm over stressing what the public fucking thinks of me
As long as I am on the rise I'm making history
Probably take a couple years to realise what I've done
I changed the sound of rap in Aus since i got my buzz
And rappers hating I'll leave 'em on the floor again
Don't they realise that I'm opening the door for them
They can lay back, man you's are washed up
Can dreams come true? Shit look at Scott cunt

Do this for my damn crew, do this for my fans too
I don't know if you know, 
I ain't stopped from Down The Drain ooh
See my world change, money made my world strange
Money makes the world go round, but money's on the world's pay
Do this for my damn crew, do this for my fans too
I don't know if you know, 
I ain't stopped from Down The Drain ooh
See my world change, money made my world strange

I Thought Ya Quit,Engraved In The Game,2017,"Bass drop heavy, I just drank more Henny
I'm about to piss you off, thank you, I'm ready
It's the Kerser one, bitch, big chains in the Drive-Thru
Everybody lookin', I just came here to buy food
Price of fame, handle that with a few tabs
Make a move back, what you mean I got my groove back?
Ain't ever left, set the swagger where it meant to be
Got the fresh recipe, demolishing my enemies
Tracy Grimshaw, I still haven't finished yet
Got a photo on my blowup-doll, I'm kickin' it
Then I'm sticking it with a fuckin' switchblade
Watch it fly around the room, I think it got an itch, mate
Think I'm insane, throw me in the loony bin
I'll be with Rates like, man I swap your blue for green
Real intelligent, I'm always staying relevant
You tellin' by my elegance, I'm nothing short of excellent

Ask me if I'm sober, I be like fuck no!
You're talking weed, alcohol, all the drugs bro
I don't pop pills, unless I triple dump
But I thought you quit? Well I didn't, cunt
I did clean up and I ain't on the hard shit
I just live life, enjoy it 'til I pass it
So who the man with the shit to sell?
It's Kerser, want 'em free or you can keep it to yourself

Still drive 'round town like a maniac
I don't know but my psych say it's brain attacks
So insane with rap, I should fuckin' dangle cats
By the tail yellin' ""free pussy"" to a gang of fags
You ain't get no pictures brah
You just like to let the people stop and think you are
I got these bitches throwin' bras as I'm rappin' lad
Some bitches stalk, if I see them, I'ma slap them bad
What the fuck? I ain't a pop star bitch
I ain't soft, you won't hear me on no Triple J shit
I'm a one-man army with a thousand on course
So many people through your door that your house will just fall
Get with the program, I'm so sick with my art
That these other rappin' faggots keep on kissin' my arse
You can't get sick of me brah, I remain at the top
I'm a legend already, I'd be crazy to stop, what?

Ask me if I'm sober, I be like fuck no!
You're talking weed, alcohol, all the drugs bro
I don't pop pills, unless I triple dump
But I thought you quit? Well I didn't, cunt
I did clean up and I ain't on the hard shit
I just live life, enjoy it 'til I pass it
So who the man with the shit to sell?
It's Kerser, want 'em free or you can keep it to yourself

If A Pill Popper Could,Roll the Dice,2020,"Say I'm hot but she think I'm cold (Who, me?)

Ain't none like me before
They know they lost, they can see the score (What's up bitch?)
Who else as smooth as this?
If I had a clone, he couldn't do this shit
Wanna move with this, get a groupie bitch
Make her suck me off and clean my missus' shoes and shit
True lunatic, man, I used to tick
Up every single dealer that I knew, legit
I was a bummy cunt, lookin' hungry cunt
Now I'm like ""Take a look at what the money does""
True hustler, push rap like a drug deal
Prob'ly tell you how your dream girl muff feels
Style you love, I prob'ly created
It's Kers, I could never in my life be outdated
Purple in my drink, pop a pill on 
Top of the game, nothin' short of amazin'
Weavin' out props, got you props or probably
Otherwise, shots ringin' off on your property
She badly in love, stashin' drugs in her pigtails
Smokin' on kush, more relief when I inhale
Sunnies on just to hide my eyes
Hear my own song back like I might be fried
God

How many pills could a pill popper pop
If a pill popper could pop pills?

How many bitches would a sick cunt fuck
If the bitches got the sick cunt? Yuck
Not me

You don't like me, well, I don't like you
She ain't your bitch when she with my crew
I'm Mr Smooth, got hits for sure
I've seen mates got rich from a crystal ball
I must have missed the call in the studio
I popped so many pills, it made me stupid bro
Still got super flows, let me switch it up
The call me Kers, also known as the sickest cunt
Right then, prob'ly set another nine trends
Poppin' benz' in a Benz, plottin' with my friends
Thinkin' like when did this vision incline, man?
'Cause I remember wishing for positions I climbed in
There you go, there's a switch for ya
I got your missus still sendin' me pictures, uh
I'm in public, smokin' up the kush, high
So much smoke, they're gonna blame me for the bushfires
'Cause it's me, man, they say I'm the bad one
I'm the rapper that they all got their swag from
Brag on, I had tyres in the fashion biz
Looked around like I'm really what the fashion is
Sponsorship, had 'em mad when I got mine
Kerser made Nautica get a stock rise
Brag heavy but you can when it's all facts
Prob'ly get my pills from the same place you score at

How many pills could a pill popper pop
If a pill popper could pop pills?
Let's see

How many bitches would a sick cunt fuck

I'm wiser, got enterprises in the music, fire
Sometimes a trip, what we classify real
What we classify a deal, what we classify kill
Came on the scene, no realer, now I'm lookin' like a saviour

Lucky I didn't get shot 'round the time I pressed

What a ride man, honest, what a journey
I'm from an era of the starter caps and polar jerseys

Ima Be Me,,2012,"Yeah

Look at me now
I got my foot in the clouds
If you were me mother fucker
What you wouldn't be proud?
I turned nothing into something like I'm changing the letters
I make noise it hurts cunts like I'm banging birettas
I went from lining up in Centrelink to shopping for a fucking car
Cause I'm living off my bars, it's got me buzzing hard
Rock a show, getting dough, make the fans scream
Gotta go, lock and load, I'm the man breathe
Take a breath for a second, let it digest
Took the rap to the test and I dissect
They say I'm arrogant, I think I'm heaven sent
They talk a lot of shit about a cunt they've never met
I let 'em talk, I got another 100 quotes
I'm living good, people lie but the numbers don't
Number one on the charts without the radio
Hater watch and learn you should probably take a note

When I walk by, they all starin', they all look I try but I swear man
I'm high I fly to the rare end
Time flies my mind's not prepared and
I spill my heart on a beat, still ride through the street
Til I die Ima be me
I spill my heart on a beat, still ride through the street
Til I die Ima be me

You must feel so dumb, you were mad wrong
Saying that I wouldn't make it you a sad gronk
I love this shit, Ima rub it in your fucking face
In a paddy wagon 'bout to catch another case
Cause I ain't changed, I'm the same, tell 'em lay back
Kinda strange I used to claim, now I pay tax
The world turns and it turned me to the fucking top
My name's Kers ain't it normal that I cuss a lot?
I have to brag man, look at me now
You going crazy jealous dogs so I'm putting 'em down
They say I sold out, but they still buy my spits
How the fuck you sell out without signing shit?
I'm a freak and I did it on my own two
I was warned, ""Yo Kers they gonna clone you""
They can try, they will never have the impact
In the meantime, watch me shine you can sit back

When I walk by, they all starin', they all look I try but I swear man
I'm high I fly to the rare end
Time flies my mind's not prepared and
I spill my heart on a beat, still ride through the street
Til I die Ima be me
I spill my heart on a beat, still ride through the street
Til I die Ima be me

Head spins and I swerve in my new car
Try live in my world I'm the truth bruh
Ima die and be alive by my music
Ya kids kids kids kids kids gonna cruise with
This pumping, this jumping, my voice laced over percussion
This is nothing, this is easy
This is what I do, you gone see me
In your city with a pity and a cold drink
Eyes red nothing changed cause I roll sick
Still got the same bitch, she watched it change quick
Watch the fame play with my brain insane shit
I take her shopping, I buy the whole shop
Cause she saved me, she knows the old Scott
I thank you April, I'm swear I'm grateful
Now let's spend all this cash Ima make more

When I walk by, they all starin', they all look I try but I swear man
I'm high I fly to the rare end
Time flies my mind's not prepared and
I spill my heart on a beat, still ride through the street
Til I die Ima be me

Ima Stunner,Roll the Dice,2020,"Never gon' find me broke again
Cop a brand new car with an open hand
'Cause the fingertip's got a spliff in it
While I swerve on the road just to mix my drink
I had crowds packed before you rapped
We had lads stash gats before I spat
I had flows like this when no one would
I got hated before I was misunderstood
Then the worked it out, what the Kers about
I never had a bitch ever turn me down
I put weed buds in my cube
Smokin' spliffs in my jewellers
Just got a brand new time piece
She hate my music but she like me
I got five-eights that'll fight mate
That'll slice face and even life take
Do this shit too easy
House paid with old CDs
That's boss shit, can't doubt that
Top of the game but it's downpat
We get G'd if it's hostile
If you touch me, you got shot, style
Ain't shit changed, still Kerser
Still droppin' in like a surfer
I'm too local to go global
I'm too South-West with my vocals
Some close calls when I'm stressed out
Then I get high in a penthouse
Worked hard for this top spot
Here, talk tough  got, got
Check the game on my king packed
Yeah, Kers the reason they spit rap
And that's big facts

Ooh, try to hit me, you gon' miss me

Miss

From the bottom, now I'm shinin'

Never gon' find me stuck again
They have suspects but I'm still sussin' them
Got another cramp in my fuckin' hand
'Cause the jewels that I rock are too chunky, damn
I got the seat back, I'm in shotgun
I got a big spliff and I just popped some
With a zip bag in the glove box
Now my car smells like a bud spot
Do you love Scott or just trust Scott?
Said she love my eyes but they bloodshot
Shush bitch, do the Kers
With a famous bitch and she knew the words
I got shades on but I'm indoors
I shut shops down if I'm in store
I put Grimshaw through a brick wall
Had the media wantin' big wards
I killed every letter from A to Z
So I think I'm allowed to take a E
Wait with me, yeah, I brag a lot
'Cause I came from the bottom and it hasn't stopped
Picture me in like O-nine
With a rhyme style that was so fine
Blocked from the biz, had to go find
And I held the weight on my own spine
Back to the fact, I'm attackin' it mad
And the rap is immaculate, passion in that
So when I brag this and when I brag that
It's the blood, sweat and tears that I drowned in lad
What we gotta do, I'm a best kept stunner
Better get that butter, it's a dead set summer
There's more to me than the eye can see
On the VIP, how you likin' me?

What the fuck I even doin' in the meantime?
I grew up in Campbelltown, the endin' at the green line
Got my cash and split to a place where the beach lies
Tryna just relax, don't you go bring out my street side
Doctors had me pilled up, coppers thought I deal drugs
The whole time I was writin' raps, ain't a  bruh

I dream that one day, I could somehow find a clearer view, phew

Forever the sickest, I had to get it, I'm in it

There's no stoppin' the Kers, I'm forever on top
On watch as long as I'm alive, I swear I never will flop
Give you adrenaline shots from the message I drop
I'm like a leader to these people, I could never just stop
But wait, you feel it closin' in, kind of like the day's comin'
How I feel about that man, I'd rather mere not say nothin'

They say you can't 
They say you can't 

Let's get back into the jist of this
The reason that you fell in love with that, I'm sick as shit
Like my attitude and ego, had you feelin' yourself
I gave you strength when you were down, stopped you killin' yourself
The other side of the Kers effect
The reason why you see the Kerser as a perfect bet

Intro (Lifestyle),Lifestyle,2019,"Man, I'm back, album eight, got the drop on 'em
What a ride it's been, what you think, that Scot's stoppin'?
I remember at the start, they sayin', ""No one play it""
Then I made it so they had to say I'm overrated
Rockin' gigs every state, shows were gettin' bigger
'Round two-thousand-and-twelve I started gettin' figures
I been cashin' in off rap for a long time
Kept up with the generations, I maintain the spotlight
Makin' history, by now that is all plain to see
If they rappin' in Australia, I'm what they all aim to be
I set the blueprint and I'm what the goal is
So ahead of time, I'm chillin' in two-thousand-forty
Came back here to feel the vibe when I was at my prime
Consider yourself lucky if this drops and you're alive
You in the midst of this, this they call the sickest shit
Breakin' down the barriers, like ""No Rest For The Sickest"" did
Walkin' down the M5, thumb to the left side
Now I'm on the M5, seein' how the Benz drive
Respect the hustle, if you can't, guess you born to hate
I'll take a bullet to the face to keep my daughter safe
Every time I drop an album, watch my stock rise
What you makin' off an album couldn't match my watch price
Woke up still stoned, yeah, you know the go
Runnin' rap and I wasn't even shown the ropes
Competition dead, I compete with myself
Eight albums in the stores, they compete with themselves, yeah
Set a trend, let it dry, swear I make rappers
I broke the 'net when I got my fuckin' face tatted
Let's get it poppin', talk about all my career moves
I was trollin' way before the trollin' was the thing to do
Do the Kers bitch, do the Kers bitch
Don't fuck with Kerser, don't fuck with Kerser
A fuckin' genius man, I market like a Rolls-Royce
I ain't gotta advertise, you know that I'm the choice
How many times I gotta prove that I'm a different level?
Media tried to kill me but I didn't let you
Fans were shocked, I was something they ain't seen before
'Least by now, even more, 'cause I will keep it raw
The controversial start a riot on this side of town
Said they killed me but them cunts are bein' silent now
What it do, where we at with all the talk about
The top spot, 'cause you'd have to tell my story now
Light it up, mixin' up, ripped at a nightclub
Fifty bitches hanging off me, I don't like sluts
Hyped up, got 'em bumpin' me, lad
From the bitches who are posh, to the scummiest lads
I was poppin' more bars than the ones on my pad
I knew I had a problem once I hit the fuckin' rehab
Fuck
Let me strap for a sec
Pop so many pills, probably got some stuck in my neck, uh
Shake that ass yeah, bitch, you heard of Kers before
They call me king and god, I'm kinda like a perfect score
Settin' fashion trends, I do this shit by accident
If you see me at a bank, I'm there to cash a cheque
That's the boss shit, boppin' like a mosh-pit

Tell em I said goodbye tell em die-die
They fucked up when they got me paid
Ain't my fault I ain't make em drop the name, aye

I wanna see these rappers fucking stomp to bits
While little kids even join, throwing rocks and sticks, shit
You fucking buying what they saying like they so high
But they've been sheltered there whole time they wouldn't know life
Come in the mind of a real cunt
Compared to them i got a pair of fucking steel nuts
Step up, who's fucking tonight
I'm confident if you had that you might have something in life
But you don't so you stay in front of keyboards
Hit caps when your angry that's heaps raw
We ever catch you faggots out on the street
And you don't say what you type then you'll probably be
In the back of a boot tied up with an apple core in your mouth
And where saying that you have to talk
Your mum will I'm like speak up quick
But you can't 'cause the core plus your deep in a ditch, bitch

See me with a smile high living my life
Tell em I said goodbye tell em die-die
They fucked up when they got me paid
Ain't my fault I ain't make em drop the name, aye
See me with a smile high living my life
Tell em I said goodbye tell em die-die
They fucked up when they got me paid
Ain't my fault I ain't make em drop the name, aye

Get me back up, back up on the raw shit
I fuck the rap none stop I got a sore dick
But its worth it 'cause I'm only getting more rich
So bring the music I'ma rest it on my balls bitch
Rappers talk shit I like to talk facts
You hit the ground then you treat it like my door mat
Fucking rappers these days got no skill
In a battle there's not one I won't kill
Uh yeah they hating that
When I talk it up but they never say it back
Tell your fucking whole crew that I'm calling them wack cunts
If they call me wack ask 'em why I'm so cashed up
Uh, they fucking went quiet
They can't explain why so many people buy it
Dumb cunt fucking use your head
If you were good, they fucking would've bought you instead, shit

See me with a smile high living my life
Tell em I said goodbye tell em die-die
They fucked up when they got me paid
Ain't my fault I ain't make em drop the name, aye
See me with a smile high living my life
Tell em I said goodbye tell em die-die

It's Nothing,King,2014,"Lightin' weed in the hood that I grew up in
Like fuck it man it's nothin'
Fuck all who I trust man
People ask me do I trust them

I can't be fucked see you know me a long time now
I've never stopped to lie down
Racking up a line now
Back stage in a state that I don't know
I do it for the promo, and the fame with the money but you know so
Walk with head phones listen to my own shit
This place I grew up in feeling like my home kid
Empty her
And so many empty purse
Got me walkin' round drunk
Look for trouble it's bizzer
But I guess that's what my day brings, sitting at the bridge I use to fuckin' day dream
The world turns and I'm getting kinda dizzy now
Deep breath and I'm sitting down
Purple in my cup now
Dark purple sit my arse down
So fresh, so smooth I don't need to lie
Oh yes she moves she don't wonder why
I'm the man right now that it explains itself
Started poor now it's feeling like I'm trained for wealth
Need space so my mind is on a mission now
So fast, so far what I'm thinkin' bout, and I never had no time for your shit
I think, that's why they all mad
They don't like that I win
Success is in the air tonight
You pour yourself, your pouring mine you get your wealth, I'm getting mine
Your everything is extra fine
Your running out like extra time
I never meant to mess your mind
But it's kinda how the story goes
If my brains stayed the same till the story goes
Bring it all back with the way to act
And they talk that smack in aren't hearing that
Bring it all back for the street to have
You can have that crown I don't need it back
What I've learnt for this tickin time
Hustle world bruz gotta have that business mind
I'm heading out to the unknown
I'm cruising you can watch me go

Lightin' weed in the hood that I grew up in
Like fuck it man it's nothin'
Fuck all who I trust man
People ask me do I trust them

Lightin' weed in the hood that I grew up in
Like fuck it man it's nothin'
Fuck all who I trust man
People ask me do I trust them",https://genius.com/Kerser-its-nothing-lyrics
Just For Now,No Rest For The Sickest,2012,"I throw my hood on man I block it out
Swear the worlds gone crazy I gotta shout
At the top of my voice but I feel alone
Stepping on a plane to go kill a show
They said I'd never do it but I'm doing it true
And the biggest risk take is I do it for you
Haters get mad cause they see me shine
No attention to you, this here is mine
I fear the life that'll come when this stops
Rockstar shit cocaine in ziplocks
Wish not make moves and rise
Didn't work first time and im doin it twice
Hot headed, carve on the sentence
Marvellous efforts, half of them left this
But im here and im standing tall
They can all get fucked im demandin more
Party time and your free to come
Bitch to guy ratio is 3 to 1
We can get down we can do it right?
My gift can make you fly
Lift up, we ain't here for long
Gotta do this shit before we gone
Once your gone shit you ain't never come back
We just want this life, but im way too smashed
And I may just crash and fall from high
But I made it back im forced to write
Whats on my mind, nothin else
Two in your face go fuck yourself
There it is I ain't leave it too soon
Do what you do but with who and you knew
It can't be done like I can do
I hit ya hard write life for you

Time to party
We ain't stoppin till the sun is rising
Options never running hiding
Them problems equals rums and lines
And anything that you gonn' do
I promise we gonn' do it better
Only live this life out once
And we gonn' make it last forever
Time to party
We ain't stoppin till the sun is rising
Options never running hiding
Them problems equals rums and lines
And anything that you gonn' do
I promise we gonn' do it better
Only live this life out once
And we gonn' make it last forever

Make your mind up kerser gotta go
Another day we on the road
Never meant to ride through life
On a 9 to 5 need brighter lights
And I made that clear, I made them hear
Then I made them cheer
Came back with a name thats raised packs
No that means at the scene just laid back
Took it all and im takin more
Im the one that takes you to that place for sure
We can leave now are you ready or not
Gotta go before the energy stops
And when it does then whose to blame
Left or right you can choose your fate
I'mma leave ill be back in time
And I won't remember shit, yeah thats a lie

Time to party
We ain't stoppin till the sun is rising
Options never running hiding
Them problems equals rums and lines
And anything that you gonn' do

Keep Chasing Them,Next Step,2015,"Lay it all out on the table
For everybody else to see
Some may think that I'm not able
To achieve one of my dreams
I'ma keep chasing them
I'ma keep chasing them
I'ma keep chasing them
I'ma keep chasing them

Lets go back to '09 when my tape dropped
The industry blocked me out, they always hated Scott
But it's okay cos I'm a fighter, dropped another one
A year later out the gutter down the drain son
And all the albums with Nebs, we had 'em scratchin' their heads
Topping ARIA charts over and over again;
Now they hitting my phone, wanting the latest of news
Had me losing my mind, I was kinda confused
'Cause they labelled me a criminal
They heard about a drive-by and tried to paint a visual
But, way before that, I was spitting raw rap
Walking round Cambelltown hoping we could score that;
Reminds me of all them freezing cold nights
Running mucks getting chased by them bright lights;
Now I hit the stage you said I'd never make it
I'm a superstar, let me rub it in your faces!

Lay it all out on the table
For everybody else to see
Some may think that I'm not able
To achieve one of my dreams
I'ma keep chasing them
I'ma keep chasing them
I'ma keep chasing them
I'ma keep chasing them

Let's go back to like now when this shit drop
They tried to say i wouldn't make it in the hip-hop
Yeah I was there too
Everyone doubtin' me
Other than the crew and everyone surrounding me;
I came from nothing but a dream in the bedroom
To headlining shows, making money, and yes you
Can do it to, no matter what your situation
You're thinking 'how?', Shit!
Let me be your inspiration
I had the chattiest clothes, I had em tapping my phone
I had the raps in my dome, I did collapse at a show
'Cause I had too many drugs, then they labelled us thugs
But every website couldn't stop writing 'bout us
The team at the top, we are the cream of the crop
You got a dream you don't stop
And every tear that I've dropped, man I've done it for my fans
If you ever feel down you just gotta stop and...

Lay it all out on the table
For everybody else to see
Some may think that I'm not able
To achieve one of my dreams
I'ma keep chasing them
I'ma keep chasing them
I'ma keep chasing them
I'ma keep chasing them

'Til I make it
I kept telling myself
'Til I make it
I kept telling myself
'Til I make it
I kept telling myself
You can't quit, you gotta stack up the wealth
'Til I make it
I kept telling myself
'Til I make it

Kerser - The Real You,,2016,"Slip down, don't you fall you a soldier
That's me talking to myself in the cold ah'
Around the time I was going through some rough shit
Seventeen, skinny wreck on some fuck shit
Hated life, felt the upper-class looked down, then I joined the upper-class how I'm meant to look now
Still the same cunt fresh with the foul mouth
Certified been making haters fuckin' bow down
Ask about me I carry this game before I married this game and boy hasn't it changed
I use to rap in the rain, when I was smashed off my face
Pulled back with my mates, were they happier days shit
I don't know, we was only trying to have fun
We was living in the town you had to back up
What you said on these C-town Streets
Inspiration for the real ones when I move to beach, just reach

When we all go out its the same way, heard your man got shot in the lane way
Where you first met, now you thinking' kers next, holdin' on your bottle like there's nothing on this earth left
Get your head up man, they don't know the real you
That's why some hate and some they kinda feel you
I don't care, I'm looking for a quiet one
Wonder why I got a spliff, yeah I light it up

Crusing on the high way, on pills - five mate
Looking for a driveway, I just wanna drive away
I never look back unless it's on the good times
But that shit's hard when you stuck with the crooks mind

It took time, but I rose to the top
I left Obese records and they closed up their shop
But I'm a fuckin' hustle-er, I'm ABK till I go
Don't compare me to a rapper, in a lane of my own
And the scene still hate, well ain't that a shock
I think they mad cuz they flop and can't get their shit in shops
I played the game right, why you gotta hate on that
A real rapper from the bottom that has made some cash
Gotta right to have an ego, you fuckin' right
A couple nights celebrating thinkin' what have I
Overcome as I'm sittin' on the beach front
Damn I came a long way for a street cunt
Why curse that I made it in the rhyme game?
Cause I versed everything that came my way
Now the one you called chat is a made man
Take my boys on tour, best feelings when I pay them man

When we all go out its the same way, heard your man got shot in the lane way
Where you first met, now you thinking' kers next, holdin' on your bottle like there's nothing on this earth left
Get your head up man, they don't know the real you
That's why some hate and some they kinda feel you
I don't care, I'm looking for a quiet one
Wonder why I got a spliff, yeah I light it up

This for the fans that demand a knott
I'm the man alright, I use to stand and grind
In the rain with the mixtape, no one want to buy aye?
When on ebay, it went for 3k the other day
Shouts to T, sellin tapes with me, that was back in the day ain't it crazy to see that I'm sitting at the top we were sitting we would plot, and I gave the crew my word that I'm never going soft

I'm blacklisted everywhere, shutting me out
Will they ever change their mind with a gun in their mouth
That's a couple of stacks that I'm likely to drop, lets get back to the rap, it's my life, it's my job
It's my everything man, it can't get out of my head
It's like it's stuck in there forever with whatever I said
Unwritten letter, Can't rest but it's just for now
They will never understand, guess it's just me wow

When we all go out its the same way, heard your man got shot in the lane way
Where you first met, now you thinking' kers next, holdin' on your bottle like there's nothing on this earth left
Get your head up man, they don't know the real you
That's why some hate and some they kinda feel you
I don't care, I'm looking for a quiet one
Wonder why I got a spliff, yeah I light it up",https://genius.com/Kerser-kerser-the-real-you-lyrics

Kerser is sick!

What it is, it's the man of the moment
And any other moment that they claiming I own it
Kerser flavour, yeah I sprinkle on top
They hanging like a junkie needs a hit, I'll sprinkle a lot
So good with rap, no looking back
Shit there beef gets wrapped like cooked kebabs
I'ma light this spliff, you can ride this dick
I get the flu, people hang around to try and get sick
It ain't likely kid, I was born with this
This is bad for your brain, there's your warning bitch
As I pour a mix and chop fourteen sticks
That's a half oz here like my family mix, ya dig?
If not, fuck off, you must stop
I'll take you to the top, fucking oath so you can jump off
No more games, shit you know me by now
And if ya haven't heard ya best to know I'm owning the town, bitch

Put 'em up, raise 'em up, we gon' get high
Yes I demand that I'm the best I
Will never stop 'till they murder me, shit
You should have fucking knew it bitch, Kerser is sick
Put 'em up, raise 'em up, we gon' get high
Yes I demand that I'm the best I

You should have fucking knew it bitch, Kerser is sick

I walked in, kicked the door like ""hold up, nah wait wait""
I used that last time, let me set it straight mate
The sickest is back, ridiculous rap
Hold the fingers like that and hurt your missus's flaps
They asking 'bout me, where's he going, is he singed, no
You giving me a contract and you think I'm gonna sign, no
I did it myself, I wanna keep it that way
Pile up the ashcay and waste it on a mad day
The way I'm living man they pay me to bounce
While my fans sing my shit, they gotta say it out loud
You can find me at the club, rubber band around the notes
Who said I never made shit? I gotta jam it down their throats
Certainly the sickest, got me hurting all you bitches
Then they turn on me for instance cause I'm burning all their lyrics
Hit me back, come and see me on my death bed
With a zombie bitch getting head, dead set

Put 'em up, raise 'em up, we gon' get high
Yes I demand that I'm the best I
Will never stop 'till they murder me, shit
You should have fucking knew it bitch, Kerser is sick
Put 'em up, raise 'em up, we gon' get high
Yes I demand that I'm the best I
Will never stop 'till they murder me, shit
You should have fucking knew it bitch, Kerser is sick

Come and cruise with me and you will see lad
I'm the man and that's why I don't listen to their feedback
Hear that, feedback, lyrics here, read that
You's all make me sick, gonna make me bring my feed back
Come close, you can witness a man, talk tough
Now you're here, you got shit in your pants
I'm the freshest motherfucker that you've seen for days
Now I'm paid, eshay, now the green is blazed
Dark red eyes, yeah that's normal for me
And the rest of the boys, ain't it awful to see?
Do you think we give a fuck, you know the answer to that
I'm so sick motherfucker yeah the cancer is rap
I live fast probably die young, celebrate my life cunts
Make sure when they bury me they puttin' in some nice buds
Rise up and fight for a better way
Always off my guts and I can not remember yesterday

Put 'em up, raise 'em up, we gon' get high
Yes I demand that I'm the best I
Will never stop 'till they murder me, shit
You should have fucking knew it bitch, Kerser is sick

Now, Kerser, we gon' get high, fucking killed it again Nebs

Probably 'cause my crew jacked their shit and left 'em smacked up
Don't hate the player, they say hate the game;
You're why I hate Aussie rap so you can take the blame
I see coppers and I laugh 'cause you're not my equal
I'm sellin CDs and yeah this shit's legal
This is easy, gang shit, gutter rap

You're a festy cunt, you're not as fresh as us
I'll slap your little sister down till she gets me drugs
I'm on the bestest buzz, a straight reckless cunt

Kindness 4 Weakness,S.C.O.T.,2013,"Don’t mistake my kindness for weakness
We won’t settle on your level when we’re driven to the edge
Don’t mistake my kindness for weakness
We won’t peddle to the devil in the middle of the stress

Now-now, I’ma try and break this down the best I can, I never meant
To come across in any certain way but I do represent
The street, that’s why you met me and you thought ‘cause I was friendly
That you seen some kind of weakness, I’ll be damned, now try befriend me
But you gotta keep in mind, I’m from the streets and things are different here
You run your mouth where I grew up, you gonna cop a lifting, yeah
So, I don’t see why, when it comes to music, things are different here
They try to mould me into something, I’ma shoot and disappear
Loyalty, survival, mainstream never had the street’s voice
I’ll hit the stage at ARIA’s and tell ‘em suck a dee-oi
I don’t think there’s ever been an artist with this point of view
So watch with who you’re labeling before we 
come
 and point at you, you’re dead

Don’t mistake my kindness for weakness
We won’t settle on your level when we’re driven to the edge
Don’t mistake my kindness for weakness
We won’t peddle to the devil in the middle of the stress

We are nice guys but we try not to finish last
Come and test us then we warn you won’t be the last
We are nice guys but we try not to finish last
Come and test us then we warn you won’t be the last

E-e-every day I am feeling the stress
Paving the way, call it building I guess
Never get time to myself and I think that I
Need to go find a way out of this mess
Moving alone on a journey and quest
Stressed out this breath 'cause it's hurting my chest
Sitting on money is burning me, yes
Spend what I've got, I am certainly fresh
People do talk and they heard of me, yes
Don't want to pass, I am burning the test
Talk about money, try earning it and
Impossible, so go searching for bread
Try not to follow, be hurting your head
If you go down, you won't surface again
Once you go under, you chunder, I wonder
If bundles of money could serve me to death
Try to be nice, but I'm earning 'em man
They gotta know that I earned where I am
People go out, he would turn for a gram
After the gram, they return for a grand
What do you do when you're permanently banned?
Industry won't ever work with you man
Find your own way, then go work with a fan
Hi, what's your name? You can worship the man, Kers one

Don’t mistake my kindness for weakness
We won’t settle on your level when we’re driven to the edge
Don’t mistake my kindness for weakness
We won’t peddle to the devil in the middle of the stress

We are nice guys but we try not to finish last
Come and test us then we warn you won’t be the last
We are nice guys but we try not to finish last
Come and test us then we warn you won’t be the last

Don’t mistake my kindness for weakness
We won’t settle on your level when we’re driven to the edge
Don’t mistake my kindness for weakness
We won’t peddle to the devil in the middle of the stress

And you know it's going down when I'm in this bitch
Twenty bitches at the door better bring 'em in
'Cause I give it to 'em raw when I stick it in
Got the neighbours next door fucking sick of us
If the coppers get called I don't give a shit
Bruz I got beats galore are you listening?
Talk shit hit the floor when I hit your chin
It's my duty I'm a beast with this epic rhythms
You're like Beauty and the Geek with pathetic lyrics
And I'm Reggie Mite pick getting better with it
And your shit is so weak you should've never spit it
Your piss weak fucking album should've never did it
That's why your bitch is telling me to come and hit it
So if you're clicking on RedTube and see your missus
You know that motherfucking NEBS did it
Another album for the haters fourth time around
Guaranteed the underground classic when I wrote it down
Every night I'm out, get inside your house
Any beam looking for the cash and them I'm out
But before I go, I'm laying on the couch
Sent you a pic of my dick in your bitch's mouth
So you know what NEBS about
Get money get pussy, check it out
We keep it fresh you keeping it old
Your style's lukewarm mine's freezing cold
It's like a (pair inductor?) paracetamol
You best to keep your mouth closed take a seat you mole
Like (Kazza el Mazza?) I'm kicking goals
And you're just straight fucking licking holes
I'm living proof of the king of the booth
So just like B.I.G. gimme the loot gimme the loot

When it comes to this rap shit I'm the king
When it comes to these beats bitch I'm the king
When you're earning from this rap shit I'm the king
And that's why your missus is on my dick
When it comes to this rap shit I'm the king
When it comes to these beats bitch I'm the king
When it comes to these shows bruh I'm the king
And that's why you little gronks ain't (having our shit?)

You talk a lot of this
You talk a lot of that
You talk a lot of shit
It's awful when you rap
You was talking shit and we got your address
And my boys took it personal watch what you said
Now I'm sitting at your house smoking pot off my head
And my boy took a shot you got popped in your leg
Aw shit
The atmosphere
Kers one your fucking favourite rappers here
Slap the shit out the rest of them
Then I blame the drugs and adrenaline
Never in my life have I seen them bite
So much of me I'm barely alive shit
Someone tell them that they gotta stop with that
Otherwise they're gonna get got for that
You tryin' to keep up but I lost you lad
Admitting that you bite so it's not as bad
Let's go
On my way to a million
You can say it I'm brilliant
I ain't listen to you
'Cause last year I made a killing what's a figure to you?
Blowing up in the scene gonna see me fail
I ain't listen to them what you mean they bail?
Before we got there man and talk shit on the net
But when they see us all they do is give us respect
I've had enough of this shit we far ahead
Twenty Ks for beats if you asking NEBS
I ain't even start the fucking label yet
Take my word I'll be paid to death
Organise crime yeah I know some cunts
That'll knock you out just for toking up

When it comes to this rap shit I'm the king
When it comes to these beats bitch I'm the king
When you're earning from this rap shit I'm the king
And that's why your missus is on my dick
When it comes to this rap shit I'm the king
When it comes to these beats bitch I'm the king

Left 'Em All Stranded,,2013,"It's Kerser walkin' up in the LMG
Saddy bag rap call it LSD
The new king of aus rap if you like it or not,
Got the rap, got the hook, and the style is hot, what
Step on stage straight away screamin' fuck you
Forgettin' my own shit I'mma blame the mushrooms.
I'm so out of it lookin' like I'm not awake,
Still bang a hit, make your putrid body shake
On another place 'nother level outta space
They still tryna' work out where they found my face
You should travel with me, you can live the life
Work it out yourself I don't like to give advice
Still I sacrifice everything to chase this
I chase money and ya honey wants to chase this
I just write the same shit and ya brain trip
My rap tippin' trucks and it make a train flip
Other rappers sayin' home is where the heart is
But we from the South West ain't that the hardest?
Don't you say I sold out that some fake shit
I kept it real smelt cash then I claimed it
I'm arrogant cause you made me this way
I went and made history now I'm pavin' the way
For other street artists to get dollars and that
But for now it's my time and I'm hoggin' it lad
I met a fan and he had tears in his eyes
He said no I fuckin' don't I am clearly just high?
I got big things planned bruz trust the cunt
They talk so much shit but never front with one
So, that says enough about the state of the scene
Plus the photos of my mates I got they in the greens
I choppin' up sly on the flight again
So it's ready to be lit as the flight would land, man
Came a long way from hangin' in an alley way
Left on Tuesday wasn't back 'til Saturday
Call it happy days flyin' to the next show
Future god of this shit someone let 'em know
They already know, they just block it out
If I battle yo' someone start a body count
These motherfuckers here do the Kers
And think I'm only capable to write a stupid verse
Then they hear some real shit and it hits 'em hard
They got too much pride to call it sick, I laugh
I'm the realest out the lot, cut promotion off
Too many fish in the sea you in the ocean, lost
So with it motherfucker I'm settin' the standard
But in the process I fuckin' left 'em all stranded
Lost in a world I could be shootin' dope
But I'm just sittin' high in a Gucci coat
Miracle watch a cunt make a dream true
Saved your life when you thinkin' you could dream too
LMG hit me up come and lay a verse
I said to me all I gotta do is say a word
I'm so confident, here's an example
Within a month I'll be the highest viewed on this channel
Ah, here he goes again talkin' on his cocky shit
But they still all listen when I wanna spit
Sit on the back you can watch the Kers kill shit
Force some rappers to retire and they will quit!
Still miss the people that I fell outta touch with
Even if they at home thinkin' I'm a fuckwit
This is what I call me crawling in your fucking brain
Rearrange your cells and make you stab your lovely mothers veins
Calling me a swag rapper, what the fuck's a swag rapper?
Stay street, dirty rap call it bad grammar
One hit you fall apart like a bad hammer
One hit you fall apart that's some bad hammer
You fuckin' mess I'm on top of my shit
Two twos with a five we a popular clique
Got the new album comin' that's three from three
You been workin' on your EP shit for years
My team we the best shit, that's a fact
I say this shit to ya face I won't stab ya back

End of this night yo I think I'll be in trouble
I ain't need a court case, I ain't need a court date
Only thing I want is some weed and some more pay
I thought ay I'm the sickest you've seen
So fuck them others rappers you just listen to me
And my team we on some freak shit I'm telling ya it's freakish
You be my bitch in the kitchen with the clean dish
Ain't no effort in this I’m still an A grade
Other rappers hate me cause they jealous and they ain't paid
I got fans yeah my fans are fucking sick
You got fans but your fans you plug them in
You chucking in I got bud you just fucking spin
Fucking spin, fucking spin has it sunken in?
Too clever and you call me a dumb cunt
I used to be broke what I wrote got my funds up
The fucks up?
I'm kinda in a good mood
Thanks to the tabs and the cones and the cooked shrooms
I look smooth and clean I'm in the washing machine
Codeine for the powder man I'm so clean
Smoke green, light it up make your hoe scream
Freddy Kruger moving up and hoe this isn't no dream
From the slums I'm rubbing shoulders with rich cunts
They know I got the money becoming known that I'm a sick cunt
Picking old bitches up they playing bingo, I take them home they know the go, I gotta make them limbo
The king flow I hear you hate me true
But I ain't ever gonna stop it's what they pay me to do
Plus I honestly believe I am in the top 3 of this Aussie rapping shit 3 2 1 me
You're fucking right I ain't even really started
By the time I'm finished Aussie rap will be retarded
I departed, went and fell aparted they begging me to come back rearrange the market
Enough friends, I don't mean to offend you
I don't need more enemies I got enough of them too
At school mum would pack my lunch it's a sad fact
I used to yell at her you don't put sandwiches in glad wrap
As for bud, pills and maybe base too
I'm off my guts for real can't feel my face oo
C-town what up? I keep it too real
Call me out to battle at the moment could get you killed

Will be in stores go get it for you missus

I’ve made it through, I can’t believe I’ve got a style now
I can’t believe I’ve got a fuckin’ phone that dials out
I can’t believe I’m on a plane across the country
I celebrate the fact that people dreamin’ just to touch me
See me as a teen, fuck, live life as a cheap cunt
I open up my eyes, I’m surprised, is this a dream? Nah
I’m lovin’ the fan love, I struggle to stand up
My sunnies on, on every drug, you motherfuckers can touch
Growin’ up, no repeat, every meal, we reheat
Mum did her best but never seen what we see
Dirty coppers hate that I ain’t been in a cell
Livin’ life like a Saturday, I’ve been through the hell
If you knew me back then, then it’s all from the heart
If you only know me know, then we off to a start
Cigar with a wine glass, come on baby, find us

Straight celebratin’ ‘cause I made it out the prison greens
I’m on the winnin’ team, forget that shit I’ve seen
Now they check my beats ‘cause they’re tighter than your skinny jeans
Every day, I celebrate in every way, forget the pain
I set it straight, I’m here to win, fuck second place
N-E-B's smiling, put my drink up in the air
You bitches, you can whinge about the shit that isn’t fair
Bruz, I’m lookin’ at the finish line, their vision is impaired
And I’m gifted with these lyrics and the shit I spit is rare
I’m sayin' good morning, livin’ life like a Saturday
If you treat me right, I might greet you with a happy face
If you try and lie, try and stitch, that’s the faggot way

Never thought I could but I fought, it’s good
We made it through, now we laughin’ at ‘em
Got half a gallon of the harshest Fallon
 that’s the only loss
Livin’ my life, I’m the only boss
Drinkin’ a  thinkin’ this is life
Now I look back like “shit this is nice”
Hundred buck notes in a hundred stack
Ideas: give that to my mum and dad
That’s my aim, yeah, I raise the bar
As I race this car to displace these stars
Sixteen, yeah, with my backpack strapped
Told them all back then that I rapped that phat
Tat, tat, tat, on the door again
When the mornin’ ends and I crawl in bed
And I thought I said I fought the best
Life had to offer when it tore my chest
Got a good girl who I love and need
And I love to see, this love’s for free
Celebrate, yeah, happy as fuck
And I’m wrappin’ it up with an actual punch
Liquor in the mix, now I’m set to ride
From my left to right, I got extra high
Next in line so fix me up
With a mixed in bud in a sipped  cup
 when I bust this shit
Hatin’ on me, you can suck this dick
Must admit, times still get tough
But I got a strong mind so I 
will step up
Party time with a master mind

Let Me Chill,YouTube Promotion Tracks,2015,"Pick the ball up, I ain't even drop the shit
My mind's in a race, tabs make the clock tick
A bit quicker, I spit sicker than sick spitters
All lined with ARIAs and I ain't get my shit, listen
What a fuckin' joke, industry a puff of smoke
I get the last laugh 'cause I'm still makin' fuckin' dough
But on another note, I'm dealin' with my mood swings
Poppin' shit just to function and to do shit
My brain plays games, am I in the right place?
Like I ain't even wanna rap but it's my life mate
Tryna' stand forward but it's like I'm steppin' backwards
Labels only talkin' 'cause the fact that I can rap good
I'm in a black hoodie, smashed, I can barely talk
They told me ""look at yourself, you can barely walk""
If I'm fallin' apart, at least I noticed this shit
And if I fall will you laugh and push me over to the
Program damn, just to get me off the Xan man
I don't think it's workin', should I end it with a bam? Damn
Crazy thoughts that I'm livin' amongst
They won't leave my fuckin' brain 'cause there's a blizzard of dust
Ridiculous stuff, I see the bitch in you cunt
Just jealous 'cause I made it and I'm livin' it up
I don't know what to do, should I be zippin' it up?
Not my mouth or body bag on you conspicuous cunts
Just let me chill

Fuck
Just let a cunt chill
I need some space brah
Look

Keep my name out your mouth, 'cause I'm cruisin' in my own lane
Leave the scene behind, sorry but I gotta go mate
It's that simple, crash and smash into
Noddin' at the wheel, shoulder impact through the window
That's leavin' the scene with a bang yeah
See that phone still mine, yeah the same chair
I don't take care, I think I care-take
Probably 'cause there's too much on my damn plate
Ten for ten, that's the aim with the Nebs One
Will keep the promise 'cause I can't see a next up
That could do what I do in the booth
That could move, that could soothe, what I do for the youth
I work harder with rap, than any rapper in Aus
It ain't a diss, that's a fact and I swear it to God
Stop comparin' me, I'm on my own level bitch
And it's scary 'cause I kinda hear the Devil twitch
No thinkin, what am I drinkin'? What am I mixin'?
What you might listen? Scot, your right, we think...
Stop, I might be the option I see, then what, is he dreamin'?
Stop, I'm not bleedin', lost enough demons
Plot a rough secret, see your team decrease
Me, I been seein' shit, leave me in pieces
Two-two-five to the death, I've been reachin' up
But it's never like I'm ditchin rap
Still with the crew I'd be with if I didn't rap
That's some brotherhood shit, we the best team
Your girl plays this at night, it's a wet dream
Now let's see and emcee like me
I create the air and I can split the sea
That confidence shit, no arrogance bitch
Unless you tryna' take shots, we retaliate quick
But I'm here for a good time, not for some suppy shit
Unless you see me in the club and I fuckin' flip
Had enough of it, shit I had to air it out
If I left, would you care? You have to swear on that

Life Is,S.C.O.T.,2013,"Ti-ti-time ticks and it's going quite quick
But li-li-li-life is exactly how I write this
Ti-ti-time ticks and it's going quite quick
But li-li-li-life is exactly how I write this

Couple of stacks on clothes a week
Even though I get clothes for free
Thinking about my aim in life
Aiming high to the rainy sky
Started with nothing, watch it grow
Voice if the street, better lock and go
Do it for the ones you look down on, and put a frown on
But you out and you found a
Solid gem, call it diamond 'cause it's shining
And if I went from a siren to an island I'd be violent
But I'm out here chasing dreams, I ain't got no time to stop
A darker night just means brighter days around the block
Never stop you, chase your dream
Take it from me, you can make it clean
Idolised from state to state
Life on the line, it's make or break
Young Timmy got stabbed for an iPhone 4
Why someone take a life for an iPhone for?
Listen up now before it gets too late
All your problems escalate but you stand stall you're standing straight
Keep your head clear you got a plan to make
Move along live your life. Didn't sink in? Listen twice
'Cause I was lost and I was down but I changed my life
Hear from me, there's a way you gotta make it right

But li-li-li-life is exactly how I write this
Ti-ti-time ticks and it's going quite quick
But li-li-li-life is exactly how I write this

Find my goals, execute
Live life, accept the truth
Ain't no ever telling if you coming or you staying
Or you waiting or you playing on a message move
You gotta pave a way, don't you follow no one's path
Make your way, let them follow you
You ain't leaving last, gotta move
No one else can help you now if you can't help yourself
I've overcome what I won't become
But I won't be dumb and I won't be numb
Wait, I gotta be numb to ignore your feelings
So spiteful, but I've kept it real man
Hit this here, then hit the ceiling
Victory, I enjoy this feeling
Just stop, hope for the best
Hope you hear this and hope you're obsessed
Hope you don't leave, don't say that you left
Hope you're coming back and staying till your death
Is life a rollercoaster?

Life's a Race,Next Step,2015,"Is it worth the money? Should've stopped me at the start
Ain't shit funny when you watched me fall apart
If I could turn the time and rewind to a nicer place
I wouldn't, no way, 'cause I learned that time's a race

They asked me why I took the heavenly step
And tried to quit what I was on, ain't got no serotonin left
Almost impossible to have fun, shit what if I collapse on
Stage next birthday? I just hope that I have one
Getting blazed from an age, I barely had pubes
If I leave this world, just know that I fuckin' had too
I'm in a bad mood, what have I done?
The doctors tell me they can fix me tell me what have I won
Okay, with rap, I topped that, but then I thought I dropped back
'Cause I realised, at the top, is it really hot lad?
I just wish I could change up some certain shit
And open up my brain like a brain surgeon is
Looking in like ""what have you done?""
Ain't know happiness left it's just a bottomless rut
I've had enough of this game and the fame, it's ridiculous
Can't go anywhere without someone wanting pictures, shit

Is it worth the money? Should've stopped me at the start
Ain't shit funny when you watched me fall apart
If I could turn the time and rewind to a nicer place
I wouldn't, no way, 'cause I learned that time's a race

Sometimes you see me smile but I'm hiding my tears
You can call it bipolar but I'm writing my fears
I can say I'm fearless, I'm fearless of a human
But I ain't fearless of this feeling I'm consuming
Wish this would stop, yeah, Scott's got a weak side
Pop another pill, go to sleep and hope I did die
What the fuck I thinkin'? Man, I need to get away
Doctor's blame the Xanax, codeine and the Marryjane
Hopefully by the time that this shit drops
I'm clean and they don't find me in a snip knot
On the fucking program wish I took it slow man
I dove into rap and took over, what you know man?
About bein' poor as shit
And your missus goes to work, you try ignore the shit
And suddenly you're rich, you're buying houses by the water
Still you're depressed, I want an answer from the lord brah

Is it worth the money? Should've stopped me at the start
Ain't shit funny when you watched me fall apart
If I could turn the time and rewind to a nicer place
I wouldn't, no way, 'cause I learned that time's a race

Standing on the cliff edge, bout to jump dickhead
I'm in a dark place do you wanna see this shit end
Oh poor me, why I whinging on tracks?
'Cause I'm addicted to tabs and I'm admitting it lad
I ain't got shit to hide, And don't you sympathise
I'm in the middle of the ocean, wanna sink and die
Will this feeling fly? And will I be all right?
Or am I better off ending everything I tried? Why?

Is this worth the money?

Why the fuck am I so lost?
I feel this feelin' like I'm meant to do more
For you all, to not fall
Where do we end up in the end?
I wanna know, it looks like I've just left a mess
I tried my hardest for the stress
But everything just sorta lessened
Remember in the end we all defended the crew?
But then I take it back further and for life I got Boobz
The conscious eats me alive but if I recall right
You told me when we vibed you don't want the spotlight, true?
That makes it easier but I don't know, I'm trippin' out
Never hesitate to ask for anything, I'm spinning out
Started with cassettes on karaoke machines
These kids are startin' on the 'net, how fuckin' dope can they be?

So if you fallin', help you up, yeah that's the truest trait
If the shoes were on the other feet I know you'd do the same
Aye, Rates, 'member rappin' on that train bro?
You'd drum the beat on the window
And we would hit insane flows
Now we rock insane shows
Aye Jay, let me ask, remember Hank's go?
Snappin' my CDs, I still owe him for the tapes, bro
Shout-out to Digz, he used to wish for me to take over
I fuckin' done it, lads
From poppin' endos when we mixed 'em with our Xanny tabs
To cleanin' up and bringin' dreams into existence
If I'm cursed it's 'cause my cursor's tickin' off a wish list

Runnin' to this dream and it became part of my lifestyle

Enough of basic, let me hit 'em where it hurts
Shiv 'em with the verse and Kers will sink 'em make their liver burst
I deliver words crazy 'til they're in a hearse
Still alive they didn't die but I prefer to injure first
Then hit 'em with the headshot
I wanna see the legs drop
My rapping is a weapon it's like acid in your head and it
Attacks you in a second know what happened do you reckon
I'm the king of the game now, fuck your opinion
It doesn't count 'cause you're losin' and we're winnin'

I made sure it ain't a name you forget, wait
I ain't finished, stack 'em up on my plate
I stumble the rappers afraid put 'em back in their place, ashamed
I had to keep it up, thinking back when I said
""Always loved this heaps, I never rap for a trend""
I was using the pens as a drum, smashing my test
I got some talent and skills, I couldn't graff with my friends
I was too busy dropping styles that I could run with
Every time we drop a track, these rappers couldn't fuck with
I'm standin' proud and they fallin' down with one hit
I've been around with every noun down
When the drum hits, clown on the fuckwits, I take over
What we original innovators, we take what we want
You can face what we got, see you're long gone
We the brothers we backing you know the bond's strong

Put 'em there, you can line 'em up

This is real, it will die with us and we go
So put ‘em there, you can line ‘em up and they know
Come on now you feel the vibe with us and I know

And you're on stage and living large
Hope that paints a picture bruh
You still hating? Couldn't give a fuck
Positive vibes, on the beach
With my girl and we outta reach
Haters dead, ain't allowed to speak
I made it too where we happened to be?
Phew...
Thought I was lost for a bit right there
Lucky I stuck to this shit god damn
Me and my girl got outta there
Rolling up that good shit
Mixing up that good mix
Money in the bank I'm good bitch
I can see the future it looks sick

Pile up that green
Notes thick and mean
Living in a dream
Came true cause I'm me
Still smoking weed on a plane counting cash
Ain't no time to hate on no one, let me just go get smashed
I'm rolling with my brothers
We all come up from nothing
Paradise we laughing
Gold on the neck never tuck it
I made it, I made it
Sitting here all faded
Never be outdated
I'm gonna let the fake hate it

I'm gonna make you chill cunts
It's kinda like a pill does
I got the gift, you feel buzzed
We smoking on them real buds
I fell asleep on my plane ride
Woke up, gotta stay high
Then I gotta hit that stage right
I'm blinded by the stage lights
What a life to live huh?
Ups and downs but I need a
Bit of space, a breather
I don't wanna leave the game either
I live for rap, no giving back
What I work so hard for picture that
Started with nothing but a broken pen
But I made the pen the focus again
Through all the shit, all the drugs
All the hate, all the love
They call us up, better warn the cunts
That I'm staying up the top till' I'm bored as fuck
Ch-yea...
And we out around, every single state the crowd is out
I got the gift, it's all the Kers
ABK we rose from the dirt

Pile up that green
Notes thick and mean
Living in a dream
Came true cause I'm me
Still smoking weed on a plane counting cash
Ain't no time to hate on no one, let me just go get smashed
I'm rolling with my brothers
We all come up from nothing
Paradise we laughing
Gold on the neck never tuck it
I made it, I made it
Sitting here all faded

Look Here,Engraved In The Game,2017,"Ch-yeah
It's the one and only Kerser
I'm just gonna address some things
And it's like:

I've been on top of the game since I came in this shit
Amazingly gifted with the pain that I spit
And plus I'm in the winner lane, I ain't have to indicate
I've got my hands on the wheel and I'm steerin' straight
I'm a ABK, a twenty-two, a five and, no
I do it nice, I learn about it, I'll get found by scuba divers
I'm the truest rhymer slash rapper, ew, and I'm a
Fuckin' headache to a hater, King Kerser crucifier
The flow ain't sloppy, I do this shit effortless
You're the new king, you're takin' over, let me guess
I hear that shit every time, it ain't happenin'
Your gigs ain't even shows, they're more like fucking gatherings
I sell out massive venues on the regular
Rapping is my bitch and she knows me as a predator
I took over, pay homage and don't bite my shit
And when you see me, just say hi, no need to ride the dick

It's the Kers, spit my shit from the heart, yeah
They try and do the same but they ain't got a heart, yeah
Kerser G-strings up your girl's arse, yeah
It sold out, the other girls are like ""it don't fit""
Can't believe I threw that shit in the hook here
If you're lookin' for a superstar, just look here
Every time I drop an album, it's a good year
It's ABK and we the label that you should fear

I made fucking history, the style they roart
Half these street rappers only child support
If it wasn't for Kers man, there wouldn't be a scene for yah
I made 'em open up their eyes, I bleed from the
Fact that the bottom can just rise to the top
So give me props  unless we're lightin' the lot
And how I brang the mainstream underground, man it's crazy
'Cause they try do the same but that's the reason why they hate me
Okay, stop now, I'm thinkin' that's a lame sign
It's obvious they love me but they jealous at the same time
I laugh and I keep gettin' paychecks
You stole my shit, you should give me up some payments
But they broke, they won't say it in their rap though
I'm the only one that makes its rapping 'bout a cash flow
It sounds silly, talkin' 'bout how you're stackin' cash
But you know you're not, you want the scene? You can have it back

It's the Kers, spit my shit from the heart, yeah
They try and do the same but they ain't got a heart, yeah
Kerser G-strings up your girl's arse, yeah
It sold out, the other girls are like ""it don't fit""
Can't believe I threw that shit in the hook here
If you're lookin' for a superstar, just look here
Every time I drop an album, it's a good year
It's ABK and we the label that you should fear

""Okay Kers, what you think about the scene now?
What's it like when you're livin' out your dream? How
Did it it happen? What's the trick? What you gotta do?
What's your missus' name, I heard you had a baby too
What about your house? I heard you're near the water now
Is it better than the life you had in Campbelltown?""
What the fuck? You stupid fuck, don't you ask me shit
Unless you ask what I like better, arse or tits

It's the Kers, spit the shit from the heart, yeah
Kerser G-strings up your girl's arse, yeah
Every time I drop an album, it's a good year
It's ABK and we the label that you should fear",https://genius.com/Kerser-look-here-lyrics
Losing My Brain,,2013,"Didn't we just drop an album nebs?
Another album drop put that where the classics at
How many times we gotta prove we got that magic rap
Caught up in the money, everybody turnin' on me
I thought everybody proud 'til everybody want it from me
It's a funny thing I tell ya', I seen everybody dirty
Favour after favour never nothin' in return and
It ain't even like I'm askin' im just waitin' on a thank you
Your sussin' out my money, that ain't somethin' that a mate do
I bet it breaks you, I'm stackin' up I'm holdin' bricks
I learnt my lesson keep it separate never told 'em shit
Still ridin' with my girl, got her decked out in that louis too
Cause she was there when i was poor, look where we're movin' to
Water out the back, feel like swimmin' til i drown lads
6 bedroom house and I started in a town house
I got it down lad, i make my dreams come true
You stabbed my back, now you wishin' you could come too
Visit to see Sero but they had him on a box visit
He touched the glass and told me dont you ever stop wit it
He said ""fuck 'em all"" kinda like he read my thoughts
I could say a million things that we've both said before
He rang me up the other day, dialing me
He cracked a joke, the first time he's smiled in weeks
He knows i miss him on the truest we speech
Plus now the crew is getting pumped up for Shue's release
I'm waking up stressed, shit you talk about a workload
Holdin' on my money, ain't no way you see me turn broke
Cause I been there, I ain't goin' back now
This new life, equal stress, i don't back down
Fightin' thru life, i feel stuck in a dump
I miss Rates, we ain't spoke in a couple of months
And I'm movin' on, I'm watchin' all this time fly
Thinkin' is my mind right, livin' in the lime-light
Remainin' on my feet, thru all the fuckin' hatin
Now them haters, when they see me man they tell me that i made it
I can't help but to make my life all public
The fans seem to get it because they tell me that they love it
They breathe it, they need this
They need another way but I'm feelin' at my wits' man i swear i need a break
We top the charts, have me poppin' pills, whats apart
Where the happiness come cause i got the cash and lost my heart
Realest on the mic here, need me then I'm right here
I'm washin' down prespcriptions but I'm mixin' it with light beer
I gotta find a way cause lately i've been stressful
But through it all, I am still the most successful
How's it work? Shit I'm losing my brain
But I keep getting bigger so the movement remains
I've reached a million to date and tried to move it away
Cause black skies cover me 'til a human is grey
I got a lot up on my plate now, considered as an icon
But then I'm told I'm here and i live my life wrong
This could be the realest shit that i ever wrote
This could be the realest thing that i ever quote
I got a couple enemies, they want me in a cemetery
They can knock me off but they can not stop my legacy
I keep movin' thru the depths of the flames
I put my life on the line so you remember my name
When I leave Aussie rap, thats a day off the map
Thats the way of my rap, no one sprayed it like that
Who's around? Cause I'm feelin' on my own now
You missed my buddy but i guess the phone got thrown out
Years ago you see me on a street with a beer can
Walkin' with the headphones dreamin' to be here man
And now I'm here man, no i don't fear them
Now i got a clear head, thought you're gonna be there
But you not nah, but you not nah
In a hot car, screamin' what? what you got huh?
I'm a live on the charts with the top ah
So sick that they needa call the docta
But you not nah, but you not nah
In a hot car, screamin' what? what you got huh?
I'm a live on the charts with the top ah
So sick that they needa call the docta",https://genius.com/Kerser-losing-my-brain-lyrics
Mad world,,2013,"Bunch of robots in a race they dont know where they going tho
Doing what they told, brain washed like they knowing so
Thats why im fucked up living how my mates live
I hope that 9 to 5 make you feel like you made it
Then coppers do and the government can die slow
Hi no im happy sitting back watching time go
Its what it is and what it is i can see through
What you do cause what you do is what we do
Not today man im feeling the stress
As i try block it out and not deal with the mess
You ever popped this pop that, dropped this what lad
Open up my eyes and realize ive been shot back
People think i make this up and i dont do shit
Look into these eyes and tell me i ain't being true bitch
From the heart from the dome im just being real
Ripped apart bone to bone i can barely feel


I'm not like the majority i'm kinda way different
Starting with the fact that im kinda way gifted
I reckon you back stab, these memories flash back
The end of the track smash, defending the lads that
Ain't got a dollar or a cent to get a feed or the kids who ain't got shit and sneak and sleep under sea saws
Keep your head up brother kersers here and understands
I understand if theres never been another plan
Fuck the robots why you caring what they thinking bro
Why you even stop to pay attention to a freaking clone
Plan to escape i got my hand in the gate
Pick the padlock, pop now the mans on his way
I can't handle it wait, why you gotta go for?
The old man who see me now he probably go to war
This ain't right i take flight with a pipe without a sedative
I guarantee that its a late night


Everywhere i go its always kerser what the up bro
People ask me this but i dont think they give a fuck tho
Tablet with a  lift so the codeine's the gift
I pop shit like this and it ain't cause im sick, nah
Its to get so high that i can't spit a word out
Pop one through the chorus i will hope i get the third out
Brain gone, eyes straining to move
I hade a plan now i lost what im aiming to do
I stay making the move i could break you in two
Dont be hatin' its true, its what greatness would do
I bought a mix quick/  with the shit that i spit
Along with what im on and im addicted to this
Now resistant and shit thats got my wrist in the hand cuffs
Paddy wagon swerving i ain't trying to stand, uh
Living life by the rodes on my note pad
You know its fucking real if kers the man that just wrote that",https://genius.com/Kerser-mad-world-lyrics
Magic Trick,The Nebulizer,2011,"Oi, I'll show you a magic trick, ready?
Where the fuck did that go, cunt?

Nobody's touchin' my drink tonight
If I haven't had a drink, better pinch me twice
That shit ain't right and I take it serious
Quarter past nine AM, I'm here for this
Nice drink with a tablet too
I'm forgettin' all the shit that I have to do
Now I’m walkin' down the street with a hatchet too
And an axe and a shiv in the backpack, ooh
Smooth as but my eyes are bloodshot
Can't it be 'cause I'm high as fuck, what?
Drunk too, fuck you and your punk crew
Talkin' on my bottle like “man, I fuckin' love you”
Saw the gronk lad, I’m havin' some fun
No money, walk in, then I grab it and run
Other rappers go and make a song for the piss
I'm in a bad mood, I see you, you're coppin' a shiv

Abracadabra, got a magic trick (yeah)
Touch my drink and I'll slap you bitch (ha)
Touch my drink and I'll stab you quick (come on)
It's a bad habit and I have to admit

Touch my drink and I'll slap you bitch (ha)
Touch my drink and I'll stab you quick (come on)
It's a bad habit and I have to admit (let's go)

Jumped up, poured a mix
Got a homeless fuck  shit
I forgot a little bit but I snort a stick
Beat a chat fuck with his own walkin' stick
I could have a bitch drink like a Vodka Cruiser
(Why?) 'Cause of the vodka loser
This ain't a track for you to go party to
It's a track for me to drink more  to
Knock at me door, I bet it's me friends
(Who's that? It's me) You got a Jim Beam ten?
I'll lock the fuckin' door unless you do
""Are you fuckin' serious?"" Yes, it's true
(Come here ) Nah, I can't hear you
Gonna lock the door, come back with a beer dude
Greedy cunt but what? I'm addicted
One dirty habit that I'm never gonna get bitch

Abracadabra, got a magic trick (yeah)
Touch my drink and I'll slap you bitch (ha)

People hate me when I get pissed
That's okay 'cause they gonna get shived
I'm a nice guy, I'm a nice g—
No I'm not, okay, that's a white lie
I settle down because I'm losing control
I gotta behave man, gotta do what I'm told
Gotta be a good man, gotta move when I’m told
But then I went and seen the fuckin' cue for the doll
What the fuck this shit? Now I pull out a knife
Grab the Centrelink bitch and I put it in twice
Everybody's screamin' ""Don't stab her, no!""
So I grab that bitch and I stab her throat
Walk back to the desk, normal as fuck
Here's my form, two fortnights, yep, that's a month
Leave the scene now cunt, I'm needin' a drink
I guess we all know where I'll be in a week

Makin' Them Aware,Tradition,2016,"I try to tell them that I’m one of a kind
But this worlds fucked up and kept a brother in a line
They covered me with fines back in my broke days
When would hit the bridge so we could oke-smay
No jokes made they laughed at me at the start
Then I got a bit of money and it’s broken their heart
The governments fucked up, they never cared about us
A single mother on the bus charging double on her pass
The rich ignore, but me I won’t ignore that
Probably cause I been there and I made it out the poor patch
Community would wise up, shit I’m the voice for that
If you a real man stand up, ain’t no choice in that
Seen it all, my crew we were the broke cunts
That’s why we spun out when the Kerser got his notes up
The cobra clutch, I’m not stuck in the way
I’m just living my life the day something’s gotta change

Ain’t nobody get my mission, making them aware
That people out here everywhere they hungry, ain’t got anywhere
To stay, it’s okay, cause we brainwashed it’s normal
I’m tryna wake them up, I’ve seen people living awful
But they ain’t gonna care it don’t effect them in the slightest way
They can lick their cheques and ignore then go hide away
What we gonna do, when nobody ain’t doing shit?
And they wonder why there’s people turning into lunatics

And all I hear on the news is some bullshit
A bunch of lies written just to keep the fools tricked
You ever been on a train in the South West?
You know for when the cunts were pulling out yeah
I ain’t even gotta say it cause the real know
The government plans, spin them in a wheel bro
They want the broke broke, they want the rich rich
That’s why they hate when I made it out the ditch bitch
Now I gotta be the voice cause the spotlight
Is on me it ain’t nothin' making Scott hide
I think we need another voice for the underhand
And I can do it off a dollar made a hundred grand
Off that hundred made another couple hundred too
Couple hundred K, piss ‘em off they see me move
The town house to big house, did it with my spits how
We ever gonna change? You’re listening to a king now

Ain’t nobody get my mission, making them aware
That people out here everywhere they hungry, ain’t got anywhere
To stay, it’s okay, cause we brainwashed it’s normal
I’m tryna wake them up, I’ve seen people living awful
But they ain’t gonna care it don’t effect them in the slightest way
They can lick their cheques and ignore then go hide away
What we gonna do, when nobody ain’t doing shit?
And they wonder why there’s people turning into lunatics

I never been a preacher and I ain’t need a teacher
I just find it funny you used to treat me like a creature
Like “nah mate, you ain’t fitting in the dress code”
That felt pretty shit when I was in my best clothes
Always broke, stuck just how they wanted us
I made it flip, now the government want me bust
No way, I’m too strong and I’m smart too
I could start a war and rally up a harsh crew
But end of day the media gonna twist the shit
Make me look like liar or a hypocrite
So I’m here for my fans, hope they understand
That I’m here so it’s possible for other plans
Kers 1 I’m going down in the history books
I rewrote Aussie rap check the history, look
I ain’t even gonna say what the Kers done
They join the puzzle after every single verse cunt

Ain’t nobody get my mission, making them aware
That people out here everywhere they hungry, ain’t got anywhere
To stay, it’s okay, cause we brainwashed it’s normal
I’m tryna wake them up, I’ve seen people living awful
But they ain’t gonna care it don’t effect them in the slightest way

Naturally,No Rest For The Sickest,2012,"There's a war in my brain that I can't tame
The left side fights the right with a dark flame
In the back has my fucking head on fire
Passed hour I've drunk or gotten higher
I'm underwater spitting with the spliff that I just lit and
Call it praying call it wishing
Call it change and call it different
Call it what you want but my reflection in the mirror
Tells me I know who I am in fact it couldn't get no clearer
That Ecstasy feel, this is definitely real
For six years, swear to god my aim was getting a deal
Then I realised I don't need one, I'ma do it by myself
And so I did and now I'm paid and yes they stock it on the shelf
You can call me self made from the gutter, it's a miracle
Don't copy what I do 'cause they see through and they ain't hearing you
Then there's fuckers from the place that I grew up in
Who were jealous tripping, like fuck it man hes nothing
You don't fucking know, what I've done to get to where I'm at
You in the same place, I'm on a plane and I'm getting smashed
Plus I'm getting cash, still I live in C-Town
Don't say that word sellout, think I need to get my feed ground
Deadset I'm going hard, going in, never quit
Branded on my face, cause I know I'm forever sick
My point of view, collides with many others
I don't listen, we ain't brothers, I'm admitting that I'm gutter
You brag about this shit
And that's what makes me stop and think
'Cause if you really living gutter you ain't wanna live that shit
Trust me we would know, I know you feeling this is real
Trees lit up so much we kind of give a Christmas feel
Begging for forgiveness, nah I'm begging that I win this wait
I won already, get me ready, steady who the sickest
Close them eyes, and travel into my world
The bridge you cross is smokey, getting heated when the pipe twirl
You don't fucking know me, therefore don't you fucking judge me
Try and diss it doesn't budge me, you live shit I'm living lovely
Saying what your saying and your sitting just be patient
'Cause I almost died to get here yeah you tell me why I made it
I consider pen to paper pain that I have gone and pushed away
Bleed the colour of the pen, this my life you look away
Kinda crook today, them the pills I took today
I always rap about the drugs 'cause they have fucking took my brain over
But no it is over, not until I'm sober and I'm on top with composure
Nebs compose the beat, whereas I compose my speech
If you mix these up together then they taking over streets
God help 'em, cause they stuck and they hating
I'm moving at a steady pace, enjoying that I made it
Celebrate, yeah you can mourn
Slap your fucking face cause I'm gone and moving on

Talk your shit, I don't listen
Saying what it is, then what is it then
Falling off the phone, but they carry me
Calling for a home, I do this naturally
Talk your shit, I don't listen
Saying what it is, then what is it then
Falling off the phone, but they carry me
Calling for a home, I do this naturally

Say I didn't work hard, is that a sick joke?
I've lost everything from rap but never quit though
The hardest working rapper ask Jay or my big bro
You think this shit just fuckin' fell in my lap?
Too many sleepless nights had me bring hell into rap
I will never be the same, guess they right, yeah, I changed
But everything is strange in this fuckin' rap game
Rappers pissed off 'cause they can't get a pay cheque
They need to blame someone, so I'm gettin' the blame yep'
Reporter's on my back yeah they waitin' on a slip up

I met a cunt who had a shiv in his dacks
A flash-back, thank fuck I ain't living like that
Don't consider me a preacher i'm just giving you the real world
The hardest thing you have to do in life is find a real girl
Speak the truth, loyal mates are a handful
Fake friends are only there when you got your hands full
If people talking and they giving you hate
Make sure you make your dream true and rub your shit in their face
It's what I done

I had it all
And then I look in your eyes and I watch it all
Crash over, again
And oh
I take a look at the tears that I shed and now I know
I'll never change again

Never gonna stop with the shit that I do
I seen one to many fake friends dissin' me too
Shit you haven't seen, I'm busy, yeah, I barely get a day off
You got my back all night its like I'm trying till my day stop
I ain't chase props I get it when I spray plots
On how to run this hip-hop till my motherfuckin' grave spot
It's filled up with beers and purple sprite bottles
Now who the fuck said Kerser is a role-model?
All day, I hear these rumours fly
But when you're at the top they try make your movement die
Even rappers actin' nice saying my raps are phat
And the jealousy hits I got 'em stabbin' my back
But it's part of the game, got no heart, you are lame
Sometimes I wanna rewind and just start it again
I'm at the top and it's burning 'em, brah
Hall of fame motherfucker, yeah, Kerser's a star!
We out

I had it all
And then I look in your eyes and I watch it all, crash over, again
And oh
I take a look at the tears that I shed and now I know
I'll never change again",https://genius.com/Kerser-never-change-again-lyrics
Never Seen Me Fall,Roll the Dice,2020,"Only thing that I know, these guys have seen it all
On my way to the top, you've never seen me fall
Never seen me fall, never seen me fall
Out of space, and I'm miles away

Still the same Kers but a little bit changed
On Centrelink before I had minimum wage
With a car that was shit, always needed a jump start
Give it to the boys when they needed a pump up
Fucked up, that's the way that it was
Say what you want, but I made it to the top
Fell down when the tabs took a toll
Ain't even on fire, I was actually cold
Fall back with the raw rap, all that
Never said that I sold drugs, or trapped
I was writin' on the bus, feeling poor, bad
With the girl everybody wanted, all that
What a shit fight, tryna get my shit right
Told 'em wait, I'ma be up in the big lights
Had 'em hatin' back then, in my teen years
Hard to cry when my eyes won't bleed tears
Thick skin, won't cut from a chainsaw
Sixteen, smoke shit, and my brain sore
Then I took pills, had memory loss
Through it all, never once did I forget who I was, God
Will you watch me, almost at the finish line
I don't know what to do when I finish mine
Seen it all, I'm ahead of the rap game
Leave me on the front, I can't be on the back page, away

Only thing that I know, these guys have seen it all
On my way to the top, you've never seen me fall
Never seen me fall, never seen me fall
Out of space, and I'm miles away
Miles away
Miles away
Miles away

Took a busload up to my first gig
Had people like, ah, that's who Kers is
I'm a wordsmith, man I got it all locked
Record labels tripped out, had 'em all locked
Before that, with a straw at a payphone
Just to make a few calls to my mates bro
Tell 'em come kick back, I'm in 
Back when Nebs made bangers that I'd burn
Or before that, recordin' at Blacktown
Mixtapes had to sell for the stacks now
Gone so far, just miles away
I wake up, I'm alive, gotta smile today, ayy
Tryna give a new view from my old view
You can have my old view, from a new view
Tryna give my new view a bit of limelight
Man, I'll let you be the judge if my mind right
In hindsight, always know I rhyme tight
Even back in days when I wouldn't sleep for five nights
But I'm clean now, sip a bit of lean now
Pop a couple pills, pass out on the beanbag
And my fans gotta know that I'm still here
All the weight that I held in a wheelchair
Seen it all, just had my back
'Cause at the end, I don't wanna just have the rap

Only thing that I know, these guys have seen it all
On my way to the top, you've never seen me fall
Never seen me fall, never seen me fall
Out of space, and I'm miles away
Out of space, and I'm miles away",https://genius.com/Kerser-never-seen-me-fall-lyrics

We runnin' with a lot of shit, we make it worse, we can't be
Stoppin', laughin' off the sharty gronks, it's hardly stops
A master, rob anything, we do it with the poetry and rhythm

How long a cunt do this?
It's the Kers, bitch, stop, don't ask nothin' stupid
Must move with the team that I rep
If the rap was a drug, got the phemes on the step
Paranoia mate, put a beam on your head
So you're chasin' a dream, you can dream when you're dead
Seen what I said when I first came up
Talk about Oz rap, bring the Kers name up
Let's go

Next Step,Next Step,2015,"Pen with the pad, execution with the rap
Never losing that’s a fact, gotta movement to attack
Used to walk around the streets, copping chases as a track kid
Coppers barely caught us, if they did, we got bashed, shit
Shit was fun to us, wasn’t much more to do
C-town with the crew, who you talking to
Dropped out in year nine, they said I’d be a nobody
Obviously they didn’t even get to know Scotty
Had a plan to write raps every single night that
Put me in positions, jump on stage like ""where the mic at?""
Remember getting chased, hood call them ‘muck runs’
Chopper coming out of the night, we yellin’ “Duck cunts!”
Hiding in a tunnel sipping goon, we were sixteen
My hair a little different, even then I could spit mean
Came a long way, chill as I reminisce
Pourin' up a mix, memories I’ll forever miss

Take it to the next step, in Oz I’m the best, yeah
The crew that I rep get rowdy, and I’m dead set
I ain’t gonna say much, I’ll leave it to the music
Pourin' up a mix, this is easy, I abuse it
Take it to the next step, in Oz I’m the best, yeah
The crew that I rep get rowdy, and I’m dead set
I ain’t gonna say much, I’ll leave it to the music
Pourin' up a mix, this is easy, I abuse it

Started from the start, I'ma take it to the end, bro
We was out bombing streets, just me and my friends, bro
I was never really good with the graff
Still put up everywhere in the hood 'cause I had
A, destructive mind all I wanna do is vandalise
These days, I’ll stab your face 'til my hands are dry
And someone else can take the charge for that
My shock value can cause a heart attack
Crazy shit happens, I ain’t saying it like “hell no”
If I told you everything, I’d be in a cell, bro
Crime got heavier, I ain't gonna dwell on that
Whole game changed when everyone started sellin’ crack
Never had the mind for that, I wanted to be a rap star
Ten years later, now look where I’m at brah
I wonder if the cunts I did that with
Hear this shit like “Yeah, man, I miss that shit” damn

Take it to the next step, in Oz I’m the best, yeah
The crew that I rep get rowdy, and I’m dead set
I ain’t gonna say much, I’ll leave it to the music
Pourin' up a mix, this is easy, I abuse it
Take it to the next step, in Oz I’m the best, yeah
The crew that I rep get rowdy, and I’m dead set
I ain’t gonna say much, I’ll leave it to the music
Pourin' up a mix, this is easy, I abuse it

Them days are gone, now wish I could just bring them back
Yelling “Cops kill kids” out, alley way to stash
All the shit we had, beers in a backpack
Trying to sell gas to cunts, it was really rat sack
What can I say man, I miss my teens
But how can I complain now, I reached my dreams
Pills back then, they were hectic too
Remember red Mitsubishis also came in blue
My favourite were green star, shoulda seen me brah
Eyes so wide, everybody on the beamer
We got the keys to the council spot
Off some bitch who’s dad had a council job
I ain’t gonna try and snitch and fuck up myself
Or tell you what happened next, ah, fuck it
It’s wealth
That caused a beef with this Constable Jones
I beat his charges in court, hope he’s dead and alone
Ya dog

Take it to the next step, in Oz I’m the best, yeah
The crew that I rep get rowdy, and I’m dead set
I ain’t gonna say much, I’ll leave it to the music
Pourin' up a mix, this is easy, I abuse it
Take it to the next step, in Oz I’m the best, yeah
The crew that I rep get rowdy, and I’m dead set
I ain’t gonna say much, I’ll leave it to the music

The sickest

Fuck
Hide your girlfriend
Charlie Sheen in this shit
Thehampion, the best and the great
The greatest, the god, the machine, the king, the murderer
The bomb smoker, the prince, the purse snatcher
The master, royalty too
Your boyfriend's favourite
You can't fuck with me now

Understand what I'm doin' right now
Got it down in your town with a sound that is ground
Breakin', takin' any situation
Make men hate and then drown anticipation
I've arrived; what, you didn't know so?
Here, take a photo, use it as a logo
Don't go runnin' 'round actin' homo
Diss me in a track then you must need the promo
I'm the cocaine, market me
In Oz hip-hop, I'm the fuckin' Charlie Sheen
Got these heads pissed off 'cause I'm passin' by
Dot on the top 'cause they half of I
Think about it, use your brain
If I'm one of a kind, who's the same
I know who you know, they like me better
Get me fucked up yeah, write whatever
You never met a motherfucker right like me
You better pay fifty grand for a signed ID
Might be the fact that I'm so sick
Might leave you smacked chats and 

There's no fuckin' with me now
There's no fuckin' with me now
There's no fuckin' with me now
There's no fuckin' with me now

You wouldn't have a clue what I do in the booth
What I do is the truth, what I do, bulletproof
Can't be touched, I won't laugh at cunts
Tryin' to do what I do but they half of us
Nah, wait, not even, I hate your team
And I'm a major prophet, you break it even
Rackin' up a line in a penthouse, bitch
In a spa with a wine then I get found sick
I'm the sickest, delicious, vicious
Rolled into one, yeah, this what the shit is
Rip this every time that I bust
When I'm rhymin', I must climb right over cunt
Snap you in the face with the back of my hand
Then I slap you in the front then the back again
I used to have it clean now there's drugs in the way
And I'm fucked in the brain but I bust it insane
Every time I write, yep, fuckin' heaps raw
Kill it on the beat, Nebs on the keyboard
Saddy packed and the Xannies stashed
With a rack of gas and my hatchet dacked

There's no fuckin' with me now
There's no fuckin' with me now
There's no fuckin' with me now
There's no fuckin' with me now

Heard they done it, yeah, they done it and they did wrong
Tried to fuck around, I'm sittin' with a lit bong
Seen a lot of other rappers try to fuck with
What I do, what I do and it's done sick
I love myself and let the haters hate
'Cause today, the haters hate and they fade away
ABK, that's the team that I play for
Scribble down the rhymes that I write on the A4
Piece of paper, here's the hater
Jealous motherfucker, yeah, see you later
Grabbed the kid by the neck and said ""Listen""
Then he started pissin' before I could spit man
Heard it lad and it's probably true
What I got to do just to pop a few
 tablets, never really had shit
Now I want it all, slap your face in a backflip
That's it, yeah, I'm the man, mate
Don't believe me, pay a visit to my fan base
Damn straight, we can leave it at that
In the limousine lad, with me in the back

There's no fuckin' with me now

Nowhere To Go,No Rest For The Sickest,2012,"Are you alone?
No one's out here
Are you alone?
No one's out here

Same day, started as the last one
Nothin' changed, kind of hoping it's a fast one
Now my mates man, I hardly ever see 'em
I know they feel I changed but I'm feelin' like I'm dreamin'
Now when we drink up, we reminisce and laugh
I'm feelin' bad, I'm out it but they still stuck in the raw
Weighin' drugs on a scale just to pay bills
Plus the boys doing time, how do they feel
No matter what, I am stuck in the gutter
Money can't change shit, it's my brain motherfucker
If I had enough bills, I'd get all the crew fed
But I gotta feed the fam and remember you said
You had my back, well I'm needing the support
Try and move but I crash, plus I'm fiendin' just to talk
Nobody want to listen so I'm walking these dead streets
Feeling like the only thing that knows is a Nebs beat
What the fuck you thinking, 'cause I got fans now
That I don't need your help? Fuck, I'm putting the pen down
Wait I can't do that, 'cause that's the shit right
This the medicine that's going to save a kid's life
But I talk about drugs, so now I'm no good
Show your parents what the fuck around your own hood
Then maybe just maybe you'll fucking understand why
And hate me but rate me and the exact same time, 'cause I

Feel alone like there's nowhere to go
I try to find a home but I'm back on the road
Another mate rang but I missed the call
So you can use your fuckin' brain but you ain't thinkin' at all
And yeah, I feel alone like there's nowhere to go
I try to find a home but I'm back on the road
Another mate rang but I missed the call
So you can use your fuckin' brain but you ain't thinkin' at all

I could be drug fucked, that would make sense
You try to hold the weight I'm holding, it would break legs
Cones that I've packed, every tab that I've popped
On the phone to my dad, but he don't know that I'm lost
'Cause I play it all good, no one needs to know shit
Don't know if I should, don't know why I wrote this
Feeling so confused, why the fans showin' love?
Why I'm writing shit like this, does it mean I'm growing up?
If that's the fucking case, I'd rather feelin' like a kid again
When we was running mucks I probably had them people listenin'
Nowadays, it's not the same, or tell me is this what the fame
Is doing to my brain? I've gone insane, I need a doctor mate
I got a lot at stake, I gotta stop it ayy
They tell me drop the pills, I end up fuckin' popping eight
I got my girl and thank fuck for that
I love her, need her 'cause I'm losin' all my trust in rap
Plus she found my fucking stash and she flushed it down the toilet
Next day, I went and scored, don't talk about it, I avoid it
Where to go? What to do? 'Cause I'm lost, what?
Now these haters gonna use it as a soft spot
But what's not to say that you is not the same
Somehow I'm in my right mind but I lost my brain
That's my heart, sittin' served up on the paper
I fucked up and saved nothin' for later

Feel alone like there's nowhere to go
I try to find a home but I'm back on the road
Another mate rang but I missed the call
So you can use your fuckin' brain but you ain't thinkin' at all
And yeah, I feel alone like there's nowhere to go

Ocean Eyes,,2020,"I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes

Ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your

Ocean eyes, it's no surprise
Know your worth, gotta know ya price
In a sea of sharks, gotta fend for yourself
On a land of sheep, can't depend on the help
Think out the box then your mental health
Gonna get questioned, what we meant to tell
The next lot? Red hot, dangerous game
Don't trust cunts, still blame the fame
Pick it apart, sit in the dark
Should've been dead when I'm mixin' the drugs
Ocean eyes and they watered up
Double cup, I'm still pourin' up
And the vibe you want, got the mind of Scott
In a whirlwind now, is it time to stop?
Over the top just knowin' I'm on
Fans gonna cry at the moment I stop
Gotta hang on in, can't hang on out
Gotta take my wins, gotta make you proud
The world just spin and the shit deranged
And it feels like pills just fix the pain
Dust it off, what the fuck you want?
Heard he got got, try touchin' Scott
Got a bunch of cunts that'll die for Kers
And I keep 'em and it's vice and verse
How the saying goes, gotta make the most
The world won't change by takin' votes
Your girl won't stay if you fake it bro
And mine was there when I was major broke
Ocean eyes, you got me hooked
Been through so much, gotta drop a book
Till my dyin' days, they hype my name
My life display is the price I pay, ayy

Ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your

I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes

To make me cry, gotta take my eyes
You know the name, you can't take the pride
Haters lame, wanna take my life
We can play the game, who gon' pay the price?
It's a crazy twist, I hit major shit
A bullet to the head wouldn't make me quit
Back in '08 was crazy shit
Did a mixtape, one take, that's it
Got a bit lost when the albums dropped
But at the top is where I found my spot
Walked on through those rainy days
Never did know the pain will stay
Can't respect what I can't forget
But I can't forget what I can't respect
Now things change, it's a crazy world
Pills on a plane almost made me hurl
Attitude stuck, it been the same
More income when the seasons change
Suitcase packed interstate again
Won't leave each state without eighty grand
Do the math, you pocket watch
Twelve years in, my stock ain't dropped
It's only rised, that's no surprise
They too bloodshot to be ocean eyes, what?

Ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your

Off My Head,Lifestyle,2019,"I make it fresh, anything you see me rockin', lad
I'm not in pain but I have to thank the Oxy tabs
So don't ask when it's nine at night and I'm high as kites
And you're like, ""Why's your eyes-"" Stop
We ain't runnin' with that bullshit
I'm lightin' blunts that are same size as a pool stick
Got a freak bitch here, she likes to touch her toes
Type of bitch to hit your bladder with her fuckin' nose
I remember when I got my first paycheck
I was like, ""Shit mad, I can pay debt""
Then you see the boy fly, first they hate that
They compare me to the rest, they like, ""You great, lad""
I go hard, I'm a weapon from the southwest
Put the city on my back
C-Town rep, before it was cool
We used to score before school
And try to light this shit up behind the portables, too

I will always be off my head
That is even what my doctor said
I will always be on my meds
That is even what my doctor said
I will always be off my head
That is even what my doctor said
I will always be on my meds
That is even what my doctor said

Drip swag, wet sauce on your bitch's puss
I ain't wanna puff the shit if it isn't kush
My life crazy, I probably shoulda writ a book
Fuck your favourite singer, then I make her sing the hook
I been to space from the drugs like a couple times
Every year a new pay, I like to double mine
I'm my troubled mind, still makin' magic hits
I keep it old school, still rockin' baggy shit
A fashion icon, I double any brand's profit
I am Kers, so they tryna get their hands on it
I swear to god people see me as a dollar sign
Half the reason why these lads got their collar rised
Shiftin' Aus rap culture with my two hands
They gon' look back in a few years like, ""It's true, man""
No one done it like the Kers, I think you know that
Every day I could post a classic throwback

I will always be off my head
That is even what my doctor said
I will always be on my meds
That is even what my doctor said
I will always be off my head
That is even what my doctor said
I will always be on my meds
That is even what my doctor said

I'm off my head, I'm off my head

What?

I'm off my head, I'm off my head

Ain't nobody realer, lookin' like a dealer
Thinkin' like a killer, on the shit that killed Miller
Dippin' in a saddy, my chain is mad heavy
She askin' for a bevvy, guarantee I'm gettin' heady
Learn about the Kers, I'm up muderin' a verse
Said she heard about me first, I made her nervous in her skirt
The confidence of Kers prob'ly somethin' you can live with
I just got fifty-thousand for a show and lip-synced
Dipshit, I just heard you got your shit robbed
Ten cunts in a mask, screamin' like they Slipknot
I got 'em pissed off 'cause I say their shit's soft
A diamond test will make 'em go and put away their wristwatch
Twenty bitches at a party on a rooftop
Walkin' 'round with titties out, comparin' all their boob jobs
High as fuck, April next to me, what?

I need a moment in fact, then they tell me that I save lives
Broken hearts, always ended with the same cry
Smooth as, I got prob'ly get a dyke wet
Landin' all the sponsorships, I'm waitin' on a Nike check
See me on the CCTV
Covered in my diamonds with bitches in bikinis
I'm a boss and I put that on my right hand
I'm movin' with the times, my career don't know a lifespan
Piggies goin' over lyrics with a fine comb
Someone double-guessin' everythin' I write bro
Watch me balance life, now I hit the paradise
Avoidin' all the parasites, I'm always known for rappin' nice
It happened guys

Old Matt,,2013,"So, everyone forgot about this old motherfucker
Then he drops a track mentioning my name
Talking about a battle that happened almost two years ago (whatever)
Come on sixty
Put that pipe down brah
You're falling off

The old man yo he lost his sight
And his ex bitch left 'cause she lost her mind
I'ma tell you all facts about how Matt's fake
One week ago was on the forums typing ""Kerser is great""
He calls this shit a joke like ""I'm mucking around""
And if he diss me properly, the cunt be stuck in the ground
What pissed me off the most is when Matt act tough
Then he meets me, got him shaking like ""Uh uh bruz""
I don't want no fucking trouble man it's only a joke""
He's begging to his manager, like ""it's only a toke""
'Cause you a crack head bad, you a ice fiend brah
And your careers at a stand still, I see brah
And you needing some attention so you calling out the Kers name
Your pop used to touch you up since you hit the first grade
And that's the reason for the Mickey tat
I didn't wanna bring it up but you're tripping Matt
Bro, you need some fucking counseling, you're not alright
I told the crew if they see you, you get dropped on sight
You're a fucking old man, go and live your life
You look fifty five now, fucking give up the ice!
The whole industries talking 'bout you and your crack pipe
Life after fame is it really that bad, why?
Thought you had it sorted but your whole life fought
Your best mate got a disease 'cause you was hitting him raw
And then your missus went and left yous were tying the knot
She left you 'cause her friend started tying the knot
Life isn't fair so you isn't a smart fuck
You're a nice bloke, why you rap like a hard cunt?
You're featured on a song called Reservoir Dogs
I didn't even have to say it, you said you're a dog!
You say you piggy backed me if that's the case
Why this track got more views in a couple of days?
Behind the scenes, sixty tries being my mate
So if he drops a diss track then he thinks it's okay
You a fake motherfucker popping half a pill
Every vid I upload is hitting half a mil
Every vid that you drop sits on twenty K
You fell the fuck off Matt, are you feeling okay?
I've dropped three albums in the time you working on one
Your career's falling off, it's time for Kerser you cunt!
You're obsessed, this is weird, clean yourself, shave ya beard
You're a pop-star faggot and ya whole crew is queer!
Everything you wanted growing up you got
In the rich neighborhood getting touched by your pop
Fucking with a street cunt, your worst mistake
Still ask me for ID they think you're thirty eight
Stop saying you're clean you're on the Xannies and shards
You have to pay me twenty K now to battle me fag
You made my career? Nice try there man
I was hitting million views with the Highest Man
Before your fucking name even got mentioned with mine
You're a pussy and you're scared of progression, it's fine
I just fucked you up, Kers one is serving you
Bounce back Matt, next one is personal
Bitch!

On Da Move,Engraved In The Game,2017,"Never forget who the king of the shit
I can make your eyes hurt with a flick of my wrist
Swag out proper it's ridiculous shit
Cricket bat to your head, yeah, I hit it for six
None sicker than this, I write rhymes over any style
Reppin' ABK fuckin' oath, it's been a while
My lyrical skill has got 'em fearin', I'm ill
Drinkin' beer and I chill after eatin' a pill
Woah, so ill with it, put me in the quarantine
Rap a circle 'round rappers, we all got a dream
Got out my weapon pokin' out my fuckin' Gucci shirt
Never lackin', I got enemies, I'm too alert
You should see when I pull up in my Range Rove
It's my second one, I treat 'em like a paved road
Type of cunt you never see them in the same clothes
Ten racks on the footy, what's the pain bro?

On the move, on the grind, it's the Kers one
Sippin' drink, gettin' high with a burnt blunt
They pray for my downfall, I just laugh but
I could have your chat bitch in a bath tub
I ain't one to have my eyes on a truck load
Kickin' back, gettin' sued as I puff '
dro
It's the Kers, I'm just livin' out my big dream
It all started in the South-West of Sydney

I sweat swag and I smell like a new note
I wrote this with a joint on a new boat
I'm so sick, it's to the point that I'm too dope
I came in the rap game as a new hope
A fresh cunt with a style that is all mine
Tat a king's name, mine's on my jaw line
A trendsetter with a vendetta then get a
Drug addict on the benz and you get better
I explain myself, my album documentaries
No matter what, I'ma never be a memory
Only when they lay me down in the cemetery
And, even then, my ghost will be your fuckin' enemy
It's the Kers, I just racked one up
The line was longer than the plate, I still racked it bruz
Then walk around fucked up, you won't see me 'til a week later
Kerser one, I'm your fuckin' girl's screen saver

On the move, on the grind, it's the Kers one
Sippin' drink, gettin' high with a burnt blunt
They pray for my downfall, I just laugh but
I could have your chat bitch in a bath tub
I ain't one to have my eyes on a truck load
Kickin' back, gettin' sued as I puff drogue

One Of A Kind,S.C.O.T.,2013,"You know I'm not an arrogant cunt but you know I run this shit ayy
(Oh yeah fucking oath)
Hey
Yeah this is Scott, sickest cunt out there
Ha ha, you dig?

Tell 'em Nebs, I ain't fucking round when in this booth
End careers if the beef is worth it you can choose
Ain't a rapper in this country done what I done
And no one helped me at the start and look how far that I've come
Cheap imitations, imitating on the greatness
That I'm making makes me switch it up on beats that Nebs is baking
They needed me to save the scene, so tell em that the saviours here
I never had to act a part a street cunt, think I made it clear
Plus my brain is not the same when the fame come
It's like the only way to get away from it is take drugs
Still I'm the greatest here, tell ya man to fall back
The raw rap in store that is selling more than raw crack
Undeniable, my rhyming skill and the swaggers hot
Plus my shit be popping they just angry 'cause you faggots not
Your missus' hands in her pants when she hears the voice
The only reason bed time comes and you think that you got her moist!

Running and I'm never stopping, gotta go and chase the dream
As long as I'm here breathing there is nothing they can take from me
One of a kind, yeah I'm one of a kind
And I'm never gonna stop, can't run out of time
Running and I'm never stopping gotta go and chase the dream
As long as I'm here breathing there is nothing they can take from me
One of a kind, yeah I'm one of a kind
And I'm never gonna stop, can't run out of time

Leave 'em all for dead 'cause I'm way too far ahead
When this drops check the ARIA charts, I'm there again
So confident on top of it, you rapping like the opposite
But somehow you try bite my style gronk it's just so obvious
Got back up by an army, 'cause disasters like tsunamis
Why you rapping 'bout your barbies? We make money, why we laughing?
Look at all this gold I got, rapping like it's all I got
My rapping is attacking all the acting, got the balls or not?
Didn't think so man, they watch and copy
If you gonna do that shit, try do it not as sloppy
Don't think it was a fluke, I made it man and it's pure skill
In the booth about to pop another fucking bluer pill
So who the man this year? I'm the fucking man this year
Kers one I'm the man for the next ten
Then you witness history, you looking back like thank fuck
Before our time the only reason why you gonna hate us?

Running and I'm never stopping gotta go and chase the dream
As long as I'm here breathing there is nothing they can take from me
One of a kind, yeah I'm one of a kind
And I'm never gonna stop, can't run out of time
Running and I'm never stopping gotta go and chase the dream
As long as I'm here breathing there is nothing they can take from me
One of a kind, yeah I'm one of a kind
And I'm never gonna stop, can't run out of time

Aussie rappers suck my dick, pull down the zip politely
This ain't a fucking trick, this rapping shit is just for my team
Tell 'em all to give it up sincerely from the sickest cunt
The same mind set as 2Pac when he wrote his shit to ""Hit Em Up""
Fuck 'em all ABK UF
That's all that's left, marked for death, if they even half a step
I mean it man we ready, chop ya body to confetti
Energetic, you're pathetic, like me trying to past a medic
Cool man I rule, make 'em drool, I'm the shit son
Making 50K off a track, tell me which one
You decide you should probably suicide
If you got the choice to ride and you ain't choosing my side
You try ya best to keep up in a chokehold that's a sleeper
Make you hit the legs like when I used to hear the fucking beeper
Wit a bunch of shit dacked, trying to make some quick cash
Nowadays I sit back and make it when I spit tracks!

Running and I'm never stopping gotta go and chase the dream
As long as I'm here breathing there is nothing they can take from me
One of a kind, yeah I'm one of a kind
And I'm never gonna stop, can't run out of time
Running and I'm never stopping gotta go and chase the dream
As long as I'm here breathing there is nothing they can take from me
One of a kind, yeah I'm one of a kind
And I'm never gonna stop, can't run out of time

Yeah
This is Kerser
Government name, Scott
Sickest Cunt Out There
And I can quite comfortably say
We're running Aussie rap
This is it now, this is all that's left
Kerser, Nebs, S C O T

One Wish,Engraved In The Game,2017,"Kerser’s back, I’m back again
You heard off a friend I was relapsin’
That’s not far off the truth being truthful
Felt suffocated, leader of the youth
What the fuck? Who’s statin’ that?
I just wanna rap and leave it at that
But you can’t at the hype that I’m reachin' all right
And it’s kind of my life, did I teach them the right
Way or the wrong, were the drugs too much?
Or was talking bout jail and my buds in cuffs
Not enough honesty for the cunts who judge
Number one on the ARIAs, shut that up, hmm
Something up there
Never really care but the shit is unfair
That’s just life in a general sense
Fight on, aim up, what you recommend?
You heard my opinion like fifty times
I get goosebumps before the ink would dry
The realest vibe you can ever find
Pop pill rewind then I pop, rewind
What I got is my, pride in my daughter
And I got April, who would have thought a
High school couple what perfect timing
And twelve years later the birth of Diamond
That’s all you get about my daughter bro
Born Feburary this year, all I know
Is I never felt love like that before
They said I had a break but I’m back for more
It’s why it’s so dangerous, going against me
Swear it on God there is no other EMCEE
Done what I done, it was mad intense
Sorry baby Diamond, go back to bed, Dad’s stressed

Oh the Kers has made it
His dreams true, they hatin’
I take flight with one hit
I did this off one wish

Take you back to my battling days
The young ABK shit, we started to faze
You can ask anyone from Greels to 6
We used to rock to them battles, we were real as shit
Five years before that, we were still raw lad
Young cunts down hanging out where you score at
Table turns, I’m the one you used to call Chat
Now I’m number one, what the fuck we gonna call that?
Fall back, let me get through my
Rhymes 'cause I’m feelin’ extra hype
Ain’t nobody ever dropped a track this real
But in my own head, it’s a drastic feel
I attack this ill with a packet of pills
That I happened to steal from an addict, it’s real
Don’t be forgot where he put the pack
Mediacted real slow, let me push it back
To a time where the people doubted Kers
A long time before they were shouting “Kers”
I was broke as fuck, sitting on the train
With a few mates plottin' on the money game
'Cause the rain outside and they couldn’t write
Random thoughts are hooked in my
Mind when I process like I’m a robot
Staying my grind and a win and you know Scott
Set a tone for the street to rap
They stole my whole style, I don’t need it back
How many times do I have to prove
That I will not lose and you have to chose
What’s right from wrong? I’m not your answer
I don’t even know if I got the answer
Let's fly away, to a brighter day
Kers one did it, now you’re wide awake
Life’s great

Oh the Kers has made it
His dreams true, they hatin’
I take flight with one hit
I did this off one wish",https://genius.com/Kerser-one-wish-lyrics
Only Rap You Need,Next Step,2015,"Yeah
It's Kerser
Fifth album in five years
It's album number five
I'm still high
With your girlfriend

This the shit they waiting for, put earphones in it shakes your jaw
What the fuck you take me for? I'm only here to break the law
Kerser is the sickest, yes, it's said again, he did it
Poppin' medicine, you kiddin', got adrenaline, I'm in it
I'm in the zone, I give you shivers you know
I got ridiculous flows, is there a limit or not?
'Cause I can switch it up at any second, blame it on the Xannies
Yep, and act like I forgot and come back like ""are yous ready yet?""
Fuck me dead, he never stops with this, it's arrogance
I bought your CD and used the cover when I had a shit
I give a fuck about a rapper I enroll with
I got a batch I'm 'bout to feed 'em up another cold dish
You heard about me from the last four albums
They back alive well I'm comin' back to drown 'em
Your worst fear, it's the Kerser one
Ten years ago I would've grabbed your fucking purse and run
Fuck

Kers one, I'm the only rap you need, man
Heard the last who called me whack end up bleeding
ABK, that's the crew of this rap shit
Enemies end up dead if they attack this
Kers one, I'm the only king you need, brah
Heard my albums like bullets to your knees, huh
ABK, that's the crew of this rap shit
Enemies end up dead if they attack this

This the shit they hate me for, I'm gonna make 'em hate me 'cause
I steal these rappers fans 'cause they hear me and they just rate me more
It ain't my fault that I keep topping these charts
But I'ma brag about it, fuckin' Kerser's popular brah
What the fuck? The flow I'm spitting keeps on switching and you listen
'Cause my mission is your ears to grab and take a fucking shit in
I know that's how it feels to haters see you laters
I made it, I prayed it, then played it and slayed it
The greatest, shit that's a fucking long reach
But if we talking in Oz you know it's on me
The king of this, the fucking history maker
Hall of fame when I say the ""see you later""
Fuck the scene, I always knew it was fake
I had a dream it came real then it blew em away
And hating on me only made me get big
You should've kept your thoughts to yourself 'cause baby I'm rich

Kers one, I'm the only rap you need, man
Heard the last who called me whack end up bleeding
ABK, that's the crew of this rap shit
Enemies end up dead if they attack this
Kers one, I'm the only king you need, brah
Heard my albums like bullets to your knees huh
ABK, that's the crew of this rap shit
Enemies end up dead if they attack this

I am still the same Kers, from the start I made the
Choice to go and lay verses and made you hate worse
Never ever cared though, you faker then a scarecrow
Smoking in my chair bro, I should be the mayor yo
I am just the best lad, creatively address that
Wanna hear your neck snap, bullets and you get that
If you go and spread that to the fucking feds that
Means you gonna get smashed, not breathing in a wet bag

Kers one, I'm the only rap you need, man

Out Cold,,2012,"Out cold they found me dribbling asleep
And I don't mean no talking I don't dribble when I speak
Prescription med's, alcohol, saddies sitting next to the bowl
Sweating even though I'm cold the stress don't let it take its toll
When did this happen when I let myself turn into shit
When I was younger man I swear I didn't wish for this
My dream was raping god if you make this happen god I will get off everything and you won't ever see me slacking nah
Then it happened now I can't live up to my own word
I feel like I betrayed you cause you went and made this work
And I ain't crazy I know you just went to set my road
I pray that happened if I didn't pray I'd be unknown
Fucking nutter fucking drugs are gone and tripped me out
You thinking that will I be thinking you should sit on down
My life's a task and its got me thinking fuck it
A Pipe is passed then im probably gunna puff it
Honesty ain't that what they all be begging for
Then your honest half them ain't be your fan no more
But fuck it let em know people doubt me anyway
Wonder why to get to sleep i gotta pop a any-zay
That's pig latin I ain't here to hide no shit
I meant xanax if you didn't catch me slightly flip
I march on though head be doing mad twirls
The spinning cycle got me feeling like I had 12
More then I did already tripped
Empty bottles fucking oaf' I already sipped
No matter what I do you sitting there to judge my shit
That's why every song I'm telling them to suck my dick
It's 2am and I'm sitting here the light is off
Tell myself to clean the act
But knowing that i might not stop
I'll be fine im the kers I gotta be strong
Coz nothin ever happened if im gonna be Scott

It's all good but I
Can't talk now
Move forward but I
Fall back down
My maze wavy
I try to make it through
Like what's it gunna' do im only gunna' take a few
I can't stop yeah we gon' ride this out
And they gonna find me with these pages writing with me
 lying down
But don't wake me up I'm living life inside a dream
Well is this is better I don't know I guess its time to see
You couldn't in-lighten me but now im gettin' high for free
So quitin looking shitty like I gotta live my life and breathe
Be a better man try and make a better plan
F
eeling like a kid but im reaching my mid 20's damn
If you could understand maybe you would feel the same
And being truthful fuck I just went and destroyed my name
You love it real though broke it down real slow
Really real and I just feel only the real would know
I feel like going you are welcome to come join me
Chose to rap on stage because no-one was gonna employ me
J
ust a big winge' nah its from the heart cuz'
Proud of my shit till the day comes that my heart jumps
I missed a beat I ain't talking instrumental
Worst part about it is its totally preventable
Only gotta get a few only god has ever knew

Back to the board coz I'm rappen it raw
And I happen to saw what they acten no more
Ima separate me and you, a level above
From where you at now I'm like a devil on drugs
Peddalin drugs in a kettle and jug
My music be a drug that’ll get you buzzed
Sunglass cover eye coz im fucken high
Never seen skill I reveal coz im jumpen I
Will never stop to the day that I die
I’m given you the shit to maintain and survive
Blame me im high like day to day
Now the coppers tryna lock down ABK
I fade away to a distant day and pray for change I can’t live this way
On the edge now I think need codeine
Wiv a flow so mean make ya bro OD
Oh please gotta stop what I do
Now I’m poppin a few, need an option or two
To open up quick coz it tock tock tick
And it tick tick tock now I twist this top
Then I’m getting high and drunk again
Wiv a buncha friends till it fucken ends

This sucks never turn on a fan
I’ll make what I make till its burnin ya hand
At a single touch I bring the muck
We can meet anytime man I’m quick to punch
A muthafucka haten out on what I do
Don’t hate just admit that it’s not for you
Popped a few got me trippen out bad
With the scene in a bag drown, drown its sad
Think I give a fuck? No way ok
What I do is a move that’ll never go away
I slow it down cause efforts something that I’m lackin in
Hope you didn’t take that serious – I’m back again
Back with a pact and a guarantee
That if ya hang around now you’ll have to see
What I do to a beat and I do it with ease
Since 16 been on the move in the street
Movin to eat mo-move when I speak
Ya never seen what I seen so I’m doomed when I peak
And the fact is I ain’t even at my peak

Somebody help me, I feel all alone
Nobody knows that I'm losing control

All in my head, paranoid
Drop a couple pills and I'm mad annoyed
Can't believe I got myself bad destroyed
Trying to beat life, I don't have a choice
Sitting up late every night I try fly by
Wonder why but I can't deny
I'm kinda lost and it's fucked, I'm famous
But it's what I wanted and I'm not just saying it
Go back and take a listen when I started this
All I ever wanted was a part in this
Then I went past every other artist
Then I got a habit and it's fucked 'cause now I feel like a target
Everyday I wake up I feel like my heart ache
Dunno what to do I just wanna restart it
Never would of rapped if I knew this was the outcome
Goin' in public feels like I'm having anxiety attacks
And I try to relax nut, I'm hiding the facts
That there's a knife in my dacks
Paranoid yeah, at the worst of times
I spill my whole life when Kerser rhymes
And when Scott raps he falls apart
I make real rap, don't call it art
They may feel that I'm torn apart

Nobody knows that I'm 'bout to explode

Somebody help me, I feel all alone
Nobody knows that I'm losing control
And it's all in my head, in my head

All in my head and I need to escape
Feeling locked in, need keys to the gate
I don't ever wanna go back to the old me
Think before you say it what a smart man told me
I never did though always on my shit bro
Dropping hot rhymes and my mind is Skitzo
Shit no, am I losing track?
When I used to roam the street, I got used to that
Not used to fame, it fucked my head
I blame the fame when I'm dumping meds
'Cause it's fucked me up and I know the facts
You can write that down and you can quote me lad
Somebody help 'cause I feel alone
Even at home don't feel at home
Bout to explode on the verge of this
Music weighing up all the perks of this
Is it worth the shit? Well, the cash is nice
But I work so hard for the lavish life
Everyone got to say at the end of the day
That you breaking my trust is the end of the day
Don't mention my name in a negative tone
'Cause I'm paranoid probably get ya dead from my phone
On the way home and the pressure hits
Pop another pill now I'm swept to bits

I'm feeling the pressure, there's nowhere to go
Nobody knows that I'm 'bout to explode
And it's all in my head
Somebody help me, I feel all alone
Nobody knows that I'm losing control
And it's all in my head, in my head

I cannot move no more
I cannot move no more
Why am I on the floor?
Why am I on the floor?
I cannot move no more
I cannot move no more
Why am I on the floor?
Why am I on the floor?

I'm feeling the pressure, there's nowhere to go

Yeah, wait and see, I got fluoro sticks
You know this, there’s a few grown chicks
Ah, man, hands in the air
Look right there, covered in hair
 got me shakin’ my hips
Wrong place, wrong time and I’m takin’ a shit
How hot am I? I’ll rock tonight
But it looks like someone squashed a pie
And I’m back in my shorts and her tits dancefloor
Yellin’ at  “Why you wear pants for?”
Nebs, come on, I know we’re superstars
But that whistle ‘round your neck looks stupid brah

Kerser

Why do you think I blow this whistle?
(Why?) Them gronks can smoke my whistle
Hey Kerser, thanks for the tennis shorts
Now I’m ‘bout to get some sex for sure
Nah, I’m just playing, didn’t come here to get a root
Nebs, what you doin’ in the kitchen?
 Making fresh soup
Then I lace it with gear
Feed it to these bitches, Satan is here
Who’s who? Party wearin’ a headband
Have you seen that chick? Now the hooks like Redman
No, if she don’t try my soup, she’s a dead man
I make that shit fresh from the can
I put a daybreak drug
In your drink but I drunk it myself
You were pretty hot, I was meant to fuck you
But now I’m fuckin’ myself

You know we party 
like this
You know we do it 
like that
And when we do it 
like this
We know you bitches 
like that
You know we party 
like this
You know we do it

That’s why we’re talking

Oi Nebs, where’s the DJ bruz?
Out the back, lad
Oi, there’s too many metro aggots in here
Skinny jeans and V-necks and shit

Yeah, well, we gotta change the atmosphere a bit
Tell me about it brah
Yeah, you got that beat?

Yo, um
All right, if you're on LSD, you need to get the fuck out
'Cause we're gonna spin you the fuck out
You in the V-neck – fuck out!
Get the fuck out! Right in your face cunt
Ayo Kerser

I'll fuck a fake in the face with the face of a fake
Then I'm takin' away what they claim in this haze
Kerser one, you know the name, I got you readin' riches
Why I'm feedin' pimples, eatin' meat and missiles
Shut your mouth, I got it ready, you can say I've nearly cooked rap
We up in Campbelltown so just be careful who you look at
Puffin' the chronic, ain't it fuckin' ironic?
I see a muffin, I'm on it, I got her up on the bonnet

You cop a punch to the stomach, cough up your lunch and your vomit
Honest rappers shit the gear like there's a gun and I cocked it
I make ‘em leave you proper lone and start becomin' a Gothic
Now they're on some emo shit, no more Muph & Plutonic
I straight piss in your pocket, you need to summon the prophet
You need to run to Mohammed, you claim you're tough and you rob it
But you're the one that’s just dobbing, there's a bit of a problem
You're like thirty years of age and you get fucked up the covet

I’m the lad that they talkin' 'bout in good ways and bad ways
Look mate, it's mad ayy, I took 'way your sad face
Battle rap shit, yeah I’m dyin' to be goin' at
Promotors say it’s hard to find me an opponent, but
Ain’t this cunt sayin' that they raisin’ the bar?
Call 'em out, duck and weave, I be suckin' the weed
My attitude stays mate, they ain’t nothin' to me
Yeah, I’m somethin' to see like I’m one off the beat

And then you run to police because you runnin' from me
Put the noose around your neck lad and jump from the tree
If hoes are constipated like a junkie on the gear
When it comes to lovin' man, you love it in the rear
If you want a real show, I’m just a phone call away
Right, we set 'em up on stage and I blow you all away
It's like I’m throwin' a grenade at the stage when I play
You knew the shit was hectic when I wrote it on the page, uh

Yeah, warn 'em 'bout the soup
Um, there's some soup in the kitchen
Um, if it makes you feel drowsy or anything like that
Don't drive a motor vehicle or operate any machinery
And then fuck the clowns with the skinny jeans
And now shit their pants and they're gone
Oh, yeah, another warning
I put some Valium in the punch
And fuck it, I'm just gon' say it
If anyone's got that mature porn, seventy plus shit

Sickening, got you, what the fuck?
Cross your mug with a coffee cup
And when it cuts you, you stomach shift too

Punchline,YouTube Promotion Tracks,2016,"Aye yo Nebs
I think this is that flavour that's gonna
Look, (it's like) look, look

I'm feeling smoother than ever
I'm rocking Gucci with feathers
Should see me move man I'm clever
I got the movement in cheddar
I take a 2 add some letters
Another 2 5 together
That means the crew is forever
You never knew of it better
Spitter or rapper
Just stop the chitter and chatter
Flow live a shiv in the bladder
Kicked in the fucking' door
Like I ain't even heard of Aussie Rap
Now other rappers scratch their heads
Like ""Jesus Christ, what was that?""
He ain't say a barbeque or even mention politics
He did say that he wants us dead
Our baby mums can swallow dicks
It worked for him like fuckin' hell
His selling out his shows and shit
He ain't got no showman-ship
Cos he ain't gonna show men shit!
I hang around the type of cunts that stay hypin' up
They don't wanna fight for cash, they just wanna fight for blood
Do you like or love the reason why I rise above?
I'll slap your little sister down until she gets me - lighten up!

Punchline, yeah they waitin' on that
It took me 10 damn years to create where I'm at
So if you even have a thought of ya takin' it lad
Expects a fucking avalanche to be breaking your back

I'm crushing pills, use your pussy as a pill press
Then put a pussy on the pill, once the pill's pressed
I'm the ill yes
I'm the sickness
I'm the rapper keeping Aus alive, rappers still stressed
My price rised over a couple of months
3 massive tour, I can't even 'member the cunts
I got some boys that are loyal, they all got my back
So if you ever pop at me they gonna pop you back
Back, back, then back again
Until ya slap, trap, hacked
Then you wrapped in bin
I'm a Rap King
Half the age of what you call Rap Kings
They never want beef, they just call it a 'rap thing'
When Nebs was in jail, he was doing his stretch
I was working on the rhymes for the future I guess...
It's now x5


There's no effort in the shit that you do
It's quite obvious, that's why they don't listen to you!
I'm the Kers, controversial, 
drinking the purple
ABK, that the circle
Hater's getting murked
If I'm out of the club
I'm surrounded by cunts
So much pussy tryna touch me but I'm outta ya slut!
No times for the games, I'm strange in my brain
""04 on the train to the city again
Run a muck, back then, you could hear me flow
I've been out thinking that was almost 10 years ago!
I started from the streets, so that you know that it's real
And back then, ain't nobody gonna throw me a deal
So I got my hustle on, with the skill it was obvious
That I be running rap and I'm standing at the top of it!
There's the cocky shit
You wanted the young Kers
I could kill a motherfuckers life, in 1 verse!

Put it Back Together,,2012,"I've watched my life go and crumble
Then I put it back together
Swear to god I almost left but
Now I'll make this last forever
I just finished reading letters
From my boys that doing stretchers
I wrote back and sent my love I told them
Life can be a mess it's kind of hard
To move along and act like they ain't missing nothing
These the cards that we were given
Gotta turn this into something
So I
Blazed up wrote a rap just to help cope
Feeling buckled in the middle like a belt bro
Time flys move quick gotta keep up
Never in life will I touch another sweet puff
Cause these drugs are the devil in disguise
The music is the drug I need to get me through my life
Sounding corny tell me what will be the outcome
I still smoke weed, pop pills but I out done
Other shit so I threw it away
Woke up one morning, I won't do it today
And so I did and every day the picture kinda getting better
Cause I'm holding on my cheddar gotta double this forever
Life in the public
Said a lot of dumb shit
Done a lot of dumb shit but every time I tongue flip
It's magic and I'm saving lives
Two bad days means that I saved you twice
So hold on keep your head up
Stay staunch don't you fall and crumble
That's what they want fuck them all, don't let them try and burst your bubble
Light that weed and pour that drink and tell me what you gotta go for
This your life you just a you and don't you listen to a known whore
Break your heart and now you thinking, fuck it man this isn't worth it
You don't need it you just want it, move along and it be perfect
I ain't preaching what to do I ain't a hypocrite
Just gotta let you know in time you gonna flip the script
And fuck up like fuck fuck you fucked up
You dumb cunt don't tou-touch the glass glass
I've watched it ruin lives, turn the strong into the weak
Don't you touch that ice, have a bong and go to sleep
I felt the need to tell you you ain't really need to store it
Kids will hear their parents turn and blame me
Never said for you to touch it
I just told you I was messed up
And my raps are what my life is
So I had to go and fess up
Once again I talked my mind
And that is one thing they can't handle
Made mistakes but I bounce back
And now I'm here to light the candle
Make your own path don't you follow
Only you know who you is kid
People ask me what the rapper that I like to pump
I say myself because I do and I don't hide it nah
Sometimes this rapping feels like this the only shit for me
Then other days I hate it man it's got me spinning heaps
My flows sicker and you so so bitter, I'm a go go getter
You a no show let me...
Say another word I'm the truth with this
Move quick pass out like a roofie mix
Who is this now I'm covered in teeth marks
Everyone wanna bite me in these bars
Speak up you got something to say
Block your ears from my rap you get fucked in the face
Nothing remains and nothing is fake
You can judge me, I don't give a fuck cause I am being myself
You are fake and you don't know me so you cannot fuck with my words
Try to warn them I'm not playing I am taking over this shit
They ain't listen then it happened now they tripping bird I love it
Tell them I will never leave and then tell my fans that I love them
Tell them buy this, tell them buy that
Tell them I'm high and I'm laughing
I am gonna end this now cause I'm too stoned to continue
Too stoned to continue, too stoned to continue",https://genius.com/Kerser-put-it-back-together-lyrics
Put Life In Rap,King,2014,"Take it back guess theres certain shit you cannot
I thought some people had my back but they ran off
Hope you get the message that I'm sending across
Thought i knew where I was heading but I ended up lost
In the maze of the rap game its kinda like the crack game
Backstage chilling and somebody seen a strap, man
Why me why they worry what the Kers do
My rapping help so much that if I ever stop it hurts you
You won't admit that, you'll get you own chin tat
Saying that you'll shoot but didn't know the shotty kicks back
My phones tapped hope they listening close
Cos if I'm ever planning shit I won't admit it on phones
I never answer private numbers till my boys do the stretch
Keep my money on the books cos I am loyal to death
Still made it in the country had no radio yet
But I'll probably be the reason for the radio's death
Deadset

I don't wanna be the one
To break down and fall I'm reaching up
But I work so hard put life in rap
That equals cash and jealousy and knives in backs
And I just don't know if raps the same
Filled with fake gronks I never wanna rap again
I tried to say this shit yeah I did my best
No matter what real raps living in my flesh

Is it wrong I get a buzz when I show off my shit?
Pulling up in my car like you know what it is
Years ago they'd laugh, I was poor like dead broke
Then I got paid won't forget what they said, no
Driving in the fast lane, thinking bout my past man
Almost got trapped seeing life through the glass aye
Now I'm clean but I still smoke weed
Pop pills sometimes and still sip my lean
Used to get my ink by a cunt on the nod
And if we wanted more tats we would buy em a shot
Grow up round the block that a normal thing
You live a sheltered fucking life and ignore the shit
If you seen what I seen then likely you might be
Hearing what I'm saying do it day and do it nightly
We lived a different life mine did a 180
And my price is going up saying hi and pay me
Baby

I don't wanna be the one
To break down and fall I'm reaching up
But I work so hard put life in rap
That equals cash and jealousy and knifes in backs
And I just don't know if raps the same
Filled with fake gronks I never wanna rap again
I tried to say this shit yeah I did my best
No matter what real raps living in my flesh

This is me, this the truth its real
Got the rap, got the look and the street appeal
You meet fuckers like me hardly every in life
Since I dropped my first shit
I've been deadin' the mic
You should look into my eyes
See the truth the realness they feel this
I ain't gotta reveal shit
Its getting hard to stay real for all the fans
Cos the coppers listen to, they wanna shut down my plan
Tell the unders to fuck off I'm getting bundles I love us
And I ain't ever gonna stop from getting money I love it
So if I come in adumage that means I wasn't 100% in what
I told my missus so I'm not gonna fuck it
I've spent a lot my money on shit I got it I'm honestly sick
And its even better cos I know what the poverty is
So let me vibe out smoke a joint and lie down
Thinking bout my life wow is this really mine now?

I don't wanna be the one
To break down and fall I'm reaching up
But I work so hard put life in rap
That equals cash and jealousy and knifes in backs
And I just don't know if raps the same
Filled with fake gronks I never wanna rap again
I tried to say this shit yeah I did my best

Woke up and filled it with a rock now
With a rock now, with a, with with a rock now
Popped pills, it's real, we needing help now
Needing help now, needing, need needing help now
All alone, I've got to sit myself down
Sit my self down, sit my, sit sit myself down

My thoughts changing up, wait today I waited up
You light the pipe, ignite a rhyme and think you write creative stuff
But deep inside you try to hide anxiety that makes you nuts
Are we chasing fate, or fate will wait to make its way to us
Escaping when we're taking drugs, crave it like you crave for junk
Make you grab a safe and do a break so you can blaze it up
I've witnessed bitches scratch their wrists, itching till they're making cuts
Crazy cunts are dacking people, bashing their own babies mums
Is this the shit that's gonna rip, if that's the case I gave it up
Giving this admission its the hardest thing, I'm waking up
Are you gonna wait we both the same, same in the way that we go insane
Craving the taste of the base that we chase and I pray for the day that it goes away
I know complaining won't do shit and yeah its up to us
At least I'm honest, I ain't hiding most you cunts are suss
So stand here and watch me smash this fucking glass pipe

I'm zoning out and I got nowhere to run
Ain't gonna get a second chance and now I'm roaming with rum
I fight through what I'm going through, but what I'm going through if only two

We all know that you be in that better place
Member you was 12 me and boobs would get our drink on
You was in the garage asking us if we could spit songs
I think on
I think even further back
And even not so long ago you flipped when you heard the track
That I pressed record but still it ain't about Scott
Just wanted to let you know that man I swear to God it meant alot
We rep st Andrews you was there and you was down too
Now it's fucked up cause now they say it's where they found you it's not even right
That some gronk with a knife wouldn't drop it and fight now it's cost you your life nah
Keep your head up up in heavens where you now live
Want to let you know we sent your fam some flowers your presence had effect on everyone remembers you
So I sip my drink your still on earth we just pretend it's true

Bullshit dramas
They say it's over two cans
Someone pulled a knife they tried to be a big man
It ain't the same but so many feel ya pain
Written down in sentence man
I don't know what to say
You said you played my shit atleast like fifteen times a day
I swear to God when you said that I got goosebumps and walked away
I wasn't being rude I hope you never thought I was
You know I wasn't lad
I was shocked and had to walk it off
They tell me you was even scribblin' down your own rhymes
I heard ya dad found out about ya different phone lines
It's fucked up it not fair is God there
With much love
We got there
It's not rare
Lad he took you cause he picked you out of who you are
As much as people miss ya man he musta needed ya
You was younger but I had the chance to meet ya man
Light my spliffs hit my drink untill we ever meet again

Ain't spitten no hard rhymes
Night time your star shines
It ain't eazy but I guess it's a hard life
Wish you knew the impact
That you really did have
Your up there looking down feet up now sit back
This that
Dedication that is write for you
Kick back relax for you to listen to your boys keep telling me that you looked up to my rhymes and honestly it shouldn't but it really fucks with my mind
So the least I can do
Is release this for you
And play it so fucking loud that the speakers will blew
As I reach for a brew
And now I'm speaking to you
I'll state the obvious
You really leaving to soon
Your killers will get karma
Yip twice as harder

From the west to east they may respect and speak

Rap Now,Roll the Dice,2019,"Heard they lookin' when I came through
Heard they want me for my earrings and my chains too
Heard 'em talkin' 'bout it but they never make moves
Been through everything, there's no way I could break
Ain't no one alive that can tell me that I ain't real
They want my number 'cause my mates sold 'em fake pills
They say if nothin' change you then the fame will
I been famous ten years and ain't changed still
For the cash, what you fuckin' think I rap for?
I just chopped four pounds with a hacksaw
Mad raw, I'ma pick from where I left off
We were red hot and you were sittin' on your Xbox
Let me stop, poppin' pills in a new beemer
Organise a threesome in a two seater
Walked in to the club with my hat low
I charged double, gotta pay me for my shadow
These lads know I've been rocking the game
You know how many cunts got pussy just from droppin' my name?
Insane, just keep hatin' the Kers
I can't stop for no photos 'cause my mates will get searched
It's berserk

Everybody rap now
Either that or they sittin' in a trap house
Other half lost their mind or they cracked out
Sittin' back like ""Wow, this is rap now!""

Sittin' back like ""Wow, this is rap now!""

My heart's cold with that frostbite, right
When they stab me on the back, don't mean they got my spine
Been doin' this for years so when I drop my rhymes
Stop your bitch right in her tracks like she stopped by a sign
And I, I take aim, I maintain, I don't miss targets
I'm big-hearted, go too far when shit started
Rappers missin' like bird watchers and stumblin' crops
They get buried, my words toxic, I'm crushin' the lot
I grab the beat until it runs flat
Me and Kers always got a backup plan, ain't got one stash
I drop a  on your slut's back
And she can't find a  sole so she comes back, fun fact
And what they talkin' 'bout brother, yeah, we run that
I could mention shit from my past, thinkin' fuck that
Fuck lad, I was always clickin' like a Pump actsh'
Always lookin' down on rappers, gonna get a hunchback

I'm the sickest with rap, I swear a motherfucker's too smooth
You can't get cold feet wearin' new shoes
Translation: Ready for whatever bruh
Never met it better when I'm pennin' every letter, get a...

Chill check, talk down or assassination
Have you hidin' up inside like it's acid rainin'
I've been around  different dream
This is me, mean, but I'm beat down to smitherines
Two brothers bond strong, we a gifted team
When we in the room have you shakin' like your missus' knees
Plus we spin 'em all out when we spittin' frees
Respected, ask anybody in the scene

Everybody rap now
Either that or they sittin' in a trap house
Other half lost their mind or they cracked out
Sittin' back like ""Wow, this is rap now!""

Remain King,Next Step,2015,"Oi Dave
I just took four pills
Someone left 'em here
And I don't know what they were
My head's spinning
And the whole room's moving
I'm just gonna spit my verse
Look

My next interview, I'ma pull down my pants
Live on air like ""fuck the world, I'm doing a dance""
And I'm not from Adelaide so I don't say ""chance""
I'm a south-west Syd kid chopping plants
It's the way that I am, it's probably wrong to a few
But my music's for my fans, it's not offered to you
I'ma bust out verses perfect and I'm earning
Big fucking stacks, got these other rappers burning
You faggots never talk your shit to my face
It's always in the studio or you type on your page
But even that's coming to a stop, shit this is crazy
Probably 'cause they know I get 'em killed with your lady
""What up baby?"" winking her eye
I tell my killer ""send a photo of her drinking some dye""
Yeah, bleach her insides and put the mic up her arse
Twenty pills popped before I'm even writing my bars bitch

They see me shine, they see me win
It hurts their pride, I laugh inside
And they still whine 'cause I'm the kind to remain King
I run this scene
They see me shine, they see me win
It hurts their pride, I laugh inside
And they still whine 'cause I'm the kind to remain King
I run this scene

I got my roof rolled back, looking at the sky
You've got the who sold crack fucking looking eyes
What you know about flowing with rap
And earning so much you flip out when you owing em tax? (fuck)
'Cause my tax bill bigger than your yearly wage
I'm the lad still sipping on the clearest day
I'm the hash pill pimping like I'm here to stay
I'm the rash, got you itching 'cause you feel my pain
I make your head explode with just one of my rhymes
I'm like Andrew Johns on drugs in my prime
I'm like Mike eighteen round one when Pac died
To say I've got an attitude, you ain't even seen my dark side
Kers one, I ain't ever had to lay low
But you's did once Shoey fucking came home
We stay real with the crew till the end
Fuck your peace 'cause here we've got unity man and

Triple popping pills while they still in a saddy bag
I couldn't wait, if you ask I just had to lad
It's the way I am, yeah I'm on a detox
I'm getting tested, who wants to wee swap?
'Cause my piss filled with LSD
And I've never ever, ever, ever, ever been clean
They say the Kers gets repetitive
Well I like to blame that on the sedatives
Yeah I said it kid, don't fucking do drugs
Next minute biting belts as you shoot up
What the fuck? You ain't even listen lad
Now I've gotta write a whole new mission pat
To get cunts clean, throw jabs like Mundine
Holding knives in both hands, wanna make a cunt bleed
O plus G's, I'm sipping lean
I don't need a Nebs beat to be spitting mean, yep

Say they got your back, but they hatin', uh oh
Why we even shocked man?
Soon as I made it the face say god damn
They were spewin' and I knew it
What you doin'? Did you do it?
Why they copyin' my moves bro?
And this and that the same time, whats the rules yo
 Nah shit that's the cold game, relevant Kers never be a old name
And all the little bitches wanna come and suck your dick, it's like you never did exist shit
What's the difference, bitches sendin' pictures, bitches start bitchin' over bitches, did I hit this?
So I roll on fuck  platform, why you think half these rappers even have floor
They can have more, do what the Kers done, if i'm giving you advice then its word up
Listen up hear the way you got to do things, only roll with the crew you came through with
Ignore haters, get to the big biz, buy a house, get property, but with this, comes fake friends or even you closest, hate your doing while they turn before you notice

I'm giving you the run down
Tell you what the life like
Case you're thinking that you ever grabbing my mic

Never meant what they said, they hate you bro
Hate your new house, jewels, and your new car
They pretend cause' they wanna be friends
This the life I can't explain 'til I want it to end, yeah

 getting into drugs man this shit is a trap
Hold you back 'til you snap, and you struggle to rap
Or even struggle to write words, hit with a tight verse
If they racking up, make sure you watch them try first
Plus rappers are snakes, they don't like you
Don't let them in your ear they just hype you
When people turn, man they goin' wipe you
If i could go back they wouldn't be on my tune
And my moves were made out of nothing
I'd be down with the street had it pumpin
But that there brings trouble in it's own right, lucky i got moves that would shoot never know right
Plus i keep my blade tucked, cause' i'm paranoid, I ain't getting jumped by ten cunts I'm  boy
Media and websites shat on my name, cause' i was reppin a gang, and I just couldn't be tamed
They had me on the TV defending rap
And fuck Aussie rap, they won't defend you back
If you're taking advice, then take it from me
The Kerser same cunt that was selling tapes on the street
Never kissed ass, never sucked up to labels
Never bowed down, never fuck you I'm able to stand at the top and look what I fought through
Kers made it yeah, who would've thought true

Kerser
]
Hey, hey, I’m on this train Kerser
Wait ‘til we get off
Get off at Ingleburn bro
You gon’ be at the station or what?
I’m at the  shop man
Oh, what the fuck you doing there?
He makes  bro
Well, fuck  takin’ ages man
Yeah, I’ll send him now
Fuck, the cops are searchin’ everyone on this train
Don’t give any 

I take your funds back, I’m hunting for a hunch stack
You and your boys be walkin’ off your head down like a hunchback
I gotta run lad, no time for all the chit-chat
We skip that, I’ll come from Sydney, not near where the bridge at
I’m where the streets meet, you knew it, there’s no fakin’ man
Where cunts are probably scorin’ drugs if you think they’re just shakin’ hands
You fuckin’ back-peddled, why you got an axe settled?
Down, I think that liquor got you lippy but your facts never
Agree with what you talkin’ like you in 
We hold you up for  until you’re giving up your credit card (bitches)
‘Member growin’ up, we’d lie about where we were strong
‘Cause we live here then we die there and people treat us like it’s wrong
Why I talk the street shit? ‘Cause I’m from the street, shit
Thought they would’ve worked it out, I’m different like a remix
You need to call the quit and hail what’s in front of you
The man, the sickest spitter’s hittin’ bitches in the jugular

You ain’t walked in these shoes ‘til you’ve seen what I’ve seen
I think it’s fairly safe to say that you ain’t feelin’ like me
Hear the screams in the night ‘cause the streets are alive
With the sound of the fiends  fight
It’s like every time I take a step to where I need to go
They call me back to see these streets, they won’t let me go
Every time I take a step to where I need to be
They drag me back to the same fuckin’ scenery

The labels don’t ask us for favours, they’ve hated us
Since the day we moved across the blocks and ayy the coppers rated us
Snitches keep explainin’ the place that I live
I ain’t givin’ a fuck, you ridiculous cunts ain’t got my money that I ain’t ticking you up
One more step and I’m liftin’ you up off the ground like a hovercraft
Two more fiends arrive from the scene, some TVs and a shopping cart
I had to stop and laugh, I see ‘em every day
They tried the pipe and  the game, their reign was never the same
When  revvin’ the game, missed whatever her name is’ missus
Suckers, strangers do while he gives her a hit and makes her famous
The labour of love is brainless, we entertainers
Sell some dangerous drugs that make us feel like we’ve made it
‘Cause famous people takin’ this world, the arrangers makin’ ‘em sell
Now we’ve got a whole generation that’s raisin’ hell
Personally, I blame Chappelle Corby, she saw me packin’ bags
Accidentally put it by her book board, that’s a drag

You ain’t walked in these shoes ‘til you’ve seen what I’ve seen
I think it’s fairly safe to say that you ain’t feelin’ like me
Hear the screams in the night ‘cause the streets are alive
With the sound of the fiends  fight
It’s like every time I take a step to where I need to go
They call me back to see these streets, they won’t let me go
Every time I take a step to where I need to be
They drag me back to the same fuckin’ scenery

B-b-b-b-back to the scenery, you knowin’ what this means to me
I mean I don’t know nothin’ but the street is what it seems to be
You know the deal, the paranoia’s fuckin’ with my mind
I tap on my back fence and I get edgy huntin’ for the knives
The street’s to blame and so’s the drugs so who am I to say?
I’m probably better off to board a plane and hide away
I’ll try today but that’s a lie, ‘cause I ain’t ever leave
I’ma stay here ‘til they put me in the cemetery
I know the local dealers, local dealers know me too
Like fuckin’ with these dudes, think we don’t know  lose
You talk to coppers, talk to coppers then it’s not an option
For us to be mates, I don’t trust you so we got a problem
Gotta stop and drop and do whatever man has done
I got the answer son, what you gonna stand or run?
I’m back where I belong and on a mission once again
Mission to be killin’ all you rappers, yeah, you cunts are dead

You ain’t walked in these shoes ‘til you’ve seen what I’ve seen
I think it’s fairly safe to say that you ain’t feelin’ like me
Hear the screams in the night ‘cause the streets are alive
With the sound of the fiends  fight
It’s like every time I take a step to where I need to go
They call me back to see these streets, they won’t let me go
Every time I take a step to where I need to be
They drag me back to the same fuckin’ scenery",https://genius.com/Kerser-same-scenery-lyrics
Scott vs Kers,S.C.O.T.,2013,"This is Scott, Kers, let me have the verse
You always hog the spotlight, you forgot that I grab the words
You ain't really that cunt, thinking that you mad fuck
You still the same chap smoking cones, you wouldn't have lunch
But oh the fame, how it's playing with your brain
You're rhyming single syllables and everything is lame
What happened to the passion in the rapping in your actions
Lately make me think your crazy lazy, thinking like your knacked
And it's sad you, bombed yourself with tattoos
Think you're in a bad crew, look at you, you sad move
Let me have my life back, I stab myself like die rap
Kerser on your face, the ink got placed, we'll never dry that
Right there was a scream for help
And every track you drop, you saying that you're being yourself
You're a fucking liar addict, pop a pill you isn't magic
Kind of tragic, your obsession being fresh
You're just a maggot
I don't want your fucking car, your fucking shoes, the fucking whole lot
Let me take my brain and have my life back as the old Scott
You're a fucking fame whore, run away in pain or
Go and jump on stage raw, have another eight more
Of them Xannies your anxiety's pathetic
And your writing ain't a message, 'cause you're finding you'll regret it
But it's our sercet and it's burning you admit it
You fucking junkie pull your head in, call yourself the sickest dickhead

Ha ha ha
It's Kerser, the sickest
Ahh, I think Scott's tripping out a bit
I'll break it down, this is the truth

It's Kers one, the fucking miracle from birth
And Scottie getting angry 'cause he's fearing all the work
Think about it Scott, you could barely hold a job
And I made the rapping happen, now you're feeling like you're lost
You fucking took a backseat, I went and rang the baller
State to state, I'm working late of course I'm going to score drugs
Without the Kers, you'd still be in the fucking gutter
Bludging off your mother, even taking money from your younger brother
You hate the arrogance, it took you as a shock too
Don't let these people, try to tell you that I'm not you
I represent the struggle, you're the drug you couldn't hustle
I'm your only fucking talent, shit I hate to burst your bubble
Imagine life without me, you wouldn't have a house g
I threw the g in there to match that single syllable ouchie
Come an took it over now, you fucking schizophrenic
Remember when you made a prayer to God about me that's pathetic
And fucking oath I pop pills, I roll blunts, I got bills
But they all pay 'cause Kerser took control so what is Scott still?
The one to make it better, you're a fucking joke admit it
Kerser one I'm signing out ill end with the sickest dickhead

So which one am I? Should I choose to end it all?
Call a mate? I mean ain't that what all your friends are for?
I'm fucking so lost, I don't know what's what
Day by day, I live for Kers, I'm feeling like now Scott's lost
But this is Scott right or just scared of the spotlight
Living like he's living, every day I'm feeling Scott hides
But that's it i mean its sure to hurt
Kind of making sense why they fucking call you Kers, reverse",https://genius.com/Kerser-scott-vs-kers-lyrics
Secret Society,S.C.O.T.,2013,"Yeah
Let me take you to my past for a second
Look

I thought everything was sweet, it was only nine o’clock
In the morning got a warning, copped a caution from a cop
Walking down the street with a spliff in the lip
Ridiculous copped the fine for the littlest bit
Like a tenner, I'm away, I keep walking dare I say
I popped a annyxay and ate a massive plate of anyways
So it's half past nine now I’m copping a call
On my phone from a mate and I’m not even sure
Who it is, 'cause I’m smashed I'ma sit have a chat
This that, sick lad gotta jet hit me back
I move along I heard the dealer got done
By like four different cunts with a kill on the run
Now I’m thinking okay so I can’t get blazed
And I ain't got a cent, now I’m in a desperate way
This all before the fame so I’m boarding a train
Bomb the floor with the paint, had a brawl copped a blade
Got away, okay with a scar on my cheek
'Cause every day in the past so I’m beginning to creep
Around your house or the shop and I’m robbing the place
I ain't wanna be a bum so I gotta get paid
Life of a struggler, drugs couldn’t hustle nah
I'll get a batch then it's gone without a customer
The shit shit changed once I hit the booth
Let me tell ya now days so sick it's true

So what, After that the shit changed man
Fuck bro.. you ain't heard fucking hell let me
Tell you about it.. ready?

I woke up about half past nine
I had a rather big night, felt like half of it right
But these days every hand i shake they giving me
E’s, Coke, Weed and base
So everything new 'cause I’m getting the pay right
News shoes, clothes, car heard from the grape vine
I'm on the verge of illuminisation, wait forget that I was told not to say shit
Couple grand blown in the pokie machine
I didn’t even get to play it I was smoking the green
They went to kick me out and seen the “Kers” on my face
They pat me back, gave me double started turning away
And also these days bitches hanging to fuck
There's like fifty million of em fucking praying for nuts
Are these bitches dumb they ain't heard about my girl?
They can go find a wanna be 'cause I’m loyal
Getting big money almost every day
YouTube on its own got me staring at pay
Not including merch, shows, CDs or iTunes
Spending money quick come see how I do

So what's with all this talk of the secret society?
Woah, woah, what? Shut the fuck up man, what the fuck's that shit?

I woke up now about seven o’clock
Nice and early in a suit, 'cause of the message I got
Two fellas one was  and the other was 
Kinda weird 'cause I ain't ever heard of them and dem
And then they talk a lot of business in the shit that I got
I thought fuck it man I’ll meet em go and give it a shot
Met em at the place, the shit was place a palace
They flew another three business peeps out of Dallas
Got to talking and I ain't saying to much
But I can say for now I'll be caking in bucks
Sign the paper then I leave, like they owning me now
I know you probably thinking but they owning you how?
I can’t say to much when I’m writing this rhyme
'Cause this verse right here put my life on the line
But you can come to my house illuminate in the sunshine
How many heads can I fly with a punch line?
Made a little deal I can get my mates
So I mention a bit about to Nebs and Rates
Nebs was like what the fuck man I heard of that shit
Rates agreed fucking oath go and work with it quick
So they on the verge of joining, wait I ain't really mean that
Ratesy got a beamer lined up you should see lad
Nebs cut me there I think i did screw up
Bruz you told everybody way to much cut",https://genius.com/Kerser-secret-society-lyrics

Cruisin' with a fucking ride on lawnmower
At your front door with a fucking horn blower
Why they all talk then they can't say shit?
You as gay as a Triple J playlist
I'm-a drop C4 on the stairway
If they ever think of giving me some airplay
Rather have my dick stuck in an exhaust pipe
Than hear a bunch of faggots talking like some blonde dykes
I'm the Aussie rapper that be raising the bar
The proof is in the pudding check my place and my car
Skill is right in front of ya, aiming for ya jugular
Take your adam's apple out then I start to jungle bruh
I'm-a double up everything I make cuz
I'm at the point where I enjoy it at the bank bruz
And you can talk all your shit about ABK
But when you do it can you please make it face to face?

You were scared but your missus had a slight grin
I'm like man I be running the game
These other cunts ain't shit they just running my name
I got a gun and a blade I'm out the front of you place
I'm like come inside then they end up running away

See You Again,Engraved In The Game,2017,"Man
The amount of people that have come into my life then left
Came back, left again
Talked shit, tried to come back again
Tried to use me for money
Tried taking advantage of my kindness
Tried switching sides
Tried tellin' me they'd always be down for me
But the people talk down to me
I just wanna say there's no hard feelings
Only 'cause I won
Check

Had to guts a couple cunts off, it wasn't nothing personal
It felt like I left my brain at a terminal
Sometimes I gotta get away from the spotlight
It feels like your freedom gone and you hold tight
And you just pushing for the final result
Like me when 
No Rest
 dropped I felt I'm finally on top
You got to fight through the dark days, they looking even darker
You focus on the now, you gotta focus on the after
That's the thing I learned, think I contradict myself
I'm so lost in this game, I could shoot myself
I've got to got to get my head clear, it's feeling fogged up
We was trippin' when I made it, yeah it shocked us
Even though I put the plan into process
Every rapper seen me winnin' yeah, it's progress
I make moves every year that are top notch
In case you're wondering why I got the top spot

In it for the long haul, ain't a way to turn back
If I got it then it's proof that I earned that
Trying to find a place stress don't exist at
Where my mind can turn off and just kick back
It ain't found yet, I'm lookin' on the bright side
The time goes quick, I'm watchin' it fly by
But on me and I'm here until the end, yeah
Check the history, Kers set the trend, yeah
My first step I was chasin' up history
My second step I was learnin' how to get get cream
My third step, had it mastered, it was easy
My fourth step, at the top is where you see me
My fifth step was my best step, ""Next Step""
My sixth step was the sickest shit yeah
Step seven you are listening in
I guess it's step eight where I see you again

Overcome everything to get where I'm at
Will the next generation be reminded of that?
Or will I be another rapper on a broken record?
That's impossible because I went and broke the records
And the blueprint, they all start to use shit
Which is cool, just remember who was doin' it
I set the path first you ain't got to ask nerds
I'ma be me, probably be my last words
Feel the beat, feel the flow, got the flavour
I fell in love with this before I made it major
And you can ask anyone who knew me back then
I was sayin' I'ma make it with the rappin'
Had the passion, the force of a tidal wave
So fuckin' oath, I deserve to have the shine today
Is it worth it? I'ma let you judge though
Most days, your answer endin' with a fuck no

In it for the long haul, ain't a way to turn back
If I got it then it's proof that I earned that
Trying to find a place stress don't exist at
Where my mind can turn off and just kick back
It ain't found yet, I'm lookin' on the bright side
The time goes quick, I'm watchin' it fly by
But on me and I'm here until the end, yeah
Check the history, Kers set the trend, yeah
My first step I was chasin' up history
My second step I was learnin' how to get cream
My third step, had it mastered, it was easy
My fourth step, at the top is where you see me
My fifth step was my best step, ""Next Step""
My sixth step was the sickest shit yeah
Step seven you are listening in
I guess it's step eight where I see you again

Overcome everything to get where i'm at
I fell in love with this before I made it major
And the blueprint they all start to use, shit
Just remember who was doing it",https://genius.com/Kerser-see-you-again-lyrics
Sickest For Life,,2014,"Back pack packed in the back of a black car
Cash strapped dacked life of a rap star
Haters get hacked and collapse when they bashed brah
You see life change when you start getting cash huh
I sense the jealousy I'm used to it now
I see 'em watching sussing out all my movements and how
I rose up to the top
They gon' copy those moves
But there's only one Kerser
Is there possibly two?
Because I get these mood swings
And I'm lost in a twist
My brain rage, tell my mind to pop a shot at your wig
The music scene used to hate me, but that has changed lately
Got everyone intrigued, but they don't know if to rate me
I'm smoking spliffs through the city pumping 2Pac
Three cars in a line you watch us move cuz
Sipping Sprite but the colour had a tune up
New everything, but fuck wouldn't you bruz?
Flip rap like its crack money generates
Since I learnt that you know I went and get it mate
Still the freshest cunt to pick up a mic
If you try to spit my shit you start to hiccup and die
I'm the sickest for life
I put my dick in your eye
So you can see me fucking coming
Gotta pick up your pride
Never listen to hate
I fucking shit on your plate
And wipe my ass with that bullshit that you think is your wage
I bottled up I let it out, we the kings of the scene
Even if they dissing, guarantee they still listen to me
Plus I've never been confronted by a hater in real life
They talking on the net so I don't know what that feels like
Weak gronks I fucking proved I'm a boss
Check the units when you can I'm fucking moving a lot
No ones done what I've done
You mean its not right to brag?
Well Ima brag until they take this spot light off my back
I toured hard for a while I was barely at home
I told my girl i gotta get it I'm aware in my zone
And then I came home like aye, what can we buy?
I swear to God that's what I said and I'm not gonna lie
The rap hustle got it down and the timing was right
I got everything you need labels dying to sign
To say the best in the biz yo they call that a hardcore
But how, lets compare who was helped at the start or
Ima leave it for these fuckers to work out
I'm in your brain, engrave my name I'm writing the Kers proud
Remember when i started I would dream of this shit
Now I'm here lets celebrate whats it mean when you spit
And now they making up rumours with some negative comments
But i got their fucking sister hooked with sedative problems man
ABK still the crew that I rep
I could tell a couple stories but I chose to reject
Because theres shit not made for music
Plus the coppers are watching
They trying to close in but there isn't a problem
Investigator, fuck you I'm out here the sickest
One thing on my mind now I'm out to get the digits bitches",https://genius.com/Kerser-sickest-for-life-lyrics
Sink Or Swim,Engraved In The Game,2017,"Yeah
Smoking upto this

They were in school I was selling mix-tapes
Broke as fuck life was a mystery
Hit the bucks now they start dissing me
Let's take it back to the rest of Sydney
Eighteen livin' a dream
Around about the time that I met my queen
I struggle for this weighing more than them
On a train seventeen recording then
Tracks on the wet blew up like a monster
Made history because I made new genre
Over the addict but the kill went all
With the chady of shoes that I ever could've walk
But I didn't give a fuck because the dream was there
Thirty of us yeah the team was there
Let me take a sec I got event
Let me show you why they calling me a fucking vet
Got the best flow that you ever could've heard
The time the trip because I wasn't the nerd
Go back to the start you calling me chat
Now they hit me up for money like a balling lad
You weren't at the start on strictly day one
ABK was the shit we came from
Stick to a few comments I'm liking her
Comon wake up you are dealing with kers
Can't affect I'm the blazing type
Type write type lines insanely right
I might try fight these lines to slight
The heart my life these lines are bright
Travel around the king in town
When you rap talk they gonna try bring you down
But my head held high I'm the beast for sure
25k minimum bitches what and I'm

Came so far we made it bruz
Grow so high it's dangerouz
Time goes by it's saving us
Started with nothing now making us
Fresh shit blokes are staying around
Something turned to haters now
ABK came two to win
Got two options sink or swim

Round two never knew I have done this far
2008 they were laughing bruh
Why stunts so hard throw my shit off
Only with the crew when it's time to lift off
Drift off on some nice on the mic that
I'm writtin' on my life that might be and write
I'm out look to life look upto me
I look upto blue skies while I'm puffin trees
Who the fuck are we? Do you want company?
When only one in three can get trust for me
Don't make sense in the end for cunts
We used to scrape up change that's adventurous
And walk around chat cunts that meant for us
Get drunk on a train than catch a bus
But I broke that mould it was so so cold
And it won't go fold take a photo hold
Imma get you up-to date
In-case you missed out how I got here mate
Blacklisted from radio labels kept on saying no
Till I got this show my shit sell crazy
Still selling out that everybody ever make me
Still fucking bottom I'm saying it",https://genius.com/Kerser-sink-or-swim-lyrics
Slimy Game,Engraved In The Game,2017,"[Verse 1: Fortay & 
Kerser
]
Started bummy, dirty, maxis jumpin' fuckin' taxis
Just to bust the studios, couple grams in a saddy
Was a dream, rappin', what I seen, had no option B
On the street, doin' what I had to 'cause I gotta eat
No need to stop the beat, what, have they forgotten me?
The skinny cunt they used to laugh at, need my pockets deep
But I was scrapin' up, never knew 'bout makin' bucks
Sippin' on a drink, no ride then I would take the bus
Blazin' pipe, gettin' drunk, highest spitin' flows
Didn't know as kids, went from  to headin' shows
Sellin' sticks to sellin' this, losin' faith and havin' hope
Of stackin' dough instead of sacks of smoke. 
Now we on the road
In the state, I've turned this shit into a business, mate
Gettin' paid while critics say ""better this than flippin' Wayne""
Different place, every weekend, peakin' off my face
Caught up in the music, better that than by the coppers, ayy
Top the charts, I did my thing, I'm back up in the booth
 second album track 
Set the sound for the scene, we had the streets buzzin'
Seems enough from puffin' weed with stars ""is this a dream or something?""

It's been too long, we were runnin' to the big dream
And when we found it, it was nothin' like we did think
Friends turn, rappers act, this the slimy game
And when we leave, guarantee they never find the same
It's been too long, we were runnin' to the big dream
And when we found it, it was nothin' like we did think
Friends turn, rappers act, this the slimy game
And when we leave, guarantee they never find the same
[Verse 2: Kerser & 
Fortay
]
'Cause I'm sittin' at the top, they think the view is great
I started makin' money then started losin' mates
A few snakes along the way, spot the true from fake
Gave this everything we got and still refuse to break
I went from battlin' to up in Channel Ten
From takin' mug shots to havin' cameramen
From bustin' shots to doin' shoots upon the movie set
Through the stress, rep the west, on my feet, can't lose a step
The fucking truest yet, what, you cunts forgot?
We done a lot and we still be sittin' at the top
Rap scene was a dream, seein' drama come from cash and 
While fiends smokin' meth, it ain't all it's cracked out to be
Sounds easy but it's tougher than you'll ever know
They love it when you're broke but hate you gettin' dough
Started hungry, bummy, no money, could've been a junkie
But I beat the obstacles and never found broke bein' funny
Went from spittin' those, tryna flip my  money
To out doin' shows, tourin' the whole country
Seen too many come and go, I never thought I'd earn a grand
Rappin' made it happen, never victims to our circumstance

It's been too long, we were runnin' to the big dream
And when we did, it was nothin' like we did think
Friends turn, rappers act, this the slimy game
And when we leave, guarantee they never find the same
It's been too long, we were runnin' to the big dream
And when we did, it was nothin' like we did think
Friends turn, rappers act, this the slimy game
And when we leave, guarantee they never find the same
It's been too long, we were runnin' to the big dream

Smokin' Up,King,2014,"I fuckin' been here before
I got the pigs at the door
I'm pumping 2Pac Shakur
And to the dogs I don't talk
But cunts are sussing me out
They tell me prove what I bought
I tell em check the fucking charts
They accuse me of more
I need these cunts off my back
I just wanna get high
But it feels like they gon' follow till the day that I die
Get the fuck from the front, cunt
I smell like success I fuckin' hip hop while its dry
Yeah I'm smelling the sex
I'm feeling the stress yet I'm still feeling the edge
My eyes are red blood shot and I built my defense
I'm getting chased by these models
While you be paying at brothels
But I'm only lighting hoes if they came with a bottle
I'm the man of the  moment
Man my moment is potent
I'm exploding I wrote it
That means its only the dopest
You know that...

I don't need another chance to prove myself
I  put the street shit on the map
Yea we did it ourselves
We get high, we get high
And I'm aiming for the stars
I was broke as fuck
Now I'm getting that money still smokin' up
We get high, we get high

I start ironing your face
So we can get some shit straight
I've been fucking killing rap since I dropped my mixtape
I'm going hard with the rap, if I gave half of it back
I'd still be running Aussie hip hop still I'm laughing at Jacks
That's why they all listen, from the kids in the commission
To the people running businesses, I got Australia spinning
Watch me ball hard, imma show it all of
With my middle finger up, like look at what you don't got
I'm rockin' city to city I'm rockin' flight to flight
I ain't like none of these rappers probably fight tonight
Yea I got it like that, I swear I'm living life laugh too
I'm driving round the city and my car got a glass roof
Rose up from the gutter a bit of bread and some butter
But I never need nada did this shit on my oda
Need to say it anymore let me jump up the crime rate
Buy and sell guns I'm just wasting my time mate

I don't need another chance to prove myself
I  put the street shit on the map
Yea we did it ourselves
We get high, we get high
And I'm aiming for the stars
I was broke as fuck
Now I'm getting that money still smokin' up

So You Did Leave,The Nebulizer,2011,"I found the note you left, I think that it’s a weak way
To say your feelings, you were lying to me each day
You even told me you would stick no matter what went
But I took you for granted, now I lost it
I keep my head up, I’ma show you what you’re missin’ girl
I’ma make you wanna go and find a different world
The jealous type but I don’t care if we ain’t nothin’ right
I’ma flip if you in photos with another guy
You a snake and I got wounded with the venom, no
All my groupie tellin’ me I gotta let it go
But it ain’t easy when I’ve wasted years of my life
You said you need me, now you play it as a white lie
Why I try with the effort and all that
When you ain’t send a lazy message or call back
I fall flat ‘cause I’m sittin’ alone
And I want revenge ‘cause you told me that it won’t end

So you did leave? You couldn’t help me?
So long, you’re gone, I couldn’t tell the
Other half of my brain that it won’t work
Try to hide I’m in pain, but I’m so hurt
So you did leave? You couldn’t help me?
So long, you’re gone, I couldn’t tell the
Other half of my brain that it won’t work
Try to hide I’m in pain, but I’m so hurt

Stressed out, I ain’t hidin’ the fact
It took a bottle of the black to be writin’ this rap
So I lightin’ the lads, like “I ain’t carin’ no more”
You took it all and I fall as I wait for the call
Now I could call you up but I ain’t gonna do that
I’m missing, need you here, yeah, I’m sayin’ I need you back
True fact, the morning you left
Had me feelin’ like I lost a soul or mournin’ a death
Now all that is left got me surrounded by sluts
‘Cause it’s nothin’ without you, name the housin’ wouldn’t touch it
So I’m sleepin’ on the lounge at my mate’s place
I can take you back, I’m sure that we can go and make space
Don’t say late ‘cause I haven’t slept in eight days
When I close my eyes, I can only see my babe’s face
Start chokin’ yep, I’m heartbroken
I’d pay to see your smile, hear your laugh I’m hopin’

So you did leave? You couldn’t help me?
So long, you’re gone, I couldn’t tell the
Other half of my brain that it won’t work
Try to hide I’m in pain, but I’m so hurt
So you did leave? You couldn’t help me?
So long, you’re gone, I couldn’t tell the
Other half of my brain that it won’t work
Try to hide I’m in pain, but I’m so hurt

I’m blamin’ you for what I’m goin’ through and only you
Would know the reason why I’m sittin’ here with only two
Dollars to my name, here we go again
Starin’ at an empty bottle, barely stay insane
I’m blamin’ you for what I’m goin’ through and only you
Would know the reason why I’m sittin’ here with only two
Dollars to my name, here we go again
Starin’ at an empty bottle, barely stay insane

Speak of That,YouTube Promotion Tracks,2012,"Pulled up in a nice car
New jeans new shoes lookin' nice huh?
Write raps on my iPhone
Got your bitch in the front she wants to drive home
I came quite a long way
I get paid cause the people that my song play
Touch down from a plane trip
Skinny cunt weigh heaps cause my name big
Ice cubes with the OJ
Codeine pop everything is okay
Haters trying to bring my name down
Won't happen cause they cannot match the fame now
And my earlobes glow nice
Tattoos home-job but they so right
Short hair with the three lines
My style yeah I'm rocking them on each side
Used to be a poor cunt
Wrote raps got paid now it's all love
I'm the come up never come down
Yeah you tell me who's looking like a bum now
Begging for a rap out
Rocky IV I'm 'bout to lay the smack down
Cleaner than a brand new
Do more for a brand than a brand do
G-shock that my wristwatch
Look down my time and they pissed off
Hat rest on the eyebrows
Street swag too hot better lie down
Out of hell like meatloaf
Green bag green smoke with the green notes
Loyal to my roots though
Came back to the hood with a true flow
Ride beats like a corvette
Hit stage make you wanna finish your set
Kerser inked on the jawline
Name so heavy that I kind of got a sore spine
Skill I'm the real though
Hurt cunts like a knife on a dildo
Take a stab and you lose quick
Real talk I ain't  even gotta do shit
Thick notes with a white stain
Cocaine marked up, stop the migraine
Got a joint in my smoke pack
Speak of that yo I think I'm gonna smoke that
Got bars that are too dope
Spit these and they leave you with a bruised throat
AB to the AK
Two 2's with a 5 what you say mate
You're girl wink her eye bah
I reply with a 'hi' and a 'bye slut'
Too good with the rap shit
One flick start a fire like a matchstick
Style what it is now
Told them stand up now they won't sit down
Fans know the G-O
Kers rap and he's simply in the beast mode
Hate me it's all good
I got a fuck load of fans for you it's awkward
My shit straight shines
Let it sink in
It might take time
Now I'm rocking big shows
Sell 'em out fucking oath watch me spit flows
So clean sick yes sir
Raps my bitch you wish I never met her
Fuck her and I get paid
You pay to fuck
So press play
Ride just behind the bass bitch
Earphones hurt head like a facelift
Cause I speak too toxic
Put your track next to this you ain't got shit
Kick flows like a psycho
That's magic from hitting notes on my phone",https://genius.com/Kerser-speak-of-that-lyrics
Stand Up,No Rest For The Sickest,2012,"There's only one Kerser ever ever will be,
Rap sick with a style so clean that its filthy
None of them can kill me, riding in the ill beast
Whopped on its arse thought you said you couldn't steal these
But we crucify a beat with the same plates
Spinning out the bitches as we pull up to a mate's place
What you know about the streets and the ram raids
Lads are getting hungry for the money, need the damn pay
Me? I'm a rapper though one of you make dough
Run with crew ayo, everything's OK though
Sick with it brah, you can't deny I'm mad fresh
I'm Colgate with Tic Tac, you running with that bad breath
Couldn't match my style, I'm too over the top
They download your shit, for me they go to the shops
I'm so confident, 'cause I got ears too
I can hear myself rap I know I'm the fucking shit true

Stand up, come and mark your place
Never fall down, never find a darker space
If they here for the night let 'em ride for free
Get the pipes lit, let 'em come and ride with me
Stand up, come and mark your place
Never fall down, never find a darker space
If they here for the night let 'em ride for free
Get the pipes lit, let 'em come and ride with me

Haters talk but they never be a real threat
Real debt, go and get a loan and get me killed yep
Heard it all before, you just a dumb fuck
You wouldn't pull the trigger, why the fuck you got a gun tucked?
All bark, no bite, me bark, go bite
Fellas do it for me, I ain't even have to go right
Real rap Sydney, the South West kid be
Lifting shit, upper level when I spit, see
Another ten sides of me that you probably gon' try to be
But you couldn't get high as me so why you even fight with me?
Never made sense, never get a HSC
'Cause I'm patiently, wait for pay and
Tell me how a man, who couldn't make grade ten
Lives off the words, tell me why I need a grade then
Fucking A, now fucking B-K
Get 'em up high, let em know we the team ay

Stand up, come and mark your place
Never fall down, never find a darker space
If they here for the night let 'em ride for free
Get the pipes lit, let 'em come and ride with me
Stand up, come and mark your place
Never fall down, never find a darker space
If they here for the night let 'em ride for free
Get the pipes lit, let 'em come and ride with me

Don't talk just know your roll
So Kers but I still gotta owe my soul
If you in for the life come and sign away
Need some time away, I need to hibernate, damn
Don't talk just know your roll
So Kers but I still gotta owe my soul
If you in for the life come and sign away
Need some time away, I need to hibernate, damn

Stand up, come and mark your place
Never fall down, never find a darker space
If they here for the night let 'em ride for free
Get the pipes lit, let 'em come and ride with me
Stand up, come and mark your place
Never fall down, never find a darker space

Start A War,Tradition,2016,"Look at my name, Look at my fame
Came a long way had my foot in the drain
Look I’m the same, you’ll get pushed in your face
If you try to snap a photo when I’m looking away
Cooking your brain I’m not paying for this
Making big coin off covers off an iPhone bitch
That’s more than you, and your album too
Stop bragging like your earning off music dude
It’s a shame when they lose ‘cause I always win
Everyone says take over, hold it in
I’ve heard them all say it ten times before
They can’t get near me man they make me bored
I hate ‘em all, I’m just stating facts
You getting lap to lap like a racing track
You can hate some more, I’m the holy sound
Blessed by God, let me hold it down
Amen

Pick it up now we the kings of this
Ripping up town when we hit the gigs
Spitting that sound, they addicted quick
What they gonna do? They can’t quit the shit
Throw ‘em all in, now they want some more
If I go quiet then they start a war
They want our sound ‘cause we save them all
Back to the boredom, getting payed galore

Look at my chain, Look at me main
Don’t stare too long, you’ll get hooked with a blade
They my boys and they paranoid
And they don’t trust you, you don’t have a choice
So don’t stand too close if you’re arking up
You’re a dog check the tree you’re barking up
Back by the best, ABK for life
Plus I got some close friends that are out on bikes
Enough of that, now back to rap
And fuck Drake too, I’m going back to back
Topping charts is just what I do
Radio still hating, try to block the crew
On top of yous we rock it through
To any of my gigs, What you popping dude?
Kerser one, it’s album six
Still ghetto, with a pounding stitch

Pick it up now we the kings of this
Ripping up town when we hit the gigs
Spitting that sound, they addicted quick
What they gonna do? They can’t quit the shit
Throw ‘em all in, now they want some more
If I go quiet then they start a war
They want our sound ‘cause we save them all
Back to the boredom, getting payed galore

ABK
We run this
Stay away
We done shit

Pick it up now we the kings of this
Ripping up town when we hit the gigs
Spitting that sound, they addicted quick

I'm in waterfalls, trippin' on a biggish cloud
I try reminisce but it's so distant now
I'm still up
Gettin' what I'm owed from the music scene
I keep recouping as I live my dream

All of youse here, did you write me off?
Would you still have my back if I might be wrong?
Were you there at the start where the nights were long?
When I was the odd one out without Nikes on?
Who's here to save the day?
I do this for the fam and the ABK
But lately, it feels like crazy days
I'm tryna put shit off to a later day
Am I lost? Have I just had a gutful?
Yellin' out ""fuck you"", find it hard to trust you
Heard enough ""love you""s, heard enough ""hate you""s
Heard enough ""one, two""s, check when I came through
How many stages you think I've rocked?
Before the sold out tours, who'd think I'd stop?
Just as I blew, we had the crew get locked
So I made them a promise, I'ma climb to the stop
And then what?

Will I ever be the same?
Went by rule, I caught the fame
Mission was for better days
I'm so fly
So fly
Is it ever gonna change?
Different state or different stage?
I'm so fly

We gon' ride, yeah, I'm out for you
I just poured more mix in a Mountain Dew
G-O-A-T, that ain't new
And you know they gonna hate, cousin, that ain't true
I'm too fresh
Fresher at the fresh till I meet my death
No breath, passed out with a smoker chest
I smoke, yes, don't stress, they gon' float the rest
I'm mad high
I'll bring a buzz to anything
My name on it's worth it man
Showed you how the Kerser lived
Fell in love, you stayed around
You witnessed me go make a sound
I really built this from the ground
Don't be actin' out now, you know the steez
I'm at a business meetin', smokin' weed
There has never been a rapper who has  me
Out of any Aussie rapper, man, they're quotin' me
Facts, big buds wrapped up in the Glad Wrap
I don't sell 'em, I just smoke 'em on my backpack
Got enough green in the 
The game ain't on fire till I say it's on
Don't you tell 'em you gon' downplay my shit
Not today, 'cause I'm runnin' with a knife tip
No shit, it's back to front
Poke you with the handle, you get slapped with blood
Don't play no games, put my life in this
It deep pumps my heart and my writin' lives
Through the mind of the listener once again
Got my 15 oz, scull it one to ten

Lost track by now, I don't even know who I blame

Top flows great way, that's the way Scott
Got foes hate and still give me props
I'm a underground specimen my fuckin' sound's wreckin' 'em
I gutter bound, neckin' 'em, I'm runnin' 'round a better man
Heavy stand, not a motherfuckin' steppin' stone
Leave the talk, skill on beats, that's how I get it known
You giving short straws, still gotta walk tall
Work with what I got, see me ending up on your door
We'll stay here smashed as the waves now crash
And if I made this cash, I'm askin' where's the beer at

Never be your stepping stone
Take it all or leave me alone
I will never be your stepping stone (You know man)
Take it all or leave me alone

When types of public hate, ayy, mate you feel this
I hang around crooks, riders, sleeves and dealers
So come and twist spliffs with these misfits
And please dismiss 'cause we be the sick shit
Wise up, life's tough, seems I need to find drugs
Every second day get a call, you wanna buy bruz?
Minds fucked but I'm facin' facts
I found peace in the past now i'm racing back
Place a trap, trip, fall, are you wantin' more?
'Cause my missions getting pissed till i'm on the fuckin' floor
Bust it raw, fuckin' poor man, you gotta buck or more
Laugh it up brother, dead set, you gotta buck or more
Unemployed, manage pay rent every week
And I drink every day from lunch to when I sleep
That's no exaggeration man, my mind is captivation
Like the nineties rap sensation, they my idols to this day man
So I roll with the punches, a dole paid my lunches
I hold when it crunches running up in the dumpsters
Bang I'm in need, my tanks on the e
No thank you from me, keep grazing your knees, cocksuckers

Never be your stepping stone
Take it all or leave me alone
I will never be your stepping stone
Take it all or leave me alone
I will never be your stepping stone
Take it all or leave me alone
I will never be your stepping stone
Take it all or leave me alone
I will never be your stepping stone
Take it all or leave me alone
I will",https://genius.com/Kerser-steppen-stone-lyrics
Still Haven't Changed,Next Step,2015,"In a lane of my own and it's lame 'cause they clone
They ain't ever being happy, they just hate on the low
You can't take from my flow, I'm the medicine needed
At the start it was hard, they weren't ready to see it
But I pushed past the hate and I brang the whole crew too
Money made me have to pick who I should trust, ooh
Still with the crew, yeah I stay with my Day ones
They didn't change even once they see the pay come
And I'm still stressing over what I should do
Like I just wanna be happy, lock myself in a room
And give my life to you, from the words that I wrote now
Save another bunch of kids, make 'em put the rope down
They thank me for that, yeah it made me react
And save another fucking life when they playing my tracks
And the fan mail brings a fucking tear to my eye
I just want my fans to know I'll be here 'til I die, it's fine

Riding with my seat back, crew got the heat dacked
Still haven't changed, last album gotta beat that
Still here for my fans all the time
All you gotta do is hit play, stop and rewind
Still with the dream that makes me complete rap
Still haven't changed, passed out on the beach smashed
Still here for my fans all the time
All you gotta do is hit play, stop and rewind

I was in a cold state, six Xannies a day
Wash it down with some lean
Did I damage my brain?
I probably did in the long run and back when the bong come
Fifteen years old, cold sweats 'cause I want one
I knew back then shit wasn't all right
I didn't tell no one, I kept it bottled inside
Long story short man, weed led to other shit
Promoting drugs in songs like a full blown fuckwit
Now I'm here to fix it up, sorry if I mixed you up
Walking 'round high yelling ""Kerser is the sickest cunt!""
What a fucking mess, probably contradict myself
Old enough to know better, but I went and fucked my health
I'm all right now, I'm falling asleep
Is it a nightmare? I hear people calling for me
Then I hit the stage, the fans cry, now I'm the man, why?
Guess they all connect with the thoughts from my damn mind

Riding with my seat back, crew got the heat dacked
Still haven't changed, last album gotta beat that
Still here for my fans all the time
All you gotta do is hit play, stop and rewind
Still with the dream that makes me complete rap
Still haven't changed, passed out on the beach smashed
Still here for my fans all the time
All you gotta do is hit play, stop and rewind

Hold me up again, I might lose balance
Drag you in to connect like two magnets
Spit the shit you've been waiting for
I spit the shit you was thinking of the day before, Christ
How I do it, and my head in a rough place
Fifteen years old, pop pills as I dump base
That's the start of the story of the fucked life
Fucked my head, was it that or when I touched Ice?
Never again though, victim of the C-Town
Put me in history, the way that I rebound
Made my life change, come and see me live aye
Sold out shows, fans screamin' 'til the night change
Into morning then I'm on the next flight
Chose this way of life, and I gotta get my cheques right
Build the funds up until the fun's up
Label me to run mucks, and you thought I was dumb, fuck

Riding with my seat back, crew got the heat dacked
Still haven't changed, last album gotta beat that
Still here for my fans all the time
All you gotta do is hit play, stop and rewind
Still with the dream that makes me complete rap
Still haven't changed, passed out on the beach smashed

An ego on me, yeah, it's true, I'm not here to deny that
You fuckers are not writers 'cause you went and mentioned iMax
So many fakers 'round and they try so hard for acceptance
Depends on who they know, then sometimes, people make exceptions
I fuckin' hate youse all, we live in Sydney southern street, like
No cokeheads for the law, these kids are dackin' stashin' free knives
Kids are gettin' robbed from everything from hats to shoes to jeans
So tell me why the fuck I'd even care about the music scene
These home invasions getting crazy, half the world on separate wheels
And what, I'm meant to sit here, fuckin' worry 'bout a record deal?
Nah, not today, I live it now, I'm livin' for the moment, true

You witnessin' perfection, raw and rough around the edges
Never suffered from rejection as I rap to my reflection
Of my bottle 'cause it's empty still be searchin' for the Henny
But I'd rather crack a wine right out the cask than not have any
You can call it what you want to, not like I be really carin' brah
Rather take the winnings of someone I be respectin', nah
Take that back, the feedback I receive, I barely touch on
I listen to my songs and that's enough for me to march on

Swag It Up,YouTube Promotion Tracks,2017,"Ch-yeah
You want the old school Kers back?
Ask and you shall receive
Look

I got my chains on and now I'm swagging on 'em
Yelling ""C-Town"", someone bring the bagging for 'em
Ain't need a zipper, I've never switched up
I've seen the cunts, you thinking tough? Just stop and bitch up
But I ain't say shit, I ain't giving fame out
The lion off the leash, why would I get tame now?
I'm in designer, rolling up to airports
At the start, we used to walk, they be like ""they're poor""
I walk in motivation, always got my motor racing
King of rap, I own the nation, sickest doctors overweight and
I'm like a coma patient, walking with a big cup
She ask me for my autograph, I signed it, saying ""sick cunt""
This that good shit, Kerser in the limousine
They fucking dreaming, thinking they could ever finish me
I'm number one, yeah, I heard it, you know
I keep dropping CD's 'cause they're certainly dope, get it?
I'ma shine, I don't care how they feel
In ten years, you look back, like ""you ran it for real?""
I mean, I show you how to stack cash off this rap shit
I show you how to do it proper with no wack shit

I show you how to do it proper with no wack shit
I show you how to do it proper

Pay homage, I'm the first without the media
To dominate this shit and take what they was feeding ya
The one and only, I'm the man, my bars will never stop
I'm getting paper everyday, I'm like a letterbox
Oh, you don't like that, like how I write that
Got me swaggie something else, I cause a time lapse
I got these bars, I ain't stopping for a fucking hook
You telling stories, probably read 'em from a fucking book
I remember cunts getting rushed for ten bucks
I lit my spliff like ""fuck, will he get up?"" (you know)
This is old school Kers, what you been waiting for
My old fans are like ""shit man, he's back as raw""
Smoking up and sipping cups man, this the usual
Kerser one can put the fun into your funeral
I'ma piss on what you drop, just like a urinal
I tell a bitch ""my name is Kers, don't call me beautiful""
You dancing 'round on stage, your shit looks like a musical
Our shit is raw, we rock a show and bring the crew for you
I've been celebrating, 'bout to hit the road again
I blew up years ago, I guess that I'm exploding then
I've never been a bitch boy, I've never been a dick ride
Watching half the faggots seen, all they do is switch sides
I'm with the same side I've been since the team kid
Jumping on a hater's head, our version of a remix

Jumping on a hater's head, our version of a remix
Jumping on a hater

ABK, I swear you ain't seen the half of us
The other half you haven't seen, they keep masking up
They pumping jobs, now I'll send 'em to the ARIAs
Tell em ""shoot it up"" okay, I took it far enough
Now, these rappers think they're bouncing again
The shit you tryin' to do what I done in 2010
It just won't happen again, I'm that one of a kind
The blueprint that I designed can't be done again, alright?
Spitting rhymes and they turn into a paycheck
So fresh, I don't ask, they just say yes
Been around a long time at the top spot

Take it and Run,Lifestyle,2019,"Sinking or swimming that's what we were told, we were young
But no one told us how it was done
Spending your days in a way, which you knew it's begun
Take what you've got, take it and run

So hot, got her reachin' in for the sunblock
She like my style in this way, she hope it rubs off
I ain't here to waste time, you know the man back
Best advice I can give is to stand back
Got the east, south, west, north feeling it
But it Kers shit, they like me on my killer shit
My black bally in a back alley, fuck that
I'ma talk about money with a bud bag
Cruisin' one deep, havin' conversations
You think I'm trippin'? This my way of concentration
I ain't listen to a hater, not in any way
I'm a busy man, you see me, know I'm gettin' pay
I ain't like these other rappers, I'm the opposite
My boys are renting houses just to put the crops in it
Ride it round, got the street mentality
Hustle big you can meet fatalities
Got a flow impeccable, you knowin' what the Kers does
The scene needed savin', they lucky that I turned up
I heard 'em all say nobody perfect
I agree but I gotta say, ""Kers is""
Moved outta C-Town when I got funds
But every single hood there I'm still welcome
That's the difference, shit, you know I'm certified
Jealous haters spewing, they were hoping that the Kerser died
Ownin' the world in a world on my own
That deserves a replay, I'm in a world of my own
With the writin' and delivery, man, you cunts are kiddin' me
I got rich off this shit, this is mine and that is literally
I was rappin' 'round the time I got my first pube
I could tell you 'bout my best or my worst move
I could tell you 'bout the beefs that I've been through
But I never lost one, so I don't need to
Fuckin' hell, let me try an' stay positive
You said you promise it, you knowing what a promise is?
Setting levels every time I go and pen bars
Sickest Aussie rapper, man, I know I set the benchmark
Gotta get it any second man the clock stop
Still confused, this is life at the top, Scott
Done the proper way too, like you didn't know
Don't compare me to a rapper, this is different, bro
You feel the goosebumps rise off my low tone
Gifted, haters actin' like they don't know
'Member me in a drain for my film clip
Swappin' shirts with Strace? That was real shit
Beat the struggle with my brothers and we all tight
I don't care if they talk man, they all lie
What they owe man I'm tired of me braggin'
My pockets full if my pants ever saggin'
Get the vibe, check your mates if they don't know
You will find the ones that wanna stay won't go
Kers one droppin' hits for like ten years
How the fuck else do you think that you'd get here?
Take it and run, you can't trust the streets
You can't trust who you trust, put trust in me
Sinkin' or swimmin', I'm driftin' and driftin'
They listen and listen, the sickest, I did it again

Sinking or swimming that's what we were told, we were young
But no one told us how it was done

Taken Away,King,2014," x2
Say all the things that you wanna say
And you can't take back, what have you taken away
Cos I feel you, I feel you

This shit right here is for the kid on the street
Headphone, zone alone as he spits to the beat
And his mum is in the next room, crying out tears
In a battle with poverty, been fighting for years
But he raps at the lifeline
Feeling like the right time
Labels keep ignoring and he can't afford a mic why?
His big brothers out hustling packs
Makes it red dot on the house but he's got trust in the rap
But he's going to the shows
No-one's listening to his flows
But he knows that his dope
Copping kisses on the throat
Off a girl that he loves, but she don't love him back
Guaranteed she'd have his back, if he made it in rap
And it's fucked up
Cos everyday is getting harder
Surrounded by the street, it's kinda hard to play it smarter
What the plan when his man got a gun pulled?
In his face, on the street there's only one rule
Payback, revenge at fucking all cost
Lets shots fly through his house without a door knock
Running out of time and the crime getting red hot
He needs face in a maze gonna get lost
Why rap? Feeling like he getting no-where
So much shit to say, but he just feeling like they don't care
He keeps writing, smoking up in his bedroom
A few cunts out and they looking for his head too
He gets new he gotta to move; he ignores that
His house got sprayed, he sees his mum on the floor - flat
Fuck no, he breaks down 'No more please'
Puts his ear to her mouth, bet she won't breath
No it won't be all good in the end
And fuck rap now he won't even look at a pen
And years later he's a mess, drug fucked, berserk
Still the only thing he visions everyday is her - his mum
 x2
Say all the things that you wanna say
And you can't take back, what have you taken away
Cos I feel you, I feel you

Young chick, 18 with a bus pass
Heaps smart, hides the fact that she puffs glass
Hot as, tight jeans with some air max
Over life and she staring at the train tracks
Hates catching busses and the trains but she broke as
Lives at home with her mum, she don't know Dad
Cos he split, but she never thinks of that shit
Gotta couple guys on the side, it's getting bad quick
She hates life and despise all the sleaze bags
She only talk to 'em so she can get a weed bag
What's love? Nah she never got none
She had one real friend, but she dead from a gun
So the story begun
She started slanging the drugs
That means the same time, she was hanging with thugs
But know she flirts little bit
But it never legit
Enough to make a fucker think that she keen for the dick
Till one night she be out in the shortest dress
So she can get a bigger size when she scored, I guess
It wasn't in the plan but she rocking to the party
Stashed spot bud, they left tick for the money
Bourbon catching up so she off to the restroom
She gets followed by a dude to the next room
I ain't in the mood but she got some shit to do
But he ain't even listen, tell me what's it leading to?
And he push her to the bed, she bump her head
And it leaks out red, she nearly dead
But the piece is he fucked her, comes in and up her
But she wakes up in the hospital and hides it with the laughter
She pregnant, and she ain't even know the father
But she getting real confused cos she wants to have it after
Everything that happened is the way that she lived
Her daughter got no daddy now she grew like she did - on the street

Say all the things that you wanna say

This one is to all of those other rappers
Who like to diss us but hide when we find them
You're not rappers, you're faggots
What happening Jay-Dee? 
Fuck all again, mate
Kerser and Jay UF
All right, now fucking listen

Fuck these rappers man they homos and gays
I may as well quit rapping and work on Home and Away
I mean, why the fuck you cunts biting my shit?
And why these pussy fuckin' rappers always higher than this?
And don't think I forgot about that Tracy Grimshaw
Who's got the shits at life because her tits and dick's small
And listen, if you listen to Allday
There's not one exception, you fuckers are all gay
And people ask me when you gonna diss 6
My reply I don't wanna hurt a big bitch
Its Kers one you know Sydney is my home mark
All these rappers drop nuts like 60 in a go-kart
You hearing rumours and they probably true
If they include me being a fuckin' problem to you
And my dick's so big that they think I got three legs
Hardest choice in life is who I make bleed next

We told these cunts that they are wack
And we will take over the scene
And now they hate and sook
And act like they don't even notice
We are at the top it hurts their pride
We laugh, they hide and try to diss
But, when we find 'em, they cry
So tell me, why do they do this shit?

Let me hit my spliff tonight
(Jay you've said that two times) I'm shit all right
I still write all the time, can't be fucked to work
I'm still a joke, I'm still a bum, but find that life could be worse
I mean I record for free, I score for free
I have a lot of goals in life, I hope they all for free
But talk on beats, I'm awful, I want more for free
So, if you got some free shit, send it all to me
I'm like the mate you got, the free tracks are for sesh
Promise shit I can't keep that's why I'm stuck in the debt
I ain't a normal bloke, no, I'm just fucked in the head
The type to be nice to your nan and get under her dress
I just say some shit to fucking stir up the pot
Like hit a diss to fuckin' Kers while I spit it with Scott
So everybody, give it up when I'm up in your hood
It's Jay-Dee, the one cunt who makes chubby look good
What?

We told these cunts that they are wack
And we will take over the scene
And now they hate and sook
And act like they don't even notice
We are at the top it hurts their pride
We laugh, they hide and try to diss
But, when we find 'em, they cry
So tell me, why do they do this shit?
[Verse 3: Kerser & 
Jay

You fucken chad pussies got smelly vaginas
And they pissing off Jay like the end of reminders
Fuck don't bring that up bro, I got in shit
Plus it wasn't my fault, it was they drugs that I did
We were cutting it sick and we took over the scene
Plus not at one second were we sober or clean
Now I'm over the beam, but I'm puffing a joint man
Okay, you got a point Jay, but you had a point then
Fuck off cunt I had five points that day
Crystal in my pocket like Matt thought he had aye
Wait, did I just do a diss? Subliminal shit?
I think I just did, fuck it bro, we pissed in his beer
Shit yeah, we did, we might get banned from the festival
Let's scrap this whole track bro this wasn't professional
Fuck that shit, Kers, we ain't here to make friends
We're here to do what we started and we're here till the end

We told these cunts that they are wack
And we will take over the scene
And now they hate and sook
And act like they don't even notice
We are at the top it hurts their pride
We laugh, they hide and try to diss

Teenage Crime Remix,,2020,"Gimme The Gent

They loved her in school but the shit kind of changed now
Twenty-five, three kids in the same house
Single mum and she thinkin' 'bout her teen days
Back then, she was treated like a queen mate
Fell in love with a dealer, she was eighteen
He was twenty-nine, money, man, he made heaps
Wasn't long after that she was knocked up
And he left once he heard it from the doctor
Now she nineteen, spinnin' with a kid comin'
Want another man, thinkin' it will fix somethin'
Got another dude but he on the pipe bad
She ignored like ""He'll prob'ly make a nice dad""
Now she fucked up, got another two kids
No man and her friends call her stupid
She miss school 'cause to her, they're the good days
Now she wipe tears, got her singing what the hook say

We don't sleep when the sun goes down
We don't waste no precious time
All my friends in the loop
Making up for teenage crime
We don't sleep when the sun goes down
We don't waste no precious time
All my friends in the loop
Making up for teenage crime

""What I want when I want"", that the attitude
Eighteen, locked up and the matter's moved
To Supreme Court 'cause he let the gat bang
In an armed rob, on a Xan, shot her back and
Hit her arm too but he don't remember
Happened in July and we almost in December
Make it worse, who he shot died a day later
Can't believe what he done just to make paper
Now his mum come to visit, she in shock, wow
Try to look him in the eye but he lost now
Still a kid but he tried to play the big role
Now he on the Bupe and he lookin' for a fit, oh
Up for murder, he know it ain't a good look
What a waste, he ain't even been in good puss
Wanted cash, he was lookin' for the good days
Now he's in the cell and he's singing what the hook say

We don't sleep when the sun goes down
We don't waste no precious time
All my friends in the loop
Making up for teenage crime
We don't sleep when the sun goes down
We don't waste no precious time
All my friends in the loop
Making up for teenage crime

She twenty-two, still stuck in the high life
Doesn't realise time gonna fly by
Boss bitch hard to hit, she don't give it up
Mad arse, nice lips with her titties up
Had a man but he died in a bad crash
So she livin' off the money that he had stashed
Tried to take over biz that he had runnin'
Bad mistake 'cause it just had the lads comin'
She a bitch so to them it is easy
Set her up, take her money, do her greasy
She on the ball but today kind of too suss
She knocked out now she laying in the boot, fuck!
She wake up, gettin' touched, this is messed up
They dump her off at the place where her ex passed
She wanna die, miss her man and the good days
Ties a knot, got her singing what the hook say

We don't sleep when the sun goes down
We don't waste no precious time
All my friends in the loop
Making up for teenage crime
We don't sleep when the sun goes down
We don't waste no precious time

Everybody tells me to leave you alone
It's a catastrophe, you're so bad for me
You have to leave, but come back to me
It's a catastrophe, you're so bad for me
You have to leave, you have to leave

I try my best I needed you
You were standing there like I need you too
We're so lost and I'm stressin' out
You need me there but the next of towns is
Where I'm at cos I can't get my head round
The last look you gave me before you put your head down
Your friends say I'm bad for you
Tell them mind your own business haven't you
Picked up that I'm lost and I'm freakin' out
Cos my life so crazy me without
You is like something I cannot picture
Speakin' of picture think I just ripped the
Last one on the wall of us two
Doesn't change the fact that I love you
I'm a mess and I can't decide
Then I pick the phone up and I hear you like..

I love you, I want you, I need you oh
I'm high when I touch you don't leave me no
Without you it's lonely and freezing cold
Everybody tells me to leave you alone

You have to leave, but come back to me
It's a catastrophe, you're so bad for me
You have to leave, you have to leave

You scream at me, I'm screamin back
That I'm seeing black right as I snap shit
Why you leave then come back so quick?
What you need is here and you know this
Other night you swung a punch
At me and it hit and I had to laugh ha
Why you mad? What I do? What a heartbreak
Holdin on your chest like your heartache
You don't know what to do with your life now
What's next? Are we gonna turn the lights out?
Say yes, then you're hard to find
You've been there like half my life
It's okay, I guess you're right
But you ain't gonna leave for the rest of the night
This the end then I'm asking for one more
Night with you then you're at the front door like..

I love you, I want you, I need you oh
I'm high when I touch you don't leave me no
Without you it's lonely and freezing cold
Everybody tells me to leave you alone
It's a catastrophe, you're so bad for me
You have to leave, but come back to me
It's a catastrophe, you're so bad for me
You have to leave, you have to leave

Stuck in a maze going back and forth
Then you hear me wiff why you rappin' for?
What you expect, that I leave it all?
Do I have to remind you It feeds us all?
Tearing us apart don't make me choose
I know you too well, you hate to lose
Every time I call you're by my side
You try ring me like 99
Times and I don't pick up and its crazy
Dunno what to do just lost it maybe
Find a way to make this work
Say you love Scott but you hate the Kers
What to do? Don't know just air thoughts
If I leave then I'm headin' to the airport
Overseas and I bet you hate
Gettin' on the plane and you're at the gate like..

I love you, I want you, I need you oh
I'm high when I touch you don't leave me no
Without you it's lonely and freezing cold
Everybody tells me to leave you alone
It's a catastrophe, you're so bad for me
You have to leave, but come back to me
It's a catastrophe, you're so bad for me
You have to leave, you have to leave",https://genius.com/Kerser-than-i-hear-you-like-lyrics
Thank You,YouTube Promotion Tracks,2013,"So, um
I suppose this is my thank you
Look

I got that special something, I take your pain away
It feels like you been walkin' on a plank of razorblades
I know that feelin' bruh
 'cause I been there too
You keep that head up, turn the shit up till they turn on you
My mate rang from lockup, told me that he's doin' fine
Last he heard for all he knows, he could be doin' nine
What the fuck I meant to say? Yeah, I'm doin' right?
And don't you ask me one more time why he was doin' crime
I got an email from a fan, he said I saved his life
But somehow mentioned I'm the reason why he blazed the pipe
So how I save him if I made him in the first place?
I wonder every day if I will make my birthday
I'm trying to save my fans, I'm walking through this fucking life
I'm trying to bring that something, they be missing something nice
You can fucking cry, just let that pain away
If you're my fan, I'll bring that sun to you on them rainy days

This my thank you, thankin' you for your support
You're the reason why I made it so I owe you all
You're the reason why I wake up, I keep writin' verses
You saved me so I'm just hopin' it goes vice-versa
This my thank you, thankin' you for your support
You're the reason why I made it so I owe you all
You're the reason why I wake up, I keep writin' verses
You saved me so I'm just hopin' it goes vice-versa

To tell the truth, to go in public, need a couple tabs
Anxiety, I'm a wreck, it's gettin' fuckin' bad
I met a fan and he had tears in his eyes
He told me that my music saved him and it's clearin' his mind
And how the fuck you think I felt when he told me that I'm heaps real
For staying clean? behind the scenes, I just popped like three pills
But if I didn't pop em then we wouldn't have met
I mean I cannot go in public without poppin' them, damn
So while I ask if you being a fan
Be fan but don't look up to me, I'm fucked in the head
But you're the same so you relate and if you not then it's okay
'Cause you can tell that it's not fake, without music, I would break
Without the fans, I don't have music, so I owe you my life
I give you everything I got 'cause you know what I'm like
And it's weird, these days my mates hear my life on the tracks
So they don't bother ringing up 'cause my life in the rap trapped!

This my thank you, thankin' you for your support
You're the reason why I made it so I owe you all
You're the reason why I wake up, I keep writin' verses
You saved me so I'm just hopin' it goes vice-versa
This my thank you, thankin' you for your support
You're the reason why I made it so I owe you all
You're the reason why I wake up, I keep writin' verses
You saved me so I'm just hopin' it goes vice-versa

My fans are my whole life so it kinda feels fuckin' wrong
That so many people see where I be coming from
I'll keep giving you facts on my life
Your parents hate me but I made your kid stop smashin' the pipe
I'm from the streets where my boys carry guns to get funds up
Now they in a cell, was it karma or their luck up?
Haters, shut the fuck up, you ain't live the life of mine
Until you have then you talkin', otherwise it's quite time
And people talk, man they gotta talk a lot of shit
They watch a change like the fame's what you wanted shit
Jealousy is everywhere, I'm comin' across
But if they hating, it's because I got something they want, gronks
Want stop me I'm on my way to the top
Plus I'm bringing my whole crew so it's weighin' a lot
I'm a chill, saved my fans from the trap that they're in
Kerser sayin' thank you that I actually mean, dream

This my thank you, thankin' you for your support
You're the reason why I made it so I owe you all
You're the reason why I wake up, I keep writin' verses
You saved me so I'm just hopin' it goes vice-versa
This my thank you, thankin' you for your support
You're the reason why I made it so I owe you all
You're the reason why I wake up, I keep writin' verses
You saved me so I'm just hopin' it goes vice-versa",https://genius.com/Kerser-thank-you-lyrics

It's Kerser
I'm with Jay UF
Jay! 
What?
What's happenin'? I guess you're gonna say ""fuck all"" again, uh?
Can we just hurry up and do the song?
 What?
Let's just get the song done mate, come on
I'll go first then. 
All right, go for it
Yo, Jay's a fuckwit, check, look

I'm an OG, probably 'bout to OD
Said it 'round o-three, bet they're gonna clone me
I wasn't wrong, but a bunch that wanna be me
Wanna Be Kers
, that should be your next CD
I came up in the game 'round the time when
You wouldn't jump on the internet fightin'
I got a call off a whore. 
Who? Grimshaw
Nah, another bitch, cracked out a thin whore
Fuck that Jay, I wouldn't hit with your dick
I fuck it back ahead so I face it like a swordfish
Where does all of this sick shit come from?
Kerser would, he did, I mention I got one on
Fresh cunt, I'm lookin' better with age
And I don't write raps, I machete the page
None ahead of me mate and it's weird 'cause I live dreams
Hurry up Jay, I don't wanna hear your sixteens

Still runnin' this game in the fast lane
Wavin' at every cunt that we pass mate
Still killin' every show that is us, ayy
Never gonna stop till we delivering our last tape
Still runnin' this game in the fast lane
Wavin' at every cunt that we pass mate
Still killin' every show that is us, ayy
Never gonna stop till we delivering our last tape

Crack another drink man, fuck, is this my kind?
I'm takin' over shit like it's a feature on my song
Time's gone like a terrorist with a nice bomb
Blowin' up the scene, not in a way that you guys want
If I was wrong and never made it with my songs
I’ll make a go fund me so I can still light bongs
Cry night long, whinging, where has my life gone?
Wait a minute Jay, that's what you do when you write songs
Ha, fuckin' ha, yeah, I'm funny like I'm Scott
He looks like Kate Moss if she puffed on the ice lots
There goes the record deal, fuck it, it's my loss
Time to call Cento and I fill up my 
Hate rap anyway, it's time to admit it
Fuck, I'll only ever listen if my rhymin' is in it
So, fuck album number two, nah, I'm finally finished
Nah, I'm joking, I'ma spit it just to prine you critics, cunts

Still runnin' this game in the fast lane
Wavin' at every cunt that we pass mate
Still killin' every show that is us, ayy
Never gonna stop till we delivering our last tape
Still runnin' this game in the fast lane
Wavin' at every cunt that we pass mate
Still killin' every show that is us, ayy
Never gonna stop till we delivering our last tape
[Verse 3: Jay UF & 
Kerser
]
Hey Kers, I'm thinking fuck a third verse
Let me spit it then!
 They don't wanna hear the Kers verse
Shut up Jay, you ridiculous cunt
They know Kerser is the sickest, they ain't heard it enough
They ain't heard it enough? Now let's talk about me
The fact that I be credible with the words that I speak
Well, you're a turd and a geek for even turnin' on me
Jay, where's your last album? People burn it for free
Shit, Kers taking shots like you did in our last song
Hope he takes a different kind of shot and his heart stops
Gotta move along cunt, give up, you're past gone
Waitin' on my pay, where you gettin' these cars from?
Shut the fuck up, where you tryin' to get to?
Because I'm number one, what, does it upset you?
We don't really get along, we just dissin' on tracks
Nah, I'm kidding, next album cunt, your shit is just wack

Still runnin' this game in the fast lane
Wavin' at every cunt that we pass mate
Still killin' every show that is us, ayy

The Last Hope,,2013,"I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
Bet this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope
Won't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the frontlines with my weapon
I am the last hope

I'm the last hope, do it cause I can't cope
Fuckin' weird obsession gonna leave me with my heart broke
Plus last night there's three cars at my house
Dont know what they planning sittin with the lights out
Im inside, with a weapon by the front door
I could start a war and get em killed now with one call
I can't be fucked though, drama at another plan
And for all I know these people parked could be a bunch of fans
Does my fucking head in, give me fucking space
Explain it to my girl, yo we gotta get another place
Take a big breath, thats for certain
This your dream Scott, now was it worth it?
Im stressed out I got an album to make
I got a tour to do, now the hours won't wait
And I swear to god I pictured it so different if I made it
You think I really give a fuck if people there are hatin?
Bruzz


Call it what you will, rumours fly round
All these stories make me laugh as I fly down
Im a target for these people damage my name
He's a crack-head flippin' out with a fried brain
Haha, you gotta be kiddin
If the rock was my addiction would I be in this position?
I didn't think so, I'm success
I do it properly but I struggle with the fucking stress
I ain't touched a pipe in a fucking long time
Never will again, go and listen to some songs of mine
You think you know me right, the flow is tightened
Overnight, they think happend Jesus Christ this rappin' took like half my life
So take a seat back, let me roll this big spliff
On a beach with a cup of something mixed shit
Feelin' faded as, and maybe thats what makes me rap
The way I do I'm living off the fact that people play my tracks man",https://genius.com/Kerser-the-last-hope-lyrics
The Real Sh!t,S.C.O.T.,2013,"Our pay, got it sitting in a satty bag
Me and Nebs spending big, yeah we happy lad
What you know about working on an album?
Watch it sell, pop pills counting thousands?
Put a bit aside for the boys on the inside
Play the music over phones so they hear us spit rhymes
I went from Nautica to Gucci
You rap fake 'cause you saw it in a movie
We rap life straight street when we represent
You ain't seen what we seen you ain't getting it
They used to laugh 'cause the brands was the no names
Now I rock gold and designer got no shame
Toe tag body bag any competition
Say you're rooting bitches, but your fucking cock is missing
ABK that's the crew, that's the lifeline
You hear a click click followed with a bye bye

Kers and Nebs taking over the rap biz
You hear our catalogue and you're thinking, ""yeah, that's sick""

Kers and Nebs kicking back on the lean
Stacking the green, slanging crack to fiends smashing the scene, uh
No need for me to say who the winner is
We made too much cash from these tracks, it's ridiculous
I'm looking at these other rappers trying not to laugh
Popping Xannies in the studio I'm high as fuck!
Your missus heard my sexy voice on ""The Nebulizer""
Now she's begging me and texting me to get inside her
Coked up, I party keen on the party scene
Even fucking Charlie Sheen said he can't compete
When it comes to beats, N-E-B is hard to beat
Slurping on a cup of lean till my face is army green
This is the real shit, I'm ill wit I kill this
You've been doing it for years and you're still shit
I made this beat and I hit the jackpot
Nebs leaving all you rappers looking like wack gronks!

I blew up, now a bunch of fucking lads hate
I think they mad 'cause I brag about pay
An they still pissed off on the back of the train
I'm in the club with my crew, yeah we're easy to find
Aussie rap needs balls, yeah leave it to I
Never ever hold a grudge 'cause we handle it quick
I'm on stage, your missus trying to put her hand on my dick
Yeah, this time around, I'll be claiming I'm king
I keep it raw proper Australian, you dig?
Fresh cunt, drip swag on your new rugs
Hypocrite when I tell you not to do drugs
If I'm out then you're likely to see
My fucking eyes out my head and I'm grinding my teeth

The Real You,Tradition,2016,"Slipped down don’t you fall you a soldier
That’s me talking to myself in the cold ah’
Round the time I was going through some rough shit
Seventeen skinny wreck on some fucked shit
Hated life felt the upper class looked down
Then I joined the upper class, how I meant to look now?
Still the same cunt, fresh with a foul mouth
Certified been making haters fuckin bow down
Ask about me, I carry this game
Before I marry this game, and boy hasn't it changed?
I used to rap in the rain, when I was smashed off my face
Pour back with my mates, were they happy in day shit?
I don’t know we was only tryna have fun
We was living in the town, you had to back up
What you said on these C-Town streets
Inspiration for the real ones when I move to the beach, just reach

When we all go out, it’s the same way
Heard your man got shot in the laneway
When you’re first man
How you thinking Kers next?
Holding on your bottle on, there’s nothing on the surf left
Get your head up man, they don’t know the real you
That’s why some hate and some are gonna feel you
I don’t care, I’m just lookin’ for a quiet one
Wonder why I got a spliff, yeah I light it up

Crusin' on the highway on pill 5 mate
Lookin’ for a driveway, I just wanna drive away
I never look back, unless it’s on the good times
But that shit's hard when you’re stuck with a crook's mind
It took time but I rose to the top
I left Obese Records and they closed up their shop
I’m a fuckin hustler; I’m ABK till I go
Don’t compare me to a rapper, in a lane of my own
And the scene still hate, well ain’t that a shock
I think they mad cause they flop and can’t get this shit in shops
I play the game right, why you gotta hate on that?
A real rapper from the bottom that is making cash
Got a right to have an ego you’re fuckin' right
A couple nights celebrating thinking, what have I
Overcome as I’m sitting on the beachfront?
Damn I came a long way for a street cunt
Why Kers, that I made it in the rhyme game
Cause I versed everything that came my way
Now the one you called Chap is a made man
Take my boys on tour, best feelings when I pay them man

When we all go out, it’s the same way
Heard your man got shot in the laneway
Where you first met, now you thinking Kers next
Holding on your bottle on, there’s nothing on this earth left
Get your head up man, they don’t know the real you
That’s why some hate and some are gonna feel you
I don’t care, I’m just lookin’ for a quiet one
Wonder why I got a spliff, yeah I light it up

This for the fans that demand a night
I’m the man alright, I used to stand and grind
In the rain with the mixtape, no one wanna buy aye
When I need bail went for 3k the other day
Shout to T selling tapes with me
That was back in the day, ain’t it crazy to see?
That I’m sitting at the top, we were sittin, we would pot
And I gave the crew the word that I’m never going soft
I’m blacklisted everywhere, shuttin me out
Will they ever change a mind with a gun in their mouth?
That’s a couple of stacks, that I’m likely to drop
Let’s get back to the rap it’s my life, it’s my job
It’s my everything man, it can’t get out of my head
It’s like it’s stuck in their forever with whatever I said
Unwritten Letter can’t rest, but it’s just for now
They would never understand, guess it’s just me wow

When we all go out, it’s the same way
Heard your man got shot in the laneway
When you’re first man
How you thinking Kers next?
Holding on your bottle on, there’s nothing on the surf left
Get your head up man, they don’t know the real you
That’s why some hate and some are gonna feel you
I don’t care, I’m just lookin’ for a quiet one

The Reminder,No Rest For The Sickest,2012,"Blunt jam packed, rolled by a bad bitch
She celebrating that I made it, I'ma have this
I slept way past the time that I intended
It's my day job lad, just rhyme in every sentence
From emphasine to codeine in a boost cup
Sipping on it fast, while I tell you not to do drugs
Lean back relax and yet I light this
She said she's not a slut but you should see the bitch with my dick
I'm her god, I'm her world, I'm her sunshine
She a bitch, she a girl, she ain't touch my
Money or my wallet or my phone don't call me on it
Now that's me just being honest plus your friend thinks I'ma chop her
If I didn't rap, would you still be in your panties now?
I play you ""Do The Kers"" but you gotta pull them panties down
Fucking slut, yeah you're making this too easy
Believe me, I'm leaving, now please enjoy your evening, goodbye

You didn't learn, nah you're needing a reminder
I ain't love you once, I told you this while I'm inside you
While I'm inside you
While I'm inside you
You're just a ho, I ain't ever here to help you
Grab your shit and go 'cause I really want to belt you
Really want to belt you
Really want to belt you

Ring my phone back, what you do that for?
Hung up straight away, 'cause she went and called me beautiful
She got the wrong idea, I ain't here to hug and kiss
I came to sip your booze and if there's time okay you suck my dick
It ain't a fucking trick, it's honest and it's down to life
I hate your name, but you fucking love the sound of mine
Kerser with a K, yeah you love it, it's insane
If they call me Scott today, she be walking other ways
That's why I treat 'em all like shit, if they fiending for my dick
No respect for a ho, groupie clear the way and split
We ain't gonna be a couple, go find your dream man
And when your with him, tell him that I already been there
I know it don't seem fair, you thinking I'm mean yeah
Well how about we change the subject go and just clean there
I'ma leave you with a fucking bruise
A reminder, like you know who you've been fucking true?

You didn't learn, nah you're needing a reminder
I ain't love you once, I told you this while I'm inside you
While I'm inside you
While I'm inside you
You're just a ho, I ain't ever here to help you
Grab your shit and go 'cause I really want to belt you
Really want to belt you
Really want to belt you

Yeah, and that's just being honest
So you can fucking hate me for it
But the bottom line
If you didn't see me on that stage
Or on that video clip
You wouldn't be following me everywhere chasing dick
That's why I treat you like shit
Slut
Ha ha ha, Kerser

Jay Dee fuck off man
Nah you can't be doing this bro
Nah fuck em man
Think about it bro
Why?
You're being fucking rude as fuck
You're fucking off your head
Seriously bro, who gives a fuck if they're a dirty fucking trash bag, fucking scum looking, inflamed pussy fucking, over-rubbed fucking, fat arse fucking, dirty, filthy fucking scumbag, pussy rubbing filthy fucking, catching herpes, dirty filthy scumbag
With their dirty little slut faces, rubbing their dirty little - inflamed coffee beans
Fucking dirty filthy, inflamed cunts, dirty little cunts, fucking slut bro, it doesn't matter man they're your sluts, just doing it as a friend bro
Oi girls, you know he loves you, don't worry about it, okay just play Kerser in the background if that gets you in the mood a bit

This one kicks
Yeah, what up Nebs?
Hit ‘em with a classic
Jay Dee, Rates
Oi, what’s up Boobz?
Fuck all mate
South-West

How it started out was kind of hard, we had to craft it out
We walk toward this pub, what we’re after isn’t harder now
There’s no one rhymin’ better ‘cause the writin’s clever
When  we strive together, makin’ music, feel the vibe forever
Yes, true, we’re livin’ this, give the skill a lyricist
Spittin’ shit that’s infinitely driven by its viciousness
Vision this, a crew of brothers that’ll stand and say
That they’re listenin’ to what we’ve written and they care today
I hate to break it and the shit’ll change your  forever
So I’m makin’ music for my brothers when I’m changin’ and I
Never regret anything or ever replannin’ my life
Spend every dollar I’ve ever earned when inventin’ my rhymes
I’m here and not backin’ down, it’s clear that we’re gonna stay
I’m provin’ we’ve got the ability and Kerser’s on his way
Stand in a place, tear it to shreds in the blaze
The hair stands on the back of your neck, we’re airin’ the rage

In a rap journey, livin’ fine, not turnin’ around
Jay Dee’s bound to work in verse and complete just murder sounds
If you haven’t heard me before, well sure, you’ve heard me now
Keen to record, enjoy it every time I air this out
The things I cared about is pretty much nothin’
Until this something come along and I loved it
Understand, discussin’ subjects, you’re on the mic, makes my life feel kind of like
It’s lighter on the other side, that’s why I find I try to write
Fuck it, tonight, UF’s vibe will make you vibe until
Describin’ me,  ever describin’ you
Life’s a bitch and then you die but while I’m livin’ stay alive
Today, what I am in this frame of mind I’m fuckin’ aimin’ high
No I’m not changin’ I am patiently waitin’ to say
What I say on the mic, this ain’t a game, this is my way of life
South-West ready to wreck with the best 
To just hit you in your head until you’re there and spray a rhyme

You’re fuckin’ right, this is South-West life
You never knew it till we did it, now we’re out to shine
Now, when we hit it in a minute, you are bound to find
That we’re the sickest spittin’ lyrics, now you’re out of time
‘Cause this it the South-West, the South-West, South-West
The South-West, the South-West, South-West
The South-West, the South-West, South-West
If you fuck around with us, you must be out your mind

Check mate, I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout a chess game
Now you need an x-ray ‘cause you got a chest pain
I’m the best name, I’m fuckin’ fresh mate
They knew that when they see me in the flesh 
I’m in the next  gonna make your neck 
Like you’re wearin’ x blades, runnin’ on the wet sleigh
No test  all you layin’ in your bed grave
Get paid, eshay, I’m leavin’ on a jet plane
Inject pain, eject flames, I get cane
You get canes and yet slave the death plague
Your friends; fake like ten mates that bench weights
I met mates that  me out, now my best mate
My drinks taste exactly like a meth pay
You know the boys just like the fuckin’ Nebs bass
They call me Boobz but I ain’t a fuckin’ breast plate
Now it’s your move buddy, stuck ‘cause it’s checkmate

I travel ‘round where I go, you see me wreckin’ the show
I’m just lettin’ ‘em know I got the hectickest flow
I’ma take tracks and break ‘em, make stacks, amazin’
Eight bags of haze and blaze ‘em on a train, man
Sydney, they be knowin’ the name, they know I flow insane
Only say what I be thinkin’ so you know I quote my pay
I’m down with  the search is down with drug pushers
Learners get murdered, it’s Kerser
The truth come, we move up, you knew us
My new bars, that crew’s past, you’re losers
I’m too much for you bruz, you knew but
My two bucks says “you suck, your crew’s fucked”
You know the South-West fuckin’ lads have got the realest vibe
Call my rap  and you are guaranteed to feel the night

The Temptation,No Rest For The Sickest,2012,"At high school she was known as a sweetheart
Good girl gone bad, but where do we start?
She liked the rich kids who shouldn't be rich
She dated Tommy Tommy Ghettho, Tommy hoodlum like shit
She love the funds that he making from his drug lab
Try to keep it on the sly, she know he got his gun dacked
The younger dealers yeah they catching her eye
Shes thinking well hes younger and hes pulling cash from the sky
So on the sly she gets his number right from Tommy G's phone
Thinking 'bout a booty call like Tommy he'll never know
She gotta make her mind up, so she making the call
He's keen to meet her, keen to smash her with her face to the floor
They meet a couple times shit, now she falling in love
Around the time he's meeting Tommy when he's scoring his drugs
She fucking round with the wrong cunts
Wine yeah she tops up, never in her mind is she trying to stop nah

Silly slut yeah she could've had it all
The temptation got the better, sent her for a fall
Now shes staring at the wall, not preparing for a war
Not knowing what she started
Where she standing when it all fall
Silly slut yeah she could've had it all
The temptation got the better, sent her for a fall
Now she's staring at the wall, not preparing for a war
Not knowing what she started
Where she standing when it all fall

Tommy kinda suss, in her bag he's finding drugs
He kinda know that she ain't normal, well in time he does
She rocking diamonds 'cause, always in the nicer stuff
She got the pricey cars, all because the guy she loves
But she ain't love him she just loving the gifts, right
Different night, find her sucking on a different guy
Dealer Dave, yeah he's paid for days
Maybe change his ways, he sense a dangerous day
'Cause Tommy following his missus
And he sees her as she kisses
Davey, Davey crazy lately maybe in love, well he wishes
Tommy got a gat, left side in the dash
See her fucking head splash as she goes in for the pash
Tommy walks to Davey, looks him right in the eye
Davey looking down the nine and it's time to say goodbye
They both dead now Tommy lonely as fuck
They got the same outcome as someone owing him bucks, shit

Silly slut yeah she could've had it all
The temptation got the better, sent her for a fall
Now she dead up on the floor, with her head split into four
Not knowing she ain't breathing, she ain't getting it no more nah
Silly slut yeah she could've had it all
The temptation got the better, sent her for a fall
Now she's staring at the wall, not preparing for a war
Not knowing what she started
Where she standing when it all fall",https://genius.com/Kerser-the-temptation-lyrics
The Time,No Rest For The Sickest,2012,"It's dedicated to cunts who said I wouldn't make shit
Like this
I'm in another world
Fuck
Yeah
Yo, what up Nebs?
Kerser

What I just take? Yeah my brain gone
I'm in the club, kind of obvious, my shades on
This is how I make reality a fake dream
Nothing can be as bad as it may seem
Lot of mates carry scars, they're the hood's marks
Treat my life like a joke, it's a good laugh
In the city of the state that I don't know
3 A.M. still get stopped for them photos
Adaption is a fraction of my mind and its reaction
Satisfaction come from passion, what is lacking Scott is smashing
The whole fucking scene, piss test unclean
Test twice just means get high trust me
I'm the man to keep it real to the death
That's why the scene hates me, 'cause they feeling the threat
Crush a pill with a card, mix it in with the coke
Snort the line, rock the show, that's the life, what you know

It's the life, it's the mic, it's the time, this is mine
And I'm gonna rap this out and be the one to shine
It's the lights, it's the night, it's the lines, it's my mind
I'm living life so fast, I don't know if I'm living right
It's the life, it's the mic, it's the time, this is mine
And I'm gonna rap this out and be the one to shine
It's the lights, it's the night, it's the lines, it's my mind
I'm living life so fast, I don't know if I'm living right

I'm in space bitch, I'm in another world
You can get here, you just gotta toke another swirl
The city lights, it's so distant to me
I'm from the streets and I hear it's a district to see
The South West, home of drive byes, shot dead, high five
Come and visit here, you won't find us in our right mind
Got a big dream I'm missing the tunnel
Making sure I don't forget I got it inked in my knuckles
It's the life, stone cold, might go buy myself some gold
Only time I've ever had it when I stole it, and it's sold
Long gone, probably broke in your house once
That's in the past so I'm keeping my mouth shut
Live gutter, fucking oath didn't chose it
Where do you think I'd be now if there wasn't music?
Or better yet if I didn't have a fan base
You're lucky that you noticed 'cause this could have been a damn waste

It's the life, it's the mic, it's the time, this is mine
And I'm gonna rap this out and be the one to shine
It's the lights, it's the night, it's the lines, it's my mind
I'm living life so fast, I don't know if I'm living right
It's the life, it's the mic, it's the time, this is mine
And I'm gonna rap this out and be the one to shine
It's the lights, it's the night, it's the lines, it's my mind
I'm living life so fast, I don't know if I'm living right

I ain't home much, but when I am though
I lock myself in my room and try and lay low
Throw a beat, rip it up,
 
smoking weed, sipping cups
Everybody saying that I have to go and live it up
Give a fuck, bout a hater I'ma catch you later, mate
I got a plane I gotta board I'm landing and I get the paper
Not fair right, well yeah try it, compare rhymes
Mine rare tight, I swear I'm the man
I won't quit, no not yet, I'm on a roll
Came so far in this game, got them rotten souls
And new kicks I move quick
 the tune is
Set when I do this, 
met with producers
Lot of them are clueless, Nebs got to do this
Now we in the studio, killing with round two it's
Definitely a classic when we killing the booth
Xanax, cough medicine, I'm spilling the truth

It's the life, it's the mic, it's the time, this is mine
And I'm gonna rap this out and be the one to shine
It's the lights, it's the night, it's the lines, it's my mind
I'm living life so fast, I don't know if I'm living right
It's the life, it's the mic, it's the time, this is mine
And I'm gonna rap this out and be the one to shine
It's the lights, it's the night, it's the lines, it's my mind
I'm living life so fast, I don't know if I'm living right

Yeah, so am I living right?
Feeling like a fucking miracle man
I come from nothing, no food, no money
To having big dinners
Every days like my birthday
Fuck, in another world here
When did this all happen?
Fucking oath I'm loving it though
ABK, I'm never stopping
I'm not stopping now
There's no rest for the sickest
Fuck it, I'm gonna go straight through
Yo keep that rolling
Can you pass my paper bruz?
Nah to the right
Under that, yeah
Alright yo",https://genius.com/Kerser-the-time-lyrics
The Truth,King,2014,"Yeah, awh shit!
King Kerser
I'm with Nebs once again
And um, I think it's time to kick it off yeah?

Warn them I'm a problem, they ain't wanna mess with that
I jump on the cunts skull, you just wrestle rap
Believe Kers, I'm the man of this new shit
Don't send me no beats unless Nebs has produced it
It's stupid but we killing these cunts
I'm a different type of high, like putting pills in a blunt
I told 'em ""once I kill the game, Ima give it a rest""
I'd rather say ""Fuck 'em all"" then ever sit on the fence
But that's the attitude I've gots and the attitude I carry on
Sadie bag in my luggage that I carry-on
Flight to flight, ain't no city I can't touch
Everytime my drop album, it's raising the bar up
Higher and higher, you admire my rhyming
You will never find the same, if you do they are biting
Bitches saying Nebs bangers got 'em rocking their bed
If that's the case then Kers lyrics be the cock to your head - ya ganga
 x2
Ain't nobody really gonna care about 'em in the end
And they gonna fall and stumble, I'll be laughing off my fucking head
And you can all be taking 'bout the bullshit they be feeding you
But come back when you realise that they lying and you need the truth

ABK, that the team - we a hurricane
See me at your sister party with your brothers chain
King Kers making capital K's
Put a junior to their name if they're rapping this way (Let's go)
Kerser been the greatest, got the haters even hating
Haters not sure if they rate us, or they hate us cos their fucking ladies
Wanna fucking fuck us, fuckin' that's a lot of fucking fucking
Wonder if they cumming, if they coming I've got something they've been waiting for
My daughter, kick back like a set trap
And leave your brain on the wall, I told 'em to get back
That's what I told my lawyer, anyway it was their strap
Fingerprint that shit, my hands were not there lad
It's easy with the rapping, play it out in my head
But I will get you knocked if you out off a threat
About a brother I roll with or anything else
That will threaten what I do will let it settle itself - The King
 x2
Ain't nobody really gonna care about 'em in the end
And they gonna fall and stumble, I'll be laughing off my fucking head
And you can all be taking 'bout the bullshit they be feeding you
But come back when you realise that they lying and you need the truth

I give my life away, you say I hide away
You say I said I never said I said I mightin' make it
Through the fame and the problems with my brain
Mixing Xannies with Cocaine
Thinking everything's ok
I gotta kinda different outlook
I'm doing this for proud crooks
There's some things you wouldn't touch on
With holding anger, got you feeling like a punch on
'Member when they said I wouldn't be nothing
And the cops would see the crew and the dogs would just cuff 'em
With me too off course, spitting in a piggy wagon
Didn't really give a fuck, I was spitting at 'em
The industry wouldn't really see my point of view
If I send a maniac with a gat and point at you
We raised different, my brain lifted
Insane, twisted, then the games shifted
 x2
Ain't nobody really gonna care about 'em in the end
And they gonna fall and stumble, I'll be laughing off my fucking head
And you can all be taking 'bout the bullshit they be feeding you
But come back when you realise that they lying and you need the truth

The truth, the truth is right here
In a scene surrounded by bullshit
We remain at the top, stay real
And that's why we stand out
You're over there doing your thing
And we're thinking you're a suss cunt
We're laughing at ya
King!
Yo Nebs - we done it again!
Fucking morons, fucking idiots",https://genius.com/Kerser-the-truth-lyrics
The Vibe,,2018,"Anythin' I touch you know turn into a hit
It ain't the gift of the gab, it's just a gift of the sick
It had me lost in the ways, with the wave of the weed
I make the shit that you love, I re-created the scene
I mean, nowadays bro, they callin' me an icon
Every time I write songs, remind you why my hype strong
Over years I got a stigma like it's ""do drugs""
But the whole time I wrote the shit that gives you goosebumps
Win so much and I guarantee I win more
Did enough for the scene, why they whinge for?
I'm still fucked from back in day, poppin' imports
A lot changed from puttin' Kerser on the brick wall
I made the soundtrack for your last nine years
So many pills that it's hard for me to try steer
Fall asleep when I drive, blame the seat heater
So much weed, have to chop it with a meat cleaver
They hear me on the block like a street sweeper
A jackpot if you get me on the free feature
I set trends, I don't say that 'cause it sounds good
I stand out 'cause I got a different outlook
Nation-wide, I blew up, bitches try to get with me
She after D, we call her the fuckin' letter E
My neck sore 'cause I keep gettin' new chains
Got my daughter jewellery, hope it helps her tooth pain
Tables turned, fat stacks, make my pants sagged
I'm already set, don't jump on the bandwag'
Choppin' up cuz I need to get this shit dismantled
Best rhymes I think of when I'm holdin' scissor handles
Oh, you ain't heard I'm the man of this shit?
""Wait a Minute"" made 'em trip, man, I never will quit, nope
Favourite rapper, look, you know me for a while now
I still been killin' all this shit on this side of town
Had a break, think they thought that I was lyin' down
I been thinkin' ""who the fuck should I be signin' now?""
Run and tell 'em, ""oh the Kerser on his shit again""
Made it by myself, never had to try fittin' in
She pulled her pants down, I ain't try stick it in
She took it straight to her face like her Instagram
It demand so smooth that the shit hurt
If they said that it's ""dope"" then it is Kers
Red eyes, too smashed, I still look the same
Same attitude too man, I couldn't change
You know the name, I ain't new to the hits
I'm the king, add that if you reviewin' this shit
Shit, pills had me stressin' no denying the shit
Dropped ""Bad Habits"" and that proved that I'm not hidin' the shit
Looking back, I can't believe I was relyin' on it
Haters come but that's what happens when you as fly as it gets
Three spliffs, five cups up in first class
Flight attendant fightin' over who should serve us
Billboards, toppin' charts look familiar now
Five years ago you knew me from your dealer's house
Got a bag in my pocket and it's vacuum sealed
Eyes are funny 'cause I'm fuckin' popping smackie pills
What you mean it's a curse? I'm a rare breed
A generous cunt, but I never like to share weed
It ain't about how many words you can rhyme
It's more about the fact I shine and it's like Kerser's a vibe, right
Got the aura of a motherfuckin' superstar
I got reminded, you feel that 'cause that is who you are
Who's who? Trippin' out with the red eyes
Have a sesh under bridge on the M5
Never mind, shit, I keep having flashbacks
'Cause ABK's way more then some raps lad
Only know what to do when it's too late
New fans, new money, brings new hate
Needed back the vibe we had before the spotlight
Need another hit, you wait until I drop right
Man it's me, I don't drop nothing but hits
You hate but on the low, you know you still pumpin' my shit
Quick, get em ready 'cause I'm different with rap
I'm the reason why they watchin', put the shit on the map
It's a banger after banger, been on fire since the nangas
Had the cadence of a player, made these haters act like gangas
King, and I don't need no mad hook
I just gave you some more shit up out my scrap book

They Don't Wanna Hear,The Nebulizer,2011,"He says he got the ounces cheap and it's a good look
If he can move them quick back with the hood shook
He flipped his shit and wanted more to sell than Mary Jane
The older lads use to warn him it's a scary game
He didn't listen made a quick move to ecstasy and to cocaine and heroin eventually
Over years he held his rep and stood a staunch cunt
The type of fella every motherfucker talks up
He gets the word another dealer beats his prices
The other dealer ruthless not known to be the nicest
But he ain't hearing that reaches for his nearest gat
Finds the motherfuck heavy trigger 'til he hears a spat
He brags the fact around hope others will fall back
Then he's found dead, what the fuck you gonna call that?
No matter who you are you're thinking you're the sickest shit
The morale of the story guaranteed there's always bigger fish

These the stories that they block and they don't wanna hear
Streets are talking never stop we gonna rock it, yeah
Never in life will I see the
Day they control what I speak, nah
These the stories that they block and they don't wanna hear
Streets are talking never stop we gonna rock it, yeah
Never in life will I see the
Day they control what I speak, nah

She knows the fellas check her out and yes she likes it
Her friend tells her be a stripper so she tries it
She making money in her play boy bunny ears
Drunk cunt turns up after a hundred beers
Offers extra if she leaves and comes home with him
She agrees for the money, drugs and extra drinks
He gets her home and smacks her up and fucking beats down
Call the cops what shit she can't even speak now
He lets her go black eyes messed up pants around her ankles
She too sore to pull the dress up
She tells her boss the bossing is tripping like who's this
She show the place now he's going in to do shit
They out the front the boss stops says shut your face
Put the gat to her head it's his brothers place
Thicker than water brother, sister or daughter
Never saw her and morn her wishing they knew it all but

These the stories that they block and they don't wanna hear
Streets are talking never stop we gonna rock it, yeah
Never in life will I see the
Day they control what I speak, nah
These the stories that they block and they don't wanna hear
Streets are talking never stop we gonna rock it, yeah
Never in life will I see the
Day they control what I speak, nah

He's doing routs and armed robs across Sydney
He got a bank to crack and I ain't talking piggy
He didn't know the crew he had was gonna snitch nah
He done a bunch of jobs with them over the six months
The shit cunts switched and snitched fuck
Now he's in his cell but he ain't about to quit nah
He's done his time now he's searching for his old crew
Take them out one by one 'cause they told true
Suburban stories got you spinning with your lights out
This the type of shit the neighbourhood be doing right now
Don't be blinded, it be easy to see be you'd be
Surprised the types of cunts that meet me for  yeah
The streets are moving you just never hear the truth lad
Drive-by on houses even the motherfuckers shoot back
The true fact signing out from the south-west
People chasing paper 'til they ain't 
have

They Will Never Understand,No Rest For The Sickest,2012,"Yeah, just gonna let it all out on this one
Its not all fun and games
This is peoples lives
This is my life

See me happy man? Thats a fake smile
I got a lot on my plate this might take a while
Take a seat turn your brain off and listen up
And maybe by the end you'll know why I don't give a fuck
We was living in hell, I thought of killing myself
Got boys sitting in cells, I try to spit cause it helps
Plus my dads sick my life is getting drastic
And magazines had to hide to ask me ""What's this lad shit?""
I give a fuck about a trend or an adlay
I only dress like this just to show you I have pay
Cause I ain't used to that I used to be a putrid chat
And ain't no way will you ever find me moving back
I'm proving facts that I'm nice on the beat
I like to take away the lives of people ice on the street
Cause I've seen it ruin lives, breaking families to bits
And don't you call that shit soft, come and handle how we live kid

Its all out and its going around
Its the only reason why I put the bottle down
They will never understand, I'm the way that I am
Until they do I guess Im gonna have to say it again
I try, fly by, but my mind is side swiped
At night night, I fight fight and bye bye
I try hard but I can't escape
I'm so real, too real, nah I can't be fake

That addiction is yours, dont inflict it on others
Your mistake now are you listening fucker
I ain't need to see the whole crew fucked up
This shit be spreading like a plague and people see but shut up
You need to speak about the evil you see
But no one wanna do that fuck it leave it to me
My older brother in rehab I should be by his side
But I ain't got the guts, he's stronger I will do it in time
Hah, do it in time, thats all I ever tell myself
Cause if I put it off that means today I can just do myself
And doin me that ain't something that you wanna be
Without the rhymes I'm nothing just a loser now I gotta see
The truth hurts, so this album took the life of me
I'm just me it's fucked its nothing I even try and be
When I say I'm real dont think that Im talking tough
I mean that I'm real and I am just a fuck up

Its all out and its going around
Its the only reason why I put the bottle down
They will never understand, Im the way that I am
Until they do I guess I'm gonna have to say it again
I try, fly by, but my mind is side swiped
At night night, I fight fight and bye bye
I try hard but I can't escape
I'm so real, too real, nah I can't be fake

At the moment its the truth I'mma speak it
Tell the truth Im too scared to release it
That kinda contradicts my other tracks I do know
Call me a liar I ain't know what to do bro
Never happy deep down I'm fucked up
Bud puffed, drugs tucked, left side, lung crushed
Thats enough to make me quit right there
You would think so but to quit I swear
I would have to change my life and get the fuck away
Tomorrow ain't exciting man its just another fucking day
I'm skin and bones, Im a motherfucking wreck shit
I meant to let 'em know that I will never tread quick
Cause I'm scared I ain't feeling like I'm better yet
I'm walking slow and its getting worse with every step
I run away and meet the front of a train
The side covered in stains, Im high and nothing remains, nah

Its all out and its going around
Its the only reason why I put the bottle down
They will never understand, Im the way that I am
Until they do I guess I'm gonna have to say it again
I try, fly by, but my mind is side swiped
At night night, I fight fight and bye bye
I try hard but I can't escape
I'm so real, too real, nah I can't be fake

Yeah, and I find it ironic
That the higher I get
The lower I'm digging myself in a hole
Its funny that
Yeah come outside aye

This for the Street,Tradition,2016,"Kers one I ain't down with the rap scene
I just proved I’m a motherfucking cash machine
Did everything I said I’d do plus more
One call could have your bitch at my front door
Last album at the scene like no shit
And add a world to my bank, I’ma go get
Everything I can and I’ll bring the crew too
A bunch of crazy cunts, now tell me who to shoot, woo
We have fun with all the dead set shit, bitch
Don’t get it twisted you could end up dead quick
I came a long way, you should see the new whip
And my house, you’d probably want to move in
Aus rap got it locked, I’m the main man
Six years at the top and I’ve stayed there
You cunts using rocks like a caveman
Your bitch want me on her body like a spray tan

This for the street, for the ways that you made me
This for gang members that they called crazy
This the bomb, this the shit that you wait on
This is Kers, guarantee I always stay strong
This for the street, for the ways that you made me
This for gang members that they called crazy
This the bomb, this the shit that you wait on
This is Kers, guarantee I always stay strong

Rocking gold in the club I’m performing in
Want the check before I even start walking in
No one else hustle rap like the Kers do
Got my foot in, getting money was the first move
I admitted I was broke when I was, bruz
But now I’m cashed so of course I hold my wads up
Get a load of me, I’m a fucking superstar
And rappers hate because no one knows who you are
Rolling deep in my range and the crew ready
No cameras here ‘cause they wanted and they do the damage
King Kers, ABK, what you know about
If you sent your demo, sorry bro I throw ‘em out
I’m a beast when it come to the rap shit
No talking heads or tails, come and watch some cash flip
The lads sick in the booth and It’s crazy
Shout out to C-Town, I loved how you raised me

This for the street, for the ways that you made me
This for gang members that they called crazy
This the bomb, this the shit that you wait on
This is Kers, guarantee I always stay strong
This for the street, for the ways that you made me
This for gang members that they called crazy
This the bomb, this the shit that you wait on
This is Kers, guarantee I always stay strong

Know the Kers, I’m the man with this
Send you home from my gig in the ambulance
Or in some bandages, ‘cause I can’t stand your shit
And it hurts your pride, ‘cause you’re a fan of this
And I dismantle shit with the candle tip
And try to make the shit sharp and hit your man with this
ABK, bitch, so you’ve heard of us
The realest rapper 'round, yeah we serve it up, cunt

This for the street, for the ways that you made me
This for gang members that they called crazy
This the bomb, this the shit that you wait on

This My Life,No Rest For The Sickest,2012,"This is drugs, this is something that you can't undo
This my life, this is everything I'm running to
This the story of the lad from out C-Town
Rags to riches so you know I'm gonn be proud
I light a spliff you light it up, its exciting
Cause ain't another aussie rapper providing
The shit I am, its Ritalin the ADD and maybe he crazily insane, a freak that made it through the dangerous streets
Still got my blade on me, still ABK engraved in me, still made to say I hate the scene so they dont try relate to me
And what's it takin' me? It's nearly taken all
Overdose around the corner I embrace my fault
Now I face the floor I'm buggin buzzin Codeine
Used to come down half the shit goes up my nose stream
And I ain't really one for lessons in life
Fuck a church you got my albums for confession and my

You feel my presence tonight
Rock till the end of your life
Im one a kind youll never find
Another deadly as I
Another speed up on the road
And they tryin' to make it slow
Right down but I know why
Around you find me so high
Lemme live it terminate it in my own right
Cause what I've overcome is special
Did it in my own time
The street has made its way
I thank me for that
The one lad in Aussie rap
That put the street shit on the map, yeah

Kerser never fail hit em where it hurts
Cause im living like I'm cursed
Winnin' wishin' to reverse
Many things I done but oh well that shit in the past now
Time to close the curtains, who gonn drink until the last round?
I show my life unwrap
My fans will give theirs right on back
I'm living in a vital crash
Escaping when I rhyme on tracks
Ain't never seen it similar
You dumb it down your simpler
Your head set on fire, pushed against the gas cylinder

Corrosive fuckin oath explosive, dopest let em know its potent
Hopin that I may be jokin', smokin' tokin' overdosin'
Why these ladies damn near begging for cock
Before I rapped this skinny fucker couldn't get em to stop
But I guess that's just the fame, ain't it crazy man I'm spinnin out
So much on my mind I got no time to stop and think about
The ins and outs, the do's and dont's
Im here until my dreams approached, and when it is I chose the rope that stops the air and bruise my throat
Way to think, I think I'm out I think about a different route, Im sittin down with 50 pounds I need the fuckin scissors now
This is how my brain can go and switch off
Didn't follow footsteps now these veterans are pissed off
Think I did but fuck you faggots had your time shit
I'll do it twice as big, thought I told these cunts that I'm sick
Time ticks and it's going quite quick
But I knew my life is exactly how I write this

Grab the moment, hold it get it, never let it slip you meant it
If you let it go and send it, can't be one that be forget it
Remember me like a better dream or nightmare
Demanding what I want and no way am I gonna fight fair
They took enough of this for all them years I'm living broke
I'm gonna get it back, they can't do shit because I'm spittin dope
So take it in, yeah I hope you fucking know now

This Tha Jam,S.C.O.T.,2013,"Giddy up slut yeah you a bad bitch
All these rappers act a part call them Brad Pitt
Oh no here he goes again
I flow dope fuck you up like some opium
We in Sydney bitch, chilling up in C-Town
Bitches knock me back in school, I guarantee they're keen now
Tell 'em fuck off, I got money to make
Me and Nebs equal cash that is something you ain't
So let's journey through the mind of a sick cunt
Dollar signs inside my eyelids, no I won't slip up
Every time I blink now, you know how I think
Walking in the club behind the bar and grabbing a drink, bitch
Day to day with the ABK
They want me banned in Queensland like I'm Lazy Grey, ayy
Top charts yeah, that's what we does
Number one motherfucker ain't no stopping us bruz

This the jam this the one where you break shit
This the one where you're fucking on ya mate's bitch
This the one that ya gonna do a stretch for
So play this song as your plea when you step in court
This the jam this the one where you break shit
This the one where you're fucking on ya mate's bitch
This the one that ya gonna do a stretch for
So play this song as your plea when you step in court

I'm so fresh, no expiry date
Getting interviews they ask me what it's like to be great mate
I can't explain,  its the way I was born
Your bitch four finger deep keen on making the porn
Raw
It's what I am never toning it down
If they beef with me, I guarantee they won't be around
Got nearly every Aussie rapper mad, screaming in mics now
Throw in the fucking towel tell these faggots to lie down
Kers one, I'm getting stupid with money
Best producer in the country got ya dancing getting funky
What they do for a chance on a Nebs beat
Tell 'em ten K, another ten they can get me
On a hook, hitting notes so high
Everything I drop, they buy
So smashed eyes red and they half closed
Popping pills at my show hit the stage and pass low

This the jam this the one where you break shit
This the one where you're fucking on ya mate's bitch
This the one that ya gonna do a stretch for
So play this song as your plea when you step in court
This the jam this the one where you break shit
This the one where you're fucking on ya mate's bitch
This the one that ya gonna do a stretch for
So play this song as your plea when you step in court

Rappers act arrogant, it makes me sick
'Cause they bite the whole style from my latest shit
These days the weed blazed, walking down the freeway
Watching my clips and you stopping them to replay
I'm coming for your cash like a debt collector
And the blunts I puff smell like air freshener
In the brand new suit with a blue tie too
You don't know my crew you in two-five-two
What the fuck is that? I make custom rap
And other rappers bite me but the cunts are wack
Plus Nebs got producers fucking scratching their heads
We call 'em out I see em run like I'm cracking their necks
Album three in three years we going ten for ten
I'm looking out to your crowd it's only men, men
Talking 'bout the underground and how they keeping it raw
Motherfucker please, I got more people waiting at an in store

This the jam this the one where you break shit
This the one where you're fucking on ya mate's bitch
This the one that ya gonna do a stretch for
So play this song as your plea when you step in court
This the jam this the one where you break shit
This the one where you're fucking on ya mate's bitch
This the one that ya gonna do a stretch for

Throw Away Bars,,2013,"I can touch your heart you just be prepared
Purer real swear to god you can see it there
If I missed and I didn't make the rap shit
Il be in a flat making 20s of a chat stick
And that's sick I ain't a sucker right
Prepare me back when I was repping hustlehard
Dropping bars in a car park dead broke
About to make it gunster new it from the get-go
I maybe wrong tho you would have to ask him
Every second track I write I put my heart in
I hit the road hard anything to spread my name
At least 9years of rap till I was getting paid
Note to other rappers put that work in
Be patient work hard that's what Kers did
These new comers think they gonna make it any set
So they rush forgetting that there's plenty seconds left
Plus they bittin me but that shit I brush it off
My first track I told the world to go and suck a cock
But that's my attitude I thankyou for your gratitude
Baby you just stop and let me show you how rap I do
So fresh so smooth let me catch your eyeball
Yeah They hate but why did I catch your eye for?
Ima maniac a genetic freak
You see the proof of this any time I get a beat
Picture 5 cunts driving with a shotgun
Chasing cash they hate cause they ain't got none
That's reality, thanks to rap tho
I got a nice way of living with the cash flow
I keep my soul kinda high in the right way
For now on aus rap is in my name
Im gonna fly away any minute hibernate
Take my soul to paradise something that my mind creates
I could die today never be alive again
Hustle from my grave before I leave I would never sign my name
Fuck the rap scene I make my own path
Cold world and the water here froze us
Was that a metaphor for you to go and work it out
Keep rewinding everytime I swear its perfect bra
I would never be the same im dealing with a heap of fame
And I don't need the radio to break your fucking speakers m8
And I preaching hate Im preaching that I reach the day
I could say Ive reached the day of my existence hey
Till that happens ild be chasing this rap shit
That's all you get for now cause im chasing the cash bitch!",https://genius.com/Kerser-throw-away-bars-lyrics
Todd Burrows R.I.P,,2011,"Hold the tears back nows the time for you to get away end of day
We all know that you be in that better place
Member you was 12 me and boobs would get our drink on
You was in the garage asking us if we could spit songs
I think on
I think even further back
And even not so long ago you flipped when you heard the track
That I pressed record but still it ain't about Scott
Just wanted to let you know that man I swear to god it meant alot
We rep st Andrews you was there and you was down too
Now its fucked up coz now they say its where they found you its not even right
That some gronk with a knife wouldn't drop it and fight now its cost you your life nah
Keep your head up up in heavens where you now live
Want to let you know we sent your fam some flowers your presence had effect on everyone remembers you
So I sip my drink your still on earth we just pretend its true
Bullshit dramas
They say its over two cans
Someone pulled a knife they tried to be a big man
It ain't the same but so many feel ya pain
Written down in sentence man
I dont know what to say
You said you played my shit atleast like fifteen times a day
I swear to god when you said that I got goosebumps and walked away
I wasn't being rude I hope you never thought I was
You know I wasn't lad
I was shocked and had to walk it off
They tell me you was even scribblin' down your own rhymes
I heard ya dad found out about ya different phone lines
Its fucked up it not fair is god there
With much love
We got there
Its not rare
Lad he took you coz he picked you out of who you are
As much as people miss ya man he musta needed ya
You was younger but I had the chance to meet ya man
Light my spliffs hit my drink untill we ever meet again
Ain't spitten no hard rhymes
Night time your star shines
It ain't eazy but I guess its a hard life
Wish you knew the impact
That you really did have
Your up there looking down feet up now sit back
This that
Dedication that is write for you
Kick back relax for you to listen to your boys keep telling me that you looked up to my rhymes and honestly it shouldn't but it really fucks with my mind
So the least I can do
Is release this for you
And play it so fucking loud that the speakers will blew
As I reach for a brew
And now im speaking to you
I'll state the obvious
You really leaving to soon
Your killers will get karma
Yip twice as harder
Tod Burrows jr named after ya father
From the west to east they may respect and speak
Dedication real rhymes lad rest in peace",https://genius.com/Kerser-todd-burrows-rip-lyrics

How you feel? I'm back again, every track immaculate
Kinda obvious, droppin' this hottest shit
Gotta give everything I got if I wanna live
Like this, the way I've been
Proof I'm the boss, don't play with me
Everyone's 'street' till they on the street
Then they meet street cunts like, ""What ya mean?""
All us now like, ""What the fuck?""
Didn't really help that you talked it up
Then you get rolled and rip your stuff
And they offer it to me for like fifty bucks
Shifty cunts, call it what you want
We them C-Town boys that are all grown up
Got a mate and he's lookin' for work
If I give him a job, someone in the dirt
Bounce back, it's the Kers on the track
They call me the king, yeah, you heard of me, lad?
Should've seen me back in o-four
Would've been like, ""Oh me? Oh lord""
Jumped up, high as shit
With a brand new kit and a brand new whip
I'm the man who did the impossible
Take-off, shit I must've had rocket fuel
Gotta do what I do on the daily
Got the radio scared to play me
I'm the Kers bitch, don't say ""Baby""
Eyes are red and I smell all hazy
Every heard a motherfucker sick yelling, ""Kerser!""
Do it in my sleep when I'm rippin' the words up
Said enough yeah, you know the name

Fall flat, the king is back
Pick any track, it's a single lad
Let me crawl deep inside your head
Disconnect some shit and they find you dead
Listen when I flow, jaws hit the floor
Your head hits floor, I kick some more
Kinda twisted, mind is missin'
Certain parts, I might be trippin'
Then again, who the fuck are you?
Claim that you rich, that ain't fuckin' true
You cunts talk shit and force your rep
And while I live big, I don't need to mention
The houses, cars, jewelry, ahh
Everything else that they dreamin', brah
Hit with the facts when I spit the tracks
Stood out from the crowds, I don't fit the packs
Sittin' back off my head off a X pill
Kinda rare 'cause I feel like a M pill
Outta touch I'm an astronaut
Ain't play no game but I have to score
Different sound every time I drop
And they kinda shocked like why I'm not
Helpin' them like, ""What the fuck?""
I had no help from them when I was stuck
Rappers these days, they don't know shit
They postin' pics' with the blokes they diss
That's not for me, I'm out of that
I'ma just rap and buy houses lad
Chase your dream until the dream can catch
Up to where you're reachin' at
That's advice from the G.O.A.T of Aus

They told me get back
What you struggle for makes sense why I get cash
And life change just like people do
You see the pain in my eyes when I speak to you
Funny how your best friend can turn into your enemy
I coulda got lost in the trap if I let it be
Copper chase, hit the legs, watch the night go
Tell the lookout ""if you spot 'em, yell out 5-0""
Livin' in the moment, you see it as a bliss but
Dirty coppers only swung when they got my wrist cuffed
I'm from a different cloth, if it's Kers it isn't Scott
Life threw me obstacles but never did I think to stop
My dream man it came true, stayed in the same crew
When you get pay and you brag people hate you
Just for now I'm out cold on my last hope
People lost rackin' lines with their last smoke

Please never leave if you leave I'll break
Meet my mate, I guess drugs are my 5-8
So lost and I can't be found
I'm underground with a hundred pound
Please never leave if you leave I'll break
Meet my mate, I guess drugs are my 5-8
So lost and I can't be found
I'm underground where the drugs are found

And how I escape well I sit and blaze
You won't never hear the truth from the things they say
I'll take your brain for a walk, and you must not hate
You see hungry kids where the fuckin' gunshots lay
You see dealers, see knives, with no regard for lives
And these rappers rapping 'bout how the rainbows is nice shit
I don't expect them to understand, but to open up your eyes and maybe come and stand and try
Visualise life on the street, we got heart
And label your raps as whack it's not art
Exaggerate what? I ain't exaggerate shit
If you knew what I mean, you knew I had to make it
Had to pack out shows, gave the street a voice
Used to dack our drugs when I meet the boys
Our only escape, when we roamin' the streets
My lifeline was rapping, hope you know what I mean
And please

Please never leave if you leave I'll break
Meet my mate, I guess drugs are my 5-8
So lost and I can't be found
I'm underground with a hundred pound
Please never leave if you leave I'll break
Meet my mate, I guess drugs are my 5-8
So lost and I can't be found
I'm underground where the drugs are found",https://genius.com/Kerser-underground-lyrics
Until I Break,Engraved In The Game,2017,"We have gone away
I think these times'll be replaced
I am never past
I'll make this last until I break

Rainy days ain't a challenge for me no more
I ain't know most these rappers, they just don't talk
I broke records, made money thenthey treat me funny
Weird cycle, keep it movin', they can't teach me nothin'
City range train stretched out of C-Town
Jigged
 school and get lost in the weed clouds
Then hit the shops, we was dackin' D12 then
Now the most racked album in this whole land
Is the Kers, ain't that trippy as fuck?
I can't blame the kids now when I was rippin' the stuff
Bro, I'm the one they said would never, ever make it
And I did, that's why I rub it in their faces
Dropped the greatest catalogue the scene has seen
I don't know how I made it, I'm just bein' me
I'm a weapon, ain't need no one by my fuckin' side
That's just a bonus, I'm a hustler, I fuckin' grind

We have gone away
I think these times'll be replaced
I am never past
I'll make this last until I break

It's different went I roll through, it's different when the Kers here
I take away your pain, I got a way for you to burn tears
Still on top till the day that I quit
And even then, they won't stop, they'll keep playin' my shit

Thursday nights at MacArthur Square
Around when I was sixteen, that's the spot, it was there
Before they done it all up, cunts was runnin' amok
No social media but these are all times of the past
I'm bringin' memories, I'm makin' sure that they live on
Give you shivers if you lived it, it's your best song
Copper
 chases, yellin' ""run, run, run""
I had a target on my back, I found it fun, fun, fun
Now I'm livin' so different, paid from a rap tune
You don't need to respect it man, you have to
Reppin' ABK, Jesus, even back then
From the era, makin' flowies out of black pens
That's the writers, now let me shout the hustlers
The ones who had the whole town as their customers
You'd see your mate gettin' on at the same time
This when crews was stabbin' cunts on the train line

We have gone away
I think these times'll be replaced
I am never past
I'll make this last until I break

It's different went I roll through, it's different when the Kers here
I take away your pain, I got a way for you to burn tears

Unwritten Letter,No Rest For The Sickest,2012,"Yeah
This one's for my brothers
Stracey and Shoey
Yeah, check it out

I woke up, punched a cone, it was eight AM
I heard some voices hit the window, I ain't playing man
Seen the coppers driven drawn, out the front and back lawn
Thinking ""fuck it man, I'm gone"" they screaming, lay down on the floor
I ask em ""What I do?"" ""Where's the warrant?"" ""What you here for?""
They give me papers, told me that they searching, I ain't need your
Asking where the gun, from the stick up that you done
Thinking stick up eat a dick up, then they say they got my bruz
And they saying phones are tapped, I ain't needing to hear that
They put me in the cuffs, a couple knees up in my back
I say they got their story twisted, feeling like I'm in a hole
And Stracey tripping too because he fresh out and he on parol
I'm sitting at the station, in the bubble, here comes trouble
'Cause I'm next to Stracey with the Xanny, single popped a double
He looks me in the eye, no comment and we smile
And he tells me ""Kerser man I'm going to be locked up for a while""
So it breaks my heart the interview, deny it all I know the go
I'm worried 'bout my brother but he marches on, he knows the flow
They ain't find shit at my house so my charges man they nothing
Big they pinning you for everything and I can't do a fucking thing
You keep your head up brother yeah that battle that's tomorrow
And we think I'm gonna miss it and he blame himself but god no
I'm a grown man brother, you ain't drag me into nothing
To this day he writes me letters saying that he feels he stuffed it
Reassure him quickly cuzzy no way will that be the case
I pleaded guilty to the charges, no way will i beat the case
Now back to when they got us and we thinking of the pitties
'Magine if I left them out the back , they probably would have shit it
And they said i can't leave Sydney, fuck that next day battle 60
Me and Ratesy we said fuck it travelled down there just to rip it
But I had you on my mind, I was stressed out over court
Payed my lawyer round four G’s just so that I could walk
They give another warning tell me this will be my last strike
I left the court to celebrate and then picked up a glass pipe
They thinking while I'm smoking this
The reason why we broke and I ain't wanna see another rock
My eyes, I keep them open
And I'm losing all my focus brother, when the fuck we turn to shit?
My bruz in prison cells and not enough to let him burn the bridge
I heard about the Shoey, I'ma try and go and see him too
But no one got his new number, I fucking hope i see him soon
I miss my fucking brothers we stay loyal to the end
That's the ABK the 225 we here until the death
I miss my fucking brothers we stay loyal to the end
That's the ABK the 225 we here until the death

March on, when everything falls down
Ain't no way around it, less we gonna pull the walls down
They took my brothers
The crew has just not been the same
I'm hoping if I speak today it means we gonna reach our fate
Life ain't fair, that's the cards on the street
Life ain't fair so its harder to be
A better human being but I'm trying, trying
A better human being but I'm dying dying
March on, when everything falls down
Ain't no way around it, less we gonna pull the walls down
They took my brothers
The crew has just not been the same
I'm hoping if i speak today it means we gonna reach our fate
Life ain't fair, that's the cards on the street
Life ain't fair so it's harder to be
A better human being but I'm trying, trying
A better human being but I'm dying dying",https://genius.com/Kerser-unwritten-letter-lyrics

Time flew shit the scene is a mess now
I remember they were hating when I made it big
Now they all begging me to come and save the shit
Funny how time almost change everything
Mini Kers clones everywhere, who let 'em in?
Wasn’t me, ask anyone that knows Kers
Who the man you call when you need a dope verse?
Gonna be a sad day when I leave the scene
I ticked all my goals off, I don’t need to dream
I’m getting over rap, I’m just being honest now
I’ve done enough to call it quits, I'ma stop it now
Wait a minute, gotta tour that I gotta do
Sold out Kers shows, this is nothing new
Who the fuck are you? I don’t know your raps bro
But I can tell you where you picked up that flow
And I can tell you where you got the whole swag from
I’m riding down the highway got a bag of
Fat buds, yeah I’m lighting up the good smoke
I don’t share, you hit this and you would choke
Where we end up, man I came a long way
Never weak 'cause we did this shit the strong way
Just triggered off a memory, I’m clogged up
I miss my mates, they miss life but they locked up
Sounds common these days till you lose count
I’m sick of people saying, “god, look at you now”
I had this dream forever and you never showed an interest
Maybe back then you should’ve asked me to invest
That’s why I’m arrogant, plus I’m mad cocky too
Everything I said I’d do, I go and fuckin' do
We the clique, I’m the king with the two fives
Other two in front of that you the new guys
Listen up I write beats, my flows too nice
Who writes lyrics like I do?
I’m way ahead of you like you never pay your dues
I went and made my moves right, that’s why I am too high
Always let my crew shine, I’m lappin’ rappers two times
They braggin’ ‘bout all the shit that I’d done before
Put the stacks next to Kers, they ain’t done it all
My swag brang money and my money brang swag
That’s the kinda shit that made the whole scene mad
The Kers Oner, sitting on your nerves fucker
Play this in the winter, so hot probably turn summer
Earn butter, I just spread it on my bread now
King Kers, I ain’t never been a let down
I could drip swag, right into a zip bag
Make it airtight then sniff that for impact
A kid back with a style that they duplicate
Ever say I’m falling from the top? You must be stupid mate
It’s all the same in the game so I switch lanes
I’ve been droppin’ hot shit since my mixtapes
I’ve been holding shit down, can’t deny that
You’d kill yourself if you try to be this fly lad
They put my tracks on the pedestal to pick at it
Yet they wonder why my hunger's gone, I’m sick of it
Told the crew at the start, I'ma run this
Now they like, “shit, look at what the cunt did”
Always had my back there so I appreciate
The headline so I’ll always leave the venue late
‘Member Gunsta came to mine for the film clip
Wish I listened to him then and that’s real shit
But it’s all good, I turned into a superstar
This rap game strange, watch how you moving brah
My heart's cold, I find it hard to trust cunts
I learned my lesson in the end we all fuck up
Fuck the scene bitch, I ain’t do a rapper tag
I’m so dope, they should put me in a satty bag
Light it up I set trends they can copy that
But they see it here first, yeah they're watchin’ that
Queue that came up, grew in front on cameras
Spending nights in studios, man they gon’ remember us
First up that was me, man I hustle hard
Who else could get rich off their fuckin' bars?
It’s the Kers man, I’m only known to kid fact
I ain’t here to compete, that’s a mismatch
Check the work rate, I ain’t had a break yet
Non stop work, probably why I made it
We gone ride this one till the wave break
I never took a loss, never need to safe face
Same lane, you ain’t even in the same race
Their rapping ‘bout shit that ain’t ever even take place
The K-E-R-S man I’m too sick, true shit
They watching how I do this
Watching all the movements, I’m making it look too 
cinch'
Swag floating in the air as I walk past
She got a wet puss, I’m giving you the forecast
Woke up, hit a joint then lay back down
'Cause my buds are the size of a hash brown
Oh yeah, too smooth, bring the Kers back
Squash the world in my hand, now the Earth flat
Hooked up worldwide, I might travel soon
Check me out this is how a real rapper do
So fresh but we’ll never be on 
So Fresh
Engraved In The Game, that is something you should go get
Don’t stress, you can catch me on the rebound
From the start bitch I been yelling ""C-Town""
I'ma cut it here, shit, turn the mic off
Smashed the beat hard, man they calling this a write off, Kers",https://genius.com/Kerser-wait-a-minute-lyrics
Waitin' For This,Tradition,2016,"I'm a C-Town boy, that never changed kid
Always rep for the hood, I'ma save this
Moved to the beach, came back the same week
Hopped out a range rover with a blazed spliff
Insane sick, the Kers, the cunt that rose up
The same rapper killing crews, man they froze up
Album six, so ridiculous
They call me wack, then copy Kers, they some hypocrites
Listen this, it's the shit you've been waiting on
I got a crew that'll kill you, come and take it gronk
God changed Oz rap, now he's gonna stop that
Making money, drop tracks, why they copy Scott? mad!
I take it as a compliment
Cos you wanna be me, fuck, you make it obvious
And my fans know, they can see right through it, bitch
Okay, that's off my chest, now watch me as I ruin this

Won't stop, won't quit, put the trust here
Not scared to get popped, shived cause its fuck fear
Whole life, I've been waiting for this
I mean, I die for this shit so come and ride for the king
Won't stop, won't quit, put the trust here
Not scared to get popped, shived cause its fuck fear
Whole life, I've been waiting for this
I mean, I die for this shit so come and ride for the king

Grabbing and dabbing a bitch's head like a rabbit
Yeah, I got a bad habit, my rap attacking you faggots
And, no, it has to to tragic, get me back up on my Kers shit
So sick that they want to bring the nurse in
Every album that I drop, hitting number one
They're used to it by now like, yeah, another one
Still, fuck the radio, do it on my own mate
Blowing stations up with a bomb that is homemade
Okay, is that a terrorist threat?
And has the media decided what they're calling it yet?
I never gave a fuck and man I'm still the same way
I did my first clip in a fucking lane way
Now I'm at the top, money my priority
Never let it in the way of my loyalty
You get excited when you knowing that the Kers arrive
It's going to be the same way til the Kerser dies

Won't stop, won't quit, put the trust here
Not scared to get popped, shived cause its fuck fear
Whole life, I've been waiting for this
I mean, I die for this shit so come and write for the king
Won't stop, won't quit, put the trust here
Not scared to get popped, shived cause its fuck fear
Whole life, I've been waiting for this
I mean, I die for this shit so come and write for the king

Ain't it better that you heard on this Oz map
I don't make hip hop, I make boss rap
Attitude's dark, cunt staying the same
I've been here a long time, I'm just playing the game
Give me awards, fucking give me applause
Now lay on floor and get the money out your drawers
It's the stick up shit, I'm the sickest kid
Should've listened in, I'm the friggen king

Won't stop, won't quit, put the trust here
Not scared to get popped, shived cause its fuck fear
Whole life, I've been waiting for this
I mean, I die for this shit so come and write for the king

Walk You Through This,Next Step,2015,"I told 'em two drinks here, I'ma sit and just think
And tell you bout me coming up while I'm sipping my drink
Well, it started with 
Boobz
, sixteen, smokin' freestyle
You're probably wonderin' why he's not on tour, meanwhile
There's a lot behind the story, let me break it down
Boobz didn't want the fame or he'd be tourin' with me now
He told me ""Scott, fucking make them bucks""
And now to every cunt, he's never asked to take em but
He got me into this shit so it prove he legit
Remember showing Rates my first track like ""what do ya think?""
He gave me confidence and told me ""fuck, you got it, you're sick""
Around this time me and Boobz were popping a mix of pills
To knock us out and we were young as a kid
Breaking into portables for a few hours sleep
When the hottie broke down, what a way we would live
Before the brakes didn't work, almost fucking collid and died

What a way that we came up and no one
Could see us takin' over rap but we owe one
To every fan that's supportin' our shit
To every fan that ever followed, let me walk you through this
What a way that we came up and no one
Could see us takin' over rap but we owe one
To every fan that's supportin' our shit
To every fan that ever followed, let me walk you through this

I started rappin' with Newt, he was reppin' up Minto
We called ourselves Jinxed Wings, we had a bit of a trio
Rates was killing the rhymes, we knew shit was gonna get big
And Jay was rapping at the start, man he had the fresh shit
I wonder if God has got some sort of a prob
I remember those bars, you inspired me a lot
Newt stayed graffin', Boobz started chillin'
Kers, Rates and Jay, we were ready for the killin'
Broke as fuck but I hustled for my high mate
Round the time we were pushing shit on Myspace
Mixtape out, digger paid for the shit
It was eighteen tracks of the craziest shit
For it's time anyway, kill the mic any day
Sippin' lean, thinkin' bout my past, pop a annyxay
Nebulizer was the first chart climber
Hit the drugs hard at that time, man that's a reminder

What a way that we came up and no one
Could see us takin' over rap but we owe one
To every fan that's supportin' our shit
To every fan that ever followed, let me walk you through this
What a way that we came up and no one
Could see us takin' over rap but we owe one
To every fan that's supportin' our shit
To every fan that ever followed, let me walk you through this

From there the highest viewed YouTube rapper in Aus
We would sit around, just Jay, Aaron and Scott
They was getting a buzz, the shit was getting like shit hot
Going on tour, not knowing we got ripped off
Then I changed my management, had another crack at it
And sold out every state and topped the charts now we back stackin' it
It happened so fast, but fuck it was ten years
I've got those fucking rhymes that can make grown men tear

What a way that we came up and no one
Could see us takin' over rap but we owe one
To every fan that's supportin' our shit
To every fan that ever followed, let me walk you through this
What a way that we came up and no one
Could see us takin' over rap but we owe one
To every fan that's supportin' our shit
To every fan that ever followed, let me walk you through this",https://genius.com/Kerser-walk-you-through-this-lyrics
Want Ya Now,Engraved In The Game,2017,"I've got a place
We can go get comfortable
'Cause I want you now, I want you now
I want you now-ow-ow-ow-ow
I've got a place
Better tell me you'll go
'Cause I want you now, I want you now
I want you now-ow-ow-ow-ow

Said she want him now, there was truth in that
But she didn't know his money was from movin' packs
She was shocked when she'd first seen him shoot a gat
But it turned her on too, she a loony, fact
Well, they was headed to a spot on the block where
If the light's off, you don't go and knock there
And the light's off but he don't give a fuck
He rock it in there because he ticked 'em up
He want his money back, she ask him what he doin'
He said ""Nuttin' baby, just let me do it""
He opens car door, she kind of sussin' out
He says ""If you hear shots, better duck down
You stay in the car, I'ma rock the lot""
He kicks down the door, he starts poppin' shots
What the fuck? She in shock like ""how?""
But her next fuckin' words were still ""I want you now""
Wow

I've got a place
We can go get comfortable
'Cause I want you now, I want you now
I want you now-ow-ow-ow-ow
I've got a place
Better tell me you'll go
'Cause I want you now, I want you now
I want you now-ow-ow-ow-ow

My mate X got his heart broke tryin' to trust a bad bitch
She set him up, got him robbed and ain't been back since
They was way different, he was more the stoner type
She the more wild, puff a pipe and go out at night
X was in love, he really loved her to bits
I tried to tell him on the sly ""you can't be trustin' the bitch""
I think he thought I was a hater, so I just left it
I told him ""man, fuck her off, you livin' desperate""
Other mates ringing like she hittin' him up
I'm sayin' ""X, what the fuck you think she doing in clubs?""
Fuck, he didn't listen though, then she set him up
Got him robbed, fought him back, he got shivved up
Seen a face in the car as they drove off
He leakin' blood on the floor and it won't stop
""I tried tellin' you brah, she a bad slut""
But, with these words, she had him all rapped up

I've got a place
We can go get comfortable
'Cause I want you now, I want you now
I want you now-ow-ow-ow-ow
I've got a place
Better tell me you'll go
'Cause I want you now, I want you now
I want you now-ow-ow-ow-ow

Me and you, in our room
We can do anything
Me and you, all alone
We can do everything
Me and you, in our room
We can do anything
Me and you, all alone
We can do anything

Gave the last words of a bitch that I knew
She'd always play Kers ""who you listenin' to?""
She had a weird way of showin' that she want me around
She play dumb, lay stoned and just roll on the ground
I see through it though, I see what you're doin' ho
You're like a bad drug, tryna get me ruined, no
I ain't fall for it but I'm feelin' bad now
They read a suicide note in her bag, found
Next to her body, what, she killin' herself?
I s'pose all the hard drugs and the pills didn't help
Fuck, she was hangin' from the roof, playin' Kerser
Was it my fault? Was it all my words
Was she a mess that just couldn't be helped?
And why want to fuck me and not nobody else?
Who knows? Don't wanna know what the note said
Then I heard, this exactly what the note read:

I've got a place
We can go get comfortable
'Cause I want you now, I want you now
I want you now-ow-ow-ow-ow
I've got a place
Better tell me you'll go
'Cause I want you now, I want you now

Watch Me Get Em,The Nebulizer,2011,"The Nebulizer

I walked in, kicked the door like ""where the fuck the safe at?""
Since I hit fifteen, one rule, make cash
And I can rap, it goes hand in hand
Before I drop an album, music banging  the man
I'm only being real, no gimmick needed
Drop it and these kids'll eat it
Got these veterans pissed off
I mean because they can't get near it
So you fear it and the jealousy will turn to hate
Shit, I've had my best mates go and turn away
People on my back, the CD needs release dates
While I've got mates in prison and they waiting on release dates
For pete's sake, nah, fuck's sake, you must hate
Put the whole scene in a body bag, suffocate
You fuckin' fake and all you rappers are wack
I blow a cone in your face and cause an asthma attack
Now, how dramatic is that? That I can actually rap
And have the backing of lads, packing gats in their dacks

I'm taking over and there's nothing you can do now
I'm on my way, I'd rather fuckin' tell her move out
Don't need radio, the streets are my connection
Any second, watch me wreck 'em, now the labels need protection
Watch me get 'em

I'm getting off my head, no time for hooks, I got a lot to say
Wait, I call every rapper out, they don't want it, ay
What a pity, in my city getting greedy with a fiddy
And a iddy biddy chitty chatty atta piggy
The new king, need a crown for my head
You panadol rappers, on my fucking allergies spread
A bit paranoid, now you see the kid with an axe
And, if I drop that shit, I've got a shiv in my dacks
But I ain't a fucking dog, you wanna swing em? Then I got you lad
But they don't want to do it 'cause they heard that Rates has got my back
How you gonna run this marathon with no shoes?
My life is kind of like my battles, yeah, cos I don't lose
You think I joking brother, next up for assassination
Rap amazing, smack your face with acid spray and catch a K
I looking through this microscope, you think it's kind of dope
What you mean? We've tried to leave that out I'll fucking tie the rope

I'm taking over and there's nothing you can do now
I'm on my way, I'd rather fuckin' tell her move out
Don't need radio, the streets are my connection
Any second, watch me wreck 'em, now the labels need protection
Watch me get 'em
I'm taking over and there's nothing you can do now
I'm on my way, I'd rather fuckin' tell her move out
Don't need radio, the streets are my connection

Way 2 Hi Up,No Rest For The Sickest,2012,"No way, I'm way too high up
Yeah more beat brother

Put it up, eyes red 'cause I smoke bud
You don't even want to ask what's in the foam cup
I'm in my zone brah, that bass bang a bitch's breast
I got the weed and it's hydro, sticky-icky yes
In a big bag, separate from the glad wrap
Tablets in the bag, dacked, I'm guaranteed to have that
Daily basis, crazy ain't it? Rep my crew lad
I start to spit, I ain't say shit and rappers move back
This is king shit, why the fuck you question that
The time has come I think you bout to learn a lesson bad
I'm on the pedestal you are the faggots on your knees
I feel invincible you other maggots stopping me

No way, I'm way too high up
Okay, let 'em hang, they ain't like us
So blazed won't say that I lied but
That's the reason why you fuckers couldn't find us

So fucking fresh when I put shit down
Sit down with a sick sound, gotta spit now
Every time I write man, this shit's insane
When I'm sticking blades to your bitch's face
They ain't never find another one like me
Fast speed then my mind bleed wonder why I like weed
Hide the fact that I'm crazy, slightly
Sorry, did I mention that I like light weed?
So smooth, fresh, clean like ""so what?""
You so useless, pipe with no rock
High you know Scott, fine, just don't stop
Hi, yes, you know what? I'm fried and so lost
But when it comes to rapping baby, Kerser be on top of it
Like a Molotov they try to burn what's at the top of it
But picture where the clock'll sit 'cause me, I'm like the opposite
I'm what's inside the bottle bitch, so light, up watch the bottle fizz

No way, I'm way too high up
Okay, let 'em hang, they ain't like us
So blazed won't say that I lied but
That's the reason why you fuckers couldn't find us

I'm picking it up with the sickest sound
In the district now what I spitting foul
Never see what I do live on the beat
'Cause I fight for the street and my mind on repeat
Got the street shit, dacked that, could've fucking grabbed that
Rat slapped pack in the bag that you stashed lad
Ripped off, yeah, you got fucked up bad
Now my nun chucks crack till your funds are slack
Outcome of the situation street life
No freezer needed, on the block, they like to heat ice
Yes I am, heaps nice, Aussie rapping's in my hand
I drown this shit like fuck you all, you think that I won't sink it man
Got a different plan, I'm way, way, way in front
I might your girl, I'm like stay, stay, stay you cunt
She had a glit, she nice, she looked at me like ""no Scott""
Within thirty seconds, Lowies gave me blowjobs

No way, I'm way too high up
Okay, let 'em hang, they ain't like us
So blazed won't say that I lied but
That's the reason why you fuckers couldn't find us

In case you were wondering why you couldn't find us
'Cause you're out there
Your Lowies are following us
She's smoking my cock like an ice pipe
Shes a bad thing
She don't even need to light the rock
Got her make up her nails
Had a shower
You other faggots to, why you following
You just watch what I do
Hold on to your Lowie
She following us",https://genius.com/Kerser-way-2-hi-up-lyrics
We Could Of,,2012,"Say I’m selling out?
Well let me see
Only thing that’s selling out is my CD
And not a sell out like I’m selling out for more
I mean sell out like it’s selling out of stores
I am pure, wasn’t made by the man
Mother fucker ask around I was made by the fans
And I just woke up with a spliff to roll
Make ‘em cry to my shit
Cause I hit the soul
And I ain't like any Aussie rapper that you heard
I come from nothing, blood and sweat till I made it work
And I’m so so proud, should I be of myself?
They used to laugh and act better now they needing my help
But I fly so high and it’s just begun
Work hard, it pays off I should have trust my mum
Now I’m in the position where I can’t be stopped
So confident with haters now I laugh them off
They are suckers, I’m the man
And they be knowing that it’s true
And if they say they don’t know
Well then you knowing that they knew
See all my fans are crazy so I guess we all the same
Cause my music’s like a drug and now it’s damaging your brain
Look into my eyes can you see the pain
See the bags under them, that’s no sleep for days
But I can’t feel alone cause the fans relate
Plus I just hit the stage and I can’t stand straight
Wait, wait, you know that I’ve got this
Rip apart my brain just to find you a top bit
Ask my boys “Are you happy with life?”
They say yes, but in the streets you gotta carry a knife
If you shake your head well get the fuck aware
You ain't been out here, you wouldn’t understand
You in your nice mansion yea you’ve lost your shit
That’s why kids around here come and rob your shit
You never gave a helping hand so what the fuck you expect
But now I got the money coming Ima take all I can get
Ima take it till I’m dead
Get my family fed
And everyone that’s near me, get them standing again
Tell me who can get you in the vibe
To feel so high you ain't even need a pipe
That’s why addicts use this when they can’t get on
It’s like a free hit here gotta pass the bong
Yea pass it round, I’m the master now
I will never ever stop, see me passin out
Then I wake back up, still all about rap
It’s on my mind all the time like I’m stuck in a trap
What the fuck is a fact
When I give you my life
Without the rap probably be another victim to ice
Why you listening right?You see the shit in my eyes
I give my fans everything
Never think to disguise
So I’m poppin codeine so fresh so clean
Skinny mother fucker still be making hoes scream
Tell me who can wait, nah not again
If I could swap weed smoke for oxygen
It’d be done, we be walking round smashed as fuck
Doing interviews on phones while I’m hackin bud
I ain't acting bruz
This is what you get
Ain't denying shit
I am off my head",https://genius.com/Kerser-we-could-of-lyrics
We Run Shit,No Rest For The Sickest,2012,"Made for the shit, sluts turn to set

Told 'em what the force, Sarm, Kerser, Nebs
Made for the shit, sluts turn to set
Told 'em what the force, Sarm, Kerser, Nebs
Made for the shit, sluts turn to set
Told 'em what the force, Sarm, Kerser, Nebs

Back to basics, straight amazing, ask me bout the game I'm playing
Dreading what I've done to locks, you thinking bout it, ain't Jamaican
Kerser been the sickest probably why I'm earning digits
And they looking at your shit like rather burn it cause your bitches
Swagger like I've never seen I'm here to hurt and burn a bitch
Your shit get no views like Hustle Hard without a Kerser vid (True)
Everybody dribble and they kidding ain't it whack son?
Leave 'em injured whinging cause they toy just like a cap gun (Get it?)
No you ain't a rapper 'cause you've been inside a booth before
I bust my arse to get here and you try and make a movement more
Meaningful than mine, but that's impossible I'm made for this
And you be on my dick, pretty much just like your lady is
If I never said it then you faggots can not call it sick
Download your shit illegally, now that's what I call rawting shit
'Cause it's shit ('cause it's shit) and I'm sick
I am what is real, and you is just pretending bitch

It's like the more hardcore they get
It's like the shitter they rap
Bruz tone it down brah, you're not that hard
Yo, learn how to rhyme

Fuck the antibiotics, just fill the van with narcotics
I'm the man with the chronic beats, they slam when I'm on it
Haters panties get knotted, they can't handle me rocking
Whack comments are dropping on the net I am watching
'Cause they know I'm is better, that's why Nebs a problem
'Cause they know if I see 'em, pick up a weapon and clock 'em
They looking threatened I rob 'em, give up your credit and wallet
Bend over bitch, and take the Hennessy bottle
Your not forgetting me gronkers, you had bad memories from it
That are so fucking bad, you go to therapy from it
N-E-B's honest, no fuck it N-E-B's on it
Watch me come and skull this fucking medicine bottle
I'm getting energy from it, and bruz I'm ready to vomit
I'm fucking hanging for Xannies and then I'm ready to pop 'em
My fucking head is just throbbing, my dick is red as a rocket
And your chick's already naked and she's ready to cop it, uh

Yeah, all these cunts are fucking fucked
They're all fucked

Welcome, you found someone in his fucking prime
Ain't nothing to fuck with like, Wu Tang back in '95
Please excuse me guys, the shit I spit is stupid fine
Too refined, call me the priest, cause I be super fly
That was my movie line, pack your shit its moving time
If that's your chick she super fine
She sucked my dick around 2:05
Shout outs, 225
ABK, the whole crew's live
I'm on that news you high
Mess with my vibe, you'll lose at night
Yeah I'm the shit, you're just poo disguised
I do a line that's super sized
You can't rap, you're spooning guys
See it's too easy, I could do this blind
We ain't the same, I'm a ten, you're a junior nine
When I spit I'm schooling guys, it's a party schoolies time
When you spit I snooze all night
Mismatch if you choose to fight
Quit dancing your tutu's tight
You're a fake, not a new I
You just can't do this right
We'd fuck, you lose at life

It's Sarm, Kerser and Nebs
We run this shit you just shit in your bed
Sick in the head, I'm sick of your head
If you's were a bitch I'd spit on your set
Fuck the whole scene it's piss in a set
Fuck your whole team it's a bitch in a dress
I'm sick and depressed that I spit with the best
'Cause they're shit and they think that they're equally fresh

This is what they calling me, you rapping but its awkwardly
Exactly what, I was doing back around 04 or 3
So don't you try to step, yo I ain't say I'm a vet
'Cause most these veterans are faggot I'm a step ahead of them
Let 'em get at them, guarantee I'll take the head of them
Breaking both their legs and then, asking if they get it in
K-E-R-S, I put em in the ER
Nah you couldn't do it, don't you try it, its for me brah

Mr. N-E-B, the motherfucker come and crack your lips
It's like you don't have a dick, and your raps are whack as shit
Think your fucking Rambo and your clips, fucking acting bitch
Remind me of a compact disc, pl-pl-pl-plastic shit
You are fucking hopeless as, obviously smoking shabs
And you're fucking broke as, smoking blokes for cash
Mr. Big Gun you think are the king son
But all you are to me is a busted red ring bum

Yes, did you not hear what I said before?
Like binge thinkers, motherfucker I just rep the raw
Get out my booth, you can't rap, you just press record
Your vids suck, give it up bruz, less is more
See what your stressing for, I ain't here to lecture y'all
Someone I'm electrical, not top 10 I'm the best of all
Fuck you and your festival, no one here's impressed at all
Got a verse in Kerser's album, that equals sex for sure

It's Sarm, Kerser and Nebs
We run this shit you just shit in your bed
Sick in the head, I'm sick of your head
If you's were a bitch I'd spit on your set
Fuck the whole scene it's piss
Fuck your whole team it's a bitch in a dress
I'm sick and depressed that I spit with the best
'Cause they're shit and they think that they're equally fresh
It's Sarm, Kerser and Nebs
We run this shit, you just shit in the bed
We run this shit, you just shit in the bed
Run-run this shit, you just shit in the bed
We run this shit, you just shit in the bed
Run-run this shit, you just shit in the bed
We run this shit, you just shit in the bed
Run-run this shit, you just shit in the bed",https://genius.com/Kerser-we-run-shit-lyrics
We the Bad Guys,Tradition,2016,"You know the name will be back yea it's the show starters
We flow smarter and go harder than most artists
A points proven in the records we drop
They say they're gonna take us over I say they're definitely not
Because we put it in our time and our ref is spilling our mind
On a record why do they try for a second?
I am the type that'll wreck em dissect them
And infest their lives with the test of my weapons fire
It some words infect your neck and spine with a sentence of wild
Made our own styles and never will we copy shit
They think it's gonna work so then they try and copy this
We always setting it out and sometimes you gotta speak
We ain't some politicians promises I wanna keep
Got our feet on solid ground and mobbing around us
So the vultures and they're sobbing and frowning
One will be founded but no working hard and we grinding
I gotta cypher it's violent it's nothing to have a rapper hiding in silence you know?

Hold on here we come we the bad guys
That's what they label us but we be thinking how why?
It's our ride they just jumping aboard
Let two off in the air and let one off in the floor
That was a warning call and that's to all of y'all
We hit heights so we high we can't fall we sure
The top spot is ours you get used to it
Brothers running this shit so come try move the clip

That's right the blood brothers of rap
Start with nothin' make it flip how you fucking with that?
From the shows to the pot clouds we be droppin' hot sounds
I've seen Ratesy swing on most these rappers they got stomped out
We soldier on and on pushing past these hater faggots
They wouldn't know what to do when fucking danger happens
Crazy masses that's the shit that we appeal too
If that's the case then most of them must all be real too
On Untold I heard a letter to me
I can't address it it's too strong it got the better of me
Just know the shit hit me hard with every bar that you wrote
It couldn't get any realer only half of them know
All the shit that we fought through in district Aus move
Breaking all these barriers and never get awards true
You know we laugh at them try to copy us now
I think we told them man they gotta sit the fuck down

Hold on here we come we the bad guys
That's what they label us but we be thinking how why?
It's our ride they just jumping aboard
Let two off in the air and let one off in the floor
That was a warning call and that's to all of y'all
We hit heights so we high we can't fall we sure
The top spot is ours you get used to it
Brothers running this shit so come try move the clip

I couldn't care for them if they were sinking in a rut
I'd offer out a hand to punch them I ain't gonna pick them up
See we never give a fuck we don't care if we're blacklisted
Fuck their wack writtens me and Kerser man we're that gifted
You fucking pussies fucking lucky I don't bash kittens
ABK Records for the record yeah you have to listen
Said it before Debbie get the pen when I talk
Now I'll pass you back to Kers to put your head through the door
Aye

Head through the door I'll leave them dead on the floor
ABK Records cunts they ain't ready for more
Pissing people off with every song that we drop
And it makes it even worse that we're not gonna stop
Certified with a street sound they don't want a beat down
Every album dropped you're getting swept off your feet now
We the bad guys shit we can handle that
Kers with Rates one injure and dismantle rap

Hold on here we come we the bad guys
That's what they label us but we be thinking how why?
It's our ride they just jumping aboard
Let two off in the air and let one off in the floor
That was a warning call and that's to all of y'all
We hit heights so we high we can't fall we sure

I laugh about ‘em popping pills when it’s bed time
You like the album? If it’s no then I hate you
Me and Jay were writing raps back in grade school
Or high school, whatever tickles you cunt
Grab a bit of ketamine, then I’ll mix it with bud
Then I’ll pack you a cone, then I’m watching you cough
You passing out on the spot, I grab your wallet you gronk

Let me hit my drink tonight
(Jay, you've said it. Wait, you haven't) Let me finish alright
So, as I was saying I’ll be drinking all night
Slurrin’ every single word like Kerser purp and the sprite
You find me rocking up to shows, seven beers in my hand
After shows when it closes there’ll be beers in my hand
Damn, passing out in bed with beers in my hand
Then I’ll be waking up the next day, start drinking again
Yeah, and in the midst of that, I try an' get a written track
(But what about your album Jay?) It’s nearly fucking finished lad
Yeah, sure it’s taking time but when it’s out my name will climb
Once that I’m behind the mic you’ll find that I’ll be rated right
I came to rhyme, you can hate or like but I won’t fade tonight
The name is Jay, I won’t go away like junkies craving ice
It’s ABK alright, you know that I’m the latest hype
Of course I’m fucking crazy man, I used to live with Rates alright

Ayy Jay, I thinkin’ fuck a third verse
Let me spit it then.
 Nah, they want to hear the Kers verse
Okay you first, you feel better? You done?
We know Kerser is the sickest, yeah we’ve heard it you cunt
Okay you’ve heard it enough? Well let me talk about you
""Let me hit my spliff tonight,” the only words that you use
Yeah Kerser it’s true, I’m fucking lazy alright?
And if I could I probably would just sleep all day and all night
Let me switch it up here, I got something to say
And wait, (
what?
) Fuck shit, I got nothing to say
Well fuck it bro, have a Xanny again
Put ""Bad Habits"" on repeat and start banging your head
Fucking oath, sure I said it, it’s right there with the pen
Nah it doesn’t matter either he’ll forget it again
See we really hate each other, we pretend to be friends
And once your first album drops, cunt it's never again

Scared of confrontation, so they offer me a proposition

You cop an axe to face, splitting right between your eyes
You cop a massive taste, shitting on the scene, I'm high
Got me spinning till I'm living how I'm supposed to
I be winning if I'm spinning, living local
Me, the spitter that will back it up and bring you all
Leaving bloody sword wars, no neck, on all fours

Can't even tell, am I talking talking out loud?
You mix that mushroom with that eccy
Mix that rum soon with that Pepsi
Mix that, uh, you come, you met me
Bitch had fuck, you tried to impress me
But I walk to the V.I.P
Free grog roped off feeling B.I.G
Nebs' beats worth more then your whole life
And, with my voice, they double in price
From poor to rich, I’m raw as shit
One flick of the finger and my balls get licked
Then it's party time, come and party right
Lines so bigger than Charlie mind
Big fat lines like the ones I write
This that rhyme that will fuck em, why?!

All night long, tell em all night long
I'ma get so fucked, you don’t know what on
I'ma stand for this, this the anthem bitch
Your bitch over there, look who she's dance-dance-dancing with

Am I there? Are you there? Who that?
Mushrooms, a few lad
Eccys new batch
Sick cunt, true fact
I live the way you wish for
That's probably why you diss or
No fan base, man you're piss poor
My fans took over this shore

Still top the charts, the freshest
Come on now say this saint's real

Me on these beats create it

Some dumb fuck heard and they hand me a lift

With the ecstasy, got me bopping cuz
Now I rack that line and I smack that spine
'Til that slut can’t walk, shit that's fucked I’m
Leaving this place I ain't needing a date
In court no way so I’m leaving okay
They're like ""Don’t leave Kers man, we need you here""
I think I need to calm down with a weed and beer

Not okay, talk in slang like okecay

Back up on my shit
Bitch I never fucking left
Now they say I'm up for death
Aim for head or hit the chest
Now listen if they find me
Dead i guarantee they do clone
See me rest in peace
With the sickest on my tombstone
(Jay dee)
I'm also killing shit these days
When it comes to rap
I'm loving that so many
People seem to pump my tracks
I'm travelling through oz
Bringing out the truest sound
It's true without a doubt
To keep on at it with that music proud
(Kerser)
Cruise around C-town
I got the window down
I'm making sure they see me
So they know me I got it figured out
We rock a show now your girl got her pants wet
She in the front hands up screaming DEADSET!
(Jay dee)
You never met no other rappers doing shit like us
I'm loving that I got the chance to spit and rip this up
Spitin' bout some fricken cunts who love to light the billy's up
I'm finding crap to write new rap while livin' chillin' sitting drunk
(Kerser)
Sickest cunt like I need to fucking say it more
Said it every song 'til they cry what? ain't it raw?
(Jay dee)
This is a major flaw other rappers hating more
Acting crazy why the hating just cuz I said rape a whore
(Kerser)
Fuck em all cuz Kerser dropping more stuff
Then them all put together I would play it but you bore us
(Jay dee)
You fucking oath they do
People fucking know it's true
We tour 'round the country
Go on tell us about the shows use do?
(Kerser)
If only you can pack out shows
I guess you'd own it too
I'm racking off the sub
Before I hit the stage you know me dude
(Jay dee)
You'd rather fuck the haters yeah we do it for our fan
And mates we land in states to burn the place
With 225 and chant the name
(Kerser)
I got my seat back
Rolling through the gold coast
Jaydee riding shotgun keep him busy as he rolls notes
(Jay dee)
I sit and light a smoke
Turn and then I find a note
Grab the pipe light it up
I can't believe you're driving bro
(Kerser)
Fuck I don't know
I'm just seeing what the night brings
A couple lines a couple joints
A few more other nice things
I might swim back to Sydney
'Til the tides in
Wait I'm slipping off the track
Just bring them fucking lines here
(Jay dee)
UF never ever found a day where we begin to fade
We stayed around
Pen and pages down till we reach our fate
If we say we told you so
It's because we told you so
Don't you fuckin' act like we did not
When I just told you so
(Kerser)
You older blokes pissed off
Cos I accomplished more
You only seen with me if
You come around to fucking mop my floor
(Jay dee)
So stop the talk you know we made it
Yes we know you fuckin' hate it
(Kerser)
Let me cut you off right there
And tell these cunts that I'm the GREATEST!

And I'm the messiest and report the heavy shit
But every bit of effort spent of land me standing
Wrecking this

Making dough so this rappin'
Be a day job we the boss of rappin'
I'm reporting that you laid off

Yeah sure you may of lost
A battle cuz we're better shit

Cuz we restaurants your fast food
We're hennessy your harsh goon
You go and spit your shit til you choke
And then you march blue
(Kerser)
You cunts are just prostey clowns
Like hanging up in bathrooms
My pen to paper magic illustrated
Like a cartoon
(Jay dee)
We shinning like a star dude
Funny cuz I'm looking down
My energy will hit the ground
Then bounce right up and hook your mouth

I couldn't drown with a block on my foot
I'm that warm good feeling like a cock in a moot?
Wait.....

Jaydee the upper commer staying true
This ain't a phase disc
My names due to now get recognized
Just call that paid jews
The mic and me belong never will just tear apart
Same goes with my crew that's why I got it branded on my arm
Never meant not any harm to anything or anyone
All I do is pour the truth and make sure that I air my heart
(Kerser)
We talking over and you wishing you could
Its Kers one the one cunt that makes skinny look good
So when you see me in your town drunk come and give a pound up
They try block the noise
You enjoying that you found us

I'm always entertaining as we keep it moving along
Yeah

What Ya Day Brings Part 2.,Lifestyle,2019,"Jay-Dee, what's happenin'?
Fuck all, mate
Ah, that was like it was planned
You're never doin' nothin', are you?
I'm lucky to get you in the studio
Why wouldn't I bro?
We gotta do this song over
Yeah, I'm-
I'm thinkin' of keepin' it virtually the same
I'll change a few lyrics
I just can't be fucked up
Alright, alright, that's easy
Their movement's my movement, look
Yo, go

Back up on my shit, bitch, you wish I fuckin' left
I been busy dumpin' meds with this silly cunt instead
So many rappers bummy, man, I told you that they all clone
They 'bout to get they rappin' name tatted on they jawbone
I'm also hatin' shit these days when it comes to rap
With every cunt DMin' me like, ""Where the fuck you at?""
I'm chillin' out at home, can't be fucked if I can rap
We finished everything they tryin' to, they can't be touchin' that
Cruisin' 'round C-Town, windows tinted now
'Cause if they see the car they probably want a picture, wow
Still the reason why your bitches got her pants soaked
I made her O 'most straight to death and didn't use my hands, though
You never met no other rapper doin' shit like him
You hear in every fuckin' song that he's as sick as shit
Like fuck, you 'ready know, Kers, you know you still the best
But how much do you have when you still have to go and steal the rest?
Steal the stash like I'd really fuckin' take it all
Why they not cryin' 'bout it? What, ain't' it yours?
This is a major flaw, the fact that we're still major score
Had the punchline there but now you cannot place the break no more
Fuck 'em all, 'cause I'ma drop my walnuts
On the bitch's forehead just 'cause you're a fuckin' whore slut
Come on, Kerser, bruv, lemme get my verse here, bruv
You interrupted last time and just everybody heard you, bruv
If only you could cut me off then you would fuckin' throw it to us
I done that every venue that you went to, man, you know I do
Yeah, I know it's true, as long as I get paid, though
And paranoia doesn't come and fuck me on the way home
Fuck it, yo, we got Joe, we don't need to have a go
And if it needs to happen, I'll get ready with the stabbin', bro
As long as we're all in, I'm down for a bowl of shit
And even if I'm fuckin' seein' double, I'll be crawlin' in
I'm cruisin' 'round with twenty bags of fuckin' Panadol
I'm tellin' all these donkeys, ""Shoot it up, I swear it's Tramadol""
Motherfuckers askin' me, I tell 'em what my day brings
I slap a bitch, I really gotta think before I say things
My day brings the same as every other fuckin' day brings
Usually a sling before the Tramadol my mate gives
Wait a second, am I that fuckin' junkie that you're talkin' 'bout?
Before I thought the Tramadol was shit and sorta watered down
Come on, Jay, man, you're a clown, can't believe you didn't know
This my album, how come you ain't really diss me, bro?
We the type, you were dissin' me about the Xanny tabs
Your mind is in confusion like the same way that a tranny has
Why you dissin' bitches that are pullin' out their cocks and all?
It's kinda weird you're mentionin' a bitch who's got a cock and balls
Oh shit, now I'll be told that I got a phobia
But don't be blamin' me, go blame the people that be clonin' us
Clonin' us, shout out to Illuminati, yeah
I signed up, but I'm not for your stupid parties, bro
I'm safe from what I can tell, my adreneline peak
Then cunts are cryin' in my ear like when a feminist speaks, please
UF never, ever found a day when we'll begin to fade
It's kinda hard to leave when you can make it and you see the pay
So if I wanna quit, it's because I'm probably rich
I could leave 'em broke like I'm a stupid fucking bummy bitch
Random line, but, bro, I fuckin' got an itch
You're a stupid cunt, you probably know where every brothel is
Shut the fuck up before this song gets the cut
I'm fuckin' tellin' you that I'd never, ever pay a slut
Okay, okay, I think someone's triggered here
Have you had your Valium? Yo, quick, someone bring it here
Shut up, bro, you know our movement is strong
Six Gs down the track and we're still movin' along
Yeah

We so high, we so high, above them
We won't die, we won't die, it's nothin'
We won't try to tell you what your day brings
We still the voice for anybody feelin' caged in
We so high, we so high, above them
We won't die, we won't die, it's nothin'
We won't try to tell you what your day brings

Yeah bro, it's just that, um
We done that hook on the last ""What Ya Day Brings""
That's a mad hook, bro
Yeah, but, like, you like to change it each-
Did you not like the hook?
No, I liked it, but it, it's the same, though
I don't get what the problem is
Oh, fuck it, it's on my album anyway
Album?
Yeah
My album's comin' out first
Fuck you, fuck it, it's my album 'cause I said it is

Give you details maybe on a later date
In five years i'm signing rappers up to ABK
I know the secret, i'm a cocky prick
Drop my second album fucking oath it got me rich
I'll make you known, I'll make you a star
But in the meantime this is mine watch me aim for the stars
I'll be paid till the day that I die
Quality with quantity, so i'm making it mine
I got so much power, style so sour
Take my jewelry off before a shower, take a hour
Plus i'm kinda paranoid so the boys that I roll with
Will carry on with beef and feed you up the fucking whole dish
I'm only ever hated when its on the internet
I see 'em up in person and they shake my hand and give respect
That's then way of the game
Some would say it was lame, I don't blame them not me
I was created to be the fucking greatest I mean
If they hatin' on me they gonna hate what they see
If they wait for a year but they probably won't do that
Execution in a noose to any hater, true fact
That means you actually dead
Kinda scary knowin' I could put a stack on ya head bitch
And you hate me for that
No matter what mutha fucka gotta rate me for rap
No taking it back, rhyme make me a stack
I'm sayin' you whack, try hate me for that
Still I roll through and I'm so smooth
Watch me get em, thought I told these cunts I don't loose
Slow it down for a dumb fuck simple
Cheeky smile and ya slut loves dimples
You know my name if it hasn't been saved
Its kinda easy mutha fucka read the tatt on my face
I'm so confident, rappin' i'm on top of it
My CD ya coppin' it, you see me you stopin' there
You take a big breath, you're overwhelmed now
Rappin' is a jail and you sittin' in my cell now
Life on the line when i'm writing a rhyme
While i'm shining so bright and my timin' is nice
This is what I do, nah its not for you
I'll leave ya toe tagged if we battle, wanna loose?
Silly question wasn't it? You name ya top five
I'm mad cause i'm not in it
That's a joke think I really fuckin' care brah
I'm at the top now you know its true and you like yeah nah
Yeah hah, I fuckin' know i'm too fresh
I'll stay above ya head like you frozen in a suplex
So take a flick, witness the sickness
I met ya bitch once and she's givin' up her digits
I'll leave it at that
I could hit the fuckin' charts if I breath on a track, cunt
All ya needin' is the Kers when you roll through
I told em all before, they tried so hard ignore who?
Kerser, save that name till I nex
t
 up
Takin' over didn't think they wanna step up
All you needin' is the Kers when you roll through
I told em all before, they tried so hard ignore who?
Kerser, save the name till I next up

Who Are You?,,2016,"Makin moves every week, see I’m to smart
Hi I’m kers, now who the fuck are you brah?

Till you *bap pap pap* imma run this shit
If I get hit I pull it out and I crunch that shit
You think I came this far to fuckin have a regret?
I hit the jackpot and I ain’t been happier yet
No swag like kers tell ‘em get they own
I could make a banger out of fuckin metronome
I could get a bitch keen if she look in my eye
I could have her legs up with her foot in the sky
There ain’t none like me, self-made for real
ABK Records who you think made the deal?
I’m made of steel, these rappers ain’t shit
And tell Tracy Grimshaw to have another fit
Never gave a fuck it’s the way of the Kers
If websites ring tell ‘em pay me up first
Smoking on a big blunt
Still the same sick cunt
5 cars in a row, who was talking shit brah?
No reply imma focus on my money man
Which hurts you so we kinda got the upper hand
Entourage roll deep you talking one now
We can come to your town and get you run out
My fan base know the go when I do this
Fuck it imma rock a watch on two wrists
To fresh for the scene I’m a straight kill
Let me take a second I’m about to pop my eighth pill

Never fall imma stand in the same spot
Blame kers, are they ever gonna blame Scott?
In a room, when it moves, yeah my head spins
Aussie hip-hop I gotta be the best thing
Know the name, know the crew, know that we are
Fuckin famous, know the kers with the er
Makin moves every week, see I’m to smart
Hi I’m kers, now who the fuck are you brah?

Proved I’m the thing, proved I’m the king
She wet enough no lube when I’m moving it in
Fuck what they say, this is Scott’s commercial
It’s kers, of course it’s fuckin controversial
Stomp a circle, of gronky nerd fools
If they ever ask, if I stopped the purple
One thing for sure though, no one got the raw flow
Flavour and the attitude that Kerser has you all know
I’m great, something Ausies ain’t seen before
Next generation, man I think I teached em all
Give props when they due, can’t deny that
You can run in but you’ll get lost up in my house
Kers one to strong when the bar drop
Why they hate and we laughing, like fuck off
They scared; they won’t say it to our face though
If I cut your neck, I wanna watch your face go
But I’m still ridin round with the crew ya
Update lookin great with the truth brah
Hit my jeweler spend another fat stack
Every time I walk in he’s like, “shit you’re back lad”
Drop heat every song that I drop brah
Live your canned in your fridge that’s a foster
Keep up kers killin them all
I can’t get through a verse without a pill in it ahhh

Never fall imma stand in the same spot
Blame kers, are the ever gonna blame Scott?
In a room, when it moves, yeah my head spins
Aussie hip-hop I gotta be the best thing
Know the name, know the crew, know that we are
Fuckin famous, know the kers with the er
Makin moves every week, see I’m to smart
Hi I’m kers, now who the fuck are you brah?

I’m the voice for the people that they ignore
Only difference is, I’m rapping with a big sword
Rappers soft man, what the game coming too?
Lucky I’m here to save it, who the fuck are you?
Rappers getting older I’m a youngin to them
Young cunt getting money, well fuck it, I am
Took a bitch by her hair, put her face in the toilet
Hit flush twice and I move and avoid it
Cruising a joint lit, waiting at the airport
Hitting your city, why the fuck you think we there for?
People hit me up, “make a radio song”
I can’t, cause I never got the radio on
I remain on top while the industry block
And you can’t top me, and you suck industry cock
You’s are lame, play the game by the rules type cunts
I’m like fuck em all, I don’t got no rules tough luck
I’m a beast bounce back on tracks I kill
And they hate me cause I give the facts for real
You should’ve fuckin noticed when I built it all up
I could have a year off and fuckin still have a buzz
Number 1 when I drop, every year till I stop
If you hearing from Scott, but I’m cheering, I’m not
Gonna play games, “king kers waddup up”?
Competition lay down and they never got up, we up

Never fall imma stand in the same spot
Blame kers, are the ever gonna blame Scott?
In a room, when it moves, yeah my head spins

Who You Judging?,No Rest For The Sickest,2012,"They said it's all good, they told me relax
They found my medicine, I'd only taken three packs
Here he goes again he's on his fucking dribble and
He's always whinging ain't he cocky, thought that he was killing em
You're looking thin Scott, they tell me that's drugs
I think they're right 'cause I'm eating like a fat cunt
It spins me out, I'm the one that they look up to
I'm happy one minute then the next I'm thinking fuck you
Ain't gotta trust you, you gotta trust me
Triple pop what I call it when I dump three
Ain't a flow better, suicide with no letter
Took the scene over, mama told me I'm a go-getter
And I won't let her know my dark side
Think she knew it when she caught me in the park high
Such a young fool, break the law with one rule
Never dob my family, I didn't learn that shit in school

What I'm meant to do? Where the right way?
Why I'm high and my mind never skyscrape?
Who you judging? Oh, it's me now?
No A grades, cause I'm living in the C-town

I need a lift up, no need to slip up
I fuck a beat and flip it over, get my dick sucked
They call me sick cunt, 'cause I told em to
I'm so real motherfucker, if you only knew
When they read it, tell the truth ,I kind of dropped nuts
They had the phone records, still denied the shit like ""not us""
In custody, my boy be facing five years
He had the Xannies dacked and we popped them just to hide tears
I haven't seen him since I'm dying to visit
I'm on the road so much, it's hard for me for finding a minute
I swear when I get the time, I'll explain it all right?
But, for now, spread your word while I'm stealing a rhyme, and I
Don't know where to go, I finished with the flow
Hope they know that I've shown my heart from the yo
At the start of the track, I put part of it back
So they keep coming back, to my arteries

What I'm meant to do? Where the right way?
Why I'm high and my mind never skyscrape?
Who you judging? Oh, it's me now?
No A grades, cause I'm living in the C-town

As a teen even then no sober type
You're fucking tripping, thinking that this happened overnight
I seen my mum cry when her best friend died
I ignored it just went out so I could get high!
These are things that fucking eat me inside
I heard my brother stabbing walls I tried to peep in but I
Had a lift out the front more important at the time
And never have I spoke about it, I just pour it out with rhyme
By the way, the knife jammed and he sliced his fucking hand man
Now we hit the stage and almost cry when hearing fans chant
It's fucking crazy, so am I but I just block it out
They tell me talk about it tell me is that gonna stop it now?
I got fans but there were times when no one heard me rhyme
I make the sign of Christ and pray to god that I reach thirty five
Got a dirty mind 'cause I'm from the dirty side
Of society that they don't wanna see or recognise
I make em fucking listen, ain't gotta trust the system
Ain't gotta get permission just to see a friend or visit
If I am wrong then I will blame this fucking scummy town
Now I'm selling out 'cause I am climbing out the underground

What I'm meant to do? Where the right way?
Why I'm high and my mind never skyscrape?
Who you judging? Oh, it's me now?
No A grades, cause I'm living in the C-town
What I'm meant to do? Where the right way?
Why I'm high and my mind never skyscrape?
Who you judging? Oh, it's me now?
No A grades, cause I'm living in the C-town",https://genius.com/Kerser-who-you-judging-lyrics
Why They Angry,,2013,"I use to play 2Pac when I blazed up weed
Shit changed that year when I laced a beat
I'm that south west kid, Just the same as the others
I think that's why the relate cos I came from the slums
Now maybe man I don't know I'm just doing what I love cus
Rappers that like bitch stab your back when you get funds up
Strap the Nike's up
Strap the Nike's up
At school I stayed stoned
Trying to keep my eyelids wide and up
Now I'm on stage and can not get the fucking shut
Use to ride my bike to the dealers so they hit me up

Why You?,Roll the Dice,2020,"Why you brag so much? Were you in a coma?
Why you talk about drugs? Why you not sober?
Why you get your Kers back? Why you taste your first batch?
Why'd you used to look chat? How'd you never look back?
Why you beef with rappers back in day? Was it branded?
Why you not goin' ten for ten? We need answers
Why you not speak to NEBS? Why you leave Obese too?
Why you made it but you still keep it near the streets? You
Never thought about your daughter's thoughts and the future
Why'd you get hooked on Xan's? Why you buyin' new cars?
Where the rest of ABK? Who you still rockin' with?
Why you got a million songs that you ain't even droppin' yet?
Why you never take your shit overseas to show them Kers?
Why you never post online? We're missin' out on photos Kers?
How'd you keep the same girl? Why'd you near break her heart?
Why you never let us get the features we forever ask?
Why you hate the scene, bro? Why you smack a rapper up?
Why you always gotta feel the weight? What's it matter brah?
Why you not sign rappers? Why you in your feelings for?
What happened to your promos man? You know you gotta feed us more
We was at your first show, watched it from the bottom bro
It's only real to hit you with the questions that we wanna know
So many lies, we just want you because
And your ticket price is jumping, you forgot about the poor

First off, look, I brag 'cause I have to
You just said it yourself, what, I used to look chat, true
Well that changed now, braggin' is a prob' now
I'm still goin' ten, but I'm not racin' the clock
How am I meant to break it all down bein' sober?
You hit me with the questions, I'm just tryna get the closure
I know that in life, people go different directions
So don't bring up a question, ain't got fuckin' beat selections
Obese closed when they heard that I was leavin'
I'll never diss their legacy but fuck I kept 'em breathin'
My music and my daughter separated if I can
But I cannot shower somethin' that can burn through with a stare
You bringin' up the Xans, man I bring up how I got off 'em
That's ticked off a problem that I never should've gotten in
ABK still my brothers till my dyin' day
Some have left the crew but that's I story for behind the A
I ain't even gotta speak on what I don't got to
And Sero should be out by the time this shit has dropped too
I could've gone overseas seven years ago
Past charges have marked my name, I couldn't leave you bro
I ain't hate the scene, I'd rather never get involved in it
I've been rappin' for too long to watch 'em fit a mold for it
Comas slowed right down, that was on my ground work
All part of the plan, how you even think you found Kers?
Same shit, no shit, that's my ride or die
Ask her if I brang her life a brighter side
So many questions but you never gave props
It's like they almost forgot the way I got to the top
You just focus on the negative and then bring up the sedative
And then forget the fact that in this country, Kers the best at this
Yeah, they rack on but they ain't really sayin' nothin'
I've been leavin' messages like artists when they paintin' somethin'
I appreciate the questions that you got, truth
And when you askin' next time I prefer we do swap shoes",https://genius.com/Kerser-why-you-lyrics
Write Me Off,Lifestyle,2019,"I don't wanna seem like another cunt braggin’
But I could still try it if I rap in pig Latin
Icka-say, itta-spay that they try an' imitate
Ifty-fay grams of the weed in my immer-Bay
I could do this when I'm sleep talkin’
When I walk in to the booth snorin', recordin'
Straight out the gate I moved straight out the gutter
History lesson, fucker, that was way back at the start up
The shit I created in the matrix
Eight tricks with a facelift, basic, fake tits
Everyday shit when your state is the greatest
The haters complain but they ain't on the same list
On my waist is- best to not say shit
This is just a verse I found when I used to take bricks
Swear to God, they ain't seen this shit before
You ain't never heard a rapper there with two to score
Cold shiver again, I'm feelin' dizzy again
I’m hittin’ dizzy again 'cause I can’t listen to them
Long convos, my mind's gone bongos
I'm high from the bongs, bro, I'm tryin’ and God knows
Keep pushin', keep my bank on the uprise
I'm so fuckin' high, you can tell by my fucked eyes
Number one, what the fuck, that ain't nothin' new
Eight areas, see if them cunts told the fuckin' truth

Watched 'em all, I watched 'em all write me off
I been tryna get a balance to this life I got
But it's difficult, tellin' 'em to level up
Eight albums and I still haven't said enough
Fans hangin' for the album and they're buyin' them
Some were trippin' out, thinkin' I was fadin'
Out in pictures, you're all kiddin', I'm engraved, bruv
They supposed to want my spot, this'll place far

I don't wanna seem like another cunt rappin'
All about the action when in fact they are actin'
I'll never be a has-been, I'll always be the relevant
Even if I stop right now my shit would still be sellin' big
I had a flashback but didn't post a throwback
I get asked what I would change if I could go back
I'd just ride the wave and ignore a lot of shit
And remember if I strived I could cause a diff'
Here we go, I'm on my shit, my flow is like an oxy drip
I'm tryna tell you not to give a fuck about the opposites
Or enemies or fake friends, what you call these days
I'm just sittin' here high in a sort of daze
Tryna set my brain back into reality
In fact I am this actually seein' if I battle these
Thoughts in my head, I'm tryna stay focused
Forgive me if I slip off-track and thank you if you noticed
It gets kinda strange 'cause the older I get
I see the game for what it is and I sorta regret
Givin' so much to this but you know what it is?
It's the fact that they've never seen one doper than this
And you know I'm the shit, I don't wanna let 'em live
I don't wanna let 'em take another breath in front of this
Yeah, ABK, we the who of who
We the whole reason that they do what they do, too

Watched 'em all, I watched 'em all write me off
I been tryna get a balance to this life I got
But it's difficult, tellin' 'em to level up
Eight albums and I still haven't said enough

See I'm just having fun but the cash will come
When I quit being lazy, get it happening
Man the LP's coming but we took our time
Got the recipe, flavour and we cooked it right
Now you wittiness sickness mixed with fitness
When it comes to rap, if you break it, I'll fix it
Ballistic, sadistic, check the statistics
I could say kill yourself, your kids would have the wrist slit
Fuck that, what I need you to do
Light the base with the weed, when you breath it in ""ooh""
Best feeling like the feeling that my rap gives
When I have kids, they'll be running the rap biz
Twenty years from now, your kids knowing the name
My kids will have your kids going insane

And if you don't know you better ask someone
You know me
Put the drugs in the saddy and you pass me some

On stage, got a beer for a mic
Crowd be yelling out ""we ain't hearing you right""
Whoops my bad, yep that be my bag
I get high lad, high like times that
Buy five times nine, buy five times nine
Now you seeing what be going through my mind
Write rhymes, my sky dive at night time
Jumping of a Jetstar told you that a fly guys
High ride at the same time nice guy
What they call me if I'm sniffing on a white line
Drive by with a fly by might try
Put the fly by card in the wifi
Internet laptop what to say next
Did it make sense? Don't care 'cause I'm great yes
They stress cause they struggling to catch me
Indian cabbies got my pumping in the taxis

Kay cuz we can blame drugs, ayy bruz
Got a dollar for a rapper with a taped up
Nokia but I'm hoping it works
Get a phone call: ""Hello, is this kers""
I can't hear now I gotta hang up
Smoking on my profit so I can't even slang drugs
Shit's fucked up still see a happy side
People see my music and they knowing that the raps alive
It's alive and you knowing that it's all good
I shut you out, something like a door would
Your hood full of mansions and rich cunts
My hood full of cancer and sick drugs
Sick sluts in a sick truck shit bruh
Should I even mention that they ganged her got her wrists cuffed
Hick ups but I still got a sick pass
Gotta call it a quits 'cause I'm bout to have a fit, fuck

Pants full of pills, I’mma share 'em with my brother man
You hold my stack it hurts your back, and can’t fit in a rubber band
You got a problem? Well I got a solution
Rappers ending up dead, they say I’m pollutin'
I’m the man of this shit if you didn't know
And you can check all the stats on the videos
Or you can check from the ARIA charts
Or you can check from the paper, look remarkable star
Plus I got your bitch and she calling the phone

Should we came home, we were leanin' back
He said your raps kill em all, I’l leave em flat
I like the need for that, cause they pussies bro
We the A-B-K, we the best of both
Triple J compared us to the Aussie death row
Like what the fuck are they tryna say
Full blacklisted, still find our way
And the view from the top looks kinda grey
Coulda signed fifty deals like last Tuesday
Kerser one, I’m makin' those moves mate
Told em at the start this is what I’ll do
Now they all on my back, what the fucks it to you?

I mix my lean with listerine
I mix my weed with bits of ease
And wonder why I can't sleep, mysteries
Let me tell you about the Kers, I’ve been in it for a minute
Funny how these new comers are coming to their finish
And it’s kinda got me thinking
Is it worth it if I mix in with these artists and I fit in?
Lad it’s Kerser, are you kidding?
It’s the Kers, I’m too real for that
At the ARIAs, dack with some pills and rack
If my crew came too then who brang who
Ah you got your fuckin' chain snatched
Boo fuckin' hoo
I can't be touched, I'm the Kers with this
I’m the hook to your chin from the words I writ
I’ma drift away, it's the Kerser right
