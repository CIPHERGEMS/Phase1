He acting too tough when he type through them texts
Push up with the scope put it right through his neck
(C4)
Your niggas 3 stooges you thought we was clueless
He thought someone was pussy we showed him we ruthless
The Glock got a clock with a stick and a ruler
If I spot an op I’ma pop his medulla
They say that I’m crazy they say I’m retarded
You know I’m that nigga that shot up the party
Can’t trust these bitches they always say sorry

What lil nigga, pull up on me get shot lil nigga
I’m with them goons on the block lil nigga
Keepin’ them grams in my sock lil nigga
I’m on the block, I’m with your hoe

Can’t trust em really these niggas be snitches
Look Like the pacific lil nigga I’m dripping
Call me a hood rat I need some chicken
Shoot like Ray Allen I’m playing the game

First day out, go run that shit back
You want my old shit, go play that shit back
Yeroc that nigga you know I’ma snap

Hey lil nigga get your racks up

Got a white bitch she allergic to gluten
Smoking on turtle that teenage mutant
I know that my niggas they want me to win
Just pray up to God and hope I don’t sin
I like having hoes with a wife that’s a blend
I fuck on that bitch and I fuck on her friends
I got a white bitch I pay for her tans
She open her legs up like it’s a can
I shoot my shot and I feel like the man
I smoked me a blunt I don’t fuck with them xans
They calling me tiger I stay with the woods
I need me a bad bitch that’d be good
You ain’t never struggle you ain’t from the hood
You from the town where everything good
Boy you ain’t gangster you know you a hoe
Can’t take you serious we know you a joke
How you a gangbanger got no ops

These niggas just pray that I flop
These strippers be throwin that ass
I know that my main bitch is gon be so mad
Can't fuck with no bitches they left in the past
I stay with the clan, but we never clash
I got that white
I got the pills
I got the Yay
Look at your jewelry
You know that it's fake
I'm rockin the bape
Can't trust no ho
They fuck on your friends
They only want bands lil baby a stan
She open like cans
She know I'm the man
She know I'm the man
She know I got bands
I stick to the plan
Man fuck is you saying
It was tough but I made it
You nervous why are you shaking
I smoke that gas like Jamaican
You niggas rowdy like Haitians
All my gang wearing red
You niggas run into feds
I fuck that bitch with my hands up
You niggas holdin her legs
My backpack always LV
My soul is mine ain't no selling
Why you sell yours ain't no telling
I got the pack and it's mailing
Yuh yuh
I got the pack and it's smelly",https://genius.com/Yeroc-i-got-that-lyrics

Devil talking on my shoulder
He like yeroc what's yo purpose
Tryna get me nervous
Cause he know a nigga working
Lil baby what’s yo name

Only fuck with 10's

Look at my past

Demons they pushing my pride
Just look at my eyes
I’m ready to die
Feeling this pain inside
I close my eyes
But I won't cry
All the times that I'm feeling so lonely
Hearing all these voices said they been looking for me
Seeing all these bitches but they really never love me
They just tossed around like we all playin rugby

Takin drugs I do it all !!!
Sippin lean hope I don't fall !!!
These niggas scared to rob me !!!
Cause it can turn to a hommy !!!

Rock it right over the tommy

Grill in my mouth make me a talk with a lisp
Nigga can't buy all this drip
Born with this shit like a slave I got whips
I just go hard with this shit
To be hones man I'd die for this shit
Catch me a play and it's lit !
Jugg and finnese ,am I stay in the mix
I put my heart and my soul
Ooo man this world is so cold
New money becoming so old
Leave all this drip on the flo

I hit ya girl on her cellular

Get off the phone man you wasting my time

Don’t fuck with hoes that are boney

Cause there is no pressing rewind
Just everyday stay on my grind
Wait for the stars to align
Look at my diamonds. you’re blind
Lookin at 12 thru the blinds !!!
I stay with the Calvin no Klein
You lurk thru my shit what you find ?
My niggas all on that gang shit
Get ya muthafuckin chain ripped
All of this money so ancient
Money talk my other language

These bitches be checking me out they be lying
Really they wanna be mine
Got all these watches I can’t tell the time
My bitch is gorgeous you know she a dime
Hit from the back and that bitch steady crying
Gave her some coke and she doing a line
Demons they driving me crazy
Whipping that whipping that baby
I hope that these drugs really save me
I heard ya raps you be faking
Put your hand we not shaking
Fuck a job I'm never slaving

Old bitch acting like she entitled
Singing on the dick like American Idol
Cancel my subscription I don’t fuck with tidal

Nigga was my main man I hated he folded
I can rap on any beat you know I chose it
No we ain’t sleep hell naw we devoted
I don’t even rap on this shit I float it
When the liquor in my I go ballistic
Pack coming in me and bandz just flipped it
Weird niggas mad cause the way I be living
I’m related to 2 chainz bitch I’m different
My boy tried to slime me
The opps know where to find me
My momma told me these niggas be grimey
Fell asleep then woke up and the stars were aligning
I got a nice watch on still come in late
I was running from 12 got my ass in shape
Nigga ain’t taking shit off my plate￼￼￼￼
I was selling grams since I was 16￼
My jaw be clenching when i’m off that bean
I’m an outcast but I’m still fresh and clean
Kick the cup I’m done with that lean￼￼￼
Kick the bitch out if she wasting my time￼
Might put her on tape she press rewind
These niggas rats they been chasing crime￼
She like cream pies ain’t talking key lime
I think she gone fuck she showing me signs
Im gon quit rap￼￼ when I run out of rhymes
Imma bear in that pussy ain’t talking Chicago
I rap with no cap my name ain't rylo
Just got high as fuck driving on Shiloh
Get hit with this point they call it a hollow
These niggas they faking fugazi and phony
Imma get rich as fuck they gon try to clone me
Ain’t signing no deal can’t nobody own me
I told my bro if he need anything just phone me
I feel like I’m the greatest
Drop top coupe Music loud with yo lady
I fly her out then u fuck then I ask her where she staying?
Got this nigga scared man I hope this nigga praying
His music ain’t bumping why the fuck this nigga famous
Imma be the hardest nigga out no doubt
I don’t do this shit with gimmicks or clout
I keep that pole on me so you know I from the south
I heard his whole squad fraud and that shit word of mouth
I’m a real nigga from head to toe
That nigga lying he ain’t serve no bows
Got expensive weed and I got shit for the low
They be on my ig like this nigga finna blow
He blew up with a gimmick I can’t respect that
He said he bouta try me we had to x that
How the fuck he gang banging he ain’t even got a set
It’s normal to a nigga I don’t even gotta flex
Im a young ass nigga with a big bankroll
His friends saw the beam and they all had froze
My hoes be laughing at em cause these niggas be some jokes
Put my shades on I don’t need black locs
I feel like I’m the greatest
Drop top coupe Music loud with yo lady
I fly her out then u fuck then I ask her where she staying?
Got this nigga scared man I hope this nigga praying
His music ain’t bumping why the fuck this nigga famous
Imma be the hardest nigga out no doubt
I don’t do this shit with gimmicks or clout
I keep that pole on me so you know I from the south
I heard his whole squad fraud and that shit word of mouth
Yo bitch got that water she gon let me swim
Ball out the muthafuckin gym
These racks in my pocket I walk with a limp
I got all these hoes I feel like a pimp
Can’t fuck with you heard your blunts be skimp
I was up early just trappin for meals
Fuckin with NTL you gon get killed
Do you got a scale? Weigh that ounce
Cheat on my bitch when I’m out of town

She know after I nut it’s time to bounce

You get one night with yeroc how does that sound?
Only reason you it is cause you a clown
