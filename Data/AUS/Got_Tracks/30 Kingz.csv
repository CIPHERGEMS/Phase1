Business Men,,2019,"303021 My Lads they stay ambitious
303021 Keep that hush on low with business

Ain't no gang shit lad we’re business men
You don’t do then business ends
Like MK lad Finish him
That disrespect
Gets stomped
If you stick ya neck
You get the rest?
Lad you can clean the rest
It’s ridiculous
Man we’re to busy getting paid for this
We’re made for this
On scene it gets dangerous
I swear they got them mics, them cams ready to react to this
Aye and thats cool (eshay)
Brothers making money moves too (subscribe)
Get money, tax paid, new shoes
Heard some brothers only did it for the views ( whos that x3)
We do this for the love ( Burn city x2)
The grind will never stop ( whos wit me)
Ain't no limit when your tryna reach the top
And if we do we ain't change like em dogs (woof)
Aye Look at them stats we’re filling them bags they run up in groups but we never lack
Aye run that
Run that
Back
Them critics theyre jealous to see it of course
Sa boys put melb on the map
Aye 685 been putting that work in
Them boys still lurkin
Been making moves since day 1
I swear ops out here still learning
Been dreaming of days like this
But days like this dont seem like a dream
Back when it was a nightmare to make a living
Now im living like a king
My lads come ready like john
Funny how these fags come running in groups
Takes 10 of these dogs to take one of us
When i pull that wick, notin new

Let me talk to the ops real quick
Cause the ops out there know none of this shit
Don’t know how to grind for the streets
When it comes down to it
They forget about the grind for the kids
A little dangerous
No one compares to us
Move on cause the game is ours
These ops know when it goes down better bring your crew
Cause this is not a fucking game to us
Now who’s gon make that move lad
This what you really wanna do lad
Talk that talk but you won’t do nothing
We all know it ain’t you lad
Know that I had to grab the mic this way
Scratch that spit facts
And you know I got a lot to say
Pay checks
Got nothing to lose and here’s truth
Cashflow
Got a lot of it coming our way
And even then we still moving bags
Take the xs only deal with stacks
This the grind that put us on that track
Th thirty twenty one that put us on that map !
There’s too many us
And only little dem
Real talk ain’t no need to pretend
I got a Glock  in my hand
And when I pull back
Better know that
We don’t fold that
That’s literally the end
303021 My Lads they stay ambitious

Strictly Business,,2019,"It’s straight business but why these boys never learn
Aye pick up the line and get to the boys, it’s time we put in that work
Lord forgive my boys for em cheffings but we made it out of the dirt
Don’t count days but counting them blessings, had your fun but now it’s our turn
It’s straight business but why these boys never learn
Aye pick up the line and get to the boys, it’s time we put in that work
Lord forgive my boys for em cheffings but we made it out of the dirt
Don’t count days but counting them blessings, had your fun but now it’s our turn

Aye hit that lip when you hit that spliff
Don’t stop puffing lad hit that quick
They made me mess up the flow like this
Cuz ain’t nobody ever roll like this
Aye watch this flow
Specially when I’m on the beat
I kill this thing then bag it , issa murder scene
Grip that steel , them leg it like an athlete
But ima convert this ting to a masterpiece
Who wants to rock right now
They don’t even wanna talk right now
Get involved right now
Watch them boys see
Them lads thinking of dropping the ball right now
Gotta give it to ya certain way
No time for acting
And give it to ya straight
Only bringing that wick but never been about flame
Got me spitting that bar
Then I'll flip em into chains
Where you going? Best believe we never back down , these ogs here to tell you where it’s at now
We was from the burn but they put us on the map now
Get ready to feel it cuzzy go and check the stats now
They saying sweets your killing em now
My lad I wasn’t finished
Watch me pop both knees
Or watch his skull bleed
Stuff that get the strap and just send it

It’s straight business but why these boys never learn
Aye pick up the line and get to the boys, it’s time we put in that work
Lord forgive my boys for em cheffings but we made it out of the dirt
Don’t count days but counting them blessings, had your fun but now it’s our turn
It’s straight business but why these boys never learn
Aye pick up the line and get to the boys, it’s time we put in that work
Lord forgive my boys for em cheffings but we made it out of the dirt
Don’t count days but counting them blessings, had your fun but now it’s our turn

Hit back to back like im jordan
And cut that beat like im wrek
Flip heat with that wrist whip back like im gordon
Still take shots just fire with no steel
Got buckets loaded with jack and no jill
And if they pop back like ed edd and eddy
I’d still make sure that i murder with no kills
Aye Pick up the line and get to the boys
Tell em run this track say less (say no more cuz)
Say less, Been grinding hard we been working
Come westside where we doin it best
Aye who them boys on the block
Who them boys on the block (who)
We stay humble but when
Things go down Hill
You might get got
You might get (got got got got)
No sam smith but its burning
No you's here but I’m turning
Call me peter brock when im swervin (Swerve swerve)
Whip it, set it, flick it, cheff it
Kick it like mendez thats business comprende

It’s straight business but why these boys never learn
Aye pick up the line and get to the boys, it’s time we put in that work
Lord forgive my boys for em cheffings but we made it out of the dirt
Don’t count days but counting them blessings, had your fun but now it’s our turn
It’s straight business but why these boys never learn
Aye pick up the line and get to the boys, it’s time we put in that work
Lord forgive my boys for em cheffings but we made it out of the dirt
Don’t count days but counting them blessings, had your fun but now it’s our turn

It’s straight business but why these boys never learn
Aye pick up the line and get to the boys, it’s time we put in that work
Lord forgive my boys for em cheffings but we made it out of the dirt
Don’t count days but counting them blessings, had your fun but now it’s our turn (its straight business)",https://genius.com/30kingz-strictly-business-lyrics
