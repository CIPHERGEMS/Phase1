Debris Told Me,2011 Golden Era Mixtape,2011,"We got DJ Madcap breaking it down right now. This next track got left off State of the Art and it's a goddamn tribute to the DJ. Debris wassup!

He told he set it, 'I set it off'
Debris told me to set it, 'Set it off, man!'
He told he set it, 'I set it off'
Debris told me to set it, 'Set it off, man!'
""Set it off, get it off, let it off—Get it""
""Set it off, get it off, let it off—Get it""
""Set it off, get it off, let it off—Get it""
Moving while, we keep it moving while
""Set it off, get it off, let it off—Get it""
We keep it moving while, we keep it moving

Man, I been 'round the world representin', where've you been to?
Begin to realise we've been down, we've been true
'Cause hitting the booth, not spittin' 'bout what you've been through's
Like going to the toilet and putting *clears throat* in you
 watch you like
You could sell records but it's just that you choose not to (Right)
Well not true, I got something to drop for ya
You're not underground bro, you're just unpopular
'Cause underground's a state of mind, it's a place in your heart
It's when your breaks and your rhymes are fuckin' state of the art
And this is State of the Art, you should've stayed in the yard
""Whinging and moaning aren't ya
You never stop moaning and whinging
And whinging and moaning
Moaning, whinging"" princess you're breaking my heart
Meg Ryan, I've never ever seen someone fake it this hard
And I'ma take 'em apart
And set this off, it's like the pube in the urinal
Getting aimed at by a dude in a cubical, man, I'm pissed off

He told he set it, 'I set it off'
Debris told me to set it, 'Set it off, man!'
He told he set it, 'I set it off'
Debris told me to set it, 'Set it off, man!'
""Set it off, get it off, let it off—Get it""
""Set it off, get it off, let it off—Get it""
""Set it off, get it off, let it off—Get it""
Moving while, we keep it moving while
""Set it off, get it off, let it off—Get it""
We keep it moving while, we keep it moving

Hey sweetie! I'm fuckin' out of this world, believe me
Reaching me means you got a short skirt and ouiji
Debris be the keeper of cuts
If your older brother hates the Oars your younger sister's sneaking us up
Chump! You fresh? Fuck whatever you said
That still remains to be seen like identifying the dead
It's the mister speaking shit, fucking with Trials
Is like fucking your wife and waking up with a leaky dick
Suspicious, come run with us
Crammed in a car like pretty women and one mirror (Jump in)
It ain't like I'm something famous
I'll be lucky if the girl I f— (Oh yeah) can remember what my name is
(Who are you?!) They still sookin' like I owe somethin'
Fuck 'em, rum dry lime on ice like Ben Cousins'
And I'm done wit 'em, *psst* pigeon
Livin', shittin', I'm pickin' the crumbs Debris give 'em
Set it off, man!

He told he set it, 'I set it off'
Debris told me to set it, 'Set it off, man!'
He told he set it, 'I set it off'
Debris told me to set it, 'Set it off, man!'

1979,A Matter of Time,1999,"Know what I'm saying, in nineteen-seventy-nine
I was a two-year-old kid from 
Adelaide
I wasn't a fourteen-year-old kid from the Bronx
It seems to me that in nineteen-ninety-nine
Hip-hop's a business, in nineteen-seventy-nine it's culture
And I miss it

You're so fake, it's plain to see who you truly are
Looking less like a b-boy, more like a movie star
Forget the funk and go hook up those disco breaks
Sit down punk and take a look at what you make
It's not hip-hop, it's something more sad, sick and seedy
What's popping that Gucci got to do with graffiti?
And your R&B dance-steps, what about finger-popping
B-boy electric shocking, windmills, body rocking?
So body-body rock, body-body rock, I take it back
Break your back, realise b-boys aren't faking that
Funk that you've forgotten hoe, how could you have gotten so
Far gone that you could never stop and go
Back to the roots, nineteen-seventy-nine
Birth place of the scratch, birth place of the rhyme
Feel it in your spine like your first taste of wine
We'll make it back; it'll just take some time

Remember Kangol hats, fat laces and lino mats
Kids spinning on their backs to the Sugarhill wax
Now the sugar hills collapsed and the sweets turned sour
Money's walking my culture through its darkest hour
Now I wanna take you back, walk along through time
I was two years old in nineteen-seventy-nine
But it's a time that I miss; you ask ""What's the difference?""
Hip-hop was then a culture, now hip-hop's a business

""The—The music—The—The—The music
The—The—The music—The—The—The music
The—The—The music—The—The—The music
The music of our youth
From—From nineteen—From—From—From nineteen
Nine—Nine—Nineteen-seventy-nine
Nine—Nineteen-seven—Nineteen-sev—
Nineteen-sev—sev—seventy-nine

Zulu's started b-boying as a form of expression
To channel youths stress and their aggression, now through the suggestion
Of record companies MC's are pumping these
Problems back into your section 
(And isn't it ironic?)
But not the sort that makes you laugh
'Cause MC's are building futures by raping the past
Taking a glass of Chardonnay and putting it to your lips
I'd rather take a razor blade and put it to my wrist
Than sell records on the basis that I have to promote
Sniffing and selling coke, toting guns and smoking dope
You're all weaving the rope that you'll hang yourself with
My only consolation is within the hip-hop nation is
B-boy elements that could still get me open
Like Graff mags from Berlin, mixtapes from Oakland
Breakers from Rock Steady, plus anything from Tribe
And old school New York that's still got the vibe

Remember Kangol hats, fat laces and lino mats
Kids spinning on their backs to the Sugarhill wax
Now the sugar hills collapsed and the sweets turned sour
Money's walking my culture through its darkest hour
Now I wanna take you back, walk along through time
I was two years old in nineteen-seventy-nine
But it's a time that I miss; you ask ""What's the difference?""
Hip-hop was then a culture, now hip-hop's a business

A Matter Of Time,A Matter of Time,1999,"""Matter of time""
""Matter of time""
""Matter of time""
""Matter of time""
""Matter of time""
""Time will tell everything""
""Matter of time""
""Time will tell everything""
""That's all it takes
Pressure... and time""

It's just a matter, now what's the matter?
At a point in time it seems my mind just clatters
Rappers  in my sight, fill 'em with spite and grudges
When all the fools around, I want you falling down like Michael Douglas
So, royal, imperial, dude you're speaking anorexia
Your toilet material like force feeding anorexics
I'm official like this track that you're getting this song
You're living in the past, while my name'll live long
That foolery ain't used that's why the greats are calling me
When you get given shows, I swear you're cloaked in jewelery
'Cause all I need is a sense of pride, regardless if I make it
While I shine like a jewel, you singing ""Who will save your soul""
Fakers fold when the break is sold, step off
Sucking so much dick, that's what you'll do for twenty percent off
With your budget nametag, talk up Adelaide fag
I'm just doing my thing, while you're screaming your name's bad
And they find no thing toy, they find no thing
I know you can sing boy, I know you can sing
But you dissing me's a joke and that is
Rapping faster than a epileptic spitting words at speed
Did it occur that you need to slow down, think about it
While I toast to a bottle and MC's are drinking out it
So I run up in your game like your girlfriend's a sport
I meat your names as lyrics, and shit in that food for thought
I wonder who would've bought this if I had a name
Social crimes can't dispute this sliding down the laderless frame
It's a status game, cause what you wanna claim
Is the baddest name, even that is the same
For gather the fame, it's the same, repetitive
So to make moves I play chips and sedatives, you better 
My heart's on this track now, I'ma take yours from you
It's just a matter of time before the Pressure puts it on ya

""Matter of time""
""Time will tell everything""
""Matter of time""
""Time will tell everything""
""Matter of time""
""Time will tell everything""
""Matter of time""
""Time will tell everything""

Ha, hah
Seconds pass man it's passed, selfless path
Like, sands of time through an hourglass
For now I bask in the summertime Australian
On towards the dawn of the dead, the Armageddon
Mankind in 2000 is frightening
The violence is no longer hiding
It's riding this storm that's approaching
Pandora's box and the
Hood's are coming, the storm we riding on
We'll hit the ground running when we crash like a comet
To the surface, it's us versus the worthless
Turn the world into a furnace when we bust first
The Earth is a lyric, insane with the flow
Verse, when you hear it you, can't let it go
You're trapped in a trap, immersed in sound, sometimes
We stash surface dwellers, then take 'em underground
See the world from our side, reverse polarity
And look through our eyes, the curse of clarity
Everyone's fake, self centered
Demented, street centred snakes
But on the flip side, I guess there's a bright side
But on the dark side, it's actual windy like a riptide
If I give into stress I guess I, give into anything
So it's best I keep on like perpetual motion
And ignore the storm clouds gathering on the coast
And not give into emotion, be strong
Keep on running like roues as time creeps on
And keeps on, we sleep on out feet dreaming
We should probably seem as to be gone, be gone
The time sneaks on, another minute and we're blind
At least with the track you can press rewind, kid, it's time

B-Boy Battlegear,A Matter of Time,1999,"Night time in winter, it has a certain atmosphere
I enter, the outer with a leash on my Staffordshire
Clasping my right hand, my mask is a darkness
My hoody and my headphones are the B-Boy Battlegear
My walkman grinds a tape that's been in there since the night before
A rapper makes a statement that sends shivers down my spinal chord
Soul is in my walkman, and spirits in my step, a
Leash is in my right hand and my pocket hugs my left, a
Night has so much power, when I step I feel the streets scream
It's just a light shower but the rain, it makes the streets steam
It all seems familiar, I know that I've been here before
I notice an engravement on the pavement I made years before
The statement from before, finds it's way back into my mind
Inspired, my mind's fired up with subconscious freestyle rhymes
I fall into my own world, my status is trance like
I haven't felt like this in ages, well that is since last night
Like a Sadas with a glass, but I exhale tragedy
And gradually, start to inhale positivity
The dignity in knowing that you have no regrets
And everything you have and own is built through your own sweat
And toil, keep it moving, keep on burning midnight oil
And as I walk the night, my Nikes leave impressions in the soil
I check for cars and cross the road, cause I've finally found a pay phone
I pick up the receiver and I'm greeted by the dial tone
The night has so much power, I want to be a part of it
This is a light shower and I'm walking through the heart of it
The night time realm, I'm overwhelmed by the atmosphere
My hoody and my headphones are the B-Boy Battlegear
The night has so much power...
It's just a light shower...
The night time realm...
My hoody and my... (echoes)

Clap Your Hands To The...,A Matter of Time,1999,"STH
Oh Yes Yes Yes

And just clap your hands to the beat box
I said ah clap your hands to the beat what
Just clap your hands to the beat box
And
Just clap your hands to the beat what

I step in the dirt, listen to this man flex
You make me sick like guys with man breasts
You make me wanna throw up 
I grew up in the hilltop
I've got the rhymes that will still rock

I'm sicken on this track, it's not fair
But this beat box is thicker than DJ Dyems' chest hair
He keeps flowing with his stiffens are poking out
Of his ....

It gets looser than an elephant nine months pregnant
I could say I represent but that's just irrelevant
This is all for jamming cause dammall for ranbull they call me Dan 'cause I slam

Oh learn to be slaming
Oh learn to be slamming on on on on on
Oh learn to be slammding

Common Streets,A Matter of Time,1999,"It's all the same, regardless of your rep or your name
Rappers walking in the rain, tryin' to state their claim
I can take the weight, I just take the back pain
There's much to be gained from the money and fame
(It's like that) I feel the power when I hear it in the streets
(It's like rap) Used to be about the lyrics and beats
(Behind that) Then turned my rhythm to commercialism
And now this curb is a prison for us to walk common streets

Now if my flesh is weak, my passion is my shield
And my strength is my speech in which I'll make men yield
'Cause in this field of expertise, many rappers flex with ease
Using hip hop as gimmicks and wish to gain sex with ease
With a joint or a bottle and a picturing posing crew
The only thing I learned is I can only trust a chosen few
I got respect for my crew and love for my home
Never claimed a crown or throne from the use of microphones
Just let me rise while all you critics clothing minor skies
Penetrating you're fakin' as you look into my eyes
And my surmise will be the day that hip-hop dies
Or at least until the day the mass of boys stop telling lies
With every step more of your faith companies supporting any
Every breath or laugh I take makes me gag in nausea
It's just the asthma; It's chokin' me, vocally
Provokin' me to live with frustation with words colloquially
'Cause globally I'm fucked, if you ever notice me
So I cling to what I got and rock the spot with a pro to see
'Cause sometimes, the people just don't want to let go
Now put that mic down before you get crushed like Thredbo
But hold it now, who said we're walking common streets?
You just kept robbing them beats, hip-hop got stolen, foul
Some lost their creativy and our sense of pride was humbled
Ali threw in the gloves so now I'm Rumble in the Jungle
Don't you worry cos them punks will fall off figures, time's our only shackle
You lost that love I feel, you fall but I'm fine, but crackles
And only time is able to heal the wounds, that was open
From much choking the community and food bag
'Cause hypocrites, contradicting shit, every bit of it
I've heard more to say from dads to their children that be illiterate
I just hung my head in my hands and kept working on them beats
For now we're walking foreign lands, maybe one day common streets

It's all the same, regardless of your rep or your name
Rappers walking in the rain, trying to state their claim
(I can take the weight, I just take the back pain)
There's much to be gained from the money and fame
(It's like that) I feel the power when I hear it in the streets
(It's like rap) Used to be about the lyrics and beats
(Behind that) Then turned my rhythm to commercialism
And now this curb is a prison for us to walk common streets

It's all the same
Common streets

""Can you feel it? Can you feel the vibe?""
(Seems I'm in a dream as I walk through just outside)

Looks like we're leaving to the people walking by""

Deaf Can Hear,A Matter of Time,1999,"Oh my God boy, Bukue One here with the Hilltop Hoods man
Come and hear, aiyyo
The year 2000, we got something new
We on some next, way out of here
We got stuff so dope you know
Guess what, even the deaf can hear, yeah

It's the Hilltop Hoods and Bukue in the place
From the place where kids rhyme with flies on their face
(Australia) and the Oakland crew
(Star Fighter number one to y'all, Bukue)
Hear us, they feel it in their spirit and they cheer us
Fabulous flows from the three life feelers
Fact met your match yep, the fact test, I snap necks
Like whiplash, I get down, I get smashed, so sit down
Don't get rash, just check out, the kick out ...
Now hear this, I'ma tell you what I like
I like crowds when they scream, hate when they booing
Hip Hop that's clean, not rap that's diluted
I like to dispute the ... undisputed
Like to kick a style, teaching Howard how to do it
Now hear this, don't read my lips
The only sign I want to see in the air is a fist

Sign language not needed when we appear
With these flows so deep even the (deaf can hear)
Heartfelt delivery is loud and clear
Simple telepathy so the (deaf can hear)
If you're not feeling this then disappear
We don't need you cos the (deaf can hear)
Our sounds penetrate like the ancient spears
Penetrating the soul so the (deaf can hear)

Top of the hills with contents under Pressure
Star Fighter Bukue makes you Sufferer
Now hear this ...
Irresistible lyricism with compatible turntable techniques
Speaking with vocal presence of a messiah
Who inspires all, sets tracks on fire
You be torched out, radiating heat no doubt
Burning toys from the inside out
Crowds burst into flame, each bomb makes it hotter
Before the show I hid all extinguishers
Hahaha, no way of prevention
It was either burn to death or smoke inhalation
Alleviates you a painful existence
Allow your spirit to ascend (rest in peace)
All this seen at the show very clear
Rhymes penetrate so even the deaf can hear

Sign language not needed when we appear
With these flows so deep even the (deaf can hear)
Heartfelt delivery is loud and clear
Simple telepathy so the (deaf can hear)
If you're not feeling this then disappear
We don't need you cos the (deaf can hear)
Our sounds penetrate like the ancient spears
Penetrating the soul so the (deaf can hear)

It's the Hoods, you can't hear this? Then get my picture
Cause all I need's a beat, bass and lip twitcher
To fix ya, it's audible without the use of sign wave
As I sways, your mind play, now emcees do it my way
Now I'll wait, cause time's ticking, my rhymes kicking
I feel my mind tripping on words and phrases, the lines thicken
My memory, from the next emcee's telepathy
But I leave 'em deaf and dumb and put in double jeopardy
Regrettably, some are hard in their interior
Even the deafest emcees be yelling ""Crack it man, I'm hearing ya""
Now whether the fans are cheering ya or whether they're rivals
Whether their freestyle recitals just be needing some titles
They all listen in, to rhyme slander
It's the 
highlanders
, full pride demander
Beats might slam ya, and your peer's weak
Radiate toxic thoughts over deaf, hear me clearly

Sign language not needed when we appear
With these flows so deep even the (deaf can hear)
Heartfelt delivery is loud and clear
Simple telepathy so the (deaf can hear)
If you're not feeling this then disappear

Give it Up,A Matter of Time,1999,"I clutch my chest for some breath that eludes me
Plain and truly, you try and comprehend your words but you lose me
Stubborn my character, I'm hanging loosely, to some loose leaf
Sign wave, it's my face, the motion moves me
I stagger awkwardly, unfortunately most can't walk with me
I thought we'd be of similar faith, yet still they talk of me
I've got a heart full of soul, yet all the hawkers be
Thoughtlessly moving through life forgetting this importancy
Now lessons taught to me fly by me like memories
That's when embers leap out, I sit produce the tendencies
I shift my energy to enemies who pretend to be
A friend of me, regularly play the greater tongue tenancies

You gots to give it up cause it's a matter of time right
I rhyme tight, it's fine like a model in the limelight
I shine light, so gets the message like a sign right
You'll find high lyrics then regret it in hindsight
I shine bright in rhyme fights with my mind right
You looking blindside and rhyme bite, kid tonight is my night
I might, blind your eyesight with my analogy
Let's clear the stage if you want to come battle me
Expand it like the cells and calories, so challenge me
I harness the beat, that's how to ring em', bring the cavalry
Shallow be MC's, irritating like an allergy
Hallowed be thy name if you want fame or salary

Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up
Everybody sing
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up
Everybody sing
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up
Everybody sing
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up
Everybody sing

...You gots, you gots, you gots
You gots to give it up cause I know that you're on it
A B-Boy, the force in my soul is sonic
My words are commen-tating on the planet
The earth I tread, my sneakers hit the granite
And I'm moving, at the speed of sunrays reflecting
Off mirrored city buildings (my sneaks keep in step)
Along the city streets that I'm walking
Inside my Walkman, I feel the vibe of an MC talking
(Speaking... spoken...)
The words tap your soul and the verse gets you open
Like the mind of a bass head hitting the pipe
I step through the day and walk into the night

Give up the one-liners then I break em' in half
Give em' two back to take back in the arse, just for faking my art
Now they faint in the heart, just for making the chart
I gots to break em' apart and forsake em, depart
From my path like a Jehovah's Witness
I move the crowd 'til they got motion sickness, in flows my sickness
From the cream of the crop, who rose the thickest?
I run a stage just to show my fitness, and post a witness
My microphone durability, your crew admittedly you knew was feeling me
Come from my true stability
I draw energy from MC provoking
But I don't draw breath just to leave words unspoken

Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up
Everybody sing
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up
Everybody sing
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up
Everybody sing
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up

Hilltop
""That style is the craziest""
Suffa you know your rhymes amaze me just
""Get on the mic""
Let's show em' who'se craziest

This be the Suffa MC enhancing the track
I treat the mic like a show girl, romancing her lap
So when it's time for tips don't forget my rhyming tricks
So live it's on the (starlist???) cos I got the vinyl licks
Ya spine'll rip open and I'll make your mind eclips
Independant, giving major labels minor fits
I'ma rip, (polyflip??) and give MC's them siezures
You're rapping like the Dala in Indonesia, I see ya
And it's your fate I see, it's like a two dollar hooker with HIV
You wanna step and be friendly? I'll rip your style apart
You'll end up like Kenny from Southpark
So just try to fade me, just try to fade me just, try to fade me kid
We're the craziest
I've seen others and I was like ""shit he sucked""
I bring the stress to your chest like a hooker getting titty fucked
This kid errupts from the hills, I guess he got skills so
MC's are getting treated like a dyke with a dildo
It feels so good you'll moan like Tabatha Cash
As Nick scratch this vinal like the record had a rash
Like cash I'm errupting, styles have you suffering
The air that you suck has your lungs rupturing
Suffa bring invincability, ya can't hurt me jerk
Just pass a cold one cos it seems thirsty work like

""My Style is the craziest""
Hilltop
""That style is the craziest""
Pressure you know your rhymes amaze me just
""Get on the mic""
Let's show em' who'se craziest

Now this be the capital pressure, from Hilltop these MC's flex
Deeper than the bonet proof of nexus (??) the MC says
'The Hoods release text
I bet that you'll release threats for the next to sweat'
Now please let ya mind follow me like a preist to his panthem
The anthem, if they left standing then I hand them
The tool of my trade reflects the trade of my tool
I cool in the shade now Suffa take em' to school
But it's cool, MC's are made to be broken like rules
I take my chance and either walk away a king or a fool
The waters deep my friend, you can't wait your turn so
They choose to burn boats then turncoat like Cherral Kerno
They'll learn though, as time takes it's course my rhyme breaks the force
Of ya spine to make ya toss, so convulsive, so repulsive until your mind is numb
Now just stop your encroaching by, your time has come
Now I'm the one, but to tango it takes two
Cos MC's be talkin' hard times but to me it's easy
I ran through life's lessons, tript on, survived destines
To shoot my fate, could ecumulate my mic lessons
But I didn't - I made what I got from just the spittings and persistance
I got to nurse my baby, what's the differnce?
A little patience and let time be, you go through situations
Lessons full of life's vibrations

""My Style is the craziest""
Hilltop
""That style is the craziest""
Next you know your cuts amaze me just
Get on the decks
""Show em' who'se craziest""

A sense of pride so let's just ride off my anguish
Have the sense to slide and coincide with my language
I got microphones and my piece of mind
Despite my closure, get a piece of mind off my problem beats and rhymes
I got my own view, my own reflection in the mirror
I got enough noise to make micky loud, I scream I hear ya
I got plenty of mates 
and I've got plenty of enemies
And I've got plenty of hate 
for the many bad memories
I got energy that's translated into speech
When I'm 
""rocking beats, beats, beats""
The beats on my acca will make the world go round
And then I put it on my rollin, rollin, rollin
Roll the sequencer, two seqencer, track format
And mate I gotta speak with yer
I got problems with my wage try'na make ends meet
I guess it's either getting paid or respect on the street
I got envy and jealousy, you're planning on telling me
To drop a new LP cos the melody's remedy!
I got my own shadow that follows me in footsteps
I've had enough people worrying about the props that the Hoods get
So why not, 
worry about what you've got
Cos I got, 
enough of that old fly rock
To make your girlfriends thighs rock

Check what I got, her own hands between her legs
Had a tap like a keg while you was drinking the dregs!
She's full of styles, fine - told her a look to lick the fingers
Answer up the bass line, hook from Charlie Mingers
And lingers in the track makes you believe in God when
Suffa's so phat, I guess I got a weight problem
I got a squadron of b-boys ready to break em' off
I break em' off there and then, from a cut of me costing
I got you at a loss when you give it up like charity
Got clarity, I spose I get exposure like a gallery
I got a four door car and a three room home
I got weekly repayments on a two grand loan
I got one life to live and no second chances
And mates that are writers and rhymers that are break dancers
Clothes on my back and friends that I trust
I got flows that are phat and a heart full of lust
I got a sense of pride, I got agility and speed
Immense ability, man I got everything I need

I got 3 Hoods, the closeness for 3 times the dopeness
See even if the nation carcus, situation is still hopeless
I got my notice from non-composers from their posters
I suppose someone becomes the dopest (and you notice)
I got a mic that's my companion, my hood labels me champion
We're here to get your publishes with you, we're undemanding
I live a life that's demandive but still got positivity
I got to explore each and every posibility
Hip Hop is feeling me, it's going straight to my head
""Like those seizures when I rap I'm taking grape juice and Sudafed""
If you can get brews then I got ryhmes
I got a cavalcade of battle rage to I got mine so
""Get thrust, cos other MC's can't deal with us""
I feel a must to get what I haven't got
A stagnate rock is filling my ears and getting more played like Panadol
""I got a sense of direction and a compass
Drive past MC's with no compassion, though I heard the scream sounds""

Check it out, (what you got), I got
Check it out, (what you got), I got
Check it out, (what you got), I got
Check it out...
I got
Hundreds of people asking me, getting pissed with me
And dissin me
Literally blasting me, asking me
When the Hoods' new album's gonna drop
And where it is, well here it is
Man I got
The mic in front of me, peeps to the back of me
Pressure to the right of me, my soul inside of me
I got a variety of rhymes (I rock the spot)
I got notoriety of rhymes (talk about what I got)",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-whatcha-got-lyrics

Come on

We carve a song from a riff in a '70s track
And if it's strong in the mix then we set it in wax
We etch words on the papyrus, what's happened? The pattern is so immaculate
The back of a Macci fractures and cracks from the impact of it
Rummagin' for drums to put in back of it and match with it
Hack and then attack in the track, scatter and wraps with it
Back in the lab, I know our absence was felt
Man, it couldn't be helped, but now we're back from it
With hands in the clay we mix the sand with the paint
We take the can and we spray, and your standards won't stand in our way
On the land that we lay we know the lay of the land
We take every break and we shape it by hand
The cuts in my hands and the lines in my face
Are from the cuts and the jams and the lines that I lace
That got you up in the stands and to a time and a place
When the love took 'em in and we blind to the hate

This is handmade, tailored for all of the fans' sake
No artificial additives are added, just mad breaks
No saturated fats, natural made and that way
The track's laid, keep you satisfied through the ad break
It's handmade, tailored for all of the fans' sake
No artificial additives are added, just mad breaks
No saturated fats, natural made and that way
We keep you satisfied ""what you know bout me?

Get 'em P

We in the kitchen cooking up a storm
Fixin' up your supper on the deep frier spittin' and the oven's warm
This ain't a buffet food plate past the used date (nah)
This is gourmet souffle, quite a few mates
Planted our seeds in organic soil
Cause some starved for a feed when we leavin' the land of spoil
So we worked it and nurtured our hurt through the dirt
And went further, gave purpose and birth to it
Nothing came expedient, hustle game, belief in it
While Suffa was digging for another main ingredient
Company hated lunches, gluttony and abundance
Debris got the flavour, they hungering for some substance
So if you've been starved and you're after the garden fresh
Give your regards to Dazastah the Masterchef
You're still hungry, let me ask you world
Takin' our time in a fast food world

This is handmade, tailored for all of the fans' sake

Back Once Again,Back Once Again,1997,"""Once again
Back it's the incredible""

Once again the Pressure's back to put it on ya
From the Hilltop, the Southside'll bomb ya
Back to prolong the track up in your section
There's no time to watch, that's why I'm never coming second
My weapon's lyric, consider it more than half a brain
Rap's a part of me like my artery but it's my master vein
I cast a main, infect it with my verbal venom, might wanna bend it
Non-believers  to achievers and hurtled ascending
I just block them like a bridge in this world
With a restraining order, I'm the sort to, never be withheld
I gradually commit battering to your anatomy
Cat got your tongue cause you tried to be flattering
In actuality a competitors blown away like the head of a valley
Thorn proof, so grab me more crew to balance steadier
I'm way ahead of your man, your tracks are lame
I hear you rap for fame
Well I can take the weight, I just hate the back pain
Back again, like reflector said ""Don't mess around!""
'Cause not even John Farnham can take the ""Pressure Down""
From the inner me, i'm tired of a beginner to be
Making this whole earth sick like an mastic and took Madonna's virginity
With that publicity you talk, you took the fall in your walk
Tripping on some due respect and learn to crawl 'fore I walk
I come real Jimmy, like Steven Seagle, like an airbag
Man, it's just a fact, I'm forever fat
Pressure is back

""Once again, back it's the incredible""
""Once again, back it's the incredible""
""Once again""

It's the Hoods, we're back once again
And it's all good, but I pack lunches when
Step to Pressure, Suffa, it's the bomb plan
Once for your mind, the Hoods are back on again!
It's the Hoods, we're back once again
And it's all good, but I pack lunches when
Step to Pressure, Suffa, it's the bomb plan
Once for your mind, the Hoods are back on again!

""Once again""
""Once again""
""Once again""
""Once again""
""Once again""
""Once again""
""Once again""
""Once again""

The Hoods are back, back once again
Mix a sum I'm about to catch wreck
Like a bull in a China shop
Coming from a land down under, we are
""Back to reality"" (wohoo)
I elevate your mind like your brain was in a lift
Irritating and the same as the stain of the spliff
On your puffer, Suffa, suffer rock the ricks
This lyric kinda fat, like a san with cutripodis
Irritation of the sore, imitation of the poor
Rappers under the slightly instigation on the law
Information is as raw, inflamation of the raw
I'm writing tense shit that's more raw
That's word to your mother in law
You wanna step son? you gotta catch rec son
It's that hood shit, step over your own grandma to get some
Yet some, refuse to get down when your coming up and
I realised Adelaide's only good for steady fucking
You stuck in the runt, screaming ""old school""
Well chump, you're about as old school as last fucking month
I been a drunk, wanna get stuck into me?
Well, I been rocking raps since your grandma lost her virginity
Four infinitely rocking the style from within
You can't fight and win, why's that Pressure?
('Cause you're in for the south, the south side)
And I'm giving you a chance, and your, it's like mumps
You only get it once
So if you front, and kick no flow, here's a life guard
Hoods are on again to make MC's live hard

I dress a lies with my eyes and see the naked truth
My flex will break the blade, my weapon is my youth
I'm growing stronger with every breath you're growing weak like a kid with asthma
Grab your puffer suffer suffocating before i have to
 flow and breath before my but you
Smother me like an over caring girlfriend
I send this rhyme in the mail with braille cos it has to be felt when  like a virgin with a padlock on the chastity belt
Yeah it has to be felt but you're not feeling me or the ability
On my breath, take time like a thousand kid assembly
Assemble with the greatest minds you couldn't recreate this
A moment of time in your mind and take it like a rapist
Laying out your thoughts and the bottom lines is subconscious
Passing out you're lying on your back unconscious
Repulsing now frothing like your overdosing novacane
Push  fuck a south
Though I'm short of fame 
Still know my name
My thoughts spill through city streets like a burst water main
The cause of my pain is my ex girlfriend's bitches
The notches in my belt are mainly backstabbing bitches
The cause of my pain is hip hop 
When put a cap and hoody on a sacrificial lamb
The cause of my pain is tainted tongues at my back
Suffa suffocating put the pressure on the track

On the track, making mankind think before he act
The Pressure's back, back, back
Wake me resuscitate me I'm sleeping
I'm giving all I got 'cause all I got is what I believe in
Bleeding from my heart the day my own supremacy's astounding me
Jealously surrounding me suffering for my art unless they drowning me
On the track, I live forever
So regardless of the heartless, it's now or never

You inflate your ego by deflating my status
There's a method to your madness now my status is the saddest
Aggression hits, aggression hits with the hyper done
Message forgotten with me, Pressure rips a microphone
Remember this those that couldn't walk now follow
 lie today, future lie tomorrow
So I'll see you on judgement day and there'll be no redemption
If you listen to the track but you didn't pay attention
Your just writing rhyming raps a drop in the ocean
Rhymes mean jack unless they're packed with emotion
You can have 40 syllable patterns, metaphors like a genius
All this is nothing if you don't really need this
You've never seen this underground you're still learning that
My thoughts spill through city streets like a burst watermain
The cause of my pain is my ex girlfriends bitches
The notches in my belt are mainly backstabbing bitches
The cause of my pain is  Suffa
When you put a cap and hoody on a sacrificial lamb
The cause of my pain is tainted tounges at my back
Suffa suffocating, Quiromsytics got my back!

See you tried to rearrange, I sit in windowpane
My saddle up's longer than my vision or your name
Its concerns beyond the grave the surface
We play its not a level playing surface I struggle to attain
Remain across the track with tracks with me and Suffa
We live across the action consequence and I, as a kid, would wonder
Settle in the under
My thoughts become corrupt
My object  under
I wonder",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-mankind-must-suffer-lyrics
No Redemption,Back Once Again,1997,"The day of redemption is at hand. Repent! And thou shall be saved

Suffa, Pressure puttin' rappers out to pension
It's judgement day and there shall be no redemption
Suffa, Pressure puttin' rappers out to pension
It's judgement day and there's no redemption

For those that speak my name when they mention
All the lies that build the tension, I'll be on my comprehension
Tell me what's a rep if you ain't got respect from crews that get a lotta 
sweat
Against the odds you bet you better watch your step
The spot is wrecked when you nod your neck
'Cause Hilltop Hoods the bomb and check iron on a thread, still some wanna step
My rod is wet, boy you're hot and wet lips, you’re humming on the 
So stand back, we’re coming running, 
speech
With drumming beats, while some are playing for my name
So the renegade hoods and the panels to your fun train
That’s just one name, traded some fame for dignity
Your words are hitting me, and your cover show's bitten, see
So lyrically youse aren’t adequate, we got the mad shit
Your crew's weak and stand on loose feet, so you had to slip
As bad as it gets  had to recognise
That MCs are stressing lies, can't be arresting guys
The lesson lies in who got your back and if 
That's as bad as if he hung himself after female genetalia
Forever held the keys to lovers' persist
Must be seized and in danger but we cease to exist
That's why I'm saying fuck youse to those who could've signed us
But we had to give reminders like you had Alzheimer's
The code of the urban streets is logic so I'm treating words
Just like a culture with a verb, punk there's no redemption

It's judgement day and there shall be no redemption
Suffa, Pressure puttin' rappers out to pension
It's judgement day and there shall be no redemption
Suffa, Pressure puttin' rappers out to pension
It's judgement day and there shall be no redemption
Suffa, Pressure puttin' rappers out to pension
It's judgement day and there shall be no redemption

Don't ever, ever fuck with me. Don't ever lie to me, disrespect me, underestimate me. If you do, your life becomes a raging sea

My style is forever like it's frozen cryogenics
Suffa MC  genetic

 where I collect all the props, I should probably share more
I scare more rappers than DJ's fear arthritis
But I make emcees shut up like they had laryngitis
Try exploiting me like  female
The tightest,  on the internet, check your email
Detail is what you left out left out like the fat kid in gym?
 man this shit is thin
Walk the fine line between repeating and innovating
You're verbally dick-beating, lyrically masturbating
Masturbating in the public arena's a battle right
 you couldn't get live with a satellite
Misdemeanour from the misunderstood
And mysterious hood that even gets Vulcans excited 
You've been sleeping on me like I was rappin' under your mattress
Come at youse, get you open like a porno actress
The fact is you're factless 
I can't take in all these rappers, now that's a contradiction

Can I kick it? That's a rhetorical question
Ingestion of the style makes you dizzy like Petroleum
When Next spins the wax like 

Suffa, Pressure puttin' rappers out to pension
It's judgement day and there shall be no redemption
Suffa, Pressure puttin' rappers out to pension
It's judgement day and there shall be no redemption

Don't ever, ever fuck with me. Don't ever lie to me, disrespect me, underestimate me. If you do, your life becomes a raging sea

But come to me like a man, with your eyes open, head up, hand out... then I become more than a friend, more than a
Shoulder.  I become the expediter of your dreams",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-no-redemption-lyrics
Shades of Grey,Back Once Again,1997,"Shades of grey, shades of
Grey

Take a good look and tell me what you see but not what to be
I want to free, my life is falling in monopoly
With the monotony of each sunrise, this loss of colour
Runs in the times, while it sits in my mind but it's just another
Shade of grievous grey, like the previous day
You're picking 'round in my thoughts, seemin' to lead me astray
Won't you lead me away from all the drama for real?
'Cause what they come here to kill, the marijuana will heal
Yeah, I'll be kicked 'round but wouldn't sit down for no one else
Getting caught up in this shit,  to myself
But now I'm  tryna make somethin' from nothin'
 far from perfect so they must be suffering
And maybe it's the way  crazy astray
But I can't see in black and white no more, it's a shade, grey

Sick of the steady eye and the lie and believin' 'em
Like they're  suck a bit on the receiving end
I'm leavin' them 'cause they the wack show, tobacco
The only thing helpin' me is the pressure on my back so
The axe though, I'm  catchin' bloody 
 fat caps, so where's my bloody hat Matt?
Through time, who will lie to me and who will guide me
Through rhyme and make bystanders stand by me?
So try deny me the fact that I be highly
Respected by often neglected 
So to try me 'cause my life be  chronology
 no return follows me
And swallows me, brushin' this  paste
Tryin' to lead and keep faith in this world with no face
Trapped in the same place day and night, my brains fight
My mood shifts between  shades of light

Suffa grab the mic and  some black and white
Like a thirty  paint a picture from my mind like a thirty mill
Thirty mill 
Insinodate all the colours of the rainbow mixed
Grey shades, the way  fades away
 sections black and white
In my perception, vision is perception like perception is deceptive
Or precision 

Reflections of grey, perceptions of day
Deceptions of night, shades of light, shades of grey
Reflections of grey, perceptions of day
Deceptions of night, shades of light, shades of pernicious grey
I've been alive for two decades
The truth's in colour full but positivity fades
Until the pinnacle  perplex
I wanna 
Remaining  focusing only on production
My function's being slowed by the cannabis induction
Suctions, watch transition shades of black
 a beer short of a six pack

Colourless L-I-F-E, now stress me
Can't figure out whether a curse me or bless me
My sides are black and white, I feel the tension
When life moves by in only half its colour spectrum

Shades of grey (Shades of)
Life got me seein' shades of grey

Shades of grey blindin' me, constantly remindin' me
Bindin' me,  senses of thought in which I finally meet
Time will be one with Pressure, forever consume your days
Assume the ways of the knife, throwin' the light of blue in array
 dazed by this world I'm livin' in
Man, I feel like givin' in, but I didn't whip, I half-step it
So kick back fella, meddlin' with my thoughts I might just let off
""You don't wanna feel the pressure"" so step off
Take your mind less to break your time or break people
Hard to eat in at the odds when you can't even break equal
With yourself, so doofus, I'm a man, let me live this
All these shades of black and white, they got me seein' negative
Forever give my hearts to all spirits and that which 
Try retrieve 
That's just the way I act, just step the fuck away with that
It's all  that got me seein' shades of black

Lost into my scene, yeah
Hot like New Orleans in
Cosby crew and jeans, yeah

They’re not awakened, stare a lot and vacant
Living in conditions of the modern matrix
Only bare arms when I’m proper naked
Only point I made with a bullet was on paper
Ain’t here to fight some dude or fuck around with his spouse
Rather light your mood and burn it down with the house
Till your hype from the groove on account of the bounce
And looking like Tom Cruise, up and down on a couch
Status never mattered ever, act however
Like Christine Aguilera, just let yourself go
Mad at Pressure, an endeavour that is better left
Pristine track and record to let you all know
That we would be Kings even homeless
Building these kingdoms our own just
Slap a rapper like Solange Knowles
Till they’re gathering they no longer matter like a black hole

And it's all good
And it's all good
And it's all good
And it's all good

Always four moves ahead of
My competition listen

I feel as large as Biggie
Swear it could not get better
I feel in charge like Biggie
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater

I'ma step up every chance when I rumble
They all call me champ of the jungle, it’s fitting
I'ma get drunk and dance like your uncle
Till I’m all hands like your uncle, I’m kidding
The venomous inventor, when I enter then it's over
When I’m spitting venom I’m as generous as Oprah
You get a scar, you get a scar, you get a scar
Me? Drunk in the back of a rental car
Pat Benatar brah, love’s a battlefield
Here to get you out your seat like a battle drill
I’m in the saddle still, a little saddle sore
Smash you out the stratosphere, flashy as a matador
When I’m dressed like Theo’s dad
In a Coogi listening to Kool G Rap
I won’t beat around the bush like a seventies porn
I’ll make you wish that you’d never been born and it’s all good

And it's all good
And it's all good
And it's all good
And it's all good

[Verse 3: Pressure & 
Suffa

Take a ride on the wild side of this alley
We can fire up the night like Prince Harry
Fuck the high life, we can vibe like
We got white lines hanging from behind like we’re just married
I’ll turn the art form into a blood sport
And make pea soup out of a pea-brain
They wanna run these streets like parkour?
I’d rather run these tracks like a steam train
(Like a steam train, like a steam train, like a steam train)

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, we do this
Real B.I.G. 
Fine line between love and hate, but me, I'm cool on a tightrope (Kill it)
Mainstream shoulda took the warning
Knock down doors like the Hoods performing, so
How do I put this, shorty?
Goddamn Triple J, looking good for forty
Celebration 

So, what up boys? Give us a cheer
And save the Taylor Swift 
What better way to ruin a party
Dickheads talking Illuminati

Shit, now I said too much, Solo, what up?

And it can’t stop ,won’t stop (why not?)
Some are faker than botox (my god)
Forgive 'em for they know not what they do
But with no nonsense I step to the soapbox and
Drive a tow truck through your roadblock
Might blow up, but it won't go pop
Ain’t a soap opera
Still we do it up so proper like big poppa did
Can’t stop the kid I got a gift just like that day in December
The main contender, baby say you’ll remember
Hey big spender, pair of kicks to match my favourite sweater
All dressed up with nowhere to go except maybe a bender
Draphto

Sydney, what the fuck is up?
You gots to get down
And you wanna know something else?
It's Mr. D-rapht in the house
I'm feeling large
Feel the love, the buzz, the boom, the bap
The fact that we up here with the Hoods
One for the books
My brother from another mother
Mr. Suffa what's good?
The other day had the cops tryna bust me
(Why?) 'Cause I said ""Fuck Bill Cosby""
(Fuck Bill Cosby!) Cost me my freedom
Cut off his sausage as soon as you see him
Even on Beat of The Drum
 machine gun, bam
We keep on beating the drum
Sydney will you sing along with us?

Ayy
I only write raps when I'm bored as hell
And I got a dope beat and a quarter ounce
 tortoise shell glasses
Then I'm turnin' up my motherfuckin' Walkman loud (You bastard)
I just wanna walk around
Find other MCs and sort 'em out
Yo, last time I did, man, I almost drowned
'Cause I'm so watered down I should've brought a towel
I feel like Bobby Fischer
Personally I play lots of Twister
Where's your girl?  kids up
After school but I ain't ever lost against her
I didn't get what I want for Christmas
All I wanted was a Cosby Sweater
'Cause I still only ever wear hand-me-downs
And all I got is an older sister

I don't ask 'em where to get it 'cause they calling my name
Riding in a SUV, because I roll in the game
Times and times it was so empty, now I’m feeling kinda heavy
Tell them you can come and get but I ain't talking to them
You’re riding with a bunch a killers I don't rate them
Fellas taking up them leaves, but I just rake them
Tell me bout your other chick again and that one time
I will reach that Christian psycho, I might take hemp in different lanes
But they think were the same
Invest in my dreams and they watch in that lane
Beginning to sweat, if they jacking my game
Niggas wanna be me so much it is insane
You could get your man pants get in with that man dance
Niggas wanna get in, but don't have that status
I get in with that cosby sweater got no fat chance
'Cause I just cover that seat like I got a fat ass

I feel like Bobby Fischer

For the toad, hit the road for a couple of months
What you know 'bout the funk flow, givin' it up?
For Hilltops, Thundamentalists, chillin' the cup
Till it's showtime, blow minds, cities get crushed
They get hit with this blunt, I'm refined as a caveman
Blazin' on Adrian's vape pen, they say
That I'm baked in the brainstems, statements I spray
Are deranged as a baby gettin' raised in the basement
Full Fritzl, I got a few issues
Force-feed a vegetarian two schnitzels
Sit back and diss 'em cause I'm comfortable
In my skin, we close-nit like the Huxtables
And I think like, whatever happened to Rudy?
Is she broke on a stripper pole, clappin' her booty?
Rappers are bougie, sellin' pop records to kids
Got the nerve to act offended when I tell them that they didn't go in?
Shit, let the truth be told
I represent lost youth, call me Rufio
Do the show then we party like some maniacs
Bags packed, next day, another plane to catch

Should've seen me coming, turned to three-hundred
When I bust in and fire away
Mind the flames as I ignite the blaze
May the bridges I burn light the way
I'm just tryna get cool, blame it on the passion
In fact blame it on the fashion
Picture me listenin' to Biggie in a skivvy and some skinny jeans
Trendy motherfucka but the ladies say I'm dashin'
As it happens, I'ma smash in the door
Made a short straw and trade it for a napkin
Wipe the slate clean, never would have, I imagine
Openin' the stage for the A-Team
Get a kraken, proper madness
G-E runnin' that shit, we be
On the Thunda Cat flips, so
 
I'ma chase that feelin'
While the Hilltop Hoods drop a classic

Drinking from the Sun,Drinking from the Sun,2012,"I lay down my music ten feet from where I lay down
Immersed in them beats, short breaks turned to breakdowns
‘Cause when you work where you sleep, you don’t sleep
‘Cause you work on them beats till it hurts
 
then you creep
Into bed and wake her from her sleep, and she’s hurt
‘Cause she worked through the week and hasn’t heard not a word
Nor a peep from the jerk that she keeps in her heart
That she forgives when he nurse her to sleep, word it’s deep
Yo
When I peel them lids back and emerge from my sleep
I feel so big that I could make a shirt from my sheet
A crown from a church steeple, two jeeps for my sneaks
So people worship this creep as I surf down the street
I’m the surgeon of beats
, your girl purrs when I speak
We rehearse in a church to a circus of freaks
We the last ones to lay down, first on our feet
So stay down or get hurt by what lurks in the deep
Free the perps from the police, we disturbing the peace
We flood the streets like a water main burst and released
A merciless beast with a thirst for the feast
Man we treat every meal like it’s our first in a week
We dispersing the weak, I’m the person to beat
Man I’m unbeatable; I can beat a person for weeks
We disturbed, we the freaks, we the ones you don’t listen to
Drinking from the sun, now son we’re the ones dissing you

And we don’t 
(ever stop)
, we won’t 
(let it drop)
Lad-dah-di-da-dah
We don’t 
(ever stop)
, and we won’t 
(insult ya)
Let the vultures at the counter-culture
Now we don’t 
(ever stop)
, and we won’t 
(ever run)
Lad-dah-di-da-dah
We move mountains and drink from the sun

We’re timeless like riders on the storm
Survivors like the light that rises in the dawn
If crisis makes fighters of the pawns
We rise up through the night as lifeless and we’re born
Fight in my heart, suicide with my art
Till I depart I’m a write until I light up the dark
These are battle songs that lift you from your catatonic fixture
And I can walk on water but I stagger on the liquour
This ain’t a Saturday sport or matinee talk
With throw away sentences like the magistrates’ court
Scratch that, now hear me out, attacks don’t give me doubt
I drop a powerhouse track black the city out
And when we lose it let the mood of music reach us
Coming through the tunes that free us, revolution through your speakers
The third rock never stops, the world turns
Eyes glued to the clock as we watch the world burn

And we don’t 
(ever stop)
, we won’t 
(let it drop)
Lad-dah-di-da-dah
We don’t 
(ever stop)
, and we won’t 
(insult ya)
Let the vultures at the counter-culture
Now we don’t 
(ever stop)
, and we won’t 
(ever run)
Lad-dah-di-da-dah
We move mountains and drink from the sun

Renegades whenever on centre stage
That’s my sweat upon the letters I bled on the pen and page
C’mon, so what’s your rhyming worth? Better get a lawyer ‘cause
I could crucify your verse just to get a point across
We’ve been refining and grinding till late night
Why? ‘Cause even stars lose their shine in the day light
Linked as one, just think what we’ll become

Good for Nothing,Drinking from the Sun,2012,"I’m no good; yes I’m no good
Let me tell you no good, girl I’m no good
I’m no good for nothing
Get 'em P!

Problematic child from a god abandoned isle
Where Hip Hop is like a convict on a standing trial
Dropping havoc I’ll rock the planet wild
Till they shoot me in a movie Hong Kong combatant style
Plastic rapping and disposable culture
Poet or solider, falter and get thrown to the vultures
We wear our scars like a badge of honour sewn in the shoulder
Cross the unknown, rock alone like the coast of Gibraltar
Looking over my shoulder, radio and payola
Keep us alien on air like being flown by Travolta
Flow with a vocal assault of the microphone and controller
Harder to handle than a loaded revolver coated with sulphur
You in a house made of glass throwing a boulder
But never see the light of day car like car motors on solar
Going for broke don’t mean you’re going broke for the culture
We’d hang ourselves given rope and pergola

I’m no good; yes I’m no good
Let me tell you no good, girl I’m no good
I’m no good for nothing
And I might be no good but when I seize the mic
I can spit it like, like (Jesus Christ)
I’m no good; yes I’m no good
Let me tell you no good, girl I’m no good
I’m no good for nothing
And I might be no good but when I seize the mic
I can spit it like, like (Jesus Christ)

Beast of burden, carry the weight
I got divorced from reality to marry the break
In a bally and cape, I get carried away
Like a cadaver on a battlefield, make barriers break
Man my chariot waits; I can’t stay for the gala
Music is dead, fames alive Lady Gaga
They complain about the drama go
Play the martyr role better than Mohammed Atta
Suffa, grimy as Calcutta
Beat you single-handed like Def Leppard’s drummer
I’m about to blow like meth on the cooker
Leaving me with mic’s like leaving pets with the butcher
Don’t put a foot wrong, think for a good long minute
(Shut your mouth) put a foot-long in it
You’re dealing with one of the best to bust so
Tyler Durden, don’t beat yourself up bro

I’m no good; yes I’m no good
Let me tell you no good, girl I’m no good
I’m no good for nothing
And I might be no good but when I seize the mic
I can spit it like, like (Jesus Christ)
I’m no good; yes I’m no good
Let me tell you no good, girl I’m no good
I’m no good for nothing
And I might be no good but when I seize the mic
I can spit it like, like (Jesus Christ)

I am bad bad bad
If you can feel me
They say I am no good
I am bad bad bad
If you can feel me
They say I am no good

Feelin' better
Feelin' better

I Love It,Drinking from the Sun,2011,"I'm wondering where the day went
The clouds have me shrouded in grey but
I'm still out pounding the pavement, word
Drowning the hurt by pounding rounds in brown paper
Founded a label now I'm drowning in paperwork
But now the crew I'm down with found an escape from work
And I love it, 'cause that's what your hard work gets you
My heart bursts through my chest I'm rescued
So forget what the rest do
I'm blessed to do it with two of who are the best to do it
Do I love it?

Look at our goals
If we never stood in the cold, we wouldn't evolve
Use to put my crooked foot in what I couldn't resolve
But took control now, hard work is good for the soul
And I love it, growing through life and stress
Knowing the fight is just half of self-imposing our righteousness
Contract owners and licenses, showbiz in lights
We're just searching for that moment of pricelessness

B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b B-boys, I met you at the bus stop
We had nothing but the tuck shop
We had school ties, the sky and the hilltops
Now we're all grown up and it's still about Hip Hop
I love it, I love it

Five days deep in the booth
And spent Friday leaping through loops
Then spent the weekend sideways, seeking the truth
And I won't lie, they keep me on my toes these days
But I won't lie; hey, I beat 'em with the flow for days
'Cause I love it, a pen and pad's like a red rag to a bull
I see red like Leningrad
Raising a crowd from a vacant lot’s like, like how?
Raising a brow on the face of God, right? Right now

And I love it a life with no regret
No success without a price that owes a debt
I roll the dice and despite the road ahead
Hope that in a crisis, I might just know the ledge
But I love it like take-away beer
And a sunset to lay-away our day-to-day fears
See, haters underrate us but this status takes years
And it ain't where we at; it's how we made our way here

B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b B-boys, I met you at the bus stop
We had nothing but the tuck shop
We had school ties, the sky and the hilltops
Now we're all grown up and it's still about Hip Hop
I love it, I love it

And we can be in a hotel, worst part of town and
Support act, we ain't half as loud but
Twice as nice, you can ask the crowd then
We passing out in a departure lounge and
I love it; I hug the road like an old friend
Like the world won't revolve unless we're rolling on it
It holds them on it, it's soul melodic
And oh, they want it, come on, I love it

Been chasing the dream
Every day a new place, new faces and scene
Living out a suitcase
, few breaks in between
There's been very few days I'd lose faith in my team
Got love far from home through the winter and summer
No matter how hard the road or the distance I cover
Even bitter when I'm missing my significant other
I wouldn't trade it for the world given another
'Cause I love it

B-Boys… 
""As for—
As for me, see I just do how I love to do""
""Lovin' it, yo, yo, I'm lovin' it""
""I just do how I love to do""

B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b B-boys, I met you at the bus stop
I love it, I love it
We had nothing but the tuck shop
I love it, I love it
We had school ties, the sky and the hilltops
I love it, I love it
Now we’re all grown up and it’s still about Hip Hop
I love it, I love it

Lights Out,Drinking from the Sun,2012,"This whole world’s in a rush to be living plush, but never rich enough
Till that mirrors such a stranger we’re asking is it us?
Losing your vision, make one stupid decision
You’ve become the newest victim of the human condition
It’s a crying shame; honestly it’s a survival game
While we die in vein making somebody rich
Like we scared of taking that step
Every days just another that escaped us if we don’t make an affect
Back seat revolutionaries ain’t lions at heart
Even the slightest of sparks can light up the dark
And everybody wants a piece of the action
Like peace and relaxing became a niche for the deceased or the lacking
Success, pleasures of the flesh and beheld
Treasures and endless excess in which we measure ourselves
I’ve faith in my fam, so I can relate to the fans
Hope they understand how grateful I am
C'mon

We do it right here, right now, with my peers, my house
And fight here till the day we’re gone and rest in white clouds
Life here, life out, we're gonna die here with my doubts
Then as night nears we’re gonna do it till they turn the lights out
Right here, right now, with my peers, my house
And fight here till the day we’re gone and rest in white clouds
Life here, life out, we're gonna die here with my doubts
Then as night nears we’re gonna do it till they turn the lights out

And it starts with us, seeking an everlasting rush
Pharmaceutical market drugs, liquor and grass and dust
Murder, lust, self-worth, hurt and trust
Burden us like a curse till we return to dust
Keeping us on like we’re marching to the beat of a gong
Freedom is from our own hearts and those we leave the upon
Lingering on through the words that we sing in our songs
Even a strong foundation we could blink and it’s gone
So we carve out our marks and master our own path
In a castle of glass our heart where our homes are
Wars in our vein, that’s why we walk in the rain
Course if the name burns brighter it was forged in the flame
And you never get a break 'less you're dead or make fifty
And a pension ain’t a pay you resonate with me?
I’ve faith in my fam, so I can relate to the fans
I hope they understand how grateful I am
C'mon

We do it right here, right now, with my peers, my house
And fight here till the day we’re gone and rest in white clouds
Life here, life out, we're gonna die here with my doubts
Then as night nears we’re gonna do it till they turn the lights out
Right here, right now, with my peers, my house
And fight here till the day we’re gone and rest in white clouds
Life here, life out, we're gonna die here with my doubts
Then as night nears we’re gonna do it till they turn the lights out

C'mon
We won’t go, no we won’t go
No we won’t go, no we won’t go till it's lights out
We won’t go, no we won’t go

Living in Bunkers,Drinking from the Sun,2012,"When I came, I started like an arsonist to set a flame
Mastering this art, I'm everlasting when I pen my name
Darker like my letters stained markers on the head of Cain
Sharper than a marksmen with a target in my centre frame
A father, so my red I veins harboured by my said in name
Or rather with my other forefathers and genetic strain
If we ain't asking for respect or fame
With words as dope as marijuana, though it's hard to take what's said in vein
A splinter faction so we're carving up against the grain
Laughing at them grasping over stardom and a sense of claim
Hard to hang your head in shame rather than accept the blame
Own your hardships, we're only master when we shed the chains
Affect the game, cause and effect, check the change
Forget your name and not the part of it from where you came
Dangerous tracks like a scar where you inject the vein
Murdering your martyrs, I'm the harbinger to end the pain

Unforgiving staying hidden like we're living in bunkers
Whether you're in Sri Lanka or you live in Toronto
Dominican or Indian we're living like hunters
Whether you're in the Congo or live in Rwanda
What we doing Tek?
Staying hidden like we're living in bunkers
Whether you're in Sri Lanka or you live in Toronto
Dominican or Indian we're living like hunters
Whether you're in the Congo or live in Rwanda

I've got a cache of beats to make 'em get on the floor
Ranging from better than yours, to way better than yours
The heavy metal supporter leaving competitors floored
The most malevolent devil to ever tread on the shore
I'm a composer with a grudge ready to settle the score
And you're supposedly the one to wreck like never before?
Please, you 
a stooge like you're standing with Iggy
So please, bear with me like I'm standing with grizzlies
I'm a dark moon rising, bred in the 'burbs'
I'm far beyond the horizon, ahead of the curve
And now your head is on swerve like you're Linda Blair
 and
Painted eyes on my eyelids, they think I'm staring
Even when I'm sleeping, eye the angels
I sleep with demons, dine with angels
Screaming 'I'm the last one that your wanna start on
I'm sicker than lighting the next one off the last one

Unforgiving staying hidden like we’re living in bunkers
Whether you’re in Sri-Lanka or you live in Toronto
Dominican or Indian we’re living like hunters
Whether you’re in the Congo or live in Rwanda
What we doing Tek?
Unforgiving staying hidden like we’re living in bunkers
Whether you’re in Sri-Lanka or you live in Toronto
Dominican or Indian we’re living like hunters
Whether you’re in the Congo or live in Rwanda
(bulls-eye direct hit don't miss)
(rocking rocking with the best)
(bulls-eye direct hit don't miss)

Kick it up a little notch let the heat knock
For the number one soul brother next to Pete Rock
I'm from the gutter, came out my mother Tariq Trot
Doctor told me I was only human like the beatbox
I been sicker than dope friends in Detox
And been around plenty time like a G-Shock
I ain't doing the kind of my dimes my brother Keith got
It's Mr. Big Stuff taking Heavy D's spot
The same Rik Geezy, my man speak easy
Old soul, so ice cold, they can't unfreeze me... Listen
Streets need me so, I represent my town
Two one pound, where they keep enough shots to go around
Watch the crown, most underrated, none above it
You gotta love it, folks wanna hate it
In a 
P.A.N.A. mera Porsche four door
Heading down town riding 'round town, bumping Wurx shit

Unforgiving staying hidden like we’re living in bunkers
Whether you’re in Sri-Lanka or you live in Toronto
Dominican or Indian we’re living like hunters
Whether you’re in the Congo or live in Rwanda
What we doing Tek?
Unforgiving staying hidden like we’re living in bunkers
Whether you’re in Sri-Lanka or you live in Toronto
Dominican or Indian we’re living like hunters
Whether you’re in the Congo or live in Rwanda

We're staying hidden like we're living in bunkers

Now You're Gone,Drinking from the Sun,2012,"Now, now you're gone
And I feel so lonely
I don't know what to do

Now you’re gone, life moves on without you
You always wanted me to write a song about you
Where to begin? I caught her in a fling
They’ve been asking where you’ve been so I thought I’d fill them in
See there’s nothing that I wouldn’t put past you
When she got a lot of men that’s the harsh truth
You find the truth hard to swallow? Gotta ask you
Kind regards I’ve been doing well these past few
She’s a master with plans and a terrible feud
Leaving scars on a man if she’s ever pursued
Even after you’re damned and aware of the wound
Your beating heart's in her hand like the 
Temple of Doom
She’s a beast in disguise of a sweet song siren
That feasts on admirers so keep on driving
Unleashed like the virus, Calici, we’re blinded
And weak so she think she can keep on lying?
Enough is enough it's just counter productive
When trust is inductive to being so fucked with
And love is a high you can buy in a substance
Know what? Fuck this, it was always destructive
I’m a let you know, I’ve yet you go
You’ll never affect my mode get dressed and go
You better test the road so step and know
You're left alone to be another stepping stone, it goes

Now, now you're gone
Now you're gone
And I feel so lonely

Now, now you're gone
Now you're gone
And I feel so lonely
I don't know what to do

She slept on the couch for about four days or so
Then left like a southpaw, bout four days ago
I’m blessed with a mouth than can outtalk ASIO
But from this fallout my poor mouth couldn’t save me so
Now I spend my days alone, playing me some Maseo
Telephone messages; I doubt she ever plays ‘em though
CD on the stereo, TV on the radio
I was a lover, but the love it couldn’t save me though
Baby don’t play me, don’t break me, yo save me
Don’t make me go crazy, like saying don’t taze me bro
Maybe you’re right, and it’s all for the best
And maybe you’re right, but I’m all you’ll have left
When the best friends head for the S bend
Less than zero, you’ll need me like a western hero
You used to use my chest as a pillow, paro
Now my heart is just a target for an arrow
[Chorus: Kenny Van Ordstrand & 
Suffa

Now, now you're gone
Now you're gone
And I feel so lonely
I don't know what to do
Now, now you're gone
Now you're gone
And I feel so lonely
I don't know what to do

Every breath you take is filling the
Lungs that hug the heart that’s killing me
Feelings Suffa foster for her
Lost her, not my lover, Billie Jean
So pretty please, to a girl so pretty, please
You really need to not make me crawl like a millipede
Are you feeling the fool? Maybe you’re not fulfilling me
But silly me, I’m feeling this Philly’s all I really need like
[Chorus: Kenny Van Ordstrand & 
Suffa

Now, now you're gone
Now you're gone
And I feel so lonely
I don't know what to do
Now, now you're gone
Now you're gone
And I feel so lonely
I don't know what to do

Rattling The Keys To The Kingdom,Drinking from the Sun,2012,"We came and we conquered, they praying to poppa
They claiming they want to, they really don't want to
You ain't maiming a monster so don't bother with offers
Till the day that I die, I ain't stepping aside for one of you
We came and we conquered, they praying to poppa
They claiming they want to, they really don't want to
You ain't maiming a monster so don't bother with offers
Till the day that I die, I ain't stepping aside for one of you

Check, When I start breathing heavily, I scar the beat and melody
They said that we dreaming we'll keep reaching till we leaving heavenly
The key to freedoms said to be, release and leave the memory
Think you offended me? Please, with critics like these who needs an enemy?
Indeed a breed of pedigree beast unleashing speech telepathy
Here to bleed the industry of its diseased and evil effigy
Demons, thieving, greed and revelry, we're in need and seeking remedy
But it seems to stay ten feet ahead of me like a centipede
I'm a train upon a track, I'm a flame upon a match
Ain't straying from my place I want my face upon the map
I'm the weight upon your back, I'm a razor on your lap
We came to conquer, stage and opera, fade it onto black
Now hush, hear the voice, so addicted to the
Rush to fill the void, dismissing everything we love
To feel joy, build it up then we
Crush, kill, destroy

We came and we conquered, they praying to poppa
They claiming they want to, they really don't want to
You ain't maiming a monster so don't bother with offers
Till the day that I die, I ain't stepping aside for one of you

You ain't maiming a monster so don't bother with offers
Till the day that I die, I ain't stepping aside for one of you

I go bananas every time, mind blown Nirvana, Nevermind
They need some ketamine to calm us, harness the darkness every line
Till I been enlightened I'm leaving 'em terrified
Like Bin Laden been hiding under their bed every night they go beddy-bye
Fat as the fattest Federline, fat as that cat post Brittney
Madness that is a friend of mine, rappers get mashed so quickly
War comes, hear the roar from the raw drums, beat your poor son just from the boredom
Jump up, but you're stunned, dumb struck, you're done like Young Buck post Fifty
We claw at the morons and pour on the soothing hooks on heaters
Like them pouring the Boron on core on the shore of Fukushima
They adore the recordings and we lording it over them
Think we're joking? Then we're going door to door with some Dobermans
No DMX, they thinking they got me pegged like BMX
But ain't seeing T or X, Briggs, Hons, Debris or Vents
We the best, no Khaled
We the best like Ali, Muhammad

We came and we conquered, they praying to poppa
They claiming they want to, they really don't want to
You ain't maiming a monster so don't bother with offers
Till the day that I die, I ain't stepping aside for one of you
We came and we conquered, they praying to poppa
They claiming they want to, they really don't want to
You ain't maiming a monster so don't bother with offers
Till the day that I die, I ain't stepping aside for one of you

Rattling the keys to the kingdom
""Let me tell you what it's all about""
""Turn this underground rap thing to my kingdom""

Shredding the Balloon,Drinking from the Sun,2012,"As we proceed (as we proceed)
To give you what you need (to give you what you need)
As we proceed (as we proceed)
To give you what you need (give you what you need)

Like we always do about this time
, ink lines for the sick rhyme inclined
It’s grimy shit but naught that can’t be fixed with a little bit of spitshine
Big time like Frankie in Vegas, inspiring like Ali and Frazier
Spit it out till we spilling out on to the street start a party up with our neighbours
I’d rather be part of your playlist, than ever be part of the A-list
Harness the energy, heart of a pedigree with the scars of a sadist
I go so hard on the pavement; I go so far with my statements
That I don’t know where they end and where I start it’s all part of game it’s
The farthest I’ve came since I started to play it, I spar with these artists, the heartless and brainless
We’re harnessed by chains that are hard to escape and you change then they label us bastards or traitors
They’re charlatans, they’re haters, they start on us but they’re fake as
Our parliament, but don’t be disheartened by them pardon their failures
If we don’t forgive our enemies, we’ll crawl the walls like centipedes
Burn our energy like fossil fuels and fuel our own damn effigy
And we’ll all burn like Hennessey, so keep on then and step with me
John Lennon let it be
, 
dead the beef like abattoirs
, before these scavengers tear at me

I’ve been waiting to come back
Like where the hell is the show?
Like a balloon on a thumbtack
Getting ready to blow
I’ve been waiting to come back
Like where the hell is the show?
Like a balloon on a thumbtack
Getting ready to blow

And it might blow up but it won’t go pop
And it might blow up but it won’t burst
She said she might grow old but she won’t grow up
Well she might, but only if I go first
She wears her heart on her sleeve like; she’s wearing a patch on her shoulder
It’s not a matter of whether I can catch her, more a matter of whether I can hold her
She thinks out loud she’s got me; she laughs with her whole body
I think about how she got it all figured out and wonder why she’d even want me?
Each night I find it’s the same ole, when I crawl inside in the evening
I lie down next to an angel; fall asleep and fly with my demons
They say don’t live in the past and live each day like it was your last but
I’d rather live each moment like it was my first, take it slow and sip from the glass
Savour the moment, spit vicious bars then pray for opponents
Sounds so serious don’t it? But I’m not concerned with a thing
This is book three, Tolkien, Return of the King
The kings have arrived; we drink from the sky
We fall from all ‘cause we think we can fly
But our wings have been tied, and the whinging and lies
Have me I’m wishing that I could bridge the divide
You living the life? In the blink of an eye
The shine of the bling and the rims that you ride
Can all disappear so live for the rhyme
Not material things your gift can provide

I’ve been waiting to come back
Like where the hell is the show?
Like a balloon on a thumbtack
Getting ready to blow
I’ve been waiting to come back
Like where the hell is the show?
Like a balloon on a thumbtack
I’m getting ready now, I’m getting ready

Since 
State of the Art
 we’ve stayed in the yard just waiting to start this shit all over
Laying in bars for a day-and-a-half, had to switch from gin to soda
Then by like mid-October, record was six months over-
Due and I‘m like, ""Dude, what you expect? I’m only three months sober""
Coming up turning tree trunks over, running up burning divas, posers
Run amok till the sun is up or till one of us # live la vida loca
I’m gonna roll until I fold, like I got a hold of Propafol
So beautiful to know you all but for now, peace, I’m over
And out

I don't wanna go, go, but I gotta go, go, go
We won’t go, no, we won’t go
I don't wanna go, go, but I gotta go, go, go
No, we won’t go, no, we won’t go, no
I don't wanna go, go, but I gotta go, go, go
We won’t go, no, we won’t go
I don't wanna go, go, but I gotta go, go, go
No, we won’t go, no, we won’t go, no

Speaking In Tongues,Drinking from the Sun,2012,"Another war, another martyr revered
Passed the fear from their fathers then it’s lasting for years
Bullets don’t discriminate the skin colour they pierce
We speak the same language brother; love, laughter and tears
Refugees trading death for a prison
While some base a set of opinions on race, sex or religion
(C’mon) Enough day-to-day stress of just living
Without giving a fuck if they’re hated just 'cause they different
Let’s do it under the name of the love that became lost
Dress it up how you want, we’re cut from the same cloth
Scars of hate, frowns stitched to our faces
Can’t escape the cage we forge, we’ve got bars to break
For those living every bit of the struggle
Given to hustle, tryna figure how they fit in the puzzle
And right now we’re in pieces and peace is the people as one
Till then we’re treated like we’re speaking in tongues, so here we come

I am, you are, we are one
We’re two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun
We be the left hand, right hand, right man?
But sometimes it seems like we’re speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum
I am, you are, we are one
We’re two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun
We be the left hand, right hand, right man?
But sometimes it seems like we’re speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum

Media is teaching the young, debate about belief in the one
Can make an eight-year soldier fall asleep with a gun
While tax man's hands deep in your funds, reaping your ones
Money tight like we tweaking the drums it’s like we speaking in tongues
But no book burnings or church sermons
I surf currents, my words burn like a dirt furnace
Confusion leads and anguish sells
But this music succeeds where even language fails
To convey free honest expression
It’s a problem trying to get people to acknowledge progression
My goal is to leave a lasting iconic impression
Controlling crowds like demonic possession and ain’t no time to invest in
Biting the hand that created the platform
Attaching pseudo patriotic crap to a rap song
Hoods and 2na try to unify the people as one
And yet we’re treated like we’re speaking in tongues, so here we come

I am, you are, we are one
We’re two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun
We be the left hand, right hand, right man?
But sometimes it seems like we’re speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum
I am, you are, we are one
We’re two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun
We be the left hand, right hand, right man?
But sometimes it seems like we’re speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum

I would never
Hate someone for the way that they layin' with someone else
(And if you do) The blame comes from the weight of the way that you see yourself
Take some of the weight off your plate by taking the hate away
And then maybe you’ll make your way to start loving yourself
Fear’s a cancer, logic is a countermeasure
A property that you can’t count or measure
I got a problem with people who got a problem with
The way that other people wanna live (That’s their prerogative)
They’re mad at how you love, where your prayers are going
Their anger’s like a drug, they’re mad at where you from
But fuck a redneck checking if your visa’s valid
They act like pigs and chickens, I’m sick of Caesar salad
So we seize the mallet and we swing on the ignorant
Can’t speak our language? Then we’ll see if you can sing in it
Hoods and 2na try to unify the people as one
And yet we’re treated like we’re speaking in tongues, so here we come

I am, you are, we are one
We’re two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun
We be the left hand, right hand, right man?
But sometimes it seems like we’re speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum
I am, you are, we are one
We’re two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun
We be the left hand, right hand, right man?
But sometimes it seems like we’re speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum

They pick me up just to pull me down
March to different drums, come from all around
It’s like we’re speaking in tongues
It’s like we’re speaking in tongues
They pick me up just to pull me down
March to different drums, come from all around
It’s like we’re speaking in tongues
It’s like we’re speaking in tongues
It’s like we’re speaking in tongues

I am, you are, we are one
We’re two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun
We be the left hand, right hand, right man?
But sometimes it seems like we’re speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum

The Thirst Pt. 1,Drinking from the Sun,2012,"It’s been a while since we last touched bases
Ever since ‘State of the Art’ rushed playlists
Been around the globe a couple of times
Sang in a thousand homes but none of them mine
Played a thousand shows under the lights
And walked on mountain roads touching the sky
Rocked foreign shores where I swore I had no name
That meant more than the awards and accolades
Like I can’t believe we made our calling
We’ve barely stopped to breathe and take it all in
It’s got a hold on me the day I fold and leave
It’s gonna seem like I’m falling
And I buried two friends, lost touch with some others
Split with my girl, found love with another
For every road the world I know gets smaller
Came home to find my son had grown a head taller",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-the-thirst-pt-1-lyrics
The Thirst Pt. 2,Drinking from the Sun,2012,"""As sure as the sun rises in the east, it also sets in the west.""
""The sun is much more than a giant light bulb. There are other forces at work in the sun""
""The sun is a sphere of hot, seething gas's, and surges of radiation.""
""The sun is so large, it would take a-hundred-and-nine earths strung end to end to equal its diameter.""
""How do you catch a piece of the sun?""
""Hilltop Hoods""
""And then the sun. We'll expect a connection to the sun.""

Well Drinking from the Sun is kind of like–it’s a metaphor that you know… we’re from an underground culture that’s kind of risen up into the limelight so we’re sort of from down below drinking from what’s coming above",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-the-thirst-pt-2-lyrics
The Thirst Pt. 3,Drinking from the Sun,2012,"What up Vents?
Funkoars
Adfu
What up Briggs?
Golden Era, check

We were gone so long, spreading our wings, they'd thought we'd broken up
Thought I only closed my eyes for a second, next thing I've woken up
They said we thought we'd let you sleep in, you looked at peace and
I was like you should have spoken up
All this time trying to sober up
Swore a crowd not a Crown would be the next thing I opened up
Saw I was so corrupt, I wasn't coping but
Seeing friends going down, had me choking up
Plus a drunk nearly killed Debris in a car that crashed
Left us a DJ who had to start from scratch
So I arched my back, stretched my shoulders
Said let's shed this wretched coldness
Drink from the sun and swallow the heat
Just to spit it out, and have 'em follow the beat
What we gotta give this crowd's something of another class
March till the sun is down and we're walking under stars

""They were recording enough music for two albums, that was premeditated
They, they weren't just like, 'let's make a record and we'll pick the best ten or twelve songs'
It was from day one, 'we're making two albums'""",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-the-thirst-pt-3-lyrics
The Underground,Drinking from the Sun,2012,"We went from spitting jams to fifty fans in a little cramped room
A shoebox you couldn’t fit a shoe in to touring
Switzerland with my man in a mini-van
Being the man of the minute can happen in a minute man
And it’s funny, I’ve seen buddies that I trust turn away
‘Cause money can’t buy you love but it can earn you hate
And none of you gave a fuck till the movement went large
Now every crew is making music, every dude has got bars
Now every half-arse bar fly up in the bar rhymes
We sit about, spitting ‘bout the dark and the hard times
But got perspective on the fighting for the crowns and such
When we encountered and old pal who had been down on his luck
In some Volleys pushing trolleys eating soup from a tin
My girls like ""golly, man these pollie's aren’t improving a thing""
Well swap your worries for some Bolly, swap your suit for some wings
And fly with us, we light it up and it’s a beautiful thing

They exploded the underground
They say it’s gonna happen, the underground
I heard they exploded the underground
They say it’s gonna happen, the underground

That’s where I started at, the days of Walkman’s and starter hats
The open mic nights mastering the art of rap
We man made, underground like an artifact
We don’t need to worry when the market crash
I’m from the bottom, bottom of new Scotland
Planted all my seeds watered them then watched it blossom
Then they try to tell me over time we’d be forgotten, rotten
Thinking that you’re gonna keep me boxed in? Nonsense
Hilltop and Class rock till your noggins nodding
You can walk in my shoes but never fit in my jeans
I do this with no option till my body’s old and rotten and exhausted, keep it going ‘cause I’m living my dream
Till the grave we’ll spit the pain and, when it comes to picture painting
We might be the illest rated with the visuals illustrated
That’s ill communication, therapy for life without the rehabilitation, keep waiting I’m about to blow up

They exploded the underground
They say it’s gonna happen, the underground
I heard they exploded the underground
They say it’s gonna happen, the underground

We about to blow it up, but we all started this as amateur
Carving out a path was a hardship for the traveller
It said that raps a façade, you’ll never manage it
In these parts, I guess it’s our scars that give us character
We misfits and slackers, at risk kids or hackers
With a wish list, sick of doing six shifts at Macca’s
From listeners to rappers, prestigious to hapless
I don’t need a gift to know that this shit is backwards
We’re done officially another visionary
Will lights the flame, write their name in their sweat, blood and infamy
It’s gutter symphony fuck the industry
Let them come, we’re the ones carving history
So we rhyme 
for the hurting, poor hard working for
International heard applaud to local suburban tour
Y’all gave a purpose for the roar when the curtains draw
Furthermore ask yourself what you’re searching for?

""I'm about to blow up""
""The underground""

Follow me to a place I like to go
Liner notes are signposts to find that which lies below
Born in eighty-eight so I came in late
To find for the first time in life I felt right at home
Through the growing pains and hostile take overs
People trying to put us down like Beethoven
We stayed strong and remained focused
Until they had no other choice but to stand up and take notice
Never thought what I wrote on a page back in the day
Would ever have me catching a plane
Or rapping up on a stage
Staring out at the crowd in amazement
Thinking back on the days when
We were confined to the limitations of the basement
The subterranean kids became the main event
I pay respect to those who spent days laying foundations
Countdown to detonation (
I'm about to blow up
)

They exploded the underground
They say it’s gonna happen, the underground
I heard they exploded the underground
They say it’s gonna happen, the underground",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-the-underground-lyrics

You gotta start it with a cliché, you know what I'm sayin'?
Like...

Time moves a little slower here
The paint peels, 'cause the summers here are so severe
And we're nowhere near nowhere you would know of
Locals here ride, they show up just to show off
Old men take a load off, just to watch the day go by
Philosophising with their friends like they're Plato
They prophecise on the bench by the main road, right
They got advice; I’m like 'Ayo, if you say so guys'
But what do they know, Fox News got 'em lit
They’re shook, 'cause fundamentalist the new communist
Old girl with her shopping list clutch her handbag close
I’m like 'Damn, ma'am; Dan, this old bag has jokes'
'Cause I'm a gentleman, but then again most of us are

It gets so quiet at night
Like martial law took a hold y'all, '55

Time moves a little slower here
A day feels like a week, a week it feels like it could go a year
And we're nowhere near nothing, man it's so true
I don't tell 'em where I'm from, I tell 'em where I'm close to
And I can go through an atlas and show you on a map but
You'd still look at me sideways and treat me like I'm backwards
But that's just fine, it so happens I'm
Happy living in a city that is trapped in time
While you're lined up in traffic I'm
Not panicked 'bout transit, I'm back in time
For a TV dinner and an early night
'Cause we get dressed to travel, got an early flight
Been doing laps of the earth while doing laps of the sun
Tryna put where I'm at on the map cause where I'm from
We never get a mention
, but all that and then some
Once again, the old men on the bench hum

""And across the country, they came in waves. Thousands upon thousands of flying discs descending from the planet Mars.""

Cosby Sweater Restrung,"Drinking from the Sun, Walking Under Stars Restrung",2016,"Watch me do my thing, get
Lost into my scene, yeah
Hot like New Orleans in
Cosby crew and jeans, yeah

They’re not awakened, stare a lot and vacant
Living in conditions of the modern matrix
Only bare arms when I’m proper naked
Only point I made with a bullet was on paper
Ain’t here to fight some dude or fuck around with his spouse
Rather light your mood and burn it down with the house
Get you hyped from the groove on account of the bounce
And looking like Tom Cruise, up and down on a couch
Status never mattered ever, act however
Like Christine Aguilera, just let yourself go
Mad at Pressure, an endeavour that is better left
Pristine track and record to let you all know
That we would be kings even homeless
Building these kingdoms our own, just
Slap a rapper like Solange Knowles
Till they’re gathering, they no longer matter like a black hole

And it's all good

I'ma step up every chance when I rumble
They all call me champ of the jungle, it’s fitting
I'ma get drunk and dance like your uncle
'Til I'm all hands like your uncle, I’m kidding
The venomous inventor, when I enter then it's over
When I’m spitting venom I’m as generous as Oprah
You get a scar, you get a scar, you get a scar
Me? Drunk in the back of a rental car
Pat Benatar, brah, love’s a battlefield
Here to get you out your seat like a battle drill
I’m in the saddle still, a little saddle sore
Smash you out the stratosphere, flashy as a matador
When I’m dressed like Theo’s dad
In a Coogi listening to Kool G Rap
I won’t beat around the bush like a seventies porn
I’ll make you wish that you’d never been born and it’s all good

And it's all good
And it's all good
And it's all good
And it's all good

Take a ride on the wild side of this alley
We can fire up the night like Prince Harry
Fuck the high life, we can vibe like
We got white lines hanging from behind like we’re just married
I’ll turn the art form into a blood sport
And make pea soup out of a pea-brain
They wanna run these streets like parkour?

Drinking From The Sun Restrung,"Drinking from the Sun, Walking Under Stars Restrung",2016,"I lay down my music ten feet from where I lay down
Immersed in them beats, short breaks turned to breakdowns
‘Cause when you work where you sleep, you don’t sleep
‘Cause you work on them beats till it hurts then you creep
Into bed and wake her from her sleep, and she’s hurt
‘Cause she worked through the week and hasn’t heard not a word nor a peep
From the jerk that she keeps in her heart
That she forgives when he nurse her to sleep, word it’s deep
Yo, when I peel them lids back and emerge from my sleep
I feel so big that I could make a shirt from my sheet
A crown from a church steeple, two jeeps for my sneaks
So people worship this creep as I surf down the street
I’m the surgeon of beats, your girl purrs when I speak
We rehearse in a church to a circus of freaks
We the last ones to lay down, first on our feet
So stay down or get hurt by what lurks in the deep
Free the perps from the police, we disturbing the peace
We flood the streets like a water main burst and released
A merciless beast with a thirst for the feast
Man we treat every meal like it’s our first in a week
We dispersing the weak, I’m the person to beat
Man I’m unbeatable; I can beat a person for weeks
We disturbed, we the freaks, we the ones you don’t listen to
Drinking from the sun, now son we’re the ones dissing you

And we don’t (ever stop), we won’t (let it drop)
Lad-dah-di-da-dah
We don’t (ever stop), and we won’t (insult ya)
Let the vultures at the counter-culture
Now we don’t (ever stop), and we won’t (ever run)
Lad-dah-di-da-dah
We move mountains and drink from the sun

We’re timeless like riders on the storm
Survivors like the light that rises in the dawn
If crisis makes fighters of the pawns
We rise up through the night as lifeless and we’re born
Fight in my heart, suicide with my art
Till I depart I’m a write until I light up the dark
These are battle songs that lift you from your catatonic fixture
And I can walk on water but I stagger on the liquor
This ain’t a Saturday sport or matinee talk
With throw away sentences like the magistrates’ court
Scratch that, now hear me out, attacks don’t give me doubt
I drop a powerhouse track black the city out
And when we lose it let the mood of music reach us
Coming through the tunes that free us, revolution through your speakers
The third rock never stops, the world turns
Eyes glued to the clock as we watch the world burn

And we don’t (ever stop), we won’t (let it drop)
Lad-dah-di-da-dah
We don’t (ever stop), and we won’t (insult ya)
Let the vultures at the counter-culture
Now we don’t (ever stop), and we won’t (ever run)
Lad-dah-di-da-dah
We move mountains and drink from the sun

Renegades whenever on centre stage
That’s my sweat upon the letters I bled on the pen and page
C’mon, so what’s your rhyming worth? Better get a lawyer ‘cause
I could crucify your verse just to get a point across
We’ve been refining and grinding till late night
Why? ‘Cause even stars lose their shine in the day light
Linked as one just think what we’ll become
It’s begun and won’t stop till we’re drinking from the sun",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-drinking-from-the-sun-restrung-lyrics
Higher,"Drinking from the Sun, Walking Under Stars Restrung",2015,"Life tempo unsustainable
Try memo all my days in full
Time encroach till I can’t escape it all
Or die in the hope of the unobtainable
Drivin' this road's like lucid dreamin'
Sleep through the daytime, fly through the evening
If idol dreaming give life to my demons
Then please don't wake me, I'll die while I'm sleepin'
Man I swore I never been here before
This tour's like a storm, blew me up on the shore
Don't know if I'm coming or going or who's runnin' this show
And whether it's curtains or encore
And everyday I spend in space and dimension
Feelin' like I snap so frayed from the tension
Breaking the connection, chasing my redemption
Looking in the wrong place for perfection
I brought a piece of the road into the peace of our home
You the cornerstone of every bit of peace that I've known
But this fever to roam, I can't leave it alone
It claws at my flesh and it's deep in my bones
The music brought me back to life
But it was you that wore the sacrifice
Lost time, lost sleep, lost point of view
Lost high, lost me, lost all but you

If we go higher
Tryna tame the clouds
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oo
Lost in the night the
Only way is down
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oo
Still we go higher
Tryna sate this thirst
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oo
Till we fly into the sun
And fall in flames to Earth
Earth, Earth
Ooo-ooo-oo

Higher
Higher
Ooooh

She used to say
""You make me wanna run to you
I'm so proud of your accomplishments""
Looked at me like I had hung the moon
Now she looks at me like I'm blockin' it
'Cause when you're deep on a tour, no rest
Not feeling human, like you failed the Turing test
She don't want you to bounce too soon, man
I feel like Andy Kaufman, the Man on the Moon, and
When I'm feelin' half-human
I'm still hard to kill like Vents and Rasputin
And when life put the boot in
You gotta hit 'em with the fire, Street Fighter, Hadouken
Twenty-four-seven ride the clouds on a seven-four-seven
Lights out? Damn
I’ve never felt more present than I have right now
Shook to life by the landing gear
Inflight radio playin' Chandelier
Now I'm standin' here with no standing room
Waiting on an old man to grab a bag or two
Then he tipped his hat and asked what I do
I said 'dude this is what I do'
And I'ma be consumed by all this so called fun
I'ma burn up soon tryna touch the sun

If we go higher
Tryna tame the clouds
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oo
Lost in the night the
Only way is down
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oo
Still we go higher
Tryna sate this thirst
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oo

I Love It Restrung,"Drinking from the Sun, Walking Under Stars Restrung",2016,"I'm wondering where the day went
The clouds had me shrouded and grey but
I'm still out pounding the pavement but
Drowning the hurt by pounding rounds in brown paper
Founded a label now I'm drowning in paperwork
But now the crew I'm down with found an escape from work
And I love it cause that's what your hard work gets you
My heart bursts through my chest I'm rescue
So forget what the rest do
I'm blessed to, do it with two of who are the best to do it
Do I love it?

Look at our goals
If we never stood in the cold we wouldn't evolve
Use to put my crooked foot in what I couldn't resolve
But took control now hard work is good for the soul
And I love it
Growing through life and stress
Knowing the fight is just half of self-imposing our righteousness
Contract owners and licenses, showbiz and lights, we're just
Searching for the moment of pricelessness

B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b boys I met you at the bus stop
We had nothing but the tuck shop
We had school ties, the sky and the hilltops
Now we’ve all grown up and it’s still about the hip-hop
I love it I love it

Five days deep in the booth then spent Friday leaping through loops
Then spent the weekend Sideways seeking the truth
And I won't lie they keep me on my toes these days
But I won't lie hey I beat him with the flow for days
Cause I love it
A pen and pad is like a red rag to a bull
I see red like Leningrad
Raising the crowd from a vacant lot, like how?
Like raising the brow on the face of God right? Right now

And I love it
A life with no regret
No success without a price that owes a debt
I roll the dice and despite the road ahead
Hope that in the a crisis I might just know the ledge
But I love it like take away beer
Then a sunset to lay away your day to day fears
See haters underrate us but this status takes years
And it ain't where we at it's how we made it right here

B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b boys I met you at the bus stop
We had nothing but the tuck shop
We had school ties the sky and the hilltops
Now we're all grown up and it’s still about hip-hop
I love it I love it

And we can be at a hotel worst part of town
And support act we ain't half as loud
But twice as nice you can ask the crowd
And we passing out at the departure lounge
And I love it I hug the road
Like an old friend like the world won't revolve
Unless we're rolling on it, it holds them on it
It's soul melodic, and oh they want it
Come on

I love it
We’re chasing the dream
Everyday a new place new faces and scene
Living out of suitcase few place in between
There's been very few days I loose faith in my team
Got love far from home through the winter and summer
No matter how hard the road or the distance we cover
Even bitter when I'm missing my significant other
But wouldn't trade it for the world, given another
Cause I love it

B-boys
I ask for, I ask for dc, I just knew how I love to do
I’m just loving it, yeah, yeah, another day
Yeah, I just knew how I love to do

B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b boys I met you at the bus stop
I love it I love it
We had nothing but the tuck shop
I love it I love it
We had school ties the skies and the hilltops
I love it I love it
Now I've grown up and it’s still about the hip-hop

I’m A Ghost Restrung,"Drinking from the Sun, Walking Under Stars Restrung",2016,"Come on

Two sheets to the wind in a taxi
Two feet to the wind in the backseat
Two beeps to the car in front of us
Or one of us ending up wrapped round the chassis
Thinking ‘bout these rhymes, and what they gave me
Sounds out this world, but a microphone and
Two turntables saved me
Took me ‘round the world and bought me a home and
I’ve seen all these other crew's bank too
Not knowing all the ways people helped ‘em
Might not ever get a damn thank you
But they’re sure ‘nough gonna get a you’re welcome
Matter fact, I ain’t leaving, I was here first and
I don’t believe them, I was here bursting
Listening to Primo and Chino and Thirstin
And missing out on being there for people in person
'Cause we don’t sleep when we’re working
We don’t bleed when we’re hurting
We wear our heart on our sleeve and I’m certain
That we’ll feel the burden till we call it curtains, you feel me?
Do you feel me?
This that light inside the core that can blind with its force
It’s the writing on the wall; light it up on the porch
It’s nineteen ninety-four, five mic’s in The Source
It’s a mighty; mighty roar from the crowd and of course
It’s this
Do you feel me?

Went from going through quotes in the liners
To being known from the shows on the fliers
Playing packed rooms, heading to the back room
To cool down my face with some ice from the rider
Looking out to a crowd full of lighters
And the day those lights don’t inspire us
You’ll see me walking out
I’m a ghost, I’m gone

Two sheets on a surface of water
Loose-leaf writing worthless and torn up
If I could do these words justice
You’d see how much it’s worth that I fought for
Every kid that never got one mention
Every little bit of love or affection
I’m done with pretending the sun is descending
And all good things must come to an ending
'Cause I swore to the day this is
Nothing more than a flawed entertainment biz
And if I walk away with nothing well let me tell you something
That’s fucking more than I came here with
You feel me?
Do you feel me?
And I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t grateful
For my life for my friends and for the faithful
It’s been a ride but there’s been a few times that I’d thought I’d lose sight when the effort was so painful
But rap gave me such inspired dreams
In fact maybe touched my life when things
Got a little crazy and nobody would pay me the ends that plainly justified the means
At last I can see we’ve all been blind
It’s hard to believe that all this time
That I wore my heart on my sleeve for this art and the scene
Gonna be hard when I leave it all behind
You feel me?
Do you feel me?

I’m a ghost, I’m gone

Low winter sun, light the dawn in gold
I'm a ghost, I'm gone
Though when it’s done night is on us all
I'm a ghost, I'm gone
Nowhere to run, writings on the wall
I'm a ghost, I'm gone
So when it come, rise before we fall
I'm a ghost, I'm gone
Low winter sun, light the dawn in gold
I'm a ghost, I'm gone
Broken and done dying on us all
I'm a ghost, I'm gone
Nowhere to run, writings on the wall
I'm a ghost, I'm gone
So when it comes, rise, rise, before we fall

Lights Out Restrung,"Drinking from the Sun, Walking Under Stars Restrung",2016,"This whole world’s in a rush to be living plush, but never rich enough
Till that mirrors such a stranger we’re asking is it us?
Losing your vision, make one stupid decision
You’ve become the newest victim of the human condition
It’s a crying shame; honestly it’s a survival game
While we die in vein making somebody rich
Like we scared of taking that step
Every days just another that escaped us if we don’t make an affect
Back seat revolutionaries ain’t lions at heart
Even the slightest of sparks can light up the dark
And everybody wants a piece of the action
Like peace and relaxing became a niche for the deceased or the lacking
Success, pleasures of the flesh and beheld
Treasures and endless excess in which we measure ourselves
I’ve faith in my fam, so I can relate to the fans
Hope they understand how grateful I am
C'mon

We do it right here, right now, with my peers, my house
And fight here till the day we’re gone and rest in white clouds
Life here, life out, we're gonna die here with my doubts
Then as night nears we’re gonna do it till they turn the lights out
Right here, right now, with my peers, my house
And fight here till the day we’re gone and rest in white clouds
Life here, life out, we're gonna die here with my doubts
Then as night nears we’re gonna do it till they turn the lights out

And it starts with us, seeking an everlasting rush
Pharmaceutical market drugs, liquor and grass and dust
Murder, lust, self-worth, hurt and trust
Burden us like a curse till we return to dust
Keeping us on like we’re marching to the beat of a gong
Freedom is from our own hearts and those we leave the upon
Lingering on through the words that we sing in our songs
Even a strong foundation we could blink and it’s gone
So we carve out our marks and master our own path
In a castle of glass our heart where our homes are
Wars in our vein, that’s why we walk in the rain
Course if the name burns brighter it was forged in the flame
And you never get a break 'less you're dead or make fifty
And a pension ain’t a pay you resonate with me?
I’ve faith in my fam, so I can relate to the fans
I hope they understand how grateful I am
C'mon

We do it right here, right now, with my peers, my house
And fight here till the day we’re gone and rest in white clouds
Life here, life out, we're gonna die here with my doubts
Then as night nears we’re gonna do it till they turn the lights out
Right here, right now, with my peers, my house
And fight here till the day we’re gone and rest in white clouds
Life here, life out, we're gonna die here with my doubts

Yeah, y-ye-y-yeah
Yeah, y-ye-y-yeah

We came and we conquered, they praying to poppa
They claiming they want to, they really don't want to
You ain't maiming a monster so don't bother with offers
Till the day that I die, I ain't stepping aside for one of you
We came and we conquered, they praying to poppa
They claiming they want to, they really don't want to
You ain't maiming a monster so don't bother with offers
Till the day that I die, I ain't stepping aside for one of you

Check, When I start breathing heavily, I scar the beat and melody
They said that we dreaming we'll keep reaching till we leaving heavenly
The key to freedoms said to be, release and leave the memory
Think you offended me? Please, with critics like these who needs an enemy?
Indeed a breed of pedigree beast unleashing speech telepathy
Here to bleed the industry of its diseased and evil effigy
Demons, thieving, greed and revelry, we're in need and seeking remedy
But it seems to stay ten feet ahead of me like a centipede
I'm a train upon a track, I'm a flame upon a match
Ain't straying from my place I want my face upon the map
I'm the weight upon your back, I'm a razor on your lap
We came to conquer, stage and opera, fade it onto black
Now hush, hear the voice, so addicted to the
Rush to fill the void, dismissing everything we love
To feel joy, build it up then we
Crush, kill, destroy

We came and we conquered, they praying to poppa

They claiming they want to, they really don't want to
You ain't maiming a monster so don't bother with offers
Till the day that I die, I ain't stepping aside for one of you

I go bananas every time, mind blown Nirvana, Nevermind
They need some ketamine to calm us, harness the darkness every line
Till I been enlightened I'm leaving 'em terrified
Like Bin Laden been hiding under their bed every night they go beddy-bye
Fat as the fattest Federline, fat as that cat post Brittney
Madness that is a friend of mine, rappers get mashed so quickly
War comes, hear the roar from the raw drums, beat your poor son just from the boredom
Jump up, but you're stunned, dumb struck, you're done like Young Buck post Fifty
We claw at the morons, and pour on the soothing hooks on heaters
Like them pouring the Boron on core on the shore of Fukushima
They adore the recordings and we lording it over them
Think we're joking? Then we're going door to door with some Dobermans
No DMX, they thinking they got me pegged like BMX
But ain't seeing T or X, Briggs, Hons, Debris or Vents
We the best, no Khaled
We the best like Ali, Muhammad

We came and we conquered, they praying to poppa
They claiming they want to, they really don't want to
You ain't maiming a monster so don't bother with offers
Till the day that I die, I ain't stepping aside for one of you
We came and we conquered, they praying to poppa
They claiming they want to, they really don't want to
You ain't maiming a monster so don't bother with offers
Till the day that I die, I ain't stepping aside for one of you

Rattling the keys
Rattling the keys
Rattling the keys to the kingdom
Let me tell you want's all about
Return this under ground rattling to my kingdom

As we proceed (as we pro-) to get you what you need (get you what you need)

Like we always do about this time, ink lines for the sick rhyme inclined
It’s grimy shit but naught that can’t be fixed with a little bit of spitshine
Big time like Frankie in Vegas, inspiring like Ali and Frazier
Spit it out till we spilling out on to the street start a party up with our neighbours
I’d rather be part of your playlist, than ever be part of the A-list
Harness the energy, heart of a pedigree with the scars of a sadist
I go so hard on the pavement; I go so far with my statements
That I don’t know where they end and where I start it’s all part of game it’s
The farthest I’ve came since I started to play it, I spar with these artists, the heartless and brainless
We’re harnessed by chains that are hard to escape and you change then they label us bastards or traitors
They’re charlatans, they’re haters, they start on us but they’re fake as
Our parliament, but don’t be disheartened by them pardon their failures
If we don’t forgive our enemies, we’ll crawl the walls like centipedes
Burn our energy like fossil fuels and fuel our own damn effigy
And we’ll all burn like Hennessey, so keep on then and step with me
John Lennon let it be, dead the beef like abattoirs, before these scavengers tear at me

I’ve been waiting to come back
Like where the hell is the show?
Like a balloon on a thumbtack
Getting ready to blow
I’ve been waiting to come back
Like where the hell is the show?
Like a balloon on a thumbtack
Getting ready to blow

And it might blow up but it won’t go pop
And it might blow up but it won’t burst
She said she might grow old but she won’t grow up
Well she might, but only if I go first
She wears her heart on her sleeve like; she’s wearing a patch on her shoulder
It’s not a matter of whether I can catch her, more a matter of whether I can hold her
She thinks out loud she’s got me; she laughs with her whole body
I think about how she got it all figured out and wonder why she’d even want me?
Each night I find it’s the same ole, when I crawl inside in the evening
I lie down next to an angel; fall asleep and fly with my demons
They say don’t live in the past and live each day like it was your last but
I’d rather live each moment like it was my first, take it slow and sip from the glass
Savour the moment, spit vicious bars then pray for opponents
Sounds so serious don’t it? But I’m not concerned with a thing
This is book three, Tolkien, Return of the King
The kings have arrived; we drink from the sky
We fall from all ‘cause we think we can fly
But our wings have been tied, and the winging and lies
Have me I’m wishing that I could bridge the divide
You living the life? In the blink of an eye
The shine of the bling and the rims that you ride
Can all disappear so live for the rhyme
Not material things your gift can provide

I’ve been waiting to come back
Like where the hell is the show?
Like a balloon on a thumbtack
Getting ready to blow
I’ve been waiting to come back
Like where the hell is the show?
Like a balloon on a thumbtack
I’m getting ready now, I’m getting ready

Since ""State of the Art"" we’ve stayed in the yard just waiting to start this shit all over
Laying in bars for a day and a half, had to switch from gin to soda
And by like mid October, record was six months over
Due, and I‘m like dude what you expect? I’m only three months sober
Coming up turning tree trunks over, running up burning divas, posers
Run amok till the sun is up or till one of us # live la vidaloca
I’m gonna roll until I fold, like I got a hold of Propafol
So beautiful to know you all but for now peace I’m over and out

We won’t go, no we won’t go
No we won’t go, no we won’t go, no
We won’t go, no we won’t go
No we won’t go, no we won’t go, no
We won’t go, no we won’t go
No we won’t go, no we won’t go, no

Speaking In Tongues Restrung,"Drinking from the Sun, Walking Under Stars Restrung",2016,"Another war another martyr revered
Passed the fear from their fathers then it’s lasting for years
Bullets don’t discriminate the skin colour they pierce
We speak the same language brother; love, laughter and tears
Refugees trading death for a prison
While some base a set of opinions on race, sex or religion
C’mon, enough day to day stress of just living
Without giving a fuck if they’re hated just cause they different
Let’s do it under the name of the love that became lost
Dress it up how you want, we’re cut from the same cloth
Scars of hate, frowns stitched to our faces
Can’t escape the cage we forge, we’ve got bars to break
For those living every bit of the struggle
Given to hustle trying to figure how they fit in the puzzle
And right now we’re in pieces and peace is the people as one
Till then we’re treated like we’re speaking in tongues so here we come

I am, you are, we are one
We’re two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun
We be the left hand, right hand, right man?
But sometimes it seems like we’re speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum
I am, you are, we are one
We’re two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun
We be the left hand, right hand, right man?
But sometimes it seems like we’re speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum

Media is teaching the young, debate about belief in the one
Can make an eight-year soldier fall asleep with a gun
While tax man's hands deep in your funds, reaping your ones
Money tight like we tweaking the drums it’s like we speaking in tongues
But no book burnings or church sermons
I surf currents, my words burn like a dirt furnace
Confusion leads and anguish sells
But this music succeeds where even language fails
To convey free honest expression
It’s a problem trying to get people to acknowledge progression
My goal is to leave a lasting iconic impression
Controlling crowds like demonic possession and ain’t no time to invest in
Biting the hand that created the platform
Attaching pseudo patriotic crap to a rap song
Hoods and 2na try to unify the people as one
And yet we’re treated like we’re speaking in tongues so here we come

I am, you are, we are one
We’re two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun
We be the left hand, right hand, right man?
But sometimes it seems like we’re speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum
I am, you are, we are one
We’re two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun
We be the left hand, right hand, right man?
But sometimes it seems like we’re speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum

I would never hate someone for the way that they layin' with someone else
(And if you do) The blame comes from the weight of the way that you see yourself
Take some of the weight off your plate by taking the hate away
And then maybe you’ll make your way to start loving yourself
Fear’s a cancer, logic is a countermeasure
A property that you can’t count or measure
I got a problem with people who got a problem with
The way that other people wanna live (that’s their prerogative)
They’re mad at how you love, where your prayers are going
Their anger’s like a drug, they’re mad at where you from
But fuck a redneck checking if your visa’s valid
They act like pigs and chickens I’m sick of Caesar salad
So we seize the mallet, and we swing on the ignorant
Can’t speak our language? Then we’ll see if you can sing in it
Hoods and 2na try to unify the people as one
And yet we’re treated like we’re speaking in tongues so here we come

I am, you are, we are one
We’re two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun
We be the left hand, right hand, right man?
But sometimes it seems like we’re speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum
I am, you are, we are one
We’re two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun
We be the left hand, right hand, right man?
But sometimes it seems like we’re speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum

They pick me up just to pull me down
March to different drums, come from all around
It’s like we’re speaking in tongues
It’s like we’re speaking in tongues
They pick me up just to pull me down
March to different drums, come from all around
It’s like we’re speaking in tongues
It’s like we’re speaking in tongues
It’s like we’re speaking in tongues

I am, you are, we are one
We’re two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun
We be the left hand, right hand, right man?
But sometimes it seems like we’re speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum
I am, you are, we are one
We’re two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun
We be the left hand, right hand, right man?

The Thirst Pt. 6,"Drinking from the Sun, Walking Under Stars Restrung",2016,"Tonight, we have a chance to say, 'Yeah, you're right. We're too wild. We're too out of control. We're too full of our own shit.' Or we have a chance to say, 'Hey, fuck you, you're wrong! Fuck you, we're right!' Because you have all made it to the dance. Cause believe me, this is the dance! Start the show!

We have the thirst, we have the hunger
We dive head first into the wonder
We have the thirst, we have the hunger
We dive head first into the wonder

Don't know how I got here, don't know what approachin'
Don't know when this started, don't know where I'm goin'
If all I know is the path that I tread
Then life's a road: it goes one foot after the next
So I headed away the day my third was born
Feelin' blessed that I waited and made your first of dawns
It's like a Soap Opera tourin' through this snow, fog and morning
And we don't stop performin' till Debris lost an organ
And maybe I'm a dreamer but what happened to us?
Going crazy, cabin fever in the back of a bus
Something changed me on that road, when you're at it for months
Felt like a stranger being home so I had to adjust
Caught some mates at an event then they made an intervention
They say I should be slowin' down, I'm gaining in momentum
Truth in admissions part of pursuing this vision
And fuck cancer, my boy made it through his remission
Celebrated life more than I had in years
We celebrated the support from our fans and peers
I celebrated when our Prime Minister lost his throne
But dirt on someone else's hands doesn't wash your own
Some are livin' for the day, I'm haunted by my last
If all before us echo like a chorus of the past
Write a story in the sky, something for us that'll last
Till we're drinking from the sun and walking under stars",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-the-thirst-pt-6-lyrics
The Thirst Pt. 7,"Drinking from the Sun, Walking Under Stars Restrung",2016,"We have the thirst
We have the hunger
We dive head first
Into the wonder
We have the thirst
We have the hunger
We dive head first
Into the wonder

Don't know where to start, but then again since this is
The third and final part, I guess it's more like where to finish?
You ever seen La Haine? When Hubert kicks a story
About a man and how he fell from like fifty stories
And as he's travelin' from the roof to the hood
Of a car keeps babbling 'so far, so good'
That's how the last five years have felt, like falling in a canyon
The falling part I'm all in, but it's all about the landin'
I see the ground rushing at us
And when we hit the ground will we be running or crushed?
But that's life, courage gotta summon it up
And no matter if we still matter, sun will come up
Uh, my thoughts are running amok
But in my heart, man I know there's no one other than us
That can tear down a crowd like a bear that came down
On a fairground and found all these scared little clowns
I fold 'em, back 'em down
Sat 'em down, told 'em they could snatch the crown
You'd still be able to see our tan lines by the time that we get it back
'Cause we got one-eyed supporters: Fetty Wap
Call a Medevac, fly out, take aim at us
Christmas Story bruh, you'll shoot your eye out
We'll never die out, safe from extinction events
Been through the best and we ripped 'em to shreds

Eh Vinz, tu la connais l'histoire du keum qui tombe d'un building de 50 étages?
Et à chaque étage, pour s'rassurer, le keum il s'répète:
Jusqu’ici tout va bien, jusqu’ici tout va bien, jusqu’ici tout va bien. 
C'est l'atterissage",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-the-thirst-pt-7-lyrics
Through the Dark [Reprise],"Drinking from the Sun, Walking Under Stars Restrung",2016,,https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-through-the-dark-reprise-lyrics
Through The Dark Restrung,"Drinking from the Sun, Walking Under Stars Restrung",2016,"The very day you were born, your light shone bold in the dark
The doctor said you had a hole in your heart
Just knew you were making room for a whole lot of heart
And loved you from that day until your soul would depart
You took your first breath upon my chest
I built you a good nest before I left
It wasn't that I never loved your mother
But two happy homes are better than one that suffered
Every regret in this life that I made
Have been tempered by the strength in your eyes everyday
I know you never said that you’d like me to stay
Still I'm sorry I neglected you while I was away
You were eight when we headed to casualty
And no child should face their death or mortality
You taught me patience, strength and morality
And I'd burden this weight instead of you happily
That night, you asked if you'd die from your sickness
And why had it chosen your life out of millions
You filled me with a pride I was missing
'Cause grown men cry they lack your type of resilience
Only when it’s dark are the stars so bright
For your fight you’re gonna harbour these scars for life
But you a brave little soul, came in the cold
Like a fighter hope you find that same flame when you’re old

Fall asleep
And lay with me
We’ll search the night for shooting stars
If they can’t take
Away your pain
I’ll take your hand, walk through the dark
The dark
Through the dark

I wrote this while you slept in a hospital bed
Know this, your breath at the cost of my breath
I'd forego this life, let you honour my death
If you could know what it’s like to live long and regret
So you can fight, you can shove, you can bleed and hurt
You can cry, you can love, learn your creed or worth
Earn your stripes, act dumb, cut your teeth or worse
Or take a wife to become your sky, sea and earth
But if these are things that you never see
With no god, just me, here to set you free
And most others won’t understand the hell in which you’ve been in
Till they’ve wrestled with a demon
But take heart, to be brave we first need fear
That same heart that’s seen pain yet persevered
Will serve you, I know this world is, of course, unfair
And hurt you, but these virtues are yours to bear
I named you lionhearted the day you’re born
They say the night is darkest before the dawn
I'll take your hand upon this path, if you can light a spark
Then we can find some calm in a raging storm
Ain’t nothing left to scare you, see?
So we can live, laugh and cherish every breath we breathe
And no matter where you go know I’ll never leave
'Cause even when we’re gone we’re living in a memory, so live on

Fall asleep
And lay with me
We’ll search the night for shooting stars
If they can’t take
Away your pain
I’ll take your hand, walk through the dark
Fall asleep
And lay with me
We’ll search the night for shooting stars
If they can’t take
Away your pain
I’ll take your hand, walk through the dark
The dark
Through the dark

And I'm sorry that I can't take your pain, or answer why
We’ll lay awake through darker skies
I say your name, you cast a light
You’re a flame on a starless night
And I didn’t know I was lost till you found me
Didn’t know I was locked here without keys
But we can walk across all these boundaries
You and me, nothing here to stop you, you're now free
So I wrote this to give you hope
For every good thing in life you'll live to know
They say cancer survivors are gifted though
Let me know if that isn’t so",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-through-the-dark-restrung-lyrics
Walking Under Stars Restrung,"Drinking from the Sun, Walking Under Stars Restrung",2016,"Till the dawn is slung from the morning sun
I'ma crawl through these streets
I'ma walk under stars, fall in and out of bars
Till I fall to my knees
Till the dawn is slung from the morning sun
I'ma crawl through these streets
I'ma walk under stars, fall in and out of bars
Till I fall to my knees
And we say hey now
Hey, hey, hey now
Hey now
Hey, hey, hey now

Check, I'm either in or out
Ain't got time to sit around, trying to find a middle ground
I gotta live and not exist
Problem is there's not a gift offered if there wasn't risk
I went from poor to invested and stressed on tour
Wrestling the lessons, these questions bore
If I can't feel it right now, what's the effort for?
Don't wanna build a lighthouse on an empty shore
See I can shoot the breeze, but can't do it for free
Cause who are we if I don't make this fucking music for me?
And it ain't about the fame or 'bout recouping a fee
But either way, that's time away from the two kids I feed
Caught in between, any day your fortune can swing
And you don't wanna be a jester in a court full of kings
We set our own pace to the race we're running in
And celebrate what we put out, not what's coming in

Till the dawn is slung from the morning sun
I'ma crawl through these streets
I'ma walk under stars, fall in and out of bars
Till I fall to my knees
Till the dawn is slung from the morning sun
I'ma crawl through these streets
I'ma walk under stars, fall in and out of bars
Till I fall to my knees
And we say hey now
Hey, hey, hey now
Hey now
Hey, hey, hey now

I lay down my bars in the bars where I lay down
Till I’m barred by the barmaid, hey, I stay ‘round
A barfly, barhoppin' bars like a playground
Debris's like a barber, he cuts in the fade out
Hey now
We had plans and breakdowns laid out
But Lennon said it better than Suffa ever can
""Life's what happens when you're busy making other plans""
Pushed back plans like Jesse Pinkman's hairline
The way some reacted, that caught me unprepared, I
Had friends throw darts, fuck crew like that
Man they broke my heart, but through my back
But success is the best revenge so I guess
That I've had a lot of vengeance then, yo, I'm blessed
And apologising for being so fresh
Is like Napoleon writing ""Excuse my French""
And a tiger don't apologise for being tiger
A Kaiser don't apologise to a miser
Man I'ma wear the night sky like a cape
And add a jewel to my crown every time that you hate
So hate on, little man, hate on
Cause they raze every stage they on
Until they say my name in all capital cities
And they spell my name in all capitals, please rap it all with me, it goes...

Till the dawn is slung from the morning sun
I'ma crawl through these streets
I'ma walk under stars, fall in and out of bars
Till I fall to my knees
Till the dawn is slung from the morning sun
I'ma crawl through these streets
I'ma walk under stars, fall in and out of bars
Till I fall to my knees

Hey now

Won’t Let You Down Restrung,"Drinking from the Sun, Walking Under Stars Restrung",2016,"They say you can't love and be wise, but I can pretend with you
If suddenly I ever had to surrender you
I’d fall in a heap; I’d fall on the floor
And crawl on all fours, for you I’d fall on my sword
If grief ever darkened my door you’d light it up
The way you brighten up a room hit’s me right in the
Chest, it puts the breath inside of my
Lungs, it’s like I leapt in the light of the
Sun, and in spite of my weary frown
You wear a smile that wears me down, so hear me out
I know that I wasted time
When I should have been replacing your last name with mine
And that mistake is mine believe me
I wear it like its sunburn, it might disappear but it won’t leave me
I’ll carry you on my shoulders, never set you down
Ferry you through the coldness, never let you down

I won’t let you down
Won’t let you down again
I won’t let you down
Won’t let you down again
Said I won’t

Travelling man in the back of a van
Capturing sands like time through the back of my hand
If I could hold it for a moment, do a lap of this land
I’d console you for a moment then be back in a glance
But I’m, so far since we left for the road
To chase the sun around the heavens and globe
Searching for the next episode, problem is that letting it go
Would be like letting go of everything I treasure and know
And whenever I go I think your chest will explode
A martyr with your heart like Brandon Lee’s death in The Crow
Try and understand where I lay my head is my home
And I was in love before this rap shit was ever in vogue
But if you feel that you’re ever alone
While standing in the same room as me let’s set it in stone
You can’t save me, a queen to this devilish rogue
But you’re bravely willing to give a hell of go so

I won’t let you down
Won’t let you down again
I won’t let you down
Won’t let you down again
Said I won’t

I hate that I wasted your touch and your taste
It’s my shame and can’t change it, want you to remain
My angel, my heartbeat, come closer, I’m sorry
My soul is yours, surely you know this

And you know that I
Won’t be shy talking ‘bout what you’ve given me
Conflict diamond, you shine through the misery
You walk in a room and light it up, that’s just with your entry
You walk in a room and light it up like it was four twenty
Some people never find out what they have
Only ever find out what they had, and I could’ve been
One of them, don’t know that I still won’t
And that thought hangs around my neck like a millstone
For real though, it’s like I lost you, left you, let you go
Before I got to get you or let you know
That you’re my refuge, and I need you to see
The only one that I let down more than you is me

And I won’t let you down
And I won’t let you down
I won’t let you down
Won’t let you down again
I won’t let you down
I won’t let you down again",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-wont-let-you-down-restrung-lyrics
Time That I Miss,Highlanders,1994,"A time that I miss, or was it the time that I missed?
'Cause half the time I was pissed, check the time on your wrist
Sunshine in the crisp morning air of the lamp park
Hanging at barbecues, and other crews who’d never air spark
B-boys, it’s all chill, leave and it’s all chill
That was cool when they greet, broke leaf at the score
Still, school days were cool days, kickin’ the football always
Would be good, we would get detention set in hallways
I used to hate that shit, now I miss the crew from school
When getting pissed was cool and you got dissed if you was a fool
I walked the line to school, when Belair was all peace
Back then I rode with heads, and outran transit police
""Oh shit, the cops,"" that’s the sound of the pigs
We used to rock, what’s the colour of a true sick beat
(Copper, copper) I pissed off they trying to stop the hilltop
If proper was flopper all the real mates, still ain’t forgot ya
This is not the time or place that it used to be, but you’d agree
That you and me have grew to be the neighbourhood nuisancy
Truancy was regular, these styles were meant for the
Ears of a peer, good times, I’ll remember you
In the mental with a dollar like, we direct and we make
It’s the Hoods baby rocking freestyles at Apex

On (on) till the early morn’
I keep it on (on) till the break of dawn

Man, the mouth boxes fly from the house it rocks the fight
Coming from the under south and topside
Strived for summer, with just shorts on ya
Laze in sun rays and the days are longer
Catch a slack from my oldies, till my hat turned back
Grabbed a six pack of coldies, then walk down to Blackwood
Pass the Bourb’ after dark, we try and wind around
It’s okay, the curb and cold park, it’s the time that I miss

""Go inside your heart and find the time that you miss""
""Go inside your heart and find the time that you miss""

I remember Christmas vacation, hangin’ at the station
Sunny days and money days, and my heart's relaxation
Situation we facing was chasing just one dollar
Too dumb for a school, I thought replacement in relation to intoxication
Conversation with cops led to 
I rocked  my verse
Settin’ fire to Dacha, then blame the ties and jackets
Better watch it, so let a box get blown by fire crackers
And inspired by Flak is how I got my start
(It’s the hoods mate, rapping freestyles in cold parks)

On (on) till the early morn’
I keep it on (on) till the break of dawn

Yeah man, coming off the top, intelligent, with the element
Under the influence of alcohol  elephant tenders man
Hell I bet it was a freestyle development
From the settle we invent, to old product
Run up, run and walk, run afar, run amok
Running shit, bring the crews together like Chlamydia
Look down from Windy Point and know we run this fuckin’ city
It’s a pity, bulls aren’t as freaky from the local delinquents
Grab a pipe and a life pass to the right was a sequel
And ignite, day and night where the frequent  saying
I aim for the top, just trying to contain my crop
Used to run from our mothers, pretend we were brothers
Score the same hoes but under different covers
Others could not consume as much liquor
As the Blackwood boys, the neighbourhood father figures
Take you back, drink your packs, beer care for your pain
Physically I’ve changed, but mentally I’m still the same
And maintain the memory, remember these days, no strife
Hash would blaze in the nights, some of the best days of my life
So with my memories of Apex, I’ll never be alone
That’s the legacy, so I'ma let Next take it home

""Go inside your heart and find the time that you miss""
""Go inside your heart and find the time that you miss""
""Go inside your heart and find the time that you miss""
""Go inside your heart and find the time that you miss""
""Find the time that you miss"" ""Find the time that you miss""
""Find the–find–find the time that you miss""

Afternoon Group Session,"Left Foot, Right Foot",2001,"COUNSELLOR: People, people, can I have some quiet. Thank you very much. Now we know why we're all here, we're all very special people. What we're going to do is have a little group session, we're all gonna take turns and we're gonna talk, okay, we're gonna talk. Now, would anyone like to talk first? How about you Matt? Why don't you talk, have a go
SUFFA: Okay I'll try
COUNSELLOR: Yeah, have a go

Hi my name's Matt (Hi Matt), and I'm eight-foot-tall
I fight like Mike Tyson, I can break through walls
I got a science degree and a PhD
If you see a sucka what you see ain't me
I got the finest...

COUNSELLOR: Wait, wait, wait, stop, stop
SUFFA: What's the problem?
COUNSELLOR: What do you think?
SUFFA: Why'd you stop me?
COUNSELLOR: 'Cause you're being delusional, now try again
SUFFA: Do it again?
COUNSELLOR: Yes, try it again

Hi my name's Matt (Hi Matt), and what I said wasn't true
I'm not eight-foot-tall, I'm really six-foot-two
So I don't have to bend for doorways when I enter
Not a title fight contender but I do have a temper
I'm not really centered, kind of off to the right
I Dream of Jeannie and jerk off in the night
Don't get me in the light, it's just my fear is that
I got a face you wanna mace, man, I make mirrors crack
I'm more hustle than bustle, it's enough to make you sad
I couldn't find my way out of a wet paper bag
If you made me mad, or even if you stare at me
I'll start filming and shouting saying ""you sent me into therapy""
I drink muscle growth powder and then chowed'd down a sachet
Sit at home alone making friends with papier-mâché
'Cause when it came to mates I never really made the quota
Even though I tried to suck 'em in with cookies and soda
My biggest hero's Yoda, yo, I'm kind of a geek
I watched Return of the Jedi seven times just last week
I can't speak without impediment, went off my medication
Sometimes I talk to chairs and have 'em hold a conversation
I sleep with a nightlight 'cause I'm scared of the dark
I walk with a limp just to get a handicap park
With my hand on my heart, I swear that I'm a liar
Hi my name's Matt, I like to set things on fire

COUNSELLOR: Well wasn't that wonderful, group? Thank you very much Matt for sharing. Now just put down the lighter. Okay, is there anyone else that would like to talk? How about you Dan? Come on Dan get up, don't be shy. That's right

I'm a supersonic bionic, MC Pressure, who want it?
I'll radiate plutonics and destroy cities 
I'm six-foot-seventeen, I don't diss, the end is here
Crack a fat and cast shadows over the southern hemisphere
Never fear...

COUNSELLOR: Wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop. Aren't we a little excitable. Well then, why don't we try it again but a little more honest

All right, my name's Dan (Hi Dan), I used to
Think I was the man till the toga hit my hand at 
See I'm the type at the end of the night caught sipping dregs
At Phys Ed they used to diss me, man, they called me chicken legs
I'm kind of dull from hitting heads from American Football
Sorry I lied about my height, I'm not even six-foot-tall
I got this habit of exaggeratin', twisting words and encapsulatin'
And I, yeah... occasionally masturbatin'
At my very best, I'm just a scary pest
I shave to hide my peach fuzz, ""one day I'll have a hairy chest""
I rarely rest, I'm an insomniac, no one wants me on their track
'Cause I stay up late at night creatin' songs that's wack
Thought I was hitting, but all this time seems I was missing
My ex dumped me for this geek that worked at Kentucky Fried Chicken
Damn I was bitchin', having thoughts of givin' my wrists a slittin'
(So you were quietly upset) Man, you even listen?
I bring out the bad in people, had this friend that was mad and evil
Got to know me, starts tellin' me how he thinks fags are equal
(You're unhappy with who you are?) Nah, I cherish a number
I'm twenty-two, I live at home with my parents and brother
(You sound kind of depressed) Yeah,  I'm a maniac
My best friend's named Suffa, the others just say I'm wack
But I'm okay with that, gave up being a true thug
I feel better that's off my chest, God, can I have a group hug?

COUNSELLOR: Well Daniel we can't actually give you a hug. We've been through your file and no one's actually allowed to touch you. What we'll do is, we'll take out our circles of paper and we'll write ten things we like about ourselves and ten things we like about other people.

Another World,"Left Foot, Right Foot",2001,"You dirty rat, talking shit tryna send me back
To hell from where you came from, you sing that same song
Every time I hear you, sounds like you off of ya flame
Plus you drink too much beer too
Your queer crew aren't shit neither
A bit eager to get a kid beat up
With the blunt side of a machete
It's my cut side that's so upsetting
Letting off steam like tough equation streams
It be ya dreams, getting ripped at the seams
Harsh as the words from a biblical fiend
Cussing out the evil in you
It's amazing what evil people will do
To get the chance to dance and swing with the king
Shine without the bling bling
But these boys can't understand cause it's a Koolism thing, see?
Single-handedly, or even if I've got my uncle down with me
We're taking out your whole family
From nephews, to second cousins, to your old bitch
To your half brother, down to your gold fish (oh ish)
You understanding me? Cause it's hunting season
And I'm picking them off your family tree like
One by one, two by two, the almighty Koolism crew
The who is who of Aussie Hip Hop
While I'm a sick cunt, you're just a sick cock
In a piss trough so piss off

Emcees think they're too deaf to hear what I'm telling 'em
But they can't see me like tattoos on melanin
I'm large like Van Halen in the 80s
Ladies I love, ladies can't step, bitches
Cut the track till it requires stitches
Like fruit fly in citrus, I'm ill-tech like Tetris
Distort through other's skill and see what my vocal fetches
I give open lectures in the park under Wattle trees
Until a fight sparks and someone's baptised by the bottle we
Try chill but it bothers me that violence always erupts
The crowd's feeling me like a pair of perfect D cups
Yo, we up in here like last year's out of here
The hoods are up, in here till we tired or out of beer
And we represent it, like the sword and the snake
And we staying independent like a ward of the state
Yo, I'm-bored-of-the-fake, hi fake! Named Suffa, pleased to meet ya
I live inside the mind of the listener through the speaker
""Is that your beeper?"" No it's my phone, I got it on-beeper-and-vibrate
I rocks it for my people till my +People's+ pupils +Dilate+
Yo, why hate? Those on top, I'm coming from the bottom
Cut the track to my man who comes and puts the pressure on 'em!

I look emcees in their eyes and ask 'em what they think's wrong with this rap scene
And what their lacking, thinking that here I got their vaccine
I'm wavering from their battering with the slip of my mix
Think they can battle with headphones until they listen to this!
Kicking the hits, the Hoods and Koolism, I'm serious this
Is guaranteed to get some head nod till you slip into diss
So persist with a diss! Man you believe it?
But they aren't even half-stepping, nah man they more like paraplegic
I rock 'em till they cease and keep it rough when get fucked when
I leave 'em scarred so hard they wouldn't heal if Jesus touched them
The rough blend like masturbating with a cheese grater
The emcee breaker, never been a faker, please I'm greater!

Distortion,"Left Foot, Right Foot",2001,"So many onlookers witness vibes, but never live that life
So how they gonna start to run their mouths and criticise
About this culture that we give our lives
Rap's a whore that's written, tried so many washed up sounds on any given tide
Openly B-Boy's sympathise, but never live tonight
They couldn't give a fuck whether this rap culture will live or die
The common question given's 'Why?', I looked at different skies
See that it's the same fate that will face seas and glittering eyes
From all these distorted views, so called 'important news'
Headlines endorsing crews, but really mate, fuck what they thought of you
Busting your gut for poor reviews, to open doors and muse
So people talk of you like Waterview to discard you like a whore that's used
Get sore and bruised with not much more to lose, dignity torn in two
The massive bill you've thought it through, fought, tries all life - they scorn at you
You've seen the publics point of views, built on distorted news
Stereotyped to the point they don't know who they're talking to

(""A B-Boy, the force in my soul is sonic"")
""Distortion, distortion""
(""A B-Boy, the force in my soul is sonic"")

I smell the sweat (Smell the sweat)
I see the pride (See the pride)
Get to taste (Get to taste)
Fame and fortune (Fame and fortune)
There lies uncluttered (Uncluttered)
By ""Distortion""

I'm an Aussie B-Boy! Yeah just another decoy
Sent to un-fill my world so they can destroy
The deep foundations that we employed
Yet steady being devoid of propaganda that many seem to enjoy
Helpless, selfless careers take a path, although they're faint in heart
The media attention they receives enough to make a star
The image kindly faces stark, although they're fake in heart
Laying so much shit they never stagger, it's time to take a path
Then they make the chart, but they'll never take the heart
From a fabled art, too many B-Boy's awake and smart
And even in my waking mark, the first negate the last
But I swear on death that you won't ever catch me faking arse
Public opinions aim to spark, only flame my heart
And wash over this culture like sulphur, over tainted glass
Despite the grip of hate is fast in this sedated grass
Strangling the life from hip-hop so let's make it last

I give props to any MC that try to stop me
I look at 'em, throw my rhyme book at 'em, see which rap he feel
And make him hate himself like bulimics eating Happy Meals
I'll sap your skills like sex saps your endurance
Fuck hip-hop  still Hoods are passing judgement like we're jurors
Who is? Me and Fats, 'cause we hate clones
I'm gonna take your living skin like DJ Bonez
Mum, this kid is the one to make you clap like chlamydia
Props to true friends: Baz, Flak, and Olivia
Consider the certified the kings of the city, the
Wise rock live from here to Bolivia
Italy to Sicily, Tripoli to Gallipoli
I'm flipping the mic, ain't nobody ripping me
So clap your hands to the beatbox
This rapper's standing in his Reeboks
Yo, we rock cities like Grateful Dead rocking old folks
Yeah, come sweat me on the reg like I was trapped and I sold dope
 now either or, we the raw
Open your eyes, I'll show you things you never seen before
When we on tour we live on cigarettes and good banter
My mates live on junk food and marijuana
My armour's my b-boy battle gear, yeah, we here
B-boys flock to me like I was free weed and free beer

And the Hoods won't stop if the beat don't stop

Here we go. It's the almighty Pressure MC in the house. Alright, bring it to 'em. Take 'em to school. Don't stop
.

Ain't it funny how the world seems to run on a profit
That's why rappers check for me like their wallets, I'm deeper than a klepto's pockets
So when rock it, you don't wanna battle, boy, get off it
FM stations got no plugs for me, I simply pull 'em out your sockets
Debris, drop it, this beat is hella
Now we the fellas dropping the third 
I believe I never seen my better
Still MCs try and push me around, 'cause I'm the only peer 
MCs are never  change out my style
Like ugly women swap the dice if that's what she like
 these long days make for longer nights
While I come correct, you're still confused about wrong and right
I'm on a tight schedule to murder a face
'Cause I hate 'em like people up in my personal space
Not even thermals will make your shit hot, rehearsal's a waste
You ain't got it, you ain't got it, it ain't personal, mate
I'm kinda happy being me, you ain't happy with yourself
Fuck, there's Markey in a nappy tryna take samples for free
Now even crack fiends agree we got the rock that you feel, I
Bring the bass to your dome  serving crack dealers
I'm tiring of old, uninspiring and sold-outs
Designed for the mould, so keep your lips sealed, silence is gold
 I walk the hills amongst giants of old
Revoke your license to ill while your album  sold

I Believe,"Left Foot, Right Foot",2001,"This is Suffa MC (Suffa MC)

Hey I could say ""life's not all that it's cracked up to be""
And I feel like a dump truck's suddenly back on to me
And it's smothering me in a wealth of decay
And I'm suffering B, and no ones ever felt the way I do
But I believe in something (what you believe?)
I do believe, I believe in life (well I believe)
I do believe that the sun is shining (is shining)
On the other side of the night and if I believe
Long enough and my belief's strong enough
And I believe in my own damn song enough
Then I can believe in myself, believe in faith
Crush my own anger, envy, even hate
Then we can make a new start free from hate
Believe in fate has a positive - even great
Proceeds away from our dreams, we need to make
'Cause I can't leave it late, we need to take
The seeds that take our hearts and see them break
When we await to find ourselves freed by faith
And we can't wait to see the face, see them shake at this
See the hate, see them wait for me to break
For he or she to break Suffa MC with they
They need escape, see you mate, now free the gate
See them run from the path they deviate
While this man elevates and alleviates

""I believe in something
I do believe I believe in life
I do believe that the sun is shining on the
Other side of the night""
""I believe in something
I do believe I believe in life
I do believe that the sun is shining on the
Other side of the night""

And by the way I do believe in myself
Not believing only things I can see for myself
Even believing that the air that I'm breathing is wealth
Because we're guaranteed nothing except leaving this world
I'm just trying to live, I'm just trying to breath
I'm just trying to give so that I can receive
Life's positive 'cause universally we've got a lot to give
So when I'm taking my leave I believe I should leave my mark
Before our own music is perceived as art
Soulful remedies to ease the heart when grief is sparked
Beneath the dark skies I search to seek my mark
Friends come and go so I move on as the seasons start
Release the dark side of my mind to find peace at heart
Increase my smarts rather than walk on streets that's marked
Nearly can beat the spark, needless this grief has marred
The whole world, clearly you know who the elitists are
Beliefs more unique, the peace laws are weak
Governments are sworn to speak the truth of born defeats
The pens are mightier than any man's sword that's sheathed
Argue we flaunt the fists, for war on streets
Cause more than grief, poverty strikes, people are torn beneath
Cornered streets walked by people who were born deceased
I rise above this world and cease my defeat, I got
Faith in myself, contrary to your beliefs

""I believe in something
I do believe I believe in life
I do believe that the sun is shining on the
Other side of the night""

Immortal MCs,"Left Foot, Right Foot",2001,"""Suffa MC and the Pressure gonna bless your mind""

It's the immortal MCs, we came to build on this earth
So we blessed the microphone like priests did children at birth
Many seek microphone mastery, please keep it to heart that we
Are not masters of this art, it's simply this art that has mastered me
For those that shall come after me your rhymes just fill the holes with laughter, we
A dastardly duo, don't go starting me
And I am for real like Outkast apologies
As long as we rockin' the mic, ain't no stopping me
I rock it properly, Hilltops a property
Sometimes I feel like stress is squashing me like fat girls on top of me
Now honesty will get you everywhere and everywhere's
All over the place like your rhyme styles so you bite styles from anywhere
Lest we dead or be ourselves or see ourselves as individuals
So I make tracks on digital to please myself
Fuck MCs that felt they're hard done by
Say tonight's their night I set their mic alight and have me float my sunrise

""Suffa MC and the Pressure gonna bless your mind""
""Suffa MC and the Pressure gonna bless your mind""

We got the funk, we got the fire like George Clinton
MCs take an intern like interns take it from Bill Clinton
Smoke that cigar, don't take a breath, take a drag
I blow on spots like two-hundred proof, meth and a rag
See this is ill in the flesh like cancer live in the breast
The realest test make you party people squeal ""yes, yes""
So if MCs wanna test don't give up the fight
You need to stand up with your mic and battle all night
All right, these MCs I'm rippin' 'em, then flippin' 'em
When it comes to mic control, I got soul like Minnie Riperton
So do you wanna ride
Through the south side and Hilltops with the Certified Wise?
Heard you might try but you can't battle perfection
These boys will blow your high like adrenaline injections
When we flex and even RSL diggers label us veteran
Lack direction, we put hip hop on the map in your section

""Hip-hop's phattest notes""
""Hip-hop's phattest notes""
""Pedigree""

Now how can you compete with this
Half of you are weak as piss
The weaker always need to diss
You're open like a bleeding wrist
You're focused, you weren't seeing this
We're doper than weed and trips
No peace without war, go to war to get a piece of this
They cease and miss, we're keeping on
Our rhyme styles you're sleeping on
The fuse is lit and we's the bomb
See the naked truth like peeping tom's
Your styles are weak, mate keep it strong
Your girl said she needs a long
And on and on and on she kept on
Your style slept on my mattresses
There's no crew that matches this
Try to play the roller, but there ain't nothing but actresses
But don't you kid the fatness is
The shit like we ate laxatives
Underground is where we're from; immortal hip hop activists

Leaving Sideways,"Left Foot, Right Foot",2001,"I'm digging for some change from behind the couch
I'm jumping in my car and I'm driving south
I'm digging for some change from behind the couch
I'm jumping in my car and I'm driving south

Different seasons come and change, end of winter hibernation
Digging for some change, slept inside the vibes I make
It got me wide awake and sweat beads are glistening
From lack of air conditioning, too hot to be living in
And as the world turns, I churn my lifeline
The daylight's just a prelude to night time
With no D-Day, you know if I gotta hit this other freeway
Hook up with Baz and PJ, then put the hook on replay
Now we're here for a beach day, let's get it together now
Hit the southern shores before the sun toils and weather fouls
It's where my pals dehydrate, make their speech funny
The sand sheets are lovely, it beats bumping and beach buddies
Keep passing me by, I catch a glimpse in their eye
A moody day under the UV rays in the sky
I keep my feet up to the beat up, damn this is the life
Enough to make a man forget about his worries and strife
In the sunshine...

I'm digging for some change from behind the couch
I'm jumping in my car and I'm driving south
I'm digging for some change from behind the couch
I'm jumping in my car and I'm driving south

Hey I can taste Friday, I'm leaving you guys
I'm chasing a place with sunlight in the skies
So I'm blinding my eyes to the point that they hurt
Only a fool or a jerk would be at school or at work
Days like this are for the beach and brew
I stop off at a phone so I can reach my crew
Hey yo Pressure, what's up? I need to speak to you
The week is through son and what we need to do
Is you, me go get some brews, do thee, coastal cruise
Catch some UV, and bruise, the booty that keeps passing us by
We need to do it while the sun still laughs in the sky
I'll be taking off my Nikes
Feel the sand between my toes, real lives are like
Looking forward to summertime nights
And this is my life, my life, my life, my life
In the sunshine...

I'm digging for some change from behind the couch
I'm jumping in my car and I'm driving south

""This ain't no fucking joke""

When I lay down to sleep I turn to a deep thinker
Don't wanna be a whinge like a lonely binge drinker
It's just that, well they don't call me Suffa for nothing
I'm a depressed, harrowing, repressed suffering
Maniac, screaming at anybody, anyplace
Man, I love people, I just hate the human race
And I hate all my friends 'cause all my friends are takin' drugs
They think it's spiritual like a hippy making love
But the powders power only lasts for an hour
So they take a powder shower till they burn down like Niki Lauda
Sour times come quicker than a John inside a hooker
With a drum before that, with a drum for my da tinka
Every day for her's the same, leg up, chin up
Left foot, right foot, lay down, shut up
Every day she's getting fucked just like everyone else, man
Damn, screw all your problems, I'ma focus on myself and

""This ain't no fucking joke""

""This ain't no fucking joke""

I spent the last twenty-two years of my life earning my way
Around the world, this space around me, watching night turn to day
I earned some pay in certain ways but it wasn't that
They told me grey's between black and white and opposites attract
Possibly that the world of one man is filled by another
Yo Suffa, we breathe the breath of others, your sanctuary's my cover
This feeling in my upper is possibly life
That matches negative thought so I move positive mics
Probability strikes, random targets live in famine
And the heart is too much for one man to stand regardless
The powder and pills ain't no way to heal my friend
Lean on one shoulder, the other rises like my skills ascend
See life has many ups, many downs and many miles
Many broken promises, hollow words and empty smiles
Consequently many dies when they break from the hit and hate
Drowning in this everyday give or take
[Chorus: Pressure, Suffa & 
Jodie Morgan

Running From the Storm,"Left Foot, Right Foot",2001,"It's the calm before the storm that sends that feeling to my frontal lobe
As thunder roams the sky at night I seek shelter yet run alone
The rain soaks me to the bone, assisted by the winter wind
(The chill is blisterin'), my patience for this world begins to thin
Handed in by heavy clothes, the hail rains heavy blows
Heavens chose to endeavour the weather, my very foe
Can barely close my frozen hand around my own fucking dream
With each breath, puff and steam, the night it cools my blood stream
The freeze gripping my chest, my knees strip into flesh
My screams echo through the night but no-one's listening unless
They seeing eye to eye, but it's like the fog slowly buries me
They light their lights then scar my vision, shows me momentarily
The edge of the roadside, thanks to cars I'm covered in spray
Then I try and hitch a ride, the traffic moves the other way
Then I ain't see the sun for days, just like my lifes energy
I stagger on relentlessly and see something ahead of me
I cramp by shelter, I'd take a life for some space
And knowin' lightning never strikes twice in one place
I fight for a taste of the dry life, better known as the high life
But I'm expelled into the winds and that's heralded the story of my life
I keep on through the raging storm and all these distorted sounds
Thoughts of how I'm getting mine no matter how watered down
I'm quarter drowned, quarter frozen, quarter lost, quarter fucked
Man it's been raining for days and I think I'm wet enough
Enough, treading water just to be the next man's shelter
Enough, drowning victims even though you know I felt ya
I've got enough problems of my own, find a sanctuary
Within the eye of the storm, I feel the calm anger me
*Muffled*
Ignore the storm clouds gathering on the coast
And not give into emotion, be strong, keep on


I walk through life like a drunk in a bar
I no longer see the light that comes from the stars
Cause clouds hang overhead like paintings in the gallery
And rain pats on my head, voices in my head sing ""Battle me""
I challenge the sky, and the sky spits and runs
So the moistures at my heals and I run quick and fast
From the mystic dancer, that is the weather the pattern
It's either clapping, attacking - a peaceful night can never happen
Weather rains for days and leaves you soaked to the bone
I exhale steam like I was smoking a bone
I try coping alone but the rain goes through the night
And then opens my dome like raining blows in a fire
I've been inside for days, I've been trapped in the south side
Cause the fogs a haze and the sky's a blaze outside
I put in my headphones and listen to some Daddy O
To try escape the drone of rain pissing on my patio
But the rain always comes back, never stops, never fades
Banging on my window like cops, in a raid man
What, would I trade, for sunlight I feel like grabbing these
And knockin' myself out, relieving Suffa from this cavalry, ah
The winds are wailing, even howling at my shutter's
Gutters overflowing, blowing the wind, it whispers 'Suffa...'
I wish another day would come and bring the sun in tow
Cause this storm's a raging ocean and I'm sucked in by the undertow
The thunder throws a frightening blow, the lighting glows and disappears
It appears, that it'll be days before the fog and mist will clear
Sticks and logs and missiles here, watch that they don't take a
Eye out, cry out - and get drowned out by mother nature, nature uh

Sojourn,"Left Foot, Right Foot",2001,"I don't represent a city wha, I represent the whole earth
Suck my head inside my chest so I can soul search
Suffa MC gets deep in the cut like infections
Seek perfection like women getting colagen injections
Suck the fat outta them hips and put em into them lips
But now your arse is in your mouth and you can't stop talking shit
I bring the sound to please like the autumn breeze
Bring the leaves down to the ground from the trees, underground I'm at ease
Above ground a mother grieves for her daughter killed
Lost to a pill (a pill) her loving boyfriend bought her, feel
Like I wanna holla, put our trust inside a dollar
Not a chance to advance when we choose lust over honour
Wanna all week, a leak spills death into the ocean
And we swallow our tongues like we swallow our emotions
Let's suffocate our wilderness in cement and granite
Then our children gets to inhabit and build on this dead planet
That we leave, and I watch the evening shadow the sun
Another night, another fight, another battles begun
And kids don't box no more, now it's bats, knifes and machetes
Annoyed and paranoid, I think they're all coming to get me
Sweat me like I was the one that made their girlfriends leave them all
I'm the reason they're outta work and the playing fields uneven
It's even for everyone bro, we're disadvantaged equally
Instead of trying to hurt me, try to stay calm and just speak to me

You feeling me now? (You feeling me now?)
You feeling me now? (You feeling me now?)
You feeling me now? (You feeling me now?)
You feeling me now? (I hope you're feeling me now)

I hope you're feeling me, like contact on nerve endings
Sounds superb bending nouns and verbs, blending words
Sending them in the form of a verse
Sending you pains
 like the winter rains
Bring them crops relief from the haze of the summer days
And the droughts dried out them fields and broke that father's heart, a farmer's heart
Now they're heading to the city for another start
And the city's filled with ghosts that's known as homeless vagabonds
Ain't no bench they ain't seen, alley they haven't gone
Rattle on, rabble on
Sing that song Mr Vagabond and tell me all the roads you travelled on
From here to Babylon and babble on
That liquid in the flagon gone, liquified your brain
'Til you're asking who you are, where you're from, what's my name?
What's in a name? Is it the same that's in a person?
Entitled to identify you as society's servant
Man I'll never be subservient, the pride inside is permanent
Bring on your coup I'm serving it, now raise your flag, I'm burning it
On my journey when inside my journey was a sojourn
It was either go left, go right, go crazy or go learn
About the self, because sometimes the self it gets forgotten
And you only achieve contact once you've hit rock bottom
Not stopping 'til I face every problem, faced every bend
Face every corner, every turn and keep faith in my friends
And family come stand with me as the world turns
We'll warm our hands by the fire as the world burns

You feeling me now? (You feeling me now?)

The Soul of the Beat,"Left Foot, Right Foot",2001,"Look
10 stories below if you ever try finding me
I'm the one with rhymes so high tech I write in binary
So if you don't understand them all, that's understandable
The vibe is intangible, the rhyme is like an animal
A beast of the night, he likes to feast in the light
He gives no peace on the mind, with the beats that you like
I'm servin' bowls of soul, in the form of a lyric
You know me, I'm the difference between soul and spirit
Everybody freeze, just hold and hear it
Feel the cold and fear it, if you're bold come near it
Man, feel it, I put soul into mic control
Like jazz artists put soul into rock and roll
You gots to roll with us or else you're against us
My flow to me's like poetry just less pretentious
Weak MCs befriend us, they're just as bad as each other
Never be phatter than Suffa so why not battle each other?
And just leave me alone like a hermit in a cabin
The vibe is alive, reverberating like a Hammon light
That's right we got vibe, it's never won, it's heaven-sent
So, Hilltop Hoods represent, represent
Evidently when we
Represent our weakness is never ever evident
I represent the kids from the side of the street
Never silencing me and the feeling that's inside of this beat

""This is the beat"" the hills shows you Suffa
""This is the beat"" that made you call an ex-lover, it's like
Summer nights on the porch with a beer
""This is the beat, y'all, of the year""
""This is the beat"" to put the Pressure to your points
""This is the beat"" to make you scream ""it's the joint!""
They got tunnel vision, well, let me make it clear
""This is the beat, y'all, of the year""

We slam hittin'
Crushin MCs for their ambition then
Sticken high frequencies over your transmission
Now listen
While all these crossovers transition
They barely scratch the surface, while I delve deeper than Hans Christian
Anderson, battling, damn boy you must be dreaming
Couldn't understand the first of my double meanings
You're double teaming with trouble seething
I flex like exaggerated biceps over all these muscle he-men
I hear their mic from screamin (maggots)
Honestly none can follow me, from what I been through
I still read true the prophecies
Unconsciously I took doses of dopeness like an apothecary
And if harnessed properly, effects monopoly - no stopping me
""This is the beat"" for all my mates sucking piss
After Hours, Terra Firm, Cross-Bred, pump your fist
""This is the beat"" for those who wanna fuck with this
Now everybody wants something but they can't get none of this
Just my line is composed
Will leave their mind comatosed
Like unleveling their blood pressure til' their rhyme overdosed
Many months closed 'cause they nonbelievers
I walked a water passed all these stranded MC's
And told em' to catch a breather
Why touch what you don't know?
Learn your words, you washed and dried up
Why fuck with what you know - hurts just to learn to wise up
Open your eyes up for the now, 'cos tomorrow it's too late
'Cause this is the beat to leave your sorrows in your wake

Tolerance Levels,"Left Foot, Right Foot",2001,"I conversate to all emcees with my double jointed tongue
Slapping, fuck ya wack rapping
Taking-a-bite-out-of-ya-mix and best mic just happening
You're lacking in persona
While I throw lyric bombardments to your crew in every corner
I discharge a mad flow that'll stop dogs from barking
Snap your leg bones so you can use disabled parking
Give you unimaginable meanings to the word fucking
Your raps mean nothing, I'll get your grandma to cook me muffins
Move in so I can hide eggs in the neighbour's ceiling
In plastic bags next to the cocaine and Bruce Lee key rings
You emcees are still teething, intriguing
Before the battle pleading, after that your heads are bleeding
Miraculous flows with raggedy clothes, my trademark
Overweight but I'll still move fast, on any beat that's hard
You claiming to be battle emcees with tight flows and integrity?
Blow me, you motherfuckers are far from scaring me

Pressure MC, get with me, from Adelaide to Sydney
This be dedicated to emcees that struck out but still yelling ""Hit me!""
With their gimmicks and imagery, this isn't ability
They barely stand on their own two, I got infinite stability
The difference admittedly is minimally in your favour
The thinnest paper, while I got the flavour to stimulate ya
Senses and integrate the presence in every sentence
So I harness life essence and kept my blessings as lessons
My tolerance overloads, emcees are over-exposed
Can't get over themselves like females can't get over clothes
Hip Hop is overdosed like here we over rose this distortion now
Every arsehole got an opinion but it's mainly shit talking
I break new ground where many fall short of the high land, they tir-an
Missed the point like saying ""It's that way"" to a blind man
Fucked if I'ma by-stand while my cultures choking fast
My tolerance is wearing thin, man they treading on broken glass

Why? Why?
Tell me why-hy
Tell me why these emcees try-y-y
Why? Why?
Tell me why-hy
Tell me why these emcees try-y-y

I'm reaching the threshold of my tolerance levels...
Cause you might...
Weather the storm but you can't stand the rain boy
Gets played like a game boy
I'll make you FUCKING SUFFER like my name boy
Hey boy, what you got there? Is that a microphone?
Well two's company so why not leave me and the mic alone?
Fighting clones, shit they lack, I'm walking on their grave when
Alone on this mic so no one else is on my wavelength
Gave strength to the weak, gave breath to the breathless
You can take it to the street but it's like playing in asbestos
Test us, like you're holier than thou, lose control of ya bounce
Pack up your suitcase and fold up your blouse
We all in the house, like home-arrest, I'm known to stress
So show your best flow and let's see my next rhyme blow your chest
Open like a surgeon's scalpel, I'll leave you hurt and doubtful
Of your words cause this is murder in a mouthful
Suffa bring disaster from within, hear the laughter from my kin
I'll leave you with the Hoods logo plastered, crafted in your skin
Step and bust, but realise there's no stopping us
So watch your whole crew get fucked like my dick was filled with phosphorus

Why? Why?
Tell me why-hy
Tell me why these emcees try-y-y
Why? Why?
Tell me why-hy
Tell me why these emcees try-y-y

I've been busting raps since the days of fat laces
There's a lot of new rappers, but they're not Fatfaces
They're disgraces, they could never be compared to me
""Flak are they really that bad?"" Well I'm prepared to see
I'll be at their stage show waiting in the front row
And if they try and diss I'm gonna stop their flow
Like cholesterol in the arteries and shit in the S bend
I'll rattle their whole crew and scull back the west end
I'm destined to be known for ripping the microphone
Try and bite like a clone, that'll never be condoned
I've shown some restraint but now I've reached the edge
Of my tolerance level, so it's you I'm gonna sledge
I pledge allegiance to Australia, I'm a true Aussie rhymer
Mate your raps stink more, than a prostitute's vagina
I find your accents laughable to say the least
You're far from honour with a life betting on junior treats fool

Tell me why! I'm sick of misfits, I'm sick of twits
I'm sick of internet gits that choke on microphone, miss
From gargling piss, of their message board buddies
They should be writing real raps, instead of uni studies
I'm throwing stubbies, in their general direction
They can only battle us, when they pass our introspection
Neglection, is the sole reason for this fake fate
When the quality of life depends on board rate
And E-mates, who's reality revolves around
Incoming attachments and mp3 sounds
They think they're bound for infinite glory
But have got a multiple-choice perspective on this story
""One"" They go back to where they came from
""Two"" They study explosives then drop bombs
""Three"" They learn to stand up, fight and terrify
""Bitch"" They look me in the eye and tell me why

Why? Why?
Tell me why-hy
Tell me why these emcees try-y-y
Why? Why?
Tell me why-hy
Tell me why these emcees try-y-y",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-tolerance-levels-lyrics
What the Seasons Change,"Left Foot, Right Foot",2001,"I once knew this man who was cursed from birth
Destined to stagger throughout life just to earn his worth
In one turn of the earth this story takes its place
Upon the summer shores of nowhere the place that he makes
His home, he returns alone from a long day
Having lost his job and soon his house and fiancé
The wrong way to turn was the path that he took
He pissed his savings up the wall and on the grass he was hooked
The past that he took for granted had messed with his sight
See he missed the finer points such as lessons in life
It was his wed-to-be wife that brought the cool in his heart
And by the time the autumn came, things were falling apart
Things were falling apart
Things were falling apart
Things were falling apart

So now he's standing in the Dole queue
This girl with the face of an angel
Says he's looking down, but she has a way to sustain all
It comes in a powdered form and it's good for healing scars
But healing scars comes at the cost of robbing tills and stealing cars
Feeling far from obliged he follows her lead
Down a beaten path where the homeless wallow in seed
Swallows his need for pride, he can't hold his thin weight
So finds himself in a church to control his intake
Being judged by this father for tryna pave his way
He looks him in the eyes and asks, ""How's your faith these days?""
""I strive for betterment"", he replies in tones with sentiment
""But I lost all faith in this God that I once saw heaven sent""
He never meant to destroy all the things that he came across
It's the sour taste of defeat on the street now all aim is lost
The pain and cost, for his mistakes
But never even really a sinner, huh, it's gonna be a long winter
It's gonna be a long winter
It's gonna be a long winter

His frail body shudders as the winter wind passes through him
Thinking of all the people in his past that knew him that shaft or screwed him
His heart is brewing for knowing what he must do
Is seek shelter and aid from the love he once knew
One last shot for courage hits him then his eyes are blood red
Inside he sees a man living the life he once led
Forfeits in to the anger and torture within
He decides to pay back mankind for her sins
Jumps in his stolen car, grabs a needle from the glove box
Deciding that he never even really knew what love was
He kicks in the front door to catch 'em havin' sex
Slams him to the floor then stabs her in the neck
She kicks and she screams so he beats her till she's slack-mouthed
Realising what he's done he stands dumbfounded, smacked out
Blacks out, awakens in a holding cell
Knowing he can't see hope, tomorrow is spring
Time for regrowth
Time for regrowth
Time for regrowth

So with the first light of spring an officer removes his chains
His mood is pained as he re-enters the world, his vision true again
Takes a step and says in a defiant statement
""Anything lost can be found again except for time wasted""
He's right adjacent on a path to heal himself
Kicks the habit before he kills himself and feels his health
Returning, the mental and physical his intention to kick it all
Though his struggle with prevention is visible
Redemption isn't all it's cracked up to be
He decides as he dreams of smacking up a key
On the brink of life or loss, not knowing what he's holding
So before he fucks it up again somebody should have told him

No matter your status, fact is we all been humbled
No matter the foundation all solid things can crumble
No matter the strength or length something's sustained
It never stays the same, that simply put: the seasons change
No matter your status, fact is we all been humble (Uh)
No matter the foundation all solid things can crumble
No matter the strength or length something's sustained
It never stays the same...
That's simply what the seasons change",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-what-the-seasons-change-lyrics
When I'm,"Left Foot, Right Foot",2001,"It's mad hot in the club
But that's cool 'cause outside couldn't get any colder
As soon as I walk in I feel a tap on my shoulder
It's Mr. Annoying, he wants to talk and test my patience
How the hell am I gonna get out of this conversation?
Umm, I gotta go man, my girl's waiting at the car
(Hey where you going?) I'm heading straight for the bar
I walk past some guy who smells like he hasn't had a shower
I make it to the front just in time for happy hour
And Flak sits down and drinks till it looks like he might fall flat
While me and Baz get down with chicks that think that they all that
Candy for your thoughts, a dollar if you'll creep with me
""Hang on I'll get my wallet"", I got 100 if you'll sleep with me
That chick was like Bardot, ""Why's that?"" Cause she's poison
Oi Baz, we better chill, look at the size of her boyfriend
It's Mr. Annoying, I bet he wants to talk again
There's some chicks by the door and Dymes is, chicken hawking

When I'm in the club, I'll be singing Planet Rock

When I'm at the bar, come and give a pound
When I'm at the bar, you know I'm known to flow
I'll have the girl's parents singing out no no no!


One man offers me a smoke, I grab it and take a drag
Then he offers rocket fuel, out of a brown paper bag
""It smells ill"" Man I wouldn't drink, that if you boiled it
The promoter's blacking out cause some kid's tagged the toilet
Ohhh shit, here comes security ""What you trying to do to me?""
Why pat me down and try to sweat me bro?
Just get me off the ground and let me go
We're all here to have a good time, that's why the kid's came
I'm talking to some guy that can't remember his name
I turn off, sit back and let the hip-hop relax me
Some guy drops his drink and the whole crowd's yelling taxi
Max checks the bartender's arse as she cleans up the glass
We'll be drinking till closing, we'll be the last of the last
To leave, some guy tugs on my sleeve and starts quoting Hoods' rhymes
Next he's on the decks, and he's cutting up good times
Now the crowd erupts, feeling the vibe that we love
But it's as loud as fuck, even from outside of the club
(We're going) I was getting bored anyway
Who cares, I hate clubs, give me a pub any day

When I'm in the club, I'll be singing Planet Rock
When I'm in the club, I'll be drinking slamming shots
When I'm in the club, you can find me at the bar

'Cause I'm too bad with names to make new friends, and
I'm too opinionated to keep my mouth shut
I'ma turn the world upside down and put the south up
On top of this, we rocking this 'cause I ain't got nothing else

Bleeding out my personality all over the wax

Chase That Feeling,State of the Art,2009,"She’s young, lithe and homely, wise by no means
Known one guy, she's for his eyes and only
He's a lying phoney, leaves crying, lonely
Separates the pain by staying high and though she
Might just O.D., high price to go free
This ain't living, listen, it's dying slowly
(It's got a hold on me) She can chase that feeling
(It's got a hold on me) Don’t chase that feeling like

I've been looking for
A thing that's good for the rich
Yeah, the blind and the poor
Things that I've, been looking for
A thing that's good for the rich
Yeah, the blind and the poor

Sometimes I feel we strive for a life of apathy
Callous deeds, other mindless acts of greed
Ain't jack for free, I think they'd try a tax to breathe
It’s like we fight to remind us that we bleed
I take flight in the night from lack of sleep
'Cause peace of mind's the only time that we’re free
(It's got a hold on me) And I’ma chase that feeling
(It's got a hold on me) We all chase that feeling

It’s like they try to build you up to watch it all collapse
You try climb out the pit, they’ll try claw you back
Like back in the factory, we packing the shelves
It was hell 'cause the foreman was always harassing me
Like, ""How’s your little old music thing going?""
Now I’m like, ""How’s your bitter old loser shit going?""
And I’m right (It's got a hold on me), and I’ma chase that feeling
(It's got a hold on me) I’ma chase that feeling like

I've been looking for
A thing that's good for the rich
Yeah, the blind and the poor
Things that I've, been looking for
A thing that's good for the rich
Yeah, the blind and the poor

And I'ma chase that feeling
Take that pain and replace that feeling
And I’m a take that healing then
Stand so tall they’ll have to raise that ceiling, man

From a young age I was making my mark, chasing my start
Forever ain't enough when you're state of the art
Fuck the haters that had said I’d never make it this far
It’s the pavers that I’d tread to dedicate to my craft
I’ve tailored every thread to bear the shape of my heart
Treating every breath as my first and day as my last
(It's got a hold on me) I still chase that feeling
(It's got a hold on me) Yeah, I still chase that feeling

I ride the rails of a vinyl track
Fall into a trance and there ain't no climbing back
Sit and lose myself in all the hidden loops
They're like forbidden fruits, I'm like, ""Can I get a bite of that?""
Gin and juice, I get loose and I write a track
Shivers down my spine, feeling more like a spinal tap
(It’s got a hold on me) And I’ma chase that feeling
(It’s got a hold on me) I'ma chase that feeling like

I've been looking for
A thing that's good for the rich
Yeah, the blind and the poor
Things that I've, been looking for
A thing that's good for the rich
Yeah, the blind and the poor

And I'ma chase that feeling
Take that pain and replace that feeling
And I’m a take that healing then
Stand so tall they’ll have to raise that ceiling, man

At the start of the summer, I'ma
Come to life and have the heart of a hummingbird
And I can hear the drummer
She’s so ugly but I’m so in love with her
(Wake up) Roll out of bed, throw on some roll-on
Roll up to the studio, it’s got a (Hold on me)

Chris Farley pissed, party on like the bombs dropped
So if you're (drunk on Friday night) you know what's what
And if you're feeling like (bluuugh), you know what's what

I wanna go it like Biggie and Pac
No gun fire, I'm talking rum and dry, hit me with shots
Tequila and scotch, I'll wind up on the idiot box
At six o' clock with a grand tucked into my socks
My obituary notice will say that most of my days
Were spent inside a bottle and a toast will be raised
Until conspiracy theories say they know I'm okay
I'll drop seven more albums by my ghost from the grave

I wanna die in Memphis like Elvis
Senseless on the toilet pissing on my own pelvis
Helpless, choking on vodka and shellfish
Get found by my girl like, ""God, you're so selfish""
Well-wishers at my wake saying he’ll be well missed
But wait till they're well pissed, they'll wish me to hell with
Everybody that I wanted to party with anyway
Don't care if it's a hundred and ninety degrees centigrade

Like Jim Morrison, I wanna party till my heart stop
Tripping in a bath with a stripper and a glass of
Liquor in my grasp, man I figure that my last of
Days should be crazed I'mma live it till I’m passed on
If any grief is shed, leave it said
I'd remind them of just how far the dream has led
So when it’s time for me, be finally relieved I’m dead
I want to exit how I entered – between some legs

I wanna bender like Hendrix, blend six liquors with ten drinks
Ten-four buddy, well it’s like ten-six
Yo, when it's ten-sixteen in the morning, my girl will send
Sixteen messages to me warning
We’ll be ex's if I don’t exit, so exit
The next shit's getting called a sexist at breakfast so let’s get
Our phones and all set 'em to flight mode
And let the horns fly through the hook and take us right home

I wanna party like Bon Scott on Charlie, Bob Marley non-stop

To be on your own
On a bender like a Rolling Stone?

Australian hip-hop but not kangaroos
Change the game a little, rearrange the rules

My final four defeats sweet sixteens like March Madness
It's not passive, so ravenous
This collaborative effort is not average
It's magnanimous, thus
My little crew got loose screws, these dudes will put two in your cabbage

Apocalypse now, we’re not with this monotonous sound

Rockin' a crowd, droppin' this like ""Who's not with us now, huh?""

Dude that just threw us off the back of a tour bus?

They ain't actually dope, they're high on cannabis smoke
I'm still the man if I don't blow a grand on a rope
'Cause fortune favours the brave, that's why these rappers are broke, huh

Fifty in Five,State of the Art,2009,"Terror cleared the skyline and anger clouded judgement
So they spent a thousand nighttimes in the desert fighting something
That they couldn't find, that made it something that they couldn't fight
Left us lamenting all the wrongs that they couldn't right
This is for the second time, we've been here before
From Vietnam to Saddam, we always needin' a war
Neo-conservatives rose up like Viet Cong
Their fingers on the trigger, we won't be here for long
They killed MLK and they named a day after him
They killed JFK and named an airport after him
Some guy shot a monster called Reagan so he could bone
A girl named Jodie Foster, if only he'd known
We tested nukes in the atmosphere, the sea and the dirt
And they tested all these missiles just to see if they worked
Now France got 'em, Russia got 'em, India and Pakistan
Korea want 'em
, States want 'em pointed at the Taliban
Iran and Afghanistan, sands of the Arab lands
Orders from portable commands in armoured caravans
Internet, 3G cellular phones

Bundy,
 
Gacy,
 
Son of Sam
Macarena

Superman

Chicken Dance

Running Man
Generation X and Generation Y
And the generation next will degenerate and die

Elvis died, Hendrix died, Lennon died

All's fair in love and war, more work for the pallbearer
More terror, more unjust search and seizures

Quakes in Iran, Japan and California
Greenhouse gas turned the world into a sauna
The trauma of mortars, martyrs, slaughters
Of partners, mourners, fathers and daughters
They chased us, caught us, numbered us to sort us
Raped us, scorned us, to break us they bought us
Third world kidneys for captains of industry
Uprising in the street, corruption in the ministry
A blowjob brought about the fall of a dynasty
And MP3s saw the fall of an industry
Doubled population
, halved accommodation
Carved up resources and we starved the poorer nations
Beirut, Chechnya, all hell broke loose
Berlin, nineteen-eighty-nine man, the wall fell
Cold war ended but that didn't stop more shells
Waco lit up the sky like burnin' oil wells
A world laid waste with addiction
Tell Orwell truth's always stranger than fiction
Big Brother's on closed circuit TV and on cable
Reality's now scripted, celebrities for sale
Jeopardy and jail, seized, deposed
Remedies and penalties for failed CEOs
We had the Enron collapse and white-collar crime
Investors they were taxed a dollar for a dime
The blue chip companies and 
blue-sky mines
We no longer choose sides, we choose sidelines
Rich bleeding the kind, blind leading the blind
And history repeats, no competing with time
Gasses eating the minds of the vets that they bring home
The plague of Agent Orange
, 
Gulf War syndrome
Soldiers sent home, post-traumatic stress leave
STDs 'cause the sleeve ain't sexy
AIDS shook the eighties, grim reaper with a bowling ball
Metallica ""Kill 'Em All""
, 
let God scold 'em all
The Guildford Four,
 
Chicago Seven
Mumia,
 
Mandela,
 
Ocean's Eleven
Half past twelve
 on Friday the Thirteenth
Dawn of the Dead, A Nightmare on Elm Street
Weapons free environment, war zone, phone home
Melanoma grow as we soak in the ozone
Home-grown, Hydro, cocaine, Nitro
Werewolf in London
, American Psycho
Check, cyclones, 
bushfires
, Bush firing scuds
Baby boomers, Woodstock, what happened to the love?
What happened to the cubs? They fed 'em to the wolves
Set a trial for paedophiles, they let 'em in the schools
Set 'em on the students, turned 'em on the kids
And everyone responsible should burn for what they did
And if they try to deny then an eye for an eye
The government and church on which we try to rely
Both rob us till it hurts chasing lie after lie
Like astronauts chasin' a pie in the sky
They landed on the moon but can't seem to return there
Makes some question if they ever really were there
And if they were there now and they looked back
Could we look them in the eye, could we look back?
'Cause when we look back at what we have done
Can you believe what we have become?

And as we walk into the sun
Can you believe what we have become?
As we walk into the sun",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-fifty-in-five-lyrics

My words ring true, so until the end of the marriage
Cutting my neck from my back is the only severance package
For this veteran that is blessed and possessed with the language
In a profession that takes less than a second for Pressure to vanish
I scream vocals clear in the hope you're hearing your host
Less we choke in fear of the smoke and the mirrors
This scene is on fire,
 feeding my bleeding desire
So when P's behind the wheel indeed you'll need to retire
Cause I'm a ""Hillatoppa"", 
breath no less than seventy proof
Yeah, we connect with the youth when my left is caressing your tooth
Invested in confessing the truth, the proof, my sweat in the booth
Hang around, this is ending with your neck in a noose
So move back, call truce, retract (move back)
We're too fat to fall through the cracks
And I never had quitting in mind, sick of my rhyme?
Slit your wrist and consider this the finishing line

I'm a ""Hillatoppa"" filled with vodka and vinegar
Mocking you miniatures, more props than Bollywood cinema (last call)
Me and P will be drunk all summer
Jim Carey, Jeff Daniels, call us drunk and dumber
People are starving and they're putting Lamborghini doors on a fucking Hummer?
Give some to the funky drummer
And I'll ride this beat like a drunken lover
With no fucking rubber and I fucking love her

Last Confession,State of the Art,2009,"Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord

This will be my last confession
This industry can leave harsh impressions
I have little faith, forgive me for my past discretions
But we live and learn that history and past are lessons
The day this is work, the love of it dies
A handful make it, the others will strive
And hunger can drive hatred but such is just life
I guess jealousy's the curse that the struggle inspires
These critics seek to break and divide
I know I'm bitter but my faith is divine
Take it in stride, yeah I act like I hate it at times
But I found love through this music and a place to reside
For every friend, I have an eager opponent
For every cent I spent on meagre components
I gave something back so I don't feel the need for atonement
Cause we all get our hands dirty when we're seizing the moment
And we always took the lead, peers would follow
And paid for everything that we cleared or borrowed
If my son can benefit from what you see here, my sorrow's
Justified, just that I might not be here tomorrow

When it rains, it pours, when you're soaked and the world
Tries to fuck with ya, trust in ya own and yourself
My biggest fear's to die not knowing you well
And I ain't afraid to die, I'm afraid of going to hell
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord

This will be my last confession
Liberty can leave harsh impressions
I have little faith, forgive me for my past discretions
But we live and learn that history and past are lessons
I've always played the hand I was given
No exceptions here, humanity's driven
You see all men are born equal, just the standard of living
That differs between the Jewish, Adriatic and Christian
I'm a logical man given to science
Forgive me, I know religion inspires
But too many have government and political ties
And use state of the art warfare to bridge their divides
There's hate crime wars on daytime talks
And rape trials walk in state wide courts
We don't pray no more, we only break thy laws
So what this world don't give us, we gon' take by force
Assertion, aggression's, murder then vengeance
We treat peace like it's a term of acceptance
Exception, we're not accepting if we're searching for penance
And so these words are for my son so he can learn from my lessons

When it rains, it pours, when you're soaked and the world
Tries to fuck with ya, trust in ya own and yourself
My biggest fear's to die not knowing you well
And I ain't afraid to die, I'm afraid of going to hell
Oh Lord, oh Lord

Parade of the Dead,State of the Art,2009,"Quarter to midnight, a scene of slaughter, I'm in flight
Red running water getting caught in the rip tide
Cars out of order, man I thought I could hitchhike
Sporting a chainsaw for I'm avoiding a fist fight
The evacuation went ahead
But bullet fire caressed my head, I was left for dead
Awoke in hell and knowing well the Feds had fled
Before the sun set in red
The witching hour that approaches has a host of
Seven plagues, packs of locusts, rats and roaches
Fat and bloated corpses lacking focus
Trapped in the throws of attacking that that's closest
Legs aching from the pace that I'm running at
Death chasing, ain't safe till the sun is back
Escaping the cityscape like a lumberjack
My wake's the only way I'm coming back
The city outer limits, found a house in thickets
Heard a shout and a shot rang out to witness
The foulest dead, disembowelled with gizzards
Their rival is his final hour or minutes
Numb with fear, holding gun to ear
He said ""Run, it's clear till the sun appears
Tell my son his dear loving mum is near
See you in hell man, I'm done with here""

They built my city on top of a grave
Now the dead roam the street like a rotting parade
They poured gasoline on top of a lake
And then they set it on fire so nobody escaped
They built my city on top of a grave
Now the dead roam the street like a rotting parade
Quarantined and forgotten for days
These are the stories of those who have gotten away

I thought I might
Drown in sweat when I heard the sound effects
Of fingernails running down my fence
Was it rioters, rats or malcontents?
I pulled my blinds back a crack like Malcolm X
The scene was sirens, violence, car alarms
My neighbour waving from his yard with half an arm
Vietnam in the suburbs,
 
the walking dead
""Burning Down the House"" like Talking Heads
A city on fire, not a city of god
A city that hides from a hideous mob
The zombie flicks, man I've seen 'em a lot
Enough to know when it's time to get the fuck out of dodge
Uh, only packed the necessities
Toothbrush, porno, souped-up weaponry
And just for the fun of it, I stole my neighbour's Hummer
Put spikes out the side and tied a chainsaw to the front of it

I cut up heads and shoulders, knees and toes
Knees and toes, knees and toes
I cut up heads and shoulders, knees and toes
Knees and toes, knees and toes

They built my city on top of a grave
Now the dead roam the street like a rotting parade
They poured gasoline on top of a lake
And then they set it on fire so nobody escaped
They built my city on top of a grave
Now the dead roam the street like a rotting parade
Quarantined and forgotten for days
These are the stories of those who have gotten away

""Runnin' mad wild 'cause death was my style""
""Keep your eyes open"" ""They looking for the killer""

Rent Week,State of the Art,2009,"We twist the lock like Ramirez
: grab it and push
Dragging a foot like cavemen 
dragging a bush
No money, no rent, no way, no bed
Moved out, I’m on the couch, top to toe with the Vents
It’s drinking all week, it’s all of the money off the tour
It’s rinse and repeat, given the Oars dis' for the morgue
It’s spinning the beats drunk till sun like Gary Busey
Suck up and say “Babe”, till she’s saying “That’ll do pig”

There's Suffa in the city skip then I had a bad pinger
Now I’m in the gutter, fuckin' broke, 
puff a smoke from a Winnie Cigar
Rhyme my blow last, but a jug glass
Other lines of coke, give my liver time to soak
Bon Scott, kind of bloke, passed out in the car
I’m the son cast out from the farm
Hear this blast out from the calm like a child squealing
Pass the bottle, 
we could chase that feeling

I’m sorry that I’m drunk, I’m sorry that I went on
I’m sorry that I’m broke and that I spent all the rent
But that’s me and that’s all I’ll ever be
There’s some things, some things that I’ll never be
I’m sorry that I’m drunk, I’m sorry that I went on
I’m sorry that I’m broke and that I spent all the rent
But that’s me and that’s all I’ll ever be
There’s some things, some things that I’ll never be

Bank account overdrawn sheet, over this
Passed out on the lawn getting poked by the neighbour’s kids
With sticks
, pockets and wallet, moths and lint
Rent money, that’s gone, yeah I know where it is
I took it to the bar, and I invested in me
At the gentleman’s club, in the stripper’s G
You gotta see the bigger picture, a financial lesson
I put it back in the economy to fight the recession

You know the score in the morning, man, it's boring, you're yawning
Do you wanna see that girl's dress on the floor in the morning?
Nah, I got a girl, but if she let all of these whores in
I’d have four in the mornin', pawin' and clawin' at four in the mornin'
Stealin' and pourin' till I don’t know the ceilin' from floor and
If I’m kneelin' or crawlin', lost my keys in an all-in brawl
So, when they're done knockin' on my door
Like a Mormon at three in the morning, like…

I’m sorry that I’m drunk, I’m sorry that I went on
I’m sorry that I’m broke and that I spent all the rent
But that’s me and that’s all I’ll ever be
There’s some things, some things that I’ll never be
I’m sorry that I’m drunk, I’m sorry that I went on
I’m sorry that I’m broke and that I spent all the rent
But that’s me and that’s all I’ll ever be
There’s some things, some things that I’ll never be

Molly says Matt lives
 here but every pay day
It’s like Jack lives here with six cases of beer
I’m a slave to the bottle, bro, ain't changed
You can find my name under “Do not serve” at my Bottle-O
(Shit) Ain’t even like my rent’s steep
Only like four bottles or one ninety a week
Tell my landlord his check will be there in spirit
On my to-do list with Jack, Johnny and Chivas

If sleep is the cousin of death
Then passed out is the step brother, drunk and a mess
With rum on his breath, guzzling a tonne of regrets
And neither cousin will be coming until nothing is left
Money’s like a new album, I hold it then drop it
Now either there’s a hole in my pocket or someone’s
Stolen my wallet, it pays interesting girls, the more you earn
The more you lose, we live in the most simplest of worlds

I’m sorry that I’m drunk, I’m sorry that I went on
I’m sorry that I’m broke and that I spent all the rent
But that’s me and that’s all I’ll ever be
There’s some things, some things that I’ll never be
I’m sorry that I’m drunk, I’m sorry that I went on
I’m sorry that I’m broke and that I spent all the rent
But that’s me and that’s all I’ll ever be
There’s some things, some things that I’ll never be

Fresh off tour and I’m broke in both sense of the word
Till X got rent and it went to the birds
I spent it on her, went to the bar
And the rest in the breath test machine cause I’m taking the car
Uh, Marcelo beat that will keep me from going under
Yeah, that’s wicked and all, just give me Trigger’s number, brother
No doubting about the way that I feel
Because dirty money’s still paying my bills, and that’s real",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-rent-week-lyrics
She's So Ugly,State of the Art,2009,"What's the name? Uh

Hillatoppa, Hilla, Hilla, Hillatoppa
Finish off a fifth of vodka, light it up and spit it on ya
Man me and P-Dela got a hella proper flow
See what I'm saying like a teleprompter
And you could never stop us (fucking posers!)
Appetite for destruction like Guns N' Roses
We come like Moses, down from the Hilltop
A pain killer pill popper, brain killer, slurring like
Haim,
 still a threat when we fill up a field
Like an open air opera, sample a snare off a vinyl
They wanna take a piece like a sharecropper, stifle
Creativity, and its not fair fuckers!
Before you try this just know that you'd have better luck
Tryna stare off a man with no eyelids
This is a rare offer so take advantage
A carnival of carnage climbing out your garbage (here we come)
Man we're off the hook like a carcass
These bastards try and sell shares off an artist
Fuck your share offer, cause we're off the map
And we can't be bought with any fair offer
Matter of fact fuck unfair offers, can't be bought
What the pair offer can't be taught
I used to love her then they kidnapped her
Dragged her through the streets and they shaved her fucking hair off her

""...that ugly broad""
""Hey, man""
""Ain't you going to say hello to your old lady?""
""Watch out, now, watch out.""
""That bitch is too ugly for you to say hello to in public""

And she's so ugly
The music's asking why he don't love me
You've been used by too many guys
And now I can't look you in the eye, but when I met her
I was like she's so lovely
And she said ""I'd let him cut me"", but now it's like
You've been used by too many guys
And now I can't look you in the eye, I wish I never met her

This ain't life in the fast lane
This is hard rain, soaking and knowing you missed the last train
This ain't a date for the day
It's made that it stays timeless, they'll never take that away
This ain't glamour and shine, cameras, dimes
It's me handling mine in hazardous times
This ain't love and romance, it's hate, gluttons and antics
Paint brushing the canvas, ain't nothing attractive
So fuck a makeover, can't take the weight like a pay loader
Then we throw ya to the flamethrower
This ain't silver lined clouds
It's real and right now for the crowd to put a meal in my mouth
This ain't a beautiful temptress, nor a youthful apprentice
In the cubical doing usual stretches
It's ugly and ravished, hungry and damaged
But she's mine and the only thing that loves me that matters

Hip hop right now she's an ugly bitch
Hip hop right-/-right-/-right now
She's an u-/-an ug-/-an ugly bitch

And she's so ugly
The music's asking why he don't love me
You've been used by too many guys
And now I can't look you in the eye, but when I met her
I was like she's so lovely
And she said ""I'd let him cut me"", but now it's like
You've been used by too many guys
And now I can't look you in the eye, I wish I never met her

Check it out!
This music shit's getting so ugly
So ring the alaaaaaaarm!

Still Standing,State of the Art,2009,"It's been so long, we're glad we came
Before we gathered fame or had a name
Our story hasn't changed with accolades
We're still standing, and we'll be back again
It's been so long, we're glad we came
Before we gathered fame or had a name
Our story hasn't changed with accolades
We're still standing, and we'll be back again

Standing in line, fifteen, couldn't wait
Couldn't fathom any talent in rhyme
Had to get mine, granted in mind
Was my rappin' that I thought would never happen in time
Odds stacked to reject us, attackin' the hecklers
Reckless with rap till they had to respect us
Laid tracks, never asked for jack for my efforts
'Cause everything we do comes back to affect us
And as long as I got lungs, I'ma say this
Long as we get love, we got some that will hate us
We'll never change, it's done for the faithless
And I don't care for favourites on somebody's playlist
Ain't enough paper for the names I gotta mention
Without 'em, no way I would've made it a profession
I wouldn't trade it for a day of my obsession
We're staying dedicated to perfection

It's been so long, we're glad we came
Before we gathered fame or had a name
Our story hasn't changed with accolades
We're still standing, and we'll be back again
It's been so long, we're glad we came
Before we gathered fame or had a name
Our story hasn't changed with accolades
We're still standing, and we'll be back again

""I'm still standing""
 Fuck it, one of us had to
Though I'm not standing still like a statue
Man, I can tighten loops like a lasso, you see my
Blood runs blue like I cut up a tattoo
It's ironic, some say it's even confusin' that I'm
Still standing 'cause I'm keepin' it movin' and I'm
Still champion, we keep on improvin' 
and I'm
Main Source man, I'm breakin' and movin' atoms
What we spit is absurd
Since a kid, I've always loved the rhythm of words, the
Beauty of language and spewing the anguish all
Over the canvas like the riff was a curb
Now if you live by the word, you die by the pen
The critics can criticise but we're the crème de la crème
Me and P-Dela, we blend what they're callin' the standard
Still standing while they're screamin', ""When will it end?""

It's been so long, we're glad we came
Before we gathered fame or had a name
Our story hasn't changed with accolades
We're still standing, and we'll be back again
It's been so long, we're glad we came
Before we gathered fame or had a name
Our story hasn't changed with accolades
We're still standing, and we'll be back again

The whole crowd's like...
How long you been here? ""I've been here for years""
How long you been here? ""I've been here for years""
How long you been here? ""I've been here for years""
How long you been here? ""I've been here for years""

Super Official,State of the Art,2009,"Wassup? You miss us?
Mr Debris say hi
""Hello, hello, hello—hello, hello, hello""
We are of course representin' mighty, mighty Hilltop
I'm Mr Suffa, first up to bat
We got P-Delaressure...

I've been earning my stripes till I'm perfect when I'm working the mic
And I've been serving the type of words that murder insights
This ain't an urge, it's for life, what I recite furthers the fight
A service for the circus that occurs in the night
So put your money where your mouth is, we're doing it now
Golden Era's let loose on the prowl, loosen the noose so you're down
We're here to take back what used to be ours
So make your last words count like grooms choosing their vows
It's more than just timing (why?), the sport of slaughter with rhyming
Of course if I'm writing my name upon your corpse it's a signing
There's hoards of them vibing, smiling at the thought of us dying
The water that's rising ain't the shore, it's more of your crying
Jealous cause we striving and inspired by truths, they know
Nothing bout surviving with the times and the news, and whole
Image is a lie and didn't like that my crew's
Got our own sneaker, feel free to walk a mile in my shoes
Hip Hop's in hard times, if it's said that time is money
Then I'll be paying dues until I hit the red
Is it dead? Or is it just the picture, which you're fed?
Write rhymes with your heart and do your business with your head
If you ever bought Pressure a beer, let it be clear
It was a blessing but I'm stressing I'll be dead in a year
Forgetting my fears for the blood, sweat and the tears
Eff a career, I'll be left with the respect of my peers

Girl for one night, we'll get drunk right?
And we'll get tongue tied till we puke together
... Bitch! Big Lebowski, that rug tied the room together
Howl at the moon together like Ozzy Osbourne on tour
In Rio with Ronny James Dio on the encore
They want a Funkoar, they wanna hold a mirror
To ninety-four, they want a golden era
They wanna golden shower so I'mma give 'em
Sid Vicious, spit vicious (you cut me off like circumcision)
It's just how I'm living so adjust how you listen
To the music, then you should be touched, now I'm driven
Ain't the same old, lame old, take it in the a-hole
Payola, payroll, dude shut your cakehole
This is soul like watching some day old
Paint on a train roll by as the rain fall
And it's so beautiful it's painful, it's sweet sickness
Like picturing the rest of your life with a girl you've known
For three minutes, and proposing in a day and a half
What we're composing here's state of the art
It weighs heavy on your brow like a crown of thorns
And that's when we break it down man, sound the horns
Now reborn, work hard, eat lunch in the car
But man we play hard, Braveheart drunk in a bar
We're here to take heart, we're making music that's honest man
The movement's upon us like some rebels moving through in the forest
Carrying a torch to burn Babylon
For every musician a label ever put a saddle on

What we're doing here is crazy
""In case you haven’t heard, my ways are international""

What we're doing here is crazy
If you ain't up on this then you ain't up on shit

The Light You Burned,State of the Art,2009,"I thought we had
Such a good thing going, yeah
Now the light you burned
Is dying out so slowly
I thought we had
Such a good thing going, yeah
Now the light you burned
Is dying out so slowly

For starters, I ain't heartless, I don't hate them
But I was starving and parted our relations
I never live in the past like the forsaken
I was ill, you were never the master of your patience
We were martyrs for this mayhem
Now you're passing your arse out to artists for replacements
I know it's harder to father than to make friends
But you see I'm proud regardless of where my day ends
It was a task to ask you just to pay rent
And you laughed cause my heart was in the basement
Never targeted the market just to make ends
Wasn't all scars, there were parts of it that made sense
Walking away were the hardest conversations
Hope you learned if you're smart you shouldn't date friends
And I still don't understand you
So I gotta say fuck you, thank you, huh, c'mon

I thought we had
Man, I thought that we had!
Such a good thing going, yeah
But we don't, but we don't, but we don't
Now the light you burned
Now the light that you burned
Is dying out so slowly
And we go, and we go, and we go

Must be hard trying to keep the facade
Here we are, you nothing, me needing a laugh
Went from driving to not even a seat in the car
Still lying now to kissing every cheek of my arse
From family tree to just another leaf in the park
Hope these bright ideas help you see in the dark
It's like first you say nothing, second you blame others
Third, burn the bridge like the first Rage cover
See they don't know and they never will what we've been through
It's not you, it's me, nope it's you
I've got a lot of love for things you did
If it only added up to them things you missed
Guess that's it, heard that you were running with him
Saw you settled down now and had a couple of kids
Shit, the world keeps spinning like a bottle top
See the light you burned started something that I ain't gonna stop

I thought we had
Man, I thought that we had!
Such a good thing going, yeah
But we don't, but we don't, but we don't
Now the light you burned
Now the light that you burned
Is dying out so slowly
And we go, and we go, and we go

What a soulful old anthem
You used to burn brighter, now you couldn't hold a lighter to a lantern
Went from fighter to a phantom
Invited inside of my life but you a bantam-
Weight, with some heavyweight issues
Had to separate with you, get you heavy-grade tissues
For all your mood swings, so not amusing
You could blow the rock out a mood ring
You can blow the rocks and the tubing
Man, you can go super ho the block for a shoestring
Budget, for all I care and this is what I got
For all my caring? So fuck it!
Nah, I ain't sleeping on the couch, you can sleep on the carpet
I'ma take the bed and sleep like a starfish
Hog all the blankets and sleep off the Lagers
And wake up in the morning like we feeling marvellous

I thought we had
Man, I thought that we had!
Such a good thing going, yeah
But we don't, but we don't, but we don't
Now the light you burned
Now the light that you burned
Is dying out so slowly
And we go, and we go, and we go

""Things change and days turn to nights""
""You wanna hate me then hate me""
""Things change""
""If you only—if you only—if you only knew that""
""No turning back now"" ""Gone with the Wind""
""You wanna hate me then hate me""
""No turning back now""
""Things change"" ""That's that""

I thought we had
Man, I thought that we had!
Such a good thing going, yeah
But we don't, but we don't, but we don't
Now the light you burned
Now the light that you burned
Is dying out so slowly
And we go, and we go, and we go

Now the light you burned, going, yeah

The Return,State of the Art,2009,"Duck and cover
'Cause when you fuck with Suffa it’s like the bombs dropped
You spit like Bon Jovi, we spit like Bon Scott
We got it on lock: deadlock, non-stop head-nod
Even when the song stop
Step in the cypher and it’s danger
I'll set the Pressure on you like a hyperbaric chamber
And he don’t fuck around, we’ve gained such renown
For this state of the art custom sound
For them custom built rappers with underskilled narratives
The good die young, me and Suff are still bad with this
Rhyme style it’s lethal, prime time the sequel
Ain't got a single fan just like-minded people
I told you from the start, I’m a soldier of the art
Effortless, take every breathe and hold it to your heart
With Debris and my brother Suffa, so watch another sucker run for cover
It's the return of the motherfucking motherfuckers

I don't give a goddamn, listen, I don't know
(How many rhymes you got or who knows you kid)
I don't give a goddamn (on the shows you did)
(How many rhymes you got or who knows you kid)
I don't give a goddamn, listen, I don't know
(How many rhymes you got or who knows you kid)
Mr. Debris (blow the horns on 'em, not now but right now)

Obsessive compulsive, repulsive, insulting
Offensive like feeding a vegan some dolphin
Assaulting the system, a system that’s broken
The cistern is broken, the shit is just floating
I spit till your open underground
P-Dela-Ressure and he don’t fuck around
Now album number five, worked hard to earn that
No doubt it was a fight, too far to turn back
I step in the sun, take the weather however it comes
Although I’m a second son, I'm second to none
Lesson is done, what goes around comes around
Suffa’s down, and he don’t fuck around
The Hood spits the news like Wolf Blitzer, crews
Fear the pit bull in the pulpit, yo it’s the
World War Three in a whisper – the Mr Suffa
And Mr Pressure, we rips it rougher/we spits it fresher

I don't give a goddamn, listen, I don't know
(How many rhymes you got or who knows you kid)
I don't give a goddamn (on the shows you did)
(How many rhymes you got or who knows you kid)

"" the boys we got  coming through the windows. They're coming through the ceiling  coming from the floorboards man. Bring those boys down here. I want them on stage right now!""

Your nemesis on verses, the desperate and worthless
Try and flame the name we can wrestle in a furnace
Never came half-hearted, never came last started
Everyday like it’s my last till my craft’s mastered
And we can get it on
I’m at peace with myself cause there’s a piece of myself in every song
I don’t just write rhymes, I spent a life time building
A life line accommodating night times children
And now they love the sound, play me with a
Gravyspitter  and he don’t fuck around
Check, ain’t no stepping to me
Cause P and Suffa bad mutha’s like Treacherous Three
So (feel the heartbeat, feel the heartbeat)
You feel your hearts weak cause still you can’t beat
The Hills and aren’t we just still too rugged?
I can feel you love it, we the real blue blooded, c'mon!

I don't give a goddamn, listen, I don't know
(How many rhymes you got or who knows you kid)
I don't give a goddamn (on the shows you did)
(How many rhymes you got or who knows you kid)
I don't give a goddamn, listen, I don't know

I got Aussie purity like pollies got immunities
I only litter in public 'cause I'm creating employment opportunity
See I'm ya average fella, mate I have to tell ya
Ignorance is bliss until you listen to my acapella
I read them pictures in magazines, I dug the covers of books
I take hip-hop at face value, don't pay a cent for their looks
I see the scene's getting ugly, lucky we vision impaired
'Cause that image is skin-deep like the make-up they wear
I keep my ear to the streets and my hand on my wallet
I keep my feet on solid ground and keep searching for profit
For what it's worth I carried the weight till it practically kills
It's worth so little I can't afford my chiropractical bills
I'm actually ill, relax and chill, it's time to build
There ain't no scars this world can put on me that time won't heal

Tearing it up is easy fella, but can you put it back together?

Reverse a rhyme, factory line I'ma tear this mic apart (True)
And I'ma start by giving shouts to Nasty Arts
What's up troops? I split loops like Atoms
A girl like Eve's like fruit to Adam
So take a bite off it, if it's tight, knock it
This my stage sucker, get your mic off it (He said off it)
The force in my soul is sonic
My brain's a CPU, I'm simply 2-0 bionic (Who ya on it)
My man, just clap your hands for style
It's a free trip to Afghanistan, you don't want it
Like keep a priest in the bathroom, this shit is blessed
You couldn't bring it on if it gave you one and gave you its address
I give my boys your address and get your house plundered
Better call Wednesday ""four"", 'cause your days are numbered
Cut the record like lumber, full tilt boogie
Odds are on Suffa in the battle, ask your bookie

All on Me,The Calling,2003,"Yeah, it's ""All On Me"" with Pegasus
Hilltop Hoods and Layla
Coming for ya, 2002
Rock it

Brother don't waste time, feel the Suffa bassline
From St Kilda east to Deep Space Nine
Studied to be a funky technician like Marley Marl
Don't get it twisted 
I make punanis snarl with my foul sound
You play Polo, I play Pegz solo spellbound
Bow down to the story tellin' king son
Like the metal storm propelling at Big Pun
Rappers sell a mill with mainstream accolades
But never make a true classic like Jack of Spades
I'll rap for days, spot my aura in Torquay
Could desk snatch some of the greatest like 
Things get a little easier, ask Biz Mark
Once you learn to understand truth hits hard

Truth hits hard
Hilltop, Layla, Burn crew

My mind's numb from inhaling all them lies from you jerks
That's why the truth hurts like steppin' to Certified on my crew's turf
Beat biters make me sick, I hate this shit
Hip-hop's everyone's bitch, that's why we got a love-hate relationship
Next to Pressure, y'all went blank, you're just symmetrical
You bein' me's like Elton bein' heterosexual
So while you're sweatin' methanol I'm sweatin' tech electricals
That's why my waistline is measured in mega-decibels
Breakin' down the extra decimal, steppin' forwards
And stamp my mark on your ashes 'cause these rappers are so impressionable
I got time for MCs that's gettin' technical
See I'm an accepted person and it's less exceptional
Sick of diss tracks that these fakers make
When it comes to make or break they couldn't hold it down with a paperweight
Non-believers, I make 'em wait, if they still need proof
Ayy, Layla, it's all on you

So what now, it's on me? Talk about the pressure
I'm gonna take this opportunity to sever
Competitors, fuck 
The Never Ending Story
I just keep gettin' better and it's hard to abort me
You want my finest? I'll relieve you of your crisis
You can try this, but we'll be the deciphers
At least you know now where to go
To find what Certified is the hypest combo
I came over expectin' a suffering city
Found myself  MIDIs
It's a pity we all live interstate
Imagine if we didn't, the produce we could make
But it's all good, no one can get ahead of us
Russell up a goldmine with the Hoods or Pegasus
I'm ready for this much responsibility
I take control 'cause Suffa said it's on me

Uh, uh
The lyric that I spread's so smooth that Suffa's
Got Fabio saying, ""I can't believe it's not butter""
I can't believe you're not better, when you step you get stepped on
Hilltop's the name on honeys lips like Revlon
[Ad-Libs: Suffa & 
Pressure
]
You know what? 
What?
I'm not recording, man, I'm too tired
What are we gonna do?

Down for the Cause,The Calling,2003,"If someone you know sits in the room talking to the wall all day
Don’t be afraid, it probably means they went out and bought my tape
'Cause all it takes are these freshly chopped herbals
And I could rhyme in a language that translates crop circles
Controversial 'cause I contest commercial rappers
Jak is throwing bottles while they’re rolling in their convertibles
Don’t take it personal; I was born to burn you all
With words so berserk I’m forced to stay disguised like Serpico
The crime watcher, that’s right I watch crimes and laugh
And take my half of the profits after watching for cop cars
I can’t cooperate, only operate
Chase promoters for dough they owe us and take what’s in their bank

""People—people wanna see me get busy, 'cause I'm
Very, very dope and I’m freaking the funky ""
""People—people wanna see me get busy, 'cause I'm
Very, very dope and I’m freaking the funky ""

I’m down for the cause like suicide bombers
I made a life promise, pushing underground through city night commerce
It suddenly spread through these southernly treads
I got a beautiful mind it’s just stuck in an ugly head
I’m stunning with skill while some are run of the mill
We coming real, I’m from Adelaide, one in a mill
This underground’s broke by any means, we ain’t getting cream
Sweat the scene, I’ll burn you never-beens like Oxyacetylene
The larger a fools ego the harder they fall
So I drink till I can hardly recall the party at all
I’ve had enough; while they’re acting tough I’m acting up
I don’t put emcee’s under pressure, I ain’t into all that faggot stuff
This rhyme addiction’s so bad; I’m a go mad
And stick up emcee’s for their thoughts and add ‘em to my vocab
If life’s a bitch then death’s a slut
'Cause death comes for everyone, and when it’s you turn you’re fucked

""People—people wanna see me get busy, 'cause I'm
Very, very dope and I’m freaking the funky ""
""People—people wanna see me get busy, 'cause I'm
Very, very dope and I’m freaking the funky ""

I think I finally lost the plot, let’s have a round of applause
I’m down for the cause; I’m moving mountains, bouncing off walls
Rip countless cordless’s, confuse counsellors, talking shit
Forced to spit from now until I’m on stage with walking sticks
Depicted a portrait of a anti-corporate kid
Scared rappers get court orders against such rawness
I’m mad for life, in the club hand me the mic
I kick one verse and get myself banned for life
If these hecklers dissing when I’m standing on stage
I’m a call you out and show the true meaning of crowd participation
Rolling down the street I just slapped the shit of a groupie
And distract store managers while I’m stealing liquor and movies
Forever broke, no job, nowhere left to go
Jerry Springer comes on and I’ve already seen the episode
That’s when you know you’re really unemployed
Brain destroyed, step in to Centrelink and you see all your fucking boys

""People—people wanna see me get busy, 'cause I'm
Very, very dope and I’m freaking the funky ""
""People—people wanna see me get busy, 'cause I'm
Very, very dope and I’m freaking the funky ""

Emcee's claim they’re moving units, they serious? That’s not the fact though
The fact is, you couldn’t sell a burger to Fat Joe
Think your all of that (no), you’ll be falling back bro
Jack lives here, you call him Jack I call him fatso
I pack shows; slap foes like bitter defactos
Step on this mic, I’ll end your life like tobacco
My style’s more fatal than second hand medicine
I even bomb veterans; Hip Hop connects this world like Thomas Edison
Through lettering and underground peddling
I get these kids open like lungs on Ventolin
Presenting them with controversy like Jello Biafra
I’m down for the cause, protect these artists like we’re APRA
Like cats on Viagra, I could serve you all night
Call me the customer (why’s that?) 'cause I’m always right
And I’m always mad tight, like rich people with funds
And the styles more deadly than sharing needles with bums, it goes…

Dumb Enough,The Calling,2003,"This is recreation, set your station and get your place in
A comfy seat, pump this beat, Pressure will set the occasion
For your entertainment, I work hard on my flows
This scene is full of falling MCs, I wear hardhats to shows
And every Hip Hop head’s a critic, cause some hit the stage hard
But couldn’t get these arseholes open at a gay bar
It’s a comedy festival; they’re so unintelligible
Can’t work out if they got peas for brains, or they’re just vegetables
It’s sounds pathetic as me being anorexic
I do damage like a paralytic paramedic with no anaesthetic
Girls shake my hand, guys want to hug me, it’s a worry
If I forgot your name I’m sorry, you’re probably pretty ugly
I’m scared of getting old, so when it comes D-Day
I’ma thank you all for dissing me, then say something clichéd
And when I’m dead and buried I want youse in Life. Be in it. shirts

On stage, I’ll get you out your seat quicker than road rage (Get up)
I take them all from beat jackers to backpackers
With tracks fat as fuck, I ran amok on these whack rappers
But then it happened (What happened?), what I thought could
I screwed all these MCs (Yeah?), then it got awkward
""It got weird didn’t it? It got weird...""
You don’t wanna see me anymore
(Oi Suffa, you can’t sing!) Yeah, I can’t even hum a tune
But I make this crowd bounce like bedsprings on a honeymoon (What?)

They gassed in the head, that trash you said was pure jealousy
Like Left Foot, Right Foot's an invitation to step to me
You’re losing your footing, you need some Velcro on them Shell toes
In fights I’m throwing rhymes, in rhyme fights I’m throwing elbows
I move a crowd like stolen goods, so try and get a hold when
You couldn’t move your shit with a diarrhetic colon
I already told them the hills are impassable, impossible
The truth hurts, this rhyme will put you in hospital
Break it down like a molecule, we burning like fossil fuel

Gonna have to tune down to get that bottom bit

""An obese man... a disgusting man who could barely stand up; a man who if you saw him on the street, you'd point him out to your friends so that they could join you in mocking him; a man, who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish your meal.""

""Stay the fuck away 'cause I spit when I'm talking""

The rhyme's so Obese that Weight Watchers couldn't save me
Impact is so fat I sweat butter, spit gravy
So leaving a microphone alone with the Gravyspitter's
Like leaving a paedophile at home with the babysitter
Shit, it's gettin' harder every day to keep up with
All these new kids coming out, although most of 'em suck
Think they're nothing compared to the Certified (What?)
Prepare to murdered by the Suffa you sucka, that's fuckin' word to my
Man Pressure, ain't no man fresher
Suckas don't try it because we're standing 
united like fuckin' Manchester
Put your microphone away, you gets blown away
Like castles in the sand, master of this journey, the only way
You're taking me out's if you're hot chick with no taste
A woman that's practically all bosom and no waist (What's up, girl?)
And if she's into hip-hop I'll have a baby with her

Here Come the Girls,The Calling,2003,"Looking so good, it's a doggone shame
That they couldn't all be mine
Looking so pretty, it's a doggone pity
Oh, you're looking so fine
Here come the girls!
Looking so good, it's a doggone shame
That they couldn't all be mine
Here come the girls!
Looking so pretty, it's a doggone pity
Oh, you're looking so fine

I need a girl that ain't looking for the perfect fella
And doesn't care if I'm broke or I'm earning cheddar
One that can service Pressure while she works a Webber
And knows she's late when I ain't got the nerve to tell her
What I want is a woman that's hotter than December
A goddess that wouldn't mind me proper on a bender
Honest I'd put in my promise and surrender
As long as the pushing lasts longer than her temper
For this girl I'd throw all aside
A wild one with attitude and no rules to guide
Ain't obsessed with her looks or own foolish pride
And only ring she wants is a phone call at night (damn right)
I want a girl that's down for breaking the law
Rough exterior with heart hidden away at the core
One that'll wait at the door if I've been away on tour
With handcuffs on the bed and duct tape on the floor

Looking so good, it's a doggone shame
That they couldn't all be mine
Here come the girls!
Looking so pretty, it's a doggone pity
Oh, you're looking so fine
Here come the girls!
Looking so good, it's a doggone shame
That they couldn't all be mine
Here come the girls!
Looking so pretty, it's a doggone pity
Oh, you're looking so fine

I need a girl that's like
Cold paddles on a bleeding heart
Ava Adore, we must never be apart
I need a girl that ain't torn the scene up
A storm in a D-cup, who don't mind porn or a pre-nup
(Check) I need a chick that plays video games
Not the type to complain and never give me no brain
And don't give me cocaine addicted
Honey going through my jeans for money, hiding meth in her lipstick
She talk
 like she's tasting me, 
she walks
 like she's chasing me
'Cause I ain't chasing Amy like Jason Lee, basically
I need a fox in some fishnets, putting pots in the Dishlex
Who don't run from spiders and squash her own insects
Intense, makeup running, crazy beautiful
Make love in the sun and graze me with her cuticle
Head in the clouds with one foot on the ground
She'd put up with me even when I'm putting it down

Bored out of my head (hey!)
While the boxers do their thing (hoo-hoo-hoo!)
You make me feel so good inside
I got to jump up and say (aaah!)
Naa, naa, naa, naa!
Naa, naa, naa naa!
Here come the girls!
Naa, naa, naa, naa!
Naa, naa, naa naa!

I need a girl that's like... check the god's dimples
She'd love me even if I looked like Don Rickles
Drooling like pitbulls, hot but not fickle
So loyal, not spoiled, and smart, so not simple
She'd be complex, 
on lock,
 want sex, 
non-stop
Pop tops off beer for me, girl would even pop-lock
Crop top, mid riff, not the town bicycle
Bisexual mistress with eyes like icicles

Send me an angel sipping bitter lager
Envision her to visit the strippers with her partner
I don't need a girl living with her father
It's sort of just torturous like that chick in Nicaragua
She's tasteful, graceful, nothing short of a ten
In lingerie when the longest day draws to an end
She knows dating's an occasion with laws that attend
Cause three's a crowd, unless her friend's more than her friend

Here come the girls!
Looking so good, it's a doggone shame
That they couldn't all be mine
Here come the girls!
Looking so pretty, it's a doggone pity
Oh, you're looking so fine
Here come the girls!
Looking so good, it's a doggone shame
That they couldn't all be mine
Here come the girls!",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-here-come-the-girls-lyrics

Illusionary Lines,The Calling,2003,"I once had time on my hands, but now handling time
Is coping with this life cycle and the mandatory grind
My sanity's fine, just falling short of stamina I'm
Searching for some food for thought to feed this famine of mind
And when I'm stagnant I rhyme, it helps the night turn to day
I churn my way through this nine to five and urban decay
Believe me it's bleak, and though the city breathe in its sleep
It's just a paddock, ain't no where a shepherds leading these sheep
Now most prefer it covered up lie than the truth naked
The truth is ugly like cellulite; please don't publicly parade it
I hate it but to escape it would be luck on fluke
I feel like I'm a dope beat but I'm stuck on loop

But that's my life cycle; freedom means everything to me
And face value's got us believing everything we see
So if our eyes tell us lies the truth is we're blind
So keep on walking straight and narrow down illusionary lines

""Open your eyes-eyes up
Now, wake up, wake up, rise up""
""Open your eyes-eyes up
Now, wake up, wake up, rise up""
""Open your eyes-eyes
Eyes-eyes-eyes-eyes-eyes up
Wake-wake-wake-wake
Wake up, wake up, ri-rise up""

I once had respect for this game, but now this game of respect
Is sold to the highest bidder with some fame and a cheque
Now any layman can get respect without breaking his neck
Paying dues, time these crews started paying some debt
It ain't lights and cameras, personalities on sets
Distorting realities in their context with no origi-
-Nality concepts, who gives a fuck about a
Salary, this ain't a popularity contest
'Cause hip-hop ain't faking for ends, hip-hop ain't
Fading with trends, it ain't rich kids playing with pens
It ain't the clothes on your back, or the label on them
It's where you're at, so I say it again

It's just my life cycle; music means everything to me
(It's just a fashion show) nah; don't believe everything you see
'Cause if our eyes tell us lies the truth is we're blind
So keep on walking straight and narrow down illusionary lines
(So keep on walking straight and narrow down illusionary lines)

""Open your eyes-eyes up

""Open your eyes-eyes up
Now, wake up, wake up, rise up""
""Open your eyes-eyes
Eyes-eyes-eyes-eyes-eyes up
Wake-wake-wake-wake
Wake up, wake up, ri-rise up""

That's just my life cycle, nothing matters but setting me free
Because my freedom and hip-hop be meaning everything to me
Now face values and fashions empower everything we be
Believing everything we hear, and everything we see
And if our eyes tell us lies, then we usually find
Our visions cluttered by this scutter so the truth is we're blind
It's just poison food for thought for these delusionary minds
So stop walking straight and narrow down illusionary lines

Laying Blame,The Calling,2003,"Oi, Suffa
You're not all that you think you are
What have you ever contributed to this earth
Or to Australian hip hop? Dickhead
What have you ever done? Hey?

I gave birth to half these styles, you should pay me rhyme support
Like Billy Jean suing Michael Jackson for child support
Rhyme is thought, what is it? Lethal, damn you’ll get hurt
'Cause I excel like the tag on my shirt
I’ll have these rappers easing back, rhyme with a swagger
Feed your girl aphrodisiacs and hide your Viagra
If pain was diabetes, rhyme would be my insulin
I’m taking out the insolent in an instant when
They bring the rhyme; I’ll battle if you wanna tussle
A single line can turn that fatty matter into muscle
You stagnate, while my rhymes circulate like rumours
Your living proof that god has a sense of humour
I’m butter made from the cream that came from the crop
I’ll move the mountain to Mohammed scream my name from the top
And proclaim what I got, boy, so give me headroom
These clubs are full of more toys than spoilt kids bedrooms
When I’m on stage I might lose my breath
'Cause I got so much heart that there’s no room in my chest
Left for lungs, yes the best is yet to come
My rhymes like a hand around your neck
Constricting your breathing like snakebites and beestings
I’m all up in these arseholes' faces like G-Strings
I searched the world for opposition but I fear the
Only competition I found was in a mirror, now

""Who's that man in the mirror? Ha!
Who—Who's that—that
That man—That man—
That man in the mirror? Ha!""

""Blame it on the boogie, blame it on the rhythm
Blame it on the vibe that I give 'em""
""Hardcore on a rough tip""
""Blame it on the boogie, blame it on the rhythm""
""Hardcore on a rough tip""
""Blame it on the vibe that I give 'em""

When Pressure steps to the batters plate you salivate, known to captivate
I have to break new barriers like when a chaste nun masturbates
If one more critic asks me what I do, I’ll slap 'em mate
And tell them I’m a rapper as I strap her up in gaffer tape
Loudmouths make me wanna flip
MCs only dream they got a grip and wake up with their hand on their dick
Honest, if they ride the nuts I tell them get off me
'Cause I’m unstable like a cradle bridge, so don’t cross me
I’m highly explosive; you’re a child playing with matches
I break rappers you give hairline fractures
These actors keep it real? You’re really wack it’s fact
You spit one-liners while I spit the finest chapters
Perhaps it’s time to retire the mic
Like the Bulls should have done son, 'cause no-one wants to be like
That anymore, 'cause nowadays you’re taken on a fantasy tour
Of coke, guns and gold when they’re actually poor
Factually flawed, yet entertaining
I guess it how far we’re willing to go to satisfy a craving
Make them swallow their tongues like epileptics
Then I’ll respect it, I come clean as if my lube was antiseptic
So blow me, you still couldn’t rhyme fresh
I’m on a higher level of divineness, so call me your highness
There’s only three things that are certain in life
Death, taxes and Hilltop Hoods working the mic

Mic Felon,The Calling,2003,"""Listen up ladies and Gentlemen, our fugitive has been on the run for ninety minutes; average foot-speed over uneven terrain barring injuries, four miles an hour that gives us a radius of, six miles!""

I got committed to the pen now my shit's so locked down
MCs think I'm doing time for this hip-hop sound
Debris the mastermind, Suffa's my partner in crime
I be the microphone felon, tell them your master design
It all started when I was young fiending for mics
Dreaming of heights that I would be reaching despite
No one would put me on, or even play me at that
So earned my dues ganking mics labelled radio shack
At open mic one night far from sober or with it
This guy pulls me off and says 'You're rhyming over the limit
And heading that way you won't last a day or a night
You need to be down for the long haul kid we call 'em lifers
Beside you need to stick with me cos rhyme pays
And I know this heist where we can jack some sine waves
They're mainly small timers, freestylers
Street urchins and beat merchants, none of them real rhymers
They're raping this culture and make me sick to my stomach
These fools need to be arrested for sleeping in public'
I dug it, got serious and mastered my rhyme
The rocked to the spot with my new partner in crime
Trespassed on stage, stole the mic to further insult
Committed arsony, defamation and verbal assault
They tried to blame the engineer oblivious to our ploy
So we crept backstage as they buried the sound boy
I stole the DJs crates and his diamond needles
Now they got me on the run so it's time to leave ya'll
We tried to cross the border, got caught as a noun carrier
Pulled over and evicted for breaking the sound barrier
This cop threw me to the ground, cos hip hop is violent
Said 'You got freedom of speech, just choose to remain silent'
Then he checked in the trunk and he found the hot sound
I got committed to the pen now my shit's locked down

I'm a rhyme felon peeps do what I tell them
People can't handle the product that I'm selling
I left my dwelling now I'm on the run
Microphone felony number one
I'm a rhyme felon peeps do what I tell them
People can't handle the product that I'm selling
I left my dwelling now I'm on the run

All right

You won't get far little punk 'cause I bust pure rhymes
I tear up bars like a drunk on a bus tour
, I'm
The hideous, insidious, super fly Suffa
Ignorance is bliss and you're a happy motherfucker
Sucker rock a set, I'm like Bobba Fett with intellect
I'm everywhere you go like porno on the Internet
So you don't wanna step, trust me, you been warned
You don't wanna play leapfrog with a unicorn
Leave you torn, you couldn't battle me with that lame rhyme
You couldn't come hard with two women at the same time
You walk in the club dipped in jewels and versace
Only gay guys wear that much gold, ask Liberace
MCs act arrogant, I wonder why
If your skills matched your ego you'd be eating humble pie
Your rhymes are more average than your girlfriend's looks
And with a face like that, I hope that girl can cook, it's like that",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-simmy-and-the-gravyspitter-lyrics
Testimonial Year,The Calling,2003,"Let me introduce myself, raise them beers
Suffa MC, been doing this for more than ten years
Ever since I was a youngster, I brought the funk for
The love, and for the party people to get drunk to
Since back in the day we've been the major crew
When I step on the stage it's like déjà vu
Years of performing, years of practice
Respect from my peers
, 
my girls tears on the mattress
Every time that we went on tour
And she was left behind feeling insecure
But she needn't worry; I wasn't chasing a girl to rock right
I was chasing the warm glow of a spotlight
City after city, state to state
We were just three mates rocking beats and breaks
So if you made it to a Hoods show to check the style
You get much respect, you made it all worthwhile

Let me introduce myself, raise them beers
Pressure MC, been doing this for more than ten years
It's been a long road, I'm glad I stayed on track
A dream of making raps, and getting played on wax
It seems that faking jacks want to cause my demise
Along the way wouldn't give me play but couldn't stop the course of my rise
Now of course the sky's the limit, we fly get with it
You ain't underground just because you dig it
It took infinite skills and hard work to get this far jerk
Look me in the face, now I'm the one who wears a smart smirk
It wasn't all negative, took the good with the bad
Us falling off will never happen, like catching the Hoods in drag
In orderly fashion I'm thanking those who supported me
Wouldn't be where I'm standing if they hadn't have fought for me
From a nothing rep, now we live busting sets
So if you own a Hoods album you get nuff respect

Let me introduce myself, raise them beers
Suffa MC, been doing this for more than ten years
We've been through a lot to perfect this art
When Next left the group it near broke my heart
But then Debris stepped up as the DJ
A super team spearheaded by PJ
Chasing dreams like Fats chasing punani
It's all about the culture, never been about the money
But we had to watch people trying to take advantage
Of us, trying to damn near rob us
We got slowed down by dodgy contract offers
But it would take a nation of millions to stop us
We got our propers, paid our dues in triplicate
Ripping it, till other crews were insignificant
I've stayed true, never made myself a hypocrite
Trust me, I'm wise, I got the certificate

Let me introduce myself, raise them beers
Pressure MC, been doing this for more than ten years
Yeah we made it far, through beats pumping and flows
My bro Rated R props for being the drunkest at shows
And support from my mates who fought for the stakes
Of Oz Hip-Hop, props to record stores, I bought from their crates
You see talking it takes less than walking the stakes
So put your money where your mouth is and quit flaunting as fakes
For those who stuck by me over time I put yours over mine
Don't have to speak your names you know my mind
In this simple game of respect it's given as it's taken
Been given props, now respected tracks is what I'm making
Shouts to everyone I met on tour
It's our Hip-Hop ladies and gentlemen let's keep it pure
So here's another LP from the Hoods to crank to
Hope you dig the rest of this album people I got to thank you
[Outro: Suffa 
& Pressure

That's right, Pressure
We've gotta thank everyone who's supported us and been there for us
You get much respect
But for now
Let us introduce

The Calling,The Calling,2003,"For many years I was seeking asylum, in the bleakest environments
Rhyme possessed me, while many started speaking retirement
So as I rose they all fell in the fashion of yelling and trashing
For what it's worth there was no quelling the passion
Their love was dead, I was writing papes but getting fuck all said
So I polished my shit until my knuckles bled
Treading thin ice and all I caught were chills
Sacrifices were appetisers, mics instead of meals
This hand was mine, so I played it until I made it expand my mind
And burned my name into the sands of time
Then rhyme gave me strength to less avail
Got used to these backstabbers, so now I sleep on a bed of nails
I never fail, but turning tides are moving too slow
I swam the depths of every ocean just to prove I could flow
So from the cradle to the grave, turntable to Holy Father
I swear I didn’t slit my wrists, I got the hip-hop stigmata

You got to pray to hip-hop almighty
We bless the microphone nightly
Open up the lyric from inside me
It's our calling that's why we say
You got to pray to hip-hop almighty
We bless the microphone nightly
Open up the lyric from inside me
It's our calling that's why we say

This be calling, we could never be fake
Thanks to hip-hop I got a bed in every state
And without it I'd roam the city with no purpose
Without the underground I'm a clown without circus
I flip verses, you feeling me, abilities
My currency with which I buy credibility
Facilities were built, just to be torn down
Till the wheels fall off, and my pencils all worn down
Till death comes to collect his debt, I'll wreck the set
When heads check in retrospect, I'll get respect
'Cause I did what I was called to do
It's hip-hop, I did it all for you
We true to this, got clout on turntables getting played
We doing this without a label not getting payed
So from the cradle to the grave, microphone to retirement home
I'll be on stage I'll never leave the rhyme alone

You got to pray to hip-hop almighty
We bless the microphone nightly
Open up the lyric from inside me
It's our calling that's why we say
You got to pray to hip-hop almighty
We bless the microphone nightly
Open up the lyric from inside me
It's our calling that's why we say

Either we're all out, or we're all in
And if we fall out, then we're all falling
It's the calling it's what I hear in my sleep
It's that shiver up my spine when I'm feeling the beat
It's that fear of defeat, the need to better myself
It's the culture; it's not about spreading the wealth
It's forgetting the time when you're perfecting a rhyme
It's every drop of sweat that I shed getting mine

You got to pray to hip-hop almighty
We bless the microphone nightly
Open up the lyric from inside me
It's our calling that's why we say
You got to pray to hip-hop almighty
We bless the microphone nightly
Open up the lyric from inside me
It's our calling that's why we say
You got to pray",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-the-calling-lyrics

Every single night and that's the way we keep it right
Like that fuckers... (YEAH!!)
I'm just tricking though
Certified Wise in the house tonight (Certified Wise!)
Oi, when I say ""Certified"" you say ""Wise""
We say Certified (Wise)
Certified (Wise)

The Certified have arrived, extraordinaire extravagant
Beers like confidence, man I'm drinking until I'm arrogant
'Cause I'm a cocky fuck, hit your girl and I knock her up
Be like ""what the fuck?"", in the net like a hockey puck (score!)
Rappers get embarrassed when they see the way that we work
They try hide their shame like fat guys swimming in T-shirts
Research your Oz hip-hop before you step to us
And if you step, hands around your throat like a necklace

Mr Trials, young ladies gimme a call
My number's written next to fuck-wit on the chick's bathroom wall
I'm slightly easy and a tripe bit sleazy
With a wit of a red brick and chiselled body of Kim Beazley
My theory is, never touch the mic quite serious
A kid goes out on dates later than their next period
My crew's got it made, rocking the place
With more dope rappers to match every pram chilling at Colonnade's

It's Certified Wise, no need to tell you again
Because these cunts can be so funky that the smell would offend
A dyke's girlfriend, well then, let's get straight to the point, shall we?
This rowdy crowd of MCs and DJs know how to pound beats
Like kids with flat feet and crap beats walking down backstreets
So much work went into this the liner notes are fact sheets
Like Black Sheep I've got two words for those that slept
(nya, Nya nya no respect!)

You thought it was safe, well guess what? (what?) best to beware
My plans will find your weak points (then what?) get up in there
Attack your mind, with a fine rhyme when I find time
And I'll find out if you're walking if you're talking the grape vine
I'll waste time. Need to take on the job at hand
The skills for this professional typical certified wise man
From sky to land, I'm overcoming all your schemes and plans
So take cover as I rain thunder upon you man

Certified Wise throws agendas so hot
It'd make a married man give up his annual blowjob
You better show something, with Heady no bluffing
On the wrong side of my tracks, I'll smash your petticoat junction
In a suffering city, I'm punishing the pretty
And if you don't fucking kill me I'll crush you without pity

I arrange certain words amongst silence
To be heard in abundance while MC's face redundance
Stereo speakers exceed beyond specifications
Through extended noise generations
Let's cut the conversations to a small chat
(Why's that?) I'm busy tryna react to the hi-hats
Blockade and Certified stand tall above ridiculous under-achievers
And constant non-believers (believers)

I'm on stage with a handful of Panadols handing them out
'Cause of the head throbbing from the head nodding
And we about putting you out for the count like mic check
You ain't gonna get Certified respect
So hide your decks, your mics I might blackout
In a cipher when I still take the title
The name's Sesta, I snatch an 'L' plate
And slap it on your forehead with more force than porn sex

It's the Hoodhist monks with the certified MC's
I'll make you nod your head like Parkinson's disease
So stand at ease, but don't step to our clique
I got a hundred metronomes just waiting to go sick
So take your pick, but not the axe or the shovel
After hours, I make beds rock like Barney Rubble
It's kinda subtle the way that my flow pours
And leave your ears up shit creek without a Funkoar

Now Certified Wise got a hold of ya
We got the whole lot o' crop of magnolia
We're the fresh B-boys in Nike and Adidas
We're hotter than heaters and blowing up speakers
There's no half-steppers, we're far from a fake crew
We make rap music every Aussie can relate to
We'll never take a tumble, We're not gonna stumble

You do or you don't, we'll prove that you won't

You get it? You're wondering why you should never try
The reason Certified is Mr Nice with the wise guys

Recognised, put up on a level next to me
And the Wise unified our lives, we bless the beat
We yet to see competitors who can compete with
Elaborate schemes they conjured up in their dreams
Have to be outta your mind to even battle this team
Masterminds of the game, nobody does it the same
When we leave the stage we're sure that you remember the name

You faggot MCs always compare one another
Studio 2000's where you shot your album cover
I provide patience to your shit dictation
Then commence domestic MC word castration
Like exitless effects from a psychedelic wanger
For you there's no escape like sperm in a franger
Simulated imitations fade away progressively
So go fuck yourself hermaphrodite MC

Certified lyrical delegates are all the sound-ions
Rebellions under one banner for new milleniums

I throw tempo-tempos, to scare those who dare oppose
Who don't compare the pros, I'm dressed in threadbare clothes
Still these rare flows got MCs pleading ""Give us a fair go!""
Try to stop me, you don't realise the lengths to which I'm prepared to go
We should take a short journey and leave you at your wits-end
You get burnt like you're smoking a cigarette from the lit end
You're acting so feminine, you could be stressing about split-ends
Certified hit home with so much force they make bricks bend

The situation gets sticky like a perv with porn mags
My presence on stage will make your trailer horse gags
Staunch cat, horn bag, you know my style sucker
And that we make tracks to get you up like a fluffer
Certified wise, notorious to rip cunts
Dissing us will get costly like private shows at strip clubs
Beating me's a hard task by itself so fuck you

This is my life and many come and go like one night stands
I treat live jams like a sermons, and in my mic hand

Some money in my hand, 'round about fifty grand
But I got nothing, I write rhymes on the bus
I keep suffering; fuck the lines of the dust
You keep sniffing, that shit is for the punk hoes
This shit is for my bros, my people in the front row

You know I looked around for faces I'd know
I fell in love with the people in the front row
You know I looked around for faces I'd know
I fell in love with the people in the front row

I got hip-hop taste buds
I wanna hear that bass when I make love
Wanna hear some lyrics when I wake up
Write rhymes to get me through a break up (bitch!)
Rough like whisky straight, no chaser
Went through fifty breaks, no flavour
Till I found this one, and made the
Bass hook with the drum my saviour
This is a comeback, tongue that’s sharp like a thumbtack
It's so tight James is saying, ""Give my funk back""
One track, eight track, ADAT, residual noise
Man, fuck that, we clean with the digital toys
I'm the Apache, you're failing to match me
Throw your hands in the air like you're hailing a taxi
And move to the funk flow, you stepping? Are you drunk, bro?
This is for my peeps and the freaks in the front row

You know I looked around for faces I'd know
I fell in love with the people in the front row
You know I looked around for faces I'd know
I fell in love with the people in the front row

People don’t complain if Suffa’s in here
And you’re in the front row all covered in beer
And club owners don't say, ""The place is wrecked, it's your fault""
If the roof is on fire, it's an electrical fault
Man, I bet you all bolt when I bring it live
Like Friday night footy, in my hoody I can hide
I get live on the breaks, son, like Pace One
Lads, if you’re heading to the bar, grab your mates one
Ladies come chill, come rock with me, honey
I got like half a mil' in Monopoly money
There's no stopping me, honey, so you can take my hand
We can lay on the beach and count grains of sand
And take a plane to Japan and drink saké with the mafia
Fly to Libya for some Bacardi with Gaddafi
A dinner date followed by a funk show
We'll rip off our tops and jump around in the front row

You know I looked around for faces I'd know
I fell in love with the people in the front row
You know I looked around for faces I'd know
I fell in love with the people in the front row

Put me here and I'm all yours
Not for the money and it's not for the applause
No, oh no, no, no
(It's for the nosebleed section)

You know I looked around for faces I'd know
I fell in love with the people in the front row
You know I looked around for faces I'd know
I fell in love with the people in the front row",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-the-nosebleed-section-lyrics

""Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba""

We found this club on a side street, but I was kind of iffy
We could hear some fly beats, but from outside it looked shifty
I said this to Pressure, just before I finished my sentence
This bouncer came out and dragged us both through the entrance
This guy was huge and I was stumbling with my speech
I finally mumbled that we just stumbled in from the street
He said to us, ""So finding us was accidental?
Well, I'm not surprised, we don't advertise at The Sentinel""
He said, ""What's your name?"" he said, ""Pressure"", I said, ""Suffa""
He said, ""Join the rest of the suckers""
So we went right in, we sat right down
Pressure said, ""I guess I'll get us both our first round""
He had to go downstairs 'cause the bar was underground
He came back and said, ""Man, these the cheapest drinks in town""
I agreed, yes indeed, we could be here all night
They're only charging a buck fifty for imperial pints
And I'm feeling all right, this place is kind of cool, man
I'm hoping tonight nobody acts a fool and
Ruins this vibe that I got going, not knowin'
Where I am, but this jam's growin', man, this spot's blowin'!
The ladies were hot, I sat down and listened
To their 
four thousand watt in-house sound system
The DJ was laying tracks, keeping people on the floor and then
He played a crazy break, and the chorus went

(Ba ba ba ba ba) 
""Hop right in, sit right down""
(Ba ba ba ba ba) 
""Join the rest of the suckers""
 At the Sentinel
(Ba ba ba ba ba) 
""Hop right in, sit right down""
(Ba ba ba ba ba) 
""Join the rest of the suckers""
 At the Sentinel
""Ba ba ba ba ba""
""Ba ba ba ba ba"" """"
(Ba ba ba ba ba) 
""Hop right in, sit right down""
(Ba ba ba ba ba) 
""Join the rest of the suckers""

These dim lights hold, silhouetted figures fit in tight moulds
This beer's ice cold, yeah, we gon' be here till the night's old
I might stroll, see what I can plunder, but I wonder
'Do I feel a blunder or is that the drink putting me under?'
A strange feelin', this place got my brain reelin'
Looked up and seen a picture of the barkeep upon the main ceilin'
Feel like a broken dream, I'm walking through a smoke machine
And in the corner seen a dope fiend blowin' a smoke screen
Sat down, looked at the picture on the bottle label
It was the same man and the stripper that sat atop my table
And as he licked her thighs I saw that glint in her eyes
The wristwatch upon her waistlet had him hypnotised
Then she kissed him goodbye, threw me a smile and a grin
My reply cut thin by my hand wiping my chin
Walked to the bar as the tender looked right through me, I said ""Excuse me""
Then he replied in tones as if he talked about me not to me
Said, ""Welcome to The Sentinel, I hope your stay here's perpetual
We serve drinks and broken dreams, but no edibles""
I bought a round, man, I think it's watered down
It's tastin' sort of foul, this place is giving me the creeps and plus the doors are now
Closing to the public, so let's make our move
Then I was struck by the strangest sense of déjà vu
Man, I swore I was bent, ""Suffa, man, I've heard this all before it went
'
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
'"", and then the chorus went

(Ba ba ba ba ba) 
""Hop right in, sit right down""
(Ba ba ba ba ba) 
""Join the rest of the suckers""
 At the Sentinel
(Ba ba ba ba ba) 
""Hop right in, sit right down""
(Ba ba ba ba ba) 
""Join the rest of the suckers""
 At the Sentinel
""Ba ba ba ba ba""
""Ba ba ba ba ba"" """"
(Ba ba ba ba ba) 
""Hop right in, sit right down""
(Ba ba ba ba ba) 
""Join the rest of the suckers""
[Verse 3: Pressure & 
Suffa
]
Man, this place has got me reelin', I took a seat to get my focus
When a group of B-Boys gathered by a stage took my notice
At about one o'clock the club manager approached us
And said, ""I heard you jokers were MCs, who's the dopest?
'Cause we run an open mic battle every night
And to enter you gotta be incredibly tight""
I said, ""Get me the mic I might flip"", then the lights switched
My vision was blurrin' and burnin' words inside my eyelids
Rhyme progression begun, somethin' possessin' my tongue
Blessin' the deaf and dumb till I was fallin' short of breath in my lung
""When will they let us stop?"" I checked the time and it was
Six in the morning, and we were still rhymin'
We battled MC after MC, 
battled MCs for days
But they wouldn't let us go 
when we tried to leave the stage
The manager said, ""You boys can never leave this tournament
And you can never leave the Sentinel"", and the chorus went

(Ba ba ba ba ba) 
""Hop right in, sit right down""
(Ba ba ba ba ba) 
""Join the rest of the suckers""

Tomorrow Will Do,The Calling,2003,"]
Now, for your listening pleasure, in high fidelity stereo sound, it's the Hilltop Hoods with some words for the wise
.

Be careful what you wish for; be cautious what you seek
Women are like opportunities; grasp them when they're in reach
All that glitters is gold, and sold for green locally
Life's a blind struggle that's why fate keeps tripping over me
With fines, debts and warrants trust me when I say they serve you
What you don't know can't hurt you; so not knowing you's a virtue
It's a fast food world; I fear that I'm a die gluttoning
But life is like John Howard, too short to waste time worrying
I moved from my parentals, used to lose it in the mental
Now I'm using my potential, for bruising instrumentals
I'm a bad natured human, bound to stagnate in ruin
Till these man made delusions catch a bad case of bruising
We're all drunk philosophers so give it time now
There's a fine line between a smile and a frown, Yeah? It's called an eyebrow
If measurement of ones worth was one word of testament
I'm done keeping it real I keep it relevant

Life is a road, full of turn-offs, short sprints and long
Runs. We'll deal with it as it comes, if
I lose my way I'll follow you
'Cause today's like yesterday I guess tomorrow will do
Life is a road, full of turn-offs, short sprints and long
Runs. We'll deal with it as it comes, if
I lose my way I'll follow you
'Cause today's like yesterday I guess tomorrow will do

I've been an out and out loudmouth since my youth
I'm generous with words but selfish with the truth
I'd never say some things on my mind anyway
'Cause ideas are like cars, they get stolen every day
And when I do speak (what happens?) women call me a creep
Ladies chivalry's not dead it's on the couch where you made it sleep
I get deep without the meaningful
Mimed a rhyme to a blind man, he said ""Boy now I've seen it all""
The worlds an ugly place filled with beautiful women
And people who love music but lack suitable rhythm
What a computer will give them an instrument won't
It's called hip-hop, guess what we're the industry joke
But hip-hop followers, follow us till your sorrow is gone
And be strong 'cos tomorrow it's on
We ain't no weak trip, Beatnik, kids on the sneak tip
We spit deep shit, all of life's secrets

Life is a road, full of turn-offs, short sprints and long
Runs. We'll deal with it as it comes, if
I lose my way I'll follow you
'Cause today's like yesterday I guess tomorrow will do
Life is a road, full of turn-offs, short sprints and long
Runs. We'll deal with it as it comes, if
I lose my way I'll follow you
'Cause today's like yesterday I guess tomorrow will do

""Been there, done that, do it again tomorrow""

Life is a road, full of turn-offs, short sprints and long
Runs. We'll deal with it as it comes, if
I lose my way I'll follow you
'Cause today's like yesterday I guess tomorrow will do

Walk On,The Calling,2003,"]
People, if you wanna go somewhere and you don't have railroad fare, plane fare, train fare, boat fare, or don't have no fare period, there's one way of getting there. I've been using a method for twenty-five years or more, you know, sonny, and it seems to have paid off. Just walk on

I speak from the heart, but only when I drink
And I only ever sleep when I'm too tired to think
Restlessness, the reaction that you will find
From stress I guess and having a compassionate mind
I worry bout the machine of progress, ain't no stopping it
The forest we destroy and the world we build on top of it
Mercenaries get paid salaries to slaughter
Girls obsessed with body image find calories in water
Nurses comfort seven-year-old casualties of mortar
A peasant's daughter caught up in a war for a border
And at home we treat our refugees like criminals
Detention centres just a catch phrase for a minimal
Security prison, we drive gold trimmed cars
Down the road an Afghani kid grows up behind bars
And we wonder why they hate the west (wonder)
When we treat them like they're second-class citizens at best, we're all
Pawns in a game, the USAs miniatures
Aussie foreign policy with George Bush's signature
Peeps die for a watch and blue chip stock
Did they do Big Pop or was it two-bit cops
I wanna sue kid rock for making rednecks think they're hip hop
Wanna swallow people's pain and spit it from the hilltop
Wanna affect change in the subjects that we talk on
Connect strangers, work together and walk on

""And you don't quit, don't stop""
""And you don't quit, don't stop""
""And you don't quit, don't stop""
""And you don't quit, don't stop""

Polluting airways, mankind strays with no reforming
So slap on that sunscreen and enjoy the global warming
'Cause ignoring world issues is what we all do best
Just like Aussie politicians shoe shining for the U.S
To save losing face, no thoughts to the fumes that trace
Our sky lines and clogs our seas we swimming in consumer waste
The fumes of hate rise globally but will it cease
The day we try and find a little peace within the Middle East
We shadow their borders yelling, ""Deplete their arms""
Its just war for black gold so they can grease their palms
We all need a scapegoat, a villain to cop blame
We're just wolves in sheep's clothing killing in God's name
And that's worldwide, like global overpopulation
We mine the world dry of natural resources to feed our nations
Appetite for waste, I see it everywhere
I feel like throwing a flag of protest in Tienanmen Square
We need to care for mother earth and all of her natural defences
But talk is cheap, and taking action is expensive
We wear our hearts on our sleeves, our flags on our borders
And that's why nuclear testing's done in Pacific foreign waters
We follow reporters with the worth of a scholar
And gather personal opinions from a rag worth a dollar
Man this is not a subject I feel lightly I can talk on
The attitude is one man of many (right), so walk on

""And you don't quit, don't stop""
""And you don't quit, don't stop""
""And you don't quit, don't stop""
""And you don't quit, don't stop""",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-walk-on-lyrics

Who’s fucking with me? Suffa MC
Tongue like sandpaper, who’s rougher than we?
We’ve been gone for a while, it’s been a long a cold winter, we
Back to get the crowd of their feet like back injuries
Raps, facts and similes, axe to hack into me
They try bring me down like a Mack had backed into me
Back, you can’t hinder me, fact you can’t injure me
We back to crack the back of this wack rap industry
These MCs don’t wanna (They don’t wanna) mess with me
Fuck, that bitch run his mouth, it’s just a storm in a d-cup
You wack as Aussie troops going to Afghanistan
""I’m in a world war with Mohammed, my man""
I’m taking MCs to war, fuck the friendships and politics
End this 'cause my lyrical depth is bottomless
We thought you’d forgotten us (There’s no forgetting me)
You wanna fight? You couldn’t win a battle hypothetically

I had enough of their dissing, so fuck ‘em, ambition is nothing but wishing
They come on fat when they’re under-nutritioned
Hate it or love it you listen, you getting bumped in my system?
Your chance is hardly as much as an Iraqi becoming a Christian
You’ll never shine; you can’t polish a turd
Your shit is dope? I shove it down your throat, so swallow your words
I’m sick of copping slander for what I stand for
You’re not the man, you’re just masturbating in your propaganda
And got a lot to answer, your shit don’t stink?
Think your ship won’t sink? Man, that ain’t it, don’t think
That you’re large and we’re small time, tall poppies is small minds
Carrying the heavy weight of their ego on small spines
This is rugged raw for heads who want nothing more
While others talk politics and swallow dicks like a fucking whore
So what they bugging for? It’s just hip-hop, love and war
Pressure MC, Hilltop Hoods, a lyric juggernaut

'Nother year, 'nother grind, 'nother smile line
Dead star type of light shine
Why you taking up my time if you ain't of a like mind?
Forget what you and who say
It's the future that moves my mood today
I could be toothless and grey, lose my toupee
And still feel bullet-proof like Luke Cage
I've never been concerned with a beef
Just learning to be the best version of me
They say that we can learn from defeat
Why are they looking for adversity permanently? They're
Missing the mark, still in rut
Need a little bit of dip in their strut, living it up
The enlightening feeling of not giving a fuck
While they're putting me down I've been picking it up, so

Don't let no
One tell you who you are
Be yourself
Don't let no
One tell you who you are
Be yourself
'Cause they fill you with rage
You're like 'Why are you breaking my heart?'
It's like they build you to break you
Just wanted to take you apart-
Part-part

(Let's get it, let's get it, let's get it, let's go!)
Looking good, looking better than I ever have
Feeling good, feeling that till I remember that
I have to interact with the world, game on
Put my human face on like Patrick Bateman
My game face, same face that my mum kiss
So, you don't love this, it don't mean bupkis
White boy rapper, frat boy man
He probably have a drug problem like a grown child actor
Fat boy, have to get in those reps, get an
App boy have to get in those steps
Looking long in the tooth but the truth is I'm strong
And I'm stronger than you in the booth kid, c'mon
I'm so pretty, make 'em all stare at me
Blow my own horn, call me Ron Jeremy
How I take these hits, man I'm convinced
I deserve a purple heart like Prince, my god

Don't let no
One tell you who you are
Be yourself
Don't let no
One tell you who you are
Be yourself
'Cause they fill you with rage
You're like 'Why are you breaking my heart?'

Counterweight,The Great Expanse,2019,"Feel like I'm walking a thin line, balancing thoughts on a zip-tie
I'd let them fly if the quiet would finally silence the voice that is inside
Weighing my words before that I've spoken, day of my birth, caught in the motions
Why do I only feel norm in the eye of the storm by the roar of the ocean
Over and over again, though we both know where this ends
It's sobering knowing that coping alone with this stress, all falls over the edge
Have mercy am I blasphemous? So burn me with fire or cannabis smoke
I've worked all my life with hands on my throat, searching for highs to balance the lows

I've been spending my days with reckless abandon
Searching for balance, I'm drifting away
With no counter weight
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh
I've tried changing my ways, I'm stuck in here, stranded
Searching for balance, I'm drifting away

No, I've got no counter weight

If it's all in front of me why's it awaken the kind of sensation of falling suddenly
Like every step could be pulled from under me, and so it don't all catch up to me
I move at the speed of light, losing my peace of mind
Pursuing my demons, lucid or dreaming? Can't keep doing this, truth is I need a vice
I'm all out of love now, if abandoned my sanity's struck down
Started actually giving a fuck 'bout who's catching me when I come down
I pray that you follow so I'm paving away to escape from this lotto

I'm not lookin' for a good time
I'm just lookin' for the exit sign
I'm just tryna get by
Been here one too many times
I'm not standin' in a bathroom line
I'm just lookin' for the exit sign

I am like, ""Peace"", start fresh like you born-again
Jesus wept, ha, I don't mean it
But don't mind it if it cause offence, we make moves not amends
Feels like you'll never leave, and the chorus went (Ba ba ba ba ba)
Don't care who goes against
Not you not him, not two, not ten, mm-mm
Callin' your bluff, don't call me your friend
You in it for your fifteen minutes, it's quarter past then, goddamn
I'd take a mate's house over this place
Any day out of the calendar dates now
I mean, I ain't even waitin' to bounce
You won't even hear the door hit me on the way out, nah
You ever notice that's how this go?
Ain't it funny how the ones who can flex just don't?
Well, I mean, maybe a little, but you know
They put on a show, we are the show, everybody say

Everybody say hi
Look who's finally arrived
I'm not lookin' for a good time
I'm just lookin' for the exit sign
I'm just tryna get by
Been here one too many times
I'm not standin' in a bathroom line
I'm just lookin' for the exit sign

I am like
""Nope"" I ain't even tryna check in my
Coat, I'm only tryna check in with my
Folks, and my friends they all know that I won't
Stick around for the blah, blah, blah
Conversation here is shallow as a kid's pool
And it's full of people who say 'literally'
When something is not literal
Are you simple, or are you kiddin' with me?
Go hit the floor, man, I'm sure you want to
I'll hit the door, hit the horn and watch Norm McDonald
Man, it's weird to me that when you're in a band you can get
Appearance fees like you were kicked off The Bachelorette
But I don't give a fuck about the money
And I don't give a fuck about the party
Man, anyone that know me know the only thing
I give a fuck about in this phoney world is Ari

If I lose my way (And Poppy)
I know this all amounts to nothin' (So you know)
I've got a million ways for wastin' excess time (I'ma, I'ma get out this stupid club)
But I've got moves to make
And I ain't that self-destructive
I need to bail out towards the exit sign

Everybody say hi
Look who's finally arrived
I'm not lookin' for a good time
I'm just lookin' for the exit sign
I'm just tryna get by
Been here one too many times
I'm not standin' in a bathroom line
I'm just lookin' for the exit sign
Everybody say hi
Look who's finally arrived
I'm not lookin' for a good time

Fire & Grace,The Great Expanse,2019,"Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

If I were, if I were, if I were in your place
If the light that was shining upon you fell on my face
Oh, I would have purpose, I would have peace if I had your fire and grace
If I were, if I were, if I were in your place

I'd never seen you struggling with crisis, who would have thought
That someone so vibrant was suffering in silence?
I just thought if I could take your spot for a day
That would wash all of my problems away, but you wear that
Mirage of perfection like a mask for depression
Never asked if you're okay, only asked for your blessing
I'm fathomless, once I was blind with my judgements
But happiness doesn't coincide with abundance
If we could truly see the beauty in simplicity
Maybe you and me could soothe the beast and live blissfully?
Is it our wonder or the struggle in our nature
That creates a hunger till we're coveting our neighbour?
Because everybody want an ace of diamonds
When they're holding a deck of spades
We're all tryna fill a place inside us
A prison guard to an empty space

If I were, if I were, if I were in your place
If the light that was shining upon you fell on my face
Oh, I would have purpose, I would have peace if I had your fire and grace
If I were, if I were, if I were in your place

Get it
When we find our value in other people's beauty
When all we see is champions and we are just fans
When we're so shallow and impressed by the jewelry
We find it so challenging 'cause we are just Stans
And they are all gods, they are all goddesses
We are just the hive in the halls of our offices
We are just admirers, but find that the thing is
The happiest people that we know, the least ambitious
Look, with success comes the lessons like
Don't get me wrong, I feel blessed, but like every time
I've been sitting in a winning position, I felt confusion
'Cause it didn't feel like winning, just felt like I wasn't losing
I'm trying to destroy my heroes
Because I'm not trying to claw at peaks
I can admire your fire, but still know that we're
All born flawed human beings, you know?

If you were in my place
You'd see your fire and grace

If I were, if I were, if I were in your place
If the light that was shining upon you fell on my face
Oh, I would have purpose, I would have peace if I had your fire and grace
If I were, if I were, if I were in your place

Troubled waters can appear
Calm on the surface
A cool façade can be
Fuelled by a furnace, I got
Grace under fire, you got
Fire and grace
But if I were, if I were, if I were in your place

Lighting up the city street with every step that I take, you feeling me?
Silly me, I thought we all wanted each other to win but
I'm starting to think the ugliest things, the buddies I'm with, the
People I'm 'round wanna cut that, cut that tall tree down
Holding me down, but fuck that, fuck that, get another shelf for the trophy lounge
I would never joke-joke around, I'm sorry but everybody that
Wanted smoke is now b-bodied, and b-b-b-broken down
Yeah, yeah, yeah, show me you palms, join up your thumbs
Take both your index fingers, and point up at the sun

We wandered a path into time, ain't trod this far just to find
I could be forgotten in body or heart and the mind, won't stop till they martyr my dyin'
Hittin' rock bottoms just part of the climb, chasin' a wanderin' star and it's shine

Tryna honour the discipline, find solace to live within
It's constant conditionin', keepin' my focus, rappers thinkin' they're woke just poppin' a Ritalin
So fuck a popular hit and then, sell it off any cost at a minimum
It's not I got a problem with listenin', just ain't buyin' it, cognitive dissidence
I came in the door, no fame or accord, I scraped and I clawed
By grace of the Lord fell straight on my sword, my name on the wall in the face of the law

Here Without You,The Great Expanse,2019,"Hotel lobby still got me waiting
Road's been long, it killed off my patience
Beard game sloppy, you think that I'm probably
Here on vacation, but
I don't want refreshments or breath mints
I want you to check in this guest 'cause I'm restless
I got no reception, the 'net ain't connected
It's just that my girls been expecting a message
And I wish tonight that I could ring that line
I'll live and die by if I did that crime
I miss right, but you're mystified
For all the gifts I buy I can't give you time
There's never enough I know you want more
I ask myself, ""Why I do this for?"" When

Every single thing's a reminder
That I'm here without you

Missing everything about you-ou-ou
I'm here across the world without you
Every single thing's a reminder
That I'm here without you

I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't
Feel this kind of way without breaking up
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't
Feel this kind of way without breaking up

In a hotel hallway
Pacing up and down, walking round 'cause I lost my key
Tryna sell them a story
But I'm talking round and round in circles, man, they want ID
My wallets in the room, sir
So, can you see the problem here?
They're like, ""There's no need to be rude, sir""
Security's like, ""Have we got a problem here?""
I'ma commandeer your phone right quick
If you don't come and open number 256
'Cause I'm in a different time zone and my phone's locked up
So, what ma? Call the cops up, you know what's up
I got a girl waiting on me at home
Across the world all I want is my phone

And every single thing's a reminder
That I'm here without you

Missing everything about you-ou-ou
I'm here across the world without you
I'm here, and I'm here
Every single thing's a reminder
That I'm here without you

Into the Abyss,The Great Expanse,2019,"Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

I feel like I've been here before, real life or dreaming, unsure
When all my travels could all unravel in a heartbeat or a thought
And if my legacy's abolished then whatever we accomplished
Did it for the pedigree, I don't see an enemy, then to me y'all are potentially accomplice
'Cause some men rise above, some men fight enough
Till there struggling becomes them and are defined as such, who the fuck then divided us?
It's like I'm born every morning, die every evening, war at my door reviving my demons
I'd rather die with my convictions than live a life with no meaning, so I
Hold court like the king of the mountain hall, everyone, everything is accountable
Face the music and embrace the truth of all that makes us human then I think I'd be proud of y'all
If I am, all I said I am and we are, all in together and
From where I stand I'm just tryna get a plan to build a better man for this Neverland
Maybe a dreamer, make believer, try escape the ether
But the great deceiver lives inside to feed a basic need for
Identity of own, set me in stone near my legacy to grow then I'll never be alone
It's the music that'll ferry me to home

I'm not lost, I've been following my own path
Not blind, been looking at my future, not past
Ain't done, staring into the abyss daily
Until that man in the mirror ain't me
I'm not lost, I've been following my own path
Not blind, been looking at my future, not past
Ain't done, staring into the abyss daily
Until that man in the mirror ain't me

Ayy
Feel like I've been here before, in the abyss, looking up to the great expanse
Stars in the sky, stars in my eyes, won't stop till their stars in my hands
Feel like I landed on Mars, I feel abandoned in fact
They're all on Dancing with Stars making fun of artists who actually rap
I lost my confidence till I got on my flex
Now can't tell me nothing, 
city all suffering
, tell God he got a Suffa complex
I'm draped in the belt of Orion, I'm praying the truth rings out
They're saying the loud things quiet, we're saying the quiet things loud
I wanna rock right now, want every single rapper on the block wiped out
Everybody coming at the Hilltop, lights out, y
ou're running down seconds on the clock, time out
What? Pipe down, we don't care what you think of us, we're the shit and you can't sit with us
You tryna fly by clinging to Icarus, I'm tryna drive by liquor and cigarettes
I'm tryna be a better man, ask Eddie Vedder man
, 
I'm tryna be Clark
I feel like Letterman, hiding my venom in a coffee mug with a broken heart
Open bars probably going to kill me if all this touring don't
From the heart sincerely, all I want really is to watch my children grow

I'm not lost, I've been following my own path
Not blind, been looking at my future, not past
Ain't done, staring into the abyss daily
Until that man in the mirror ain't me
I'm not lost, I've been following my own path
Not blind, been looking at my future, not past
Ain't done, staring into the abyss daily
Until that man in the mirror ain't me",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-into-the-abyss-lyrics
Leave Me Lonely,The Great Expanse,2018,"Let's get it...

Said he wanna go outside and to chop it up
I'm like, 'Cough it up, bruh, is it not enough
I'm nodding off?' God, what a load of poppycock
If he popping off I gotta sock him with a mollywop
What does it take? For you to get the message, huh?
You're rude and kind of messy, da?
Now my mood is quite depressing who are you impressing?
Loser, I won't dress it up
Me and my friends, we are not here for your bullshit
I don't care who you're cool with, or where you went to school, kid
Nah-uh-uh, my buddies at the bar waiting
And I'm too young to be hating, but too old to be patient
So all right

Man, we'll be all right
Woah!

He said to me 'Look, I'm sorry, I'm not myself
I smoked some weed, took some Molly, can't stop myself
It's like I bleed then I worry I cut myself'
I said, 'Yo please, leave me lonely, leave me alone and lonely!'

Each time that you open your mouth a little calm inside me dies
Peace sign and you know that I'm out before I feel the tsunami rise
Man I'm sick of this, ridiculous I've listened to your gibberish
I figure that you need to quit and go
Is there no limit to your ignorance or spirit of ambivalence?
I think that is a no
Huh, ever found it's relieving?
Trying to hold in the sound of your breathing
Silence is golden, you're louder than cheap bling
So ride like it's stolen, bounce for this evening
Man, I don't need the hostility
Your beef don't feed my virility
Cease with the litany, are you seeking to trigger me?
Kidding me? Seriously? You'll be all right

You'll be all right
Woah!

I smoked some weed, took some Molly, can't stop myself
It's like I bleed then I worry I cut myself'

I see red like a bull to a matador
See red like I'm dressed like I'm Santa Claus
See red like I'm asking for the manager
See red like cardiovascular
I'd rather be a passenger on the Challenger
Rather lick a sneeze guard on a salad bar
Rather have it off with a lathered-up Labrador
Than explore your character, jabber-jaw
This all I can endure
You're your own saboteur
I had to draw a line, I'm trying
To spend time with my Paramore
You're like Paul Manafort, a giant and spineless jellyfish
A Man O' War
, I'm a man of war, be silent
All right

Man, we'll be all right
Woah!

I smoked some weed, took some Molly, can't stop myself

It's not right
I have to hide in the shadows all night
It's not fair
It seems like at every turn you are there
It's not right
I have to hide in the shadows all night
I gotta sit and listen
Grind my teeth and clench my fists

I am just a grain of sand getting washed from God's hands
I am nothing but a lamb in the great expanse
An ape staring into space, so damn insignificant
Primal on the vinyl, I am cro-magnificent
Title after title 'cause I’m programmed different
Dictate a flow that toe-tags dissidents
No, my man, we don’t go ham, listen in
We go Jon Hamm, with the double M, triple threat
Nice day, isn’t it? Not for workaholics
Open Logic, and work the program like an alcoholic
Man, anybody fucking with P, I’ll beat you like Tyson
Beat Larry Homes out of love for Ali
Suffa MC, tell me now, who wanna suffer?
Want them nuts on your chin like Ponda Baba? Nuh-uh

I keep one foot upon your throat, the other foot in the grave
So kill my vibe, I’m still alright, can’t be stripped of the essence
I’ve hit my strides signified but the vicious intentions
But still they try to vilify and kill the progression
Like a stripper inside a gift I’m tryna live in the present
Ooft, we fight the madness we know
It’s sad your battling my shadow when I’ve survived the baddest of both
Dagger and cloak, bro, I hope you die from gagging on smoke
That’s why I’m pissing on the fire you’ve been fanning your hope

Sometimes I stop and wonder why conjuring something bothers others
They ain't gonna love you just to love you like Donna Summers
We’re conquerors brother, just drop the gun and don’t be so
Reckless, put down your arms like Ponda Baba

What Becomes of Us,The Great Expanse,2019,"Words fail me, tryna convey, the right thing to say
But they're written in the lines on my face
They're like a road map to show you the way
No tomorrow if there's no today,
 'cause
Time will take all we've left, we've only now
So fly away
, 
hold your breath
 and 
don't look down
What becomes of us? If our mistakes are the sum of us
Missing all the beauty right in front of us

Here we are
Our pride got a hold of us
One road too far
Our past blindfolding us
Here we are
Our world in front of us
If we lose our path
Then what becomes of us?
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

Every road of my life, I've had to build across a broken divide
Cornered animals only know how to fight
, so why's it feel like
For winning every argument, I lose a little part of us?
If I concede that I could be the feud within this partnership
Then I don't know where I stand, maybe lately
I been focused on my own just trying to broker a plan
If everything's left unspoken then I know that we're damned
And we'll keep drowning with this weight tied to both of our hands
But don't mistake my silence for my withdraw
'Cause only people caught inside a war say it's worth fighting for
If this encompasses us, what becomes of us?
Missing all the beauty right in front of us

Here we are
Our pride got a hold of us
One road too far
Our past blindfolding us
Here we are
Our world in front of us
If we lose our path
Then what becomes of us?

""How much do you drink at night? 'Cause that's how much I spill""
I tried to drown my demons, but my demons they grew gills,

Feel I have no chill but don't want my heart to give 'cause
I'm a father and I've got two other hearts to live for
Frida said, ""Viva La Vida'""
I'ma meet her on the other side and fall at her feet I've
Never heard such good advice
, 
not here to pass the time
I'm here to map a story on my face with laughter lines, right?
We can't see the path sometimes 'cause of our busy lives, like
We can't see the stars at night 'cause of the city lights,
 I
Need to step away and find my balance
Redecorate my mind palace,
 
my, my, Alice
I went down the rabbit-hole to find my sadness
And crush it like it's Adderall,
 
I mind my manners
And try to be kind
 
when I find my answers
I'm going to be fine

Here we are (Are)
Our pride got a hold of us
One road too far
Our past blindfolding us
Here we are (Here we are)
Our world in front of us (Ooh)

An Audience with the Devil,The Hard Road,2006,"""When people hear about some psycho killer, it can lead them to thinking about the nature of evil, which leads to thoughts about right or wrong – bad or good.""
""All that thinking can get ugly.""
""Yeah! You don’t want to consider a crack like that. You just want them to go through their routine of living their lives.""
""What do you do to gut their souls?""

I was granted an audience in the devils maze
I sat by his throne and we talked for days
He told me 'bout his ancient battles with arch-angels
He told me loneliness was a torture most painful
He said if I filled my lifetime with sin
I could earn myself a seat that was right by him
If I didn’t, that was fine by him
'Cause every day a million souls just fly right in
He could barely keep up with the souls of all the people
It’s not easy being sole controller of all evil
He said, “So many people wanna burn with me
I swear free will's a bitch and so’s eternity
So what you learn from me might save you from suffering
You don’t wanna see the bowels of the earth rupturing
Take a breath, suck it in, I got more to tell
And time’s of no consequence when you’re in hell.”

""What do you do to gut their souls?""
""I don’t do squat anymore. They do it all for you.""
""I’m not sure I’m following.""
""Mankind has progressed to a point in its dim-witted history where life has been drained of all of its enchantment.""

I had a lot of questions
I asked the devil to explain...
""Why I always think that people have it in for me?
And why I always feel like the sky's closing in on me?""
This is what he said:
""The sky's not falling it's just angels committing suicide
'Cause they're so saddened by humans using genocide
As a political tool, considering all
You humans have, the way you act belittles you all
Now hell is so full that we started expanding
Damnation is a business and the markets demanding""
I asked him if a city street buckled and cracked
And hell rose to earth then would heaven collapse?
He smiled; I knew that smile was his response
I thought to myself, he's almost got what he wants
He said, ""I'll tell you my one desire
That's for earth itself to become my empire
Every politician's like a gun for hire
Even the church of nativity's come under fire
So you can tell I'm getting close to my goal
Of creating a world where I can torture every soul""

Sitting with the devil, this is what I learned
Apart from the ways a human soul can be burned, it's that
Though we learn from our mistakes we're condemned
To make those same mistakes again and again
Sitting with the devil, this is what I learned
Apart from the ways a human soul can be burned, it's that
Though we learn from our mistakes we're condemned
To make those same mistakes again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again

Cheah
And time keeps, time keeps slipping away
Like I keep, I keep slipping away
My time keeps, time keeps slipping away
Like I keep, I keep slipping away
My time keeps, time keeps slipping away
Like I keep, I keep slipping away
My time keeps, time keeps slipping away
Like I keep, I keep slipping away, I keep slipping away

Breathe,The Hard Road,2006,"In life, we struggle as individuals
A fine line between a cliché saying and something original
As if in death we left something residual
Behind to mark our time up in this pitiful
Existence, and I'm a man of many issues
If I ever dissed you, no disrespect I never wished to
Hold a grudge, the stress makes me act like this
The day I get it off my chest I won’t write tracks like this
But I'll be bitter on them when all is done and is forgotten
Cos it’s easier to sit and complain than fix the problem
But the power of speech endowers our beliefs
With sour defeats, man nothing is out of reach
Got plenty to answer for, all I do is answer back
Done a thousand things I regret, apologise for none of that
So you get back what you put in, no regret
And keep on until they know your sweat, you only get

One chance, so I live for the moment
I'm just one man, what I wouldn't give for this moment
We got one world; still we take it in stride
In this one life we stand still waiting to die
We get one chance, so I live for the moment
I'm just one man, what I wouldn't give for this moment
We got one world; still we take it in stride
In this one life we stand still waiting to die
Now breathe in

""They can’t—they can't
Can’t bre—bre—breathe—breathe
They can’t—they can't
They can’t—an’t—an’t—an’t—can’t breathe""

Now if life is what you make it it’s time to build
Man I'm for real ain't no telling what this life will yield
I'm a career man, cos I career off any path
That would lead me to a start of financial gains I'm scarred
We learn from our mistakes, that makes me a scholar on
Being a walking talking fuck up and a better man for being wrong
I'm humble and loyal, my friendships are honoured
A man's success ain't measured by the depths of his pocket
I give good advice but never follow it, what’s left for me?
I'm a hypocrite, and if I weren't I’d be a success story
View this wide world through a narrow gaze, these harrowed days
Seen too many men end in a shallow grave
I guess it’s better to have loved and to lost, than never stumbled across
The gift of knowing you whatever the fucking cost
To put it in perspective and under my vision
This world is superficial; I'm done with others opinions, we get

One chance, so I live for the moment
I'm just one man, what I wouldn't give for this moment
We got one world; still we take it in stride
In this one life we stand still waiting to die
We get one chance, so I live for the moment
I'm just one man, what I wouldn't give for this moment
We got one world; still we take it in stride
In this one life we stand still waiting to die
Now breathe out

Circuit Breaker,The Hard Road,2006,"Hello darling, Suffa. Hope the reason you're not answering the phone is because you are finishing your album. The operative word would be 'finishing.' Keep in touch

I got to jump back and kiss myself
The Hoods have come back to rip this girl
Live on the drum track, man, you dissed yourself
So drunk that you nearly pissed yourself
And if you come whack you risk your health
I'm the one that made LL ring the bells
Sharp as a thumb tack, it's the infidel
In the back with some girl named Isabelle
And I'm a, you're gonna what? I'm a wreck this, the freshest
Thermoelectric's, technics and a setlist
So check this, Hilltop lock jaws like tetanus
Fuck breakfast at Tiffany's, I want Tiffany for breakfast
(What up? What up?) 
The funk leader, told you last LP
With a style that make you smile like a Chelsea
Smile, (What the fuck's that man?) It's when you place
Razor blades on the cheeks then a kick to the face
In the place and we raising the roof
Like Al Qaeda placed a case in the booth
A taste of the truth and some flawless shit
Like John Howard knows the taste of George's dick!
Man, I'm born to spit these kids wish they stuck me
I warn you kid you're bitch made like puppies
Switch blade to Nazis' cut them through their khakis
I lose it every time I put it down like car keys

What a clever line. Lose it every time I put it down like car keys
That is a really good line. What a good line. Holy shit I am the greatest
I am the greatest, and you hate it
I am the greatest, and you hate it

Honestly man that's ridiculous. Seriously you're out of control. ""I'm the greatest, and you hate it."" Whatever

I got this feelin' that it's---I got this feelin' that it's
I got this feelin' that it's back again
So don't touch me, cause I'm electric
They ain't gonna wait a minute
Don't touch me, cause I'm electric
(Hold up, wait a minute)
Don't touch me, cause I'm electric
They ain't gonna wait a minute
Don't touch me, cause I'm electric
And if you touch me, you'll get shocked

Dudes it's Terry here. Hey look, um. I've been waiting on this master for three days now man. It's way delayed and overdue, please give me a call
.

It only takes one minute to bust
But takes these two to raise them standards up
Take three, Debris man the cuts
This is for, those that will stand with us
From sundown into the dawn didn't I warn?
The lyrical storm hits you in a physical form
This isn't your norm, didn't reform, isn't your average
Wishing to score listeners for pitiful crap it's
Off Richter, sicker than cough fits you
Listen to pop hits? This isn't your soft shit you
All in the mix so start warning the kids
They're adopted and not that they were born with a gift
I'm so fatal that reverends won't stay till confession
You all can't hold your own like post natal depression
I've got a mouth of profanity, a spouse and a family
At my house man no wonder that I'm doubting my sanity
I'm an honest drunk, what a mentality
Avoiding the truth is staying sober; I'm an addict of reality
I live for tomorrow so cheating death today
Means at all costs avoid repeating yesterday
I'm a loose cannon, enough juice to soothe famine
Break your back with this rap then ask you who's slamming?
Some rappers claiming a throne, unaware they
Ain't kings only royalty they know is airplay

Feelin' that it's back again
So don't touch me, cause I'm electric
They ain't gonna wait a minute
Don't touch me, cause I'm electric
(Hold up, wait a minute)
Don't touch me, cause I'm electric
They ain't gonna wait a minute
Don't touch me, cause I'm electric
And if you touch me, you'll get shocked

Hey guys, this is Pegz. Pick up your phone will ya? You better be in the bloody studio finishing this album anyway. If you don't hurry up, we're gonna be calling the album ""The Broke Arse Long Road.""

City of Light,The Hard Road,2006,"I’m from the city of light, with a sky of vanilla
Known as the city of churches home of the serial killer
And in the summer it feels like a hundred degrees
""Where I’m from you might see"" Suffa MC
Walking the traps trying to escape the map
Ninety one was my shit, I’m trying to take it back
To when writers ran the line and transits ran the gambit
My memories the paint, let the track be my canvas
Thirteen sitting in a park, sipping wine casks
Watching whole cars as they went flying past
I couldn’t paint so I rhymed to the writers
They’d laugh, light up a smoke, and get blinded by their lighters
‘Nasty Arts’ ran my line evading cop cars
And we looked up to them like they were rock stars
Paint stained hands and fame like Manson
That’s Charles not Marilyn
, a city held to ransom
Cans and markers, Country Road parkers
Hands of an artist left the landscape enchanted
Until the government pigs had all the paint washed
From our city walls, end of the renaissance
And so the walls where the colours once played
Were replaced by the buff, now a sullen blunt grey
White washed, shitty, all grey, all black
Waiting for the kids of this city to take their walls back

I’m from the city of light, with a sky of vanilla
Known as the city of churches home of the serial killer
And in the winter, the city sleeps dead in the freeze
""Where I’m from you might"" see Pressure MC
Walking the traps trying to escape the map
Ninety three was my shit, I’m trying to take it back
Got kicked out of school but I would have left in time
With nothing but an ego and rap to get me by
I swept floors, packed orders, when poor racked from Porters
Liked a store just to score me a four track recorder
Fifteen, sneaking in the back door to the gig
Thought I could rip, bro trust me I fought for this shit
'Cause the city’s darker than a starless night
And treats a starter like a fresh piece of meat, greet the carving knife
Till the day came when I’d scar consortiums
I’d lay waiting, train stations and parks my audience
Before we had our beats made, before we had a DJ
We’d rock to a beat box, before that shit was clichéd
You see mate, I refused to lay low and gave those
Better years of my life to pave roads
Live as hell, we did it by ourselves
The only secret to this shit is one that time will tell
So breathe in cos the city invites, jealously, pity and blight
You’re in the city of light",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-city-of-light-lyrics
Clown Prince,The Hard Road,2006,"Oi, P, it's your round
Nah, it's your round
Oi, it's your fucking round, man, I got the last fucking round!
Hey, you still owe me five anyway, bro! You get the round!
Fuck, it's your round, dude

It's your round, if you're hanging at the back of the bar
So just bounce like you're banging in the back of your car
We turn it out; Hilltop, we've been down since
Back in the days, I'm the clown prince
It's your round, if you're hanging at the back of the bar
So just bounce like you're banging in the back of your car
We turn it out; Hilltop, we've been down since
Back in the days when I was a teenager

Uh, first up, on the dolcet tones of the Gravy Bone Project
Suffa MC came to take you home
I drip lyrics like spits, spit lyrics like drips
In the arms, I'll lick your spirit with my miracle whip
Whip, 'cause what I'm hearing's all shit on the lyrical tip
Nah, I ain't feeling ya, kid, we gave you
Something to jock, but it wasn't no thing
Like Bobby gave Whitney a rock but it wasn't no ring
(Thanks, Bobby!)
And I'ma keep at 'em, crossing my fingers that eve
Says keep Adam, I'm going down on the weeds
And I'm a wreak havoc, little man with a big pen
I got dirty habits like a nun in a pig pen
Like drinking, smoking, cursing, sucking
Titties representing the city that I grew up in
We laid the path so you got a way in
It's Hilltop; we're three stars like a Holiday Inn

It's your round, if you're hanging at the back of the bar
So just bounce like you're banging in the back of your car
We turn it out; Hilltop, we've been down since
Back in the days, I'm the clown prince
It's your round, if you're hanging at the back of the bar
So just bounce like you're banging in the back of your car
We turn it out; Hilltop, we've been down since
Back in the days when I was a teenager

Next up, when I get loose with no fail
Appealing like the naked truth and the truth is for sale
So when I leave, yo, you’re fucking with my pride
I don’t see though
Typical MC, my nuts don’t match the size of my ego
I seize an opportunity 'cause they don’t linger
The glass ain't half-empty, it's half-full
That's why I'm a table drinker
Think you're on Pressure's level? Only thing tight, bro
That you might show is dressed in several of your wife's clothes
An arrogant fucker damaging suckers masterfully
If I married your mother you still wouldn’t be half of me
You should run from me, fuck battling, ain't nothing sweet
'Cause I won’t beat you to the punch, I’ll punch you to the beat
Don’t get offended by the rubbish that we pump in the street
My foot's always in my mouth, I just can't stomach defeat
I'ma master these until it's hard to breathe
It's Hilltop, we're the first to come, last to leave

It's your round, if you're hanging at the back of the bar
So just bounce like you're banging in the back of your car
We turn it out; Hilltop, we've been down since
Back in the days, I'm the clown prince
It's your round, if you're hanging at the back of the bar
So just bounce like you're banging in the back of your car
We turn it out; Hilltop, we've been down since
Back in the days when I was a teenager

Man, I'm smooth like Marlon Brando at thirty
At my peak like Marlon Brando at fifty
And I'm fat like Marlon Brando at seventy
Fuck it; no MC could ever better me (No one, man)
And half the time, half my crew could drink the bar
And half these cats ain't half of what they think they are
We independent, I'd sign on the line
The day me giving you the finger is a sign of the times
Man, their rhymes are designed to try diss us, but why diss us?
I don't rewind to try to find disses
Man, I just recline and mind my business
And I think in lines in rhymes, the rhyme stitches
Up the minds of the lines of dimes and fine...
I pen letters that kill (Hey, what the fuck?)
They stab ya neck with a feather until you've bled in my quill
This veteran's ill, thinking you can better my skill
You need medicine, chill, a Pressure vendetta's for real

It's your round, if you're hanging at the back of the bar
So just bounce like you're banging in the back of your car
We turn it out; Hilltop, we've been down since
Back in the days, I'm the clown prince
It's your round, if you're hanging at the back of the bar
So just bounce like you're banging in the back of your car

Conversations From A Speakeasy,The Hard Road,2006,"Alright ladies and gentlemen here we go...

Let’s get introductions aside
Pressure, Omni and Suffa tonight busting the mic like
Lately I’ve been hearing nothing but hype
Pen’s mightier than your sword? Then you’d be fucked in a fight
From the point of the exact conception I’ve had perfection
And you ain't close to Omni even though you may lack direction
I’ve got a good heart, but bad intentions
Pressure don’t need a map for reference I’m a man of legends
I’ll last forever like bad impressions
Like the first night you cursed in adolescence
The way I slam a sentence can panic veterans
Some things are better left unsaid like anything that I have to mention
My loud mouths my downfall it’s doubtful
I’ll bite off more than I can chew cos I already got a mouthful
Act like I astound y'all, well I’m a scoundrel
With enemies but cliché is a friend of me, I’m out y'all

Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
Relax your mind, let your conscience be free

Pull up a chair, and kick your feet on the table
Let down you hair, lean back in your seat if you’re able
We’ve got the Jazz, for your speakeasy conversations
It’s the universal language of relaxation

The heart of the giant, the eye of the lion
The smell of victory is what makes me keep trying
My will to survive is like I’m stranded on an island
I keep rhyming; keep climbing till somebody find me
My city’s been behind me since the mid nineties
Right around the time when it was cool to be grimy
My DJ used to make the earth spin in reverse
Put the needle to the dirt, spread the word like you heard it first
Now it’s all twisted, somebody told the truth but they missed it
I put it on my CD but they skipped it
But that’s what happens when you do something different
Some people can just stay content with the simple shit
I live my life fast like it’s my last
I don’t trip off of cash or dwell in the past
I’m bigger than that; I’m bigger than rap
(One of the sickest emcees on the map) for bringing that back

Pull up a chair, and kick your feet on the table
Let down you hair, lean back in your seat if you’re able
We’ve got the Jazz, for your speakeasy conversations
It’s the universal language of relaxation

I heard there ain’t no party like an open bar
We lay out rhymes like drinks for a broken heart
Heartbreak like liquor in an open scar
So bizarre, roll thick like smokers tar
Tell me who can rock parties with no guitar
And if I ain't getting paid then I’m leaving in the promoters car
Tell me who you know this far
Gone, on till the moments…
Gone, on till the break of this governments back
And it’s on till my mates are all loving the tracks
No thugs in his raps, no muggings or macks
And no guns, just trying to get us up on the map
Bust, Suffa on wax, trust it’s on
I’m trying to do for rhyme what digital cameras did for porn
Born in a small town, die with a big mouth
Hoods tore it all down, shouts to the kids south

Pull up a chair, and kick your feet on the table
Let down you hair, lean back in your seat if you’re able
We’ve got the Jazz, for your speakeasy conversations
It’s the universal language of relaxation
Pull up a chair, and kick your feet on the table
Let down you hair, lean back in your seat if you’re able
We’ve got the Jazz, for your speakeasy conversations
It’s the universal language of relaxation
Pull up a chair, and kick your feet on the table
Let down you hair, lean back in your seat if you’re able
We’ve got the Jazz, for your speakeasy conversations
It’s the universal language of relaxation
Pull up a chair, and kick your feet on the table
Let down you hair, lean back in your seat if you’re able
We’ve got the Jazz, for your speakeasy conversations
It’s the universal language of relaxation",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-conversations-from-a-speakeasy-lyrics
I Can’t Take It,The Hard Road,2006,"I tried so hard
To live my life
With these kinda people round me
With these kinda people round me
My friend just told me
To keep my head high
Oh, don't you worry, don't worry

Tell me people

Can't take it no more

Man, I feel this pain
And I realise the game ain't shit
'Cause I've signed these kids arms where they've tried to drain their wrists
And that's as deep as it gets, son
Deeper than an old drunk beating his step son (Damn)
Now how you gonna mess with a loved one and beat 'em?
It's like this demon wanted kids just to mistreat 'em
As street preachers scream at the heathens
Man, we've been caught up in a net like sea creatures
Free speech is speechless, we just don't care that they took it
(We don't care) We just don't care that they're crooked
Corruption's like cocaine and everybody's just so high (
So high, so high
)
And they're all so good looking, man, fuck that (Fuck that, man)
That kid's got gravel on
His knees from the ground that he grovel on
Matchstick Babylon burn it to the ground, churn it up, rip it up
""Turn it upside down, burn it up""
And grandfathers died on battlefields so we could die in toilet floors
Smack up, pass out and soil our drawers
Cut throat, blood soaks and soils our shores
We got a war for oil that gives us oil for wars
, fuck that, man
'Cause I'm a believer, I love life
I love pieces like they don't love either
My love is deeper, my brother's keeper
It's like they want to set us all now chuck the fucking ether
What?

I tried so hard
To live my life
With these kinda people round me
With these kinda people round me
My friend just told me
To keep my head high
Oh, don't you worry, don't worry
You always...

Tell me people
I just gotta know
I can't, can't take it
Can't take it no more
Tell me people
I just gotta know
I can't, can't take it
Can't take it no more

Is the world made of plastic?
Is the city buried in schemes? Ain't it tragic?
Capture we rage and to lay in traffic
Till it beats us into shape like a hated blacksmith
Writing blue collar change, a kid escaping notice
When the fuck we became the process?
Tainted focus, straining, so stressed, pain of slow death
No! Burn it down in the name of progress
We see, teach and grow the most lethal foe
When he kills for a reason he don't even know
While media's feeding your evening show
Like vampire's getting high on other people's lows
So while the courts are choked with matters
The only status that counts is the amount over balance
'Cause credit is a loan attached to a rope and ladder
If you don't know the swagger, the cloak and dagger
Sex workers, street urchins, houses
Squaller, glad the churches got merchants out, we've got 'em
Got murderous politics, don't be absurd
It's gonna surface hidden by the courteous bounds of honour
And in the hope I'll cope I'll get over
A flow with the dope and lines in Le Coka Nostra
And I'm focused to know where the loves at
Y'all gotta go, let it come back

Tell me people
I just gotta know
I can't, can't take it
Can't take it no more
Tell me people
I just gotta know
I can't, can't take it
Can't take it no more

Moan, like I fucked with the pitch man
This land where the bricks stand
On red sands, I spit grams of powdered Difflam
To ease your muscle pain, through the hustle
Came to tussle against the corporate gain man
Parcels move train to plane in the struggle
Markers give a claim to fame in the jungle
Street revolutionaries, we the evolutionary
Anomalies, but stupidly they try stopping me
That's only making me a martyr, we
Like opiates in the vein, attack the arteries
Don't get smart with me; I got a heart in me
Like Phar Lap and gone so far rap's now a part of me
I got camaraderie, the great unwashed
I got a heart in me that pumps straight up scotch
But crews still try to diss me, till I switch it on em

These are the last of days, a vast array
Of fake fucks up in a masquerade
It's swim or drown, we act we don't sink
It's primal instinct: we rap, we don't think
It's do or die, no turning back like suicide
Till you're doing time with these cut throats in a suit and tie
So don't feed the animals, or act a fool
I'm just one man, a young lamb amongst a pack of wolves
So while you're fighting over scraps and loose change and moot claims
Pressures higher up in the food chain
And small time predators rove in packs
That why big time executives throw them scraps
So much static that this is such a hazardous business
And having to witness that half these rappers are bitches
Got me laughing hysterically, I've the heart of a pedigree
So pissing on the next man is just marking my territory
Rivals will claim over head strong beef
And try, fighting for fame on these slept on streets
While I'm, signing my name in the wet concrete
Touching both sides of your brain when I flex on beats
And when we sound the drums, I'll see cowards hung
When my hour comes I'd rather catch a beat down than run
It's just that honest, I don't rap for these monsters
I'd rather face the music than turn my back on you

And I'm known to hold flows like the glass you drop drinking
Never crawled man I started off limping
Plus I rock a fella like I know the art of parking lot pimping yeah
You people know of Mys, the one whose flow's crazy
And is so gravy that it should come with a bowl of rice

And get you out your seat quicker than corrupt politicians

Deep into the music and his art man, his true love
(Hilltop Hoods)  {Obese} *Lowlifes*

With one pen too high to overextend
In dreamland with freedom starting again
With foresight thrive on the magic of life
And five fingers plus a mic make sick shit, Braintax
Fuck Tony Blair like I hate George Bush
Another seven day week, you ready for the push?
Through the eight million stories that you can't write down
Start again from the top, come on people bounce

Man all these pollies in power are cowards so it's only fair
That I hate John Howard like I hate Tony Blair
And I croon like Tony Bennet in a rental tux
Experimental cuts, with the Brando Flux and Mys Diggy
No one's as fly as these kings
I'll leave you beside yourself like Siamese twins
We're so deep, so nice, so full of promise
But obese, lowlifes man what woman would want us?
We're like some hooded up bombers out storming the yard
We're going large like a junkie out pawning his car
This is the core of the art, and it's all from the heart
This music put your life together when it's falling apart
 {Suffa} *Braintax*]

It's the next chapter, where's all my heads at?
You slept at the fact that we crept back to
Set factors straight, the only dead rappers
Are penned at the papes of no cred actors
Those haters, no you don't fade us
You don't know shit, so you're on a need to know basis
For those gracious folk with no status
I made this flow for you, no your own name is
Not a part of the bigger picture, listen it's the
Middle finger that you put up in a fixture
Life's a bitch and it'll hit ya, if I could pimp women
Like I do words I'd be living literature
Hip Hop's a circus act, this is absurd but fact
One critic or cynic for every that learned to rap
One lyric with gimmick for every with purpose that
Furthered rap culture round the earth and back
But some diss when I'm up in your face
You're a man of your word; you got nothing to say
I got respect for my scene and love for the place
Where I bled for my dreams and struggled for change
We're still striving on, we're still alive and strong
Right or wrong I'd still kill for where I belong
Insightful on the real deal when I write a song
Question, you still feel the vibe I'm on?

""If you feel the vibe""

""That beautiful sound I'm loving""

""It's Mr. Suffa"" 
""MC""
""Oi Suff, you in there?""

I had the whole crowd like
""Oh shit"", that's right I said it, I'll be like
Da, da, da, da, roll like the credits
Two of the best to ever edit poetics, 
it be the
Three headed beast from Obese come to set it
Off, Hilltop in the place, ""sir just calm down""
Spit fire on stage and burn your bar down
You hear it bumping in clubs, you turn your car round
You hear it pumping in pubs, you buy the bar a round
Pump it up in your car; turn your car to a club
(Smash through the wall of a pub) and burn the bar down
(Just burn the bar down), like a disco inferno
(MCs are the only thing we burn though)
I'm the arsonist like Rakim is
So ask your kids who the number one artist is
Obese got the mad fucking roster while
(Your crew couldn't even) house a foster child!
You're flamboyant like Oscar Wilde, I gots to smile
When you panic on stage like you lost a child
""Where's Benny?"", Benny's across the road watching Hilltop
'Cause they got the flow the hills have still got
Funk, the skills, the beats to get nice on
Don't need drugs, I get a buzz when the mic's on
So hit the floods Suffa like it with the lights on
Hilltop, we're what's left when the vibe's gone

""If you feel the vibe""

Stopping All Stations,The Hard Road,2006,"The next train to Adelaide will depart from platform one. Stopping all stations

Early morn, train station, aching from the arthritis
This war veteran knows what a hard time is
He needs his pension, dementia and half blind is
The reason he rides the train with no car license
So he boards with an expired ticket, has a swipe
Gets a fine 'cause the change he got don't add up right
We're talking about a man who never lived a lavish life
Caught up in the age of computer chips and satellites
A lovely lady boards looking tired and half awake
He smiles, she's reminds him of his wife that passed away
She says something as she walks right past his way
His old hearing aid don't last quite half the day
Some young gentlemen alive with their laughter
Approach the old timer and put a knife to his heart to
Explain that money or blood's the price of their barter
To a man whose friends probably died for their fathers

""Taking a train, taking a train"" ""I—I—
I head toward the train—tra—train station""
""Riding the caboose to hell"" ""W—W—
We're from a city heroin loves, the devil's in charge""

Whatever it takes can justify
Whatever ends we make, whatever the price
To the end of a life, it's just an observation
So take a ride, we're stopping all stations

It's been a long night, the sun's lifting on a cold
Morning but she's drugged and drunk, tripping on her stroll
On the way home, she's done with stripping on a pole
But she can't pay for her son, living on the dole
Jumps a train, puts on her gloves, she's wearing black
Being watched by some old mug, she's glaring back
She's on edge and got the bug from sharing smack
So she says, ""Hey, what the fuck you staring at?""
He smiles, an unsteady hand rubs on his dome
She takes a seat, a messy band of ruffs board alone
To the digger with a machete at his lungs and he's prone
He can barely stand but ready to stand up for his own
She tries to help him, she doesn't choose to flee the car
And catches a blow with enough bruise to leave a scar
She starts fainting, the room's moving and seeing stars
Ain't it amazing how courageous human beings are?

""Taking a train, taking a train""
""Toward the train—tra—train—train station""
""Riding the caboose to hell"" ""W—W—
We're from a city heroin loves, the devil's in charge""

Whatever it takes can justify
Whatever ends we make, whatever the price
To the end of a life, it's just an observation
So take a ride, we're stopping all stations

He knows nothing but toil, strife and hard yakka
Pissed at the world for playing wife in a slammer
This man was never given a life or damn platter
So he jumps a train with knife and bandanna
Boys at his back, sleazy, hardened and far
From giving a fuck, an easy target his mark
Sees an old man and says ""See we part with your hard
Earned cash or rest in peace, we can start with your heart""
Some girl steps, not afraid she's gonna cop it sweet
And gets decked before she made it even on her feet
The old man leapt to her aid and to his horror he's
Thrusted his chest into the blade of his robber's piece
He grabbed the wallet, dropped the knife as he fled the car
Concerned about the loss of life he'd never went this far
What's done is done, he'd got the prize and he'd spent his half
Of two dollars in change and a pension card

So take a ride, cause we stoppin' all stations",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-stopping-all-stations-lyrics
The Blue Blooded,The Hard Road,2006,"We have a whole lot of superstars on this stage here tonight
And I want you to know one thing, this is...

Hilltop, that's where the blood runs
Thick, it's where kings bury there loved ones
Sick, kids guard their crop with a slug gun
From rips, move like Schapelle on a drug run
So quick, there's kids in the park waiting
These are my poison diaries like Mark Latham
So start hating, though you know in your heart
We've been owning this art since our flow in the park

You can't serve me like Serena and Venus
Comparatively I leave you looking like the machinist
Cats know they've been hit, when I spike the mic level
And draw blood like intravenous
Without a pencil I'm hell bent
Leave dents in the condenser, you can tell when
Mortar's been in the booth to rhyme
I don't scratch vinyl, I scratch up the mic with my canines

Mr Trials, young ladies jump in the sack
I never kiss and tell instead I fuck it and brag
I'm an angry drunk when I'm grabbing a rum
And scull shots till we fall from grace like Eric Clapton's son
Check, south of the country, west of the city
Chip into that kitty if we're going to be drinking until the skank pretty
Will he attack? When he snap, got the track like
Bring it back, hear him rap? Isn't that Funkoars?
You can find us staggered in a cypher
Turning human traffic to a five car pile up
We leave them all for dead
I used to think big till it killed L, Pun, Smalls and Kev
Like bad move, got you looking like you're eavesdropping the devil
And T set the theme to send them to hell
Bet on it, you're never better, I tell them again
Seddy bury every adversary he put against

Fresh off the boat with an impressive approach
To writing rhymes like pressing your throat
The unquestionable dopeness, and oh yes
It's the one and only, in the house like the gun is on me
Got you gronks saying ""blimey he's clever
He's brighter than that sun in the shiniest of weather""
Girls you want diamonds forever?
Well throw your hymens the sky if you feel the vibe

None of gravities properties are on top of me
Can't hold me back from taking a stab like Chopper Read
Can't hold me back, I'm back around again like stalkers
My mic holds a force like a sword or a tomahawk
To Conan, walking with no man now
Cos you freeze when you spit like a snow mans mouth
Arouse with every word, first you've got to know this
We don't belong together like Rove and showbiz

And we what? - Run with crew
Whose what? - Blood is blue
Through life's - Fucking zoo
And we might - Come for you
And we what? - Run with crew
Whose what? - Blood is blue
Through life's - Fucking zoo
And we might - Come for you

The saga begin, RPM drama again
My lung burn, dangerous carcinogen
Starving like Stalin in parliament in Prague again
In camouflage targeting
In Rock Creek Park, carve terror in the bark
Blueprint, build pyramids in the dark
The blood run deep, renegade creep
Hilltop connect bro, centigrade heat

Muph, some give me shit for my name
But I don't give a shit about you shit for brains
Been a long while so I know the game
It's more about music than your clothing range
We're here to overtake, setting the standard
Obese crew, we're the devilish family
Stand on stage accepting a Grammy
For the most incredible rapping since edible panties
Unforgettable pansies in a flickering fit
Knickers in a twist in a spiral of shit
Undeniable gift with decipherable spits
My fireball pit will burn you Muppets
True rugged, blue blooded dignitary
Crews love it when we do something visionary
Move up never lose touch, living ready
This is the hard road cargo hitting heavy

Robby Balboa bless the text
Deliver you ticket to death
Rivers of rhythm ripping the flesh
Triple your bets on the primitive pest
Selling sick smut from the cinema steps
It begins with a breath, a kid killing his pets
Just sitting in debt when I'm feeling a wreck
Life's a bitch and so we're wringing her neck
Fuck a metro in a pink shirt cos we're kicking the set

The Funkoars and the Hilltop, yes, we still rocking it
And I ain't going near your bill unless we fuckin' toppin' it
I drink till I'm all over the shop like barcodes
And as far as rap goes, I've mastered my flows
Certified and we back again to wreak havoc
With these pads and pens so understand my friend
We about to take over just like Hov spit it
To the most gifted, get them glasses up and toast with us

Pressure MC, born with a mechanical mind
The talent of rhyme, instinctual like animal kind
Now I flow with the best, from East Coast to the West
We live in the flesh like my raps sewn in your chest
You can't fathom the dopest flow, amateurs don't you know
What ever happened to a good old fashioned broken nose?
Don't become a casualty of my faculty
Damn I got spine but you'll never see the back of me

And we what? - Run with crew
Whose what? - Blood is blue
Through life's - Fucking zoo
And we might - Come for you
And we what? - Run with crew
Whose what? - Blood is blue
Through life's - Fucking zoo
And we might - Come for you",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-the-blue-blooded-lyrics

The Hard Road,The Hard Road,2006,"Just don't know
Well, I'm going down
Going down the hard road
Just don't know
Don't know where I've been
Well, I'm going down
Going down the hard road
Just don't know
Don't know where I've been

Growing up, I needed a guide like a blind veteran's dog
'Cause I was going nowhere like a child's letters to God
Though life's road was hard, I was never so lost
That I looked for an answer in a medicine box
I never did pop pills or cop deals, just rocked hills
Kids with skills, still got harassed by cops 'til
They'd have me in the back of a paddy,
 down to lock up
Smack me, pat me down for a baggy,
 mums would rock up
And bail me out, a failure out once again
Next weekend, bail me out, drunk again
And I never will forgive myself
For putting you through all that hell
I went from high school dropout to factory labourer
Slave to the clock until four, went from sleeping on the floor
To being out on tour, now, no stopping me
I'll finish with a bang like Kurt Cobain's biography, uh

Going down the hard road
Down the hard road
Don't know where I've been
And don't know where to go, it's like
Going down the hard road
Down the hard road
Don't know where I've been

I spent my youth like life was cheap
The only change that I wanted was enough to buy a drink
Was on a path to nowhere, the harder the road
The more broken baggage we carry, the larger the load
This school dropout got knocked out, chased by the cops out
Got clout, dumped by my girlfriend and locked out
Been broke and beaten, even choked at being
A dope MC but never lost hope in dreaming
We used to thrash boosted cars 'til the engine'd fail
If I never had bailed, maybe I'd be dead or in jail
And man, I got no one else to blame
I thank my family and music for keeping me sane
But that's the breaks, right? Started working late nights
Never seeing daylight, getting paid like a slave might
And I've done too many years to miss this for my missus
To have to tell my son he nearly never existed, uh
[Hook 2: Leon Russell (Sampled), 
Pressure & Suffa

Going down the hard road
Down the hard road
Don't know where I've been
And don't know where to go, it's like
Going down the hard road
Down the hard road
Don't know where I've been
DJ Debris, come on and break it down like

Shoes get scuffed cause the road gets rough
Shoes, shoes
Shoes get scuffed cause the road, road
Get, get, gets, gets

And I speak what I feel in the booth in the spirit of truth
'Cause all these kids that I meet, man, they mirror my youth
And I could have gone the wrong way, the easy option
But I chose to go the long way, the streets is watching, so
So keep a look out, look up, B-Ballers keep your hook up
Tear a page from my book out, and pull out
Your finger, put your foot out and keep a lookout
For what we put out, the brand new flavour for your cookout

Going down the hard road
Down the hard road
Don't know where I've been
And don't know where to go, it's like

But I think I've been walking
I'm walking round in circles
Can't even find a friend
Woah, my love
Woah, my love
Oh, my love
Woah, my love
Oh, my love
Down the hard road

What a Great Night,The Hard Road,2006,"This is for the hopeless, the homeless, the brokest, the dopest
The smokers, the jokers on opiates and coke, it's
Your choice, I won't judge you tonight
'Cause I'm paralytic, I ain't looking to lose a fight, so
Put your hands up if you're not to drunk to stand up
If you bombing up the toilets put your man up
And put your can up, spray it in the air, mate
Check out my man, fuck, it's all going pear shaped
They call me Suff', when I'm drunk they call me ""fuck off""
Head under the bar trying to drink the run off
I'm a one of a kind; I'll rhyme
Till I'm cut off or just too fucking blind to get one off
Don't call me son of a bitch; I'm the son of an angel
When the sun of the morning hits it's so painful
These all nighters are killing me
But it's all right, are you feeling me?

And it's all love, and it's all right
Till we're all drunk, then it's all fights
Then it's all over, go home, go to sleep
Wake up, get sober, what a great night
And it's all love, and it's all right
Till we're all drunk, then it's all fights
Then it's all over, go home, go to sleep
Wake up, get sober, what a great night

This is for the gamblers, the ramblers
The grandmas and grandpas
The fans of the samplers, my godson in pampers
Champ let’s all amp this out like Peavey
Like De La said it’s so easy, it’s so easy
To pack this, chain smoking in the back
Like I had three cigarettes and one match it’s
The one who sucks tequila from a cactus
You couldn’t hack this with axes, to all the detractors
Go listen to Axis if you want proof
That Obese ain’t actors, we produce
The rawest performance from verse to the chorus
Hung like a walrus, run like a tortoise
Obese, enormous, flawless on the cordless
I own this mic like my name was Shure it’s
For the poorest or richest, slowest or quickest
Flow with a sickness, bro you know what this is?

And it's all love, and it's all right
Till we're all drunk, then it's all fights
Then it's all over, go home, go to sleep
Wake up, get sober, what a great night
And it's all love, and it's all right
Till we're all drunk, then it's all fights
Then it's all over, go home, go to sleep
Wake up, get sober, what a great night

Gin and tonic, you rock the house, and a
Tequila shots, you rock the house, and a
Chivas Regal, you rock the house, and a
Jägerbombs, you rock the house, and a
(the Hilltop rock the house)
(the Hilltop rock the house)
(the Hilltop rock the house) Check it out
It's like this, It's like this (the hilltop rock the house)

And it's all love, and it's all right
Till we're all drunk, then it's all fights
Then it's all over, go home, go to sleep
Wake up, get sober, what a great night
And it's all love, and it's all right
Till we're all drunk, then it's all fights

Ya Feel Big?,The Hard Road,2006,"Check
I love hip-hop (
Hip-hop
), but fuck me
Sometimes it feel like hip-hop don't love me
And I've learnt this from every single person that burnt us
Since we dropped 
The Calling
 it's been like a fuckin' circus
Now how's feelin' worthless 'bout how many you sold
And how's feelin' nervous 'cause your record went gold?
'Cause if you move too many units you fuck the underground off
They see it's all poppy and they try to cut it down, what?
Fuck me now, man, could this be really happening?
They're actually pressurin' and questionin' my rappin'
Never compromise a rhyme for a crumb or a crust
'Cause Pressure always said, ""Let them come to us""
I never dropped the ball for two-hundred grand
I'd rather be fuckin' poor and have two-hundred fans
And if you understand I couldn't be more grateful
'Cause every day this culture, it gets more hateful, singing

And the fire that you're burning's the same one you lit
The lyric that comes back on you's the same one you bit
The grave that you're buried in's the same one you dig

And the fire that you're burning's the same one you lit
The lyric that comes back on you's the same one you bit

Dear listener, this ain't a resignation, this is a
Thanks for your time, I had you in mind in lyrics for
Everything I ever wrote, every quote
Every cent that I spent on studio time when I was broke
A leisurely road's an option that I never went
For sake of sentiment (Fuck it), every word I said I meant
I ploughed full ahead, brow full of sweat
Tellin' me to keep it real, fifteen years is how real it get
Some acting ill, they never had a deal
Don't know the difference between a mass of skill and mass appeal
Let me know if I've done something to desert you
You never know how much you love somethin' till it hurts you
And I ain't gonna work till I die in a shirt and a tie
Starvin' on a super for my service for life
I take flight from my cares all night long
'Cause I don't wanna wake in the morning and wonder where my life's gone

And the fire that you're burning's the same one you lit
The lyric that comes back on you's the same one you bit
The grave that you're buried in's the same one you dig
Ya feel big? (Ya feel big?) Ya feel big? (Ya feel big?)
And the fire that you're burning's the same one you lit
The lyric that comes back on you's the same one you bit
The grave that you're buried in's the same one you dig

Roll On Up,The Hard Road: Restrung,2007,"[Sample from David Essex - Stardust]
""Well he used to high fly but he crashed out the sky
In a stardust fling, hey rock 'n roll king is down""

Roll on up
As we proceed, to give you what you need
Roll on up
As we proceed, we hit the freeway and roll
(on up)

[Verse 1 - Suffa]
Shows and flows till the rhyme was felt,
Coast to coast and cut through the Bible belt,
A tribal yell till the vibe was felt,
Surviving hell and back man, on every track, man saliva spelt,
Hilltop, Hilltop, we hustled independent,
Obese, it's Obese, the muscle and the emblem,
We paved roads with our soul and suffering,
For the stage coach carrying hip hop to roll on up in,
There's something that's making them nervous
The undergrounds taking these verses and breaking the surface,
With a brand new cockiness, a brand new confidence,
Treat em like they owe me man; pay me my compliments,
No obstacles the fans and the fam make it possible,
And Obese got a roster full of rocket fuel,
So keep an eye out for those out ripping it up,
Putting it down, cos the fans are now picking it up.

[Chorus]
Roll on up, hip hop's no longer living,
In rocks shadow, the kids are now spitting not singing,
Roll on up, and come and see emcees free
Their sounds, to the sound of an MPC it goes,
Roll on up, hip hop's no longer living,
In rocks shadow, the kids are now spinning not singing,
Roll on up, and see the DJs getting the love,
From every head that step in the club, we hit the freeway and roll… (on up)

[Verse 2 - Pressure]
With this everyday hustle,
Ain't nothing over night man, it takes struggle to make muscle,
And half of these kids are under the poverty line,
The other half confuse skills with gonna be signed,
But this world doesn't owe you a debt,
So don't you expect a hand out or me to show you respect,
I got no regrets, why? Cos really its proof,
That makes a good lie better than the hideous truth,
I don't preach or scream ain't trying to teach the scene,
The only guidelines are those you need to read between,
And the eighties is gone its a crazy biz,
Nowadays hip hops whatever the fuck I say it is,
The reason I'm down, and kept my feet on the ground,
So I could breathe life back into the street with my sound,
So from the rappers to the vinyl stores, risking their spinal cord,
To define a cause we about to reach our final straw.

[Chorus]
Roll on up, hip hop's no longer living,
In rocks shadow, the kids are now spitting not singing,
Roll on up, and come and see emcees free
Their sounds, to the sound of an MPC it goes,
Roll on up, hip hop's no longer living,
In rocks shadow, the kids are now spinning not singing,
Roll on up, and see the DJs getting the love,
From every head that step in the club, we hit the freeway and roll…

[Verse 3 – Suffa & Pressure]
We roll on ripping it,
Cos some of these execs are just soulless lepers,
They'll buy you lunch cos they stole your breakfast,
Now who I'm going to let control these records?
And who's going to hold these weapons,
Roll independent, we owe nothing to no one.
Got love for Elefant Tracks, Love for the Shogun,
Love for Hydrofunk, and the homespun,
Cause we a dying breed and this loathsome,
Industries about the mint, not the plant that dresses lunches,
Nah man it's the plant that presses hundreds,
We run with each and every rhymer since,
Cause we never been so large that I couldn't read the finer print.

[Chorus]
Roll on up, hip hop's no longer living,
In rocks shadow, the kids are now spitting not singing,
Roll on up, and come and see emcees free
Their sounds, to the sound of an MPC it goes,
Roll on up, hip hop's no longer living,
In rocks shadow, the kids are now spinning not singing,
Roll on up, and see the DJs getting the love,
From every head that step in the club, we hit the freeway and roll on up.",http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/hilltophoods/rollonup.html
Brainbox,Walking Under Stars,2014,"A gentleman caller
, come to settle the bill
A veteran, stepping in with a set off incredible skills
Revitalised, heads are moving back, forth, side to side
Like bobble-head Jesus on the dashboard,
 I’m rhyming like
There’s dynamite inside the mic, 
kill the chat
I’m riding like a Silverback on a tiny bike
; 
all right, I’m like
Awkward, dangerous
, 
don't talk to strangers
Don’t court the brainless, don’t war with neighbours
We decent humans, no fucking about
You try speak the truth and throw up in your mouth
Lies are poison,
 and these cats are carriers, ad men
But I’m like Harry Allen; I’m a media assassin
I ain’t been infected by a carrier yet
Suffa’s not a puppet, fuck a marionette
Yep, so I’mma play the back of this mess
Till they start paying these rappers with reality cheques, check

""Life is a battle and strength is survival""
""Got it together so clever no one could sever""
""I'ma let you know"" """"
""Some search for better but most won't even try to""

If they’re lost sounding like they’re brain washed
Seeking to relieve the grind
Think what’s locked up inside of that brain box
And we can leave it all behind
Roll with me now, all with me now
We’ll ride out on this cloud
Roll with me now, hold with me now
All with me 'cause the tide is rolling out

Another chapter from the twisted corrupt, a sinners soul in it
A pacifist but if it erupts, we in controllership
See rappers in particular attack but when I visit ya
Be acting like my dick is the grudge, been holding it
Mate it’s all been heard before, came in on your learners thought
Blazing was your way in now your sailing in a perfect storm
If albums turning gold was a murder toll
Beer, rappers and revenge, three things I’m serving cold
It’s hard to pick the reason that they’re starting shit with me when
It’s a path of risk, the partnerships like marching with a legion
The route untraveled is packed with a brutal battle and passengers
Who been gaffled with super natural vernacular
Stress is killing me, a head of red capillaries
Yet the name holds weight better than express delivery
The miracle three, but me inducted a Saint?
Hate me for what I am, don’t love for something I ain’t

""Got it together so clever no one could sever""

Roll with me now, hold with me now
All with me 'cause the tide is rolling out

Who am I to be brilliant? Who am I to be murderous?
Speak for the reptilian, sort of like Steve Irwin was
Never determined by the hand like Kermit the Frog
Got hits controlling the jukebox like I’m the Fonz
I’m the bomb with it, I have the common sense
To not compete with the sheep and go beyond the fence
I need no strong defence when you bring your own league
Got the best of them out of their seat like I was Phil Jackson
While all you actors sit on the side-lines
Watching me move my magic
, 
whole team is massive
Go go go gadget legs
, 
went from the baddest egg
To making bread I am the alchemist, yep yep
Yo, I am not like them, I use the 
Tao Te Ching
A little Zen and the power within, yep yep
Moving mountains with the power of thanks
This is how with every album we’re allowed to win
So now you know

Cosby Sweater,Walking Under Stars,2014,"Watch me do my thing, get
Lost into my scene, yeah
Hot like New Orleans in
Cosby crew and jeans, yeah

They’re not awakened, stare a lot and vacant
Living in conditions of the modern matrix
Only bare arms when I’m proper naked
Only point I made with a bullet was on paper
Ain’t here to fight some dude or fuck around with his spouse
Rather light your mood and burn it down with the house
Get you hyped from the groove on account of the bounce
And looking like Tom Cruise, up and down on a couch
Status never mattered ever, act however
Like Christine Aguilera, just let yourself go
Mad at Pressure, an endeavour that is better left
Pristine track and record to let you all know
That we would be kings even homeless
Building these kingdoms our own, just
Slap a rapper like Solange Knowles
Till they’re gathering, they no longer matter like a black hole

And it's all good
And it's all good
And it's all good
And it's all good

Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater

I'ma step up every chance when I rumble
They all call me champ of the jungle, it’s fitting
I'ma get drunk and dance like your uncle
'Til I'm all hands like your uncle, I’m kidding
The venomous inventor, when I enter then it's over
When I’m spitting venom I’m as generous as Oprah
You get a scar, you get a scar, you get a scar
Me? Drunk in the back of a rental car
Pat Benatar, brah, love’s a battlefield
Here to get you out your seat like a battle drill
I’m in the saddle still, a little saddle sore
Smash you out the stratosphere,
 
flashy as a matador
When I’m dressed like Theo’s dad
In a Coogi listening to Kool G Rap
I won’t beat around the bush like a seventies porn
I’ll make you wish that you’d never been born and it’s all good

And it's all good
And it's all good
And it's all good
And it's all good

Take a ride on the wild side of this alley
We can fire up the night like Prince Harry
Fuck the high life, we can vibe like
We got white lines hanging from behind like we’re just married
I’ll turn the art form into a blood sport
And make pea soup out of a pea-brain
They wanna run these streets like parkour?

Two sheets to the wind in a taxi
Two feet to the wind in the backseat (Two feet)
Two beeps to the car in front of us
Or one of us ending up wrapped round the chassis

Thinking ‘bout these rhymes, and what they gave me
Sounds out this world, but a microphone and (Microphone)
Two turntables saved me
Took me round the world and bought me a home

I’ve seen all these other crew's bank too (I see you)

Matter fact, I ain’t leaving (No)
I was here first and I don’t believe 'em (No)

And missing out on being there for people in person (I'm sorry)

We don’t bleed when we’re hurting ()
We wear our heart on our sleeve and I’m certain (Come on)
That we’ll feel the burden till we call it curtains, 
you feel me?
Do you feel me?
This that
Light inside the core that can blind with its force
It’s the writing on the wall;
 light it up on the porch
It’s 1994, five mic’s in The Source
It’s a mighty; mighty roar from the crowd and of course, it’s
This
Do you feel me?

Went from going through quotes in the liners
To being known from the shows on the fliers
Playing packed rooms, heading to the back room
To cool down my face with some ice from the rider
Looking out to a crowd full of lighters
And the day those lights don’t inspire us
You’ll see me walking out
I’m a ghost, I’m gone

Two sheets on a surface of water
Loose-leaf writing worthless and torn up
If I could do these words justice
You’d see how much it’s worth that 
I fought for
Every kid that never got one mention
Every little bit of love or affection
I’m done with pretending the sun is descending
And all good things must come to an ending
'Cause I swore to the day this is
Nothing more than a flawed entertainment biz
And if I walk away with nothing well let me tell you something
That’s fucking more than I came here with
Feel me? (I'm gone)
Do you feel me? (I'm gone)
And I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t grateful
For my life for my friends and for the faithful
It’s been a ride but there’s been a few times
That I’d thought I’d lose sight when the effort was so painful
But rap gave me such inspired dreams
In fact maybe touched my life when things
Got a little crazy and nobody would pay me
The ends that plainly justified the means
At last I can see we’ve all been blind
It’s hard to believe that all this time
That I wore my heart on my sleeve for this art and the scene
Gonna be hard when I leave that all behind
You feel me?
Do you feel me?

Live And Let Go,Walking Under Stars,2014,"[Hook - Maverick Sabre:]
All these days I've been broken and hopeless and I
And I don't feel like I'm coping, I'm hoping that I
That I can live and let go, so I can get through it
Yeah I can live and let go, so I can get through this

[Verse 1 - Suffa:]
You know that pain can hang in the air like cigarette smoke right? 
Sometimes trying to live and let go
Is like trying to talk with a mouth full of cinnamon though
I'm trying to crawl out the skin I'm in so
I can see through the eyes of a loved one, eyes of an enemy
Rising above sometimes takes a pedigree
That I fear that I don't possess
And turns hope into hopelessness, but I won't regress
Won't let life wear me down
Staring down as the travellers all rush past
Some part their weary brow
And wear a frown like a handlebar moustache
So I live by forgive and forget
Rather that than to live with regret, it's like living with debt
It's a weight that'll curve your spine
Living with hurt's like serving time

[Chorus - Maverick Sabre:]
All these days I've been broken and hopeless and I
And I don't feel like I'm coping, I'm hoping that I
That I can live and let go, so I can get through it
Yeah I can live and let go, so I can get through this

[Verse 2 - Brother Ali:]
I pay homage to obstacles
The thin line between honor and horrible
The healing heart knows the eyes must overflow
Tears clear the windows that guard the soul
Now the let the water flow, you can scrub the mud out of your land
The blood out of your hands
But you've still got to cleanse the heart that's trying to beat inside
And it's only purified by the tears you cry
You can fight all the devils and slay them
But if you're made hard at the days end then they win
There's only one force that can solve all this
I want the warm heart that we all start with
Sometimes we march out ball our fist
I will give it all up but my softness
You will never invade my holy place
I let the tears dry on my face

[Chorus - Maverick Sabre:]
All these days I've been broken and hopeless and I
And I don't feel like I'm coping, I'm hoping that I
That I can live and let go, so I can get through it
Yeah I can live and let go, so I can get through this

[Verse 3 - Pressure:]
If these walls could talk they'd sing a sombre song
And if we're stronger from this road that goes on and on
We wear scarring like armour made of problems from
Void of feeling, time's ticking sitting on a bomb
So disengaged hope in us fades
Reaching out but the dark take our focus away
This roads paved by the brave without knowing the way
Don't stray bro they didn't build Rome in a day
And I don't need to satisfy a ceaseless appetite
Just to feel at peace or gratified
If we don't reach for the stars only reach for satellite
We'll live in faded colour and dream in black and white
I know our demons walk among us
But struggles something that we do not something to becomes us
So let go of the of all the suffering and hurt
Yo unless we ball it up and we burst

[Bridge - Maverick Sabre:]
So I can get through this, so I can get through this
So I can get through this, so I can get through this

[Chorus - Maverick Sabre:]
Yeah all these days I've been broken and hopeless and I
And I don't feel like I'm coping, and I'm hoping that I
That I can live and let go, so I can get through it
So I can live and let go, so I can get through this
So I can get through this, so I can get through this
So I can get through this, so I can get through this
So I can live and let go, so I can get through this 
So I can live and let go, so I can get through this",http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/hilltophoods/liveandletgo.html
Pyramid Building,Walking Under Stars,2014,"So they say, a man can be wealthy
With no money in the bank if he’s lucky he can thank his family’s healthy
And a man can be empty, in a mansion with plenty
Of rooms, none of which he could fill with happier memories
And if just the two of us had shelter, food and love
I’d leave our debts, free of stress, content that you enough
Obsession and possession’s we’re destined to erupt
I can’t spend them where we’re heading through death and to the dust
Even so we keep it moving working through till we’re old
Truly evolved to consumers in pursuit of our goals
On a quest for improvement but we losing control
Digging for gold, hit bottom, test human resolve
We got credit, lenders, debit, vendors, savings and cheques
But only thing we spend is a life escaping the debt
You bet I’d trade it for complacence and a place I can rest (
Hey, hey
)
And that’s enough if I’m paid in respect

The more I want then the less I’m free
So when I see everything I got
That’s enough for me, that’s enough for me
That’s enough for me, it’s all I need
The more I want then the less I’m free
So when I see everything I got
That’s enough for me, that’s enough for me
That’s enough for me, it’s all I need

You could write a cheque for a private jet
And you could fly with your private chef
But excess don’t equal success, and ain’t nothing that I respect
A billionaire could die a violent death for all I care
They’re pyramid building
, 
while little kids
Children, are literally chilling
, and I ain’t against the
White picket fence
 but, why must we let the wiry spectre of greed
In our lives and start vying for cheddar? 
Lying to debtors
Grinding but dying, and tiring of lectures
Trying to better our lives we endeavour
A sheep in the wild with the lions and leopards
And finding a shepherd
 
to guide through the weather
And bind us together’s
 
like trying to get to
A light in the sky, but we’re flying forever
And never getting anywhere I sigh like whatever

The more I want then the less I’m free
So when I see everything I got
That’s enough for me, that’s enough for me
That’s enough for me, it’s all I need
The more I want then the less I’m free
So when I see everything I got
That’s enough for me, that’s enough for me
That’s enough for me, it’s all I need

Freedom

The more I want then the less I’m free
So when I see everything I got
That’s enough for me, that’s enough for me
That’s enough for me, it’s all I need
The more I want then the less I’m free
So when I see everything I got

Dance ‘round the ring, and run rings ‘round these other guys
When it’s crunch time, I won’t be undermined
But won’t throw a punch, I’m talking ‘bout fucking rhyme
High jab with another line
Mouth guard in but I still got my tongue in my cheek
My speech so unrefined, make my own mother cry
He ain’t no son of mine
Ain’t no alumni, and you can tell by the way I say alumni

Then rumble, young man, rumble
Young man, rumble

Rumble

They sing out the masses, each round of clashes
Every swing, downed and damaged brings out the savage
The ring sounds, I’m cling bound and bandaged
Which brings round only those things mouthed in madness
They got me on the ropes it’s gone beyond a joke
Corner a lion, no law of confinement will stop me from your throat
Provoking the beast my blood boils
The notion of peace in such toil’s the face hopeless defeat
Shrug of a glance, switch stance, throw one and advance
Succumb to the dance, romance the blood on our hands
Rappers try to a throw a blow these hacks ain’t fighting toe to toe
It ain’t for lack of trying, it’s just that the die and won’t let go
It takes a particular touch, the way to deliver a punch
If the game isn’t vicious enough then we play to the haters ain't giving it up
Let them come, let them fall down now, said it once, said it all round town
I get it done, Della gonna get 'em hung, when I come, better run, better haul out south

I’ve never been scared of life
Won’t watch it pass me by from my bed

The Art Of The Handshake,Walking Under Stars,2014,"Golden Era Records in conjunction with Hilltop Hoods proudly presents ‘The Art of the Handshake’

I used to wake up, bathroom, face-wash, cartoons
Ma Dukes, far too smart to start to
Talk to this awful swine with a score to
Settle with the world, whose only crime is that it bores you
Walked to the train it was covered from the floor to
Ceiling in graff and stickers, up back no ticket
Can’t afford to, life off the payroll
Lye rolled up made my eyes and my brain roll
Headphones wrapped like a vine ‘round my Kangol
Walked like a Bengal Tiger, and the train rolled
And the train rolled, and the train rolled
And the train rolled on
Then I was stopped by these two cops who got mad rude
I’m like ‘What? There’s not a whole lot that you can do’
Then ""whop-bop-a-lu-a-whop-bam-boo""
Next stop, what have you got? The whole damn crew
So I grabbed ‘em by the wrist, then switched to a grip thumbs
Flipped then we clicked then we finished with a fist bump
This chump, tried to get cute with me and diss us
About the handshake, I said man wait

There used to be a time like way before this song
When all the handshakes were like twenty seconds long
And they just went, and they just went
And they just went, and they just went on
There used to be a time like way before this song
When all the handshakes were like twenty seconds long
And they just went, and they just went
And they just went, and they just went on

The handshake is thought to have developed as a gesture to demonstrate that neither party at an encounter is carrying a weapon or poses a threat. Over hundreds of years this simple act has developed into a sometimes-complex ritual and a way to convey status, mutual affiliations or just plain respect

I used to wake on a Saturday, play in the matinee
Game, get faded on the train down to Adelaide
Headphones playing looking out at fresh painted walls
Rakim saying we about to get paid in full
My man entered, cap and black sweater
Jacks get all up on a fella that act clever
Train tracks were graffed with back-to-back letters
But we came to rap and that was back when a
DJ would supply the wax stage had a lino mat
Place full of writers in a Raiders or a Giants cap
Casing with minors, crates are piled by the back
We’ll break in in time to hit the stage and freestyle attack
Walk in like I’m possessed by the beat mix
Clean kicks, full of more hot air than a phoenix
Move right away to my crew side of stage
Nothing new but this groove how we do night and day
Bring it back; no high five shit is wack
We’re bringing that old side-to-side, finger snap
Fist poke, stop and lock, just don’t stop the rock
Look away handshake body pop

There used to be a time like way before this song
When all the handshakes were like twenty seconds long
And it just went, and it just went
And it just went, and it just went on
There used to be a time like way before this song
When all the handshakes were like twenty seconds long
And it just went, and it just went
And it just went, and it just went on

Not all cultures consider a firm handshake as a sign of respect; in fact a grip that’s too tight can often be considered as offensive
Scientists at the University of Manchester, taking into account twelve different variables, developed a mathematical formula for the handshake to which people would be the most receptive

There used to be a time like way before this song
When the DJ cut the record right
Cut the record right, cut the record right
Cut the record right, cut the record right
There used to be a time like way before this song
When the DJ cut the record right
Cut the record right, cut the record right
Cut the record right, cut the record right

The Thirst Pt. 4,Walking Under Stars,2014,"They were recording enough music for 2 albums, that was premeditated. They weren't just like 'lets make a record and we'll pick the best 10 or 12 songs', it was from day one 'we're making 2 albums'

We’re still here, ain’t leaving, built here, ain't leaving
Marched till the sun was down, and felt this landscape breathing
A blurred line came between them
Yo I don’t know if I’m chasing dreams or escaping demons
Though it's a sign when you're loaded on the road all the time
Woke up to find I was at home, and didn't know it was mine
Sobered up fine, took it slower, know what's blowing my mind
Had a baby boy to focus my devotion and time
Now my hands tied, man this life don't get easier
My Nan died, older son got Leukaemia
World spinning like poltergeist, try take my own advice
And transfer this anguish to my only vice
Took a breather when I knew it was a problem
To take a look and see if something beautiful could blossom
And find some time to release this record
But sometimes sunshine’s when you least expect it
That love you got for me, for real I’m humbled honestly
It still make me feel like I hit the fucking lottery
We steel up a fist, to fill the abyss
My friends it gets no realer than this
We just continue on
Two years, one album nothing left, just writing these songs
Continue on
No apologies, my whole discography been righting my wrongs

We arrive in the night
We come alive in the night
Strip the sky of its colour
We’ll run the expanse in the absence of light
Walking under stars we breathe the night
Walking under stars we breathe the night
Walking under stars we breathe the night
Walking under stars we breathe the night
Walking under stars we breathe the night
Walking under stars we breathe the night",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-the-thirst-pt-4-lyrics
The Thirst Pt. 5,Walking Under Stars,2014,"We stayed away much longer than explained that we would to be honest
There was a spate of delays for the Hoods I guess a promise
Is made to be made, not made to be kept
The way you’d wait all these days hey I’m blessed and I’m honoured
And I guess that I wanted things a little too quickly
‘Cause the last two years felt a little like fifty
In the middle I sit the centre of the three
'Cause pressure causes suffering resulting in Debris
Hilltop, we’re back from a sabbatical, you miss us?
My briefcase is a suitcase, travel’s my business
Said we’d be back last year, but life got in the way of that
But that's life, we play it out, somehow get old then play it back
We made it out, then we made it back, we take them out, 
we’re still on the road like
Kerouac,
 
have them having them panic attacks, while I’m having a nap
Look the one thing that I know about losing
That’s that I don’t know one thing about losing man we’re back

We arrive in the night
We come alive in the night (come alive in the night)
Strip the sky of its colour
We’ll run the expanse in the absence of light
Walking under stars, we breathe the night (breathe the night)
Walking under stars, we reunite (reunite)
We come alive in the night",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-the-thirst-pt-5-lyrics
Through the Dark,Walking Under Stars,2014,"The very day you were born, your light shone bold in the dark
The doctor said you had a hole in your heart
Just knew you were making room for a whole lot of heart
And loved you from that day until your soul would depart
You took your first breath upon my chest
I built you a good nest before I left
It wasn't that I never loved your mother
But two happy homes are better than one that suffered
Every regret in this life that I made
Have been tempered by the strength in your eyes everyday
I know you never said that you’d like me to stay
Still I'm sorry I neglected you while I was away
You were eight when we headed to casualty
And no child should face their death or mortality
You taught me patience, strength and morality
And I'd burden this weight instead of you happily
That night, you asked if you'd die from your sickness
And why had it chosen your life out of millions
You filled me with a pride I was missing
Cause grown men cry they lack your type of resilience
Only when it’s dark are the stars so bright
For your fight you’re gonna harbour these scars for life
But you a brave little soul, came in the cold
Like a fighter hope you find that same flame when you’re old

Fall asleep
And lay with me
We’ll search the night for shooting stars
If they can’t take
Away your pain
I’ll take your hand, walk through the dark
The dark
Through the dark

I wrote this while you slept in a hospital bed
Know this, your breath at the cost of my breath
I'd forego this life, let you honour my death
If you could know what it’s like to live long and regret
So you can fight, you can shove, you can bleed and hurt
You can cry, you can love, learn your creed or worth
Earn your stripes, act dumb, cut your teeth or worse
Or take a wife to become your sky, sea and earth
But if these are things that you never see
With no god, just me, here to set you free
And most others won’t understand the hell in which you’ve been in
Till they’ve wrestled with a demon
But take heart, to be brave we first need fear
That same heart that’s seen pain yet persevered
Will serve you, I know this world is, of course, unfair
And hurt you, but these virtues are yours to bear
I named you lionhearted the day you’re born
They say the night is darkest before the dawn
I'll take your hand upon this path, if you can light a spark
Then we can find some calm in a raging storm
Ain’t nothing left to scare you, see?
So we can live, laugh and cherish every breath we breathe
And no matter where you go know I’ll never leave
'Cause even when we’re gone we’re living in a memory, so live on

Fall asleep
And lay with me
We’ll search the night for shooting stars
If they can’t take
Away your pain
I’ll take your hand, walk through the dark
Fall asleep
And lay with me
We’ll search the night for shooting stars
If they can’t take
Away your pain
I’ll take your hand, walk through the dark
The dark
Through the dark

And I'm sorry that I can't take your pain, or answer why
We’ll lay awake through darker skies
I say your name, you cast a light
You’re a flame on a starless night
And I didn’t know I was lost till you found me
Didn’t know I was locked here without keys
But we can walk across all these boundaries
You and me, nothing here to stop you, you're now free
So I wrote this to give you hope
For every good thing in life you'll live to know
They say cancers survivors are gifted though
Let me know if that isn’t so",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-through-the-dark-lyrics
Walking Under Stars,Walking Under Stars,2014,"Till the dawn is slung from the morning sun
I'ma crawl through these streets
I'ma walk under stars, fall in and out of bars
Till I fall to my knees
Till the dawn is slung from the morning sun
I'ma crawl through these streets
I'ma walk under stars, fall in and out of bars
Till I fall to my knees
And we say hey now
Hey, hey, hey now
Hey now
Hey, hey, hey now

Check, I'm either in or out
Ain't got time to sit around, trying to find a middle ground
I gotta live and not exist
Problem is there's not a gift offered if there wasn't risk
I went from poor to invested and stressed on tour
Wrestling the lessons, these questions bore
If I can't feel it right now, what's the effort for?
Don't wanna build a lighthouse on an empty shore
See I can shoot the breeze, but can't do it for free
Cause who are we if I don't make this fucking music for me?
And it ain't about the fame or 'bout recouping a fee
But either way, that's time away from the two kids I feed
Caught in between, any day your fortune can swing
And you don't wanna be a jester in a court full of kings
We set our own pace to the race we're running in
And celebrate what we put out, not what's coming in

Till the dawn is slung from the morning sun
I'ma crawl through these streets
I'ma walk under stars, fall in and out of bars
Till I fall to my knees
Till the dawn is slung from the morning sun
I'ma crawl through these streets
I'ma walk under stars, fall in and out of bars
Till I fall to my knees
And we say hey now
Hey, hey, hey now
Hey now
Hey, hey, hey now

I lay down my bars in the bars where I lay down
Till I’m barred by the barmaid, hey, I stay ‘round
A barfly, barhoppin' bars like a playground
Debris's like a barber, he cuts in the fade out
Hey now
We had plans and breakdowns laid out
But Lennon said it better than Suffa ever can
""Life's what happens when you're busy making other plans""
Pushed back plans like Jesse Pinkman's hairline
The way some reacted, that caught me unprepared, I
Had friends throw darts, fuck crew like that
Man they broke my heart, but through my back
But success is the best revenge so I guess
That I've had a lot of vengeance then, yo, I'm blessed
And apologising for being so fresh
Is like Napoleon writing ""Excuse my French""
And a tiger don't apologise for being tiger
A Kaiser don't apologise to a miser
Man I'ma wear the night sky like a cape
And add a jewel to my crown every time that you hate
So hate on, little man, hate on
'Cause they raze every stage they on
Until they say my name in all capital cities
And they spell my name in all capitals, please rap it all with me, it goes...

Till the dawn is slung from the morning sun
I'ma crawl through these streets
I'ma walk under stars, fall in and out of bars
Till I fall to my knees
Till the dawn is slung from the morning sun
I'ma crawl through these streets
I'ma walk under stars, fall in and out of bars
Till I fall to my knees
And we say hey now
Hey, hey, hey now
Hey now
Hey, hey, hey now",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-walking-under-stars-lyrics
Won't Let You Down,Walking Under Stars,2014,"They say you can't love and be wise, but I can pretend wit'chu
If suddenly I ever had to surrender you, I’d
Fall in a heap; I’d fall on the floor, and
Crawl on all fours, for you I’d fall on my sword
If grief ever darkened my door you’d light it up
The way you brighten up a room hits me right in the
Chest, it puts the breath inside of my
Lungs, it’s like I leapt in the light of the
Sun, and in spite of my weary frown
You wear a smile that wears me down, so hear me out
I know that I wasted time
When I should have been replacing your last name with mine
And that mistake is mine believe me
I wear it like its sunburn, it might disappear but it won’t leave me
I’ll carry you on my shoulders, never set you down
Ferry you through the coldness, never let you down

I won’t let you down
Won’t let you down again
I won’t let you down
Won’t let you down again
Said I won’t

Travelling man in the back of a van
Capturing sands like time through the back of my hand
If I could hold it for a moment, do a lap of this land
I’d console you for a moment then be back in a glance
But I’m, so far since we left for the road
To chase the sun around the heavens and globe
Searching for the next episode, 
problem is that letting it go
Would be like letting go of everything I treasure and know
And whenever I go I think your chest will explode
A martyr with your heart like Brandon Lee’s death in The Crow
Try and understand where I lay my head is my home
And I was in love before this rap shit was ever in vogue
But if you feel that you’re ever alone
While standing in the same room as me let’s set it in stone
You can’t save me, a queen to this devilish rogue
But you’re bravely willing to give a hell of go so

I won’t let you down
Won’t let you down again
I won’t let you down
Won’t let you down again
Said I won’t

I hate that I wasted your touch and your taste
It’s my shame and can’t change it, want you to remain
My angel, my heartbeat, come closer, I’m sorry
My soul is yours, surely you know this

And you know that I
Won’t be shy talking ‘bout what you’ve given me
Conflict diamond, you shine through the misery
You walk in a room and light it up, that’s just with your entry
You walk in a room and light it up like it was four twenty
Some people never find out what they have
Only ever find out what they had, and I could’a been
One of them, don’t know if I still won’t
And that thought hangs around my neck like a millstone
For real though, it’s like I lost you, left you, let you go
Before I got to get you or let you know
That you’re my refuge, and I need you to see
The only one that I let down more than you is me

And I won’t let you down
And I won’t let you down
I won’t let you down
Won’t let you down again
I won’t let you down
I won’t let you down again",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-wont-let-you-down-lyrics
Can’t Stop,,2019,"Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End
Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant
White heat is screamin' in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's
All for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's
Time to

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leadin' me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature
I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation
This chapter's gonna be a close one
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one
All on a spaceship, persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
See Suffa flyin' through the treetop
A bird that blows the meaning into bebop

The world I love, the tears I drop

For all my life

I'm Good?,,2020,"I've been better, I'm in bed, and
I'm embedded, man, I have lived better
I've seen better days, man, we all have
2020's nothin' but an unshaved ball-bag
It's not all bad, sorted out my sock drawer
Every single pair of them, folded them up proper
Then I watched some 
Predator
, get 'em to the chopper
Better stay in bed or get arrested by a copper
Put some Netflix on, get a beverage, dog
Be the best you can be
I applied for a rescue dog
But if I get you, dog, you're rescuin' me
Meanwhile I'ma study and get fit
I've never had time for that
But the way I'm comin' out's how I went in
And that is dumb and fat, so let's go

I'm good, I'm good, I'm pretty good
Thanks for askin', that's mighty thoughtful
I'm good, I'm good, but not great
How are you? 'Cause I'm kinda awful
I'm good, I'm good, I'm pretty good
Thanks for askin', that's mighty thoughtful
I'm good, I'm good, but not great
How are you? 'Cause I'm kinda awful

Missin' the drugs, son? Missin' your dealer?
Missin' a loved one? Listen, I feel ya
We're all missin' someone, I'm missin' my mum, I'm
Missin' your mum too (I'm just havin' fun, son), cheah
Waiting on prescriptions of Valium
Waiting on a shipment of Ambien
Waiting on ""My Corona"" from Weird Al
If I'm stuck at home, might as well grow my beard out
Like Abe Lincoln, this so gruellin'
It's funny I can't get out of this funk
Day drinking, homeschoolin'
""Mummy, I think that my math teacher's drunk""
I'm not, but the situation's so sober
I'm so-so, have my ups and downs like a vocoder
Have the COV-odour
And by the time we're over the corona, have a comb over
Was a road-dog, now I'm a homebody
And I've no dog, feel like nobody
So if you know of someone with a rescue
Let me know, 'cause I need a pet just to get through

I'm good, I'm good, I'm pretty good
Thanks for askin', that's mighty thoughtful
I'm good, I'm good, but not great
How are you? 'Cause I'm kinda awful
I'm good, I'm good, I'm pretty good
Thanks for askin', that's mighty thoughtful
I'm good, I'm good, but not great
How are you? 'Cause I'm kinda awful

I pulled up all dressed in
A mask and gloves, but it's not a sex thing
Well, I guess it's a bit of a sex thing?
On Pornhub, 'pandemic' is trending
This really isn't normal, feelin' pretty mortal
Thought all my feelings, problems were awful
Now I nearly chortle, thinkin' about them
Drownin' in worry, I really need a snorkel (Blurp)
I'ma still stay home, though

I'm good, I'm good, I'm pretty good
Thanks for askin', that's mighty thoughtful
I'm good, I'm good, but not great

Check, ayy

Live from the home of the serial killer
I've been writing at home nuh—nearly all winter
But now the sun's up, I'm Sun Tzu, jump through your sunroof
Belly full of fire and a mouth full of fuck you!
I grab my nuts like I'm 2Pac
With his finger up for the cops that were looking for him
You grab your nuts like you're 2Pac
After he got shot in the crotch (Nah, mean?) like you're looking for 'em
A pair in my pants like some cannonballs
Rest 'em every night like some apples in a salad bowl
Have 'em all bouncin' off the walls like playing racquetball
Riding on the back of an elephant like I'm Hannibal
Fuck with me, watch them look up to me
Physically I'm six-two, lyrically I'm 10 foot
Half-court inking man: Phil Jackson
Hardcore hip-hop fan: Bill Paxton
Return of the lyricist: D.O.C
I'm a whirlwind pyramid, P.O.D:
Prince of Darkness, a heartless G.O.D
I spit the hardest, so fuck you, like Cee Lo Green
They can't see this Hood
We been around too long to not be this good
You got 16s and a pristine hook?
I got one-sixtys, I'm feeling like I'm 15 foot
A punk think he got bars that can leave me shook?
I'ma jump in front his car and I'ma beat his hood, pause!
Why the seedy looks?
They wanna throw me on the fire, cover me with soot, 'cause
I'm a heretic, come play
And I never did ever get why apparently some say
'Only God can judge me', are none of them aware
Of the fact God is dead? (There's nothing to be scared of)
And I don't mean to offend
It's an opinion, you and me, man, we don't need to be friends
We don't need to pretend, you really need to be zen
When we're both in a world we know life can easily end
And I'ma burn already, so don't pray for me
If you were already, hey sorry
'Cause if there really is a Hell then you'll see me sitting in my citadel
With my fellow infidels spitting tales until the world
Burns and upper class amass troops
And we have to make our merch out of hazmat suits, I'ma smash mad loops
In a pair of fresh Filas looking like a meth dealer
In a phat tracksuit, this is Mad Max 2
This is Afghan poppy, we give you a
Piece of our minds like a lobotomy
A ragtag group, not making hashtag rap, man we crash that coup
Strong as Afghan hash, and that's fact
Suffa's coming back and bringing what they say the fact is
'Cause they got us fucking captured in some chains, B.A Baracus
I pity the fool
That doesn't know the burb's a classroom, the city a school
This is Forest Whitaker, as Idi Amin
The role of my life, Bruce Lee kicking Kareem
My roll of the dice, Game of Death nothing to prove
It's Kareem in some Lakers sweats dunking on Bruce, uh
Watch on, how the crowd is moving
The cloth I'm, cut from, is the Shroud of Turin
I walk the clouds, I'm touring, I'm the breeze atop whirlpools
Stumble through a field drunk, leave a crop circle
So trust me, when I say it's absurd
'Cause I'm an emcee, I literally give you my word
And my word's true, can't be displaced, man, it's burn proof
Not a leap of faith like suicide from a church roof
Work through my anger like Dick Cheney on a hunt
Then reverse the first letters like Hick Dheney is a…
Never mind, you'll never take this kid like, ever, man
Like, you'd never let your kids ever stay at Neverland
I'm not Mr Everyman, I'm every man but him
And I'm only getting younger like I'm Benjamin Button
Now isn't that something? The loveable type of fool
Like Don Draper banging all the girls in the typing pool
Or maybe I'm dis-likable, singing old folk ballads
Or maybe I'll disgust the world like child star coke habits
World Star dope addicts, corrupt cops with maglites
Rob Ford sucking on a crack pipe like bagpipes
What a beautiful day
To put the bottle to my mouth and wash the music away
'Cause I'm obsessed with the one like I'm stalking an ex-girl
And express what's on my mind, never walking on eggshells
Mi casa is the plaza, gimme a call
I got a job for you, feeling like I'm 50 feet tall
Balls to the wind, fuck the madness and politics
With what I bring I got more gall than Asterix and Obelix
I'm not a rap hobbyist, committed as a communist
Storming the winter palace, sprinting through the corridors
Kicking round the Bourgeois for spitting on the commoners
Or turn entire continents to empires, like Romulus
Stage is centre Florida, God's waiting room
I'm stage diving from the monitors, 'cause gosh, God's waiting too
Don't know what to say to you, don't even know what day it is
I'll bring the world to the brink like a fucking Bay of Pigs
It is what I say it is, no chorus, so you oughta know
Scored so many plaques, they oughta put me on that Hoarder show
Lay off player, and watch the lay-up, bro, you sorta slow
It's the play-offs, you are oh and four and I am four and oh
Is that understood?
You guys are gassed up, you're under Hoods
I'll make your girl superstitious, she'll feel like touching wood
See if she can grip it, cause I feel like I'm a hundred foot
Come to put my middle finger to the world like Sputnik
Aware of the Hood, then you're wearing my footprint
You'll never see the Hood blink
If my eye closed it only means that you been hoodwinked
I need to catch my breath before
I'm the first rapper to rap to death
Bad Boy Bubby, I'll rap these cats to death
Then collapse the set, like factories in Bangladesh
Bang the pads, like Bangladesh, your girl's fresh
Girl's banging, take her home to bang the flesh
I'm Bruce Banner, bang my chest, you wouldn't like me
When I'm angry and you ain't see my anger yet, cheah
Since I been signed, I've been on my grind, picking my mind apart and
Living inside my heart, man, I need breath
Configuring lines and sipping on Wicked 
Considering my position it's like, it's like I been blessed or cursed, I
Sit at a shrine considering life like, 'give me a sign'
Like when will it shine? I'm sick of the fight, I'm sick in the mind, that's to death
I'm living inside, my fit and I'm livid and sipping on wine
Bigger than life, to this and why I'm  that'll be left
Once I'm dead and gone and never to re-spawn then
Bury me with Heavy D blaring through the pouring
Rain while the wind is roaring through the awnings
But until the mourning, every morning
I'll be sipping on my juice at the crack of the dawn then
I'm gonna pace around the church
Looking for that Lucifer, son of the morning
Then I'm gonna chase him outta Earth (I'm not done, Hau)
'Cause I'm here to put my foot down
Feeling like we about a hundred-fifty foot now
We good now, your whole damn crew's blowing me, so go at me
Man, you'll be on the lamb like Rosemary
The more the merrier, I got an extraordinary team
While your team's just extra ordinary, lordy me
Your crew's like the who's who of 'who's that?'
While my crew's like the Juice Crew of new rap
I'm a boom-bap revivalist, few that could rival us
I'm 2Pac in a do-rag, a true rap survivalist
Bottled water, canned food, crawling through the bamboo
On the corner, stand true, want the slaughter? Can do
I feel like the Leshan statue of Buddha
'Cause I'm Godlike, at peace and like a 200 foot or so
If you want to put a hand at me I'll happily
Put a foot up in ya, have you looking like a manatee
I make all these tracks 'cause I'm a family man
See these two cats behind me? They're like family, man
And if you find a crew that's done so well by their peers
Then I'm fucking Dumbo, bro, I'm all ears
Starting to get tired
But I'm like Stringer Bell third season, man, starting to get wired
I'm the golden calf, fuck every spitter on earth
I'll fold the continent in half and make Sydney kiss Perth
Make the earth touch the sun, and turn the sun into cinders
I'll crush the Milky Way between my thumb and my finger
I'm the sum of my choices, a tongue for the voiceless
A solar flare sent from the sun to destroy us
I'm everything and nothing, the Alpha and Omega
With the hubris of Judas, dude I'm heartless as Vader
I'm pesticide in Mountain Dew, Pennywise clowning you
I'm 500 feet fucking tall looking down on you, what?",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-old-school-rap-500-ft-lyrics
Powder the Monkey,,2011,"(First let me introduce myself)
Hello, this is your Disneyland storyteller
And I have a story to tell you
This time it all happened in the jungle

Now this is a story about a monkey named Powder
A happy little monkey his friends used to crowd around the
Base of the tree that he lived in and wait all day
And asked his mumma if its ok it powder came out to play
So they could swing from vine to vine through the jungle
And from time to time one would tumble to the grassy floor (uh)
The powder would be there for them you couldn't ask for more
Cos he was always there for friends
One day in the woods he was just swinging around
Till a python in a tree came slithering down and said
'Powder put out your hand, now I won't bite it'
Take this flyer there's a party on tonight and you're invited
It's at the Lions Den doors open at ten
Can't wait, don't be late cya then bring your friends
(yesss yesss) bring your friends
(yesss yess) bring your friends

It's about a curious place (in the jungle)
And I'm going to tell you the famous story of (in the dark quiet jungle)
(The jungle! Survive alone in the jungle!)
We've got a long journey ahead of us
I wanna stay in the jungle
I'm not afraid I can look after myself...

So they went to the party a crazy jungle disco
Calypso rhythms flamingos doing strip shows
The DJ was an alligator on the fader
At the bar little powder was approached by the waiter
The waiter said Powder the club owner wants to meet ya
And took him to a lion in the corner named Ibiza
Ibiza let out a low growl and called to the waiter
And asked for two cuts of fermented potatoes
He said ""have you ever had something stronger than these?""
Powder said ""well me and my friends used to smoke banana leaves""
""That's kids stuff this stuff will make you feel like your mr. big stuff
Com'on take a sniff of this dust""
Powder tried to disguise the fear in his eyes
Looked at the lion and said ""I guess it couldn't hurt to try""
(I'm not afraid) I guess it couldn't hurt to try
(I'm not afraid) I guess it couldn't hurt to try

It's about a curious place (in the jungle)
And I'm going to tell you the famous story of (in the dark quiet jungle)
(The jungle! Survive alone in the jungle!)
We've got a long journey ahead of us
I wanna stay in the jungle
I'm not afraid I can look after myself...

Now little Powders worlds completely spinning
He's dribbling and grinning making passes at women
And talking 'bout him self cause now he's mr. important
He's friends don't understand cause they didn't snort it
Powder says ""forget you guys man you the past
I'll swap any one of you for just another blast
Or a piece of arse, whose that dime she's looking fine
By the way where's that lion I wouldn't mind another line""
The lion obliged powder felt his nose rip apart
He felt pains in his chest as if his heart was exploding
He stumbled out to the road in a daze
Going red in the face now he's choking
The dope in his system that made him overdose
No longer powder the monkey now he's Powder the ghost
(The ghost ghost) now he's Powder the ghost
(The ghost ghost) now he's Powder the gho-o-ost

It's about a curious place (in the jungle)
And I'm going to tell you the famous story of (in the dark quiet jungle)
(The jungle! Survive alone in the jungle!)
We've got a long journey ahead of us
I wanna stay in the jungle
I'm not afraid I can look after myself...",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-powder-the-monkey-lyrics
Twilight,,2011,"The door breaks, my world wakes, light ascends my windowpane
An hour goes, I'm showered though I'm struck by hunger pain
I break my fast fault, makes the glass translucent through the rain
From my dining room, Tom and Sue got me late again
I snatch my papes, lash for tapes, the sand hills, the plains
Cars biting lines, arrive in time to hear my name
Roll call feeling like my old school again
There's tags on the desk, the day drags on the brain
Time's up! I head for home, the sunrays and then rain
As twilight hits my eyesight I jump the train
The town is for my sound, that's why I came
I step to the jam, a figured silhouette, it blocks the doorframe
I announce my toiling(?) to a bouncer acting lame
Said, ""I came to entertain"", yeah he's asking for my name
Man act like you know it's all the same
With attitude he's grabbing dudes who step through to hear beats playing
I'm in this past, I'm in the grass with some drunk and he's saying
He likes the way I flow and what's the way to go in this game?
I told him ""There's many paths, just use your heart and your brains
Another day's another hangover mate ain't nothing changed""
Then Next is on the decks, time to catch reck, the crowd's swaying
Masses part, a flashing spark sends light from a chain
Flickering a sticker in, a guy's kicking them game

In my B-Boy stance, cause my B-Boy's saying, ""What's up Dan?""

Hand shakes from my mates from Hilltop
Ain't seen em' in a while but I knew they still rock
The freestyler's in a cipher rhyming to a Beatbox
Because we came here just to blow up the spot
Now feeling parched, looking for a laugh, I stray from the flock
I hear a loud and familiar sound of twisting the top
I see my mans at the bar drinking scotch on the rocks
Take a look at my watch, *Man it's almost 12 o'clock*
It's time to rock, the venue's getting full, it's getting hot
It's time to blow up the spot, regardless of props or not
Make my way to the stage, Debris stops me on the spot

Dickhead's is starting beef, Dan they fully lost the plot
Do not if you care or not but some fella got clocked
I knew his face but not his name, he was pissing blood and snot
Matt's out back, practising raps getting hot
But fuck it, let's do this show

Sit Baz, they bother me not

They bother me not, they bother me not, what?
They bother me not, they bother me not, what?
They bother me not, they bother me not, what?
They bother me not, they bother me not, I say...

Because I touch everything in my life
Like the sunrays touch everything in the light
Until the night descends upon the mind's of men
Lose sight in the twilight of life, looking for the limelight
I touch everything in my life
Like the sunrays touch everything in the light
Until the night descends upon the mind's of men
Lose sight in the twilight - is looking for the limelight",https://genius.com/Hilltop-hoods-twilight-lyrics
