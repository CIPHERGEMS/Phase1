Coffin,2013-2015 Songs,2015,"Lil' Chubbs

Yo, this game about to drive my mind cuckoo
I’m not your rival, I'm your fucking style guru
All from a couple shit freestyles up on my YouTube
Shout to ballerinas; like it? I buy two-two
I wouldn't lie to you, I put my hand to God above
I used to be mad he didn't answer us
But then I got more popular
Real as fuck, being honest here
I dreamed of this life on the bus
But last six months I needed drugs
For every time I thought of her
I saw the white van coming for me
But it was just the courier
Dropping off awards I won by accident
I'm like Forrest Gump
A message to my enemies
Thanks for being in my fairy tale
I lay with models like everyday
And treat my laurels like a bed of nails
I used to steal attire as a minor
From Rundle Mall Myer to look flyer
I've lived my life to the fullest and my heart is still ticking
Then I’m going straight to hell
I'm tryna chill with Little Nicky

Angel in my phone, she just said ""Hey""
And I been tryna hit since the tenth grade
Told her, ""I'm for now, not every day""
Because I'll be a problem 'til I’m in my coffin
Angel in my phone, she just said ""Hey""
And I been tryna hit since the tenth grade
Told her, ""I'm for now, not every day""
Because I'll be a problem 'til I’m in my coffin

There's two things I never miss, sessions and women
That's a lie
But lying feels just that much better than wishing
There's two things that I don't mix
Friendship and ambition
I feel like Axl Rose in '87, the present edition
I've got all the girls that heaven is missing
My guardian angels
I got to start going to church
'Cause my life's so good, I got to be thankful
I'm having trouble with falling in love
But fucking, I'll always be able
And I'm such a patriot
Getting more head than a cross into Cahill
I might be the world's most surrounded loner
No wonder that my nose is powder-coated
I know nothing is forever, now's my moment
When you see me, *cough*, now you choking
Yes, I love running this city, I should run for city office
But I'm too busy running the city to run the city
Now that's a tricky problem
And I'm sleeping on their mixtape
Should have called it Egyptian cotton
I get beauty sleep on their catalogues
That's why I’m so pretty looking

Angel in my phone, she just said ""Hey""
And I been tryna hit since the tenth grade
Told her, ""I'm for now, not every day""
Because I'll be a problem 'til I’m in my coffin
Angel in my phone, she just said ""Hey""
And I been tryna hit since the tenth grade
Told her, ""I'm for now, not every day""
Because I'll be a problem 'til I’m in my coffin",https://genius.com/Allday-coffin-lyrics
Harpoon,A Skateboard Soirée - EP,2012,"Uh, thought I wasn’t gonna flex on this EP, huh?
Yeah, Allday, let’s do it

I’m not emotionally retarded, I’m close to being hardened
'Cause I’ve seen a lot of arrows and mostly been the target
If I could take it all back to the moment that I started
Well, I wouldn’t change a thing, man, it’s not only me that suffered
Well, my life’s a rollercoaster, it’s up and down
You guys have balls up in your mouth like a hungry clown
When I was young I couldn’t get a girl to come around
But now they come before I even get my chubby out
Anyway, I guess it’s fair to say they love me now
'Cause everyday I wake up coated in a hundred towels
And everyday I’m taking rappers for their bloody scalps
And punch them in their mouth like Derek in the cubby house
First they diss me, then begin admitting things
I like this indie scene kid in ill-fitting jeans
I scone every jam just so I can swim in cream
I just wanna print my own money like the British queen

Uh, it’s Allday, huh
Always on the grind for the paper
Middle finger to the hater
'Cause I will never break, nah
It’s Allday, huh
Always on the grind for the paper
Middle finger to the hater
'Cause I will never break nah

I met a girl with an upside, but now I’m feeling upset
'Cause I got all in and now I’m wondering what’s up next
It’s all the walls that I erected in my dumb head
Preventing me from humanly connection that I love to get
Mama said, ""I don’t give a fuck"", now your mama's dead
I cut her leg wide open just to see the colour red
Then I let the sucker bleed till there was nothing left
How am I inspired to puncture flesh? Well, drugs, I guess
Dash my family's hope, we don’t have any hose in my garden
I’m retarded from the fucking grams I smoked
Not a barrister, embarrassed getting tacky clothes
There’s no lights in my house, I smoke crack from globes
That’s why you see me on the corner and my hand is closed
I’m gripping Ruby Rose's old pairs of pantyhose
Antisocial taking mushrooms in dark rooms
Humming tunes, killing any intruders with harpoons

Uh, it’s Allday, huh
Always on the grind for the paper
Middle finger to the hater
'Cause I will never break, nah
It’s Allday, huh
Always on the grind for the paper
Middle finger to the hater
'Cause I will never break nah",https://genius.com/Allday-harpoon-lyrics
My World,A Skateboard Soirée - EP,2012,"Welcome to A Skateboard Soirée
Beats by C1, raps by Allday, everyday
Let me introduce myself

I'm twenty-one and stupid
I tell all my poems to everyone through music
I just moved alone to a new city
It's kinda cool but I wish I had my crew with me
Not to mention my dad and my nana Mary
Or my grandfather, who I had to bury
And I'm missing my little brothers too
And my mother too, and my cousins too
And the innocence I had just a year ago
And I'm drinking, but it's not any clearer though
There's many nights here when I feel alone
But even when I go back now I ain't really home
The future side of it is on my mind a bit
Seems like only yesterday I was a tiny kid
And I know it all seems like some minor shit
But my faith in myself is dying quick

So if you come and get me
I'm gonna run away from here
So maybe come and tell me
Baby, you gotta stay right here
In my world, na-na-na-na na-na

Please don't tell me you love me so
'Cause I'll come running right on home
And please don't tell me you love me so
'Cause I'll come running right on home

So if you come and get me
I'm gonna run away from here
So maybe come and tell me
Baby, you gotta stay right here
In my world, na-na-na-na na-na

And I'm insecure, got no inner peace
Got my inner demons all roaming in the streets
And I'm insecure, got no inner peace
Got my inner demons all roaming in the streets
And I'm insecure, got no inner peace
Got my inner demons all roaming in the streets
And I'm insecure, got no inner peace
Got my inner demons all roaming in the streets

So if you come and get me
I'm gonna run away from here
(Runaway, runaway, runaway now
Runaway, runaway, runaway now)
So maybe come and tell me
Baby, you gotta stay right here
In my world, na-na-na-na na-na

""That's funny, that's really funny""
""No, no...""
""Mm-hmm""
""Stop it!""
""Ready? This is from me""
""Nice and drunk!""

Uh, they say you got one, that's cool
Well nowadays everybody's got two
But if you had her, then you get it
Well mine's better than yours, there, I said it
'Cause man, I miss my girl the mostest
Trying to focus on this big world of showbiz
She's back at home studying scholarly
And I'm so proud of her commitment to her law degree
But she should be here courting me
Skype every night, looking at her eyes longingly
There's pain in 'em, that's how I know that
If a guys sweats her, she will tell 'em, ""No, thanks""
And if a girl sweats me, I tell her, ""Nah""
But most of the time I stay home pending bars
Here in this bedroom with my heart black
Just waiting for her plane on the tarmac",https://genius.com/Allday-my-world-lyrics
Not So Bad,A Skateboard Soirée - EP,2012,"I'm not so bad, I'm not so bad, I'm not so bad
Chubby boy, uh

I talk a lot of shit, tell porky pies
If you could crawl inside my mind, you'd be horrified
But let me tell you what it's like
It's mostly dark clouds, it ain't often light
Demons in our minds, we sin
Displeased in a god we don't believe in
And I see things better when I'm drinking
Now I'm sleeping in the day, awaking in the evening
Am I really so wrong, or just young?
A little immature but come on, it's just fun
But am I really so bad, or just dumb?
A little immature and I'm coming undone, like
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da
Uh, so now I'm wondering

Am I really so wrong?
Am I really so bad?
I should have known all along
That I'm not so bad

You don't know what I did just to get here
Every year, thinking about next year
Every day, hoping for a better one
But most of the time they never come
Watch the news and we feel like monsters
So everybody's problem's on my guilty conscience
And if I had a million dollars
I'd throw it in the river, watch it sink to the bottom
And if I had a mansion in the hills
I would throw a big party full of cannabis and pills
'Cause I am not an example for your kids
I live free and I rap the way I live, like
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da
Uh, so now I'm wondering

Am I really so wrong?
Am I really so bad?
I should have known all along
That I'm not so bad

Fake New Era caps, scuffed up Emericas
Our parents blame us for fucking up their marriages
We blame them for never fucking telling us
How two people can make it if you care enough
Family portraits, family court dates
So we all get higher than divorce rates
And all of us are born great
'Til they take away our freedom and we all break
'Til they take away our ambition
I'd rather be a killer than a damn victim
Am I really so wrong, or is it you?
Am I really so bad, or is it you? Like
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da
Uh, so now I'm wondering

Am I really so wrong?
Am I really so bad?
I should have known all along
That I'm not so bad

I'm not so bad, I'm not so bad, I'm not so bad
I'm not so bad, I'm not so bad
I'm not so bad, I'm not so bad, I'm not so bad
I'm not so bad, I'm not so bad

Uh, fuck my enemies, hope you all choke and die
Fuck all bitches, everything you spoke was lies
Fuck the people in high school who called me ugly
I hope you get salmonella from your lunch meat
And I hope you get diabetes
And I hope you get hepatitis A, B, C
Hope you get the whole hepatitis alphabet

Pyramids & Paris,A Skateboard Soirée - EP,2012,"Soon as I get home, I'm gonna call you
Yeah, you'd better call
And tell you how much I love you
You do love me, motherfucker
I feel so good
You do feel good
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love you

I'm faded so much, I'm such a reckless dude
Done so many things I said I would never do
Gone to so many places I should have never been
Puffin' evergreen, shots to everything
These late nights make for the best times
That's why I talk horse like I'm racing 'em equines
Drive around drunk, I'm mistaking the red lights for green
With my sunglasses on, my impaired sight
Now I'm just faded again, fucking brainless again
Fucking chasing the praise of these strangers again
Fucking jaded again, just trying to make it again
'Til everybody love me like I'm Raymond again
And damn, devilish as the earth melts
Tsunamis aren't a worry, I only see 'em as surf swells
That's why they all follow me like the herb smell
Town crying, my dick swinging like church bells

Bottom of the bottle, tip it
Sold my soul, now all I got is spirits
All I get is faded as hell these days
All I get is faded, faded
Bottom of the bottle, tip it
Sold my soul, now all I got is spirits
All I get is faded as hell these days
All I get is faded, faded

Marijuana and vodka, that's my own blend
My mind is broken, man, my mind is broken
And my hem sewn is the size of Stonehenge
Stone grey iris but my spirit is so red
And I should really know better but I don't yet
We're just hairy children, we're never grown men
And now I'm feeling omnipresent in this moment
'Cause now I'm feeling higher than a crows nest
And I'm so heavy already, I'm like space boots
Unwinding, I'm duck diving in Grey Goose
Drunk driving, the sun shining, the day's new
But I'm still hitting this shit hard like I'm Babe Ruth
I need to put my head on straight
I'm passed out, 'cause I'm a outcast like André
Hide now in an enclave, off my face
Can't concentrate from the vodka taste

Bottom of the bottle, tip it
Sold my soul, now all I got is spirits
All I get is faded as hell these days
All I get is faded, faded
Bottom of the bottle, tip it
Sold my soul, now all I got is spirits
All I get is faded as hell these days
All I get is faded, faded

Smoking on the cabbage, bitches, who's the baddest?
Pussy getting ravaged, you know
In my dreams, I never feel sadness
'Cause I dream of pyramids and Paris
If I shall die before I wake
I pray the Lord my Soul to take away
Just take it away, just take it away
Just take it away, motherfucker",https://genius.com/Allday-pyramids-and-paris-lyrics
Run A Mile,A Skateboard Soirée - EP,2012,"Baby, everything has changed since that Friday
Saturday, then every single day
Me without you, I'll be mental in the brain
I can stare at you forever, count the freckles on your face, uh
And that would be my lucky number
All you are is music in the air trying to la-la-la
Nothing other than you, you're my atmosphere
I couldn't breathe at all if I didn't have you here
And if a meteor should happen to appear
We can burn it up, so there's nothing you should fear
I say the sweetest things to your ears
Then prove them over time through the years
So tell me that you want me 'til you can't stop
I'll tell you that you want me til your heart stops
I'll say it every day until the penny drops
I would run forever, to the very top

But you don't believe me, baby
Every time I try to describe what I feel
So if you're up there, baby
You know I will run a mile up a hill
Just to be by your side
I'll be so tired, I could die
But the feeling is right
You're the reason I run a mile up a hill

You call me ""Jigga"", I call you ""Yeezy""
The corner-piece to my puzzle, you sort of complete me
Now I wonder if I got a genie
'Cause I used to say love, it doesn't have a lot of meaning, nah
But you tended all my wounds
And I don't need a doctor 'cause my specialist is you
You know the answer, you're the medicine I choose
But the side effect is now my heart is swollen 'til it's huge
Well, I blame it on me and you
All the love songs on the radio ring true
You're my autumn love and the summer fling, too
And winter and don't forget spring, too
Your eyes are deep blue, sky blue
When I look at you, I lose sight of my blues
So I put this song on your iTunes
To remind you that I'll always be beside you

But you don't believe me, baby
Every time I try to describe what I feel
So if you're up there, baby
You know I will run a mile up a hill
Just to be by your side
I'll be so tired, I could die
But the feeling is right
You're the reason I run a mile up a hill
But you don't believe me, baby
Every time I try to describe what I feel
So if you're up there, baby
You know I will run a mile up a hill
Just to be by your side
I'll be so tired, I could die
But the feeling is right
You're the reason I run a mile up a hill

Baby, I don't want you to go
And baby, I don't want you to go
I know your aeroplane's leaving tomorrow
But baby, I don't want you to go
But I know that you gotta go
And I know that you gotta go home
'Cause your aeroplane's leaving tomorrow

So Good,A Skateboard Soirée - EP,2012,"All the shit that you've been through
I don't ever wanna see you down
And I gotta say, ""Me too""
'Cause I've been where you are right now

I was a bright child, wide eyed, my mind was open
Highly motivated to succeed, quite devoted
But eventually I noticed every time I tried to focus
That my mind was kind of bogus, so we sought a diagnosis
I had hypersensitivity; ADD, I'm fidgety
Basically they want to medicate me 'til it fixes me
Man, I don't really think this is the thing for me
I know I'm kind of shitty, but I'm just trying to live in peace
You wanna make me to a zombie 'cause you're lazy
And it's easier on you to say, ""Sorry, you're crazy, man""
And if you don't take this here, you're gonna fail exams
Wait a year, your fate is that of a vagrant tramp
But this ain't making sense, I gotta take a stand
They say I couldn't live without it, well, I say I can
'Cause I never took those poison pills
And I failed school bad, but my choice was still

Good, I feel good
Knock on wood 'cause I wanna feel this way tomorrow
Mono, mono, mono, mono
Good, I feel good
Knock on wood 'cause I wanna feel this way tomorrow
Saying mono, mono, mono, mono

We making bread like Helga's while the rest die helpless
So excuse me for pursuing dreams, guess I'm selfish
Rocking hand-me-down clothes but I'm the eldest
So how the hell does that work out, Mum, can you tell us?
And I know I roll around with some red-eyed fellas
We all wanna be king like the dead guy in Memphis,
Could be living stable but I'd rather live it fast
'Cause I grew up looking shitty, all the other kids would laugh
Now I heard somebody say that I look upper-middle class
Well that's my fucking aim, I'll tell the gutter, kiss my arse
And I don't want to spit these bars but I don't have shit else
So when I'm rapping you can tell that it's my actual self
And so I brag about a girl, whatever tactic helps
To make me feel a little better 'bout the hand I'm dealt
And damn, I'm so ashamed, but at the same time
I know it's all good, I'm having a great time
It's all good

Good, I feel good
Knock on wood 'cause I wanna feel this way tomorrow
Mono, mono, mono, mono
Good, I feel good
Knock on wood 'cause I wanna feel this way tomorrow
Saying mono, mono, mono, mono

All the shit that you've been through
I don't ever wanna see you down
And I gotta say, ""Me too""
'Cause I've been where you are right now
Doesn't matter what you've been through
I don't ever wanna see you down
And I gotta say, ""Me too""
'Cause I've been where you are right now

Good, I feel good
Knock on wood 'cause I wanna feel this way tomorrow
Mono, mono, mono, mono
Good, I feel good
Knock on wood 'cause I wanna feel this way tomorrow
Saying mono, mono, mono, mono
Good, I feel good
Knock on wood 'cause I wanna feel this way tomorrow

The City,A Skateboard Soirée - EP,2012,"Cheap highs in the night getting rained on
Faded in the city that I came from
Girls told me fibs, I was too blind to hear 'em
Put apples in the bucket so we bob like Dylan
Remember, driving around an all white Nissan
Thinking about the future using foresight vision
Listening to Dad as the porch light lit him
Welcome to the world of the poor white children
Story of some middle class mall rats
Prank calling everybody in our contacts
Drinking too young, drinking too much
(Drinking too much) Right until we threw up
Then we grew up now, we’re trying to prove stuff
Excuse us, trying to get ahead like a moose tusk
I guess that I’ve been missing it lately
This here’s for the city that shaped me

Wo-wo-woah, I don’t even know
Thinking you can fly, maybe even so
You ain’t fly like me
You ain’t high like me, though
These nights in the city got me feeling out of my mind
These nights in the city got me feeling out of my mind

Yeah, I was a kid in the city that’s sun-soaked
Where some folk smoke a whole bag in one toke
Where marijuana is your partner, it’s marital
The city with more green than a salad bowl
In the city where the barrels roll
And my old girls looked like Bratz dolls
And my new girl looks like a true menace
Used to drive around faded, being too reckless
Recall all the memories in one glimpse
Recall my first loves as a young prince
Got no arse, I had girls with bum chins
Why I celebrate all the dumb things I’ve done since
All the fun shit, ignorant dumb shit
Why do we always gotta try to be smart? Shit
Rekorderlig cider, jet lighter, my blunt's lit
And my girl’s hotter than inside of an armpit

Wo-wo-woah, I don’t even know
Thinking you can fly, maybe even so
You ain’t fly like me
You ain’t high like me, though
These nights in the city got me feeling out of my mind
These nights in the city got me feeling out of my mind

Uh, yeah, the same thing on my mind in my cup again
Make my house feel like Buckingham
Try to understand we don’t have a decent plan
So we keep weed in hand 'til we feel like Peter Pan
Corners we reach fast, underneath stars
Me, deep in love in Dad’s dark green Saab
I'm ticking all the days off the calendar
One hand driving through the hills like a rally car
Faded, never fazed by the real world
And I’m looking real sick but I feel well
And I’m looking real young but I feel aged
Pill taste got me feeling like Bill Gates
Swear I been there, heaven is a real place
But sometimes the old city's a steel cage
With me and my pale-faced compadres
Living out a skateboard soirée

Wo-wo-woah, I don’t even know
Thinking you can fly, maybe even so
You ain’t fly like me
You ain’t high like me, though
These nights in the city got me feeling out of my mind
These nights in the city got me feeling out of my mind

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Wo-wo-woah, I don’t even know
Thinking you can fly, maybe even so
You ain’t fly like me
You ain’t high like me, though

When I’m Gone,A Skateboard Soirée - EP,2012,"I can rest my sleepy eyes
And know it's all gonna be alright
When I'm gone, when I'm gone

Up February night, born in a flashing light
Another life begun thanks to Barry White
And I'm very white, yeah, my skin is crystal
Little soldier to mould into an individual
Now I'm in the middle, the world revolves around me
It's bound to be about me 'til I'm old, then I'm out-y
'Til I'm gone, 'til I'm gone
The world puts it hands on you and it chews you up
Spits you out, you that you choose your path
We can never do enough
So we try to find some beauty in love, the stupid stuff
We are fatally flawed, we're only human
So in the night hope I leave only ruins
When I'm gone, when I'm gone
When I'm die and put an end to this confusion

When I'm gone, I can R.I.P. in the clouds
And ask God what it's all about
When I'm gone, when I'm gone
When I'm gone, I can rest my sleepy eyes
And everything's gonna be alright
When I'm gone, when I'm gone

Man, what is this life? Shit, you're all getting it?
Me, I'm just choking up, need more Ventalin
Me, I'm on everything medicine when I'm low and blue
They told me much once more and I know it's true
You can never satisfy a stomach that is bottomless
I think I've kind of got a grip on what the problem is
I'm gone, already gone
Yeah, more bitches, that's what I was wishing for
If I had three wishes, I'd wish for four
We work our fingers to the bone and get better shit
Then we can't find a second to spend the shit
And if heaven exists, I'll never get in
All the deadly sins I did and terrible things
I'm gone, I'm so far gone
Remember me, the devilish prince

When I'm gone, I can R.I.P. in the clouds
And ask God what it's all about
When I'm gone, when I'm gone
When I'm gone, I can rest my sleepy eyes
And everything's gonna be alright
When I'm gone, when I'm gone

Maybe I should have done better
Maybe I should have stayed
You could never show me evidence
That this is our fate
And I know you're so headstrong
And I'm just fallen snow

But when I'm gone, but when I'm gone
Just let me go
But when I'm gone, but when I'm gone
Just let me go
But when I'm gone, but when I'm gone
Just let me go
But when I'm gone, but when I'm gone
Just let me go
But when I'm gone, but when I'm gone
Just let me go

When I'm gone, I can R.I.P. in the clouds
And ask God what it's all about
When I'm gone, when I'm gone
When I'm gone, I can rest my sleepy eyes
And everything's gonna be alright
When I'm gone, when I'm gone

""Chris, you're recognised as one of the best pros ever. What tips do you have for anyone who wants to be a pro skater?""

A-Team,Euphoria,2012,"'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

It goes like this, uh
See, when I was young I met a chick
She said ""Hello"", I went red a bit
I just moved school, I was all alone
So her ""Hello"" made me more at home
We talked a bit on the phone
But she had up a wall of stone
She told me that her parents sucked
I was like, ""Well, fair enough""
I just regret I never asked
Why the hell you so scared of trust?
And what the hell's inside your soul?
'Cause I don't believe your smile at all
Guess it slipped my silly mind
I couldn't tell this at the time
She was depressed and then she left
Haven't seen her since that recess
I guess she's

'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

A year ago my friend mentioned her
""Remember her?"" I'm like, ""Yes, sir""
Haven't thought about her in forever
I hope she's doing a lot better
He's like, ""Ah, nah, she's lost control
I saw that chick, she's on the pole""
I'm like, ""What pole? The voting poll?
The North Pole? The totem pole?""
He's like, ""Nah, dog, she's stripping now""
I'm like, ""Nah, I'm sure you're tripping out
You're smoking crack and sniffing powder""
That couldn't be, she wouldn't think about it
She's too proud, she's too smart
She's too nice, she's too young
But now I know something new, huh?
How far she'll go to shoot up
How far she'll go to shoot up
How far she'll go to shoot up

'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Angels to fly
Angels to fly",https://genius.com/Allday-a-team-lyrics
Kid Did Good,Euphoria,2012,"Yeah, chubby, huh
Guess the kid did good

I guess the kid did good, kid did good
'Cause every time they get around me
They look at me so proudly
I guess this kid did good, kid did good
'Cause every time they get near me
They smile and act friendly
I guess this kid did good

Uh, small pond, big fish
More songs get made, more wrongs get did
Conscience putting me in constant shit
And boxes telling me they want my dick
And honestly I never really wanted this
But a voice in my head says ""Tom, persist
'Cause you quit school, quit ball, quit your hometown
So if you quit this, there is nowhere to go now""
I tried to quit the partying and slow down
But slowing down don't break no ground, na-nah
Na-nah, I was born in the '90s
A whole generation divorced from society
My girl says I love attention
We're cussing, swearing at another dead end, yeah
She's throwing my phone at the wall
Throwing my phone at the wall

I guess the kid did good, kid did good
'Cause every time they get around me
They look at me so proudly
I guess this kid did good, kid did good
'Cause every time they get near me
They smile and act friendly
I guess this kid did good

Yeah, uh, big dreams I've grown
Only fly boy in a no-fly zone
Saw my old life and I drove by slow
Like vroom, vroom, vroom, yeah, I made it my own
I could go back now but I hope I don't
Keep it to the highway, no side roads
And I'm so far gone and the old me is dead
Left him in a ditch with a hole in the head
Work all day 'til I fall into bed
And they call me the best like I'm already there
And I, I got Cobain's spirit, 2Pac's attitude, Allday's lyrics
Yeah, my girl says I'm a fuckhead
I'm probably gonna end up dead
She's throwing my phone at the wall
Throwing my phone at the wall

I guess the kid did good, kid did good
'Cause every time they get around me
They look at me so proudly
I guess this kid did good, kid did good
'Cause every time they get near me
They smile and act friendly
I guess this kid did good

Yeah, right now I'm feeling Iraqi
My girl's the bomb so we grom like Paris
'Cause we live fast, live fast, die happy
On a lot of flights, trying to make it by rapping
I could pull out but it's all I need
For the house with the pool and the tall palm tree
House with the fridge and the ice machine
In a bed with fresh sheets and the size is king
High ceilings is like buyers and teen shit
It's what the agent said and I believe it
My critics say I'll run out of steam
My critics say I rap without a theme, but
Pretty soon they'll be on my dick
I'm sure, 'cause my girl says I'm cool as shit, but
She's throwing my phone at the wall
Throwing my phone at the wall

I guess the kid did good, kid did good
'Cause every time they get around me
They look at me so proudly
I guess this kid did good, kid did good

Like I Does,Euphoria,2012,"Yeah, turn my back, meet the future
Hi, how are ya? It's me, the loser
From the school days, a greasy student
Nobody believed me, now see me do this
Chubby boy, all the teachers hated
They tried to drug me, get me sedated
The girls all laughed, make me feel degraded
Now they're being nice, I appreciate it
But I don't feel bitter, nearly made it
I just feel better, alleviated
Things are changing, my feet are raising
Just look at the storm that Alldeez created
Huh, I'm tired of being merely cannon fodder
Feeling like a fish out of water
But oh my god, this life is awesome
In a lucky country, all we fight is boredom
If you think you're hood, you got quite a problem
But don't give me that bullshit, Michael Jordan
I smell that porky pie and cook it
But I arrive to downsize your portion
We're marijuana-d just like it's Holland
Out all night 'til the light of morning

I don't have to worry, I don't have to worry
Uh, throw your motherfucking hands high up
Brother have to worry
I don't have to worry, I don't have to worry
Uh, if you think you feel like I does
I don't have to worry, I don't have to worry
Uh, throw your motherfucking hands high up
Brother have to worry
I don't have to worry, I don't have to worry
Uh, if you think you feel like I does

Pop my chest out, shrug my shoulders
I'm feeling stronger, becoming older
There's things I want but I can't afford them
My money's small, but only love is important
That's the shit that my mother taught me
Back when I was all young and poorly
Always skipping class, doing something naughty
Now it's a-ok, it's all hunky dory
And I'm in a new town, I'm up performing
Another party, yet another story
Yet another flight and my eyes are closed
But I love this shit, it's the life I chose
My girlfriend's telling me I'm like a ghost
'Cause I'm never at home when she tries to coke
But she wants to leave, but I tell her to stay
Paradise can't be that far away

I don't have to worry, I don't have to worry
Uh, throw your motherfucking hands high up
Brother have to worry
I don't have to worry, I don't have to worry
Uh, if you think you feel like I does
I don't have to worry, I don't have to worry
Throw your motherfucking hands high up
Brother have to worry
I don't have to worry, I don't have to worry
If you think you feel like I does, yeah, yeah

Wake up trying to make a big impression
Never be boring, be interesting
It's the good life baby, I'm Mr. West and
Fucking the whole world with a big erection
So purse your lips, kiss my behind
Yeah, I said it, hit the rewind
Purse your lips, kiss my behind
The future's mine, but in the meantime
Pull the chair up, sit down, recline
Don't miss a word, get every line
Things are hard but I must prevail
And so am I, I'm hard as nails
But life is epic, like, the bestest
Fuck things crumbling my life expectance
Don't cry and stress, that's my suggestion
Like a gem, yes, this life is precious
Clench your teeth and hide your dentures
While I stretch my legs out, I'll be climbing Everest
So I’ll find a way through the whitest desert
Swim seven seas all in time for breakfast
But I’m not eating, I’m just trying to tell you, man
My direction, when you find the legend in the making
Before it takes me all under
Forget my problems then face them after
I can't even rap on this... I'm done

Nearly Famous,Euphoria,2012,"Let's go
Find me in the motherfucking bathroom, yacking in the bowl
She’s rubbing my back watching the tragedy unfold
Like, ""Better out than in, now let’s get you home""
I’m the one her parents hate, still the best she’s ever known
And there’s vomit on my shirt, that’s how I deal with everything
I’m saying something slurred, yada yada, fuck my enemies
I think I lost my phone, who the fuck is texting me?
It’s only my poor mother, she just wonders where the hell I be
While my best friends calling her like, ""Lucy, chill
I know it's 4:00am, I swear we’re at the movies still""
Because we grew up quickly, watching all these stupid films
Now I’m living life just trying to make the movies real, like

Thinking I’m the man 'cause they say it
But dude, you haven’t made it 'til you make it
And this is not a Tumblr, I’m just wasted
Hanging at the party feeling like I’m nearly famous, whoa-oh
This is what it’s like to be nearly famous
And this is what it’s like to be nearly famous
And this is what it’s like to be nearly famous
Yeah, this is what it’s like to be nearly famous

Find me on the motherfucking floor with my eyes rolling back
My girl has given up, she couldn’t deal with all the crap
I do it 'cause it’s fun and I do it 'cause I can
But I’m older than I used to be and now it’s sort of sad
'Cause people that I grew up with are buying bungalows
But people that I grew up with are mostly dummies though
That is not for me, I had to leave my mum at home
Now I’ve got these people smiling at me I don’t fucking know
But love to my old friends, love to my new ones
Bye to the fake ones, stand by the true ones
My nana says, ""Tom, you were a boy I thought I knew once""
But so much has changed in the last few months, like

Thinking I’m the man 'cause they say it
But dude, you haven’t made it 'til you make it
And this is not a Tumblr, I’m just wasted

And this is what it’s like to be nearly famous
And this is what it’s like to be nearly famous
Yeah, this is what it’s like to be nearly famous

She says that I'll end up in a casket, in a suit and tie
I tell my girl, ""Chill, you know I’m too cute to die""
My dad's saying, ""Damn it, don’t be a silly fool""
I say, ""Only the good die young,"" Billy Joel
My youth is nearly gone, forgot where I was from
Making my way to the top but you know the ride is long
'Cause I believed the hype when they told me I was on
But I’m just nearly famous, this is not the life I want
I’m ordering these shots like I haven’t had enough yet
Telling all my secrets to these people that I just met
My girl is always crying, I tell her, ""Don’t be upset""
This what I'll do trying to get a little success

Thinking I’m the man 'cause they say it

One Day,Euphoria,2012,"One day, baby, we'll be old, oh baby, we'll be old
And think about the stories that we could have told
One day, baby, we'll be old, oh baby, we'll be old
And think about the stories that we could have told

Yeah
My book starts right here
I'm the protagonist, it's my year
They tell me that's arrogant as if I care
I don't even grimace when I get white hair
I don't ever want to be in bed by nine
In a job that I hate but pretend I'm fine
When I wake up, legs still smell like wine
Give every penny to the friends I find
I'm not trying to build an empire
Just to get by, get high, then die
My perfect life, I'm so over sight
Did I forget to mention I get pussy every night?
And besides, we're living in an evil age
So listen up to what The Beatles say
Let it be, we'll be more sane
Then I'll see you later, Auf Wiedersehen

One day, baby, we'll be old, oh baby, we'll be old
And think about the stories that we could have told
One day, baby, we'll be old, oh baby, we'll be old
And think about the stories that we could have told

And I go off land
'Til the hourglass has no more sand
Talk about love, I am no poor man
On the global campaign in my old tour van
I'm going in a new direction
It's like Goosebumps 'cause I choose the ending
Fuck the Joneses, no use comparing
You can't buy a smile with the loot they're spending
The young buying, love the sun dying
I don't need money, just the sun shining
A scoop of ice cream and I'll start smiling
Two scoops piling and I'll start rhyming
Ripped jeans and I'm sitting on the bus
Thinking 'bout things, they are simple enough
Have a little fun, make a little love
A few years past we'll be wrinkled up

One day, baby, we'll be old, oh baby, we'll be old
And think about the stories that we could have told
One day, baby, we'll be old, oh baby, we'll be old
And think about the stories that we could have told

And the world is mine
The weather's fucking warm and my girl is fine
I'm about to take this over-d, your foul is mine
I'm higher than heaven having a hell of a time
Vaginas are on the agenda
I meant to go mental forever then end in a stretcher
I'm sent to this earth to go hell for leather
I dreamt of Coachella, go eat in a bed
Are you getting the picture? Yes, I'm a hipster
Don't care what you think, I'm impressed with your sister
I'll never be rich but my head's getting bigger
With a grin like a winner, a head full of liquor
And my friends are addicted to everything bad
Attempting to have a way to never be sad
But it's tempting me man, it's the pain, it's the system we make
Everything can one day end up and be different like, uh

One day, baby, we'll be old, oh baby, we'll be old
And think about the stories that we could have told
One day, baby, we'll be old, oh baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
One day, baby, we'll be old, oh baby, we'll be old
And think about the stories that we could have told
One day, baby, we'll be old, oh baby, we'll be old

One day, baby, we'll be old, oh baby, we'll be old

Yeah!

I'm steezed out fully
Nice-arse clothes, drowning in pussy
Uh, I’m feeling gold like Whoopi
When I’m gone, just go party all night for me, yeah
It’s all day fuckery, like my breakfast’s, I'm always buttery
I could be your friend and get in your face suddenly
But pay no attention to what I say drunkenly
That’s my forte, going till I’m forty
Party till my hair's gone and they call me ""baldy""
Not like I did it yet, but I’m sure on the way
They all love me, I’m so cold you can’t contemplate
Had a spotty face, when I was off my face
Now I’m just whacked and my family forgot my face
I’m not trying to win, I’m trying to dominate
Like the way Jordan played in every single summer make

Steezed out like a motherfucker, god damn
Shut the fuck up, you come bag, fuck you

Steezed out like a motherfucker, god damn
Shut the fuck up, you come bag, butt screw

Yeah, I think I’m bloody good
Prove me wrong, I wish somebody would
Steezed so tight like a lycra suit
So I put down the blunt and the wine glass too
Now people blow smoke up in my arse, dude
Tell me I’m the best, what would I argue?
'Cause, I haven’t even hit the charts yet
But I’m not upset, I’ll reach my target
Well now you know, I just blow my own trumpet
Watch the sunrise, sleep while the sun sets
They say I’m the king, what's up next?
This is for my loyal subjects
Steezed so incredible, I eat my vegetables
This is my life, I’d rather be wild than sensible
But you can’t deny it, I’m very cool
Very cool, very cool, get ready, fool

Steezed out like a motherfucker, god damn
Shut the fuck up, you come bag, fuck you
Steezed out like a motherfucker, god damn
Shut the fuck up, you come bag, butt screw
Steezed out like a motherfucker, god damn
Shut the fuck up, you come bag, fuck you
Steezed out like a motherfucker, god damn

You Don’t Know,Euphoria,2012,"What up, Mac Miller?
(Perked Out Beats)
Shut up, hate when they do that
Allday

And they used to call me ugly
Now it seems funny
Looking back, now I never would have thought I'd get this far
And they used to call me chubby
Guess I got lucky
So unless you were around all the way back then at the start
Shut the fuck up, you don't know

Did you know me as a fat lonely kid and
My only way to smile was a black Sony Discman?
School grades low, I'm in the hallways always
Tagging things taking out my agonies in the wrong ways
You don't know my pain, I don't know your pain
You weren't there before the main meal for the entrée
On the bus nervous and I'm huddled with my bag
And the older kids tell me that I'm ugly and I'm fat
Every day I go to school I was fucking up so bad
Everybody wants to father me except my fucking dad
And I don't even mind 'cause my life is really nice
But don't act like you know me if you've only seen me twice
'Cause the same ones calling me names once
Wanna take photos and have conversations
And now that's just life and we're smiling for the cameras
Until we get old and they no longer flatter us

And they used to call me ugly
Now it seems funny
Looking back, now I never would have thought I'd get this far
And they used to call me chubby
Guess I got lucky
So unless you were around all the way back then at the start
Shut the fuck up, you don't know

Did you know I that I prefer to be alone?
But I never am, 'cause I'm petrified of silence
Did you know that I'm eternally alone?
'Cause my body can never be the same place my mind is
Can't take a breath cause I'm just so anxious
Can't stop drinking, I mean just to manage
Everybody's talking shit, I can't understand it
It's kind of like they speak another language
That I don't know; and I laugh along with their jokes
But I'm not even listening, I'm off on my own
I throw parties full of strangers to feel worry-free
But I don't wanna see them all, I just wanna sleep
So I sit out on the lawn of the house across the street
And only go inside once everybody leaves
And the clock's ticking louder, I only notice now
'Cause without all the people, it's like time is slowing down
It's like time is slowing down
It's like time is slowing down
It's like time is slowing down
Time is slowing down

And they used to call me ugly
Now it seems funny
Looking back, now I never would have thought I'd get this far

Breathe Slow,Loners Are Cool - EP,2013,"She cries like a lost toddler
Said, ""Don’t judge me,"" I said, ""I’m not gonna
So you don’t have to call me your honour""
She laughed, said, ""I keep getting in hot water""
I said, ""We’ll have a bath,"" it’s only right
You know who to call on a lonely night
You know when you fall to show some fight
But I’m not the Dr. Phil or Oprah type
I don’t have much advice for you, I’m just for you
I support you and I hope one of these days I can call you
When you pick up, girl, we hang out and I tell you I adore you When you smile and take a whiff of all the flowers that I bought you
And you don’t need to be a perfect angel or a saint for me
I know all about you, I heard the stories they warned me
But if you say, ""Boy, just wait for me""
Swear the writing's on the wall like a cave drawing, go

Well, I don’t have an answer
For these questions maybe we will never know
But you, you, you gotta breathe slow
Yeah

So she tells me her little stories
All the rich boys that she thinks are boring
And I don’t really listen fully
I just stare at her in a Biggie hoody
I tell her things and I know they don’t get through
She looks for love and a reason to live too
I wish I had those things to give you
But those things you’ve gotta find in you
And she plays the cool chick living in the Tumblr
Smoking weed in a alleyway right next to the dumpster
The boys they wanna fuck her so they text her and they bug her
She likes the attention but she can’t give them an answer
'Cause she’s looking for an answer of her own, can you blame her?
Underneath the fake her, these people aggravate her
But really I just wanna save her
If she calls up, be busting down the door like Kramer

Well, I don’t have an answer
For these questions maybe we will never know
But you, you, you gotta breathe slow
Yeah

Yeah, she says girl things, I say boy things
She likes to make things, I destroy things
She does drawing so I get the Blu-Tack
She doesn’t like 'em there, I say too bad
We hang out and I show her all my new raps
I see the real her, not the cute act
She dropped the ‘L’ bomb, then said, ""Wow, Tom
You know I’m just joking around, that came out wrong""
But I know she loves me, I can see it, it’s so obvious
We hang and talk for hours, doesn’t matter what the topic is
She is far from perfect but her demons make her what she is
And she's never smiling unless I’m in her like a floppy disk
Uh, Windows 95, party like it's '99
Every day she’s getting older, time is always flying by
Never knew how to trust, but I would try
I always liked a bit of trouble in this life of mine, go

Well, I don’t have an answer
For these questions maybe we will never know

Now I got the prettiest looker
Slap her on the butt like, ""Gimme some sugar""
I don't know love
 
but the feeling is right
We fuck until we think we know the meaning of life
Keep it in drive, eyes on the road
I got nobody, I'm all on my own
I can see my future and I think it is bright
But my parents keep saying a degree would be nice
But I tell 'em I don't need their advice
I'm driving 'round town, high beamin' my lights
Keep it in drive, eyes on the road
I got nobody, I'm all on my own
It's not that easy to decide your pathway
Had to quit believing that this life's a party
If you want a wife, she wants a guy with money
Do you want me and my life with nothing?

Seven lonely dollars in my bank account
Next month's rent in major doubt
Driving 'round town, playing 
Take Care
 loud
With the windows down
All the windows down, all the windows down
All the windows down, all the windows down

Yeah, uh, my parents keep giving me a telling off
""You're twenty-one already, all that's in your head is rocks""

They say, maybe I should cut my hair short
But no, no, no, I don't care for it

Everything is perfect right now, hope it never stops

And I'm living out these happy days like I'm Fonzarelli
Keep it in drive, eyes on the road

Just a room full of fans saying, ""Hell yeah""
And a closet full of clothes that are threadbare

Seven lonely dollars in my bank account
Next month's rent in major doubt
Driving 'round town, playing 
Take Care

With the windows down
All the windows down, all the windows down
All the windows down, all the windows down

Fucking bottle of whatever mixed with O.J
Homemade bong, feel like a cake lord, I'm so baked
On the home straight, tryna drive home straight
Take a corner like I'm German made, I don't brake
But I'm Aussie made, golden-grade Irish flesh
Cast iron heart that I possess tucked inside my chest
Tired as heck, dreaming of my fiery death
If I don't explode my own skull, I'll probably die of stress
Beside myself like Siamese,
 
all kinds of E's
Inside my palm to find some ease or try at least
I'd like to like the man I am, just so I can breathe
But the man inside of me, well, he's trying to leave
It's funny 'cause they'll call this my lyrical flow
The complexity of words near shits me though
I know they're serious, I'm growing weary though

We watch whole movies and don't catch a word
Kissing, caressing, you know the way it goes
I'll stop there cause your mum has a radio
Gorgeous in your Chuck Taylors and a short dress
Honest eyes, hope you don't lie like all the rest
We sit around and play Uno on your bed
Wait 'til your parents go out then, ohhh yes
I'm in love, I'm obsessed
I ask do you love me and you say, ""Not yet""
Then we sit in the car with the lights off
And don't go inside or do anything
'Cause I never thought I'd find a love like yours

I waited at the beach in winter for you, hoping you'd come
And oh my God, my sad lips were turning to blue
My girl in the sun
My girl in the sun

Girl, you're so spoilt, be honest
Whatever drink you like a poor guy has bought it for you
But I'd have it running in the faucet
To make sure you've got it right when you want it
And I don't have anything that shines to give you
My wallet's slim just like your limbs are
You're limber, you're just the kind I'm into
My girl in the sun, my respite from winter
We'll have children
, boy and girl ones
And live in a bad area where they sell guns
I'll work hard 'til we can leave
Move to a big house in a leafy street
And chill on the floor with our legs crossed
And don't mow the lawn or do anything
'Cause I never thought I'd find a love just like yours

I waited at the beach in winter for you, hoping you'd come
And oh my God, my sad lips were turning to blue
My girl in the sun
My girl in the sun
I waited at the beach in winter for you, hoping you'd come

I waited at the beach in winter for you, hoping you'd come
And oh my God, my sad lips were turning to blue
My girl in the sun
My girl in the sun",https://genius.com/Allday-girl-in-the-sun-lyrics
Otto,Loners Are Cool - EP,2013,"Uh, girl, tell me, why you act all sad for?
You're bored, you wanna go out more
But you have to understand that I am poor
All I can afford is a ride in my dad's Ford
So hop in, we’ll turn the car to a dance floor
That CD stack left Fleetwood Mac raw
I'll take the keys and sneak out your back door
Steal my parents car for the girl that I adore
On route to a lookout where no other humans are
I'll be deep like the universe is super large
And you can make a wish upon a shooting star
I made a wish for me to get into your bra
You know it's just you, me and the crickets
Girl, tell me, can you operate a stick shift?
I know you're feeling, down I can fix this
Drive around town 'til your frown doesn't exist

Show me a smile, no more sorrow
You can be Lisa, I can be Otto
Vroom, vroom, vroom, how does that sound?
I'll take you home when you lose that frown
Show me a smile, no more sorrow
You can be Lisa, I can be Otto
Vroom, vroom, vroom, just driving around
I'll take you home when you lose that frown

Girls like a gentleman with his own car
It let's them know you are driven, you will go far
So I guess she knows I’m going nowhere
'Cause my dough couldn't buy me a tow bar
You could have been with your friends at a club
Getting free drinks from a sensitive stud
But you're here with me, so I guess it is love
We’ll park near the highway, throw eggs at the trucks
I know it's not like you to eat drive-through
But screw your diet, you can have a fry or two
Maybe a large Sprite with some ice cubes
Hope you brought your wallet, 'cause you're buying mine too
And no, you can't smoke in here
Even with windows down, that's a no-no, dear
And I’m so sincere, I wanna make you feel special
As long as you can pay for the petrol

Show me a smile, no more sorrow
You can be Lisa, I can be Otto
Vroom, vroom, vroom, how does that sound?
I'll take you home when you lose that frown
Show me a smile, no more sorrow
You can be Lisa, I can be Otto
Vroom, vroom, vroom, just driving around
I'll take you home when you lose that frown

I wanted to watch a movie, but you wanted to drive, drive
And you are such a cutie, so let's ride, ride
Out all night, night, 'til the sun shines, shines
Speeds very high, all to make you smile
Do something that you like
Uh, wait, wait, I hear the sirens behind me
""Son, can you pull over to the side, please?
Did you know you were driving at light speed?""
I take out my keys, hand him some I.D
I said, ""Please don’t fine me
I’m finally seeing my girl smiling, took all night trying
My speed was excessive but please don’t arrest us""
He looked at my girl, took a breath, and said this

Show me a smile, no more sorrow
You can be Lisa, I can be Otto
Vroom, vroom, vroom, how does that sound?
I'll take you home when you lose that frown
Show me a smile, no more sorrow
You can be Lisa, I can be Otto
Vroom, vroom, vroom, just driving around
I'll take you home when you lose that frown

I'll take you home when you lose that frown
Yeah, vroom, vroom, vroom
Uh, uh, yeah, vroom, vroom, vroom
I'll take you home when you lose that frown
Yeah, vroom, vroom, vroom, uh, uh",https://genius.com/Allday-otto-lyrics
Single Mother Song,Loners Are Cool - EP,2013,"All the days I was tripping and falling
All the slopes I was trickling down
All the days I was looking for something
I just thank God you were around
I just thank God you were around
I just thank God you were around

Got to dedicate it to my mum, Lucy
She is cool as a cucumber, straight as Judge Judy
My dad is grand, no diss to him either
But he left when I was eight, I guess he didn't need her
Then our nuclear fam was Hiroshima
I was young and bitter, I'd give her the middle finger
Like ""Fuck you"", ""I hate you"", ""Why can’t you get me this?""
She said, ""I would if I could, Tom, we’re penniless""
And she was there trying to turn around my negatives
Through all my broken hearts and my many tiffs
Had a full-time job and she raised us up
And we were all bad boys like Ma$e and Puff

Couldn't have everything but she gave us love
Everything was tough, now I can’t say thanks enough
'Cause she gave up her life to cater mine
So I want to prove it’s not a waste of time

All the days I was tripping and falling
All the slops I was trickling down
All the days I was looking for something
I just thank God you were around
I just thank God you were around
I just thank God you were around

My mum told me that in this life, somebody wins
And if you work hard you can be who that somebody is
My mum told me to go my own direction
So when I’d get suspended, she'd just pay it no attention
Guess she had more faith than even I did
That I would do right because she told me what right is
Even when we didn't have money to buy shit
She’d spend her last dollar just so I could wear the fly shit
And I would sneak out to do graffiti on a weekday
She’d text me and say, ""Wear your mask and be safe""
She’d even pick me up when the police came
So, I'm sorry Mum for all the worry that I create
With two parents, things might have been different
Maybe more money, might have had more discipline
I wouldn't change a thing though and neither would she
Love to my mum for going singularly

All the days I was tripping and falling
All the slops I was trickling down
All the days I was looking for something
I just thank God you were around
I just thank God you were around
I just thank God you were around

That Phone Is a Brick,Loners Are Cool - EP,2013,"Yeah, aged twelve, first day at a new school
In a room full of pupils, pubescent, being brutal
It was casual dressed, which made it even worse
Me in my resting shirt, couldn't let them see me hurt
They're all in Ralph Lauren but me, I'm just poor as shit
At a private school and I'm only here on scholarship
The girls ignore me and I'm beat up by the older kids
But the teachers quiz me like
""I wonder what your problem is?""
Well, the kids in my neighbourhood all think I'm an asshole
And the rich kids hate me 'cause I don't live in a castle
And my home life is fucked, I'm copping shit from my uncle
At school I get in trouble, these are things that I juggle
So I save my lunch money and starve for months straight
To get a phone of my own, I'll be cool, you just wait
Then I finally get it and I show it to a kid
He's like, ""Ha, ha, ha, that phone is a brick!""

The cool kids used to say this shit, like
That phone is a motherfucking brick
That phone is a motherfucking brick
Where the hell'd you find something that big?
And the hot girls used to say this shit, like
That phone is a motherfucking brick
That phone is a motherfucking brick
Why are you talking to me? You're weird

I'm like, why are you laughing, motherfucker?
You have one of those, exactly like mine
He said, ""You'll find that was months ago
Of course I've got another phone, since I'm not poor
I already sold that old dinosaur to a pawn store
In fact, it was probably the same place you bought yours
But I understand, man, it's not like you can afford more""
Damn, that flattened me, took everything I had in me
It was supposed to be my ticket to popularity
But it turned, out actually just more pain and tragedy
'Cause adults can be mean but kids are really damaging
So I left at lunch, I was so fucking embarrassed
Head slumped in sadness, just to punch my mattress
Hating all the rich kids, what a bunch of actors
But pursuing their approval of pathetic double standards
Feeling so defeated like a total idiot
So I took my brick phone and binned it

The cool kids used to say this shit, like
That phone is a motherfucking brick
That phone is a motherfucking brick
Where the hell'd you find something that big?
And the hot girls used to say this shit, like
That phone is a motherfucking brick
That phone is a motherfucking brick
Why are you talking to me? You're weird

Now as I build up my life as a grown man
With the newest piece of shit on a phone plan
Home in a leafy street with more than enough things
I tell myself to remember how little stuff means
And then I think back
To all my memories of everything stressful
And realise it's integral to the recipe
So really they were right, in this moment it clicks
My life is a wall and that phone is a brick

The cool kids used to say this shit, like
That phone is a motherfucking brick
That phone is a motherfucking brick
Where the hell'd you find something that big?
And the hot girls used to say this shit, like
That phone is a motherfucking brick
That phone is a motherfucking brick
Why are you talking to me? You're weird",https://genius.com/Allday-that-phone-is-a-brick-lyrics
Bright Colours,Noue Yesue,2011,"And I really wanna see bright colours
Sometimes when I look in your eyes, that's all I see
Then I just close my eyes in the sun and I see
All the bright colours in the spectrum
And I really wanna see bright colours
Sometimes when I look in your eyes, that's all I see
Then I just close my eyes in the sun and I see
All the bright colours in the spectrum

I can see it girl, you got a nice figure
I want you in the flesh, I want you in a picture
But under the moonlight, the dude's eyes shimmer
I am more than what you see in the mirror
You got a nice wardrobe, Narnia
Are you a queen or a queen at the Mardi Gras?
Do you have a booty I can see from the front o' ya?
Will you make my day feel sunnier?
When we touched for the first time, we sparks fly
You give me butterflies like the sunshine
Are you ready to go, or do you need time?
When we share our secrets, can you keep mine?
When I'm down, will you tell me it'll be fine
And bathe in my salty tears like the seaside?
I just wanna know before we go any further, girl
Are you seeing these bright colours as well?

And I really wanna see bright colours
Sometimes when I look in your eyes, that's all I see
Then I just close my eyes in the sun and I see
All the bright colours in the spectrum
And I really wanna see bright colours
Sometimes when I look in your eyes, that's all I see
Then I just close my eyes in the sun and I see
All the bright colours in the spectrum

Is your love infinite, without limit?
Or do you love and give it up the next minute?
Do you trust yourself? Can you trust me?
Do you want a big dog? 'Cause I'm a puppy
Do you get moody and cause fights?
Will you make it up to me all night?
Are your friends gossip queens?
Will they be constantly hovering around and bothering me?
Do you read books and not magazines?
Were you born with it? Or is it Maybelline?
Are you prepared to deal with the foul moments
If I feel off the wall, like tearing down posters?
Do you love me though? Or do you love my dough?
Are you a nutcase? Pistachio
Are you a princess? I could be Mario
I'm excited to find out how far we go

And I really wanna see bright colours
Sometimes when I look in your eyes, that's all I see
Then I just close my eyes in the sun and I see
All the bright colours in the spectrum
And I really wanna see bright colours
Sometimes when I look in your eyes, that's all I see
Then I just close my eyes in the sun and I see
All the bright colours in the spectrum
And I really wanna see bright colours
Sometimes when I look in your eyes, that's all I see
Then I just close my eyes in the sun and I see

Girls In Jeans,Noue Yesue,2011,"Girls in jeans (and we go round and round)
Girls in jeans (and we go round and round)
Girls in jeans (and we go round and round)
Girls in jeans (and we go round and round)
Girls in jeans (and we go round and round)
And we go round and round
And we go round and round

Letting my light shine, let it shine bright
Trying to find time, trying to fly right
Trying to be me, trying to keep you
Trying to move on, still trying to re-do
Trying to neglect rules, still respect space
You wanted good head? You got a head case
Want to let fly but I’m still at home base
Want to just cry, got to keep a brave face
I dated girls with a brain like a peanut
I dated girls in jeans that made my knees knock
Now I’m trying to ship out, now I’m trying to clean up
Trying to add sugar to a storm in a teacup
You've got a lot of nerve to be calling me
But you know I’ve always liked it when you’re naughty
Now I hate you, wait, baby, I’m sorry
Come back to me, it’s not the end of this story

Girls in jeans (and we go round and round)
Girls in jeans (and we go round and round)
Girls in jeans (and we go round and round)
Girls in jeans (and we go round and round)
Girls in jeans (and we go round and round)
And we go round and round
And we go round and round

Wish I could protect you, still, from this foul world
But you ain’t my girl, we both protect ourselves
Now my eyes wander, wondering how to swallow the horror
Wallowing in self-pity I borrowed
Hollow, hello, I’m a monstrous fellow
Might break your heart, just play your cards like Tarot
Sweating in the sun, sung by a steel arrow
Like sand through the hourglass, you were my wheelbarrow
I don’t wanna regret it forever
I just wanna feel better and better but
When it boils down to what I’m doing
But I’m doing my best to pretend that I’m cool and
I dated girls with a past like Iraq
I dated girls with an arse like fine art
Now my sheets smell of a girl I don’t know at all
If I can take it all back to that phone call

Girls in jeans (and we go round and round)
Girls in jeans (and we go round and round)

Gonna Be,Noue Yesue,2011,"Hello, hi, I'm that so fly guy to you, forever
But it never lasts like a coke high
Oh, she got me off my feet like a clothesline
I knew I had to take her home, she was so fine
I said maybe we could skip for alone time
I couldn't wait, we made love by the roadside
She got so excited, our peaks coincided
I won't deny it, I like a lady that's open-minded
I like to go slow, like I own a hybrid
I like to go fast, because I know you like it
Looking for the treasure, like a boat with pirates
Once I found it, she couldn't keep the moaner quiet
They got every type of vitamin and remedy, but
There'll never be you, forget about the jealousy you got
Extra loving, extra heavenly, ecstasy
Forget your ex, it's me

Did you run away?
Can I ask you? I need to ask one thing
It's been playing on my mind, I've been wondering
Can I ask? Just to see how you feel about it
I wanna know how you go trying to live without it
And I feel like I should ask, would you run away
By my side, if I have to chase another day?
And everywhere that I go, would you follow me?
'Cause everywhere that you go, you know I'm gonna be

She like a romance cheesy, macaroni
Gotta think about children and matrimony
I'm thinking about Diana and Dodi
Nobody needs to know, so we gotta keep it low-key
She got me in a spin, pirouette
She gave it everything, dripping wet
Feels like getting head while giving head
And I'm gonna do it 'til there's no beautiful women left
Once upon a time they had an eye on us
Trying to pry aside all our life and love
As someone told me, hot air rises up
That's why I tell a lot of lies so I can fly and stuff
She hits me hard like a summer wind
And leaves an outline just for me to colour in
And I know she ain't in love with him
She need a grand old bastard and a charlatan

Did you run away?
Can I ask you? I need to ask one thing
It's been playing on my mind, I've been wondering
Can I ask? Just to see how you feel about it
I wanna know how you go trying to live without it
And I feel like I should ask, would you run away
By my side, if I have to chase another day?
And everywhere that I go, would you follow me?

Kids In Love,Noue Yesue,2011,"Roll your window down, or something
The sun's out

People say, ""If you love it, set it free""
Nah, stay here, spend a century next to me
I will love you and guard you so preciously
When it comes to the crunch like a lettuce leaf
'Cause planet Earth, without having her
Would be like the morning without any births
And I had her first, and I'mma have her last too
Me and you, there's not a thing that we can't do

Brittany Trueack

And she said
I know you want to tell me something, baby
And she said
I know you want to tell me something, baby

People wanna come out and say whatever was
People wanna get in our way and sabotage
It don't matter much if they think we can do it
We just on our own in a tight-knit unit
We're sailing through this life on a cruise ship
Ain't an iceberg big enough to ruin it
We're young and foolish and starry-eyed
But we're old enough to know this is hard to find

I know you want to tell me something, baby

Are you my soul mate? Yeah, you probably are
How can they judge our love looking from afar?
Love your body, girl, I'm your bodyguard
Ain't no other girl, I swear, would cross my heart
And I believe in a thing called love
It's all we got, so don't tell me it's not enough
You may be warm inside like the sunny weather
We can fly away from here, yeah, on my zephyr

I know you want to tell me something, baby

We could be outlaws together, always on the run
Cheap motels and payphones, take it as it comes
Modern Robin Hoods, just delaying all our funds
Or we could stay home, growing ancient and plump
I could share your load when it's weighing a tonne
It's us against the world and we're taking it on
And our two hearts together are braver than one
And we might never make it but we aim for the sun
[Chorus: Allday &

She said
I know you want to tell me something, baby

I will keep you safe when the tide comes in
If you cry, I will wipe your cheeks dry again
I will walk into the middle of a lion's den
And all the doubters, we would silence them
I'm having the time of my life and I'm glad you're here too
With me 'cause I'm definitely grinning when I'm near you
And when I peer into my rear view, the clouds dissipate
And the sky is a clear blue

When you're going, will you come back?
When you're going, will you come back?
When you're going, will you come back?
When you're going, will you come back?

Moon Song,Noue Yesue,2011,"I'm the moon and I'll be
I'm the moon and I'll be
I'm the moon and I'll be
I'm the moon and I'll be

I think I might have saw a mermaid
And she's so perfect in the worst way
I was skipping stones on the lake
My mum told me not to be home late
I told her I was early for tomorrow
All I needed was a treasure map I could follow
And I would be there in the morning
As the fog lifted and the sun brought the warm in
I would catch the night when it fell
And only listen to the inside of a seashell
There were icicles on the branches
And silence when the night is at its calmest
I would lie down among the grasses
With the dew seeping through my pyjamas
And I would take advice from the moon
And he always told me the same thing too, he'd say

I'm the moon and I'll be
Always watching over you smiling
Just look up and gaze at me
Time never changes me
You're all embracing big moon
I'm the moon and I'll be
Always watching over you smiling
Just look up and gaze at me
Time never changes me
You're all embracing big moon

I think I might have saw dark clouds
When it rains, cup my chest, pour my heart out
I mad a raft that I floated to the ocean on
I dug a hole and I slept through a snow storm
'Cause I remember when you were naked next to me
You eating an apple, me breathing heavily
You definitely had me open like sesame
But we aren't the same and we just can't pretend to be
If I am spinning a globe on my finger
Trying to get warm to the bone before winter
But lately her wind doesn't shake me
I'm still warm from the thrill of escaping
I took the road to far away, I ran away
But I couldn't breathe so I had to come back to stay
And I will take advice from the moon
And I hope that he tells me the same thing too, he'll say

I'm the moon and I'll be
Always watching over you smiling
Just look up and gaze at me
Time never changes me
You're all embracing big moon
I'm the moon and I'll be
Always watching over you smiling
Just look up and gaze at me
Time never changes me
You're all embracing big moon

I think I might have saw eternity
He told me that he didn't have a girl for me
He sat me down and told me life is regret
I knew it in my heart but I was trying to deny it
I could fill up a cup from all the times that I wept
And fill up an arena with the lies that I made
I felt horrible, I felt like a lost soul
I sat in the dirt trying to turn into a fossil
Caught my reflection in the still water
I saw a stranger looking up at me in real horror
But I found solace in his pained eyes
So I went and built a kingdom in the grey skies
Exhaled my stresses into the evening
I was so relieved when I finally grieved in
I went and took advice from the moon
And he told me the same thing he always does too, he said

I'm the moon and I'll be
Always watching over you smiling
Just look up and gaze at me
Time never changes me
You're all embracing big moon
I'm the moon and I'll be
Always watching over you smiling
Just look up and gaze at me
Time never changes me
You're all embracing big moon",https://genius.com/Allday-moon-song-lyrics
Morphine Lemonade,Noue Yesue,2011,"I feel the texture change
As the summer welcomes some rain
Another year spent here in this place
Caught in a dream
Caught in a dream, again

Summer come and go like sunny weather, so bright
When the winter snow white, hardly ever know why
Oh my, and the leaves will fall
Oh my, better sweep them all
Ninety sweaty nights that I already wish away
Not a lot of options, guess that we are here to stay
Okay, no sleep at all
Your moods are seasonal
Underneath the linen sticking to the bed, spread out
Come and be here with me while I quiver all year round
Now, the winter ghost whistles
Leave me alone with my impulse
Whisper with the wind, tell me things that I never heard
Pretty little fibs that you and I could ever work
You had me, you're the sun in my eyes
My winter full of your white lies

I feel the texture change
As the summer welcomes some rain
Another year spent here in this place
Caught in a dream
Caught in a dream, again

Little birdies sing like better when it's spring time
Affecting how I see life, blessing everything's fine
Feel high, morphine lemonade
I close my eyes and get away
Following my dreams and preparing for a nightmare
Wanted on my team but you never seem to like it there
And you left me here in the desert
Squinting at the sky so desolate
Serenading you as the winter's getting warmer
Never making ground, just forever treading water
Soon, your deep brown mocha eyes stay inside no colour
You in the bath, sort of lukewarm, your cheeky grin
Turning all the taps with your toes and me singing
""I feel the texture change, tell me it's gonna be okay""

I feel the texture change
As the summer welcomes some rain
Another year spent here in this place
Caught in a dream
Caught in a dream, again
Caught in a dream, again",https://genius.com/Allday-morphine-lemonade-lyrics
Nowhere At All,Noue Yesue,2011,"Blood shed and the rivers run red

Take this big bad world and flip it 'round

Wake up and I'm there

Seconds are precious, death is reckless
It don't care
And when it's gonna come? I just don't know
And I'm sick to death, I just wanna go home

I got an inkling maybe we shouldn't be here

No war, no more
Nowhere at all
No war, no more

No war, no more
Nowhere at all, nowhere at all

Thank God, finally war is over
Only death remains, has a strange odour
The bags are all sewn up
And the bones of the boys that had no luck
No more aeroplane motives and bomb shelters
Don't thank me, we're happy to help, it's just
Let's not talk about it anymore
The newspaper says that it's all lovely
Can't wait to feel my mum hugging me
The cliffs are growing back shrubberies
Where my bodies were laid to rest suddenly
Never thought this thing could end
But now the clock ticks again
And I feel sick to death
I dodged every bullet, just like I said

Just say no war, no more
Nowhere at all
No war, no more
Nowhere at all
No war, no more
Nowhere at all
No war, no more
Nowhere at all, nowhere at all",https://genius.com/Allday-nowhere-at-all-lyrics
Rickety Bike,Noue Yesue,2011,"Ride my rickety bike down the hill with no hands
Nothing bad's gonna happen to me
Ride my rickety bike down the hill with no hands
Nothing bad's gonna happen to me
Ride my rickety bike down the hill with no hands
Nothing bad's gonna happen to me
Ride my rickety bike down the hill with no hands
Nothing bad's gonna happen to me

When the streets are bare, when the skies are grey
I get on my rickety bike and I ride away
Down the old brick lane and Chinatown
Past the pier, up the hill to the lighthouse
In the quiet, I hear the waves crying out
I think I feel the earth move while I'm lying down
This moment on the cliff above the sea
When the wind is the cherry in the gluttony
I sit and stare at the ground that's under me
A sweet daydream away from all the other things
And I run to the forest, all deep green
And I listen to the sound of my breathing
And meander down an overgrown path
Where the bees are humming bug like Mozart
I stop and smell every rose I pass
And it heals the pain of a broken heart

Ride my rickety bike down the hill with no hands
Nothing bad's gonna happen to me
Ride my rickety bike down the hill with no hands
Nothing bad's gonna happen to me
Ride my rickety bike down the hill with no hands
Nothing bad's gonna happen to me
Ride my rickety bike down the hill with no hands
Nothing bad's gonna happen to me now

She told me everything she feel is pure
I told her she don't love me, she is insecure
But she still want me to give it to her
And I will, until she start to think it's more
I ride in autumn and watch the leaves fall
Ride my bike along the sea floor
My legs are so tired but I keep on
I ride to leave behind my demons
My bike is too rickety to get me home
But I love it too much to ever let it go
I saw a shoreline through my periscope
Met a woman with gold hair in Mexico
And she smelt of vanilla and biscuits
She liked to keep me at a distance
And we would tangle up like a pretzel
And I would ride home, feeling all special

Ride my rickety bike down the hill with no hands
Nothing bad's gonna happen to me
Ride my rickety bike down the hill with no hands
Nothing bad's gonna happen to me
Ride my rickety bike down the hill with no hands
Nothing bad's gonna happen to me
Ride my rickety bike down the hill with no hands
Nothing bad's gonna happen to me now
Ride my rickety bike down the hill with no hands
Nothing bad's gonna happen to me
Ride my rickety bike down the hill with no hands

U.F.O,Noue Yesue,2011,"Little sunshine, let's get it sun-kissed
That right one will never have one wish
I rewind and erase my blunders
What I would do for a taste of her tongue kiss
I don't know you, I never have known
I'd let you know me but I'm just a shadow
I am on the road to nowhere
And I don't really really wanna go there
If you wanna leave me, you're allowed to
But where would I be without you?
Here me out, girl, me without you is not right
I just need an hour or two
'Til the morning light, 'til the morning come
'Til your parents come and knock and now we on the run
Now I could have her, but she's not the one
She's not you, girl, that's the problem

You say ""Jump"", I say, ""How high?""
You say ""Run"", I say, ""Let's go""
You do wrong, I'm your alibi
You wanna leave, I'm your UFO
You say ""Jump"", I say, ""How high?""
You say ""Run"", I say, ""Let's go""
You do wrong, I'm your alibi
You wanna leave, I'm your UFO

She's a rabid wolf, bright animal eyes
All natural, so you know I had to fall, right?
I didn't get a manual, we're alright
Star sign incompatible, we're so wrong, it's right
When she thinks she's so mysterious
We walk the beach like the day is limitless
Explore areas that never get visitors
And sit in the sand 'til the cold's nearly killing us
She asked, ""Are we mad to be feeling this, or is it serious?""
Girl, I promise that it really is
'Cause lately I'm sick of hanging with idiots, baby
That's why I'm working all your angles like billiards
Now I can be sweet to you, he can be vinegar
I'll treat you better 'cause they don't make 'em prettier
That's why I gotta lock you down like a prisoner
Think so similar, my co-conspirator, come on

You say ""Jump"", I say, ""How high?""
You say ""Run"", I say, ""Let's go""
You do wrong, I'm your alibi
You wanna leave, I'm your UFO
You say ""Jump"", I say, ""How high?""
You say ""Run"", I say, ""Let's go""
You do wrong, I'm your alibi
You wanna leave, I'm your UFO

We're just tryna live our lives and be happy
Never grow old or get married
Carry on like we can carry off anything
So roll with me in my chariot, get in
See women, I sure know how to pick 'em
Pretty girl without a brain cell in 'em
This one, she got the physique of a dancer
Baby, can I be your Secret Santa?
I know we can be friends like Phoebs and Chandler
But can I be Monica? I need an answer
We fall in and out of love, we like the sound of love
But are we down for love, or is it drowning us?
I like to get girls and count them up
Take 'em home and get busy on the couch and stuff
And you say that I'm never around enough
But I can't keep you pleased, you're a sour puss

You say ""Jump"", I say, ""How high?""
You say ""Run"", I say, ""Let's go""
You do wrong, I'm your alibi
You wanna leave, I'm your UFO
You say ""Jump"", I say, ""How high?""

Angels,Soft Grunge Love Rap,2015,"I got a guardian angel, she's with me right now
Watching over me, everything I do
I cross the road with my eyes closed

Yeah, well, this is for the angels
I used to skip school, go hang out at my Grandma's
Come back for art to hit on Jade, I never cracked her
Used to ride on empty, South Road up to Flagstaff
In my shitty Mazda, rusty brown and smashed up
A year later, I met Jess, goon drunk with a fat ass
She'd come 'round in her Dad's car
She drove that shit like NASCAR
Before I was a rapper, I just was a guy that freestyled
At parties for status, I never had none
I used to spend every day with my friends in the garage
Or talking shit with my cousins on the carpet at Nanna's
I think they stop believing that I'm coming like Santa
But my circumstances changed, I'm just doing what I have to
I have dreams of fucking angels and coming down
The white sheets in rooms with views above the clouds
Take your time until the right moment
Then move quick, you don’t get a twice over

'Cause time moves like a good butt jiggles
Satisfaction is a long, hard riddle
And I wish you good luck with it all
And I wish you good luck with it all
If there's angels watching over me
I hope they focus on someone more deserving
If there's angels watching over me
Well, this is for the angels

Sometimes I feel as lonely as Pluto
That's when I let the drink throw me like judo
I love my friends, but my homies aren't you though
Growing past conversations like go and fuck two hoes
I'm actually sick of messing with these hoes
I guess I'm growing up, I took my time to, but here we are
The world is spinning fast, dancing 'til the jig is up
Getting all the hate is fine, it’s the love that’s trickier
My old area don't feel the same
People I used to idolise are seeming lame
And I know it's me that changed, after all that we attained
I don’t need much but art and some love to keep me sane
I say that shit but yo, I'm in the club and it's closing
Fucking with hoes that only wanna fuck 'cause they know me
Suffice to say it's dope, but I'm lonely and isolated at times
In this ivory tower that I created

'Cause time moves like a good butt jiggles
Satisfaction is a long, hard riddle
And I wish you good luck with it all
And I wish you good luck with it all
If there's angels watching over me
I hope they focus on someone more deserving
If there's angels watching over me
Well, this is for the angels

She said, ""I'm tripping on you, baby, I'm tripping on you""
Could it be the drugs in our bellies? I'm feeling it too
And you can come up in this world, I'm living the proof
You got the flower power, baby, you really in bloom
Thinking of stupid shit I did, I should regret a lot
I guess it's not all bad though, looking at where I got
Already as if I'm done, I don’t think I'll ever stop
I'm gaining on the leaders, my old rivals' already lost

And I'm feeling some way tonight
And I'm feeling this way tonight
And I'm feeling some way tonight
With the light on your face
With the light on your face",https://genius.com/Allday-angels-lyrics

We watch cartoons in the morning
Then she whisper something soft

And she knows how to fuck as well
I’m way too poor to be her daddy
I think she’s too smart to be my girl
I stole her a skirt from the sports store
'Cause she dress like Serena will
I said, ""Can we stay like this forever, maybe?""
She said, ""Baby, I think that's chill""

Grammy,Soft Grunge Love Rap,2016,"You are listening to another Allday Chubby Boy mixtape
Hosted by none other than me, Allday Chubby Boy

I ain't been to Tokyo, I never been to Paris
I ain't got no money but she still call me Daddy
Send a photo to my phone, she ain't got no panties
Got me thanking God like I just won a Grammy
Like I won a Grammy
(Ooh, girl, let me see it, ooh, girl, I'ma eat it
Ooh, girl, got me singing, ooh, girl, got me singing)
Like I won a Grammy
(Ooh, girl, let me see it, ooh, girl, I'ma eat it
Ooh, girl, got me singing, ooh, girl, got me singing)
Like I won, I won a

Looking at you now and it have me going wild
Did two pills back at the show tonight
Got me spending money like a dad with no time
Got me spending time like a dad when he retire
I was dreaming of this rap shit back in '09
Laughing at the battles and it had me so defiant
With a backpack, rapping on tracks that no one liked
Ain't the same one that I carry on my flights
That was 300 bucks from the online store
That used to be a week's pay, oh my God
Now I'm halfway there, at least quasi-toward
What I said I'd do, I gave my whole life for it
Never went to school, Ferris Bueller
When I was starving, now my belly fuller
Got me thinking of the girls who took it
Back when I had not any moolah
Now I'm singing

I ain't been to Tokyo, I never been to Paris
I ain't got no money but she still call me Daddy
Send a photo to my phone, she ain't got no panties
Got me thanking God like I just won a Grammy

Ooh, girl, got me singing, ooh, girl, got me singing)
Like I won a Grammy

Ooh, girl, got me singing, ooh, girl, got me singing)
Like I won, I won a

Wonder if I like the way I became
(Oh, fuck, I seriously don't know though)
I can't change anyway
Came a long way from the 8 o'clock train
Razor blade in my hand, tryna make it off safe
With my phone cut off, always pay it off late
Now a text in my phone and it's saying your name
Damn, girl,
 I could marry that booty in a chapel
Maybe even you as well
'Cause, baby, we're all living in a mad world
Told my brother, never trade for a bad girl
'Cause bad girls, there is always ample
And if she don't make you wear a Ansell
That means that you'd better wear a Ansell
Now I'm singing

I ain't been to Tokyo, I never been to Paris
I ain't got no money but she still call me Daddy

Never win a Grammy for this bullshit
I'll probably never get married to a woman
I'll probably be back in my mum's garage, choofin'
And if your weed refracts light then it's good shit
But I need awards like I need a new chick
Not at all, they both make me too sick
Say I'm a square like cubic
The truth is, I prefer being indoors, making music
I thought I was getting married to a girl
Already did so much damage to myself
I said that I wouldn't start travelling the world
'Til they paid me then my rapping started to sell
I'm going on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
You know the time is wrong for guarantees
Like a watch without no batteries
I'm not real honest but I'm not quite a liar
New girl on my pole like a damn firefighter
Her genes so good that I bust right inside her
Never meet your idols, never fuck your idols either

Talk your language like Doctor Dolittle
Boys in clubs always saying, ""You’re beautiful""
And you'll be like, ""Come on dude, chill""
Or we can roll up a blunt to burn like the crucible
Do a line off of somebody in a cubicle
I'll do almost anything, I don't say ""no"" a lot
And I don't need a yacht, baby, to go overboard
We get drunk just to make the hangover stop
It's hard to stay sober if the place is going up
And it's always going off when I step in there
Girls in sportswear, sweat me like Phys Ed
I just think with my dick, I'm a dickhead
Yeah, how'd I fit inside the door with my big head?
I'm in my room just staring at the wall
Thinking 'bout ya

'Cause I don't believe in magic, I just believe in you
Baby, there's no right answers, we're just getting through
'Cause I don't believe in magic
'Cause I don't believe in magic

And I'm sure your boyfriend's the sweetest
But he does lack a certain me-ness
And all my ex-girls say I'm the meanest
But fuck those hoes, that don't mean shit
'Cause I've got my own demons to beat like Peter Parker
Smoking Mary-Jane reefer,
 fucking singers
That's why my life feels like a musical
They better play R. Kelly at my funeral
So I don't wanna rate you with a numeral
But ten would be the number that is suitable
That's why I heard a handsome guy saying
""Why's she with that dude? He must be, like, famous""
And I don't mind, baby, with how my fast life's changing
I probably can't be there as much as it might pain me
And my mums car's broom-broom
 and your sex drive crazy
Like Mercedes and I'm with you 'til the hell fires flame me
No red lights baby and your body's gyrating
Still a teenage dirtbag, let's listen to Iron Maiden
Yeah, you're my favourite, yeah, you're my favourite
Don't regret my statement, high as Empire State is
No ""if""s, ""kind of"", ""maybe""s, born right after 1980s
I wanna take you to bed, girl, no hibernating
Wanna message all the time just like we're dating
And we might one day, if you don't mind waiting

And I know it's kind of crazy
I never thought that it would go this far
Go this far
Yeah, I know, it's kind of crazy
I never thought that it would go this far

I’m on a victory lap
Of my city, the pretty girls kinged me, believe it or not like Ripley
The demons I got within me, threesomes they got me busy
It's more from indecisiveness these days, really, I’m not that kinky
They wanna get to me, bouncers miss me with the frisks
Real Gs move in silence like a hippie in a Prius
I got more enemies than I can think about or list
But I’m not Buzzfeed, motherfucker, and I really never slip
And sleep rarely
Boy, I’ve smoked too much weed, clearly
'Cause my ex-girl keep nicely suggesting I need therapy
I think all my enemies must have a weak memory
'Cause when they next to me, they neutral as the Swede embassy

The Swede... I think I meant the Swiss Embassy
But that whole area of the world seems so neutral

Driving in your dad's Jeep Cherokee on an illegal substance
I be swerving like Kyrie Irving in Cleveland's offence
I drink spirits and Spirulina in even portions
I never said I’m living right, I’m just being honest
Keep your daughters indoors for a Alldeez performance
But I been creepy before this shit, I don’t need an audience
I can spit alright, but that's the only thing I’ve conquered
Sometimes I hate being alive, but fuck the easy option
I'm in a holding pattern like jets when a freezing storm hits
Thinking morbid thoughts of coffins I could be more warm in
I be re-recording 'til early in the morning
'Til ""I've heard it too much"" is the only critique for it
I grew up with no money and a fat CD wallet
Now I'm fucking rich girls, making these deposits
I’m demonic, I came up through a well out of hell’s core
I don’t like myself but I sure hate everyone else more
I’m on a world tour like Al Gore, high on planes like Belfort
Fuck my main girl with a condom
So I can fuck these other girls raw
I know I’m self-involved, I'm self-destructive and I’m self-taught
I grew these old balls real heavy like a cell door

And I spent my last money on molly
I’m tryna change my ways but they ain't budging
I’m not getting no better
I’m not getting no better
And I spent my last money on molly
I’m tryna change my ways but they ain't budging
I’m not getting no better
I’m not getting no better

Everyone says that I’m doing things they never thought
But when I was fifteen, I saw this story getting told
You know I had the same best friends since I was twelve years old
So if you fuckbois really want it, they gone help me brawl
And if I’ve got to hide a fuckin' body, they gon' help me dig
Most of these girls tee-ball, they gone let me hit
Most of these rappers be on some real fuckin' jealous shit
But when they see me they in the club, they ain't gone mention it
Drinking Evians, I need my third eye open wider
My eyes are like tinted windows, I’m the chauffeur driver
On the lonely nights, I need my own Winona Ryder
Circa 1990, fuck her good and probably blow inside her
I’m that No-Doz-eating dopey creep with no hope
Reading Nietzsche just to fuck the scenester girls
And that's the only reason
I skated to my home loan meeting, ""Boy, how much you saved?""
I said, ""I spent my last money just the other day""

And I spent my last money on molly
I’m tryna change my ways but they ain't budging
I’m not getting no better

Fuck all the mixxy flows, really though
I wanna talk, not just send each other videos
Back in '04, spitting raps in a flip phone
To an anti-fashion icon, the kid grown
Vogue mags on my coffee table
To the grave via bad bitches from the cradle
They used to talk shit but it wasn't fatal
I'm still here, although I'm off the rails
Like a phoenix, scenic route touring Winnebago
I wish I could be around more but I’m the big dog
Glenn Rob thinking 'bout all this
When something happened, I would be in town for it
Not anymore though
Guess I got sick it, all started with mono
I was friend zoned like Gordo
Now I'm Peter North in a porno, bitch swallow, but
In between we smoke weed and drink rum
I rarely come home and never ring Mum
And fuck, and you'd be mad while I'm tryna think up
Excuses in a stupor when I couldn’t get my thing up
All these feelings I can't bring up
Is this real, are we a thing? Mystery sucks

Just to find a gutter on the roof, man, I had enough
All to be a legend like Bagger Vance
Was the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air slash Blackwood once
Tell me who's taken, what I need to add it up
I don’t even check my bank, I just scan my card
My treat, my treat, feel like the King of Oz, Sa’id, Sa’id
I’m not even rich, I’m just happy I can eat without shoplifting
Can’t stop thinking I'ma beep
Consistent wolves all thinking I'ma sheep
Girl talking to me wrong, start thinking I’ma leave
Garrett, can’t kick the the fucking habit
You don’t write your hooks and you're not much of a rapper
Yeah, I was filling books, pages becoming tattered
Reminiscing on days when nothing mattered
Guess you walked under a ladder
'Cause you said I wouldn’t blow up
I guess that was an error, I remember
With your luck, ditch the Powerball games
I’m keeping mental notes of these doubters' full names
All the power obtained to my head, but in fairness
Put myself on the list, all the weed got me nervous

Tell the fuckbois it's time to leave

Now that I’m out of my team, still out of my mind
And I’m still down on my grind like Tony Abbott has done
So the only chronic I’m on is 
2001
‘Cause I’m trying to make my mummy way more proud of her son
So I’m hustling my own self right out of this slump
Got no pills or powders, it all may be talcum
I’m ‘bout to make a million but first I’ll make a thousand
Put it in my bank and then I’ll hire a great accountant
Let it compound, then get a car to take you out in
Employ a maid and a gardener and a lawyer
And own a mansion with a fountain and a foyer
My parents told us that success is important
Want to swim in the money, never testing the waters
There's no rest for the wicked, no bread for the cautious
Let's get to business, step into my office, let's go

Two times three times four
Good times, bad times, oh my lord
Six times seven times eight
Good times bad, the time it takes
Two times three times four
Good times, bad times, oh my lord
Six times seven times eight
Good times bad, the time it takes

I’m Allday, well, that’s really just a name I made
To etch into the wet cement for when I fade away
Me, I see you know you think I’m out, but
Day to day I’m taking every step, working up a sweat, Gatorade
Man, everything I do it well when the ladies watch
Australian Jamie Foxx, just laughing the haters off
But I’m wondering if I’m about to pay the cost for my efforts
Is it worth it? In the end, maybe not
I’m spinning in my own whirlwind here, taking off
Where love goes, hate of course follows, yeah, take your shot
I admit I’m metal so that I’mma call me Arthur
You know who to ask for if you really wanted drama
Now I’m in a free fall, I keep falling faster
People are piranhas, well, some more than others, uh
Although we’re numbers but what it comes down to is one thing
Hit the tap running, yeah, we drown you

Two times three times four
Good times, bad times, oh my lord
Six times seven times eight
Good times bad, the time it takes
Two times three times four
Good times, bad times, oh my lord
Six times seven times eight
Good times bad, the time it takes",https://genius.com/Allday-234-678-lyrics
Boutique Flow,Soon I’ll Be In Cali,2012,"Uh, Allday, soon I'll be in Cali
Let's get to business

Doing 80 in my dad's Saab on a starry night
Not a car in sight, me and my black heart
Face is mangled, my mane is tangled
I'm so depraved, grabbing at angels' ankles
And just dangle, looking for a place to fall
I know my fate already, it's inescapable
I'm spitting raps like you're spitting chips
Man, I'm spitting for the little guy, never for the privileged
Born from a hailstorm, rains on me everyday
But I stayed on my grind until it went away
Better days came for me, classical underdog
Stay for the others all instead of running off
Such a cunning fox, strong as a young ox
That's why I smoke a wrapper up until my lungs clog
It's that boutique flow, it's that boutique flowing

Always crashing, never landing
Always crashing, never landing
Always crashing, never landing
Man, it's that boutique flow

My Lego's like the Sphinx's nose, man
They think they know all about it, but they really don't
You need a bigger dose until you're docile
Swear to God, free above, you got no style
Grey day in the city trying to force a smile
I got my bulldog face on, I'm volatile
Just adventure to the nest of the hornets
Man, just 'cause you want it, does not mean you're ready for it
I know I'm ready for a heavy wallet
I carry the whole world on my shoulders, try to tell me drop it
Flow Moses on the brink of escape
Facing calm seas like the skin of a snake
To all my homies still swinging their blade
Know it comes back around like the link of an 'a' and
Karma's gonna get us in the end
That karma is a bitch, can't ever be your friend (Ho)
Whatever doe, heavy dough
Allday rap for sport, I'm athletico
Get the sweat off your lips, son
I ain't even dropped yet, get off my dick, son
I'm a nerdy guy looking up to cooler guys
Hope nobody calls my bluff, I know it's all a lie
And I'm full ready, I am now too old to die young
Don't know how it's done, like a poltergeist

Always crashing, never landing
Always crashing, never landing

This is my love affair with the country air
There's a place I like to go visit
There's a place I like to go visit, uh, uh
There's a place I like to go visit
It's called the countryside, it's so
It's called the countryside, it's so vivid

There's a place I like to go visit
It's called the countryside, it's so vivid
I took a trip to the country and it felt good
Give me a saddle, I will blaze it, Mel Brooks
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree
Guess the hassle with the city has got to me
Rabble, rabble, gotta watch it constantly
Keep everything you own under lock and key
I'd like to see your wallet be just not footwear
I'm tight, I don't wanna tie with my good gear
Breathe the good air, I'm coughing up soot here
Conversing with strange persons they put here
I'm going to the country where it's rural
Where the snakes say 's' and not plural
When there's no signal to call your back
Where it's beautiful, where it's pure and all that
And all that, and all that

But I can never be from the countryside
I can only go so I can't decide if I really like it or not
'Cause I'm a city boy, like it or not

Welcome to the great outdoors without pause
Take the highway, get a couple hours off, it's quiet
Might take your troubles down a notch
Nobody here you scream out here, so mouth off
And we could hack all day 'til we found the loss
And look down on the town from the mountaintops
It would be raining and the clouds of fog could come in
We'd run around and the cows could watch
Locals in overalls, outfits and everything
Real in the field just been plowing and shepherding
Reap what you sow, overpower my enemies
Houses aren't much, how's the serenity?
Out here's my territory, or I think so
We see the stars Ringo, let everything go
And when the speed of light seems to be slow
It's when I hear my ringtone, 'bzzzzz'
It goes 'bzzzzz', it goes 'bzzzzz', it goes 'bzzzzz'

But I can never be from the countryside
I can only go so I can't decide if I really like it or not
'Cause I'm a city boy, like it or not

That's cool
This is my love affair with the country air
This is my love affair with the country air

Man, what the hell you know about it?
I been on my own damn, I been on my own damn
I been on my own damn ice skates

I know my ego's been stupid
It's got it's own ecosystem, I'm a hedonist
But be lotus, we both know what my libido is
My steelo to steal hoes like freeloaders
Call me the Nemo fish, I'm so tanked mentally
Bench pressing, me? No, thanks
Benchmark pressing, I'm flexing with no breaks
Take coat hangers to locks and close banks
Gimme the loot now, don't make this a shootout
I got a million troops and only seven sins
That's my henchmen, I ain't scared to send 'em in
Shit, I ain't scared of anything

I been on my cheddar thing, getting my nookie and
Big bills like a pelican, like I should be

So I'mma throw some blades and my aim is perfect
Vermin is a rap and you are that
Vermin is a rap and you are that
This ain't a poem, it's a portable bomb
Liable to explode on any corner you're on
You'd rather stand right on my balls lying
Like ants out of the hole, shady like poor lighting
All I can give is this, all I am
It's like a long runway on a short island
Uh, this is your captain speaking
Strap in, bitch, 'cause I'm actually leaving
Boastful, anti-social personality
Mostly myself making a total fool out of me
Losing my boundaries, defenceless
Thinking 'bout Benzes, that's what I'm thinking 'bout

What you know about it?
I been on my own damn, I been on my own damn

Journeyman,Soon I’ll Be In Cali,2012,"All I know is nothing good in this life comes without a fight
I’m a journeyman, I'm a journeyman
I’m a journeyman, baby, I’m a journeyman, baby
All I know is nothing good in this life comes without a fight
I’m a journeyman, I'm a journeyman (maybe the journey can)
I’m a journeyman, baby, I’m a journeyman, baby

And my mum is a boss, so it’s all for her
And we never really had a lot of dosh to spare
She was going it alone, pair at solitaire
And my dad did his best but he wasn’t there
So I told I would make it and I promised her
That when I get a little money, you don’t got to work
But until I got a throne you can watch the chair
And I'll probably be on it 'til my posture's bent
What the heck though, I feel rich in my rags
With a spliff to forget what I wish that I had
Got a roof overhead and a chick in the sack
And the car that still goes though it isn’t a Jag
Got a minute for sadness
The only breaking down I'll be doing is dancing
When I make it out of here alive and I’m not a face in the crowd anymore
I’m trying to be your favourite now

All I know is nothing good in this life comes without a fight
I’m a journeyman, I'm a journeyman
I’m a journeyman, baby, I’m a journeyman, baby, I'm a

And my dad is the rock, so it’s all for him
And every hit the he got, he took it on the chin
And he turned it right around, can not box him in
And if I could be half the man that he’s always been
And he taught me everything that I'm knowing
So surely everything I get it I would owe him
How much do I love him? It just tears me open
How red is the desert? How wet is the ocean?
Now I'm trying to get better in every moment
Trying to get going but it’s already in motion
Can’t fool me, school me, I’m already ruling
This kingdom is mine, find a line, I’m falling
I’m shining, I’m ready to define my fortress
And make my own luck 'cause I’m tired of wanting things
But I never can quite afford them
When they shows us the pie but don’t provide a portion

All I know is nothing good in this life comes without a fight
I’m a journeyman, I'm a journeyman
I’m a journeyman, baby, I’m a journeyman, baby, I'm a
All I know is nothing good in this life comes without a fight

Mirror ball, mirror ball, mirror ball, mirror ball
Mirror ball, mirror ball, mirror ball, mirror ball

People talk, people talk down nonsense
Take no offence from their off-hand comments
Most people are just working out their problems
But most of their lives do have a bit of substance
We can sit here and talk all constant
I can just chill and let you work out the cobwebs
You can tell me anything whenever you feel sad
See my lips are sealed, I'm like a steel trap
I can tell you lies like a little rat
And you would never even know where I'm really at
I could say I'm sorry, it wouldn't be the case
Promise you better, but could you really see me change?
I should love one of these girls, I'm sure of it
But I ain't naive enough to fall for it
So I just pick a fight and call it quits
I know it's all in my mind, yeah, I'm on some shit

Mirror ball, mirror ball, mirror ball, mirror ball
Mirror ball, mirror ball, mirror ball, mirror ball
Mirror ball, mirror ball, mirror ball, mirror ball
Mirror ball, mirror ball, mirror ball, mirror ball

I'm straight making paper, smoking forests
With naked babes that look like Pocahontas
And the girls say I'm so dishonest
I'm waiting for the right one, a total goddess
I'm so reputable, I'm so renowned
I just play a number game like a head count
See the level I'm on is so penthouse
Bring your friends out, we can all get down
And paint the town red like it's Man U
I want you out of my head but the bad news is
You had roots, I was straight up, bamboo
Told you the facts, you had to move
And your attitude shifted, acted rude, but you knew
Wishing we could join our lids together, New Zealand
You could be the one that I'm meant to find
So an I get a minute of your precious time?

Met someone that makes the world more simple
Makes every single one of my pores tingle
Knowing the past, I sort of been cruel
Girls are hard to quit man, that's why I call them Pringles
To me I got love in them, more love
Do I love them? Maybe, yeah, sort of
I got a lot of lust and a robust injures
So you must be something special to grasp my attention
I know I'm gonna pay for my passing discretions
Charm is a weapon, juice pass like lemons
And my dead relationships above in the heavens
Probably wonder why when it fucked with your best friends
Let's be candid, I'm insecure
When I'm in something good, wonder why I'm in it for
That I would be anything if I could
Just to have you light up my life, mirror ball

No sweater slung over my shoulder
Oxford scholar, glad you could follow
Jacuzzi with a Puerto Rican floozy, hola
Then I pole her, never gonna call her
Bruce Jenner discipline me, I slap arses
Me, I'm that patterned room floor, I lack marbles
Me, I got attitude, so I'm in the back row
Inflating the swagger up, even though I'm flat, bro
And look at how I blab the most
I don't even converse, I just brag and boast
And I don't even do nothing but mellow on the porch
And roll up a big joint like your elbow
Uh, by the high from your dearest
Floor full of Polaroid snaps like pyramids
Blowing weed in imported green tea
Eating smorgasbord like Hokkien mee

Bitch, I go to Oxford, bitch
Bitch, I go to Oxford, bitch motherfucker
Bitch, I go to Oxford, bitch
I'm so smart
Bitch, I go to Oxford, bitch motherfucker
Bitch, I go to Oxford
I'm so smart
I'm very smart

Flavoured vodka, am I flagging to chicks?
Spewing out the window, zigzagging my whip
I drink until I can't feel my legs
Then back to my crib for some no-feeling sex
Feeling, bitches give me head like the Mayans
I don't even need it, but I just like the silence
Motherfucker, now I'm in the land of the dying
Standing defiant, body-slamming Goliath
Yeah, I'm on my double-o seven in the compound
From Russia with love, eyes redder than Moscow
You take the high road, I'll take the long route
Ride until the wheels fall off and I conk out
Pray to the clouds above, I'm illing
Charging through the ugly city, it's so dreary
Holler if you're here with me, smoke to the ceiling
We hang low like J-Lo's earrings

Mmm, tastes so, mmm, tastes so good

Allday, and all night and forever more
All my girls’ arses are edible in denim shorts
Got old bitches on menopause so you never pause
White boy Steezy, paler than a dead man’s corpse
I’m so self-assured, they tell me settle down
Just gotta press record, I bring the metal out
The kennel, it’s impossible to lock me in
I’m never underground, I need a bit of oxygen
Are you with me in this R-rated movie?
Getting catered to by a half-naked cutie
Sue me if you must, take all that I got
See you’re better off trying to squeeze water from a rock
‘Cause I’m poor as, I’m often working with holes in my socks
Rock and roll locks but it’s all in knots, what?

If I look good, it’s all thanks to my mum’s ironing
Diamond in the rough, yeah, I’m the one shining
Out here earning my stripes like I’m umpiring
Fan base grabber with the camp male manner
No temple cracker like a damn frail nana
Don’t forget the stamp on my fan mail package
Trying to get my name on the Fantale wrapper
I create a buzz around here, lightyear

I'll get twisted up like the lid on a jar
My life's sweeter than cinnamon buns, man
Swimming in funds, man, isn't it fun, man?
But I ain't really one man, still a boy
Guess something that I do gets kooch really noise
And they seem to enjoy all my silly ploys
So I had to tell my old chick to go Illinois
Now I been out here on my chase for skrilla
Trying to get paper like a laser printer
Head's thicker than timber is, knock wood
It's good not to mind, but mine is not good at times
But I live with the spiders and the rats
In a run-down mansion, hiding, writing raps
In fact, I'm not even normal in the head
Never catch my disease, it's horrible to get

To improve the future by ruining your present

And I'm not sure if I can feel but I will be
Soon enough, who to trust? I am merely the
Innocent party in the cell full of guilty
You could throw away the key, but I will
Bend the bars, and find a way to leave
And I was never much, no one ever rated me

'Cause I don't wanna go but I'm sticking to my course
And now I'm on my own shit, all alone shit
So I can either own shit or follow my own shit
In my mind's eye, I can see my faith waiting
I must make haste and leave the safe haven behind
And I won't always be fine like a late fee
I'm going to yearn for the life I'm escaping
And probably cry in bed alone, saying, ""Get me home""

Still live with my mum and my brothers in the house
Old cars still broken down, it's why I'm walking 'round cold
Still eating from the same old chow bowl
With discount couscous and bread, ripping out the mould
Sipping alcohol down 'til my control is gone
Still angrier than Harry with a faulty wand
But I still fuck a fat bunch of bitches
So hot you need oven mitts on and touch the bitches
Still suffering from mad money issues
Why I'm still at the pizza parlour scrubbing dishes
Still got my long hair, still run from scissors
Hold a lot of grudges, still say, ""Fuck forgiveness""
'Cause people don't change, I still know that much
A grown bad slut is still a bad slut
I know I'm still divided by that stuff
No matter how I try, it still doesn't add up

And still leaving clues to my blues, that's cryptic
Still hustling looking for my next G
'Til I got a lakehouse, 'til I got a jetski
Still will be 'til my wealthy is filthy
Still will end up down in hell if you kill me
Feel free, 'cause I still feel the flattest
I'm still afflicted by the same silly habits
Still feeling dizzy on this ever-spinning planet
'Til the casket disintegrates and then fills with maggots
But I'm under the spell swallowing blue pills
I'm not ready for how real the truth feels
Still throw the dice just to show that I'm nice
Still making highlights in my lowlife

This is how I'm living still

Some things never will

Sun This Warm,Soon I’ll Be In Cali,2012,"And sometimes this life sucks, but not for long
'Cause I can't complain too much for sun this warm

Today I woke up in a castle I built
With a grin like Garfield right after a meal
I guess the darkness left me to be here in the light
That's rare for me, like a leap year
Ear-to-ear grin with the maximum cheese
'Cause sometimes the world's not as bad as it seems
Actions speak louder then just flapping your beaks
If you speak, remember use your manners, it's free
That's what my nana says and I listen
'Cause she's my main chick and she's packed full of wisdom
In the distance, I see a lot of speed bumps
You're only in the seat once, you just gotta speed up
We say we wanna fly, we don't want the G-force
I know it will be mine, no matter what I dream of
Why bother? We all sorta have these thoughts
But life is a riot like your soccer team lost

And sometimes this life sucks, but not for long
'Cause I can't complain too much for sun this warm
And sometimes it gets hard to keep keeping on
But I can't complain too much for sun this warm

I thank God for the diamond bracelets that I'll have
No matter what time it takes us
I thank God but my eyes are faithless
Biting my nails down, trying to fight my anguish
For now, I'm really just behind on payments
I'm player hated, my sleeves are lined with aces
But sometimes, I guess I just smile to fake it
To make it through the day but I quietly hate it
But today, I feel the light in me burning bright
So I give the world a shine of my pearly whites
And I give the world a piece of my little heart
I'm doing me, if you hate it then rip it up
If you love it then call me from a phone booth
Gushing 'bout my flow 'til I'm blushing like, ""Oh, you""
I told you I was getting better, so true
Less money, less problems that we go through

And sometimes this life sucks, but not for long

And sometimes it gets hard to keep keeping on

So don't be scared, Goosebumps, R. L. Stine
So goaty-arse spitted all my heartfelt rhymes
But I'd rather be skinny than have a dumbbell mind
And besides, I'm really not the tightest swimmer
I would get CPR, though revive me, Kimbra
Now it's gonna be awkward when I'm finally a winner
She can meet me at the ARIAs and buy me dinner
Sign and sing about, bathers we wring 'em out
Watch them swim around the pool 'til I nearly drown
Are you serious? Vanilla Galliano
I'm a serial killer so I hope you carry guns, bro
I'm your super soakers, the girl is worldwide
See, every night, it's a party full of headlights
We know how to have fun, even when I'm being slow
We live in a lucky country, we have never seen snow

So tell me, why would I wanna go home?
I wanna stay here where the time goes slow
So slow down, so slow down
And it's cool as long as you don't drown

So here we are poolside, feeling just mighty fine
Feeling all types of good because of my Pisces sign
Just trying to find my footing up on the diving board
I don't jump, I just walk the plank like a pirate would
Why should I try to stop? Yeah, I would die before I give up this life
You see, I'd rather be high and probably light a puff cannabis
Where young Pamelas, they call me Tommy Lee among other comparisons
Walking unbalanced, we a bunch of young savages
Drunk gallons in the sun 'til we relic some radishes
We're in for summer and calendars, time flies
If I'm a pussy, that is fine, I have nine lives
If I'm a rookie, then I'm Shaq in '92
Taking it to Patrick Ewing, I'm a Magic kind of dude
The car's desolated and the pool's chlorinated
The time's getting wasted 'cause we all holidaying

So tell me, why would I wanna go home?
I wanna stay here where the time goes slow
So slow down, so slow down
And it's cool as long as you don't drown
So tell me, why would I wanna go home?
I wanna stay here where the time goes slow
So slow down, so slow down
And it's cool as long as you don't drown",https://genius.com/Allday-the-pool-lyrics
This Charade,Soon I’ll Be In Cali,2012,"Allday the critter
Soon I'll Be In Cali
I can't keep this charade up any longer

Uh, so can I be honest for a second?
Will you forgive me if I am?
I can't keep this charade up any longer
Let it ride, let it ride out

In high school I had a pizza face
Op shop clothes, girls gave me the snob nose
Freak of nature, funny how the seasons change
Now the same hoes scream my name
And you won't hear me complain, I'm keen for it
Nothing's gonna be the same, I need more of it now
I used to fall in love like a trap door
Now I wonder what the fucking hell the trap's for
Now I wonder what the fucking hell I rap for
'Cause all I talk is pussy, all I see is catwalks
Want a Lamborghini, not a second-hand Ford
Sit in my room wondering what I stand for
Just pour the damn drink in my glass now
And I will dumb myself down 'til I pass out
I wake up tomorrow and regret it all
With another girl's number I will never call

So can I be honest for a second?
Will you forgive me if I am?
'Cause I can't keep this charade up any longer
Na-na-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah
This charade, this charade
This charade, this charade
'Cause I can't keep this charade up any longer
Let it ride, let it ride, let it ride out

So I get high, I get high like altitudes
I get high where they bottle the Mountain Dew
And wherever I'm at, that's the powder room
Here's my soul, watch me pour it out for you
And my car broke down two months ago
I wanna fix it, but really, my money's slow
So excuse me if I'm ready to fucking blow
All of a sudden and then hook up everyone I know
And excuse my French, I'm uncivilised
I'm just writing it out as I live my life
But my life became a poem of its own
'Cause I can either make it or slowly go on home
And I think about it, the moment I'm alone
I'm so scared to fail, here's hoping that I won't
But I don't really ever sleep
I just lie here, alone, perpetually

So can I be honest for a second?
Will you forgive me if I am?
'Cause I can't keep this charade up any longer
Na-na-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah
This charade, this charade
This charade, this charade
'Cause I can't keep this charade up any longer
Let it ride, let it ride, let it ride out

And my ego grows, every minute it thickens
And I'm looking through magazines, just picking out chickens
Like I could have her and her, and her and her, and her and her
And it's so appalling, so appalling
And I can't keep this charade up
Na-na-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
This charade, this charade",https://genius.com/Allday-this-charade-lyrics
11:30,Soon I’ll Be In Cali 2,2013,"I'm on the rise, what you call that?
I'm on a high, what you call that?
'Cause nothing feels like 11:30
No, nothing feels like 11:30
And my persona is way out
Tell me what you wanna say now
'Cause nothing feels like 11:30

And I don't even know where I'm going
Away, aye, oh
And I don't even know where I'm going
Tell me, where's this party?
Aye, oh

I'm riding in my whatever, my whatever, my
What's the car? All that matters is we're together
It's my friends and we ride 'til we die
That's the gangsta rap shit that we try to live by
And we smoke herb, we get higher than high
And we sigh like this is the life, this alright in here
Minutes ago I was diminished
But since I finished this blunt, it's clearing up
I see these pretty hoes, really, I don't give a fuck
While I've got my city's love, everything is brilliant
Riding for my postcode with everything, we're so, so, so hopeful
But oh, my buzz feel like slow-mo to me
But at the super speed that I go, though
All I see is weird blurry things from my showboat
Excuse me if I boast, bro
I was a bozo with no hope, now it's 11:30

And I don't even know where I'm going
Away, aye, oh
And I don't even know where I'm going
Tell me, where's this party?
Aye, oh

I'm puffing on the whatever, the whatever
It's work a little, live a little bit for pleasure
It's can I keep my nanna and my mum at heart?
I need inspiration while I'm waiting up to come apart
Half of this is for the haters, all to shut 'em up
The other half is 'cause I suffered for my love of art
Tryna take a car load out the art show
Warhol on my wall holes and some Pablo, I love those
I'll probably never hang 'em up though
I'll be out skipping countries like jump route
Wait, wait, wait, wait, I'm ahead of myself, chill
How quick am I driving? Seems like the world's still
My head has felt ill, you better get real
If you don't do this shit for me, know your friend will
Excuse my rudeness, I'm having a moment
But it's 11:30

And I don't even know where I'm going
Away, aye, oh
And I don't even know where I'm going
Tell me, where's this party?
Aye, oh

11:30 by my phone time, I grew up in my own time
I never read the road signs, just me and my low life
Friends I can rely on and oh my, as time goes by
We're strong as iron and defiant
As we take what I was born by storm, living for my people
Rest assured, I'd die for 'em if it comes to that
But gosh, what fun is that?
I'm maggot, so excuse me if I'm jagging, where the party at?
My presence got the beers all sweaty like a jumping jack
Girls chuck the number at me like, ""Here, Chubby, catch""
I'm like, ""Relax,"" don't do it like my guards through the sunroof
It's open, I don't know where we're going
And that's the harsh truth
When I find a hour, walking like police do
You know the type of entrance, people hush when they see you
And all the commotion, Moses parting the ocean
But it's 11:30

And I don't even know where I'm going
Away, aye, oh
And I don't even know where I'm going
Tell me, where's this party?
Aye, oh

And I don't even know where I'm going
But I'm in no hurry, aye, oh

And I don't even know where I'm going
Away, aye, oh
And I don't even know where I'm going
Tell me, where's this party?
Aye, oh
And I don't even know where I'm going
Away, aye, oh

Bored,Soon I’ll Be In Cali 2,2013,"We keep walking down that road
And we keep walking down that road
And we keep walking down that road

It's been a long day in a long week
In a short life, so boring
We hold up, it's alright, I'm just tired, like, ""Poor me""
Pour me some more life, I'm grinding like this coffee
No sugar, I'm going weird, going bunta, I hope it clears
Yesterday a little ghost appeared
Told me the milky man's goatie bear
La, la, la and so I did, la, la, la, drank most of it
I know this, I'm a little Homer-ish, looking like Jimbo Jones and shit
I got a girl who's the baddest, but I think I need two, damn it
No, I really need two planets to keep all my suits hanging
Think I need my room padded just for a new challenge
Just for something to do before I start sniffing glue

As a boy I was a little bored
Now that I'm grown I'm a little bored
I guess we're all just a little bored

We keep walking down that road
We keep walking down that road
Yeah, we keep walking down that road
We keep walking down that road
We keep walking down that road
Yeah, we keep walking down that road

We live and die, but do we really live?
As our fingers type and all you hear is clicks
I think I've lost it, more sick than an ano chick
And I'm bored stiff, more stiff than Orlando's dick
Ah, I got my Jesus do, don't care ""what would Jesus do?""
There's bullshit on the TV news and most of us believe it too
They call me evil, dude, 'cause I don't mind my Ps and Qs
Or pee on cue like Tour de France
I'm full of drugs, like more than Lance

As a boy I was a little bored
Now that I'm grown I'm a little bored
I guess we're all just a little bored

Drinking Up Slow,Soon I’ll Be In Cali 2,2013,"Wake up sweating out shots
In my dreams, I'm tearing down spots
I got steez like out of my pores
I got keys surrounded by doors
And I did drop right out of my course
Now I just rap as loud as I want
Motherfuck me, what does that mean?
It's a mixtape so not a damn thing
Man, can I just live?

Ay, fuck you all, I came up
Out all night, don't try to wait up
Working on songs, I'm tryna make luck
Hear my old songs, I'm thinking they suck
Hear my old songs, I'm thinking they suck
But fuck it though

Pro-weed, pro-noise
Always on tour, go home with no voice
Getting more known, remember, don't point
Life is a movie reel, it's so Hoyts
Life is a box of chocolate treats
Life is a bitch, top off at that beach
Tanning those tits, tanning those nips
But all the bad vibes, the camera don't miss
And all your bad thoughts, you had to notice
Are keeping you stuck, that's phimosis
The world's blowing up, they're on my shaft
And I'm in the lift, aiming for the stars
Don't be so thirsty, go pour a glass
Of your own sweat while I'm warming up
I walk around town like I'm the shit
And maybe I'm not, more likely I is, my dreams

When your dreams are all coming true
That place where your dreams are all coming true

Yeah, did I mention? Grunge is back
Girl smoke a Soundgarden, just relax
The rain in Seattle, train seats rattle
Lot of drunk motherfuckers talk a bunch of crap
I keep my head down and focus on sparks
The fire got started, hoping it lasts
We melt away pain, frozen in chunks
Spin dry life, our clothes are not us
Ay, like leaves on a vine
We can make wine with a piece of a mind
I know that heartbreak's the reason I rhyme
They talk about cash like things will be fine
If lies are all true, your heart is all black
Like problems collapse when faced with tall stacks
Build up and tear down and that's the format
Me, I go backwards up the wrong track
I'm keeping it steezy, drinking up slow
Leading my people into the water
I got no money, believe me, I'm broke
Leading my people, hoping they'll follow",https://genius.com/Allday-drinking-up-slow-lyrics
Eye Drops,Soon I’ll Be In Cali 2,2013,"I think I'm gonna need some eye drops, tomorrow
I'm really gonna need some eye drops
We've been going out late, having too much fun
Too much, too much, too young, so I'm
I think I'm gonna need some eye drops

Uh, talk to me about the nightlife, I have no day life
Wake up in the twilight zone
I gotta make it feel lifelike, so I get a little high
Right, our time is finite
But it's flying right, this red-eye flight's the life I like
But I'm so tired by it
Hair tied back and bitches would lie flat
Slap their own arse, just beg me to ride that
Yeah, I probably wonder where her mind's at
I rap not for pussy, I get my cat wearing a five-cap
Having a nightcap, perhaps even a tablet, no fucking iPad
I'm in a loud room trying to meditate
I'm in a full place trying to get away
They ask me where I'm at, trying to set a date
I tell 'em Allday, motherfucking every day

I think I'm gonna need some eye drops, tomorrow
I'm really gonna need some eye drops
We've been going out late having too much fun
Too much, too much, too young, so I'm
I think I'm gonna need some eye drops

When the sun's up, no need to rush
When the moon's up, that's when we do stuff
And humans are not owls but you adjust
With all of these hooters around for you to touch
You must sit down, roll some huge blunts
Like Puma laces, fatter than new mums
And since they think that I blew like tubas
People treat me like some ink to use up, heh
Well, I'm in two minds having group hugs
Took your shine but I don't give two fucks
Girl took a shine to me like a toothbrush
You said I shouldn't drive on flu drugs
So get behind the wheel like an inventor
I got no Futurama, I'm on a big bender
My receptor's all fried, et cetera
Try to get better-er but life gets heavier now, uh

I think I'm gonna need some eye drops, tomorrow
I'm really gonna need some eye drops
We've been going out late having too much fun
Too much, too much, too young, so I'm
I think I'm gonna need some eye drops

Yeah, yeah, and you can tell by the bloodshot eyes
Uh, chyeah, fuck it, what's another missed flight?
Tell reception we need another night, like
Yo, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Dinner for breakfast, start days when most people end it
Life's there to bend it, uh, tip a little bit of nos in the engine
Then vroom-vroom, light it up like your headset
Uh, knocking panels off bedheads
Uh, dimmer switches and incense
Uh, follow Fridays with big Saturday nights, fuck a hashtag FF
Nine down, so buckled I couldn't buy a vowel
And when the light hits, dive south
So pardon the silence and the dry mouth
But I'm on auto-pilot 'til lights out, so, so

I think I'm gonna need some eye drops, tomorrow
I'm really gonna need some eye drops
We've been going out late having too much fun
Too much, too much, too young, so I'm
I think I'm gonna need some eye drops

Yeah, you know what everybody in my neighbourhood like
Just trying to live a good life
If only we knew what one of those looks like
We came in with the best intentions
But left with more regrets than I care to mention
Damn, I mean I really tried though
But some of these kids can find a party with their eyes closed
When my iPhone lights up, I'm out the door
Forget them promises I made and that one before
Neon house party, let's do it up together
She said, ""Promise me tonight's gonna last forever""
I'm like, ""Sure, Cinderella,"" but I know you well
Last time I held your ponytail 'til you're feeling better
But like whatever, whatever
I feel like a good time to slow down is never
Throw your hands high, hit the lights off
And I'mma be out here singing

I think I'm gonna need some eye drops, tomorrow
I'm really gonna need some eye drops
We've been going out late having too much fun
Too much, too much, too young, so I'm
I think I'm gonna need some eye drops",https://genius.com/Allday-eye-drops-lyrics

Hello matey, it’s me, the so shapely, overweighty fat fuck
I'm ice-cream cone crazy, Oreo tasting (yum)
My father don’t praise me
With a beach ball gut like I carry my own baby
Skin so flakey like a painting in the Louvre (true)
Socially awkward, I'm strange and I'm aloof
They made me in a petrie dish, raised me in a tube
Now I'm driving 'round the city with a lady in my boot (let me out)
Innately I'm frustrating, just a vacant kinda dude
Go walking like I'm Walter, wake up naked in a fugue
Too many buegs and I'm slower than the YouTube sloth
Wanna fuck with me? You do not
I'm fat, you should see me with my muumuu off
Now these rappers want to kiss me where my do-do was
See I smuggled in some googs in my Fubu socks
Catch me going fucking mental in a Bluejuice mosh

It’s the fat fuck boy with the flabby gut
Breathing down the phone

But can he bust quicker than a junkie with his bally up?
Been days since he's smacking up
Don’t even get me angry, punk
See I'm frustrating myself to be around me
I'm like a twelvie towny, a real freaking Downy
Found me in your driveway, just trying to key your Audi
Wake up crying in a sweat
From a dream of Bieber drowning
Astoundingly disgusting, there’s really nothing there
In my brain, so deranged, I feel pain punching air
'Cause I can’t mow the lawn
And the neighbours love to stare
And my dad's like, ""Yeah, you gotta grow a fucking pair""
And my life is solitaire but I'm too dumb for cards
Too hyper for Monopoly, I’m too drunk for bars
More obese than Toadie, got a humongous ass
Trying to fuck all the time like I’m Susan and Karl

I hate the way you talk to me, and the way you cut your hair
I hate the way you drive my car, I hate it when you stare
I hate your big dumb combat boots and the way you read my mind
I hate you so much it makes me sick, it even makes me rhyme
I hate the way you’re always right, I hate it when you lie
I hate it when you make me laugh, even worse when you make me cry
I hate it when you’re not around, and the fact that you didn’t call
But mostly I hate the way I don’t hate you, not even close

Oh, yeah
Sick, that's cool
I don't even know what to say, but, duh-duh-duh-day
Nah, I'm good (Fuck everybody)
I don't even know what to do, but (Must be love)
Yeah, uh

Steezy gentleman, blood full of medicine
Pseudoephedrine in my head again
Whatever, but I'm eating out this pussy like a pelican
And when she go 'bam', that's when I'm in my element
Afternoon delight, singing everything (Everything)
Love the pussy and the kush and the bed I'm in (Bed I'm in)
Fuck staring in her eyes, need some chilli chips to set upon
She get hysterical like Americans when Ellen's on
You're elegant, but this is only therapy, don't get it wrong
Drive the continent along, still no one compare to Tom
Looking serious like I'm tryna prevent a bomb
Good pussy feeling like Lebanon
Listening to '80s hits, stuff to make a baby with
Picturing Madonna in her prime, I'm an atheist
Feeling like Basquiat, but I can't say that shit
Doing me some dumb art, drawing up a naked bitch

Shit, I love pussy, I think you know
Yeah, I love pussy, can't even leave it alone
Talking 'bout
Pussy this, pussy that, pussy this and pussy that
Pussy this, pussy that, pussy this and pussy that
Pussy this, pussy that, pussy this and pussy that

I love some pussy like a second home
And I don't even have a house, my other place is getting dome
Visit your special zone, watch a movie, share a cone of vanilla
'Fore we start to bicker, yes, I'm error prone
I know I went way over the quota
Let Free Willy do the dictation just like Jonah and the whale
I guess she's eating blubber 'til it choke her
And my head's feeling light for a stoner
If it's broken then fix it, if it's not, then chill
The world is just illusion, this is not for real
For each of your hot meals, I've had a hottie squeal
I've picked the pretty flowers and left a lot to wilt
And I'm not proud but still, I'm not ashamed of it either
Had nuggets to fire up, clocking the miles up
High on this homegrown, it's nothing designer
But this pussy's from Milan and I'm up inside it

Shit, I love pussy, I think you know
Yeah, I love pussy, can't even leave it alone
Talking 'bout
Pussy this, pussy that, pussy this and pussy that
Pussy this, pussy that, pussy this and pussy that
Pussy this, pussy that, pussy this and pussy that

Sorry to the women I offend and shit
But good pussy, well, that's an imperative
And I like intelligence and I like a feminist
But I don't need arguments to fight like my parents did
I'd rather get high as shit, I'd rather become the man
You can suck rubber dicks, my hair's in a rubber band
That's just my master plan, I hope you can understand
I was ripping off underpants, back seat of my mother's van
Tank full of pussy fumes, leading on numeral
Think numero uno, man, the ego is chewing fuel
Bag full of stolen goods, sweating it through the mall
Cops chasing us down, we're just chasing what's beautiful
To nail it like cuticles, call it home improvement
Call me Tom the Toolman, the bitches so effusive
Guess it's due to music, I do know one thing
I love pussy, I love pussy, it's lovely
Shit, I love pussy",https://genius.com/Allday-luv-pussy-lyrics
Music Sounds Better With You,Soon I’ll Be In Cali 2,2013,"Man, I keep it one thousand
Mine is higher than a mountain
Haters just wait for my album
'Cause I feel that it might corral them
Now, I'm so bad that I wrote the damn book
My old hood loves me, shout to Blackwood
First the heads shook and then the hands shook
In my presence, guess I am just that good
And they sook, ""No fair, his hair's long
Looks like he's on heroin, how'd he get on?""
I'm a phenom so use your melon
I wipe the floor with you 'til the smell's gone
Smoking that fresh lawn
Kill your whole buzz and then yawn
All CP and your soul needs me
So I'm here, Mr. Alldeezy, go

Ooh, baby, I feel right
The music sounds better with you
Love might bring us back together

Man, I keep it one trillion
Hotter than a fucking Brazilian
Watch the throne my bum's sitting in
I'm not like you, I'm much different
I'm Prince Charles, maybe a little Manson
My appearance may be a little Hansen
Tryna be in a mansion, real accent
Work hard and your dreams will happen
I'm still lappin' dudes in the rat race
Writing these raps in my bat cave
Now tell me how my goddamn sack tastes
I just want stacks like pancakes
Uh, what the hell should I tell them?
When do I relent? Seldom
Tryna make good songs and sell them
Hipsters rhyme better, hmm, you're welcome

Ooh, baby, I feel right
The music sounds better with you
Love might bring us back together

And I'm back for the third time
And a motor on in the turbine
A lot of people that I've heard rhyme
But really I prefer mine and
I write like this in a deep sleep
And you all talk gas like BP
And I bought your bogus CD
I'm just glad that I kept my receipt
See, '90s clothes are my favourite
But my flows are not that dated
And the hate from afar don't say shit
'Bout to take it, I'm impatient
I'll take the win and take losses
Go spark a leaf or blaze forest
And all the eyes stay on us
Take off like my nickname's Qantas

Ooh, baby, I feel right
The music sounds better with you
Love might bring us back together
I feel so good, I feel right
The music sounds better with you",https://genius.com/Allday-music-sounds-better-with-you-lyrics

Nothing on my mind at all
Nothing on my mind at all
Nothing on my mind at all
Nothing on my mind at all

They told me the dumbest players and expect the match to be fair
Is it the school that matters or the lessons that they teach there?
They found it funny when I told these lesser cats to beware
I'm the only that's laughing, man, I guess you had to be there
Stay on your mind like an oven that's been left on
Like finger thread counts, well I ain't nothing to be slept on
I hear a lot of songs where motherfuckers put their best on
But it's all smoke and mirrors so there's nothing to reflect on
I just got up, it's been an awful long day
I say some stuff that make them duck like I was Gordon Bombay
All I need's a beat and someone to record what I say
And enough people to hear and take it all the wrong way
Yeah I'm coming, I'm fucking coming, I got more on the way
But recordings and J, they wondering, what more can I say?
Got the highest score in the game and it ain't boring to play
Sun is just coming up, why would I call it a day?

Nothing on my mind at all
Nothing on my mind at all
Nothing on my mind at all
Nothing on my mind at all

I got shingles right now and I'm real sweaty
My eyes feel heavy but skills are still plenty
Do anything at all guys' will envy
I guess they're not prepared for my villainy
I guess it's in my blood like capillary
Young buck but I never suck, call me Hillary
Honest to God, your moniker should be Monica
I'm chill as a yeti but my buzz is getting hotter-er
Don't be a grammar Nazi, check the thermometer
It's fired up, let me light up like Hanukkah
'Til half the world is twisted like Oliver
But you got verbal Bali belly, that's cholera
Your girl probably like Schapelle Corby
While my girl's body catching felonies
I'm Allday, like a train in the morning
There's no space in it, don't get it spelled wrongly

Walked up in the city without a place to stay
Made some mistakes but hey, I’m on my ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
This ain’t my power trying to maintain haters in the race
I set the pace, fuck a paper chase, I’m slaying
Fuck money, fuck life, fuck things, Wednesday, hump
Muumuu get away, I'mma kill my feng shui, uh
Took the hate, turned and lit a fire inside with it
Now I stop to smell the roses, the violets
And I’m a bit concerned 'bout the life they live
All this talk about me while I’m rolling like the cyclists
And I don’t need no gossip for a dollar of excitement
If you want the treasure
Better board the pirate ship, I've never been
An upper or a downer, nor a lover of the powder

When I see it, that I do it, watch me get it, uh

Forget my wretched past, here's where my story starts
Not the funny rhyme, minus the boring parts
And I am not Notorious or Tupac Shakur enough for ya
Just note me 'fore beating all odds and holding us
Nice for a foreign I'm not, nice for anyone
Anyway, you should get informed
Boy, call the Pentagon, baby, of desert storm
Raised in the Shaquille era, blocking up the door
Getting measured by the millimetre, stealing my mum's Celica
Puffing that world pina, skidding the hills of summer
Regular thrill-seeker, I will be here
Don't even care, though, for comparisons
So play me like Nintendo, get the memo
I invade the polyonic, vote for Pedro
So you ask me, will I give up? And my response is N-O
Now talk is strictly off the record
Only want what I have earned upon my merit
Come and get it like

Put them down on bare sheets
To North–South and West–East
Every which way your head needs
That's the compass to next week
Taking it day by day, minutes to next, I ache, I ache
Stories spread 'til the grape vine breaks
What poor branch is gonna take my weight?
Make wine while the sun shines
When the wind chimes, ring sometimes
And her words are really just lines
In a windstorm from a past life
In the TV show you don't watch now
Marks you'd rather have washed out
'Cause you fill it all the way up round

Twice as much for half the effort
Love rollercoaster, Funkadelic
I say ""Fuck it all, like, what's the use?""
Fuck the lies, I don't want the truth

Days in with the blind shark did Gustav make fine art
With those gold flakes, all shined up

And oh, you're afraid of poison but nothing seems important

Even Frankie can't save ya, save ya
Just savour the flavour, flavour, I'll process for later, later

ARTIE: It was a cone-shaped craft about 15 feet long, with an air speed of, oh, I'd estimate mach 12. They kidnapped and stripped me, examined me briefly, returned my clothes, and dropped me here.""
: Now back to Sick, Sad World.""

Got a fistful of dreams
Tryna trade that for a fistful of cream
Pause, cash rules every little thing
Wu-Tang taught me as a young bitter teen
See, now I am a young spitting king
If you disagree then come intervene
Buzz, I’m going through your stuff
I work real hard, I can never do enough
Doom 95, I Duke Nukem up
Was a mutant in the sewer as a teen screwing up
Now we’re doing us, looking through the past
Had a long night, now the light's luminous
Squintin', I'm the rhyming Tim Winton
All the fit women like what I’m spittin'
They say it's great, thinking it's Britain
I kill every track, don’t think it's different

I won’t give you no instructions for your bottoms
See I fear that you don’t know how to shake it
Yet you know the Macarena and the Nutbush is your thing
But arse-shaking, you don’t need to
Just quit leaning on the wall like the fucking Tower of Pisa

Aha, you know my Steelo
I goes in like a Steve Nash free-throw
He’s that kid always talking 'bout weed smoke
No L's make Elmo to a emo
See those girls so I tell them, ""G-O""
Push your tushy like a fatty with a remote
We know nothing 'bout saving the whole world
I make songs, don’t call me no hero
Oh well, I’ll be that if you need though
Girls say I’m like a less hot Leo
Dad says I’m like a less smart him
Retards say I’m like a less smart them
Maybe 'cause I smoke those fresh gardens
And excuse my French, I mean I beg pardon
You escargot taste excellent
Tryna wee on me, better guess again
(Hey, hey, hey)

In a dream that never ends
I don’t give a F, my 'F''s for friends
I'm Tom, so why am I in Special Ed?
'Cause all my assignments say 'F' in red
But fortune favours all the hairless heads
Never did shit for the hesitant
I never did shit but go on MSN
Hitting on girls I wouldn't ever get
Hey babe, yeah, back in my heyday
I would say, ""Hey"", they’d be all like, ""Hey, wait, got to go""
Way late, trying to be Ray J
Now I get way laid out of my pay grade
Everything grade-A, back in like Grade 8
I was on play dates blowing my mayonnaise
Eat my shorts, young El Barto
Rap for peanuts so you get nutso
Let's go

I won’t give you no instructions for your bottoms
See I fear that you don’t know how to shake it
Yet you know the Macarena and the Nutbush is your thing
But arse-shaking, you don’t need to
Just quit leaning on the wall like the fucking Tower of Pisa

Man, fuck you all
I got it on lock like a bathroom stall
Whoa, funny how much you talk
But you're missing bits out like one, two, four
Lol, quit climbing my lolcano
Before I spaz out drinking old draino
My head spins around like a tornado
And my eyes roll back in a full K.O
That's Allday, better check his pulse, ay bro?
I'm already in heaven with a gold halo
Got pretty hair like Samson, man
But my strength is in my handgun, man
Damn, every song's an anthem, man
Diet of Oreos and Jameson
Bickies and whiskies, that's sickly
How long could I really be living?

I won’t give you no instructions for your bottoms
See I fear that you don’t know how to shake it
Yet you know the Macarena and the Nutbush is your thing

I could take you to somewhere faraway that I know

Uh, wake up in the morning, gotta thank God
I got a pretty blonde girl in a tank top
And she'll do almost anything to please me
She's fine but I swear my love's blind like Stevie
And I party with my friends while the sun's up
And we haven't slept yet, nah, my eyes can't shut
I listen to The Cure trying to find one
Thinking about the worst shit that I've done
And she just wanna fuck with the lights on
And I just wanna become an icon
But those who aren't here, we cry for 'em
Best thing to do is live a good life for 'em
I do it 'cause my mum needs a holiday
Trying to get her god damn mortgage paid
And maybe get myself in the hall of fame
I keep rolling the dice, it'll roll my way

Dance to rock and roll with your mother in a rundown place in the forest, uh, uh
Dance to rock and roll with your father in a rundown place in the forest
And I say, I could take you to somewhere faraway that I know
I could take you to somewhere faraway that I know

You may call me crazy but some say
You need a few nuts to make a sundae
I don't have two chains, I don't have one chain
I just wanna live the good life like Kanye
And I'm so damn close I can feel the lights
Beaming down on me, the people's eyes
Fuck the fame, I just want a fonder life
But I'm so far away from my mum's advice
She said I treat girls like commodities
So now I treat my girl to a lot of things
Now I treat myself to a little grin
Every time I get a little wind in my brittle wings
I do it 'cause my Vans need replacing
I do it 'cause my fans keep relating
I do it for the neighbourhood kids
Good kids in a place where nothing good lives

Dance to rock and roll with your mother in a rundown place in the forest
Dance to rock and roll with your father in a rundown place in the forest

I did them shots already, every kind of pill popped already
Been to mountain tops and valleys, all messy, Mentos and Pepsi
Woke up so far from anything with my head feeling awful heavy

By now, I'd be sleazing around trying to take someone home. And then I heard that same voice I heard . It said, ""Turn around"". I go, ""What?"" I said, ""You crazy?"" I go, ""Oh, no"" and I started shaking, man. I turned around and I saw demons in this club, man. Like evil spirits, mate, inside this nightclub. Demons, with my naked eyes, man.

Always fucking 'round with my head, too
Just be sorry, at least pretend to

Do some drugs, become a famous rapper
Blow up and solve your problems that's misconception
I just miss the honesty, don't miss rejection, no

Yeah she moved to Melbourne to fuck lil gremlin
Who am I to not fuck that girl then?
Lyrics for ourselves, no-one else then
Freestyles in the car, me and Nelson, like
Quoting Big L on the way to Reynella to battle anybody
Never pursuing the loot, look up to guru
A moment of truth, like one day I'll do music too
Now I'm responsible for my happiness
But I'm irresponsible at times
You don't know how to drive
'Til you hit obstacles skid off and survive
Mum used to say we're like the Brady Bunch
But there's way too much pill-popping and wine
These memories just won't cross at the lights
They stay jaywalking on my mind, when you say

You say it's your time
Codeine seventeen, eighteen won't die
Nineteen came and went and it was all worthwhile
If we only feel this way for one more night
Ay, ay, ay, one more night
Ay, ay, ay, one more night
Ay, ay, ay, one more night
If we only feel this way for one more night

Rep the same ones that's tatted on me
The classic nights we had with tragic money
Said we'll die exploring before we settle
Some drift away, you know it's continental
We feared it changing now we feel it changing
And I hate that resignation like this shit is fated
I know time is money and we spend it wasted
Then it's over in a blink, blink, indication
Usually I'm tongue sucking high
Or stuck inside, too depressed to phone
Things I ingest to cope
With folks at openings of envelopes
Just to pull out my package
Maybe she could love a cheater like Sheryl Crow
And my girl's vain like varicose
But her pussy wetter than Gyarados
Used to hang out the window
Coming up Shepherd's Hill Road in the dark
In our first cars with our first loves
Before they left us with broken hearts
But I don't long for those days past
Don't fuck with this here
Might be cruel,, might be cool
But we're always sincere

You say it's your time
Codeine seventeen, eighteen won't die
Nineteen came and went and it was all worthwhile
If we only feel this way for one more night
Ay, ay, ay, one more night
Ay, ay, ay, one more night
Ay, ay, ay, one more night
If we only feel this way for one more night",https://genius.com/Allday-codeine-17-lyrics

Beanies on in the winter

Patience keep getting thinner
(I think we're all growing up now)
I'm still the same boy somewhere in there
From back in the days in the hills
Where my best friend was my dealer, yeah

Now I'm back in black, yeah, always black
Like AC/DC, pray for some of what they had
Pray my nanna's there when I step out of a cab
You know I gotta rap, my calling ain't calling back
Yeah, all these rappers stay talkin'
That's Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen

I'm the second shooter like Klay Thompson

Very me, no variations (First light)
I gave it all, I never gave in, oh
Plus I'm always fuckin', never dating, yeah
Keep it underground like cellars and basements
And there ain't no celebrations yet
My first album went wood like a timber floor
Instead of doing them, I'm just doing me a little more (Ooh)
Tell 'em, broke ain't broken 'til you give it up (Ooh)
Money ain't shit if your spirit poor
Let my spirit soar,
 and the spirits pour
I love these clothes, but it's all just material
So much fun it feels like love, but it's really not
Nights like this, and it's all too familiar

Does it feel like you're falling?

Going under deeper
Trying hard to reach you
I don't talk too much, don't need to
It's my face they wanna see there (These days)
Got her hotel in my notes, honey
Said I wouldn't recognise her wearing clothes, honey
But she wouldn't fuck me as a nobody (Yeah, I know that's true)
And that thought is kind of sobering (Not enough though)
And if I had my time over, I'd do the same things again twice over
Mixed my potion and I'm floating, and I will fly
Through the wall like an apparition so you might notice
I'll sit there waiting for the moon to rise
At the park watching good people and human life
I don't wish for it, I know it will soon arrive
I'm not sure what this hole is I grew inside

I'm reaching through the night to you
But this dimension isn't mine
I'm reaching through the night to you

Some things you don't want to know
Could you sell me some hope?

We weren't supposed to ever leave
70% of me is Cheetos and Monster Energy
That's some white trash chemistry
Nurse ratchet, sick mentally
Over the cuckoo's nest in a F18
On the pew I was praying for better things
All those Gucci denim dreams
I think that girl is cute, but she's properly basic
Can't pinpoint why she wants to be famous
Come out from there, don't crawl in these spaces
Smoke more weed when the weed got me anxious
I'll sit at the park feeling miserable
'Til the good people go home to be in the warm
And I thought you saw me but I'm invisible
Spiritual, ethereal, nothing that you'd feel at all

Then you're here, out of the smoke
And I don't believe what I've heard
And I'm healed from your will, yeah
And your powers are real, yeah
And my blood, congealed, yeah
And my stitches, unsealed, yeah

Unstoppable in motion, oh-oh
She hangs her arms around my neck

Were you late to blossom? How is it waiting?
Your indignation, I saw you from the start
Ate one too many, spewed in the lilies
You think you're clever, no, baby, you're just smart
But I won't drown to drag you out
Whatever, I could be the one
Caught in the generation, doing what we saw
Something weird that we saw on the TV screen
Me watching your pupils expand like a chia seed
Are you needing saving, baby? I can't be your deity
I worked too hard to make things flow evenly
It's me and my animals like Ace Ventura
Your Coca-Cola areola, tastes like sugar
You pop out to meet a strange guy on the corner
I'm gone

Crazy, no words can explain the lack of fucks I give
These rappers need to suck my dick as dry as the Sahara is
I got bars like Xanax dealers, all my friends are pharmacists
Caterpillars in my hypothalamus, they burrowing

You talk but don't listen, I'm going through some weird shit
You move to the rhythm of the city that we live in

Woah, I told you I ain't no saint
But you wouldn't listen, no
You wouldn't hear me, no

You must be out your coconut, going through my phone and stuff
Young, drunk Australian, I'm going Russell Crowe on ya
You say I'm a chauvinist, I say, ""Well, whose show is this?""
You know where the door is at, or do I need to show you it?
I became a monster somewhere, I'm retracing my steps
Studio, bad hoe bedroom, studio, well, I'm just changing, I guess
Cops used to stop me and say, ""I need your name and address""
I would say ""Usain Bolt"", then I gave it the legs

I don't get no happiness from their failures
I really wish them the best in this game here
I got all my own stress and these payslips
I don't get any rest, I'm awake all the time
In my room pacing like Indiana
I need Rihanna or somebody really similar
I've been off the drugs a while, I'm thinking clearer
I think I'm worse when I'm sober, baby, text my dealer

You're like my lady, but you're not ladylike
Smoking hazy until we get McGrady eye

Talladega Nights
Swerving through lanes on the way to mine

Angel of death in a boarded-up town

She drop it low to stay warm, she got nothing on
North Melbourne at a party on something strong
In the studio, tryna make a summer song
But winter's dark and long and all the colour's gone
Do you dream in Kodachrome? (Drinking)
We deal with shit that no-one knows (No-one knows)
Blow it 'til we overblown, yeah, dose 'til we overdose
Wearin' all black, rest in peace, Jonah Lomu

On a tram with the junkies sitting on it

Been trippin' on, trippin' on, trippin' on, trippin' on you

Cheap wine for the lost souls
Don't wait, drank it straight from the bottle
Okay, Swede 'em all like Stockholm
This is our city, not yours
Medication for your trepidation, yeah
Love was murdered by our generation
We're so isolated and the night is young
We could die waiting for our time to come
So lose yourself, but not too much
If there are lies, it's not true love
Everybody suing us for doing us
Everybody doing us for doing us
So fuck are y'all saying? Fuck are y'all taking?
They'll go to your parties, drink your liquor, steal your pharmies

They're trippin' on, trippin' on, trippin' on, trippin' on you

We go together like chips and seagulls
In the sand with rubbish and needles
We were in her vehicle driving across the night
That was right before I lost my mind
She told me, ""Don't stress so much""
Where there's smoke there's stoners
Homie, if I'm dying, I better be overdosing

If I'm tripping, then say I'm tripping

Thunder cracking, Melbourne city shit, long-ass winters here

B-ball dreams, 6:00am bucketing
Head shaved, no-one fucked with me
You know they get hotter when you break their heart
If they don't, you break it way too hard
Move on quick like a racing car, stay popping champagne for ya
Podium first place for ya, I'm sorry for the way we are

Switch sides, switch sides
Living every day to the fullest, never switch sides

No hit records on my demo, no talent, this is effort
Sculpting stone like Donatello of the clouds, visionary
Ray of light, ray of light, found myself out in the desert
Arizona sky like neon Nerds, system filled with venom
But if that’s their disses for me, I do not feel disrespected
I just feel young, wealthy, kind of handsome, independent
Did I mention independent? Casper’s t-shirt, Independent
Small labels with the method, whole team did this together
Oh no, oh no, they had to be a hassle
I got bigger fishes, killer whales, I know they’re really mammals
People’s morals getting lost, it's too much for me to handle
I don’t take these hoes to dinner, I would rather eat a barrel

I'm skidding, I'm skidding through these streets
With my whole team squished into the seats
That's my old whip, kept it when I signed the deal
That's my new girl, think this one might be real
Guess I say that, I guess I say that every time
I would hate to have to settle, I need to get this right
On Bell Street, going past the cemetery
Don’t bury me there, heaven help me
Ooh, having panic attacks, this stress ain't healthy
Blue like repping Chelsea, go tell them girls, ""Leave""
But I’m India like New Delhi, the new Delly, I'll cross you up
Crossed with Nelly and you always find some summer
No matter what the month; Goulding like Ellie
But I'll make a bad boyfriend like Oscar Pistorius

Swear I fucked you right, that's what you told me then
We were supposed to die before we folded in
That's my bad, I'm apolog'in
Bringing old shit up, fuckin' historian
Outer space in your heart, I'm orbitin'
You know that I'll be back like that Austrian
I know there is gaps in what you told to him
Does he know you got it tatted on your body then?

When you would do anything in the backseat
This my city and I know all the back streets
You, cars, M.D., shows, raps, beats
Crew, Mum, Dad, Xannies, hopes, plans, dreams

If I spill my blood, would you love me then?

If I spill my blood for you
If I spill my blood, would you love me then?

You love to show me that you've got your life together
I'm happy for you, baby, but you don't got to be so mean
Just because I do drugs and my friends are reckless
It doesn't mean I'm evil all of a sudden, I'm just lonely
And summer sucks this year
Had a lot of goals I didn't touch this year
Pretty much doing drugs, trying to fuck this year
I'm not proud of the man I've become this year

Might find me in the kitchen of his big apartment
Spilling my blood all over his floor
Can't believe that the doctor delivered this monster
The moment I was born, should've choked me with the cord

It was like around '99 with white wine in hand
Dancing silhouettes, blue Skyline
Neighbours had that Tuesday/Thursday night choir
I'd go to bed early, my bedroom was right by it
Singing ""
Gloria
 in excelsis Deo"", sure enough
Angels came to comfort us
And we rode on wings through all of it
Our parents used to fight, Dad moved out of home
And he just moved five houses down the road
Said he don't know how to cope through a cloud of smoke
But he was just depressed and scared, now I know
My eyes glazed over
That's when my cousin Emma played me Dr. Dre in the car
Things changed forever, me and rap been through it all
But we stay together since buffet Pizza Hut b-day dinners
When they had more locations
Mum had to work, Grandma basically raised us
Thanks to them we didn't know what pain was
Dec would die on GoldenEye and cry for ages
We was angry at the codeine packs
My brothers shouldn't be seeing that
These things we swore we'd never reenact
Then you grow up and start feeling sad

Through the walls, through the walls of heaven
Through the walls, through the walls of heaven

When my grandpa died, it was a weird feeling
Didn't give a fuck after all these years drinking
So tell me, why these tears dripping?
Maybe we're crying 'cause things should of been different
And death is scary
We're all heading there and we don't get it, really
Then it sings like a sweet Stradivarius
And then they bury us or they spread the dust
Fuck that talk, I wanna talk about summertimes
Nine in a five-seater, drunken nights under skies
Of ultramarine strobe lights in a party I wasn't invited to
We just sat outside, bloody-eyed
Hillary and Enzo were so in love that night
But everyone broke up from those younger times
And got someone else at least a couple times
Can't look at me the same, I'm just some other guy
Well, that's justified, señorita, I feel for you
Said I loved you the second week, it was clearly true
Guess we're both sick, you said, ""I feel it too""
Forever didn't seem so far when you were twenty-two
Fights went right through the walls, tried to look happy
Walk outside, the neighbours wouldn't even look at me
Two days after I turned my album in, I left her
That was one short forever
[Interlude: Allday & 
Mallrat

Through the walls, through the walls of heaven
Through the walls, through the walls of heaven
And the sky was ultramarine

I drink a little too much, too much
You know I'm cutting down since you asked
You smoke a little too much and lose touch
I know you're cutting down soon as school starts (Yeah)

Well, things are getting heavy like a bazooka
Things are getting heavy, but we got through it

I'm sorry, I had no idea

It's Friday, what could go wrong?
A couple drinks, now we're in motion
We had some problems, baby, life goes on
You either stick together or you float on
I play my songs in a rum-soaked bar
Your friends tell you that I ain't no star
I can't turn around, I've come so far
Don't let the lonely feelings undo us

When you go to a party on a train and a bus
And you won’t reply, it puts an ache in my heart
We’re a first edition, no replacing these parts
You were never on hold, I was straight from the start
But I be holding you to silly standards
You don't wanna leave me here abandoned

But I'm the first to admit (Admit, yeah, baby)

Remembering the days when I was fed on ramen
I smoke too much weed, sometimes I forget to function
I don’t remember when we even left the function
I found a bag of mushrooms in my friend's apartment
Ate like fifty, now I'm making friends with Martians
I’m drinking whiskey like a cowboy
And I'm slick as Draco Malfoy
Oh, that's Allday, yeah, that's our boy
Oh, you hate? You just sad, boy

When I hop out the shower, she fresh like citrus
I've been reading books that don't have pictures
I've been up and down, got motion sickness
Think I'm really done digging myself ditches
Oh, watch what you say to yourself
Because those words become spells
And those spells make it a dark world (I say)

I’m living my best life ’til the next life
Like I always said I would, they always told me, ""Yeah, right""
Turning nothing into something, that's the best life

Got cars you never drive you leave in empty houses?

Yeah, had a hole in my heart like a doughnut (Bam)
I'm taking it slow 'til it's sewn up
Might eat a salad for a meal, I'm a grown-up
I don't really smoke no more, I gotta focus
Just minding my business, mind yours
'Til I'm rich and sad, suicide doors
I got people to provide for
No time off

But it's the best life 'til the next life
Like I always said I would, they always told me, ""Yeah, right""
Turning nothing into something, that's the best life
My best life, I'm living my best life
Best life 'til the next life
Like I always said I would, they always told me, ""Yeah, right""
Turning nothing into something, that's the best life
My best life, I'm living my best life",https://genius.com/Allday-best-life-lyrics
Don’t Wanna Push You Away Anymore,Starry Night Over the Phone,2019,"[Verse 1: Allday & 
sampled male voice
]
You kissed me Monday just as peak hour started
I've kept my memories of you locked and guarded
You were glowing red in the brake lights
Do you recall? We had the one mug
We could both drink, just not both at once
Can hold my liquor but I could never swallow my pride
Watch out, man, we're almost there

I wanna stay with you tonight
Don't wanna push you away no more
Between the dark hills and the sky
Don't wanna push you away

You say you're different but it's just your address
Well, I've been changing but it is a challenge
Backyard magic moving me with your mind
Do you recall? I spent all my pay
On a hotel, the view wasn't great
Just a brick wall but the walls are coming down this time
You'll find

I wanna stay with you tonight
Don't wanna push you away no more
Between the dark hills and the sky
Don't wanna push you away

Now that you know that things fall down sometimes
You will regrow and I will be by your side
Now that I know there is no better friend
I will be slow and I will be yours again

I wanna stay with you tonight
Don't wanna push you away no more
Between the dark hills and the sky
Don't wanna push you away
I wanna stay with you tonight
Don't wanna push you away no more
Between the dark hills and the sky
Don't wanna push you away",https://genius.com/Allday-dont-wanna-push-you-away-anymore-lyrics
"If Not Now, When?",Starry Night Over the Phone,2019,"Holding on to something
Overseas, all the vehicles
I never wanna go back
I'll never wanna be alone
I never wanna know this
So tell me it's all wrong

Yeah, my grandmother always said that ""Much wants more""
That means no matter how much you got, you just want more
I got my first gold plaque, I was happy for a second
Then I started thinking of my next one
I guess the key is press on, the car was hot as 
Szechuan
Driving in a lemon like my name was Ayrton
At Double Dragon restaurant,
 a city somewhere else in time
I leave clues for those looking, they are there to find
But it’s a world where the genuine are left behind
The cold-blooded ones, they know how to get their shine
A snake eats its tail, a baby enters as an elder leaves
Sail in ships and your tears made the seven seas
I spit the melodies and words that are sent to me
Teeth yellowy, mouth like a lemon tree
Just a soul on a trip but we didn’t pack
Just a soul in a body that I’m giving back

I say if not now, when?
Took you for granted back then
My grandma used to say
""Don’t put off 'til tomorrow what you could do today""
Been away now for a month of Sundays
When I see you again, it’s a party
Stuff a dragon head, hang it in the hallway
Never forget, we came a long way

Living on borrowed time, can I have an extension?
Then God sent me back down, that’s astral rejection
I’ve seen drugs ruin everything, that's family convention
Yeah, I know I’m walking with an angel's protection
I told her, ""I’m not Catholic, but 
I know my angels""
She said, 
""I’m not beautiful, but I know my angles""
These loves immortalised in all the songs I write
Thanks for the inspiration, even though it wasn’t right
Over waves to Australia on a Qantas flight
I was on the wave of doubt that I often ride
Far from home, since I cut back, it’s another zone
Y'all rappers need to cut back before your money's blown
Call the label on the money phone, ask 'em for another loan
And they hung up the phone
Did it without a cosign, but they steal my essence
My mortgage says 'Tom', I couldn't ring my parents
Hope your dreams come true, like there’s a genie present
You won't know what you wished for until you get it
Fame’s a hot seat, don’t let your blood boil
I keep my heart in the fridge, don’t let my heart spoil
I saw a flower grow up from the hard soil
These rappers tell you leave your girl 'cause they aren’t loyal
And trade her pancake arse for a bubble butt
All the Xans and 
double cups, they got you muddled up
You’ll end up alone, chasing another rush
Pussy and drugs, a double dragon that’s hard to snuff
I stay with the ones who were there for me
I know there’s crocs in the water like the Territory
I know there’s good people 'round everywhere, surely
But sometimes it just feels like 'Where’s Wally?'
I couldn’t get it through my thick Irish head
That I deserve happiness, but last night I said

I say if not now, when?
Took you for granted back then
My grandma used to say
""Don’t put off 'til tomorrow what you could do today""
Been away now for a month of Sundays
When I see you again, it’s a party
Stuff a dragon head, hang it in the hallway
Never forget, we came a long way",https://genius.com/Allday-if-not-now-when-lyrics
Lungs,Starry Night Over the Phone,2019,"I was Nemo, I was in the fucking deep blue
You see through the facade, the facade is see through
I didn't watch the film but I saw the preview
I got the gist, I was texting, I was tryna reach you
You don't want no problems with the ghouls and goblins
Don't sign the documents, you know there's other options
I'll be poeticating when they're long forgotten
Had to buy some Gosha when I got the dosh in
Diamante earrings, that's the ear infection drip
Most wanted at the mall, you know I'd steal to get that tick
Spinning lies to women, I can make you dizzy from that shit
I'll do anything once just to experience that shit

(Oh-ah, oh-ah) These rappers fuckin' with your brain
(Oh-ah, oh-ah) Talking things they hardly take
(Oh-ah, oh-ah) And I have no one to blame
But you're dressed pretty nice to be muddying my name

And my brother's still smoking
His lungs are gonna be black
And the world is exploding
But I don't worry about that
When I'm flying over mountains
Flying over trees
When I'm flying over Brunswick
Checking on my G's

I was Nemo, brain was cloudy like a miso
You were pearly, shining like a Palomino (Shining, shining, shining)
We didn't have rich parents, didn't have a cheat code
We know how to scheme though, it was me and Peezo
Road to El Dorado, now with mi hermanos
Chinks in my armour, but they never come close
The jack of hearts is gung-ho and the queen is cutthroat
Just come to the art show, you won't see the brushstrokes (Ayy)
Fuck her in the shower with her face against the glass
Takes me back like a DeLorean, escaping to the past
Takes me back to Adelaide, where the haze don't block the stars
Where the teachers said, ""Watch him
'Cause he's angry, but he's smart""

(Oh-ah, oh-ah) Yeah I beg the orange sky
(Oh-ah, oh-ah) Would you send another rhyme
(Oh-ah, oh-ah) For the young and traumatised?
Southern Comfort, bikie weed, for the trouble on your mind

And my brother's still smoking
His lungs are gonna be black
And the world is exploding
But I don't worry about that
When I'm flying over mountains
Flying over trees
When I'm flying over Adelaide
Checking on my G's

That pizza shop had Italian tomatoes
Spent too much on those, now that shop's closed

And I got way past the concerned stage
Reverse Pinocchio, I saw you turn fake
All that namedropping, it just turns me off like Earth Day

How many likes until you feel like you are good enough?
How long could you look at your phone before you call it off?
Plastic is forever and it’s always washing up
I should probably say something when I go through stuff
Got some real good friends I haven’t spoke to much
I’ve been busy blowing up, I can't let this moment pass
And when I sell a million, maybe that will fill the hole in us

Fight music in the car with neons on
Orange like Vietnam,
 fighting our deal was
Now me and my boys driving through town in three or four
P-plater cars, awaken demons, noise from the exhaust
Lost hours, save it for the horse power in need of course
We bow to live forever, think we'll never see the morgue
Smoking on this fucking you know
On some nights when the starlight is just right
But on this one night, we everyone dry
I need some girls to sort my shit out
Hormones and cyclones
On these nights, it's like a big town, less of a city
Up at Windy, see the lights are pretty
My dealer isn't picking up, this night is dying quickly
My friend lights a ciggy
Car pulls up beside us, they don't like us really

But sorry, I don’t want to go home

Half in love and all the way proud
And all the way proud, girl
Owe you better now, owe you better now, I owe you better
Sending blessings, but sorry, I don’t wanna go home
Sending blessings, but sorry, I don’t wanna go home
Sending blessings, but sorry, I don’t wanna go home
Sending blessings, but sorry, I don’t wanna go home

I only make up 'cause you’re worth it
I don’t know where we learnt it
You say you’re innocent, I haven’t heard the verdict
The memory of her is murdered, don’t forget it, I’m learning
Ask me why we started diverging
I’m tryna be the one to buy everything, I'd fucking die for this
Am I hurting you while taking over?
About to have a crazy moment, Grandad's RSL nights on the mic
Call you all names for the price of a pint
Banned from the place trying to fight for the right
But time ran out, time does that, you know, you know
Yeah, I guess, I guess I got one chance, don't fuck up
Count on me like I’m ticking
Audemars don’t bother us, I’ve got a phone
I’m thinking of Porches, two doors, foursomes, six-strings
We ate hearty, your ten body, twelve texts from you
My blessings, girl

Half in love and all the way proud, girl
Are you better now? Are you better now?
I owe you better
Sending blessings, but sorry, I don’t wanna go home
Sending blessings, but sorry, I don’t wanna go home
Sending blessings, but sorry, I don’t wanna go home
Sending blessings, but sorry, I don’t wanna go home

You see I think about you all the time at the wrong time
When it's grind time, it's love line, see the guidelines
You could flatline when you ain't got nine lives
Coming from the blindside back to the Bapes
And the rat race, got a fortnight backspace?
When the trap fake not a tad too late, the keys to the valet
This a short stay, not a vacay
I’ve got a plane to catch, no strings attached, with no stress
Can I do a little more, little less when I get off the tour?
Bought up the store, making you the best dressed
‘Bout to kill this rap game, all I need is a fraction
Activated by your actions when you act like this fame
That I’m trying to gain in that closed up grasp
And see we can meet up sometimes
You can get a beat up sometimes
Girl, you the leader of the line, no chick can come close
To what we both of us know is so hard to define
Can I sip Jack with the tail back?
When I hop on the stage, when they say 3 killed that
Can you feel that? Well, baby, maybe we can make it
We just take it where we take it and we chill just until that
It's all blessings

I guess this year was getting better, same time as the Ferris wheel
Started working same time too, though they said it never will
Told my boy one day, I'ma be on wax
Underground classic, dreams of a hood rat
Then when Al came through with the contract
Work tried to call me, but I never called back
Didn’t really smoke, maybe some contact
Maybe some codeine, it’s hard to just stop that
I did get a little Donna Karen, I did do a whole lot of rapping
Took it to the country with Charlie
Sorry if I missed your call or I didn’t get your email back
I’ve been trying to pop retail tags, you know how it is
But it’s still you, it’s you, it’s you
But it is still you, it's you, it's you, it's you, it's you",https://genius.com/Allday-blessings-lyrics
Clouds,Startup Cult,2014,"Pour it out, holy water, I'm the altar
Would you alter or just fall from grace?
The choice is yours to make
In a world full of wolves and snakes
Poison apples and spoiled grapes
Take caution and walk with haste
And you may make it one more day

Don't make it so complex, I need to spend forever on this
Wishing upon these bright comets and I always get what I wish
And I been here doing just what I wanted
Roof leak like go off and on
No costume, no Comic-Con shirt
Off all the time like Jim Morrison, hotel room, drinking heavy
I'm more than fine, don't be forgetting
Most of your girls probably obsessing
Always on road, call me Pirelli, screech
Who drive the fastest? So hard, this my catharsis
Straight out in minus glasses, don't bother asking if I'm injustice

Don't worry about me, don't worry about me
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine
I said don't worry about me, don't worry about me
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine
Unless I fall from the clouds
Unless I fall from the clouds, from the clouds

I need to step this out, oh Lord, oh Lord
Just tell me if you're down, oh Lord, oh Lord

Don't make it so complex, I need to spend forever on this
Green lines talking about concepts
Small minds get jealous and bitch
I let my phone out, another favour
Who the fuck it look like, Mother Teresa?
My wall's so thick, call up the neighbour
Same old me, man, nothing changes
I'm at the mall thinking up rhymes
Talking to yours, thinking she mine
Say one word, she literally mime
I fuck her in the store, she giving me eyes
Do everything for energy besides sleep
Don't see no one here besides me
And I'm here to find, not to sightsee
Until they silence me, man

Don't worry about me, don't worry about me
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine
I said don't worry about me, don't worry about me
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine
Unless I fall from the clouds
Unless I fall from the clouds, from the clouds

Aye, yeah
Unless I fall from the clouds, oh, unless I fall
I feel myself so hard it makes me sick",https://genius.com/Allday-clouds-lyrics

I would join it
I would, you should start a cult

Guyana, Guyana, organic banana
Pull up on your shores like the Spanish Armada
Our God is among us, your smell on my jumper
That pussy is sweet, bitch, can I touch it?
Like, bitch, can I touch it? Sorry for swears
Apples and pears, everybody is fed
I change up so much just because you request
I’m sorry I’m faulty and not what I said
I would be, 
I stay north of the river
With all of the scenesters, docs got ’em fitted
Seems like yesterday you would call up and visit
And I was excited you more than delivered
We made it a mess, how else could it happen?
I’m always tied up with my selfish shit rapping
I’m always tied up, I don’t tell you with passion
I feel you, I feel you, I feel you

Now look at all that you made
Before I started calling you names
You didn’t make me wait too long
Didn’t make me wait too long, maybe like one or two days
Now I been walking through flames like Chaka Khan
Know a small part of me really wanna fuck it up
Feels like Christmas, feels like Ramadan, Hanukkah
I know everything is gonna come at once
You’re quick to tell me who fake, who real
Two years I’ve known you, and it’s you still
Everything I build and you send me blue steel
To my phone when I’m far from home, you're my new zeal
Shout out Auckland, when I’m alone, you’re my Stockton
Jerry Sloan to my Ferris wheel when it's rocking at the show
Used to drink goon on the lawn with the moon and the stars
May I say that I feel you, I feel you

I swear I fucking would, I would join it
You know I would

There ain't nothing to worry about with me around
Even though I be running around, feeling down
Feeling bad, feeling sorry for myself, I’ll figure it out
I’m saying you’re my main ingredient baby, I’m in the house
And I know that you been around and trying
You deserve something like a thousand diamonds
You deserve better than me out here lying

Find Me,Startup Cult,2014,"Man, I wonder if I've said it all?
This time, when the record's all done, was it memorable?
You know what the fuck it was
They gonna talk their shit, I'm gonna shrug it off
Coming up, gave a fuck how I come across
Two years ago, when I couldn't take another loss
Somebody better put a end to my winning streak
I'm not hearing 'em, I guess it'll take a lot to offend me, man
Fuck all the bullshit and mystique
I've been telling everything when it's not pretty
I don't mind, all for the trippy for strictly
Tatted on my side boy, if you need a kitty, pink and light
There's no weight where my ex-girls are
Watching my clips, feeling regret feels, huh
In the studio so the rent bill's high
And they tell me, ""Stay real"", I tell 'em, ""Get real high""

Find me, you've been sad for too long
You've been sad for too long, you've been sad for too long
Find me, you've been sad for too long
You've been sad for too long, you've been sad

Find me sitting up for a little buzz
And everybody's here, yeah, we did a bunch, find me
Find me, find me sitting up for a little buzz
And everybody's here, yeah, we did a bunch, find me

""Money over bitches"", is what I'm hearing
Money without love is not appealing
I got too much on my plate, got to spill it in my house
Cracking a blind for you to peer in
And my peers, they're all disappearing now
And the older generations kind of fizzled out
Swear to get up in my space when I'm sitting down
Tryna get a real account, what I'm really 'bout
But I'm only human, staring at my cup
Friends scare, who dared told me that's enough?
I'd probably get 'em kicked out of here in a flash
If the mood strikes, that's how I'm feeling tonight
When I was seventeen, off the Gawler train
Walked in to the show hoping everyone ignored me
Had to win a battle to afford some recording
Didn't know the card but I know I was a sure thing
When I wasn't confident, I was confident
Even when I wasn't competent, I was on some shit
Like I got it, I promise, I'm positive
I was rapping back when Britney was hot as shit
You know the deal, played shows to no-one
I recall the first four kids that showed up
And I bought 'em drinks 'cause it meant so much to me
Saw 'em all recently, they're all grown up
Sorta like my friends and my brothers and the style's
So shitty, people telling me about my own home city
Now put me under lights, man, fuckin' no dimming
Look at what I made of all killer, no feeling like Sum 41
Already I've won, already have fun
Already would've liked, so you know I would die for you
So this is our cult, man
I mixed the Kool-Aid just right for you

Find me, you've been sad for too long
You've been sad for too long, you've been sad for too long
Find me, you've been sad for too long
You've been sad for too long, you've been sad

Let me say

I was on a loan, once a night, taking money
At the motherfucking pizza parlour counter
Doing dishes super quick 'cause I'm tryna run and fight it
Now it's all I had it, what you know about it?
I was dripping in the shower, first train to the city
I would hop on all sodded from the rain when it hit me
I could make it but I hate it missing the Saturday, it's shitty
I'm addicted to these bitches
It's the greatest feeling when I'm in 'em like

My mind in the summer heat, isn't it high?
Summers ago, I was sitting inside
Work and tell girls these ridiculous lies
Summer's ahead and I'm spittin', I'm spittin'
Just look at the pressure that sits in my mind
Seem like a difficult climb, now's like a different time
Nothing forgiven, no, nothing was given
Not giving, not giving, ah, thinking 'bout loss
Thinking 'bout spending out, thinking 'bout cost
Thinking 'bout rejection, not about rocks
Left it for a minute, now I'm digging out moss
Talking 'bout K, and I'm talking 'bout scum
Talking 'bout me, I can never outrun
And I'll never bow down, and wherever I come
I'm a winner right now and I'll tell you how come

My mind in the summer heat, places I'll be
Girls that are trouble keep making a scene
Crumbs on the floor and there's plates in the sink
In my room, lights off, it's midday, it's midday
She's shaking her tushy half-naked, I'm looking
No dream to speak of, I'm chasing some pussy
Why taking my serious, baking me cookies
Boy, are they tasty but really, but really
I don't care about shit
Got a little food and the friends that I'm with
Bet that I'll fuckin' chill where I sit
So why go and make it more complex than it is?
That's it, that's it, pessimistic 'til I turned it around
Made everything switch
Looking like in this life and repetitiveness
Don't tell me what it is, I'm sexting this bitch like ""uh""

I'm worried about like a whole lot of shit
Man, no holding inside
Maybe it's hard to maintain these things
While being as honest as I
While my friends call me up and put their worries on me
No problem, it's fine, baby, you know that I got it
Tell me your dreams, I'm following mine
Walk around town in a two-buck hood
And shit keep falling in line, haha
Yo, it's funny how things change
I'll be laughing all of my life, word to Gandhi
Back when I was starving, but I kept the positive vibes
And bitches love me, bitches love me, dog
I swear that they won't leave me alone
I spend my whole life chasing pussy
Man, it's everything that I know
So this here is what you're made of
Think that I'm gonna need me a clone
To do the foul shit that I came here for
But now I'm thinking I won't

Baby, I got it (Got it, covered, covered, I)
Baby, I got it (Got it, covered, covered, I)
Baby, I got it (Got it, covered, covered, I)
Baby, I got it

Coming to terms with the fact that
Now these bitches want it, now I need honour
Coming to terms with the fact that
If I don't do this proper, I'll be a goner
This is not legacy, this is life or death for me
Like asbestos in the lungs
And I'm not proud of the shit I've done
But I'm proud of the distance I've come
Booze on, then when im hungover lukewarm Arizona
Like Tucson, baby I'm drinking up
Do wrong, I'm sorry for the way I never said sorry
On the days that things were hard
Nostalgia, well, that's so powerful
And it can make bad things turn 'round in full
And I hope it does for you
I sit on the hallway floor, big spiders on the hallway door
Young, feeling way suicidal, that's what I made Allday for
Bring the drinks, 'cause there's always more
And I beg you, por favor
Don't say you love me 'cause I don't need it
Cut that hombre talk

Baby, I got it, baby

When I think of all the ones that were ahead of me
How quickly I overtook 'em
And I can't help thinking this is my destiny
Like Bey, Kelly and the other woman
I could literally rap forever
No, like, I can literally rap forever
Hey, fucking my old girls like it's gonna make you me
But it's more than that
You can copy every move that I make to a tee
But it's more than that
Yeah, it's more than that

This one's for the Hills to the Bay
This one is for the hometown pride
Tonight, tonight

This is a scumbag story, my whole heart
Lives in Blackwood, where the apex a Coles park
My humble start, blunts that we rolled up
View of the city, first pulser in a Pulsar
Was it a Pintara dreaming of a Impala?
Taming of the shrew, these formal suits are a thin armour
And a suit Ferrari, feeling all super starry
The days are warm the girls love me and my crew is an army
Ha, I've been there, tell I've felt the future tugging
I've seen the dukes of nothing in the cars zooming past me
Even a few that's nasty, I've copped a few cherries
I've popped a few of my own, some say it's too many
I say it's just enough, I had my first kiss
First tag, first fight, first spit shirtless
First fuck, first drink, first rap verses
All in my hometown where the birds sing

This one's not for going away
This one's for the Hills to the Bay
This one is for the hometown pride
Tonight, tonight

See, it's a bit colder where I came from
Especially in the foggy mornings trying to stay warm
Especially walking home with a crayon
'Til everything here got my name on
""What do you write, bro?""
Screaming Koo-Wee across the valley then drop the bally
Some minor crimes and hit a party up, it's for the tally
Hoes have all be ordering Hungry's and quarter-baggies in my head
Yeah, roll with fatties and we're rolling fatties
Blow it skywards, fuck the climate and fuck assignments
Without a sense of time or motion and there's nothing like it
Mother asks you your career, you say, ""Undecided""
She's like, ""I never get to see you since you started driving""
And all you wanna do is fucking die young
And stay pretty forever, R.I.P to friends we lost, my eyes run
Thinking back to the day I got the call
And my focus is the moment won't forget
Not at all, it's for you

This one's not for going away
This one's for the Hills to the Bay
This one is for the hometown pride
Tonight, tonight

Instant classic shit
If I knew the difference, I'd have gone make all my lyrics
I would've had a fit. From bathroom cabinets
To fast lane weaving through the traffic
It was always my belief and I'm no Catholic
So fuck it, I'm a Maverick
In the City of Churches, crystal heads, not sucking amethyst
When other guys are tweaking, my demons try appearing
But I'm not tryna feed 'em, so I decide I'm leaving
But I couldn't find a reason so I focus on my hobbies
Started blowing up like pressure mines
Hoping I'll tread softly but I'll never
'Cause they're home and they hope I know they're watching
But it's so exhausting, the recording shows and touring
All the pressure, all the cities, sometimes I wanna quit
Other times I wanna kill it 'til these rappers on my dick
Telling me I am the best, young hope in all these years
But I know I am the shit because I work for all I get
For my city, baby

White-walled house, all this art around you

Concentration of a koi fish, voices in my head
Coitus then avoidance, can you point us to the bed?
Unholy union, my communion of enjoyment is the bread

Do you even like the friends that’ll chill with you

Do it for the
This a shout out to the guy you know

I hope it kills me 'cause I need the pain
I hope you're ready for me, I feel the same now
Oh, oh, it's taking hold now
Oh, oh, it's taking hold

This a shout out to the guy you know
Do it for the boys like Idaho
I know I said it wrong, but I'm vibing though
Face numb and it's all lace like tie a bow, double knot
All the trouble got the cops' car siren go 
*whoop*
And he picked me up, like, by the throat
Throw me in the back and then drive me home
And you're the kind of girl that they try to clone
Three-way calls on the landline
, working in the retail
Stories at a bad time, I just wanna vent
Aye, seeing you a campfire, can we keep it burning?
I'm coming, I'ma stand by, come put up a tent
And you're not asleep, pick up my call
Now you're Marion Jones to me, you run it all
We're sitting in the dark, hoping that it kicks in
Do it all the same way, hope it turns out different this time

I hope it kills me 'cause I need the pain
I hope you're ready for me, I feel the same now
Oh, oh, it's taking hold now
Oh, oh, it's taking hold

This a shout out to your attitude
Pulling strings like a parachute
Coming down like a 
bandicoot, crash, PS1 days
And it's you that I have to lose, staring at the moon
Can we simmer down? You're my twinkle in my eye
And I'm thinking how everything is kind of crazy
Like a funny farm, always trying interrupt
And I'm getting nothing done, you know me
Like false flag terror in my territory
Sometimes I'm my own worst enemy
I need medicine, you the dispensary
Yeah, you always come through right when I need
And I always come back like a boomerang
Bittersweet Pootie Tang
 still going through my brain
Yeah, you had me by the balls like I'm Super Saiyan
But I prefer who you were, not who you became

I hope it kills me 'cause I need the pain
I hope you're ready for me, I feel the same now
Oh, oh, it's taking hold now
Oh, oh, it's taking hold

You're putting me on, you're putting me on
You're working me hard, I should've been strong
You're putting me on, you're putting me on
You're working me hard, I need you, baby
You're putting me on, you're putting me on
You're working me hard, I shouldn't be strong
You're putting me on, you're putting me on, oh
You're putting me on, you're putting me on
You're working me hard, I should've been strong
You're putting me on, you're putting me on
You're working me hard, I need you, baby

I'll see you at the finish (at the finish line) line
We're only wasting time here with you, oh-woah-oh

Holding your head down, they holding your head down
Talking 'bout living for the summer
But you're working all year round
I'm always hanging at the club
Until the bouncers say, ""Get out""
Wait for something good to happen
But it's happening here and now
I swear that all my friends are no good for me
I swear that all your friends see no good in me
You know, just call me when I cross your mind
We talk, you blow it like it's 
GoldenEye
 on 64
One of a kind,
 you tell me that there's more to life
I always said I come and go
Life is tryna take you dancing all night long
And fuck you slow and never call back

'Bout to crucify that ass
You're being so bad, that's what you get
Mean I never see you 'round here and I'm in here all the time
Guess you're sick of all the talking
You've been hearing all the lines
But you're so nice, yeah, manners like the rich areas
Drinking heavy, yeah, every week
My homies gone, you're ripped early, uh
I hear that talking and I don't think to mention it, uh
This year, I'm ticking off all the things I never did, nah
I still don't fight, I'm way too high
I know you don't want to leave him
I don't want to make you mine
In the corner of the room, if you ain't trippin', take a dive
We all need someone to bitch about

We're only wasting time here with you, oh-woah-oh

You should do your thing, you should do your thing
Whatever that shit means
I ain't no Hugh on the movie screen
I'm such a reader from rain so fuck this Mother Nature
Can't trust a bitch, just fuck a bitch
Friends all say she'll just betray you
Like another trader and it's just verbatim
I ain't even saying I believe the words
When I was young and in love with being in love
Got hurt from the things that hurt, I ain't throwing shade
For sequoia trees in the morning, guess what, boys
The beat-boys avoid the priest and the loyal thieves
Bitches don't need nobody else

We're only wasting time
We're only wasting time, baby
I'll see you at the finish (at the finish line) line
We're only wasting time here with you, oh-woah-oh

Wolves,Startup Cult,2013,"Bottle full of rocket fuel, bitches on my ship
I'm vibing on these videos, thinking that I'm rich
You know that time I saw a UFO, Mum said I was fibbing
But I saw what I saw, can't nobody tell me different
Got my head up in the clouds where the planes be
Climbing up the beanstalk, giants never phased me
They cutting up a Maybach, how can I be Jay Z?
Frankly, I'm a monster, man, look what they're creating
Spend it all, man, max it out, sugar tits, I ain't Malibu
But my wrist got a sparkle and my neck have it too
And my TV's to the ceiling
Every single channel's news 'bout myself
And the story is the money I've accrued
Got a bottle full of Moët and a Zooey Deschanel
Got my overcoat, Chanel, colours on my lapel
Take a boat in the water, let my worries float away
On the waves, is that what I'm supposed to say?
And I wonder

And I can't say I'm faded and I can't spend a million in cash
To make it rain paper and watch it cascade down and crash
A world full of wolves
A world full of wolves

My boy is always on the fly, card is coloured black
Feeling paranoid as Ozzy that he's never coming back
'Til we're always in the club, tell the DJ, ""Up the track""
In the corner, spilling drinks in an Alexander bag
Saying, ""He don't really love me, I'm fat"", yada-yada
Chew 'em up, spit 'em out in the street, Hubba Bubba
Kick a stink, make me almost dry reach up above her
Like the hill we could climb if we tried, chugga-chugga
And a pair Balenciaga, I don't need a crystal ball
Tried to leave the Truman Show and I'ma see you hit the wall
I don't have many possessions, but she told me, ""This is yours""
Yeah, I treat it like a pet
You can never keep a wolf in a cage
Chasing money or just chasing my tail
Chasing tail, it will make me tired, sail
Maybe I should think of business more
But the water isn't pure and I'm feeling insecure now

And I can't say I'm faded and I can't spend a million in cash
To make it rain paper and watch it cascade down and crash
A world full of wolves
A world full of wolves

Ay, if this is conscience, then call me conscious
I know the label want a hit and they'll call me bonkers
I know the corporations kill people for they profits
And they'll probably kill me too right before I stop it
I know they want the rappers talking 'bout all the dollars
And how the girls' stripping off all before the chorus
But work it if you want, I hope you always keep your power like a Ranger in a park where we're drinking, singing louder
Yeah, I know in my history, I've been contradictory
I just want brain from a dame like a big zombie
She just want a cross on her neck, not a bit holy
Fake titties feel alien, word to Sigourney
Marble floors in the lobby, man
Yeah, we pave paradise just because we can
The credit cards are spending, I feel like Charles and Eddy
I can lie but I'm just not ready, nah, nah, nah, nah

And I can't say I'm faded and I can't spend a million in cash

They paved paradise, put up a parking lot

Well I went down the coast but there's no coral reef
'Cause Adani stole the coal so all the corals bleached
So I went to the city but I don't wanna breath
Cause the smog in the air just makes me cough and wheeze
Going stir crazy like Milo, high as trees until it drops me
Thought I had depression but I just needed a coffee
And the Amazon's dying but we got Amazon Prime
Too busy to be angry so they carry on lying
Well there's a plastic island in our ocean that I heard about
We got to turn around this shit before it burns us out
We focus on our differences but we should kill the billionaires
Invest in local businesses, grow potatoes, spinachs
Might need my head checked, might need McAfee
I grew up on some poison, they called it McHappy
I guess you don't know what you got till it's packing
And it speeds down the road in a big yellow taxi

3005,,2014,"Hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Should have covered you in gold, call your ass C3PO
But we are too crazy, nothing too swanky
Tetanus every breakfast, rusty spoon raised me
I came to steal the game, Polo for the povos
Broke like Daddy’s condom, cockroach in the pot roast
Both my brothers higher than the lawn grow at the condo
And I can’t blame 'em, we all know 'bout some sorrow
Yo, though I never leave the door closed
Trying not to worry 'bout a X like Bordeaux
Shout to speaking French
I never spoke English when you wanted D&Ms
I’ll come back around like karma, I suggest you think again
When you want to hurt my feelings
With your fucking evil friends
Woah, I’m sorry, I’m just scared of the future
I want to sit in the dark, lurking on my computer
Hold up

No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
And fuck these other ninjas
I'll be right by your side 'til 3005, hold up

I used to care what people thought, but now I care less
I’m careless, carless, carried away with being depressed
In fairness, life was never fair, and they said this
I need some black and white, man
All this grey was not expected
Begged for independence, then you get it, you regret it
You didn’t crave a necklace, just someone to lay in bed with
Hear you pressures like you heard mine
Told me that you’ll be fine
Told me that you’ll be fucking them boys in a week's time
Ouch, so I’m lying on the couch tryna rewind
Or fast forward,
 it was never for pussy besides
The b-line can come now that we’ve retired but we’d tried
I deny the things they say about you 'cause you’re divine
And oh, I think pulled a muscle in my heart
I wish I wasn’t charming ’til you let me feel you up
’Til you let me take you home
'Cause we assumed it's supposed to be
Sucking soda streams
Now I can’t sleep through broken dreams
Hold up

No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you

Big stunting, that's like Evil Knievel
My rented Benz was riding on two wheels

First night that I met her, we were going all the way
I used to have some enemies, but I forgot their names
My energy is clean so I don’t worry what they say

Edible before the flight, wake up in foreign place
I could shoot the pull-up, but I’m going all the way
I was in a dead-end job, I couldn’t concentrate

When it rains, it’s gonna pour, and did I mention?
I remember they said, ""It’s unlikely""

I just put an album out and I don’t wanna break
Came up outta nowhere and we’re going all the way
This is for my brothers here and brothers gone away
I just count my blessings while I got ‘em here today
First night that I met her, man, and she don’t wanna wait
She don’t wanna wait

Yes, yes
Man can't see me, need your eyes checked (Since I was 16)
Man can't see me but I'm right here, I ain't died yet

Claude Monet,,2013,"Yeah, I don't worry 'bout a thing
I got no time to overthink

'Cause I feel it, it’s slipping away
'Cause kids aren't kids forever
But it feels like yesterday when everything was simple
It’s slipping away, just paint my canvas blurry
And they call that Claude Monet
That's Claude Monet, that's Claude Monet

Thinking ‘bout previous days
When I was on shifts in the pizza place
I was putting soap on my pizza face
But girls with the butts in the jeans I’d chase
And I keep chasing more with everything I saw
I said I’d do the right thing instead of being wrong
Said I’d be a rich man instead of being poor
Things just aren’t how they’re meant to be at all
Tell me, when did everything get so complex?
We used to talk but now we comment
I used to picture what I wanted
And they’d say, ""You can have it all but not yet""
My mum's emailing me
Am I too busy for the woman who raised me?
Friends that grew with me?
Cats in the cradle, raised a new kitty
Can we can get another ticket? Life goes too quickly, man

Sometimes I get overwhelmed
But I breathe deep and I tell myself
Remember the kid you are
Remember the kid you are
And sometimes I get overwhelmed
When I'm stressed out and I'm not myself
Remember the kid you are
Remember the kid you are

'Cause I feel it, it’s slipping away
'Cause kids aren't kids forever
But it feels like yesterday when everything was simple
It’s slipping away, just paint my canvas blurry
And they call that Claude Monet
That's Claude Monet, that's Claude Monet

And I don't worry 'bout a thing
I got no time to overthink

I remember racking at the shops once a day
Pocket full of dreams, that's just a phase
Another year passed, I don’t wanna cut the cake
My old man telling me I'll see tougher days
Just lights whizzing by, try catch the number plate
Keys in the slot, still tryna pump The Breaks
We are just animals, we are just some apes
The city is a jungle so it's all fun and games
And me, I swing around like a wind chime
Look, all of our looks’ll fade in time
Despite magazines and what you think right now
Beauty's only really on the inside
They tell me all it is is a big ride
Things get really dark before it hits light
One day I’ll make kids of my own
And I’ll tell 'em stay a kid when you're grown, uh-huh

Sometimes I get overwhelmed
But I breathe deep and I tell myself
Remember the kid you are
Remember the kid you are
And sometimes I get overwhelmed
When I'm stressed out and I'm not myself
Remember to kid you are
Remember the kid you are

'Cause I feel it, it’s slipping away
'Cause kids aren't kids forever
But it feels like yesterday when everything was simple
It’s slipping away, just paint my canvas blurry
And they call that Claude Monet

I hear you talkin' 'bout we a lot, oh, you speak French now?
Giving me the signs so I gotta take a hint now
I hit you up like ""Do you wanna hang right now?""
On the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now
You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now
It's after 2AM and that's asking a lot of you right now

All she talkin' bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she ever say is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

I can hear the sea yell through a sea shell
I’m on tour getting hugs from a seat belt
I should rap more - “do you think you’re Miguel?”
I’m not sure how to reach out for details
Hope you’ve been well, well it’s just a platitude
We don’t line up but I hope the planets move
I needed a change so you know I had to move
'Malibu Stacy' but she’s missing all her screws
And I’ve been lucky so far, been running all sixes
I was young and self destructive like an ice cube
Within some hot liquid
My friend don’t wanna think
But he should quit Xans, they’re like quicksand
All these things that time will devour, but I don’t watch the minute hand

Come and see me for once

Been a pest in the street like a feral kitty

They're trying to ask me questions, I'm not texting really
I'm not even finessing, I work over time to rep my city, true
I said it, it was done
I told a lot of lies but never in a song
I don't wanna steal nobody's girl but they're scheming on me
You can really lose yourself trying to be somebody

Might rip my organs out just for the money
Buy a monster truck, go roll over your mummy
Why I always think about my ex when I'm fucking?
Why I always thinking 'bout rain when it's sunny?
Might rip my organs out just for the money
Buy a monster truck, go roll over your mummy

Why I always thinking 'bout rain when it's sunny?

Yeah, even when I'm dead wrong
Jacquemus Vetements, hangups, hangups, Renoir
Ask me, do I have regrets though?
Probably more than you would guess though
Rap game Louis Theroux
Act dumb, everybody getting exposed
If they were me for an hour, could they keep it up?
No, I really doubt it
The real ones know it's not your outfit
They fuck with me strictly on my sound shit, ooh
Got the spirit in me, you can't hear it in me
Hate me with the spirits in me
But I have my difficulties living in reality
That's why I'm starting fights every other night
Drunk and high,
 
texting girls I hardly like
Saying, ""Rah, rah, rah, baby, I love you""
Texting girls I do like saying, ""Bitch, fuck you""
Text them when I want to come again like Apu
God bless the pussy, like the pussy said ""Ah-choo!""
Why they call it karma? 'Cause it karma 'round later
Gonna end up dead if I keep running 'round wasted
My place is gated but I'll send you out that chaos
Dead career rappers shouldn't talk, this ain't a seance, nah

Might rip my organs out just for the money
Buy a monster truck, go roll over your mummy
Why I always think about my ex when I'm fucking?
Why I always thinking bout rain when it's sunny?

Girls drive past, go 'beep-beep-beep'
Straight out of Blackwood, yeah not the OC
,
But I stay up in La
Boys wanna fight, that's the way that they are
Used to go paint on a train in the yard
Sleep all day, Gatorade vase in the car

Take off in a '03 Lex
Don't talk to cops and we don't confess
Used to come venue mad underdressed
Double tick Nikes like a track star, yes
Take off in a '03 Lex
Don't talk to cops and we don't confess
Used to come venue mad underdressed
Double tick Nikes like a track star, yes

Yeah, I'm OTT
Tour cleaned up, yeah, I'm OCD
Step back, man, you don't know me-me
And my girl too fine, yeah, OMG
Yeah, I'm OTT
One more time, yeah, I'm OCD
Step back, man, you don't know me-me
And my girl too fine, yeah, OMG

And I find myself thinking it was simple then
Lying to myself, it was never simple then

Well, back when back when
Thought we were gangsters, young madmen
Started out rapping in the wrong accent
Blonde, looking like Frank, but more like Em
When I couldn't get booked
Used to play FIFA, I was no good
Couple friends could've played in the Premier League
Or the AFL, but instead it was weed, ice and speed
But Brodie did it
The ozone is my only limit
Hope all my critics drink JUUL pod liquid
Hope all my friends make jumbo figures
That's to the core
Hope it rubs off like wax on a board
There were two in the bed, cracks in the walls
Rain on my head when it happened to pour

Yeah, I'm OTT
Tour cleaned up, yeah, I'm OCD
Step back, man, you don't know me-me
And my girl too fine, yeah, OMG
Yeah, I'm OTT
One more time, yeah, I'm OCD
Step back, man, you don't know me-me
And my girl too fine, yeah, OMG

And I find myself thinking it was simple then
Lying to myself, it was never simple then

Next year, have a brand new Lex
Don't talk to cops and we don't confess
Still come venue mad underdressed
Double tick Nikes like a track star, yes
[Outro: Allday &

And I find myself thinking it was simple then
Yeah, I'm OTT
Yeah, I'm OTT
Yeah, I'm OTT
Yeah, I'm OTT (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lying to myself, it was never simple then
Yeah, I'm OTT
Yeah, I'm OTT
Yeah, I'm OTT
Yeah, I'm OTT",https://genius.com/Allday-ott-lyrics
Send Nudes,,2016,"You mine, you send that, you send that

Yeah, baby, I'm a loner
I really need your love
Baby, I’m a stoner (Yeah, stoner)
I really need your drugs
When I come around (When I come around)
And you leave the door ajar
And I lay you down (And I lay you down)
But tonight I’m way too far (Way too far)
I know you’re paranoid of me
You’re rare, rare, I act accordingly
Your arse magical to me
Will still get fatter, probably
Wednesday night you're going out and
Drinking doubles somewhere crowded
They text me to talk about them
You’re so loud

Shake your rings and your chains when you come
And you’ve got the blood spitting straight from my heart
When I’m doing work faraway from your love
And you send me photos that straight fuck me up

When you send nudes (Beep, beep)
When you send nudes (Beep, beep)
My name tattooed on your boob
And I’ll do what you do

Baby, it's your summer (Oh, woah)
You spend every day outside
To get a little colour (Yeah, colour, colour, colour)
Eating fruit, drinking white wine (White wine)
And then you come over (Then you come around)
But you can't come over tonight
Let's turn our little folder (Yeah, turn up for me now)
Into a whole hard drive
That's me, I’m a fucking problem
Hatch me, I come a crawling
Let's order a double coffin
For when we have trouble walking
Couldn't make it a second without ya (You know, yeah)
People way too depressed around here
Bathroom at a party, texting me sexy pictures
I’m fuckin' witcha

Shake your rings and your chains when you come
And you’ve got the blood spitting straight from my heart
When I’m doing work faraway from your love
And you send me photos that straight fuck me up

When you send nudes (When you send nudes)
When you send nudes (Oh, when you send nudes)
My name tattooed on your boob
And I’ll do what you do (What you do)
When you send nudes (When you send nudes)
When you send nudes (Oh, when you send nudes)
My name tattooed on your boob
And I’ll do what you do

You mine (Girl, you mine)
You send that 
*uh*
 through
'Cause you can't come through tonight
You mine
You send that 
*uh*
 through
'Cause you can't come through tonight",https://genius.com/Allday-send-nudes-lyrics
Snapchat Lyf,,2013,"Man, this Snapchat shit
It's too good
It's like this

It all started when I called my friend to have a talk
He said, ""We can Snapchat"", why you wanna chat for?
So I went and got it from the App Store (What the hell)
The next thing you know, I'm all addicted like a crack whore
It started off taking pictures, I was that bored
My friends are like, ""Why you gotta send me every damn thought?"" (I don't know)
'Cause you can photograph, write something and draw on it
All colours, I just sound like an ad for it
Haha, fuck it, it's downsized, trust me
I'm tryna be on Instagram, but it just keeps buzzing
Let alone eat some food, let alone study
I never see my friends, I Snapchat 'em no worries, like
""What's up, bro?"", they're like, ""What's up, bro?""
We just say nothing, but it's so damn fun though (Hahaha)
Red ones, purple ones, I open all my cubes
It goes 'tap to load', man, 'press and hold to view', uh
Hoping that all you cop is nudes
But all you get is people taking pictures of their shoes (Ah, what?)
The sad reality, your dog is not that cute (Sorry)
I've gotta put my phone away, I've got a lot to do

But Snapchat, it's so addictive and shit

I was the guy dissing selfies, saying they're lame (Mmm, they are)
But fuck it, man, selfies are the name of the game (I guess so)
But you've got to do it sneaky if you're taking the train
That's called 'the look-away', quickly just take it and aim
Like, hope nobody noticed, now don't forget to focus
Or it will come out bogus, now share your precious moments
How I'm used to feeling when you see the photos open (I know, right?)
But there is no reply, so you just sit there hoping
It comes in twenty minutes, so you know they've been posing
And it's the dead of winter, and they don't have no clothes on
That's when you know you're in, man, that shit is heaps hot
And when that type of images comes, you want to take a screenshot (Come on...)
But you don't 'cause you're decent, or the real reason is
Snapchat has a feature, so they gonna fucking see it (What is that?)

That's weak shit, Snapchat. How are you gonna do us like that?
Really? Still a good app
I'm so addicted to this shit
I'm just gonna do the third verse right now, cool, Snapchat!

Yo, but sometimes I see a lot of weird shit
Some keep me up at night and really have a nightmare shit
I'm appalled at these photos that are all black with writing
You should have texted me, you're in the wrong app
And please don't take a photo of your ball-sack
I really don't want that, you'll be out of my contacts
I swear all your hairy chest like fucking Borat
Put that shit away, man, or I will not send you one back

You know my thing, it's 'alldaychubbyboy'
Add me",https://genius.com/Allday-snapchat-lyf-lyrics
Friday Fire Cypher (Freestyle),,2015,"I'm on a victory lap...in my city
The pretty girls king me
Believe it or not like ripley
Demons I got within me
Threesomes they got me busy
Its more from indecisiveness these days really I'm not that kinky
They wanna get to me
Bouncers miss me with the frisks
Real g's move in silence like a hippy in a prius
I got more enemies than I can think about or list
But I'm not buzzfeed mother fucker and I really never slip
I sleep rarely... I smoke too much weed clearly
Cas my ex girl keep nicely suggestin I need therapy
I think all my enemies must have a weak memory
Cas when they next to me they neutral as the sweed embacy
Driving in my dads jeep cherokee on an illegal substance
I be swerving like kyrie Irving in clevelands offence
I drink spirits and spur alina in even portions
I never said I'm living right well I'm just being honest
You keep your daughters indoors for an alldays performance
But I been creeping before this shit I don't need an audience
I can spit aight but thats the only thing I've conquered
Sometimes I hate being alive but fuck the easy option
I'm in a holding pattern like jets when a freezing storm hits
Thinking morbid thoughts of coffins I could be more warming
I be ree ree, caught into early indeed, morning till I've heard it to much is the only critique
For I grew up with no money and a fat cd.. wallet
Now I'm in these rich girls making these de..posits
I'm demonic, I came out through a well of hells core
I don't like myself, but I sure hate everyone else more
I'm on a world tour, like Al Gore, high on planes like belfore
Fuck my main girl with a condom, so I can fuck these other girls raw
I know I'm self involved, I'm [?]
I grew these ol balls, heavy like a cell door
And thats it",http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/allday/fridayfirecypherfreestyle.html
Outta Space,,2020,"(Tell me are you out there
Can you feel me out there
I can feel your energy a mile away
I feel your energy from outta space)

Mid-flight wifi calling you
Seven more days 'til I'm coming through
None of this shit feels new to us
Still separating our love from lust

Bought ya something back from the jewelry store
Make up for the fact that I'm never home
But I couldn't get you nothing
I find it hard to function

Tell me are you out there
Can you feel me out there
I can feel your energy a mile away
I feel your energy from outta space

Tell me are you out there (Out there)
Can you feel me out there (Out there)
I can feel your energy a mile away
I feel your energy from outta space

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
I can feel your energy a mile away
I feel your energy from outta space

Dear honey, baby, be honest
Is it me in your head, like a bee in your bonnet?
Quick, I made priorities shift, like tectonic plates
Deleted old names from electronics

I don't like texting, I'd rather E-S-P
And it wasn't no question, we found the frequency
Easily, and when I cross the sea
I'm yours truly, clear for everyone to see

There'll be planes, trains and automobiles, with hot wheels
'Til I'm back in your presence for real
In my bag like I'm Felix, cut out the pain like appendix
Steady hand, bigger plans, wrote this letter, licked the stamp

Tell me are you out there
Can you feel me out there
I can feel your energy a mile away
I feel your energy from outta space

Tell me are you out there (Out there)
Can you feel me out there (Out there)
I can feel your energy a mile away
I feel your energy from outta space

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
I can feel your energy a mile away
I feel your energy from outta space

Smoke in the room
Started clouding your vision
You're fading
You're fading
We're fading

Smoke in the room
Started clouding your vision
You're fading
You're fading
We're fading

Tell me are you out there
Can you feel me out there
I can feel your energy a mile away
I feel your energy from outta space

Tell me are you out there (Out there)
Can you feel me out there (Out there)
I can feel your energy a mile away
I feel your energy from outta space

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
I can feel your energy a mile away
I feel your energy from outta space",http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/allday/outtaspace.html
