21 Grams,Everyone We Know,2016,"Did you ever believe, yeah
This life owes you more than you have?
Try take it from me, no-oh
Got nothing to lose but 21 grams, uh-huh
Just let it all go (Oh-ho), don’t fuck with your man (Ah-ha)
When the weight of a soul (Yeah-hair) just 21 grams (Ah-hoo)
Just let it all go (Oh-ho), send love to your fam (Ah-ha)
When the weight of a soul (Yeah-hair) just 21 grams
It ain’t but 21 grams, ain’t but 21 grams
Just 21 grams

Cheah
One life here to foster, no time here to squander
Grew wiser and stronger, yet still tryna conjure a little ray of sunshine in a Quagmire
For the prize on offer, we divide and we conquer
If I fight any longer I’ma start looking like all my rivals and in time will give rise to a monster
Gotta be more to life than sort of like every morning rise and shine
I wanna see all the lights on tour life then immortalised in time
What’s the weight of a human soul? Does it change if bruised or old?
Famine or fame, man, it’s all the same, that’s what you stand to gain vs. lose it all

All that glitters ain't gold, what's royal is loyalty shown to your fam
What’s the weight of your soul? They say it nuttin' but 21 grams
Slow dance with the devil, he asked for my signature written in blood
I won’t bow to that level, know I can do better in death, hope my spirits arisen above
But, yo, will I be judged on the good and the bad that I've done in my life?
When I'm writing these songs, I'm righting my wrongs, that’s how it feels with each word I recite
Like I’m earning the right to be making amends, apologies given to all of my friends
If ever I dissed you know that I didn’t mean to offend

Did you ever believe, yeah
This life owes you more than you have?
Try take it from me, no-oh
Got nothing to lose but 21 grams, uh-huh
Just let it all go (Oh-ho), don’t fuck with your man (Ah-ha)
When the weight of a soul (Yeah-hair) just 21 grams (Ah-hoo)
Just let it all go (Oh-ho), send love to your fam (Ah-ha)
When the weight of a soul (Yeah-hair) just 21 grams
It ain’t but 21 grams, ain’t but 21 grams
Just 21 grams

And I
Can’t help but feel a little blessed like yes, I’ma do it better than the best I can
I’ma get it in with whatever I have like damn by chance
Do you wanna take my hand? Do you wanna dance in the middle of the street like me?
Side step it to the left of the centre ‘cause I’ve never been a fan of that right wing bullshit and negativity
Check it, I don’t mean to preach, this is not an anthem, Tuka’s on a rant let me pen a bit of peace, fuck a hand gun
If your head’s buried in the sand then understand I’m just tryna get a bit of free in me
Get a bit of free in me, dive deep, sightseeing the earth on cloud nine
Dreaming free as a bird, try to focus when the scenery blurs

Bringing life into this world's like bringing a grain of sand to the beach, but
Thing is that this little girl's like ten point five grams of you and me, love
Everythin’ from our past is passed on, it survived, it’s alive in our daughter
You ever think there's a link when we pass on? She might have passed on five and a quarter
Immortalised, I thought that I had everything I wanted
It all was lies, there's more to life, couldn't put my finger on it
My daughter’s eyes, I see my parents, see your parents too
Apparent when you stare into her eyes and she got a pair like you

Did you ever believe, yeah
This life owes you more than you have?
Try take it from me, no-oh
Got nothing to lose but 21 grams, uh-huh
Just let it all go (Oh-ho), don’t fuck with your man (Ah-ha)
When the weight of a soul (Yeah-hair) just 21 grams (Ah-hoo)
Just let it all go (Oh-ho), send love to your fam (Ah-ha)
When the weight of a soul (Yeah-hair) just 21 grams
It ain’t but 21 grams, ain’t but 21 grams
Just 21 grams

Just 21 grams
Did you ever believe, yeah
This life owes you more than you have?
Try take it from me, no-oh
Got nothing to lose but 21 grams",https://genius.com/Thundamentals-21-grams-lyrics
Sally,Everyone We Know,2017,"Everybody knows that Sally can’t dance
But damn she’s so fine that nobody’s gon' tell her
Two left feet, one beautiful smile
Hot damn she’s so fly whenever we’re together

And here we go yo, I think it was a Friday night
I was kicking it at my place, aight...
I could feel my thigh vibrate, Sally's on my cell phone
She was at a club but she was by her self though
Sipping on a Bombay, telling me to drop by
I could be her hot date, Jiggy in the spot light
Karaoke contest, she was gonna rock mics
We could sing Beyoncé songs till the clock chimes
One in the morning and the party was boring
When I walked in Sally must have caught me yawning
She said “Quit stalling boy meet me on the dance floor
I’ma cut a couple shapes up like a band saw”
So under the disco ball we all
Shake it like a Polaroid singing la-di-da
Down and dirty yo, Sally ain’t no Barbie doll
Goofy as hell but who cares, blasé blah

Everybody knows that Sally can’t dance
But damn she’s so fine that nobody’s gon' tell her
Two left feet, one beautiful smile
Hot damn she’s so fly whenever we’re together

Once upon a time in my neighbourhood
Me and all of my next-door neighbours would
Get the whole block jumping to the latest jams
Rocking out to the sound of our favourite bands
I remember one summer on a Friday night
We had Morg dog spinning so the party's hype
I saw my home girl Sally from across the way
An intelligent lady with a lot to say
She had a shimmer in her eyes and a smile to match
Skinny waist line but the style is fat
Just a glimpse of her face it could brighten the mood
Any place that she went she would light up the room
I was like let's bust a groove, she said “cool”
But she moves like she's rocking two busted shoes
She got two left feet and can't work the beat
She can't dance but Sally’s still perfect to me
[Pre-Chorus: Mataya & 
Tuka
]
I don't wanna hurt nobody, I just wanna move my body
She's sweet like marmalade
, and tastes like oooh la-la-la
La—la—la-la-la-la—la—la
A-la-di-da, a-la-di-da-di-da, ayy
A-la-di-da, a-la-di-da-di-da

Everybody knows that Sally can’t dance
But damn she’s so fine that nobody’s gon' tell her
Two left feet, one beautiful smile
Hot damn she’s so fly whenever we’re together

She don’t foxtrot, two-step or minuet but
She’s so fresh I don’t interject
There’s no skip to her lou or the do–si–do
But that's cool I could still be her Romeo
You know
[Pre-Chorus: Mataya & 
Tuka
]
I don't wanna hurt nobody, I just wanna move my body
She's sweet like marmalade
, and tastes like oooh la-la-la
La—la—la-la-la-la—la—la
A-la-di-da, a-la-di-da-di-da, ayy
A-la-di-da, a-la-di-da-di-da

Everybody knows that Sally can’t dance
But damn she’s so fine that nobody’s gon' tell her
Two left feet, one beautiful smile
Hot damn she’s so fly whenever we’re together
Everybody knows that Sally can’t dance
But damn she’s so fine that nobody’s gon' tell her
Two left feet, one beautiful smile
Hot damn she’s so fly whenever we’re together",https://genius.com/Thundamentals-sally-lyrics
Think About It,Everyone We Know,2016,"When all you can do is
Feel like everyone else just know
You're not alone, you're just by yourself
And it's all that I think about
Think about it

I wrote your name as a tattoo in my mind
Tryna fill the void in my chest
I bang on it like a baboon
It's like I'm tryna dead that noise in my head
Telling me your bad news, am I blind?
Am I just a boy in your bed?
But I ain't stressin' on your taboos, it's alright
I'm just tryna see the poise in your step
We go dancing in the moonlight
When everything is feeling okay
And I don't really know the answer
Why I'm fascinated by you most days
She wanna keep me on the side, that's cool
It doesn't happen every day, that's fine
But when she wanna play, lasso
I'm already on the way, cab rides

When all you can do is
Feel like everyone else just know
You're not alone, you're just by yourself
And it's all that I think about
Think about it
Calling on me
You can call me on the telephone
When you feel like everyone else
Just know that you're all that I think about
Think about it

You got me living like a vampire 'cause
I only see you when the sun is down
We get lit like campfire wood
But one day we're gonna run this town
Maybe we could build an empire, cool
But first you gotta take that dive
You want something to believe in, true
Believe me, baby so do I
So we party on the weekend
Show me yours, I'll show you mine
Skinny-dipping in the deep end
We just tryna stay afloat tonight
And we don't ever wanna pretend
Really we already both knew why
You only call me when you're peaking
I'm your number one go-to guy

When all you can do is
Feel like everyone else just know
You're not alone, you're just by yourself
And it's all that I think about
Think about it
Calling on me
You can call me on the telephone
When you feel like everyone else
Just know that you're all that I think about
Think about it

Come on and give me your, come and give me your
Come and give me your, come and give me your love
Your love, your love
Come on and give me your, come and give me your
Come and give me your, come and give me your love
Your love, your love

We don't wanna fight
We're just gonna waste time
They got no clue 'bout what we're doing
So till then we ain't gonna lie
They call us foolish, but we fooled them
And maybe that's why, why, why
I can be your go-to guy

When all you can do is
Feel like everyone else just know
You're not alone, you're just by yourself
And it's all that I think about
Think about it
Calling on me
You can call me on the telephone
When you feel like everyone else
Just know that you're all that I think about

Never Say Never,Everyone We Know,2016,"If I had the answer, I could make it better
Give you everything you wanted just so you would stay forever
Instead I say never say, never say never
Never say, never say never, never ever

Yeah, shout out to my mother, shout out to my mother
She never told my pops about the stash of marijuana
That was hidden in the cupboard, lifted like a buzzard
Rapping for the fuck of it, I'm dumber than a dullard
Finna bring the ruckus when I'm singin' for my supper
Funky as a drummer from the city to the suburbs
I tell you what is absurd, we spun a couple verses
For the lovebirds, now Thundamentals is the buzzword
Finger on the buzzer, but we ain't seein' dollars
Feelin' pretty far from baller, still I'm pickin' up your daughter
In a '94 Corolla and I'm reppin' it regardless
The motor on it's older than a fuckin' penny farthing
If you're sellin' out your concert then they rollin' out the carpet
While you chillin' at the summit, don't forget to get your ass kissed
'Cause one minute it's poppin', next, you're sittin' on a park bench
Literally starving, reminiscing on the past tense

If I had the answer, I could make it better
Give you everything you wanted just so you would stay forever
Instead I say never say, never say never
Never say, never say never, never ever
It's the modern day era, so I can be anybody
Got me sippin' on liquor, someday I'll be an artist
Instead I say never say, never say never
Never say, never say never, never ever


Fuck it
If it didn't kill me, then it's gonna make me stronger
One day I'll make a killin', you should probly date a doctor homie
Let's be honest, I ain't waitin' on a coffin
I already got it bodied like I'm bangin' on a shotgun
Save it for the judge, call me later when the cops come
Blame it on the funk, baby, shake it if you got some
Hate me if you want, but my lady knows I got love
So if she wants some brain, I ain't singin' her a love song
I ain't in a hurry, I ain't bankin' on no pot luck
Till we bathe in milk and honey naked in a hot tub
Sippin' champagne, maybe we can get a top-up?
Gettin' busy all day, high as helicopters
Flyin' on a jet plane, red eye not a problem
On my way to Cali, gonna blaze one in the hot sun
Add a dash of lemonade and lime to my vodka
Got a genie in a bottle, still I'm dreamin' that I was one

If I had the answer, I could make it better
Give you everything you wanted just so you would stay forever
Instead I say never say, never say never
Never say, never say never, never ever
It's the modern day era, so I can be anybody
Got me sippin' on liquor, someday I'll be an artist
Instead I say never say, never say never
Never say, never say never

'Cause just when you think
That you lost it so you toss it in the trash
Lean back and watch it blossom in your hands
Lean back, never say, never say never
Never say, never say never
Whatever you think, think the opposite of that
Kick back and watch your opposite attract
Lean back, never say, never say never
Never say, never say never, never ever

If I had the answer, I could make it better
Give you everything you wanted just so you would stay forever
Instead I say never say, never say never
Never say, never say never, never ever
It's the modern day era, so I can be anybody
Got me sippin' on liquor, someday I'll be an artist
Instead I say never say, never say never
Never say, never say never, never ever",https://genius.com/Thundamentals-never-say-never-lyrics
Milk & Honey,Everyone We Know,2017,"Biddy by bit I dip, I dive, I bob, I weave
I rock my 
steez
 like Astro Boy with rocket feet on cloud 9
Biddy by bit I lift my mind up fly as fuck
Got a bird’s eye view on what I see, I don't need no down time

They said you can have it all
‘Cause in the land of milk and honey everything is catered for
They said you can have it all
‘Cause in the land of milk and honey, honey you can make a home
They said you can have it all
‘Cause in the land of milk and honey, buddy you can paint it gold
They said you can have it all, save your filthy money yuppie
What you in it for? I be on a roll

Hey yo if this is just a ride I'ma ride it till the saddle breaks
Bust my hide shake it like a hundred hungry rattle snakes
If it's greener on the other side I'ma be
A busy bee knee deep in pollen while the motherfucking cattle graze
But see I'm from Sydney city streets where the gritty teeth
Of piggies feed on silly sheep in sticky marinade
Sit and salivate as I pick a pretty peach and nab
A bag of apples from that trippy tree that Eve and Adam ate
Namaste, catch me sipping hippie tea, listen while I politic
On life and what it really means, that shit cray
Snatch a patty cake, my team be whipping cream, crème brûlée
Live the dream, no sour grapes, I'm down to build, so how you feel? What can I say?
Get up off of my case, quit tryna block my shine
I'm tryna knot my lace so I don't botch my clim, watch my rise way up high
Straight up why, reach for the sky
I said I'm just tryna reach for the sky, that's why

Biddy by bit I dip, I dive, I bob, I weave
I rock my 
steez

They said you can have it all, save your filthy money yuppie
What you in it for? I be on a roll

I'm on a roll again, well I guess we gotta roll again, we play to win
So spread them angel wings and let my soul ascend don’t cage me in
I’m rare as polar bears and as old as sin, I can see the light
That golden glare like a camera catching a panoramic solar flare
In the heat of night I’ma redefine what it is to be alive
Wanna glimpse then feast them eagle eyes
Heed advice, freedom is a piece of mind
Want a hint? Gotta read between them lines, this world is owned by pigs
They be disguised, little bird told me never throw my fist so instead I know my shit
I be defiant, beef with giants, defeat goliath with a mighty pen
When I speak in rhymes
I’ma buck them trends, mother fuck what Simon says
Got a liquor lip loaded gun, I’ma do my thing till my thing is done
Find me filling my cup, Jesse getting poured up, when I wasn’t on top y’all didn’t call once
Been spilling my guts ya’ll calling it emo, it’s all love from a brother like me though
I be chilling at the beach in the middle of the week with a blunt and a bottle of the pinot grigio
Vino for all my people that’s been repping the crew since day dot
We got rocket feet full of rocket fuel, call me Astro boy, ‘bout to take off

Biddy by bit I dip, I dive, I bob, I weave
I rock my steez like Astro Boy with rocket feet on cloud 9
Biddy by bit I lift my mind up fly as fuck
Got a bird’s eye view on what I see, I don't need no down time

Déjà Vu,Everyone We Know,2017,"Same shit, different day shift
Late night, hit the light switch
I used to feel safe in this blanket
I used to dream bigger than inside of my eyelids
But tonight I'm wide-awake
Waiting for them sheep to count
Wishing I could find a way to break the cycles I’ve built
‘Cause right now I'm freaking out

‘Cause it’s true, I've been sleeping
I've been sleeping on my dreams for way too long
That’s why you hear me saying
Déjà vu
Maybe one day I'll wake up
‘Cause I’ve been waiting on that day to come for way too long
That’s why you hear me saying
Déjà vu

I bought a ticket for the lottery
And I got every single number right
But I left it in the pocket of my grotty jeans
That were ruined when I threw them in the tumble dry
So now I’m sitting here staring out a window pane
Satisfied with this fat slice of humble pie
And I ain’t really down with this fucking rain but
I’ma stick around for the sunny side
Up at the crack of dawn, home in the dead of night
No time to dedicate, no time to set aside
Instead I get in line, I wish that I had it all
Slave to a dollar sign, pass me the Panadol
I’ve been on the edge, I’ve been tripping tripping
Yo, can I get a grip, I’ve been slipping, slipping
Yo, let me reminisce on this feeling, I’m feeling
Sick of hearing one day, I’ma make a killing but don’t

I've been sleeping on my dreams for way too long
That’s why you hear me saying
Déjà vu
Maybe one day I'll wake up
‘Cause I’ve been waiting on that day to come for way too long
That’s why you hear me saying
Déjà vu

I reminisce so much, déjà vu
I reminisce so much, déjà vu
Like Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Ayo, I reminisce over you, my god, déjà vu
I reminisce so much, déjà vu
I reminisce so much, déjà vu
Like Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Ayo, I reminisce over you, my god

I got a fire in my belly, you can see it in my eyes
Inspired by the many who could reach for the skies
Or light up the room in the dark with the vibrance of youth
Stay wise to the truth in your heart
An indigo child, spilt from the movement of stars
Soon to depart, only visitors sightsee
All I see is me and my team
Tryna add a dash of future that we scooped from the past
Flying at light speed, I been riding on a pipe dream
And it's got you thinking what one might be
Do you know the difference? Do you know what I mean?
Homie, be chill like ice tea, can you go the distance?
Tai chi, can you flow with me still?
Or are you sickened ‘cause my poetry’s ill?
Do you remember now we're older thinking back about the road that we built?
Are we over the hill? If it could only be real

Same shit, different day shift
Late night, hit the light switch
I used to feel safe in this blanket
I used to dream bigger than inside of my eyelids
But tonight I'm wide-awake
Waiting for them sheep to count
Wishing I could find a way to break the cycles I’ve built

Blue Balloons (B.B’s Song),Everyone We Know,2017,"I wrote this for my friend
A friend I never knew
Now every single stage we grace they know your name
It's safe to say they throw their lighters in the air
I know that you were there
On that sun drenched afternoon
I felt your spirit in the wind
We threw a hundred blue balloons for you
A hundred blue balloons for you
I can not forget the view
And I've never known the truth
Like the words they spoke for you my friend, it's not the end
We're sending you a hundred blue balloons
A hundred blue balloons for you
I could not forget the view
And I've never known the truth
Like the words they spoke for you my friend, it's not the end
We're sending you a hundred blue balloons
A hundred blue balloons
A hundred blue balloons
A hundred blue balloons
A hundred blue balloons

W'dup brother, I'm penning you this letter
And you know I gotta send it even though we never met up
But I hope that you get this wherever you are
I hope you know in my heart I consider us connected
See myself reflected in you
A few years difference but rolling with a similar crew
We were two young fellas tryna make it out the mountains
And by all accounts man you sounded astounding
I know, yeah I know you were amazing
'Cause I recognise the written on the faces
Of your family and friends, I'm sorry for their loss
I'm offering my them my commiserations
This a dedication to the life
Of a beautiful soul I wish that I could've known
But I don't so I'm writing this poem just to say
I will never forget how I felt on that day

I wrote this for my friend
A friend I never knew
Now every single stage we grace they know your name
It's safe to say they throw their lighters in the air
I know that you were there
On that sun drenched afternoon
I felt your spirit in the wind
We threw a hundred blue balloons for you
A hundred blue balloons for you
We threw a hundred blue balloons for you
A hundred blue balloons for you
We threw a hundred blue balloons
A hundred blue balloons
A hundred blue balloons

This one's for everyone that's ever lost anyone
Does real closure even exist? Tryna find a bit of peace
Can't help but feel like everything is said and done
We're still left stricken with grief
And there's no time limits to heartbreak
So hard we can't shake the pain so we dwell on the loss
'Cause memories live on in the minds of your loved ones
Each tear's a memento shed in every drop
So if you're listening in just know that you were a gift
You're someone I'll never forget and it feels so surreal
That I never even met you in a pass life
I reckon we were probably friends
For those who did it goes one foot after the other
Tryna hold it together while bearing the weight
Just know I got love for the brother, I'll hold it forever
I feel blessed just to mention your name

I wrote this for my friend
A friend I never knew
Now every single stage we grace they know your name
It's safe to say they throw their lighters in the air
I know that you were there
On that sun drenched afternoon
I felt your spirit in the wind
We threw a hundred blue balloons for you
A hundred blue balloons for you
I can not forget the view
And I've never known the truth

Ignorance Is Bliss,Everyone We Know,2017,"Whats poppin' bruh?
Yeah tell me what's crackin', yo what the fuck's happenin?
I’m half Anglo-Saxon dawg
The other half’s Latin, I'm basically smashin' it
I blend in with the masses but
I live in a spot where reality’s hideous
I gotta come clean on my privilege
I gotta tell you how it really is
I got male privilege
Straight privilege, white privilege
Get it every single second of the day
Every minute of the night type privilege
So when I hear a white person whinging
About how really they don’t see privilege
I'm like you’re a straight up idiot
You cannot be serious
If you don’t see that the systems insidious
Twisted and really designed for your benefit
Then you’re the silliest cracker I’ve ever met
Renderin' all your opinions irrelevant
Whoa! And I ain't reppin' it
But can choose to ignore so I'm livin' at large
The agendas supremacist
Look at my skin, I guess that i'm guilty as charged

Ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is bliss
But there's ignorance in my pigment
Do I get ignorant and get lit
If I don't admit to my privilege
From the pigment up in my skin
Then that's dumb shit, play the victim
'Bout as ignorant as it gets
Ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is bliss
But there's ignorance in my pigment
Do I get ignorant and get lit
If I don't admit to my privilege
From the pigment up in my skin
Then that's dumb shit, play the victim
'Bout as ignorant as it gets

Am I that boy in the bubble?
Am I oblivious? Am I indifferent?
Is prejudice something I've never experienced?
Have I avoided that struggle?
Have I been ignorant? Is it significant?
Something I choose to ignore or
Do I get defensive when the shit comes up?
Even though I never fed food to that thought
Hot damn!
Am I losin' my mind?
School forgot to mention racism is institutionalised
God damn!
Does that mean I’ve done something wrong?
Is it uncomfortable to hear the words that are sung in this song?
My bad
Have I been runnin' my lip or have I been runnin' away?
Has it been under my nose?
Has it been in front of my face?
Why do I have nothing to say?
White man
This world keeps screaming at you
Are you to insecure to listen to the inconvenient truth

Ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is bliss
But there's ignorance in my pigment
Do I get ignorant and get lit
If I don't admit to my privilege
From the pigment up in my skin
Then that's dumb shit, play the victim
'Bout as ignorant as it gets
Ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is bliss
But there's ignorance in my pigment
Do I get ignorant and get lit
If I don't admit to my privilege
From the pigment up in my skin
Then that's dumb shit, play the victim
'Bout as ignorant as it gets

I'm gon' get it right
One day we gon' get it right
Right, I'm gon' get it right
One day we gon' get it right
Right, I'm gon' get it right
One day we gon' get it right
Right, I'm gon' get it right
One day",https://genius.com/Thundamentals-ignorance-is-bliss-lyrics
My Friends Say,Everyone We Know,2017,"My friends say
To wait, I should be patient
Fuck that
I say
This life is for the taking
Don't look down

Middle finger to a hater throwing shade upon the life that I love
Ayo ayo ayo ay
And we don't listen when they're saying to be patient, I’ma take what I want
Ayo ayo ay
Keep your head up, baby, don’t look down
Keep your head up, baby, don’t look down
I’m only ever gonna hold you up so
Don’t look down

My friends tell me to wait my turn but I don't waste time
Earn a bit of respect right before I take flight
See it all with my third eye from a great height, that's a bird’s eye
Stage dive on these snake types that be circling like great whites
Fuck a shark attack, I'm too smart for that, but this life ain't what it seems
It’s hard for people to understand the type of life I lead
I be jumping up on that airplane, steady chasing that cream
I might make a bit of paper, but it's never making me

My friends say
To wait, I should be patient
Fuck that
I say
This life is for the taking
Don't look down

Middle finger to a hater throwing shade upon the life that I love
Ayo ayo ayo ay
And we don't listen when they're saying to be patient, I’ma take what I want
Ayo ayo ay
Keep your head up, baby, don’t look down
Keep your head up, baby, don’t look down
I’m only ever gonna hold you up so
Don’t look down

Before I had to start again I thought I’d hit my peak
I guess that man in the mirror he must of been kidding me and
I’m still tryna build that home in my head
You call me crazy, what’s the deal homie? Be fair
Spare me the grief
Instead stare at the stars with not a care in the world
I'm not scared to believe
On a search for a heart of gold
I wear it on my sleeve
Everywhere I go
Tryna find that inner peace just like everyone we know
So when

My friends say
To wait, I should be patient
Fuck that

This life is for the taking

Reebok Pumps,Everyone We Know,2017,"I’ma twist a swisher, we can roll a tree
You can get up on it homie, pass the OCBs
I’m getting older, riding dirty like I’m ODB
And since a young’un I’ve been suffering from that OCD
I guess I got a problem never wanna get my sneakers scuffed
I remember working jobs saving up for months and months
Ever since I saw Dee Brown do a no look dunk
I been on the hunt for the original, the Reebok Pumps
Omni lights, there was something ‘bout the way it was
Black and White, with the b-ball logo all up on the tongue
It was love, had no other options but the high tops
When I’m dead and buried want a pair up in my pine box
My gosh, lads be repping TNs on their Nike Max
Fuck around I bring the '80s and the '90s back
That’s just how it is for me, feels like the epitome of hot
Like my honey with some Pumps on her pretty feet

You’re blowing up the spot in your Reebok Pumps
Damn girl you do it every time
It’s all I ever wanted, yo, it must have been a sign
A slice of the heavenly divine, ‘cause you keep
Blowing up the spot in your Reebok Pumps
Damn girl you’re fucking up my mind
It’s all I ever wanted, yo, it must have been a sign
A slice of the heavenly divine in your Reebok Pumps

Pump it up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up
In your Reebok Pumps
Air it out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out
In your Reebok Pumps

Yo, let me take you down that memory lane
Before I used to ride a skateboard down it everyday
Growing up I never really felt like all the other kids
With their pumped up kicks like their feet were puffer fish
Bro, let’s be honest here I never owned a pair
Until I hooked a mate up with some chronic and they loaned me theirs
Pump it up, air it out, YOLO fucking swag
Stuff them crummy bubble wrap booties in your bummy duffle bag
I be rolling deep like it's 1989
Retro classic shit, custom fit, fabulous, I’m crazy fly
Holy cow, I be balling on a budget now
Space Jam T check me out, Bugs up on the front, don’t fuck around
Shout out to my Nike heads, they one-upped the stakes
But but Reebok run the game back when I was underage
That’s just how it is for me, feels like the epitome of hot
Like my honey with some pumps on her pretty feet

You’re blowing up the spot in your Reebok Pumps
Damn girl you do it every time
It’s all I ever wanted, yo, it must have been a sign
A slice of the heavenly divine, ‘cause you keep
Blowing up the spot in your Reebok Pumps
Damn girl you’re fucking up my mind
It’s all I ever wanted, yo, it must have been a sign

Now your cousins getting my quotes scribbled on their stomach
Buggin', I been trippin' on it
I ain't gonna lie though that ain't gonna cut it
Everybody I know's living with a struggle
Gotta hustle on the double, learn to juggle if you wanna rise above it
Gun it, I think we started somethin', somethin' out of nothin'
From the mountains to the concrete jungle
Work hard, stay hungry like they got me muzzled
Fuck it, stay funky check my offbeat shuffle
If I stumble I’ma wing it like a butterfly
Keep it on the humble as I flutter by, every winter whippin'
Up a ripple in the puddle while others slumber, dreamin'
Of another life, I’ma tidal wave into the summertime

I truly appreciate all the people up at the shows
It’s incredible to think that you’re listening to me flow
So we can remember for everybody we know
If we never plant a seed then how will we ever grow?
I’m scouring the concrete, plucking another rose
Ducking another foe, proposing another toast to you
For when you’re blue, just know that you’re not alone, it’s true
Do you remember thinking back when we were younger?
When the only thing we had up in our belly was a hunger
I would sit and ponder, talking way before the Thunda
Tell me does it sound familiar? Do you ever stop and wonder
Exactly what we might have been?
This for the next gen of whipper snappers hearing the pitter patter of tiny feet
Repeat it after me, ""I can do anything""
Now let the power of that concept settle in

Do you remember when we were younger?
Did you ever think this far ahead?
Here we are, is it too late to start again?
Think about it every now and then

Full moon on a clear night with a cool breeze
All I really need I swear
We ain't gonna sleep till the sun comes up
Be aware of the beast my dear
You can probably see I'm weird
But can you at least fight fair
Please don't police my lair
Locked out of my home town, game on roll deep
I got the whole team right here
So we gonna eat right here
I be light years ahead of 'em
Never let them feed my fears, here's a bright idea
But the government and whatever it is peddling
You don't give a shit about us
Mother fucking Mike Baird
Blood sucker you are killing my buzz
All I hear is bullshit that you piss in my ears
Shut it the fuck up

But the sheep doesn't dream, I just count 'em in my sleep
Dead meat, eat 'em up with these motherfucking teeth
And it's cold in the streets so we stay on the come up
And hunt for their fleece, yeah we been on the prowl
No love for a pig but shout out to my wolves
That be holding me down, are you hearing me howl?
If you hear me howl back brother
I got a pack of wolves hanging out back brother
And they hungry so the mission is to stack duckets
Pitch black so they couldn't keep track of us
No! 'Cause we don't believe in that nine-to-five
In the evening we creep but from five to nine
They tried to tell me that I wasn't in my right mind
You could get the work in the middle of the night time

Where my mother fucking wolves?

Open Letter,Everyone We Know,2017,"You got me open
Open like a letter
Open like a letter to God
But it's you I believe in

My wings are broken and my feathers are lost ‘cause I dive in
The deep end, fuck it I’ma live without them
And I was hoping that I'd be better off if I could hide all my
Secrets so I wouldn’t even need to think about it indeed
I wrote a letter, I never sent it
I left it in my dresser addressed it return to sender
But then when I met you it changed the way I read it
So I guess it's why I’m penning this page and making edits
Talk about a first impression ‘cause when you stepped in
It took a second to set in then I heard you mention
How you think everything is interconnected
Before you went on to summarise my life up in a single sentence
And there ain’t no point tryna fight the feeling
Shit is hectic, my mind was reeling, had my head in my hands
Tryna comprehend it
Tryna centre myself, here I am, I hope my message is felt

You got me open like a letter to God
But it’s you I believe in
You got me open like a letter to God
But it’s you I believe in

You make it look good
You make it seem so easy
Got it on lock, knocking on wood
Pray you don't leave me everyday
You make it look good
You make it seem so easy
Got it on lock, knocking on wood
Pray you don't leave me everyday

I’ve been getting tipsy tipping out this grey goose
I wrote an open letter send it out to Jesus
Hey you! Wondering does it even make a difference
When I’m scribbling my hymns? Am I pissing in the wind?
Are the people listening to what I say?
And does it really fricking matter anyway?
If they do or they don’t? I don’t know, my ego’s out control
But it could all be over any day so I pay
Homage, to my lady she’s a goddess
Taking solace in her body, still I’m living like a novice
She was tryna drop some knowledge
Telling me I got some problems to acknowledge
Get on it ‘cause it’s rocky at the bottom
I solemnly swear to address all my weaknesses
Just know that it’s you I’m believing in
You said I gotta learn to love ‘fore I get it right
So I'll be working on my love till the end of time

You got me open like a letter to God
But it’s you I believe in
You got me open like a letter to God
But it’s you I believe in

You make it look good
You make it seem so easy
Got it on lock, knocking on wood
Pray you don't leave me everyday
You make it look good
You make it seem so easy
Got it on lock, knocking on wood
Pray you don't leave me everyday

You got me open
Open like a letter
Open like a letter to God
But it's you I believe in
You got me open
Open like a letter
Open like a letter to God
But it's you I believe in

Learn to love before you get it right”

Yeah we puffing the loud
Blood, I feel like this could be the year

Not particularly proud
‘Cause they reserve me a permanent seat at the pub now
Fuck it I’m chucking it down
Chugging a stout, I’ma be brutally honest
This one ain’t nothing profound, it’s me fucking around
Sculling a schooner of orange
Mix it with vodka, me and the homies
Are totally flummoxed, it’s four in the morning
They pushing me home in a trolley, I’m trolleyed
Looking all vertically challenged, I’m making a promise
That a year from today
I’ll be stumbling sloppy, picture the squad
Getting totally bolloxed and murdering sonnets
Slurping the bourbon while choofing the purplest chronic

But another beggar with a pan
Looking for a dollar wanna spend it on a gram (4:20)
Chop a session for the fam, holla at me, not a problem
We the freshest in the land (Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop)
You can tell them in advance, help them get across it
While I tell it to the tonic in my hand like a modern Aristotle
We already got it popping, put a message in the bottle
And address it to your man (Whoop, whoop)
This is what I am, this is what I live
Call it philosophic I ain’t bothered by a profit
Prophecy is what I give, cop it on the chin
Like a boxer in the ring (Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop)
I’m not stressing on a thing, bring a bada bing
Bring a bada boom, I'm blotto on the piss
You already know what it is
Stuff the chronic in the spliff, get lit like a motherfucking wolf

Heard It On The Low,Everyone We Know,2017,"￼You can say I’m to blame
But it won’t mean a thing
If it’s gossip then
I don’t want it man
You can stomp and complain
But I’m not gonna take on your problems
I promise that’s not gonna change
Let’s be honest

Who got it and who don’t? Who want it and who won’t?
Who knows? I’ve forgotten, I’m too stoned, I’m too deep
My views tweaked I’m unique, a new niche
If you folk accuse me with mutiny
Excuse me, you’ll soon see when you speak
The seeds that you sow are nowhere where the roots grow
You're too green but you can go ahead and do so
Better the devil you know the routine, your crew’s lame
I blend lemons into Kool-Aid, that’s why
You’re more jelly than glucose in fruit cakes
Begging for kudos, selling them fat lies
But you don’t really have a clue though, touché
Busy playing Cluedo, whatever happened
To telling the truth mate? Relax man
You ain't Batman or Bruce Wayne
In fact the fact stands you're two faced

And I can feel it in my bones

Chinese whispers listening in
So I heard it on the low
Ohhh—ohhh, ohhh—ohhh

I was tryna increase the peace but my mood is hectic
I been brooding on it, I forget to mention
Gotta school you on it, let me pop this question
How many ways can you ruin a friendship?
‘Cause that’s an art form that you’ve perfected
I seen it in your eyes, yeah you’re green with envy
Its written on your face b, the shits offensive
You ain’t even gotta rate me but please respect me
Respectfully yours, I been putting my work in
I’m working on something, you constantly chirping
Been flapping your gums, you been running your lips
Keep my name out your mouth, you a son of a— no!
I won't call your mum that shit, too much respect
For the times that she let me crash on the mattress
Yo what the fuck happened? We used to be bros
Now it blows in the wind, that’s the way that it goes

But it won’t mean a thing

How You Been?,Foreverlution,2011,"Yo way back when, before I started rappin' with Tuk
It was you and I hangin' at the back of the bus
We had blunt wraps packin' with buds
But you swapped them for those white lines rackin' em' up
Whatever happened to us?
We never dreamed of going platinum with plush leather seats in the Jeeps yeah the shit, it didn't matter to us
We were happy with a packet of darts
In your old man's car steady havin' a laugh
But times change, you chose to go the corporate route
It's awkward now, we ain't got shit to talk about
You wanted to get paid kid go ahead do it
You thought it was stupid how we chose to make music
But now the fans lose it, you finally understand
That despite never seeing you, you're still my brother man
It'll stay that way until the end of time, shit
And you're the reason that I 
sketch this rhyme
I got love

Hey how you doing?
How you been?
Shouldn't be this hard to say what I mean
I've been doing okay, I've been doing my thing
Been going my way been chasing the dream
(Hey)
Hey how you doing?
How you been?
Shouldn't be this hard to say what I mean
I've been doing okay, I've been doing my thing
Been going my way been chasing the dream
(Yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah)
(Chasing the dream)

Change is the only constant, from the offset
When shit gets switched up, it pays to know the concept
Though the prospect to perceptive for what it is
When tension is prominent, you best wanna ponder this
Often, friendship, drifts in the opposite direction
To positive unless you acknowledge it
Take steps to honour it, shit
I remember us as just a couple wretched snotty kids
In our younger days used to jump a train
Underlay underlay, if a guard come run away
When you come of age some things can't stay the same
It's safe to say you became a hard mate to face
And I ain't dissin' your world view
I happen to understand about how
You can catch me standing on that other planet as well
Dammed to a cell, bitch about my music
This verse is for you, even if you never listen to it

Hey how you doing?
How you been?
Shouldn't be this hard to say what I mean
I've been doing okay, I've been doing my thing
Going my way then chasing the dream
(Hey)
Hey how you doing?
How you been?
Shouldn't be this hard to say what I mean
I've been doing okay, I've been doing my thing
Going my way then chasing the dream
(Yeah yeah yeah)

Can't you see that this floozie is a hood rat?""
""True that, my apologies, Suzie, I'm too 
mag
git""
Ain't ever been smart, shit, I'm a retard
Creepin' in the back of every bar where I been barred
All I ever wanted was a cheap glass, sneak in a flask
Stop buyin' beer, I'm gettin' wild in here
""Pleased to meet you, my name is—oh shit
You got a dollar for another cold drink?"" (haha)
""Yeah, why not when all that's next up
Is a five-day week, the stress and headfucks, get crunk

This crown knows no halo
One day I'ma lay low and stay home
But till then, paint the town red
Till then we paint the town red (Hey)
All I know is some things forever change
I ain't gonna lie, I tried to self-medicate
Till then, paint the town red
Till then we paint the town red (Hey)

""I was a teen drunk off brew""
"" 'cause the streets is raw""

Cop this hot shit all up in your mosh pit
 drunk as fuck, 
Biggie bangin' on a jukebox, bitches wishin' it was U2
Jesse hangin' off a rooftop thinkin' he's too cool
Inside it's 2AM, lockin', poppin'
Outside mayhem's got dropkicks boxin'
Sounds like they've sent cops in to stop 'em
Now watch eight men stomp a hothead, squash the problem
Slay the conflict, spray the optics
Piggy-in-the-middle is a painful option
Pay the fine, they make the profit
All in the name of progress, it's nonsense
They ain't scared of the grog
Next Friday it's hair of the dog, yo
Care for a scotch on the town 
Smartarse alci like Charles Makowski, 

This crown knows no halo
One day I'ma lay low and stay home
But till then, paint the town red
Till then we paint the town red (Hey)
All I know is some things forever change
I ain't gonna lie, I tried to self-medicate
Till then, paint the town red

Okay
If you in a club
I advise you to put your drinks down
And head to the dance floor
Hey
Life's a bitch, she spiked my drink
Woke up in the morning like, ""ah shit""

Right
I got an angel on my shoulder sayin', ""Slow down
You gotta work in the morning, you should call it an evenin'""
While the devil's on the other sayin', ""Go hard
There's more liquor needs drinkin', don't you think about leavin'""
Which way do I go now? Caught in the struggle 'tween
Common sense and the content of a bottle, be
Spittin' these tunes while I'm swillin' the Stout
It's all tickety-boo till I figure it out, you know?

Yo, this crown it knows no halo
I lay low, scoutin' out a pouch to take home
Self-medicated, yo, I take it, just say so
If it helps me escape from whatever is painful
But I can feel that change is near
Yo, real cats face their fears, save your tears
I'ma make it clear and take you there
My naked stare's like  taming bears, you dig?

This crown knows no halo
One day I'ma lay low and stay home
But till then, paint the town red
Till then we paint the town red (Hey)

Easy,Foreverlution,2011,"And she said it was never meant to happen
But when it did I have to say it was pretty nice
Waking up in bed with the sun streaming in
Through the window instead of the city lights
It feels like one of those days when
Grief ain't even gonna touch your sights
And it feels like one of those days when
I'm gonna say I love my life
Coffee and a waffle looking like the body of a model
Bought my own genie and she's popping in the bottle
Every wish is so delicious
She's got me blowing kisses to my misses
There ain't no rain so we bound for the sea
Hang around with ice cream while we're down by the beach
Yo, for real, and I ain't fibbing, believe me
It doesn't get better than this, we keep it easy

I'ma chill, forget about the Monday morn'
Till it comes I'ma stay ballin'
We keep it easy like a Sunday morning
So, I'ma chill, forget about the Monday morn'
Till it comes I'ma stay ballin'
We keep it easy like a Sunday morning

Yo, I woke up late
Wipe the sleep from my eyes
No need for a shave, I don't need to be fly
But my girlfriend styley (yeah), I'm stepping outside
Such a wonderful sight, not a cloud in the sky
In love with the landscape, she said, ""What's the plan, babe?""
I thought for a second, smoked salmon and some pancakes
Start with the flat white, make mine a double shot
Mid afternoon, might swing by the bottle shop
Grab a six pack, layin' in the park (yeah)
Blazed as the daylight fades into dark
See an old man walking his dog, not hurrying
At all like he doesn't have a worry in the world
And as I sit back puffing my trees
I think to myself how lucky I be
I'm the luckiest son of the best mother that ever lived (yeah)
Yo, it doesn't get much better than this

I'ma chill, forget about the Monday morn'

I wanna be the bomb like my lines were combustable
Want you to sing along every time that I buss for you
I wanna work a job where my boss don't belittle me
Wanna be chillin' on a beach in the Philippines
Wanna kick these songs overseas with my killer team
Is it too much to wanna see some peace in the Middle East
Wanna see Israel stop it's occupation
I wanna see this hip-hop spread across the nation
Want it to be the biggest genre that we have to offer
I wanna set the benchmark the youngin seeks to conquer
I wanna be remembered as an honest man
Who never dogged his fam in a squabble over dollars

I wanna shed light like the sun in the sky
So bright I blind that dumb sucka that try smother my shine ()
Something I write that get stuck in your mind
So utterly fly you're up in a bind still wonderin' why
I wanna bring you back to nineteen-ninety-five
To catch Big L reciting tidy lines before he died in nineteen-ninety-nine
Rest in peace, best believe this style be mighty fine
Better check and see the fresh MC's, the type I idolise
When I bless my peeps and wish 'em the very best of destines
I wanna spread my seed and set sail to the seven seas
Wanna try , rest in peace to Charlie Sheen
Wanna crash the Reserve Bank and set the market free

Sorry, did I catch you at a bad time?
Do you mind if I take a seat?
I'm waiting for the train myself
King Street is the place I be
I hope you don't find this offensive
If I fall short of impressive
Courtship isn't my thing
So is that why you phone's more interesting?
Does that get your attention?
Now you're thinking I'm a lame jerk
Some guy saying a dumb line
To a fine young lady while she's just on her way to work
Okay, maybe it's out of line
So it's all cool if you got to go, but
If you got a small amount of time
I think you're beautiful, so I thought you oughta know

Truth is I feel sick till the minute when I see you
I see you sitting here waiting
Train's late, is it testing your patience? (don't stress)
You're the prettiest miss on the station
I'd give anything just to know what your name is (what's your name, girl?)

I shoot you a smile, that's my calling card

In this day and age it seems you're either old or original
Chase a dream, an eager bold individual
Can change a scene
Even roll with the pinnacle, raise the stakes, I don't keep the cream
Culture is digital, face the screen
Tweet the team, update the feed
Each golden minute is a wait and see
On what information is gonna bake your beans
And take the lead, he who creates the means
Leaves me to pay the fee
But I ain't sold on make believe
And I was told don't fake the steeze 
See my brain is free, I ain't cold or cynical
My soul is spiritual
I ain't false or critical, this pulse be livin' proof
I'll be a busy bee tryna keep my cool

When the whole world's gettin' busy with it
Wait a minute, I'm gettin' busy with it
We ain't finished, we gettin' busy with it
All work, no play, all night and day
When the whole world's gettin' busy with it
Wait a minute, I'm gettin' busy with it
We ain't finished, we gettin' busy with it
All work, no play, all night and day, come on

Now there's two ways to view this life
Get a super fly, stay paid in a suit and tie
I'll let you decide, better scrutinize
Everybody's tryna get theirs, do or die
And I don't wanna see it end in a suicide
The shit's hectic, 'Stressed kids, are you all right?'
You know money isn't everythin'
Still I try to get enough to break bread with my next of kin
I'd rather chill in the sun like a Mexican
Than climb the ladder of success 
So let's begin to break it down
Got oil? BP roll through, come and rape a town
Start drillin' in the soil of your sacred ground
Bringin' beef to the chief, they don't take his crown
That's the way that the  is
They'll invade or raid any village  interferes with their busyness

When the whole world's gettin' busy with it
Wait a minute, I'm gettin' busy with it
We ain't finished, we gettin' busy with it
All work, no play, all night and day
When the whole world's gettin' busy with it
Wait a minute, I'm gettin' busy with it
We ain't finished, we gettin' busy with it
All work, no play, all night and day, come on

Check the stash of party hats
Kind of heart attacks, snags full of artery fat
Sorry, but I'm sharper than that
Pardon my brand, this isn't a barbecue rap
Start a revolution in the backyard
Julian Assange and a couple fundametal rap stars
Tell you what the facts are
Just don't laugh at the stats unless you wanna grab a gas mask
I'ma shed light in these crazy times
Where the pace of life is 'bout as fast as a racin' car
Everybody's tryna make their mark, raise the bar
But strain too hard, it could break your heart
Your fake facade you crush for fun,  made to last
With suckas comin' up  soundin' underdone
Son,  the thunder has just begun
Gettin' busy to a motherfuckin' number one

When the whole world's gettin' busy with it

I bring you back, sit your ass right down
I bring you back, lemme bring you back right now
For you

No one could  in my terrible twos
To tell the truth I wouldn't even level witchu
Indeed, me, me, me was a general rule
Mum was like, ""Please, I need sleep, I'm beggin' you, dude""
She'd do anything to get me to snooze
Fed me alphabet soup, bought vegetable stew
Inedible goop, you can bet I refused
'Cause the spew was inevitable, yeah
And while dad was watchin' Rocky films
Picture me wit' a box of buildin' blocks, slobberin' on orange peels
Schemin', what's the deal? Need my bottle filled, speak to Dr. Phil
But I couldn't reach the hospital till chickenpox got me, ew
And you can bet I got lots of thrills
Popsicles, lollipops all up in this toddlers grills
Redskins were rocket fuel, Milko's were optional
You could buy a Python for less than a dollar bill

That I loved getting carried away

Tryna be the best baddest BMX bandit
Ridin' no handed, tryna chuck a wheelie
Vibin', hopin' that the fuzz didn't see me
Mum's was a genie, whippin' up the illest food (Ye-huh)
But she would never let us eat it in the living room
We spent summers in the next door swimmin' pool
Dive bombers, suckers like, ""Move  gimme room""
Playin' cricket in the driveway
But if you scratched dad's whip you were bound to catch a tirade (Ah shit)
Me and my mates flippin' off the neighbourhood jocks
We had it locked like the Neighbourhood Watch
But nowadays the neighbourhood's hot, kids  pills
Shit, I was trill with a Bubble O' Bill
A bag of marbles, fans of the monkey magic
You couldn't imagine all the fun we had, we take it

Little Athletics  hundred-meter sprint
Scooby was the dude, and we were droppin' Bomberman
Mortal Kombat, FIFA Soccer was the jam, Shaq
Was the man in the picture sittin' on my mantlepiece (yeah, yeah)
With a couple 411 magazines, yo
Kickies in the cardboard, ollies over Coke cans
Ridin' 'round the block mad stoked to have no plan

As a kid after school, this is how we might do (Tell 'em)
Buzzin' with my cousin playin' Street Fighter 2 (Yeah)
With the shell suits and undercut, some sported mullets (Suckers)
Basketball trading cards, Jordan was wanted
 was blunted, but we never watched M*A*S*H
Mike Jack's ""Thriller"" clip had the city on smash

It's fair to state haters get it pear-shaped
This music is my aeroplane
My wingspan embraces outward bound flights
Pirate airways no place for downtime
How high is a bird's-eye view?
The sky is fair game, so when it curves I cruise (You know it)
Surfin' the heavens, I ain't waitin' for the take-off
Top of the world with Hendrix and Nate Dogg
Tuk's on a hustle, homie, en route
To your house while my one and only love is lonely
So remind me, avoid all booby traps
I'ma get whacked off Scooby Snacks
I ain't robbin' banks, though, I'm here to rock a stage show
I make my safe way home (Let's go)

The captains of this next flight be we
Flashing, mile high steeze on the beat
Pay attention, crews get ready for the take-off
Ain't no telling where this journey's gonna take us
The captains of this next flight be we
Flashing, mile high steeze on the beat
Pay attention, crews get ready for the take-off
Ain't no telling where this journey's gonna take us

Ayo, I'm in it for my lifetime, fuck the limelight
Leave an outline of five giant mic's when I skywrite
Mile high star from a deadset captain
No need for the stressin', leave your excess baggage at the check-in
We got the jet engines revvin'
On the 747, now servin' refreshments
The freshmen smashin' letters, who here's rapping better?
Hijacked your flight and feel a rise in the cabin pressure

I got a 4 AM alarm ever ready by my bedside
Check into a red-eye with red eyes, let's fly
We get high amongst the clouds, sightseeing
Taking in the homeland till we be touchin' down
Run up on your town, saying ""What up?"" in each state
Bustin' out the cage, watch as scenes change
We meet peace face-to-face, try to connect the dots
And bless the spot before jettin' off",https://genius.com/Thundamentals-captains-lyrics

M—m—m—mind's aligned with higher guidance, flyer than fighter pilots
I'm like a fire, light up the sky with the vibrance (pick it up now)

They finally succumb to gum diseases if they decide to try it
I'll beat that buzzer beater (beater),  off my sneaker (sneaker)
Once it's clean enough I'm g'in' up the puffin' of the reefer
I love my cheeba at least as much as Cheech does
Indeed I'll munch , I'm like a piece of fuckin' pizza
Stuff a preacher, I ain't up for bluffin'

Jeswon, the opposite of a rapper that's rockin' shit for brains
Gu—gu—gu—gu—guess what? I have never been in this for the glitz and fame
No to whips and chains, survivin' off the minimum wage, we're winnin' the race
A million different ways to end up in the same spot
So we take off just like the Doc, Emmett sayin', ""Great Scott!""
Jet in the DeLorean, legends I'm applaudin'
Enthrallin' the audience with a  performance
The panhandlin' paupers that manhandle the fraudulent
Fantabulous formulas, black magic for sorcerers
Puttin' an end to a whack rapper who poorly flips
Call it quits thanks to my cantankerous authorship
This moment of clarity cut through the cacophony
And suckers who drop it sloppy, not rockin' the spot properly
Honey's are flockin' while these knobbies are cockblockin' me
Knockin' me (why?), 'cause obviously we're hot property, yo

There ain’t no way you’re gonna stop my right of way
Ain’t no way you’re getting’ stomped out right away
There ain’t no way while I ride away
We can either tear the roof off or we can burn it down

I been kickin' the dope phrase since back in the old days (yep)
When I would do shows for little to no pay
The king of the stone age is spittin’ that propane
Ya wanna test, Jes? Forget it, there’s no way
José, I ain’t slangin’ that cocaine
But can still bring the funk like a junk to your nose cave
When will a chump smell the roses, my bouquet
Is potent, one whiff and the crowd’s goin’, “Olé”
Bravo, they wantin’ an encore
If not, no ruckus, we show ‘em the front door
What you wanna front for when you know that there's quality?
My style’s more Aussie than Volleys or rock-wallabies
Stoppin’ me, your chances are slim to none
From here to kingdom come, I’ma give you some
That’s a cut above, sucka MC’s gettin’ sucker punched
A hundred bucks says they can’t run with the thunderous

We can either tear the roof off or we can burn it down

If you’re nothin’ but a flippin’ tool (you’re a spanner in the works)
I’ma come stubborn as a frickin' mule (no doubt )
You say you’re deep, but you’re jumpin’ in a kiddy pool
Doggy paddle in the shallows if you think it’s cool ()
So long to a sucker, who wanna rock it proper
Like Tuka? I wonder why some  ()
Top Gunners here to run things, I’m a Hummer
You’re a stunned fish who shudder when the drum hits, yo, I punch in
Like a eight-oh-eight, ain’t no way you ever
Let the fake rotate, a-okay ()
 fresher than the average, has-beens
Jealous when their records end up in the attics still in plastic
Classics, only got remembered when they spoke up
Yo, I won’t budge if a critic don’t show love
No buts, I plan action while most bluff
So 

There ain’t no way you’re gonna stop my right of way
Ain’t no way you’re getting’ stomped out right away

I used to see you every weekend, me and you
We used to be friends, it’s true, these days we pretend that we’re cool
But let's be fair, don’t be fooled, I still think you rule
I just miss you dude, fuck a picture on the internet, yo, I need living proof
And heaven only knows if life is an interlude
Juliet and Romeo never got the time to pick and choose
Until it’s adios I’ll be here, yo, what’s happening?

Searching for something
Yearning for someone, then all of a sudden
They’re right there in front of you like you got the sun in your eye
Ayy, ""Love is blind, keep your eyes on me""
Yeah, that’s what she said
In the middle of nowhere, surrounded by strangers
Lemme tell you that I never felt so fuckin' inspired to go there
Shake it like sugar, salt, pepper and spice
Put the flavour on the table like peppermint slice
And for the sake of entertainment, save complaining for the haters
Put a label on it later, I’m not taking advice
And they can say what they like thinking we might listen
To the hype, piff it, look up to the sky, we’re mad nice with it
Flyer than a kite ribbon, vibe with me
Send me a ticket to never-never land, I’ll be there in five minutes

And you’re never actin' bad or boujee, a-ya-ya
‘Cause yeah that’s shout out to your parents, yeah, they raised you all right
And even if you’re actin' moody, I could roll a dooby
Doin' everything I can to put a smile on your dial
Yeah, it’s been a long week so come and kick it with me
Grab a Sauvignon Blanc or a cinnamon tea
I’m a stoner and you hate it, hope you know that you’re amazing
‘Cause you kept me motivated when I didn’t believe
I’m at peace, before I met you I was holdin' my breath
They told me home is where the heart is, well I guess I found a home in your head

Yeah, I feel like a dickhead, yeah, I feel like a dickhead, yo, that’s par for the course
I was asleep on that comatose, but I awoke from that overdose
You were one in a million, that’s what I thought, though I got cold feet, I got frozen toes
Just as sure as the cold wind blows, can’t feel my face, you’re that dose of coke, better blow my nose
But my nose done grown, I told more lies than Pinocchio
But that’s just life when your life’s on drugs, tried to hold you close but I can’t quite cope
Yo, I might just ghost, hit the open road, somewhere so remote, no remote controls
No DVD’s, flat screen TV’s, plus no 4G for my mobile phone
I just write quotes from my mobile home, the homeboys gloat like, 'I told you so'

Cold facts you’re just into for a quick fix, soul clap, I’m in it 'cause I think you are a big deal
I swear an angel answered my prayers, she came to my aid when she saw the pain on my face
Now she’s standing right there, running her hand through my hair, saving my grace
And healing my wounds, she is my queen bee, speaking my truth, I dare
You can place your feet in my shoes indeed, you can even have the keys to my room, it’s free, see if I care
Yeah, best believe that I do, take a look in these eyes, they're lookin' at you
I’m right here, I hope you don’t mind when I stare, I’ve been gettin' ideas, gettin' hooked on that view, “like yeah”
My God, my gosh, there we are at it again, I guess, yeah
You’ll be leaving once you get what you want, but to be honest that is never quiet clear

I still can’t rely on your love
So I’m brushin' the dirt off my shoulders
I guess I was high off the buzz
I was drunk, now I’m searching for sober
I guess that I overdosed
I guess that I overdosed
I guess that I overdosed
I guess that I overdosed

Catch Me If You Can,I Love Songs,2018,"Remember when you said to me
That everything would be all right
Up all night
We could build a symphony
When you’re by my side (By my side)
Imperfect symmetry
Just you an I
Can rest in peace when I close my eyes

I hope you know that you’re gorgeous
Your thoughts are important, I'm pickin' you up when you’ve fallen
You’re textin' my celly at four in the mornin'
Your friends are all jelly but we just ignore them
Let’s get spaghetti on Norton
Callin' ahead just to order a portion
They think I’m ballin', my whip ain't a foreign
Plus I got no petty, I guess that we’re walkin'
Moral of the story
You don’t need a Porsche to be totally flossy
Whenever I'm with you I feel like a million
Bucks, 'cause our love is worth more than a fortune

I’ve been here before
If I only knew it then
What I know now is not for sure
Catch me if you can
I’ve been here before

Everybody needs love, please don’t be setting me up
Don’t setting me up, nobody needs that
Got me on a lock an key latch, hey
I just wanna relax
I wanna blow smoke when I roll up
Wanna get stoned, we can get high
I wanna go float, that’s how I get by, hey
It’s Friday
Let’s vibe, babe, be my babe
I wanna see you shine
'Cause your light is so vibrant

World’s Gone Mad,I Love Songs,2018,"I always wanted I can’t have, tryna rise above it
Wish I had it better planned now, feels like I’ma plummet
Dragging round my dragons man down, find me the mud
Something 'bout the way you stand out, diamonds in the rough
Shinin' brighter than a spotlight, baby, sign me up
Maybe we can make up lost time, guess I’ll try my luck
Keep it moving, keep ya clock wise, you been kinda stuck
Up inside my mind my whole life, not just tryna fuck
This up

The world’s gone mad
Try to stay chill
And remember that I love you, ayy
I don’t wanna, I don’t wanna fuck this up
No

Ayo
While they keep it one hundred, I’ma keep it one trillion
Couldn’t give two fucks if we coppin' a million
And one hits on this shit or none this is a hit and run
And I’ma rock while I’m on this rock that be spinnin' round the sun

I remember feeling guilt free, being younger thinkin'
One day I’ma need to build me something outta nothin'
Someday in the future we’ll see what’s up in the cupboard
Heaven only knows what will be until then I’ma bluff it
Tonight I think I might chill in Cinderella’s pumpkin
You wanna see some wine spill? Fill a fellas cup
She already had her eyes peeled, must of seen me coming
Real recognise real, not just tryna fuck
This up

The world’s gone mad
Try to stay chill
And remember that I love you, ayy
I don’t wanna, I don’t wanna fuck this up
No

Ayo
While they keep it one hundred, I’ma keep it one trillion
Couldn’t give two fucks if we coppin' a million

And I’ma rock while I’m on this rock that be spinnin' round the sun

Ayy, ayy, yeah
I’m tryna chill, girl, I don’t wanna fuck it, pardon my French, I'm like pardon my cussin'
Go halves in a dart, let’s start a discussion, come back to my crib, I don’t party in public
Open your heart let my glimpse at your luggage, I'm into your baggage, ‘cause everyone has it
They pick at your bones like a circling buzzard, you workin on life’s occupational hazards
Shout to my Dad, you’re the reason I does it, pourin' a cup for the dearly departed
Swillin' it up, let it spill on the carpet, I’m crushin a pill, shit is keepin' me dusted
All that I have are these moments of passion, I could go deep or just skeet on your stomach
End of the day it’s a stain on the mattress, pleasure and pain as we peak at the summit
Simple and plain I’m just speakin on somethin', hard to maintain while these heathens are frontin'
I’m wiping my brain, deletin' my worries, everythin' changed, I’m believin' in nothin'
How can I sleep when my people are sufferin'? Dodging my demons, this cheeba I'm puffin'
Nuttin' but grief when you look in my cupboards, but peace to your lovin', put nothing above it

The world’s gone mad
Try to stay chill
And remember that I love you, ayy
I don’t wanna, I don’t wanna fuck this up
No

Ayo
While they keep it one hundred, I’ma keep it one trillion
Couldn’t give two fucks if we coppin' a million

Wh—While they keep it one hundred, I’ma keep it one trillion

And one hits on this shit or none this is a hit and run

Shoot The Breeze,I Love Songs,2018,"When we're camping on Christmas Day
With a doobie full of weed
The trees had some things to say
I listened to them shoot the breeze, and
Underneath the shade, 
I use their leaves to help me breath
Underneath the shade, 
I use their leaves to help me breath
When we're camping on Christmas Day
With a doobie full of weed
The trees had some things to say
I listened to them shoot the breeze and
Underneath the shade, 
I use their leaves to help me breath
Underneath the shade, 
I use their leaves to help me breath

Wanna talk about the most high? Salute the sun is the motto I go by
Since day one, mama been getting it done, it's dawn, she’s out, it’s showtime
Blessing it up, but what do I know, right? I’m not so bright, I’m a simple man
Every morning I wake up with my fickle thoughts and my dick in hand
So here I’m am in the here and now, my own reflection weirds me out
Will this bag of bones just stand alone until I steer it round
Around we go, I’ll work these gears I’ve found, I’ll clean it, feed it
Find it a bed to sleep with then repeat the sequence until they tag my toes
For years it’s housed this monkey mind inside my head, he likes brag and boast
About his fears and doubts, he likes to remind me why he's there
Some nights we stare at nothing long enough he loses concentration
Tonight I’m in the middle of nowhere viewin’ constellations

When we're camping on Christmas Day
With a doobie full of weed
The trees had some things to say
I listened to them shoot the breeze and
Underneath the shade, 
I use their leaves to help me breath
Underneath the shade, 
I use their leaves to help me breath
When we're camping on Christmas Day
With a doobie full of weed
The trees had some things to say
I listened to them shoot the breeze and
Underneath the shade, 
I use their leaves to help me breath
Underneath the shade, 
I use their leaves to help me breath

We laid for hours in the flowers
Underneath the shade

If a tree falls in a forest, but ain’t no one there to witness
Does it even make a noise? And does that really make a difference?
I can hear these philosophic topics blossom in the wind
On the path to droppin' knowledge , you just gots to listen in
Life’s a trip, it’s like the more I learn the less I understand
A random series of events or are we following a plan?
I need to bounce, pick up the fam, they’re pissed, like they can’t hardly see
I see the coppers in the distance, tryna dodge their RBT
I don’t wanna lose my P’s, roll up to the spot like half past three
Got crew round me, kick off my shoes and move my feet
I must admit I’m feelin free, it feels so sweet to be away
Green up in my DNA, we smoke these trees to ease our pain

When we're camping on Christmas Day
With a doobie full of weed
The trees had some things to say
I listened to them shoot the breeze and
Underneath the shade, 
I use their leaves to help me breath
Underneath the shade, 
I use their leaves to help me breath
When we're camping on Christmas Day
With a doobie full of weed
The trees had some things to say
I listened to them shoot the breeze and
Underneath the shade, 
I use their leaves to help me breath
Underneath the shade, 
I use their leaves to help me breath

We laid for hours in the flowers

I ain't gonna lie girl
'Cause right now I feel stressed as shit
Hit me up with that SMS, trippin' off ya mixed messages
Heading straight for that precipice, sittin' right on the edge of it
You ain't ever gonna let me in, little dose of that medicine
For real, 'cause our love is the bitterest pill
Should I reconnect with my ex chick on that Netflix and chill
We could get reckless or build, it’s a head-trip and I’d kill
Just to heal myself, tryna free myself of this wretchedness that I feel
And it’s relevant to my health, I’m much better off on my own, still
I’m knockin' up on your door, I suppose that you wasn’t home
And I guess that we’ll never know, this mystery’s better left unsolved

But that doesn’t mean
I’ma feel better about it, neglected, yeah
I would'a been better without it, reckless
Yeah (uh), still tryna see
Why I allowed it, I haven’t quiet figured it out yet
Lost in a dream, sleeping with doubts, like 'what does it mean?'
I guess I never learnt my lesson, yeah
Whatever happened to magic?
Never counting the hours down when we had it
But then it went south, it went sour
We curdled the cream just like lemons, yeah

Boots,I Love Songs,2018,"All the fam keep tellin' me
To respect, better pay my dues
Sayin' who needs enemies
When a man got a mate like you?
I’ma use my energy
To escape, I’ma make my moves
Lace my shoes, snakes try to walk this path
But we ain't got the same size boots
I can see man’s jealousy
Still I know that they rate my tunes
Sayin' who needs enemies
When a man got a mate like you?
I’ma use my energy
To escape, I’ma make my moves
Lace my shoes, snakes try to walk this path
But we ain't got the same size boots

Find me creepin' in the streets in a fresh pair
Tryna blow a breeze on the scene like I’m fresh air
They gimme praise to my face, “You’re the best here”
But when I jet from the place get a death stare, shit’s weird
This year coppin' bare trouble when I step
Man are vexed ‘cause I got an air bubble in my crepes
You wouldn’t wanna bet ‘gainst a motherfuckin vet
I could run up on your set, dog, dun it till it’s dead blood
Burn 'em like a piff, ain’t a motherfuckin' thing
If you following a trend get to jumping off a cliff
You are not on my lev', you rock a size ten
Put your feet in my kicks, it ain't ever gonna fit
You ain't never gonna win, generic as a bish
Man, I’m wicked with the pen on that limited edish
We fresh out the box, mash up the mosh
While you and your whole clique left pissin' in the wind

All the fam keep tellin' me
To respect, better pay my dues

I’ma use my energy
To escape, I’ma make my moves
Lace my shoes, snakes try to walk this path
But we ain't got the same size boots

Let me talk about jealously, let me talk about jealously
I only ever supported you
You were a friend to me, you were important
Remember you said to me
Never dwell on your enemies
This is when it gets awkward 'cause you were
My mentor essentially, someone I trusted
You fucked it, you’re dead to me, end of discussion
Uh, pasty motherfucker named Tuk, pay up
Motherfucker, I'm ill since day one, jack pot
I will run game, sucker, make money
Say something, baby, you can bank on it, jack pot
When I shake on it I'ma put faith in it
Fake frontin’ get shamed quicker than crack pot
Haters gonna hate but it won’t change nothing
Lame puppets cop the shade from my backdrop

All the fam keep tellin' me
To respect, better pay my dues
Sayin' who needs enemies
When a man got a mate like you?

My Favourite Song,Sleeping On Your Style,2009,"Yo it's the feeling when I rise getting touched by the suns rays
It's getting high puffin haj on a Sunday
Grub when I'm hungry, threads that are comfy
Affection I get from the people that love me
A hug from my lovely, bacon and eggs
The smell in the kitchen when she's baking us bread
The revelation of a phrase in my head
Expression of my depths to the day that I'm dead
It's the way that we step, never faking for ends
To pause for a second, inhaling a breath
If life is a game then I'm placing my bets
On the heads from the TM breaking the trends
Getting blazed with your friends
Kicks with fat laces
It's anyone that’s into berating the damn racists
Staircases that are covered in graff
To all the baseball jackets that have covered my back
Yo it's the feeling that takes over when I'm freaking a stage show
Appreciation of a piece on the railroad
The rhythm of the beat out the MPC
And my lyrics when I speak and they set me free

Down by the beach, taking it in
These are a few of my favourite things
My girl and the taste of her lips
These are a few of my favourite things
My world how amazing it is, you know we just taking it in
These are a few of my favourite things

First off the mountains, kids from the cliff tops
My family, my friends and my peeps who love hip-hop
We got Tribe Called Quest, Jehst, Mos Def
Add Talib Kweli that’s Black Star no less
Pharcyde, Big L, Madlib, J Dilla
Amy Winehouse and the Ghostface Killah
Radiohead, Pegz, Atmosphere
That guy Sage is OK, but his rap is just weird
This is just a bit of music that I hold dear
While I'm chilling in the sun sipping cold beer (Ah Yeah)
My cap, check it, it's blacker than jet
My girl in bed feeling her breath on the back of my neck
Smacking a set, street art and wisdom
Playing Alex the kid on my master system
Mark Johnson, David Lynch, Bill Hicks, Twin Peaks
Tre flips perfectly placed and crisp clean
Payday, honesty, world peace ideology
Noam Chomsky identifying my philosophy
Rap, sex, weed and GTA
And the feeling I get when I hear my CD played
It go

Down by the beach, taking it in
These are a few of my favourite things
My girl and the taste of her lips
These are a few of my favourite things
My world how amazing it is, you know we just taking it in
These are a few of my favourite things
These are a few of my favourite things
These are a few of my favourite things",https://genius.com/Thundamentals-my-favourite-song-lyrics

Our lingo's as loco as the granny at the bingo
Been bitten by a nymphonous
Been savaged by a dingo
My stats and the info
They're well documented
This shit's locked
I'm iller till hip hop's relentless
It won't stop till I stop
I won't stop till it stops
So here's to the prospects we twist off and twist on
And rips off with more vivid images than Hitchcock
You think not
Then how come we're getting this disc drop
But I wanna see this bitch copping heavy rotation
That's why I'm ever-ready with the clever quotations
Stereo basement
Fiends for the crackle of the sample

Crushed like a stampede that rhymes with cuss

I'm a cunning linguist
Spare me a couple minutes
And I'll share my monkey business
I'm a funky misfit
Wild like a pack of lions
Got these rappers silent
Like they've contracted laryngitis
Don't be acting violent cause I'm set to make new stuff
Robbie Williams, let this ape dude entertain you
I demonstrate smooth
I rock a castro
On any brake used
I explain what I know
Not a maestro but a poet dropping nice flows
So fly, floating sky high
Skip a time zone
Hit your flight home
Get your mind blown like TNT
Just tryna get you the right frequency
Frequntly insisting you all come freak with me

Create the speech and place it tastefully
I carve a niche in each page I see
Maybe one day I'll be saying something that inspire you
Thanks to peeps who keep the faith in me and what I'm tryna do
Full stop, capital I
Hip to the hop
Light rappers alight
Spit it from a clifftop
Smashin' the mic and gettin' trapped in the storm
Welcome to the Thunda dome
I'm the hammer of thought

I won't shatter your thoughts
Kickin' ill vernac

Four gorillas in the mix here to kill the track
We wield the axe
Fake rappers feel the wrath
Yo I suggest that you tip your hat
Cause we can compare skills and get tit for tat
Tat for tit
My gift of gab's on some plastic shit
You'll probably chat about this to your grandkids

Move It Up,Sleeping On Your Style,2009,"Yes yes I'm a play it by ear
We ain't gonna leave yo we're staying right here
Going out to my people with the same idea
Move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up
Yes yes I'm a play it by ear
We ain't gonna leave yo we're staying right here
Going out to my people with the same idea
Move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up
From my birth to the coffin, my words are an offering
My doctrine illegitimate alternate option
And anybody frontin' like they rugged and raw
When will a sucker realise they're saying nothing at all
And the fellas that want to flex, plenty that want to ball
And sweatin' up on the check, I'm representing the cause
I'm doing this for the love I'm doing this for the hate
Doin' it for this minute that's never coming again
Bussin' the phrase is here to take you up and away
It's Thundamentals in the place and we got something to say
The day that I don't well that'll be the moment I'm out
No walking my mouth I know just what I'm talking about
I'm talking about the struggles of an average bloke
With no time to sit back and watch his cannabis grow
'Cos there's too many dreams that I got to achieve
So get used to my features I'm not gonna leave you, believe
Yes yes I'm a play it by ear
We ain't gonna leave yo we're staying right here
Going out to my people with the same idea
Move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up
I need a couple minutes of your time (Why's that?)
'Cos I got a little something on my mind (Like what?)
It seems some of these people who are livin' the life
Are kind of bitter like they've been licking the lime (My God)
Gotta be smarter than that, I know it's hard to adapt
That won't pardon the wack, and only harbour the fact
Of the matter I'ma passin the rap it's all attached to the pad
In the lab where I'm practicing grammar
Ask the same questions get the usual answers
Vain intentions or delusions of grandeur
My main suggestion is be who you are man
Do you need what you can't have? Got love, got that
A lot of money in the world doesn't change shit
The search for happiness is underrated
A lot of nonsense is un-debated
Unfazed as long as we get payed
Fuck ups get covered in red tape
Yes yes I'm a play it by ear
We ain't gonna leave yo we're staying right here
Going out to my people with the same idea
Move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up
Yes yes I'm a play it by ear
We ain't gonna leave yo we're staying right here
Going out to my people with the same idea
Move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up
Live and let live 'til I reach the grave
Yo I came here with nothin' Imma leave the same
I got all I need to maintain and get by
Any petty shit I'm prepared to let slide
Live and let live 'til I reach the grave
Yo I came here with nothin' Imma leave the same
And as the seasons change I won't lose my head
On a life long mission just to do my best, yes yes
Yes yes I'm a play it by ear
We ain't gonna leave yo we're staying right here
Going out to my people with the same idea
Move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up
Yes yes I'm a play it uy ear
We ain't gonna leave yo we're staying right here

Sleeping On Your Style,Sleeping On Your Style,2009,"It's that
Thundamentalist, boom-bap heavy shit
Penning these gems in the age of Aquarius
Mind-state's perilous, dialect's derelict
Heretic armed with the text like a terrorist
Rhymes I develop climb high like Everest
Even if they're sleeping on your style like a sedative
Remember when cats said, ""Jes you lack melanin
To make it rapping"", tow them fellas are backpedalin'
Heaven-sent words in my tracks set precedents
Sorta like elections of the first black president
I burn whack messages, learned that from Seraphin
Challenging my energy, annihilate rhetoric
Strikingly evident, precise with the evidence
Eloquence fresh from the edge of the precipice
Soul like a reverend, dawn the new era in
I'm tryna take it to a place where it's never been
Time for the reckoning, I'm choosing to flip that
Nuclear script that could loosen your grip, kids
Lace up your shoes tight, my movement is swift
Make moves by the moonlight, the lunar eclipse set to
Block out the solar
I stare down my foes with a stone-cold glare like a polar
Bear, fuck a square, son, I'm outside the box
Couldn't give a toss if y'all wanna get down or not, 'cause

Even if they're sleeping on your style like a sedative
Develop it, don't take it as a negative
That should never be affecting it
Just try and take it to a place where it's never been
Even if they're sleeping on your style like a sedative
Develop it, don't take it as a negative
That should never be affecting it
Just try and take it to a place where it's never been

I'll seduce Mother Earth, I'll flirt with she-demons
I'll burn the streets down, scream ""word"" to Team Sequence
I burst these speakers when I flex textiles
Get the heads dialed, it's that shit you wanna X-File
I'll chill like reptiles, and sit in the sun
I spit projectiles like I triggered a gun
Run my lip with a rip of my lung
More villainous than Attila the Hun, I'm the rhythm hittin' the skin of the drum (kick it)
No what if, this is it
Deliver the beat, I'm bringing the heat, flipping a speech, slitting ya gizzards
Giving ya blisters, I whistle blizzards, lightning, thunder and flames
Whistle killer twisters, summon the hurricanes
Tuk's the name, I'm not chasing a tail, it be
Serendipity creating this tale for me
Full circle, I'm blazing a trail
Winds of perfect symmetry inflating my sails
Overtaking the snails, pick up the pace
This be the haste of life
Overstand but understate, yo, I take my time
Tryna foresee more than the naked eye
On the ball and chain from the drought to the falling rain
To the cloud that absorbs my brain
To them played-out fuckers that sound all the same
To the true heads bound for the hall of fame, it go

Even if they're sleeping on your style like a sedative
Develop it, don't take it as a negative
That should never be affecting it
Just try and take it to a place where it's never been
Even if they're sleeping on your style like a sedative

The Mash,Sleeping On Your Style,2009,"""Oh, I love being loved""
I say

""Oh, I love being loved""
It's only just begun
""Oh, I love being loved""
It's only just begun
""Oh, I love being loved""

Long legs in a short skirt, fox set makes it all work
Loss for words when I first saw her, had me dreaming of hot sex in the dawn sir
Okay, this just maybe my brains imaginations way of sayin'
""I'm taken by this icy honey, she's so amazing""
She's got me acting funny, try not to play the fool
Nervous in chasing my first girlfriend back in the days of school
Those days was cool, but now they're done and dusted, I'm an older man
Dawn 'til dust, we can talk and stuff, she might even hold my hand
The scene was set down by the beach, she had no need for clothes
Just a green bikini and the sand between her toes
Ill DJs  dropping tracks, I asked her
""Do you wanna dance?"" She said, ""let's get funky to the 'Monster Mash'!""
She grabbed me by the hand, we moved over to the music
She had a smile on her face, that made me wanna lose it
I tried to keep it smooth, but I couldn't stop staring at the
Way she moved in all that skin, what she was wearing
""They did the mash""

Hit to the mix, within a minute, we freakin' with it, we did it to the beef in this picture
Me sitting on the beach, sippin' cheap liquor, kissin' the sweet vixen, thinking ""this is pretty neat ""
And I'ma keep kicking on, breaka-break of dawn, shake that bomb body-body when I play this song
Can't fake the vibe, they tryna waste my time, so by the end of the night I'ma make you mine, it's like

Don't go when the nights not over, in fact it's just begun
I'm still kinda sober, it's time to have some fun
So now that I've approached ya, what would you like to do?
Are those eyes for me? I got a hunch that might be true

Oh, I love being loved
Oh, I love being loved
Oh, I love being loved
Oh, I love being loved

(Como te amamos)
I seen her on the beach doing fire twirls
I thought ""this chick could ignite up my world""
Tripping out a six just might unfurl
But one thing's for sure, I know I like this girl
She was cool as a Hula Hooper, her could be so super-duper
Wishing that my moves was smoother, So I could put down my 
mood
 maneuver
Girl moved by the light of the moon, with a smile that could light up a room, thought I might introduce, cause the feelin' is par for the view, 
 first things first 
, She must have smelt the aroma
Cause now she's heading over, she had a scent like a bed of roses, Well it  with the sexy poses, she took a 
toast
 said ""My name's Selena""
Part Spanish like Philipina, this mamacita drunk margaritas
She had an apple bomb that was so 
bendita",https://genius.com/Thundamentals-the-mash-lyrics
My Lady,Sleeping On Your Style,2009,"It went down like this
I was like sup miss, see it's nice to meet ya
Can I buy you a drink or a slice of pizza
She said fine lime with some nice tequilas
Then I thought to myself yeah this dime's a keeper
I said ya vibin' creature but she tamed the beast
She ever walked out it'd make me weak
Although I know that you're down cause it's plain to see
But if this shit turns out the change a beat
Blatantly me I'm a lady b
On our love boat steeze seven days a week
Any secret she keeps yeah it's safe with me
There's no need to peep girl, blaze a tree
Let your brain release, relax yourself
Cause I wanna know what affection you stack the shelf
Now it overflows, honey don't you know
If your love was a drug I woulda overdosed

You could be my lady
More than a one-night-stand
Just take my hand
We'll be hanging on the daily
You could be my lady
More than a one-night-stand
Just take my hand
We'll be hanging on the daily

You act like ya never been kissed
This one chance'll be my pleasure sweet lips
I'm sure they're not virgin lips
I best leave it for the page of sweet journalists
From you I could learn a bit
Help on the search of eternal bliss
Damn girl you're like an image of all perfectness
Let me take your picture, make it permanent
Service is not bad, I'm the usual guy
Daddy wouldn't see me as a suitable type
Just wanna get inside your beautiful mind
See these pity stains understand you're more than a pretty face
For pity's sake I mean the days I don't know
I wanna say hello but choke when you go by
Oh my I'm a sucker with no chance
Or is this your summer of romance

You could be my lady
More than a one-night-stand
Just take my hand
We'll be hanging on the daily
You could be my lady
More than a one-night-stand
Just take my hand
We'll be hanging on the daily
You could be my lady
More than a one-night-stand
Just take my hand
We'll be hanging on the daily
You could be my lady
More than a one-night-stand
Just take my hand
We'll be hanging on the daily

It's circumstance, you see
Puts you per chance with me
Just take a chance maybe
You could be my lady
Dance ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay

You could be my lady
More than a one-night-stand
Just take my hand
We'll be hanging on the daily
You could be my lady
More than a one-night-stand
Just take my hand
We'll be hanging on the daily",https://genius.com/Thundamentals-my-lady-lyrics
El Mundo,Sleeping On Your Style,2009,"Things fall apart, especially all the neat order of rules and laws. The way we look at the world is the way we really are. Climb to a higher plateau and you'll see plunder and murder. Truth and beauty are in the eye of the beholder. I stopped trying to figure everything out a long time ago.

The world
The world
It's your world—world—world
The world
It's your—yours
The world
It's your world, it's yours
The world
World, it's your-your-your world

Seventy percent water, thirty percent land
Fifty-two percent woman, forty-eight percent man
It's a given, it's humble, it's ego-driven
It's a mother hustler, it's a troubled ecosystem
Ayo, it's heavy, it's weightless, it's deadly and it hates us
 suffocated by the  tryna make it pay us it's own
Six-and-a-half billion human inhabitants
Usually ravenous, consuming everything this planet is
Something I try to say before it hibernates
It's wide awake while you hide in cyberspace
It's the yin, it's the yang, it's grateful and it's bratty
It's a big, it's a bang, it's tasteful and it's tacky
It's madly in love, it's more than a clever poem
It's all of the above, plus all I've ever known
It's the victories that have rewritten history
But two thirds can't read it 'cause they lack the literacy

The world
It's your world-world, your, yours
The world
It's your, yours
The world
It's your world, it's your-yours
The world
It's your-your-your world

Has the world begun to rise?
Has the world begun to rise?

If I have to sum it all up, it's the sum of all parts
It's the love that pumps through some of your hearts
It's a cold place, promise by the time that I'm done
I'ma donate something that can brighten it up
Live from the third rock as it shifts and it rotates
We know better, but there's things that we won't change
There's no way we're givin' up our cars or our tellies
While the other half starves, no carbs for their bellies, I
Guess we shoulda listened to a chief in his teepee
Who said what we need is the shade from the trees' leaves
But we've endangered the species
And in the future, I can't blame peeps if they see me
As a murderer, they'll pro'bly be cursin' us
For pollution the air with all this shit that we're burning up
Times are turbulent, that's why I'm tryna make a change
'Fore this whole place fades to grey, that's what I'm saying, it's the world

The world
It's your world-world, your, yours
The world
It's your, yours
The world
It's your world, it's your-yours
The world
It's your-your-your world

Has the world begun to rise?

We Won't Mind,Sleeping On Your Style,2009,"So when another day come, another day spent
It might take some time before we make cents
I just pay rent, I wouldn't call me savvy, though
It's just me on a patio with a tall pack of tally hoes
And it goes a little something like
Thinking about a subtle vibe on this summer's night
There's something in the air like freedom in my lung
Makes me wonder why there's not a reason I'm not seeing Sweden 
Or mundane, someday
Yo, we'll travel the seven seas, never stay in one place
Right now wishing I was leaving my town
Responsibility killin' me, dreaming of not being tied down
Wanna wind down, misses feelin' frisky
Maybe I can get a little busy with my pretty missy
I'm a gypsy of the city (), Sydney where it's at
Wanna get away, meditate, celebrate and relax

If you wanna scream go shout
Till your lungs blow out, no, we won't mind
And if you wanna dance
Till your body avalanche just know, you know, we won't mind
And if you want to drink
Crash out on my couch, you know we won't mind
And if you wanna be till you feel set free
No, no, I hope you know we won't mind

I wanna be where I'm set free, out in the middle
Of the sea on a jet ski, breathing the fresh breeze
Esky brimming to the top with the ice cold
Bevvies, such a bright idea like a light bulb
Blowing up, hopin' this fantasy'll never stop
'Cause life's a crazy set of plots, so maybe I'm better off
Getting' lost in this vision, no bomb livin'
Quittin' my day job, tell my boss that I gone fishing
But this position all I could only dream about
'Cause I gotta make some dollars in order to feed my mouth
If ever I'm freaking out then I reach for my weed in my pouch
And possibly fall asleep on the couch, with the
Freedom to shout out and beat my chest
Instead I make music when I'm feelin' vexed
And yes, that's just the way that it's gotta be
My personal policy, never lettin' the bullshit bother me

If you wanna scream go shout
Till your lungs blow out, know we won't mind
And if you wanna dance
Till your body avalanche just know, you know, we won't mind
And if you want to drink
Crash out on my couch, you know we won't mind
And if you wanna be till you feel set free
No, no, I hope you know we won't mind

Yeah, uh
I'm dreamin' of a golden beach
Without a single cloud loomin' over me
Just clear blue sky
And I'm blowin' trees like a hurricane (Ha)
I'm in love with Mary Jane, she my main chick (Yeah)
Every day I'm on the same shit, different box on the calendar
""What's up, Doc?"" We roll Camberwell carrots up
(Yeah) And that's nothin' out of character
Eatin' calamari and chips with a can of Bud
Why is this a new bloodline that we're toastin'? (Cheers)
Glass raised  game face so ferocious
Approach with extreme caution
I'm dinin' on the lion's share, I ain't makin' do with the kiddy portion (Nah)
I got an appetite for life
Might blaze a little food just to amplify the vibe, and
We don't give a flyin', blood, we so high
So do what you like because we don't mind",https://genius.com/Thundamentals-we-wont-mind-lyrics

A Muslim, a Christian or just a humble Buddhist
Coulda been a has-been, fighter or an athlete
A crack fiend hiding in the back streets

Smiles Don't Lie,So We Can Remember,2013,"I been sitting all day
Sitting here thinking 'bout you
That's what I do
Yeah
I been sitting all day
Sitting here thinking everything about you
That's what I do

I told her she got a pretty face
I can tell the smile doesn't lie, she called me chickee-babe
Nicknamed me idiot, I don't really give a shit
Though I love her any way, I find
There's beauty in the little things, lying in bed
She just sighs and says ""You act a fool and you ain't that cool
And I know its irrational but I'm gonna love you anyway""
Sometimes we just sit around, don’t say much
And I know that she’s got my back
She got no hang-ups, she holds faith in us
I come by real late, she don’t wait up (nah)
She don’t make a fuss, she knows that
Won’t make trust when we both wake up
I feel my hands on my bare chest, bare flesh
When we make soul mate lovin'

I ain't just trying to write a love song
I ain't just trying to get my fuck on
Let me describe this where I come from
Let me speak on something like
Sunshine on the window pane, feeling like everything is okay
Sing a lullaby, my oh my
I can tell a smile don't lie when it's on her face

I been sitting all day
Sitting here thinkin' 'bout you (Hey)
That's what I do, yeah
I been sitting all day
Sitting here thinking everything about you (Hey)
That's what I do
I love you, babe

Sometimes the words I use can only go so far
That ain’t right, that ain’t fair
Sometimes the words I use don’t mean nothing at all
That ain’t right, that ain’t fair

I know it's been a minute now
Since I been around
Yeah, I probably should've had it figured out, but I don't, no-doz
Got me feeling like a clown, I'm a joke, so broke
But you don't care about the finer things
That's fine with me, 'cause I ain't got no diamond ring
She is conversational, elation, some wine to drink
Listening to Q-Tip, you're my vivrant thing
I got a life to give you, I'm a simple man
You been down since before we were in demand
Plus she keep it on the humble, and I'm into that
No selfies posted on her Instagram 
I'm down to make a dick of myself
Just to see you smile, girl, you're pretty as hell
Yeah I chucked a few pennies down a wishing well
And if you ever did leave, then I wish you well, yeah

I ain't just trying to write a love song
And I ain't just trying to get my fuck on
Let me describe this where I come from
Let me speak on something like
And you're on my mind, 24/7, 365
The reason that I can't sleep at night
Hypnotised but the way you smile

I been sitting all day
Sitting here thinkin' 'bout you (Hey)
That's what I do, yeah
I been sitting all day
Sitting here thinking everything about you (Hey)
That's what I do
Sitting all day
Sitting here thinkin' 'bout you (Hey)
That's what I do, yeah
I been sitting all day
Sitting here thinking everything about you (Hey)
That's what I do, yeah

'Cause sometimes the words I use can only go so far
That ain’t right, that ain’t fair
Sometimes the words I use don’t mean nothing at all
I love you, babe",https://genius.com/Thundamentals-smiles-dont-lie-lyrics
Quit Your Job,So We Can Remember,2014,"My B.O. double S ain't
Nothing but a S.O.B
He ain't nothing but a S.O.B
Fuck a J.O.B
Till I'm R.I.P
Hey yo

You make me want to quit my job, but I can't
So instead I wrote this song about you
So when you hear it I hope, you understand
The whole world now knows you're a fool

You gotta go, I gotta go
Go, go, still you gotta go
You gotta go, I gotta go
Go, go, still you gotta go
You gotta go, I gotta go
Go, go, still you gotta go
You gotta go, I gotta go
Go, go, still you gotta go

Yo I couldn't give a toss, about my shitty job
Wrote a letter to my boss ""Man you really are a slob""
Definition of a dog, wishing I was gone
Kicking back with a six-pack, sitting on the lawn
But I'm not, 'stead I'm here feeling overtired
'Cause I don't get no shine for my overtime
I got no desire to be busting for the loop
You're lucky I don't hustle for industrial dispute
For now I'm in the backroom, puffing on a doob
While you're bludging in your office, scuffing muffins by computs
Thinking who the fuck are you, to tell me what to do
I want to say it to your face but I'm afraid I'll get the boot
You're annoying as they come, and I don't give a fuck
If the toilet needs a scrub, I ain't employee of the month
Sucker, fuck a job, I might throw in the towel
Middle finger to my boss 'til he's throwing me out

You make me want to quit my job, but I can't
So instead I wrote this song about you
So when you hear it I hope, you understand

Hey yo

Picture me, as a little pipsqueak
With a one-way ticket to Sydney
Equipped with a CV
Pristine, super fly, with a suit and tie
Tryna be a big shot
Score a slick job, in the big smoke
Gets locked in to a shit box office
Making money for the rich folk
Feeling pretty ripped off
Was only ever meant to be a pit-stop
Now spend my days with you
Hey yo, I ain't no saint myself
You sir, got a long ways to go
Go to hell, make that place your home to dwell
By the way you smell like
Ashtrays and Listerine
You act strange like Mr. Bean
And, probably gonna miss the point
It's a damn shame
You're the reason I dis this joint

You make me want to quit my job, but I can't
So instead I wrote this song about you
So when you hear it I hope, you understand
The whole world now knows you're a fool

Then bitch behind my back when I'm gone
If I die before I wake
I wonder what you'd say
I wonder who you'd blame when I'm gone

Ayo my flat mates are bitching
'Why they bitching?'
Maybe cause i never do the dishes, I leave 'em in the kitchen
Now I'm on a mission to find different ways to diss em
Leave the toilet seat glistening by the time I finish pissing, yuck!
Listen up
Tryna tell me that I lack respect
I pimp your grandmother out if that means cashin' cheques
The bad guy gettin' mad high
Train my pet magpie to drop a massive shit up on your flannelette
I used to be the kid that never got a lot done
Quick to drop in at your crib if you had a hot mum
Steady sitting on the couch pretending to watch TV
All the while staring down her blouse tryna cop a sneak peek
You see me
I'm cheeky
Yet pretty far from evil, but I'm hungry
So I'm eyeing off your dinner like a seagull
I'm ugly, don't judge me, you're bugging while I'm chilling
I'm feeling like a hero, why they treat me like a villain?

It must be something that I said

Can you see how silly Billy isn't it confusing?
Ain't it funny how
Everybody wanna me tell me something
Now they seem very friendly but their bluffin'
Fussin' and cussin'
Husslin' and bustlin'
Busy making something outta nothing
I'm done with the dumb shit
Throw it all away like
Rubbish in the dust bin
I've heard it all today

Nothing but a baby bitching
Imma take a minute, while you're taking minutes, crazy tripping
I'm the guy that chops your onions, it's my duty to
You’re just hungry in the stomach
Funny like a bunch of loony tunes
Glutton stuff your gullet toodaloo

Sick and tired of all these primates

Keep it crispy like them croutons
Pour tout le monde, either move along
Or wake the fuck up off that futon bitch
I'm the Udon and I goes in
Home made bombs, Mitre 10
Balling out in Bali like a boss sipping bin tang with my mi-goreng
No artificial flavouring, no MSG, just let me be, on the MP3, i'm an MVP
Why these whack motherfuckers wanna envy me?

Got Love,So We Can Remember,2014,"I got love (one love, one love)
One love (one love, one love)
And that’s it (one love, one love)
Take your fist and make a peace sign with it
I got love (one love, one love)
One love (one love, one love)
And that’s it (one love, one love)
Take your fist and make a peace sign with it

Ayo, I’m stoked to be living in a lucky country
It’s just a joke that we’re governed by a bunch of numpties
Still I’m loving all the listeners, you matter to me
I got love for all the fishes in the Barrier Reef
A big-it-up for my fellow man, who gives a damn
If you’re black, white, or yellow man, I'mma keep it mellow man
Ain’t about the melanin
 and I believe in
The phrase “stand for something or you might fall for anything”
So find me standing on my own two feet
Put my feet in your shoes, am I going to deep?
You can walk a mile in my boots, I could do the same thing
And see how life is for you, that’s true and
Can you imagine a world without borders?
I can imagine my girl with two daughters
What would you do to keep your family free?
Way I see it we’re apart of one family tree

I got love (one love, one love)
One love (one love, one love)
And that’s it (one love, one love)
Take your fist and make a peace sign with it
I got love (one love, one love)
One love (one love, one love)
And that’s it (one love, one love)
Take your fist and make a peace sign with it

Just for once
I wanna say I’m one of the lucky ones
Jet setting just to tell them where I’m coming from
Few laps around the country but who’s counting
Got love for the city and love for the Blue Mountains
A change of scenery to where I need to be
Meet the locals and sample the greenery
To me, everywhere I go is unique
Turn over a new leaf, feel the vibe on my frequency
I used to only ever see the negative
Always tripping out what I didn’t have
Now I realise what the lesson is
So I’m kicking back and giving thanks
All I need is one mic, one stage, a one night stand
With your town and the walk-of-shame down the runway
Means more than I can say
Till I make the hall of fame it’s one love, one day

I got love (one love, one love)
One love (one love, one love)
And that’s it (one love, one love)
Take your fist and make a peace sign with it
I got love (one love, one love)
One love (one love, one love)
And that’s it (one love, one love)
Take your fist and make a peace sign with it

Somebody chuck me the manual to this life bizz
I must admit, I kind of suck at it
But can you tell someone to hand me the mic quick
I'm quite nice with it, let me run that lip
That’s all G
T-U-K-A, I rap for me
Thundacats understand it was stacked 4 deep
Ye who came late can thank Matt Corby
Much respect to the bugger man
Keep it on the humble and
Big love to the people in the struggle and
Trying to flee the motherland, and I don’t want to rub it in
But it’s fucked how you’re treated by my government
We seem to point the finger at the scapegoat
Even though we’re sinking in the same boat
While the cynic plays the victim with a halo
I pray to God you find a safe place home

I got love (one love, one love)
One love (one love, one love)
And that’s it (one love, one love)
Take your fist and make a peace sign with it
I got love (one love, one love)
One love (one love, one love)
And that’s it (one love, one love)
Take your fist and make a peace sign with it",https://genius.com/Thundamentals-got-love-lyrics
The Groundhog Song,So We Can Remember,2014,"Sometimes I feel like
I was built for something better than this
Fuck the facade I'm
Try'na fill that empty piece of my heart
I'm guessing everyone is
Call me Peter Pan
I've forgotten everything I dream of
Have you seen my neverland?
I'm Peter Pan
I've forgotten everything I dream of
Everything I have is gone

I need to depart this lie that I'm living
My teachers will teach you to reach for the stars
For Venus and Mars, the sky is the limit
But is it a phrase I believe in my heart?
Call me a cynic, I'm part of the system
Where Trayvon Martin and T.J. Hickey's
Deaths are being swept under the carpet
And Zimmerman's free I can picture him laughing
Instead of getting his ass kicked, sittin' here askin'
Yo what would have occurred, if the roles were reversed?
If it was a black man killing a white kid, national crisis
Open your eyelids
It's glaringly blatant we live in a nation that's heavily racist
But if I say it they're labeling me un-Australian, fuck it
Everyday is a different conundrum, double the dosage
What are my options?
Suppose I could follow my passion, or I could work for the man
And get stuck in the doldrums
Trying to focus on what is important
Personal gain or personal stories
Maybe I'm strange, maybe I'm vein
Afraid that the world will ignore me


Stuck in the middle with you
Reading my mind, it's simple to do
I pity the fool who's missing the point
That must be me, but figure I live in a void
7am up on my feet, somebody save me
I ain't a saviour, lost in my thoughts
I wait for the train to take me away, money for labour
I've only got love for my neighbour
Whether he's up in the mansion, or stuck in a trailer
We are all one in the same thing
Yin and the yang just a product of nature
Some of us chuck in the towel
Or have our heads up in the clouds
Some of us challenge behaviour, master the maverick
Others are happy with dumbing it down
Slap me for fucking around, but I'm juggling time
Don't get it twisted, broke but I'm gifted
I'd much prefer to fuck with your mind
Than bump in the hustle and grind
I'm looking for something to die for

Just give me some hope, a smoke and a light yo, hey",https://genius.com/Thundamentals-the-groundhog-song-lyrics
Ghost In The Shell,So We Can Remember,2014,"So here's a little story 'bout Milly and Matt
Milly always told Matt, you stink and you're fat
And why is your shirt all stained, you one dumb pig
You got a hole in your socks, and where's your pumped up kicks?
Matt had come to live on housing estates
His mum was a nurse, worked late at hourly rates
Daddy was long gone, it was a lonely affair
He watched Home & Away to feel at home in his head
'Cause at home there was nobody there
And at school, he was just a taboo, he was just that fat dude
So nobody cared, addicted to that fast food
Could even see the arches from the classroom
He'd eat it in a heartbeat, every afternoon at half 3
Catch him watching cartoons, Maccas within arms reach
He's whistle every jingle in the ad breaks
Those fuckers had him gagging on the catchphrase
But one day, when Matty's mother had a minute
She said ""some day, you ain't always gonna have my hand to deal with""
Matt sat and listened, she had him thinking
She's on in on what the deal is
She told him how she feels, we are indifferent
Sees it on the media and reads it on the internet
Hears it on the radio, sex is selling product
Symptom of oppression, where the 1% get more than just the off cuts
And ignorance is bliss, why won't it let me hit that?
I've been trying to get my fix, it's just an empty mismatch
You can try to act the big man, fingers at the bad guy
You can open up your big mouth, close down your damn mind

I ain't got time to hold your hand
You know I know I'm gone
And I'm not here to make your mind up
You know I know I won't
You're more than just a ghost in a shell
A ghost in a shell

Does it get easier?
Yes, it gets easier. The more you know who you are and what you want the less, you let things upset you

So here's a little story 'bout Milly and Matt
Milly always told Matt, you stink and you're fat
Matty struggled with confidence, kids thought he was chubby
Milly was the opposite, boys called her a honey
Born in the money, Milly's fam settled in Palm Beach
Some would say Summer Bay, has a shelter from harms reach
And a north mansion was heritage listed
Oak-floor boards, cabinets and sheridan in the linen
Extravagant living, you could tell that wealth was a given
From that high held prop in the kitchen
Butlers up in the ovens, after he's done the dishes
He buttering up the muffins, father's up in the spinach
Yeah daddy was minted, hit him with the amount
Cashing the cow, advertising exec'
Maccas was his biggest account
About twenty years back he scored his first billboard
Before long he made a mill', then a couple mill' more
But if only daddy actually cared
She'd wake up, and cake up with make up and glamorous hair
Dreaming of a face up on that billboard
Or half naked on the front page of Vanity Fair
Her mother had lips full of botox
Which influenced Mill to get work done
So would she get implants or nose job
She'd love both, but couldn't yet decide on the first one
September 4th fell on a Thursday
Just an ordinary day, in a day of her life
But it was Milly's twenty first Birthday
The day she organised to go under the knife
Not content with the skin that she lived in
Her Pursuit of happiness is a curse
Before the blade made its incision
Milly grabbed the hand and Matty's mother who happened to be the nurse

I ain't got time to hold your hand
You know I know I'm gone
And I'm not here to make your mind up
You know I know I won't
You're more than just a ghost in a shell
A ghost in a shell",https://genius.com/Thundamentals-ghost-in-the-shell-lyrics
Elephant In The Room,So We Can Remember,2014,"You can bring along your wishlist
Sing your song of six pence
Life's a box of chocolates
Pick and spot the difference
Meet me in the middle, chill with Mr. Optimistic
When all we ever wanted wasn't what we got to live with
Bit of foresight, with a dollar to trick, true
But you can't kick it in the past
Steady gonna fix so you can live it in the now
Missing it once when you were figuring it out
It's about that time, like the 8:08
Cause there ain't no way imma stay and play those games
......same old shit while I bounce outside
Cause there ain't no doubt
When I kiss to the vinyl things disappear to my eye
You think I'm weird, my beer in the lights
Better with my fears I'm clearing I might
As well face it, its basic shit's steering so fast so take it
Every man is a  in disguise
But few have a voice I'm prepared to debate with

All they're saying doesn't really mean a thing to us
And we don't want to talk about it we just want to fill a cup
We on the same shit different day I don't want to interrupt
The elephant is in the room nobody's gonna give a fuck
I'm so vain and its OK we only want the finer things

Like big gun, false names, fast cars, ivory
Faux pas, cocaine, nose jobs, irony
Get iced off, white dust, gold chains and diamond rings
I'm so vain and its OK we only want the finer things
Like big gun, false names, fast cars, ivory
Faux pas, cocaine, nose jobs, irony
Get iced off, white dust, gold chains and diamond rings
I'm so vain and its OK we only want the finer things

This is so I can remember, the reason why I made this
Sometimes its like I'm caged in so I wrote this to escape it
I feel like I been waiting for them to take me on their spaceship
Instead skip the phrase, its a different day, but we be on that same shit
I don't want to think about it (nah)
I just want to fill a cup, live it up
Trying to get a drink around it
I'ma drown my sorrows when I down these bottles
Tell me how this shit is sounding
I ain't no role model I'ma go home blotto
And I feel so lotto
Living on a hope and a prayer do you care
No my soul ain't hollow
Y'all know the motto ""Fuck Tony""
I still got love for my homies
They're the only people that know me
So why do I feel so lonely cause I'm OG
I was raised in a place where we never spoke about our problems
And to keep it one hundred we just tryna get blunted
Blow hype 'till the motherfucking cops come

All they're saying doesn't really mean a thing to us
And we don't want to talk about it we just want to fill a cup
We on the same shit different day I don't want to interrupt
The elephant is in the room nobody's gonna give a fuck
All they're saying doesn't really mean a thing to us

And we don't want to talk about it we just want to fill a cup

Home in Your Head,So We Can Remember,2014,"When the world is lost
Oh you can feel at home in your head
Just so you know, when the world is lost
You can feel at home in your head

One day I'll write a song you can sing along to
Blame it on the music when it gets stuck up in your head
Every time it's on you forget about your problems
It's something you hold onto, it's the love up in your chest
Gonna make you feel good, make you feel fine
You can blame it on the music every time
It's gonna make you feel good, make you feel fine
You can blame it on the music every time

I was only seventeen when I wrote my first verse
Inspired by lonely beats and ODB’s dope rhymes
With curse words like, ""can I beg your pardon?""
Fuck you, can I say what's on my mind?
So one day I started filling up pages with songs I made from my life
Now I'm hangin' to pay forward, we're bored of the paper chase
We ain't talkin' 'bout fame or fortune, they resume's for the bank
We just sayin', let's make it awesome, prayin' it resonates
Like Bansky spray paintin' a portrait on the walls of corporate estates
We be searching for that perfect moment, that surge of inspiration
That's serves to evoke emotion, it's more than just entertainment
It's normal to feel uncertain, when caught in a dead end change it
Importance of being earnest, your purpose is calling, take it
Let's just say, it ain't for the faint heart
I'll make art imitate art, concentrate, start a conversation
Spark a movement, instead of brainwashing my illusion
Put faith in music, escape the bullshit just to get me through the day

One day I'll write a song you can sing along to
Blame it on the music when it gets stuck up in your head
Every time it's on you forget about your problems
It's something you hold onto, it's the love up in your chest
Gonna make you feel good, make you feel fine
You can blame it on the music every time
It's gonna make you feel good, make you feel fine
You can blame it on the music every time

Why
Why, why
Why
Why, why
Why
Why, why
Why
Why, why

I wake up in the morning and I press play
In the lab, won't see me till the next day
Tryna stand out on that high vis
We ain't tryna blend in like a fresh fade
Fly shit under the street lights
Since I was knee high to a grasshopper
Read my art proper, and I've never been obsessed with
Tryna be the best fuckin' chart topper
If you woulda told me ten year ago
That these raps that I spit, that I crafted with
This pad and pen woulda took me 'round the planet
And then back again I woulda laughed and said
That you're trippin' man
, but yo that was then
This is now and immaculate
Conception of a dream that I seen
Where I'd be without it, can't free without it
Yeah I don't know, but what I do know
Is I don't do shows, for no kudos
If you're in the same boat then the same thing goes
Don't lose hope, I salute you
And this crew's sure to stay passionate
Can you catch my drift?
We all have to vent, so spill that magic ink
Grab a mic then patch it in

When the world is lost
Oh you can feel at home in your head
Just so you know, when the world is lost
You can feel at home in your head

One day I'll write a song you can sing along to
Blame it on the music when it gets stuck up in your head
Every time it's on you forget about your problems
It's something you hold onto, it's the love up in your chest

Reminisce on when we first met, you wasn't having in
Ghetto fabulous, fat booty, mad bougie
Only thing that you gave me was some attitude
Wrote me off as just some other rapper dude, on a different latitude
Sassy rude miss, but it only made me wanna hit
Like a dog with a bone, sniffing round your mothers crib
Next we on some other shit, kicked it for a second
More than just a physical connection
Falling from the heavens, falling for your presence
Falling for your love again, feeling like I'm plummeting
I could be your everything and I ain't talkin' rhetoric
Let me in, the source of your affection
If you want it come and get it, when you're calling I don't let it ring
Remember when, all we ever wanted was to settle in
We were gonna pick another planet and live on it
Instead we picked it up and dropped it
We about to hit the bottom

I'm falling, falling, I'm falling
Falling for your love again
And I'm all in, all in, all in
Scared as fuck it's all pretend

'Cause my heart has got a hole in it
My heart has got a hole in it
My heart has got a hole in it
My heart has got a hole in it

She hate it when I make her blush
I can't take it when I make her cry
I can see the love up in her eyes, every time we touch
I can feel the comfort in vibe, I'm rubbing up her thigh
Even though we trying to take it slow
We already said goodbye a couple years ago
But tryna be involved in one another's lives
Is fucking with my mind, she got a heart of gold
Catch my wet feet, run and jump into the fire
It's time I let you know
That you are not a hobby or a one night stand, and
I am not something on the side, go ahead and put it on me
I am everything you wanted
And I'm sorry if I come across cocky, my bad, but
Some things don't come by chance
I'mma show you all the love I can

You're an old soul with a young mind
You are my cold heart, like the sunshine
And all I know's a fresh start's hard to come by
Love life scars heal, give it some time 'cause sometimes
I see the rain form in the skies
Just waiting for the storm to arrive

I'm falling, falling, I'm falling
Falling for your love again
And I'm all in, all in, all in
Scared as fuck it's all pretend

'Cause my heart has got a hole in it
My heart has got a hole in it
My heart has got a hole in it
My heart has got a hole in it",https://genius.com/Thundamentals-hearts-lyrics
Missing You,So We Can Remember,2014,"You are, you are, you are, you are, you are
Everything i don't wanna be-ee
Everything i don't wanna be-ee
But i, but i, but i, but i
Can see everything of you in me
What the fuck, goodbye goodbye
Hey dad, gee it feels funny to say that
You got any money to pay back? mum's broke
Her boyfriend's a dumb joke, some drunk bloke
Gets way mad; kinda like you
Well, that's what i heard my word
You've got a dynamite fuse
Now tell me, how'd you like to buy booze
Write tunes and hide from everybody that tries to find you
Yo Reilly, why'd you sideline me?
I tried to phone but you don't answer
That's what i do see i'm kinda like you
True, check the smile if you wanna gander
I've got bad teeth too
Must be in the gene pool
It's got me thinking what you've been through
It's been a minute since i've seen you
Maybe we can meet soon
If not i can understand it
Keep cool kicking in your caravan
And how'd you go after that accident?
Face full of glass, long neck and some pain killers
I'm just asking why you ain't with us
You are, you are, you are, you are, you are
Everything i don't wanna be-ee
Everything i don't wanna be-ee
But i, but i, but i, but i
Can see everything of you in me
What the fuck, goodbye goodbye
Missing you, missing missing you
Missing you, miss miss missing you
Missing you, missing missing you
Missing missing you-oooo
What up Pops?
Yo i gotta give props
From day dot you were working more than one job
Just to keep the heat on
On that night shift. where has he gone?
Cos by day you would get your sleep on
Aged eight, moved to the UK for opportunities
But never seen none, to shay, city escape in the '80 for an immigrant
Wasn't killin shit
Shitty pay put some scraps on your dinner plate
It's a pity, hey?
I remember how it happened when
You had that crash and your back got bent
That was some tragic shit
When you lost your court case
I'll never forget the look i saw up on your face of pure pain
From that day forth you had a changed demeanor
Went from happy go lucky to couldn't give a fuck
I began to say how hard it was to see ya
With each new day grow a little more meaner
To my brother George won't know that you're a great bloke
I'm sorry that he chose you as his scapegoat
No more bear hugs for the bear cubs
Just medicated drugs but i maintain hope
You are, you are, you are, you are, you are
Everything i don't wanna be-ee
Everything i don't wanna be-ee
But i, but i, but i, but i
Can see everything of you in me
What the fuck, goodbye goodbye

Missing you, miss miss missing you
Missing you, missing missing you...

So We Can Remember,So We Can Remember,2014,"""So We Can Remember""
Hey mm hmm...
Let me do my thing
Let me do my thing
Kill my vibe but don’t kill my buzz
Let me do my thing
Do my thing
Show me proof and I’ll show you love
Let me do my thing
Do my thing
Kill my vibe but don’t kill my buzz
Let me do my thing
Do my thing
Show me proof and I’ll show you love
(I’ll show you love)
So we can remember
I can hear that alarm clock buzzing
Its 6:00am
Hit the snooze button, fuck it
I might just sleep in
‘Stead I get up on the bus and this shit’s mayhem
We just trying to make a dollar ‘bout what makes sense
I gotta pay rent
Kids gotta pay dues
Why the old school saying that I shouldn’t make moves
Forget that
Imma grab the bull by the horns
What they front on today will be cool by the morning
We all in with that forward thinking
I respect your opinion
I’m all for listening
But only if you’re down to kick knowledge
And I ain’t talking the shit you get up in college
I’m talking street scholars not following trends
We never grovel and beg for your attention when we’re rocking the set
I got a roof on top of my head
You know we truly are blessed to be alive
Imma do it to death yes
Do you know
That you’re so special to me
Do you know
That you’re so special
(I’ll show you love)
So we can remember
It goes d-o-y-o-u-g-e-t-i-t
Now get it rewound
If you need to rewind you can spell it out
Get each and every letter down
Get it refined
Read between these lines
Smoke a peace pipe and show me your peace sign
My poetry breathes life
The heart in me feels like
Blood flows like it’s a freestyle
My arteries bleed rhymes
That I even freeze minds
If the third eyes blind
It’s hard to see mine
But best believe we shine
Our lights speed
Don’t worry ‘bout me
A change is gonna come like were fighting our green
I dedicate this to never ending on a sour note
It’s been a long time coming
You know how it goes
A thousand bogans couldn’t hold me back from sounding dope
So let’s go
(Let me do my thing
Let me do my thing
Kill my vibe but don’t kill my buzz
Let me do my thing
Do my thing
Show me proof and I’ll show you love
Do my thing
Let me do my thing
Kill my vibe but don’t kill my buzz
Let me do my thing
Do my thing
Show me proof and I’ll show you love)
Do you know you’re so special to me
Know that you are loved
And ease your mind for a minute
So we can remember
How good it is to be
Do you know you’re so special to me
Know that you are loved
And ease your mind for a minute
So we can remember
How good it is to be",https://genius.com/Thundamentals-so-we-can-remember-lyrics

If you want an easy come up
Try to get your money right (yeah, yeah)
I bust nuts, these suckers want an easy come up
Suckers want an easy come up
I tell 'em stuff the hype

When all that you wish for
Is found, in a never ending weekend
Well we don't need to pretend
Monday's tryna creep in
See I've got that slippery little sucker all up on my mind
Everytime I sleep in
Some say to dream big
Some say I'm dreaming
Makes me wonder what it really means to really be a real thing
Some say dumb shit
I'm done with believing like
Leave the fun and games for another day gee-wiz
Genius, jumps change - keep it
I'd rather sunbake like Sunday's in season
Get up off my back, let me spread my wing
Get angelic on the track, we confess each sin
But, you can pray to God, to try to save the righteous
You can blame the market
You can shame the saints
You can seek the guidance for a prehistoric mindset
Asskick, what that has to do with fish
And then the big crisis

I don't know much about much but
I do know that I'm cool with that
(Now here we go x6)
Sometimes I forget my words
I freestyle, superman

One two, one two
Yo can I get a mic check?
I'm sightless, where's the light switch? I'm tryna find it
Stumble in the dark like a burglar in a balaclava
Finna sat these pineapples and these avacadas
Hallelujah, pray to Jah or Buddha
Whatever suits ya
Find me sitting in my stoop brah
In a soup bar, like we 'bout to put the single out
Peeping over skyscrapers in a single bound
A and Oz hanging 'round
Cos we round heaters
In my wife beater, screamin' yo
""I ain't a fucking mind beater""
I don't know what's going
Reason why I wrote this song
For my loner, stoners who be feeling like they don't belong
No, I don't see nothing wrong
With a little bump and grind
Tryna make a dirty wine
Something for the summer
I'm lazy, stuff the double time, bust a rhyme
While I cut this steak with a butterknife
Fuck it brother such is life

I don't know much about much but
I do know that I'm cool with that

Disconnect,Thundamentals,2008,"""Funny-funny-funny Haha""
""No-no-no-no bling bling""

Yo, I kick back (kick back), switch off my mobes and the home phone
Alone in my own zone while smoking the home grown
These quotes glow, exposing a hole in the ozone
Gold tones for drones who pretend like they don't know
They're so so deaf, plus they don't say shit
Lame kids on a mish just to blow and grow famous
But face it, if that's your main goal then it's basic
The cost is your soul in exchange for the papers
This game's so shameless, I tote the vapours
To escape from these blokes with their token statements
Many big time MC's are overrated
You can claim that you're dope just don't overstate it
God, these pro's is dangerous to a fool who beefs
Their disillusion, while we kick it lucidly
So musically I salute you for choosing me
For tunes you need like drink or the food you eat
I'm never using beats to make a played-out club track
Like ""bump, bump, bump"", yeah, fuck that
I love rap, rep for the heads and the pub rats
Jes go and Tuk snatch, no one can touch that

These blinged out kids at the discotheque
That ain't hip-hop, I think I'd rather slit my neck
Than have to listen to these kids when they disrespect
If this is it, I think I better disconnect
To these blinged out kids at the discotheque
That ain't hip-hop, I think I'd rather slit my neck
Switch off your TV's and the internet
We take heads on the trip as we disconnect

Next to step, breakin' arse like Alex Dimitriades
You're another wannabe martial artist speakin' the hardest
Well I'm out of this world, I'm almost reachin' the martians
I'm stuck in the underground, I got my feed in the garden
While you're bleachin' your armpits and believin' this garbage
 I spit on beat and  your arses
 you wanna reach a beach in the Bahamas too
Just not like a thief in the market selling  in the 
If that's you you're fake, yeah, 
I shed a little light onto the situation like Illuminati
 you can't harm me, I'm the one called 'The New'
Pack of Winnie golds, crack a jimmy cold, I got a city view
We're from  genre that's nearly extinct
So follow 
You're only gettin' what you're puttin' in, a lot of shit isn't it?
That's the bling in the shop, but that's a topic that's on top
That I mock, don't buy that weak joint, son
It's soundin' like it's gettin' dropped on ninty-six-point-one
So make way with that fake gay sound and tune
Allow room for Thundamentals from my mountains blue

These blinged out kids at the discotheque
That ain't hip-hop, I think I'd rather slit my neck
Than have to listen to these kids when they disrespect
If this is it, I think I better disconnect
To these blinged out kids at the discotheque
That ain't hip-hop, I think I'd rather slit my neck
Switch off your TV's and the internet
We take heads on the trip as we disconnect

While gangster wax attackin' us like viruses
I'm in the lab rappin', forgettin' what time it is
Kickin' that timeless shit that can live forever
And maybe even make me a bit of gravy
But lately I'm chasin' the pace of a daily grind
When I chill and lift the page to illustrate my state of mind
Sick of thug angry types writin' lazy rhymes (yo)
 their lives way too fake to relate to mine
Blaze a pipe, disconnect the high (uh)
When I hit stage I spit flames, tryna set your friggin' head alight
Spray like pesticide, don't need gimmicks
I'm a dope fiend, best described as a free spirit
 step aside, all your G'd out G's bitches
Or at least revisit your weak lyrics while I freak with it
'Cause this is my only source of expression
What happened to funky rappin' instead of sportin' a weapon?
It's all talk that you're reppin' and I don't need none of it
Put down the mic 'cause you MC's suck at it
Bling bling cats, I'm rattin' out the whole game
From your plastic Gat to your fashionable gold chains",https://genius.com/Thundamentals-disconnect-lyrics
Storm Warning,Thundamentals,2008,"I feel a storm is comin' on
It's comin' on, it's comin' on, comin' on
When it is it's gonna do whatever it wants
It's comin' on, it's comin' on, comin' on

I haven't got something to prove
But I got nothing to lose
(It's true)  I'm puffing a doob
Up in the booth, not stuck in a suit
Or givin' a stuff, living it up
Bussing a groove and bringing the funk
While Morgs is ripping the 
I'm snatching the Port, I fill up my cup
Chill it with ice, ill on the mic
Last thing I need's someone killing the vibe
Willing to fight, kickin' a fuss
Just 'cause I drunken a million pints
Wait! You think you're playing it cool
But mate you're playing a fool too!
I'll take you to school if you're breaking the rules
I'll leave you washed up like an ape in a pool
Never said I was better than you
That's not what I endeavor to do
It's not your fault, you're bred in a zoo
Or you stink more than Pepé Le Pew
Step to the crew, the incredible few
Thundamentals will fry your electrical fuse
I'm blending the groove, dissembling foes
Each sentence I use helps set it in stone
Wherever I roam, start second to none
So suave and obese, I'm impressing your mum
Hot sex in the sun, enjoy the summertime
If the boss is stressing let him employ some other guy
Sing a lullaby about the birds and the bees
So we can get down more personally (Fuck)
Right now I'm bursting the seams
Where the word is born, the storm's bursting the scene

I feel a storm is comin' on
It's comin' on, it's comin' on, comin' on
When it is it's gonna do whatever it wants
It's comin' on, it's comin' on, comin' on

While most folks are sitting at home
Picking their nose I'll be flipping the flow
Deliver a show, just leaving you go-ing
Oh shit, kid, didn't you know?
I'm drinking my coke then I mix it with rum
You're listening into the skills of the one
While Fiasko's hitting the drum
It's packing a punch like a kick in the gut
Stuck in a rut? I'm upping the ante
Running amuck like a bum in a pantry
Ain't for kids who's chucking a tanty
Or chickens who's fucking and clutching their panties
And chucking them at me, that's not what the plan be, uh
I can't help it if you're randy
Don't get angry just 'cause I'm taken
Check out my mates, you could probably date them
Thundamentals'll pave the way
It's safe to say that we're making waves
While haters are sipping their hatorade
I'll blaze the phrase in my database
Straight spitting razor blades at a crazy rate
Until my hair is a shade of grey
That can't be changed  breaks for days and days
And weeks and months, ayo my speech is crunk
Pump this in your crib while you're eating lunch
Or up in your whip, let the speakers bump
No need to ask who the leaders are
It's clear to us my team is rough
Please don't front, this beat is nuts
So dope that the CD reach the buds
Got my sneakers scuffed 'cause I run the map
So come back when the sound of a thunderclap

I feel a storm is comin' on
It's comin' on, it's comin' on, comin' on
When it is it's gonna do whatever it wants
It's comin' on, it's comin' on, comin' on

Yeah yeah
I don't know why all these people want to wait their life away

Born ravenous, broke like poor scavengers
The maverick, living off dope and raw cabbages
Catalyst armed with a pen and a page
Tryna generate change by the end of the day
 keep it tight like when I speak into the mic
If I get lucky you might see me leaving with your wife
Nah, I'm joking, don't stress, bro
I wouldn't do that, well, unless you said so
Let's go, maybe taking it down
But right now I'm on stage laying it down
Making a vow to the people who relate to the sound
Real recognize real, there's no faking allowed
Instead of playing it out I could get in 
My sole purpose is taking control and breaking the mould
Reshaping the art—asking what's happening next?
As the hair stands up on the back of your necks

I got no need for sorrow or to rest on my laurels
And I won't seek solace at the bottom of a bottle
Jes will never grovel for a piece of the pie
'Stead I'll make my own cake, now I'm eating a slice
The reason I write is precisely to free my brain
It's like Carpe Diem, so I seize the day
Till I reach the place where dead poets await
I make tracks, if they're whack then I throw 'em away
Start from scratch, most MC's hardly rap
They can't adapt or see past party tracks
So now I'm asking, ""What type of art is that?""
We're tryna keep it more realer than a heart attack
Cardiac arrest who? Pretenders who stress me out
Talk shit then you best be out
Check me out, I'm here to kick rhymes with mates
Right away, there ain't no time to waste

When things are not what they seem
Artful dodgers are on the scene
Bob and weave till we can't be seen
Until the gang's at your gate screaming ""Carpe Diem""
When things are not what they seem
Artful dodgers are on the scene
Bob and weave till we can't be seen
Until the gang's at your gate screaming ""Carpe Diem""

Seize the day

Thunda Dub,Thundamentals,2008,"Batten down the hatches when we come to town
We astound with the sound from the underground
Stun the crowd with shots from the Thunda clouds
Batten down the hatches when we come to town
We astound with the sound from the underground
Stun the crowd with shots from the Thunda clouds

I'm your modern day madman vagabond
Snatch your whiskey, head back to Babylon
Get your swagger on, rollin' with a pack of gypsies
In your back, hands slap, and you tag alongs
On the road roamin' the open plains
Storm your hometown, known to own the stage
Flip the bird to your poker face
But inspire those of you who don't know the name
I spit a verse, it'll show the way
To a lost soul on a path they never chose to take
Yo, I'll make you motivate so throw away
Them chokin' chains and maybe grow some faith
There's no mistakes, 'cause it's simple as this
Caught you flippin' your lid when I spit my rhythm and pitch
Not bringing a diss, hip-hop, I'm living this shit
A bit of jig in your step, a bit of swing in your hips
You'll be advanced,  like an avalanche
Man, this is sabotage, damn, you don't have chance
Smash your whole shack apart when we come through
Say what  brainwash will you come to?

Batten down the hatches when we come to town

Batten down the hatches when we come to town
We astound with the sound from the underground
Stun the crowd with shots from the Thunda clouds

When I flow it's a dose of that potent karma
Explode on a track like it's molten lava
But we're holding your boat as we're floatin' past ya
 from your slopes to your coastal harbour
Always lookin' for a way to get me open faster
So my first point of call is a smoking parlour
I walk through the door, heard jokes and laughter
Then I saw that the whole joints slowly plaster
With a view to consumer all the local lager
Cruise to the spot like a rolling car does
At the bar this old bloke 
 he leans in and boldly asks us
He says, ""Son, I'm drunk, I broke my glasses
Would you do me a favour and roll this grass up?""
I rolled up the spliff, as he slowly sparked up
He said, ""Here's to you, man, I hold my glass up""
Toked it harder, then he started gaspin'
I thought, 'Puff, puff, man, it's time to pass it'
He passed it, I charge it, that weed was sweet, dude
Got me high as this beat from the D.U.P crew

Batten down the hatches when we come to town
We astound with the sound from the underground
Stun the crowd with shots from the Thunda clouds
Batten down the hatches when we come to town
We astound with the sound from the underground
Stun the crowd with shots from the Thunda clouds


We get you feeling kinda' eerie like you found a ghost
Best beware, 'cause the bomb shit's 'bout to blow
Down to choke, toked down a pound of dope
Float round your house or home and appear in a cloud of smoke
Look alive, I might ignite the vibe
That I lit, you might stay, realign your spine
When the lighting strikes, hear the thunder loud and clear
Wanna see the crowd in here 

Ayo
We hound your peers with surround sound systems
We pound your ears, we've been around for years
If you shouting 'yeah', yo, this crew here's soundin' bare
It's a result of that mountain there
Like a mountaineer, we tryna reach the top
Let the streets be the judge if it's weak or not
We keeps it hot, for real, while these leeches rot
We freak the spots with shots to your speakerbox, what?",https://genius.com/Thundamentals-thunda-dub-lyrics

Yeah, yeah
Here's your mission if you choose to accept it
Wreck shit and take hip-hoppers on a head trip
Connect with the lyrics of the boldest spy
Who seen it all through the vision in his golden eye
Patrol the mic, I buss, girls blush when I go by
So fly, strutting in a tux and a bow tie
Oh my, that MC's nice with the similes
High class imagery like riding in limousines
Striving, a killer bee, my rhyming abilities
Akin to a knife or a slice from a guillotine
A night on the illing spree, I wait till the day's dark
And take out your main guards who laze up in the graveyard
Way to a great start sprayed over eight bars
Stay large, grew up with a face that can break hearts
Play cards close to my torso, you'll know
The flows top secret, we speak in Morse code
MC's are awful, so we keeps it thoughtful
His stone cold poems that could freeze the North Pole
I roll like a villain with them criminal links
Flee the crime scene quicker than invisible ink

Suckers wanna test, best check before they get stung
Set numb like I spat venom out my left lung
Head slung back, rappin' shrapnel out my right one
Yo, I'm on a spy hunt, lock and load
Drop the flow, bomb shit like Dr No
So if you don't know, bro, then you gots to go
Vacate to a safe place when you spot the smoke
Mayday, I'm the man with the golden gun
They say I'm quicker then the hands that I stole it from
Take aim and  on my 
Eagle eye, knocking off that evil guy or 
Real life potshots, snap of the rhythm
If anyone asks I say I got a license to kill it
Aw shit, Octopussy's looking like a lost kitten
Let's go back to the pad and watch the plot thicken
What? I'm not kidding, I'm  and I'll never forget
Still at the end of the day never say never again

Brother {triple j Like A Version},triple j Like a Version 8,2012,"Callin' out your lover
Been callin 'out his name
He’s been hidin, he’s been hidin'
There’s only him to blame
Been crawlin' out to love her
He couldn’t tell it to your face
He’s been lyin', he’s been lyin'
Too fucked up by the pain

Once upon a time you met him on a summer’s night
Stomach full of butterflies, dressed in your best jeans
By the end of the next week
You woulda hit it up a hundred times, sex in them bed sheets
Now your singin' lullabies and you're blessed with a little girl
And in your eyes she’s beautiful
And true to form she rules your world
Don’t ever say it wasn’t worth it
But you’ve been seeing him for five years
And you can see it in his eyes yeah
And I can tell you’ve thought about it
Give me an idea
From the stories that I hear
Of course you doubt him
You mourn the sound when
He says he isn’t headed home
You can hear that fake voice break through the telephone
His alibis don’t hide his life on the side
You try to have faith but you never know

Break down
Pull yourself out of this state, dear
Acknowledge he was a fake, dear
From there on you might just grow
Throw it all away

Callin' out your lover
Been callin 'out his name
He’s been hidin, he’s been hidin'
There’s only him to blame
Been crawlin' out to love her
He wouldn’t tell it to your face
He’s been lyin', he’s been lyin'
Too fucked up by the pain

When did it all turn sour
Safe to say that now he’s underneath your skin
While you cower in the corner with no power left within
But you’re his lover
Even though you know he never loved ya
You suffer just being his insignificant other
Lipstick that’s smeared across his collar
His best kept secret that’s hidden under covers, confide in your mother
Nursing a broken heart
Alone in the dark clutching at his photograph
When it comes to emotions you close 'em shut
Because he might just leave if you open up
And it hurts so bad
Think you’re gonna go mad
Contemplating the things that you don’t have
And you feel so sad
When he leaves that you reach for the prozac, Yeah

And now he’s standing at your gate
And he be acting strange, it’s sad to say
But girl you have to face it
Pack them bags that you’ve had stashed away
It’s a tragic way to end it
But if he can’t even pay attention
And if he can’t even make the effort
It’s way to late to save
It's a cold world no man’s safe from
You got soul, girl
Don’t let no man take none

Been callin' out your lover
Been callin 'out his name
He’s been hidin, he’s been hidin'
There’s only him to blame
Been crawlin' out to love her
Couldn’t tell it to your face
He’s been lyin', he’s been lyin'
Too fucked up by the pain

Ohhhh, ohhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhhooooo
Too fucked up by the pain
Ohhhh, ohhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhhooooo
Too fucked up by the pain
Ohhhh, ohhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhhooooo
Too fucked up by the pain

Liquorlip Loaded Gun,,2016,"I wish I could disappear
So you would never see me in this mess I get in
However hard I try, keep on stumbling still
Once in a while I'll show you who I am

I'm diving into that deep blue
Jumping in with like both feet
Can you feel me? Cause I see you
Yeah I know what you done been through
But I'm fucked up, I ain't mean to
And I'm dumbed up, yeah I been rude
And it's bug but, you're the thing tune
For the soundtrack that I bring to
You're my peoples (my peoples)
And I'm hoping that you understand
For me it was more than a one night stand
My intentions aren't underhanded
And wondering why did it have to end
Try to comprehend
If I can go back and lock it in
I would, but instead I lost a friend
I can not pretend that it doesn't hurt
To know that you're on your new thing
Can't believe I'm reminiscing
Missing all your mood swings
Listening to Wu-Tang
Kissing on those liquorlips
These memories that you stained
Slipping through my fingertips
Did we sink or swim when the tide was up?
Before my time is done
Should I bite my tongue
Or try to right my wrongs
Grab that loaded gun
That light that shone is finally gone
Goodbye my love

Open up the ocean, jump on in
The masters of the coastlines beckoning
Unfold my only life vest, sink or swim
Through the everlasting worlds begin

Go ask the universe to do the math
Cause I am too concerned and preoccupied
Been flying to the moon and back
I wanna be alone
Dance in the lunar dirt
Kick up the dust
Spark the Buddha sack and view the world
All up on my own
Apparently I am too disturbed
From white picket fences, red bricks and (?)
If you prefer you can go ahead and make me for it
Judge me like a fucking yuppie
I'm just saying it ain't important
Paint a portrait of everyone you want to be
Imma lay your face down and squall it
In a rotten heat
Honestly, if you're gonna be unhappy with yourself
It ain't gonna help tryna copy everyone else
Join me at the bottom of the sea if you know what's up
I'm a lonely drunk
Sinking ships with my loose liquorlips
And a loaded gun

I wish I could disappear
So you would never see me in this mess I'm in
Light by the light, I never let it in
To back (Cause I'm a liquorlip loaded gun)
I got stuck, am I the only one?
Fuck that (Cause I'm a liquorlip loaded gun)
I smoked the cloud I was floating on
Come back",https://genius.com/Thundamentals-liquorlip-loaded-gun-lyrics
Late Nights,,2016,"Late night, turnt up, say it like you mean it
Put them lighters in the air, get them screamin', carpe diem
Poppin' bottles full of champagne, raise it to the ceilin'
I'm higher than a muthafucka, tell me if I'm dreamin'

The future's so bright, the future's so bright
The future's so bright, I wear my
Sunglasses at night everywhere I go
And I think I'm onto somethin'

Late night, turnt up, your feet still got a bit of hell to pay
Enlighten up, let it shine on us like dynamite it might melt your face
Got the game tight, you’re in the cut, but it ain’t right, let me tell you straight
Someone's always gonna bribe the judge, but who am I to judge?
It won’t help you change
So I’m rollin’ out with my best shoes on, but first I guess I gotta tie my lace
Everything I’ve been trippin’ on I’ma leave behind and ride my own lane
So till the day that my kingdom come may the bridges I burn light my flames
So everyday can stay lit as fuck till a bright future gonna shine my way

Late night, turnt up, say it like you mean it
Put them lighters in the air, get them screamin', carpe diem
Poppin' bottles full of champagne, raise it to the ceilin'
I'm higher than a muthafucka, tell me if I'm dreamin'
Late night, turnt up, say it like you mean it
Put them lighters in the air, get them screamin', carpe diem
Poppin' bottles full of champagne, raise it to the ceilin'
I'm higher than a muthafucka, tell me if I'm dreamin'

See real G's like we never D—I—E, we multiply
We don't rest in peace, there's no R.I.P., still I'm V.I.P. when I hold the mic
Said the little homie wanna be like me, but my best advice is take no advice
Say there's only one me, there always will be, so who are they to know what it's like?
And I know it's tight and it feels like it moves slow at times
Are you popular? Is it popping or are you invisible as a poltergeist?
Do you roll the dice? Do you play to win? Do you tow the line, or do you take a risk?
Can you laugh it off when they take the piss? 'Cause that last laugh's what you make of it

The future's so bright, the future's so bright
The future's so bright, I wear my
Sunglasses at night everywhere I go
And I think I'm onto somethin'
The future's so bright, the future's so bright
The future's so bright, I wear my
Sunglasses at night everywhere I go
And I think I'm onto somethin'

Late night, turnt up, say it like you mean it
Put them lighters in the air, get them screamin', carpe diem
Poppin' bottles full of champagne, raise it to the ceilin'
I'm higher than a muthafucka, tell me if I'm dreamin'
On a late night, turnt up, say it like you mean it
Put them lighters in the air, get them screamin', carpe diem
Poppin' bottles full of champagne, raise it to the ceilin'
I'm higher than a muthafucka, tell me if I'm dreamin'

Ivy,,2017,"I thought that I was dreaming
When you said you loved me
The start of somethin'
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of somethin'

I’d love to hold your hand again
I wanna feel the warmth between my fingers
From the first sign of spring to the scorching heat of summer
Autumn through the winter, ignore it all, sleeping underneath the covers
I wanna wake up every morning with ya
I wanna make love until the afternoon
I miss you more than just this picture hidden in my memory, tattooed
Every time I think of something real I always start with you
So nice to see you with a girlfriend
I love it when you’re happy, I remember when
You told me 'bout your business, how you thought you’d have to give in
But you didn’t, now it’s bigger just like fuckin’ magic
I miss you smiling at me from across the room
I miss being a part of something cool
With somebody like you, I don’t wanna be a stranger
Really, what will that do? Hey
[Pre-Chorus 1: Ev Jones, Jeswon & 
Tuka
]
If I could see through walls
I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts
You would see our faces
I wish we could talk, but it won't help
I don't wanna be a stranger

I thought that I was dreaming
When you said you loved me
The start of somethin', oh—oh—oh
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of somethin', woo—oo—oo—oo

I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good
Oh—oh—oh

'Cause I ain’t just tryna write a love song, still I sing a bittersweet
Melody, you were eighteen and I was twenty-three
It was destiny, but this is my apology
I couldn’t see what’s right in front of me, the forrest for the trees
I probably haven’t been as onto it as I coulda
Shoulda, woulda, hiding from my problems with my hood up
Just know it wasn’t you, I was running from my past
My reflection in the mirror had me sucking on a flask
Had that liquor, but it switched up when we went in for that scan
Held your hand as the doctor said, “We got a little man”
That was growing in your stomach, silhouettes upon the screen
I want you to know I loved him, but it wasn’t meant to be
Heavenly Father keep an eye out for my son
And my pops, to my mamacita, know that you’re the one
Understand I'ma be a better lover and a friend
Even if it doesn’t last I’ll still love you to the end

You ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again

I thought that I was dreaming
When you said you loved me
The start of somethin', oh—oh—oh
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of somethin', woo—oo—oo—oo
[Post-Chorus: Ev Jones, 
Jeswon
 & Tuka]
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

I thought that I was dreaming
When you said you loved me
You say you love me",https://genius.com/Thundamentals-ivy-lyrics
Home in Your Head (Part 2),,2014,"Why
Why
Why (why)
Why (why)

Is anybody home in your head
'Til then I will walk the line
Like I know where I'm going instead
Water is my wine
I don't mind if we share some time
Have you got a moment to spare

Hit me with that rugged shit
Switch up and run amuck with it, one minute
'Til you fumble it, I pick it up with both hands, hit me with that
Rip it up, if it's up, rip it down fill a cup
And bring it 'round, dog eat dog, got business
In their mine carts, hotshots, mind your business, if it's mine
What, this is for the listening, a listening device
I'm ringing the alarm, bringing in the calm
Whistling advice, enthused by the art, this guy
Sharper than a Swiss knife, flinging music in your heart
Removing every scar, bruising any mind
With my spit shine, get that shit lit, use it in the dark
A fluid with a spark, a doobie in the park, real talk
What, you in it for a floozy on the arm, fuck it man
I ain't gonna start, I'm a student of the life
Superhuman evolutionary mind, is anybody home

Is anybody home in your head
'Til then I will walk the line
Like I know where I'm going instead
Water is my wine
I don't mind if we share, sometimes
Have you got a moment to spare
It make me feel good
It makes me feel fine
It makes me feel good
It makes me feel fine
It make me feel good
It makes me feel fine
It makes me feel good
It makes me feel fine
Oh I

Growing up, my brother gave me some great advice
If you made a wrong, it's never too late to make it right
I won't waste your time, I seize a day with no delay
Shine a bit a of light for you, even if I don't know the way
Time to get it straight, I'ma demonstrate
Elevate with the pen and paper, hopin' that it resonates
Check the resume, find me snappin' up a beat
Rapping with my my peeps, captain of the streets, callus on my feet
Chattin' to the breeze, say, is anybody home
I came to kick a poem that could open up your dome
Take a look inside my soul, it's 24 carat gold
Plenty more magic for a rap addict to hold
In the palm of the hands, clappin' new jack, scrambling
For the bandwagon, lagging, we've been dope from the jump
Still I got a lot of love for the fans that be showing up
To a packed show in the front row going nuts

Is anybody home in your head
'Til then I will walk the line
Like I know where I'm going instead
Water is my wine
I don't mind if we share, some time
Have you got a moment to spare
It make me feel good
It makes me feel fine
It makes me feel good
It makes me feel fine
It make me feel good
It makes me feel fine
It makes me feel good
It makes me feel fine
