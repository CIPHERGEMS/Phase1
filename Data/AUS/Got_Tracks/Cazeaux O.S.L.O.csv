What Can We Do,,2020,"What Can We Do

[Verse 1] I use to confess now I manifest
Freshen salt water depths - Peace for your neck
Pardon me who is next
Tide slide over the dunes 
Sky colour animated cartoons
Kobayashi with the takeout
Cooling in the whip, like a stakeout
Stretching the day out
Dig it____tapes so way out
Bumping Verocai with the bass loud
The melody you could still make out
At the corner spot  filling your plate now
___With the Ital veggies,
Breeze blow steadily 
And We so ready
For whatever vibe high
Don’t even gotta try
I could see it on your eye just like you see it in mine
Fresh fruit from the vine,  Produce we divine
Jungle Love Morris Day knew the time
Sip it slow a soul on Ice with the finger limes
?
[Chorus 1] What can we do,
Let's stay together,
Just me and you,
What can we do,
Let's stay together,
Just me and you,
It don't get better
?

[Verse 2] Highlife the Highest of lights
The creature from the black
At the arcade playing golden axe
Exquisite, measure the physics where the math is
Rotate a situation, levitate it. This the magic
Curl up on that helix
Cobra clutch on the meditation, Peace the libation
Not too focused on where we been
But utilise a lesson, the seasonings the reason
Naked in my everyday—colour rays
Some shade to lay
Bodies beneath (Chiefs)
Cool as the belly of the coco leaf
Veins twice as sweet
But these season are brief
What happened to my patience
rehabilitated 
dreams melting in the sun, Adjust the situation 
No stars just bars dripping lead in the lung
Ugly is beautiful, when you're alone
?
?
[Chorus 2] What can we do,
Let's stay together,
Just me and you,
What can we do,
Let's stay together,
Just me and you,
It don't get better",https://www.lyrics.com/sublyric/78705/Houis+x+Cazeaux+O.S.L.O.+x+Blush%27ko+x+Mike+Serman/What+Can+We+Do
