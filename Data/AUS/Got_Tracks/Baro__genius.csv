Bears,17/18,2015,"You're so gorgeous
Running through the forest
Long red dress
All the bears want their porridge
My phones off so, call me at a new time
The woods are dark, finding light with the moon shine
The goods have sparked, finding sight but I'm too blind
But damn
She yelling give it cause that doobs mine
I will listen if you try to talk
Give it a couple more minutes then im signing off
I'm the boss, she said
I'm an ass for this
I haven’t asked for this
You're an arsonist
And I keep, burning her soul down
She get right back up, Then fall down

I could call her on the daily
Her eyes shine brighter than her daddy's new Mercedes
That's this years
And when the fifth tear drops we can switch gears
Try and travel to a place end a kiss there
Against the money in the world, probably choose you
You're my honey your my girl your my bluetooth
We connect like one two too
I never knew you could be so true

You're so gorgeous
Running through the forest
Long red dress
All the bears want their porridge
Or its
Me and you
So what you care to do
And you ain't worried bout the grizzlies they scared of you
So run along run along find a new place
And find this song grab my arm I'm tryna lose space
And enter my life
My eye sights, like blind mice
We bumping bright eyes
So call me when the times right


I'm a traveller from a different scene, see how much you mean to me
I close my eyes, and die tonight
It feels so right, it feels so right
I'm a traveller from a different scene, see how much you mean to me
I close my eyes, and die tonight
It feels so right, it feels so right",https://genius.com/Baro-sura-bears-lyrics
LAY U DOWN//SEXY,Just Problems You Need To Know,2017,"On my mind won't you slide through

Hey Sexy

I just want to say your name every morning
For a reason
Have you waking up to me when your yawning
I'm never leaving

From my hands on your tits
To your mouth on my dick
My thigh hairs on your clit
That's the best kind of itch
And if your mumma hear this shit
She gon' say Mars you nasty
I don't give a fuck I'm just tryna satisfy you
I told you on moan
I'll make you wetter than the bayou
I wanna make you feel high boo
(You gon' have to put the coke in your nose)
Have your pussy smoking o's
Have your pussy smoking o's

Good morning gorgeous
You look extra beautiful today
You know I might just um
Eat your pussy like some mussels out a shell
And when I get to
I'm gonna tussle out of hell and tell ya

Wdubi,Just Problems You Need To Know,2016,"All I got is you and you are all I need and
Tell me all your secrets what do you believe in?
All I got is you and you are all I need and
Tell me all your secrets now
All I got is you and you are all I need and
Tell me all your secrets what do you believe in?
All I got is you and you are all I need and
Tell me all your secrets what do you believe in?

Her Papa catch me out the window
Then I'm jumping out the roof
Saying baby if you hear it would you listen to the truth
Holler, even if you were joking
You'd be lying through your tooth
And baby I ain't even sad but I've been crying 'cause of you
I will always fucking love you Whitney Houston, '92
We, running like we kids, we picking daisies tying shoes
You Houdini got me hypnotized (hypnotized)
As soon as beaming baby hit the lights (the lights)

I said I'm hopping off the cement
Like I'm hopping on a Phoenix
With some wings up on my back I'm feeling lighter than bullimics
Whose stomachs is as empty as the space to which I'm fleeting
Bird enclose me in your fire cloak the atmosphere is breathing
Like the dragon that I'm chasing only way I'll get to Venus
Where they say the baddest honey from who cooks and books on weekends
Who'll love me when I'm sleeping
When I'm awake and when I'm dreaming
Safe to say you cursed me with your uh and with your being
And if we have a son I think we'll name him Steven
Boo I'm just a earthling Aphrodite and Athena
The goddess that I'm falling for in the mirror you gon see her
You gon know why all I got is you
All I got is you girl

All I got is you and you are all Im needing
Tell me all your secrets what do you believe in?
All I got is you and you are all Im needing
Tell me all your secrets what do you believe in?

Hands out to the congregation
Oooh let me talk my shit now
I been feeling you since syllables made my 'rents proud
Still so scared of you that's terrible got me stressed out
She unbearable, I tell her to spit my kids out
But I'm comfortable,I mean only when it comes to you
She keep my weed packed like lunchables
I wanna say fuck this tour, but I'll see you in a month or two
I mean, im the only one she want
The only thing she need
And she is all I see, other than this dream
You know the whole RD
Divide and conquer the large scene
But baby you got
Baby baby you got (x3)

All I got is you and you are all I need and
Tell me all your secrets what do you believe in?
All I got is you and you are all I need and
Tell me all your secrets ey
All I got is you and you are all I need and
Tell me all your secrets what do you believe in?
All I got is you and you are all I need and
Tell me all your secrets what do you believe in?
All I got is you, all I need is you

I think you're too pretty for me

Climb in my ride
All you do is shine baby
Baby climb in my ride

We could chill as we talk about the earth
Um I guess it's what you is
'Cause I know just what you worth
From thoughts up in your brain
To the lipstick in your purse
The machete in my chest
Plus it's bleeding
And it hurts baby

And it hurts so bad
And it hurts so bad

Girl I ain't got my licence
But that somethings got you priceless
I think
You're too pretty for me",https://genius.com/Baro-sura-pretty-lyrics
See Less,17/18,2015,"No tasks put the ass in a coffin
Stumbled down a hill now its a cave that i'm lost in
Coughing
Tryna get a grip of happiness
Posted on the couch where my homies sipping actavis
I keep it sharper than a cactus is
Eating Cheetos off a massive bitch
I'm glad that Gladys put her ass in this
Mary acting blasphemous
Cracking out the whip
She acting nasty bet i slap her wrist
Like, Who’s your father?
And who the other man?
Money ain't here so what can fit inside these rubber bands?
Put her in her underpants
Just to see the fucker dance
Put her in her underpants
Just to see her stunning stance
Bitch

We roll deep under night skies
Zoning off a joint and my homies off them white lines
I find that sometimes
I see less
Laughing at them mother fuckers all them v necks
We roll deep under night skies
Zoning off a joint and my homies off them white lines
I find that sometimes
I see less
This old shit corny mother fucker yo its me next

Shit
Yo i probably even bleed red
Smoked a j at school now i'm going home at recess
The teacher yelling at me i don’t do whatever he says
It's hard to be happy but i guess i fucking need stress
I'm depressed
Look at life from another side
Yo your wife and your brother died
Where am I?
Smoking on a tacken while your bitch is on the wagon
I'm a dragon i'm a dragon i'm a mother fucking dragon",https://genius.com/Baro-sura-see-less-lyrics
One Hour,Just Problems You Need To Know,2017,"Uh
Listen closely the hand is speaking
Look all you Niggas acting weak
But I see the weekend
I plan to get up in a cloak
And leave me fucking freezing
And land and dip inside a beamer
When i'm up and leaving
We blowing weed and see police
But we can keep it steaming
I stash the G's so all he sees is the fucking misdemeanour
Mister dreaming if he think he gonna book me
I'm sprinting like a runner
Shit he running like a bookie
Cashed and fitted in some butter goods
They won't find me wearing Stussy
Got my mind up on the tick
But my eyes just on that pussy nigga
Flex your eyelids when you looking nigga
Exercise this and my heart is
When she on mind
Posing on the top
Yo your dome is mine
In a high-vis
I focus on a watch like all I own is time
But it's daylight savings darl

I only get one hour
I only get one hour with you
I only get one hour
So please just hear it
I'm isolated flying girl feed my spirit

Alright, alright, alright ok
It's same occurring everyday
But these feelings just the same
I'm taking durries to the face
Now my voice is getting dim
I'm in a hurry to her place
What if time would never spin
And the night resembles space
It's the way you seem to make me feel
Just so you know that what I'm saying is real
If your love is costly watch me pay the bill
I find the drugs don't cost me a cent
I'm out here asking for cents
Trying to feed my posse of friends
Girl you rolling off in a Benz'
Not that you could offer a lift
Nigga I don't need to pretend
Got me calling Jesus think I need him again
A'int seen a church in a minute
It's just the earth and i'm in it
The way i work is kicking dirt
And Berba spinning (?) percentages
Something like I'm never giving
She leave with 53 i'm only taking 47
But I can't help but like it
There's pythons in the grass my nigga
And the earth the tight bit
I hope you feel this shit and feel enlightened
Real excited
I'm human when am I gonna understand
Going off the shit i'm writing
I'm dammed
Me fighting a man
The lights in my hand
I'm bout to spark it up in
I ain't doing nothing
When you tell me pass the dutch

I only get one hour
I only get one hour with you
I only get one hour
So please just hear it
I'm isolated flying girl feed my spirit
One hour (one hour)
I only get one hour with you (I only get one hour with you)
I only get one hour with you (I only get one hour with you)
I'm isolated flying girl feed my spirit",https://genius.com/Baro-sura-one-hour-lyrics
FUCK THE JUDGE,Just Problems You Need To Know,2016,"Fuck the judge
Fuck the jury
If i do bad
Fucking sue me
But if you shoot me
I won't be dead
Just a body without a head
And I won't find love
I won't find it in this earth
As I pick my heart back up i'm reminded what you're worth

Cos' all I do is think of you
I don't know why I think of you
All I do is think of you
I don't know why I think of you

Fuck the judge
Fuck the jury
If i do bad
Fucking sue me
But if you shoot me
I won't be dead
Just a body without a head
(Kiel Bol: Skit)
Fuck ya'll ya fucking bitch ass nigga
Ya fucking hoe-ass niggas
If I see ya'll niggas again
I'mma kill y'all niggas
And for the cops
Come around the corner nigga
And take your badge off
Fucking hoe-ass nigga

Mr officer if I bring my weed
Backstage to cremate it before I go and teach
Shake a couple hands
Killin' MC
Then roll home in an Uber
Ex looking for sleep
Then why you hassle me sir?
The venue that we are in is at full capacity sir
All the people here are drugged
Smashing the terps
That equals causalities
I just wanna go home and watch anime with my girl
How's that a threat?
Or where's your respect
Last week Miggy got jumped
And smacked in the head
And Slav got got his bag jacked on Flinders Street steps
And you rolled up treating him like suspects
Nah nah piggy that's not correct
I heard your job is serve and protect
But sir your profile like the side of my head
You're racist and inadequate
Can I be more direct?
Get the fuck out of hear

Fuck the judge
Fuck the jury
If i do bad
Fucking sue me
But if you shoot me
I won't be dead
Just a body without a head

Coppa tryna stop a flagrant nigga with a prophecy
I'm popping' something shady
Bet my pappa really proud of me
This shit be really crazy
All my problems get the best of me
Lips forever bare figured you desire therapy
My fists in the air with my suicidal tendencies
(You you you)
Who are my contemparies?
I don't see the difference between a hospital and cemetery
I don't see the difference between a butterfly and centipede
And ain't a fucking difference between a piggy and my enemies
I'm too damn high to chose a side
All the repercussion surfaced now it's do or die
In the city yell at officers to do their job
Kinda silly but its the way I'mma lose my pride
So I'mma slow my roll
I'mma hold my goal
Yo I'm shinning as I'm penning this
And so is my soul
So I could click a trigger on a pistol to bleed
Or I could figure that the one only issue is me

I don't know why i'm so down on myself
You would abolish all these problems
Or at least you might help
I know it
I guess it's about the way you move your body girl
I'mma test the perfect female is it you?
If you fail you are infact the prototype
Come with me you've got nothing to lose
I know it, I
I know it, I
I know it, I",https://genius.com/Baro-sura-fuck-the-judge-lyrics

Travellin’ Through Time,HOWGOODISGOOD,2014,"Get your mind right
Rolling up a cigarette
Eyes up on a high flight
Mines mixed Cyanide
I am right
On every finer night
Or a brighter day
I can say
I stay smoking till my eyes are grey
I cut the weed with a Vikings blade
I bust the seeds in a titans face
How do my kids taste
And meanwhile you been checkin all this new shit
Like “baro your raps are tight but they really don’t do shit”
Well fuck that
Still stupid as when I was a rugrat
Now the only thing is I cough crack
Spittin all these rocks the stones flat
That’s just a fun fact
For you fat faggot amateurs
Skiddadle just
Run to the woods with your mother fuckin allergies
Thorns on a bush and that’ll open up bag of bees
And my nuts that’ll clog up your throat
I’m not up these notes
Got the product a hoax

Travelling through time feeling average
Future holds the past get your ass up in a salad dish
Start eating
And quit fuckin beefin
The only thing that’s needed
The future comes with freedom

I need some future from some bad toast
An asshole
With mad flow
It’s baro
Posted where the grass grows
A couple castles
Prolly a pink jet
Where I could light my cigarettes
And a simple rest
Up in the cockpit
Drunk and cathartic
Punk gotten star sick
He strums with guitar picks
Held up in hostage
With a bitch but it’s all bliss
Searching for the ventis but I left them in the office
But for now I’m just chilling in the bungalow
Mum is so
Stressed where her mother fuckin son will go
Charlie on the phone like
""What the fuck you doing man?""
Chopping up these bones feeling loopy like toucan sam
Two can dance
With some jazz and a smooth accent
What kinda proof that send
Like you gotta pay more to get a couple
Or the less they love you
Should invest in double
Cause the guests can subdue
All your dreams and your silly fuckin fantasys
Let em shorten things from whatever you can plan to be
I need a jet
I need a fuckin race car
I need a lil money so I can cop a couple race cards
Till I can face broads
Head high as everest
Talk with my parents knowing they will never stress
Then ill never be depressed",https://genius.com/Baro-sura-travellin-through-time-lyrics
I Never Meant To Hurt U,17/18,2015,"Am I dreaming
Am I dreaming
You got me feigning for that feeling
You got me smoking on my lows now
You got me speeding I won't slow down
And I never meant to hurt you
What was meant for one could really hurt two
And they not worth what you worth
You are worth a trillion dollars
And a mother fucking puppy
I just want you to just love me
I just want to say the stars are fucking ugly now
The sun is out but I'm feeling grouse
She said I hate the fact I left you with no warning
Now I'm here inside my room locked with the accordion
I said it cos' I regret it
Put the pistol to my head and
Make the bullet here impeded
To my brain
Put the stains on my new t-shirt
But that don't matter did my research
About the after life
And fate don't just exist it mother fucking battle right
I hate this bogus shit
I'm battling with Baro's mind
And i just might pull the trigger now
I'm sorry for my stupidness
I'm sorry I couldn't

And it's true, and it's true

There's no room left for us to grow
I loved you enough to let you go
Now nothing left for us to face to fix
We're fixated on loss
When love won't give in
Every time I hear you say
You never meant to cause me pain
You hurt yourself to make me stay
Hurts me more when you say you'll change
You'll change

Thanks for keeping it authentic it was fair to know
Thanks for sparing me time (for I to bare my soul)
Harold melvin and the bluenotes out my stereo
Yesterday I had the blues
Today I'm getting vertigo
I'm standing on the roof
Who say I'm fairly low
I guess the height is something til my curtains closed

I want our children at my funeral
Our building looking beautiful
Flowers by the sink but the exteriors unusual

Cinema,HOWGOODISGOOD,2014,"Come on!

Keep my eyes peeled looking for intelligence
For sentiments are venemous
Scheming on your relevence
Devillish but heaven sent
Fuck it's not this kid again?
Ashin' out a Mercedez Benz
With my hash in my Timberlands
Sippin' on some Jamesons
Eating all you caveman
Hoes on the floor and they're rocking all the latest trends
 with the black boots
She had two
Shake that bottle like that ass do
Sitting all alone with a spliff lit
The bud mystic
Styles so sadistic
Apocalyptic
Mind stinks similar
Watch the world burn while we sitting in a cinema
I'm just looking for a friend of her

But for now we can just sit down and vibe out
Too much fun to call a fucking time out, nigga

Anticipate my greatness
Watching  now I'm on your bitches playlist
I'm rolling up the same spliff
Vibing where the saints is
Higher than a pilot
But my mind is on maintenance
But I don't need rap I need some inspirations
I vibe to the music if it's nothing but a bass

Toasted as fuck
Man I'm looking for a prophecy
Flicking through the bible tryna act like the prophets be
Need privacy cause I'm not really fucking proud of me

Tryna turn this shit to a masterpiece
Blast the piece
While I'm half deceased
Hand the keys
I'ma bake your whip like it's mac and cheese
I'ma make her strip then I make her tease
Lost within a trip
Im just mad that she's
Blowing trees
Occupy her time then I slowly leave
Barry: Don't you smoke?
Baro: Yeah man yeah I do
I'm only pleased by the goods in the bad's or the fruits in the trees
And thats probably
Why my ex bitch left
With a hole in my soul and a slice
 in my chest
Im not nice to the rest
Only polite to the guests
Or enticing a bitch

Man fuck it
Can you taste the strife in the fucking...Raps",https://genius.com/Baro-sura-your-possessions-lyrics

You know who it is

And wherever you at
If you on the toilet or the car

Trying to stay real
Now these bitches round here yelling babe chill
Smoking on my low spot

Shit
17 and this rapping life
The mother fucking after life
Hash and bikes
Pass the mic
Bout' to go on tour and I don't really know what that is like
Vision and galore
Loving pussy from some saddest dykes
Parasites, namaste
Yo I'd really love to go
But shit I'm sorry yo I gotta stay
I gotta a lot of steaks
Smoking on some Cali grapes
Why you talk bout' smoking boy
I dunno it's hard to say
Drifting off as we drive away
The mother fuckers see your colours
Through your eyes are grey
If you try to fuck with me
I wouldn't do shit bitch I'm in custody
But I probably wouldn't do shit if I wasn't
Still I'll leave your ass beat up
That's word to my cousin
Put your words and assumptions
In your mother fucking backside

Fuck the opposition
You called the fight
But the cops are missing
I lost my wisdom in the pot pissing
Now I'm standing here pissing with my bad religion
Tried to hear but it's hard to listen
Despite my (?) fight ambition
Drunkest tool in the universe
An honest fool but my bruises hurt from Lucifers
Looking for belief sort of Jupiter
She think i'm cool but i'm knew to her
Do the work
Do the math
I'm trading slaps with your stupid ass
Carry arrows just like cupid has
Barry Baro would just rob a hood
I'm with the feds while we rob the good and feed the bad
I'm thin and reacher just like seasons had
The reasons mad at the (?)
Throw peas
Fuck the vegetable
More weed in the edibles

This Is My Introduction,HOWGOODISGOOD,2014,"It's Baro, it's Baro
And I'm up in this motherfucker blazed
Mel-fucking-bourne city
'Bourne city by the way
Uh, Ivory Cove, looking at these motherfuckers
Blazing that  and shit...
I'm up here making music 
 ready for that trance
 understand this that fucking hard D nigga (haha)

Wait-wait-wait-wait wait...

I got to find a piece of mind
To piece these rhymes
Well whatever, stressing got me finding piece with 9s
Read between the lines
Read between the hatred
Looking for belief, soar to heaven in a spaceship
Mum passing out, blow cigarettes and blaze spliffs
Never bless, he change shifts
Is this a test? I'll ace this
With the best since 8th grade
Spitting 'til my tooth ache
Figured I'm on a crusade
With a broke bitch and a shoelace
Tight around my waist
And I fuck her in the face
And caught a upper on the 
Uppercut you fucking lames
That's whats up, the ruckus makes
Got a couple bucks in change
I'll probably spend it on the same shit
I got niggas in your placement (ha)
I'm trying to kill off all you racists
Sip the cup, tip the chasers
Chug a broad that blazes

Kid is talking stainless
Cap you in the face to unload the fucking chambers
Blaow blaow blaow
Fuck your etiqutte
Said it with some medicines
My friends up in my residence
Smoking weed like- where the fuck my momma at?
Couple missed calls, guess tonight I'll fucking call her back
*sung* I guess I'll call her back
Smoking weed like- where the fuck my momma at?
Couple missed calls, guess tonight I'll fucking call her back

This Is My Outro,17/18,2015,"When the sun go down I'm here
When the sun comes up I'm here
Nothing to fear
I'm just being sincere
When the sun go down I'm here
When the sun comes up I'm here
Nothing to fear (nothing to fear)
I'm just being sincere

We tryna balance out our future straight
Been a minute since the bully hit the loser's face
Her ass sloppy ask em' how them doobies taste
Doobies taste great
Spinning like a Bey-Blade
Winning cos' what they say
Means nothing on my brain waves
And now the dough and the cheese
Comes with mayonnaise
And shit the hoes come for free
They just say his name
I ain't insane just a bit deranged
Super motivated so this shit can stay the same
Elevate, elevate, elevate, elevate

When the sun go down I'm here
When the sun comes up I'm here
Nothing to fear (nothing to fear)
I'm just being sincere
When the sun go down I'm here
When the sun comes up I'm here
Nothing to fear (nothing to fear)
I'm just being sincere

My auroras ordinary
Called a mortuary
Looking for a corpse to bury
Sort of berries
Cos' the poison ones are more than scary
Now i'm lost in a vision
But my vision can't see straight
Kept the fantasies for keepsakes
Yep I plan to be vibing when the stage (?)
Cos' these days
Nobody gives a fuck about
What ever they be loving now
Except for me
What I'm smoking on is fucking loud
Cash the centre stage
Or when its play
Put your rappers on my dinner plate
Elevate, elevate, elevate, elevate

When the sun go down I'm here
When the sun comes up I'm here
Nothing to fear
I'm just being sincere
When the sun go down I'm here
When the sun comes up I'm here
Nothing to fear
I'm just being sincere
Just vibe with me
Just vibe with me
I know I try to see god
Scared I'll never meet him though
Trapped inside the backyard
Weather like three below
You just tryna act hard
I never try to see him though
They're lurking in peripherals
They're work is fucking minimal

Under 18 is this life set?
Well probably not I'm just focused on my mindset
My minds best in a spot rolling doobies up
High and confused wondering who to trust (who do i trust?)
But who is you to us
Bitch i'm twisting Buddha dust
It's RD over everything
Bitch your crew, it sucks
Never given two fucks about
Who you are
Where you been
Suck my loose nuts
Shit I'm touring now
That ain't expected
The pains inflicted to the lames saying ""he's a dickhead""
But I ain't talking
I don't listening
I don't even want a bitch to fucking put my dick in then
That's a bit tense
But what i'm saying is I could do this shit for free
But now they paying
It's me
Oh it's me
It's me
Oh it's me
Baro
My mum calls me Baro
My eyes open but I'm dead asleep
I can see shit
But I ain't doing anything
I'm just observing",https://genius.com/Baro-sura-this-is-my-outro-lyrics

WHAT’S WRONG?,WHAT’S WRONG? - Single,2020,"Lowkey
This tainted air and no sleep
The show creepin
I gotta play i got cold feet
This no weekend
I get the pay and we both eat
Its so easy
Bruh don't be no diva
We the holy ghost keepers
Their souls sold
Their approach is so eager and so bold
Leave it alone
Keep the location of our home on a need to know
And where the feet’ll to go
We storing reefer so i'm breathing slow
Leave when its free to go
And when we get it you better believe its so
Though to each its own
I'm sensing 7s, you are even
I’m strategic
I see through these people
Like a TV nigga
I feel stoned and uneasy
I'm broke and my poems getting no loving lately
Whats wrong? I don't know
This is seasonal baby
An evil occasion

So how long will it take
Til' the day where the world recognise mistakes
There's no more time to play
The proof is all around with the world today
Mother earth forgive our sins
And father help this world we're in

Inception
Intervention with myself
I'm in question
Pondering my knowledge and wealth
An investment
Writing new testaments
Guide me through treacherous times
So each step is aligned
Thats the Inner soul
Roll a ciggie up  then light it drink a piccolo
Got a cut back on my vices not committed though
Praying that my lungs don't sail off with  my liver boat
But whats a little smoke when the whole coasts on fire
Give me my lighter
And the Government sold all the water to buyers
We’ve got a riot
And world war 3’s about to see alot of brown people die
We need a messiah
Or collective efforts to put oppressor on trial
I don't know whats less likely
But the time is now

What’s wrong with this world today?
(You see the man turning sheep into lamb)
What's wrong with this world today?
(Don't got a moment you can not hold it again)
What's wrong with this world today?
(We need the land we can’t eat rubber band)
What's wrong with this world today?
(Today, Today, Today)
What's wrong with this world today?
(You see the man turning sheep into lamb)
What's wrong with this world today?

What's wrong with this world today?

It's a must I do
This a tough life
Never enough time
It's level up time
Don't be stuck down
But if my gut lie and the love dies then i'ma have to cut ties
Gotta see it together before i severe it
This forever i choose
This ain't nothing nice
This is overpriced
This the other side
I'm under covers like a poltergeist
I'm another kind
This the other side
I'm under covers like a poltergeist
You can see it in my eyes
The reaper singing lullabies
His tone get deeper in the summertime
Switched my phone to a beeper incase I come in contact
With a whole different evil I gotta combat
My peoples where my hearts at
The easels where the arts at
I'm peaceful when I talk back
You talk smack
Fall back
(Fall back)
I'm seeing something
Like Stevie Wonder these are innervisions
And i'm dreaming of em
I tried to show love
I tried to give a shoulder
This life a full cup until it runneth and it's over
Sometimes it's nice to roll up and freeze the moment
I call to God
To see atonement
This no facade
I'm really living with a broken heart
It's so bizarre
To my defence I really know my job
And i'm working hard
And when shit get hard
I get in charge

I gotta go before its too late
My time is today
No time to delay
I thought that i told ya
Gotta go before its too late
My time is today
No time to delay
I thought that i told ya
Gotta go before its too late

Third eyed vision playing 
I repo, my whole heart from up your depo
To your bedroom
The place you and I shared our dreams
Where they fled to
I bet you
 put you in the best mood
You said you would always be there in the fucking end
It's a shame you'd only be there as a fucking friend
Baby trust me I can live with that
Cause now I'm more than happy kicking raps
Main reason why I always fucking hit you back
{kissing sound}
Sounds so soft don't you agree?
Yeah, so light the incense back up
And get a jay in rotation
Uh, we do it for the generation
Misguided by the false images and the  that the media portray
From day to day
Yeah, just chill and what more can I say
