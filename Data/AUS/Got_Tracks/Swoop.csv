Apple Eyes,,1995,"Get on the A train
Get on the right track
If you got a problem tell me
I can fix that
And if you got the rigging baby
I got the boat
And if you got a castle
Well you know I got the moat
(It's alright)
If you need some lower level
I'll be your elevator
If you want a sure glide
And if you need some time baby I got forever
I got your stuff ain't that enough?

Apple eyes drinking strawberry wine together
You and I and a blueberry sky forever

Now you're feeling hot
On account of the sun
I got the body lotion if you wanna get some
And if you want some money
Ha I got a gold mine
And if you need direction
I'm a one way sign
(That's alright)
If you need a new kind of rhythm
I got a lemon bass that plays in apricot time
Sagittarius or Leo or Libran
I'll be your zodiac on a different star track

Chorus (x2)

Hit it Girl
I Think I love You
Ohhhhhh

Apple eyes drinking strawberry wine together
You Got A Problem I Can Fix That
You and I and a blueberry sky forever
I got the body lotion if you wanna get some get some, babe
Apple eyes drinking strawberry wine together
Together, Together, Together, Together,
You and I and a blueberry sky forever
Forever.",https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/15482740/Swoop/Apple+Eyes
Look around people,,1998,"INTRO [Swoop]

VERSE 1 [Swoop]
The world is a sick place elected leaders
Want to change laws , and neglect ta free us
Do us all wrong, and neglect to feed us
Mexicans native blacks they f**ing beat us
Now they wanna act like, they don't need us
Land of the free, freedom will miss lead us
Who will succeed us, before they all bleed us
Look at history and see how Europeans treat us
Yes we believe it, brainwashed we feed it
To our babies in our schools tell em put your faith in Jesus
Raising up a nation full of hatred fueld by reason
A wise man can't change the devils that precced him
Martin luther king had a dream, we dream in freedom
John and bobby kennedy screaming out treason
Shoot there a**es to , in a government agreement
They k**in off the leaders who stand up for the people

HOOK [Swoop and Hustleezy]

Look around people, what do you see?
(what do you see)
Frowning face, and tears from you and me
(from you and me)
The government cheating, they don't love us , no they don't
(no they don't)
People all around the world, feeling lost with no hope
(no hope)
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/swoop/-/look-around-people.html]

VERSE [Hustleezy]
I got my eyes in the sky hoping the sun will come
And hear em birds singing peace freely flying in the sky
Counting stars and till the end of my sight
But guess what
When I'm looking at the world I see no life on it eyes
sh**!
We crying a Nile river the world is drowning to d**h
Wine and dinning while Africans are starving to d**h
In my forefathers land I'm feeling prisoned and cursed
Now can somebody tell me if that is what the freedom worth?
Jesus
We're all lost with these lies they preach to us
Scientist brainwashing manipulators
k**ed our freedom fighters, and conspiring against us
Claim that we're free while we surrounded by borders
Destroying our unity and love just to defeat us
(wow)
Give em guns they will k** each-other
(why)
This civilization is k**ing our cultures
Hold my hand brothers and sisters let's take a step to paradise

HOOK [Swoop and Hustleezy]
