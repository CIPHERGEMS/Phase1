Jam hot,The Umu,2008,"Take a flight, passport, Jam may be gritty
Cause your listening to the boy from the big beat, beat, Oi!
Speaking something fresh be my guest at the matinee
Flowing through the veins is the blood of Cab Calloway
Under the spotlight but not in front of a big band
Tell me… How much charisma can you withstand?
Step inna de place to be gracefully gracious
Hear some sly remarks but let the haters be haters
It's a full house but there's no card dealing
A wink to the haters to show there's no hard feelings (Naaah!)
Even if you said 'Hau is fake'
Don't bother getting your flat brim bent outta shape (Naaah!)
Just cos you're here without a date
Don't take it out on me, man, I'll show you how to make
A move so smooth. Oh you just gotta see
Honestly you gotta speak confidently
On the beat I dance like 'ooh sexy'
On the beat you dance like two left feet
You're dancing to the words; man you gotta loosen up, bruh
If you get it right then you get to loosen up bras
Remove panties then do what you gotta
International – do the lambada
Tank fly boss walk jam nitty gritty
You're listening to the boy from the big bad city
This is jam hot (let me tell you…)
This is jam hot
Tank fly boss walk jam nitty gritty
You're listening to the boy from the big big big big...
Dressed to impress, but it's not a zoot suit
But I look fresh, as them brothers used to
Quick with the wit like them brothers in the Juice Crew
When I gets loose, I leave brothers with a loose tooth
Clicking my fingers like Spike and Denzel
At the start of Malcolm X in a Friday night special
Whatever joint you chose – I got the pointy shoe shuffle
Where the naughty girls shimmer and the naughty boys hustle
Enter the dancehall swinging off the chandelier
Eyeing of your chain like, “Give it up! Hand it here!”
Escape out the back never to be seen again
Disappear into the dark's unknown parts (yo!)
Clear out the windpipe – crisp clean pin stripe
Tell a honey dip what my insight been like
She's under my spell – we under the dim light
She's breathless cos my grips like skin tight
Red light, green light, 1, 2, 3
Sporting turbo glasses like a young Bruce Lee
With a one-inch punch I can punch through trees
So don't get mad if ya hon' chose me (uh!)
Tank fly boss walk jam nitty gritty
You're listening to the boy from the big bad city
This is jam hot
This is jam hot
Tank fly boss walk jam nitty gritty
You're listening to the boy from the big bad city
This is jam hot
This is jam hot
""eeeeyyyyyooooww""
After the show is the after party and…
After the party is the hotel lobby and…
After tequila it's probably vodka
After a slow dance, man, we break it down proper
This the way that we run things and no, we don't stop
All over the country 'til the wheels fall off
This the way that we run things and no, we don't stop
All over the country 'til the wheels fall off",https://genius.com/Koolism-jam-hot-lyrics
Welcome to the Umu,The Umu,2008,"Yes, haha
Right about now
We'd like to welcome you all to The 'Umu, uh
And you know what they say
Good things come to those who wait
Ay, I know you've been waiting a long time
And you know we appreciate that
So if you're ready, grab your plates
Put down those forks and knife, man
You're about to eat with your hands, haha",https://genius.com/Koolism-welcome-to-the-umu-lyrics
Another World,,2001,"1: Hau]
You dirty rat, talking shit trying to send me back
To hell from where you came from
You sing that same song, every time I hear you
It sounds like you off ya flame plus you drink too much beer too
Your queer crew aren't shit neither
A bit eager to get a kid beater
With the blunt side of a machete
It's my cunt side that's so upsetting
Letting off steam like tutsi Quasar streams
Empty ya dreams, getting ripped at the seams
Harsh are the words from a biblical fiend
Cussing out the evil in you
It's amazing what evil people will do
To get the chance to dance and swing with the king
Shine without the bling bling
But B-Boys can't understand cause it's a Koolism thing see
Single-handedly, or even if I got my uncle down with me
We're taking out your whole family
From nephews, to second cousins, to your old bitch
To your half brother, down to your gold fish (oh ish)
You understanding me? Cause it's hunting season
And picking them off your family tree like
One by one, two by two, the almighty Koolism crew
The who is who of Aussie hip-hop
While I'm a sick cunt, your just a sick cock
In a piss trough so piss off

2: Suffa]
MC's think they're too deaf, to hear what I'm telling them
But they can't see me like tattoos on melanin
I'm large like Van Halen in the 80's
Ladies I love, ladies can't step bitches
Cut the track til it requires stitches
Like fruit fly in citrus, I'm I'll-tech like Tetris? Just skill?, come and see what my vocal fetches
I give open lectures, in the park under Wattle trees
Until a fight sparks, and someone's baptised by the bottle we
Try chill, but it bothers me, that violence always erupts
The crowd is feeling me, like a pair of perfect D cups
Yo we up in here like last year's out of here
The hoods up, in here til we tired or out of beer
And we represent it, like the sort of the state
And we staying independent like the ward of the state
Yo I'm-bored-of-the-fake, hi fake! Named Suffa, pleased to meet ya
I live inside the mind of the listener through the speaker
(Is that your beeper?) No it's my phone, I got it on-beeper-and-vibrate
I rock's it for my people til my people's pupils dilate
Yo why hate, those on top, I'm coming from the bottom
Cut the track to my man who comes and puts the pressure on em!

3: Pressure]
I look MC's in their eyes and ask em what they think's wrong with this rap scene
And what their lacking, thinking that here I got their vaccine
I'm wavering from their battering with the slip of my mix
Think they can battle with headphones until they listen to this!
Kicking the hits, the Hoods and Koolism, I'm serious this
Is guaranteed to get some head nod til you slip and you diss
So persist with a diss! Man you believe it?
But they aren't even half-stepping, nah man they more like paraplegic
I rock em til they cease and keep it rough when get fucked
When I leave em scarred so hard they wouldn't heal if Jesus touched them
The rough blend like masturbating with a cheese grater
The MC breaker, never been a faker, please I'm greater!
By any means I make the track pound
Whether that be taking your integrity and exposing, yeah that's wack sound
Back down! Pressure got you where your caught, end it Suffa, swerve!
Step into the cipher, it's another world",http://www.songlyrics.com/hilltop-hoods-feat-koolism/another-world-lyrics/
The two hemispheres,,2000,"Torchmann:
Vinyl fliegt durch die gottverdammte Gegend wie fliegende Untertassen, was
Wollt ihr schon mit euren kleinen Panzern unternehmen gegen unsern Krassen Hass
Selbst die allerhaertesten unter euch sogar die unterlassen das
Und hams geblickt das wir hier sind um die ganze Welt zu erfassen las
Die Maerchen Maerchen sein und checkt was wir berichten
Die ausserirdischen sind im Haus und ham Bock euch zu vernichten
Schuhmacher faehrt Ferrari sowie Dj Skizo mit'm Vestax Monza - Milano Monster bleibt das Scratch-As
Zivilisation macht euch bereit fuer die Invasion
Alien Army, Zulu Sound System , Micsmen in Kombination
Wir geben das Mikrofon rum
Wie ne Tuete Gras
Doch alles was ich las ueber uns waren Luegen Jungs das wars
Wir hocken im Keller seit Stunden es schneit jeder schweigt bald kommt die Zeit das
Interesse an intelligenten Interviews im internationalen Internet steigt
Doch ich warne euch bald ist es zu Spaet der Tag an dem Torch dann live vor euch eht ja ich warne euch bald ist es zu Spaet der Tag an dem
Torchmann live vor euch steht

MC Thorn:
Lost in between the dreams it seem reality was playin trix on me
I guess my next stage will a bondi beach on replay catchin A's and B's
And now I see im at the age of 22 the light on my path it's guided me right thru to 98
Where I'll be chosen and makin the picks
Never making same old mistakes
Excluding all the plastic fake they wanna be rich
And now you know how fast I switch
From lady JJ to the mischief I must admit
I had comments satisfying my adrenalin rush
Was swept thru office blocks
Cleaning up undles of oucas left behind the eyes
Combat welcome or let it be done on the sly
Im always making and taking and splitting it with my crew
A 5 year dedication for the life styles that i choose
Realizing golden fingers fucked my actuide towards the ones
The only ones that have fath in me a rythmatically
I bounce from town to town
I got a automatic shield it's going round and round




MC Hau: ..

El Presidente:
Fear .. fear .. so
what .. You want to confront yourself with the greatest
Explore down the meanders
Bring some of what you smuggle
And come in peace like Gandhi
Visiting our territories
These explorers carrying energies from outside They
amplify doubts and certainties
Different origins
Miseries and riches the same
How to oppose
Hunger in the mind you can feel the bites
Why remain amorphous
Orphans of a culture that has generated us
Degenerates continue to be venerated
But they are false divinities
And the impossible is to reach of those who know
You don't think about it but it's immense
It is a moment to drown us even for those with gills
We will meet in free zones
Maybe we will not even see each other
Broken windows
From the tip of the diamond
And you will wonder where you were
When the most serious without too many sclerae
They connected the two hemispheres
Zulu Sound System .. Mc Thorn .. Koolizm .. beautiful Ski .. the Aliens .. Esa .. Genti Guaste 98 ..
Go Polaz .. how is it ...
Alien Army .. remember this 4 ever .. no one can do it better .. Alien Army ... no one can do it better ...
But don't be so sad my little friends, the story doesn't end here you know, but no!
.. Skizo .. on technicians .. like a criminal .. this message is will now become subliminal .. Ha Ha Ha ..
Fuck You !!",https://genius.com/Gente-guasta-i-due-emisferi-lyrics
