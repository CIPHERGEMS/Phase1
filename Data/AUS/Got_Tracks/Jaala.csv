Salt Shaker,Hard Hold,2015,"I lick the salt right off my hand
Helps me to feel that I'm still by that ocean
That's where I left my whole family
I'm pretty sure God made us lot big broken

They all forgive me when they're dead
They all forgive me when they're dead and gone

Those happy, holy, heinous houses
They spread out and out for mileses
Oh, I'd rather give my two good playin’ hands
Than to stay in that hot climate
And marry one of those men

They all forgive me when they're dead
They all forgive me when they're dead and gone

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoo
King tight crescent moon mud crack
Shelley Brown and George and all the moral vested trolley boys
Large, hard hands holding half empty cans whilst drivin’
Yeah, I was pourin’ pints for fuck heads at the Berlin Point Hotel

They all forget me when they're dead
They all forget me if they haven't already yet

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh
See I got my focus on salt shaker
I got my baby on

Double Dutch,Hard Hold,2016,"How we rose to ask
Please, just one more sip?
Even if we do not want

Into that something else

How you gonna make ends meet?
How you gonna make a wedding ring?

Show me the marks that you got
Double dutch, these are the marks on my heart
And I can't get em off
Ow, ow, ow, wow
Ow, ow, ow, wow

Do only the things that suit me just fine?

Why
Do I stay in the place that keeps me hid?

I'll just lead you down to the lowlands
That's where I bide my time

In perfect working order
All this love
In perfect working order
All this beat
Order
Melody in a particular
Order
Orders
No wonder you find it hard
You were being ridden
No wonder you find it hard to rise up
You were being riddled
Under sixty-two moons
Hidden only by the distance
Nothing much else to do but
Revel like an infant at the

Orders
Order
Yea- order
If you want to rise up as sweet angels do
Rid all of this trouble over her
The answers aren't going to propose to you
But all of this trouble over her
All this trouble over the hill

No wonder I find it hard
Bathing in the system
Well no wonder I find it hard
Im warmed in my nepotism

Ssssshhhhhhhhhhh-
Oh, there's nothing much else left to but
Give up trying to hide it

Hard Hold,Hard Hold,2016,"Hard, hard hold
Hard, hard hold
Never got old with you
The hard, hard hold
Hard, hard hold
Never got old with you
Then, you confessed
You found it hard
How will I recover?
I'm still in love with you

It's hard, hard to
Hard, too hard to
Unfold this hold with you
It's hard, hard to
Hard, too hard to
Unfold this hold with you
Then I realised
It's just a matter of trying
So I'll have a little slice of bread
To help dilute the drunkenness
Drunkenness
Drunkenness

It's hard, hard to
Hard, too hard to
Unfold this hold with you
It's hard, hard to
Hard, too hard to
Unfold this hold with you

And now I feel so tired
How will I recover?
Im still in love with him
Love with him
Love with him

I'll have a little slice of bread
To help dilute the drunkenness
Drunkenness
Drunkenness
It's only after you heard the fact
You find they stole your whole alphabet
Alphabet
Alphabet
Then you can justify why you put up with it
Up with it
Up with it

So can you putty up the holes in my heart?
Can you hold onto my lonely heart?
Can you straighten up my crooked mind?
Sharing is a bowl of soup
But you drunk it dry
It dry, It dry
Drunk it dry

So I beg for more than ageing as the cruel
Oh, here I'll leave it
Oh, here I'll tie it to my youth
Yeah, I got new strength
You cannot have none
Or find me
Here I will find rest
Yeah, here I will find rest

A nudge in the right direction
So I could get it right
Uh!
Cheers

You made every mistake
Seemed like a happy holiday
Yeah, I am so glad to have met you
I, I am so glad to have met you
You showed me the hair to win
Cut right off your head
Well I couldn't believe it was dead
Still looked attached
A shiny somethin' blonde
Blonde
Now you go to the other side of the world
To be with a man called Toast
I would, I'd like to come and visit if I can get
That money together
Together
Together
Together

You've gave me a, a little hide
So I could clear the huddle
Wide
So I could face the view
You've gave me a little stride
So I could get to it
A nudge in the right direction
So I could get it right

Do you hum them out, strum them out
Spread them all around your world?
Does it help you to be my boy?

I found you, love
I tried, but I can't shrug it off
Don't you listen to me when I'm harping on and on?
Don't you listen to me when I'm harping on and on?

Because it's questioning
Is this really what we want?
So ask me now
Oh, ask me in a thousand years
Oh, ask me now
Oh, ask me in a thousand years
