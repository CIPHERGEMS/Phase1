Put It on Me,Rule 3:36,2000.0,"Where would I be without you?

Where would I be without my baby?
The thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
But every thug needs a lady

Girl, it feel like you and I been mourning together
Inseparable, we chose pain over pleasure
For that you'll forever be a, part of me
Mind, body and soul ain't no I in we (baby)
When you cry who wipes your tears
When you scared, who's telling you there's nothin' to fear
Girl, I'll always be there
When you need a shoulder to lean on
Never hesitate knowing you can call on, your soul-mate
And vice versa, that's why I be the first to
See Jacob's and frost your wrist up
Now you owe me, I know you're tired of being lonely
So baby girl, put it on me

Where would I be without you? (Uh)
I only think about you (yeah)
I know you're tired of being lonely (lonely)
So baby girl, put it on me (put it on me)
Where would I be without you? (Uh)
I only think about you (yeah)
I know you're tired of being lonely (lonely)
So baby girl, put it on me (put it on me)

Yo, and I appreciate the rocks and gifts that you cop me, baby
And that house on the hill when you drop like 80
On a down payment thinking damn ain't life gravy
And ever since for my honey I been twice the lady
What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm
When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip, cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor
Baby boy we been down since junior high
So when life get hot in July it's the world against you and I
We ballin', tied together and never
Heart from the heart, knew that it would last forever
When you told me, you would never leave me lonely
So baby boy put it on me

Where would I be without you? (Uh)
I only think about you (yeah)
I know you're tired of being lonely (lonely)
So baby girl, put it on me (put it on me)
Where would I be without you? (Uh)
I only think about you (yeah)
I know you're tired of being lonely (lonely)
So baby girl, put it on me (put it on me)

Since we met it's been you and I
A tear for a tear, baby eye for an eye
And you know that my heart gon cry
If you leave me lonely
'Cause you not just my love you my homie
Who's gonna console me, my love
I'm outta control hold me, my love
'Cause I'm yours
And I don't wanna do nothin' to hurt my baby girl
If this was our world it'd be all yours, baby
The thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
Cause every thug needs a lady (yeah, yeah)
I feel you baby cause them eyes ain't lying
Wash away all the tears there be no more crying (baby)
And you complete me, and I would die if you ain't wit me
So baby girl put it on me

Always On Time,Pain Is Love,2001.0,"Always there when you call 
(Buckshots, ha)
, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But, baby, you know the name, and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game, so back me down in the paint
Cause I can't wait no more
Cause it's about a quarter past three and shorty's eyeing me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades
Throw down on the bed while I'm yanking your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smacking your ass and fucking you all wild
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a Dear Ja letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money over bitches,
 
Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

Oh, I'm feeling like you living a double life
Cause you don't be coming home sometimes
Baby, but you're always on time, checking for one time
You and I got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me, baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine

Nothing but the motherfucking hits",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-always-on-time-lyrics

And I can't deny I 
(Love it when I'm witchu, baby)

I got a fetish for fuckin' you witcha skirt on
On the backstreet in the back seat of the Yukon
What's takin' so long? I'm gettin' anxious
But patiently waitin' for you to tell a nigga to move on
Between me and you, we can find each other
Flyin' abroad in my private G-2
I ain't tryin' to G you, ma I'm tryin to see you
Bend over, you know how we do it, feet to shoulders
Bring heat to coldest night, so ferocious
Now you street promotin' the dick game is potent
'Cause in the bed a nigga go hard like Jordan
Sweat pourin', lovin' the way you be moanin'
Grippin' the sheets, lookin' at me lickin' at me
'Cause every woman just wanna be happy

Believe me, and when you hold my body
I know you need me, wait for me bay-bay
I've been goin half crazy for your love
And I was told that the sex, better than drugs
Then get addicted, boy listen
I'm the only piece of the puzzle you're missin
Like when we kissin' - bye bye bye
You got a girl that'll - ride ride ride
So take me, tonight
And do what you do to me, baby

Shorty, are you really gettin' bored with me, or him?
'Cause though I play a lot of games, I play 'em to win
(But then again I'm still young and I'm livin' my life)
You know you're right and I'm the type
To pull up to your bumper, get your number
(Baby, I can only help but wonder)
What life would be without (my sweet baby)
And you're my baby (holla if you hear me)

Ooohhh... ooohh...
You can understand that my love is pain
And how I feel in vain, it's just a woman thang
(It's a man's world, but I understand)
But there's still nothin' different, boy, stick to the plan
(You be my down ass, witcha round ass)
I know I'm feelin you (like you feelin' me)
The way you're holdin my body, the way you touch me

And if there's any change left
I toss you on down to the west
And let (westside) the road ride down on ya
California Love

It's gonna read: ""Here lie 50, who snitched on many
That half a dollar, that nickel, them dimes, and died like penny""
And Murder Inc. will send they deepest condolences and sympathies
To Aftermath and Shady, Interscope and Jimmy Iovine
Ya know your team they really some peons
Gettin peed on and linked on
I'm talkin' about faggot ass gay Dre Young
And Suge told me all about how you used to take transvestites home
And occasionally wear thongs
No wonder Feminem be cross dressin' in pumps and tight little dresses
My pumps they leave big messes
And I know the Truth Hurts when I bust reckless
Battle of the sexes, 
is that a woman or a man?
I really don't care to stand, but 50 you gon' get shot again

M-U-R-E-D-R

And these Fed's can't discuss 'em
'Cause Lighty's ""Violatin"" us, usin' his powderpuff
(Fuck you man) cryin' bitch to Russell like:


They shootin', ah Chris ya shook
And got Bus' rhymin' the same old hook
Like, they shootin', I ain't shoot up ya Land
I oughta put ya in the coroner van
Like my nigga J-MUAH!
The dandruff Vanquish should be the get away car
When I clap at your broads
And Em, what's the doo-rag for?
You never gon' have waves, you'll never know black pain
But you could become the first white rapper slain
Just get yo' money, man
The Inc. is runnin' thangs, hideout with Loose Change
And you nigga, I'ma send you to mommy
With strict orders from Gotti to hide the body
And Dre, your day's comin' too, 'cause I got a team of misfits
That squat and handle they business
'Cause, I'm SHOOTIN', at all y'all niggas
And Lil Mo, you just one of them bitches
That ain't had a hot song in how long, never
Your better off with a dick in your mouth, just shut up
Em, you claim your mother's a crackhead
And Kim is a known slut

Y'all niggas is pussy, punani, vagina
Your monologue's getting tired, now it's time to ride
Apprentice you're fired, you're no longer desired
So take off them silly chains, put back on your wire
I'm on fire; 
Harley dipped in octane
Let East Coast bang, let West Coast bang
And Rule gon' bring the ghetto gospel
To every hood possible, pushing through in the sky blue
Back with the Gods, you now, preferably the four pound
Slugs flying at the speed of sound
Tryin to catch the ears of niggas that's running their mouths
I might get my Brooklyn niggas to run in your house
I don't really understand what the running's about
But we're hunters, we take pride in airing our prey out
Leaving 'em layed out, dead, in just a sport
'Cause we ain't playing up here in New York

I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips

Yes, I'm from New York (New York)

Nigga, I can see the coke in your nose
This ain't a movie, even he got his head blown on the globe
And I was just about to find God
But now that Ma$e is back
, I think I'd much rather find a menage
And everybody talking crazy how they're AK spit
But we done did some investigating, and they ain't spray shit
Not me, I'm the truth, homie, got the industry shook like
""Naw, nigga, Joe gon' let 'em loose on me""
True Story
, I'm bringing the T back
Even Roy Jones was forced to 
Lean Back
My nigga Dre said, ""grind, Cook""
Now we killing them hard
Niggas said I must've found Pun's rhyme book
Got bitches on top of the Phantom
And the pinky got bling, like the ring around Saturn
Cook Coke Crack, niggas fiend for that
And you already know the X is where the team be at, uhh

I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips
Nigga, I'm from New York (New York)
Ruff Ryde, and D-Block and shit

And you can't take shit for granted
'Cause life is too short (too short)

Nigga, I'm from New York
(HA-HAAAEEH! And this is how we do)

I swear it couldn't be sweeter, life's a bitch
Depending on how you treat her, you might get rich
It's guaranteed you gon' die, you might get missed
For maybe two or three hours, 'til they light they spliffs
And that coke will get you a long time
But when I let 'em know the dope is out, it's like America Online
Wise has awoken, and you know they say that you deserved it
Whenever you die with your eyes open
I still hold the title, 'cause I'm in the hood
Like them little motorcycles
Stick up kids hoppin' out with them old rifles
Just doing shit for nothin', it's so spiteful, ha, I'm just like you
Word that niggas wanna murk you is in the air
A double shot of 'gac
 and the purple is in the air
And I'm not cocky, I'm confident
So when you tell me I'm the best it's a compliment
HA-HAAAEEH!

Twin Benz's, you ride hard, I ride drop
And to make it better, baby got the nina' Beretta tucked low
And I'm two cars back with the four-four
And who freaks you out, on your momma's couch, that's what us thugs be 'bout
You know me
And while I pray for love, baby pray for us, who celebrates the thugs?
My lady
Got me seekin capital game when I spit sixteen
Whether bars or sixteens in the doors of cars
A star is born
In the hood, made a name live on, R-U-L-E, ladies, feel me

Blow sellin, dough amounts to no tellin
There'll be no tellin, snitches get it back
Those gats to your backs for my boy
What part of the game is that, huh?
Niggas and they feelings cause I handle your dealings, keep your name in tact
My fame's in tact so cops won't know what it's hittin for
Now hoes wanna know what you shittin for
Cause I'm your bitch,

It's mental, mash your enemies, we out in the rental
I'm your bitch, niggas run up on ya, shift ya lungs, who's your organ donor?
What they know about, extreme meausures I'm a ride with you
And my baby three-eighty at my side
And we lock the town, I'm as down as any thug
My love, they gotta take us in blood, what


You could die from love, at any given time I could die from slugs
But that's what this life is capable of
The death and the life of a bitch and a thug, is what I'm scared of
But got a woman that ain't afraid to, tuck the toast in the Escalade
Pop on niggas that showin me shade, but only for the Rule cause that's my baby
Got me a down ass bitch with red hair, that don't care
Blazed by the shots and flares
Girl c'mon, follow me, and bust back at police, conceal ya heat
It's a bit much to blaze up
Rule and Chuck and I.G., the Murderers, I-N-C
With one on the hip, one in the holster, nigga will toast ya quick

The booty a lil' plumper and it's

Shit, who gon' love you like that?
Thug with you with it stacked to the ceiling or splittin a dub with you
Cause I play my position with cold D's, O.G.'s

This ain't your typical, everyday, one night thing
It's a physical, I'ma love you tonight thing
Love , callin' your name, put your phone in the Range
And roll over, i just really wanted to hold ya
Time to know ya - that's a good chick
Before it's all over, I'ma meat this chick
Probably treat this chick, mo' betta
Cause if you ain't - know, thugs and ladies go together
Poppin' my collar, patnah - who in the spot?
Baby, Rule in the spot; and the mug and the watch ugly
Half the hoes hate me, half them love me
The ones that hate me only hate me cause they don't trust me
And they say I'm lucky; you think I got time
To blow all this dough and do all these shows?
Or flight in the llama chargin white Rolls
Uh-oh, another episode

What, do I do?
To everybody that be livin it up, we say

Ladies, just wanna hold a name Miss Atkins
That's why they show love  with mo' passion than average
And I ain't mad at' never leave you alone
Cause the song when I'm home, like the song when I'm gone
We both grown, both got minds of our own
Plus we hit it off like first sight in ""Love Jones""
Been in, many zones, baby love it all hate it all
From, prissy women to women who go to shadows
But you know, the Rule be livin' it up
And got all y'all, givin' it up
I like a, little ooh baby, how cute are you?
With a body that rides on sexual
I got a stick, I'll ride right next to you
Do a doughnut, and cut, then I'll open it up
On the freeway, hand on the wheel, foot on the clutch
Rule baby, not givin' it up

What, do I do?

What, I do
And all my ladies that be givin it up, uhh

Live yo' life

Love you so sexy, I just want you next to me
Your whole vibe, like you high on ecstasy
Cause it ain't nuttin' but an 'Inc' thang, bay-bay
I know the pussy wet like crazy
I wanna, feel your passion, come when you askin'
Laugh when you cryin', cry when you laughin
But ain't nothing happenin', a girl got a little uptight
Turned off the light and then started crashin'
The radio blastin' ""Between Me and You""
But, you ain't on the low with that freaky thing you do
Girl I thought you knew (what I do), know I know
(what you do)
Cause it ain't a good night if you don't ain't right
Like, Teddy P let's ""Turn Off the Lights""
And, grind it out, takin' no times out

And I know you're getting bored, baby

I know you're living your life faithfully, safely, away from me (Woo!) But you miss being next to me, don't you?
Don't let her love haunt you, lust for what you want
Go for your guns and back out on anyone who tries to interfere
Or intervene
Of me peeling your wide body out of them tight jeans
Wrist on freeze, see it's on me
Shoes 19, coming through in that new Bentley thing (GIRL!!)
The talk of the town, the tease of the city (yeah)
You and I make headlines like Lo and Diddy or Bob and Whitney (WHO?)
I'm here 'cause the Lord sent me (WHO?), pound puss like a pugilist
Grin real devilish and freak bad bitches (oh-ohh)

Sweet thing, living it
Won't you let me let you live it a little bit
I know a stressful relationship is hard to deal with
But here's how to deal with it
On your weekly visits
Use a code name to protect the innocent (ha)
Maybe I'm too generous
Generally believing that all women want me
They don't wanna get even (girl, I know)
But who do you believe in
Is it money or God?
Betrayal, trust, this thing of ours  (GIRL!!)
Should be secretly held sacred, 'cause I love it when you pop your body-body
And move your body-body
Drink up on the Bacardi and rub up alongside me
I love to see you wild and free
But occasionally you get cold wet feet
And all that it means to me is you need my heat (Ja!)
'Cause when it's said and done you're gonna want me

The ransom for you, sugar, be priceless (WOOOO!!!)
'Cause you been getting at me in many a ways
Now tell your man to watch his back and duck from strays
'Cause I been in a rage (GIRL!!) lately (yeah)
Hoping God'll forgive me for all the sin, all the women
All the drama I been in and it's just the beginning (WOOOO!!!)
I hope you (watch) so you could see that nigga ain't built like me (like me)
Black Sheep of the family
But we one in the same, that's why we get along
Freak off and get it on
When we make love looking something like soft porn
Now tell me, baby, do you really wanna go home to him?
Where the brightest of days just look dim
And you fucking with a loser, baby, you can't win (HA, HA)

'Cause every little thing that we do (that we do)
Should be between me and you (me and you)
The freaky things that we do (that we do)
Let's keep between me and you, baby

Yo, now when I first met her all I thought was, ""Thong thong-thong""
Like, ""Lose the lame, we can get our freakin' on""
Baby know the game, slip away, and slide me yo' number
It's the last day of spring, see you first day this summer
I'm a bad motha, shut yo' mouth, pull the drop out and
Creep at a low speed, cause homie probably know me
I push the pedal, thoughts of your stileto
Way up in the air like I think he's here
Cause see, every time that I'm alone with you (with you)
Homey be checkin' up on you (on you)
But if that nigga only knew (only knew)
You've got a lot of freak in you, baby
Well now it's startin' to rain, I pop the roof and the champagne
How Jay said? ""Money Ain't a Thing""
It's been close a few, at times even impossible
But, it's been between me and you, baby

Beaches, houses, hoes, foes, friends
And when the, day ends, that's when it all begins
You wit him? Here's my room key, holla at me
While you thinka-think I'ma hit it up
Then look at the nigga you thinkin' you love? C'mon love
We could go there, me and you, creep off all night
If you love it, in the mornin', awake with new light
If you lookin' like I ain't gonna handle his
Let me handle my biz, it is what it is
Nigga livin' his life, and that's my bitch
You know I got a wife, let's keep this thing tight, baby

Don't let the word get out (shhh), baby
This is, strictly between me and you, baby
If they, knew we were doin' what we were doin' it'd probably ruin
Our creep away summer in Cancunin' and I, love
The way we get away, throw away a whole day
Turn off the pagers and phones, we in the zone like
""Fuck life, we live life

I may have struck a chord, wit the Christians
But y'all got the freakiest bitches out of all the religions
And God gave me his blessings to handle my business

If she some how misses, he gon' meet the mistress

Hey, you can tell somebody to go downstairs to the car and shit
Get that bottle of Voo out the back of the 'Bach for me, baby
I need to get right before I do this here
Uh-huh

Why me and you had to meet, talk, fuck and get caught up?
What we been through, it's enough to get any man caught up
I'm feeling you and I'm feeling we should both be free
If we were through, just imagine what life be without me

Mami, I put my best foot forward, though it's kinda awkward
'Cause I'm pigeon-toed and bow-legged
But you ain't too proud to beg
First time we got alone, you gave me some head
And been calling me ever since to do it again
When we met you was a seven, just creeping to ten
And now your my lucky quarter
The days get shorter, nights get longer
You know when the weather is cold feelings grow stronger
What a performer, the pussy feel like walking pneumonia
Got me sniffling and sneezing, coughing and aching and shit
And I'm starting to think I'm falling in love with this bitch
I'm having dreams about her jeans and how they fit
In that ErvingGeoffrey baby tee
She's wearing my name already, so you know she's fucking me
I'm a G like that, but for you I fell backwards
The only question I ask myself is— Shit

Why me and you had to meet, talk, fuck and get caught up?
What we been through, it's enough to get any man caught up
I'm feeling you and I'm feeling we should both be free
If we were through, just imagine what life be without me

Why me? Better yet why you and I?
Why I always pick the ones not in they right mind and crazy?
Singing ""Dangerously In Love""
This a dangerous broad I'm fuckin'
Like Al, it's the ""Scent of a Woman""
That got me playing hardball like Doc Gooden
Excuse my intruding, I don't mean to be rude
But our situation is kinda amusin'
'Cause we both like each other, but scared of each other
It's like we more than friends, but less than lovers
And my niggas can't tell us what we been doing is wrong
And your girls getting jealous 'cause we been getting along
Hold on, this is how it all begins
You call your friends, I'll call my friends, we'll all be friends
And hang out at the mansion in the Hamptons on weekends
Then it all ends, and the question is

Why me and you had to meet, talk, fuck and get caught up?
What we been through, it's enough to get any man caught up
I'm feeling you and I'm feeling we should both be free
If we were through, just imagine what life be without me

Have you even been touched like I touch ya?
Been held like I hold ya?
Been loved like I love ya?
Be real, be real
Have you ever been seen like I see you?
Been heard how I hear you?
Been felt how I feel you?
Be real, be real

Girl, you're my sunshine
But sometimes it gets a little cloudy don't it?
Them sunny days, I see the sunrise, and wish that it could hit ya
Face, it'd be great to get up every morning
To eggs and steak, but you can't relate
So we separated on good terms, no one's concerned
About who ya be fucking, and who ya fucked last
But when I see you, still the question I ask is

Why me and you had to meet, talk, fuck and get caught up?
What we been through, it's enough to get any man caught up
I'm feeling you and I'm feeling we should both be free
If we were through, just imagine what life be without me",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-caught-up-lyrics
It’s Murda,Venni Vetti Vecci,1999.0,"URRRRRRR, uh huh
Y'all motherfuckers is ready or WHAT?
IS Y'ALL MOTHERFUCKERS READY OR WHAT?
I don't think you are
I don't think so!

They got my back against the building
I'm the villain that's creeping around corners
Like shorty if you see them niggas creeping around, warn us
We might be coming through, gunning through, running through
So be careful what you do or the slugs might come to you
As long as I can remember, the streets have kept me safe
And ever since that time in December, the heat's been in my waist
I need an extra set of eyes so I keep my dog with me
Doctor says, ""Let them die,"" said his fucking dog bit me
I don't know what's wrong with me
But it seems like since you heard of us
Y'all niggas turning into murderers
Since you couldn't fuck with a third of us
But still against me and wanna see me in the box
Grilling me all crazy when you see me and The LOX
Leave you Red like Foxx
, 
ain't nothing funny about that
I see you in a coma, ain't coming up out that
You hold on for too long and they ain't pulling the plug for you
I'll run up in the joint myself and drop another slug on you
It's murda, it's murda

Motherfucker
I dip, squat, then post-up with the toast up
I bring beef to a closure, know something?
From Coxsackie to Folsom, I'm loathsome
I scream out fuck the world then I throw something
Niggas scheming hard, but fuck it, it's the God
I leave bullets lodged, leave you leaning on your broad
The odd pump leave you fucked up in your car
Slumped, Kennedy-style with your memory out
What the fuck y'all want?
Daddi-o with the calico
Let the gatty blow leave you bleeding on your patio
I leave rivals on their back, looking up at the sky blue
Not only do I leave you I hide you
I before you, X and Ja Rule
Death before dishonor, now and prior to
Boss man, fire you, expire you
Me die before you? You liar, you
Niggas is dead off the hits I approve
Shit, I got the Feds wearin' riot suits
Y'all niggas don't listen, whether streets or in prison
When we find 'em, we twist 'em, niggas waking up missing
Y'all don't understand we want y'all all to hate it
(It's murda) Murder Incorporated
(It's murda) In crime we all related
(It's murda) You niggas see if y'all can fade it

I'm a murderer, murdering anything that moves, seeing I, nigga
It's like do or die, nigga
Get caught up and fall victim to the worst shit
X, Jigga, and Ja as expected
Shine on the world and reflect it
Niggas don't respect it, so get it the worst way
Fuckin' with the wolves you get hunted like prey
Shot up in broad day, now everybody marchin'
I'm feeling like, ""Stupid, didn't the Inc. warn you the first time?""
(We murda) whenever you see blood
(It's murda) layin' it down for the love
That's us, we the life, put the knife through your windpipe
'Cause most of your niggas ain't cut right
You thinking it's alright, nigga, but it ain't
I'm paralyzing clowns up and down from the waist
Give a nigga some space or I'm taking it while making you bleed
And if I gotta take, the nigga taking more than he need
It's nothing but love between me, you, and these slugs
Hit him up wrap his body up in a area rug
Who holding the heat?
Who leaving niggas cold in the streets?
Y'all know me, ya co-D, Ja Rule the OG
Niggas better watch me closely, get a grip
It's Hennessy that fuels all that murdering shit
When I look in the mirror, my reflection is killer
Jigga, X, Ja, nigga, it's murda",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-its-murda-lyrics
So Much Pain,Pain Is Love,2001.0,"Rest in peace to my nigga Stretch, my nigga 'Pac
So much pain
Uhh.. yeah, huh, yeah
All my, niggas.. so much pain
Uhh.. huh, yeah
Yeah, so.. much..
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh

They'll never take me alive, I'm gettin high with my fo'-five
Cocked on these niggas time to die
Even as a lil' nigga, you could picture me hot gun in the rain
I shed the tear, cause this nigga here inherits the pain
And now I'm labeled as a thug nigga - you know the game
Smokin weed, fuckin hoes, slangin thangs, that's the life I live
Even if I tried to go back I'd get lost (come back)
And everything I seem to love I done lost
Fuck the world if they can't understand me
What else could I do? I had to feed my fuckin family
Yo' lies is my truth, so I'm a drug to your youth
And you don't want 'em nowhere near me, now that they can hear me
I spits razors, never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of tote-slangers and chalk lines
Why do we die at an early age?
Nigga so young, but still a victim of a twelve-gauge
Feel the rage this world has bestowed upon me
And I don't give a fuck cause they don't give a fuck 'bout me
So I keep - drinkin Hennessy, bustin at my enemies
Will I live to see twenty-three? There's so much pain

Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh
I'm tired of the strain and the pain (so much pain)
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh
I'm tired of the strain and the pain

Years and years of strugglin all my life
Runnin wild as a kid, grew up blazin 'em right
I'm in a - little cell I call my soul lately
It's been a - givin me hell and my heart is screamin, ""Don't enter""
I've been cursed, for what it's worth I feel dead
Spittin to you, I know I'm in way over my head
But Lord hear me, I believe in your ""7 Day Theory""
Three souls done sent this whole world teary (can you hear me?)
Too hot for you to stand near me
It's so much pain, and niggas wanna kill me
I'm tired of the stress and the strain
But my, grimiest grimeys got love for me
They're blazin, sendin shotguns up above for me
My face in, Hennessy with no chaser
Coke rises on every way in - keep us hustlin nigga
Me and my man got a plan to get this paper nigga
So if you owe nigga, look for the gauge to blow nigga
I figured I'd be considered a killer
Doin crime excited my mind and leadin the blind
I, can't express my compassion, my satisfaction
For gettin fucked up and blastin - we all been there
Taught from young to shoot, show no fear and lie
And wipe the tears from yo' mother's eyes - so much pain

Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh
I'm tired of the strain and the pain (so much pain)
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh
I'm tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh
I'm tired of the strain and the pain (so much pain)
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh
I'm tired of the strain and the pain

They'll never take me alive...
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh
I'm tired of the strain and the pain
They'll never take me alive...
Ooohhh, tired of the strain and the pain
They'll never take me alive...
I'm tired of the strain and the pain
They'll never take me alive...
Ooooooohhhhhh, nooooooooooooo
Cocked on these suckers, time to die

They got me mobbin like I'm - loc'd and ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin gloves on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckers if they test me
Trust, I got my Glock cocked, playa if they press me
Bust on motherfuckers with a - PASSION
Better duck cause I ain't lookin when I'm - BA-BLASTIN
I'm a nut and drinkin Hennessy
And gettin high on the lookout for my enemies
Don't wanna die, tell me why?
Cause the stress gettin major
A buck-fifty 'cross the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone
I keep my brain on the game and stay headstrong
These sorry bastards wanna kill me in my sleep
I'm real they can not see
And everyday is just a struggle, steady thuggin on the streets
And I be, ballin loc, don't let 'em make you worry
Keep swingin at these suckers 'til you buried
I was born to raise - hell, a nigga from the gutter, word to mother
I'm tough - I'm kickin dust up, ready to bust
I'm on the scene steady muggin mean; until they kill me
I'll be livin this life, I know you feel me

When I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together

I love my life, I love my wife
A bad time to prevail, it overwhelmed me
I'm livin' in hell but livin' wealthy
And know these hoes love me
Because I'm a star
I can't even cop a drink at the bar
Get me some bottles of that Remi Mar-tin
Let's get the party
Cracking right here fuck V.I.P
Knowing my baby loves me
Home with tears in her eyes
And when I get in, I hurt her more by tellin' her lies
She ain't surprised at me
She just surprised that we
Been together for this long
And I can be
The one to mistreat her
Thought it last forever
'Cause if I cry, you cry
We cry together

When I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together

From, what I recall we was little niggas
Cuttin' school gettin high wit da hottest bitches
Livin, life so free, that we ain't fearin
The, ills of the world, in heat of drug dealin
You and I then made a killin, and stuck together
In this land of forbidden treasure
Love is the only evil seed that could sever
A tie this close
Not the love between us but your love for the dough
You went O.T. started makin M-O-N-E-Why
All my good niggas gotta die
But shit could last forever, I wish death was pleasure
Cause when you died, I cried, we cried together

When I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together

Wash away your tears (my love)
You ain't gotta cry no more (my love)
I put it on everything that I love
And my pain it's my love

And I want, this world to smile for me
Don't shed a tear cause the nigga died happily
My momma warned me life was a motherfucker
But I ignored the warning and kept on hustlin'
And every night she just looked at me
Tears in her eyes and they be saying shit like
""I don't want me baby to die""
Brought so much pain to her life
Gotta make it better
'Cause when ma cried I cried
We cried together

When I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry

Ooh
You cry, then I cry
Then we cry
When he cries
I cry together, together
When I cry, then you cry
Then we'll cry, together
Baby, 'cause when
Ja cries, Mo cries
We'll cry, together
If he cry, I'll cry
Then we'll cry, together",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-i-cry-lyrics
Murder Reigns,The Last Temptation,2003.0,"Yeah...
I feel the rain comin' down on me niggas, heh...
When the sun gon' shine?
My Lord, somebody help us all, hehehe...

I think the rain is comin' back
I think the reign is comin' murder
(Hahahaha, Ja Rule, baby!)
I think the rain is comin' back
(Last Temptation, time to kill these niggas)
I think the reign is comin' murder
(Dear Lord, can you, feel my pain?)
I think the reign is...

If you can't, it's alright, 'cause I'ma live my life anyway
Just let, it, rain - on me
I feel, so free like a, cool breeze
And when the sun, gon', shine
Fold up the mini-blinds, load up the lucky 9
Hit 'em up from behind
That's, my, life - and it'll never be the same
Ever again, the game is to blame
Don't get caught up in your Range Rover, pullin' over
On the Westside highway shoulder, nigga I'll blow ya
Like a windshield, leave yo' mind on the windshield
And have yo' whip doin' windmills, that's what rain feels like
When it's hittin' a little harder than drizzle
And pickles flyin' out pistols, got niggas cryin' they Christians and
I can't believe shit has come to this
It's unheard of, now it's gonna reign down murder

I think the rain is comin' back (murder)
I think the reign is comin' murder
I think the rain is comin' back (murder)
I think the reign is comin' murder
I think the reign is...

Yo.. yo..
God only breathes with the best of them, bury the rest of them
A storm is comin', I got a hundred mile runnin' head start
On these niggas 'cause it's murder for life
Drugs, bitches, and money be my only vice
But I'm livin' life in the fast lane, doin' the damn thang
In the Ferrari hard top watchin' Hard Rain
It's a damn shame, no more games
No more love, baby boy I throw back slugs
Through your Green Bay throwback, I hits that up
And let you know where the reign is from
You ever heard of mixin' whiskey with Jamaican rum? You get Biggie
Mix gin with a little cocaine, you got me
And my style is a little too savage to not be
Be looked upon as one of the illest to MC
Y'all niggas want it with me? That shit's unheard of
'Cause niggas, now it's gonna reign down murder

I think the rain is comin' back (murder)
I think the reign is comin' murder
I think the rain is comin' back (murder)
I think the reign is comin' murder
I think the reign is...

Nobody loves me...
Sometimes I wish the good Lord would come down and hug me
I take a look at my life, it's gettin ugly
And now I know that you all wanna slug me
I can get above it, it's my life and I dug it
Even though I live it close to the edge
I'm gettin' closer to death, with eve-rrry little step
That I take, in the awake of my last days
I hope the sun shines with a light rain
That would mean the world shared my pain
And now the world could be happy again, smile
'Cause if I ever walk The Green Mile
You can look at me and blame it on my lifestyle
What can I say? I was raised as an only child, lonely
Poppa disowned me, so the streets raised me
To call me crazy is not unheard of
Now it's gonna reign down murder

I think the rain is comin' back (murder)
I think the reign is comin' murder
I think the rain is comin' back (murder)
I think the reign is comin' murder
I think the rain is comin' back (murder)

Love don't love me
Is the only thing that seems to hold me
God can you explain why

I sit alone in my four cornered room staring at candles
Gettin hot tryin to handle, this hand that's been dealt to me
I don't need, especially in this world overwhelmed with greed
See we cut from a different tree
Y'all niggas hope and I wish a nigga would fuck with INC
Went through the troubles and the struggle of hustlin and runnin (what)
So the ones that come behind don't' run through nothin
They would fear no man but God and do a lot of frontin
And I'm here to tell the world that pain is lovin'
Like when I die I hope it rains
Cuz if it does, that mean the lord shared them niggas pain
Here lie our man slain
And I would get out the game if I could
But I promised all my life to my kids I'd make good
Can't stand my father and love my momma
STILL I TRY, God can you explain why

Love don't love me
Is the only thing that seems to hold me

Love don't love me
Is the only thing that seems to hold me

I live my life under pistol, cuz lately love ain't been a issue
With who's gone miss you, when you dead and gone
Will my name live on?
Or will I be the last to die and breathe and eat
'Cause I need a little love and affection and baby
I live like every day was my last one
Dang, I've been living my life... (haha, yea)
Like I'm a leave this world unmarked, smiles combed to horror
For all them days when it rains
And it feels like thangs ain't gettin no better for me
Nobody loves me
Sometimes I wish God could come down and hug me
And wipe the tears from eyes
'Cause in my heart I know only the strong survive
And I die for my family, so they can live a better life
I try, God can you explain why

Love don't love me
Is the only thing that seems to hold me
God can you explain why
Love don't love me
Is the only thing that seems to hold me
God can you explain why

I'll sacrifice my life, fuck all the dumb shit
'Cause being black and broke's gettin redundant
My grow to be a world leader like X and King
If I can live a longer than Pac and BIG
What do river for us niggas run red, you could tell by the lives we live
If it changes it'll be God's prediction
So pain inflicted, like Jane's Addiction
Live right like Christians, but dance with the death
It's like callin' stones a devil, the road is unlevel
Still I walk through the valleys of shadows of death
Gasping for air, breathe in my last breath
My daughter told me first words, my son walked his first steps
And all through life we anticipate death
And if pain is truly love, for my family I DIE
God can you explain why

Love don't love me

Would I run down a road so dark, hoped to die, cross my heart
Never again
Never again
Will I look a nigga dead in his eyes and know he's dead wrong
And don't leave him dead where he lies, it's a fucked up world we live in
I'm tired of feelin the pain but ain't fightin the feelin
Niggas can you feel me?
Cause in this world I'm alone, and trapped inside this body that's out of control
I'm hittin these streets daily
Know when I got babies to feed rarely seein 'em rarely
This game inhaled me, and like Christ on the slate, nailed me
God, please don't fail me
But it's crazy to ask upon the Lord for help
When I got guns to bust and drugs to sell
I see you in hell, muthafuckas, I ain't bitter
Cause I know snakes and snitches get it where they slither
My niggas, doin life in the pen
This gotta be what y'all thinkin, shit
(Chorus)

Will I make you cry baby
You know I lie, you can see it in my eyes baby
But the truth is when a woman's fed up
There ain't a damn thing you can do about love
What about us?
Why must our lawyers discuss
Who gets the kids, who gets the cribs and how we should both live
When I love ya, when we apart all I do is think of ya
But you think I'm fuckin everything that's walkin
Either skirt or the thong
It don't matter, cause in your eyes I'm dog-fuckin 'em all
I got a woman that's gone and a passion for bitches
If you lose one the other becomes your religious
So what am I to do but get the wind behind me
Ground beneath me, make it hard for hoes to reach me
Cause the Rule ain't easy
Babe, unless you're freakin please believe
(Chorus)

Will I think these niggas friends and they foes
Cause in this rap game, you never know, just let it go
If my pain is love, my brain's on drugs
And may all my hoes thug on
And keep these punk niggas paralyzed, from the waist down
I got 'em face down is the equivalent of where I'm at now
Over the top of y'all niggas
Just a little quicker and smarter
Enhancin the game makin it harder
For niggas that freeze again like Braxton
I be hittin niggas with thrillers like Mike Jackson
I'm a problem
Number one with a bullet, I keep it up in my gun
It's hollow so when I pull it it numbs
Your whole body
Give it or take a few seconds
You'll probably, be the same nigga to dick ride me
Never again would I close my eyes
And walk through the dark backwards blind
(Chorus)

Never again

Daddy’s Little Baby,Venni Vetti Vecci,1999.0,"It's my heart
Pray
Who, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, mhm yeah, yeah

Daddy's little baby, must learn this world is shady
And the color of your skin don't make you less of a lady
Degrade yourself, never, 'cause I'm teaching you better
Life ain't all about cheddar, diamonds, and leather
Understand, you a black sister, in this white man's
World, don't let it get ya, down girl
It's essential that you grow amongst your group
So you don't grow too fast and be doin' Lord knows who
'Cause daddy loves you, don't let nobody tell you different
What I do for a living is a talent I'm given
And I'ma raise you too black, too strong, beautiful
Tell the truth, let you know what women go through
Lies and deceit, the nigga you love he gon' cheat
So be careful in the heat, baby girl with cold feet
Keep yo head steady, baby, this world ain't ready
Make me proud, you're daddy's little baby, ha, yeah

I'll always (Always), come back to you
I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
You're my baby, now and ever, who

Yo, Ja's imagery is somewhat like God and his chemistry
Blasphemy, I tell my baby girl proudly
Put her over my knee, and let her know this world is yours
Men are dogs, take it from daddy and hold yours
Head high lady, love is 'bout lies and deception
Will always be seen through the eyes
In my demise, don't cry just, hold on
Stay headstrong, and live to learn that life goes on
The day you was born, God answered my cry for help
I look at you a female replica of myself
I was conceived 2/29, you 9/22
God, what's the science in this sign you threw?
I wanna know, just so I can spread the jewel to my youth
So she don't have to come up like I did runnin' loots
Keep yo head steady, baby, this world ain't ready
Make me proud, you're daddy's little baby
For real

I'll always (Always), come back to you (You know)
I'll always come back to you
I'll always (Well, well, well), come back to you
You're my baby (Yeah), now and ever, woo
I know, I know

When I look in your eyes, I see stars
It's me and you against the world
Baby, it's in the signs
And anything you want you can get it, daddy's getting it done
You the reason why I keep the hundreds under the ones
And go through rain, sleet, and snow to kiss the sun
Though my travel, through the storm has just begun
Swear to God, when my sister died, I was only five
Didn't even cry, couldn't know the value of a life
Know I realize why Brittney's so rare to me
She came at the time when nobody cared for me
This world's tough, I'ma guide you through it carefully
Learn the game and remember nothing in life's free
My little lady, can't quite understand me now
But baby, in time I'll break it down
So keep yo head steady, baby, this world ain't ready
Make me proud, you're daddy's little baby
For real

I'll always come back to you (Oh, oh)
I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
You're my baby now and ever, woo
You know, I love you girl, oh yeah
And I'll always, be there for you girl
You know, you know baby
You're my baby, now and ever
And I'll always, oh, you know, you know, la-la-la-la, yeah
You're my baby, now and ever
And you know, you know, baby, know
You see I love you, girl
You're my little baby girl, yeah
You're my baby, now and ever
And I know, you know, you know
Oh you know, always, oh, always
You're my baby, now and ever, yeah know",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-daddys-little-baby-lyrics

But I never let the strength of this money control money
Niggas is somethin like pimps, the Rule is an O.G

Who ridin with me? Both of y'all bitches slide right in
Just me, you, and your friend - I'll be fuckin y'all 'til the mornin
C'mon, I love bitches with thongs on, that love to get it on

So please believe I'm gangsta I control these streets

Yo, nobody leaves nobody breathes until I enter the party
And ease up in a 550 Medina Ferrari
Pull in handicapped parkin, hop out with the lock in
And wink at the hoes while I walk in
Who's ridin and smokin tonight with players
And I ain't talkin bout them niggas with them Marvin gators
I'm talkin bout them niggas all up in fronts and gauges
And runnin up in spots and blazin, we call them gangsters, yo!

Fantasy, fantasy

I'm a rock star, Rick James, Mick Jagger
Bright lights, big stages, bad habits
Get high, go to prison, and evade taxes
This is not what I envisioned when I started rapping
Fuck the mansions, the phantoms, the suites, the cabanas
'Cause none of that matters when the mirror shatters

Is it a miracle, or is it madness?
Because when I puts it all together it reflects this
And this is me
About as close you gonna get to insanity, or genius

Is this my life, or am I dreaming

 like D-R-E
Never thought 'Shanti would ever stop repping the team
And how the the fuck is Lloyd hooking up with the enemies?

If you told me this is what it would be

They will never ever take may crown (let's get to the song)
Who Ja' Bless I say no man curse
Things gettin' better when they thought it would be worse
Here comes the officer askin for a search
They found no weapon, just only a draw first

I know y'all niggas is second guessin the state I'm in
Bitch, I'm in to makin' hit records that spin like rims
So when ""Flex"" get it, he bomb it once, shit bomb it twice
New York city park your cars, turn off your lights
And ""50"" your hazards, cause when Rule' spit to the masses

Hide the body like nuthin' happened

Or end up like one of the Jackson's beware of your actions

Had to put niggas in jail fo' life, ain't no blood in they eye
But who, Ja' bless 'em with tha sizzla touch
Thing's gettin better when they thought it would get worse

Race Against Time,Venni Vetti Vecci,1999.0,"In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life

God, why the hell am I here?
Is it a blessin', or a painful lesson of life and its directions?
Date of conception, two twenty-nine
I was birthed and won't be denied
Look into these eyes and witness lives tragedies
The boy who made slaves out of men, that's me
For every lock, there's a key
The only thing that ever made me click was cash money
So that I lust for
Be it one of my deadly sins
You know the seven, that I got all of them deep within
Sometimes I slip, but you be there to pick me up
Down I'm on my knees like what's up
Cause only in a world that's corruptin' the sick
Could you dare to look at my life and call it innocence
Got me to a better sense, cause what's yours is mines
Hear me, Lord, I'm runnin' out of time

In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life

Nobody cry for me, cause I
Wanna see you smile for me when I die
Look through my windows to the soul
Tell me if you see Ja livin' to grow old
Cause too many niggas done died for what I hold
The talented warmer world, which is so cold
Take me, save me, before I'm crazy
The only reason I live is for my baby
Never did you tell me that, life ain't a game
Maybe if you told me this, shit might be changed
But now, I'm just racin' against time tryin' to survive
And see why, y'all niggas drive over nigga's vibe
If you gonna live, know you gonna die
If you gonna steal, know you gotta lie
Get drunk and stay high
Don't de-nigga-ny
Cause they'll never take me alive
Feel me, Lord, I'm runnin' out of time

In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life

I fears no man, but when its time to go, I'm gone
Racin' through the darkness, learnin' what's right from wrong
Lookin' for the light, but all I see is the night
When everything else is bright
What happened to my life?
Is this what I am? Is this what I've become?
A nigga that don't give a fuck about nothin' and no one
Cold, even though I gotta burnin' desire
Within my soul I must set this whole world on fire
If I control my destiny, maybe one day
I'll give this world the best of me
You know I never been one to judge right or wrong
I embraced and showed you love
Then I throw slugs at the other side
Go get 'em in broad daylight
What a nigga would give to live my life
You don't want it, cause if you could get it you would try
Feel me, Lord, Ja has arrived

In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
In my race against time I can't stop

I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-race-against-time-lyrics
The Manual,R.U.L.E.,2004,"Yeah, yeah, yeah
You talk too much shit
You know niggas always talkin bout bitches ain't shit
Money over bitches
We give all our money to the bitches any fuckin way
(I love my bitch)
So I'ma send some love out
To the bitches, holla

Shit, here's somethin to remember
When we met that day in September
But, you've been gone since November
Had to finish out yo' last college semester
Her major - brokerage investor
She probably go broke tryin to invest her
Time and money in somethin that she call love
Cause, she love fuckin with thug niggas
That alwasy get high and had to be drug dealers
Eventually, she hooked up with some hood bitches
The hood bitches turned her on to strippin
Now the, gettin is good and it's well understood
That money on the wood can make things get harder
Be glad I'm not a pimp, if I was I'd charge ya
But for all that you go through, just thought I'd let you know
Hoes need love too, I'm fuckin witchu

Niggas need to read the man-u-al
To seperate your housewife from a hoe
Cause there's no rules to this shit here
Am I makin myself clear?
What she don't know won't hurt her y'all
So keep big pimpin on the low
Cause there's no rules to what I do
And I know, hoes need love too

You know what they say right?  Bitches ain't shit
And all men are dogs cause we just wanna fuck
Sundown to sun up, one up on a hoe
I might go down on the low, that's just me though
From L-A-X to Heathrow, I'm one of them niggas
That really doesn't need no, introduction
When I met her she was ""Girl, Interrupted""
Grew up became a woman not to be trusted
Frustrated and flustered, living amongst
These thieves hoes and hustlers, I'm diggin what's next
She had a studio apartment in the projects
With her and her girl from D.C. used to bus checks
And hold the coke, her niggas ain't sold yet
In hopes the copes don't know about all this
Shiiiiit, for all that you go through
Just wanna let you know, hoes need love too

Niggas need to read the man-u-al
To seperate your housewife from a hoe
Cause there's no rules to this shit here
Am I makin myself clear?
What she don't know won't hurt her y'all
So keep big pimpin on the low
Cause there's no rules to what I do
And I know, hoes need love too

Fake nails, fake breasts, fake eyes too
It's oh-four, and that's kinda what we used to
But you don't holla back like you used to, but I ain't mad at cha
I'm happy for a bitch, even if I can't have her
I remember when you was down in Atlanta
Workin gentlemen's clubs and you didn't even know what a gentlemen was
Forty to love and I wanna serve
That body like Serena's with less curves
But actions speak louder than words, and you gettin your money
Mami every month, 15th and 1st
Shit could be worse, you could be in the struggle
Or born with no ass and have nothin to hustle
Go on flex your muscle, cause that ain't the case is it?
Go on get your paper keep flossin on these bitches
Cause for all that you go through
Just thought I'd let you know, hoes need love too, I'm fuckin witchu

Niggas need to read the man-u-al
To seperate your housewife from a hoe
Cause there's no rules to this shit here
Am I makin myself clear?
What she don't know won't hurt her y'all
So keep big pimpin on the low
Cause there's no rules to what I do
And I know, hoes need love too
Niggas need to read the man-u-al
To seperate your housewife from a hoe
Cause there's no rules to this shit here
Am I makin myself clear?
What she don't know won't hurt her y'all
So keep big pimpin on the low
Cause there's no rules to what I do
And I know, hoes need love too

Pray 4 The Day,Pain Is Love 2,2012.0,"Pray for the day, your pain goes away
And for the time, wasted on goodbye
Can't get back the time, but you stay on my mind
Forgive me for the lies, and all the tears you've cried

So I pray, every night for a better day
It's like the world's Ike and I'm Annie Mae
But ain't no bitch here, though I shed so many tears for ya
Only cause a nigga care for ya
I'm talking 'bout the world over, wake me when it's all over
I don't know if it gets any colder, or any warmer
I'm weak, but I'm getting stronger
Forever young, but I'm getting older
Lend me your shoulder, but I don't wanna cry on it
But at times I feel a need to lie on it; closure
And some things will never change
I could be last, but still way ahead of the game
I do my bid to go hot like 'Pac like Wayne
Like Rick like Ray even mo'fuckin' James
I'm just sayin', love is pain
And all I ask of y'all is keep Rule in your prayers


Hope to see you when I get there
Mile high heavenly skies will be a breath of fresh air
G5, nobody on my plane cause it's private
On my way to St. Elsewhere
I swear, I know they say the good die young and
I guess that's why I'm so scared
But I refuse to die and I won't die
Until history records my greatness; Amen
I see angels, I see demons
I hear laughter, people screaming
Makes me wonder what's my reason for being here
And so I'm kneeling


Sing a prayer for me
But don't nobody shed a tear for me, I'm dying inside as it is if
Lonely is the way of the walk then
I'm practically lying in a coffin
How often do you tell someone you love 'em?
I bet not as often as you say you love summer
And it's gonna be the coldest winter ever while I'm locked up
See y'all in 18, one love and fuck fame",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-pray-4-the-day-lyrics

Bullets, they tear through
Got niggas wonderin' like,""What the fuck did I do?""
So niggas wanna go and get they man 'cause they can't do this shit
Because they got no heart for this, bust a gun and body shit
Niggas like you probably snitch, do a nigga then get rich
Niggas like you always fit, 6 feet deep inside a ditch
There ain't nothin' fuckin' with this, ya know why?

And ""Proof"" can bomb proof your hummer then
Put a vest on yourself and your chill-dren

Where I’m From,R.U.L.E.,2004.0,"Umm hey, comin from Where I'm From (I'm from) ohhh yea

Kids get killed in ghettos, shot up over their Carmelo's
While they mom was at home, tears hittin the pillow
Reverend in the middle of a sermon and funereal
Shed a tear cause they  lost a son the same way a year ago
It's the same egospiritual, we thuggin in harmony
They say death brings life, there exchange no robbery
If I'm wrong pardon me, me I'm just tired of poverty
Why them niggas in the hood never hit the lottery
Unless they go lottery, first round in the draft
First we dustin off the rounds and we slip in the mag'
Then we slip on the masks, and go out and mash
And we call it feeding our family
Ya'll call it a tragedy, Damn
How I could just kill a man
His blood flow like a river and rinse his blood off of my hand
If you hearing me speak please Lord give me a chance
Please forgive me of my sins, cause we cleansed where I'm from
 - 
Me and my niggas ride
Even when the sun don't shine and its cold outside
I never run in or hide, cause some niggas hate it
But I can't get faded cause I done made it
Instead of struggling or strive
Survive my weight how these ghetto streets of mine
This is coming from Where I'm From (I'm from)
We all walk back in line (yeah)

Now everybody know that everybody said nobody can hide from beef
Except but us, who surprised when these kids get killed on the streets
Look how these animals eat that's how they talk bout us
While they shed they joke and laugh puttin a choke round us
Can I get a moment of SILENCE
Cause they claimin it's the Murderers that's causing all the violence
What bout the ones that protect to serve our honor
Poppin the blue colla', with shots soon to follow
The ghettos in horror, cause in this boy shot went back
And now the neighborhood hot and he can't move the crack
When it's all about the dollars
And he'll individually get murdered cause money is power
But then these snitch's get to talking and it's colder than ours
Cuffed and crimed on the bus heading straight to the Island
He was only 13, but tried as an adult in the highest of courts
Cause ain't no more children in the ghetto where I'm from


We ain't all killers in prison
Matter fact that's a stereo typical thought of livin
Cause they don't know about the hood and them love in it
Summer time top down with the wood finish
Pushin hard uptown windows slightly tinted
Back to back Benz and jeeps, blowin weed with my niggas
On our way to a house party, gonna fuck with some bitchs
Let's get some liquor for shorty who said she make us some chicken
And if we get 'em drunk enough we probably could freak em, and do it every
Other weekend
If I don't have to kill niggas, I never would leave the ghetto
I'm like an angel that put on a halo, cradle the grave of my niggas that we
Lost in the ghetto
Cause where I'm from in the ghetto we rock white tee's and nike's
Roll 3 dice and name our dope ice cream
Set trends and ya'll follow our lead
But in New Yitti niggas follow they dreams, where I'm from

Now I lay me down and sleep
And I pray to the Lord, for my soul to keep

"Love Me, Hate Me",Rule 3:36,2000.0,"Do you love me? Do you hate me?
Do you love me? Do you hate me?
Do you love me? Do you hate me?
Yeah, yeah

This world loves me, this world loves me not
I'm torn between the best of both 'cause I'm hot
In this game so brittely, literaly
I got niggas wanna riddle me, get rid of me
R-U-L-E, need I say more?
World, hope y'all prepared for the chaos
'Cause y'all want the beast in me, so I'ma give it
Paint pictures vivid, live high as a spirit
Y'all can all jump in it
That's what you might as well do
If you gonna live life timid
And I ain't never been intiminated
Believe me, and I don't wanna fuckin breath easy
I wanna make it hard for these niggas
So when they can't stand me
I'ma make it so these niggas can't feed they family
Now do you love me, or do you hate me?
C'mon and get me, I keep it off safety

Do you love me? Do you hate me?
Ready or not, here I come
Do you love me? Do you hate me?
Ready or not, here I come

There's nothin' but love spread between me and my niggas
We bust guns together and fuck so many bitches
But I know that Hell is callin
In the name of the lord just let a nigga in
'Cause I ain't done nothin' wrong, but love thy self
And harm other niggas that wanna stop my health
Is that failure?
'Cause love'll never be hand over hand
It's man versus man
It's Murda
If I'm gonna be hated or to be loved
I prefer ta live wild and die from slugs
What you want from me?
Lord I'm only a human
Tho I bear your name, I'm a devil in chains
Release me, 'cause Lord only knows it ain't easy
When I'm scarred for life, I know that he sees me
Now do you love me nigga
Or do you hate me nigga
C'mon and get me
I'm waiting nigga

Do you love me? Do you hate me?
Ready or not, here I come
Do you love me? Do you hate me?
Ready or not, here I come

Y'all just wanna watch me rise, then watch me fall
Before it's all done I'ma die from it all
I might OD in a club off drugs like River Phoenix
Or get shot down like BIG and Pac for my genius
I know this worlds seen it before, and here I come
I know y'all fiendin' for more, and I'm not done
As long as I can run through current like state times
Keep up a sane mind, and hand on my iron, I'ma blast off mine
Look in the eyes of a nigga who seldomly cries
I got a beautiful wife and kids, why me?
Got cash, jewels, cars, and cribs, why me?
If this good livin' Lord, why me?
When I live so dirty yet I'm worthy to be
Number one, the world's only begotten son
Here I come

Do you love me? Do you hate me?
Ready or not, here I come
Do you love me? Do you hate me?
Ready or not, here I come
Do you love me? Do you hate me?
Ready or not, here I come
Do you love me? Do you hate me?
Ready or not, here I come

Do you love me?
Do you hate me?
Do you love me?
Do you hate me?

Intro (Fuck Fame),Pain Is Love 2,2012.0,"Previously on Pain is love...
Here we go again baby. Erase the pain
Got to break free from all this mother fucking anxiety, strains on my life
Open my eyes and see it's a big world out there
If god could only
Shine his light on me
I'm crying everyone's tears. My pain is my love
I'm crying everyone's tears
And now, PIL 2...

And the world was so cold, I couldn't recognize myself
And the world was so cold, I couldn't recognize myself
So I took a little pill, and it changed my whole world
It changed my point of view, so I had to take two

Fuck fame...
Picasso, Rembrandt, Basquiat
Warhol couldn't paint a better work of art
And I'm like a child in art class
Cause I'm trying to brainwash every canvas
You all kiss my ass, the elephant's in the room painted retro
Here's to Van Gogh, but yall don't hear me though
I'm what you never saw, something you never seen
You mother fuckers can't see me; Banksy

My dick just like bitches, hate on, you fuck niggas
Picture me rollin', the feds all in my business

Cause I’m ridin around and I'm getting it
See murder, ain’t no limits
What I started out, I’m gonna finish
Choppers out, the windows tinted
All y'all can be witness, cause we ain’t leaving no witness
All my niggas … niggas don’t get it!
Lay down motherfuckers, this is business!
Take your personal prescription
Motherfucker, I see demons!
Cause I got the devil in me, and my evil is my genius
And those girls catching us …
Nigga sit tight in that prison!
You gonna have to come get me
And to get me means to kill me
If you kill me, niggas witness dying with me
Feel me?
Fuck the feds and whoever is listening
I know ya niggas watching
But as long as I’m alive, who gon' stop me?
A nigga , give a fuck if niggas like it
But I guarantee you never met another nigga like me
Not likely, I’m savage, you niggas bitch big loudly
And girls, I eat pussy, pussy niggas stay for around me
Cause nigga, I’m...


Cause I’m rocking out your bitches
And your bitches talk real…
Telling me about her niggas real sexy
And I need the fuck more protected
When the cops stripping butt naked
Gimmie anything …
So, when I’m leaving nigga like breakfast
Ratchet nigga don’t want…
Unless is something I die for myself, cut the…
Afraid to get large in…
We’re talking about that money, money
Nigga wore them out
That money make them turn and pin it over… talking about
Speak in tones, bitch!
Fuck with me, you know I got it, got it
Pop that, pop that, fuck with me, you know I’m about it, about it
Pop that, pop that, pop that ass, bitch
You gonna get this work, let me see you twerking like Miley
Need a bad girl like RiRi that’s going off that molly
But I don't pop that Molly, and I don’t rock that forward
I’m… in a Bugatti, I’m just trying to avoid the law
Nigga, ain’t trying to get locked up no more
I might stop real rapping
Nigga, keep low with that hard…

If you feelin me (say yeah-yea)
Flip the bird where (in the aiiir)
Fuck the world (we don't caaare)

It's time to ride out
Niggas stash your cash at the hideout
The Murderous I-N-C's en route
(Y'all hear me) feelin my shit the same
(Y'all fear me) in every difinitive way
(I'm really) the nigga that you need to get with
Cuz y'all pop shit nigga, I pop clips nigga
Hot, but not the black four-dot-six nigga
You know the Rule, thug heart nigga
And I don't need no fake friends, broke ties, loose ends
There they go niggas is at it again
Tryin to befriend the nigga that they claim they love, but hate so much
And really all we got is us
But fuck it, it's the same way they fucked me
Now I'm fuckin your broad in the back of a Humvee, go figure
I'll have your niggas pourin out liqour
All because you fuckin with the Rule nigga


Take my life, take my mind
Take my heart, take my soul
Take my cash, take it all
But save me
I'm throwing my life away

Why, would a nigga with so much talent
Want to throw it all away to drugs and violence
I know not the answers but I ask the questions
Do all Muslims really study their leasons?
And how many Christians lie during confessions?
I know I did when I was just a kid
Never told about the guns my uncle hid
Under my bed, and at night I played with them
Kind of grew up to be sort of a loose cannon
Before my sins, I'm asking you to let me in
Lord help me, I been through all the pain
Now I wanna know who loves me


Changes, changes
My mind is going through
Changes, changes
My body's going through
Changes, changes
My life is going through
Changes, changes

Yo, looky here
I just wanna fuck all day, live my life
Get high all day, my life
Maybe one day, I'll live right

Passion,R.U.L.E.,2004,"I know ya'll love me
Let's go

Nobody loves me
Sometimes the world can seem so cold
Looking through the windows of my soul
I see the truth and now I know (I know, I know, I know)
Y'all gotta love me
When the weight of the world was on my shoulders
You were there
When it got heavy, I held it
You were there
The ones that stood by me like soldiers
You were there
I know you love me

But I'm still waiting for the Lord to come hug me
Send a sign or somethin'
Is it all for nothin'?
The talent and passion of mine
I'm sick of sufferin'
I know your plans is greater than mine
So I'm asking
Why do you want me dead or alive?
And how could you let the people see me through the enemy's eyes?
Like, jealousy, envy, Feds wanna convict Gotti
I'm thinking probably we was gettin' too much money
Too many niggas in whips sittin' on 20's
Too much connections to the streets, Y'all niggas doin' somethin'
And after overall assumptions, so it's all or nothin'
Ain't nothin' stopping the second coming, except the coffin
I may be incased, but even from there I still touch 'em
Niggas ain't promised tomorrow, that's why we still hustle
For all my niggas that can't be here
For every tear, say me a prayer, I swear


But what's love, when your friends become enemies
Your nightmares are no longer your worst dreams
And as bad as everything seems
Keep hustling
We gon' get it by any means
How unfortunate, January the sixth
Federal officers, raided our offices
Making it hard for us to eat, and breathe, and live
And they swear they got niggas that's informin' them
They've been handin' down indictments for about a year
And they send nobody to jail yet, we still in the clear
And the Bible that said, ""Thou shall not fear no man, but God""
Whoever said that, ain't never faced the law
And why all these Feds probin' going on
I'm fighting niggas, swingin' back against the wall
That's for my niggas that can't be here
For every tear, send me a prayer, I swear


How could you hate me, why would the Lord forsake me
Put the weight of the world on my shoulders
I thinkin' I could brush it off and nobody notice
Keep raisin' my kids: Britney, Jeffry, and Jordan
Keep coppin' new whips: Bentleys, Benzes, and Porshes
My niggas, and my fans is the only thing of importance
It's crazy how the world turns
Sometimes, you gotta light up and let it burn
Sweep up your ashes, put 'em up in a urn
On a mantle from memories
I hear you callin' me, Lord knows you love me
The Passion of Rule is so real, just lend me your ear
You'll feel what I feel, you'll tear when I tear
The vision's real clear, just look in my eyes
I believe in putting my life in the hands of God
For all my niggas that can't be here
For every tear, send me a prayer, I swear


You know..... I give love to all my niggas

And whenever I ball, bitch, I'm an all-star

I'm on my stairway to Heaven, dear heavenly Father
God had on no Gucci, guessing cause Devil wears Prada
You know ? don't let my bitch get money
I know you want get it, still you can't take nothing from me
A nigga living comfy, hoes imported from London
Half white, half good loving, ? packages shipped to the Runners
? he be straight from Cuba, life is a mo'fucker
Until you finally fuck her, found out you shouldn'ta trust her
The lifestyle of a hustler, blow money fast, fuck 'em
Throw it up in the air, make it all back before sun up
Every bitch is a come up, no matter who you are

I seem them flashing lights, but really what's the motive?
Been motivated all my life, couldn't wait for this moment
Big house out by the water, maybach came with the chauffeur
Now I said ? like twelve summers
We straight from the Bahamas, got me spending like ?
These boys ? go somewhere where we got options
But once I get there, I start to notice my biggest problem
How am I so alone when I'm so surrounded?

Still on my stairway to Heaven, dear heavenly Father

Fame monster, no relation to Gaga
Bitch got a lot of problems, money ain't one of 'em, promise
Graduated with honors, she don't drink, she don't light up
We're heavy on that powder, now every night is young
Red murcileago, who the fuck gon' stop her?
She's been racing towards an early grave, and guess who's the driver (Fame)
She thought she'd live forever
Like so many stars whose souls we captured on cameras
I need my privacy, sanity matter of factly

To raise, in this deadly era of AIDS
Just yesterday we were slaves, and good friends
Now that we got ends that don't meet niggas we will meet again
I wanna know why, the shit gets said
The shit gets wrote, the shit gets read, motherfuckers get fed
I shed a tear for my rider, cause thugs cry
And the truth'll shatter niggas pride like cold lies
Can I live? Dog, why you wanna stop the Rule from risin?
And I G for me, surprise and growl
At the young that you called a liar
Now I'm the king of this jungle, no more denyin
Talk to the iron if you wanna holla, I'll pop at you
Probably, piercin your bone when you poppin your collar
Cause this is, pain over love, my style's brain on drugs

Standin next to I-N-C, niggas

Sellin more records than dope, these days apparently

Niggas! Grip the iron and keep it cocked
Bitches! Work your clit keep that pussy hot
Cause it's all about the benjamins and nobody ain't doin it like us

Niggas! Grip the iron and keep it cocked
Bitches! Work your clit keep that pussy hot
Cause it's all about sex, money, and murder
Bitches that burn ya, niggas with burners
Cocked and let go!

Fuck all y'all motherfuckin bitch ass niggas
I'm talkin to whoever wanna be ridin my dick
And you know your gon' get it as hot as I spit it
It's the Rule and nobody wanna be bothered with
If I hit 'em in every direction with four fifths
Will expend like 45's with compact discs (c'mon)
It's a disappointment to see niggas flip on Rule like they double jointed
When I'm one of rap's anointed
Who else used to order it all on the dick
Like when I come through with spinners on the six
And got bitches bouncin like Ronnie in Tricks
But some whores in this game really don't make sense
Bomb roof and vehicles and clonin Ems
But when bullets go through your film, we break your limbs
A horror show, yeah picture this
Cause I guess you can't see it, it's Murder again


Rule I fuck with bitches in Manolos and thick Louie Vuitton logos
Cause I don't love these hoes
I'm above and beyond everything that your seein
And I'm the only real nigga left rappin this freakin
If I could be one of the seasons, you'd call me summer
The way I bang the heater out the back of the Hummer
The bull just move like runners from city block to city block
Layin down the foundation for what's really hot
Y'all niggas really not on my level (c'mon)
I'm like slugs when they pierce the metal, you see sparks (what)
My voice is a brush, they hear it it's like art
And nobody can really tell the twins apart
I call one Nina, other one Santa Maria
I might roll up on your set, dump and lean ya
My bitch is cocked to bang men in Virginia
Don't make me run up on ya, put a few in ya


Yeah, yeah, yo, Murder's outlaw, that guess I get a city's a broads
So I push the Porsche high and truck to court
Holla at the judge if the judge made a bad decision
I feel like the nigga that triggerin guns with mittens
It's hard to get done, I'm hearin that security runs
Around 30K, if they don't get hit with an AK
And found out that the security's runnin another way
Like with me, it's Murder, probably
If I could drop in to manslaughter get a bail and flee
Cause my downess says bitch up, let her handle the pick up
Snow cone the country leave no market untouched
Call me drugs if this is how they pushin us rafters
But I don't do it cause I need it, I do it cause I want more
Definition is greed, I do it cause I want yours
And y'all niggas is teasin, y'all don't really want war
But if you really do, your gonna need a lot more

You know they say everything we hear is an opinion, not fact
And everything we see is perspective, not truth
The fewer the facts, the stronger the opinions
And opinion is the medium between knowledge and ignorance, bitch

I’m hoping that Heaven got a ghetto
So when I get there I can tell you to kiss my ass whole hearted
I'm back where I started
I'm a prisoner of my own success, but hardly
Caring enough to know that I’m dead without it
No cribs, no cars, no champagne
No bright lights, no bitches, no big stage
But fuck it, I'm in a better place
And I'm talking in third person in case you couldn't relate
Diary of a monster, sometimes my mind fades
To a place not even I can explain
'Cause there's a thin line between genius and insane
Guess which one I am, I think it’s obvious that

They spun a web, for me
Like a spider, they spun a web, for me
And they spun a web, for me
Like a spider, they spun a web, for me

And I say that to say this, man, if life is a bitch
I’m gon' fuck her then tell her that I love her
Not beneath her or above her, but inside, no rubber
That's my interpretation of motherfucker
No lie, no truth my life is a little bit of both
Who’s who? Who knows anymore?
My choice is to get it in real moist so I can come hard
And the world is ours, better yet, bitch, mines
Shot at the moon just to be among stars
Then God alienated it and ended up on Mars
Serenity understand it, extraterrestrial, that I is
Think I do it all because, it’s obvious

They spun a web, for me
Like a spider, they spun a web, for me
And they spun a web, for me
Like a spider, they spun a web, for me

Lately, I’m seeing my whole life ahead of me
And I’m feeling like this life can never be (nah)
'Cause a nigga on a whole 'nother pedigree (from ya)
I’m so far from home it feels like a million miles
And I’m long gone and ain’t no coming back
But really I never left
I’ve been silent yet at my the best
Y’all haters spread hatred like yawning
And I still find ways to make crochet hearts
Like Kanye my 808′s is a heartbreaker's
Maybe me singing to your hearts a mistake
Nah, Maybe I’m just before my time
Or maybe it’s just that obvious

They spun a web, for me
Like a spider, they spun a web, for me
And they spun a web, for me
Like a spider, they spun a web, for me",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-spun-a-web-lyrics

Holla back, you bitch ass niggas

Yo, cock sucka', I get squat and post and cocked tha nina'

Take crazy for genius, hated like Jesus Christ
My weakness have always been bad bitches
And new bills with krisis', my thesis more than extraordinary
And that nigga that got shot nine times can tell ya that I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, Nicolas Cage may I ask yo' permission to take his life
This is a man be ""I"" N-C to R-U-L-E extraordinary, one for the ages
When then sawed off with the front of them gauges
To engage in combat
To send you and 'fem' where yo moms at
Motherfucka you hear that
And I ain't talkin about them heaven from skies
I'm talkin' about them fire from nines

Yo, I'm small lil' homies, frail but bold
Went from base to some bullshit like ""Jalen Rose""
Got my blind D-O-G's readin' brail and coats
Keep tha heat in tha winter I can't tell it's cold
Clean my set, pieced out flame the TEC
Throw shots out niggas catch like ""Wayne Cherbet""
Son of a gangsta, Talk dirty son I'm a bang ya
I'm tha truth with tha ox, keep gum on tha banger
Hussein, the only reason hoes chase tha thugs
Nigga blade part two I got tha taste for blood
Log on Fatal.com, see fatal drop bombs
More militant minded then y'all faded with 'Pac rhymes
Clucthing tha stick beam, suckin' tha stick green
Out tha window or tha sunroof, buckin' tha sixteen
You ain't a gangsta 'Em', this is gangsta shit
And ""50"" you ain't nuthin' but a gangsta bitch
""Pac'"" would have never did no song with no 
wanksta snitch
He confusin' ya'll he ain't tha shit

Nobodys livin life the way that I live it
Nobodys spittin and doin it, I spit it
But who fuckin admitted
I'm one of the bigger biggest of niggas that done did it
Been hated and delt wit it, when agents tap in my lyrics
So by the time that they hear it, the crime's already committed
Natural Born Killa, but that I'm already and then
Murdah was the case, but I-N-C's been aquitted
The Agency's gettin livid, They wanted us to be finished
But we got unfinished business, Sned God as my witness
This is another testimony to my life and my story
Askin you hoes, Why should I talk when I got guns to speak for me
Dont come at me homie, Especially tryin to act like you know me
Only if you can control me, Know where you been choosen befor me
To sit in ya grave, homie dig it, I'm hearin its lonely, But see
Nobody...Does it...Like Me! And they know it they can't spit it the same
But still they try, cuz thats part of the game, WHUTS MY NAME?!


These niggas incredible, throughout the ghettos of America
People, see these window I see through
Off they mirror they evil, jealous bullshit that men do
Had I known it was you, there'd be no clue on who done killed you
Like when Kane murdahd Able, Niggas must have been able
To put caine through they nasals, They so high they see angels
I see life from all angels, tangled, webs and weaves
Now niggas is able to kill like Kane all over the streets
100 degrees Ferenheite, hot as the hottest summer night
Heatin up desperatly in the need of some ice, I'm nice
Nobodys quite like, flow like rare blood types
I be wrong if I'm right, right if I'm wrong, I was the RULE born
When my legacy is left through my boys maiden name live on RULE
Niggas is foolish tryin to do whut I do, Cuz see
Nobody...Does it...Like me! And they know it they can't do it the same
But still they try, cuz thats part of the game WHUT MY NAME?!",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-rule-lyrics
Drown,Pain Is Love 2,2012.0,"Please don’t let me drown drown drown (I’m so cold)
Please don’t let me drown drown drown (Don’t let me drown)
Please don’t let me drown drown drown (I’m so cold)
Please don’t let me
Please don’t let me

Although I done gon astray
Into the darker days
Please don’t let me drown
All life must fade away
No mercy on judgment day
Please don’t let me drown

Drown drown drown
Lord let me, stay above water like the French quarter
I’m so walker
Now, I’m overlooking the ocean
From the deck of the yacht, and the view’s gorgeous
I'm the only shark in the waters, huh
But there's a few whales among us, nigga
That wanna bite like piranhas
I overflow, Leo DiCaprio
I’m Titanic, bigger than life, the aura
This ship sink, nigga, I’m gon' walk on water
Gigantic, but Jesus I’ma depressing attic
How do I manage? To be above average and not arrogant
To be the one to dive in knowing I can’t swim
For me to go under not breathing
I’m drowning


Pray for me, cause I tested positive
For being the shit, now niggas won’t touch me
And I’m allergic to broke niggas, trust me
And that pimping been in my blood since a youngin
So I’m thinking there ain’t a cure for my illness
And the diagnosis is just something I can live with
Cause I done made it rain on bitches
Storm on niggas, cash flow like rivers
As if it wasn’t enough for me
To be in the deepest of waters, to feel like I’m snorkeling
Off shore and this is so reassuring
That I’m still sick, in need of a donor
Cause I’m heartless, so I dive in
No life vest, knowing I can’t swim
So if I go under and I’m breathing
Am I drowning?


This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
 (pray for me)
I told her cry me a river, little mama, don’t give up
Daddy’s here to deliver, the world is cold
So them tears you can tie them up
Just go on and let ‘em running down your face
Baby the world is yours
I told her if she shared it with me, then it’d be ours
Like? how could we ever drown?
Underwater I can’t hear a sound but I
See the rain dropping they're like tears from God
And my mind is telling me that it’s a sign but why
When I don’t think the Lord is too fond of I
But there’s gotta be a reason
I’m not drowning, right?",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-drown-lyrics
Suicide Freestyle,Venni Vetti Vecci,1999.0,"Um, say all that I want to do
Is to live my life
Um, but every time I turn around
Another nigga dies
Niggas catchin' five to ten years
And it just ain't no use

Uhh, uhh, ever heard of a nigga dying twice
My love is just to live my life
'Til the Lord decides to out my lights
Oh I know why niggas ain't prepared to die with me
But we all got to die one day
Even though the life has captured me
Money, drugs and prisons, menages with women
Forgive me God for living
For I have sinned
Now everybody wanna cage me in
Don't make no difference 'cause I'm still here
Breathing, can I get a witness?
My life is misleading, hey
Hey, 'cause anybody wanna fuck with me
Come on just grab your head my niggas
Don't ever doubt your niggas
What's life without my niggas?
Talk to my niggas heart to heart
We all live from hustlin' to ballin'
It's crime we fall in
Feds keep a lens peakin' through the Venetians
But secret indictments
Y'all niggas is reachin'
C'mon I'm in the business to break niggas
And anybody that want it get it hot from the INC. niggas
Ja Rule ready to kill niggas
Bury 'em all
Lookin' to lay them down big to small
Got the world in awe 'cause I'm spittin' the raw
Never seen, never heard before but truly yours
I'ma max out on niggas doin' 2 to 4's
Bang a nigga in the yard then get rid of the board
Just because a nigga don't give a fuck get weeded and Henny'd up

Wanna do it in the high heels
On top of a high hill
Cause my nigga ain't tryin' to run up then I will
Hit it from behind that's how I polly wit mines
Man we up all night fuckin by the Hollywood sign
Yea got smacked up
Every time she backed up
Didn't know there was room in the back
Of the lack truck

Backstage panties down eat dick

Lost little girl
I seen how love can turn to lust inside a
Lost little girl
I seen how pain can turn to trust within a
Lost little girl
She can get a man to do anything but she's a
Lost little girl
This sexy thing is only 17 and she's a
Lost little girl

I admit I get a lot of love from women
It's only cause if I put that thug lovin in them
It's hard as a mitten
Gotta hit the club and bang out
Song after song till I end up in the wrong route
Tank top, sweat it out
Where she's shakin that ass shakin that ass
And got her breast pressed to the glass
Strobe lights flashin
That X is kickin in
And I'm orderin the chrissy open bottles of tin
On our stairway to heaven baby bring a friend
Putaya sayin, fuck in a stretch benz
You know me I like it wet, rode slowly
By the way baby, how old is you codie
You lookin a little young to me
And how many you had that girl on, two or three
It's a damn shame
But she coulda had the world
And now she's nothing more than a

Pop was abusin one of gods children

And she's feelin like her worth is between her legs
She start fucking niggas and learn to show'em respect
They a father figure she honor love and protect
To your down ass bitch
One you could cuddle up and wile out with
We call it thug love
Hot sex and hard drugs was a thing of the past
But look here murder inc nigga bringin it back
We got them stressed strung out beatin to be hung out
Cry in their crib backs when they say why
Would I get involved with niggas
Involved with killaz
Involved with dealers
Involved with niggas that make millions
She coulda had it all Including the world
Now she's nothing more than a

(Verse 3: Ja Rule)
She's in danger now, she ain't livin her life right
She got a man but her mans livin his own life
With his wife and kids his crib and Bonnevilles
The benz that only spins on them chromey wheels
What has he done for you lately
Only remind you of when them times a little bit rider
A dick and hes crazy and will reminds us
And then he hit you with that one last promise
You want it to be the truth so bad
You lookin in his eye and your cryin, sayin he ain't lyin
But you know he is
But you're a glutton for punishment
And you know pain is love
So whats wrong with sufferin
The hard times have past, the good times are comin (cumin)
All over your chest baby thats how your lovin it
And its sad cause you coulda had the world
Now your nothin but a

It's a physical, I'ma fuck, you tonight thing
Fuck, knowing your name, get your ass in the Range
And rollover, gettin' blown while blowing the doja
Bring head to a closure
That's a good bitch
Before it's all over, I'ma leave this bitch
Probably treat this bitch, smoke better
'Cause if you ain't know, gangstas and hoes go together
Poppin' my collar, partna
Who in the spot?
Baby, Rule in the spot
In the mug and the watch, love me
Half the hoes hate me, half them love me
The ones that hate me only hate me 'cause they ain't fucked me
And they say I'm lucky
Do you think I've got time to fuck all these hoes?
And do all these shows?
Or flight in the lama, Dodge and White Rolls
Uh-oh, another episode
What, do I do?
To all my niggas that be livin' it up, we say

To all my bitches that be givin' it up, uhh

Bitches, just wanna hold the name exactly
That's why they suck dick with more passion than apples
And I ain't mad at'cha
Never leave you alone
'Cause we fucks when I'm home
Phone sex when I'm gone
We both grown, both got minds of our own
Bust our freaks off like old dog and Love Jones
Been, in many zones, baby
One hoe, two hoes
Fuck prizzy bitches, the hoes that do bono
But you know, the Rule be livin' it up
And got all these hoes, givin' it up
I like a little Rule baby, how cute are you?
With a body that rides all sexual
I got a stick, I'll ride right next to you
Do a doughnut, and cut, and I'll open it up
On the freeway, dick in her mouth, foot on the clutch
Rule bitch, not givin' a fuck
What, do I do?

'Caue ain't nuthin' but an ""E"" thang baby
I know that pussy wet like crazy
I wanna feel your passion, come when you ask me
Laugh when you cry, cry when you laughin'
But ain't nothin' happenin'
The bitch got a little too high
Picked up my ride and started crackin'
The radio blastin' +Between Me And You+
But you ain't on the low with that freak shit you do
I thought you knew (What I do)
Know I know (What you do)
'Cause it's been a good night, your head ain't right
Like Teddy P, let's +Turn Off The Light+'

Word to Nicolas Cage,

Haha, life is good . . . a yo
It's a reality that . . . all the real niggas
Have to smash on the bitch niggas
And you know I like to call this The Wrap, hehe, yeah, uh, yeah
(Verse)
It's a Wrap and any men that don't wanna get clapped
Better not violate the camp, get shot down by chance
I'm real advanced with that cock and blast
Cause the feds won't look back, for cleaning cash
What cashes we cleansing, it's all about the Benjamins, what
If it's dirty then we rincing it off
You niggas don't give a fuck, mobbed up in H2s
Niggas is tlaking shit, aw bitch, that's old news
They say I rap to rhythm and blues
But when I turn on the radio, I hear y'all niggas rappin' it too
He's like ""Baby can you give it to me""
Nah, I'mma give it to you
The same way that we gave it to Proof
The same way that we gave it to 
Loose
Put that bang, bang, bang to use nigga
Cause Rule's the truth nigga, for show
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-uh-uh-oh
Hit 'em in retro, throwback like West 'Paul
Niggas wanna ball, but can't on the West Coast
Dre Day's been dead a long time ago
Respect the Inc/Row/Rap-A-Lot collabo
Just know that you nigga ain't save on the globe
And while the world probes, IRS versus I.N.C
I'm still wishing y'all the R.I.P
Can I Live, for I D.I.E
I'm talkin', M.I.B, murder inc bosses
Count your losses

Now before they start runnin' they lips
I thought I should warn these motherfuckers, there's a gun in this bitch
And I know he's got one on his hip
But I got the drop, and outside, Rule got the Drops
All it takes is a cock and a pop
Money for bail, ain't seeing no more sales
Instead, I'm poppin' on Yahts
They told me J.Prince runnin' the south
And I'm beast from the east, that'll come and put a gun in your mouth
I got bricks for days, dicks to make a bitch behave
Had to baldhead my shit threw, had to switch the waves
Just that quick, slip and the mac spit, bladdat
Four up in they chest and reload while they back flip
We in this together, bad weather, rippin' the storm
They some dictionary rappers, they just spittin' the norm
You supposed to know the La Costra Nostra flow
I did it, cause I lived it, you can quote the flow
Hit your six up with sixteen in sixty seconds
Get your whips up, we split beams, keep fifty weapons
To you coppers that's posin' a threat
Fire up the air, wholes in the tec
To put a hole in your neck
See I rep for the four forty but I'm about the five
Ride by, blazin' out the five, nigga I'm so cool
Bitches say, Hizzy, you remind me of the old school
In the club posted, snatching hoes with no jewels
Nigga

You know
As the world turns, these bitch niggas is runnin'
And hiding and shit (You know these motherfuckers be ducking' hidin')
But I'm fucking chasin y'all faggots
All across the globe (Smashing they ass)
Out the back of BET, out the back of clubs
Nigga, you ain't poppin' bub in no motherfuckin' clubs, nowhere

You niggas is fucking clowns, y'all ain't gonna nowhere

Its Murda

Yeah, we here now, don't get scared now
Ja Rule nigga 'bout to tear shit down
What y'all thought y'all was gon' eat forever
And my dog wouldn't blaze heat for cheddar?
We better eat together or meet at the crossroads
'Cause the Lord knows it's Murda, hold those
When yo' casket close and yo' souls rise high
Remember the DEAD don't die 'less they FUCK WITH I!!!

Niggas know who dope, yo
Shit, the flow is wretched
And my G too futuristic for you hoes to catch it
I'm a God send, the fallen angel when I do sin
Far from perfection but still considered a gem
Thank you Lord for givin' me wind beneath my wings
When the miracle spittin' there shall be no witnesses to the pain
And my ignorance, I charge to the game
So many love done slain by bullets with dead aim
I weathered the change
Stormed through the streets in the Range
Can't complain, a nigga live to die in the flames
'Cause I torture, J the A  R-U-L-E
Niggas can't be seriously fuckin' with me
What you hollerin' 'bout?
We can hit up an alley and air out
Bullets exit the barrel, and enter your mouth
That's how I'm built
Under the floss there's nuttin' but filth
Don't let it fool ya
I still let them slugs heat up and cool ya
All forever more, so help me Lord
Gon' find a, way to my grave just because I'm a Mur-der-er
Whole, not part, cut me open
I bleed for the Inc. from the heart
When I start it's usually endless
Pop one with gloves on
Make you check with forensic, son
In yo' appendix, son, you got hit up, huh?
Fuckin' with Ja, you know it's MURDAAA

Yeah, we here now, don't get scared now

Now you eyein' this, ferocious mic supremist
Whose limits is endless
This nigga here done risen
Murderous flows kill suspicion
Niggas is too light in the ass to be shittin'
Hollis Ave. historical, nigga respect tradition
'Cause all I see is bloodshed and niggas wanna see me dead
Inherit this style is sumthin' like a million square miles  (CHANGE IT UP)
Til I - find 'em and hit 'em and be done with 'em
Givin' is gettin' and niggas get got for bullshittin'
I'ma, run up on niggas, gunnin' 'em down
And you confess that I'm the best, so who's touchin' me now?
Shipped three hundred thou' with a freestyle, fuckin' you up
And got you hoes in the back rows tossin' it up
I got the touch 'cause my flow is bananas
Bitches can't stand us, we ghetto fabulous
Aim, when I bust and blast on surprise
If y'all niggas don't know you need to see me live
I'm like two .45's spittin' in every direction

Story to Tell,Venni Vetti Vecci,1999.0,"Niggas, bitches
Gather round, got a story to tell
There it is, there it is

Yo, it's widespread
Thoroughbred, shockingly took two to the head
Knowledge me, God, the shit I'm 'bout to holler is hard
From start, this little nigga had a hell of a heart
His pops, bangin' that shit in his arms, broken
A young mind distorted molded, is there an upside?
His brother got murdered Up North by nietas
My ma, battlin', cancer, of the colon
At the tender age of thirteen, watchin' his world close in
Blood damn near frozen, from a heart so cold
It ain't pumpin' out the love no mo', and I feel that
'Cause God, when you really need it, where the love at?
That's why a lot of niggas got more faith in they gat
Freeze that like a photo, take it with you and know
This lil' nigga bout to kill all comers for cash flow
His role model, the heat, cause it runs streets
His motto, 'Nobody eats but me!'
Finally this young thug turned pro
Used to show love, now he got nothin' but hatred and foes
Five-double-oh's, hoes so deep
He the type of nigga that got it and break down a key
Remember me? J to the A, R-U-L, E baby
Smell the beef, and continue to uhh, give 'em hell
Fill they bodies with shells and leave niggas
With a story to tell, uh-huh

Listen up, I got a story to tell
On the streets we got guns, and drugs for sale
'Cause you hoes know the game that we play is real
Keep your mind on the money and your weapons concealed
Listen up, I got a story to tell
I'm prayin' to God, know I'm goin' to hell
If it's out of my hands, I'll let time prevail, huh
Listen up, I got a story to tell
Listen up, I got a story to tell
Shit...
Niggas mothafucking die for the shit we do!
Hustle hard, from city to city, from state to state...
Let me holla at y'all

Son in B'More, we scored more, than ever before
Copped the two-door, six-double-oh off a roll
Show no love for loss since big eight be that lucky, number
We slammed eight of those in Kentucky
Kept the currency comin', mo', diamonds
New clothes, L.A. hoes that'll ride us pronto
Once you, lived in luxury, you can't leave it
Find yourself, turnin' broke bitches into divas
Can you believe this? In Cleveland we cuttin' these niggas breathin'
Tie 'em on every block, 'til we shut down shop
So keep your Glock cocked, one in the head
Push the five series drop, just in case we gotta spit and spread
The alibi be simply, we was in the Carribean
With two of our women friends, sippin' Remi and Henny
From there we'll flow, to the Florida Keys and blow trees
Fuck a couple of hoes, and spend some cheese
That's how a boy's life is supposed to be
Make our way to N.O. 'cause we, 'bout it, 'bout it
Then down to D.C. where they, cock it, pop it
Listen up, life is nothin' but the hot shit, from here to Wisconsin
Y'all niggas can get it constant
It ain't hard that's like pushin' dope in the 5th Ward
And just to get to God, I'll go through hell
Leave the world, a story to tell, heh

Listen up, I got a story to tell
On the streets we got guns, and drugs for sale
And you hoes know the game that we play is real
Keep your mind on the money and your weapons concealed, huh
Listen up, I got a story to tell
I'm prayin' to God, know I'm goin' to hell
If it's out of my hands, I'll let time prevail

Pop Niggas,The Last Temptation,2003.0,"How many niggas hit the scene like Rule
Bentley GT, pushin' through buck flooded, with jewels?
H-2 with the hungerous wolves beside me
Armed up the army, don't play that with nobody
Rule, Murder & Gotti
We hittin' bitches like Lowe's be hittin' switches, 16 at a time
Times that by how many dimes we lose and find
X'd out and out of they mind, but these are the times of renegades
Prowlin' this bitch with braids
Leather gloves with dark shades and a sawed off gauge
Reminiscin' to Cleo, she go to livin' life flawless
Who's the boss in all this?
It's the GOD, unfortunately
I'm givin' niggas 1 to 3
That means 1 to 3 albums to accomplish what we have built here
You didn't know, this is Rule here
I'm cockin' back, I got an idea

Just hop nigga, hop nigga, just hop niggas, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the Rule comin'
Clear the block, niggas, hop niggas, just hop nigga, 'cause I pop niggas

Hop nigga, hop nigga, just hop nigga, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the Rule comin'
Clear the block, niggas, hop nigga, just hop nigga, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the chrome, run

Y'all niggas wanna see the energy
I'll go at ya like it's a hundred and ten of me
Gun bustin' in every direction, 
the Public Enemy
But naah I ain't Chuck D, its Rule baby
Y'all niggas wanna get it crazy, come on y'all can't fade me
The music is slavery, roll up and haze me
'Cause most niggas is lazy COTTON PICKERS
Wish they'd find out its me and my niggas they gone
'Cause they prisoners of they own home, we party and get it on
LIVE IT UP! As soon as we hit 'em home
We tuckin' away the chrome and humpin' up on some hoes
We dem niggas you love to hate... I know
Who cares I been blowin' your bitch back out for years
Plus she shed so many tears for me
While you was away, was around the time I made 
Put It On Me
So homie, stay from 'round here you ain't know, this is Rule here
I'm cockin' back, I got an idea

Certain niggas need to be kissin' the ground that I walk
Shuttin' up when I talk, it's Rule in full floss
5-0 is tellin' him X marks the speasy
How niggas gettin' this money, it can't be this easy
Believe me, I see between cracks and crevices
Angelic and devilish, what gets better than this?
The shell love and angel live in the darkest angles, this is Rule here
I'm cockin' back, I got an idea

What you thought, nigga?
Uh
It's my nigga, Ja, yo
Respect that
Uh-huh

Top dog, my niggas
You gon' miss
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

It must be the way that I spit shit
That make you say damn this nigga ridiculous
The way I hit 'em and move, nigga that can't lose
Inconspicuous incognito niggas ain't ready
For whoever who has the flow nigga know I spit deadly
Fear me to the day I'm dead on the street with holes in me
The ghettos got love for me 'cause I'ma lay for 'em
Gradually there after
The only fib will be love and disaster
Tears before laughter, but who gon' cry?
My style be so touchin' it could wipe yo eye
Pray truce to obvious lies and dead wise guys
And any bitch niggas feel they fuckin with mines
C'mon let's get it on, to the break in the dawn
Before long, if you wrong, you be dead and gone
And I live on to glorify my name in vain
What you thought motherfuckers, I was playin'? Baby, I hit 'em all

Lord I won't be denied, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
For as long as I'm a alive, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
I want my piece of the pie, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
Respect mine 'til the date of my demise, baby, I hit 'em all
Thinkin' it's a game, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
Show 'em I ain't playin', I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
For operatin' like lanes, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
Hit 'em, hit 'em

Baby, I kill 'em all, whatcha wanna do with this
Nigga nothin', so shut the fuck up
And learn somethin' see my team can get a whole town gamin'
Give it up we even take the small change
Nigga yeah uh you think my way of life fucked up right?
'Til you live it and the cash gets to eattin' at yo spirit
Fear it you be a broke nigga, you near it
You be the next nigga,never have to go back and been it
Cold stares thought you need a killa 'round here
Y'all niggas really have some pitiful ideas
I keep tryin to get this world to see
Hustle hard my mind on that money
My motto to be stack it if you got it for when you get it
Don't talk about it just be about it, that it
Went all odds against niggas gettin' rich
Figured to earn a dollar makes sense, baby, I hit 'em all

Lord I won't be denied, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
For as long as I'm a alive, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
I want my piece of the pie, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em

For operatin' like lanes, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
Hit 'em, hit 'em

Baby, I kill 'em all
Enormous style, comin' fresh out of Queens (Brooklyn!)
I recognize how my killa cliques gettin' down
Get this, while takin' yours into process, niggas is stress
Leavin' peep holes in yo chest god bless the next that get laid to rest
Frustration and stress make me question death
I wanna shoot all niggas I feel should be shot on the spot
Let 'em rot with lead in their knot
Talk shit, you bitch ass niggs be miss
Smoke weed it give you the heart to proceed
Whatcha game plan you da man
Go for your guns feel no remorse
When I leave your brain and runs
Now settle down get your shit tight
Show respect, move right, and everything is aight
But if you slip, son, that ass is gone
Top Dog motherfuckers recognize
Baby, I'ma hit 'em all

Lord I won't be denied, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
For as long as I'm a alive, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em

Who bust slugs for me, my baby
Who gon' kill for you like I comfort you
Who else but the Rule, you feel me
Girl, when we connect with dots we hit the spot
Twin Benzs you ride hard, I ride drop
And to make it better, baby got the Nina' Biretta tucked low
When I'm two cars back with the four, four
And it freaks you out on your mommas couch
That's what us thugs be 'bout, you know me
And when I pray for love, baby, pray for us
Who celebrates the thugs, my lady
Got me seekin' capital game when I spit sixteen
Where the bars are sixteen in the doors of cars
A star is born in the hood
Made a name live on R U L E, ladies, feel me

Snitches get it back who gets to your backs for, my boy
What part of the game is that, huh?
Niggas, and they feelings 'cause I handle your dealings
Keep your name intact, my fame's intact
So cops won't know what it's hittin' for
Now hoes wanna know what you shittin' for

It's mental, mash your enemies, we out in the rental
I'm your bitch, niggas run up on, ya
Shift ya lungs, who's your organ donor?

Baby, you could die from love
At any given time I could die from slugs
But that's what this life is capable of
The death and the life of a bitch and a thug
Is what I'm scared of
But got a woman who ain't afraid
To tuck the toast in the Escalade
Pop on niggas, that showin' me shade
But only for the Rule 'cause that's, my baby
Got me a down ass bitch with red hair that don't care
Blazed by the shots and flares, girl, c'mon
Follow me and bust back at police conceal ya, heat
It's a bit much to blaze up Rule and Chuck

One of Us,Rule 3:36,2000.0,"(One of us) Yeah, Rule
(One of us) Yeah, nigga
If God were one of us
(One of us) What about that?
What if he was?
What if he was me?
(One of us) What the fuck would I do?

Lord, when I die pacify, crucify me
I rock a Devil cross, one's for the soul one's for the body
If I'm built then God dies, I wanna see God cry
Real tears from a burned out life in ten years
I swore I got the Devil in me, with no fear
If I hear I can't see, if I see I can't hear
It's the eerie little thing between deathness and blindness
Weakness and kindness, rejects and primaz
I'm on this when I'm hollerin', ""Dear Lord, take me"" (One of us)
(Baby) 'Cause I ain't really happy here, can you blame me?
This game done changed me, made me an animal
I can't even laugh no more, my kids smile for me now
I'm the one-and-only, my momma's only child
Lord, save me before I go crazy
'Cause if you, live through the strain
Just to die from the pain, tell me
Would you believe that you could breathe again?

If God were one of us (One of us)
Would he sin and love to lie? I wanna know
If God were one of us (One of us)
Would he freakin' live his life? I wanna know
If God were one of us (One of us)
Would he use his name in vain? I need to know
If God were one of us (One of us)
Would he believe that he could breathe again?

Yo, yo, now let's look at things through my right hand
What if you was that man?
Would you run with me? Gun with me?
Would you understand the hustlin', the struggling
Live amongst dope heads, raisin' your kids and runnin' from the Feds
We'd be bound to bump heads, 'cause you livin' my life
All righteous, and you said livin' righteous was right
But there's two sides to life - one dark, one light
If you lighten up forever you can dig to the night
Wrap them guns over there, and bring 'em on ova' here (One of us)
'Cause my God is bigger down your god down here
Now we ride jet sled baby, bubble in Ba-Namb
'Cause Rule and the Lord got it goin' on
Been, known to do bad shit, I'm so heavenly, but so devilish
If, you, live through the strain just to die from the pain, tell me
Would you believe that you could breathe again?

If God were one of us (One of us)
Would he sin and love to lie? I wanna know
If God were one of us (One of us)
Would he freakin' live his life? I wanna know
If God were one of us (One of us)
Would he use his name in vain? I need to know
If God were one of us (One of us)
Would he believe that he could breathe again?

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yo
Let's trade places, Rule be Spirit, God be flesh
And let's see just how, weak the flesh gets
Now you call on me, ""Every night bend your knee""
Until you start to realize I ain't answerin'
Now you hang up the phone, Lord, pick up the chrome, Lord
Can I blame you, Lord, for needin' a feed what's yours?
Got a wife that you love, yet you still lust whores
And I'm supposed to judge you, on earth where it's ugly
You might as well aim at the sky, slug me (One of us)
'Cause I ain't bein' a Fair God, when life is so hard
I know what'chu goin' through, every move you make
Every crime committed every little mistake
I still got love for ya, fair is fair
As long as you repent you'll be good up here (Baby)
'Cause if you, live through the strain
Just to die from the pain, tell me
Would you believe that you could breathe again?

If God were one of us (One of us)
Would he sin and love to lie? I wanna know
If God were one of us (One of us)
Would he freakin' live his life? I wanna know
If God were one of us (One of us)
Would he use his name in vain? I need to know

Yeah my nigga Rule, Hussein Fatal
The outlaw don in this piece motherfucker
I want to welcome y'all niggas back to the streets (it's alright!)
You's confused for a minute but here we are
My nigga Cad in this motherfucker
I got my niggas man, them bricks (finish bitch!)
Ride out nigga
Uh, yeah
 (Hussein Fatal talks over Break)
The life, the life (the life, the life)
The life, the life (the life, the life)
The life, the life (the life, the life)

Yo, what up world, it's Rule public enemy number one
It's cool, my new best friend is my pistol
And anybody that want it or got jewels run it
And end over your head, don't make me gun butt it
Do you like Manolo, put two in your stomach
And flash the burner on bitches like stacks of hundreds
I'm livin my life (my life), what gets better than ice in hell
When you cookin up coke to sell
It be the little statistics, some pictures, some prints
Some informants to get the operation pitched
We enormous, some would say the ""Inc."" is ""Murderous""
You don't want us to strap up and bang the strip
But if need be, we'll bang out like Bloods and Crips
Styrofoam the noozles and extend the clips
Murder meets gangsta shit
And all my niggas that live it from hood to hood bang to this, nigga

The life, the life (the life, the life ...)
Whether your Blood or cuz we all gangsta
The life, the life (the life, the life ...)
Whether it's dope or coke we all slang drugs

I'm the street's poster child
I'm supposed to wile
With the toast I'm foul
My Murder Inc. mob money, Oprah style
From here back to the block, they get that green
Known to put a hole through a nigga's shoulder soon as the beam glow
Probably graze you in the face, give me a break
I'mma rapper, out here to stay, don't make me do what I say
Just let me say what I do
Cause I'mma put it in a rhyme, everytime, about to spray up your crew
And I ain't lickin off shots to warn 'em
Just a pop swift to the dome, on the real ""G-Unit"" nigga, Glock and all this
So believe I'm not the one when it get stupid in the booth
I told y'all with Rule it was a gun in this bitch
Now I expose how scary you niggas is
And when you want the bis
My brick city outlaws' a bury you niggas
I'm so cool, when I ain't doin my numbers
Let the ...

Okay, motherfuckers when the bounce came to your waist
And shells get to droppin
You better duck, and get up poppin
Don't get left with the cops
Gangsta, yeah, put that work in
Put a nigga dick in the dirt
Lace shots to the face
Hopin it shut case, John Doe
Unidentified, I always hit 'em high when I dump and let it fly
Now once with 45 nigga I had a picture on top of the coffin
Murder Inc. bosses

The life, the life (the life, the life ...)
Whether your Blood or cuz we all gangsta
The life, the life (the life, the life ...)
Whether it's dope or coke we all slang drugs
The life, the life (the life, the life ...)
Whether your hoein or stuck up, we're still gon' fuck
The life, the life (the life, the life ...)
Niggas don't want it with us, cause it's Murder

Okay you hard as fuck
But when the slug hit, you dead if your name ain't armored truck
Murder Inc., Outlawz and the Floys is here
Bang, bang, shoot 'em up, cowboys is near
Stampedin anythin in our way, we'll attract war
If your smart you'll slide over like handicap doors
I ain't a killer, I just spark a lot
So when I squeeze I'm turnin your whole block to a parking lot
Understand I'm the grimy Floy
Wanna trip to death then try me for it
Crazy since '94, that's why cats don't hang around me like Chinese stores
One step ahead of you, get more guys
You strapped with four fours, we pack four fives
Fuck talk get the chalk out
You'll be lucky if your able to crawl or walk out

I'm in the pop life
So when I pop up in your life, and I pop twice
Get down, I spits more than rounds
And niggas bleed heavier than hoes on they period
This sound gotta movin ""Faster Than Furious""
But nah I ain't Ludacris
I'm here to let y'all niggas know I ain't new to this
Gun butt your bitch
That's the way I get down, believe my style is Murder
Clap a nigga, dipped and hide the burner
The rule to learn ya bomb ya like embalmin fluid
Until your limbs feel a loss of movement
In the hospital in critical livin
Must minimal (who done it?) it's Murder
Yeah, that's subliminal
Who gets down and bangs with nothin but criminals (c'mon, c'mon)
Rule nigga you know it, these others cats is pitiful
Bein a rap God is spiritual
Your God is Ja Rule nigga let's not get it confused, haha

Life Goes On,R.U.L.E.,2004.0,"Yea
This one goes out
To all my niggas across the world
Going through that struggle
Feeling that pain
We with you my niggas
But no matter what God has planned for us
Know this
Life goes on

I pour out the liquor for (Ohh)
I wish, I wish, I wish for (Yea)
For all my niggas that's dead and gone (Ohh yea)
I'ma see you when I get there (Life goes on)
I pour out the liquor for (Ohh)
I wish, I wish, I wish for (Yea)
For all my niggas that's dead and gone (Ohh yea)
I'ma see you when I get there (Life goes on)

They say ""Kill or be killed's the only way to live these days""
So how come only my hood niggas live this way
We put together the puzzle, but still stuck in a maze
I put it all in perspective cause I'm coming of age
28 and I see more niggas go to the grave
More mommas in pain
More murals with names (Ey)
Sometimes you look to the Lord to blame
And pray every day wishing that things could change
Cause I'm just wishing you was here, my niggas
Wish that you could be with me to ball, my niggas
Send a sign I'm on call, niggas
Promise to pick me up if I fall, my niggas
The way I wish y'all was still alive (I know)
Through memories y'all still alive (And I know)
Through my eyes in my mind, you'll live forever

I pour it out for my niggas that's dead and gone
As for my niggas in prison, I throw it up cause I'm riding for 'em
Big Black and Lil Will, them there my niggas still
Mu Tah and Lil Itchy, you know a nigga miss you
Tron and Lil Al, Bam, Skeet and Younger Al
Tron and Lil Trap, I wish y'all was still here
And I ain't a heard a word for more than 10 years
I feel that if I'd been there, he'd still be here
But I'ma hold it down and ain't gon' cry about it
'Cause I'ma holla at ya, I'll see you in the next life
And I'll still be that same nigga
Still doin' thug thizzle
Wearing the same ol' Dickies
Then we can still drink the same Henny
Cause back then that's how we did it
So how could I forget it?
My three daughters and goals out the doors
I lost in the struggle
My homie and my oldest brother

I pour out the liquor for (Ohh) (Pour us some liquor for)
I wish, I wish, I wish for (Yea) (Whoa, I wish for)
For all my niggas that's dead and gone (Ohh yea) (For all my niggas, yeah)
I'ma see you when I get there (Life goes on)

But instead, I'm in tears
But when you passed it rained
And God's tears took away the fucking pain
So look man (Ey)

And I'm bout to tell your bitch how a ho should live
Get a nigga hold him down even thru his bid
Coz I put this on my momma and my 3 born kids
I'm a get this chicken and flip it as long as I live
And if there's beef on the menu I'll cook it at 50 degrees (?)
Shoud I continue?
You hot I'll put you on freeze
You know who I'm talkin to mister 5-0
You know where they go when them niggas need info
Over and out 10-4 I'll buck at you later

Coz I've got gwop just like you but I don't get shot like you do
You bitch nigga
Back to the pick of the litter here kitty kitty I get so much pussy

Bottom birds for the winter down south in neworlands
Then head up top for some peach pickin in Georgia
Name your price lil mamma I can fuckin afford ya

Murder INC
Takin' flight
We go hard
Betta get it right

We go hard! yeah
Player not for nuttin'
I spit fo' and leave a nigga bent up fo' sho', get low
Only got love for gangsta niggas, get doe
That's for all the hatin' niggas waitin' to see me go
Down to the bottom
Chop up crack
Playin' the blocks and
Still wouldn't matter, push the rock well like Stockton
Paper chasin', chasin' acres
Operation get rich, take money over a bitch
You see me move low in the six and magazines a flicks
Playin' hard in the porch, plush
Young thuggin' and bossed up
Touch niggas clutchin' what they know they bustin'
We can do whatever nigga, whenever nigga
Really is nothing
Murder killa, we crush 'em, shit
Got the industry on romadon
While we celebrate tastin' bottles of Perinon
So for life it's murder
Ice burners, stacks and trucks
We after bucks, mother fucker!
Murder INC

Murder INC.'s the underdog
It's a blessin' to ball
We learn a lesson from y'all
How not to fall
Black Child will body a beat, this is airway robbery
When Murder INC. drop albums, that's when gangstas party
What chu know about Ferrari or Cadillac Escalade
Or bitches on Ecstasy, sexy
Eat, sleep, eat and watch freaks eat freaks
Throw it up, put it down for the streets
Who wouldn't fall in love, with a life like this
Hittin' hoes that's priceless
In tight icebergs shit
You can blame the drugs
It ain't gon' change to slugs
A famous thug
Pain is love, mother fuckers!
 (2X)

Who would've thought, we get away with manslaughter
Numerous cars, cribs off the water
A playa no longer, life's gettin' shorter
Tired of hoes takin' offers, instead of orders
The Rule don't condone this
Cause in the late '60's this game was flawless
Until blow got on the rise
Them ol' Jacks was slingin' pies in bell bottoms and buttonflies
But now, pop yo collars, blow set for sag
And we still fly birds L-A-X to Lag
They roll caddies with white walls, we ride Benz with mags
Still the goal remains the same, guard from feds
Y-D to O-G, the game chose me
R-U-L-E the INC. and I-G
We never gon' break free from this life we live as thugs
Pain is love, it's murda
 (2X)

You see the life we live, we on the murderous shit
And every time we breathe, it's Murder I-N-C
You know it's love to thug, cause thug is in our blood
And how we paint this shit, stay on that gangsta shit
You see the life we live, we on the murderous shit
And every time we breathe, it's Murder I-N-C
You know it's love to thug, cause thug is in our blood
And how we paint this shit, stay on that gangsta shit
Stay on that gangsta shit, stay on that gangsta shit
Stay on that gangsta shit
See what we do when we do what we do when we do it
Stay on that gangsta shit",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-the-inc-lyrics

For what it's worth everything that I believe in
My Lord, if they saw where a nigga been
Would they applaud my achievements?
I'm killing these niggas for a reason
Laying them down
Ain't nothing for now
While I'm breathing
I'ma ride for niggas, that ride for me
Knowing in my heart that these same niggas would die for me
Bleed, tears of love to my lost blood
You can see the pain in my eyes and what it does and why
I don't give a fuck whether I live or die
I'm a paint this world a portrait of my mind
Show 'em, if they deny it, blow 'em
Pass me the iron let me bite them wit' the bulldog made by design
Niggas gon' give me mines
Or get in line for the torture
I swear, runnin' you closer to air
My bullets travel wit' prayers
Guns blazin' in pairs
Who the nigga you fear
JA Rule, motherfucker
All my hoes and hustlers
Ride wit' me
Get a feelin' on how this world did me
Was curious 'till it all hit me
But its clear now
Though it's a narrow hall that I stare down
I'm huggin' the bars, kissin' the ground
Fuckin' around wit' the Rule nigga
What you tryin to do
Make me put a hole in you
And your bitch too
Let's make this an issue
How we do it thug style
Turn the lights off world
It's a lockdown

Fuck a price girl

On call killers from Atlanta to Dainamall
N-Y baby, you see why
We the world's murderous guys
With Mafia ties
Fuck around and die
I, found myself me and my nine
Doin' a jooks, stickin' to crime
A true crook in 9-9
My nigga you holdin' me down
We fuck around
And start killin' these clowns
We're hittin' 'em now
Fools, lie down
Quarters to halves to pounds
Nigga I'm seein' triple of the breakdown
That's what I make now
And nothin' flake now
Fuck the law
50-50 love showed across the board

I'm a bastard hollerin' ""Fuck me!""
Blaze to the death and die with dignity
For the life of me
I just wanna remain
A nigga that's loyally loved through his levels of pain
And I won't be contained
Even if you incarcerate
Still I'm only in chains
Bury bread and stash the range
It's how a thug would do things
Get arranged, start diggin' for change
Then get back in the game
And try to see through my thoughts why
You ain't ready for whats on my mind
Too inclined
One of Gods feared and most greatest design
See, any nigga that lies
Is a nigga you watch
Make him easy to dot
Send him in a rag-gedy box
You lookin' me in my eyes, huh?
What you see? My vision for pain?
My lust for sluts and whores?

Bottle of henesey, dro and some dutches
Man I'll pull up in like three in the mornin, honkin

And tellin me come on in get out of the cold
But never the less I hit the flesh and gotta go, rarely though
Let me put a buck in your ear
And let you know I'm the thug of the year
And the last thing I do is care
Legs up, killin it, drillin it
Man she feelin it, shiverin, talkin in tounges
Caddy gotta sprong, daddy long shlong
We get it on, like pong
Stars wit a gangsta twist to it

Way I flip it, smack it, bounce it, ride it, taste it
Lick her tits, break down the walls the basics

And you defend on the ball like Garry the Glove

Brought her own K-Y ready for penetration

And you'll murder me the same way I murder you

Judas,The Mirror,2009.0,"Yeah... ahhhh, ahhh
Yeah, I'ma tell y'all a little story
It's a classic tale of love, hate, jealousy.. betrayal
Judas... forgive them father for, they know, not what, they do
(Yeah, let's go.. let's talk to 'em, haha)

Dear Judas, what it do homie?
How you feeling these days nigga, a little lonely?
No D, no Y, no E, no Kiss, no Styles
No Ruff, no Ryders, Double R's finest
We grown men nigga, I tried to put it behind us
But niggas always mistake weakness and kindness
Til it gets to violence
Then it's too late to silence
The wolves from howling, the gunshots, the sirens
The mind set of a nigga when niggas got problems
Instead of resolve 'em, rather result to revolvers, to be honest
Betrayal's a blessing, like a promise that's broken
I see through lies more than often
Look in the mirror, can you lie to your own portrait?
If so, then look a little closer
And tell me who you see
And if you proud of what you saw
'Cause who you are is Judas

After all that we've been through (I never thought it'd be you)
Trust in all I thought I knew (guess I didn't know you well)
Tell the lies to hide the truth (should have known they wasn't true)
Who would ever think that you'd (turn out to be a Judas)

Dear Judas, or should I say Judai?
I wanna say I miss you, but that might be a lie
And I can't lie to myself too much self pride
I can lie to anyone else, at times even God
Now you claim heartbreak and emotional scars
But I say you was getting while it's good 'til it's gone
But you of all people should know my lights don't turn off
And this is my sitcom, you're just a spin-off
And I don't mean to be harsh, but sister you're lost
One like Jay and Beby, Fay' and Biggie
It really hurt when you said you can't throw any
M's up, baby 'cause it's hurting your image, really?
Have you looked at yourself lately?
If not, then look a little clearly
And tell me who you see
And if you're proud of what you saw
'Cause who you are is Judas

After all that we've been through (I never thought it'd be you)
Trust in all I thought I knew (guess I didn't know you well)
Tell the lies to hide the truth (should have known they wasn't true)
Who would ever think that you'd (turn out to be a Judas)

Dear Judas, this one's for whom ever the shoe fits
'Cause niggas wear hate like Air Forces
Talk shit, of course they do, it's the price of fame
If part of this is getting paid then so is being betrayed
But how it all plays out is how it's being portrayed
I don't believe half of anything anybody says
You liar you, you lie to me
Here lies the truth, RULE, you in the way? MOVE
And I'm talking to you, you, you and you
If you know who you are, then come holla at the God
Judas's, Jesus, Caesar, and Brutus's
While we must forgive, damn it father
For them know not what they do
I'll keep my hand on my gun, on my Bible, and pray for you
'Cause you'll never be the same since I saw you as Judas

After all that we've been through (I never thought it'd be you)
Trust in all I thought I knew (guess I didn't know you well)
Tell the lies to hide the truth (should have known they wasn't true)
Who would ever think that you'd (turn out to be a Judas)",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-judas-lyrics

And if there's more than one that got to go, grab the calico and

Cause there's no real niggas left to hold the torch
Who gon' hold us of, cause you don't read newspaper's nigga
Let Ja tell it, that's Murder Inc boy's, that's real killers
Money laundering, tax evadin and drug dealers
Backed by Kenneth Mcgriff, you can't be serious
We just niggas getting money, fucking all the bitches
And life and death can be a matter of inches
You know
That fo' four that handle his buisness
Like capital gains, reload and hit them with intrest
Damn
What so gangsta about these niggas
Now I got the full speed niggas, led
Leave them dead over bread, or head
Cause we done fucking these same bitches
And you know they talk, and the pillows be my witness
My forgiveness
Niggas can't be this stupid
It's gun talk, niggas better get used to it


I dont' care if you're a criminal or a cop, shoot or get shot
I'm raised by the plot, product of the hater
The gauge and the Glock, and I keep a blade
I ain't afraid if it pop, the gauge still a gun
Married muder one, sleep with the fishes
Tasting red rum, young and corrupted
Nothing to fuck with, straight out of the gutter
With no introduction
Our role models is forced with the hollows
Fuck slothes the swallow the fifth a holla
The witness Impala
Weed twisting ganja
Load up the clip's and flip the corner
They Morner, be morners they goners
We gangster, gangster point and blank ya'
Thank ya'
Niggas keep me in the mood
To eat a nigga food
I murder with real bombs


The nine the cal the pound the 'co, niggas
The weed the dope the E' the coke, niggas
The gauge is mine, that's all I know
I've been doing this since 9 6, the oldies know
This tough load, the 3 8 o's, I let my ho's hold
Keep it in their purses, In case of illegal searching
They got worship god, and trust the gun
Ask for your forgiveness, and send niggas up
Fucking stick niggas up, these bitch niggas touch
It's all about violence, real niggas is silent
And know these niggas whose guns got low mileage
Got ducked taped, hog tied up in their houses
I'll make you watch while I fuck the spouse
This, ain't buisness, it's personal, gun talk

Uh, c'mon
Yeah, yeah, yeah, haha
Nothin like the future

Guess who's back to personify money, power, and bitches
But when bitches been gettin money, that's when shit get ridiculous
I'm hittin switches like six fo's, bouncin and leanin
The west coast seemin, keep the fo' fo' demon
And the rock's all stashed up
Roll up a little diesel, keep it hashed up
Then +Holla, Holla+ at the whores, is hollerin back
Let 'em know a few facts like if your ridin, your back's slidin
This is the 'Race Against Time' and I ain't got time to waste
To give chase, I put a hole in your fitted
Put your head to the barrel like DJ's a spin it
Backward, to blow off the backwood, I'm so hood
But what's really hood, when you ain't doin your hood
No motherfuckin good, and bein misunderstood
I would die if I could, Rule the lion
And I'mma keep ""ri-da-da-da-da-in""
 - 2X
Race against time, I - can't stop
Runnin through the red light - livin my life
Even if I'm gettin too hot
Still I can't stop - ""Ri-da-da-da-din""

Bless the day that the God was born two, twenty-nine, seventy-six
When cocaine was heavily mixed
And all the niggas had a fixation for bad reputation
For pimpin hoes, and shootin fo, to bring the free basin
If this is time erasin, the devil is runnin like Bettis
And got his guns out lookin for ways to behead us
You can die in a matter of seconds, so I'mma slow it down
Turn back the hands of time with the .40 Cal
Claimin your style is ""Guerrilla"", so I'mma define the meanin of ""Murder"", it's killer
You outta your mind, the burner's designed for the fill up
No gas, and when I spits like acid
Smoke reefer, blow ether, spit ashes
Cause young Rule is in his prime like 'Clay Cassius'
Hated by the masses, but overwhelmed with love and passion
For when I die niggas keep ""ri-da-da-da-din""


If Jesus Christ was criticized, then why not me
What the fuck am I special, I struck a deal with the devil
Haha, advocate of profit, which one seems like it's logic
Me in church, or me in bed with bitches ménaging
I can chase like sergeant, addictive like heroin
Outsiders just lookin in, through a barrel that's pinned to the peep hole
They seein all or nothin like Jazz from Clisco
Hit 'em up and let's go, jump over the threshold
I just got married to bangin pistol, drugs and other shit
Fell in love with a bitch that I call crime
She reminded me that nobody can beat time
If you get enough of it nigga
So I looked her dead in her eyes and pulled the trigger
Thinkin that the music and film would be somethin different
But this the same old criminal vibin
I ain't hidin, I'mma keep ""ri-da-da-da-din""",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-race-against-time-ii-lyrics

Cause you got enough jewelrey on your body to buy a Ferari
I'm like Ruben ""I'm Sorry"" but I don't stutter
Matter call me Frank love cause I'll let her fuck ya
She said ""slow baby don't rush, I promise if you be patient
I'll let you tear it up"" and nigga sho nuff
We decided to keep in touch with each other ya feel me?
I didn't know that me touchin would lead to her catchin feelings
I'm Serrious and I'm so Sincerre, my object is to stay in the clear
Cause we find, fuck then flee these broads round here
I done made so many women shed so many tears
Sittin home all alone gettin drunk off of shots of Vedron
Decided to call let her feelins be known in a slurred tone
She said ""I always get what I want and all I want is you""
But I don't get it cause


Girl our situation is getting a little out of my hands
You calling me constant tellin bitches that I'm your man
I thought we was just friends conversating
Getting to know one another on a friendly basis
Lets face it, we from two different worlds that don't collide
But when they do the crash is small like a facad
Your favorite season is Beghotti and mine is Summer
You use credit I rubberband wrap my hundreds
We got in common is minumum right next to nothing
And I think thats what sumblimaly keeping you coming
Back to the one you been fuckin but never thought you'd be fuckin
How often do you think about akwardness of it?
I know you love it to say the least and I ain't just sayin
That contrary to some beliefs I present the track
And my track record is something to be expected
Money, Cash, Hoes you know how it goes


Who would've thought that something so simple
Would turn out to be dentramental now I'm feeling
Like I'm caught in the middle of this love triangle
Between she, me and reality, and reality is telling
Us that we could never be, cause I come from the streets
And you come from a rich family, but I don't think that your
Family would understand me, It's just them little things you overlook
When you're around me drugs, guns, bitches and needless to say
You're a pimp in your own way baby you're making it hard
For me to look you in your eyes and tell you to move on
I'm Gone (I'm Gone) but then I'm back again
Money and good pussy is a ""Fatal Attraction""
From then she hits me everynight quarter past 10
And with every call her voice got a little more tense
Now we involved and it really don't make no sense
So be careful what you ask for you just might get it BIOCTH!!!",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-never-thought-lyrics
It’s Your Life,Rule 3:36,2000.0,"Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Ja Rule, uh
Shade and Irv Gotti
Niggas don't want none of this

Ladies call me white Kane, pure as snow
Like cocaine, cutie-pies powder they nose
I've been preaching to the stars
Ladies be livin' real harder
A lot of icons, but consider me God
Born in the seventies
The eighties was growing wit time
Now it's two G nigga
And the world is mine
I was a smart nigga
Figured if he put me on the spot
Wit hot shit bubble me up 'til I rock
Come put me on the block
In a new form and new sound
For Ja Rule and I'm feeling like I'm too strong
I move on down to D.C., V.A
And I even did as far as Californ-I-A
Come to shit
They fly, they float, they snort, they smoke
Hustle, bag and mope
For more
Down the freeway racing out of control, it's crazy
When you fucking with Rule it's shady

Niggas if you hustle and stick 'em
It's your life
Bitches if you fuckin' and striping
It's alright
We all got to eat
So live your life
Niggas, it's alright
Bitches, it's your life
Bitches if you fuckin' and striping
It's alright
Niggas if you hustle and stick 'em
It's your life
We all got to eat
So live your life
Bitches, it's your life
Niggas, it's alright

Now I got to hit you with some other shit
Sentinella gutta shit
Four sides of the chrome
Flows smack you with the rubber grip
Never been a nigga, niggas wanna play they cards wit
See me in the dark whip
Better go call your guards quick
Better go hit the block and tell them bitches that shisty shit
Known the freaks face like that yellow bezel ice shit
Similar response, yo that kid spit the nicest
Baby re-intice this, CD's raise they prices
Make a nigga chain, said off in a different name
Maid think they got flame, Shade just hit the brain
Me and Ja fucked around and made the teams A-list
Two niggas from two sides, like a 7/10 split bitch

Niggas if you hustle and stick 'em
It's your life
Bitches if you fuckin' and striping
It's alright
We all got to eat
So live your life
Niggas, it's alright

So live your life
Bitches, it's your life
Niggas, it's alright

Niggas from the East
Christ from the gun to the mics
I'm living my life
Running through hell with no ice
It's a sin
But I'd sell my lost soul to win
Go to bed and die
Then I'd wake up breathing again
Cause I'm all in
Even though shit ain't right
I wake up sweatin' my life every night
Help me, is it the devil that going to get me
Or is it God don't feel like being bothered with me
So hard to hit me, this life a sacrifice
If I grow blind through the dark my kids gonna see the light
If I die young it's cause a nigga too high strung
Got scary love for gun wit too much weed in my lungs
And still niggas screaming Ja the one, the chosen
The God's only begotten son, it's my life

Niggas if you hustle and stick 'em
It's your life
Bitches if you fuckin' and striping

Black Vodka,Pain Is Love 2,2012.0,"Black vodka, body so proper
I love the way she is on top of me
Black vodka, body so proper
I love the way she is on top of me

She better come straight with no chaser
'Cause ran this motherfucker, I'd chase her
And she the only one I got a taste for
All drinks is on me, I can taste her
'Cause I know that you see me through the glass
So cool it down boy, they call me Ice cube
You always go down so smooth
I think I'll have a double with you
Vodka came with Khalua
And vermouth for guesses to three
And this is how I see you
A couple more'll make 'em all look like Shakira

A few shots of tequila, it might kill you
Or it's more than likely to get your mind blown
Feel me, more importantly you feel love
If not, maybe you didn't have enough of that

Black vodka, body so proper
I love the way she is on top of me
Black vodka, body so proper
I love the way she is on top of me

I very rarely drinking on a weekday
But this was the day after Tuesday, hump day
So I make an exception to the rule
Got cocktails for two, it was only me and you
Ugly, like a hangover
Had a fuck and get drunk and call my ex over
She will remain sober
But have you ever seen this bitch with her clothes off
We turn the lights off, lit up some candles
She was the OJ, I was the Smirnoff
Cancel, it's like when the show's over
House lights off, everybody go home

Cause too much of petroleum might kill you
It's more than likely to get your mind blown
Feel me, more importantly you feel love
If not, maybe you didn't have enough of that

Black vodka, body so proper
I love the way she is on top of me
Black vodka, body so proper
I love the way she is on top of me

Pretty brown eyes, beautiful lips
Dark complexion like licorice
I run my finger around the edge of the rim
Of my shot glass, body's an hourglass
It's summertime, still got class
Still the best shot a nigga ever threw back
You finna get me drunk fast
Hit me home, strip me down, butterfly effect
You so fly (so fly)
I'm so high (so high)
I can't lie, no matter how bad I want you
You ain't ever gon' feel like the firšt time

And too much tequila might kill you
But it's more than likely to get your mind blown
Feel me, more importantly you feel love
If not, maybe you didn't have enough of that

Black vodka, body so proper
I love the way she is on top of me
Black vodka, body so proper
I love the way she is on top of me",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-black-vodka-lyrics

Your'e doing you're work for them!
You know why?
-(Yeah...)
Do you know why?!

Cause you happend just to be a mothafucking nigga!

It's plain to see, you can't change me
'Cause I'm a be a nigga for life

For life we gonna be niggas
Fuck the world it's yours my niggas
Load the nine and blaze my niggas
Yeah, 'cause I'm a nigga for life

Who's that chipped out?
Twenty-one year old, hot commodity
Coming out of a bum deal lottery
With a flow like sodomy
Put it on your bitch ass quite properly
I suggest you keep all eyes on me
And don't sleep as it is I'm highly critique
Pussy, money, murder it's part of my mystique
You feelin' me, this here is one of Queens elite
Predecessor of the street
While you munch, I eat
Ja's here
The nigga you love, but still fear
I done been there, done that
Now nigga, it's my year
I can leave you on the clear view
If you ain't yet clear
Matter of fact if you breathin' be glad you got air
Shut the fuck up
When grown folks are talkin', you hear?
Or get your shit blown, baby
From mouth to ear
Don't fear, when you smoke weed and fuckin your wife
Why? 'Cause I'm a nigga for life

Spare yourself the reality of an ass whippin'
That I'm givin' when I be gettin' tight and start flippin'
On your bitch ass niggas who like forming a cipher
It gets me hyper
Want the real? I'm a slice ya!
Light ya ass up with sixteen or more
Slugs coming from my snub nose Bulldog
Raw, to the core, let's lay down some laws
This is Ja's house, bow down or bring the war
Motherfuckers
Y'all don't want to touch what's hot
Whatever it be
The mic, the Glock, the drug spot
Like a bitch, you scared of life and takin' chances
And right now, you showin' more ass then an exotic dancer
The answer is this, niggas don't wanna touch
Ja live, stronger then a fucking coke rush
See on the streets we be killin' niggas like cash
You heard? I.N.C., nigga, it's Murdaaa!

Nigga, I live amongst the thoroughbreds, was raised to blaze lead
If you get shot, play dead, and put two in his head
Known to pasteurize and criticize a nigga size
Look him right in his the eyes and leave him dead where he lies
Come through mobbin' like Crips from Compton
We're all in burners and all sippin' on Gin, fuck flossin'
Nigga, I'm tossin' iron
And if you ain't buyin'
Then you're dyin'
For denyin'
I'm so inspirin'
To the youth, see I'm settin' it straight
Lettin' them know never to step on nothin' less than an eighth
And the longer it takes, somebody is gonna die for it
The ""Streets is Watchin',"" Jigga warned you, don't ignore it
Cause only niggas holdin', go JAP and blow yen
With the six double-oh
Fresh out of the pen
Brandishing the steel for the ice
Holdin' my dick, talkin' shit, shootin' dice
A nigga for life
So whatchu sayin' is
What the fuck is a nigga?
Rob a bitch, slap a bitch
All that shit

Murder Inc Motherfucker

We world wide connected, and ya'll don't want to fuck with us
In the streets we respected, so ya'll don't want to fuck wit us
World wide connected nigga, ya'll don't want to fuck wit us
We gangster ass niggas and we hard to hit
Murder Inc in the role who could fuck wit this

It ain't no verse mother fuckers who fake east thugs
Its murder Inc and the Row nigga throw up your dub
They show us love in the club real niggas bossed up man
We heavily intoxicated so toss it up
Attacks your mind and your conscience
Written to enhance this verbally thugs grammar
I'm bout to touch the roof wit it
Extraordinary and I was never ordinary in cemetery
Bisit my thugs in mortuaries
End all most reality young name and 'Pac
I'm a keep my heat tucked until my soul goes pop
I hear a lot of niggas rapping
But there ain't that many rappers out there scraping and keep it cracking
We keep it happening
I'm a million out the gate
No scratch that 8 from cd's to tapes we rock like earthquakes
I'm Eastwood catch me dipping a Fleetwood like a g should
Young Eastwood is so damn good


Nigga Crooked I is raw spit
Murder Inc. and the Row, we all sick
So all niggas involved get mauled quick as a dog, and the braul gets you to fall
Then I'ma draw quick, nigga awwww shit
Punks talking lip, I haul off quick
Wit a sawed off kick it's like you fall off cliffs
Y'all call it off before all y'all get stomped
Like you're fallen off in a raw mosh pit
Off in a ditch your coffin'll sit
While I floss in the awesomest whips and I toss in your chicks
Your caution when your calling your six
Cause your talk can get you crossed and lost in the mix
I'm a pause in the bitch bossed in the pits
Burn I serve niggas stay off at ya clique
Spend off with ya grip my land of gangreen
You have the doctors taking your leg off of your hip
Motherfucker!


All y'all niggas need to get off my dick
I spit it how I live it plus the flows real sick
Bronchial eating
I got killers ranged from Compton to Cleveland
World wide connected air tight niggas there's no breathing
Give me the reason I put a halo throw your mental
And give your the Holy Spirit and see you to gods temple
I'm the avenging angle and earth be thy claim
And Ja be thy name, I know your all praying
For the day of my diminishing
Why don't somebody finish them off and put it right through his cross
The X's The 50'S ya'll gotta be kidding me
These niggas is my sons
Raised them from young
Curtis and lil earl, should of been little girls
Coz they bitchmade now they act like one of my itchbays

When they wanna get too attached
But you know you can't do that, love
I'm just here to fuck, you know that, love
Want you want, baby, roll it or what
While you think about
Twist me a douche, you holdin' me up
How many bitches wanna ride with me?
Or come through with the top down, like
Where my bitches at hop in, make it fast, don't slow me down
Where the fuck my killers at?
End of the light, wait now
Pop and be done with 'em now
Niggas don't want it now

Where the fuck them clowns at?
Kickin' the dough for the pussy by the hour
Where them hoers at?

I went through Drug money
Hustlin' every day to get a taste
Moved on to Blood money

Spit the raw and forever more keep chase
Holla out my niggas, be the word of mouth
My bitches bang head like the dirty south
Nigga, bounce

How many my niggas that would row with me (come on let's ride)
Where my bitches that would lie for me (come on let's ride)

(Lord what you want from me) hope it ain't my time for the glen to reap
(Niggas be killin' me) turn around, look at them eye-to-eye
Gun 'em down

Unless your desire leads you to touch the dream
I be in back of the back, A.G. on the jeans
Hit the button to the left and you can see how it leans
This thang is like an airplane you park in the street
Mean, it's so vicious call me young, all the wishes
Cause I wished for it all, beg the lord for forgiveness
Cause I sin I'ma sinner, but I win I'ma winner
I'm runnin' the marathon and y'all niggas are sprinters
I exercise more mental and massage my fingers
I'm lookin' forward to bangin' out start to finish
Give me a minute let me explain why most niggas is timid
They runnin' round with good bodies and no hearts in 'em
Makin' it easy fo' a nigga to get 'em- expose em'
Witness Rule the chosen, man who spit it the coldest
Load up this ten shot, till y'all niggas the hole-est

Many has tried but y'all can't kill us
We still livin' this real vivid, we kill killers

The world is blind so now I gotta spit it in braille
That raw coked up flow you can put in the scales
So when niggas start dyin' can't nobody tell
It's jus an overdose injection of that braille
Rule, when I come thru' can't nobody move me
I'm exclusive cop some new shit every Tuesday
Excuse me- bitch, I'm one of a kind
When I die study my mind and dupe' the design
Now I'm inclined, people say that I'm ahead of my time
Whoever said that they musta had they nose on the line
I'm not even in my prime yet, a veteran in this muthafuckin' rap shit
What religion you practice, a pristical baptist or catholic
I can't really say I'm religious- and to that I'ma witness
But I'm spiritual that's why I keep the Lord in the picture
40. Cal in the 7-40 I laugh at niggas
That wanna' get buried in cemeteries next to they bitches
And get thrown wit' bricks tied to they Lebron's
The game we play is chess- them niggas is pawns
You the first pieces we take off the board, because I'ma king that's from Queens
And then it's the whole regime, betta known as the team
Big shout to my nigga Preme
It ain't nothin' illegal about keepin' ya' cash clean
When you sellin' millions of records, and send me some jeans
Muthafucka

Your game ain't nuthin' but smoke and mirrors (let 'em know)
Y'all clowns can't be serious (uh-huh)
Many has tried but y'all can't kill us
We still livin' this real vivid, we real niggas (nigga)
Your game ain't nuthin' but smoke an' mirrors (uh-huh)
We ain't neva scared I hope all y'all hear us
Many has tried but y'all can't kill us
We still livin' this real vivid, we kill killers

Bout My Business,R.U.L.E.,2004,"Yeah..
Yeah, yeah, yo
I got a knack for pushin crack, and cookin raw coke
Fresh off the boat, no vest but I tote, and wear it like a coat
I'm starin through the scope, with one eye open and one shut
Zero in on the target, spark him and watch his head bust
Ain't shit to discuss, unless it's moneybags
Or the SK-8, drop Jag with funny tags
Homey laugh now but die later when the lead dump
And double barrel slugs like Elmer Fudd, I'm handsome

Some of your favorite rappers is flamin, I'm bangin things at them
They claim they gangster, lettin mens give brains to them
I aim the stainless, let the games begin
Bang bang dangerous, my gun gang famous
My hoes don't speak english, catch 'em at the foreign money exchange
New Armani leather in the Range
When you see my gang, tuck in your chain
We stuck in the game, we fuckin the same, bang!

 I'm bout my money and bout my business (bang!)
 Shout out my niggas en route to riches (bang!)
 I doubt we different, hustlers pitchin (bang!)
 And we all gon' get away, all my niggas say
 I'm bout my money and bout my business (yeah!)
 Whatta, bout my bitches who mouth is ridiculous (yeah!)
 Gettin money and nigga it's insignificant (yeah! what?)
 Always get your pay, I love it when I hear 'em say

It's back to business, stackin riches
If you, act suspicious, it's a Wrap like Reynolds
Black Continental, mac outta the window
Black's out of his mental, I black out with pistols
It ain't confidential, all the shit I been through
Now I'm gettin money and a mill' is essential
Bang bang, nigga, 'til the day we die
A tooth for a tooth and a eye for a eye

Nigga you know it's, business befo' pleasure, money over chicks
Dummies in the clip, nickel on my hip patrollin through the strip
Bet a stack, head crack, no rollin to the six
Scoop up my chips, then I split, with my beautiful bitch
Like Jada Pinkett Smith, for that paper I leave stinkin and stiff
Your pinky and wrist, and your necklace
Get removed nigga, my wolves is playin hardball
Leavin him bloody like a Pelican Bay yard brawl


Who wanna know why I got so much beef with so many rappers?
Drama, it's the INC redrum spun backwards
Karma, is a muh'fucker watch your actions
Cause the clip to the max slips in bananas
I catch fire like matches {*whew*} then blow out
And the flyest crews goin the fastest
Pull up to the hottest club in New York, with my hazards on
No tags, I just drove it off the showroom floor
Straight cash, bout my paper, I'm on my gangster
Doin this shit for ten years, niggas I'm major
Maybach and all that, same behaviour
Money over bitches, bitches over strangers
Guns befo' bangers but bangers do
For niggas that had enough and ain't got no clue
That they can get slayed, flex and get sprayed
And spin they head like yo' hottest DJ's, motherfuckers!

 I'm bout my money and bout my business..",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-bout-my-business-lyrics
Exodus,Exodus,UnKnown,"In case you don’t know the call me Loc
Short for L-O-K-I
I’mma speak for rule saying his last goodbyes
This is Exodus
This been a hell of a ride
From Venni Vetti Vicci to Blood In His Eye
In the next plan in time I just seen the rock split
And the rider's had about as rough as a ride gets
And you know that they all want to murder The Inc
But they can’t kill us, so now we got to finish these niggas
And if finish it means murder (murder murder murder) so be it like you in the soviet
Nah I'm the man with his gun
Last that I recall
They tried to mirror the God, mimic the style
Then leave them in memory of
With his fondest of memories lost, a new identeny was born
And na this ain’t a movie dog
This is murder (murder murder murder)
In the executive form
Yo Gotti I make the hits, you just give me the nod
But the air play the gun
Play from New York to L.A
The S.K's will make these niggas spin like perelaes
We had some good years but I’m tired
And yall niggas expired
And trying to put the douse to the fire
It’s like an episode of The Wire
The only difference is video tapin' us in real life
Now everybody wanna look at us and think twice
And point there fucking fingers like damn they're the bad guys

Y’all niggas don’t know we them niggas man murder INC we done been through it all done n seen it all
There ain’t nothing you can tell me nigga haha
I just wanna let ya'll know man I’ve been through so many things

And if it wasn’t for the way I live life
Would a nigga pray every night to Christ?
Jesus I was just asking
Cause my prayers seem to never get answered
But mama didn’t raise no bastard
I was born with the talent
You can’t touch I call it magic
You call it music once it gets remasterd
I got with Gotti, he started making classics
It’s MURDER
It’s been a course of traffic
Trust was my only nigga's force of habit
At the time in the game everything was average
Pac had just died
Big had just died
And my nigga had a plan to keep Def Jam alive
First he sign D
Then he sign me
Then he introduced Jay
And the rest is history
Thanks for the memories
Thanks for the misery
Reminiscing the Spike Lee them was the school days
We graduated with A's
But these niggas make you wanna bring out the AR's and AK's
And till they back up cause that what they gave us
When they read our indictments and various pappers
But no harm no foul them niggas is funny style anyway
Now we go hard to the edge

That’s a good question though, See I don't understand why they would think what they thinking about its just not the case tho I love my niggas that's all
'im guilty of and that all that I ever was guilty of is the love for my niggas its all good tho I ain't streesing that shit man sometimes God has to put you
Through things that bring out the best very in who you are nigga Sam said it to me, he said sometimes greatness is not what you accomplish its wot you

Only Begotten Son,Venni Vetti Vecci,1999.0,"He who believeth in Ja
Shall not be condemned
But he that believeth not
Is condemned already
Only because
He has not believed
In the man and the only begotten son
My Lord

For he so feared the word
He left his only begotten son
To shed his blood
Show that pain is love
But I won't cry
'Cause I live to die
With my mind on my money
And my guns in the sky
For he so feared the word
He left his only begotten son
To shed his blood
Show that pain is love
But I won't cry
'Cause I live to die
With my mind on my money
And my guns in the sky

Yeah, why would you leave somethin' you love here to die
In the cold
And it grows
Like a concrete rose
Beautiful ain't I?
'Til I withered and died
In them same streets you left me in
Screamin' Lord let me in
I don't know where to begin
Since I lost yo love
But then again your love
Was strictly for the drugs
I don't know whether to hug
Or to fill you with slugs
Fuckin' them whores
Instead of claiming what's rightfully yours
Pierced a hole in my heart from all the pain you caused
With no direction you left your first born lost
Give or take a few
Cause my hate for you
Grew, over the years
Through blood, sweat, and tears
I wanted to be just like you
My father figure, now I want to fight you
You bitch nigga, left me 'lone
And parts of me never outgrown
The fact that you left home
But moms was so strong
Don't let them get you fed
This world is yours she said
Now nothin' is stoppin' me but two to the head
In life there's more to come when it's all said and done
You lost one love, your only begotten son

For he so feared the word
He left his only begotten son
To shed his blood
Show that pain is love
But I won't cry

Show that pain is love
But I won't cry
'Cause I live to die
With my mind on my money
And my guns in the sky

Broke wit nothin to live for
And damn ready to die young
I'm the shadow behind the gun
Look at what I've become
The fear of many niggas
The floss of most bitches
The love that runs deepest
In the hearts of street niggas
Raised in the ghetto
By the ghetto
Was taught young to pop the metal
That's how shit get settled
Learn to cook up the coke
Never leave home without toast
Learn to fly my bitches with birds, in first not coach
Never trust ya, from a toddler to hustla
I was trained as a youngsta, to cock back and slug ya
Love me or hate me, ya only son
Let me live or kill me, the chosen one
Ja, under the gun, gotta kill 'em fo' sho'
If you want it you gonna get more then you askin' for
Life's got more to come, but when it's all said and done
You lost one love, your only begotten son

For he so feared the word
He left his only begotten son
To shed his blood
Show that pain is love
But I won't cry
'Cause I live to die
With my mind on my money
And my guns in the sky
For he so feared the word
He left his only begotten son
To shed his blood
Show that pain is love
But I won't cry
'Cause I live to die
With my mind on my money
And my guns in the sky

I wanted to be forever yours
Look it now we're nothin' more than two lost souls
Lookin to meet at the crossroads
I burn the hydro, lay back with my eyes closed
In deep thought like Brittany is somethin' I'd die for
How the fuck do you sleep at night?
Knowin' you wronged the only thing you ever did right
Despite the loss I stretch the length of a short
Now I got a new father whose name is New York
Runnin' wild in the streets
With heat, we don't talk
Cause when its cold you basically live life in dark
But light will shine from the heavens and bless one
Ja Rule; love, your only begotten son

For he so feared the word
He left his only begotten son
To shed his blood
Show that pain is love
But I won't cry

You know we would kidnap your kids
You know what the fuck we do
Murder bitch niggas like you
For real, all the time, any place, anywhere
Y'all niggas could get it
Act like y'all don't know

In a world that's ice cold, Blacks die slowly
Cats snatch rollies, gats'll leave you holy
My momma always told me: the streets will slow me down
Daddy never showed me how heat will hold me down
So now I rob and steal, spit shit you feel
With a clique that kills, yeah my shit's that real
I hustle hard all my life, ran the streets all night
My wife always said everything was gonna be alright
And she was right, and that's one reason why I love her
But everything she said went in one ear and out the other
Word to mother, look at it from a thug point of view
When the kids need clothes, what a thug gonna do?
Hit the streets and hustle, pick up the heat and bust you
I'm tryin' to eat like Russell, murder is my hustle
But you keep chasin' yesterday, you gonna miss tomorrow
It's murder motherfucker we don't beg or borrow
We take shit, fuck you and your fake bitch, when the .8 spit
You could feel the hatred, taste it
You high right now, you ain't ready to die right now
The .45 will calm you down, you under trauma now
It's drama how a child will shut shit down
Kill a nigga for the fuck of it, I'll get you touched for chips
Fuck that shit, and fuck your whips, fuck you bitch
You can just suck my dick

If you chasin' yesterday, you gon miss tomorrow

We take shit, fuck you and your fake bitch
When the .8 spit you could feel the hatred, taste it
It's your blood, when we show blood, we murderers (murderers)
We throw slugs, we hustlers (hustlers) we sell drugs
And tell thugs live it up till yo time's up

Yo I give a fuck if y'all niggas hate me
I drop bodies off where the lakes be
But lately, I've been hittin' cribs
And safes where the cake be
I take three to the vest for the love of the dollar
I put that hot shit thru you and watch you Holla Holla
The same niggas that I ball wit I'mma brawl wit
I'm a tank running in banks and takin' all of it
Player we're flawless, wit' nothin' to lose
Guns bustin & bruisin' niggas, y'all can't live
Funny shit about it, niggers wanna hit me, forget about it
Thug shit I'm still livin' y'all niggas just spit about it
I rob and stomp niggas 2/3rd of my life
The other 1/3 spent sittin' on curbz chasin' those birdz
If you ever get the urge to come by and try to test
There's only one and then you get numb and lied to rest
It's murder the only code to the ghetto
It's murder, nigga hand me the bezel
Or dance with the devil, guns rapidly spit
Gangsta shit, attractin' yo bitch, gettin' head and lean back in the 6
I mastered the chips, Nigga I'm tryin' to tell you
You're holdin' hammers and nail you
We have you where the dogs couldn't smell you

If you chasin' yesterday, you gonna miss tomorrow
It's murder motherfucker, we don't beg or borrow
We take shit, fuck you and yo fake bitch
When the .8 spit you could feel the hatred, taste it

We throw slugs, we hustlers (hustlers) we sell drugs

Any nigga think not, I'ma pop him
Put the lean on niggas the minute I spot em
Who's gettin' it, I got him, nigga dead and gone
Gonna guide 'em to the crossroads show em how those gunz blow
I'ma degenerate nigga addicted to hydro, switchin' four lanes
Top down with my eyes closed, got a death wish
Money, drugs, and murderer shit
What you want with this? We'll kidnap yo kids
And clap up yo crib, It's the murderers

Just because we're them hot niggerz
Sell more records than Roc niggas
I'ma lock it down for 6 months and shock niggas

Money ain't never been nothing
I hit the block if this shit get ugly
And it ain't never been in my heart to let niggas thug me
Hit the dealer and cop a drop if the eyes is buggy
And pull up in front of the spot cause the mommies love me
(It's gangsta) yeah and ain't no nigga gone match me
Stocky, chubby nigga voice real raspy
I see you real flashy ""but that ain't gone last nigga""
Pop fire off shots ""and that's your ass nigga""
It's war now that's why I keep the four with long nozzle
Six-hundred bad bitch on it holding down the throttle
And fuck that beef shit cause some beef won't die
And some niggas will say they gangsta but they won't ride
And while it's hard for you to decide I'll let it fly
Forty shots hit your ride up hit the tropics and hide up
Under palm tree's to white sand
Everything is a price man
You snipe when bullets are piping hot
When it's your flesh it begin warming you
Now die motherfucker die
'Cause I'm tired of warning you

Yeah we hear now, die motherfucker
Don't get scared now, die motherfucker
Black Child I'm off parole it's murda now
In a hood near you about to burn it down
Word to God it feels like I'm from every hood
'Cause when you ghetto your ghetto with gats you good
Sell cracks if you could bust your gat when you should
It's for my blacks from the bricks back to Inglewood
We eat together nigga fuck the crossroads
In this world my flow is another lost soul
My shit sounds like shots from a four pound
For these bitch clowns it's war now
It's all about paper that's my issue
Fuck peace you can have a piece of the pistol

Everybody gonna die but nobody want dead
Die motherfucker die, it's your life
Everybody wanna live, but they wanna live scared
Die motherfucker, die, that's your life
Everybody gonna die but nobody want dead
Die motherfucker die, it's your life
Everybody wanna live, but they wanna live scared
Die motherfucker, die, that's your life

Niggas know the truth
Rule raises the roof
'Cause I pop more shots than Abdul-Rauf
And when the concludes I bring closure to the situ
Come through, squeeze eight out the stolen black Pinto
Niggas know my mental kill or be killed head for the hills
But don't never slide down it if you to high ground it (puff, puff)
Uhhh! Is how it sounded two shots thru and silent
And one nigga stripped of his talents
New fucking Yiddy City the sex and violence
Where first time offenders get floated to the island
And one time give a nigga one time
Breathe wrong and a nigga have a blown mind
I blow lines like an addict
Bust guns erratic shine blind like carats
Rules above average me and this music make a marriage
So I thee wed 'til I'm either jailed or dead motherfuckers
Feel me niggas

Word to God
Feel us nigga
We here, again
It's Murda

Everybody gonna die but nobody want dead

It's a problem (a problem), it's a problem (a problem)
Always has been, hahaha... ayo Buck...
Turn me up a lil' bit in my motherfuckin' headphones and shit
C'mon, and let these niggas know (niggas know)
Let 'em know...

Muh'fuckas y'all want war with the God, c'mon, y'all know better
I put holes in ya leather, reknit your sweater
And I bet the flow's wetter than ocean front property
Better come at me properly
Niggas better off poppin' me, but I believe
Y'all scared to clap them hammers
And the fact that I'm unpredictable, gives me the advantage
What the fuck, am I'm speakin' Spanish, niggas?
What I got to tell y'all in detail how we murder niggas
Handle ya business
The Inc. is religious, Murder's the sacrifice
We throwin' M's niggas, that means Murder for life
And I'll die for that red and black
That house with the cheddar stack and the smiles on my kids faces
What could replace this?
This lil' nigga here done come to grips with death to taste it
My air's thick and filled with hatred
Surprise of that look in my eyes, but don't be
I'm just following the footsteps the Lord done pave me
If I go crazily insane
I'ma blame it on the world, look what I became
'Cause they give me all the fame and the money mayne
Made me an icon
So the world can catch a nigga with his lights on
That's the pros and cons, ya never quite free
But just gimme a lil' room so I can breathe
And my pain gon' be the death of me
But to be loved is my destiny, my black people...

You thought I wouldn't recognize ho like stats
I peep you at the strip joint
You and that little black chick
Acting like you so innocent
When you in the six
Usually that bring the freak right out of a bitch
I knew something was wrong
Lesbian I go on
Ain't nothing wrong with bump n' grinding right
I like mines tight
You like yours licked
And we both like bitches to get high high wit
You opted to leave a nigga with no options
You freak ho dance topless baby
What's ya sitcho
You ride dildo
Plastic nympho
Only see dick in porno
Hun lidten
I can make your life a world of difference
Throw me in the mix of your sexual experiences
See what happens
In like two weeks
These hoes is freaking
Making about two g's a piece a weekend
That's what I'm saying

Matching sets his and hers
Keep ya hoes on point
Tell them watch the fuzz

Got a hot little co-op
Prestigous
Rock a cuban link with Jesus
Lord have mercy
Let me touch this
Tease it
For reasons

Cause you know my actions are censored
Don't diss chips to fuck with no broad

I pimp plenty women
Got to tip my hat to a ten
Just been in too many run ins with dead ends
Comparisions range from thick ones to thin
Explosive sex thoughts coming from this young work horse
I spend hard times like D.A.'s in criminal courts
Fro the love of my life I'll cut down on the sport
For the jewels with ice and creep to never get caught
You know the game
You and I is one in the same
But you got my name
Tatooed on ya leg
Shit is serious
Now you caling me acting delirious
Used to be my best bitch
Now somewhat resistant
Street life got you hot like Heather Hunter
Worn out and don't nobody want ya
First time i met ya you played me out of pocket
I ain't know no better bitch
Now stop it
Game is the topic
And what's between your legs is the product
Use it properly
And you'll make dollars biatch

And I thank you for all the food you've given me

Cuz I'm runnin these streets under they say
Motherfuckers like you can't relate
Cuz you ain't all about the hustling all about the bustin
All about the thuggin, baby
Never let it go
If you gotta die, lie, shake it wit a fo'-fo'
Then do so, cuz that's the life you chose
Shoul've fallowed the cracks in the road
You heart and your soul
Cuz if there's one thing I know
Good niggas come and they go
Bitch niggas actin like ho's, merely needed to get treated like one
Hope you got yourself a gun niggas

I'm tryna get my life together
Shit a nigga can't ride forever
Tryna see a hundred mil' or better

Don't ask me why, I
Got a fasination wit for freak ho's
New whips wit two seats and two do's
I've been waitin so long to explode
Now watch me cock back and unload
Bullets goin threw the chest and out the back

Why the fuck would they want to see me live?
So I'm gearin up to get into some shit
Niggas better kiss the wife and kids
It's just the way us niggas live
And I run wit real niggas that run wit big guns
That are designed to pop ya lid (Shit)
Never met a real nigga I didn't like
Never met a bitch nigga that I didn't fight
Now niggas gon get down, and a nigga gon lay down
Dependin on how niggas view life
And you'll never look in my eyes
And you'll never, ever smile
Cuz your high, is comin down
And you can't touch me
But if you really wanna fuck wit me
C'mon and get your heat my niggas
Don't you ever prevoke my niggas

For the look on sunset sun-up on sunset

By the looks of me baby I'm holding
And I ain't telling if you ain't knowing, I'm a don

To get high on whatever your heart desires

West siders throw it up, my niggas its all love
I'm calling out every Crip and Blood in LA
Essa's hit the strip on dubs
Let's hit the club, my bitches start stripping for dubs
Mami wassup, Lambo doors up
When they see me they show me love
Honk the horn, pull over and roll up
The chronic and blow dubs
Better hope it ain't no gun-play
Cause sunset Friday is Crenshaw Sundays
And I love LA like Snoop love the six-tre
Where would I be without Dre? To Live and Die in LA
All we know is low riders and sex
And what happens on sunset, stays on sunset
Got the whole strip throwing up dubs
And since Pac died, it ain't been no California Love

California!

Race Against Time Part. 2,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah, yeah, uh huh
Race against time, ha part two
You know, haha
Uh, c'mon
Yeah, yeah, yeah, haha
Nothin like the future

Guess who's back to personify money, power, and bitches
But when bitches been gettin money, that when shit get ridiculous
I'm hittin switches like six fo's, bouncin and leanin
The west coast seemin, keep the fo' fo' demon
And the rock is all stashed up
Roll up a little diesel, keep it hashed up
Then +Holla, Holla+ at the whores, is hollerin back
Let 'em know a few facts like if your ridin, your back's slidin
This is the 'Race Against Time' and I ain't got time to waste
To give chase, I put a hole in your fin
But your head to the barrel like dj's is spinnin
Backward, to blow off the backwood, I'm so hood
But what's really hood, when you ain't doin your hood
No motherfuckin good, and bein misunderstood
I would die if I could, Rule the lion
And I'ma keep ""ri-da-da-da-da-in""

Race against time, I - can't stop
Runnin through the red light - livin my life
Even if I'm gettin too hot
Still I can't stop - ""Ri-da-da-da-din""

Bless the day that the God was born two, twenty-nine, seventy-six
This cocaine was heavily mixed
And all them niggas had a fixation for bad reputation
For pimpin hoes, and shootin for, to bring the free basin
If this is time erasin, the devil is runnin like Bettis
And got his guns out lookin for ways to behead us
You can die in a matter of seconds, so I'ma slow it down
Turn back the hands of time with the 40 Cal
Claimin your style is the realest, so I'ma define the meanin of murder, it's killer
You outta your mind, the burner's designed for the fill up
No gas, and when I spits like acid
Smoke weed, but blow ether, spit ashes
Cause young Rule in his prime like 'Clay Cassius'
Hated by the masses, but overwhelmed with love and passion
For when I die niggas keep ""Ri-da-da-da-din""


If Jesus Christ was criticized, then why not me
What the fuck am I special, I struck a deal with the devil
Haha, every kid a prophet, which one seem like it's logic
Me in church, or me in bed with bitches managen
I can chase like sergeant, addictive like heroin
Outsiders just lookin in, through a barrel that's pinned to the peep hole
They seein all or nothin like Jazz from Clisco
Hit 'em up and let's go, jump over the threshold
I just got married to bangin pistol, drugs and other shit
Fell in love with a bitch that I call crime
She reminded me that nobody can beat time
If you get enough of it nigga
So I looked her dead in her eyes and pulled the trigger
Thinkin that the music we feel would be somethin different
But this the same old criminal vibin
I ain't hidin, I'ma keep ""Ri-da-da-da-din""",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-race-against-time-part-2-lyrics

The world will rule you
When you play by the rules of the divine
You will rule the world
Bring it back
(I’m falling, I’m falling, with no parachute
I’m falling, I'm falling, with no parachute)

All the way from Heaven to the stars
The stars pass along
The moon turns to sky
The sky turns to you
I’m falling, I’m falling, with no parachute
I’m falling, I'm falling, with no parachute

All the way form the heaven to the stars, to the moon, to your heart
I only fell to get up for you
My world anew, I put that on the cross
Give thanks to the Lord, the legend of the fall
Fuck you, no pause, niggas, make God bless us all
And then bless the dead as they bodies descend
From the ledge, to the roof, to the head, to the floor
Then watch demons hover over they corpse
It’s a long fall and a lot of niggas fall short
Unfortunately, a lot of niggas fall off
But not me, I could never see the ball drop
Unless it's New Year's in the heart of New York
If you’re new kid, the block get a little rough
Especially if the heart ain’t wide enough
Cause I've been through it all and I seen even more
Only the flyest of niggas get to fall


If I gave the devil a hug, I gave the Lord a kiss
From the Heavens above to the fire to my ashes
Nobody surpasses death, it don't last
It's all a legend, get Christ-like, come back, resurrection
Teflon - no use, can't kill me
I've already been dead, I'm a holy spirit
Watch my soul flow fly around like a G6
While my body stage dives in the audience
I’m living this, life limitless
If it ain’t fly, hash: no relevance
If it ain’t domestic, it’s not intelligent
You should be smart and don't jump off the deep end
The dark side, it's a long ride
Paint a portrait of the world and y'all dodge
Cause I've been through it all and I seen even more
Only the flyest of niggas get to fall

Are you a figment of my imagination?
Or am I one of yours?

Believe me baby, and hear me, fear me, feel me

True in the head but nigga not
As soon as I get the drop
I pull up the pop of the test
It's outta the prairie
Bitches style juice running through my head
How many wanna die nigga?
My concept It's irrational
My thinking now
I'm erratic like Mike W's whose falling down
I'm losin' sight now I can hardly see
And smoking all this fucking weed
I can barely breathe
I'm like tell a bitch bleed

Run up in the deli
Wrung up on D

Keep watching me

Are ya watching me?

Whose watching me?

C'mon watch as I creep through your block
In the hard top drop
With my bead on knock
Cause cops I ain't standing
And gangstas know
Catching before hanging
And my dogs keep banging
Cause ain't shit changing
And hustlers y'all keep slanging
We stuck in the game
Wit not a lot to gain
But everything to lose
But we soldiers that front-line
In days to rule
We do homicide drive-by's
Cock and spray
If you the last man standing
You about to lay
6 feet underground
Watch me now
Stop me how?
Y'all niggas trying to cop my style
I spit nothing but hot ones
And pop guns
Make it hard for niggas to function
Who want some of the Rule baby? (None of ya'll)
I'm legally considered crazy
But if that's the way that God made me
This world can't change me
And that's the way it'll be
Caught in the dark
Until the light shines on me
I'm a slave to this game
But I'm breakin' free

Houston to mother fuckin' LA, we connect nigga

Mother fuckers, you frontin' we comin' with heat niggas
AR-15s we sweepin' up the street bigger
Guns make niggas run, we squeeze triggers
We leave niggas dead for the stacks, slumped over, head in they lap

Yo, we constantly count cream in the crackhouse
Basically, we bangin' bitches backs out

Throwin' bricks at a glasshouse
Poppin' and puffin' till I pass out

This gangsta shit is for all my youngens who flip birds
And hug the block, in club they Cris and twist the bud, nigga what
We live it up, from Chi-town to my town
We diggin sluts, long dickin' in the guts

We just religious thugs, gangsta pimps
Hoes fall in love the way we throw this dick
The Hummers on dubs look like tanks and shit
We came to stop the bank, don't blink be sick

Nigga all of our love is for the chips
And I don't chase hoes, just pasos and bricks
Nigga let me sum it up
Y'all niggas is dumb enough
Run on up, the guns we tuck, bust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

Then bitch smack niggas
Give me the crack nigga or get clap nigga

I'm a big gat spitter
Bangin' and slangin' to be a rich ass nigga
Don't get tired in these streets
My nigga died in these streets

My peeps out here so I ride with these streets
Spent weeks out here, grind on these streets
I know the deal out here
It's real out here
Got bitch bud murder and I'm still out here
Rockland, Murder INC. you get killed out here
Chi-town, New York, blood spill out here
And thugs like me, still out here

Black Cadillac truck nigga, loaded with nines
To my thugs on the block, holdin' it down
I got love on the block, look at my eyes
Rockland, Murder INC. what the fuck you think
Me and Gotti whole plan is to cover the streets
We don't wanna body you man, fuck the beef
We sell a lot of these grams, and clutch the heat
To many moves to be made, fake thug niggas
Get a few through they brain, I been plug nigga

Cats like me play not to lose in this game
You see this little nigga makin' moves in the Range
I see you wack niggas still crusin' with lames
Get full nigga cause it's food to the brain
Rockland nigga spit fire and flames
Get it right nigga, we gangsta

Murder INC. gets poppin' pills, clips, however you like it
Niggas get extorted, bitches get excited
Known to start riots, the Rule and I-N-C
Got fedaraleighs watchin' me, the Y-G and I-G
Put it together family orientated through guns, drugs, and good relations
Real conversations, we call it real talk
And that shit spreads all the way from LA to New York
And I love talk, that's when you get to smash on niggas
Catch 'em in the dark spot and put the flash on niggas

Once you feeling the slugs hit

Then you wonder
Why da quake can come from underneath, while you figure it out
You on da streets
Laid out wit da gun still stuck in yo mouth
Fuckin' wit Ja is somethin' niggas fearfully doubt
'Cause I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, god may I ask from yo prayer so my soul don't die
These is real tears I cried
And dreams don't lie
When they tell me that I'm doin' good in da devils eyes
But I preach to I'm
Be that same, Nigga put da heat to I'm
Askin E Dub what da fuck you want do to I'm

E-Dub and Ja
An eye for an eye, Gat for Gat
Peep Game, Cover the Mic and Spit Flamez
Two cats who come strapped, self-contained
Ain't shit this raw since Big Daddy Kane

Represent,Black Gangster - Original Soundtrack,UnKnown,"I represent Gangsta Shit
Niggas that spent time on the brick for keys on the strip
Loadin my clips, givin ass niggas the shits
Life's a bitch, gotta murda to get rich
And infamous, that's when the game gets deep
Gotta re-up, cop heat and hit the streets
Now the feds is buggin me, D.T. straight fucking me
The whole operation shook, bitches ain't loving me
No more, see, I gotta make a switch
Should I lay low or run wild and stick shit
Ran up a team, that's striclty dedicated to cream
It's time to go outta town and wash niggas clean
For everything they got, leave nothing to spare
But the shells on the ground when that ass is shot
And once again it's hot, but this time there's a snitch
Thought he was dead when he got hit in state Mich
Turn states to evidence, we on the run
Reprisentin all illegal drugs and guns

Where all my gangsta niggas at?
Supply the town with coke and Hen(Hennesey) and cuban contacts
We keep them coming back, plus the one's that copped crack
Raw cut, overdose off the feedback, alone
Intoxicated from the Cognac, charge that Al Capone suite to Ammex
Valley to Lex, that black hand is on deck
We rollin in, peelin notes off of G stacks, We Murderaz

This fuckin life's got me feeling like a lefty
It's aight, I'll go hard, make sure this world don't forget me
It's like my game's virtual, based on reality
I'm speeding like a bullet at high velocity
You think you stopping me, I think not
Ain't too many who known to do it properly
I'm likely to get so high like Tony be, toasted bein free
And trip out occasionaly, you know
Cause it ain't nothing for me to touch you
But for you to touch Ja, yet to been proved, I'm still breathing
Current age, those dopes wanna live, gotta get paid to do so
The average mind can't elevate and grow, calculate the dough
Analyze and invest where it's profitable, marketable
Billboards hot shot debut
Ja Rule Unstopable

Where all my gangsta niggas at?
Supply the town with coke and Hen(Hennesey) and cuban contacts
We keep them coming back, plus the one's that copped crack
Raw cut, overdose off the feedback, alone
Intoxicated from the Cognac, charge that Al Capone suite to Ammex
Valley to Lex, that black hand is on deck
We rollin in, peelin notes off of G stacks, We Murderaz

Fear, that is my logic, the suit's made a composite sketch of this object
Blazing throught the projects, E.S. Lex coach edit, new shit
Got a nice connect, 12, five the brick, Heading o.t
With this chick who like to slay, drink baby, snort coke and weed
Half Trinidadian and Vietnamese
She made a habit of calling a nigga daddy
Would die for me gladly, feloniously, I taught her well
Took her heavenly body and showed it hell
I made a lot of dought with her, she was my top nigga
Knew the rules to the game but painted her own picture
She wanted everything black and white
Never paying attention to the gray areas in life
Stayed up half the night, wondering is my dough all right
Is she high on the job, or maybe she's getting robbed
Quick picked up the mac milli, ready to get involved
Cause my .44 revolves around this
Fucking with Black Gang, all you get is hot lead
Muthafuckaz, cause you know that shit

Where all my gangsta niggas at?
Supply the town with coke and Hen(Hennesey) and cuban contacts
We keep them coming back, plus the one's that copped crack

Thug Life,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Ja Rule, yeah
Irv Gotti, uh, huh
Big Rob, haha
It's how we do it
Yeah, it's my life

What's the matter with your life?

Everything from the evils to price, from the guns to mic
I'm livin' my life runnin' through hell with no wife
It's a sin, but I tell my lost soul to win
Go to bed and die, then wake up breathin' again
Cuz I'm all in even though shit ain't right
I wake up, sweating my life every night
Tell me, is you the devil that gon' get me?
Or is God don't feel like bein' bothered with?
So hard to hit me, but this life I sacrifice
Fuck chrome lines in the dark, my daughter gon' see the light
If I die young it's cuz a nigga too high strung
Got a scary love for guns but too much weed in my lungs
Still niggas screamin' Ja's the one
Chosen like God's only begotten son
It's my life

Thug life, everybody needs a friend
Thug life, we all got a space to fill
Thug life, everybody wanna be on top
Life, it ain't that funky
Yes he's got that dropping
Tell me, what's the matter with your bitch?

Baby, I don't respect shit, with diamonds and live reckless
Pushing the six, top speed, getting my dick licked
I'm childish, one of a kind, one of my own
I'm about to take these freak hoes to levels unknown
Touch a little, later on, fuck a little
The more resist the better, I'm in it for whatever
Feel me, I don't need weed to get high
Some good head make a nigga kiss the sky
No lie, but if she ain't right, turn the lights off
Put her on her stomach and fuck her 'til ya dick soft
The rules to the streets, love
I met you kinda drunk with a light buzz
I respect it cuz niggas ain't shit, you right
Cuz every bitch need a lil' dick in they life
I betcha

Thug life, everybody needs a friend
Thug life, we all got a space to fill
Thug life, everybody wanna be on top
Life, it ain't that funky
Yes he's got that dropping
Tell me, what's he puttin' in your nose?

Nigga, ain't nuttin' goin' in these nostrils
But I'll tell y'all about how we gettin it now
40-inch screens nigga, rocks gleam, nigga
You a customer, and I love a fiend, nigga
Cuz just like the coke, cook up and come back
I load up the gat, tell niggas to hold hat
Help me, what I do is a stick of genius
I study the eyes of niggas who done seen this
Learn to lean on the mean, yeah
Coverin' my ground, paying attention to the cracks in the cement
It's on now cuz I got my vision together
What y'all thought? I was gon crawl blind forever?
It's now or never, corrupt thoughts 'til I die
When you talk to me, motherfucker, please look in my eyes
See my life",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-thug-life-lyrics

When I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together

I life I love my wife
But bad times prevail, it overwhelmed me
I'm livin in hell but livin wealthy
And know these hoes love me
Because I'm a star
I can't even cop a drink at the bar
Give me some bottles of that Remi Mar-tin
Let's get the party
Cracking right here fuck V.I.P
Now when my baby loves me
Home wit tears in her eyes
And when I get in, I hurt her more by tellin her lies
She ain't surprised at me
Just surprised that we
Been together for this long
And I can be
The one to mistreat her
Thought it last forever
Cuz if I cry, you cry
We cry together


From, what I recall we was little niggas
Cuttin school, gettin high, wit the hottest bitches
Livin, life so free
That we ain't fearin
The, ills of the world
In heat of drug dealin
You and I then made a killin
And stuck together
In this land of forbidden treasures
Love is the only evil seed that could sever
A tie this close
Not the love between us but your love for the dough
You went O.T. and started makin M-O-N-E-Why
All my good niggas gotta die
Wish it could last forever
I wish death was pleasure
Cuz when you died
I cried, we cried together


Wash away your tears (my love)
You ain't gotta cry no more (my love)
I'm putting on everything that (I love)
And my pain it's my love
And I want
This world to smile for me
Don't shed a tear cuz the nigga died happily
My momma warned me life was a muthafucka
But I ignored the warning and kept on hustlin
And every night she'd just look at me
Wit tears in her eyes and then be saying shit like
""I don't want my baby to die""
Brought so much pain into a life
Gotta make it better
Cuz when ma cried I cried
We cried together


Oooooohhhh
You cry, then I cry
Then we cry
When he cries
I cry together, together
When I cry, then you cry
Then we'll cry, together
Baby, cuz when
Ja cries, Mo cries
We'll cry, together
If he cry, I'll cry
Then we'll cry, together",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-cry-feat-lil-mo-lyrics

Yo the hammer and the muzzle came together
All I had did was hold on to the pieces untill the puzzle came together
Before it all got hyped
I was in the corridor
Apple before it got riped
So I ain't gotta act like
I'm on top of, or in front of them
If I ain't the best dog then I'm one of them
Listenn I'm a different kind of boss
I'm Cut from a different kind of cloth
These niggas is different kind of soft
Everybody know it all
Nobody follow a protocal
The money's only good until you blow it all
Stacking every cents
Guliani knocked John Gotti, What?
So now he's running for president
It's a shame what the game's became
But the truth is
There's really nobody to blame
But the music
Lets give it a minute
Wtih no wack gimmicks
Just hard beats and rhymes
Blow breath back in it

One's for the trouble
Two's for the show
Three's for the base and that limelight glow
I know, you thinking that this game is over
Oh no, the wait is over

Mutha f**ka i'm the heart and sole of this
You claim king, but we in control of this
Name another rapper you see on the streets
Huggin the block at the height of a beef
Yellow tape and white sheets
Yea that's my back drop whenever I speak
I know alotta y'all would love to ice me
Make my head jerk like I'm doing the hyphy
But that'll never happen, get on some sick shit
Like fifteen in you, and one in your infant
Joe's the business, Ask about me
In the middle of the desert
And they still can drought me
You know Coka baby he stay on that new york shit
You see weezy coming down on that forklift
And money ain't a thing, unless he come off with
Then Ima have to hit em with these little bricks often

New york, New York nigga never went no where
I just took off a couple of years
But Now I'm back on my day to day
Old school, Gucci frames like day to day
Who gone tell New york times up, Flava flav
Cuz as much as things change it remains the same
And you can gimme the city of God
And Mecca, the temple, the mas
An inspiration, the inception, The art..
Of Hip Hip was born
And the rap game was formed
From niggas dead broke, sell drugs, bear arms
Against all odds
And argue all day about who's a bigger star
Joe, Jada, or Ja
SO close but so far
So many there's no star
I can't belive Fifty Cent and NY fell off
And L.A. came back, and the south is running shit
Then one blood group, shit's all developing, NEW YORK

One's for the trouble
Two's for the show
Three's for the base and that limelight glow
I know, you thinking that this game is over
Oh no, the wait is over

Welcome to Emerica

Welcome to Emerica
(Don't hate me)Cuz I done made this world what it's done to me

Niggas, if I could pledge my allegiance to the, United Ghettoes
Of the Emerica, go on sell ya drugs
Cuttin taxes for strippers and thugs
It's all good, room for mayor in all hood and as well I should
I make it publicly desmist understood
When they caught me gettin high in the back of the ho-tel
Was you freakin them ho's?
Well, I just say I was gettin a lil head but so what
Bill and Hillery stay for them stills
That's a down ass bitch for ya
Wash em with some soap and water
And return them dirty bra's to their rightful owner
Now that's creep shit
One over one, I got this broad on the one-o-one
She's botherin, so don't even come up in here
Cuz shes contious, no nonsense
She like to choke on the dick, and the lungs on the constant
Gettin the W1's you church girl
Proda stant, it's aiight ma you rollin wit the Inc


Yeah I'm here can you tell?
Mo' niggas livin, livin in ??? in Emerica

Aimin to get this shit still
It ain't been a minute I ain't been high
And I haven't handled my buisness
How I been fuckin you bitches right
Yeah you witnesses my life
Imperial night, in the ghetto holdin my medal tight
Still, in Emerica
Remilitary is terror nigga holds his medal
Of his never be availible
That easy I'm a editor, restin up with the best of em
Minds of them bitches that stress givin em hard sex
I'm set for life, the lightin ho's that write
And hit the mic, not over night
You get the gift to be the best of something like
(Enough in Emerica) Young Life is comin home
Motherfuckers prepare to die


Niggas hit that crack houses hustlers and hoes
No youngins up on the corners nigga smokin them bones
I'm rattin away wit knots comin up, what's no pills?
That's why they'll find your ass slumped in the blacks of ville
But still, I spot that paper Jo, Blowin my weed
And ain't a thing a mother need is gotta be me
But now days these lil youngins rollin on E
And a nigga that supplyin that is who runs the streets
Now look, this ain't no crack day
I gotsa come up on the stash and get back man
Cuz I done witness all this shit that they say them ho's do
Fuckin wit X, like finger fuckin that hot Glock
While she swallow her tit
But real, there nigga want his dick sucked?
Bitches is why bitches turn that rehold into a intrick (It's pimp shit)
No limp dick, just a gangsta fuck
Why the murder put some major bust biatch

Believe,Pain Is Love 2,2012.0,"It was supposed to be you and I and the curtains closed
But somewhere along the lines we switched episodes
It's kinda like when Gina left Martin for New York
Speaking of New York, the city is so lost
Even with the Knicks looking to make the playoffs
Spike is back on the court, and Jeter's still with the Bronx
Bloomberg got the city ready for seance
Go get your ouija boards out, niggas, and pray on
You want drama? Get your fucking ? on
Still got the world on my shoulders, a nigga headstrong
About to go in, you can lock my body
Contract my mind, my thoughts keep escaping
Power of the pen, a work of art like Basquiat
I ? 'cept I paint my pictures lyrically, you fancy, huh
Bitch foamin like a Swiss B
And we ain't talkin' hoes, we talkin Euros and raw weed

Who do you believe in?
Is it money or the man upstairs? Is it power or prayer?
God bless the dead and fuck the world fast
What's progression if you never been through backlash?
Nigga, what do you believe in?
Cause my money's on me, myself, and I, my team, and this music
Y'all ain't gon' believe this
Maybe it's my fault, or maybe y'all just making excuses

Who do you believe in?
Motherfucker the money is talking to me and tellin me that it's lonely
In need of new friends, preferably Grants and Franklins
And the singles and the fives went to the bitches
Dubs is for wifing in the club, no mention
But you know who you are, nigga stop flinching
Stop cuffing; you may not think that it's a bitch
But life's a ho and everybody's been fucking
See, that's what I believe in
With no logic, no need for experience
To fuck the world would be a lifetime achievement
You make it cum then e'rybody jump on the dick
Y'all niggas full of shit, that's why you fuckin assholes
And never smell the shit stinking 'til you get shitted on
Fuck 'em all, not for nothing
I ain't always on time, too much ice in the vodka mo'fucker


Who do you believe in? Cause even the smartest
Of niggas got the gall and the balls to believe this
Rule back, renaissance nigga, that's the project
Up next, the pill, deuces, gon' swallow that
Matter of fact, swallow dick, bitch, get your fix on
Gased up niggas go and get it, gon' get it
Next on, the next episode, new time, new cats
News flash: nobody's exempt from the backlash
Backstabbing, bootlicking me, kissing ass
Niggas still stick to the system, God bless 'em
Cause power brings power, money making more money
Love will make you not love again, but constantly want it
Warning: feelings erupt when they're left dormant
It's what y'all witnessing, it's what I believe in
Like new money, new cars, new bitches
Life is a game of inches, believe this",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-believe-lyrics
Father Forgive Me,The Mirror,2009.0,"I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
Father forgive me
For I have sinned in a world that is broken and scorned
I should have been warned, nobody tells us
That you will live your whole life just to die, then be mourned
So what's it all for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

My God...
Everybody wanna look at me deep in my eyes and see the soul
So I keep 'em closed
I'm the one the Lord himself done chose
To be a stand out and stand alone
Me, myself, and I
Is what I got in the end
You can put me in the casket or pen
Probably be a better state than I'm in
But then again, I be watching from the outside, looking in
Looking in from the outside as I reminisce
Wanna give witness, all the remembrance
For those who ain't here who'd love to hear this
Love to see this, love to feel this
Maybe you wouldn't have felt just how lonely life gets
Maybe you never see just how dark the night gets
Why is the question, and the reason

I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
Father forgive me
But do you know what they scream when they dying in pain?
They scream your name
The Lord is our Savior
That's what the pastor says every week Sunday in pray
But you're never there
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Oh Lord...
Will they ever understand us loners
Us natural hustlers that hug the corners?
And plus it feels like the world is closing in on us
Or is it just me? The one and only
(R-U, R-U, L-E, L-E)
Ain't nothing anybody really can tell me
Done been through it, done seen it all lately
I'ma get through it, just bear ya soul with me
'Cause it's all crazy, but it's all made me
Realize the gift that the Lord gave me
Wish I could sometime talk to him and save me
What would I say? I don't know, maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm lonely, only because (I)
Was born alone to die alone (my)
Life is lived to die, to mourn
Live for today, you die tomorrow, that's why...

I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
Father forgive me
But there's a life I must claim, and his life isn't mine
Please send me a sign (death)
Was the scene of the crime as he lied but his eyes wide and died
And nobody cried
All the lonely people (I look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (I look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all belong?",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-father-forgive-me-lyrics

Living my life on the road
And every city is home
I should have picked up the phone and said that I
(I just never had time)
I never had the time
The time I need to say
That what's been killing me
Is, baby, one four three

Everybody you was with said you was shit, girl
That's right: the it girl
The one I'm really trying to get with, girl
Not once, but kinda like a refill
I feel, I cannot get any better
You niggas getting cheese better make mines fetta
Spread it on brushetta
Been all around the world seen these bitches won't shut up
How did we meet? Sucked and fucked ? caught up
? brought up
I've been wanting to experience real love
I really wanted to explore love, I just never had time

I never had the time
The time I need to say
That what's been killing me
Is ? one for three
Living my life on the road
And every city is home
I should have picked up the phone and say that I
(I just never had time)

Let it rain, let it rain, rain down, on me
I've been really trying to be someone I never been
Trying to visualize something I never seen
And if I can't see it, how could it every be?
I'm just trying to be more than a memory, I pray
Remember me, miss me when I'm gone
18 months ain't that long
I need to get away from it all: the niggas, the bitches, the business
Like Drake said, the hardest part is minding your own
Fuck 'em all bilingual, maricon
I'm on the beach with my feet up: Monaco
The sad part about it, though
I wanted you to be here, I just never ? say so
? say no
I couldn't think you was waiting on my call
(I just never had time)


If I'll never get the chance to say it
Them 3 words: so famous
Or infamous, depending how your dope do
Me myself, I'm more ? love true
I'm here, but never there for the moment
Especially wondering how we still do it
? done it
Sex is always, ""Who's coming?""
So selfish, but so wanted
If there's anything you learn from this is
Don't let your feelings lie dormant

Nigga never seen that before John Cooper
The glass roof in that look like ?
It’s publicity, statue wish you rather rapping
Windows tinted, he must be an athlete
Nah, nigga, it's just little ol' me
Ah you and me old beef is gon’ be
My life is Kobain, meaning I O.D
And speak my mind like, ""Fuck the Police""
They should free Wayne, let Rule be
Let's start shooting straight to the tippy
Heading to the top

Keep them rocking 'til the sun gon’ drop
Keep spending money cause I got it so much
Club banger make them all show up
It ain't a sign of slowing down cause we're going straight to the top
Chain swinging, hanging low to the top
Keep sipping if you're going to the top
Can't stop, going straight to the top
Meet me at the tippy, we’re going to the top

If I never catch a break, it's because I can’t be broken
Never give up hope, if I did I would be hopeless
Never wanna loose focus, I'm a visionary, I see far
I can see if its a false and expose it
? on me, save a secondary
Commentary when it's gossip, you overhear it
Damn them canaries, you can hear them singing
Rock tunes like the stones that makes your spirits
This ain’t just ?, this is real shit
In my presence to walk you should feel privileged
So arrogant, yeah, I'm so confident
I've been both so long, I can't tell the difference
Mwah, kiss myself, Gene Simmons
Sometimes I get high, my sky has no limits
And why should it, when men have walked on the moon
Just to be among stars
Baby meet me at the top


Kalenna and Ja Rule cruising down town
And it’s eight till night the Eiffel Tower we ain’t drunk yet
Shout it to my niggas from F to E
Bring it back to the east coast and party like we been here
We throwing hundreds, we throwing twenty’s
We got the whole motherfucking club jumping
We ain't running, we see ‘em coming
We at the top so we don't give a fuck",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-to-the-top-lyrics
The Rain,Irv Gotti Presents: The Inc.,2002,"We 'bout to do the damn thing, you know
Roll that shit up, pop that shit
Pass that quarter, nigga
Haha, it's the CMC

Everybody wanna fly, high
Aim for the hills now
The Rain gon' trickle down, Sugar
All over you, hey
Everybody wanna fly, high

The Rain gon' trickle down, Sugar
All over you, hey

Aiyyo, I figure if I'm goin out, fuck it, I'm goin all in
Straight to the, top of the world where it ain't no fallin
My inner self is warnin, Chris Black it's like chill
But you know about Jody, oh Jody get ill
But now here I go, fallin down the hill, nigga tumblin
Thirsty than a muh'fucka, butterflies rumblin
The sunshine comin in, my eyes still rainin
I'm focused real hard but the numbness remainin
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 hours pass
Spend up the gas station, tank still for of gas
Oh Lord, it's what I'm in but I want it to stop
I got my rain coat on and really want it to pop
A nigga humble, but you know a nigga Jody won't eat
It's real crazy on the hill where the homies don't sleep
I seen a full moon, made a left, jammed on the breaks
Hit the curb, crashed and burned, damn it was too late

Everybody wanna fly, high
Aim for the hills now
The Rain gon' trickle down, Sugar
All over you, hey
Everybody wanna fly, high
Aim for the hills now
The Rain gon' trickle down, Sugar
All over you, hey

I think I'm float-in, cause the way you make me feel
Got me - goin, I'm so open, I'm tryna stay focused
But I'm livin it up, fourth way model, bitches and up!!
Take a ride in my Ferrari baby, burnin the clutch!!
It's a little, don't give a fuck about, rappin it up!!
I'm just, eager to fuck!!
You know me it's O-1, quick to pop 1 or 2, bitches
Makin it easy to come for you, bitches
You know how a nigga penetrate
Grabbin you by the waste, fuckin 4 to 8
That's us, ass up
You lookin so good that a nigga can't pass up
But the way my nigga feelin, I can't respond to the touch
Tired as fuck, man, sweatin like a son of a bitch
Can't even love you, damn

Everybody wanna fly, high
Aim for the hills now
The Rain gon' trickle down, Sugar
All over you, hey
Everybody wanna fly, high
Aim for the hills now
The Rain gon' trickle down, Sugar
All over you, hey

Everybody wanna fly high, over the hill tops
But knowin everythings about slidin down through the raindrops
Phase pop and pose sakin, 'bout to run outta patience
Everything is a blur, heart racin
Mind over matrix, Heavenly Father
Devilishly I really got a low key car
But it's harder then to pass, peer pressure in all the masses
When all the kids is goin on class trips, caught acid
Listenin to hard rock classic, bangin they heads on walls
Then go blame Eminem for that shit
The mind could be hazardous, when it's influenced
By substance abusive music for people to go use it
But, I was alike, like a tint on a window
Everything is darker, just a little bit harder
So when the wind blow, I wistle in the willows
On the top of the hill, 'cause I know

Everybody wanna fly, high
Aim for the hills now
The Rain gon' trickle down, Sugar
All over you, hey
Everybody wanna fly, high
Aim for the hills now
The Rain gon' trickle down, Sugar
All over you, hey
Everybody wanna fly, high
Aim for the hills now
The Rain gon' trickle down, Sugar
All over you, hey
Everybody wanna fly, high
Aim for the hills now
The Rain gon' trickle down, Sugar
All over you, hey",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-the-rain-lyrics

Yea, yea
Murder Inc, uh, uh - classic shit
Yea y'all
I'm a rock star bay-bayyyyy (yea)
{*coughs*} Fuckin with these niggas! {*laughs*}
Yeahhh, yea, yea, uhh

I'm a rock star bay-bayyyyy
If they could only, read my mind
I'm a rock star bay-bayyyyy
If they could only, hear my cries
I'm a rock star bay-bayyyyy
If they would only re-alize
I'm a rock star bay-bayyyyy, hey hey
Only if they could live my life

Said a nigga was RAISED up in the streets (yea mama I'm a thug)
And nuttin is stoppin for me (except for myself)
Is the Lord in me? (You and everyone else)
God please shine down on me
I'm not the only nigga that prays every day for forgiveness
This life is makin me substance abusive
The media always wants the exclusive
Well here it is - FUCK 'EM ALL - baby cause they're useless
Sometimes I feel all I need is my music
It fuckin sets me free, and let me breathe
Cause my niggas ain't leavin they blood on the streets
For they kids not to eat, and they kids not to eat
REVOLUTION! Pick a side and draw heats
And may the best man hold his head on these here streets
Cause in life and in music I'm poised and I'm focused
And the world should take notice


Underworld ties, is where my heart lies
They do the drama, makin songs like ""Ol' Blue Eyes""
That make the whole world sing..
It's alright if you don't understand me, it wasn't meant to be
Cause it's hard enough for me to fight for what I believe in
Than have to look in the mirror and see demons
Now everybody's talkin rhyme over reason
My only reason for rhymin is cause I bleed it
Here come the leeches; they gettin paid
Off my talent, my love, my pain - am I a slave?
Bein cursed in my own brain
For this life I embrace and I praise
A nigga stuck in his ways
As the remix plays
Rule and J. Blige, ""Rainy Days""
I think about life and music and how to stay focused
And the world should take notice


Hey, this is a message to mankind
I bust clearly you shoot blind, not in my right mind
Lord if you love me please throw up a sign
And take a nigga off the path of destroyin his life, and
This life we're livin the sign of the times
Where buildings take on planes, babies born with AIDS
And we all need change
So I became a rock star bay-bayyy (rock on)
Now they all gon' hate me (hate on)
But from the bottom of my heart I pray
That in life and in music the world stays focused
And I hope you all notice

Better Days,R.U.L.E.,2004.0,"Don't wanna talk about the ???
When I get home ??? I know it's hard bein alone
But try bein alone in a hole, it's not me
But they got me under lock and key
Soon we'll be together, once they set me free
Altought misunderstood, I promise I'll be good
I'm thinking 'bout takin' you out the hood to Hollywood
Cause you're my star and I thank the Lord for havin' ya
Around, when a nigga really needed a partner
You was my baby girl and I was your father
It's harder to beat the system from the inside
First it breaks down yourm mind, then strips your pride
But a man always stands on two feet, his heart pumps one beat
His soul never leaves the street
For the body of empowerment, sling pies to the government
I'm coming home, but someone's goin' in

Baby, I seen better days
Like them days whem I'm with you
Without you I'm so alone
Baby, I'm coming home

Is this my bitch? What up baby, you's be doin it?
How's things been movin and how my niggas doin?
Is everything on the up and up?
Or tell me who I gotta scream on for fuckin up
Send a ??? to them niggas that ain't keep in touch
And let 'em know that them blocks they hold
Well I don't know
I'm coming home and things might change a little
'Cause they know they owe it back to ??? issues
I'ma need you to come real heavy this next visit
'Cause my man got more time
He gon' hold down the business side
While we rippin down 125
In the SL55, yeah, getting high
Ma, we got work to do
Tell Papi and them to work with you
I'll see 'em on the first of June
Let the The Inc know that I'll be home soon
Set a nigga out
I gotta go, Ma
I'm out

Baby, I seen better days
Like them days whem I'm with you
Without you I'm so alone
Baby, I'm coming home

I hit the streets so, fresh so clean
Only been home a week but you should see how them ??? gleam
Last time out you brought me the burgundy Bent'
Dressed me in all Burberry and had wifey all worried
But baby, I'm heaven sent, you know
They call me young L-O-K-I, the angel of ones demise
Take a look in my eyes and see the passion
I'm just wonderin if y'all watchin, that's what i'm askin
And if I ask too many questions that can't get answered
I'ma take it out on the world, niggas will start smashin
Cause ain't nobody livin the way we live
??? ghetto bastards
And everything we do exceptional
Look savage
It it because we gotta grind from the ground up
Or maybe it's because them better days don't see us
No matter what the schoolin is
Penn State or the state pen
My better days is about to begin

Baby, I seen better days

Without you I'm so alone

It's still Murder, I.N.C

 I got you mami
 I got you daddy

Let's get this party started
Throw your drink up and move your body
But you can't get up on it
'til I see you work harder for it
C'mon, let's get it started
Don't you leave me all hot and bothered
You want me?  Come grab it
Show me that you got me daddy

I got you ma, workin in New York City
It's Satuday Night Live, and I'm hot so bear with me
Plus a little tired from the time zone switches
But right on time to hit a club for a minute
I get in and get a table, get bottles, some bitches
Come over, they claimin they models
Until they want a drink they ain't even know who I was
Until I took my hat off, and then they started backin that ass up
Whoa!  She did this dance with her hands up
Then she touched her toes and made my thing stand up
Type of chick that'll have a nigga in handcuffs
Taste but don't swallow, look but don't touch
Forbidden, not to be eaten, but she is
Feedin me rotten apples that fall from the tree
Why don't we leave, just us three, and get acquainted
Mama I'm just playin - but I'm sayin


I got you ma, I'm in L.A., I'm the latest
Caught the last flight in from JFK
Baggage claim sign read R-U-L-E
Takin me straight to the party so I can get started
Rubbin on bitches like full body massages
And takin dead aim on all open targets
Soon as I walk in I see the one
That I wanna be humpin, bouncin, and grindin on
Her lowrider sit low, you can see her thong
And she like to get low on her favorite songs
I'm like don't stop, get it get it, let me get up on it
Let me see how bad you really want it
Like, them cold nights when you're hot and lonely
Give me your pager, pick up a phone and call me
I was thinkin that maybe we could have an orgy
Mama I'm just playin - but I'm sayin


I got you ma, and Miami's the scene
Filled with fast women when they stop intervene
Tanned up and their walk is mean
I don't wonder how she got in, I want her out of them jeans
It seems, me and my team got a routine habit
Of gettin rid of sweaters as soon as we snag 'em
In the club, gettin high, relaxin
I see a few asses that's pacin backwards my way
The DJ spinnin it backwards
Givin shouts to actors, athletes and rappers
Now, let's get it crackin, you know how it happen
After the party there's an afterparty happenin
(Let's get this party started)
Ain't that what you said, or am I hearin things?
Is you drunk, cause you look like you swerve in both lanes
Mama I'm just playin - but I'm sayin


I got you ma, y'know

We livin in strange days
Spend it all and we ain't got enough
We livin in strange days

No me, no you, no us
We tried, we failed, what's love?
We fucked, you wanna lie
Man who I'm talking about names remain anonymous
Could it be her, could it be her? I'm like
What if it was, what if it was?
I got you intrigued, only because
My life is so strange, gets in-teresting
For all those that's interested
We gon' get into something intricate
The sex can get infamous
That all depends on just how strange it gets


Love triangle, same circle
The square root to evil is virtues
Fresh shit for good dick, what's it worth to you?
Better question baby, how that work for you?
It's gotta be paranoia
To be a ghost to a good friend, paranormal
Knowing the road to the dead end's around the corner
Catch ends before you hanging and you Osama
Then smash in, head shots, no drama
And what goes around comes back, bitch, it's called karma

Enamorada, de ti
It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives
We can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind
I'd live a thousand lives
Each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart
Sometimes I think that a true love can never be
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about
A deeper love I've found in you
And I no longer doubt
You've touched my heart and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try (Oh)

Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart
I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real, oh yeah, oh yeah
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right , no no
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart, oh yeah
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Funny)
And you can't move on even though you try (Even if you try)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Baby, ain't it funny how
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Change your life)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (Wrong or right)

Me,Exodus,UnKnown,"I know you niggas ain't fuckin' with me

How dare these niggas try to fuckin hate on me
Come out and make records sound just like me
But nobody does this here quite like me
Now let me tell a little something 'bout me
Pops tags, things fresh to death like me
Who pulls more whips out the stash than me
Y'all bitches wanna ride, c'mon it's on me
I guess it's my time, all eyes is on me

Man everybody wanna rhyme like Rule, sing like Rule
Talk some shit to get they name on the news
Papers, haters never pay they dues
Always got to be in somebdy shoes
Walk with me, or ride this on Bentley
With the rims you can sit in
Or the Enzo with them TV's that's hidden
I stay in menages with various women
Huh, I'm just kiddin' that's not how I'm livin'
The realest, the nigga in the realest state
I got real estates in different states, go figure
Cause I ain't singing you'se a +Gold Digger+
But bitches, +you ain't fuckin' with no broke niggas+
That's why I ride, ain't you see I put you on the CLS
We on the point your voice sound like sex, yes
There's no real way to stop me, that's why y'all copy
I know you niggas ain't fuckin' with me


Yea, I know, one more gin, bitch you better come on in
Relax a while, sip on hypno and henn
I like your style, you're so old school
In them Sasson Vidals, fiftyfour eleven
Reebok classics Remind me of '87 when
Niggas was playing with blocks like little kids and
Even though we men we still big wheelin'
Still cop cribs, six beds, four baths, high ceilings
All of the art of drug-dealin' cause every mil
Is two for me, when it's all tax-free
Pray for God's children, all except for me
I'mma walk in the path the Lord has paved for me
One foot at a time, niggas follow my footsteps
Put the world on my shoulders, leave one set of footprints
Man, y'all motherfuckers can't stop me, that's why y'all copy
I know you niggas ain't fuckin' with me


I know what niggas to do right, can't do no wrong
And everything's alright, then lyrically goes wrong
No part to piss in, no shoulder to cry on
You get to thinkin' why can't we let by-gones be by-gones
Rule the icon, who killed the industry like iPods
Had these niggas runnin' like track stars
Except runnin' backwards when I sit back rollin' the backwoods
Loadin' my trey-duece for them niggas that act hood
Ridin' my six-duece uptown, I'm so hood
Bitches love the coupes when them doors swing upwards
Money long, I'm putting from the green like T-Woods
??? is not to be confused with white good
White gold should never be percieved as platinum
And cubic-zirconia never gon' shine like diamonds
Cause, no matter how hard they copy, they still not me

When I was young, this sorta life was contagious
Hustlin' hard like them sharks down in Vegas
My gat and I come bust spontaneous
This world made us to take only what they gave us
The game is our loss
Watch yo gloat
Then show you that this world ain't yours
Push crack like swingin' doors
And leave strips wide open

A pair a nines and ya'll cats foldin'
My life ain't been all that golden

I know I'm fallin'
Into the evil of money and drugs and lost woman
But that's what I'm lovin' about livin'
Bein' I see my birth as a givin'
Knowin' my inner limits
This game ain't no scrimmage
Let's play big, we're winners
Beg the Lord for forgiveness
For when I die please take me off your shit list
Cause I'll be nameless
Puttin' them through changes
The J to the A
Niggas know the flows crazy

What makes a nigga what he is?
And how do we get from where we at to where we be?
It's evident who's out for the dead president
And why so many close to my heart had to die
Where we goin' in life figure
There's no start no end

You could count on your nigga

I got a lust for this money
Admire them old timers
Assume with no conscience
Made a world so chaotic
Opened up my mind and introduced me to narcotics
Brand new whips not this thicks the hottest chicks
I just can't seem to keep them off my dicks
The difference is y'all did y'all thing on the low
Made a lot of dough
We did our thing high pro
Though we still blew
I wish I knew dirty money was evil
I never understood until I lost a few people
Dead and gone still their memory lives on
Throw a mural up let them niggas them was loved
Now we're into better things
Got our hands on every ring
Crime in the streets
Cause it's my time
I draw the line between love and war really
Nigga you with me
You're flossin', outside that you fear me
Literally straight up and down with no cross
As God is my witness and JA is yours
I'm a spit in your directions
Hit the floors, Nigga

What makes a nigga what he is?
And how do we get from where we at to where we be?
It's evident who's out for the dead president

I make hits while y'all niggas best shit be the skits

I take em off, I'm lookin at you with your eyes closed
You can't see to know, my niggas get dough
Live fast, set you up and rob you slow
Can I, be forgave for cursin your name?
Will I, be the last nigga to shed my pain?
If not, I'm a spit flames till I'm dead and the angels sing
Cuz when you hot that's what this game'll bring
And I'm sick with this, my flow is fuckin ridiculous
When Ja's on the premesis niggas is gon get it
For the fearless, you a little hard headed, you needs to feel it
Clap on em, let these niggas know you dead serious
Niggas comin at who? Ja Rule?
Nigga what the fuck, you brand new? You ain't know?

Your low pros on your west C 400
Residential rolly flooded, with carats
Time to get this pimp shit established
You hoes don't know? I'm extravagant livin lavish
Alias Don (?) Barnes, hun, funds unlimited
Backed by my 'preme team crime representatives
We in this, to settle some sure unfinished business
With deadly intentions, redemption
Rollin live Rovers with new suspension, over niggas
When I quest for nine digit figures
Bitch, we poppin Cham', Cristal, caddy corner from Jigga
Yeah, we them provacative, million dollar click niggas
Up the emmys, prefer crew with linen
Love the devil and women I keep em sinnin
God forgive me, just as filthy as the next nigga
No excuses, but just put in work for Lex Lugers
Laptop computers, the power of smack
This wasn't Compton, look how they snatched black on falls back
I feel that, you like a part of me that I need back
In prison, out of control but driven
]From the island to Clinton, down state to up state
The cell shit could mentally frustrate
With all gray, crimi-nals
Show strength, consolidate with the best a y'all
No doubt, so as we eagerly await your come out
I'm constantly avoidin comin in

What has this world come to
When a nigga like me could be perceived the American Dream
Life ain't always what it seems, my younguns
Please believe strugglin', always provokes the hustlin'
To that we accustomed
You get acquainted with everybody throughout the hood
Still don't trust 'em
Trust is a serious thing
Most niggas don't trust nobody they ain't know since sixteen
Does that mean the devil is in us, of course
Who you think is holdin' us up to fall short
Touch but don't taste, taste but don't swallow
And these are the rules that we 'posed to follow

People pray for eternity, never see tomorrow
They just, wishin' the Lord would take 'em away from the horror that
I'm currently, bringin', y'all motherfuckers gonna hafta
Murder me, swingin' bud, I won't die

Hear what I'm sayin', y'all niggas better start sayi'n prayers
'Cause a nigga with no cares, is finally here
Say what I want, when I want, fuck police
'Cause my gangsta niggas know we own the streets
With the wind beneath my wings, ground under my feet
I'm the black rose nigga that grew from concrete
It's the Rule, get it right, or get it real hot
A whole lotta shots sent flying through your block 
The one I need, and, oh, before I leave
Does anybody else feel they don't wanna breathe
Been menacing this society since conceived
And nigga you know cold hearts don't bleed

Still they, pray for eternity, never seein' tomorrow

Lights out niggas! (Huh)
You clowns (Ha, Ha, Ha)
The Murderers is here now
The game has changed
You know what I mean
Nobody knows you anymore
Your records make no sense
You know what I mean
I just want to know, all I want to do
I just want to know, how does it feel
Huh, let me know
What it feel like, huh
(Ja Rule)
I know y'all niggas is, thinking of thoughts
How y'all gon' catch the Rule
It's, catch a dude and, send the feud
But it won't do, cause now I got a crew nigga
Black Child, Tah, Murda fucking Inc. nigga
O-1 and Vita, keep the dope and the heater
Or the fucked up rental, or a hot two seater
As long as the love with me
Hoods will never forget me
I could put raps in them, and shine up the city
Like elected Frank Nitty, jot a Big Poppa
For reasons of, we run up in a big truck and pop ya
Midnight opera
Over the wheels, slug body marks, and pop up
(Tah Murdah)
Seem like y'all niggas ain't never gon' learn
Either you hitting, or the nigga getting hit
Cause son, when I click and cock, my shit gon' pop
And never been, a small nigga
Always a score nigga
That be up in your braud nigga
You fraud nigga
Cop yae, from far, but never raw niggas
My A's and SK's will rob when it's war nigga
Product and money
So if you want fifteen, it's twenty
And if you less than ten, I won't bend
Or y'all niggas to run with it
Gun busting, I done did it
And anything else that come with it
You don't want it
If it's real, put the deal on it
Stand up niggas will have you sitting in chairs with wheels on them
And that murder shit, I'm still on it
Murder for life
Give a fuck if you a accept it
You better respect it, unless it's, one of my fam' members
Leave whoever into this involvement in legal tendency
Laying where the dirt be
You dig this
Better recover with some big shit
Or duck when this fifth spit
(Someone Talking)
Another question: Is you willing to die
Just as much as you want to kill?
(Black Child)
I went from handcuff recovering
Blowing up from bubbling
Shot muscling
All my checks doubled in
Fuck tussling
Word to God
Got a hundred men, with guns and tems
And we love Mack-10's
Since the sex, got a nigga blushed with me
Got a nigga wet
Dropped the lex
Copped the tech
We cashing checks, son
We out to get the decimals
Don't know about the rest of you
You fucking with professionals
Murderers, that will split your juggle up
Motherfucker I'll cut ya
And you think Tah touch ya
Then we flip shit with bitches that ride all day
And niggas that get head, on the highway
And niggas hating
To see Satin
Or be played
I'm gon' tell yo' ho, you in hell waiting
While niggas on Earth
Flossed like they first
For what it's worth
Murderers blast first

Niggas respect murder everywhere
It's the streets
Nobody's dancing in the streets
Huh, the streets is ours man, murder

Nigga, it's so hard to say good-bye
I wonder why
Take a sneak peak kissing herbs on a high
Hah, I'm down for whatever, whenever
Murderers stick together
See Vita, be that chick to hard throb you nigga
Fuck you, then rob you nigga
A grimy braud, that will set you and wet you
Leave you for my dogs to fetch you
Tie you up and wet you
Unless you, talking pacos again
It don't matter
The longer we spend, the longer we win
And Gotti, showed me how to work these niggas
??? these niggas
And hurt these niggas
And I'll be there, when my niggas need bail
Catch a body, take the stand, and won't tell
T-tale, I flip wholesale retail
Cheap, so you can get deep into this female

Gangstas and hoes are together
Don't let nobody tell you no different, man
It's the beginning of time
I love my bitches
Motherfucker it's on one
When I come through, niggas run
Niggas know
Equipped with guns, ya heard so
You get plugged up and gutted out
Found dead with a gun in your mouth
Now what you talking about?
Scold on these streets
I'm involved with thugs, who carry heat
To lift you off your feet
The riding suite
But when it's time to eat, the guns come

Sing a Prayer 4 Me,The Mirror,2009.0,"Yea nigga, I'ma heal sumbody soul with this shyt, ya noe
It won't be the last time

So I pray, for the strength of me to go on
Everyday, knowing im not promised tomorrow
If I may, ask the lord can I come home
Its easier said than done, that's why we pray

Everyday 4 da sake of mankind please
Look in my eyes, tell me im lying
Only I cud package and sell the lords gift
Call them records and distribute the sounds of music
Dare to dream, but the sound I hear is acoustic
And my dad is abusive and my momma is losin it
I need base, the type u put in the pot and cook it
Un til it gets hard, hit the block and start movin it
Just had a baby and my baby's momma movin in
With me and momma and there ain't no room 4 all of em
What I would call survival most of em would call quits
But this is how we make our livin, shit
Chorus:

Fuck the world, is what my little young'ns is yellin
It feels so good to be young, black, and rebellious (right)
Say what I want (like)
Fuck imus, fuck George bush, them niggas ain't important in my life
But what is, is the next war that we fightin for whats right
Its for whats left and marriages of the same sex
A child's murdered, the media wants to blame rap
Cuz at the time he was listening to some 2-pac
There goes to show that they really don't even care that
He still a child and he never gon get his youth back
Especially when ur charged for being black, young, and dumb
The ones that they get their ideas from
Chorus:

Lord hear my call, and curse them all, that pray and pray 4 my downfall
Gotta crawl be4 u walk, walk be4 u run
DMC nd with the world in agreeance
That nobody could quite do it like R U L E and the more I started to read it
The more I started believing it
Invincibility will get u higher than any amphetamine
Dope, coke, pills, lean, or weed
And my star is so bright, man how can it dim
I got 3 kids and I live thru all of them
Its like watchin myself grow all over again
Except this time it looks a little better from here

The Mirror (Pain is Love),The Mirror,2009.0,"My life, my love
Is it in vain or am I ashamed?
Of what I came from or what I might become?
Some say that love is pain, some believe pain is love
My heart, my soul's yearning for your love's pain
You need to get you some
Come on and get you some
Some people say love is pain
Some believe that pain is love

Yo, how could one ever know that I'm forgiven
This bitterness and resentment
Block the flow of God's blessings in life
You know it's stressing me, right?
Holding on in the hurt, (?) poison, them emotional scars
And locked doors that shouldn't be open
The lines is too thin like coke and cheap gin
Like ghettos that turn good kids into gunmen, I'm wondering
If all my niggas fall anything
How the fuck we gon' stand for something?
Impossible's nothing, when ya fucking with a nigga with a attitude
100 Miles and Runnin', like (?) and Cube
Like Jesus to Judas
The betrayal is nothing short of ruthless, I'll die before I pretend
I had the power to exorcise, selfish all over (?)
When I am, tempted to see the darker side of my life
I reframe, from entering into traps of temptation
But sometimes I gotta ask myself this question, Lord

My life, my love
Is it in vain or am I ashamed?
Of what I came from or what I might become?
Some say that love is pain, some believe pain is love
My heart, my soul's yearning for your love's pain
You need to get you some
Come on and get you some
Some people say love is pain
Some believe that pain is love

My mind is playing tricks like, look but don't touch
Touch but don't taste, taste but don't swallow
No one's promised tomorrow
But pray for the days to follow, I'm so confused to be honest
Is my faith in the almighty or the almighty dollar?
The father, the son
A hundred to one, the bullet, the gun
Kill somebody innocently that ya love
In my lifetime I sold a whole lot of drugs
And done even more, to ease the pain, the love's gone
They say never say never, I say never get better
(?) back, then back together
Where there's pain there's pleasure
Where there's pleasure there's hate
No one hated me more than myself, it's hard to relate
To someone you know so well, or so I thought
Sometimes I look in the mirror, and see someone else
There's two of me, but I'm by myself
Ready to die, am I losing my mind?
Then look in my eyes, and my question to God
(My life, my love, is it in vain?)
All reflections of pain, that's reluctant to change
I'm transparent to love, I don't see the love in
In reflection within I'm blind, then I close my eyes and
Thank the Lord for every day that I rise
My heart, my soul, my mind
As long as I'm breathing, I'M ALIVE, the reason, I SURVIVE
The pain throughout my life, it's called love

Love is, love is
Pain is, pain is
Love is, love is
Pain is, pain is

My life, my love
Is it in vain or am I ashamed?
Of what I came from or what I might become?
Some say that love is pain, some believe pain is love
My heart, my soul's yearning for your love's pain
You need to get you some
Come on and get you some
Some people say love is pain
Some believe that pain is love

Exodus (Intro),UnKnown,UnKnown,"In case you don’t know the call me Loc
Short for L-O-K-I
I’m speck for rule saying his last goodbye
This is Exodus
This been a hell of a ride
From Vinni Venni Vicci to Blood In His Eye
In the next plan in time I’ve seen the rock split
In the ride it’s as rough as the ride gets
And you know that they all want to murder The Inc
But they can’t kill us, and now we got to finish these niggas
And if finish it means murder (murder murder murder) (?) so be it
Last that I recall
They tried to murder the God mimic my style
Then leave them in memory of
But smile some memories lost the new identeny was born
And na this ain’t a movie dog
This is murder (murder murder murder)
And you need a second for me
Yo Gotti I make the hits you just give me the nod
But the air play the gun
Play from New York to L.A
The S.K's will make these niggas spin like perelaes
We had some good years but I’m tired
And ya niggas despierin
And trying to put the dalce to the fire
It’s like an episode of the wire
The only difference is the vengence is taking us in real life
Now everybody wanna look at us and think twice
And point there fucking fingers like damn the badguys

Y’all nigga’s don’t know we them niggas man murder INC we done bin through it all done n seen it all
There ain’t nothin’ you can tell me nigga haha i just wanna let ya'll know man I’ve been through so many things

N if it wasn’t for the way I live life
Would a nigga pray every night to Christ
Jesus I’m just asking
Coz my prayers never seem to get answered
Ma mama didn’t raise no bastard
I was born with the talent
You can’t touch i call magic
You call it music once it get remasterd
I got with Gotti started makin classics
It’s MURDER
It’s the corses of traffic
Trust was my only niggas force of habbit
At the time in the game everything was average
Pac catches die
Big catches die
And my nigga had a plan to keep Def Jam alive
First he sign D
Then he sign me
Then he introduced Jay
And the rest is histray
Thanks for the memories
Thanks for the misory
Reminising the Spike Lee them was the school days
We graduaterd with A's
But these niggas make you wanna bring out the AR's and AK's
And till they back up coz that what they gave us
When they read the vendikas and various pappers
But no heart no foul ya'll niggas is funny style anyway
Now we go hard shit till the edge

That’s a good question though, See i dont understand why they would think what they thinking about its just not the case tho i love my niggas thats all
Im guilty of and that all that i ever was guilty of is the love for my niggas its all good tho i ain't streesing that shit man sometimes God has to put you
Through things that bring out the best verry in who you are nigga Sam said it to me, he said sometimes greatness is not what you accomplish its wot you
Overcome. Still breathin, feel me?",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-exodus-intro-lyrics

Just a product of my environment, right?
Like Preme, the calmest cat
My dream is to get back to '89 when movin' crack wasn't a set back
In due time, I'll refine the level of excellence
And plaques won't be nothin' but evidence
Rewind the present, before rap was relevant
When my aspirations was to be the next D-boy in the projects
Nah bitch, hustler
Turnt professional rap star, motherfucker
Trap stars on the come up
Now Feds claimin' we more cleanin' cash than a washer

A word from the boss'll turn his son to a orphan

DIE MOTHERFUCKER, DIE!
You damn right, Ja
Come through in that coupe with the chopper
And go RRRAAA RRRAAA
You niggas mad, you ain't go get ya gun yet
I heard you snitchin', lucky I ain't rip out ya tongue yet
Been rappin' 7 years, nigga, I ain't have fun yet
Been pitchin' 6 summers, I ain't get a Cy Young yet (nah)
You got that work a week ago, but shit you ain't done yet ('ssup?)
Nigga I play the bar and do a hundred in one set
(GET 'EM!) You know ya boy losin' threat
You goin' against me you gon' lose, nigga, bet

Your boy Young Newz handle birds like a vet
'erinarian, young barbarian
Somebody rose Marion 'cause I'm about to bury 'em, bury 'em

I am the definition of it (what?), murder

A hundred round drum, boy, I ain't playin' with ya
That's 300 shots, 300 niggas layin' with ya
I'm a marksman, I'm heartless
Moms and pops died, had to fend for myself, became a Spartan
Taught to throw in a cartridge, shoot the head off a target
Knife game like O.J., who want problems, mane?
I keep a Larkin, one in the head
Once I pull it, it's over, you're dead, I'm 'bout my bread

Why Young Buck got stuck for all them fake stones?
And why the hood is screamin G-units homos?

Y'all ain't acting like no straight niggas!
Cos now this bitch Fifty snitching again
I'm throwin shots to the wind
Cos me and Gotti, see, we dipping again
Cos never have two men, owe so much to so many
And I'm so glad, I'm so patient, with enemies
If revenge is the sweetest joy next to gettin pussy
Then killing a pussy nigga is sweeter than busting in ya
And busting out more shots I'll do, cos you're nobody
'Till i find you and kill you!

Like I dont still ride with one in the hand
Like I won't have one of my young'ns hop out broad day with the spread
That 'K hit, Banks fuck around and lose a leg
And Yayo slumped in the hospital bed, eatin through IVs
With a machine helpin him breath, it's INC
And I dont hate, niggas hate on me
More money more problems like B-I-G (Baby, Baby)
I'm in the hood, homie, that's where you can find me
Where we got O's for sale, not to mention a D
Got fiends on lard, nigga I go hard
14 I was moving that white on my front yard
See I'm far from a nigga that's just in the booth spitting it

I got a massacre in the cut waiting to happen
4 bitch niggas a bitch, put 'em in a ditch, dirt nap 'em
Then purse snatch 'em, chain thief, turn killer, the zoo keeper
With tranquilizers for the gorillas, nigga, get your banana peeled quick
When them hammers spit, slip, get hit and watch the blood drip
And soak your G-unit skee coat, and we on the speed boat
With bottles and smooth models that deep throat
Weed smoke in the air, literally in the lair, jet, we blowing down
OG cush by the pound, now, got a 'K with a clear clip
That hold 100 rounds, and its nothing for me trunk it
And come visit your town

Cos on legal grounds, the incs been aquited
But you know the hood is screaming we got away with it
Cos 50 is see-through, and nigga i see you
Lookin like a homo on the cover of GQ
Ascot in the air, literally in the air
Who dat Tyson Beckford was hitting from the rear?
Your moms was queer, lesbian, gay
So it makes sense 50 got gay tendencies

We got M-1's, 32s, 45's, streetsweepers

You should master this
Take notes you bastards;
RULE 1;
Never outshine the master
If you oppose a threat he gon' kill you faster
RULE 2;
Conceal your intentions always
Nowadays niggas either snitchin and catch phrase
RULE 3;
Always say less than necessary
Them niggas that talk too much often get buried
RULE 4;
I know you heard this before
Push your enemy totally, Hail Mary's and rosaries
RULE 5;
Pose as a friend, work as a spy
Take 'em to get high, Then put it between his eyes
RULE 6;
Stir up water to catch fish
This here is my favourite, ain't no need in explainin' it
RULE 7;
Keep others suspended in terror
Be unpredictable, in other words gain the advantage
RULE 8;
Play a sucka to catch a sucka
Seem dubmer than your mark muther-fucker so you can touch him
RULE 9;
Know who you dealin' with
Don't offend no wrong niggas, get your family killed
And RULE 10 shoulda been number 1 to me
Play all the way to the end without gettin' your hands dirty

Do what i do, to make music for the people to enjoy, for the world to love, you know, and and somehow i became a motherfuckin’ criminal hahahahaha""

""Yo, damn i remember when it was on UPN News
And i refused to start losin’; and hopped in my WHOOO
Got a recruit from this (nice?) and peeled back the WHOOO
Niggas listen in i'll tell you how it all began 
That's how it sounded when I-N-C came into the game
On 10th of murder then - them, them
Well we, we, we, cause these boys is hot
These boys got Glocks, these boys send shots do you know what its like, to live your life hard knock?
I think not thats why you live it safe through mine
I think plot then kill, you think suein' them blind
You think lifes a bitch? i think the bitch is mine!
We'll never see eye to eye, ya’ll corporate, we gangsters
And niggas tryin' my patience is gettin' me anxious
To speak for my defendants, that say that they plaintive
Guess we guilty by song, but yo the government must be on""
(Exodus)

""I mean to think that we would jeopardize everything that we built, to motherfuckin’, sell drugs and launder money? i mean are you fuckin’ serious!? You
Understand, I-I mean, we-wer're a company you understand, a-a-a record company, that wants to show love to every nigga that can't get love, that can't
Recieve love, from, from motherfuckin’, the corporate world, that can't go get a job, cause they been in jail, they did a 3 to 9, a motherfuckin’, a bit or
Whatever the case may be they did for their time. We give these motherfuckers the opportunity, we give them jobs, cause ya’ll ain’t gonna give 'em the
Jobs, so we give it to 'em. And motherfuckers wanna look at us and down us for what we do for that! They wanna call us motherfuckin criminals and crime
Family for that! Well if they wanna call us criminals and crime families, then so be it motherfucker! Cause these is my niggas. and if nobody’s gonna
Stand up for my motherfuckin’ niggas, then we gon' do it ourselves, we gon' police ourselves, thats how we been getting down nigga, holla back at me

It's MURRDAAAAA!!!!
Faculty, fucker
Huh, give it to 'em
Niggas act like they don't know
Uh, one hand wash the other hand, y'knawmean? fuck it
HOOK: Ja Rule
You can say what you wanna say about us
But we gon keep rockin...
You can say what you wanna say, but are you ready for the gunplay, hey
You gon say what you wanna say about us
But we gon keep rockin...
You can say what you wanna say, but we gon keep the whole floor rockin
Hey

Basically you can do what you wan' do, say what you wan' say
Real recognize fradulent, all day
Every word I spit evole from rappin in hallways
Clappin in broad day, to stackin it all ways
In God we trust, but percentage before praise
Money before bitches, riches before the grave
If you scared go to church, get a gun if you afraid
Livin this hell, and only through death is one saved
Drugs kill, crime pays, fuck, minimum wage
Stuck in the hood, out of my mind, clutchin this gauge
Caught in a faze from day one, gun'll be raised
Violate I cock til your crib, up in a blaze
Street life, Ranjahz smoke the bathroom pay
Behave crazed, lose it, to this ghetto music
Sing what the fuck you want, if you a thug prove it
This is the real from the heart, not the *Coming of Age*
HOOK

Keep your mind on the game
Cuz when it drugs to sell, we hustlin
If it's guns to blaze, we bustin 'em
My heart's filled with pain
Cuz I flood the hood with nothin but love
If niggas want me, come and get it in blood
The ruler remains
Numero uno, the flow's porto
Then put me, in auto, matic or manual
Just the style dipped chronic, duo, compatible
Niggas want none of the Rule, fo' rilla
Call me caterpiller cuz I sliver, cap peel ya
Manilla, big ballers, drop cash at car dealers
And we ain't got them Hyundais neither
The Rule and Da Ranjahz, come through in back to back Ranges
Say what you say, but shit is dangerous, nigga
Uh, uh, one life, one love
HOOK

Say what you say, every day, all day, gunplay
Drink your liquor, smoke your ganjay, fuck what none say
Sip your syrup til your mind tear up
Sprinkle coke in your blunt fucker, do what you want
Or do what ya feel, just make sure you do it for real
Cuz if you front in the cold, I'ma let this somethin explode
And y'all bitches, mad cuz we tryin to stack riches
Wanna scratch inside of my V
Wanna flat all my tires, tryin to violate me
I don't beef I just pop up on Mickey Thompson's
All chrome on my waist, da all chrome 380 Lawsson
First nigga mad doggin, I'm squeezin carbon
Tryin na put somethin in his noggin, get to joggin
Weavin and bobbin, on these streets I'm like the seargeant
Straight hoggin, triple L love life and lost in
Tryin to eat in the devil's garden

Something New,The Mirror,2009.0,"I know you niggas ain't fuckin' with me

How dare these niggas try to fuckin hate on me
Come out and make records sound just like me
But nobody does this here quite like me
Now let me tell a little something 'bout me
Pops tags, things fresh to death like me
Who pulls more whips out the stash than me
Y'all bitches wanna ride, c'mon it's on me
I guess it's my time, all eyes is on me

Man everybody wanna rhyme like Rule, sing like Rule
Talk some shit to get they name on the news
Papers, haters never pay they dues
Always got to be in somebdy shoes
Walk with me, or ride this on Bentley
With the rims you can sit in
Or the Enzo with them TV's that's hidden
I stay in menages with various women
Huh, I'm just kiddin' that's not how I'm livin'
The realest, the nigga in the realest state
I got real estates in different states, go figure
Cause I ain't singing you'se a +Gold Digger+
But bitches, +you ain't fuckin' with no broke niggas+
That's why I ride, ain't you see I put you on the CLS
We on the point your voice sound like sex, yes
There's no real way to stop me, that's why y'all copy
I know you niggas ain't fuckin' with me


Yea, I know, one more gin, bitch you better come on in
Relax a while, sip on hypno and henn
I like your style, you're so old school
In them Sasson Vidals, fiftyfour eleven
Reebok classics Remind me of '87 when
Niggas was playing with blocks like little kids and
Even though we men we still big wheelin'
Still cop cribs, six beds, four baths, high ceilings
All of the art of drug-dealin' cause every mil
Is two for me, when it's all tax-free
Pray for God's children, all except for me
I'mma walk in the path the Lord has paved for me
One foot at a time, niggas follow my footsteps
Put the world on my shoulders, leave one set of footprints
Man, y'all motherfuckers can't stop me, that's why y'all copy
I know you niggas ain't fuckin' with me


I know what niggas to do right, can't do no wrong
And everything's alright, then lyrically goes wrong
No part to piss in, no shoulder to cry on
You get to thinkin' why can't we let by-gones be by-gones
Rule the icon, who killed the industry like iPods
Had these niggas runnin' like track stars
Except runnin' backwards when I sit back rollin' the backwoods
Loadin' my trey-duece for them niggas that act hood
Ridin' my six-duece uptown, I'm so hood
Bitches love the coupes when them doors swing upwards
Money long, I'm putting from the green like T-Woods
? is not to be confused with white good
White gold should never be percieved as platinum
And cubic-zirconia never gon' shine like diamonds
Cause, no matter how hard they copy, they still not me

Against time,UnKnown,UnKnown,"In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
God, why the Hell am I here?
Is it a blessin' or a painful lesson of life and it's directions?
Date of conception, two twenty-nine
I was birthed and won't be denied
Lookin' into these eyes and witness lives' tragedies
The boy who made slaves out of men, that's me
For every lock, there's a key
The only thing that ever made me click was 'Cash Money'
So that I lust for, be it one of my deadly sins
You know the seven, and I got all of them deep within
Sometimes I slip but you be there
Pick me up, now I'm on my knees like, what's up?
'Cause only in a world that's corruptin' the sick
Could you dare to look at my life and call it innocence?
Got me to a better sense 'cause whats yours is mine
Hear me Lord, I'm runnin' outta time
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Nobody cry for me, 'cause I
Wanna see you smile for me when I die
Look through my windows to the soul
Tell me if you see Ja livin' to grow old
Cause too many niggas done died for what I hold
The talented warmer world which is so cold
Take me, save me, before I'm crazy
The only reason I live is for my baby
Never did you tell me that life ain't a game
Maybe if you told me this, shit might changed
But now, I'm just racin' against time tryin' to survive
And see why y'all niggas drive over nigga's vibe
If you gonna live, know you gonna die
If you gonna steal, know you gotta lie
Get drunk and stay high, don't de-nigga-ny
'Cause they'll never take me alive
Feel me Lord, I'm runnin' outta time
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
I fear's no man, but when it's time to go, I'm gone
Racin' through the darkness, learnin' what's right from wrong
Lookin' for the light but all I see is the night
When everything else is bright, what happened to my life?
Is this what I am, is this what I've become?
A nigga that don't give a fuck about nothin' and no one
Cold, even though I gotta burnin' desire within my soul
I must set this whole world on fire
If I control my destiny, maybe one day
I'll give this world the best of me
You know I never been one to judge right or wrong
I embraced and showed you love, then I throw slug's
At the other side, go get 'em in broad day light
What a nigga would give to live my life?
You don't want it 'cause if you could get it you would try
Feel me Lord, Ja has arrived
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life

Message to Mankind,The Mirror,2009.0,"You lived inside of me
There was nothing I could conceive that you would do for me...
Trouble seems so far away, you changed that right away
You abandoned me...
(But I ain't mad at cha..)

You abandoned me
You abandoned me

Hell nah, I ain't mad at cha
Matter of fact, I was laughing at cha
Crying with ya, thinking God would grab a napkin
Nah, he was just a hoopla, bitch, I'm a superstar, bitch
Get mine regardless
Pardon the arrogant comment
Use and knowledge but admit I schooled these niggas
And did it with honors
Gave birth to a style that is way too common now
Niggas is cocktails, got my shit all watered down
Hennessy flow-er, me, R-U-L-E
Easy people, you know what them guns do
Kill any nigga that ever looked at me wrong
Who ever said my name in vain in a hook of a song
Got to be killed or reformed, disrespecting the Don
Killing bitch niggas has gotta be a blessing from God
And I've been blessed with the strength to go against odds
If it was left to the fans it might've been hard, because...

You abandoned me
You abandoned me

Hell nah, I ain't mad at cha
This world dubbed me the soul snatcher
When Pac died it immediately put All Eyez on Me
The 5 foot 9, 165, raspy voice, you see from Queens, NY
I prospect, usual suspect
The gossip, word on the streets
This nigga Ja Rule is a problem
And runs with more shooters than Rodman
Favorite gun is the Larkin and got more beef than New York, Boston
Inc. got the U.S. Open
Time served, the south turned, turn back the time in ya Muller
Who the, nigga.. who the, nigga..
But still I know I got it like that like Pharrell
But that didn't stop the public from giving me hell
And I won't stop continuously pressuring them
So any niggas that jumped ship can jump back in, because...

And anybody that want it or got jewels run it
And end over your head, don't make me gun butt it
Do you like Manolo, put two in your stomach
And flash the burner on bitches like stacks of hundreds
I'm livin my life (my life), what gets better than ice in hell
When you cookin up coke to sell
It be the little statistics, some pictures, some prints
Some informants to get the operation pitched
We enormous, some would say the ""Inc."" is ""Murderous""
You don't want us to strap up and bang the strip
But if need be, we'll bang out like Bloods and Crips
Styrofoam the noozles and extend the clips

Who pulls more whips out the stash than me

Yea, I know, one more gin, bitch you better come on in
Relax a while, sip on hypno and henn

In them Sasson Vidals, fiftyfour eleven
Reebok classics Remind me of '87 when
Niggas was playing with blocks like little kids and
Even though we men we still big wheelin'
Still cop cribs, six beds, four baths, high ceilings
All of the art of drug-dealin' cause every mil
Is two for me, when it's all tax-free
Pray for God's children, all except for me
I'mma walk in the path the Lord has paved for me
One foot at a time, niggas follow my footsteps
Put the world on my shoulders, leave one set of footprints
Man, y'all motherfuckers can't stop me, that's why y'all copy
I know you niggas ain't fuckin' with me


I know what niggas to do right, can't do no wrong
And everything's alright, then lyrically goes wrong
No part to piss in, no shoulder to cry on
You get to thinkin' why can't we let by-gones be by-gones
Rule the icon, who killed the industry like iPods
Had these niggas runnin' like track stars
Except runnin' backwards when I sit back rollin' the backwoods
Loadin' my trey-duece for them niggas that act hood
Ridin' my six-duece uptown, I'm so hood
Bitches love the coupes when them doors swing upwards
Money long, I'm putting from the green like T-Woods

Let me roll another up so I can ease my pains

Smoke weed

And whenever I ball, bitch, I'm an all-star
I'm a superstar, superstar, superstar
I'm a superstar, superstar, superstar
I'm on my stairway to Heaven, dear heavenly Father
God had on no Gucci, guessing cause Devil wears Prada
You know? don't let my bitch get money
I know you want get it, still you can't take nothing from me
A nigga living comfy, hoes imported from London
Half white, half good loving,? packages shipped to the Runners
? he be straight from Cuba, life is a mo'fucker
Until you finally fuck her, found out you shouldn'ta trust her
The lifestyle of a hustler, blow money fast, fuck 'em
Throw it up in the air, make it all back before sun up
Every bitch is a come up, no matter who you are
Here's a toast to the trap stars, biatch
I'm on my stairway to Heaven, dear heavenly Father
The devil told me not even Heaven's better than stardom
Got 'em fucking applauding, had me fooled for a moment
Like so many others, them cameras done turned into photos
I seem them flashing lights, but really what's the fucking motive?
Been motivated all my life, couldn't wait for this moment
Big house out by the water, maybe I came with the chauffeur
Now I said? like twelve summers
We straight from the Bahamas, got me spending like?
These boys? go somewhere where we got options
But once I get there, I start to notice my biggest problem
How am I so alone when I'm so surrounded?
Still on my stairway to Heaven, dear heavenly Father
This devil wore a blue dress: Angelina, Madonna
Fame monster, no relation to Gaga
Bitch got a lot of problems, money ain't one of 'em, promise
Graduated with honors, she don't drink, she don't light up
We're heavy on that powder, now every night is young
Red murcileago, who the fuck gon' stop her?
She's been racing towards an early grave, and guess who's the driver (Fame)
She thought she'd live forever
Like so many stars whose souls we captured on cameras
I need my privacy, said it?

Loose Change (Tradução),UnKnown,2015.0,"Verso 1:
Quantos cara segura uma arma como Ja Rule?
Vou atirar na sua boca pra explodir sua cabeça e mandar pra longe
E deixe o pequeno Ja pipocar você
E se sobrar alguma coisa
Te mando para westside e deixar os cara te mostrar como é o lance
''California Love'' é o que você mais quer,e também sua sepultura
Que vai tá escrito:
''Aqui encontra-se 50,que caguetou de mais
Essa metade de um dólar,essa moeda de 10 centavos que morreu como uma merreca''
E a Murder Inc enviará as mais profundas e simpáticas condolencias
Para Aftermath,Shady,Interscope e Jimmy Lovine
Cê sabe que sua equipe só tem peões,que são mijados e plugados
Estou falando do viadinho do Dr. Dre
E a Suge Knight me contou como você costumava levar travestis pra casa
E de vez em quando você usava tanga
Não é de admirar que o Feminem é um travesti de salto alto e vestidinho apertado
Minha espingarda vai fazer um estrago
Tô ligado na ''Truth Hurts''
Quando eu detona-la
Batalha de sexos
Isso é uma mulher ou um homem?
Nem quero saber,mas o 50 vai levar uns tiro de novo
Pela M-U-R-D-E-R Inc
Eu sou um rapper que canta,anda armado e tem jóias
Por conta do FBI,não posso nem comentar
Porque a ''Violator'' do ''Chris Lighty'',é uma ''superpoderosa''
Chorando pro Russel Simmons
(Beat muda para a música do Nas ''Made You Look'' )
Verso 2:
''Eles estão atirando'',ah,Chris Lighty tá com medo!
E Busta Rhymes coma mesma porcaria de refrão
Tipo: ''Eles tão atirando'',eu nem atirei neles
Eu devia ter te colocado no carro fúnebre
Tipo meu parça Jadakiss
Não consegui nem se defender,muito menos fugir de carro
Quando atirar nos seus amigos
E Eminem,pra que essa bandana?
Você nunca vai ter tranças,você não conhece a dor de um negro
Mas você pode se tornar o primeiro rapper branco morto
Continue ganhando dinheiro,mano
A Inc tá com tudo nos esquemas,vamos encontrar o moeda
E você maluco,eu vou te mandar pra sua mãe
Com ordens escritas do ''Gotti'' pra esconder seu corpo
E Dre,seu dia tá chegando,pois eu tenho uma equipe da pesada
Que resolvem qualquer parada
Porque EU VOU ATIRAR em todos vocês,malandro
E Lil Mo,você é só uma vadia
Que não faz uma música bacana já faz tempo
Você é melhor com uma pica na boca,e calada
(Beat para)
Eminem,você confirmou que sua mãe é viciada em crack e a Kim uma vadia
Então,o que vai ser da Hailie quando ela crescer?

And it started with a little kiss, like this!

See-saw swinging, with the boys in school
And her feet are just fly up in the air
Singing, ""Hey diddle diddle with a kitty in the middle""
And they swinging like it just didn't care
So I took a big chance, at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
It wasn't me, she was foolin' 'cause she knew what was she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way!

You're all welcome, dont wanna live my life
May God help them
Am I resemplafy my sacrifice?
Women and ice got me lovin' hells paradice
You feelin

My life is caught up in that madness
But I do deal with it
If the blood's your heart, live it
Baby, don't die wit it
Have to judge my soul (uh)
Trippin' outta control
Smashed up on the freeway
Gotta be the drugroll, give me leyway
Slidin' back and unload, murderers don't fold
Any action need to be shown?
There we go, wrapped and sold
Always rap in front of my foes
I keep playas on they toes
Women know to get that dough
Playas know freek them  ?
We that heat, can't be froze
We that burnin' that leaves you cold
We them guns that can't unload
We that platinum, not that gold
We them thugs, you just can't touch
We them thugs that just too much
Y'all don't wanna deal with us
We them thugs, murderers


 - How many wanna die wit me? 
How many wanna die wit me, die wit me?
Can't ya see they all wanna out my life
If you had your way, I would be dead, on site
Wanna show yo face, so if my love is right
People hatin' on Ja, ain't even half that tight
Hey, you feelin me?
Make me wanna get too close, it ain't a joke
I'm blown away, like bad, yo
You ain't know?
Ja Rule's the one, baby
Ain't always be played with
Mess with me, get dealt with
Murder Inc., the clique baby
You fearing me?",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-how-many-wanna-clean-version-lyrics
F*ck Fame,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Previously on Pain is love...
Here we go again baby. Erase the pain
Got to break free from all this mother fucking anxiety, strains on my life
Open my eyes and see it's a big world out there. If god could only
Shine his light on me. I'm crying everyone's tears. My pain is my love
I'm crying everyone's tears
And now, PIL 2...

And the world was so cold, I couldn't recognize myself
And the world was so cold, I couldn't recognize myself
So I took a little pill, and it changed my whole world
It changed my point of view, so I had to take two

Fuck fame...
Picasso, Rembrandt, Basquiat
Warhol couldn't paint a better work of art
And I'm like a child in art class
Cause I'm trying to brainwash every canvas
You all kiss my ass, the elephant's in the room painted retro
Here's the Van Gogh, but yall don't hear me though
I'm what you never saw, something you never seen
You mother fuckers can't see me; Banksy

Fuck fame...",https://genius.com/Ja-rule-fck-fame-lyrics

Stampedin anything in our way will attract war
If you smart you'll slide over like handicap doors

So when i squeeze im turnin your whole block into a parkin lot
Understand im the grimey floy wanna trip to death then try me for it
Crazy since 94
Thats why cats dont hang around me like chinese stores
One step ahead of you get more guys

F**k talk get the chalk out
You'll be lucky if u able to crawl or walk out
Ja Rule:
I live the mob life
So when i pop up in your life and i pop twice
