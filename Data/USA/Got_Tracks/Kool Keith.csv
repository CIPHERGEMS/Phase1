Honey, that's when she backs off and just lick her teeth...""

(Sex style!) Niggas want it free
They dogs drink my piss (Girls wanna see)
(Sex style!) Niggas want it free
They dogs drink my piss (Girls wanna see)
(Sex style!) Niggas want it free
They dogs drink my piss (Girls wanna see)
You want freestlye, that's right, the style is free
Niggas suck my dick and they girls drink my pee
I'm on some S&M shit you can't get with
Pull your panties down on stage and watch you sweat quick
Suckers back to pull they style is transsexual
Lesbians dance with the funky heterosexual
You on the mic, and when you rhyme I start to jerk off
Let my dog lick you German Shepherd want to bust off
I tear your legs and spot MC's having anal sex
Step around like a Tampax, and step up next
I enter New York, no problem with my dick out
California porno star, my ass you can lick out
Saying ""What?"" with sperm dripping down your partner's butt
I see MC's in my face with their ass up
Let me put my cape on, my rubber and my mask up
Not no horror-core shit, this is porno-core
I'm in the club naked man, I'm the fucking pro
Niggas can't wax no ass, girls should let them know

(Sex style!) Niggas want it free
They dogs drink my piss (Girls wanna see)
(Sex style!) Niggas want it free
They dogs drink my piss (Girls wanna see)
(Sex style!) Niggas want it free
They dogs drink my piss (Girls wanna see)
Back I wreck shit, so what nigga? I masturbate
See your girls' cocked back, her legs tied like a figure eight
I'm on stage getting sucked by 
Madonna
Sticking pipes in your ass, you stop the freestyle drama
I pioneered this shit, you keep on sucking dick
Your girl's in the crowd, hawking me for a naked flick
I got my silk underwear for the atmosphere
Piss in your face and urinate all in your hair
You name a group that's shit, I will pooper-scoop
Fuck with this, miss, I will damage on the premises
Niggas step back with Dax grease, watch their ass twist
I rhyme anywhere, golden showers up in Greek Alley
Movie star bitches, MC's lining up in Cali
Drinking vodka, Absolut, sipping Tanqueray
Mc's jump off, I stung your rectum like a stingray
Girls heinie-wipe, MC's say my shit is hype
Pussies collapse, I'd rather fuck 'em with a cordless mic
Come ride the horse, pull your panties off and pay the cost

(Sex style!) Niggas want it free
They dogs drink my piss (Girls wanna see)
(Sex style!) Niggas want it free
They dogs drink my piss (Girls wanna see)
""May they beat his balls with a ten-pound hammer
'til his asshole whistle the Star-Spangled Banner.""
Now the nurse is here, 
Dr. Butcher
 to your anus
I don't care who your are, and if you think you're famous
You could be waxed, seventy-five fucking rap groups
Bisexuals on stage eating Fruit Loops
Sugar Smacks, I got the rhythm for your ass cracks
Bring your girl, she fantasize in my sex world

(Sex style!) Niggas want it free
They dogs drink my piss (Girls wanna see)
(Sex style!) Niggas want it free
They dogs drink my piss (Girls wanna see)

Livin’ Astro,Black Elvis/Lost in Space,1999.0,"Yeah
Every morning I wake up, lookin' in the mirror
I am the original Black Elvis
That's right, when you see me with my wig to the side
Wearin' my short leather jacket
Marilyn Monroe on my back
I'm livin' that life
I'm for real with this
That's what I think about
I like to tell my fans

I got my shades on, big rock star compared to Elvis
Signin' autographs for rappers while girls move they pelvis
Write songs strictly for Elton John or Lionel Richie
Call up my butler, get clothes washed by the maid
Ivory soap, dishes clean, feel like Cascade
I count the bills, roll through Detroit in Sedan DeVille's
I throw my skully on, big robe like Marvin Gaye
Step in the front row, primetime I move your way
Budweiser Fest soundcheck, demanding your respect
I come correct through the Metro, and turn y'all petrol
I'm up here early bitin' donuts, sippin' on espresso
While you sleep, I creep, gainin' ground by the week
Ampex reels, makin' phone calls, I'm closin' deals
I move with skill, ride through Philly streets and Cherry Hill
I'm doin' it well, I'm doin' it swell
Yeah

Flying saucers, spaceships move at warp speed
MTV level three when I fly on BET
Livin' astro, tell me how you feel
One two, one two

Movin roughly, straight to the desert, San Antonio
I talk swift the Rock King Black Romeo
I pack clubs, promoters put me out in Tokyo
Damage your area, I'mma launch a fierce missile
I roast fools, movin' butt like I'm toilet tissue
What is your issue? You over man, I don't miss you
Scottie soft, you play like Jan Van Breda Kolff
New Jersey Nets real man, you ain't no Darnell Hillman
Bald head like Slick Watts, I run rap like Mayor Koch
Forward your info while Tony Liu crank the Benzo
Move out your driveway while girls look, turn they eyeway
Jealous in fact, tryna rip the capes off my back
I move with timing, potential, through instrumentals
Y'all front on BET with slum gold, drivin' rentals
I get real dino, runnin' groups like a rhino
Endin' careers, that's my job, yo your rap is final
Cancel your in-stores, your new job is moppin' floors
Fixin tiles, stoppin' potholes up on the roof
You work for service no tips man I speak the truth

Flying saucers, spaceships move at warp speed
MTV level three when I fly on BET
Livin' astro, tell me how you feel
One two, one two
Flying saucers, spaceships move at warp speed
MTV level three when I fly on BET
Livin' astro, tell me how you feel
One two, one two, one two

Pull your hoods down, I bumrush your afterparty
Have your manager scared, the radio station saying sorry
Pack your bags, I move my luggage to the coliseum
Infinite prime piece with statues in the rock museum
Changin' my zones, drinkin' cocktails on cellular phones
I tour with Anthrax through Texas with the Rolling Stones
Booked by the agency, famous artists payin' me
Hotels with fly room with sneakers starin' at the moon
Mad atmosphere, ridin' first class on British Air
Lobster and steak, while y'all back in time, doin' remakes
I'm futuristic, nine-nine, to the year 4000
I make announcements, drop skills, then I bounce with
Fly young ladies, AMG kicks, two thousand Mercedes
Brand new models, only seen one in Colorado
Light green metallic in the Shark Bar, eatin' salad
Lorenzo wheels, valet park, shoppin' in Beverly Hills
Step up your wildest spaceship kid in the Plymouth Prowler
Comin' down

Flying saucers, spaceships move at warp speed
MTV level three when I fly on BET
Livin' astro, tell me how you feel
One two, one two
Flying saucers, spaceships move at warp speed
MTV level three when I fly on BET
Livin' astro, tell me how you feel
One two, one two
Flying saucers, spaceships move at warp speed
MTV level three when I fly on BET
Livin' astro, tell me how you feel

JVC is nice
I've been around Japan
It's electronic, calls me Viktor
High on the scales, off the Richter
The media say I'm mature, check me out on Wikipedia
Coach them off their walkers
Let them walk again and run and speed up
I come from a place where superheroes meet up
The X Men drinkin' tea watchin' chicks with D cups
Spiderman saw Doctor Oct spittin' off the top of a New York City bus
City Island eatin' shrimps
Throwin' fries in water to swans and ducks
It'd be wrong to the universe if I drive with a monster green Lamborghini up
All the 5s come out to reunite, throw their beanies up
I molest cholesterol, you's a fine tune abuser
The Yankees lost but the blue and orange team amuse us
I could make a million rappers whisper and hush
Cold Stone ice cream, you don't have to lick that much
They hold my balls, easy soft touch
Throw your ladies some bucks

Flank him out, test his spidey senses on his bank account

Who dance aight
Gave it to Puck from Alpha Flight
The mask was bright as lightnin'
Same type of shinin' got them Teen Titans fightin'
Sippin' on that She-Hulk milk, at least she said it was milk
In a Hello Kitty catsuit, I bet it was silk

Okay-double-oh-L, Keith
Sexy girl! Sexy, sexy~!
Sexy girl! Sexy, sexy~!
Sexy girl!
Sexy girl in sheer panties, I'm the driver in your life
I love to steal panties, the more closer you are near panties
Observin your home amateur VHS tape
I love the around the house motion pictures you make
Your neighbor with whip cream, your legs smeared with Duncan Hines
Your thighs meet my fingers, I taste the thing
The fudge, the great chocolate cake, Niagara Falls is not needed
I'm above the swimming pool dressed up like Dracula
I'll bite your neck by the lake
The script's a natural, I can't beat Paramount Pictures
The backdrop behind Capitol Records is fake
Girl you're beautiful, how do you control your weight?
(How do you control your weight?)
Sexy girl! Sexy girl! Sexy, sexy~!
Sexy girl! Sexy, sexy~!
Sexy girl!
Home alone, touchin yourself in different places by the phone
After midnight the blacklights flow you're in the love zone
The microphone adjusted to the love tone
Keys to your heart, you've now completed the task
Gimme the secrets to your combination, the captain and the boss
Got your bra in my hand, the guidance counselor, your life I own
Your official support, every time you cry and moan
I brought the freak out of you, the way you neck the leak out of you
My desire for you ain't false, everything I write about is true
Your favorite singers are old to me
They're primitive, stuck in time, I'm brand new
Sexy girl! Sexy, sexy~!
Sexy girl! Sexy, sexy~!
Sexy girl!
Over and over, don't get me wrong
While you walk around and pace the floors in your satin thong
Between the sheets - you have the electric feelings reach
Pullin my lips to your fruits of passion
Two pineapples in my face, my tongue taste the tip of your peach
I send flowers to doors, UPS packages circulate the streets
When I celebrate the victory, Jergens lotion glaze your feets
With my hand palmin each bun, I'ma show you girl
The police officer badge, the uniform and handcuffs will make you have fun
Kneel down to your kitten bowl
Your rearview is awesome, I watch the lips unfold

Plastic World,Sex Style,1997.0,"""Yeah, Kool Keith should keep it real
He should(en't) rap about space and Mars...""

Yo, I'm tired of looking at everybody. Same boots, skully hats in
90 degree weather, looking to get into clubs for free. I'm not
Smoking blunts, or looking for jazz records at the Roosevelt
I left New York, the city itself was stress depression
High boots and urban beats, that wasn't my direction
Producers filtering join in with R&B
A million rappers, some clones trying to sound like me
Biting my space styles, biting my horror-core
All I saw was little Kool Keiths, on my tour
Record companies, I G'd-off all my royalties
Watching vinyl spin, local groups' wack MC's
Some try to rap with that perpetrate mobster crap
Karl Kani jeans
, 
fat stomachs in the limosines
Mixtapes by wack DJ's, as doo doo play
I'm on the turnpike, the city drifting down the highway
Like a mirage, the style there is all illusion
On videos out of town, peoples spot confusion
Rolling high with caps pulled over down my eye
Since I been out, y'all can't see
Chorus x2:
Is the world made of plastic?
Is the city buried in dreams? (Yeah)
Is the world made of plastic?
Cause that's the way is seems (Owww)
Watching TV so bored, while imbiciles hold the mic cord
Graffiti playgrounds are played out, yo how'd that sound?
Army fatigues are weak, is for the minor leagues
No rapping cyphers or brothers in the rented Benz
Crews on stage, acting hard with a thousand friends
I saw the place turn plastic
, crack heads looping beats
People with no deals, walkmens rappin on the streets
I turned my back, 90% of the city sounded wack
Payola scams switch DJ's like a rubber band
Everybody clear with beats trying to be Premier
Clearing your samples, your SP-12 fake examples
My money grosses with green from my own label
While you act rich with no cash on the bigger label
Your tri-state ways are shut down by barricades
In fact I pack my bags, and listened to 
E-40
Mac Mall
, 
C-Bo
, and other rappers you don't know
You're narrow-minded in styles of mine you won't find it
My sound proceeds with Moog and undertone bass
No comic gimmicks with beats rapping in my face
I come back real, solid rock razor steel
Tappin your program, show the world I'm the man
You copy Poppa Large
, the industry is robbed
Chorus x2
As I do see soda, wack, rugged beer commercials
Some rappers are bought and puppeteered like the Ninja Turtles
From 
Manhattan I heat up, yo light up Times Square
I make noise like open high hats on your cheap snare
No promotional shows, girls wear corn rows
People with hooded sweaters on crack keep me on my toes
I walk with straw hats and glasses in the projects
Bring my ghost image so tense on the line of scrimmage
Playing my numbers, waiting for the Five to come
Spaghetti out the window, people acting dumb
Fire hydrants wet the neighbors, your family's nosy
I come and go as I please on blockhead MC's
You bought sneakers, no car, scrambling on the corner
I'm not the star you are, the city's fallen far
My mechanism, you're on my tip
Stay off my penis, you've duplicated me for years
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you are the one

Take Off Your Panties,The Personal Album,UnKnown,"Coming Thursday, at the New Orleans Superdome
With special attraction, Kool Keith
Straight from the Bronx, New York City
Tickets, go on sale now

Take off your panties
Let me see your G-string, let me see, what you got
Take off your panties, let me see your G-string
Let me see, let me see

Girl it's been a long time, since I saw you
Don't you know I adore you
Lick your earlobes like candy
I love the turquoise and the silver silk panties
Take you on a trip, not the Bahamas, a room in the Marriott
A elegant martini with Calvin Klein pajamas
The camera ready to film and take pictures
Act like a exotic dancer tonight, I'ma get wit'cha
Take you out of the boring mode to high scoring mode
Explore your private sensation, put you on a new road
Get you in the new life, leave the old ideas down
Go 'head work the pole (work the pole girl)

Take off those panties; let me see, what you got
Take off those panties; let me see, what you got
Take off those panties; let me see, what you got

With the love I have for the baby lotion
The tub water runnin your lingerie is stunnin
Exceptionally gorgeous, the princess bedroom set
I purchased for you, you thought I couldn't afford this
The best massager, you need the best kiss
Dreams come true, you make your best wish
By the time the morning light shines
The teardrop cheeks begin peeking through the window blinds
Last night I was delighted hearing your moans and sighs
Erotic adventure with the mint green mascara around your eyes
Work that pole, pole, pole (girl work that pole baby)

Take off those panties; let me see, what you got
Take off those panties; let me see, what you got
Take off those panties; let me see, what you got

A four week vacation in Mexico
I taught you everything, you can't let me go
You cry when I eat it though
Scream out your orgasms when I'm heated though
Run my fingers through your hair extremely so
You can dance for me and act like you in a go-go
Together in Manhattan we walk through SoHo
You dial my phone and tell me I'm home solo
Relax by the bed, I see you in fire engine red
The mask over your eyes, latex police had on top of your head
Submissive and kinky, you can't resist everything I said
(Work that pole girl)

So baby take off those panties; let me see, what you got
Take off those panties; let me see, what you got
Take off those panties; let me see, what you got",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-take-off-your-panties-lyrics
Black Elvis,Black Elvis/Lost in Space,1999,"Yeah!
For the 2000 (2000)
Black Elvis (Black Elvis)
We get raw with this (hand me my guitar)
Tour bus packed (tour bus packed)

Black Elvis, recordin in the 48-track studio
Madison Square Garden soundcheck, to speak direct
Fans in the upper level, backstage passes
Wearin diamonds around my glasses, leather coat
Thirty thousand from Wilson, countin the mill's
I'm talking to Andre Harrell with a chaffeur drivin me around
In the green Rolls Royce, parked parallel, on Fifth Avenue
Steppin in Bloomingdale's, waitin for Celine Dion to get her nails done
Tour dates start tommorrow, MCI send the cash through Wells Fargo
Black Elvis, 28 G's a night
Tour bus with the Motley Crue, who gon' stop who?
Rock star don't need no tattoo
Guitar out of the sharp, Fender bass with the Stratocaster
With Prodigy, Rage Against the Machine, flyin over the Atlantic ocean
With the potion

Black Elvis, rock star, walkin down Broadway
What y'all thinkin about?
Black Elvis, rock star, walkin down Broadway
Chillin in the project hallway

Tour bus, painted neon green with black wheels
We do big wheels, count big head Franklin bills
Movin up that's when I'm Black Elvis at the Civic Center
Promoter book venues that are too small, ignore the call
Seventy thousand jam packed arenas
With rock fans wearin backpacks
Merchandise sell nice gold shirts with red lights
Sponsored by Dial soap and a Heineken
The biggest rock star gon' rhyme again
Roadie cases for eight months, Samsonite suitcases
Rappers comin home with no money on the red eye with dead eyes
Stadium tickets, watch scalpers get wicked
Pull up in my limo ejecting your demo (your demo)
Stretch lamborghinis with four doors, with four floors
Followin right behind yours, basic Continental
Get out your rental before I get mental
(Yeah baby)


Huge signs on highways, you see the biggest advertisements
I'm at Tim Mandelbaum's office getting my next assignment
Walk in the Sony building, grab checks
Stop in a Hilton, Warner Brothers/Chapell on the back
Of my royalty statements, my name is Matthew
Three apartments on the West with 200 songs
Five minutes each on Ampex reels
At the Shark Bar chewin billionaire meals
At the Apollo, can you digest?
I'm a hard act to swallow
With a Paris France model, with a real estate agent
That's building me a kid's playground in Denver, Colorado
Vacation unknown when I'm speakin 3-way with Roberto Duran
And Sugar Ray Leonard on the cellular phone
Upstate Connecticut, hold you rap style with a better grip

Little Girls,Sex Style,1996.0,"Yo Keith man
I just turned off the TV man
Kids out there be thinkin they hardcore man
We gotta do somethin man, yo
Do it
{Little girls.. think they're hardcore..} (4X)

You got nine cars, tons of champagne, by the cases
Two thousand people killed, fake murder cases
Videos exaggerate things you never make
Your style is all tissue, chocolate fudge cream cake
The companies back you, people out there wanna slap you
Original fraud, funny with a mic cord
Persuadin kids that you hard, every stage you tour
Cold scared you in a motel, you can't come out
After the show, with panties on, you hurry run out
You petrified hallucinatin thinkin hardcore
You got the style now, you have to roll with 50 people
Lookin hard and mean, you ain't pullin triggers
Did you pay your bodyguards, for actin hard?
You get pistol-whipped, booty tapped, face scarred
Down and out, with camouflage gear, and no war
You ain't in the army kid..
{Little girls.. think they're hardcore..} (3X)

Now your show's packed up, you're gassed up
I'm there you're scared
You just turned trois, looked away feelin weird
You on the walkie talkie standin close near the door
Thinkin bout your records how you pop doo-doo more
Posses wait in Texas, Detroit for the bumrush
You bringin rubber, your crew is nervous smokin dust
You perpetrate your front, show your teeth, smokin blunts
Rappers cancel shows, ran away with stunts
Your manager scared, with ghetto mugs starin at him
Your crew pressured more, to even act harder
You took New York, down South them folks, wasn't havin that
Three kids from D.C. pulled out, what you laughin at?
You ran out, funny style, girl style, panty style
Freestyle the same style last week
You was bitin off that kid Bo Peep
With no panties on, your rectum got torn
Rearranged, I caught you after the show
Naked out, butt out, cracked out, with two rolls of film
Tryin to sell pictures of your lover
With you, molestin your little brother
I smacked you and stole your pistols
{Little girls.. think they're hardcore..} (4X)

Tommy, didn't I raise you to go to Catholic school?
But mom, I gotta keep this up, this is all a front
This is just gimmicks to sell my records

Keep it Real... Represent,Sex Style,1997.0,"Yeah, rappers, spread your cheeks
Pull your panties down
Take your wig off, let me see your bald head
That's right, I got you on Kodak
Your pictures are goin out to Black Tail
You're gonna be a star
Yeah..
I heard you quit rap, your wife went back to porno flicks
You turned drag queen, a call girl doin tricks
Nighttime prostitute kid, I'mma take your loot
I heard you queer now like Boy George, blowin flutes
With high heels, you stole your mom's birth control pills
You on some new stuff, I heard about that sex change
You got a vagina, your grandmother think it's strange
New eyeliner, you was flirtin with a gay designer
Your girl felt mines, and pulled off her Calvin Kleins
I saw Tampax, gonorrhea red stopsigns
I looked at her and said, ""Mmm.. put your panties back on""
Then jerked off to Foxy Brown, when her verse was on
I wanna stand back and bust nuts at your butts
Your girl is cocked up, with lollipops, doggie style
I feel I'm dealin with plastic, watch these fake smiles
Yeah, meet my left and my right
Keep it real.. represent what? My nuts (2X)

I got utensils, back up kid, yo guard your rectum
I'm crazy out here, mental man, don't respect him
You now in pain, your mom just had the abortion
Big head Boo, I put some roaches on your whole crew
Have you scared with crack pipes, your family throwin doodoo
Wear out your welcome, your little girl sex desires
Have you handicapped, some friends of mine blow your tires
Like Alfred Hitchcock, the ghost stands on your block
With nine mil's for drug addicts, I keep triggers cocked
You on some methane, my witchcraft is on your brain
Blow out your headpiece, and break out quick on the plane
Seal up your coffins, and celebrate with champagne
Get my drink, Absolut, cranberry juice
Paranoid by rug spots, you see the purple moose
You smokin sherm or what? I paralyze that butt
Lick my d-head, you girls still pee in the bed
Yo take that wig off, yo punk let me see that caesar
Keep it real.. represent what? My nuts (3X)

I gets more wreck, than ? kids in baby's Pampers
Your wife is banned for leavin bras in my hampers
That heffer's ugly, plastic why you still bug me
I'm on Melrose, Nicole's takin sun strolls
Black girls with weaves, white girls with flat butts
With the name H-O-M-O spelled in your name
You was a woman one time, man I know your game
With panties stuck up, sweat leakin in your crotch
Collard greens you wet pig, you can't eat that much
I shut you down, your whole face two o'clock
Have your girl on sunset, in Denny's suckin cock
With white pumps up, blonde wigs rottin in the trunks
That homeless monkey, Barbie doll crystal junkie
I'm no joke and have respect for your kinfolks
Tie your tubes back, my scope is on your asscrack
You got paid for doodoo, that package rap was wack
Yeah yeah, you know what? Yeah
Keep it real.. represent what? My nuts (4X)
That's right, nine-six and seven (Reverend Tom)
Representin the scrotum (Octagon)
All the hairs under the testicles (The SharkMan)

You was kinda confused huh?
You didn't know what to do
All excited over these football players and baseball players
Whassup? You lookin for a million dollars or somethin?
Man you kinda confused
Freak mode! I'm in the set, so let em feel
Touch my private, my thing made of steel
Shootin gism, she ride like a Geo Prism
I'm out in Cali, San Bernardino Valley
I'm on the hill, not North in Peekskill
Big Willie servin, now tell me how you pimps feel
I'm in the Cadillac, drivin in a droptop
People don't know my style, watch when they heads bop
I'm on the highway, girls pull em down my way
Credit cards and checks, man she get paid on Friday
The woman's out, the Phantom pushin more clout
I'm watchin him with Sam, drinkin Guinness Stout
Bourban booze, green alligator shoes
Union comissioned sex, government intelligence
What you see girl, that Benz is irrelevant
Materialistic, ugly man is plastic
No class, in a suit, cost rather cheap
Got the nerve to blow the horn and he try to beep
Interfere, in my spot, and he's comin near
She's in the white boots, breathin in my ear
Chorus: Kool Keith
Make up your mind, who you want to pump the butt (4X)

No infections, condom style, I got no yeast
Worldwide trunk funk, no jazz on the East
Breakin honies down, mackin here to Petersberg
Virginia Slim, turn the freaks out in Lynchburg
With brown bootie, Joe Smith, hit from Pittsburgh
The right player, even if I choose odds
Let me shuffle jackpots, women pick the cards
Your hydraulic butt, bounce like a six-trey
I'm on the case, jealous man steppin in my way
Hot pursuit, why she play herself? Get the boot
Actin like Troop, he say he signed with a group
He wrote for Babyface, did songs, toured with Snoop
.. lyin to you to get through
Droppin them old lines, his breath smell like doodoo
I got a style if a brother wanna know
Smokin that stank blunt, you still sniffin blow
Nose runnin on time with green slime
Step in the club, I throw urine on your mind
Big Luciano, diamond rings on the grand piano
Girls flock and guys hop on the other jock
I'm in a two-door, with bass comin through your block
Sound kicks, I got the fly broads in the mix
California butt, MC's suckin more what
Like Gerald LeVert, you try to make it work
Jheri Curl Jones, spendin cash on a skirt
Plan to win, whassup with Uncle Ben?
Brother is slab, fatback bacon
Still fakin, his voice chords achin
You know I'm perplex, exotic on Ampex
Dogstyle champ, hittin booty for butt sex
I can't disguise myself like Michael Jackson
The flasher, are you ready for action?
Chorus: Kool Keith
Make up your mind, who you want to pump the butt (3X)
Make up your mind, who you want to pump it

I got a summons, my clothes is off, I'm butt-naked
In a discotechque, don't tell me ladies can't take it
Just to have my drawers in a overcoat
My El Dorado lean, the black Caddy float
Down the hill with Frankie Dolla Bill
Honies in red zone, tell me how them drawers feel
Suckin on the hippie, on the Mississippi
Econo Lodge, a cheap way to get a quickie
Five and five, equal ten
Add twenty up, I'm back in the spot again
Blowin it up, I drop my own bomb
Two big green mitts, and tails on my arm
You in my way my man, yo B excuse me
I didn't call your girl, why accuse me?
I think you're insecure, not sure
If your girlfriend's home, if she's knockin at my door
Back in your ride, no apartment, no place to wash
You can't clean, (tell em black)
He don't know yet, my discipline, how to act
Stack with fume, and twenty-four flicks
You can't win, takin shots like the Knicks
I'm old enough with skills to be your daddy
Go ask grandma, your freaky Aunt Sally
Pretty woman standin there with a ugly man
I don't wanna shake his hand

Drugs,Spankmaster,2001.0,"(Back in the 70's, it was all about drugs..)
Tie my arm up
 at night between shows
Takin soda tops off of soda pops
I used to be up all night in the living room
Smokin a lot of weed with the Four Tops
Makin collect calls back home to my pops
My little brother said, ""Keith - you need to stop!""
I knew something was wrong
When I gave away my VHS and sold a pair of my socks
The IRS callin me, gettin on my nerve, I was warned by Redd Foxx
My girl, ""Keith you seen my diamond rings in the jewelry box?""
I don't know; last night you and Chaka Khan was in here sniffin blow
I was in the room sweatin thinkin about the rent playin bingo
The landlord said the first of the month, we gotta go
Packed up my bag and met Darryl Strawberry in the mall
I told James Brown stop smokin angel dust and the pis-tal
He wanted to go up to the Olive Garden and start a resteraunt brawl
""Mary J. Blige, my son don't accept them type of phone calls""
I can't come out tonight, my Bic lighter don't light
I heard you and K-Ci in the background
I'm screamin did the cops come and break up the fight?
All the crack and the drugs, make me feel, the way I feel
All the crack and the drugs.. drugs..
All the crack and the drugs, make me feel, the way I feel
All the crack and the drugs..
Freebasin eighteen pounds of coke with Marvin Gaye
Put that on the table, let's parlay
With Smokey Robinson and 
Bootsy
, lightin aluminum foil
Watch that crack pipe boil
With Richard Pryor we burned the house down gettin higher
Don't think I'm bluffin
Meet Tommy Lee Curtis, Keith Richards, Eddie Kingwards and 
David Ruffin
Rick James was in the kitchen lightin the flame
And Mousey's trapped with Cuba Gooding Sr
I don't want nobody to know my name
I kept glasses on it was a damn shame
Losin weight, fallin out in big arenas
The same guy who used to deal to me
Deals to Whitney and Bobby, meet Ike and Tina
Every Saturday mansions was packed, ""Hey Jimmy you got the smack?""
Shut up! You don't know how to act
All the crack and the drugs, make me feel, the way I feel
All the crack and the drugs.. drugs..
All the crack and the drugs, make me feel, the way I feel
All the crack and the drugs..
Crystal methane.. and heroin and quaaludes..
A relapse, of your mind
Angel dust, ecstasy, sniffin coke baby..
Got the best of me-heee-heeeee..
I got rits, withdrawals, my symptoms of pain
Rush me to the hosss-pi-tallll..
Oooh, ooh baby
Get this monkey off of MY MY MY BACK!
And get him off of me

Regular Girl,Sex Style,1997.0,"Yo money
Yeah whassup Kool Keith?
Yo that girl Kadiva gon' come to your house
With.. blonde hair and boots
Tell her rent a cheap room on Sunset Boulevard
For $16.95 - I ain't tryin to get no Madrian no Marriott
Or all that higher stuff
Yo we can go on cheaper man
I know somethin for like $10.99 man
It's a hotel with roaches in it and everything
It's almost near skid row

Buttnaked! Girls walk Sunset with they ass out
I start Cadillacs with suits, wear my mask out
With brims tilted, I finger pop the whole block
Make freaks wear wigs, and put the rubbres on my cock
You see me out there, with big balls like Rosey Grier
Players cream, I pull panties out your wet dreams
Get deep in cracks, and wash em out like Mr. Clean
Bring your Massengil, the public think I'm very ill
Like Jimmy Z, posin naked for the FCC
I'm not no basketball star, your girl watch me pee
Clock me like cops, every time my sperm drops
She's in my face with thongs, chewin lollipops
I'll hit that butt on the low, just like Monica
Play three tunes and let her blow on my harmonica
I'm out here, you rollin fake in Union Square
I'll make you go blonde, brunettes runnin down they hair
Chorus: sung by Kool Keith (repeat 2X)
Regular girl, is so boring (get out my face)
Regular girl, you never turn me on (working late)

You saw my porno flick, nutsacs banged up on your TV
Your girl pulled her panties off real quick, tryin to see me
She wants an autograph, a part with my anal staff
You scream test for AIDS, stretch marks make me laugh
Sign your contracts for Willie, smoke a big Phillie
I'm too old for young girls, gigglin actin silly
I'm Sugar Daddy, your aunt know me word duke
Your moms at my hotel, her bra is real cute
Dressed in G-strings, she's scopin me, eatin fruit
She licked my balls, I came like Niagara Falls
Brought her tickets to Prince show instead of Lou Rawls
Her pelvis grind, she smile show me panty lines
I'll smack that butt, the pro spank it different times
Like Max Steiner hardcore it's on the dirty floor
Make you scream for stiff rods, you don't want no more
Penetration, I don't do that on your menustration
I wind movies back, you smile, addin lubrication
You know your steelo, orgies doin three people
Kodak action, Black Tail, butt satisfaction
You lookin good sweet cheeks..
Chorus

I turned the Lakers off, you can't stop my afterparty
A fifth of vodka, and latex, drink your Bacardi
I serve it well through tubes and watch your rectum swell
Service your clits with steel, machines keep it real
Got that ramrod, that's pumpin through your back hard
You be seein cum stains on Sunset Boulevard
My rubber send streaks and heels off your girl's feets
You not psychadelic wimp, I'm still your girl's pimp
That's part interest, magnificent, mind power
I got nuts that clean kill, let me take my shower
Wash off my pubic, and let the females do my nails
Watch naked legs in chairs and enter soft tails
Wear stockin caps with maps and shoft for soft cracks
Lift off your hairpeace, while milk squirts up on your weave
You know my skin needs butter, your cheeks are popcorn
I get deep, go run in butt like the unicorn
Rodeo anus banger, quick with the middle finger
Her tampons drop down between her Maxi
I left tips for cocked up legs in the taxi
Yo take her home cab driver, here's her panties

Intro [1999],Black Elvis/Lost in Space,1999.0,"This is the intro
Why are you looking hard with a hood on and Timberland boots
Staring at me for one hour -
- when you could walk up and shake my hand? Why?
Why are you making those mean faces in your videos
With the fish lens effects?
 Why?
Why do you walk in the clubs with 30 people around you
And stand in the corner, with big bodyguards for no reason
Why?
Why do you pull up, in valet parking, with your Benz, that is rented?
Fronting on a cellular phone that doesn't work - why?
Why are you smirking up your face, making obnoxious facial scenes
Like I supposed to be scared (supposed to be scared) - why? (Why?)
Who are you? (Who are you?)
I circle like sharks while y'all panic - I cruise the Atlantic
Y'all think I'm spaced out, human from the Earth planet
That's right tomorrow I plan to boo your shows at the Apollo
You follow, in the crowd the audience is hollow
Never ending while I'm mind bending resending you the first verse
That you was worse, a drag queen with a purse, unrehearsed
Don't try to reverse, harsh words send you to a nurse
Emergency with urgency, non-rappable comics and
Half of y'all out there got me vomitin (BLEH)
Turnin Islamic and Dominican, Indian Cambodian watchin Nickelodeon TV
You see me lookin at me grabbin my pee-pee, y'all still sleepy
With hard faces tryin to look creepy?
You are the monsters of the original Mr. Softie, ice cream trucks
{*sung - background*} Open your eyes, tell me why can't you see?
Why are you hating a player like Keith
Why can't you see that your fakin is weak?
Open your eyes, tell me why can't you see?
Why?
Your exaggeration perpetration levels are at exaggerating full speed
Why must I answer to you evil monsters?
{Hey Keith, we, are The Official Haters
And you have sunken into The Official Hating Zone
In which you witness the most salt shaking
Behind your back speaking
Record criticizing cock blocking
In the club costume jewelry wearing
Valet parked Lexus renting
Undercover, star-struck
No game-having fake Versace shirt wearing
Motel hell living
False Muslim being, Jungle Fever having
Pork-eating demon people
Our purpose here on your planet is to BRING YOU DOWN
If you can evade this evil, you'll be the man}",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-intro-1999-lyrics
Professional Photographer,The Personal Album,UnKnown,"Honey what's up, this is Kool Keith
Gonna take you on vacation
Get your bags ready, I'll call you in 2 hours

Baby you look good under the tripod
, directors we work hard
Edit your film, every angle like elegant angel, great shot
Hold your pose, honey be professional
Watch your earrings dangle for the camera, hold it right there
You got the answer
As Tina Turner would say tonight you're my ""Private Dancer""
On the premises properly, I deal with models
Like three-part harmony, with skill like Debrye
Hair cover the side of your face
I get to see just a little more from the back side
Show me one of your eyes, the professional photographer

Professional photographer, professional

I'm beyond you changin your clothes
Put this mask on, c'mere Catwoman, take that off, climb into those
Now you an action figure with boots up to your hips
With a Halle Berry haircut with light green over your eyelashes
I wanna see how you pose
It depends on the perfect outfit and how much you expose
My perfect Hollywood grand prize star, the deal, we gotta get it closed
Cindy put a little extra makeup on her nose
Scars we cover, that's a cute tattoo, everything goes
Move the sparkle shorts a little honey
It's better when everything shows... the professional photographer


Hold your face, c'mon show me your confidence
Relax you don't have real tits
Your blouse look hot, it's magnified
Jim give me her black and white prints
I love those panties girl, where you get those?
Red and white your tassles, that show on the side, with lil' peppermints
FHM's greatest, a sensational hit, you're the latest
To the public you're awesome, how can I explain this?
The portrait is a winner, we gotta do somethin with that
I love it give me a little more body, turn to the side and twist
I can see it comin, magazines everywhere
Start signing autographs right now miss, the professional photographer",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-professional-photographer-lyrics
I’m Dangerous,The Personal Album,UnKnown,"(Dan-ger) Kool... Keith!
You know... it's me again

Black tie affair (dan-ger) girl you better be there
Wit'cha sparkle dress, your hair done escorted by the best
Wall Street navy blue pinstripe professional comfort you touch my chest
Knock wine glasses together, baby I'm impressed
The chaperone with executives upstairs, makin the calls to Rome
Check my messages when you get home
The rap music little kids play won't last in the mature zone
Panties stay lookin good, you know I'm mature bone
I'm dangerous
(Dan-ger) You know I'm dangerous

Dangerous, bigger than rap and rock with keys to the large cities
Women change they locks, hand me the duplication
Look at tears comin down they eyes, tellin me the information
On the balcony, way above these streets
I rub backs in satin sheets
My vocals like fur lay down on satin beats
The international master, with orientals rubbin my feets
Excuse me may I enter your dining room area?
The kind that wanna marry ya
With overflows that get private rooms in the Poconos
Your girlfriends get back stage passes
I sign your pictures at all my shows, I'm dangerous
(Dan-ger) I'm dangerous

Dangerous, extreme hotel bills, I'm real neutral at the Sheraton
Turkey with dijon mustard, your legs with moisturizer
Blueberry pie and ice cream, you know you my custard
Many out there lack luster, the rusher, headlinin over Usher
The 16 sweet bars, the three verse buster
Candles burn, you hold the martini, shirt under the plaid blazer
Madison Avenue with the Bernini, after work party
You look young like a teenager
Business lady with the Anita Baker haircut and a Coke bottle body
I'm dangerous

I'm so... dangerous...

Mmm-hmm!
I think I'mma show him somethin tonight
A lap dance I would say
Yeah, that's what I'mma do
Yeahhhh..

I'm like a freak from Hunt's Point, the Bronx and the Goat
Wear my drawers in tight mode, naked with no coat
Walkin around, I see youse about to lose her
That honey with white boots, and hair like Medusa
Brown-skin fine, I drink her body like wine
And throw the wax on it, and watch two cheeks shine
I drunk a forty, I'm up in here feelin naughty
I like the go-go girl, go 'head work it shorty
I got no time to trick, on the average girl
I'm in paradise, caught up, in the booty world
And for you regular honies, tryin to play fly
I ain't no Chemical no Bank in your human eye
I like my spot, everybody's butt naked
Pump with G-strings, watchin hot momma shake it
I got my beer, viewin from the back rear
Yo brotherman, pass it right over here
I got to ease off the stress, like a eight to five
Keepin it real vexed, them panties wanna get live
Change the pace up, yo Jimmy turn the bass up

I see you scopin me, the fourth time you cut your eye
Let the brother to catch wreck, then tell the man goodbye
I'm next on the menu, runnin up and in you
With seven rubbers on me, don't try to discontinue
We gots to bump and grind, crank up the R. Kelly
Delicious kickin, no leather like I'm Fonzarelli
I order two drinks to think, while you show me pink
Summer Eve breeze and WOO when it don't stink
I'm in the mix, like Funky-master Flex
I'm shootin gizm, then after you can pick up next
I watch you shake it, like palm trees in California
Now you a lady, mature and I'm rubbin on ya
I got my Phantom mask, I'm on the dolo
I slipped in my tip in, and 
bone a sweetie look like Yo-Yo
She had a good time, knees bent in the chair
She said, ""Get wild - I like it when you pull my hair""
I gave her cream, and rubbed it on her black boots
I see a packed house in different color body suits
I'm in the front row, chillin on the down low
Checkin her dogstyle, she's scoped by an ass pro
I'm from the back kid, smooth with tons of grease
Denver and Texas, and Cali on back to East
She hittin switches, and watch she make it lowride
Zoot, zoot, zzzzzzzt
Chorus 1.5X

It's three o'clock, the morning shift's about to come
Watchin Goldie lapdance, that grey hiney ain't no slum
I gets my workout, my slickest hand from every angle
She's on the job right, cutiepie sippin Tango
I gotta peel for real, a hundred dollar bill
I'm comin straight up, and not for a breakfast meal
This ain't no Burger King, this ain't no White Castle
Not like some ugly girls in Bentleys tryin to give a hassle
I like the slot machine, bustin nuts mean
Slippery wet lubrication like Valvoline
I'm pullin nylon, yo dead up G, to the side
Feelin soft flesh, I'm hard, I'mma let her ride
Jump up and down, get live like House of Pain
Leavin em so wet, the silk with a tan stain
I reach a climax, she's happy with her orgasms
Go on girl!

Stare at the tits, they kill a lot a niggas money
Ugly and rich, you gotta fuck em in the ass, they like it a lot

She'll be late, every movie shit in the hotel quick
Dip inside her heart she wanna suck your dick
Get her ass licked
Play hopscotch, look at her look at your watch
Make sure its late sucka, stick your hand in her ass motherfucker
Move fast motherfucker

Look at the stars, they wanna be naked, doggystyle with they ass out
They dream of naked photos, ready to pass out
You gotta pull your dick out at the restaurant in front of they aunt
And jerk off with your balls smackin the windows of the Mitsubishi Galant
Women are hot, like motherfuckin bananas in they ass
Is that what they want?
Never say pussy or cunt, take em out to lunch
Pull the thong to the side, at brunch
Show her your pubic hair, dress up ill
Decorate your nuts with Captain Crunch
Tell her easy on the genitals, give her two minutes
Tell her Captain Munch
Pull your zipper up fast, bend over and look over her ass
Wear a baseball jersey, lick her asshole with a catcher's mask
Perform with weed and liquor, some people prefer hash
Put on a condom, stick your celery sticks in her gash
Anally I stick it, marshmallows and lemonheads in they ass
Nothin simple, Ginuwine slow with Dru Hill, the right tempo
Fuck goin to dinner and shit, sittin at a table, rent a porno movie
Yo with Rocco Siffredi, fuckin top models cum on they navel
Lean your woman up against the sanitation truck
Fuck with 18 balls on the pool table
(18 balls on the pool table)

Increase with the golden showers surprise there's nothing more than
A pretty woman wantin sexy men to piss in her eyes
Fuck you standard gentleman nigga, you fuck it up for the real guys
Big jeans don't matter, you gotta fuck in the bathroom with robes
Cum all between her ass cheeks
With the suits and ties, take a break for ginseng
Feed the dimepiece, give her some TV dinners
Share your French fries
Be honest in your underwear, never tell her lies
Cuz she's wet already, all freaks love to smell your scrotum

She's not dressed properly
She's always wearin jeans, and this is a company
Where you wear dresses, and you look neat and come in
With your briefcase
And we're taking cutbacks.. somebody gotta get dropped

Capital investments by sequence automatic mechanical problem secure
Space investor, Wall Street Journal analysist
The rates of companies by speed Paine-Webber
Merryl Lynch, no other than Solomon Brothers
Banking system with my computer wisdom
Immaculate suit, pinstriped, with my shirt and tie
Girls know I'm fly -- on the A-X-1 new floppy disk
""Hello? There's somebody out there to see you""
No, tell her to call me back
I'm busy with the President of the United States
Discussing more rates on a higher level
Don't give me feedback, I don't need that
Two trips to Costa Rica, I'll be a week back
Before you sign a new act, find out if they wack
Your budget will be low, and you'll be fired, highly retired
I'm the new boss of this company girl

With a loan from General Mills
I would start a new NBA team Baldwin Hills
The Baldwin Hills Spacemen
Lime green uniforms with a orange basketball logo
Me coaching the group solo, that's right, dolo
With the comissioner of the basketball
Passin y'all in my ASR Rolls Royce
Y'all can't stop my voice and opinion, here's a card and my phone extension
Not to mention I ripped up four tickets to the Grammy awards
I had pasta with my new team and my roster
Agents beware, I'm talkin to Shaq behind the Lakers back
Michael Jordan I'm important, keep tapes recordin
Buyin baseball stadiums, talkin to Joe Morgan
Cincinatti Reds, I'm over your heads
Call my limo Nancy, make it fancy, I'm in a rush
No time for coffee, ice cream from Mr. Softie

Tom Hanks calls the base of Keith in the UK
We sold a lot of Mercedes Benz's
And BMW's to the small starving communities
Even as an import, it's just a regular cab in foreign countries
Materialistic for just the ignorant ones only the United States
I'm goin to lunch, I'll be right back
{The girls don't like the job!}
Cutback on time
Employees research files, tryin to find my styles
Sippin on a glass of Sprite
Toni Braxton wanna sing Pride with me tonight
I gotta work late, the office, the kids, the dog
Puppies, groceries, hopin these things get done by the end of the week
I been through the week, did you book my airline flight assistant Terry?
You'll get no record deal actin like Neneh Cherry, back to work don't flirt
Give me them passes to the James Brown concert
Front row seats at least, PLEASE don't bother me I need peace

This song is about everybody involved in hip-hop
People that just came into this business so late
All the DJs that don’t know what they are doing, that don’t know real records
And everybody that think they can rap, wasting time
This song is called ‘Goodbye Rap.’
This song is the last song
I quit rap, couldn’t find competition
I threw hip-hop in the garbage
The rap hall of fame had to pay homage
While everyone was fat cookin’ sausage
I was wearin’ ostrich
Rap ain’t been the same since I had it hostage
The last song I guess was written wrong
First class flight I’m leavin’ MCs to fight over who’s the best, I’m gone
To a secret shelter in space
An astronaut ready to take off
Go home to the Bat Cave and take my cape off
A rock star, still I will shock tomorrow
Rap went out the door, all MCs cry with tears
Miss my metaphor
Inspiration gone now they gotta see artificial tissue on tour
From the Bronx, true story
Ask Bambaataa and Kool Herc
I don’t rap no more, I don’t rap no more
That’s it
And the downloaders you get no credit
You destroyed your own thing all over
Remember that. You ain’t really fly
The ciphers… WHACK
Everybody samplin’ old man records… WHACK
Everybody tryin’ to collect records… WHACK
Everybody trying to get up on open mics… WHACK
All the DJs playing trendy music… WHACK
Commercial artists trying to collaborate with pop artists… WHACK

American and European, national champion
Kool Keith, you know who I am
The master man, Willie Biggs, (big status)
Droppin nine-six and seven, (big status)
Skill.. Lotto winners
I taught New York City, the five boroughs how to rap
You can take that back, and pull them thongs our your rectum crack
I'm Poppa Large
, big daddy, big penis in a Caddy
Retro petrol, I run that whole metro-politan area
Burnin ya, the style is scarin ya
You don't know, and half of y'all brothers can't flow
I'm Texas Swift, down South, they call me Frankie Joe
Keep pushin rigs, Mack trucks, drop off your girl's wigs
I'm strictly business, no gimmicks, a rhymin expert
No common style, or wack logo, cheap hip-hop shirt
You best to be prepared, paperclips, on your mouth
I rock Virginia, tag 
Atlanta, 95 South
Then hit Miami, let the girls feel my stiff jammy
I'm national kid, girls like the way I dress

Freddie's Dead
Rap style pee stain, like yellow spots on your bed
I'm Jay Gloom, on the streets, still walkin doo-doo
You can't stop me, step off, now let your girl jock me
I ride a bus and tail just like a Kawasaki
Motorcycle, swift with gloves, I'm here to damage ya
Political style flop, your child play is amateur
Yo take that word, I rip your anus, youse a herb
I get in rectum, zoom focus on your whole room
Wear green capes and walk in clubs like 
I'm Dr. Dooom
Handblock double switch monkey style, flying horsemen
Crab leg, walk on top of rappers, then I cross men
I be the Silver Surfer, glidin with a fly leather
With gold chains, my glasses fog in the rainy weather
We do this like Brutus, I make you say, ""Who dis?""
The man on the mic's right, cover your styles tonight
I do my duty destruct, take skin off your booty
Masquerade man is ill, Keith spinnin reel to reel
(Who played the number tonight? I put six on a five
Shoulda combinated, go 'head baby)
Chorus 2X
Big Willie, Big Willie
Big Willie-heyyyeah-heyyy

No matter how mean or point blank hard you look
I cover my eye, retarded bugged like I'm Captain Hook
Like Vincent Price

Your crew is rat turd, 
your parakeet flow is bird
At my night show lick my pubic hair, tell me word
I'm basic nasty, with tight moves, smart like Lassie
Classical winner bass, pumpin while your sound is thinner
I kick back, with drawers off, invite your girl to dinner
Get sexy raw, the champagne pours even more
No forcefield, I rhyme erotic, feel myself on tour
I'm so delicate, countin cash, too intelligent

Gon' play what I got to play tomorrow
Do this right, yeah)

Snap back with back slaps, bypass them corny raps
Perhaps some action, maxin in the Turb' relaxin
Unique investigator, sportin Mauri alligators
From here to Virginia, clubs when I step up in ya
Tailor-made from my toes, to my shoulder blade
Extreme act up on front stage, make em back up
You get that workout, that head piece gettin slapped up
Now turn yo' lip up, you drop that mic you turn yo' lip down
I spin on stage like, blowin mics, make you sit down
From here to North Carolina, 95 to South Carolina
Atlanta Georgia Florida flowin down, like I'm water
Mexican Indian, fly girls, the Puerto Ricans
Pum-pum-pump the eight-oh-eight-oh-eight-oh-eight-oh peakin
Now start spectacular, expert, them legs will work
Bronx Bomber watch em strip, Eddy tip that fine mama
Hydraulics expand, while drums bang like Gap Band
I clap hand, take his mic, give him five to my man
Switch his work to talent shows, I do concerts
Light up shirts like 4th of July atomic fireworks
Extraction attack, white backpacks on wack macks

My name is Cadillac Clifton Santiago
At the bodega, I need a fat sandwich major
You know my switches, Impala drop, scrapin sparks
I mack these bitches, white Asian Puerto Rican
Black Russian Haitian, with jungle fever, I ain't hatin
A cup more Coppertone, I'm cappin on your kinky ear
Bitches they stare, cause I'm WILD cock diesel
Boy hopin that I recognize they girls in this song
Bodda-boom-bodda-bing bodda-bing-da-bing-bong, yo check it
I call up Televas-quez, he's gettin ass
And when he finish, call up Santiago and bring the cash
I'm out to desecrate, move wild Western state
I got your sister lickin ass, suckin hairy balls
My occupation downfall and bringin niggas bad luck
My name is Clifton Santiago salesman at the mall
I'm full ?, a hundred niggas deep up in the movies
Like Greg I'm groovy, yo Bobby sit and watch the movie
And kick that ho out with that one tooth, lookin goofy
She's on my tab, better make popcorn to pay her half
They know I'm wild, I don't mess around with chickenheads
Barney and Fred, Wilma Betty Bam-Bam Pebbles
(On different channels, lyrics)
Chorus

Slidin through the back of the do'
You didn't see me in the midst, with my pistol, Ev Dog
Flyin heads is my job, I will clobber you
Walkin backwards, shoes and jacket turned around
Gloves on, opposite hands
Can you recognize me?
I wear Blu Blocker shades so you can't see what I see
Holdin a mirror up, so I don't run into nobody
But I don't care, cause I know karate (HI-YAH!)
Vulcan Pinch and that Yoga too
Don't you know I'm Stretch Armstrong in the flesh
With a mocha tan, and a criminal mind?
Like Chairhead Chippendale, yeah
Comedy? Yes, no? Maybe not
But if I got a lip don't zip
Baggy jeans on, walkin through a crowded room
Avoid all contact with me, click boom!
People scatter stop that chatter they resort to screamin
Am I dreamin, drunk or just zooted out?
I need help call 9-1-1 pronto
My modus operandi is complete
One down, many to go, others to show
That Noggin' Nodders ain't no fuckin circus sideshow

These are the things that robots carry
To get they hair done
Eyes made up
Difference effects to their bodies
Sometimes, too many to even know
The life of a robot
Yo, don't waste my time on the phone, girl I'm goin to bed
That movie resteraunt you need cash that game is dead
I pull your wig off, you step back, you have a tantrum
I hold your rent money, contacts I hold for ransom
Cut off your phone bill, Merecedes wrecked, in the Mobil
That's on the real deal, your credit's off, how you feel?
Give me my meat back, now think back, you sing on four-track
Your mother's callin, for WIC checks, she soundin wack
I bought your first food, high-class, you was rude
House with no heat on, with slippers on, you walkin nude
Back with your girlfriends I cancel banks stop your shoppin
You work with kneepads, you loose stiff on Soul Train poppin
Your head keep boppin, you face out, with purple tracin
I put you out, we can end this at the gas station
Let's do this now, not impressed, I'ma show you how
Chorus: Kool Keith (repeat 2X)
I'm seein robots, passin by, everyday (I'm seein robots!)
I'm seein robots, lah lah lah lah lah lah
I'm seein robots, passin by, everyday (I'm seein robots!)
You drive in Hollywood, long hair, Buick Regal
License in California, ID's phony not illegal
Livin with roommates, you camp out, with paper plates
Broke Panasonic speakers missin playin Puff and Mase
Clear up yo' acne, girl what yo, how you act B
Call police up, tell them what?  How you tried to smack me
I'm movin thorough on the freeway callin you on three way
Watchin my back got your friends all on instant replay
You say you married sewed your weave in, yo where's your ring at?
Interscope records got your demo girl, where you sing at?
Pull out your masters, your DAT's, all you have is cats
Pet little turtles in your bedroom, enough for headroom
Usin your restroom when, company come, that's your best room
I stay the dopest while you party hard, losin focus
Starin in mirrors combin hair, with the kids on welfare
I watch your mailbox like Vietnam guerilla warfare
That's not your real hair, rip credit cards, I don't care
Liposuction, Jenny Craig, is yo' introduction
Volkswagen fog up, your dirty engine Boo smog up
You hit the malls and, with chip phones, makin calls and
I'm audi 5, yeah
Chorus
I'm seein robots, passin by, everyday (I'm seein robots!)
I'm seein -- goo goo gah gah, them ugly kids call me da-da
Missin they father while you try to pawn the ring and phones and
You probably Jonzin, gettin greedy, eatin at Tony Rhome's and
Stuffin your mouth out with fat pigs, you smokin cigs
Rip out your buttcrack, no bras out, to fit your back
Skinny legs, trip on, you get your grub and rip on
The DJ spin the club is wack, yo they close at ten
They turned the lights on, I seen your mug, you looked bugged
Close your face, I see your rims, I know you freebase!

With mechanical legs, fake hips, implants

Yeah..
I like that little leopard furry outfit
I love it
You gonna get pregnant wearin that
Put on this blindfold
Turn around, don't look at me
Pull your panties to the side
I know this girl with boots on, she's turned on by wearin G-strings
She likes her thongs with my fingers all between her cheeks
She go-go dance, strip at clubs on the row for weeks
Shakin her fannies, come here girl, let me fill them panties
Spread your legs, and cock the booty, spread the pink fa-rutti
Not Ray Moore, no matress here, baby on the floor
With helmets and mask, and grease up in that anus fast
Back door delivery, the mailman remember me
Don't front now, them breasts are ready, I'ma milk the cow
With rockets that blow, paralyze your anal sockets
My fantasy is hidin used condoms in your pockets
While you chill, here's a towel, plus your Massengil
That's word like Pete Rock's, let's freshen up that funk box
I pump like diesel fuel, stamina speed, strong as a ox
Takin a shower, run the steam water for a hour
That's word I'm naked you can best believe I don't fake it
Pull off your bra straps, and jerk off on your pretty kneecaps
Yeah..
Chorus: Kool Keith (repeat 2X)
Can I see your panties girl?  You wanna take em off
Dye your hair blonde, hook up your weave and call Steve
For the photo session (yeah..)

Got my tripod set up for photographs, you get wet
Pull my porno tapes, while you listen to Keith Sweat
That's no joke, I do construction now your rectum's broke
No matter how famous the anal beads are for your anus
Your girlfriend is sloppy, a dyke, tryin to be so cocky
I stuck a broom between her punchin coochie like I'm Rocky
She was excited from the rip out, she pulled my tip out
My cape is on with latex, I make vaginas flip out
Open your rear end, with tools before you count to ten
That's word to moo moo, know how I'm trained to move that boo boo
Back them two boobs, you on the tape with seven dudes
Your temperature's more beyond to sleep with Michael Jackson
You want interviews, in locker rooms, movie action
Camcorders R. Kelly, or Russell peein on your belly
Smelly socks from Laker players, you can suck they jocks
I walk in projects, and underwears on Bronx blocks
Send Tampex FedEx while I slip on condoms you drink Beck's
Hold up your butt right, cause Vinica can make you tight
_All Night Long_, like Mary Jane, finger poppin girls
Luscious drawers, I keep my penis movin in your jaws
Swallow it baby
Chorus 1.5X

Intensive care, you're pretty, climbin on the toilet seat
Puttin fingers in buttholes, through your cracks I defeat
Word is bond, remove your stainfree it'll turn me on
Put on your freaky jacket, bend over, let me smack it
Move in your room while my penis stretch, hit the moon
Open your back and see them buns shine when you jack up
On Greyhound buses we can check in at a sleazy motel
Sign contracts, and do a dirty scene, in a hotel
Manufactured, distribution while you keep on douchein
We'll make you a star, we'll film tonight, at this bar
Two hundred men, wackin off, you on the tablecloth
She's in the center dressed up, like it's cold in winter
No domination, hide your panties in the Amtrak station
Shoot off your load, see the Caddy comin down the road
Baby got back, rub my hand up all up in that crack
Nurse that breast, tittie milk can give me stimulation
I throw your legs your perfume, give me motivation
I drive surface.. yeah!

Throwin rhymes in spirals like Joe Klecko

And heads I clip off, in rap leave a bloodstain
A bigger pain, you would need novacaine
Bite off Rakim, you copy Big Daddy Kane
You know my steelo, I rhyme against a million people
Who think they equal, disguisin as Jamaican people
Fakin, funkin, you're pedigree, your beat is sunk in

You oughta know -- how, I, feel
That's wack, with bookbags, packed on your back
Video Vibe, my skin is black BET
Program your channels, your grandkids wanna see me
Freakin status, freakin styles, freakin flows
Freakin foes, freakin lyrics, freakin spirits
I make a deaf person hear it
Duplicate you demonstrate, what I used to make
Remakes I watch, your crew'll imitate
Motivate still skills to pay bills
Creative sauce, watch out, I'm your boss
On Panasonic like Steve, style bionic
You get to workin, your head bop, you not jerkin
You be out lurkin for danger, in my Ranger
You think I'm bugged man? With Catwoman, like a stranger
Packed with speed, supersonic level read
Steelo jets and Bill Blass like rockets
In your pockets, damagin your brain sockets

Like Mobile, settin up shop in Alabama
For proper grammar, my style Arm & Hammer
Strong computer, underground like Roto Rooter
Fools critics they mimic, copy, sloppy
MC's get hurt, you blockhead, try to stop me
Digital thinkin, you're blinkin, career sinkin
Old like Mod Squad, you rap like Lincoln
Sideburns turned, you catchin ringworm
A heavy virus, worser than, hepatitis
Schizophrenic like ten people out the clinic
Yankee Stadium uptown, you can't win the pennant
I do construction, you pack up your whole production
Your lips are ready, your girl has a nice suction
Pack her bags pack her bags pack her bags right
Pack her bags pack her bags pack her bags left
Your style is A, B, C-D
E-F, G-H, I-J-K, L-M-N-O-P, Q-R-S

Suckin your breasts your secret fantasy
Is to suck my dick in the pickup truck, and have sex
While you bump your CD by Next

Spread your legs wide, I see the pink in your pussy flesh
Open it down South, wipe my cum from around your mouth
Watch my testicles regurgitate

Supergalactic lover!

I was your boyfriend girl lieutenant lover flight commander
Member of the air force, remember when I bought you a Porsche?
Diamond rings with roses, I put pearls in your noses
Put you in heels, paid your school loans and tons of bills
I ripped eight thousand threw a stack up in the fireplace
You couldn't believe it, your mom was there with a sad face
I had you accounts, three million with big amounts
You wrecked your Impala, I seen you at the beauty parlor
Gave you a check engagement ring, four million dollars
Your friends were surprised, your sister couldn't believe her eyes
I walked in with cape, with jewels, on, you know I'm the captain
Outside by the Cadillac three brothers rappin soundin wack and
I kept on steppin legend status, you know my rep and
I see you at eight, turn your pager off, don't be late

Supergalactic lover!
Comin from the projects on the hill
Supergalactic lover!
In my monkey-green ragtop Seville

Exquisite background, with spaceship pictures up on the wall
You changin lingerie quick, you put on pumps, standin tall
Tell me what you thinkin, at the table while you drinkin
You got stress, tell me love, you need a fly dress
Important reasons I will care for you in different seasons
Daytona Beach, catchin the sun, layin on a pillow
Stop your days of worryation lookin out the window
Captain of program, girl I run this Enterprise
Open your eyes, now you realize, now put on thigh highs
Tie your boots up tight, very tight with all your might
Come in the front row, you're a star in a private show
I taught you well, gave you earrings that I bought you well


Sippin real smooth wine, galactic glasses, wearin maskes
Her suit is armor leather jacket, I'mma wear a bomber
Dark black hats, remember Cato and the Green Hornet
I step up on it, test the flight switch, move a nice switch
Adjust the tempo makin complex into somethin simple
A masquerade party while bartenders, pass Bacardi
Lemon juice or orange bintz, parked with a sunroof
Brown ragtop, spaceship movin ridin down your block
Power jets millinium, level five is next

Digital gizmo made by Continental Lincoln keeping you thinking
Better made than European's robot John H. Thomas
Model seven decimal put out by Jaguar
Without the automatic chemical release
Emergency vomit regurgitates any system
Regular or even more antique products put out by top companies
MCA, Warner Brothers, Loud the Polygram enterprise
Virgin masters get melted, you felt it
Through my radiation, foes move on buses
Planes leave the train station, evacuate quick!
(Mechanical legs, mechanical legs)

Rockets on the battlefield
""Tango three left turn ahead, taxi to parking cross seven""
(Now, meow, blah!)
Rockets on the battlefield
""Tango three left turn ahead, taxi to parking cross seven""
(Goin' wild with our sound now!)
Rockets on the battlefield
""Tango three left turn ahead, taxi to parking cross seven""

""Tango three left turn ahead, taxi to parking cross seven""

Release date M6, photographs on Columbia/Ruffhouse description green
With blue ears sky blue shirt that work by remote controls
Burn up Billboard charts, deactivating 1975 music, old soul
Will never go gold, while records warp
Insulting your duplicating of a sample
You will become an example, uncreative peasants
By the lessons of the untalented ones
Signed by your most stupidest A&R
We'll see how far representation information documents
While I stand like monuments
Stun your area like a airborne carrier
United Parcel deliver parts for a start
Cold blooded with a mechanical heart, standing like the Tin Man
Aluminum kneecaps release raps like rayguns, destroying territories
Toys, pterodactyl dinosaurs get bombed in space wars
Laying on galactic floors, amputated, disconnected collections
In more than fifty sections, warehouse with skulls
Land amphibians, welfare recipients
With beautiful women from the Carribean
The ships need repair

Rockets on the battlefield

Not compared to no rapping high flight, member of the A.S.S.R
Immigrants stand in factories, endorsements, six MCs
You seen what The Source meant
Cover stories from the government left you standing
Holding the mic with one hand and
Handicapped with damage, you can't manage style nine-nine
2000 B.C. the sneakers in spacious me in 3-D
Wireless radius, MCs outdated, completion deleted
Japan newspapers in Australia, did you read it?
Over and out, moving with swift Celsius, I melted him down
Jet moving up, level seven seven six oh
With Darth Vader and 3P0

Tired,Feature Magnetic,2016.0,"Yeah
I'm so tired
I'm tired of everybody
Those who are envious
Those who can't stand it
Those that it hurt
Their little hearts, their soul

Tired of everybody knowing where I'm at, my whereabouts
Rappers who ain't recording, just sitting home chewing bean sprouts
Lazy boys who sink in the couch, that's why I'm tired
They deny it in private, some sleep so tired
They won't open their eyelids
They get surprised when I come up and shine like the sun
I just look at them, I'm tired of what they haven't done
Many chasing their own tail like a play puppy
I'm tired of people, adults who wear huggies
Who love to talk about me bad and bug me
Knowing I'm up there with Kanye and Kid Cudi
Jay-Z is my buddy
The masons say I'm not fake
I can't believe I'm so good, I'm in the studio with carrot cake
Other rappers bake

I'm tired
I'm so tired of
I'm really tired
I'm tired
I'm tired of the laziness
Fugaziness
I'm tired
I'm really tired
I'm tired

I'm tired of no relief
Turned over a new leaf
New leash, you chumps never knew grief
Getting stole like a true thief
Edo and Kool Keith, tired of getting played like a motif
You punks don't know beef
Y'all just living with no peace
I got beliefs but ain't wishing to it
Ain't tired of radio 'cause I don't listen to it
I'm tired of cops that don't love us
But I'm more tired of my brothers killing brothers
Weather going take the planet from us
I'm tired of promoters, trying to take advantage of us
I'm tired of complaining, people sitting next to me
Looking at my hands, control my own destiny
I'm tired
I'm so tired

I'm tired
I'm so tired of
I'm really tired
I'm tired
I'm tired of the laziness

Ninety-nine, 2000
As we get biz, yeah
I'mma let you have it
Let's do this
Yo, my life is clientele, while pro people talk about me
Cut empty pocket, shark faces like electric sockets
Sideburns with afro, nasty pro, throw like Rollo
In Wells Fargo, cashin checks while you tryin to borrow
My game is cut through, plastic come, we can see through
Disco music, jazz loops, I ain't tryin to be you
Nineteen-ninety-nine, 2000 black, new design
My head is on right
Back up kid you wasn't born right
Playin center I block your wack raps like Bill Cartwright
Pick up your rebounds, plastic soft production sounds
All MC groups will be cartoons like Mother Goose
No joke I bust back
Kid for real, watch your buttcrack
Entourages, movin neighborhoods like Mr. Rogers
Slam rhymes on concrete, mash em up in car garages
Cadillac spin, open magazines, Vibe again
You're jealous stare lickin, paws like you're Rin-Tin-Tin
I'm back again, I stop your programs like Gentle Ben
Yeah (yeah.. yeah.. yeah..)
Chorus: Kool Keith (repeat 4X)
I'll be the man, watch your backpack, pen and pencil
School today! Grown man, I don't play

Back up the turnpike, watch Mad Max turn into you
Get gassed at truckstops, leave diesel fuel, burnin through you
I come to boo you, best believe, I'm a damager
Cancel shows, interviews, I don't need no manager
Slash fan, half of y'all, think I'm the Elephant Man
Look through my records analyze me like I'm Michael Jackson
Collect my vinyl DJ moves spinnin on my wax and
Groupies in line, camera flashes, I don't need the action
Sweaty hotels, dumbbells, I'd rather shop in Modell's
While y'all wear backpacks, with corny macks, rollin L's
CD's get melted, ask your favorite rapper, how he felt it
I turn on others, light up this, when I'm cookin muffins
That's on the grill, make your girlfriend buy my Ampex reels
Pay for studio time, droppin verse with dope words
I'm on the real herb, pick up mics you got some nerve
Rahway State Prison bring my projects in the music business
That's if you with this, yo Craig, there will be no witness
I'm comin through with Bronx Crew, a black, boo-ba-babboon
Tecs in my pockets make your feets dance, do the lockin
Yeah (yeah.. yeah.. yeah.. yeah..)
Chorus

Yo, what are you doin lookin in my closet?
Why are you tryin to try on my sneakers?
Stop lookin around in my kitchen
That's right it's Honeycomb up there, raviolis
Everything a regular man eats
I'm not the Elephant Man, whassup?
You don't scare me, I'm the man that bought your girl some hair
Walk in giant arenas and stop your show at Madison Square
With security, you can't call the Secret Service
Got your roadie cases packed up, your bookin agent nervous
Backstage passes special units break your Fendi glasses
Cancel your flights, Town Car, see me in the brown car
Rip up your passport, I follow you through Kennedy airport
Lock up the gates, town seize up, like Norman Bates
Book Hotel Niko change my face up, in Puerto Rico
Julio Gongado bumpin beats, in a El Dorado
I'm movin swiftly, the game is fast, very quickly
Greyhound bus tickets, I'll vick you for the whole season
That's the reason I'll be easin, eatin cheese and

Attack ya like roaches

Your unmatched performance can't stop my endurance

Number two you're through, dischargin your battery
Stop rappin to me

Geared toward the universe while black people think the worse
Realistically expect my gross is twenty times your checks

False representation'll leave y'all sweatin in the train station

Over wack-ass beats they get motivated, some have ministrated
Even suburban kids copy your shit and duplicate it
My balls you now cherish

 Hi Keith
 I always see you comin home from school, work
Or college, wherever you comin from
 Mmm-hmm
 I'm a big secret admirer of you
I see you all the time
Sometimes you don't even look very happy
 No I'm not happy at all
 I wonder, what's really goin on in your life
Would you tell me?
 A lot of problems
 But I got things to tell you

I like your pretty eyes
Tell me where you get your hair done, your face so clear
With fourteen carats diamonds in your ear
He beat you up, I'll eat you up, reheat you up
Come fix your life, make you my wife, improve in time
No wine and dine, don't waste my time, mature your mind
I redesign, you changin faces
Stop playin games girl, you two of clubs, I'm pluckin aces
Your girlfriends don't matter
Jealousy's another info, she thinks I'm mental
I love you keep it confidential

You're that fine girl from high school, college graduate
Lady always on my mind, girl can you imagine it?
{repeat Chorus 3X}

I seen you cryin
Relyin on some old backbone prone
I give you stuffed animals, sprinkles on a chocolate cone
You turn your face up
Your body shaved legs to the waist up
You feelin sad, face down, always lookin mad
I counteract, eye contact
Spot you out where the maps at
I caught you starin, why you actin baby?
There's no slackin, the second time I work this
This ain't no clown and circus
You takin Advil, for headaches
I met you girl on purpose
Stressed out with girlfriends
That zero hero leasin his Benz
You under peer pressure
(You think about it girl, think what you really doin)
{repeat Chorus 4X}

I dial your home phone
Know your code and area zone
You trapped in mom's house, restrictions feel like Minnie Mouse
I know you turnin yearnin learnin
Plus your heart is burnin, I'm still concerned while you blinkin
My mind is thinkin, outside your area
You got that space for occupation, big motivation
Let me drop my fierce information
Come here girl, I wanna talk to you
I wanna tell you a lot of things
Different things that you never talked about
Different things you had to go through
What I've been through, before you've even been with
I'm tellin you

And I'm that kid who raps about, who what?
That guy, whatever

We pull the drawers off girls who (sly, we fly)
We wash in gold and silver (sly, we fly)
We walk in clubs with sneakers (sly, we fly)
We look out windows and stare (sly, we fly)
We fly the planes ourselves (sly, we fly)

I put my MASK on, another night for the Phantom
I got the Halloween jack-o-latern
Yo Ed-O, I know some kids funny Silly Putty PlayDoh
They wanna step to farms, and build a hay dough
I drag bodies on down the yellow brick road, like Leprechaun
I come in comet killer mode
Yo grab your neck and your mail
With a WIC check, plus I inspect my roots
And walk in naked, with spirits and ouija board
I Shake-n-Bake it naked, like Betty Crocker
I use a black marker, I draw your face in a sketch
Like a ARTISTE
Two broken arms from my shoulder have a piece
Yum yum, you know you welcome, come in dumb-dumb
Hey what's that smell down there? Look in the basement
Two eyes missin, next day, where your face went?
With Dolly Parton music playin in my pickup truck
My gold sandwich, a swigger liquor chewin duck

A species unkind when human three minds, one head
That brother took the alley (I followed him) he's dead
He's datin Yakos Alli (she's awful) gives head

He likes marijuana, I like, holding his bitch

If I lick you there, my girlfriend, I'mma tell
Rock your boots, and leave my style written on your cooch
With rubber demands, condoms in your soft hands

I want that purple Cadillac with the lime green ragtop, yeah

Lickin splits that switch and

Rubbin you down, in baths, Calgon bound
You lookin sexy smilin, in that soft nightgown

Take me shoppin, do what I want to, do it when I want to do

Disco lights beam, dancin at Southside
She got her lingerie on, sippin on ?
Emotional status, I'm puttin tongues to the baddest
Bitin the peaches, cherries open on the beaches
I got her turned out, screamin in the bleachers

Blockin my great view, some knucklehead's down too

Coach many from the top like 
Phil Jackson
The matte perrriwinkle, Rolls Royce Wraith is accurate
Job application rappers you can scratch when I itch
The nut-sack once a month on the fifth
Your mommy twerking while I smoke a spliff
She a mother of 19 kids, pass her a brick
When she wear a wig, export the imports
My jockstrap sniffed by T.S.A. at the airport
I see a lot of Mickey Mouses on the wrist, fossils don't count
Show you the Rolex, out of bounds
Prada leather trench
Your lady show pretty pink, to be Hershey dog brown
Take her off the campus with Dion and Colonel Sanders
The hawks looking for a good dude to cook food in Atlanta
Serve me frozen sodas from Fanta
More leg room, show me where they expand us
I heard of Kurt Rambis by the lot playing Krampus

How gully do I keep it?
I can make you richest in the world so stop sleeping
In the rap game I'm the best kept secret
Never made a penny from it, you know how I'm eating

They mad 'cause I'm Fonzie

Plotting up a scheme like my last name's Ponzi
Push a button on you suckers so don't ever get cocky

My main man Roddie gets a kick out of sinning
Doesn't know gymnastics, but he always starts flipping
While I'm at the waterfalls on the rocks, I'm sipping

Word being treated
From the roof of my castle looking down, I see you scheming
Stickup kids jotting in my motor, now they pleading
Every human being that ever tried to challenge been defeated
(You life life)
I live life like a coozhound
With a quarter ki of coke and my goose down
Hit the dance floor, ladies get loose now
Every time I leave I knock boots down
B.A.R.S. Murre gives fucks, none
I got that hot shit spitting out my tongue, tongue

I'm world wide lamping now
Skinny dip with your bitch, I-I I am the captain now

I sail the seven seas in a gold scuba kit that cost 87 G's

The ice cold freeze in the thaw on my dick when it's 88 degrees
Say cheese, ladies hit their knees
Cause my whip so sick that it got a disease

Fuckboy wearing a turtleneck and corduroy
I'm eating dead Bok Choy with Soulja Boy
Yep, the palette exquisite
My gynecologist make a sushi fried chicken

She be on some cop shit
Talk shit, I'mma sock you with a chopstick
Nah, bitch, I'mma knock you on the cockpit
Drop and kick your mom dick in a mosh pit

Supreme all star, the spotlights are on
Chillin with the ladies 'til the break of dawn
Jay-Z said I was king, Bernard with the championship ring
Oscar monitor sideburns like Dave fiend
Gave him a 16, some didn't know how to do it
Rub it on they tracks like cream
My body and chest like DeVante Swing
They ching-a-ling-a-ling
Women pull off they panties and things
Double cheetah, Uptown captain leader
For the Post and Daily News reader
Tequila shot, make her hot, touch her G spot
My hand by her crotch, she like to watch
Breitling, with a chick like Iman
New Yorrrrrk (New York) New Yorrrrrk! (New York)
New Yorrrrrk (New York City) New Yorrrrrk!
With Puffy on the side
Custom tuxedo in the Phantom ride
The industry, best in his prime
They say I'm the new Kanye West
Able to progress, take chicks away from Payless
To better slacks, I never wear black
Only covers designed
Everything custom from Beck & Stand
They all usin a regular mind
Remember yours is not better than mine
New York speak, coffee for you is real cheap
So you can open curtains and take a peak
Blackberry been had it
When phone booths was on the street
Before radiators and emcees had heat
Recordings with Elvis Presley at Unique
The king of the town, arrogant is how I sound
Can I have my own autograph pleeeeeeease?
The King of New York

You want that baby, but I'm out here thinkin maybe
What if you flip - but it's OK when you're on my tip
Take off your shoes, don't spread my business news
Reachin for the rubber tips it's time to pay your dues
Two girls in the back, bring your friend, make it three
It's the big thing honey, that's the policy
I got to pull down and bring the steel home for you
Break the headboards and tell your girlfriends come over too
Put my motorcycle helmet on and feel the power
Rock and lift the boots, spank the lips for a hour

Yeah, I must show up, scope the cheeks well with clientele
When a sister wants to see me, I should not really tell
I bought some movies, some strippin joint type of coolies
Boots and thongs, girls flip on my theme songs
They know I damage, with gloves my equipment's on
I got a cape, like Superman, I'mma put it on
Grab the Vaseline, 
make your hiney shine like Mr. Clean
With a purple G-string, you wanna do your own thing

Three limos deep, with honies greet us downstairs
Prepared to take us, anywhere, tonight's the Grammy's
Afterparty back at the hotel, we're poppin expensive Perignon
I'm the suave Don, this is the average evening
Of the celebrities, the days are relaxed
It would seem to most, an expensive vacation package
The pay is good, in Hollywood
A hustler has to mack in fresh gear, my choice of Rolls Royce
And a duplex location up at

 Oh really?
 I'mma get a little bit of gas
Think you can make that trip or what?
 Yeah I definitely can, you know that's a fact
Of course
 Alright I'll be back in a few minutes
I'mma go back to the gas station and get some gas and fuel up
 Alright I'mma get some ? and all that

 Hey Keith I just met this chick, why am I arguin with this girl?
 Static we bring trouble to your right side
 Man we here we just livin positive
 Static we bring trouble to your right side
 Hey we givin it all, and that's all we got to give

Bumpin systems, rollin down the street in Detroit, Michigan
I switch again, bucket seats with my girlfriend
Wearin Paco in a Bronco, cologne is Pronto
Movin quickly like the Lone Ranger, X is Tonto
Back up the turnpike, Oldsmobile's roll with two pipes
440 engine blowin wind, through her hair extension
Two bags of six packs, with .38's, wrapped in gift packs
Big attitude she's on the two train, I roll like Mad Max
Keep it simple baby young girl, now squeeze yo' pimple
How dare you walk around ignore the First National Bank
My name is unknown, don't dial my family call me Hank
I go way back, like you still shop at Alexando's
Buy your sandals for your little son, named Romandos
Watch your step Theresa, chew up on your slice at Easter

Can you surround me in the black tan
My living room, trips to Cancun, with these - eighty ladies
The Jefferson's to the Brady, Sanford and the Son
I want the whole world and my old girl back
She left me for the postman, now she send me letters
I got a bottle of Grand Marnier, drinkin in the stairway
With the wizard Kool Keith, and I'm SPORTIN my rhymes
Funeral chimes signal the beginnin of the end
Cowboy with more in, with my private dancin chicks
They live way out in the sticks, but I put em in the mix (uh-huh)
Took em to Reno in an old Camino, gamblin in a casino
The movie's Al Pacino
Chorus

Got my check cashed, you posin new, stop actin girl, like a fool
Got the Benz on loan, Sadat rollin by your school
You brought your frontin friend Gwen, beggin for the Benjamin
I'll see you a ten, with a haircut, like Scottie Pippen
My man Mark rippin'in the backseat, my cousin Clifton
You get me pissed and wearin big gloves like Sonny Liston
Leon Spinks with afro on, ready to rob the Brinks
I see you got your thongs out, Daisy Dukes and buns out
You call me when you broken hearted, when your money runs out
Back from the Conway, you did it girl the blind way
Hold your horses, and evil forces
Don't press star for Pathmark, I'll be home after dark
I'm tired of Pop Tart

Yeah
I'm touchin Gwen with the butt love, the rubber glove
I'm touchin that ass she swingin her hair, claimin she's an actress
But wasn't she that same chick I seen with the black dress?
Traded the ninety-eight for the sixty-eight Mustang
Me and Keith at the bar, do they know who we are?
Apparently, because all the drinks are free
It's ""Our house, in the middle of our street""
And when you come in here you better wipe your feet
I'm from Alburqueque, New Mex' to the great state of Texas
I rode across on a gray horse, ??
Get to the sauce and add spaghetti, non-pork (what?)
I'mma own New York, with a big spots of the BX
And German outposts, with the communists close (no doubt)
I'm verbose, I host, the most, y'all should roast me
People watch closely and rewind me on the tape
Study this here, then look and listen
Take a step back and watch the black pearl glisten

Ain't no stoppin

Diesel truckin baby - poppin No-Doz for nights
Lookin out the tight skirts rollin up the turnpike
Rollin down the highway - tanks full of gas
Look in your rearview, kid I'm up on yo' ass

Diesel trucks with big engines, Caterpillar motors
Y'all move over, we honkin the horns behind your Escalade
Bam-bam-bam-bammm! That's us
With one overload, behind your Range Rover, truck stops
Last night we made the drops, air pressure on the brakes
Fssssssssshew, one tank better than Jake
Y'all talk a lot of mouth, while we pulled up at the waffle house
Interstate we movin forward, 18 gears the bridge ain't closed
4008 Peterbilt, orange and gray long-nose, haulin apples grade A
Swap trailers on payday
Your meat get delivered on tough beats
While y'all supposed to be movin on tough streets
Play it back baby, crank the pipes, I don't think they got heat
(Breaker 1-9, this is Fat Mic)

Diesel truckin baby - poppin No-Doz for nights
Lookin out the tight skirts rollin up the turnpike
Rollin down the highway - I'm overweight, runnin late
Didn't stop at the scale, highway patrol on my tail

Lookin out the tight skirts rollin up the turnpike
Rollin down the highway - tanks, food, gas
Look in your rearview, kid I'm up on yo' ass

Diesel monster truck rollin, huh, burgundy
Surly more deadly and ready for roadkill melee
I shear, runnin over deers and queers
Niggas, way back, suck cheers and beer, last chance for fear
Hey - HELLLLOHH, little kiddie
Pink bows in your hair and ahh, you're lookin - pretty
What I really look like, I leave no one else
No mercy a killer, kiss my pinkie ring, come kiss it
Sit in fun seats, shiny skirts, big dice on the dash
Flamin all lost with David Lynch, highbeams flash
The cash in ya brastrap, is how much I spent on hubcaps
Blew my 8, cylinder, right before, I split ya
Put a nice suck me suck me cut me orgasm champagne
Vibe bully pistol me kink throw me slit my throat shut me out
It was out in my diesel truck, that I call Lil' Sally


Man you're ready for Kansas, up here I'm rollin
21 gears behind a lady drivin a Volkswagen, I can't stand this
Box weight, ox weight
I gotta be in Grand Rapids at a quarter to 8, not a quarter too late
When I hit the clutch, everything shake
I don't know what route I'mma take
Hit Flying J's in the Great Lakes
Engine red hot, his coffee pot, two barrels of fuel on each side
I laugh at the gas exit when you've gotta stop
Respect all the way up to the radars, check my rearview
Wave at weigh stations, it's all love for you
With sheriffs and cops, Detroit diesel engine you can't stop
When the reindeer lock, everything stay 100 speed limit
Watch the grill block

Guard giraffe mics, my style shine like zebra stripes
Right in your forehead, my word becomes a real missile
I be hanging in back doors like rolls of toilet tissue
Hydraulic engines blow flies out your left window

Shut your face, shut your mouth like pigeons flying south

Your records hot milk like yogurt and you smell sour
Get my reels, Ampex, a-DAT system flex
You got polio knees, lock fell on Soul Train
Dancin' with Anorex, punks I'll flip your brain
Like Don Cornelious, I hide behind the scenes
Make you lick my hot dogs with ketchup on two beans
I censorship real quick and feed your family cabbage
Make you throw-up, eat ham hocks, tuna out the garbage
Blind your range with tones, your radio sounds strange
Eat out your rare back, snatch ribs out your wild coyote
Tell Bob to pay me, the company boss still owe me
But Capitol built walls, built fences
I come for my check, don't lower your defenses (Ha, ha, ha...)
Get off my elevator!
(Security will escort you out my building)
Get off my elevator!

Get off my elevator!

Get off my elevator!

That's some old REAL Michael Jackson shit
I'm comin with Crazy Vic
Let me hear you tryin to copy my shit
Fuck the impact eventually
Cause there's a lot of corny niggas performin out there
Fat stomachs, make-up and eye glare
What the fuck do I care?
Niggas with they ass out
Groupies in cheap motels tryin to fuck and crash out
Motherfuckers ain't networkin
Strippers checkin in - motherfuckers on motorcycles
Pickup trucks with license plates on 'em
Bringin mad shit from down South
Big after-parties I'mma turn my phone off
I don't wanna shake hands, meet no-fuckin-body, arrogant bastard
No commercial shit, break your neck, suck my dick in the world
Fuck the critics everything I make is a hit
Fuck you applehead motherfuckers tryin to make some old
Carribean mixed with that Trinity keyboard shit
Hip-Hop shit, that's some old Broadway musical shit

Turn inside the fuckin' dunk over
Nenad Krstić, ya seven foot sinner
Saw my nuts in his face, oh shit
The crowd missed it
Now The Nets gotta regroup and call a time-out
I'm fuel-exhausted from the stomach up
I shit a rhyme out
Cobra on top of my hat spit a rhyme out
The golden mummies make a statement
Ya chick piss on the couch
The Nigerian queens feed the king
Time is cereal
That's some shit that you won't even get close to ya fuckin' mouth
Golden dogs walk around the fuckin' house
With navigation connected to your bitch eyebrows
The stars crystal off my pubic hair
While you face the throne
18 million for the princess Diana's chair

Somalia, Egypt, somewhere (x3)

I piss on your toenails, paint ya feet all black
You ain't no official fuckin' mack
Skinny legs on your ass stand up weak from cocaine
What's that green fungus growin' from your bitch
Cum in my face with pinkeye
You think magazines tell you the truth?
Look at your face surgery, it's a goddamn shame
Now they got you with a little bony ass
With furry Ugg boots, and celebrity sleuth
The pop sensation let you wipe my ass for me at the radio station
Your bitch know I got good sense
Walkin' up to the Chinese restaurant with the cobra hat
You see where the man is, you fuckin' know where the cobra's at
Your bitch got bed lice from dirty hotels
She move with the clap
Ya'll wanna find the prince, you better get that fuckin' Africa map

Somalia, Egypt, somewhere (x3)

Now watch me walk the camel on top of your fuckin' head
The Arabs trade me oil, and make deals
Horses run at you at in desert, a hundred degrees
I don't need wheels, you motherfuckers in America fight for skills
And top-ranked monkeys, they top-ranked flunkies
With no pyramid status
These peasants and shitstains, they keep comin' at us
The lord abracadabra, shit-talker, Al Jazeera bragger
Get out my face with a cheap-ass phone camera
And practice your goddamn grammar
You can't spell for shit, you can't talk and tell for shit
Now you wanna turn around and talk with shit on your lips

Girl Grab My Dick x4

I'm a 'solicitator'
Screw off the dick off my body
Put it next to the Bacardi in the refrigerator
I'm so rum
I can convince Heidi Klume to let me cum in her anus
They spring-training for the Majors
Your woman filling out pregnant papers
Show you I don't care about the leather piss in the Mercedes
I'm teaching how you cut my pubic hair with the scissors
Like a lady. Barbasol you could be lazy
You catchin' hay fever
Your bitch sucking balls upside down with white sneakers
Her dyke girlfriend with a butt-plug up her ass
Tryin' to be a boss with a wife-beater
A strong woman with cocked-diesel arms pulling my penis
I watch you shit in your Hybrid-Prius
Six in the water-bed tossin' salad with no caeser
Vagina warped outta shape
I can't see much I got your dime droppin' low
Shittin' out a hockey puck, stuffed up her keister
Drinking Seagram, vanilla off my penis who wanna eat some?
Meet me in a threesome
I can see her ass against my nose in the green room
Black shorts all up in her tight light skinned anal
Don't let me get in a groove
Your brunette hair get pulled back to your ass crack
(Blue?) will pop up out you, say it's cool
Intro/Chorus

I just ate some Chef Boyardee mini raviolis
Spaghetti and Meatballs
You're faggoty, you eat balls
I took a shit, Tollhouse Cookies is nooky
Ice-Cream sandwiches I brandish like gat's to get fats
Like Dominoe's no more 30 Minute delivery
Since a Kid got killed. Cause they was rushin'
Now my pepperoni is cold, like a stripper that's russian
Give me Turkish, bitch jerk this souvlaki boukaki
Leave her chicken nuggets, make you think you thuggin
But it's artificial so now you buggin'
Smell my B.O
Frappucino's for all you rats from Encino
Sit back and drink your vino, I bet you lick Pinot
I bet you get haircuts from Gino
You're emo and you bump Brian Eno
You had sex with Emma Phillips and McKenzie
You made love with Shmendrick and Rodney in a 'Benbreck'
That's a Benzie and Buick you bought in Bushwick
I get thirsty when I see hot mommies from Bushwick
They don't shave bush..they keep it thick
Whole-Wheat bread crumbs
Up a bitches hole till she cream-pies red cum
Twinkies are delicious with skim-milk..
Eat my bum..

Your head's numb, so your brains a miss this
Pick 'em up, eat 'em up, pick 'em up, heat 'em up
Pick 'em up picklehead, pick 'em up picky
I roll wit globs and I come real sticky
Grippin' the mic, I plug it up in your ears
Crazed and brewer. I'm coming out like beers
Like Rheingold, Miller, Coors, and Buds
I'm a eat 'em wit popcorn and treat 'em like suds you duds
Coming out the wick wack, wicky, wickable wack
Black jack, that's a fact, writing exact behind your back
The funk rhyme'n master, blaster
Kicking up in a brainstorm, rainstorm
Rap storm, rap form
Rap time, rap rhyme
Rap class, I'm here to fail and to pass
To continue, furthermore on the hype tip
I roll and rock, rock and roll
Jazz and pop, rhythm and Blues
Dance and fusion, brain confusion
Look at the lights, what a night on the town
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
Now I'm back to funk, freak the funk
Hype the funk, swipe the funk and all that junk
I get busy on 'em, communicate wit the world
Man, woman, a baby boy and a girl
Poppa large looking out the bombs drop
Taking stroud while your face and arms drop
Stop, look, learn to read, learn to write
Learn to talk, learn to walk
And watch your step though, I'm hype and ripe though
Kleptomaniac, a rhyme'n psycho
A Ricky Ricardo, a Guy Lombardo
Sporting a ragtop, an El Dorado
Step into Hollywood, I'm screening the boulevards
The rhymes is gain type, I'm ready to pull a card
Jack'a Ace, King'a Queen
Call me the deuce, I'm pouring out like juice
Hitting the top, feeling the rim
Getting a trim, I never rhyme like them
On and on, on and on, on and on
Until the break of dawn
I go overtime, rock the mic in nighttime
Daytime, switching off to Primetime
Pacific east, strolling back in the west time
Ride the funk wit the mic in the east rhyme
Hype and dope, hype the frame
The mic is smoking, yo I ain't joking
Rhyme to kill, rhyme to murder, rhyme to stomp
Rhyme to ill, rhyme to rock
Rhyme to smack, rhyme to shock, rhyme to roll
Rhyme to destroy any decoy boy
On the microphone
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
You're dripping sweaty, coming hard on your neck
As I flow and grow from head to toe
Seeking a style like John McEnroe
Dissing 'em all, serving them wit the mic stand
Like Prince and Michael coming out wit a big band
The crowd is live, you can play as the manager
Run wit the money, I pull the trigger and damage ya
Boom, taking life more serious
I may sound lyrical and very mysterious
Rhymes are grip tight, program to kill more
A son of Sam, how could I be Gilmore?
Grabbing the mic, you see the dark and shadows
You're in living hell, without time to battle
The funk ignited, hands are writing, brains dividing
I'm coming out in sighting
Like I'm Blackula, a better man that Dracula
Spectacular and not irregular
In fact you are speaking impopular
Rhymes are moved and you can't be stop wit the
Beat as it goes to the rhyme that flows
Like a coke in a straw burning up in your nose
That's a bad habit, stepping out on stage one
Drop the mic, come and turn to page one
Look at the master, my rank is higher
My lyrical burns, your brain's on fire

Wigs with

Sit in V.I.P. with blind man lookin like Stevie
We nasty, sittin' next to Regis and Kathie
Front row seats with 
Blowfly

Tickets with popcorn, we rock born
No circus here, just horses and a unicorn
Tuxedos and taxis, we roll with leather maxis
Catch the back breeze
Gypsy cabs burn rubber
Signin' autographs for Danny Glover
Donny Osmond and Dennis Rodman
Up in a empty furniture apartment
With Mexicans maids, rubbin' the spots out the carpet
We move and face our targets

Punch, kick, fight - bite
Whatever you do, just kick {his fuckin} ass!
Cause I'm much different from, the other MC's
Cause I got the amazin, abilities
I can rock on the mic, so you can have a ball
I can fly through the air - stick to the wall
I can take a punch, or get hit by a car
I can go to the nearest or farthest star
As a matter of fact, that's what I wanna talk about
How I went outer space, just to be in the house
Punch, kick, fight - bite!
 Kick his ass downtown - first round
Punch, kick, fight - bite!
 Kick his ass downtown - first round
Punch, kick, fight - bite!
 Kick his ass downtown - first round

With backsprings
Nobody seen the girls pee on the mattress
Who was the actress when we had to take a leak?
I was in the station wagon listenin' to Canibus
We're basketball with glasses
Lookin' like Kurt Rambis
Ridin' the turnpike to Paramus
Drinkin' a box of Tropicanas with this 
dumb-ass nigga
Drivin' the green 
Bonneville
 from Indiana
At a truck stop
The state trooper made me turn down the hip-hop
I got out and vomicked on the ragtop, super eggdrop
UHAHHHH!  Pass me the towel
Was it McDonald's?  I'ma sue Ronald

Show these sheisty people, the sawed off, the pump is real
Then smack niggas when they don't feel Keith's right direction
Put niggas in fear, the bullets in they head section
Pick up drug dollars, leave rings around niggas collars
Front me cash, you catch them bodies, put em in a stash
Never laugh at you, explain plans, what to do
Machine guns on tour, pajama for your soft crew
Don't step to me with shit the candle wax is gettin lit
I'm solo now, and still money I have to fuckin split

Not the platinum plaque, just gun staples in your back
Hung from a tree with rusty nails in your rectum crack

Up with hit records on feet, in the fuckin rain
Through merry-go-rounds, past politic circus
This shit flop first, and now it's time that you work this
Suck my ass, we pass on acts if you think they good
Niggas ain't platinum, they album still, went barely wood
I bring your spirits down, samples now you have to clear it
Niggas talkin shit like lyric records, I ain't tryin to hear it
Even if I'm deaf no mouth, one fuckin ear left
You think they worth investments, hold your fuckin breath
You might as well bite Kane, Rakim, study G. Rap

Let me get real, before that ass breach that contract
I got witnesses watchin, statements over budget
Don't try to hide behind that fuckin mask now
Throw the pistols away, and hide the shit in the grass now

I'm sittin quiet with tons of threats, and Baskin-Rob'
Extortion is over, I cock back, you lose your fuckin job
Two years of my time is precious in my kid's mind
With child support, I drag your coffins in the court
We even Steven, fuck that, my time and rent is short
I've been writin songs, I'm calm, I'm a good sport
One year has gone by, with tecs jam up in your eye
I'm on some clever shit, fuck it man, go 'head lie
I wake up six o'clock with triggers cocked every morning
I'm no joke, you're bound to smell the fragrant gunsmoke
I'll be scrubbin halls, wipin blood off the office walls

See Keith's the type of artist to do his own thing
There's no A&R out there that can tell him how to make a record
You can't tell him he needs to make something like everyone else
Cause everyone else is just stealing his originality and ideas
ANYWAY .. I think we should cancel the marketing meeting

 chill with

So 
Ruffhouse politically had to freeze my album
Regular Columbia
 don't know what the hell is goin on
With a sheisty distribution switch behind my back
I worked on my album February last year
13 months, passed by, all I heard was a bunch of lies
Six weeks in 
Conshohocken
 hawkin with a so-called manager
Univested, livin off my budget
My LP was completed before John Forte, Sporty Thievz and Pras
But too many secret fans had they hands in the pan
When I got to Philadelphia, everybody was waitin for me
With tracks with a bag full of unconceptual DAT's
Throwin me off, distractin me
?? ?? came out with programmin
Me on the basslines, all my beats were slammin
Nothin they could tell us
While everybody except 
Tim Devine
 was jealous
With my album leakin out to a bunch of critics
It was somethin stupid the record company
And the scam bookin agent, slash manager did
Dubbin my cassette for the industry, it got silly
Opinions from people who don't know jack about music
In the industry, know what?
Had to do the album practically over
Chorus: Kool Keith (repeat 4X)
This is a test press
White label test press

Back like ""Return of the Jedi""
While the average person critiquin my album
Most MC's look at me with red eyes
DJ's don't understand my sound is too new
He can't feel it on the felt; he say he'll make it a hit
If I give him a Rolls Royce and a Versace belt
Take care of program directors
Yeah gonna call Billboard when y'all send them a Mustang Ford
Then buy a 20-page ad about Kool Keith headbands
Soap powder's in 
The Source
, that'll get me the cover boss
Everybody's small
You're gonna have to buy video shows with washing machines
I got to step up to bat in Three Rivers Stadium like the Yankees
In the World Series against the Big Red Machine
Y'all gotta make it work, every video producer
Y'all gotta send 'em a V-12
Cause nobody wants the t-shirt at Urban Network
Big Truck productions need to hire 20 people on the phones
Callin retail; 90 foot pictures of me and my daughter
Lifts on the side of the building
Half of these records are wack cause street teams get paid
To pull out wack snippet tapes out their wack backpacks
Get off early with a crew pile up in a suburban

Cruisin down the street in my six-fo'
Jockin the bitches, slappin the hoes

If you a faker, stop hallucinating
Stop procrastinating, we don't run with traitors
We so real, we're so 'bout it, 'bout it, pimping
Ain't no cash flowing, unless it's strictly stricken
Ain't no weed blowing, unless you're going half
Ain't no liquor pouring until you pay your tab
Ain't no bitches bending over backwards 
Steady pouring something that I (lack)
And stack up with money (we're loaded to death)
These niggas that's bummy (they hate me to death)
But none of these niggas will step on the scene
And go one-on-one, they value their health
They know I'll slap a ho straight to the moon
Like I was an animal, sadistic goon
Your life is in danger when niggas assume
When you fuck around with my money (that's doom)
Power to people that hustle like me
24/7 they grind these streets
Shine like gemstones when I creep
(Ooh) blind mine enemies
I don't know the definition of sleep
If I couldn't starve (I wouldn't eat)
So my main focus is my cheese
And slap any ho that don't heed, ugh

If she a dog, if she rude

Blocks up, I'm knocking them down
Coked up, fucking around
Pee on the nose, my writing gross

Breaking the center, slap the dungs
Make them sung, like Simone

What we design,  slimes
Block clop, fizzy activity
Diggity-wiggity, dickity-nickity
Wickedy-wickedy, ball out
The girls with titties slang dope
You make it rain,  more
Come fly to Ukraine, spazz up
Hop in the truck, pop your dog
Get tummy tucked, run and duck
A Uncle Buck, move with us
You cool with us, I do'd them up
Like groupie dust, how it sound
Coke puffs, who roll the blunt
Now, what you want, tonk-tonk
My car horn go bomp-bomp
You beep-beep, I bonk-bonk

Put my finger right inside her
She was wet, wet-wet wet-wet-wet, wet-wet

You Can’t Go Outside,The Lost Masters,2009,"Now you famous.. but guess what?
You can't go outside

You can't walk outside.. with your girl in the rain
You can't walk outside.. with your girl in the rain

I laugh now, I see a lot of jokes
You ain't comfortable, scared pink, hang around a lot of folks
You don't know gangs wanna kill you
You get shot by real locs
First class always, you bring a busload
You neverous when you sit in coach
I know your facade, hardcore
You hope a lot of people get scared with your approach
Your whole steelo mice and roach
When Marion comes in the industry, the parties get empty
The champagne bottles go down
Hotel lobbies get dimmed, your average hard rapper turned ghost
Hits his foxhole and go to his post


A lot of you live through food and delivery
I know the pain is the front in your misery
Come outside your indoor studio, enjoy your life
Lay on your couch by your floor model Sony
You dream you got shot twice
Come outside, don't be scared
Even NBA players walk the streets with no bodyguards
How you gonna flex with Domino's pizza in your living room
And sport your ice?  You're paranoid
Cause the walked into the library, looked at you twice
Orderin all you do is murder and kill, on vinyl and CD
Request to have the chicken and fried rice
Chinese cat at your door on the bike
You doin the same thing you did last night (same thing)


You wear your glasses at night
Tinted windows, comin through your block slow
You cancelled another show because the police department
And the FBI told you not to go
The record company cover you
Overweight bodyguards smother you
When your wife ain't, what you think your lover do?
Petrified of what happened to 2Pac and Biggie
You light up your ciggy
Grab a cold beer out the refrigerator, bop your mickey
You was scared in the hired hotel

Give me a little more hard energy
More impact and intensity
Bikinis and more bras
Scenes on hoods of hot rods
My collection of personal and private songs shock you
Like Hot Wheels and Johnny Lightning cars
With social exposure, a magnetic force
Evolve and change with culture
Black Elvis Presley, Grace mansion, the man is handsome
Don't act wild girl like babies throwin a tantrum
I scrub out problems like dandruff
I watch you stand stiff
C'mere honey, give me a kiss..


The hot vacation, took you out of frustration
You still my psychology patient
Solve the best, but I'm one hard equation
Spanish ladies, Italian, white black or asian
Peru, Indian, Cindy and, Mindy and
Kimmie and we hold the toast with cups of tea
Three cups you see, I call you late
A quarter to three, we be that, a bouquet
Gifts and roses, sparkles of diamond, je-wels
Pearls of Bombay",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-i-love-you-nancy-lyrics
Operation Extortion,Matthew,2000.0,"I'ma cancel all the studios, I'mma find you in New York
You fucked it up for everybody
When I see you I'mma punch you in your fuckin face
You and that other faggot ass nigga that rap witchu
I'mma catch you (?) Ensoniq or Platinum Factory
I know you be in fuckin Chung King
I'mma search around motherfuckin D&D

Fuck you nigga, criticizin my shit, talkin behind my back
Youse a weak nigga, don't speak nigga, face the trigger
What you know about my shit?
Why you reviewin it, why you ratin it? You fuckin hatin it
Backpack ass nigga, how you figure?
Fuck a cypher, I get live on your favorite ass corny ass niggas
I'm a survivor, no village ass shit
Motherfuckers walkin around tryin to be Bob Marley and Lenny Kravitz
That scarf shit around everybody's head is for faggots
Get on stage I throw lettuce and cabbage
You fuckin with bad habits
Run up on you like 10 Puerto Ricans gettin out a fuckin Chevrolet
I don't play, fuck your bodyguard Big Rae
I chop your hands off and throw your fuckin fingers in the ashtray
Dead-end, no backup, comin down to one-way
Chorus: Kool Keith
Operation.. extortion (4X)

Why you curse so much nigga? Fuck you, duck you
Loadin this motherfuckin tec up, there's a lot of things I must do
Click up, shut the fuck up, bukka, bukka, bukka
Fake-ass cast, counterfeit bitch-ass
I'mma see how long that choreographer dance shit last
Make you take the CD's out the shelf
Come to your record release party, show you some shit
And make you piss on yourself
No guest list, I better get past this
Type of motherfucker to wait outside the club
For your black dumb-asses, I'mma have a contest
See which bitch-ass nigga get in they car the fastest
Strongarm your bodyguards with armed freebase smokers in a stolen Dodge
Pour gasoline down your shirt in the car garage
Yo black burn this nigga
Watch how Kentucky Fried I turn this nigga
Watch you sizzle like a well done Nathan's Frank
That's what you get for fuckin with Hank
Give all your fuckin credit cards, niggas with ski masks
Took your mink coats at Chemical Bank
Visa America take this shit fill up the gas tank
I told y'all I was gon' slap that motherfucker
And baseball bat that motherfucker
Your man with his bullshit mixtape ran out Hot 97 like a sucker
I'mma send a crackhead that needs money bad
At least to get one of you motherfuckers
You owe me for damage
I know a Dominican that's ready to stab your fuckin manager
Catch a homicide and catch a Greyhound bus out to Canada

Diesel Truckers Theme,Diesel Truckers,2004.0,"Yo.. Kool.. Keith..
And Kutmusta - the funky redneck - Kurt
Platinum rich! Rollin, rollin..
All.. systems go!

Diesel truckers, truckers, truckers (you are the best!)
Diesel truckers, truckers, truckers (you are the best!)
Diesel truckers, truckers, truckers (you are the best!)
Diesel truckers, truckers, truckers (you are the best!)

Diesel format, check the road, hit from city to city
The gritty, the committee
The master with trailers overloaded
Santa Fe out to New York City
The gear changer, downhill vocal rearranger
Heavy angles make your woman earrings dangle
Truck drivin expert
With the Coogi, sometimes I sport the Kangol
Fallin watermelons, produce
Supermarkets need it by tomorrow
Diesel truckers, we carry mangos
With map facin angles
Curves to go by, under the passes don't lie
From the Golden Gate Bridge to the George Washington Bridge
Packed houses in London, my vocals ignite the Brixton fridge
Museums worship me like pyramids
Words connect and play together like little kids
Beginners who just started, clones in zones and fugitives
Who try to express theyself
Abstract outerwear, bouquets and sports coats
Enemies, my focus is past wigs with mad tricks
All bets are massive bids
Optimus, we pushin rigs, overhauls
Bringin 9,000 pounds of weight, around to malls
While y'all move cotton balls, before 16's was made
I broke the laws, of sharks who bit like Jaws
Evens or odds, it's still mine
The machinery can never be paused
On tour, skate on comp like Guy Lafleur
Many call me the great Boston Bruin, Bobby Orr
I'm Bobby Raw, the crowd cheer, y'all watch Bobby score
Texture for perfection for selection
The manifesto, you heard the best though
Gassin up with diesel, you take the Esso",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-diesel-truckers-theme-lyrics
You Know The Game,Sex Style: The Unreleased Archives,2008,"Yo Keith, let me tell you sumthin' son
Rap is big business
They been signin' whack M.C.'s
Since the beginnin' of time
It's been goin' on and it continues goin' on
I'm Rhythm X, Kool Keith, Papa Large same time the Phantom
Four People in one, sometimes I can stand 'em
My lyrics spark the world on a station in your program
Girls get wild, this ain't no slimy corny slow jam
I walk around sometimes in Santa Cruz
California and drop the funky news
The kids flowin' with speed like Jesse Owen
Mexican girls, I love 'em mixed with Samoan
I go cruz up the west goin' ta Oakland Town
Passin' Fremont, the caddy runnin' Oakland bound
I turn a right an' make a left on a nice block
No time for drugs, cocaine and a nice rock
I might lean to the side like I'm super fly
Smoke no skag, I'm bugged and a super guy
I might flip out, my attitude change
People in America, whoo they think I'm strange
I'm not no regular man or the average man
I might trip-out, sometimes I think I'm Batman
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
I read my comic books, I bring my cartoons to life
Gangsters and immortals, they can bleed with a knife
I straight bug 'em my way, they live their fantasy
I seen wilder stuff, what they tellin' me?
That's just an act from them, they in a studio
Wildin' on wax and perpetratin' in they video
I hate to look at TV, I'm gettin' sleepy
They grabbin' Dr Dre's sound, tryna get sneaky
I see my style so different, they can't take it
2 million rappers and everybody wants to make it
4 thirds are whack and stop and clog the industry
You wanna sign him? To me, I think he sound like pee
I was dissed and insulted at the Gavin
800 whack M.C.'s
(Huh, huh)
They kept me laughin'
Playin' and perpetratin', you thinkin' and debatin'
All this time, no one and still has awakened
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
Flight in, flight out, every single night out
Lookin' at people jumpin' you puppets with no clout
I got no deal in that part, no half a second movie
I stay down low, my music touch still groovy
I look at contracts what's up with Warner Brothers?
My day on the sliver screens, with condoms and more rubbers
You bet your socks again, this Bronx kid rocks again
Smokin' that blunt, your black lungs need oxygen
Who you cool with, and stupid who you fool with?
Never mind my mental friend I went to school with
My style is pro, connectin' to a confessional
Breakin' it down like tiny parts in a mineral
I chill and watch MC's, they don't see me
2 hundred 80 million, a thousand try to be me
Yo company's are dumb, bum's signin' anythin'
In the long run, you're stuck with a chicken wing
Wastin' your money these acts they can't rhyme
You're dealin' with cornflakes, a lemon head an lime
Everybody's mean and walkin' up on the scene
They're pure bacon, a brand new pack of sizzle lean
I hate to walk on over and pull and pick your file
Like a bandit i wear a mask and vic your style
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
Yeah, I hear what you sayin' man
You just gotta keep on doin' what you doin'
With all these people runnin' the game

I put you on the hood, now crank you Benz up

Now you actin' up, I got the grease up in the bottle
Come and get the work out you hot momma model
You do aerobics, you gonna have to bend over
Smack that butt, no rubbers bring ten over
Stop squeezing your lips and your legs together
I wear my latex suit right in the bad weather
I let my seat vibrate, you on my motorcycle
I have you buggin' and flippin' on your own cycle
You say, man oh Keith, yo my kitten hurt

Sweepin' your panties with a dust pan and broom
You leave a barrel of drawers I still sniff 'em
Yo Kurt stand back I need a tow truck to lift 'em
I got lotion to pump and more Vaseline
My fantasy to freak a honey using gasoline
I know I scheme on 'em just like a pro
If Dawn was home, I'll send my role to En Vogue
I make ya jump up and down, yo Keith, wind me up
I'm in the closet, yo Keith, come and tie me up
I know you girls out there, I know you like it well
I like pancakes, I wonder how that cat smell?
We in the dark, yo quick yo pull 'em to the side
Yo make it snappy, your mom's waitin' in the ride
You better go home, get ready with the masengil

I peeped you out (oh you watchin me?)
I know where you go (no you don't)
I'm watchin you (so you say..)
(but, I'm watching you too..)

I love your sweet eyelashes, your darkskin flavor
Every morning going to school on the elevator
Soft and nicely, the girl entice me
Diamonds on her watch, she rock her ice B
With a North Face coat, apple bottom jeans
The El Dorado is smooth, when the mack leans
The President is there, the stars walkin on the scene
Tastes so good, her body like Krispy Kreme
Freak with a mask, it ain't even Halloween
(It ain't even Halloween)

Girl take it off, shake shake shake it off
Move your pom poms, bikinis and your panties off
Rub on the lotion, baby oil nice and soft
(Come here baby, I'mma break you off)

Don't get me wrong now, I like 'em blonde with long hair
They call me Sauvere, I like her underwear
She don't mind posin, she don't even care
I like her atmosphere, plus she's out there
The type of girl to break out, yo we outta here
House and closets, model with a lot of gear
She love to play on the pole, spread 'em on the chair
Talk on the rooftop, when she wanna feel some air
I know her secret phone, when she's leavin home
Her Benz is baby blue, convertible, trimmed with chrome


With a see-through nightgown, she got to be Spanish
Brassiere, baby come over here
The mamacita, lick the ice off her back when I freak her
She look Brazilian sometime, her face look unique-a
Shower when she dance in the go-go bar
- by the speaker
I excuse myself and let the man meet her
Family Lacosa, they call me Sosa
I hold the best wine up when I toast her, real extravagant
Better than gin, extreme dime straight from San Juan like a 10
Eight inch heels witcha pink shorts

Let me see that pretty ass
Lean over
Let me put a little grease in your ass
Knahmsayin baby?
Fine-ass bitch
Bitch let me see one of the titties
Hit you in the face with one of these fitties
Watch pictures, pass out
In the leather sofa with the ass out
Piss in your pocketbook
With a patch over my eye like Captain Hook
Fuck all the romance and love books
Still they help your pussy like a crook
Break you down to the name of your asshole
Connected to the Chevron station and the gas cable
Motherfuckers cooperate, don't be hateful
Lotion your ass up, you're ungrateful
Take a shit in the underground picture
Make it commercial
More tasteful, parental advisory
Clean your vagina with ammonia and ivory
Piss in your face
Piss in the right place
Piss in your face
Piss in the right place
Raisin mutilation
Reynolds and Wrap, Tupperware
New Jersey sexy shit
Hype nipples, eatin your own defecation
Vicks in my nose
Sniffin glue while you smell ass
I specialize in bitches who communicate - and sell ass
If I'm upset, I get a ride and tell ass
Put your ass in a butt-cast
Fingerpop you with my Jason mask
You can't sleepover and crash
Ginseng up yo that's right
Everybody's gettin pissy, with chronic and hash
Waterbed and the table
Leave urine in the back of your Taurus Sable
Tie my underwear to the back of your car
Spray your ass with {?}
Dress you up and grab the Vaseline jar
Piss in your face, girl you know
Pissin in your face, pissin in your face
Pissin
Your eyes feel my dick in the dark
Part of your bathroom, you think I'm sick
I fill the soggy shit and you split
Over 40 to 50 plus
Old bitches who smoke PCP and dust
Fuck the lust, pour milk on your Bally with Orange Crush
Cover your asshole with a Slurpy slush
Orgy over here, that's right they doin it over there
But I'm the director with a camera, everywhere
I'm the photographer, Jim take pictures
Yo, y'all be first, cause there's seven of us

Rap done turned microscopic
Defecated on the floor and watch the butcher chop it
Play of the pick with cream for jock-itch
I wear a wrestling mask
The ladies show ass in front of Bernard Hopkins
Rap so toy I play with Shopkins
Write with a marker like Al Sharpton
Leave the rest constipated with Swanson
They might wanna have a phone conference
Coach the best to swing on my balls like Tarzan
Take off like an aircraft
They got diarrhea all I see is brown potatoes, mash
Just inches off the floor—just one-and-a-half
People get cozy and sit inside the paragraph
Levitate like the nouns and the adjectives
Natural ingredients I add for the kids
Urine stains on your ad-libs
Bradley all like Milton sleep inside Paris Hilton
We can play with Spaldings or Wilsons
New verses for new children
Pull up in the Phantom with pilgrims
The sky's like Phil Simms

Open up that hatch, duke, it's time to make my getaway

Double up that dinner plate, I bought a hearty appetite
Even heart the opposition when we're in the after life

Ignore them signs, light up, shit, we gon' smoke tonight
""Craig G? That son of a bitch!""
Will be an asshole if he lives to be 106
Pull up on you at the light, make fun of your chick
Have you so blinded with rage you probably run into shit
You ain't comin' to quip—I can talk and none of ya gettin'
The gun to put one in your hip—it's all fun till your hit

And going in the light's the only time you're feelin' wavy

Drop deep like hills in San Francisco
Cookout with hoodrats and fried chicken and Crisco
After dinner, girls come over in lingerie
Bake sugar cookies and ginger snaps from Nabisco
Even nighttime, we bust a night rhyme
Ridin fluently into the mountains with briefcases countin
Millions and billions and zillions
And quintrillions, in mansions talkin to chameleons
Dark Vadar

Dark Vadar, watchin DVD's with his new fader
And may the, force be witchu

Back on the scene with a pocket full of green
And I'm speedin like I'm caffeine
Intergalactic, super tactics, sultan with this rapping
Pull up, tinted out limousines, in Detroit I am never seen
Plus I keep a motherfuckin laser beam
To blow away your motherfuckin pale team
Crazy as this shit might seem
Livin in a nightmare, not a dream
All my life I been a microphone fiend
You want the title?  Step in the ring
You ain't tryin to hear me, get your ear bit off
May the force be witchu when I turn your shit off
Star Wars, me and Keith in the bar with scores of whores
And the tours for whores
Pimps push Cadillacs
Gorilla macks swingin the battle-axe
Since I was sippin Similak
But I wanna be breastfed by Princess Leia, playa
Me and Keith new millenium rhyme sayers
Too futuristic, for you to miss this shit
And if you do, may the force be witchu",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-dark-vadar-lyrics
Get It While U Can,Total Orgasm 2,UnKnown,"Get it while you can

Now I'm activating my acrobats
I'm wearing a cast around my crutch on my tracks
You must want to see me in Cinemax, nigga
Come on baby, they're just a piece of gum in a pack
Arthur Baker,
 
I make 'em pie crust
They want to walk up to another height
And step on a flight with a DC-10, motherfucker
Make yourself comfortable on my Airbus
My mechanics in the ceramics make your hair rust
Press the accelerator and drop up in your elevator
My Pinto's parked inside your neighbors
Parallel with lights blinking
Motherfucker, what the fuck you thinking?
Your head under the car, your ass see the oil leaking
You play Supernigga, why is the boiler leaking?
Rappers got they ass up in the air like 
Jada Stevens
The pimps backing out the door with my shit on the floor
With they Gators, leaving
I got the contract to jerk you
A lot of artists stuck in my hundred-year agreement
Emcees cry at night, ""When you gon' release him?""
Eat all your food, I'm beasting
Chewing on metal pots
You might want to put on a peach bra
And walk away with combat boots
The Army don't want you in here with dreadlocks
The Marines say they can use a mascot
You girl ass so small she can sit in the dial of my watch


Your bitch sucking the balls through my Batman jockstrap
I'mma let Robin double-team and put a finger in her asshole
She like when The Joker paint his face light green and unload
The Pengin coming with The Mad Hatter and Mr. Freeze
Now that's six of us squirting the cum in the face of one bitch
Girl, you're welcome
Superstar walking your Beverly Hills
Let us watch
Take out your weave and take a shit
I'm wearing goggles with windshield wipers
A lot of fog and rain when I'm in the studio producing shit
Thumbs-up in the cockpit
A bad bitch with a fucsia wig licking my dick
With my seatbelt fastened
I'm ready for takeoff, everything on autopilot
Piss on your Cazal glasses
Delta flight 88-80
Passengers lay back and shit on yourself
We about to fly over these stupid-ass niggas' heads real crazy
I'm still cumming in your girl's face through turbulence
Stewardess rocking back and forth in the cabin
Stay clear out the runway, you bastards",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-get-it-while-u-can-lyrics

Beautiful island baby, just you and me
Eatin canteloupe by the water
My everlastin queen I want to have my son
Give me a beautiful daughter
No other woman in the world
You are the queen of my life, my #1 girl
Takin you places you never been before
Blessin you faces you never seen before
You make my sunlight, you make my heart pour
With us ridin the horse and chariot around Central Park
Starin at the beautiful light, I smell your aroma
After dark the most sensous
Our love is everlastin incredible, most continous
The top of the mountains, I climb up it's a must
Eternal love (eternal loooove)

I want you to be that one for meee - I want you to beee
I want you, I want you to be - yeahh
I want you to be that one for meee - I want you to beee
I want you - I want you... I want you, yeah I want you

With my pen releasing the thoughts to your emotional setback
The stress you had is gone, my job is to make you forget that
Enhance your private life, pick up your veil over your face
It's time to make you my wife, for dear life
With infinite time and destination
I'm over the lust beyond the consultation
Ready for the boats with the tender cruises with you FOREVERRR
I wanna relax on vacation
You could be black, white, asian, latin or indian
Dominican and Haitian; with true and honest eyes
It's you I'm facin, and the fierce situation
You made me who I am now, my mind is under all different types
Of enjoyin weather in the deep relation
Your feelings are ready for elevation
I need you now to meet me at the station
I need you NOW... to meet me at the STATION
You gotta be there on time

I want you to be that one for meee - I want you to beee
I want you, I want you - yeahh

I want you -- I want you, I want you -- I want you-hooo

I can't think no more, I cry to myself by the bed
I can't sit by the sink no more
Your perfume lingers in my room with the overjoy and pain
I think about you even when it doesn't rain
If the highway was given to you
We would bypass the gridlock and switch into the lover's lane
My extreme thoughts of you, put no other above you
My stare is constant, my eyes say I love you
With the time and essence; I'm overwhelmed with the moment
Many times happy with your presence
Season to season, I'm only weak as you make me
I stopped you in the broad daylight for the reason
I can't tell you the texture of the time shock
With the stopwatch tickin, and the time it took
I'm into the popular sequences
If anything, my diary's full
Girl you on my BLOCK, you in my BOOK
Eternal loooooooove - love

I want you to be that one for meee - I want you to beee
I want you, I want youuuuuu - yeahh
I want you to be that one for meee - I want you to beee

All the Time,Black Elvis/Lost in Space,1999,"Yeah!  Straight from New York City
It's all the way live - youknowhatI'msayin?
And I gotta tell you like this
Like Shan said, I pioneered this
And I'ma let you have it
Super status, structure, lyrically the baddest
No time to perpetrate on front street, I rock the fattest
Ultimate ego, your rap style, sounds feeble
Bionic black man, crowd packed with tons of people
No one the equal, should grab the mic, stop my sequel
Purchase your ticket, I been here since Wilson Pickett
Shut off your rap dream, career's over, that's on high beam
You on the trampoline learnin, you still concernin
I burn your index, spray your raps like they insects
I want that action
Chorus: Kool Keith (repeat 2X)
I do this all the time
(Every night and every day, we make moves so don't you hate)
I do this all the time
(Every night and every day, Kool Keith does his thing his way)

Movin steady through yo' zip code, arrangements, your lip fold
Y'all Billboard hype companies line that y'all ship go
Got your mom believin the label clown pick your room up
Y'all stuck in contracts in pop's house, clean your room up
I pull your charter from the blind side, to the start up
There'll be no star, pull them stickers off your rented car
Your man is playin also, a fake mafioso
His rap is so-so, I'm warmed up like chocolate cocoa
Who you know go?  Get that kid, off your promo
I move like Marko, New York City think I'm Cuomo
You sayin, ""Oh no, Keith is droppin big solo""
I hang on Grand Street, with shoppin bags down on SoHo
Chorus

Catch you out there, with mic stands, cords in yo' hand
Youse a first year rookie, duplicatin Method Man
I test yo' skills, fanbase that only go to Peteskil
Servin headwork, new MC's, watch your neck jerk
I'm such an expert, I pull you quick, stop your concert
I drop my interludes sharp now, words and inserts
Back your face up, while sound man, turn the bass up
You wearin makeup, your skirt is short, sippin a quart
You think you're hardcore?  You're opposite, rappin softcore
Kickin metaphor with zeroes, I give you a score
Monster amateur, I move up kid, then I damage ya
Check one two

I Wanna Play,Spankmaster,2001.0,"Yeah.. two-thousand.. three!
(I wanna play with you baby) Brand new
(Can you touch me? Won't you hold me?) K-double-O-L, Keith
(Can you talk to me? Cause I'm lonely)
(I wanna play with you baby) Yeah..
I used to roll, with girls, down the road
Mack trucks caused country Peterbilts overload
Turnpike in freak mode, kissin at a highway patrol
Haulin platinum and gold, takin chicks to the superbowl
Big freight with big weight
Eight thousand birds smuggled internate while you hate
Four hundred miles, we just ate
State trooper we super we dooper
Watch it when we loop or make the left burn out
And watch the club turn out
I keep it raw on tour, feet stay on the floor
United capital rounds, mega droppin them pounds
Big Hank I roll through with tanks, man droppin them sound
Suckers get played like referee, now you're out of your bounds
I move in territories, areas with scary stories
(I wanna play with you baby)
(Can you touch me? Won't you hold me?)
(Can you talk to me? Cause I'm lonely)
(I wanna play with you baby)
I roll with full tanks I'm ready Eddie Diesel we feel
Texaco and pro go borders down to Mexico
Tech stashed with calico, Cancun trips we flip
Snub-nosed to your lip, girls gyrate boots and hips
We blow down nuttin's here
Slow down catch crews on the ups and lowdown
Big controllin, money foldin
New twist nothin old and comin through custom bust 'em
Greyhound bus ride rush 'em all midrange earthquakes
Blow your backseat, amps pre-heat
Girls giggle laugh, hee hee
Cops rollin radars, trucks move with CB's
Switchin more gears, countin G's, blastin CD's
Product on the market make a man behind
The drum machine freeze hear DAT you say please
Raindeer cross the freeway, twenty-two degrees
(I wanna play with you baby)
(Can you touch me? Won't you hold me?)
(Can you talk to me? Cause I'm lonely)
(I wanna play with you baby)
Seventeen the switch-up, sixteen the switch-down
Engine hot, turnin eighteen wheels in the block
Backin up in yo' section, tight with rhyme perfection
Smooth like Teddy Pendergrass, yeah..
.. Think I better let her go, for another T.K.O
Super trashin tires bone, big rims and Firestone
Speed up and rev up two hundred miles up the turnpike
Comin head up smokin all pipes like big bongs that you like
Don't step to me when I'm on the noiman(?) mike
Watch the rowdy crowd in the mosh pit fight
(I wanna play with you, I wanna lay with you)
(I wanna stay with you, if it's okay with you)
-- I wanna play with you baby
(I want you to come over..)
-- I wanna, play.. with you
(I wanna play with you, I wanna lay with you)
(I wanna stay with you, if it's okay with you)
-- Play, with, you

Baby did you cook anything tonight?
What's in the frying pan? Oh~!
You made that salsa huh?
Oh that tastes good, put me some in there
Oh yeah, hold up, aight
Honey I miss you! {*3X*}
Woman explain to me what you doin, I gotta look at you while you sleep
It's professional when our lips meet
You're the main attraction, perfume smells sweet
Remove your panties off, catch your heartbeat
I can't babysit you, I can't stay wit'chu, every week
I walk you at home at night, listen to you when you speak
My mind on your sofa, what would you like to do?
I'm on your grey leather love seat
I feel your love heat, all your love sweet
Havin orgasms to my love deep
The nighttime visitor, booty call
Girl can you find a babysitter?
You talkin that one hitter quitter
It's all night, it's alright
Get in the back, do your thing
Do it miss thang (do it miss thang)
I gotta cheer up your facial expression
You need your stress relief, a heavy sexual session
While hot strawberries bounce off your stomach section
Let me explain to you what I'm testin
Over the bra that cover your chest'n
External foreplay is what I give you all day
You already used to me shavin your legs and moisturizin your skin in the jacuzzi
I'm bound to find you, before you lose me
With cocktails and crystal glasses
I'm blendin to see, business girls from the financial district
I'm shocked, you takin me on a shoppin spree
You wanna let me come over unless a hater stoppin me
Turn that record off, he's floppin B

You know what I'm sayin, you know what I'm sayin
I'd like to tell all these motherfuckers
I'd like to tell all you motherfuckers, about theyself
About theyself, about what they think they are
About what they think they are
Motherfuckers ain't shit, you ain't shit
Fuck gold and platinum and jewelry
Diamonds glistenin red, I'm still the overgrown boy freak man
Fall asleep, still piss in the bed
Ask your girl nigga, I piss on your head
If you're neo and unfunky, I'm guaranteed usually
Ten grand or more a show
But for five or six I'm ready to piss in your dreads
Who's ready to handle the confunction, jazz
And everybody with they first new trendy equipment
Could press the KEYS, and kiss my ASS
No prestigious toilets and golden bathroom trimmings
Dress your bitch up like Batwoman, and shit on her mask
Dimepieces run with the boring niggas
My sex life, I piss on top of your cash
Your money talk, I wipe my ass up with your Cottonelle nigga
Rappin against me, you ain't shit
My job is to make your doofy-ass baseball caps fit
Pimple-faced bastard, watch who you rap with
And cover your motherfuckin buttcheeks with Chapstick
I'm a grown-ass man, you can suck mine
And that talk behind my back circle shit
Superstar gassed up niggas smokin that glass dick
My first name is microphone, I call you last to spit
Bra and panties under your button up
Don't come around wit'cha ass hangin out, teasin me with fake tits
I'm the celebrity destroyer, I defecate on your shoulderblades
I jerk off on anybody that think they good
Grab the subway train, and drop turds on your bitch
Hit Philadelphia, grab a cheesesteak and hang out with Mitch
About two million dollars got fucked up
Hotel suites, Pave rings and girls and shit
Indoor rappin mansion-ass nigga
Come outside from that old hideaway bodyguards, watch you shit
I don't care, I enjoy myself you scared son of a bitch
Fuck the buckets and V.I.P. rooms
Posin with one Moet bottle, and a big-ass clique
Plast fast motherfuckers standin on wooden legs
Amateur niggas go down on cheap tape
What you think that bullshit gon' stick?

Lady Thinks She’s All That,The Personal Album,UnKnown,"See, it's not for everybody
But New York got these certain type of girls
See I'm not the problem
You don't put Keith in your mouth
You look mad, your face poked out
And I can't understand that
Girl you goin out every night with a twisted face
Lookin in the club for a husband
Baby you're disturbed and buggin, turnin off every man you meet
Your datin game is weak
Lookin for Mr. Right, Mr. See-Through, Mr. Light
Hussy you don't know everything, your mind stuck on some big wedding
White house, and white picket fence
Can't enjoy a simple walk at the mall, woman you on defense
Can't fight the evil, overweight with 5 stomachs
Classic New York girl, you're not a model, you're not equal
You're not equal

Lady thinks she's all that, and then some
You think you all that
Lady thinks she's all that, and then some
You think you all that

Dinner you eat entirely too much
You turn me off with stress wrinkles in your forehead
Your nasty mouth when you cuss
Think you deserve a limo when you originally just material for the bus
You never exercise but you want men to lust
Like it's strictly about you
Special things need a puppy dog to you
You mad, probably cause this song I wrote is so true
Just got a cellular phone like you doin somethin, brand new
You already dark like a salon, water tan
For overextreme actin your ugly rights, I oughta ban you
I know your kind


I complain because you think you look good
You don't even work out, you ain't everything
Searchin for a dumb-ass man, to put up with your suitcase full of junk
You're not exotic a regular squinched up face girl
If I was him I wouldn't buy you anything, unappreciative
And your dress style ain't creative
Poppin your Doublemint gum, makes your character ghetto
In reality don't get mad
I'm dealin with an undercover bum, a sassy ass
That needs more respect for herself
We as men deserve a quiet person, it's hard to find class",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-lady-thinks-shes-all-that-lyrics

Extravagant traveler, Puerto Rico out to Africa (4X)

MC's is wack, I'm lookin at the Robb Report
Eighty-thousand-sixty-two Bentley
Owner of the Houston Astrodome, Don King represent me
Prevost bus with gold trim and you can't act up frontin on your lemon
Legend status with keys to the MGM Grand
Got your wife and kids holdin my poster, grabbin my hand
All I hear is a bunch of wack primetime MC's sayin
I hate him cause he's great
He's on all the billboard and the highway
Face is on soup cans and milk crates
Restaraunts with movie theaters in 'em
Continental airlanes, planes we buyin off the lot
While y'all rent 'em
Excursion flights with Bill Clinton
Takin fine girls out to Washington to get they extensions
Usin my TV phone I see girls in they thongs
Fantasizin while they home alone
Pack my bags - I need room service
Chorus

Cause my face is in the newspaper every week
Pronounce words right - ask Jesse Jackson how I speak
Sign my autographs for Jagged Edge and Sisqo on 125th Street
Red carpet on the sidewalk
I gotta step on it before I talk
Part investor of the Utah Jazz, I'm the real king of New York
London cashmere, walkin around with Guiliani regular football shirt
Tailors grab my Armani, maids cook dinner
Sauteed fish and shrimp
Dallas Mavericks want me as a baldheaded five-eight guard
With a ninety-five inch vertical, Vince Carter respect my legs
Ask Shawn Kemp; (?) and the NBA commissioner
Takin pictures of me in front of Nell's
Special election day got chocolate girls with flowers dresses on
You would swear they Naomi Campbell and Nia Long from Section 8
Yes, I guess
Chorus

Bustin no freestyles, lookin at you in the back of the car
Rappin for twenty miles
I'm sittin in the back of the limo with the fly brim-o
Me in a black Cadillac, Elliot Ness
Sendin rappers with doo-rags an S.O.S
You wanna rap big man? Take Mickey Mouse off your chest
I let you wear your vest; plaid shirts or stripes
Is that the way your stylist make you dress?
She should be sued for that
Contract renewed for that
And on stage, you should be booed for that
I'mma tap you in the back and let everybody know they wack

But she thinks she's the baddest black
And I ain't havin' that, dig it

When I was coolin' at the bar
I am who I are but I ain't a superstar
It's like I wasn't born yesterday, why you tryin' play
Now maybe if I kicked the dummy roll then
You won't be so cold on the shoulder
But now you best move over
'Cause I'm older then you think, think about it

Givin' an eye wink to the brother with a gold link
Her friends lookin' at the parkin' lot the silver Benz

Lookin' for Sylvester, Arnold Schwarzenegger
A Rolls Royce parked, you left your man in his Vega
What kind of class did your mom teach ya home training?
You walkin' home tonight, awe man it's rainin'
But don't blame the rain because you're weave is loose
And your nails are pressed-on 'cause yo I got the juice
To get another one that looks just like ya
So I don't really sweat the situation, 'cause girl you got me basin'
But how ya like me now, now you know what's goin' on

Girls in Jail,Spankmaster,2001.0,"The date - summer, August 25th
You was transferred from Riker's Island to Attica State Prison
Gina, Thompson
I told you you shouldn'ta went out there with those other girls
And stole a coach bag out of Macy's
Arguin with me every night, you was crazy
Callin your grandmother sayin I beat you, you think I'm mental & crazy
That Benz you pulled up you stole you didn't faze me
You had a nice body with bikers
Inmates and female C.O.'s was lookin at your body at Riker's
I took time to write you a letter
But you wanted me to put dope in your sweater
I thought you was sick, with the flu, did you get any better?
Did you write back your Auntie Trineta?  Floss and don't pay
Jack say he seen you with a drug dealer that day
You woulda been better off takin the subway

My girl's in jail for life, never comin home - never comin home
She got to pay the price

You got too big in New York
You needed big hustlers around everywhere you walk
A lot of Cristal, fake ballers poppin corks
Now you in a two-inch cell, eatin eggs and pork
Friday the 13th, your birthday, the worst day
I still had love for your dumb ass anyway
Bentleys and Rolls Royces
The answering machine filled up with mysterious voices
Your moms Ms. Jones called, I was in the mall, she said
""Keith - Tina and Terry got them fake credit cards
They got my daughter out there - I ain't seen Gina in two weeks.""
I hung up the phone
I knew you was workin with some bronze pimp in the streets
(pimp in the streets.. pimp in the streets)

My girl's in jail for life, never comin home - never comin home
She got to pay the price

I called the operator to block the calls and stop the calls
The ceiling in my apartment was leakin like Niagara Falls
Sendin you a bunch of money, clothes and munchin money
You got a lot of phone call threats from a girl named Sunny
I seen the chick from the back
Puerto Rican girl with a nice ass drivin a black Cadillac
With a guy with long sideburns, is that your mack?
(is that your mack.. is that your mack)

My girl's in jail for life - you're a bad girl - never comin home

Blue phantom with the chrome hood
Your girl call me black foot
Piss out the window watch your urine bounce off your face
Last night at the Sheraton, Kenya Moore came up with white lace
Private visitor playing your girl like Witchita
Sit in the Bugatti with your girl and I co-park it
You ain't down for switching her
Denise Rossi type of tongue in her booty but they conservative
Tom Ford spread on my cock
I know you heard of this, introduced your wife to CK Shock
Manage Lady Gaga, after nine months I could turn Rihanna's baby pop
Queen Harrison give birth, ready to drop
What you know about the pastelle Lamborghini with the matte navy tires ready to roll up to shop
Your lady want butterscotch
Ice cream on the crotch
Rolex ten million, your girl see the watch
Twelve bottles, they call me Jon Sparks
No kin to Starks
I got rappers selling for me in Central Park
Jon King's oldest brother
Y'all still sipping day old Sutter
The mink coat melt of my shoulder like butter
I look like the Ohio players when I play synth

E.R. of this rap shit you must be a retard
Steeping to me, a keef
You got crazy beef
Our shit is rugged, you can't bite this with baby teeth
So pour the liquor slow
For the gigolo
And yo homie, your bitch want to blow me like a piccolo
I ain't the jealous type like that
And after she swallow I send your wife right back
Newly wed, watch out now, I'm bagging wipes
With wedding rings at the party, flashing nice
I got bragging rights
I be grabbing mikes
I be spitting that fire out of dragon pipes
Who these fag's claiming to have swag and tights
I'm a rock legend
These niggas rock leggings
And think they cute
No need to dispute
When I hear that wack shit I just press mute

Big whip, fat you own a orange Rolls Royce
Comin down Pico, up North Lenox
Heads with backpacks
Move like they try to act like they don't hear it
System bust, I don't rap freestyle no more
Stopped smokin angel dust
I bring drama to your tour bus, we comin all 800 of us
Project one, project two, project three
My Recena Houses, Jackson Houses, Webster Houses
How that sound to you mouses?
Jamaicans from ??, and Patterson Houses
""Lift up Star, Keith mon, let me know I'll cut 'is t'roat""
Other rappers standin around, jealous lookin broke
Need to be in double dutch, jumpin rope

That's how technical I get exquisite
Bangin on pipes
Lookin at cops walkin up the stairs with flashlights
Most MC's wearin leg-warmers and tights
I come with Dominican girls with bodies like Jennifer Lopez
Wearin tight shorts from Washington Heights
Ride first class with flights to Santo Domingo
With sombrero performin my single
With my hype-man Al Gringo
I'll watch you in the front cat don't let your face get wrinkled
Side effects miss you
Jump around you gonna need a napkin and a tissue
When I gross up the max you count the issue
Buy The Source cover for twelve months
And send other rappers over to pose
And take pictures for some potato chips and Cap'n Crunch
That's how I take suckers out to lunch

And you see the girls with the stripy shirts and the black pants
Sometimes you look around, they looking kinda good
They looking kinda good
Really good...

They sexy up in Foot Locker

Any momma playin' soccer
I'm lookin' at CK boxers
Girls look good wearin' tight black pants in Foot Locker
Come home and seduce me with your stripy top-a
She seduce and release sticky juice real proper
Give her a pair, make her red bottom booty pop-a
Thongs fit nice when you rockin' 'em
You wanna twerk in Nikes, no problem
You say you've been in the land on a martyr
Your sugar-walls leak, it's a honor
You're doing the hair short, Bronner's
I'm bringing Magnum condoms
Put the tug in your butt to make you wonder
Is it raining down your legs? Lightnin' and loud thunder
Have you been to the mall? Take your draws off at Batman and Robin
Anything to make Batgirl wonder
Let me check if you're moist and ready
The mechanic got you moving your G-string to look under
Astro glide, I supply, in front of Wonder Woman's eyes, on the rubber
Give you nice strokes for a hour before I come in up, bust a
Catch it before the NFL rusher
Release the dessert she call a custard...

She asked what size do I wear
Magnum XL, let me slide up in there
Meet me on your lunch break, outside, my dear
And before she gave me dome, she tied up her hair
Her oblige to prepare got a rise from my pair
Her manager might be slightly aware
They say foot action got action, oh my contrail
Foot Locker got it locked, they take pride in their care
I'm a satisfied customer, you see my grin
I'm a VIP member since way-back-when
When it's tax-free weekend, I'll be back again
What's the pussy return policy? Please tell me again
And oh, by the way, I'd like to refer a good friend
He asked if the night shift girl can keep her bush trimmed
You sold out my size, all you have is size 10?
Oh well, that's fine, see you next time, thanks again

Whassup baby, this is Keith
I want you to take this picture
Want you to stand right over there
That's right, turn around
Alright, spread your legs
Put your hands up on the wall, poke it out
Yeah poke it out like they do in Black Tail
Show me how you poke it out baby
Alright, lean it over, let the thong show a little bit
Honey loves to play with herself, lay in the bed with the toys
At heavy masturbation level, decibels beyond treble
The Vaseline abuser, the grease seducer
Holdin her whole butthole open with the springs under her bed broken
With tight thongs, she pump back
I ride her horse ass like an Aqueduct racetrack
Straddle your underwear like a jockey
Sixteen inch TV screen butt, with handlebars like a Kawasaki
Motorcycle helmet over my head (motorcycle helmet over my head)

Varoom! Tear that thang up {*repeat 3X*}

Motocross ride her shirt from the back like a dirtbike
Her bed is the highway, her vagina flash a green light
Her buttcrack expands, she show me them chrome anal pipes
Apple cheeks I bite; watch your pubic hair
Like a gas man in the basement with a flashlight
Girl don't be stiff you gotta move your ass right
Turn over like a piece of chicken when the fork stick in
Put on your gloves and mittens, purr out your cum like kittens


Awkward with the SCUBA diving suit in your waterbeddy
50 thousand panties spin in the dryer with Tampax inserts
Don't lie if you're not ready
STP fuel, your weave gotta stay on the road
150 around the track
I know the speedway like Al Unser's son
You get your engine checked at Getty
With truck tails in my face, I watch buns jiggle
Back up into the parking space
I pull up to the side of the grey bra, like a racer triple X
Rev up the RPM and say let's race
Let's race baby

Pussy stinkin, who brought these freaks yo, what you thinkin

With that fast talk, fast walk, ass is flat on sidewalk
Big coochie intakes, digest shrimp, stomach pork
Your feedback, smoke weed back, butt naked we don't need that
Shut down yo' circuit, watch me kid, fuckin work it
Overtime rhymer, don't bite my shit like pirahna
Fuck rock'n'roll, never catch me man, Cher and Nirvana
See-through skirts, burnin brother sticks like fireworks
New York in 10-B, apartment house, where her friends be
Dykes with mics get played like Cameo the fuckin Chi-Lites
Problems I have 'em, that's right you motherfuckers grab 'em
Piss on yo' fish lens, disrespectin all yo' friends
Take my food back, your weave out, your fuckin glue back
Your hair in pieces, with just enough for chocolate Reese's

Psycho, still klepto, destroy them girls with reps though
Niggas pause backstep though, I'm classical, bust asshole
Remember 'bout that last ho, you fucked up, you switched up
Ran up out the club, took that little cash you bitched up
Power strong, my gators long, feel cats, them pussies warm
On steam like dream team, peep game with face schemes
You make a right I make a left, sound def, my arts and craft
Fuck y'all, y'all make me laugh, raw skill with paragraphs
Cut ass so fast and have, express rock East and West
You fucked up, yo' rap is weak, that shit you talk and how you speak
You suck dick I pull yo' tits you wash well, I like yo' clits
Top to bottom got 'em movin, hittin screamin stop it man
Nasty with - game plan, new style - same man
Switch yo with swift flow, Bronx kid, I let you know
Alternatin bass and pipes the crowds in this fuckin place
Girls get glassed at mad, problems on they fuckin rag
Play tags with doo rags, I flame broil, light up fast
Girls look, jockin me, there's no time, stoppin me
Groupin me, hatin me, swingin G yo fuck it B
Technique that run street, like Celly Cel, I got heat
Upbeat, and offbeat, suck my dick, take yo' pick

Styles rep from Northwest, shiftin, affectin wreckin
Movin on the channel panel, stupid bitch, can you handle
Observe words, niggas got you cryin on the curb
Enjoy my tempo, rap style, fuckin simple
I heard your demo kid, ridin in the fuckin limo
Skippin your pause button, ladies melt, press rewind
You must be crazy, runnin game out your fuckin mind
Stylistic weaves, dirty spot stains on your sleeves
Like Beenie Man, turn the track up, girl shut the fuck up
My style is dope kid, wind it up, yes I'm open
Masquerade, Bacardi flip wigs, turn the party
Unique and speakin, shoes shined for the weekend
My style is pumped up, in time watch you fuckin jump up
Turn up yo' bump up, on stage bring the fuckin punk up
Open up hairpiece, music bass, turn the trunk up
Prepare for blasthole, up close, I'm in yo' asshole
Automatically, you stand there, you fuckin mad at me
Whippin yo' lip up, with verbal hits from yo' hip up
Stand back and guard crack, P watch yo' fuckin back

Cause, because..""
""Okay, thank you. I well I'd agree with anything you say
In regards to that.. because, what's obvious is what's obvious.""
""They they feel that they're not gettin paid?""

You heard 
Jeremy Lawner
 got shot four times in the face
Standin on West 8th Street, two blocks from Park Place
It was a set up, professionally how he got wet up
Closed casket service; the guy said he jerked Eminem, and Coolio
Plus Korn - machine guns had his ligaments torn
Police asked me what happened, I don't know I'm steady rappin
Excuse me as a suspect, that's a hot lie
I did not give a man a gun, near Gray's Papaya
I was home down South, that's what he get, street connections
Sam bit it, I'm not it, the kid was runnin his mouth
Order in the court, did you or did not shoot this man?
What I heard, booking agencies giving loot to this man
Check my fingerprints, my hair never touched that gun
I never spoke to anyone, the F.B.I.'s at my house
Chorus: Kool Keith (repeat 2X)
Shoes n suits! Shoes n suits!
Supreme Court..

Investigators ridin on my elevator for questionin
I'm just a plain MC, why do y'all wanna see me
I have no clue about what that person went through
Is it true that y'all was gonna tell us
Who was gonna cut his hands off
Leave the body rottin for 3 days in the back of a Wendy's Drivethru
Look for my fingerprints, what did I do?
Narrator of a true story
To write somethin fake, would bore me
I babysit three kids, you guys act like y'all never saw me
The D.A. said, ""Keith you're not guilty""
But the dead client's mouth was filthy
Gun from Virginia registered under Silky
""Keith do you recognize these pictures?""
8 suspects from the projects
No I never seen these people in my life
I don't recognize them your honor
Chorus

So he ain't callin shots for you, I got respect
I just turned down a major label project
Witnesses say you're carryin a mac-10 semiautomatic, a black object
Check my house, just a Chia pet
7:30 when he was shot - I wasn't travelin
He was on the first class with two men, on a Continental airline jet
The prosecutor says I'm innocent
That's somebody else's glove by the steps
Is it true, that part of your crew
Wanted to set this man on the couch
Light a match, pour gasoline in his lap and set him on fire?
Connect his 500 Benz to a phone-tap wire
Breakin his window glass like an armed Goldie with a hockey mask
With two forty-four Magnums, one in his mouth, one in his ass
His relatives ties with three links to his murder
I never heard of, but in Philly he tried to scam Roger Troutman
Sharpshooters hit him point blank on the side of his celly phone ear
Bullets hit his rearview mirror
Shots rang out from a Cadillac Catera
The guy made a bad error
Chorus 1.5X",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-shoes-n-suits-lyrics

Billboard hate you; you corny motherfuckers are fake too
Wit'cha robot format, stick a bomb on your asscrack
Who sponsor you motherfuckers, Speed stick deodorant
You motherfuckers yeah - you owe the rent
Get rid of your staff they make me laugh with that local-ass shit
Y'all play all day talkin shit
And sittin on the toilet even Clear Channel's mad
All y'all do is flush toilets and shit all day
Report some ol' bullshit to BDS, like y'all the best

Gun down the P.D.; hold Angie Mar'

I kick her face in; tie dynamite, to her nipples
I put a dildo in her mouth and if she moves flip the switch dude
It's doom, aiyyo the end of an era
Backstabbin bastards, no-talent asses
Angie got a bastard child by Nokio (faggot)
That has-been groupie bitch shoulda fuckin known
Flex is a fruitcake nigga, fat faggot
Transvestite lover on Hunt's Point every night
Do a show with RuPaul, troublemaker, softest nigga
In the city, guys cum on his fuckin titty
The worst DJ on KISS, you owe Chuck Chillout bitch
You got nerve to act large trick
You duck and hide, too many niggas gettin shot outside (Game)
You gon' learn when that car show gets interrupted
A news break, they drove a Navi through your fuckin gate


The type of niggas y'all fuck with little kids havin incest
A couple of years ago y'all was the first critics with that bullshit
Talkin about down South was weak, y'all was dissin Mannie Fresh
Only when Snoop come to town, y'all play his shit
Actin like y'all supportin the West; lyin-ass niggas
Frank Crock' tryin-ass niggas
Slick suckin dick-ass niggas
Nuts when they get into town; I was listenin to Master P and shit
When you motherfuckers was hatin 'em

Fakin moves, you bluffin eyebrow pluckin

Tellin me, often-ly
It's surprising me, they paying me
Coming to slang, tryin to hang

Riffin and steppin no weapon and dead 'em

Make sure you get back with me
I'll talk to you soon, bye
I'm on the phone, dialing your number 'cause you my only girl
Exotic lover like a freak from another world
I like your style, your boots and your sex smile
You're a dancer at night, baby that's alright
Shakin' ya thing entertaining in the neon light
Your boss get mad every time I talk to you
Your girl friends laugh, ""Go head girl"" when I walk with you
And some punks don't know, they can't treat ya good
I'm just the sex champ to hit ya with that good wood
Lay you down and rub my oils all over
I got the stuff to make your honey pot boil over
I give you tips for trips, I like your clam dips
Come and dance slow and wind for the horny pro
Let me wet you up, honey slide 'em down
Let me wet you up, honey slide 'em down
(Slide 'em down)
Let me wet you up, rub it all around
(Rub it all around)
Let me wet you up, honey slide 'em down
(Slide 'em down)
Let me wet you up, rub it all around
(Rub it all around)
I see your girl friends dance, but my eye's on you
I give love to sugar brown, you know what to do
Makin' money for the kids or the family home
I understand baby doll why you purr and moan
You walk around the club in sexy underwear
Suckers want too much for nuthin' they don't care
I'm Big Willie home, my plane just arrived from Rome
My Caddy's light green, my rag top is trimmed with chrome
I bought you a present, lingerie, here's a gift
Don't talk with low budget pests, and hell with Nick Swift
I'm the man of your dream, while fools panty scheme
Comin' like Will, Dr. Smith with a laser-beam
Lost in space, no class I got taste
I'm watchin' you now, take your pennies out her face
Here's a 50 there's a lot of people livin' thrifty
I know your stressed, perhaps you do need the rest
You do your job right, but Marvin wants most for less
Back in the cut, he wants to ill again
Who wants a man with 20 cents look like Gilligan
Come here baby escape, you evacuate
Lay up on my shoulders in love and won't hesitate
I come and ease up, walk you through the alley
My girl from the ghetto, not a nerd from the valley
Let me wet you up, honey slide 'em down
Let me wet you up, honey slide 'em down
(Slide 'em down)
Let me wet you up, rub it all around
(Rub it all around)
Let me wet you up, honey slide 'em down
(Slide 'em down)
Let me wet you up, rub it all around
(Rub it all around)
It's been some hours waiting for you, your greatest fan
With my fingers in flavor I lick your juices off my hand
You bump and grind and wind, I know that hottie's mine
Sippin' on some Seagrams, the Smith's see his girl is fine
When it's time to close, who be lickin' toes
I'm in this piece, while you flashin' for them average joes
You rubbin' heads and chairs in no mattress beds
Beauty queens on stage, her friends look like thorough-breds
Tryin' lean on the green, ya sista's 19
Tell her watch out, them fake pimp's 'ill make her panties cream
You goto college workin' hard for your PHD
Then come home and give your soft skin, your love to me
They don't know I'm in the place peepin' out the show
Drinkin' Heinkens, the green bottles Beck's style
Put on your leather and come and learn the next style
Let me wet you up, honey slide 'em down
Let me wet you up, honey slide 'em down
(Slide 'em down)
Let me wet you up, rub it all around
(Rub it all around)
Let me wet you up, honey slide 'em down
(Slide 'em down)
Let me wet you up, rub it all around
(Rub it all around)
C'mon baby, c 'mon baby
Woo, woo, woo baby, woo, woo, woo baby
I want to rub you up baby, I want to rub you baby
I want to lick you up baby, I can't wait to lick you up baby",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-wet-you-up-lyrics

Alright, where you want me to start at?
Aiyyo you can kill the music then
Yo, check one two, check one two in the place to be
From the bottom to the T-O-P

From Bronx to L.A., we don't fail

My man Kool Keith, H-Bomb, no jive
Yo, H-Bomb, hit 'em in the head son

No blazes, tennis shoes and denim
Pimp I got the gators, leathers I kill 'em
Your bullshit events, don't play right
No tribute awards for Mr. Barry White
It's Guantanamo Bay, industry's gay
Hard to get rich, I don't swing that way
That switch to funny make record in Kingston
Jesus is black, tell Mel Gibson
Who wears a skirt, Sting and Dave Navarro
My strap, my money, don't lend, don't borrow
The Sunset Strip is Gaza Strip
Your clothin line is shit, H is fuckin sick!
The rap game industry too quiet
Hehehehehe hah hah Atkins Diet
No backpackers pro-athlete actors
I rep for pimps, pushers, jackers
The P on the fitted I'm all for pimps
I throw ropes down for my niggas in the clink (yeahhhh boy!)
First and foremost, the industry don't want it
Fuck it, I take what I want and flaunt it
I'm not vexed, they spend for sex
Who's next after Michael, fuck Funkmaster Flex

Yeahhhh boyee, kickin it for 7th Veil

Fuck Hollywood's best guest list
Maximum dead-ass parties with flat-ass Paris Hilton
My shit shine bright with Von Dutch wipe
Jockin my gators, bitches with fake titties act like
They don't suck dick, can you see me under the standard light
Fuck the red carpet, I'm in here with standard hype
You just at the crib on Sycamore
Your blonde cocker spaniel, my rings shine in your face
Youse a asswipe, you basketball player nut and scrotum jocker
You the givin ass type, with the Minnesota Timberwolves
Garnett's clockin your ass pipe
Ugly monster-face bitch, you think you dressed tight
Evil bastard, you make your grandmother upset
Don't flush the toilet motherfucker, you tryin to start a fight
Release the shit off my chest, get rid of the gripe
I shit inside your grey and white Nikes
Exercise your fat stomachs, no hamburgers at Chevies
You ride them fuckin bikes
Corny-ass 42 year old player's club bitch
The funky face motherfuckin Wanda Sykes
That baldheaded motherfucker just put a weave in, on UPN
Whack-ass tattoos above your titties
Your hard faced bitch, you'll see me again
Like Faith Evans is the only one that sniffs
All you cocaine motherfuckers in the hills
Even Vivica Fox is a ugly bitch, chasin Curtis for his chips

You hip and hop up, don't make the steel pop up
If you was biscuits with gravy you get sloped up
Yo wake up, yo pay me your semen's getting wetter
I write 'em at home and send a funky sexy letter
You gotta go home your baby stay is real early

Captain Save Em,Spankmaster,2001.0,"Yeah
All you ladies walkin around in the club
With them fake engagement rings on
Acting like you married
The Captain is here
We shall report to the front
And all you guys acting like you real players
Who always talk behind peopla back
I never see you with no girls!
It's gettin kinda strange, funny style
Let the Captain begin

White Stesson hat, fur manicure, matchin mink
Makin NBA players start to think, who's that standin' over there
Takin pictures for Rolling Stone magazine with a leash on a polar bear
Sky blue suit from Milan, girls posin their executive area
Acting like they don't see me, standin in front of me
Walkin by me three or four times
Showin me views of they Victoria Secret thongs, tryin to turn me on
Eyewitness news interrupt the Shane Mosley fight
Just to pan in closer to my shoes
Televised, myself beyond cellular phones and buisness cards, I network
Make the Billboard, number one singers and rappers
People from RCA, Clive Davis net-hurt

Save 'em (save 'em)
Captain save 'em all (save 'em all)
Save 'em (save 'em)
Captain save 'em all (save 'em all)

Cover my face with Rayban glasses, from photographers I try to hide
Ladies with lingerie cry, cause I wear protection won't come inside
Places get empty when I leave
Pay butlers 600 dollars a minute just to adjust my cufflinks, and my shirtsleave
In 2003, in the double R, I lean metallic green
Professional chauffeurs over my doors
Women lust over my lyrics like basketball players
NFL teams walk up unbenouced
Excuse me! I'm talkin to Tristar Pictures right now
Keyshawn Johnson I heard you a great football star
I'm not plastic, but I'm on a conference call
Talking to Michelle Phieffer and Ben Barene
Go down stairs to the movie theaters
Me and my old lady like the persuaders
Morrie alligators, 800 combination flavors
Countin presidents, we stand with cash mil's, like the Miz


Jacuzzi bathtub, with a 24-second clock to take your panties down
If not most girls get replaced by a sub
Sent home, upscale in a limosine with a Subway sandwich and a dub
Erased from the system
I move better, collared shirt made of leather
Why would you be walking around Beverley Hills wearin pleather?
With lights, camera, action
A part of my MCing is a small fraction
Strong machines coming on Greyhound from Memphis
Girls screamin at the Captain, ""I wanna be saved!""
Me and Barbara Streisand walking down the corridor, with more
(And so much to offer)

Save 'em! (save 'em)",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-captain-save-em-lyrics
Jealous,Spankmaster,2001.0,"I used to be at Mars with Flex; now everything changed
He was the only one in the room DJing - empty room
He was cool back then, used to talk to niggas
Now he can't say hi on the street, big boy
I knew Angie Martinez - 12 o'clock midnight nobody listened to her show
Now she wanna rap

Yeah, all the motherfuckers are jealous of each other
All that click shit is bullshit
Everybody mad, cause this guy got the record before this guy
This guy don't play this guy
Because this guy got the record before that guy
DJ, This is bigger than DJ That - and all that bullshit
Niggas - actin like they don't see a motherfucker
Turnin they heads the other way, that's some ol' bitch-ass shit
I can't fuck with them mixtape niggas
A lot of them New York DJ's are jealous
I don't give a FUCK about Funkmaster Flex
He don't give a FUCK about me
They ain't playin my shit on MTV, a bunch of wack niggas kissin ass
Same commercial MC's, you ever notice niggas look at your feet first?
Envious faggots are worse - fuck the 106 Park shit
I'm on some dark shit, niggas are plastic
Tec-9 blast through your Avirex fabric
What's the fuck up with Mister Cee and Mr. Magic?
Steve Smith, gon' STILL act like bastard
A lot of niggas need to see some cables and rope
Tied in basement with New York police department smellin gunsmoke
Act like you don't see me, turn your fuckin face backwards
A decade of jealousy
What the fuck y'all tellin me?
Don't act like you don't remember me
You used to bump my shit in Mars
Now you on some trim goatee shit like El DeBarge
Fuck the Tunnel tonight and that petty shit at the Garage
And Jimmy's Cafe shit, I ain't on nobody's dick
I remember when BET wasn't shit!
After a certain time on that channel, owned by white people
Fuck y'all night people
Suckin ass ain't my forte, you fuckin with the right people
Is Stretch bumpin my shit?
Do I have to pay niggas with envelopes and a bottle of Cris'?
Fuck a Rolex, I got the same shit you got on my wrist
All that jealousy shit is mayonnaise and celery shit
Y'all hated down South and West coast rappers one time
Now everybody that was frontin is now slurpin they dick
Inhalin like Menthols and Vicks
Most of y'all can't stand to see a nigga shine with jewelry and kicks
Bad bitches and chicks, stop hatin each other
Motherfuckers this is the ""Jealousy"" remix (Hot 97, remix!)
Jealousy, jealous motherfuckers
Jealous..
Jealous motherfuckers (W-B-L-S)
Y'all jealous of each other, jealous of each other
Jealous..
Jealous of each other (92.3 the Beat)
Jealous motherfuckers
Jealous motherfuckers! Y'all some jealous motherfuckers
Jealous motherfuckers
Yeah
Now I used to know, Bambaataa used to play everybody's shit
I ain't think even Kool Herc came out with some ol' bullshit like that
When all the DJ's, back in the days, them niggas stuck to-fuckin-gether
You see, Theodore, didn't mind, Mean Gene, on his set
Now these new motherfuckers, are like, on some new futuristic shit
But I'ma give y'all some 2003 shit to work with, for a little bit
Jealous motherfuckers - jealous of each other
Jealous.. motherfuckers",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-jealous-lyrics
Mad Man Departure,Matthew,2000.0,"Yeah.. outro, Mad Man
Everytime I see your motherfuckin ass
You always with some motherfuckers around you
You know why?  Cause you're motherfuckin scared
But I'mma pick you out motherfucker
I like to boost myself cause all you niggas can kiss my ass
Critics lick my balls, bitches get jealous
Y'all on some old funny-ass shit, hang with a bunch of fellas
You can't fuck with me, 
shiny head like Telly Savales
Look at your favorite rap star, corny as a MOTHERFUCKER
Scarecrow hardcore
I flip your tour bus over, pull your plug on your stage show
On your fuckin tour
Put a piece of your fuckin hand in the refrigerator
Book your shit Monday
You see me with three niggas with stockin caps
With sawed-off shotguns, waiting for your black ass
Then come to Apollo to play, blow your session away
You don't wanna fuck around
I don't give a fuck if you in the studio with bodyguards
You can hide behind fuckin 
Big Ray
Bash you in the face with a fuckin ashtray
Move you out in a STRETCHER
Walk you to the fuckin ambulance
With blood all over my fuckin pants
That's what you get for tryin to do a b-boy stance
Next I'mma step to all you homo ass niggas that dance
Move that glittery shit out my vision
And face the fuckin collision
Treat you like the Lifers Group
27 years, I'mma act like I'm in fuckin prison
Say somethin now motherfucker, say somethin!
I bite your fuckin nose, spit back in your fuckin lap
See somethin funny?  See somethin funny?!
SEE SOMETHIN FUNNY MOTHERFUCKER?!
Amputate your face off
Fuck around cut your shoulder blade off
Disconnect three of your fingers
You won't be able to point at shit
Or wave a fuckin cab down
Look at you bleedin with that rap shit on the fuckin ground
That's right motherfucker
You knew I was comin to see you from the beginning
But you was talking all that bullshit
But I'mma see you in, time
That's right, when I get to yo' motherfuckin ass
I'ma work my way up there
See youse a faggot ass nigga
You moved to the suburbs
You think you safe, workin by phone
You can't go nowhere, and you hide
You stay in hose, playing Sega Genesis
And smoke a bunch of fucking weed, that's right
Looking at each other
Fucking each other in the ass
Bullshitting and playing with PlayStation
I'ma tell you straight
I ain't no kid, I'm a grown-ass fucking man",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-mad-man-departure-lyrics

The National, Basketball, Association
We begin (""well that's alright"")
Your man is a tourin nigga, six-foot-eight floss nigga
Who carries champagne in the club with Coogi sweaters
Borin nigga, no game havin
Less rap skill, N.B.A. nigga with a studio you ill
Don't you know my game terrorize
Six-foot-three guards on the microphone, my lyrics kill
Why don't you awkward niggas stop rhymin and take a birth control pill
Jackson got you gassed, ask Phil
I'm not impressed with your full court press
Girls with Tyra Banks weaves, and Lisa Raye's complexion
Can step up to the foul line for an AIDS test
My jewelry like big trucks
I don't care if you flash your Milwaukee Bucks
Even bodyguards couldn't protect you ducks
I care less if you a Trailblazer
My cris-cross on girls is sharp, y'all get cut off with a razor
Even if you have braids like Latrell
I got more numbers in my system than Pacific Bell
Pass the basketball around and go tell
Smoother than Rick Fox puttin on his hair gel
Groupies don't have to know me, just swallow my sperm when you blow me
Keith look in the club for your celebrity jump shooters
Tall lean men who can't read books to they kids need tutors
You cats got the nerve to try to stop my tomahawk dunks
By e-mailing, golddiggers on computers
Leap over y'all with color and fashion
Lame assholes in black pinstripe suits, keep steppin and passin
Beyond the youse-a-baby, you broke finished payin for them car notes
I'm the championship nigga youse a loser (""well that's alright"")

Girl You Know,The Lost Masters,2009,"(You know the outcome)
Girl you know the game, and when you start to run
Who is this new guy, thinkin he's funky
He ain't nothin, girl you know

Rappers who freestyle forever
Can't afford to buy a cup of cocoa admire my leather
Your girl get wetter, touchin my custom made chains
Your lip gloss on my, Italian sweater
I know you hate me already, go debate me with Freddie
DJ's gonna act like little feminine, in more places
Bought the high heels, on the hard concrete
Remove your women's bra, feel chest
Wipe your eyeliners off your baseball cap
The Starter jacket don't match yo' faces
You put the thongs on, move your panty protectors in the right places
Terror in America, feel my drama, defecate on your baby's momma
I sport the real gators, Lou Casey and Tony Llama
Y'all act like divas with a flat ass like Madonna
Party whereabouts don't ask me
Hold your Zippendales, this ain't Chippendales
Y'all flippendales, move slow like snails
Thongs show your girl's tails, y'all blaze L's (L's)

Girl you know, the man ain't funky
But the brother is whack yo
Ah-what you tell your man girl?

Remington blows with shells
Big Hank movin dank comin up the road with a full tank
Make your girl buy another drink
Joe Greico, we break neck-o, hand your wife the peppermints
Who represents, y'all couldn't close to me one inch
Y'all need to sit down on the wood like Johnny Bench
Y'all know the Borden family, your fiance drive a Camry
Your hype man name is Annie
Your producer in the background wear the black panties
No time for the clean-up service or nannies


Feeble position wackster, what's up blackster
Lyrical master, asshole plaster
You a known hitter, with the first base glove
Your mom with the catcher's mitt-er
Pamper for your babysitter
Foul smells, your house smell like cat litter
Don't get bitter, I move and get rid of
Can't flow average, maverage
Rabid food, vegetable particles, final cabbage
You got the nerve to rap like you live in Paris
Standard reels, I clown dummies
When your first advance is in your deal
Stage level, stiff with no skills
A bird with beak and bills
I crush you from New York all the way out to Hollywood Hills

Koooooooooooooooooool, Keith, whatevah

Like Big Daddy Kane say rappers steppin to me

Rubba Love,Sex Style: The Unreleased Archives,2008,"Yeah, check it out
Kool Keith is back y'all
Big Wille, Papa Large, kickin' the funk for you
Jealous people out there, check it out
I see you moving your feet, bopin' ya head
Noddin' ya head, dropin' ya head
The sounds of the phantom, kickin' on the dance floor
You move and boogie more
I represent for the world like the president
Strong as a bag of dust, style like and elephant
No rapper out there, MC's on my public hair
Girls stare, section 8, I'm on welfare
Collectin' papes and hearing whack city tapes
You in the fruit crew rappin' with a bunch of grapes
I see MC's on videos and the music box
That story's weak that your mean and you're bustin' Glocks
You're just an old stone kid, pebble throwin' rocks
I'd rather drive and ooh with your girl friend
Your man is ugly the kid look like Gentle Ben
Don't get hype 'cause your style man ain't my type
You better step off I see it in your eye
Don't get jealous your heart pumps rubba love, rubba love
Don't get jealous your heart pumps rubba love, rubba love
Don't get jealous your heart pumps rubba love, rubba love
Don't get jealous your heart pumps rubba love, rubba love
Back again my friend, I drop you spin the record
One stations' confused and the others can't check it
You playin' stuff to me that sounds local
I didn't even hear it down south in Acapulco
I write national you play it for the whole world
Brothers with the perm and girls with the Jheri Curl
So many rapper, I have to call Sandman
Do, do in the pollo and everybody's whack, man
I watch BET and MTV
Around the globe all the girls wanna see me
I'm in your club tonight, I can wear a suit
With my man Malik, L.O., spendin' mega loot
My pockets fat, my Caddy with a diamondback
Mature honey's get wet, wanna hit the sack
I count 10 though and throw it on a Coup De Ville
I'm up in Burbank with acres out in Cherry Hill
I'm livin' stupid and people think I'm Bob Barker
With my food stamps, I'm home watchin' Archie Bunker
My neighbor's nosy that old lady Rosie
Sucka's in the musical biz think they know me
They buyin' charts and flicks in the Billboard
Can't rap for crap with nerve to hold a mic chord
I cut radio waves with a Zoro Sword
You think I'm small lady in the red Ford
You in the mirror lookin' in my face
Ah ha, so that's how it is?
Don't get jealous your heart pumps rubba love, rubba love
Don't get jealous your heart pumps rubba love, rubba love
Don't get jealous your heart pumps rubba love, rubba love
Don't get jealous your heart pumps rubba love, rubba love
Third and Lex I fix my radio a sudden change
That R&B live band with singers sounds strange
Everybody's a fool if you think it's cool
Sittin' with Ex-Lax on the potty stool
I got tissue for you in the projects
Playin' the bomb drinkin' Balantine X
I see brothers in cars pump they Alpine
They bought Snoop Dog and want a free tape of mine
Shame on you baby paw you so cheap
I hop in a Cadillac and drive up the street
I see my man, my tape he bought in his hand
He got green stacks and props in a rubber band
I'm on the wheel side drivin' on the left side
Checkin' out honey dips and freaks on the westside
I got big blow and all sorts of Bubble Yum
Bad breath kids step, rappers need chewing gum
I'm like De La, droppin' kickin' more soul
Sounds are new and they drum machines sound old
Lyrical dummies, I make 'em turn do a summy
Girls surprised I'm black and I'm not bummy
I ride the train and still flip out on your brain
I move your dome to a lot lift it with a crane
You on my D head get back off my chisel
Chic a chic, ah wee
Don't get jealous your heart pumps rubba love, rubba love
Don't get jealous your heart pumps rubba love, rubba love
Don't get jealous your heart pumps rubba love, rubba love
Don't get jealous your heart pumps rubba love, rubba love

Serve ’Em a Sentence,Diesel Truckers,2004.0,"Yeah I'm tellin you, it's really bad out there
People out there they doin too much
You guys are lucky I don't have my finger over the button
Cause I'd push it, I'm not playin
You need more than your hand slapped

Stop and stare, what would it be like
If New York had the electric chair?
Eight years if you caught with a gun
Would that eliminate the fun?
Child support, cut your hand off if you don't take care of your son
Only people in a wheelchair can receive welfare
Take care of your own abortion
Every hospital in the city don't care
They signed the legislation
Robbery, you face castration
Tough lawyers can't even fight the litigation
3 weeks in jail for smokin cigarettes in public
Curfew, everybody go home at 2 in the afternoon
Murder an elderly lady, you die in the gas room
Rapist, put them in hot water
Let the public throw hot grease on 'em in a bathroom

(Serve 'em a sentence) Mess around
And be orange jumpsuited for life, you gotta pay a price
(Serve 'em a sentence) Fugitives don't run
The shotgun'll smell smoke from the barrel of one
(Serve that kid) Straight whup your body
When you dance with a cyclone fence
(Serve 'em a sentence) Knock knock you there?
Open up, assume position for the handcuffs

Anybody with a white sheet on
Not playin, a ghost a Halloween arrest 'em on the scene
Transplant 'em with different races organs live on TV
Then drop 'em in Oz and let the Aryans turn on 'em
Every other race in the pen'll do a train on 'em
You sick duck sick now, who want a kitty bone?
Watchin kiddie porn, the public would go biblical
Be seein your ass'll get stoned
Kidnappers I'ma teach you, your ass'll get cloned
And yourself'll take yourself
And treat yourself like yourself, your self killed
Yeah trifling how it felt
Expect a rading in public assistance delf
You know your saliva was whack
Witness a murder and you could lose an eyelid for that
Cure for total fraud, electric chair is over
While you wearin a {?} for the bowler


Give you a 27-to-life for molestin children
Put you in a dorm, let you breathe in anthrax
Torture you worser than Hitler
Go 'head touch a baby's private, I'll fix ya
Clean the highway eight times a day
Chief officials, increase the death sentence
Mr. Blackstone, do it my way
Stick up a store I'll take your eyes away

Act black, you turn black
Or what you so-called call black, you sayin nigga to each other
You feel black, but what you gon' do
When the feds attack black, act white proper on sight
You send spam or virus, embalmin fluid with AIDS
Injected into the body 'til it blows up like a grenade
Red light run and your head will concave
Suffer 'til the fine's paid",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-serve-em-a-sentence-lyrics

Why's your face tight
Is it because I'm shining and you taste light
You're a special case right
Identical
That's where I met you critical
Fucking salty individuals
Stinging like a cut
I'm the alcohol, propofol
Put your ass to sleep
Keep groping ya'll draws
On ya face like a rap party pound pat party Benz with some Bacardi we smoking in the lobby
It's a hobby never smoking bumpy looking poppy
Hitting home-runs kicking like our body
You'll never stop me fucking spike trip I mic trip
On ya paper hold down with a tight grip I'm psychic
Watch ya side chick
You've been demoted to a side kick
She's riding my dick apparently you like it
Apparently your blinded
Constantly reminded of the doctor making house cause you lost one behind it

We give zero fucks
We give zero fucks

All my Cypress Hill coming down to metaphoric spitter
Butter ball so good I heard the word with my turkey givers
My fast ball, fourth ball got the Dodgers interested in my spitter
The right hand that got you up at back with a Huggies pamper
Perce Amber name ya high heel dancer
I'm looking for publicity with the canons
No need for a selfie and the camera
The fucking McLaren is orange mandarin
The ladies blowing my dick like the wind
My trim is to pull up on their ass and finger bend
Get cozy with Khloe Kardashian intimate
Any motherfucker you thinking rap send them in
Let them cook chicken
Take a ticket it for a ass whooping
The Nets want me to play in Brooklyn
Keep the hottest bitch looking
With a thong up her booty cooking
The rookie is on my shit like drugs that hooked in
I keep the queen pussy douching
Combat boot stepping on grown men and women
Niggas work in the factories put me a refrigerator pulling
Reliable workers you never heard of who wouldn't
Mother fuck ya

(There's different ways you could do it)
It may not be, it may like KRS just preachin
But there's somethin entertainin to people like y'know
I got the girls on the dancefloor!
It's like, what, where you wanna go, preach like y'know well
In the spirits of the time, and the time and see
It'll be alternative or you can be...
Regular R&B where it's still like y'know
Girls get the night, got the long hair!

Girls this track's for you
We go out at night with our girls, wearin our stripper outfits
Just to front all night like a flower arrangement
The truth is, we wanna take our clothes off and get
Nasty after sweatin and dancin all night
So represent ladies and let the brothers know what you really want
Behind closed doors (behind closed doors) twinkle twinkle big star
How I want you so hard up inside of me so far
Ooh you know I want some more, come inside my candy store
And don't forget to close the door
I wear my boots up to my thighs, my booty shorts come up so high
My cleavage lets you see my size
I pull my thongs off to the side and let you take a peak inside
I'm tired of my pocket rocket, I really need you in my socket
I wanna pose so you can see how nasty I can truly be
I love to flirt, and tease you too
I wanna dance and, strip for you
Let's turn the strobelight on tonight, a show for you behind closed doors
At night I sit around and wish that you could, really lick my... clit
Behind, closed doors (behind closed doors)
Behiiind, closed doorsssss (behind)
Now that's enough of all this chat
Come watch me now as I do my act
No premies please, just stay cock hard as I begin to, shake my ass
Let's, rub that oil on my skin it's time for you, and that personal lapdance
As I bounce and glide up and down your pants
If you pull my thongs down to the side, don't forget to finger that sweet spot
Girls you know, so tell the truth, all I want is to get, wet for you
We're not shy so please do try and take some pictures
Here and there as I bend over the, bed railing
I know you see my slit's drippin wet and it's still not time for us to play
Since, foreplay's your way to fame
Don't act so lame baby you know the game
I wanna spread my cheeks so far so you can glide your tongue up and down my
Thong, now kneel down and pull, your drawers
Cause we're about to get down raw before you slip between my lips
Bury your face between my breasts, kiss and suck my, button knobs
Now you see them you got them nice and firm
Let's exercise our fantasy and 69 'til you bust your, cream all over me
Behind, closed doors I just want you, I need you
I need you, behind closed I want you, I need you
Got to have you, behind, closed doors

That's all you doin, you playin fuckin around
Youse a little bitch..
Youse a bitch-ass nigga, smack your fuckin skullies off
You niggas ain't learned a fuckin lesson yet?
Count your blessing yet, publicity got you mixed up
And Keith's fucked your whole million dollar aura
Clean cut or thugged out, I don't give a fuck
Niggas with that champagne shit
Fuckin with me, you'll earn a job in the cleaners
Givin motherfuckers a permanent crease
We don't do Entertainment Tonight, Rosie O'Donn-ell
Piss on niggas like you and take your video models
Straight to Church's Chicken, and fuckin McDonald's
Fuck all you glamourized faggot niggas
Y'all on some real hardcore, maggot niggas
Catch you in the gridlock in New York City traffic
Hit you in the face with a rock tied up in a fuckin sock
Tell the cops, I'll chase you with a mac-10
Follow your Range Rover with stockin caps
For seventy-eight more fuckin blocks
Watch ambulances and paramedics take off your paragon down
Remove your fuckin mop; take your body pieces
In a fucked up van to a Mexican chop shop
Fuck a bitch-ass bodyguard, bunch of niggas squealin
Cancel your important meetings, we can do this
Broad daylight, just me and you in a fuckin Jamaican restertaunt
""Who da fuck ya tink you are mon, what ya fuckin doin?
You don't know the FUCK I am"" - load three four five clips
Fuckin magazines, I'll show you the fuckin bomb
Ya bloodclot, catch you niggas in Quadrasonic or Sony
Platinum Sounds, who is it Bill?
Who's fuckin around with Crazy Tony?
All that bullshit, walkin around with - hard packs
You motherfuckers carryin backpacks
That's right, with your hooded parkas
You motherfuckers suck dick and you're phony

Y'all do y'all shit in the studio
We bring our shit to your face!

My mental is sinister, I run shit like a prime minister
You still breathin motherfucker? But now it's time to finish ya
Blood sport, I heard you on life support
But I'mma make sure that you don't take the witness stand in court
Afternoon, I'mma creep up in your room, past the goon
'fore you (??) ba-boom, and I'm sendin yo' ass to the moon
Another motherfucker bite the dust from the lust
To live plush, and he died quick - from the rush
Now I'm Southbound, fuck the 6, take the Greyhound
Any cat cross the line can't hide it's goin down
I got connects with tecs and white boats and jets
Think I'm playin motherfucker? Let me know who next
Silence and not loud, pick you off in the crowd
Now your shorty growin up in the world as a fatherless child
Everybody choose the fuckin way that they wanna play
Just remember one fuckin day that that ass gotta pay
Cause fuckin with my gravy is like rapin my little baby
And you still wouldn't be safe if you joined the fuckin navy
You must be crazy, thinkin yo' ass can get Swayze
But the only fuckin thing you gon' be doin is pushin up daisies
And it won't faze me, cause real gangsters raised me
Ghetto diamonds praised me and thugs slug just craze me
I know it sounds strange, but it's part of the game
I control bitches brains, when they suckin on my sugar cane
My fame came before money you fuckin dummy
Bitches callin me 'Bumpy' while my dick is in they tummy
But if you cross the line, you won't be able to find
They motherfuckin head, they limbs or they spine
So all you bitch motherfuckers better respect mine
If you plan on bein here to see the fuckin sunshine

A Black Kid Who Think He’s White,The Personal Album,UnKnown,"Oh~! No
Kooooooooooooooooool, Keith
The Personal Album
Been there, before where you're tryin to go
You're not the main attraction, why you actin like the show?
First let's start with how many people you know
You need juice to rock, boost to rock
You still drop names occasionally, to advance off your block
How many CD's can you stock?
You'll be dissapointed with aftershock
A inner city person, that think they Woodstock
You're over the hill, over the bill
Type of pedestrian, to force the look preppie, you can't be Phil
The A Street look, don't take you up the hill

A black kid who think he's white
A black kid who think he's whiiii-iiii-iii-ite
A black kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid

Bad upbringing left you cold, accepted by few
Looking in the mirror, you don't know you
No soul wit'chu, avoiding your uncles and aunts
Stiff on the dancefloor, you're buying straight leg pants more
You connive to settle the score
Everyday is drizzle for you, rain and fog I fizzle for you
You think woman adore you, many don't hear you
A lot ignore you, a baby with a pacifier
You think people gotta be there for you
Mom's biggest baby, drivin that woman crazy
You're not innovative, you're lazy
I made you, you didn't make me, you underestimate me
Even with overweight wannabe millionaires you couldn't fake me


Where's the proper respect? A guy with no manners
Can't stand the soul food, rather go out Von Dutch
Don't know the real from the fake, lookin for a big shot
Will the misfits fail, I know you better you won't get the Hollywood break
The superstar birthday party, blow out a celebrity cake
Whatever you got left, is not that hot
One flight of steps, milk the cow for what it's worth
A cursed person, to your last breath
Many floss at the pubs, the effort you give is F
Go home clean up your room, straighten up your mess
Straighten up your mess


A black kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid
A black kid, who think he's white
Some kind of person who's thinkin he's white
A blaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack kid~!

I cut off their heads, separate they torso and going to port of Puerto Toro and burn they fuckin' legs
Come outside for breakfast and all the eggs

A hundred dalmatians in the pickup truck, scarlet red
Santa Clause lookalikes, lose weight and get on your sled
Under the door I feed these cats a calorie, like bread
Standback with the sawed-off and piss on they bedspread
Who wanna call paramed? Walk into Burlington Coat Factory
And my alter ego Hungry Jack with me
Fuck that bellbottoms, no pants real skinny
Deliver here in the back to Jimmy, hop in the corvet
Put a brick on the gas pedal, watch it crash into your private jet
MCs go into a cold sweat, refrigerator
These rappers throw 'em out with 
Send turkeys with stuffin' up they ass, to oppress and plan in Quebec

I saw the Grammy's, I wasn't impressed with that
A lot of stylists overdressed that
Was I wrong?  Who was the best at
Two cases on Stoli's, eight thousand for this man you owe me
I left the V.I.P. section lonely
Me, white folks, Don Juan played the back
The women chose me over guess who?  Pretty Toney
Kid I got your lady signed to Sony
Girls tell Bobby I'm the real tenderoni
New York's best verse carrier
You better scoop her, before I marry her
Award winnder without rims
Tap your dimepiece without spinners
JVC, LL soapbox with the antennas
I get hard on aspirin cups filled with Guinness
The Ernie Onassis, with masters, with Marc and Jack Jasper
Sunday clean gators on the pastor
Go 'head player, youse a wallflower
Scared to talk to her, I'ma ask her
Rep it at the casino, walk in your presence
Miami's biggest problem
Whack rappers want me out the game like Al Pacino

You used to look better than that, your black eyes got affected
The cops by your apartment neighbors hear you in the argument
You think it's you and nobody, know where your lover went
Ever since, he broke your arm
Your right rib cage, girl you're somethin else

Ten cars, meet me at the Lincoln Tunnel with stockin cops
We're gonna count to the one-oh, put butter on the bun-oh
Black killed the program director but first let him sniff some blow
See the man with the suit?
Light up the kid with the bomber jacket and Timberland boots
Comin at you like 2Pac in ""Juice"", I'ma get loose
Chorus: Kool Keith (repeat 3X)
We work nine to nine, we never sleep full time..
Diamonds, we bring violence!

Send a coffin up to Billboard with flowers in the lobby
A picture of me with Gene Griffin holdin a hand-grenade
I'ma fax you a copy - and let you know my job ain't sloppy
Extort the industry cause Nicky Barnes is gonna be
In charge of every label's distribution
My street team is gonna be eight men with loaded tecs
Ridin around with Chrysler PT cruisers from a mental institution
Whip mob style, Tone Capone AZ in charge of publicity on the phone
Crazy Joe outside to meet the mixtape DJ's with carbombs
In the parkin zone - purple Cadillac lavender two-tone
A box packed up with a chopped off human head
With a murdered pitbull with a knife in his stomach
Federal Express to your secret home
Sonny D handle the Wherehouse and Tower
Take Coconuts and Sam Goody
And hire David Berkowitz as a receptionist for more power
Extreme impact when Uniter Parcel
Bring bazookas and bombs in from Iraq
Close the George Washington Bridge when we attack
Carryin duffle bag sacks
Larry Davis is workin with a thirty-eight magnum
Big stations won't have any problem hearin the wax
(I'll play it!)  With Kingston, Jamaica
Sendin the video to HBO and Cinemax
Chorus

Look at the bottom of your car, now start it
Wire on your doorknob
That's me across the street, wearin a pinstripe suit
With a (???), with black glasses talkin to Grandmaster Flash
Lookin at your black asses

I Do What I Want,The Personal Album,UnKnown,"(Classic!) Yeah, this what I like to do on my off time
(Kool Keith~!) A lot of people, they get too complex
(Too complex) I just like to do somethin real smooth
(Real smooth) with my offtime (with my offtime)
I got like ohh, 800 tracks (800 tracks) of my own (of my own)
Forget the laws of music, I can do this
Critics look for the hard work, been done all that weird stuff
You're mad because I'm the smoothest
Read you the corny quotes on the internet
""Why you don't do a character project?""
Vintage Kool Keith, this is what I love doin
Go 'head break your neck, pay you to break a sweat
I just started this song, I ain't even finished yet
J.D. mix my vocals, we didn't get to complain a set
Down to the square, what'chu gonna do
When your corny laptop and computer, ain't there?

Yeahhh, I do what I want to, the way I want to
When I want to, I do what I want
I do what I want to, the way I want to
When I want to, when I want

Deep in your heart pop fans, I hate collaborating
The lost people analysts relax
Kool Keith, did bionic music before I rapped on jazz and fusion
And all that electronic music before
Never satisfied, jackasses you want more
You talk about clickin your mouses in your borin houses
Put your money where your mouth is
Macintosh gossip don't pay my bills
Come out your cheap-ass pockets when I lay my skills
CD duplicators, underground masturbators
New fans activate, piss on the hatersssssss


Stuck on Octagon~! Oct' is gone~! You get it?
I'm with a girl and cock is on
Go study your lab mice, get out the dark
And turn your boy talk the boys lights on
I love the mall with pretty chicks with spankin new sky blue Nikes on
Shopping bags with jeans, you guys avoid, you need to watch porn
I'm outside, indoor producers online
Never been in the streets, you barely go anywhere
Website cafe, I'm goin the other way",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-i-do-what-i-want-lyrics

Double team, tag team
Your wife want me and Jack dude, see dude, we come rude
Leave the room smellin like seafood


Towels in Bath & Beyond
My Aunt Jemimah pancake syrup is all gone
For the crushed cherry
I get off when your hotbox is super wet, trimmed and a little hairier
No resteraunts, stores are closed
Suffocate me like Nelly said take off ALL YO' CLOTHES
Under the hood mechanics I check the engine when they sit on my nose
With the leather mask, I'm professional, starin at thongs
Dark shades I see through them dresses real fast
New outfits make you dance under my strobelight and pay me cash
Girls with the Escalades, pullin out them mall applications
Conceited with the perfect ass
30 miles, the camera's ready put on your booty shorts
You need gas


Ladies in the mirror, starin at the butt it's gettin big
Trust I freak, hop in the rig
You sport the high heels with the red wig
Sexually I bet you be chargin up a dollar to holler
A dog stuck in the booty, your face mad Rudy

You know you get down with Reggie, it's our duty

Haters,Spankmaster,2001.0,"Two-thousand-three baby, Kool Keith, I'm up in here
Very different - and he wants to talk to you
Admire his immaturity
Took you away to better places
Brazil, Costa Rica you seen new faces
Covered the bills you struggled to pay - gave you life
No more kid with a scarf around his beatin you up every day
Plastic surgery breast implants the small hustler made you cry
Because he was confused, you lay while he play
Cleanin my house, you look gorgeous in lingerie
Is that the kid on the phone? Hardcore
Hawkin you in front of the building everyday
When is he gonna learn? It's over, it's my turn
You're pregnant with my kid
By the fireplace, we watch his doo-rags burn
I remodeled you, gave you the diamonds he couldn't wisely concern
Always talkin bout the cash he got
The little pesos for shows
And God knows his materialistic raps and wack flows
Are like Stay Free pads, fake V.I.P. rappers get garbage disposed
Unrecouped for his flamboyance and reflection
He's leasin rentin and frontin - yeah, yeah..
Haters come around from downtown
I get surround sound - I get big!
Haters come around from downtown
I get surround sound - I get big!
Haters come around from downtown
I get surround sound - I get big!
Stop the chorus back to your Bentley
Your wife is gone, she's with me
On a first class flight in the Bahamas, grab your bags quickly
Sorry top ten rapper on the answering machine
You're over like Al Green
This song is written for the 2003 team
V.I.P. with Ben Vareen
Cancel your A&R meeting light you up like Heatwave - central heating
Eject your premature CD in the whirlpool while we're eating
Shut down all material, new tracks fall on your head like a crane
All you offered to women is sound of weak drums
Fill they hearts with pain
I'm in your dungaree jacket like a bleach stain
Girls cry on my arm, he was cheap and silly don't complain
He's a nerd with a hardcore twist, playin with racing cars
We look out the window and count the rain on the window pane
(Count the rain on the window pane)
Haters come around from downtown
I get surround sound - I get big!
Haters come around from downtown
I get surround sound - I get big!
Haters come around from downtown
I get surround sound - I get big!
Haters come around from downtown
I get surround sound - I get big!
Here's a tissue for the tears
He gave you hard times over hard rhymes for years
Shattered your career
Like an uncomfortable thong twisted in your rear
He was eight years behind, I was already advanced, I've been here
Denim suits with alligators
Your man sports black all the time with no flavors
From castle to castle, hassle to hassle
House to house, man to mouse (man to mouse)
Haters come around from downtown
I get surround sound - I get big!
Haters come around from downtown
I get surround sound - I get big!

Big Lou and company
Macks, Peterbilts, GMC's, white freight liners
Volvos, Marlins, Internationals
Eighteen wheels, we do deals
Major fake baller close your mouth, you rap about the same thing
Record company got you gassed
Now you wanna hold champagne and bounce
And act like you from Down South
I ""Pimp Hard"" like MJG and Eightball
Called the crib that my girl Kate called
Olde English aluminum can tall
Girls smile when I walk with alligators through the mall
Shiny jeans and baseball cap, no time for rotation crap
No sleep, always up with heat, never take no N-A-P
I.P.P. - International Player
Wherever you search there's no one greater
But you look at the back of the club walkin around
I see you, that's you, a HATER!

Macks, trucks, big wheels roll
Macks, trucks, big wheels roll
Macks, trucks, big wheels roll
Global W.V.C. who can step to me
Got the belt over my head like Ernie Shavers
Y'all be talkin behind my back, rhyme as sweet as Life Savers
From New York, push records out from Detroit
Greyhound bus will get me to the point
From there, I don't care, pick me up in a pickup truck
I roll wagons fly like blue shoes with big Chuck
Thinkin I gives a fizzucka
Youse a metropolitan plastic-ass, youse a sucka!
Turn let me blast you in the face
A guy like you I should slash in the face
Pick up the lampshade, knock your blunt out your hand
Smear ash in your face!

Bow to the Masta,MTV Celebrity Deathmatch,UnKnown,"That's right y'all, the K double-O L, K-E-I-T-H (South Bronx)
I'm in here, I'm a let you know (I started rappin')
I can tell you can't rap, look at your engineer:
A Japanese guy with glasses on with straight leg jeans and a beard
Got you on Hit Factory with four groupies with acne
Thinking you recording a masterpiece, chewing peanuts in your session
I'm a learn you a lesson: all y'all can't write
You just a new group with an ordinary gimmick and radio and poster hype
Now that 3,000 people lost their jobs, I'mma see how your record do
But you're stuttering out your boo boo, can't give a decent interview
I was always wondering about you
Your whole group evolving different images around me
Acting like they don't copy me when they see me
You've spent your whole life listening to ""
Critical Beatdown
""
You's a secret fan; every time I create an A.K.A. character
Most of you groups out there are so wack, looking at my shoes in my videos
The back of my album cover, and stealing my marketing plan
Like you inventing something new to the company
And in reality you're clones of me
(Y'all can't wait for my album to come out to steal something new)
You should bow to the master!
(Worship me, worship me, worship me, worship me) (Repeat 4x)
I pity the untalented, half of y'all creativity is to steal duplicate
The clothes I wear, call your promotional staff to get you out
Quick in the magazines to perpetrate me on your Ampex reels
On tour most MC's draw sketches of me and watch what I'm wearing
I found out why rappers look at me jealous and keep staring
Comparing me to themselves from a distance when I walk offstage
Your record label, your group, and your fanbase giving me a standing ovation
In the Chicago Bull warmup suit and a bald head like Michael Jordan
Six-time championship of the league, four million groups in the industry
Rakim and Canibus is the only ones rapping pro speed
I average 52 rappers per game, I put you to shame
Now you gonna sit in your used Expedition and act like you don't know my name
I don't have to battle anybody nor freestyle
Half of your flows are written by rookies working Montreal Expos
I don't care if you act wild, bring your raps to the studio
I'mma get in your booty, yo
I'mma set up a bag of dust on the console
So you can do this, light up, and smoke, yo, cause I'm no joke yo
I might ride on the cycle level 3, vomit when you go in the booth
Your product manager is going to say, ""Yo who is he?""
(Yo who is that, man?)
You should bow to the master!
(Worship me, worship me, worship me, worship me) (Repeat 2x)
I don't play with skinny legs and the water head
Time after time you don't know what I'm thinking when I come
Into your studio professional with a white man driving a Continental Lincoln
Groupies look at me, y'all don't pay me no mind
I'm about to tear a new ass in this kid, he'd better not let me rhyme
Yeah, take a break, order some blunts
I'm about to get up all in your fronts
With your body shaped like Mitch Green and Tony Tubbs, you don't want this
Go in the corner with your stomach hanging, gold teeth looking sneaky
I'm a let you know how be, G
No matter how much your Cazals cost you can't see me
Believe that, light up your ass souped up
Stand behind your backup, with your acne-faced girlfriend
You're gonna get a lot of feedback
Test the best, you're gonna have water on your kneecap
You should bow to the master!
(Worship me, worship me, worship me, worship me) (Repeat 2x)
Yeah, I'm sorry Blaze Magazine, I'm first
The other 49 rappers are behind me, what?!",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-bow-to-the-masta-lyrics

Keith!  In the house

It ain't about the bitch with a wig like she comin from China
Y'all fronted in rented Benzes with Avis on 'em
No breakfast, I'm goin home, fuck Chelsea or diner
Let the guys with the chrome buckets expose the cuffs, be a co-signer
I'm in your ass man, close like your Starter jacket liner
Dr. J sharper, plug your asshole up with a tub stopper
Your wife's a New York City Breaker
Your baby's mom is a pop-locker, know the metropolitan area
Custodian nigga, you sanitation worker shit cleaner
Floor mopper, look down on the city with binoculars
Piss out at choppers
Defecate 80 thousand feet in the air
I flip your small game, take your small urban territory
Put the street in the air
My shit rise, increase like subway fare
Scuffle your denim wear
Your sneaker line ain't makin it, I piss on four pair
You know the big-head boy from the projects, retarded motherfucker
You know you be in child care, you better stay there
Your crew get picked up with shitty diapers from daycare
Your phobia his crib death
The top rappers receive hot dogs up they ass, they get F
Mark flush the toilet, you shit next
Expand your stomach range with tummy pains
Shit in the back of your Bentley when it rains
Leave your wooden panels with shit stains
Throw the turds out the windows
Watch them bounce in the carpool lanes
Hot 97

The shit expand, over your Jacob the diamond watch
The penis is loose, we piss in your hand

Yo... yo where's the block at?  Uhh
They say 106th & Park is on, I'm mad, fuck it it's on
I haven't heard a hard record in years, uhh
Everybody dancin, Harlem Shakin, strip Free naked
And put a pole up, and watch the ratings go up
And if AJ steps, take his Jacob and slap off the makeup
I'm in the crowd like Lee Malvo, with a sniper rifle
A hockey mask, a butcher knife
Yo who knows what I'll do
They sellin dreams with a rap battle - uh-huh
Look - yeah - you rappers are kids, and rappin with a rap rattle
... nobody ever comes out - that's right
No twelve inches, no fires, no jets
Early retired, no links
No chains, no videos, no baguettes - uhh
""Don't Speak,"" uh-huh - I'm gettin Gwen Stefani
She's tossed up, sellin pussy like every week
So don't fight me - uhh, you can hype me - that's right
I'm liable to go out with a terrorist style
I'm liable to flow out with a terrible style
Viacom bought you (suckers)
I'm outta here nigga I'm changin the dial

Hot 97


No more cars and shit, we suicide bombers
Nigga, walk up in your radio station
We get gas from the gas station nigga
You better ask public relations, blow out your DJ booth
With hats off, like motherfuckin Dr. Seuss
No buckets, strictly bombs under the North Face goose
Caught you with acid baby
We put it in your motherfuckin orange juice
Fuck a turned up cap
How bout a burnt up motherfuckin baseball cap
With a whack-ass rap
We detonate with three sticks of dynamite through your turntables
Blow out your ass crack
You ain't the motherfuckin pimp, you ain't the motherfuckin mack
We do this right, you gon' drink a daquiri
Are you gon' come back at me
Are you gon' get smacked from me
Fuck around look how you act to me... bitch... Hot 97",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-shit-expands-lyrics

That cellular phone ain't workin
What's that?  Pre-paid, from J&J
And your voice mail is off, cause I called you
So you're extravagant, think you all that
There's some corn flakes in the kitchen
And turkey sandwich on top of the 'fridgerator
That's right girl, don't roll your eyes at me like a alligator
Put your Chanel shades on, walk with your thong in your butt
Runnin your fingers through your cheap raise(?)
Look at your girlfriend with her hair weave fallin out
On my phone, runnin up my bill
Talkin to broke-ass drug dealer friends
To Western Union you three dollars from Cancun
You're now in the red with your real hair stickin from under your wig
Showin behind your head, with real, pimples on your face
You can't disrespect me in my place; them cigarettes smell
Lookin for NBA players to take you to eat and you don't even have gas
Actin pretty you need to pull over in Taco Bell
I seen your kind before with mice spittin
Pumpkin seeds in your living room floor
I know your type.. I know your type
Maxin in the shade - I know your type
Maxin in the shade - I know your type
Maxin in the shade - I know your type
You can't even cook a hot dog or pour a glass of milk
You'd rather walk around with plastic coats over your head
In the rain lookin for a coach bag and Moschino belt
You need to see how McDonald's feel
Stop lookin around like you ""Superfly"" and Ron O'Neal
I'ma let you know how beef and a quarter pound is real
Now go get your autograph and take a picture with the Cheeseburglar
Let him know how you got your hair done
And you're movin like you're pregnant this month
With your +Belly+ stickin out like movie and soundtrack
You dress up with diamonds just to eat
Don't even finish your plate complete
When the bill come, you try to act like you can't see the receipt
Walkin up the block with Vivica Fox type girlfriends
Jockin a seventy-year-old man, in a mansion
With a seventy-five Rolls Royce, that look like Alfred Hitchcock
Maybe he can afford your liposuction stretch marks and tax deduction
The second verse is still introduction
So you actin like a sad puppy
Lookin at me through the fish tanks like a guppy
(Why you have to look at me so stupid like that?)
Maxin in the shade - I know your type
Maxin in the shade - I know your type
Maxin in the shade - I know your type
First of all I bought the food you didn't even say thank you
Now put on your bibs and chew your ribs
You got grease on your hand and your favorite skirt
I'ma call your mom after you get off work so your head hurt
You wasn't invited to the concert that's V.I.P. backstage
Who's this? What you doin here?
I'm ashamed of you, I'm bein straight
I hate you, I'm not gonna face you
I'ma take you to White Castle asshole
I don't wear platinum, I wear gold
My maturity ability is laughin at you like comedy
You need to sit down, pull out a Swanson TV dinner
Peanut butter and jelly'll fill up your belly
Bread in the cabinet start grabbin it
Kool-Aid and lemonade get comfortable under the shade
And let the barbershop, give your bob wig a tight fade
Maxin in the shade - I know your type
Maxin in the shade - I know your type
Maxin in the shade - I know your type
Maxin in the shade

Drink cases in the corner by myself, vomit a lil' bit and crack the bottles

With white dogs in the backseat, the dogs feel the back heat
Whitewall tires slide on all 360's in the street

Shootin porn movies at the Greek, chicks called Candy compete

Be a few years 'fore I'm bustin that steel
From New York to the Down South
In the Midwest I'm what they they talkin about
The whole country ring, did you hear his name
But I ride the track, like a subway train
I'm on the grind, 365
Hard on 'em, but I gotta survive
I'm a soldier, on the frontlines
AK with a 45 down to ride


Border patrol...
Breakin hoes, fresh clothes, pocket makin paper rolls
This is what I do, that's the life, that a player chose
Nice whips equal thick hips, so I'm flippin chips
Tired of bricks, that's why I'm in the studio, lettin it rip
I'm the truth, this is proof, vibin on a different loop
Grab a pen, let it loose, 'til labels give me recoup
All we need, City of a God when it come to rap
It's a wrap, that's a fact, look at where I started at
I'm all in, makin bread, dodgin feds, gettin head
From the baddest chick, that's that shit, check what Petey said
He the man, what a plan, soon they'll all understand

Release your best lyrics, let me see you stick and stack
Throughout the cookie crew, you can't drop a verse that's good
You ain't better than Frick and Frack
You could stand around and watch the bomb go off
Your backpacks down to your buttcrack
The sharp needle attack the feeble
Have you in total shock, starin at the wrapped up material
Like Indian people, lookin like chicks with uneven suntans
Walkin off the beach in Rio

Women love the vocals, they can't see me, treat me like Theo
Redbones, come spanish, dark-skinned and creole
Every summer Libra she's Le-ohhhhhhh

I drop the gift, my urine hit your LeCroix shirt
Bounce off your standard Smiths
Serena serve you Chester mints
You goin in the vocal booth is high risk
To record butter soft words on a light disc
Bad foul shot shooter you gonna turn back to the team and scream ""I MISSED~!""
With form like Dwayne Wade, I still put you down
With five of your best men (hehehehehe)


Yeah! Takin a risk
Everybody shoulda warned you carefully about the Temple of Piss
The best box to chose when you chessbox
I don't care if you baseball cap, buttoned down suits with dress socks
Ten thousand pound throw electric bodyguards
Though I roll with a crew, that breast oxes
The talk, the vanishing like the soul food
Front your powers fresh down, come down
I come back and rush down
You can move with the Henny a lot and get silly and bring thus down
Gain confidence from somewhere and put they only hope and trust down
I say go 'head prove to me, you must CLOWN~!
Make your first mistake, missin a pop fly
Right around your antenna now you got Popeye
Lock eye, your girl got cock-eye!!",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-im-libra-lyrics

Back Stage Passes,Matthew,2000.0,"	Don't I know you?
	Do you?
	Well ahh.. I'm Laurie Kessler, haven't we met before?
	Have we?
	Maybe not

Back stage! ..
See girl after the show I'm not to be idolized
Overwhelmed by a new obsessed fan
No I don't wanna answer your questions
Are you some kind of journalist, follow me around?
Come on in the bathroom
Now you wanna see how Keith acts at home
Call your girlfriends
Now you wanna see the way I P-I-S-S
Beggin me to get a magic marker to sign my name on your back
You're very young, and giggly with pre-washed Levi's on
You don't know how to act - let's party, how about it?
I don't wanna party drink Bacardi what you think I look like;
The purple dragon Barney?

Back stage!  You're excited..  back stage passes!
You're excited, girls lookin all around
Back stage!  You're excited..  back stage passes!
You're excited, stop lookin all around
Back stage!  You're excited..

I'm totally attracted to you, but you turn me off as a fan
Approachin me back stage with a guy that's not your friend
Lyin to get a laminate - is that your man?
Some weird guy starin at me like Peter Pan
There's no time to talk about how I got started in rap
I'm goin straight home
You don't know, I'ma leave you alone
Why should I waste my time, get no sleep?
I just got off stage, you're still complainin
You shoulda stayed on stage longer at the New Orleans Superdome
What you want from me?  You took my picture;
You got my autograph - I'm not tryin to crack any more Coronas
I hate the smell of beadies
And you have a bunch of dinky friends, and a adolescent staff
You are immature

Back stage!  You're excited..  back stage passes!
You're excited, girls lookin all around
Back stage!  You're excited..

Laugh at yourself, put your whole world on the shelf
Do that stupid stuff with Weird Al Yankovich
Go try to figure out somebody else
First of all, you're living through my CD
Second you don't know me
Base your life on fan magazines I go shoppin everyday
When I'm in a small boring city you don't see me
If I told you I had eighteen hands
You're so tuned and tweaked out, your ass would believe me

Back stage passes!
You're excited, girls lookin all around
Back stage!  You're excited..  back stage passes!
You're excited, girls lookin all around
Back stage!  You're excited..",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-back-stage-passes-lyrics

I trust talent, whattup Flex, JoJo and K-Ci put me on next
Eighteen times let my record play like Dr. Dre and Jay-Z
All man headline like Beenie Man; work it out this time - don't bother
Make hits like ""Planet Rock"" Bambataa
Dance floor stiff beat break your jaw
I cancelled the Limp Bizkit tour
Let your braids and afro grow more
One year I hear about you, next year I don't hear about you no more
Got people in Oakland, Bronx Lebanon to Fillmore
Carry updated trunk funk
That stuff you program is for punks

Jealous cats like you should jump ship
Right from my left nut like a vice grip
Cognac take a sip you look burnt out
I don't like the two-way pager stickin out my hip
No time for voicemail
I bring heat in the city on Amtrak and monorail
Why you makin tracks like L.A. Reid and Babyface?
How that gin and tonic taste?
Korg adapter, Yamaha in the suitcase
Just dance, don't look and nobody two-faced
Brown man, all head like 2Pac
Cadillac frost blue, yellow convertible rag top
Girls enter the club with Lonnie Rich
Chevrolet Impala green SS on dubs
Don't front on me one bit I pull ladies out of fly cars with love

Eatin, big smoke comin out of my Ampex reels
Sit in the back of your Escalade, tell me how my bass feels
From Big Nixons down to the beta
George in New Orleans rattle your dashboards
Bounce strippers around sounds echo from New York to Decatur
Exhaust pipes, white kid drivin a limo I'll see you later
Leather boots or gator

Mysterious hydraulic overdrip Mars administer
General of the East, flyin over the wicked witch
Beyond alien height
I see through your planet with space light
Green men on the left, and one makin a right
Investigation under the curricular
The entire existance, my directing aim is particular
Buy dark forces, the United States army's best
Commanders, all private first class
The UFO's fight the probes, with silver and gold uniforms
Protected under government sources
Of course it's, for horses

Highway abduction
Red lights at the intersection
Aliens trading machines for diesel engines

Deserted, dishin in control, my formula's compact
Attack you on 72nd street, with X-ray vision
With geometrical arrangement
Dinosaur fossils that burn like gas on the pavement
Chapter X-V, invisible orchestrator
In the solar system, you can't see me
Photograph of the Earth look like a baseball
With samples of feces
From the Loch-Ness monster, but nobody believe me
The CIA circuit breakers, business suits, arrangements
Astronauts work the button get off at Mars control
The mission station from the elevator
Explain pipes through the ceiling
Lime-green metallic faces and spaceships with carburators

Economy relationships, with 18 ships

With giant networks controllin future releases
Compatible to rolled, the moon will still turn cold
With rocks, and minerals, 800 million years old

Un-circumcised with no rain coat
With no underwear, prepare for the Phantom
With yo big eyes ha huh ha huh, yeah
As I lyrical flip my body never wear underwear
Girls stare, I pluck in they public hair
The masquerade I'm crazy with a switch blade
I cut jaws the face of a wild shark
I love Cal Can, ""Roof!"", can a dog bark
I'll bite ya girl make a women catch rabies
Then eat Gerber from a jar like the babies
I like cereal, yo you Captin' Crunch
Juggle my jellybeans, yo captain munch
I like roach spray mixed in my gin and juice
You better go get spray and make it strong
My tractor trailer, my private piece is quite long
I look around the corner and see your big eyes
I look around the corner and see your big eyes
I look around the corner and see your big eyes
I look around the corner and see your big eyes
I look around the corner and see your big eyes
As I masturbate every time about 8
The last time I masturbated through the earthquake
I saw your picture girl Shirley Temple Jheri Curl
You walk around through a toilet and a do do world
I know the spokes are white a green Cadillac
Polka dot grey I'm satisfied I won't take it back
I need the mustard from the Whataburger
I spell it backwards I take my girl to King Burger
You better rush on in an order fries
Before I get mad and start peein' in your eyes
Like Gomer Pile, surprise, surprise
You seen my drawers of course you see my rubber
No fat stretch marks I ain't the one you got the blubber
""What the hell am doin', I telling you that?""

I look around the corner and see your big eyes
I look around the corner and see your big eyes
I look around the corner and see your big eyes
I look around the corner and see your big eyes
Missile check I'm aimin' four to your rectum
With mexican beans collard greens I respect 'em
You hold the apples while girls pull they pants down
I got a bottles of flies I'm throwin' ants down
Like Joe said one time I'm drinkin' straight rum
Chewin' they embryo, actin' like it's bubble gum
I get inside, bark and crank the truck
Cruz up the highway, you out there you stuck
You ain't the one I got no cables no goose
Look in the back I got no room, see my moose
I better hide what's left at 7 Eleven
Call the Ranger, the Phantom at 11
He got black boots and stains on my turtle-neck
My mink is yellow and tan female birds peck
I got no rags to clean I love the vomit
It makes me sexy, my underwear atomic
You smell the rose, I'm smellin' cookin' flower
I call your house and let it ring for an hour
I got to clean up my house set the mouse traps
I know one he's grey and cool and the mouse raps
I seen 'em seen 'em I seen 'em through peripheral vision

I'm that busy Globetrotter, watch you turds skitty-scatter
Do one titty matter? Your girl's an overweight mammal
I work up court, y'all can D up on my handle
I pee on your spot, take your startin slot
Slam my cock in your jaw 'til your bracelets and arms rot
I will jerk off if her booty stink, cause my palm is hot
The crowd watch me jump up and touch the 24 second clock
You ain't no threat, youse a lucky come-up
With a histerectomy from the second block
Your wife smokin lookin for a second rock
Nuts filled up to the top, you remember choc'
Across the street from Donut King, maneuver with donut swing

Man you better leave basketball alone and take your panties home
Man you better leave basketball alone and take your panties home
Ask Paul Silas, the coach of Anthony and Jerome
My pee stick to the floor I will block your baseline
Your inbound lay-up no matter how much coke you put up your ass
Even with a bunch of kids around you behind you you still can't stay up
Come on faggot, take out your Tampax and crush your heart bra
And set a new play up; man to man defense
You move in a female sequence
The type that's comin out of your jeans to make cameltoes
Or throw up prints, I'm too dominatin
Down low I kick the dirtiest things on hot rinse
Make sure your buttcrack deal with the nail and hammer penetration
I leave you backed up with rap constipation
Everybody SCARED to move they bowels
Get Haterade and I do suggest you use your towels
Man you better leave basketball alone, and take your panties home
Man you better leave basketball alone
And go home and take your panties home

I'll be at the All-Star practice with turds on top of your chick's mattress
Full speed, doo-doo mode~!
Y'all ain't the big dogs, full stretched out
You right and curly walkin around in poodle mode
Tractor trailer back up y'all pick up a giant, DOO-DOO LOAD
Truck stop Flying J-er
Season tickets man you can't sit next to me the Mayor
You gas abuser, you need a PT Cruiser
Dance around the keyboards like the great Bob Moog-ah

When do you grow, when do you know, action, test 'em
Move faster, you just met the best of
You can't come for lester{?}, penalty getter, innovator
Over cat litter chicken liver you know I spent {?} days better

The abominator, the orchestrators, the verse dominators

(Heavy grit on your turntables)

Rap gotta upgrade, get better, more clever
It's talented now never, I heard the worst ever
Man with the personal music vendetta
What's old to me, is new to you
I got a cue for you, the writing exercise I do for you
Can't help to explain, critics on the side
Your favorite talker I don't sweat, everybody's gonna complain
If the publications don't, who will?
I never paid to see Wild Bill
I'm tired of R&B changed to fill


Not impressed, with what's out there
Your big hat was smothered, all that
Promotion don't reach me
Basically what you got, I don't care
Your scalp is dry
Everybody need Arrid Extra, under the arms
To scope with Sterling, flashin off your charms
Relaxed by the nature pills, I'm on two calms
Sleep with the Calvin Klein silk pajam's
Behind my pillow, Bath & Body Works coconut lime
Gettin rubbed on my arms - y'all +Ring the Alarms+

I’m A Tell-U,Spankmaster,2001.0,"People!  You're stuck in nineteen seventy-four
Witcha boring producers
Your videos are boring, same girls singin
Everybody tryin to be George Clinto and Jimi Hendrix wannabes
I'm beyong that average cha cha, that trendy Southside music
People don't hate, just motivate
You spent twenty years rappin about diamonds and Dom P
Moet and bubbly, while you front your wife and girlfriend hug me
Studio gangsters lamp at Fort Lee
With transexuals tryin to hide in secret spots in New Jersey
Cats pose in leased double-R's with two-way pagers
Frontin like you like women I seen you on your Motorola
Typin the best places to meet up with Richard Simmons and Jack Lemmon
When you in Cali you hide in the Valley
Rentin the Sheraton suites
Callin young boys that look like Johnny Versace
To meet you at Miami Beach
You wear black all the time, you look wack all the time
Got the nerve to try to pose with a girl, then spit a hard rhyme
Like you run the streets with thugs
And move with brothers who do mad crime
I'm a tell you how I feel
I'm a tell you how I feel
I'm a tell you how I feel
I'm a tell you how I feel
Take you out simple add a dim effect to your spotlight
You think you hot right
Surround the tables got you kissin your bodyguards, holdin Cris'
The last time I heard a guy called you a dude
With a FUBU jacket said ""excuse you miss""
With his hair like Lil' Kim, contact lenses
Dapper Dan gear with ice on his wrist
Your hype man walk with a twist
Just like the girls, you want a man that's rich
You want a guy to say come here BIZZITCH
Yo, you like the way celebrities fondle you and touch
You wanna look onstage and stare at the crotch
I know a type of guy like you that try like you
Wear lipstick and cry like you
I'm a tell you how I feel
I'm a tell you how I feel
I'm a tell you how I feel
I'm a tell you how I feel
Trendy guy like you with your man watchin Hendrix
Look at the way your corny album was mixed
That feminine stuff y'all put out was marketing tricks
Clones with costumes step out of my dressin room
Duplicators break down the reel
Your DJ funny style that makes it a trio
I don't care if you got a budget and per diem
I saw you jockin Marilyn Manson in the Niko
Your sound is outdated you network with a lot of people
I'm a tell you how I feel
I'm a tell you how I feel

And lookin for a fuckin squirt-off for the night
Just like them niggas be up at Suzy Rendezvous, fuckin around
Pullin they dick out, thinkin they can get they shit licked
Got a bunch of motherfuckers sittin around a motherfuckin table
Claimin they know who the best

When yo' ass is sittin in the motherfuckin, BlueTube motherfucker
Tryin to smile up in all niggas faces
When we walk around you, smilin
You don't even go to motherfuckin Timbuktu
And talk to those niggas up in the hills
When shit was goin down, and you be sittin around a fuckin panel
With all these motherfuckin fat obesity motherfuckers

Tryin to judge motherfuckers with these plaques
Y'all niggas need to step the fuck back
Cause y'all niggas is way whack

The way I gave you the world
Send you to learn about the moments, on a thousand vacations
Wit'chu sick in the hospital, I bought you the flowers
They were black ivory, they made you cry with heavy emotions
Your back and night was rubbed down professional
With sweet cucumber lotion, with all my time and devotion
You cried about the bills your ex-man had left you with
Throwin rocks into the ocean
I heard your whispers all the way to my ear, on a foggy night
You walkin with one of your Pomeranians, 3 Dog Nights
With pits comin you was in shock
I couldn't let 3 dogs fight (I couldn't let 3 dogs fight)

Waitin in the emergency room for your mild concussions
You knew your heart always and forever
Through the heatwave, your body was rushin
You had to get to your own apartment, you didn't want to say with your cousin
Your mom always fussin, takin a train from the Grand Central Station
When I was on stage, nothin could stop you from faintin
Grabbin my hand on the spot, you was scared under the shy lights
With apple bottoms on, jeans fittin tight
Beggin me to put on your direct light, in love like a sex slave
Sippin red Alize under the purple light, sexual intruder

Tuxedo sometimes, your bodyguard's organized

Girl I feel the way you love me, hold me at night and hug me
You got the phone from my pocket to beep me and bug me
Forget the do rag, I ain't no thug, gee, I'm more bugged gee
Sleep in the bathtub, get rid of the waterbed
Move your thongs out to the side
Forget the the room, hotel lobby, I bone on the rug, gee
Reset the tripod, filming women like Rocco
Putting their hands between their legs, with ecstasy
I feed the girls like cats, Purina to go
Here's your bowl, they always jump out the shower
Doggystyle on the couch, with their heads shedding on my pants
Rubbing next to me, you pay me, I'll pull out a ??? gee
You changed up on me, now you gotta pee

Freaks get naked, freaks get naked
Freaks get naked baby, freaks get naked baby

Trojans in the green pack, you lay on the kitchen table
And lean back, fruit cocktail and pancakes syrup
Flow down your butt crack, ice-cream around your pelvis
You're a star, baby, buy a ticket from New York
You wanna meet guys like me, directors in Hollywood, you wanna sell this
Win awards in Vegas, slide your g-strings off
You're wit' the top film makers, mid-town traffic
I'm meeting with Black Tail, you're talking to fakers
I own a factory, my workers are thong makers
Black woman with Carribean shakers
I've been doin this since Time Square Arcades had Space Invaders
Removing your panties off slow on Penn Station escalators
I love lesbians, they're not haters
Hunny, you graduated to booty shorts
Hands around the missal, you made it to the majors
Pick a condom, cherry, strawberry, blue-berry
I got all flavors (I got all the flavors...)

Freaks get naked, freaks get naked
Freaks get naked baby, freaks get naked baby

You make the appetizers, I'ma re-connect the DVDs
The television is clear, Ghetto Booty in progress
Adjust the atennas, hunny, no need for cable
I fix the triple X wires, don't lie if you're on your time of the month
You don't have to rush, cause internal problems can hold
I don't want the room to smell like car tires, I'm sipping Stolichnayas
Butterscotch, soaking your g-spot area from Breyer's
Don't fool yourself with the toys under your bed  - you're deniers
No time to hurt you, they're looking for screamers, I'm looking for cryers
Admire your bed sheet you're on
Careful planning, the one I need to teach you on
No regular movie, I rather watch porn

Oh, my name is Kool Keith (yeah)
Anyway, be careful
You know, people don't care about you here
Everything’s kind of phony and plastic
Gimme a call
Don't think twice...

I taught pretty girls the ropes
I gave them money
When they was hungry
When they were starving
I put 'em on a spot
And dressed ’em up real hot
I was their father watchin' cops on that sunset block
Right in Denny's, I caught 'em cryin', countin' pennies
Straight off the Greyhound, you need a place to lay down?
Don't worry 'bout me
Back home, how mommy be?
We on our way, each girl today makes a G
We pay them full, the top queens stick with me
I’m out there cold, blank from the black hole
I keep scopin’ 'em, national recruitin’ 'em
Brothers get cheap, I still throw bags of loot to them

You ran away from home
To be a big star

You ran away from home
To be a big star

You ran away from home

Rings in the Cadillac
Teach my little girls, babies, show them how to act
I hit the Vegas scene with models from a magazine
Everybody tested, no HIV, the staple’s clean
Movin' well, my pockets grow and comes swell
We're on our way, the Beverly Centre shoppin' everyday
Platinum blondes and black girls I took from conds
LA Express, advertisin' shapes, all sizes
My Macquarie, immaculate, pumpin' every year
Sharp with shoes,  dance royal blues
Suits from Paris by the  De Marris
I gets mine, my best girl is a dollar sign
No harsh beatings and whippins, just mental power
I close the doors and do my preachin' for an hour
You out there, I'm still here. Who bought your new hair?

My game is too large, with stacks payin' off the feds
I'm overridin' that boyfriend, fake married game
You out here hungry, no place to stay, what's your name?
My rent is so high like eyebrows above your eye
Applications are there, and girls do apply
Don't cry, you need a place to go beddie-bye?
I'll take you there, by you clothes everywhere
Fix your weave, beauty parlors give you new hair
Braids and action with new style like Janet Jackson
You be smilin' with cheeks out, showin' satisfaction
Upscale limits, with foxes on the front scrimmage
LAPD under tables, wanna work with me
From New York City, the operation's lookin' pretty
Run with models from Italy, just hit the lotto

Game benefits, collect C-I-S-S on you
Don't need one mic there, I'd rather vomit on two
People suck! Are you down? I'm in your area
You bad, the more the merrier
Santa Claus, put flammable fluid to your claws
I break all sissy laws
Treat you like a prosti' on Sunset, you bet
I know you're in the back of the aisle, your girdle's wet
You got the nerve to move and listen to Keitho Sweat
Look around yo
You're like the girl who used to sing a long time in Florida
I call you Anquette",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-everybody-playin-here-lyrics

Can I touch ya butt girl?  Can I squeeze ya butt girl?
Can I feel ya butt girl?  Can I touch it?
Can I touch ya butt girl?  Can I squeeze ya butt girl?
Can I feel ya butt girl?

Honey with the gloss white diamonds, frosty lips
Movin with hypnotic sips
Movin the packer, I'm in the ride, leanin to the side
Turnin up the Bar-Kays
Firecracker, the parking lot macker
Maxi, Stacy, women sport the Stay Free
Like Prince all the panties hit the floor in one room in Paisley
With Naughty By Nature, stippin Stoli
Peach on the rocks with Vinnie, Treach and KayGee
Volume up, the club is open, nothin closin at 3
V.I.P. comes reserved, with Ronnie B
Are you blind out there, can Ronnie see?
The power of the Miramax picture
Hold up girl, wait a minute, players don't rush
Hold the cards, please, I'ma get wit'cha
Ladies ready for departure, show ID let me card ya
I see the T-backs through your slacks
I like it jiggly a little larger


In the club I enter the room
In the ladies room where the flows {?} soon
Heartbeats cold sweats, game and jets
Let's 5000, let's jet
No hon, I just came, I ain't done
She owes me cash, she paid up one
Next chick, nitpick, dip necks
Lick we jacko man took his shit
We in the club, you slip we serve
Back in the club gettin clipped nuttin heard
Two-steppin, game lethal weapon
Chicks I'm checkin every second
Blood hit slide as you outsiders want what {?}
No outsiders, we all riders
We party hard, doin the club
Gettin no love from sharin the bub


Yo what'chu gonna do now (what?)
It's all messed up now (tell 'em)
The club rushed up, crunked up now
Chickens all fucked up on Bacardi now
The spot blown up, yo they wanna go nuts
It can go now, yeah
We out of control, we out of your mold
We broke it, 10 years ago (10 years)
We start to roll, I can go 50/50 (ooh)

You out of your reach, we comin now it's the beast (peace)

Change Your World,The Personal Album,UnKnown,"Baby this is Keith, but not SWEAT
I wanna tell you how I feel about you
How I rub my fingers through your pretty hair
Tell you how I really feel
You're so lovely to me
I'd do anything in this world for you
You're pretty baby

Baby you impress me, but they don't know how I feel
Step up if you will, I'ma change your world

Just because you got The Personal Album don't mean you have The Secret Album
No less The Private Album, the four albums recorded
Plus the 11 tracks of seclusion
It's dimensional, my songs keep a distance
Even if you absorb everything, I don't wanna add to your confusion
Everything I do outside of me is an off-branch
I love classy wine, white collar shirts with cufflinks
I'm obsessed with fly slacks and pants
Go out to discotechs and watch ladies dance
King crab legs, with old bay season
My salad dressing with blue cheese mixed with ranch


You thought I would be a cartoon character
I'm in reverse mode, you and your girlfriend do a show for me
Let me laugh at ya
Can't handle my man life, the way I demand life
Me and you will always stay six albums apart
It's been that way since I wrote what you thought was yours personal
I meant that you can't think of what I listen to private
Write five albums a month, when you close your eyelids
Put the vocals out for high bids
Pump your tweeters and your mids
Can you imagine who's real? A genius, can you guess everything I did?
Everything I put lyrics on now have to be big
Whether you like it or not, you can't fight what I got
Collect this, I don't care, stay recordin like 2Pac
Record stash, you never heard them, come and tell me what's hot

Coming from Rocky Mount
Spaulding basketballs come out the sky
Which they bounce
The extra thought that count
That come from Rocky Mount
Spaulding basketballs come out the sky
Which they bounce

Spirit of the golden Palestinian Indian
The formula's cold, you simian
I came from Peru on a choo-choo
To train to bring the goo coo-coo
Sit down and make it do what it do
To me, too many too many too many too many
Businessmen trying to be GQ
That's not the case
I spit on the main floor
They rap on B2
I'm all around
Translated the vocab
Coming male and Hebrew


Anything is possible
Maybe a couple of mil from the Paris government
Might make this a new world event
When other groups come and leave like Tastycakes
The flavor will still be there
Rhyme ""soda"" with ""China""
Spitting phrases
You know I got two pair


Spaulding basketballs make no sound in the forest
I'm solo, around no crowd
No support
Where they claim they really heard my sound?
Illuminati cause I know them
Started off as one chosen deity's affection
I throw them 'bows to stomp em
I load them clips and pop one
The Yahtzi pee-pee
Dick in the bitches' butts
Still in the crates, but the bitches bring more bucks
I'm a pimp; bitch, where my cut?
Cuevo and champagne spilling out my cup
Walk with a strut; will ball, don't give a fuck
Handle the ball with a Iverson's touch

As I stop rappers tryin to copy Alpo(?) Rich Port(?) and AZ
My temperatures one-thousand-three
Look at these big head kids on labels tryin to MC
With a globe dome
I told you to tell that man to stay home
Tell Russell to call me with Sylvia Rhome
Gave him the gas, now he gotta pump in his ass
I don't care if you go out with Stacey Dash
Rentin cars, you tryin to copy Nas
Sound like A.G., you ain't my man from Cold Crush KayGee
Don't try to play me
You never made a record with Mo Bee, and Master P
I saw you on the Greyhound bus station floor
Layin down with a doo rag on like a circus clown
Strippers keep dancin around, I'm Bronx bound
Your fans catch migraines from me doin my thang

High-roller, program, this shit jam
To quick access, asses on my lap crouches
Dip through; y'all need a piece of this mental
Plus a sip of this dick in your mouth

To rub it all over your head

When I release the hits
There's no one on the invitation guest list
Organic kilometer, you feel the temperature
Playing with the advisor
I take the advice, opposite Mr. Nice
Bone you twice we hear it

Want me tell you the style that's goin on right now?
Girl I caught you last night
You're only 19 or 20, tryin to hide
Sittin in the back of a resteraunt, with a 99 year-old man
I'm startin to see that a lot
Hey fellas!
She's feisty feisty, just lettin it all hang out

Man I know, they're out there cheatin
Every girl in the club, exposin cleavage

Man I know.. I'm on the couch yo, I'm feelin laid back
I play my records over and over, my name is K-Mack
I'm over here on the chair, girls stop and stare
200 million pounds, you bring a box or 7
I'm on the news, girls you turn to Fox 11
You try to network, that watch and neck hurt
I give you irons, don't take so long to press my shirt
With the steam that's clean, you start to dream extreme
You chose one, you're on the creamer team
You move with men that beat 'em, they on the screamer team


Man I know.. you know the kind of sound, grab your Metro card
Get rid of your ego, meet me down in Chinatown
The classic Lincoln, respect the K when he speakin
I sleep in limos and headline shows at the Beacon
Broadway players, the City Hall to the majors
I'm on DVD, most cats still watchin Betas
I write with two pens and two pads, two songs on papers
Girls with FedEx sendin all thongs to me in all flavors
UPS delivery B what you givin me?


Man I know.. have you seen your girl tonight?
Call the manager, turn on the light
No studio tape, 300 groups wanna be in the remix
And bypass the need for fixin, loaded with chicks and
With the mic, rock icon, women like pops
Don't fear eyedrops
You're frozen with teardrops, double peein
That's right you seein, the best to believe it you receive it
Non-stop for the hip-hopp-in, that's right you stop man
Cause your records done flopped man
A full length video, that's the girl in stereo
I gotta see this, don't you believe this

Can you feel it?
Built to last, I'ma reduce competition
Stretched like a G-string stay in that ass
Eliminate your words you think are tough
By movin herbs, you think you're rough
Spice Girl figures, you're hype man sucks, y'all powderpuff
Stop thumpin stuffin
Everything your producer make is cuddly and fluffy
Soft as Kleenex tissue
You with the coalition pushin the vinyl
Funny style, movin the feminine issue
Attack you mentally, you know I would get you
Gorilla shots, you figure out what animal bit you
Tractor trailer from the side hit you
Tryin to figure what animal hit you
Tryin to figure out..
You tryin to play me like I'm from Montreal, Calgary
You never noticed G
How the thirty-eight weighs a lot of pounds and what it be
If you knew, you wouldn't be standin in front of me
100% of you is imitation, take off that baseball cap
In Jersey ask your mother, youse a wannabe
A 46 dollar, 3 color face watch
Yellow band, don't step to me, I know your estimate B
Don't question me
You met the rude awakening, find the best of me
I don't care about your favorite rapper they're less than me
Urinate on your V.I.P. area
Where girls roam, piss on your dome
Bodyguard, face the C-I-P area
You know what's coming nigga..
I knew I had to make a record soon
Destroy your whole mechanism
Compilate on your Meoshe jeans, in fake records soon
You blew up alright, youse a blip
Up in the air homo, your crew is a helium balloon
You guys with thug mentality
Wearin them tight ass black thongs with black Sassoons
Smooth on your anus
Your girl defecate my diamonds out with brooms, and mushrooms
You cats face the public here, you know the rules
From MC Hammer down to Lil' Romeo
Out of 2 million rappers you pick a name and lose
I penetrate news, my Tomahawk missles piss on Cruise

Flavors everywhere, I dare you to try and fly with me
Full speed ahead, you got no deal
I'm the real, down Melrose on a shopping spree
Something for me, usually some fly shit
Made just for me on an island in the highlands

Crack backs real fast in the quickie
I know you like that, G-strings come off
With your black tights, we can go nuts
Slap that ass... UHH
We can get drunk, smack that ass
Those high boots
Full length fishnet black body suits

He pays for the rotation
You pay for the relation
Your lyrics weak, the DJ must play
The town suffers, the people laugh at your frustration
Your vocals need Yugoslavia
Your rhyme need a vacation
When you rap I flip through the dials

Since the war, your rap's been depression
It's causing cities to suffer
Kids buy your whack CD, the families feel inflation
A recession like you the best and

We take 'em out like every night
Let's go, that's how we do, back to the city
Crack backs real fast in the quickie
I know you like that, G-strings come off
With your black tights, we can go nuts
Slap that ass... UHH
We can get drunk, smack that ass
Those high boots
Full length fishnet black body suits
A sexy tan (yeah)
I'm a big fan, big fan baby
Chicks love me, call me a big man
A freak by nature, don't be a hater
Drink it up right out of the alligators
Yo, we in the elevator
Gettin naked, Bonaventure
They can see us, baby don't fake it",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-shorty-lyrics
The Overviewer,Project Polaroid,UnKnown,"""The man that gets out of bed is accustomed to having the problems of the world
Upon his massive shoulders, whether asleep or awake. For this man
Opening the window in his pajamas, is secretly implying (KEITH) needs help!""

Bigger than rock ever was
The overnight sensation, with Ella Fitzgerald, Mahalia Jackson
At the Cotton Club, the limo's comin up to Harlem
USA, the black tie affair
Diana Ross and the Supremes, Patti LaBelle was there
Only 18 in a Ford, the Rudy Baker with Elliott Ness from The Untouchables
Y'all remember that?
I had the custom pinstripe suit, me and Frank Sinatra
Wore green in the crowd, everybody couldn't cope
That's right, the US army, America's #1 knight, CBS television
The camera's on me and Bob Hope
The beige cashmere, the top poet in the country
Shakin hands with the Pope... YEAHHH~!

The overviewer, chastizer
Mind tantalizer, sun beamin down on your visor
(Uh, uh, uh-uh, uh! Uh, uh, uh-uh, uh!)

The overviewer...
The most energetic, the popular extravaganza
The parade at Wrigley Field
With Lyndon B. Johnson, based on the true story
The small cable networks couldn't cover, such a huge territory
Way before the Hamptons and Eric Clapton
Kool Herc was 11 years old in Jamaica
Howard Cosell, was a baby Jocko, wasn't even rappin
Only me and Eisenhower
Before the wheels was invinted, the first guy to create electrical power
Y'all was in the Boy Scout camp, with a oil lamp
Way before the tennis classics, models in the runways
21 trucks me, the original, black lady from Star Trek
Watchin Evil Kneivel, land on the ramp
It gets no bigger than this, the lifestyle, ridiculous


The overviewer...
Change your diapers baby, you saw the cameo
Me on McHale's Navy, my book the #1 best seller
The horse ranch in Morocco, 3 nights in the Hilton
Elvis Presley walked up to me, the lobby's full of paparazzi
The greatest ever brings you to Chicago
I love the music and Sam Cooke and flyin on to tomorrow
Dinner for 3, Akai wasn't made yet
Babe Ruth bought the Rolls Royce, it was NBC, not the MPC
Photographers, all around Martin Luther King
The Nobel Peace Prize, chuck grounds
Father James did the split in the tuxedo
Entertainer of the year; I receive letters by the BILLIONS!
I thank the people of the world, including Washington D.C
The President can see me (the President can see me) YEAHHH~!

The little flavor they use, they ain't got game

Pretty ladies they hang, while you droppin them thangs

Like a powerful train, you can't handle my pain

Stuck to a keychain

Bobba-la-bang-bang
Shockin the ways, rockin them days
Sparkin 'em pays, yo!
Freeze, turn to 3's, on your knees
As free throws turn to bees


Break down the basslines, girls check your hangtime
Double dribble and fizzle, humble and fumble
If you go out, let it all hang
And sweat like a freebird on the 6th man
Don't get jealous, stop messin with my good name
I'm out here with sharp arts and a booty aim
Watchin the hall of game
The big show, got me insane
Threes to burn leave you in flame
Like chargin a freight train
Little game, or big game
Who's runnin the blitz game?

Dr. octagon, paramedic fetus of the east
With priests, I'm from the church of the operating room
With the strike support, scalpels since the holocaust
I do indeed in greed, explore meet the patients
Back to brooms with the nurse with the voodoo curse
Holding up office lights, standing at huge heights
Back and forth, left wing swing to north
East and south with blood pouring down your mouth
I come prepared with the white suit and stethascope
Listen to your heartbeat, delete beep beep beep
Your insurance is high, but my price is cheap
Look at the land... blue flowers!
Drawing by the purple pond, in the purple pastures blue flowers!
Drawing by the purple pond, yellow ink that flows blue flowers!
Drawing by the pond, look, it's raining yellow
Would you care to listen to me more? thank you
Holding bags on down right from the hospital
It's a patient that's worth to keep the germs off the turf
Cybernetic microscopes and metal antidote
Two telescopes that magnify the size of a roach
Three computers to cup of coffee planted with my hand and
Astroplanets detached turn on rear foggers
Cut the light on the kid, and turn the bright on
Supersonic waves combine and burn as brainwaves
I see the mascot of evil he's not kneivel
Shakespeare's gone don't even think about it
Yes, as I'm going to the park, I see... blue flowers!
It's raining green, by the pond blue flowers!
It's totally raining green, pouring blue flowers!
I smell the bees and the birds blue flowers!
Different aspects of life, blue flowers

They got he camera's everywhere
Yo your whole joint is under surveillance
But I was peepin' it out and yo, I think I can fix it
Know what I'm saying
Let me get busy, then we can get busy
I'm still the player, the mayor, the street corner government
Increase my growth, my style is dap, so intelligent
Fierce with diamonds and rings sparkle on my finger
I pose with Ho's, my Lager and my Feld Linger
The big casino, with mega loot like Al Pacino
Sharing stocks and trading bonds with the whole Gambino
Rosa Maria pass me the pizza
For girls who front I tell 'em hasta la vista
Riding with the stupid funk, is it real?
My trunk full of Mack Ten's, grenades made of steel
I got more cash then Clinton, pay off the FBI
My game top notch, the phantom known slick and sly
I got a house in LA, and one in New York
Snitches around, I must be careful when I talk
I got the number to call Elizabeth Taylor
My movie star girl friend, my mobile home trailer
You call your lawyer, let's handle make a settlement

It's time for business, your man got to step back
It's time for business, your man got to step back
It's time for business, your man got to step back
It's time for business, your man got to step back
Closing deals on Capitol Hill, I spin the wheel
I shock point blank range, just like a street electric eel
I chew your face off, just like a great white shark
Atomic lights on, my Caddy bouncin' in the dark
Through 125 and down another live street
You in Hollywood, neon lights shine on Vine Street
I ride around see my jealous type enemies
Some friends of mines on drugs and bad memories
Sammy L and Teddy's back sniffin' cocaine
They die from heart attacks with bullets in they brain
I keep rollin' with the phantom face cryin'
Laughin' and gigglin' while everybody's dyin'
Who told you open that tube and try to sniff the glue?
You in emergency, the room is turnin' dark blue
With black potion, I look into the ocean
My fast life style is watchin' you in slow motion
You got the ketchup, you standing with no french fries
Marked for death, with glasses on your dirty eyes
I don't know in Jackie's bar who killed Mr Green
I was home with my girl friend named Bernadine
Don't try to pin it on me, come on Ben Casey
I'm workin' 9 to 5, the fed's think i'm lazy
I know my game, I'm mad freaky undercover
Exotic psycho, and California panty lover
I see the news and blood drippin' from my shoes
He messed up money jack, i'm not the one to pay his dues

Now detectives appear they want a firm investigation
They tappin' my white phone for secret information
I get no sleep accumulatin' millions in a week
I walk by, you think I'm blind and I never speak
I see you scopin' my eye in the back of my head
Two blocks away, yo look around, now he's dead
Everybody's scheme is all vanilla ice cream
I catch you on the highway, put on my high beam
You see voodoo, you drop doo doo and a man appear
Happy birthday, goodbye in your last year
As I stand by your Hearst with the black coffin
You been sinning, winning, and flirting with the devil often
I hold the spirits, the songs to the murder case
No time for demons, don't step up in the phantom face
It's time for business, your man got to step back
It's time for business, your man got to step back

8 Jaguars designed up, 600 million ladies lined up
Shoes with built-in air conditioner
All 48 Mack trucks parked in position
Credit cards by the pages
You can't stop the helicopter and baller stages
I take care of adults
Send 20 thousand grants to kids all ages
10 grand pianoes, my TV show's The Sopranos
800 acres of free land
With a custom made zoo don't touch the animals
Bathroom toilet, and bathtub with diamond handles
8,000 flights a year
Send the women to El Salvador first class tickets to come over here


22 Porsches in front of 7 gas stations I own
Give every girl a New York a cellular phone
Interstate highway controller 22 thousand cars on the freeway
Co-signer by myself, under me one owner
800 thousand in charity, to the Red Cross and blood donors
Diamonds on my shoe soles
Bears and sheepskins, hunters make my coats from Polars
Support women, give 'em section 8 loyalty
With 50 thousand baby strollers
Send private jets out every 5 seconds to pick up high rollers
Milk containers with my name on 'em
Washing machines with my embrodiery and fame on 'em
Who could stop me?


With 8 bodies, I can perform in Dallas and L.A. and New York
And Miami, Texas and Denver, 3 more cities at the same time
Simultaneously sync'd up with the same rhyme
Lyrics come in braille
Did a show in Montreal, in an arena 62 thousand packed
Everybody was blind, 6 thousand pythons around my neck
3 tigers and 4 lions, just bought the tampon maxipad company
There's no slouch or slum in me

Six million suits, paid in full

Kissing you all over as we talk in first class
I’m open off her features
Smooth skin
Astronomical view
She stuck in the two-seater
Nipples are pretty
Penthouse suite in the marriott
Overlooking the city
Steamy sex in the sauna
Hot in mini dress with lace
Heels thrown in the corner
I move with a smooth influence
Sex in public places
Everybody watching
I stroke harder just to show my rudeness
That’s the real talk
Bust off in front of everybody
Let the nut drip of the sidewalk
You would talk to angel
The cock running half mast
The tits were strangled
Johnson & johnson baby oil on the anal
We can make it sweat
Ask the family members
Ask and incest

Feel About You,Lost Masters Volume 2,UnKnown,"Yeah, Kool Keith
Oh yeah

Girl you know my name in all directions
The way I feel about you
Honey can take that, secret advice from me
The way I think about youuuu, and what you do

Executive upstairs, I deal with the same list
Broke people love MTV Cribs
Chewin a dollar fifty slice of pizza
A minor rapper dissin they low income lifestyle that's rich
Fans that work at buck forty jobs; braidin hair on the week
And they can't afford hygiene products and cotton swabs
Fantasizin what it's like to sip champagne
Quarter juice figures, livin through another monkey's fame
Get my name straight, you should be ashamed
Layaway plan action, get ready for concerts you can't afford
Struggle to buy that ring, another imposter
Diamond wannabe like necklace girl on the pre-paid
Cell phone with a fake gold chain
Caught up in illusion, fakin like a mothersucker


Oh my God!  Another Chrystler with the Hemi
To boost the ego, let that car be itself
You can't turn it into a Rolls Royce Bentley, over stingy
Makin you spend gently; women hover
Is that leather goose down to rubber?
I'ma investigate the fella, 40 percent rabbit
Your wife ain't wearin a chinchilla
Nobody want they coat to get wet, step under the umbrella
Is the Rolex real?  What'chu gon' tell her
With them cheap suits you bought from Portabella
600 pounds with five stomachs
Big baller, in the leased Escalade painted vanilla
TV's in the headrest
With 36 White Castle hamburgers, he can't digest
Caught up in illusion, fake like a mothersucker


Everybody's turnin groupie
Guys fight the girls to get in first
I hate to see a dude with a baseball cap jump the line
To get in the club like they carry a purse
Get to the front with no money
Turn around quick, they be the worst
The latest schedule, process material
Love to listen to the caviar and sushi rhymes
But just had a bowl of Frosted Flakes cereal
Songs that make you imagine you live imperial
The problem is the poor watch the many, extravagant videos
Facin the most highest celebrities, livin on they lows
There's no turf and you ain't plush flossin
K-Mart is the new place, your mom used to go to Woolworth

Chillin back with the hoodrats, single to broke
Give 'em out cause it's like that, throw 'em a stack
Opportunity smack, boss game you lack
Big girls and poles, flip steady like an acrobat
Rotate and shake around, bring small hate around

Feather in weight, my sneakers light when I float on

I come around people peak, but scared to cough
One major label like you cryin, you wanna get off
My closet pack, rappin for a stack with more
With Puffy and Jennifer cookouts, ridin along

Deliver your cassette, amateurs embarass me
Give me somethin to play, I sit in the big meetings with Damon Dash
Urinate on your shoulders, my delivery is arrogant
I expect cash, don't play anything cartoon in front of Mike Biv

You sportin Houston's kicks, Central Park West
You rhyme and practice

I keep the Sony Cam, between crushes
I take all Spanish chicks, international rapper
On tight bars with the Spanish mix
Hittin Spanish licks


Statues, buildings, street killings, living could be heaven

The high price, hookers gamblers pushers
Subways no way, cab some days

And rock big leathers, and match the Timbs up
Lace the kicks up, the new fitted (new fitted)
A long chains make the chickens get real hot
Stop playin, it's the Big Apple
We take a bite out, conference calls blow ten thousand (yeah)
Bungalo six baby, on just a night out (woo!)

A white girl from Boston set him up at the show
A Spanish kid walked up to him with a t-shirt
From the projects that said RSO, I'll say yo
The FBI retreated, three Desert Eagles
And a sawed-off double barrel
I'm watchin MTV with the popcorn
The commercials are off, now the pop is on

The voodoo's on that dude
The whack comedian that ate the wrong food

People can't believe it
The record company's gonna sell 20 million now
Heavy promotion, 20 zillion now
The crap table spendin
Somebody was playin slick on his format with a funny game of poker
The Riddler came in a gray Benz
The Penguin walked in the tour bus, when they got to Gotham City
Mr. Freeze was out in the Bellagio in Vegas
They didn't care what the entourages was comin
They want the Joker, the Mad Hatter
Is waitin on the deck for him, like a Red Sox batter
With Rodriguez in the bullpen, my African witchcraft is tight
What's scary I don't write with a dull pen
Like some guy suckin the cock like a John Lennon fan
With a cough drop, who spits semen up from the cocks
Like they walkin up Bronx blocks


Comin through the speakers with no heat
Like you grew up so bad, name a tough street
I hate suburban guys who think they urban
Coffee and donuts, the only thing they servin
From a cartoon bedroom, man close your Incredibles curtain
Funny guys that wanna look at a man is certain
They pay to see a large condom workin
With voodoo all over you, Huggies around your feathers
Don't come to me with doo doo all over you
Seven tribes surround you, you have Zulu all over you

The Legendary,Diesel Truckers,2004.0,"I know the game bro, I count the same dough
P.I. style, gators with the Kangol
I move on the floor, hit the towel, same flow
60 minutes on stage, spectacular show
Kurt on the turns, edged up with sideburns
We do the thing right, we do the thing tight
The press is there, we get you out the spotlight
You think you hot right, over like Cartwright
You can't even rhyme, I leave you when you start to write
Cash and run, yo cash in son
How you gon' take me, I heard of you vaguely
Strictly the master, you can't game me

We sport the Kangols with the flyest clothes
""The legendary, the metaphor king with metaphor swing""
Collect our checks and take the girls home
""You know you rappers are lame, full time I'm runnin the game""

Momentum I get 'em I spit 'em with venom
My cadences hit 'em, like his girl babysit him
You know the facts, clone stage put your acts on
Gas up, you pump up, with the Exxon
Girls get wet, spin around, break your neck
Like Crazy Legs, Adidas suits start to break and sweat
Come out retirement, fools come and place your bet
You just a canine kitten that I gotta pet (MEOW!)
I'm climbin up, role call, I ain't finished yet
Speed is hype feed, offbeat you regret
Catch the breeze, stop and ease
Stop it please, now you phony kid you tryin to jet


I set up roadblock, rock 'em sock 'em like a robot
Women touch theyself, grab they parts for delf
Man you stay on the shelf, can a man flow?
Can a man go, right at the place
At nighttime, watch me glow, get on the field
Quarterback, watch me throw, watch me flow
Turn around, put up your names up, fire and flames up
Come and you came up, change the game up
Talk and walk, talk and hawk
Jock me now, jock me later, your DJ slide

Come out the shower, pop your ass with two towels
Snap your gum with your toes snappy, that's the swaggy

Got your girl up on the dickhead
Sucking the dick now
Professional

I'm Durant & Westbrook, you came to help like fish
Because you sound like an unsure, insecure nigga
Bank off your mommy cheeks
Who hear the sneakers squeak
The New Jersey Nets watch me from the scout seats
LeBron called me to come be with the Heat
The organization showing me where I'll be living
A couple of Spanish girls looking on the balcony
With thongs from triple connected suites
The balance is good, J know I'm good for 500 million a year
Cause I stay young, looking like Ray Allen
Off with the mentioning the fat court
Show the rookies how to stop wearing the Citizen and the Seiko Quartz
Cum shot over the female rappers, Spike Lee amazed how I got the shot off
Girls order more hot dogs and pretz', make them run wet
Watch me undercover with Oakley specs
No doubt, auto-tune is back


Yo, it's Metropolis
They call me grizzy-green, I'm playing position
Pass your 17-year-old daughter
Drink her little body with ice like a cold glass of water
There's no rookie that ever shook me
I'm the baker, the room was full of cookies
I'm in the rat race, confused in labyrinth, quit asking
Metrop' is know to flow with passion
Inspection of the rational
Don't confuse the grains thrown, insanity, that's mathematical
I sound like Rakim, you need tires screaming
My pants open, she's gagging while I'm flown on the Major Deegan
Metrop' is known, next exit is Jerome
You need to take this to the heart and strive
Play your body like Xbox Live
Introducing internet sex
A blunt and Henny and a 4-hour nut, then you next
Only fuck white chicks that's bisexual
I need their brain to be open-minded, intellectual
The street runner
Sexy dope fiends sucking dick, nodding off between two dumpsters


They're using my past beats
Just to stay on the pants like a crease
Your dime like to get down on one knee
Holding a football for me to kick so smooth
I take a bath while she taking a shit
I'm the new building, New York's tallest
Woman gets soaking wet, panties drenched retarded
Pass off the cream, get comfortable, sleep inside your queen
Your family call me Steve Mc
100%, rappers want to get a fork and eat Steve shit
I know how to plant plants that come up through the horse manure
I gave them the ball, they looking around for an open man like Stuart
Your girl on her stomach with popsicles in her ass
She say I'm the coolest

Like they mix baking soda and pasta
Only thing these motherfuckers touch, is Tide and soap powder
(Fuckin soap powder!) Microphone perpetration I see through
I want my vocals up louder
Bitch I write some verses with high octane curses
Popeye and Kentuck' sponsor
I turned down deals with Church's
Y'all fucked up cause the Colonel made the purchase
I can't no longer support 50 thousand MC's, homeless and worthless
The shit department, I thought you was a delivery
Packagin, I put you in charge, alright supervisin piss
My messages get across state to state when I shift doo-doo
Out on freight, I take a break
Laugh at you assholes, with club soda and lemon cake
Listen close, examine is that the star flow?
While you talkin baboon shit on the radio
I cancelled seein ducks at the magic show
I know some Mexicans that shit through, the custom sunroof
Butt-naked in Barstow
With bloodhounds on the back of the graffiti Air Force Nikes
That bark low, remember you fuckin with somebody pro
I shake the piss off my dick, on your album intro
Next time you tell the engineer to bring it in slow
Toy-ass niggas, I been past niggas
Test crash dummies, I know people that work with these, crash niggas
For the last 6,008 months I've been hearin trash niggas
With fucked up paparazzis
That think they clownin big-head motherfuckers
Hot vaginas under they crotch
I like when they bullshit on the mic, and play hopscotch
Touch the controls, adjust your platinum and gold
Put the coke all up in your fuckin nose
Don't sleep you better take that No-Doz
Ain't no motherfucker pushin kilos
Ask the motherfucker next to you, he knows
Raggy-aggy, wear your pants baggy
In front of your used Jaggy
You ain't 24 track you still macky
Opposite dress that's tacky
Y'all fuckin with Jonathan Braggy
Basket of bread you grabby
Your fuckin sides are overweight, can't come in here lookin stupid and flabby
LYRICAL KING~! (lyrical king)
LYRICAL KING~! (y'all know, lyrical king)
LYRICAL KING~! Motherfuck it

Lyrical king
You know the lyrical king when you see him
I don't have to reveal myself to motherfuckers nowhere ever
When I walk in the room, you rip your motherfuckin papers up
You shut the studio time down
You get that motherfucker out the booth
You tell that nigga he's whack
You let motherfuckers know, who's in the motherfuckin back
You serve that coffee, you serve that tea
You let a motherfucker know he's comin out the fuckin teepee
Fuck you motherfuckers, and all you whack-ass motherfuckers
You know who the motherfuckin lyrical, motherfuckin king is!

Bronx in the house
Y'all know how to ill, I'ma take you to the real
Challenge the ill, brother to God
You just a ancestor, you know the shit dyker
You ride around Manhattan as a gay biker
Non-homo, you a gay hiker
Trust funds one on your nose
Lethal injections, front row at the Source Awards
My public shocked, pee on publicity
The urine splash off the Billboards
The top MC to me is Traci Lords, get what I mean?
Man, Traci Lords
Plastic fake like your backup band with drum setup
Guys blowin horns
With light Twinkie sounds on your keyboards
Y'all mad at each other

Y'all want Star Wars
Y'all want Star Wars
Y'all want publicity, y'all want Star Wars
Y'all want them Star Wars

My job is to utilize beats like this
Rap on beats like this, you know the amplitude, is rude
Mad planet at Sizzler
Ballers love the open bar but they're secrets with the seasoning
Type of hyper king to defecate in your food
Ask Tommy King from the health department
I put the urine stains in the mansion
That's $75 a apartment
All secret toilets well
Number one rapper, go in the public bathroom
Don't even stop at Shell, around Puerto Rican Day parade
Blacks feel it, relax under my {?}
Your family is Frankie Beverly, cats spit out the Maze

Y'all want them Star Wars
Y'all want that publicity
Y'all want them Star Wars
Y'all want that publicity

Teachers from Del Monte used to Bath & Bodyworks
Familiar, when I'm layin in the cut
Watch me front in a 310 car blastin Ashanti
Or Maury Santana, scatter takin the honies out to Panda Express
For the Panda's best, girl the exttravagance is lovely
Though the business is about to go down
Take you down to the alley, where you think the top models buy the dress
Easy on the hot wings, baby you got 2 real players
You better share them things
I wear the real, you flaunt the costume
Flash your bubblegum rings, like they new
Tomorrow watch the Japanese dress, y'all follow
That's right

I'm a particle matter, data splatter, fatter, badder data
Reach up 'til I'm over the top, the competition sinking in the swamp
Everybody trying to go above the basket to reverse
Get they shot blocked like a vodka

Calculation is approximate, I'm fetching the documents
No team can stop me on offense, most rappers don't have the confidence
To launch and get off the ground a couple inches
More than a dark knight of the flight
Looking over the sky like Batman, my only comp' was Spider-man
The Avengers coming after me in an SUV van
Beach weather, I got an SUV tan
The cosmic intergalactic button I press on my hand
Spaced out 'til the night is gone
Drinking Patrón, I changed my name to Patron
All rappers become cheerleaders with neon pom-poms
My radiation melt down R & B songs
Singers turn to liquid, MC's turn to cosmic biscuits

Toothpicks pluckin dog shit out they teeth
Gruesome gorilla who boo boo girls bowels move superstars
MC's got it doo doo
Get down, y'all know how the mayor sound
Big player sound, throw feces at the windshield wiper
You swing off the road with a diaper
The shit hit the wall, the studio formica
The urine roll off the wall, bounce off the top of your head
Drip on your cypher
The Michael Jackson of rap with my fuckin glove
You niggas are bullshit, turtledove
You're low class turtle bugs
Fuck them drinks at the pubs
The jam comes like lightning dubs
Bitches I been with before y'all can think about blondes
Bustin they knees on rugs


I am what I am dealin with rap, I'm a pro
I'm laughin at you clowns that ain't got no flow
Word on the street Trevor mark, Dave is a homo
You beefin with Bobby Grind, nigga that's a no-no
I'm like the real Cali niggas doin hits in low-lows
I got a kite in jail sayin Harry I'll work for pro-pro
Somebody said Trev got caught, fuckin Romeo
Niggas talk tough but they hard tomato paper
Look at me now motherfucker, I'm makin moves that's major
I got a million daily flows how you want it now or later
And Bobby always told me money and fame bring haters
Just ask Wanda, what happened when I took her for a ride
The pussy was so good, I pushed my love inside
She gave it up when I nutted, she sucked it up

There are 8 billion 2 thousand white black records

I know the industry is wet like a labia
Everybody's crazy, gone hysterical
Def Jam flopped, the whole Epic was a miracle
M.C.'s came psycho, toy like Tyco
Poppin' that weak shit like Myers, you ain't Michael

Coco puffs, your crew remind me of a Cheerio
You're like a condom, an old piece of dried up sperm

M.C.'s come up they call themself now Papa
I'm entertained watchin' prime time do do droppa
You dissed the naked man, you ain't the boss man

I kidnap Amy, grab my tapes back from Marc Genova
And stick an enema pipe right into Faith Newman

Niggas still lickin' my dick like chicken bones
Who's on wax with pumps on wack soundtracks?
Lisa Cortez or Ed shoulda called me
Russell and Lyor, Andre know that shit would bore me
Look in your Rolodex Naked Man, I come and flex
Tie up your anus rectum piece, brothers heads are next

I went to Hammers house some people didn't know me
Dave Jacobson was lying, what the fuck he just told me?

Men write for magazines with G-strings
I'm not a Chicago bully, ask Phil
I got seven rings, the championship crown
Exhaust pipes, everything you let out your butt is brown
The enemas I give bring the paparazzis around
That sets me up for the cover of Vibe
Shake hands on the court
Touch your sandwich after I play with my penis
Where's your startin five
Who want Bob Couse, who wanna make Bob news
To match me you gotta pay Bob dues
I bring an NBA four with a dumb construction book
To the kids in your high school
Battle me son you must be high fool
With skinny legs disappearin from the cocaine
Your biceps smaller than your chain
There's a CBA team that might take you
You need protein, and food
Go home the power forwards and centers break you
Rub your face against the fiberglass
The coliseum's jam-packed
You can't rhyme your way out of a tiger's ass

Bad kids I send you to the dean
The El Brothers rock the lime green

Ask Sal, about my perfection
When the projects wait for superstars
With super cars comin out the T connection
Mess with me you be the first man with a C-section


Now they gon' wear the aprons and stack pancakes they fakes
I'm the righthand man of Lenny, seven million cash

You foolin like a rookie, you're just a Marbury
New York Knick'n, with the little bit of light you gettin
Got you sniffin, +Uptown Saturday Night+
Got a little Saturday hype

See I'm tired of hearin some of you cats rap dawg
It's just some of the saddest
A waste of time and a wasted rhyme on a
CD or iPod, it's just a bunch of madness
Your flow's the same on every record
You talk about the same
I don't even know if you consider your weak skills above the average
You spit the same old baggage, you just a wannabe savage
Your lyrics are so tragic
Youse just a silly rabbit
I know you wish you had some of my magic
But you can never have it
See because I'm one of the classics, a rap fascist
Me leaving the game? Check my archives dawg
I know you wish you could grab it, snatch it
Imagine, you could be like me
With all of your raps mastered - yeah

Even Hitler knew about my rank
Since the Berlin Wall, the rise and fall

I can use the more deeper chemicals, instead of this
They leave with enemas~!

Y'all do cheerleader rhymes, studio scared growth
Look over your shoulder, can't flow niggas
In the maxi-coat, maybe mink

Just order your two-piece Kentucky Fried to go
That watch on your arm you said it was real?  You lied you know
Actin like a Spanish guy goin crazy over one girl
The latest thing in New York - overprotective insecure asshole
A J-Lo lookalike with a Burger King stomach
Man go ahead and hide your ho, my flow hit Mexico

Rewind no fast forward, a lot of stamps on my passport

Woman turn on your TV, channel 7, ABC News, don't you see me?

So what you didn't vote for me, I'm Congress
My pee stains tag your white Dodge Magnum
Make the girls come out and say what's that on your armrest?
Security forces, ask the fire department I alarm best
With overcooked mushrooms, and turnips
I woke my kids up, y'all tryin to battle me all night
Suckers went to bet on the pro
9 million rappers, fell asleep with cigarettes in they hand
Let they babies burn up

Goin against nuclear power
Marble floors with ceramics, I defecate in your shower
It's not about comin off the head of the testicles
My job is to make a foe write one verse for 30 hours
No fancy restaurants, and botanical gardens
A lot of guys with fake talk
I see 'em all out there with pink GMC trucks
Hand another man flowers, my competition wear haltertops
And sport backs with a lot of powder

Fans follow me, Janet Jackson's father Joe asked me for my autograph

Down the corridor, be in 54

Towels with my initials, spotlights on my bathroom

Words to the editor, I would love to check in to say  in Vegas with Adrian Moore
Upscale talent with the jacuzzi, built in the middle of the sweet floor
As a classy way to convince
Her high heels, her uppin’ to use the tone of my voice for sexual intercourse
Rub her back so good, she want me to be her boss
Once the strobe lights start working she sees the panties in slow-motion start to come off
I’m sliding real cool without using force
A touch above Christina with my hands between her
She had to taste the natural smoothie
In the 944 beige Porsche
 her sister’s my best friend
She give me females’ numbers I request
Who wanna be wined and dined by the man of Forbes
It depends on what the pads absorb
I know for sure a lot of reality housewives are bored
I drive around with no draws
Notify the company where she work at
Tell her to answer the phone if she home
With a slow grip and pet one of her cats
She need lingerie on share
So I can see how the cheeks look from the back
Get the keys to her BMW, drive to get condoms at Walgreens at CBS
While she takin’ a bath
The buns, I wanna put butter on them like baked bread
Whatever she got, my smooth hand can pull ‘em in half
After you close your laptop you need to stop
Virtual reality and stop thinkin’ in the past
I can give you a option, baby adoption
Or you could wear a g-string and a mask
Uplift yourself to levels you’ve never been
Ocean view room and a pelican 
While I’m rubbin’ you down
Sippin’ a black bottle and look like dawn
It’s the beverage
This evening celebration, I’m lookin’ for your motivation

Mad Cow disease nigga, you ain't no MC nigga

Mountain climbin with dimes
Ladies know I'm simple with mines

Let the public see me piss off the Hollywood sign

Fuck you I work overtime, at the check cashin place
I spray your bitch ass with mace
Barfin these Wendy's hamburgers
All over your Reeboks and all over your face, BLEWAAWHH

Urinated in the fruit punch, while y'all light and blaze blunts

Designer nice, the waiter lookin for the tips
Make her pay him twice, perpetrating on precise

Zoom on your fake asses, bouncers lookin for VIP wrist passes

But I'm titanium steel bars, they can't polish this

I did the game already before they made Parker Brothers
You bought the Donny Pizo, ruin the game
I put the first man on the moon, presented new in the game
In the back war to watch
When the mink got stained I tricked the money off

Right beside your toilet, my rubber remain
I reduce the lower rate, and eatin rate, but my status gain
Four tiny pieces in a bucket
Hit the In-N-Out Burger, get in the carpool lane

Steadily lettin the words flow to your brain
Ladies not being true to their game
Liars, cheaters and deceivers blindfoldin women, prayin on weak players
Girls hatin the next level vibe like I'm from some other tribe
Too blessed to be stress ladies and gents

Droppin gold metaphors while you do your chores

Seattle Tacoma,The Commi$$ioner 2,UnKnown,"Yeah
Tacoma Seattle police
Had to come get my bags right in front of Hooters
The whole restaurant watchin
But I'm here
I will find my prey
International, or domestic
The underground is on level E
Most rappers rap on level B
That's considered G.O. proposition
Freestyle competition
You win a Volkswagen on MTV hosted by D.D
Diamonds spilled around the bars, Parve on the Magnum
Pee-pee the request by NBC
The cheese caviar for the dancers, the high-end romancers
Turn off their tracks
Octapawn is gone, 39.99
Motel on the highway, the ""Thong Song""
With Christinie drinkin a martini
You say it's that Millie crochet'n with the yarn
The false don, and a herb, that's right
I'm Agron, a.k.a. The Fonz
Bounce with gator sneaks, handsome good C-notes, the bomb
And vogue 'em out, take 'em to dinner like Don
Shawn know who I am, serve me Grey Poupon
Flavor extra-bration
Mess around you catch a laceration
The voodoo come Hatian the top which he popped maker
You the lagoon faker, I might sign again with a major
Panties gotta be sweet, they can't come in fishy flavors
Everybody's gettin big
Mom give me more potatoes
Jump out and train at the gym with an El Ness brim
In the Phantom with the original fantastic Orangemen on my side
That look like rocks, chicks say he's with Ben Grimm
Ex porn star
Three bottles on ice, look fox he got the rocks
See with the cinnamon, salmon cakes relaxed
I cook on top of your cassette tapes
With Denny's chocolate
I'll force you off the highway for two spicy chicken tins
And two milkshakes
Amino acids can't cover your lip then milk weights
Six pounds, I'll face your anorexia Hollywood phony legs
You better buy Tony's legs
I'm out to bang, two hammers in your Dell
Find you upsidedown in China like David Sucko in a Honda XL
Non-stable crab lice
Get your face changed, movin in different hotels
I guarantee liars'll see ""Fright Night""
You cats cover your calves

They say I'm rap mogul Russell Simmons in the Hip-Hop Summit

I'm what your wife is loving
Broadway ventriloquist
Every rapper out sit on my lap like a puppet
He's my miniature-sized Flip Wilson, watch him talk
""What you mean you working me like a puppet?
Okay, then who are you?""
Whoa, shut up, I'm the owner of you
I can make you move your shoulders too
Frosted cookies, I don't do
Because you rap from the butt on down with the Hostess crew
Cupcakes by the tons, your girl has some nice Cinnabuns
You rap in the booth and brag, I like the way her juices run


They say my songs ain't radio-friendly, so they don't play me
I'm on that Gucci, Fendi, bitches steadily envy
I'm all about my loot, niggas calling me pretty
I'm on that Puss In Boots,  niggas calling me kitty-kitty
My fat cat got niggas committing murder
Drowning in this pussy is a death you never heard of
I keep it low-key but you can find me in 
I rub off, motherfucking jerk-off
I make a rapper upset, piss a DJ off
Niggas mad but fuck that, turn your feelings off
Turn the lights on and see a fucking icon
Not that shit on your iPhone but the shit that Michael Jacks-on
Shade Clock, Kool Keith got me on this motherfucking track but no pimping
I look like an R & B singer, right, but no singing


Fred Beans, I keep it locked, God know I keep it true
Why fake what it is, watch your place, what it do
Rappers, they be mad at me, DJ's, they after me
But I'm in the hood on my grind causing catastrophes
I would prefer to keep it low as possible while trying to blow
I'm out here stashing all my money watching all my statures grow
Keep your bitch away from me, especially if you're cuffing her
'Cause one minute, she's in your arms, the next minute, I'm fucking her
You can catch me on a late night trying to get my head right
Or with my team in the studio getting my flows tight
My comfort level is never short of a thousand
That's why I only feel safe when a thousand niggas surround me
So think what you want to think when it comes to a G
You know a lot of gangsters but not like me
So grab yourself a cup, fill it halfway up

Ride through your town, blinging off my solid 
Woman with veils pouring out my ginger ale
I don't do drugs, never did fishscale
Lamborghini, I see it shipping out of Israel
Camels walk through the dust, I don't feel the wind
Money is nothing, a  I spend
Buy the wig, which one you want, the China wig
Mascara and MAC, your butt is getting kind of big
I go in your house, you drop your bra where you live
You show me your life, your bald-headed little kids
Text the ahk', leave your panties in the Maybach
Get with your green and blonde hair, I'm coming with the gray fox
Six thousand, six hundred for the counter
Imagine the cold

Imagine the cold x6

Ali wiggle to the top, Ali wiggle to the bottom
She wearing them panties, baby, you don't got to
Let me hold them, finger inside lotto
A smooth model, aces in the green bottle
We slam the car door, you like the taste of avocado

You got my name on your breast, ask Kanye

Eugh! He's naked!

I got my male G-strings, my tiger stripy underwear
Gettin' ready with my rubbers out, I have to pull my tuffers out
Look here lovey dovey, let me lick your legs
Then taste the pretty clitty, tour naked through your city
I see 'em changin' faces, I have to poke 'em up
Turn that butt dog-style, watch and let me stroke 'em up
Leave that ass hangin', facin', pointin' at the ceiling
I'm takin' draws off, your legs panties keep revealing
You suckin' candy, erotic toys'll come in handy
Lick my dog and jerk my dick with this Vaseline
Hold it, lick it, you've never done it girl. What you mean?
I'm on the seat drinkin' wine, doin' a sixty-nine
You my love with titties out, you moan, scream and shout
I got your car wet, you bet that you fuckin' sweat

Erotic ride, cruise
Let me lick your shoes
I'm in the paper naked
Posin' in the daily news
(x3)

Continue lickin' that body piece, your pussy needs a stickin'
You're on my dick sittin', waiting for the train
It's three o'clock, the Amtrak, it hasn't come yet
Round and round, we're fuckin' steady on the Greyhound
The bus driver double-teamed with a screwdriver
You on the floor with passengers, people cheerin' more
I'm wearin' latex, my suits, girls wearin' capes
I'm lickin' stomachs up with peaches, something filled with grapes
Pourin' soda down your spine, between your panty line
Wit' you leather thongs, that Dallas, Texas ass is mine
I'm rubbin' syrup, puttin' chocolate all on my body
You got the taste for me, well come on, lick it hottie!
Back and forth, you don't moan, I'll make you fuckin' cough
Don't take them panties off, pull 'em to the side
When I roll down the highway, I throw your legs up as we ride
Exotic fingers rubbin' anal grease in your butt
Bring dildos out, the sperm'll satisfy, erotic slut
Jammin' bats and baseballs down your asshole
You're screamin' pleasure on the bus, in the rainy weather
Once again, I left the Port Authority naked

Erotic ride, cruise
Let me lick your shoes
I'm in the paper naked
Posin' in the daily news

Super parties, I come, exposed in the limousine
I pick up two cans, I like to smell gasoline
Lightin' matches in the back seat, our bodies heat
I'm kissin' lips and rubbin' motor oil on your hips
The chauffeur's drivin', I'm in that crack, pussy-divin'
It's hot in Miami for a girl star to suck my jammy
A shemale drag queen stops and fucks the driver Sammy
I'm watchin' two films and starrin' in one
Not old fashioned, with cans of gas, havin' fun
Wakin' up, pumpin' butt, I'm still ridin'
Three girls at the light cover up, I ain't hidin'
I threw my draws, then pissed out the window

Erotic ride, cruise
Let me lick your shoes
I'm in the paper naked

More incredible than David Blaine, the official one

Can you handle the close dancing, grapes and wine?
European suit, the best service
Hugh Hefner atmosphere, bikini extravaganza
Blondes feed me hors d'ouerves, at the Playboy Mansion
Poolside view, E&J mixed with Perrier
Larger than Dean Martin, never catch me doin ""The Best Of""

Love to hear those voices, enough respect

I play against a well trained animal, you move next
Stylist got you dress, like you comin in from Budapest
Lookin like Burt Lancaster
You slow to circle down backwards like a old lady drivin a steering wheel
When Dr. Martin choose 'em they probably diss the suits
I wish the competition create somethin new faster
Believe me, you'll find that place on Aster
The heavy and the deep sustain
I Kodak freeze your frame, pee on your righthand pinky rang
Stop you while you recording nonsense insult your character
Make you rewrite the whole thang
Reject the pie in the studio your mother bring
Show you gorillas when Rodney's not here
It depends on how many Burgers you produce, before I let you be King
Feel the snap of the yellowjack', bee sting with guaze pads
On your baggage claim bags, any object in my way who brags
Sit on top of feminine, deoderant protective rags
Y'all face the awards on the podiums, thankin everyone who made you
Don't forget your girlfriend, weightliftin boyfriend's bonin him
The extra

It's Jahizzle your nizzle, tough as gristle epistle like
Fall from tossin Soviet hammer and the sickle
Red dyke but doper infant, I invent communistic
Fried drum chum or high jazz biscuits wicked
I picket bigots and I boycott the bigamist
My Johnson, TV dinner Swanson, good light licorice
Suckers on my shitlist, are so shiftless
Stick out like an ishthmus
I lob globs of mucus on snobs whose jobs make 'em listless
The effigy in lethargy, my weaponry the Christmas
I crackle like a cracker crumble in your mouth
Call him hairy dissentary, bloody's how he's comin out
And my crew are thick as Chuck Norris chest mayne
Let's burn this pyre higher, throw your rhymes on the death flame
To dunk I jump off two feet, J Rich, Dominique
Players who push off on ass cheeks like Jordan are so weak
They cheat, no jumpman for me, no 23 jersey
Rhyme nerdy, lines dirty, I hurry, not girly MC's curtsey
I'm so merciless I show no mercy
I'm just like Percival my body's so sturdy
My rhymes are dirty, get up early
MC's have Hasidic forelocks like Shirley
Temple...

They choose a foul like Sam
Gettin hyped up with a 2-piece, all sniffed up to the bone
The city fall for the biblery fast
Duplicates, DJ's people follow 'em, I ignore the imitation replicas
They think they Larry Graham
These dudes are messed up in the mind of high on ham
With DJ's testin racks, ears out with new radio programme
Scientific defects bounced off the walls in the projects
It kills me, when evil stays 24 hours
Everybody who's a demon hang they coats on the rack
After companies made billions off of Biggie Smalls and 2Pac prototypes
People wanna remove the devil horns off the top of they head
Move into conscious rap
And stab you while you not lookin right in the back
Rob you again, show you the floorplan
Of the commercial map, MC's linin up from the circus need to be slapped

Giant Stadium,The Commi$$ioner,UnKnown,"Yeah yeah yeah! Tri-state area
Live in New Jersey, and motherfuckin Giant Stadium
Live for the first time, live on stage the motherfuckin Commi$$ion
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen
Please stand in line, please stand in line
We just now been confirmed, that's tonight main event has been sold out

I'm that new fuckin product, they chose over Ray Allen
While the coaches scream
The uniform on each teams are cheap
Look at the roster everybody, this general manager signed got no talent
He's not thinkin I'm out to interfere with his offense
The league sees me, pull the rims out the glass like Dawkins
Bruce Rattner can't match the contract
Reebok's fuckin up, with bad shoes
My agent got me eight thousand one billion
A dollar deal just once a week to wear New Balance
You a freshman junior nigga the seniors keep you silenced
Graduation you not goin pro you won't make it H-O

Giant motherfuckin Stadium!
When you speak of legends make sure you mention my name
I'm the last don standin, when I spark the flame
My name been ringin bells before coke got stepped on
When Harlem was the mecca, out of town cats were slept on
Labels scared to sign me they say my shit is too raw
The only reason niggas is still breathin, cause they roll with the law
People say I changed, but I'm just a little calmer
I clutch so many guns motherfuckers oughta call me Palmer
Think of somethin sweet I'll put 5, up in your cheekbone
I oughta get honored for every coward, I touched with the chrome
Dope seller, hood fella, some say I'm worse than Suge
I'm a Harlem Knight f'real 'til the day I'ma rep my hood
Check my file dawg I spent 12 years in a cell
Then it's back to clutchin heat, if this rap shit fail~!

Carbo-hybo-spaghetti will make you niggas mo' stronger
Too much milk and powder will fuck up your muscles
I warned you, you can't play forward
And backaway with that bullshit, off the rim shot
Just got off waivers, I'll make your team hot
Coach you up and coming, give y'all the championship you don't got
Make your crew practice and run track a lot
You might pack a spot, win two games out of 160
It can't be
You know I can't be injured, before the season stop
Because y'all bitch up and miss me
Dunk on motherfuckers more harder when they diss me
Then chicken niggas they turn crispy
I leave 'em sniffed up, alley where the piss be
They girl happy for pennies motherfucker count this G
Minutes on the court, you bastards can't get mad
I let y'all play a 2 or 3

Photo Shop (Outro),Project Polaroid,UnKnown,"Tan photos depict smiling faces
Births, parties, holidays (HAPPY BIRTHDAY~!)
Children's birthday pics
People take pictures of the happy moments in their lives
Someone looking through our photo albums
Would conclude that we had led a joyous leisurely existance
Free of tragedy
No one ever takes a photograph, of something they want to forget
According to the Oxford English Dictionary
The word snapshot, was first used in 1808
By an English sportsman by the name of Sir Andrew Hawke
He noted in his diary almost every bird he shot that day
Was taken by snapshot, not a hurried shot
Taken with a deliberate aim, a snapshot then
Was originally a hunting term",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-photo-shop-outro-lyrics

You don't wanna mess with the pampered kid
Pissy Huggy wets wet up your car seat
Dude I do best, Dougie East
Call me the rugrat urinater, Dougie West
I could be your nightmare, defecate with the diapers
Super baby with the Enfamil formula
Defecate on top of your chest, woman warm up the bottle
With titty milk in the El Dorado
The Fisher Price rattle's my motto, ride the Tonka truck
Down to stay in your area, drop a used diaper on your vocals
You other marshmellow head kids don't wanna play, in my area
Break the toys, that thought they was tough
Pull the face off the Scottish Terrier, the merrier

Just milk and PediaLite, with pedia hype
Pullin bowls from the under the sink
Climb out the crib and smack you if you turn out the light
Pour my apple juice all over your DAT
And pee on top of your Neumann mic
My babysitter ain't home, I'ma show you my ass tonight
Get into the department store, with other kids Kay*Bee Toys
Old people, they can't catch us
We gotta run fast tonight
Don't let me do this at the worst tonight
A tantrum jackass I curse at you, bubblegum packed
In my mouth like a baseball player
Puttin lollipops in the DVD machine
I work at upsettin, follow me around the house


Crawl across your face, to vomit on your neck
My bib is gone, I get atomic on your neck
Slobber on your forehead
Cut the lights off, I still won't go to bed
You can't figure it out
The day when when I pulled out the pots and pans
For super talent and secret skill
You never find out, how I got out the playpen
Spit Carnation, your black pants again
I'm worser than Ken
I'll punch him in the stomach and he's 10
Other children walkin away
Don't have to be my friend

For one mile then, walkin out the arena doors

Stopping the madness with the, pen in my hand
I've got to, fight the hardness pressin against the
Tender softness of my, actions, jewels falling down from my mind
Bonded to the paper like, coal on the pavement
Creating impressions like, concrete handprints in your chest
I won't rest 'til I attest to the true test
Political serial killers tryin to sabotage my talent, with such violence
Ideals that are beyond this realm of, physical reality
I catapult my, energies like a remedy to all who seek my identity
Straight from the heart, I play my part as a, golden lady from Haiti
Praying daily to combat the crazy who try to keep us, lazy

Shittin inside the rim
Harming that basketball
Turning 6 & 7 times in the air
Just going up on motherfuckers
Let me slip the balls
While i’m just cuffin that ball
Just going in strong with dunks
You know, with sneakers on
Just going to the key
Getting inside the paint
Just jumpin
Just leaping like 80, 7000 ft
Of air on these motherfuckers
Showing em that ability

Walkin' up into people's houses wearin' king crowns

The Promoter,UnKnown,UnKnown,"The rap game has changed
You got four different types of promoters
The luxury promoter, the hustler promoter, and the alternative promoter
Of course the roach promoter
The luxury promoter is basically the top pop promoter
He'll book Neil Diamond, fly a 20-piece band overseas
Take out stadium insurance, pay artists three hundred thousand
Four half months ahead, with no problem
Run advertisements on Billboard, TV
Usually teamed up with big investors who write checks
The hustler promoter, he's as good as the little bit
For the luxury for the ghetto celeb treatment
Usually book acts to prove he can do it, the hustler promoter
He'll make you feel like a big star
At home whether he's a pimp, drug dealer, gambler
He'll supply the best treatment, money up front
Paper bag ten to fifty grand cash, limo to and from
Five star hotel, he'll even include girls
He'll take you to dinner and chaffeur around his hood
Let you see how he's livin, not a hater
If he had a girl cousin he'd even let you meet her, THUMBS UP~!
Jacuzzi and everything, big radio advertisement
The alternative promoter uses weeklies and internet
Is a little strict, scared to spend, usually out of billions
The ones that do raves, go out baller style
Brand new clubs, new mics, also travel to and from
But others messed it up so it don't drop the same
Has sense to crease, they cuttin it
They also cut into the rap game for low prices on artists
The hustler promoter already treated well, sometimes tricky
The roach promoter, wants you to pay your own travel
Does not even have SHIT together, no transportation
Runner, a small cheap venue, usually holes in the wall
Don't have a liquor license
Wants to book you, with 20 acts for five hundred bucks
Still uses flyers in Motel 6's, and Travelodges
When you see a guy with a tiny Volkswagen goin back and forth
Pickin up a known artist up, from the airport

And I wrote motherfuckin’ MF DOOM
That was one of the motherfuckin’ movies that took the time by storm
That’s all me, fuck that
And of course, you know
There’s a lot of other little independent motherfuckin' movies I wrote a long time ago, like Rawkus
They had about eighteen million motherfuckers that sounded like me
A lot of cloned Sir Menelik

Spiral dunk, with Erica take a dump
Your man on a skateboard gon’ think my shit is German funk
Watch your baddest bitch shit a big chunk
Leave a white stripe on the ass like a black skunk
The kids call ‘em drunk unc’
They vocals and music sound pussy like a pump
Regional doo doo
You constipated with a Tampax between your boo boo
None of you can fuck with the pressure of leakage in your draws
Got you searchin’ for bathrooms on tours
Fuck what you did earlier, what the fuck you doin’ now?
My lyrics stain all over you
You see the spots on the cow?
Grade A meat, if you got a tiger to come get it I’ll put a tough steak out on the street
Melt that shit around your face down
With factory heat
Backpack your shit up then back out
You can’t compete
The phantom got ‘em lookin’ like a bitch behind the curtains, feelin’ elite
Caffeined up, these guys, they tea-sweet Cherokee, lookin’ for Bigfoot
Y’all scared to get out, your woman took a shit in the Jeep
That’s what she get for trying to sit in the hot seat
Never respected a bitch sleepin’ with a nigga that smell like corn-cheese-feet
Nasty motherfucker
Girls don’t like me ‘cause I use a rubber
Fuck you, asshole
I’m not that don’t-take-a-bath brother
Keep the underarms with deodorant under
Watch them black-ass tights under them jeans, that like a sundress
Watch you smell like fish and shit this summer
Back up in the parking lot with Barney face on the hood, the green trim on the purple hummer
Xbox built in the dash, women break out mad, I put a condom on to fuck my cash
Built up all my public announcement shit
My style is a movie flick
Like me filmin’ lactose out your tit
Abuse your confidence ’til you quit
Put some salve on that kankus on your lip
Get on your computer and grab a washcloth for your foggy forehead
Grab that natural organic, then wipe it off
I can tell you’re a bitch with draws, with a plad tablecloth
A chipmunk with cat manure in his draws
Salmonella sweatin’ through his pores
Red carpet dickheads better respect my laws
Don’t get shit of mines twisted with yours
But get his piss in the dude’s face like George
Simple Simon catch, your bitch wanna have an org’
But you think you’re better than the Bible, you’re a fucking lord

Jock strap nice, they match the white ties
Lou 
The mob warehouse, why you think the truck come to pick up more bologna
Stella 
Front a hundred thousand mil', let you up and comers develop street cred
I'm sleeping on you like that force field around the bed
Silver Surfer, your girl like my balls
They turn colors, now they burgundy
IPhone, laby, I like the way your wife worry me
I'm a regulator, I keep my hair cut low-key like Warren G
Versace's, get out the green Porsche
You know I'm blind, I can't see
Using my stick to walk past MC's
I'm Donny Microphonse, tonight, I'm hitting your Amazon
Ballroom, baby, no problem, I brought Hammerstein

Hammerstein, Carnegie Hall, Radio City
Madison Square, the Barclay Center, it's all mine
Hammerstein, Carnegie Hall, Radio City
Madison Square, the Barclay Center, it's all mine
Paradise

New York is a sport
MVP, but I stay out the court
, Range Rover horse
240 on the horse next to the bricks, young gunner to the boss
I'm a metropolitan nigga, check my politic, nigga, I'm a politic, nigga
Money and the power, , yay and the keys to the city
Box seats, and my Yankee fitted, chicken box, get it
Roof off, titties spillin out cause the milk all in it
So soft, seats to the benches
Love to perforate it, let the pussy breathe in it
My reflection on the hood, your reflection on the dishes
No pork, don't talk, nigga, stop snitching
Shot clock, white chalk, overtime, finished


I'm bad religion, death in jewels
Sacrilegious, gorilla monsoon
Indigenous to the dark, I live on your fear and remain in your thoughts
Blackburn necklace, keep bitches caught up
Battle of the sexes, more for the slaughter
Hey, 2 15's in the  the water
Uptown, Harlem World, Rich Porter
Smack bitches with the dick, hit niggas with the mortar
Mylar zip, ounces and quarters
Wear a disguise, so I don't get caught
Eyes without a face, no reflection
On the highway to hell or the staircase to heaven
Living in the past, sleepwalking in the present


Everyday's a show, real life, no gimmick
Money over hoes, I'm 'bout that business
We straight wilding, like juvies on the island
Caged up, so raise up, before I light the stage up
Take caution to what I say
Get with it, or get turned the fuck away
Swift with the gift when I'm dropping my shit
I do shows, collect dough, grab a ho, and then split
I smoke that raw shit, you smoke that if
I'm talking Denver nuggets, Portland dog shit
Straight to the brain, spliffs make me sane
Bitches give me brain to gain some fame
Libido's the name, the FCC6 to blame
Cause I came to rearrange the game, with the spoken bar flow
Haters copy, want to be me
Come out and see me and realize it ain't easy",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-paradise-lyrics

Is she cheating on me? She might be beating on me
Help me Lord, have mercy, can you set me free?
Cause I'm really so depressed and I can't decide
If I wanna see tomorrow, I'm thinking suicide
Cause I'm a poor kid, bastard case and my life is a waste

Reports say I've been to Bellevue, sources read
I practice voodoo, tell me assholes
What you assume is true
Investigate all myths 'til you turn blue
The haunted pages you turn to
The New York City vampire bat to fly neighbors
Wanna know what Dracula do
Bite the neck of the horse in the Bronx Zoo
Nights are creepy when I walk through
All resume when I face the full moon
I howl with wolves (aroo) a golden robe, made in June
African doctors talk and meet me in my room
Fog on the 1 train, the fossils of the Black Lagoon
Listen to {?} whom, castin spells in Manhattan
Burn your medicine at night with my magic broom
Eyes behind my head scientific chemicals
Girls pray to third room, with perfume
Operation wild palm reader with Western Union checks
Sippin scotch with Actifed

Allergies and salaries

You won't stop the night walker with oil lamps on Broadway
Black london fog coats in the broad day
These red and white Nikes, two shopping bags from Dr. J
Facebook call collect ya
I trade you Alex with droogies from Willie Mays~!
Women move out my way, on they Stay Free days

Raw like The Wire, minus all the pleasantry

Got niggas that's dead and the ones that's alive

Fly since the days of running 'em, Keith'n 'em
Christen 'em, teaching 'em

 wearing the unseen alligator vests
I'll lay alligators to rest, I lean with the El Dorado

Maximillion, ask the kings about the Don
The kufi on the 5 Percenter
Sitting in the back of the GMC limo, they call me Hasan
My neighbors cooking that Italian pastram'
My boss Cici's a  a brand-new arm
From Guam, rappers keep hair growing in their palms

Come down to Earth
And she's my queen
Queen home cooking beans
She makes the food I like
She cooks with stainless steel
And all the pots she burns
She's bringing me llama
Mashed potatoes
And serving me like a waiter
She's a good black woman
Or she could be a white girl
Maybe even Chinese
She works hard at night
Scrubbing my knees
Me and her, in the shower
Making all kinds of love
While my African brother plays the bongos
I talk about the game
Me and her, playing chess at night
Sitting on the love seat
I reach for the cloud
I put my hat on
I look like McCloud
And then I turned on the TV
We got so easy
We started to watch The Purple Dragon
She made some good popcorn
We started watching Barney
He came out with Bebop
And this is life, we got down
Cause she's my baby, my love
We went on vacation
We went camping last night
Down to the Poconos
I bought that cereal with the commercial
Toucan Sam
Follow your nose
Get down under the covers
I did it my way
She can be anybody she wants
She wore a dashiki
We went to Africa
I bought her some big earrings
She got a bone in her nose, baby
I took her up to Silvia's, 125th street",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-good-black-woman-lyrics

First cousin to chingo bling, you see d chingo ring
I’m rippin d smithereens, takin d yard, I come with crochard for d US Marines
My commander uniforms I pissed in it, why you think I’m usin the washin machine

Engine on check, VIP on check, girls is on check(reptile!)

My demeanor is devious, I’m a dark crease
Y’all niggas delirious tryna pray for me
I’m sociopathic I let the beast free
I hunt like a savage I want fresh meat
I think I got issues I think I need a shrink
I know I’m a alcoholic so I need a drink
Sometimes I think that I’m special, shit I’m full of dreams
The only thing I’m good at is selling crack to d fleet
I’m jaded, I’m ported, don’t drink d water
One of the 7 seals break me an witness slaughter
I’m d pimp that’s responsible for whoring yo daughter
But I’m a rebel so I hate new world order
Call me crazy, you probably right
Look in ma eyes, they say genocide
I hate everything, I want blackness
Killer Chink, I come wit kill tactics

The Legend of Tashan Dorrsett (Prelude),The Legend of Tashan Dorrsett,UnKnown,"In a world, led by corruption
Economic crisis is bringing mankind to his darkest side
In these times of struggle, betrayal
And unlimited wackness, stands a hero
A king without a crown who vowed to use his amazing abilities
To protect his fellow man, art, and culture
Tashan Dorrsett with a reputation for being genuine and respectable
Is representing the reality from New York City
Dealing with daily life situations
The essence of urban living to its all time fullest
Block after block, brick buildings, the hot sun
Bronx's most thrilling MC is walking through the ghetto
Facing struggles, and fighting against evil forces
Who are attempting to kill creativity
Divide the community, and crush freedom
He decided to raise an army of his time
Delivering lyrical ammunition
And spitting game wisdom, over deadly beats
Kool Keith, a/k/a Tasha Dorrsett
Marley Marl, TR Love, Domingo, The Cartel
Junkaz Lou, Agallah Don Bishop, and the mystery
Voodoo lord known as Big Sche Eastwood
They've gathered, to protect Earth's finest gem
Hip-Hop's mightiest heroes united against a common thread
On that day the legend of Tashan Dorrsett was born",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-the-legend-of-tashan-dorrsett-prelude-lyrics

Exhaust pipes burn the hair off your chest
Brim over my head, cocked to the side like El. Ness
Chicago chronicle, move with Elvis
With Jaycee and Will, I'm bound to get ill
Hit the P-day Parade, my daily brigade
Cooler than that glass nigga dressed up like a jar of Kool-Aid
I'm too fade
I'm cuttin your fame down to miniature size with two blades
I'm not out for fun, we don't have time to stargaze
Me and Ollie light up the street like Dr. Spocky
Girls hang on the jockey
It's all c'est la vie, well c'est la C
Two minutes to go

It's the international connection
We makin hip-hop perfection
It's Ultramag and Junkadelic dawg
We about to teach the whole world a lesson
About how to rap, how to make beats
How to walk, and how to even speak
And if you learned your lesson right
You'd be at the top of this game
You'd get all the shine you want, you'd get fame
Oh yeah son, I guess it's time for Ced to go
So let me hear this track, oh yeah dawg, I like that flow
So I'm about to bless you with 16, just like a pro
You know how I gets down, I keeps it real simple
The swagger's incredible; son I always smash my foes
Son, I'm always, smashin hoes
Son, I'm always, collectin dough
So if you see me up in Harlem, don't even think about it
Cause me and my faction squad son, we bout it bout it
We take care of our business; beef, we don't forget about it
We squash your whole team, your whole squad get routed
It's like that in my hood dawg, don't even doubt it

(Junkadelic) I smoke Newports, don't fuck with Marlboros
I'm tryin to be in the streets, see the Marlboro
You don't understand you gotta live with the borough
Stand still nigga wanna act like he thorough
Missed his vertabrae when I sprayed ten times
And buckin, niggas askin questions like they still duckin
The bug is filled with brains and cranium cracked
Never did give a fuck if the stadium cracked
I understand that's how you feel whenever you get jacked
But we still on the track, Ultra, Magnetic
Niggas is askin questions but I'm just so pragmatic
Mathematic, sometimes I gotta come back on the beat
With two times five divided by pi you see

I'm finished workin on the project already
The hype prolonged it, you couldn't handle the deadline
Your team wasn't ready, you tried a pop direction
That wasn't yo' section
We looked over your chorus and yo' rap bars
Analyzed your music, those happy-ass keys
Made you softer than ever, rap some more you should never
I decided to listen, I turned the music off
Becaue the melodies were cotton candy, the music was soft
I heard too much pantyliner stuff
Too much model and whack-ass designer stuff, no masculine touch
Adolescent, let the guy know his tracks is whack
He won't be back
Disrespect yo' production, producer credits
Receive the B stain on the form
Now face the two inch, reel gettin warm
Drop the top of your head
Drum machine gets smacked up beside your face
With a six-pack of beer
I urinate on you Pro Tools mix in your ear
Yellow hats wearin construction gear
Tear down the knobs, off the manly
Set the focus right on fire
You better call the cops and hide behind the Stanley
Studio booked up, New York power play, Unique tried to ban me
Type of guy to bring Texaco gas in the vocal booth
Light a match, burn up your whole family
You're just a big talker, you're not a man to me
Pulled the wires out the back of the amp
Defecate on your drum pads with a maxi
Brown sheepskin, black execution mask
Brass out your Yamaha speakers, shotgun I missed three
Other speakers I got one, with great danes, chewin out your amps
You won't be able to duck for long, seen niggas in summer camp
With men-e-strual cramps
Watch the black afro in the corner with the Huggies
With the diaper rash around your pelvis
Drivin a green Volkswagen buggy, you know Muggy
7 foot 7 orangutang baboon face
From Baltimore, Maryland notorious comin up the turnpike
To move your SSL board out to Richmond, Tony Pissman
In the stationwagon, your engineer's scared to mix the record
Down, next to my cousin Bucky
Just eight other computers destroyed
The B-room is still there, your clients are lucky",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-iraqi-verse-lyrics

Take a piss in the galaxy
When I shit in orbit off the planets
These peasants wipe my ass for me
They talk shit on satellite radio
They triple passes with braces around their kneecaps that can't rap to me
I take a shit on your wife and defecate in your odyssey
With a patch on my shirt
That says Black Cock, I show my ass
'cause I'm a top chief commander
Watch your model chick grab tissue
After she take a dump in New York
Nobody fucks with me, I stop everything
Smack the referee
And let the dogs, barking, shit on the basketball court

Come out my fist

Radiation destroyer powers
Leaving Captain America slumped over the toilet
With the shits
The transformers break down into mechanical bits
Robots lick my dick with tits
The X-Men and Storm say I'm sick
Bitches cream cause I smack the shit out of the Wolverine
.357 magnum, looking for everybody who's not on my liberty leisure team
Fuck the niggers over there
Looking at me with the Incredible Hulk scheme
They will increase my power packs
Boost me to be more mean

With a truck full of gasoline

Your Dodge Ram 3000 fought against the war and break it
Take a step to fuck up your rep, I guarantee you, bitch
The energy in your toothpick legs - you won't make it
While them basic ass niggas around you fake it
I gave you instructions to read before you was created
Now you're spittin' megayears behind
World premiering bullshit records that sound outdated
Acquired from the timberwolves from Megatron
That's why I was traded

Aerodynamic shut down your forces
All panels and the buttons in your forehead is upgraded

Down South to North Cakalakie, whack negro, don't talk~!

You can't mack G, you can't act B, move out get off the D
Watch the open toilet, aim the pee
Y'all play tight D, who's the man? One monkey
Y'all tryin to copy nobody want it sloppy
I roll with real guys, and then barely enough gas
I roll up in a jalopy, you don't want it

Lyrical magical flows, to' it fro from my vocals

Livin in the darkness, you have eyes but you can't see
You have ears but you don't understand

You superficial people clones of the media
Blindin fools, you're gonna lose, you do what you wanna do
You think this world is gonna last? No one cares about your ass
No one cares about your Mark Jacobs watch or your Versace bag
Because in the end you're the fool who made that man's account fat
Stop trippin on your, material goods
That Moss can rot, rust covers with dust, treasures that thieves can steal
Today I'm in your ear like a camel goin through the eye of a needle
You'll never fit, because you're still trickin tricks
They got you locked down in a debt control boot
Can't pay cash for all those Santa Claus goodies you got on Fifth Avenue

Looking out the binoc's with some customer Ver socks
With my JVC box, catch you spill out, then spill out
Rolling around with chill out, girls sleeping on pillows
Looking out tinted windows, people flossing in rentals
I chew 'em like Mentos, burning up instrumentals
Boosting credentials, stopping rappers potentials
Crashing parties with cymbals, freaking broads with pimples
Taking pictures of breasts, going to dinner with bimbos
Turning rappers to embryo's
Subway sandwiches, who want to play heroes

Non stop from hopscotch and Pop Rocks
Foul coming out of my mouth like I'm a shock jock

Swishing on you boys, all net, watch the shot clock
Do the Foxtrot all on your snot box
Drop a load on 'em like plop-plop
See, I could go on for eternity, non stop, the journey be

The constant aggression ever since adolescence

How I define how I live my life is different than yours
I write the present prophecies, I wasn't seekin awards
I was the four corner chief, ""Off the Wall"" like one glove
Puff piff, be out like Whodini with ""One Love""
I'm out to conquer the world, plan to live prosperous
Plant seeds on one Earth, and live monogomous
Strive for perfection, two steps forward and three back
Skatin on these devils but they aimin at my kneecaps
I formulate the proper procedure, my flow is fever
I mortally wound, and conversate out with wild goons
I silence your camp like boy he's at Crystal Lake
Watch positive flip, now they set off for easy bake
Fourth quarter score, you niggas a court order away
From eviction out the PJ's
Now I'ma maintain, relax, kick facts about black kings
And queens who pull string; that's how the team bring home cream

Big terror alert~! I shitted in your white Louis Vuitton bag
My piss stains'll cover up the dashboard
I wipe my ass on your armrest

Of your man's Jag
Tough stains nigga you need detergent
Ask your girl for a rag
Spot stain remover
Go ahead clean behind your back seat with a pooper scooper
Fly bitches, pick up my shit on the windows
It's all brown stuff I stick up
With my shit before I hit the car wash and flip
What's that on the straw? Be careful motherfucker
You see you got shit on your lips
You fuckin with a guy walkin around with shorts on
With army and a t-shirt, yeah, bustin out three clips

The Promoters,The Commi$$ioner,UnKnown,"The rap game has changed
You got four different types of promoters
The luxury promoter, the hustler promoter, and the alternative promoter
Of course the roach promoter
The luxury promoter is basically the top pop promoter
He'll book Neil Diamond, fly a 20-piece band overseas
Take out stadium insurance, pay artists three hundred thousand
Four half months ahead, with no problem
Run advertisements on Billboard, TV
Usually teamed up with big investors who write checks
The hustler promoter, he's as good as the little bit
For the luxury for the ghetto celeb treatment
Usually book acts to prove he can do it, the hustler promoter
He'll make you feel like a big star
At home whether he's a pimp, drug dealer, gambler
He'll supply the best treatment, money up front
Paper bag ten to fifty grand cash, limo to and from
Five star hotel, he'll even include girls
He'll take you to dinner and chaffeur around his hood
Let you see how he's livin, not a hater
If he had a girl cousin he'd even let you meet her, THUMBS UP~!
Jacuzzi and everything, big radio advertisement
The alternative promoter uses weeklies and internet
Is a little strict, scared to spend, usually out of billions
The ones that do raves, go out baller style
Brand new clubs, new mics, also travel to and from
But others messed it up so it don't drop the same
Has sense to crease, they cuttin it
They also cut into the rap game for low prices on artists
The hustler promoter already treated well, sometimes tricky
The roach promoter, wants you to pay your own travel
Does not even have SHIT together, no transportation
Runner, a small cheap venue, usually holes in the wall
Don't have a liquor license
Wants to book you, with 20 acts for five hundred bucks
Still uses flyers in Motel 6's, and Travelodges
When you see a guy with a tiny Volkswagen goin back and forth
Pickin up a known artist up, from the airport
Most of the time a rejected whack rapper don't fuck with 'em!",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-the-promoters-lyrics

With no underwear, prepare for the Phantom
With yo big eyes ha huh ha huh, yeah
As I lyrical flip my body never wear underwear
Girls stare, I pluck in they public hair
The masquerade I'm crazy with a switch blade

I love Cal Can, ""Roof!"", can a dog bark
I'll bite ya girl make a women catch rabies
Then eat Gerber from a jar like the babies
I like cereal, yo you Cap'n Crunch
Juggle my jellybeans, yo captain munch
I like roach spray mixed in my gin and juice

As I masturbate every time about 8
The last time I masturbated through the earthquake
I saw your picture girl Shirley Temple Jheri Curl
You walk around through a toilet and a do do world
I know the spokes are white a green Cadillac
Polka dot grey I'm satisfied I won't take it back
I need the mustard from the Whataburger
I spell it backwards I take my girl to King Burger
You better rush on in an order fries
Before I get mad and start peein' in your eyes

With mexican beans collard greens I respect 'em
You hold the apples while girls pull they pants down
I got a bottles of flies I'm throwin' ants down
Like Joe said one time I'm drinkin' straight rum
Chewin' they embryo, actin' like it's bubble gum
I get inside, bark and crank the truck
Cruz up the highway, you out there you stuck
You ain't the one I got no cables no goose
Look in the back I got no room, see my moose
I better hide what's left at 7 Eleven
Call the Ranger, the Phantom at 11
He got black boots and stains on my turtle-neck
My mink is yellow and tan female birds peck
I got no rags to clean I love the vomit
It makes me sexy, my underwear atomic
You smell the rose, I'm smellin' cookin' flower
I call your house and let it ring for an hour
I got to clean up my house set the mouse traps
I know one he's grey and cool and the mouse raps
I seen 'em seen 'em I seen 'em through peripheral vision
I look around the corner and see your big eyes

One time
I bust rhymes
Wicked, wick it, then I stick it stick it
People say I'm so smooth when I come down
And groove on, off the beat
With the style that I choose
And loose and then abuse many
Then turn, take out plenty
That try to take my
But they can't move as I fake a

On the beat with the style that I kick
They know I'm smooth smooth, hype hype and dope dope
I switch switch my style up, I come and I... no no
You can't do this, the style better back up kid
You don't know the style that I used to audit
When I say, when I play, when I come smooth
I come right into that groove
I spin around like a record on a thirty-three
I come around 'cause I know that I'm a funky MC
From here, to New York, to Stanford, Connecticut
I wreck with others down to San Francisco, 
Look at the style as I rock and flaunt, kick through the promo
Vicious, I come professional
Without no question like Kane said, superb
I'm smokin' more herb as I get with the derb and serve many
And plenty, and take out others and any
Rappers know me, but they can't show me no style
They booty when they smile, but they try to step to me
They butter, I get smooth, I reck to the others
They can't say they got no rep on me
When they try to step to my style, I smile
But they know I walk and walk, and talk in offbeat style style
I kick it wicked, the funky hypo doper, super, superb, nice
Smooth, offbeat and on any type of beat that you try to get on hype of
But you can't take my style and choose the type of
Lyrics I choose for you schools
My students out there trying to learn from me
You get burned by me
As I wreck it, I spin like you get turned by me
But you can't say nothing, but only get referred by me
To my distant sound, go round for round
Pound for pound, MC's drop down
Look like the eyes - tears of a clown
But they all know my style, I come and I talk  like president
I come from here, styles kick, yeah
You try to get wicked wicked
I stop stop, I flex flex, I flaunt flaunt, I show show
Yeah, I get smooth but not old like Kurtis Blow Blow
I know my style
You know it, wait a while, standin' on the side
Like a refugee, trying to get with me
Trying to move and trying to get slick with me
But you can't cope, or even stick with me
My style, off the top of my head, no rhymes pre-written
Or bitten
From another man
Your brother man
The crew, the kid, they trying to rock from
The lover land
You better go back and choose from your whole crew another plan
To try to get with, or stick with, you're like water, lick with
Can't move, or try to get with
My style, any type of rhyme
Hyper offbeat, different type of
I shoot MC's like a sniper
When I grow, they like soft, like Peter the Piper
I rhyme off, I flow, show many that I'm professional
With, you can't do this, or try to get through this
I'm used to this when you can't, or try
Or try to get good with this
My style, you can't- or try- even- or shit with this
I come and twist many

Don't worry, about them bills

All those worries in your head
You know you have the strength to forget about the rest
All those bills is what's causing you all that stress
You know you have the power to go beyond the mess
Master yourself, take that test drive
See your way out that negative path
Dark pattern, unfair weak voices in your head
Life is full of pleasure, take your measure, forget about the weather
Better days are straight ahead


Put that cigarette away, chokin your life away
All that fear won't help you steer your way
Desires overpowering you, take a bubble bath
A long walk at the park, every problem has a solution
Don't go to those fake card readers about the future
They are far worse than you are, with no conclusion to their confusion
Dark spirits, leading you the wrong way
Someday everything will be okay, trust yourself one day
See how power manifests, to relieve stress

I don't wanna worry about the bills; let your hair out, and play
I don't wanna worry about the bills; take your car out, and chill
I don't wanna worry about the bills; forgot those bills and enjoy your life

Don't stress yourself, the bills are paid
I cashed my check, foodstamps ready Reggie carry the bags
Spaghetti today, spaghetti to play
Mom cooked tonight, mom hooked it up tonight
Lima beans, biscuits, Fazola butter
Five dollars a basket, Apple Jacks
Don't make no jokes, apple cracks
Minimum to the max
Oats and wheats, grits and beets, candy and treats
Popsicles for the kids, Neopolitan brightest
Hot dogs, mustard, Oscar Mayers, big letters too

I’m a skinhead walking around with a Black leather jacket
A black dog losing his hair cause his tail is wagging
Got the coat long to the floor
Garlic from pizza coming through my pores
My girl work in a hearse
She shows people on funeral tours
Cook tahini at night in a nightgown
For handicap nigga that’s stay over the house
You wear hospital alertness trousers
Wait for him to cash that goddamn check
He got disability power
He dance with one leg, with crutches in the shower
He’s a beast in the projects the kids love him
The cops bug him
Cats they try to mug him
Amputated arms
He played drums with no arms
Holding sticks with nubs
Kids say “Mommy where his fingers got cut off”


Slick wid it
Amazons and bangers and lizards
Bunting your crew, pick twizzlers
Long legged thingy broads with Day’o with the Stars
It’s persistent
Fall out the gang
Lose every digit
Moschino misfits
Sweaters from Bally's in Switzerland
Disappear in Thailand
Find me with 30 freaks in a hotel missing
I feel more about different bitches
Different attitudes
Slip silk, flip the angle
How I planned it
Have the game choked out and strangled
Until you not stressing to comprehend my mission
Nigga I switch up and replace you with a meatball Italian broad
Draped and collecting again
Keith it true the flow about the wheelchair
I feel for exquisite women, diva perfume and pretty hair
And eyes like flares
Gucci girl
Maybelline eyeshadow
Full body wax and
Elizabeth Arden mascaro
Get my attention, don’t be fooled
Your toe ring could incite me and make me drool
I’m disgusted to the nature
I’m a male chauvinist, the best alpha male

Smokin a lot of weed with the Four Tops
Makin collect calls back home to my pops

I knew something was wrong
When I gave away my VHS and sold a pair of my socks

I was in the room sweatin thinkin about the rent playin bingo
The landlord said the first of the month, we gotta go
Packed up my bag and met Darryl Strawberry in the mall
I told James Brown stop smokin angel dust and the pis-tal
He wanted to go up to the Olive Garden and start a resteraunt brawl
""Mary J. Blige, my son don't accept them type of phone calls""

The porch monkey who's originally corporate flunkies
Work in the modern field for Hebrew money
That content pickers balance content on their heads
And get bigger
Pull up on a white horse street team
Every house got a house wigga
Make him wash the donkeys
And wipe em down with water
Increase the apathetically forward
Society import gorillas through the evolution
Who walk awkward
Bring back the wrong orders
Straw hat tobacco pullers who moves like caterpillars
Marcus Garvey Jr. add they two cents in right album pillars
Full of community selfish impurities
But now they too much gingerbread man
Please consult to me
Compel against negatives speeches
With no velocity
It's like a gypsy Terry Car beater
Getting off telling false prophecies
Satan put em more spark ya plugs
To deceive you let em increase the speed
Sprinkle salty ones like holy water
Some sound like mourners
(Chorus)
Blast!
So I blast and I blast
So I blast no mo!
(x4)
Observe you watching TV on a lazy boy
Fools texting back and forth cause that's that what they do seven days a week
Without a place to lay down and a vocals to speak
A lot of people lolligaging at home looking pig feet
I'm a artist that write soldiers stink
Many wanna mingle be pop like pink take rappers and feed em to flies
The hungry with hot licks
Ya'll gon' mess around once I go come around and spot me in the mix
With a bad brothers in the NBA see pay your bills for grill cheese
Why would you thong tease
I can see your baby girl flossing with fake titties
Home quarter advantage I keep a basket ball in every city
The hair around my pride trip pretty
Sean Elliot sipping Don P with Missy
A lot of people not doing business don't miss me
They chasing the star that don't care about them
Tinted with dark windows rolled up in the Bently
They treat him like a dog Spot McKenzie
I been looking down from high places
Don't be Bougie with the face lift
Do not be Bougie with the face lift
(Chorus)
So I...
Blast!
So I blast and I blast
So I blast no mo'

You see the Lambo convert into a top-off
Two doors rise up
My dashboard look like a Novation keyboard
I'm on the E-channel of my spectrum
You welcome to come in and watch a few lions roar
Night shift, your chick show pink to a real commodore
Your mom hoppin' out with the mink in Bentley and soar
Sendin' your girl with suspensories and drawers
Notice how I sketch and draw
The Cadillac got me driving, scuba-diving
Like Andre Rison, over the top with Jordans, unless you WNBA
I'm freakin' out with the Sparks
The Christian Dior with Prada silk pyjamas
For the hot mamas, the bottles pop proper
With Sasha, new Frank Sinatra at the Oscars
Medicated doctors, she takin' me shoppin'
After the Phantom and the Opera
Got a contract with Hannah Barbara
You hired with a few millions, playing possum
The head game she got is amazing, awesome
I can't believe he's still unapproachable
And too serious, the monkey never blossom
Never learned from his father
Cruise up to the Brookes Brothers
Get some shirts with the four-door McLaren and don't bother

You been out the game since the movie The Omen
Make you turn around like the girl in Exorcist
The priest come by the bed naked, give you necklaces
A real ghost sit in your Phantom Ghost
Eat grapes and cantaloupes
Your mom play second base like Davey Lopes
All-white shoes like the Pope's
No storm coat made by COACH
Ate in the restaurant, never eat with a roach
My juice I like with a lot of pulp
You go to crack spots, get crack by the bulk
Smoke 'til you thin

Drugs (version X),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Back in the 70's, it was all about drugs..)
Tie my arm up at night between shows
Takin soda tops off of soda pops
I used to be up all night in the living room
Smokin a lot of weed with the Four Tops
Makin collect calls back home to my pops
My little brother said, ""Keith - you need to stop!""
I knew something was wrong
When I gave away my VHS and sold a pair of my socks
The IRS callin me, gettin on my nerve, I was warned by Redd Foxx
My girl, ""Keith you seen my diamond rings in the jewelry box?""
I don't know; last night you and Chaka Khan was in here sniffin blow
I was in the room sweatin thinkin about the rent playin bingo
The landlord said the first of the month, we gotta go
Packed up my bag and met Darryl Strawberry in the mall
I told James Brown stop smokin angel dust and the pis-tal
He wanted to go up to the Olive Garden and start a resteraunt brawl
""Mary J. Blige, my son don't accept them type of phone calls""
I can't come out tonight, my Bic lighter don't light
I heard you and K-Ci in the background
I'm screamin did the cops come and break up the fight?
All the crack and the drugs, make me feel, the way I feel
All the crack and the drugs.. drugs..
All the crack and the drugs, make me feel, the way I feel
All the crack and the drugs..
Freebasin eighteen pounds of coke with Marvin Gaye
Put that on the table, let's parlay
With Smokey Robinson and Bootsy, lightin aluminum foil
Watch that crack pipe boil
With Richard Pryor we burned the house down gettin higher
Don't think I'm bluffin
Meet Tommy Lee Curtis, Keith Richards, Eddie Kingwards and David Ruffin
Rick James was in the kitchen lightin the flame
And Mousey's trapped with Cuba Gooding Sr
I don't want nobody to know my name
I kept glasses on it was a damn shame
Losin weight, fallin out in big arenas
The same guy who used to deal to me
Deals to Whitney and Bobby, meet Ike and Tina
Every Saturday mansions was packed, ""Hey Jimmy you got the smack?""
Shut up! You don't know how to act
All the crack and the drugs, make me feel, the way I feel
All the crack and the drugs.. drugs..
All the crack and the drugs, make me feel, the way I feel
All the crack and the drugs..
Crystal methane.. and heroin and quaaludes..
A relapse, of your mind
Angel dust, ecstasy, sniffin coke baby..
Got the best of me-heee-heeeee..
I got rits, withdrawals, my symptoms of pain
Rush me to the hosss-pi-tallll..
Oooh, ooh baby
Get this monkey off of MY MY MY BACK!
And get him off of me
Get the monkey off my BACK! Baby!
Get the monkey
And get the monkey off my back now..",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-drugs-version-x-lyrics
Break U Off (album version),UnKnown,UnKnown," + (Girl)
Yeah... I saw you (I see you too)
I peeped you out (oh you watchin me?)
I know where you go (no you don't)
I'm watchin you (so you say..)
(but, I'm watching you too..)

I love your sweet eyelashes, your darkskin flavor
Every morning going to school on the elevator
Soft and nicely, the girl entice me
Diamonds on her watch, she rock her ice B
With a North Face coat, apple bottom jeans
The El Dorado is smooth, when the mack leans
The President is there, the stars walkin on the scene
Tastes so good, her body like Krispy Kreme
Frequent a mask, it ain't even Halloween
(It ain't even Halloween)

Girl take it off, shake shake shake it off
Move your pom poms, bikinis and your panties off
Rub on the lotion, baby oil nice and soft
(Come here baby, I'ma break you off)

Don't get me wrong now, I like 'em blonde with long hair
They call me Sauvere, I like her underwear
She don't mind posin, she don't even care
I like her atmosphere, plus she's out there
The type of girl to break out, yo we outta here
House and closets, model with a lot of gear
She love to clown and pose, spread 'em on the chair
Talk on the rooftop, when she wanna feel some air
I know her secret phone, when she's leavin home
Her Benz is baby blue, convertible, trimmed with chrome


With a see-through nightgown, she got to be Spanish
Brassiere, baby come over here
The mamacita, lick the ice off her back when I freak her
She look Brazilian sometime, her face look unique-a
Shower when she dance in the go-go bar
- by the speaker
I excuse myself and let the man meet her
Family Lacosa, they call me Sosa
I hold the best wine up when I toast her, real extravagant
Better than gin, extreme dime straight from San Juan like a 10
Eight inch heels witcha pink shorts
Hey baby, when we gonna do this again?",https://genius.com/Kool-keith-break-u-off-album-version-lyrics

PS 53 classmate with Kenny Pound
The Cold Crush Brother, watching Cassanova Lover
The master flower, Keith Thornton, there's no other
My class over at three with Bronx MC's
The super imposer, cruisin on the major deacon
Quarts and blunts, sippin Olde E on the weekend
My girl Fatima, half black and Puerto Rican
I'm movin fast rate, Webster down to Bathgate
A lot of guys was good, but many came half weight
The comp got bad, the city came half rate
Think to the critics, I left them all in debate...

12 o'clock lunchtime, bangin on the school table
I was able more fatal to spin around like tornado
Catchin Batman & Robin, Green Hornet and Kato
The main attraction was Grandmaster Flash action
I tell brothers Mean Gene was with the L Brothers
Cordio Vex with Phase 2 drawin flyers
The crowd is fat, the people jumpin over wires
The 5 train runnin, the crew comin down from Dyer
Footline express, the last car but we don't fire
Schlitz malt liq', the P.A.L. gettin higher
With Union Ave up there, we used to watch stick-up kids
Go and laugh up there
(Chorus)

Cazal's in the place, girls peep my {?} feel
Fur on the collar, the German Shepherd feel real
Breakout and Baron, in the club, on the wheels of steel
Kool Herc in Cedar Park, echoes down the hill
Echo chamber, yes yes y'all
When B-1's was out, with the orange lights, where was y'all?
The Saigons, the Nomads, the Black Spades
Alexander's and Juman's was the real spot
Pro-Keds and Converse stayed real hot
Turtlenecks and shirts, AJ's and overlap
Stetson hats, bustin over mean raps

Work on your own style with the wrench and pliers

Turn into the Pied Piper

Everybody take care of theirself
With food fibre
No gossip
Stay off the line
Women movin' fine
No pictures with men
We do this again

You sound like you wanna go back to the Linn
Obscure, abstract
I never did that
That's for a baby wearin' baby-fat
People wanna get together
And scratch they ass and talk about way back
It's model time
Picture time
Your mind is on shoes from Floorsheim
