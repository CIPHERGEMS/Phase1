Wake Up Everybody,Wake Up!,2010.0,"Wake up everybody, no more sleeping in bed
No more backward thinking, time for thinking ahead
The world has changed so very much from what it used to be
There is so much hatred, war, and poverty

Wake up all the teachers, time to teach a new way
Maybe then they'll listen to what you have to say
Cause they're the ones who's coming up, and the world is in their hands
When you teach the children, teach them the very best you can

The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it, yeah, just you and me

Wake up all the doctors, make the old people well
They're the ones who suffer and who catch all the hell
But they don't have so very long before their Judgment Day
So won't you make them happy before they pass away

Wake up, all the builders time to build a new land
I know we can do it if we all lend a hand
The only thing we have to do is put it in our mind
Surely things will work out, cause they do every time

The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it, yeah, just you and me

It's the God hour, the morning I wake up
Just for the breath of life I thank my maker
My mom say I come from hustlers and shakers
My mind build-ed on skyscrapers and acres
He said take us back to where we belong
I try to write a song as sweet as the Psalms
Though I'm the type to bear arms and wear my heart on my sleeve
Even when I fell, in God I believe
Breathe the days in
Weave through the maze and the season so amazing
Feed them and raise them
Seasons are aging: earthquakes, wars, and rumors
I want us to get by but we're more then consumers
We're more than shooters, more than looters
Created in his image, so God live through us
And even in this generation living through computers
Only love, love, love can reboot us

Wake up, everybody
Wake up, everybody
Need a little help, y'all
Yes I do, need a little help
Need a little help, y'all ay
Wake up everybody
Wake up everybody
Wake up everybody",https://genius.com/John-legend-and-the-roots-wake-up-everybody-lyrics
Hard Times,Wake Up!,2010.0,"Yeah-yeah, ooohhhhhhhhh
So many hard times
Yea-yeahhhhhh, ooohhhhhhhhhh
Yeahhhh-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeahhhh
YEAHHHHH, yeah-yeah
YEAHHHHHHHHHH
Cold, cold eyes upon me they stare
People all around me and they're all in fear
They don't seem to want me but they won't admit
I must be some kind of creature up here having fits
From my 
party house
, 
I'm afraid to come outside
Although I'm filled with love, I'm afraid they'll hurt my pride
So I play the part I feel they want of me
And I pull the shades so I won't see them seeing me

Having hard times, in this crazy town
Having hard times, there's no love to be found

Having hard times, in this crazy town
Having hard times, there's no love to be found

Yeah, yeah, yeah
In my party house I feel like meeting others
Familiar faces, creed and race, a brother
But to my surprise I find a man corrupt
Although he be my brother, he wants to hold me up

Having hard times, in this crazy town
Having hard times, there's no love to be found

Having hard times, in this crazy town
Having hard times, there's no love to be found

Check it out, 
seventeen years and counting
Of tryna climb up the rough side of the mountain
Friends warned me I'mma have to do it without them
No problem really, it was never about them
So my house, I never come out from
Cause every day a drought, then a shadow of doubt come
I'm down to do whatever if it betters my outcome
The city's like the Audubon Ballroom waiting on Malcolm
Cause people wanna see my blood flow like fountains
I got nowhere to go and still feel like bouncing
I'm looking for the closest window I can rap from
Or for the highest speaker-box that I can shout from
And I'm hoping to feel like something is real
But it's no hope when you are but a spoke in a wheel
A brick in a wall, tryna find an opening still
Having hard times, tryna climb over the hill

Yeah, so many hard times, yeah, yeah
Sleeping on motel floors, yeah, yeah
Knocking on my brother's door
Eating Spam, Oreos
Drinking Thunderbird baby, yeaaaaaaahhhh

Having hard times, in this crazy town
Having hard times, there's no love to be found

Having hard times, in this crazy town
Having hard times, there's no love to be found

Having hard times, in this crazy town
Having hard times, there's no love to be found

Having hard times, in this crazy town
Having hard times, there's no love to be found

Yea-yeah, yea-yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeaaaahhh, yeah
Yeah, mmmmm, yeah, yeaaah
So many hard times, yeah, yeah
Sleeping on motel floors, yeah, yeah
Knocking on my brother's door
Eating Spam and Oreos
Drinking Thunderbird baby, ohhhhhhhhh, yeah
I don't wanna do it no more
No-no-no, no-no
I don't wanna go back there no more

Little Ghetto Boy,Wake Up!,2010.0,"My grandmother suits was tailor made, Sundays Mahalia played
Simple familiar ways, like how she kneeled and prayed
Wailin', master forgive us, our trust, pastors had us real afraid
I never listened yet I still obeyed
I got to see how Philly played at such an early age
What my father was into sent him to his early grave
Then moms started chasin that base, like Willie Mays
My childhood was all of 40 nights and 40 days
Trouble was my ball and chain, shorties would call me names
Humble beginnings but a star is what it all became
My journey from a dirty hallway, to the Hall of Fame
Music my therapeutic way to cope with all this pain
Was headed for the drain, soakin before the rainwater came
And chaos, into the order came
I started doin' what I'm 'sposed to do in life
Tryin to move out of the dark, and closer to the light
They say if you get a chance to do it, overdo it right
Tomorrow isn't promised every time, you say goodnight
Knahmtalkinabout? Uhh, yo
Story of a little ghetto boy, check it out

Yeah yeahhh
Little ghetto boy, ohhh
Playin in the ghetto street, ay-ayyyy!
What'chu gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility?
Yeah yeahhh
Will you spend your days and nights in a pool room?
Will you sell caps of madness, to the neighborhood
Little ghetto boy
You already know, how rough life could be
Hard to see, so much pain and misery
Yeahhhhhhh, yeahhhh
Little ghetto boy, yeah
Your daddy was blown away
Heyyyy yeahhh
He robbed that grocery store yeah
Don't you know that was a sad sad day?
Eyyyyy-yeah
All your young life you've seen such misery and pain
The world's a cruel place to live in, it ain't gonna change yeahh
You're so young, and you've got so far to goooooo
Don't think you'll reach your goal young man
Talkin 'bout the ghetto boy
Yeah yeah yeahhhh
Yeah, yeahhh little ghetto BOYYYYY-OYYYY
When when you become a maaaaan, yeahhhh
You can make things change
Oh if you just take a stand, yeah yeahhhh
You've got to believe in yourself, in all that you doooo
You've got to fight to make it better, better
And you will see, that others will start believin too
Then my son, things will start to get better
Hey yeahhhh yeah

Ohhh
Everything has got to get better
Yeahhh yeahhhhh yeah
Don't you know it's gonna get better

I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free,Wake Up!,2010,"I wish I knew how it would feel to be free
I wish I could break all the chains holding me
And I wish I could say all the things that I should say
Say 'em loud, say 'em clear for the whole world to hear
I wish I could share all the love that's in my heart
Remove all the bars that keep us apart
And I wish you could know what it means to be me
Then you'd see and agree that every man should be free
I wish I could give all I'm longing to give
And I wish I could live like I'm longing to live
And I wish I could do all the things that I can do
Though I'm way overdue I'd be starting to move
Well, I wish I could be like a bird up in the sky
How sweet it would be if I found I could fly
Well, I'd soar to the sun then I'd look down at the sea
Then I'd sing cause I'd know
Yes I'd, sing cause I'd know
Sing cause I know
I know how it'd feel, yeah
Yes I know how it'd feel

Our Generation (The Hope of the World),Wake Up!,2010.0,"Hope of the world is in our generation (let's straighten it out)
It's all left up to us, to change this present situation (let's straighten it out)
Take caution from our elders, don't make the same mistake (let's straighten it out)
Let's fill the world with love, and get rid of all the hate
Our elders taught us one thing but, practice another
Just look what happened to the Indian and the brother
(Straighten it out!) {*3X*}
Hope of the world is in our generation (let's straighten it out)
It's all left up to us, to change this present situation (let's straighten it out)
Our leaders make us fight, and we don't know what for (let's straighten it out)
If they want people killed, let them fight the war!
It's gotta end somewhere, this killing's got to cease
If no one were to fight, we'd all live in peace
Our generation (let's straighten it out)
It's all left up to us (let's straighten it out)

Gotta straighten it out! (Straighten it out)
Straighten it out! (Straighten it out)
Yeahhh we gon' straighten it out, yeahh!

As long as there's a you, there's a better me
It's why we're together and stronger than they ever thought it could be
A world motherless - can health care cover this?
A love for all people no matter what the culture is
Our generation, is makin huge strides
A self-empowering movement that's on the rise
The more the door is open, the more the youth can see
A fair chance means a greater opportunity
To have a brighter future, deeper insight
Work hard to be anything you want in life
It's what it's all about, the longevity
Educated enough to know what's ahead of me
Need to straighten it out, seek and you'll find
They can cage your body, but not your mind
We lay it all on the line in the struggle
We grew, but together here's what we gotta do

Our generation (let's straighten it out)
It's all left up to us (let's straighten it out)
Our generation (let's straighten it out)
Let's do just what we must, and straighten it out!

Our generation - straighten it out!
Let's straighten it out - and straighten it out!
Heyyyyyyyyy we can straighten it out, YEAHHH!
C'mon yeah! Our generation - let's straighten it out
Hey hey, we'll straighten it out
We'll straighten it out - straighten it out
New York City, better straighten it out
Atlanta, better straighten it out
In Los Angeles, you better straighten it out

Compared To What,Wake Up!,1969.0,"Love the lie and lie the love
Hangin' on, with a push and shove
Possession is the motivation
That is hangin' up the God-damn nation
Looks like we always end up in a rut

Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?

Slaughterhouse is killin' hogs
Twisted children killin' frogs
Poor dumb rednecks rollin' logs
While tired old ladies kissin' dogs
Hate the human, love that stinking mutt

Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?

The President, he's got his war
Folks don't know just what it's for
Nobody gives us rhyme or reason
Have one doubt, they call it treason
We're chicken-feathers, all without one gut

Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?

Church on Sunday, sleep and nod
Tryin' to duck the wrath of God
Preacher's fillin' us with fright
Tryin' to tell us what he thinks is right
He really got to be some kind of nut

Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?

Where's that bee and where's that honey?
Where's my God and where's my money
Unreal values, crass distortion
Unwed mothers need abortion
Kind of brings to mind ol' young King Tut (He did it now)

Hang on in There,Wake Up!,2010,"There ain't no time
No time for sorrow
And we ain't got time no time
Ah time to be sad
And maybe the world ain't what it could be
But to understand why is to know reality
Ah don't give in (hang on in there)
Ah I said hang on (hang on in there)
How many times did you hear your mom and daddy?
Say oh child I never had it so good
I wanna say thank you, thank you for the start
Cause deep in my soul, I know you did all that you could
I'm just a part of your dreams this I know
But I'll do what ever possible to make this thing grow
Ah don't give in (hang on in there)
I said hang on (hang on in there)
Ah now say tomorrow you woke up a king
Now tell me just how would you fix everything?
You walk around complaining about how things are
But what have you added to this world so far
Check out your mind, and see what the answer is
And tell me how much did you give
Ah don't give in (hang on in there)
I said hang on (hang on in there)
There are plenty of things still left to live for
A child, a friend, and a wife
They all want to share your life
Ain't that enough to make you want hang on
Hang on, hang on (hang on in there)
The sign said ""America love it or leave"" well has it really come to that?
And beside, I don't want to and you can't make me love
I've got too many friends, that have she'd their blood
I've got too many relatives here born on this land
So you can't make me leave
I say this is my county and you can't make me leave
You can't make me love the way you treat me
And you can't make me love the way you beat me
Hang on in there, I'm gonna hang on
No matter you do or what you say
Is just wanna let you know you can't drive me away
I'm gonna ay hang
I'm not gonna throw up my hand
I'm not gonna throw up my hand
Any you can't drive me from my home land
If the smog from the cars and so many live we have lost
Still no matter what I'm gonna hang on",https://genius.com/John-legend-and-the-roots-hang-on-in-there-lyrics

And yo' highest aspirations is a place, and a car

And he hurtin his Granny and she the only one he got
The hood so shady
You give up hope, of ever even tryin to find a sunny, spot-
-light, they caught him at the stop-
-light, but if he woulda run that yellow
Then he coulda, run the globe
But insteed, with speed
They put one in the middle of his frontal, lobe
Like a unicorn
I'm just tryin to keep you, informed
To my little ghetto soldiers in they, gold
Green, red, and blue uni-forms - chuuch!
But I'm feeling like the loneliest monk
So I pull me a Thelonius Monk and blew, the horn
And we don the monikers of goons and gangsters
And are trained to conduct ourselves true, to form
So we add a Shorty, a Money, a Mack
A Lil', a Eazy, or a Young to our name
So all the big ballers grab rims and hung, in the game
And there's a degree, of difficul-ty
To make it from the ghetto boy into the man-hood
Especially when you know that yo' fresh greens
Will help eliminated a canned, good
