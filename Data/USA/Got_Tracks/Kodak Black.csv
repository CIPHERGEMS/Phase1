Ayy, lil' Metro on that beat

Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, ""Boy, make good decisions""
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, ""Boy, make good decisions""
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
They sendin' all my homies on a mission
And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions

I jumped up out the Wraith, Kodak bought a Wraith
I get any girl I want, any girl I want
She want me to save the day, but I ain't got a cape
She wanna see me every day, she wanna be my bae
That money make me cum, it make me fornicate, uh
I'm the shit, I need some toilet pap-er
Follow my player rules, then we gon' be okay
On the real I need a bih' who gon' cooperate

Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, ""Boy, make good decisions""
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, ""Boy, make good decisions""
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
They sendin' all my homies on a mission
And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions

I told you niggas I'm gon' be that fuckin' nigga
Everything be good 'til you doin' better than 'em
They wanna see a nigga shot or see me in the system
All you niggas out here poison like snake venom
Codeine in my liver, rockin' Balenciaga denim
I'm booted even when I'm sober, I don't need a jigga
They sendin' all my niggas on a fuckin' journey
I told that baby to come over 'cause I'm fuckin' horny
My mama told me, ""Kill these niggas, son, keep it goin'!""
I'm thug to the bone, but I'm still her baby boy
Lil' Kodak, boy, they hate to see you in a foreign
They miss when you was in that 'Yota kickin' doors

Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, ""Boy, make good decisions""
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, ""Boy, make good decisions""
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision

Anyway, I'm married to the game, she said her vows to me

You go down for me, you lay down and do the time for me
Sorry, boo, yeah, I lied to you, but don't you lie to me

You a funny guy, don't you even joke around with me
How could it be? Get from 'round a G, you grounded from me
I'm a freeband junkie, you a junkie
You gettin' skinny, I'm gettin' chunky, gettin' money
Want some food? Boy, you hungry, I want them hundreds

When your well run dry, you know you need me for it
When I pull up in the Buick, you know what I'm doin'
If the police get behind me, I'm fleein' and eludin'
Sleepin' on the palette turned me to a savage
I'm a project baby, now I stay in Calabasas
Like I still serve fiends, like I'm still jackin'
I be sippin' on lean, tryna keep balance
Hit that Z-Walk, Dickie's with my Reeboks
I don't say much, I just let the heat talk
Your jewelry water whip, diamonds like re-rock
My lil' baby ride the dick like a seesaw
When I stepped up on the scene, I was on a bean
When I jumped up out the Beam', I was in Celine
Baby girl, you just a fling, that ain't what I mean

You ain't never run off with a hustler in your life, huh?
I'm from 1800, I'm a hot boy, but I'm iced up
Ugly corner where we smile with you and we don't like you
Just hopped off the plane, I just got out about a day ago
Everybody love me, when they see me they be like, ""There he go!""
Got me a new lady, we 'bout to take a trip to Mexico
Crackas took my .40 so I'm 'bout to go buy a Draco

Ayy, boy, I drop that shit that they be waitin' for
I like the Bimmer but I'm 'bout to go cop a Wraith tho'
I done peeped your true colors, boy, you a rainbow
I got Space Jams on my feet, I'm on the moon
I'm really lit, so I ain't gotta use no auto-tune
Yeah, I'm the shit, but you know damn well I ain't number two
I'm in this bih' around some niggas who ain't got nothin' to lose
But shawty got that head, she got that fire brain
She know I love the head, I love that migraine
You ain't never run off with a boss ain't ya?

The way my niggas hit your block, you'd think it's Halo
No more home invadin' now, I'm on the radio
I don't even like to fuck, I only want fellatio
I done jumped out to that bag, baby, check my swag
Money fallin' out my ass, I got a lot of cash
Ayy, everybody runnin', nigga got a gun
I ain't makin' beats but the Draco got a drum
I don't wear no fuckin' Yeezys, I got too much sauce
Like I don't believe in Jesus, how I triple cross
I ain't even brush my teeth, but I'm on the block
I ain't even brush my teeth, all I do is floss

I take that one all the way up
I'm about to take off on these niggas, man
And I'm codeine dreaming
(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming)

I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

I'm in Uranus right now, I think I seen a demon
I thought I left you back there in the cell or am I dreamin'?
Say I ain't dealing witcha, dawg, I'm going a different way
I broke up with my redbone, I went the milky way
I'm ridin' in a Wraith, feeling like I'm outer space
Stars on my sunroof, Planet of the Apes
I couldn't wait until they released me, right back on the turf
I took off on you bustas, left you right on planet Earth
I feel like Jimmy Neutron, how I blast off on a verse
I know my son gon' like this song so I ain't finna curse
Know he gon' wanna explore the world so I'm gon' show him first
Say we just distinguished  beings, baby, me and you diverse

I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming

'Bout to take off on you peons and go back to Mars
'Bout to leave these peons behind like the Jackson 4
Tried to moonwalk on the moon and had to wax the floors
Tried to put me in a box and then I crashed the Porsche, err!
'Bout to wake up in your biatch and go back and forth, yeah
Got her trapping out the the Fiat, she be back and forth, yeah
'Bout to put myself together, take it back apart, yeah
Got the codeine on my breath, it smell like caviar, yeah
Codeine dreams and they come true too
That's my spaceship, brp-brp!
My milky way got pregnant, she said it's for you-hoo
FaceTime Kodak with my new new, I left you 'cause he knew you
I'm wet dreaming 'bout Actavis, two new cups feel like new boobs
Tunechi

I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus

I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

'Bout to go to Saturn, heard they got the baddest species
You can hit me on my Galaxy, you tryna reach me
I went to Mars to get some Xanax bars to go to sleep
I'm in my Orange space shuttle flyin' two seats
I left Future in Pluto 'cause that boy was too geeked
End up playing Sudoku all the way in Mercury
I took too much of shrooms feel like I'm on Neptune
I'm with an alien, she show me what that neck do
And I'm a metamorphosis, you just a regular dude
You need a space suit to get up on this latitude
If she ain't foreign, then she boring, I need a Zorcon
You takin' morphine, homie, you a moron

Too Many Years,Lil B.I.G. Pac,2016.0,"I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind
‘Cause I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

I told my mama we gon’ be fine
So I’m up all night way after sleep time
I’m just thinkin’ ‘bout Lil Kuda
Gave my dog a dime
He put a buckshot in a nigga’s behind
No daddy so I grew up to the street life
But my son, I’ma keep him in the beehive
Scheming on a heist, I need to change my life
Been geekin’ all night, I’m going senile
With two niggas toting three 4-5’s
I seen a nigga play gangsta, then he broke down
Lost a lot, lost his mind in the courthouse
I’m on XXL, I’m in New York now

I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

I keep thinkin’ ‘bout my niggas
I think I need a jigga
I would keep on falling victim
Lost up in the system
Miss my brothers and my sisters
Damn I miss my lil one
I know sometimes I be tripping
But I just miss my niggas
I got codeine in my liver
I gave the judge a piece of me
I’m too street for the industry
But I think that’s where I need to be
‘Cause verbally, mentally, and physically I keep that heat
Me and my brother fit in
We smoking one with PnB
Niggas say they fuck with me
But lowkey they be easin' me
Bitches don’t mean shit to me
People tryna sentence me
How a youngin’ posted on the street, gon’ call it Sesame
1K ‘til the death of me, don’t put your life in jeopardy

I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back

I pour a four in a fifth
You already know what it is
I keep a pole in the whip
'Cause a lot of these niggas out here envy me
It ain't no ho in the clique
None of my dawgs got fuckboy tendencies
I don't even show no sympathy
Sipping on Hennessy, got me bending sideways
Everything on me drippin', you niggas can't ride the wave
Nigga run around with the juice, nigga come spill your drank
I done earn my stripes now I'm tryna go get me some real rank

Fuck all that playing, now I'm grown, I put my heart in it

I put Moscato on rocks

Shoot at the police, shoot at your top

Locked up, they swinging they knifes

Shot a nigga, took a shower with the bleach, Yahweh
Mama, I fell victim to the streets, I'm sorry
I'm in middle school; sellin' weed in the hallway
I was skippin' school, got in beef, started robbin'

Blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh
I'm stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated

Versatile,Project Baby 2,2017.0,"Ayy, I'm just going through one of my old pads and shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
You know, a nigga so versatile I don't even need no auto-tune and none of that shit
I could sweep the flow up, the melody
Like I could speak to all her fans through every genre
I fuck wit this beat, tough though, ya heard
Helluva made this beat, baby
Everything on my path for this
I swear to God, dawg, I never imagined this
I remember I was out there on my savage shit, carjacking shit
On my snappin' shit, trappin' shit, ratchet shit

Seem like I lost more than I ever gained
Ain't get nun out these streets but pain
Ain't get nun out these streets but hard times
'Cause in these streets ain't nun but hard times
Tell C.B. I say wassup
Tell everybody I say what's happening
Tell E-Pimp I said shoot me som'in
Tell them boys I said stop flaggin'
Tell my momma that I'm comin' home
Tell the world that it won't be long
Ask my hoes wassup with they phones
Tell 'em I'm away but I ain't gone
I said boo bear what you wanna do
Once you slide, imma follow through
The stand took a nigga up and through it
Lil Dash told me, Kodak don't do it
Tell my son that I love his ass
Tell 'em I can't wait to hug his ass
This for the niggas who got all that time
Now they trying to give them numbers back
A nigga shot my cousin four times
I heard through the wall my brother doubled back
I just bumped into this super jit
I'm hollering at Lil Fam through the vent
I'm letting you know I do this shit for fun
Tell me go then consider it done
Shoutout Petho and my brother blood
My nigga C-Lo he just caught a thug
I'm shooting cee-lo in a nigga ass
They hit a nigga for his whole bag
Tell them boys I said stop crabbing
Send it even if I never asked
I knew I should've told my lil nigga DJ to chill
But I can't tell him shit he doin the same shit that I will
I'm thinking bout how would it be if we ain't get on them pills, if we ain't never chose the streets and picked up the steel
I'm thinkin' bout how would it be if we stayed on the field
Like I ain't even have to rap, 'cause I got other skills
At nights we ran down with them sticks and got them automobiles
And we was jackin' cars and shit 'cause it wasn't hard to steal
Like doin bids and seeing it come, but this the life I live
But I know that this my last one, something gotta give
Seem like God, got me paying for all the shit I did
'Cause I slowed down a while ago, switched up positive
The rough was just enough for a nigga fell in love with the thrill
But before he forgive me I gotta pay for it still
And I done did so much of shit that I ain't proud I did
But when I took rappin' serious I threw the towel in
But Lord you say you gon' forgive me, so forgive me then
'Cause I done picked the Bible up and read Corinthians
I'm still young and I got a lot to experience
I guess the first time in my life I felt this serious
I gotta lil boy now and I wanna be there for bruh
The feeling he give a nigga I ain't never felt this way before
And you can look into my heart and see that I'm forreal
That I done resulted in a metamorphosis
God, you know my destiny 'cause you gave me this gift
You the one who put this breath in me to make me spit these lyrics
You done gave a nigga a chance to pay my momma bills
You done turned me to a man unlike my daddy is

No this ain't over, I got some more to spit
That was for the real niggas
I got some shit for the hoes

She made me happy, she made me smile
She brought me up, when you let me down
She nothing like you, she different
She nothing like you, she magnificent
She intelligent, she love me better than you
Better than, she love me better than you
She made me happy, she made me smile
She brought me up, when you let me down
Could you hold the title, it come with a life
Could you hold the title, you don't have to lie
Could you hold the title, could you play the role
You can't hold the title, baby let me know
Could you hold the title, could you play the part
Could you hold the title, till death do us part
Could you hold the title, hold a nigga down
Could you hold the title, tryna figure out
Take you out to dinner, stick this dick in your liver
I'm fuckin' your head up I'm playing these mind games witcha
I'ma suck that pussy good, then you ain't gon' hear from a nigga
I'm fuckin your head up with all these extracurriculars
I can fuck Virgin Mary, 'cause the game so unordinary
Had plans on gettin' married til they had me on solitary
You left me here stranded, I'm feelin' abandoned
You got me so hurt right now I need me a bandage
Transgression
Show you your corner, who gone stay solid and be down for you
When you really want 'em, when you really need 'em
When them people playing with your freedom
When a nigga shit on me one time but I be tryna get even
I'm tryna get equal
I'm iced out riding with that heater
I'm in that Thunderbird, I'm sliding with that Desert Eagle
Tell me who my people, show me where my folks at
Who gon' ride for Kodak?
Who gon' up and shake on me?
Who gon' jump the gate on me
Pillow case that thang on it
In case he tryna lay on me
Changed my address
But karma she know where I stayed on it
But that bitch better come correct she know that I stay on it
I ain't sleeping so forget about coming creepin' late on me
Got the 12 gauge on me
I got the 38 on me
I got the MAC-10, I used to have the baby 'K on me
I bought a Xbox but I don't play on it
PS4 but I don't play no games on it
The beat over got so much to say on it
My heart cold put a glacier on my wrist

I'm forever abnormal
I know I wrote this shit longer than a average rapper
Ya'know I'm sayin 
glee
But you got me fucked up
I be damn if you don't let me keep ridin' this shit boy

I'm pulling scams, identity theft
Don't buy my album, 'cause I don't care
I'm pulling scams, identity theft
Don't buy my album, 'cause I don't care
I be damn if I don't find a way to make some cash
I be damn if she come over and she don't get mad
Be damned, I be damn if she think she gon' get a bag
I be damn if you get me and I don't get you back
187 you screw me and you get nailed
I wrote this in the cell, free my niggas who ain't tell
I be damn, I be damn if I  go out without the heat
I be damn if I take that nat nat out to eat
Boy you ain't livin' like that you know you ain't in the streets
Even my ho can get whacked, I be strapped when I be sleep
I be damn if you niggas come run up on me
I just called my woo man, told him pray over me
I be damn I be damn if I don't come home in a week
I be damn I be damn thinkin' a young nigga sweet
I be damn if she don't call me soon the molly kick in
I be damn if she don't tell she gon wanna turn up again
Yo bih gave me a key, put me on her lease
I'm standin' at the feast til they bring in me a beast
It's too much weight on my shoulder so don't tell me hold up

Malcolm X.X.X.,Dying to Live,2018.0,"Now, Minister Malcolm, the thing that I thought might be good for starting it off is to talk about one of the most pervasive beliefs in the general society about the Nation of Islam

Talkin' to you like talkin' to myself
'Cause it ain't no gettin' through to you at all I swear
And I've been thinkin' 'bout you since I came to jail
I've tried to reach out to you, but it was to no avail
Guess it ain't nothin' else to do when we outgrew each other
We hard down beefin' like we never knew each other
Top off the coupe, no bikini, became our life now
I'm sippin' Bellini, livin' that lifestyle

And that is that it is an organization dedicated to the use of violent means to attain its goals. The question I have is, how true is this, and why do you think it persists in society?

Poppin' pills, poppin' pistols, I put my mic down
I almost lost my life that night, I was on a bloodhound
They tryna tell us put the bikes up and the guns down
X was tryna buy a bike then he got gunned down
X was tryna change his life, but he got burned down
X wasn't ridin' with no pipe so he got gunned down
Listen, do as I say, don't do as I do
Nine out of ten, it ain't gon' end up lookin' good for you

Have never at any time been guilty of initiating any aggressive acts of violence during the entire 33 years or more that the honorable Elijah Mohammed has been teaching us. The—

If I wasn't rich, you wouldn't be pullin' up to my funeral
First they kissin' you, huggin' you, then they suin' you
If it was me, it was you, I'm wonderin' what you would do
I just pulled up on your mama, homie, she beautiful
Yeah, gotta keep the strap, can't let you latch all on me
I got married to the game, she put these racks all on me
Now I got diamonds on my ring, look like a matrimony
First they screamin' my name, then file a lawsuit on me
You would hate to see me reach my full potential
You want me robbin', poppin' Mollies, poppin' pistols
I'm goin' to college 'cause to the youngins I'm influential
Thought it was Congress, they ain't know this was a Presidential
They ain't know that I was intellectual
You tryna change your life, but they won't let you
I know they know I'm special, why they playin' with me?
You talkin' jewels, I'm droppin' jewels, you see the difference
Coppin' jewels for your dawgs, they don't appreciate it
Everybody gon' say you fake when you make it
Back of the Maybach with the tints so you don't notice me
When the money bring the fame, you can't even roll in peace
Guess all the pain that I went through had to be the recipe
I stood tall through it all and brought out the best of me
Ayo, dismiss all them charges, that ain't my destiny
Everything I said, I stood on it, I got integrity
G.A., I put my hood on it, I bring the 'jects with me
You need security by your grave so you can rest in peace
Tide

Charge of violence against us actually stems from the guilt complex that exists in the conscious and subconscious minds of most white people in this country. They know that they've been violent in their brutality against negros and they feel that some day the negro is going to wake up and try and do unto as them as they have done—do unto the whites as the whites have done unto us",https://genius.com/Kodak-black-malcolm-xxx-lyrics
G to the A,UnKnown,2017.0,"Off top, chargin' extra for a rock
Finessin' all I know, that's how I grew up on my block
How you think I filled my shoebox up with knots?
Was thuggin' on the block, I ain't wanna punch a clock
I was gettin' bands while ya mans was gettin' hot
Sold my .22, he the reason I bought the Glock
Pop, one false move ya get shot
Catch me slippin', going with a smile like I'm Pac
Just want a bone, I'm a dog, nah I'm a beast
'Cause when I drop this dick, bet you tear up the sheets
'Cause when I drop this dick, bet you come back for more
I'ma come back 'til you suck me 'til ya throat sore
Aye, aye, aye ho nigga
Might just make you my bae
Just playin' hoe, come let me nut in yo' face
Nigga play with me I'ma knock off his face
Call Draco and Tae, they gon' let that bih spray
Gang, snipe 'em, bang bang
No drive-by, this personal, hit you close range
If we really beefin' why you put it on the 'Gram
If we really beefin' why you ain't thinkin' 'bout ya man, or ya fam
Can't catch you, they gettin' blammed
Easy to touch you, I don't gotta use my hands
Easy to touch you nigga when you got them bands
Nigga be hatin', lowkey he just a fan
On my block with the Glock, run down on a opp
Was a jit when they tried me, try me now they gettin' shot
Anybody try me now, on God they gettin' popped
Fuck nigga run up, swear yo' life gettin' robbed
Make a pussy nigga wish he went and got a job
Hit his ass with that rara, I'm a shotta
Free smoke, no ganja, Mad Max ya
Re-rock ya for actin', deserve a Oscar, boy ya fake
Real fragile, they be quick to break
Turnin' state, they jump on ya case, trap you in the gates
I know niggas doing time who ain't got release dates
Spendin' most of their time plottin' on a great escape
Niggas hate, guess all the loyalty been misplaced
This not a race but I chase the cake like I can't wait
No more dirt where I lay, so I stay outta state
I ain't tryna rack out so I stay out the way
From the draco to the .40 put respect on it
Aimin' at his head, he might have a vest on him
I'm from the Noya where a donk sit on Forgis
Ya gotta keep a .30 if ya ballin' like Curry
Sippin' lean, it got my vision blurry
Sippin' lean, got me movin' like a zombie
Got me reminiscin' when they tried to hide me
Throw away the key so they can't find me

Yeah I'm on my 
grimace, mezanmi
Let the Glock pop and I pop molly
Stopped sellin' rocks cause I love robbing
Whole life you been on the block grinding
Yeah, you just wanna pop free molly
That's the only reason you 'round me
No, you cannot get on my IG
This a selfie, stop tryna get by me
Let me out the cage, now I'm in ya broad jaw
Cool cat, I'm a mut, I'm a raw dog
I know all you niggas thinkin' I'ma fall off
I just took a lil' break, y'all need to calm down
We be strapped in ya city like it's our town
In the field, straight fonk a nigga outta bounds
How you snap a play then call timeout
Blitz ya runnin' back
, knock the whole line out
Yeah, once the pressure on, you can't call off
Nigga hopped on the phone and brought the cops out
I don't sell drugs so I don't come out
I'm posted in the cut with the sawed off
12 gauge on me, I ain't pump fakin'
I'ma serve foolie like the lunch lady
I ain't catch 'em dancin' in the cut lately
Trust me, I ain't come to throw no ones baby
I'ma dump when the thump make ya jump, shake it
Grab the pole, strip a fuck nigga butt naked
And you ridin' police escort safety
I was in the gym, now I got court cases
Nah, you don't want beef, you don't want ham
Nah, you don't want me, you don't want nan
You don't ya whole meat knocked off ya cranium

Everybody ain't gonna like it when they hear
Girl, I don’t care ‘bout no fame, I make you famous
I don't care if that's the only reason you came for
These hoes always make me feel good, that money can’t
I can't find no love so I went to the bank
I was outchea looking for love so I went to the bank
We met at B.O.A and then we met again at chase
Every thug need a shoulder they can lean on
I like what's on your shoulders, good head you be thinkin' on
Speakin' of head, I hate sex but I love my peter blown
You're a lil freaky hoe but you complete me, though
I'm sorry when I fuck I leave my bling on
I'm sorry when I fuck I leave my Rees on
See I'm a dog, I be just trynna get me a bone
He roam the streets alone you need to leave em alone
Stray dog, I don't need a home I don't be at home, I'm fleeing home
Raw dawg when I fuck her with no rubber but my ski is on
She heard I'm snot side nigga over there
She heard I'm snot sneaky nigga over there
They tellin' me she a thot, that hoe over there
But I don't even care if she have gonorrhea
They say she a sick bitch, I heard she got syphilis
But I'm going head first, jumpin' straight in it
I'm just kiddin' but I love that little babe
But I don't care if she a slut, she still my bae
And I don't need you telling me about how she do
She fuck everybody, and I fuck everybody too
Everybody say she out here trickin', I don't give a damn 'bout how she get it
Everybody say she got all the niggas So what? I got all the bitches
We got chemistry, fuck your history, I don't care if she was out here strippin'
I'm tellin' you baby, they ain't gon' like you jumpin' out that Bentley
Hittin' the scene in the Bimmer, I'm T-Double-D, you Trina
Everybody tellin' me she ain't shit, but nigga, I ain't shit either
And I don't give a damn 'bout none of that shit my nigga say
He tryna convince me he seen you on backpage
Everybody got an opinion, I don't give a damn anyway
I took her on a private plane, I took her on a dinner date
Everybody fuckin', everybody sinnin'
So what's wrong with turnin' that hoe into a princess
Yap, I can turn that hoe into a model
Scoop her in the Bentayga, no more Monte Carlo
If she ain't in a coupe with me, I want nobody in it
Bendin' corners wit' ya and my windows ain't even tinted
Babe, don't call me ese but I love it when we kick it
Fuck that he say, she say, it ain't nobody business
They ain't gon' like it, they ain't gon' like it
They ain't gon' like us, they gon' wanna fight ya
And I don't like people but I think I like her
I done let that hoe inside my heart now, wanna wife her
If I wife her I'm going Steve Austin with the ring
There's a stone cold diamond on her finger and it bling
I'm 'bout to cut off all my friends, I'm 'bout to cut off all my kin
Man, that pussy be pullin' me in, I thought it was a one night stand
I thought it was a one night stand like the lamp on my dresser
So she a lil dirty heifer, but this girl special
Thought it was a fling, thought she was a fling
I've been havin' dream lately, she might be my main
'Could you be my main? Could you be my baby?
Lifes gave me lemon, wonder could you be my main squeeze
Damn I fell in love with a nat
But every sinner got a future, and every saint got a past
So I ain’t even finna hold her accountable to that
'Cause baby see you ride, yo, that lil' bitch, she got my back
Baby she be ridin', that lil' bitch, she got my back
And when we ride, yo, my 'lil bitch she hold the strap
My nigga startin' cryin' when we went out in scraps
My babe more real than you, she one thou, keep that shit a stack
I don't throw no money, took my bitch to the club and threw some racks
Man with the plan, master mind my crafts, no more shootin' craps
I ain't no dog but call me Ken with the Ben, fucking on a brat
My lil bitch a brat, I hate how she act
But I love how she act, that my lil diva

Yeah, everybody with me on that same thang
I don't gang-bang but I bang bang
I pull up to the club, I got on eight chains
Took that bitch to Wings-N-Things, she wanna be my main

Brown liquor made my dawg insane
Booted up or geeked, it's the same thang
Fish scale or molly, it's the same name
Murder by the stains, which gang you claim?
The big Patek face cost ten chains
Took your bitch out to eat on a private plane
Real talk, 150 when it's plain Jane
Fucked that junkie behind the dumpster for some cocaine

Ayy, free my nigga Cool, he in the chain gang
Chris Johnson, I swear for God I drop the twenty-eight
I told my nigga be smooth (cool), he put a potato on a barrel
I kick her dumbass out my crib, say she want Chanel
I bought that bitch a lace 'cause she ain't got no hair
I sent that poor ass hoe a Uber 'cause she ain't got no wheels
Thirty golds in my mouth like I'm Stephen Curry
Thirty clip in my Glock 'cause I'm a damn Warrior

Streets left me scarred, ain't no worries
Run my money up in a hurry
Thirteen strippers, James Harden
Money make you greedy when you starving
Monisha, Tamica, they vouching
Before I had anything, I was saucing
Before I had that Bentley truck, I was saucing

Like a state trooper, I make my money on the road
I remember hittin' houses, nigga, cash 4 gold

These streets took all my soul from me
Tried to leave me in the cold
These streets took my conscience from me

I know my niggas got love for me
And they filling up they nose
I know my Levi got love for me
She just want everybody to know

I know my niggas, they be missin' me
So I be posted on the stroll
I don't even care about how much cash I see
I'm always gon' be in the 'No
I ran out of money, then they switch lanes
I ran it back up, then I switch lanes

I bought a brand new K, I can't wait to let it spray
I'm sorry mom ain't mean to bring you through so much pain
I said I'm sorry mom, I ain't mean for it to be this way
Ayy but fuck it, bitch, I'm here, I got diamond rings

God sat me down and talked to me, I listened
I was in that cell, he told me that I’m gifted
I don't make it in the booth, then I'ma make it in the kitchen
I’m special with the mic, special with the whippin'
I ran out of money, had to pay attention
All the people that was 'round me, they ain't have my best interest
You ain't have my best interest
You lazy with yo' loyalty and yo' position
And now I gotta execute 'cause you don’t listen
That throwaway on me dumpin’ with precision
I know shawty only on my trail 'cause she see a ticket
I’m readin' between the lines and peepin' they intentions
Can't have you niggas around me, shit gon’ go to missing
I had to press that bump, I had to feel it
You know if it ever come down to it, a nigga with it
All these drugs got the whole world jiggy
Hoes comin' out they clothes and niggas trippin'
Why hit the top to go back to the bottom?
All these bitches fallin' for me like it's Autumn
I'm tryna tell you, homie, you don't want none
They freed me so I'm right back to that mon-yun
Somebody tell these niggas they don't want none
Kodak Black but I'm spreadin' blue hundons
They sent my nigga Cool on the fuckin' run
When they let him out of prison, I'll be 31
I knew I was a star when I was sellin' hard
Everybody told me I would make it when I was on the block
See, before this rap shit, I was jackin' cars
I couldn't get all my time 'cause I was doin' fraud
Me and my nigga Lil' Marcus tearin' up the Wyatt
It hurt me to my heart, heard they gave him 25
I'm from the Noya, all I know is slang that iron

Just like I told you, if I'm lyin' then I'm flyin'
Just like I told you, if I'm lyin' then I'm flyin'
Just like I told you, if I'm lyin' then I'm flyin'",https://genius.com/Kodak-black-if-im-lyin-im-flyin-lyrics
First Day Out,UnKnown,2017.0,"First day out
Gave my mama hundred racks
And bought a iced-out AP watch
And bought a Cuban links just to match
That was voodoo, that was magic
Nigga be cappin', I just be laughin'
That was God, nigga was fastin'
And hidin' K2 in my mattress
Smokin' Tunechi in my cell
That was my twelfth time going to jail
That was my second time going to hell
And back for real but I prevail
Canary yellow diamonds in my bracelets
Same color as my lady
'Bout to hit her with no Jimmy Mack
And go half on a baby
'Bout to hit her with no Jimmy
Have her walkin' like a penguin
Still finessin', still be poppin' fraud finagling and wangling
And a brand new two-door Wraith
I coulda bought it but I just rent it
Got a brand new big old chain
Got so much sauce I don't need no pendant
Paintin' pictures when I be spendin'
I'm poppin' flo-rhythym on all these women
It's my birthday, just turned 20
And I just went to go see the dentist
Put some stones all in my gold
Know you niggas thought I was gone
Know you niggas thought I wasn't comin' home
But guess what, bitch I'm home
On probation, but I still keep that chrome
Crack a nigga dome
(On probation but I still keep that chrome
I'll crack a nigga dome)
Traded my AR for a sniper, traded my Draco for a TEC
Traded my Rollie for a AP but I coulda got a Patek
And I coulda got a Corvette, and I coulda got me a jet
And I coulda got me some sex, but I only got me some neck
Traded my ex bitch for a check
I'm takin' codeine with the x
I wanna buy my brother the world
But since I can't, I'ma get him a Lex
Ayy ayy, I'm a Israelite my diamonds is real ice
I had to sacrifice to be here, that's how I'm with you tonight
I had to run down with my big Glock 9 to feed my appetite
I had to go through hard times and dark times for me to see the light
Ay, I remember pourin' honey on my rice
Ay, I remember havin' no money, I was livin' in shacks
Ay, you got me fucked up if I'ma go out without a fight
Ay, this my first day out, I'ma live it up tonight

Live it up tonight
This my first day out, I'ma live it up tonight
Live it up tonight
This my first day out, I'ma live it up tonight

Everything 1K,Lil B.I.G. Pac,2016.0,"You know life ain’t tied with a bow but it’s still a gift though
Yeah life ain’t fair but it’s still good though
It’s a blessing just to be here
Everything 1K

I know you’re money hungry
Can’t wait ‘cause you ain’t eat all day
And you gon’ lose your mind if you don’t get a plate
I understand the ups and the downs, street niggas gon’ relate
It’s a struggle man, I’m with you all the way
This for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
Everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
I gotta thank God for everything
It’s a miracle how you’ll wake up and your dreams right in your face
Everything 1K

I woke up in the morning on a cold slab
How the hell I’m in a damn cell
I’m in jail taking cold baths
I went down the wrong path
Lil boy don’t go that way
You prolly won’t last
Before I had the fame I had the name
I earned my stripes like Adidas
Sliding base like I’m Derek Jeter
Growing up with no father, it’ll make you evil
How he gon’ learn to be a man when you ain’t never teach him?
Youngin’ can’t even read but he totin’ the Desert Eagle
Look how she left, I bet she told you she won’t never leave you
The same nigga was hating, I turned them to believers
I done made it through the rain and I ain’t called FEMA

I know you’re money hungry
Can’t wait ‘cause you ain’t eat all day
And you gon’ lose your mind if you don’t get a plate
I understand the ups and the downs, street niggas gon’ relate
It’s a struggle man, I’m with you all the way
This for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
Everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
I gotta thank God for everything
It’s a miracle how you’ll wake up and your dreams right in your face
Everything 1K

I probably thank God ‘cause without him who is me?
He unlocked my cell when they threw away the key
Jailbird, I was caged in, he came and set me free
I was just on the news, now I’m on MTV
Hurting ‘cause your people ate and you ain’t get a piece
Now you’re taking from your people plate ‘cause you just tryna eat
Grinding for a mil and I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout a combo
My mama need a crib, I been thinking ‘bout a condo
You nothing when you down, it’s crazy how people treat you
Come around now, you can’t even hit the reefer
I pray for all my youngins who done took the same route
Brother from the same struggle, cut from the same cloth

I know you’re money hungry
Can’t wait ‘cause you ain’t eat all day
And you gon’ lose your mind if you don’t get a plate
I understand the ups and the downs, street niggas gon’ relate
It’s a struggle man, I’m with you all the way
This for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
Everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
I gotta thank God for everything

My mama always told me 'bout that water, boy
Dubba-AA flexin'

I still got in that water
This is the sound

My mama always told me 'bout that water
And I said, ""Okay ma, I'm just gon' put my feet in""
I'm sorry ma, I got right in that water
I ain't never notice I was going deep in
Lately I've been working overnight
I can't party on the weekends
Like, why the hell you even in my life?
Tell me what's your real reason
I pulled up, drop my ceiling
I'm catchin' flights, you catchin' feelings
My diamonds wet, her pussy leaking
Ran up a check, then went to Neiman's

Like a kickstand I'm in here leaning
Them crackers let me out, swear it feel like I'm dreaming
Michael Jackson, yeah, that case I beat it
Fuck them hard slabs, now I sleep on Tempur-Pedic
I'm going hard 'cause my family need me
Mama said if I believe it, I can achieve it
Can't trust these niggas, they misleading
Can't trust these hoes, they so deceiving
I let him eat then he got greedy
I need a lifeguard, I'm in the deep end
I told that bitch I'm never leaving
I'm outta here, I'm going to Venus
My mama always told me, I ain't listen
So now I'm dealing with the consequences
I dive right in that water, went to swimming
Gotta watch out for these niggas, they be fishing

My mama always told me about that water
And I said, ""Okay ma, I'm just gon' put my feet in""

I pulled up, drop my ceiling
I'm catchin' flights, you catchin' feelings
My diamonds wet, her pussy leaking
Ran up a check, then went to Neiman's

Down on my ass, I had to get my feet in
They had told me change my ways but I ain't wanna listen
I looked my son in his eyes, I can't fail my mission
I say my prayers and tote my thang, I know they wanna kill me
Wake up in the morning, ain't got none' to eat
I had to man up to get on my feet
I go to Bay just to fuck with KD
Can't even swim but I'm deep in that sea
Got my first gun and I ain't pay a thing
Since I was young I've been slanging that heat
It be some massacres right on my street
It be some massacres right on my street
Remember they ain't gave me shit when I ain't had nothing
They want my spot but fuck them niggas, I'm focused on money
On everything, she say she love me I know she don't love me
3Three ain't round for to watch me, think I'm feeling something
My momma told me stack my M's, told me watch my homies
But I ain't listen Joe got shot, and he told on me
My uncle told me they ain't right, all them niggas phony
Can't lose it all for somebody who don't care about you

My mama always told me about that water

Would you be over me?
I'ma tell you like they told me
This fame it ain't immortally
I ain't finna go switch oversea
Ain't no money controlling me
Black boy gave me a throwaway
I kept that shit, I ain't throw it away
Ten bands for the Jaguar
When I wrecked that shit, I remember that day
Been up, I been on my back
Now I'm up like an insomniac
Remember I made my first stack
When Wally had that Pontiac
Went to jail and I came back
Went through hell and I came back
Was in my cell, recreating myself
I died, and then I came back
Wondering where my partners at
Ain't write me and I acknowledge that
Snoop had me selling powder bags
He ain't even give me a dollar back
Later on, started sneaking shit in my pocket like it's contraband
Finessin' had me lookin' back at my profit, I had seven bands
Me, Mark, Greg, Tracy went up the road, hit for eleven bands
Project Baby, Taliban
It's Kodak, run and tell a friend
It's for my mama, she love me
She just want the best for me
Told me I should be in the booth instead of posted up on the ugly
Was in the club on that Hennessy
Now you see me sippin' bubbly
All the stripper hoes on me
I ain't even gotta throw money
I ain't even gotta throw money

No more collard greens
Doctor told me, ""eat my veggies""
I'm smokin' broccoli
If you wasn't in the trenches with me
You can't rock with me
I'ma young prodigy
Now my plate filet mignon
No more collard greens
Doctor told me, ""eat my veggies""

If you wasn't in the trenches with me
You can't rock with me

I was cheatin' on my girlfriend
I fell in love with finesse
Now I'm married to the money, catch me stuntin' on my ex
Call it Smackdown, hit your bitch with the triple X
Need a Gatorade break, they caught me running up a check
Ever since a youngin', I been runnin' up the guap
Coulda ran track, but I was busy runnin' from the cops
I'm a young Haitian
VVSes in my watch like a Dalmatian
Bitch I got one hundred and one spots
Remember playing Lego, now I'm really on the blocks
Smoking loud, got my eyes so low I look like Fetty Wap
Jumpin' out ya window like Jeff Hardy
I'm a dirty nigga, boy, I got your bitch turnt up on molly

If You Ain’t Ridin’,Institution,2015.0,"If you ain't ridin, don't even act like you ridin
Cause I ain't tryna be out here wastin' my time
Keep it real, don't leave me in the blind
Cause I ain't tryna be out here thinkin you mine
Don't be having me out here thinkin you ridin
If I can't call on you, stop bangin' my line
Ion want nobody to be feedin' me lies
Cause Ion even be like to swallow my pride

Free Lil Kooda, he walk round with that 9
Free Lil Kooda man they gave him a dime
I like when you suck my dick while I drive
But let a nigga know is you really gon' ride
Is you really gone ride, even if they flat all our tires
Be hoppin cars and hotwires, till we get a brand new s5
I still fuck wit lil Robert he knew me since I was 5
Ain't even lookin at yo ass, I got my eyes on the prize
You ain't got lie to kick it, you can leave you can stay
And whoever told you that I needed you anyway
I ain't talkin bout no suit, I'll call a whole new case
I just wrote my nigga Cool like let me know if you straight
You be actin like you real but you know damn well you fake
I'm just thinkin bout lil jackboy it's his birthday today
I might cop a q8 we just got a new place
I keep my heart pumpin blood, all you lil niggas koolaid

If you ain't ridin, don't even act like you ridin
Cause I ain't tryna be out here wastin' my time
Keep it real, don't leave me in the blind

Keep it real with me, don't know why you lyin
You out here thuggin but you scared to do time
I kept it real with you, I never been slime
They don't know how I stayed up on the grind
What I had to do to survive cause all they see is the shine
They don't see these bags under my eyes, they see the paint on my ride
When I was down bad on my lonely, where was you were you there
When i was lost and i was lonely, where were you, did you care?
Don't be having me out here thinkin you for me when you there
You would hate to see me win, i know you want me to fail
Went to school got expelled, jumped off the porch i was 12
I ain't goin back to jail, no more thuggin I swear
You want loyalty but you ain't even loyal yourself
You a clown, you went down fuckin told on yoself
That's why my circle so tight, cause ion fuck wit you squares
Those cold nights in that cell, where were you was you there

If you ain't ridin, don't even act like you ridin

You ain't my nigga boy you be throwed off that random boy, murk him off that oil

He was just steppin' out to the little party
End of the night ended up with a body
Big booty bitch way bigger than Mizhani
While he heat kool with the whip like Desiigner
Why I hit the top to go back to the bottom
Now I got a lil one, I shoulda wore a condom
But now I'm happy I didn't wear a condom
Cause that lil nigga right there my blessin'
Three days after I lost my grandpa
Some told me to go take that test
And it came back mine
That boy mine, the people say 99.9
How you gon' pull up and crash the party?
I'll put the slug in your ass little buddy
How you gon' steal from your lil nigga?
How you gon' act like I wasn't with ya?
I can’t  do everything by myself
But I ain't gon' be outchea askin' for help
How the hell you gon' act like a housewife
When you know everybody know you a body
Got me a pistol, I got me a shotty
I be posted up in the yo like Gotti
How you gon' send a nigga like me to college
How you gon' send a nigga like me to college
Every time he step out he booted
Every time he step out it's a movie
Toting a toolie, I'm rollin' a doobie
I'm stickin' and movin', I'm burnin' and lootin'
Ain't got time for you lil niggas
Ain't got time for you lil bitches
Show me you different, show me you different
Show me you different girl, show me you different
How you gon' act like I wasn't there
How you gon' act like a nigga ain't care
I was on 1800 block all day
Nothin' was easy, had to get this shit the hard way
But I maintained, never complained
I'm true to the game, ain't never been a lame
Nigga I crewed up when I was nine
Got in these streets ,fell in love with the grind
I love the hustle
All of them nights I sacrificed, it only made me tougher
All of the trials, it made me wild
And tribulations, it made me wise
Tell my child don't fuck with them guys
We ain’t from that side, won't ont with them guys
I can't deny he got my eyes
I can't deny cause I'm not that kind
He don't even cry but he prolly might whine
I'm the jit on the school bus sellin' dimes
Why you gotta wish bad on your little whodie?
Put your ass on now you actin' all spoiled
Why you gotta talk down on your little homie?
Grandpa dropped middle of the testimony
Grandma died, guess he was gettin' lonely
Why I go HAM? Cause I don't eat baloney
Nigga you a phony, how you gon' act like you real?
How you gon' act like you trill?
Why you got the flag? A nigga already know the deal
How you gon' turn around and squeal?
Look at me leanin', I'm poppin' the seal
Look at my lips as I'm poppin' the pill, damn
Everybody acting like they my people
I don't fuck with you, I don't fuck with you neither
Woke up today went and copped a new Bimmer
Cuz a nigga got tired of the two-seater
I don't hear evil, I don't feel no evil
But I still walk around with the Desert Eagle
I just got me a referral from the teacher

Kodak Black-
Kodak Black-
The nineteen-year-old Pompano Beach rapper-
-is reportedly back in jail after he was arrested today in Broward County, Florida
Real name is Dieuson Octave, changed his plea from not guilty to no contest
Mr. Octave, do you accept your plea?
-in the two terminal cases that have put his musical career on hold
-troubled rapper found himself back behind bars after violating the terms of his house arrest
Yeah

You know I'm a hot boy, but I ain't never lose my cool
The streets on fire, that's why I'm ridin' with my tool
1800 block boy, I'm quick to give a bitch the blues
I was already sentenced, before I came up out the womb
Streets done already sentenced me, before no cracker could
And I wonder why, when I'm just so fucked up out the hood
And I wonder why, these niggas be hatin' on a G
When I'm the same lil' nigga, who gave you niggas a chance to eat
I had to do that time, could nobody do that shit for me
When I was doin' that time, ain't nobody do that shit with me
I miss my nigga Cool, I know right now he prolly sleep
One day at a time, ten toes down until you're free

Dyin' in a cell's every street nigga fear
I give everythin' back to have my nigga here
I give everythin' back to have my nigga with me
I already know I had to beef, had my nigga with me
I ain't tryna see the pen', I'm tryna make a shape
Neighborhood hero, I'm the one gon' save the day
Chosen one, my folks depend on me to make a way
I do it for my nigga locked up doin' day for day

They gave Lil' Marcus twenty-five, that's my man (ayy)
Remember hittin' licks and runnin' up them bands (ayy, ayy)
They gave Lil' Greg sixteen years in the pen (ayy)
For all my niggas locked up, I'm goin' H.A.M. (ayy, ayy)
They gave Lil' Ceelo twenty years, free my nigga
They say Lil' Tracy gettin' out this December
I dropped fifty-five bands from my hand
They done let me out, so now I'm goin' in
Before he go back, shoot it out with the police (ayy)
So that mean he goin' to court in these streets (ayy, ayy)
He goin' to trial right there where he stands (ayy)
For everybody did me wrong, I want revenge (ayy, ayy)

Dyin' in a cell's every street nigga fear
I give everythin' back to have my nigga here
I give everythin' back to have my nigga with me
I already know I had to beef,  had my nigga with me
I ain't tryna see the pen', I'm tryna make a shape
Neighborhood hero, I'm the one gon' save the day

My nigga slayed a nigga, I just came from hanging with him
I don’t know what really happened, I think he home invade the nigga
You never catch me out here clubbing unless they paid a nigga
Why the fuck I chase a bitch when I don’t even chase the liquor
Hell yeah they call me Kodak but I ain’t come to take no picture
So icy, make it blizzard, and I’m leaning sippin sizzurp
Lil Wiz, still be kicking doors, I call that boy a wizard
Damn, I was textin’ drivin’, I looked up, I wrecked the fender
Wally say boy you better get her so I blitzed her
No time to waste, therefore if I get her I’ma hit her
My mama say, baby you a winner not a quitter
Well not today, ‘cause mama soon as I hit her I’ma quit her
Cut the top with a scissor, turned my new car to a vert
I might need a new liver ‘cause my body full of syrup
Kodak Black, but I’m smoking purp, thinkin’ ‘bout cheesy purp
Rest in peace, Wayne Head and Purp, them boys down to earth
She know I’m a beast at every angle, you can call me Kurt
Flipped her over by her ankles, locked her and she called me Kurt
She know I be getting to the paper, I be putting in work
Up the road, playing with the papers, yeah I got that work

I’m on that greedy shit, that fiendin’ shit, I need a piece
I’m on that wreckless shit, that selfish shit, I’m playing for keeps
Money hungry, I can’t spare bitch, I gotta eat
I keep that heavy metal just in case he tryna creep
I’m on that schemin’ shit, you better give me everything
I’m on that Demon shit, the devil know I keep that heat
You remind me of your bitch, I got you on your knees
Jeep Cherokee, I’m skiing with my dope boy wrist

Take his bag then smash, what uncle telling me
Dirty pistol, dirty mask, another felony
Rocks in my mouth, I spit ‘em out when I was sellin’ weed
Choppers was tryna take me out at only seventeen
9 Glock, body rock, this bitch hold 17
Mouth wet, pussy hot, she just was 17 (too young for me)
Cocaine under my nails, working this triple beam
No fingerprints on my shells, too sticky from the lean
I’m on that greedy shit, it’s mine, I ain’t gon’ feed a bitch
Leave you leaking quick, one shot, one kill, Desert Eagle shit
I really got it out the mud, this ain’t no freebie shit
Guess how I got all my muscle, from deleting shit
Hard on the pussy, no old lady, I just borrow the pussy
These niggas thugging for the gram, gon’ record the pussy
Boy you remind me of your bitch, you a bitch
Your address supposed to be a nigga’s ditch
Old pussy ass nigga

I’m on that greedy shit, that fiendin’ shit, I need a piece
I’m on that wreckless shit, that selfish shit, I’m playing for keeps
Money hungry, I can’t smell bitch, I gotta eat
I keep that heavy metal just in case he tryna creep

Soon as he left, the coke price start jumpin'
Walk around the club like I walked around the yard
Nigga I'm the trap god, you tryna look hard
I'll never ever ever ask the police to protect me
Never ever ever let a rapper disrespect me
Next up from Gucci Mane, gun clappin' gon' happen
Put a cap to the captain, see my bullets tap dancin'

Signs,Project Baby,2013.0,"I ask the lord to send me a sign, I thought that I was blind cause I ain't never seen the sign. but the sign showed after time when I finally Realized it was too late to rewind
Guess I was just waiting on that sign, So I got up and went out on my grind. Cause I use to cry cause ain't no food in the house
Seeing all the older niggas man they use to shine, use to have the pretty girls and I just hoped that they was mine
Hypnotized, I was just nine. Black boy robbed a nigga right in front of my eyes
Rapping killed  time the years flowed by til I got old enough to run up on ya with that nine
The light man we became friends, I see em so much he cutting off the light again?!
I know his name co-workers and his kid, he ain't coming in the work truck he coming in his van
The more my stomach growled, the more I wanna lay a nigga down....take yo shit and make em cry
Mama got robbed in July I watched her cry,  so I don't care bout yours cause they ain't care bout mine
But look at me now, they told me settle down, PBL charges got me waiting on trial
Oh so ya know now? They sign read ""you never know til' you find out""
The things I found out... but they don't understand what goes on in my house
Ain't no love if ya broke! cause if ya broke they treat you like a bad joke, they don't even wanna laugh with you
When you shittin on em you can make em do anything, they'll even wipe ya ass for ya
In this worldddd... full of fame and pretty girls, It can make ya mind swirl
But you just gotta thank, the devil he gone play get in yo brain, have ya runnin in them banks
But now I just want the world to scream my name, don't even club im the reason why they came
Taking people shit im the reason for they pain
Baker Act, I'm all the way insane
Poking houses going crazy bout them chains
Them Cuban links and them rings
Its deep the sign I couldn't see, look at me now im getting weak look at me now I can't sleep
Look at ya boy I can't eat...Ion thank ain't never thank all for some money I just might blow it all in a week
But its Kodak you niggas know dat ! im bout whatever and ill hit a nigga like a road-rat
But fuck dat ! right na im chilling, slow money cause fast money will get me sentenced
I was in it they say im a menace, say im sleeping and when I wake up ill be in prison
Im chilling, this how im feeling...give me a deal give me mill. so im finished
Forget it im still with it... to mask up and hit yo granny for a penny
They say im stupid, they say im foolish
Kamikaze, Baker Act, but I know what I'm doing
Fuck school everybody on the campus, I did it so im ready for all of the consequences
Hard to trust a nigga do I know? They hate lil koly'on so paranoid might have to blow you!
Fuck a friend family too ION KNOW YOU !
Bastard child hey daddy ION KNOW YOU !

'Nolia boy shit, 1800 block, ugly corner, tied, gleeful

I was hopin' that you'd ride for me the way I rode for you
I wish my boy was here to see the man that I grew into
And I know if I'm feelin' like this, it gotta be mutual
But it ain't they business tellin' them the shit we surfaced through
Yeah, I won't never tell the world the shit I did for you
Even though you lied on me, that's cool, as long as you know the truth
I don't even feel the love be real no more, so I keep my distance
Remember I ran me up my millions, you was in your feelings
Even that time you shake my hand and you don't even grip it
But if I put that shit on blast, they gon' say I'm trippin'
I'ma just follow my intuition and I'ma keep on livin'
I wonder sometimes if you wishin', shit could've been different
Right now I'm cheffin', it's too late, I'm doin' my thing right now
I ain't lookin' down on you just chillin', I'm on the plane right now
I know you miss me, but don't worry, I'll never forget you
Even though you switched on me and it hurt me, I can't hold that 'gainst you
Takin' everything in me and it's burnin' for me to forgive you
You still my whoadie, still my dirty, but I ain't fuckin' wit' you
To create my future, I had to revisit my past, revisit my pain
But I won't never let you back in, we can't rekindle that flame
When he got stuck on and you blamed me 'cause you know I did it
Couldn't call on you when it was raining and it killed my spirit
All the shit you said, you tried to shame me, tried to kill my image
Even though you know me since a baby, and you know I'm with it
You know I'm serious, steppin' on niggas like I ain't even got no feelings
I'm in my cell right now, I'm wishin' shit could've been different
I ain't droppin' no names no more but nigga, I hope you hear it
Can't take nothin' back, it went like that, so nigga that's what it is
Everywhere I went, I took you with me, every show I did
Ain't say your name in all my songs no more, can't waste my lyrics
I said I was comin' home, they said, ""No you isn't""
I'm a real nigga, so I'm dyin' how I'm livin'
I remember throwin' rocks, now we goin' to prison
When I got my first Glock, kept that thing with me
You was with me on the block, thuggin' real silly
Jumped in the game, then I popped, then you went to switchin'
I tried to give you niggas shots, but you niggas missin'
Soon as Lil Yella got knocked, niggas went to snitchin'
I done been through a lot, shit you never didn't
I had to pop a nigga top to make that boy feel me
Crackers had me in the box, thuggin' every minute
Young nigga, see about me, I'ma show you different
All my life, throwin' rocks at the penitentiary
But now my watch got rocks, no more drug dealin'
And now my top gon' drop, I'm in a new Bentley
Heard foolie got shot, I wonder who did it
You my dirty, you and me, we made it from the mud
I been wishin' shit could've been how it was
'Bout you, I swear to God I would've took a slug
Down to kill a nigga 'bout you, and it's all love
This shit ain't about a stripe, this just what I'm used to
I'm down to throw away my life, throw away my future
'Bout street principality, no flag
Man, that soldier-like mentality automatic
I'm jumpin' out the pink-G truck with the ratchet
Z's up 'til I freeze up, lil' daddy (Glee)
Z's up 'til I freeze up, lil' daddy (Gleeful)
Z's up 'til I freeze up, lil' daddy

Gleefully, that's how you present that shit the right way
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout, Broward County, 954
You know, we don't represent, we don't re-present
We present it once and that's what it is, that's how you step
Can't take nothin' back, went like that, so that's what it is

Purp,Lil B.I.G. Pac,2016.0,"Oh, my bad, I thought that was a freebie
Skrt-Skrt, then I skeet-skeet
See me when you see me

I'm tryna keep everybody happy but I just end up hurt
And Lord knows that I'm blessed but sometimes I feel cursed
Took Wayne Head off this earth, then put him in the dirt
Took Cheezy Purp off this earth just to put him on a shirt
And when that .40 burst that shit like firework
So why they call you Kodak Black? You smokin' purp
I get right in that skirt and then she squirt, squirt
I jump right in that coupe and then I skrt, skrt

Look, I ain't finna fall for anything, I know my worth
And I ain't finna let you ride my wave because I don't surf
It'll go down any second, you better stay alert
I'ma eat that pussy for breakfast, save room for dessert
I woke up and straight applied pressure out the gate
Nigga, you can't walk a mile in my size 8's
I'm tryna understand why all these niggas hate?
Because I be in my own lane, I'm tryna motivate
I wish I could hold .20 in my .38
But round here we ride 30's fuck them 28's

I'm tryna keep everybody happy but I just end up hurt
And Lord knows that I'm blessed but sometimes I feel cursed
Took Wayne Head off this earth, then put him in the dirt
Took Cheezy Purp off this earth just to put him on a shirt
And when that .40 burst that shit like firework
So why they call you Kodak Black? You smokin' purp
I get right in that skirt and then she squirt, squirt
I jump right in that coupe and then I skrt, skrt

They say them youngings take something real quick
Lil' nigga I be thuggin, quick to scheme some shit
Baby jump on my dick, I'll run in your shit
I will jump in your shit
I will go in your shit
And now I'm understanding all them people phony
But I can't believe my people put them people on me
I'm geekin', I ain't going to sleep I'm on a monkey
Leave me alone, I'm rollin'
Leave me alone, I'm rollin'
My nigga kick your door in, love to kick a door in
I don't wanna go back to scopin', wanna go back to pokin'
I guess I gotta pay for all the shit I did
I guess I can't forget that I was hitting licks
I jumped straight to size seven, I skipped size six
I'm tryna get up out the 'jects, I can't stay out this shit
Gotta stay out this shit
Gotta stay out the mix

I'm tryna keep everybody happy but I just end up hurt
And Lord knows that I'm blessed but sometimes I feel cursed
Took Wayne Head off this earth, then put him in the dirt
Took Cheezy Purp off this earth just to put him on a shirt

I'm still wearin' Ree's like I'm still out here sellin' rock
Like my Ree's, you gon' let me tie ya down or you not?
When you wanna vacay? MIA is the spot
Where you hop on jet skis, niggas ridin' on yachts
Four wheelers, cuban links, niggas hoppin' out the drop
Show ya 'round the Noya, Ugly Corner, 1800 Block

I ain't been trickin' with these bitches even though you ain't my lady
We ain't seal the deal but I'ma keep it real and be patient

You 26, but I'm 2613 forever
Young rebel but I'm clever
I don't get too sentimental
Now I got you where I want you
I know the spot like a freckle
I know what it is now
I know how I feel now
I wanna build now, me with you
Call me on the FaceTime
Heard it through the grapevine, that I wanna plant my seed with you
You gon' make me change my ways
Postin' on my page, WCW
I want you to be my main
I don't want no one but you

Fuck it, yeah, the money gettin' to my brain
Yeah, I think I'm all that with this big chain
I ain't got no time tryin' to explain
Yeah, I love you, bitch, but I ain't finna say it

Everybody finna have their own impression
I've been through too much so I don't like expressing
Tell you one thing you gon' ask another question
If I tell you how I feel you gon' take advantage
Yeah I know you read the text but you ain't get the message
I speak in codes it ain't for you if you don't understand it
Think what you want to think you could keep guessing
Why should I even tweet when all you finna do is 
'at' it
?
If I tell you 'bout myself I'm finna go to stressin
Cause I might go to ventin' and I'ma start reflectin'
Took off from my past ridin' in the Bentley

When I'm takin' chances knowin' this a violation
If you love me, you'd understand my situation
'Cause you already know I'm on probation
Everybody tellin' me they miss the old me
But how the fuck I'm finna change and be the old me?
I'm still the same nigga I'm evolving though
I kept goin' back to jail like a revolving door
A nigga steady seeing more so I elevate
Say go back to the Kodak of the first mixtape

Everybody tellin' me I need to change
But then y'all gon' complain when a nigga change
Bossed up you sayin' lately he ain't been the same
Fuck it, y'all just wanna hate me anyways

If I whack him now, everybody gon' say somethin'
He tryna cop deuces, I don't tolerate none
He tried to pull up to the corner but he can't come
Yeah, we ran down fooly, he a wankster
He portrayin' to the media he gangsta
That pussy bitin', got me thinkin' about a ring or some'
That pussy bitin', make a nigga wanna sing or some'
Lil' cracker fucked up and then he put a bracelet on
So I'm slidin' in a Tahoe with a ray gun
I'm gettin' the money, I ain't even gotta pay for it
That pussy so good, I give her everything she want

I'm on house arrest but I'ma take one

Niggas gettin' kidnapped just to show you that it's real
Niggas gettin' snatched, showin' you niggas know right where you live
When you dissin' me, nigga, that better be really how you feel
'Cause I ain't takin' no apologies, I don't care if it's sincere
I'm on 1800 block, still posted with the steel
I don't even care, I got a couple mill' still in the field
I'm a bussiness man, how I give a pussy nigga the deal
Like an engineer, I give a pussy nigga the drill
I be lovin' when we vibin', I be lovin' when we chill
And that pussy so damn good, it make a nigga shed a tear
Slidin' lowkey booted, he a shooter, I recruited him
Better keep that toolie if he move then you shootin' him

For real tho, thank you lord

Thank you lord I’m here, I never imagined it
It lil Kodak Black, bitch come capture this
Ain't puttin' up with that, no I ain’t havin' it
Been showin' too much love, no more after this
They told me I’m a star, actin' like I’m average
Cuz I be rappin' but I don't be on that rappin' shit
I still be in the hood, totin' my strap and shit
Stop that flaggin', that's how shit be happenin'
That time I let you slide, Imma whoop your ass bitch
Save the choke sandwich in my mattress
Ay, where them yellow bones? I don't want no black bitch
I'm already black, I don't need no black bitch
Put your hands up if you a bad bitch
Bae let's go and blow a check at Saks Fifth
I said ""I love you?"", I was just on that Yak bitch
Girl you know I'm bein' sarcastic
I bag her then I’m gone with that shit
Girl don’t call my phone with that shit
Fuck it I don't owe a nigga shit
I been outchea thuggin' since a jit
Remember when we was strugglin' in them prick
A nigga had to go and hit a lick
I was throwin' rocks in the ditch
Now I'm throwing rocks at the chaingang
I just wanna gain and maintain
Ain’t nothing change, it’s still the same damn thing
New year but ain't a damn thing changed
Still in traffic, road running, switching lanes
State to state, I'm breaking the bank
Went to BA then I went to Chase
Only hang around with niggas who gon' crank
Only hang around with niggas who don't think
Niggas out here taking chances everyday
Niggas out here wylin' but they people straight
Can't say no to drugs, I be smoking dank
Don’t let Kodak in here he gon' stink up the place
I'm so God damn high, I can't feel my face
I'm so God damn high, I just might stick up the place

Close to the Grave,Dying to Live,2018.0,"You know death right around the corner and prison my next-door neighbor
Feel like I'm dyin’ to live
I know we live to die, but I feel like I'm dyin' to live

I be clutchin’ on my fire, you never know these days
Gamblin' with your life, you gettin' close to the grave
Sorry Lord, the Devil got a hold of me, lately
Knew I shouldn't have never let you close to me, baby
Clutchin' on my fire, you never know these days
Gamblin' with your life, you gettin' close to the grave
Sorry Lord, the Devil got a hold of me, lately
Knew I shouldn't have never let you close to me, baby

I knew I shouldn’t have never showed you that I love you, my nigga
I fucked up when I showed you that I trust you, my nigga
I tried to turn my life around, but now I’m back in the field
You know it's free my nigga Cool, I hope he win the appeal
I lost my niggas, it ain’t been the same
Everybody say that I changed, say I ain't been the same
They don't even know I'm feelin’ pain
They don't know how I feel inside, traumatized, criminalized
But yet I'm idolized, I swear to God sometimes I wonder why
It got me brainwashed, lil' ones off the same block
Remember I had to slang rock, remember I let them thangs pop
Damn, I just wanna raise my son, wish it could've been how it was
Sometimes I wanna grab my gun
Sometimes I don't be wanna hear none

I be clutchin' on my fire, you never know these days

Knew I shouldn't have never let you close to me, baby

My boy got shot, you put the blame on me
You say you know I did it
I can't even act like it ain't faze me
That shit hurt my feelings
My cousin got hit up, say he saw me jump out with the Glizzy
Why you had told them people you made me? Boy, you know you didn't
I hit that lick in Maryland, I bought my mama a Honda Civic
The hardest thing I had to do in life was leave you
I was showin' you love and had you feelin' like I need you
I'm drinkin' this alcohol right now, I wanna see you
You made me go hard in this shit, I'm motivated
Why you had gave up on the kid when I was jaded?
Now I've been drinkin', gettin' faded
Thinkin' 'bout how you played me
Thinkin' 'bout how you did me

I be clutchin' on my fire, you never know these days
Gamblin' with your life, you gettin' close to the grave

But in due time, you know, when I realize the truth, it's you
I hope you just don't go too far away from me, or let one of these vultures come snatch your heart away from me
You know, if it's love, it's love loyalty out value everything, yeah, loyalty, out value everything

Baby, it ain't you it's just me, I need a break

I don't want to lose you but I need a lil' space
As long as you don't move to a whole 'nother state
You still gon' be my number one
I ain't finna change my number
Just been fucking up my summer lately
And I ain't got no time to fuss on the daily

You might not understand this girl
This might actually be the best thing for us
We keep arguing every day, boo
Eventually you gon' make me hate you

You want me to stay on FaceTime
And make these rhymes at the same time
All this questioning be having me all stressed
You be fucking up my thinking process
I took too much of shrooms I feel like I'm outer space
You keep listening to these rumors they're throwing in your face
I say all I want is you and don't listen to them bae
But I might as well do it you don't trust me anyway
I've been running out of love
You wanna fuss I wanna fuck

Credit card fraud, I'm in an Infiniti
I just took my brother's charge like I am not rich
I took my brother's charge like I ain't got shit
I guess he ain't step up for me 'cause he ain't got it in him

I'm walkin' 'round with fifty thousand in my denim
And I don't trust nobody, I'm drinkin' snake venom
And I don't like you nigga, man, I'm just sayin'
I don't really like you bitches, I be just playin'
Before I jumped up off the porch, I was ready then
Let's see if I can shoot the pistol with my left hand
Type of nigga hit the party with my FN
Type of nigga fuck a shawty and her best friend
I be gettin' to the loot, I be gettin' it in
Free my niggas eatin' soup 'cause they in the can
Road runnin', gettin' money, I be pullin' scams
Redrum, head huntin', nigga, what you sayin'?
If you fuck with me, then why you got me doin' time?
If you fuck with me, then why you got me slangin' iron?
All these bitches on my dick, but they can't even ride
Got my mama out the bricks, she ain't gotta cry
Ayy, don't be fuckin' with my clique if you ain't tryna die
I'm a Zoe, don't call me Slime, then you is not my kind
I be steppin' on these niggas, I don't rest up
I put my foot down on that bitch, she be like, ""Yes sir""
Free my nigga JGreen, took one for the team
Hit the bank, I want no dubs, don't even
Kodak Black, I don't fuck with cuz, cuz green
Hit the slab, go and run it up, you know what I mean

You know what I mean? You know what I'm sayin'?
Free my niggas eatin' soup 'cause they in the can
You know what I mean? You know what I'm sayin'?
Free my niggas eatin' soup 'cause they in the can

Fresh out of jail, made another milli'
And bitch, don't think I changed, 'cause I didn't
I'll still'll hit a nigga with that glizzy
If rap don't pop, I'm back to stealin' identity
Credit card fraud, I'm in an Infiniti
Yeah, I just called Chief, he said that's not it
You keep tweetin' 'bout a nigga, get your block hit
I guess he ain't fuckin' with me 'cause I ain't fuckin' with him",https://genius.com/Kodak-black-identity-theft-lyrics

22 hours locked down, ain't shit to do but think
I remember like it was yesterday, was drinkin' out the sink
I'm sittin' back plottin', I'm just sittin' back vibin'
A nigga can't complain, I had to use my time wisely
I'm sleepin' in a dorm, but they ain't send me off to college
I still got money buried from that lick I hit in Raleigh
I'm book-smart but the streets gave me all my knowledge
So there ain't nun' for you when you comin' out the projects
So there ain't nun' for you when you comin' out the slum
A mouth full of gold teeth, they think a nigga dumb
I got a head full of dreads, think a nigga illiterate
But I know when I go to talk, a nigga'll reconsider it
I know you niggas just tryna benefit
I ain't fuckin' with you a little bit
I ain't fuckin' with you at all
I ain't fuckin' with you at all
I was sellin' weed in middle school, just meet me in the halls
Right now I'm goin' in, but I was just behind the wall
This jail got me thinkin', I feel like everybody flawed
I got too much to lose, but I'll still go at a nigga jaw
I'm down for the count, I'm never down for the cause
I made a million dollars off of shows and goin' hard

I love money, I can't go back to the bottom 'cause I
Hate it at the bottom, try to stop thinking about it

I'm reminiscing, yeah
Fuck your problems, it's too late to tell me sorry

I'm reminiscing, yeah

I remember everythin', I done been through everythin'
I remember who shitted on me, or who been in the paint
Like Ray J, got a bitch from the Bronx givin' me brain
Like Ray J, I done walked through the motherfuckin' rain
Right now I done got too far to give a motherfucker a feature
I'm the freshest man in high school, but I'm a motherfuckin' senior
Lil' shawty want to kick it, I told her I don't play FIFA
I jumped up out the Bimmer, now I'm slidin' in the regal
That pussy so tight but I be tryna go deeper
If she can make goulash, she a motherfuckin' keeper
Reminiscin' about my niggas, reminiscin' about my homies
I'm thinkin' 'bout my niggas, I'm thinkin' 'bout my whoadies
I don't fuck with Fooly no more but I still fuck with Koly
Got a booger in my nose, A Boogie on the chorus
A young nigga, I jumped off the porch, run Forrest
I'll lose it about that money, I'll go dumb for it
I'm workin' like a Mexican, fuck around and get deported
I bought my mama a crib, thirty clip in my forty
She said that my baby, I told that bih let's go to Maury
Lame niggas get extorted, if it ain't foreign then it's borin'

I love money, I can't go back to the bottom 'cause I
Hate it at the bottom, try to stop thinking about it

I'm wonderin' if you love me like I
I'm wonderin' if you thuggin' like how I be
Head first, is he runnin' right behind me?
Nah, fuck that, you better be runnin' right beside me
It's like everything that I touch, it just be fallin' apart
I can't leave my past behind me
I wanna know what's goin' on in the projects
I wanna slide and go see what it look like
Remember Pop hit a lick on a four wheeler
E Murder, almost lost his life on a dirt bike
I seen a cracker to my left so I turned right
I lost my re-up money tryna shoot dice
My niggas leavin' niggas stank for some hood rank
You ain't got no street cred, ain't got no Woo stripes
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas and my family
They the only ones that understand me
Pop the clutch, fishtail on the banshee
The Devil sent me a blessing
My dreads like devil horns, they don't know that I be on my damn knees
Forgive me lord, forgive me lord that I fell for it
Forgive me lord that I fell short
I'm dressin' plain in the airport
Bust a nigga brain if you care for it
Young nigga what would you do for it
Her boyfriend smokin' Newports
Just put my baby momma in a new foreign
'Bout to write a book, no Dr. Seuss, boy
I got stories like a news reporter
Like a book, put my momma in two stories
I'm postin' in the hood 'cause the school borin'
I'm smokin' Cherry Pie, I don't smoke Spice
I would never tell you about my old life
Sniper biker
Pop a wheelie on the Raptor
I got snakes in my closet, I'm a rattler
And I keep body bags for a rapper
Hidin' from my past, got me runnin' from a cracker
Lil' Kodak they just wanna see you captured
I'm snappin' and I'm flashin' like a camera
You don't know the meaning behind it
You don't know the reason I'm like this
Sincerely me
I'm feelin' this beat
To all my niggas in prison, if you listenin' right now, I miss you",https://genius.com/Kodak-black-1800-nights-kno-the-meaning-freestyle-lyrics
Deep In These Streets,Institution,2015.0,"I ain't gone sugarcoat nothing
I'ma tell you times when I was up
I'ma tell you times I was struggling
When I was starving for that cash
Say I was money hungry
Was on my ass down bad
I needed food in my stomach
When I be rapping they love it
But I'm out here snapping like, ""Fuck it""
Keep my head on a swivel
And keep my mind on that money
I ain't worried 'bout the fame
I fell in love with the game
She be giving me head
But I fell in love with her brain
I got love for my niggas
I know they love me the same
When I was going through my struggle
A couple of them changed
It's okay, I'm straight
'Cause I can hold up my weight
I was locked up in my cell
Had everything on wait
I'm on 1800 block, nigga, shouts out 
Once the road got bumpy, niggas went the other way
Everybody forsake me
Ain't no need for debating
I was showing love to niggas when I knew they was hating
Is it true or you faking?
I was gone on vacation
Now I'm back off vacation
And I'm like fuck, nigga, pay me
Gotta think before you speak
'Cause you don't know what you saying
Started off with a baby
Now I'm riding on Dayton's
I can't lose I'm just gaining
Once you sleeping I'm waking
You know I love .38s
But I still tote the .380
I'm a project baby
I'm tryna hit the suburbs
I'm tired of looking over my shoulder
Posted up on the curb
Posted up tryna serve
You wasn't there, you just heard
I be going with the flow
I just look back and observe
Got a trick up my sleeve
I got a lick for them D's
Got your bitch on her knees
She suck my dick with no teeth
I say Momma I can't swim, but I'm knee deep in these streets
I'm like fuck the industry because I'm deep in these streets",https://genius.com/Kodak-black-deep-in-these-streets-lyrics

Yeah, babe, me, myself, and I
Section 8 Taliban, yeah

All I got is me, myself, and I, got myself again
Time is money, I need that money, got no time for no friends
Ain't nobody gon' ride like me, cause I'm gon' ride to the end
Been in fucked up situations, where you niggas would bend
Play my cards, I never bluff, and I ain't throw in my hand
Shit, I saw when times got hard, I watched my nigga renege
He snitched, we caught that charge, I can't believe what he did
Cause he knew what we was doing before we went on that lick
I been rapping and snapping, I fell in love with this shit
It caught up with me, cause I be jacking since I was a litting kid
I been trippin' and goonin', and throwing rocks at the pen
All that sticking and moving, it got me doing a bid
Look, nobody gon' keep it real how I be keeping it real
Coulda snitched and got released, you know they offered a deal
Put myself in tight positions, I can't even regret em
I was scheming, times was hard, and I just needed some cheddar
My life a movie, it's Kodak, I'm the movie director
Sometimes it can scary, but I know it's gone get better
Remember when it was my people, them was gon' send me some letters
Cause I was missing my bitches, and I was missing my fellas
Hot pocket on me, so my pants keep fallin'
They wanna take me out the game, but I just keep on ballin'
Polo'd down, pop my collar, little nigga shot callin'
Could just hold up for me on the other line, guap calling
I'll get back to you later, I'm rollin' out of my tater
I been leaning so damn much, and now it got me disabled
Niggas grimey', be conniving', do shit under the table
Just last night, John John got yoked by the raiders
Fucking 'round on the ugly, hit that boy with a taser
Once I came out the womb, I jumped straight to teenager
They say I'm a demon semen, young boy, hell raiser
If I ain't pullin' up in a foreign, then I'm pullinga caper
Project baby paper chasing, tied, they dead flies

Run up on me, send you straight to your maker
All that kush that I be smoking, you think I'm from Jamaica
But hell nah, I ain't from Jamaica, bitch, I'm from golden acres
And I'll tag you with that 9, and that bitch got a laser
And I'll lay a nigga down, I'm like ""fuck nigga, pay me""

You ain't hear my motherfucking chorus?

Nigga you need to run you a check up
I'm eatin' on you niggas, no ketchup

Thank you lord I’m here, I never imagined this
It's Lil' Kodak Black, but bitch don't capture this
I ain't puttin' up with that, no I ain’t havin' it
Been showin' too much love, no more after this
They told me I’m a star, actin' like I’m average
'Cause I be rappin' but I don't be on that rappin' shit
I still be in the hood, tote my strap and shit
Stop that flaggin', that's how shit be happenin'
Last time I let you slide, I'ma whoop yo' ass for this
Save the choke sandwich in my mattress
Aye, where them yellow bones?
I don't want no black bitch
I'm already black, I don't need no black bitch
Put yo' hands up if you a bad bitch
Bae let's go and blow a check at Saks Fifth
I said ""I love you"", I was just on that yak bitch
Girl you know I'm bein' sarcastic
I bag her then I’m gone with that shit
Girl don’t call my phone with that and shit
Fuck it, I don't owe a nigga shit
I been out here thuggin' since a jit
Remember we was strugglin' in the bricks
Nigga had to go and hit a lick
I was throwin' rocks in the ditch
Now I'm throwin' rocks at the chaingang
I just wanna gain and maintain
Ain’t nothin' change, it’s still the same damn thing
New year but ain't a damn thing changed
Still in traffic, road runnin', switchin' lanes
State to state, I'm breakin' the bank
Went to BOA then I went to Chase
Only hang around with niggas who gon' crank
Only hang around with niggas who don't think
Niggas out here takin' chances everyday
Niggas out here wildin' but they people straight
Can't say no to drugs, I be smokin' dank
Don’t let Kodak in here he gon' stink up the place
I'm so God damn high, I can't feel my face
I'm so God damn high, I just might stick up the place
First I start my day off with a wake and bake
I ain't workin' out but I be shakin' weight
Now my lawyer hollerin' ""Pay me""
'Cause I got court December 7th
Just in case them crackers slay me
Girl I'ma come and get you pregnant
Just tell my baby boy his dad a legend
Just don't let him be like me, 'cause I don't learn my lesson
I was already a felon once they let me out my mama belly
Got a telly in my cell, I'm smokin' reggie with my celly
Yeah I'm young and reckless
I just stole a Lexus just to flex it
Hit the scene, stealin' for no reason and I ain't even sell it
I'm a street nigga after paper
I be snappin', I be scammin'
They used to call me Lil' Duffle cause I'm a young hustler
Nigga I bring that check in
Uh uh
I'm a lil' motherfucker, I'm fuckin' on ya mammy
Slidin' in a Infiniti
Down here, we call that bih a FinFin
Yeah, man they leaked my goddamn song and I wasn't even finished
Young nigga, I'm dufflin', yeah, I'm gettin' to them Benji's
Mind yo motherfuckin' business
Windows tinted, I think this my car
I think this shit rented
Windows tinted, I think this a new one
I think this a rental
Everything orange, I'm smokin' cantaloupe

Thank ya Lord
I swear I ain't never expected this before
I ain't shit, so why you sendin' me all these blessings?
Roadrunnin', tunnel vision, I been speedin' with no limit for it
But I ain't never thought that it could get this far
First they wanted me to win, I had all the support
But once I won, they don't love me no more
'Cause they wanted me to win, but they ain't want for me to get this far
They say ""No, no I ain't mean for you to get that far""

I said I wasn't gon' fuck that bitch no more but I did

I got check books, got that work but no 9-to-5
Drive through with that big MAC on the passenger side
Big MAC to your face, kill a nigga appetite
What's the point of goin' to college just to serve apple pies?

Yea,h that's your main bitch, I'm just a side nigga
I fucked that bitch bare than I prayed about it
I snuck that nigga bare than I prayed about it

I did my thot and skeeted off and popped three mollies
A nigga just died last night
I was way in Georgia on a flight
I’m fuckin’, I ain’t takin’ off my Nikes
I'm fuckin', I ain't cuttin' off the lights
I'm cutthroat but I ain't runnin' with a knife

I'm tryna figure out what's the difference?
I need someone to hold me down and uplift me
I don't care nothin' 'bout no clout, we be shiftin'
Like every time I come in town, they be trippin'
Every time I come around, you get missin'
Why can't we admit how much we really feel each other?
Why me and my own brothers gotta kill each other?
Hate to see me overcome and be a better man
Turned into a better me so we can be together
Turned into a better me, a better version of me
I turned into a better me 'cause you deserve it
I'ma get up out these streets because you worth it
Fuckin' with you how I be, I know you perfect for me
I want you to pray for me, they wish the worsest on me
You deserve a better me, a better person
You was fucking with me, I was at my worsest
We hit the club, I put the pistol in your purses
'Cause they don't really do too much when they be searchin' you

You see the better in me
You see the better in me
You see the better, everybody see the worsest in me",https://genius.com/Kodak-black-because-of-you-lyrics

Don't act like you don't know

Me and momo riding in the Chevy
Say my neck about to break my chain too heavy
Rebirth of Lou Scott Makavelli (ooo purp)
Born stacking bread like the deli (I've been rich)
So you can take it where you want
I'm kamikaze wanna try me? Suggest you dont
Oh, I told you boy, I'm riding the donk
Oh, I got shooters posted by my door
I'm from the Noy, yeah I stay Polo to the floor
Oh, my money long, I cut my homies short
From Golden Acres, what it is, it really ain't
I'm lyrical and what I be saying gon' make you think
I'm all in, I be solo, don't need no friends
I fuck with Lil Soto, that's my cuh-in-law, he get it in
Lil Jackboy, he just wrote me, that nigga he like my kin
I be up all night on M's, I don't fuck around with no Xans
Super charged, I'ma hit the game like a ram
You niggas lame with a lil fame on Instagram
I do my thing, I'm about to make you niggas flame
Ain't holding back no more, I'm finna make you feel my rage
Nigga please? Nigga what? Nigga who?
You running your mouth, your lips bigger than your shoe
Me and my pocket monster, us two, that's my crew
E-Pimp, that's my blood, that's my thug, he bring it through
Oh, I'm about to make you niggas feel it
Murder charge, fresh to death, I'ma make a killing
Oh, I can turn your state into a city
I'm a CEO, I can turn a Drake into a Diddy
Oh, bout to hit you niggas where it hurt
Why you go so hard? Why they put Wayne head all on my shirt?
I'm riding on 26 plus 4's, free Lil Turk
He just caught 30, that shit'll make me go berserk
Punchline, I hit the beat with a jab
The difference between me and you, I pull up in a Jag
Fingers inching like a rash, fiending for that cash
They say ""Kodak living good but all his bitches bad""
I ball so hard, my homie fouled 'em, my cast on
I rob so much, I'm in the booth with my mask on
Oh, I'm riding in the coupe, I'm the truth
That money running, I'm outchea chasing it, how about you?
You should get on a track and chase it too
I can turn a lake into a pool
My diamonds shining, why your ice look like it's blue?
While you out here lame vibing, you should be out here grinding too
They say time is money, I'm showing what timing do
Say grind turn into shine, I'm showing what grinding do
Lil Kodak Black, I'm the truth
Project baby, I'm the truth

You ever get the feeling that time is now to make a killing?
But you the only one that's standing round here with a vision
Everybody knows somebody, knows somebody, knows somebody different
That's what I'm tryna tell my people but my people don't wanna listen
We was brought up in a city where niggas, they hate on niggas
Bitches, they hate on bitches, and all of us is on assisted
Ain't watching my neighbor's paper cause that ain't none of my business
Niggas can't get it in cause they worrying bout how I'm living
Me, I'm my competition
Me, hit me on a mission
Me, I gotta get me, so I'ma make me be consistent
Fuck it, I'm all in, ain't doubting God's plans
Not on tour but I know they get easy in the end
23, I'm the man, I'm the fucking bird nigga
I done seen more chickens than Kentucky Fried Chicken
Ain't falsifying facts, ask a nigga in my city who the first one to get 'em, to get down with them triggers
I am only one man but a different kind of nigga
Left the game without a stain like a fucking place kicker
Anything, any lane, any time I'ma get it
Put my all in it, when it's empty fall in it, fill it
Go hard from the start, from the start to the finish
Done it all, college ball, worked a job, ran a business
Broke the law, broke a heart, broke my foot up in some niggas
Stab me up and shoot me down, but you can't knock me off my pivot

I'm a reaper, don't be hollering bout your people
I got a stick, it's a fuck nigga beater
Fucked the bitch cause I don't really need her
I'm on point like I'm blowing on keisha
I get cheese like I'm going on pizza
White girl, Ricki Lake, Mona Lisa
Nigga go and get your people then
Ain't nothing, ain't tripping, we can spend a band
Yeah, niggas getting crossed every day
I was taught every dog got his day
When them bullets go to spark and the dog gotta lay
Better hope to God he don't jump with the K
Mr. (?), by the park they'll break
When you getting money, fuck niggas gon' hate
Only real can relate
Four years in the state
And I seen niggas break
Better watch your mouth nigga, jumping on your case
Niggas in disguise, they deciding off of hate
Chain gang now dying bout the case
Know some niggas lying locked behind gates
Surrounded by them snakes
They be all up in your face and
Tryna talk the fire and crack on statements
Don't pen the affidavit
Man I shouldn't have to say this

4th quarter and we down by two
You gon' pass or shoot?
It's 4th quarter and we down by two
Is you gon' pass or shoot?
It's 4th quarter, 4th quarter and we down by two
Is you gon' pass or shoot?
It's 4th quarter, 4th quarter and we down by two
Is you gon' pass or shoot?

XXL Freshman Freestyle: Kodak Black,Freshman Freestyles (Class of 2016),2016.0,"My nigga slayed a nigga, I just came from hanging with him
I don't know what really happened, I think he home invaded a nigga
You never catch me out here clubbing unless they paid a nigga
Why the fuck would I chase a bitch when I don't even chase the liquor
Hell yeah, they call me Kodak, but I ain't come to take no pictures
So icy make it blizzard and I'm leaning sipping sizzurp
Lil Wiz still be kicking doors, I call that boy a wizard
I was texting and driving, I looked up, I wrecked the fender
Why they say, boy you better get her so I blitzed her
No time to waste, therefore if I get her I'mma hit her
My mama say, baby you a winner not a quitter
Well not today, cause momma soon I hit her I'm a quit her
Cut the top with a scissor, turned my new car to a vert
I might need a new liver ‘cause my body full of syrup
Kodak Black, but I'm smokin' purp, thinking 'bout chief the purp
Rest in peace, wayne hit a perc, new boy down to earth
She know I’m a beast at every angle, you can call me Kurt
Flipped her over by her ankles, locked her and she called me Kurt
She know I be getting to the paper, I be putting in work
Up the road, playing with that paper, yeah I got that work",https://genius.com/Kodak-black-xxl-freshman-freestyle-kodak-black-lyrics

But I ain't gon' lie babygirl you did me dirty
Girl, you did me wrong, did me wrong, wrong, wrong

Tell you the truth, we hook up now, it wouldn't be the same

Every bit' I meet for now, I'm just come keep it simple
Sometimes I wanna call you up and tell you slide

Off the Land,Painting Pictures,2017.0,"The man with the plan, I ain't playin', I'm 'bout business

You told on your mans, went to sing like you Whitney
Floatin' on a Xan, I swear to God, it got me dizzy
Project baby, I remember eatin' lilly-dillys
Culinary arts, I do my thing in the kitchen
If I go to jail, you niggas will never come and visit
You think she breast feedin' me, how I'm suckin' on her titties

I'm paintin' pictures, everythin' I say you see it vivid
Lil' Kodak makin' movies, I have you feelin' like you in it
I don't make no bubblegum music, I spit that real shit
You don't live this life, when you hear my songs, you'll feel like you lived it
I don't got no lady 'cause these bitches never like to listen
Gettin' bread every day, I graduated from biscuits
I don't do karate, so why lil' shawty wanna kick it?

When you see me, I'm booted up, ain't talkin' Timberland
No not Boyardee but free my niggas in the can
How can you even sleepin' knowin' that you ratted on your man?
Like a newborn baby, how I'm suckin' on her breast
I got two fingers up her dress and she already wet
I'm calculatin' every move, this shit like playin' chess
AR-15 with the scope just like I'm Ron Artest
All you bitches, you can't touch this like I'm MC Hammer
Where were you when I was cuttin' dope with Arm & Hammer?
When I was jumpin' in them houses like I'm fuckin' Santa
They send me to the slammer, you won't even send a letter

When Vultures Cry,Heart Break Kodak (HBK),2018.0,"I guess you wasn't nothin' different than them after all
Booted up, Molly jolly, no Adderall
I got tired of eatin' PB&J, noodle casserole
All my niggas behind the wall
All my niggas, they in the pen
Or they in the grave
Flyin' in the dove, nigga, fuck a Wraith

This what it sound like
Look what it sound like when a vulture cry
Look what it sound like when a vulture cry
Booted up, I'm high, booted up out my mind
I'm booted up out my mind
This what it sound like when a vulture cry
This what it sound like when a vulture cry
This what it sound like when I try to cry
I be tryin' to cry
When my niggas died, I was tryin' to cry
When my niggas died, I couldn't even watch you cry

Jumped up out the womb like my daddy the devil
My son jumped up out the womb like his daddy the devil
Life's been better
I thank the Lord life's been better
Ever since I dropped up outta school, nigga, life's been better
Since I ran out with the tool just to get me some cheddar
Had to jump out on a fool, whacked him, teach him a lesson
Lil' nigga, I ain't sparin' you, so I don't need you to spare me
I had jumped up off the porch headfirst, I was ready
'Bout that fetty, take a nigga ass away from his family
To hear my nigga tell it, man, that shit damn embarrassing
Go back to hittin' licks, got me thuggin' in Maryland
Smokin' gas, got my tank on 93 supreme
Smokin' gas, drinkin' oil, no kerosene
Had to fill all my guns up with blackheads
Fill my guns up with diamonds, so I run the biz
Fill my gums up with diamonds, look like gingivitis
All this money got me lookin' like Illuminati
He done caught his first body, swear he did enough
You can't tell him nothin', feel like he a real thug
Even in the rap shit, I get real love
But how you knowin' real love when you ain't got a feeling?
What you know about trust when you not 
feeling
?
I came up, now they pay a nigga top penny
Birdman tryna give the kid a couple million
Before Atlantic Records signed me, I was gettin' chicken
I was scammin', I was plannin' on the same dream
I got tired of baloney sandwich, no canteen
Got tired of PB&J, noodle casserole
I drink the coffee with the Molly, no Adderall
I guess someone not different than him after all
Stayin' focused on the cheddar, I be spazzin' now
Why you think they call him Kodak Black? I be blackin' out
These niggas want me in the box like I'm Pacquiao
Losin' all my niggas, started drinkin' alcohol
I jumped out the womb like my daddy the devil
I walked up in the building like I'm young and I'm clever, yeah
I walked up in the building like I'm young and I'm special, yeah
I got a couple million, also tote a Beretta
I dropped out of school just to get me some cheddar

She told me if I stop bein' rich, she swear it's over
My nigga be jellin', he be hatin', and I know it
He ain't never tell me, he don't say it, but he show it
Dyryk, don't you stop the beat, my nigga, keep goin'
Dyryk, don't you stop the beat on me, just keep recordin'
I'm finanglin' and wanglin', finessin' gettin' boring
Bought my mom a new three story 'cause we made it out the storm
We got shelter now, doin' better now, feelin' warm
Bought my mom two billy goats, but we gon' eat it if we starvin'
Take a shit right out the door, 'cause I can, and this my yard
Perpendicular my perimeter, all these acres like a farm
And I'll be honest, I'm the G.O.A.T., I was born right in the barn
Woke up feelin' like it, dropped 100 on the Audemars
Cash for gold, I got a pot gold, look like leprechaun
I be hittin' houses, run up in your home, Barry Bonds
Bombs over Baghdad, Sniper Gang Taliban
Ain't never had no damn dad, just my brothers and my mom
Bringin' tears to her eyes, I make her cry like it's fun
I threw away my life a thousand times, but not no more, I'm done
I'm out here packin' iron on Valentine's, I'm thuggin' 'cause it's fun
Make yo' daughter cry on Valentine's, that lovin' shit be dumb
I'm a cowboy for real, my momma call me Bill
Bought her a new crib with a shark and a eel
Look at all the drills, I'm spreadin' Gonorrhea
I was shittin' on her last year, now I diarrhea
All this ice around my wrist, I got the chill
That's why I bought this ice, it's just so I could chill
She be barfin' on my dick, I be like ""ew""
I need a heart transplant so I could feel
I drop diamonds on my ear so I could hear
She be gobblin' on my dick just like a meal
I dropped six thousand on my pupils, now my vision clear
Fuck Bonnie and Clyde, she say if I'm Bill, then she Jill
On a pill, holdin' on a seal
On a pill, rollin' off a hill
I'm on a pill, I need xan for real
You turn me on, I love them sexy heels
I'm a grim reaper, make a pussy nigga pay a due
Before I was on BET, I already made the news
I'm pullin' tricks, work go ka-poof like Houdini, who
I be swaggin', you think I know magic, you think I do woo
More stripes than Adidas, I ain't human, I'm a creature
My brother, he a Z, that's my zebra
And we havin' more stripes than Adidas
Fuck the money, nigga, if I don't like you, we can't do no features
Fuck the teacher, I be breakin' rules
Fuck the teacher, they kicked me outta school
Jumped out on that fu, then I peeled off in a coupe
Paint the Cutlass orange, so I peel off like a fruit
All the money look like soup, I be gettin' to the stew
Valentine's Day, but I don't love you, April Fool's
Banana clip on my pack, so I be Bathing Ape
I'm a monkey, got me swingin' with my tool, goin' orangutan",https://genius.com/Kodak-black-bill-and-jill-lyrics

I just bought a new Glock, cost me three fifty
I used to lay these niggas down so I sleep with it

My Glock got a dick, I even pee with it
It's a XD, boy don't test me

I don't need my team wit' me
I ain't no selfish nigga so my whole team winning
And I ain't rescuing no hoe, I'm a keep pimpin'
I ain't Supermanin', I ain't savin' you
I just dropped a album, Project Baby Two
I got a son now, my little baby two
I got snakes on my gucci, I'm a Python
I got snakes in my closet but not in my yard
Snakes on my collarbone but not in my lawn though
Doing fraud, I heard that money good in Colorado
A new Glock this a nine, Rajon Rondo
Every show I do now look like the Apollo
Shawty said she love me
Project baby pull up on a nigga no Huggie
Put my BM in the BM used to drive a punch buggy
Kodak Bop I don't milly rock, I don't dougie
Yah, going up, top with Nene
Kodak Bop, I don't do the nay-nay
You won't never catch me tryna dab
I be posted on the slab, selling slab
I just bought a new Glock, generation four
Remember eating hot cheetos with sweet n low
Hot sauce with my Lays chips, eating rice with honey
Got me reminiscing 'bout my life when I ain't had no money
Just drunk a whole fifth, smoked a ounce of weed
I left stems in it, but I threw away the seeds
Almost threw away my life
I threw away the glove but I kept the ski on
Thugging with my Ree’s on
I'm on house arrest but I don't be home
I'm running through ya hoe, running in yo door
Got me running through this door like chain on
 eskimo
I'm grippin' on my tool, I will let it go
I can't keep my cool, I will let it snow
Free my nigga locked up, eating sloppy joes
Probably playing spades, probably playing dominoes
My gun ain't on safety, I won't play with you
So I advise you find you something safe to do
Cause I keep the fire on and I got a firearm
If you run up on me, nigga flaming you
Cause I got a home , gotta make it to em
On top of that, I got a son, my little baby two
I just bought a new wraith and it's baby blue
Project Baby 2, my lil baby two
I just got me a brand new glizzy

I Need Love,UnKnown,2017.0,"(Verse)
I need love
I'm sliding in that cutlass just because
I pray to God my son won't be a thug
You know I'm on the grind
I don't even get to see him
You know my baby momma
She don't even let me see him
On the track I gotta run nigga
I'm sipping champagne I ain't gotta pop a pill
Wolve stripes in my body, I hit that nigga up
Wolve stripes got my rifle everythin' I did before
No peroxide, but I'm sitting in the cut
With my cousin Popeye at the top
It's just us
I'm jumping out the Wraith
Remember riding on that bus
I shook my old bih because all she wanna do is fuss
I need gratitude, Im on a different latitude
If you run up on me then I’ma bag a dude
Gratitude, and you know I’m straight dumpin' it
Got all the cheese
But I ain’t talking ‘bout government
I was hollering at the jitterbug
He said you wanna rap too
He said you wanna have plenty love
Matter fact he in the booth with me
I don't fuck with E-Murder
He almost died on that 250
But you know I still pray for him
I'll still load up and go spray for him
I don't wanna hit the chain gang but been in and out
I'm 19, but I was a baby when I jumped off the porch
I quit basketball just to thug the fucking block
I was jacking cars going to juvenile in and out
You would think I do construction
I was out here selling rocks
I was in the rap game, but i was still on the block
I was sitting in a cell when Enale got shot
That's my cousin
Swear to God it would have been different if I was out
My nigga Wyjib died, it took a lot not to cry
I was in cell reminiscing about all the times
We was out her kicking door in
We was out here on the grind
You would pop a xanax, quick to pop a nigga top
Call a nigga polka dot we will run up in you spot
Like a nigga tying shoes, tie that paper into a knot
I rep 1800 block, ugly corner Sniper gang
I rep 1800 block, 1800 block, ugly corner

In Too Deep,Institution,2015.0,"Project baby, I might need some fuckin' similac
(Due to some violent content, parental discretion is advised)

I'm in too deep, your boy deeper than a rap
Imma just let my soul bleed on the track
Check your resume, and you ain't livin' like that
You the main reason why your dog got wacked
I'm only for the cheese, you a freeze, you a rat
You the main reason why your dog got trapped
Before I ever chase her, I'd rather chase the yacht
Street nigga after paper, I ain't playin', Imma snap
Livin' in denial, juvenile back to back
Hit your house, throw all the gold in a pillow sack
Nigga take your chances, whole lives, shootin' craps
We just hit a lick for ten bands, it's a wrap
I'm a section 8, taliban with the strap
Molly Santan, beach sand in my cap
Yeah I could pass the weed, but I ain't pass the FCAT
And probably playin' sleep, cuz I ain't tryna text back
They found the contraband in my mat
I had to sneak a pen in my cell to write a rap
I'm extortin' niggas, want dinner and snack
Told em' Imma split em' if I see em' eat that
I'm vibin' in the booth, I just kick my feet back
She ride me in the coupe, had to push my seat back
I watched my dog shape back, just to relapse
I'm blowin' on OG, you smokin' green crack
I just got a slow leak in my tree wrap
That head got me lockin' up, call her beeswax
Better keep your Smith and Wesson, you might need that
357, E told me ""keep that""
Keep your boy well protected like a knee cap
Knock, knock, bang, bang, where the cheese at?
Glock pop, bang, bang, where your keys at?
Don't you say a damn thing, and I mean that
Ran 'cross the power after Cool got snatched
I was on the I, when the coupe caught a flat
That's the same night when SuWu shot Black
I wasn't even there to tell you if we shot back

Rapper Kodak Black locked-
On parole right now-
And is unclear at this hour what's gonna happen with Kodak Black-

You my girl, you my shorty
If I call on you, know you fallin' through shortly
I wanna be down with you, baby, like you are me
I wanna be down with you, baby, like you owe me
Is you makin' time for me, baby, like my Rollie?
I want you to ride for me, baby, like my woadies

And I goin' lie, I can't even focus
Lately I been stackin' all this paper like it's poison
Sniper Gang 'till I die, nigga, I ain't gonna forfeit
She just want for me to come and paint her like a portrait
She just want for me to put her up like she a trophy
Sellin' white girl, sellin' So, call it Sophie
Runnin' game like it's poetry
Young nigga chargin' to the game like a mophie
She FaceTimein' with a mean mug
Took her out a Punch Buggy, put her in a Beamer
My bitch name Tina but she bad like she Trina
I'm doin' me, drinkin' Tequila, smokin' sativa
I make time cause you my baby
Just like I'm bustin' out a AP
I make time cause you my baby
Feel like I'm bustin' out of AP
Feel like I'm bustin' out of AP
Keep me on hard
You make me go the hardest
Don't matter I fall
Pull up when you call me
When I'm behind bars, I be facin' charges
You the one I call, cause you keep it solid
You know I'm a catch you when you fallin'
Remember I used to have you in the projects
You gone fall through just like it's August
So I'ma pick up when you call me
You the reason I ain't go insane yet
You the reason I ain't lose my brain yet
You the reason why I stay sane
I'm poppin' out wit' you to hide the pain
I'm poppin' out wit' you to hide the shame
I never need a pill for the pain
You gon' fall through so I'll a make sure that you flyer than a plane
You gon' fall through so I make sure that you main squeeze
I had to make sure you my main thing
You gon' fall through so I pick up when you ring me
Late nights in the Noya
Flexin' in a Jag, hittin' licks in a 'Yota
That's the only reason that I had the 'Yota
She was fuckin' with me, I was with her way before her
When I was kicking doors and I was whippin' up the soda
Whippin' up the soda, you can call me Coca-Cola
She my Soulja
You my girl, you my shorty
If I call you know you fallin' through shortly
You gonna pull up like the Marshalls
Sniper Gang land on a nigga with binoculars
Pullin' up like on holiday we sittin' with the chopper
Holiday season we gon' ball like its Hanukkah
I'm married to this shit so sit back and get comfortable
Mama call me Bill cause we livin' like the Huxtable

What else you think a nigga used to stay out sellin' white for?

I had to hit that lick, it's a gamble everyday
I here you gotta take a risk
How else you think I wrapped the Cuban link around my wrist?
Now I'm bendin' corners, I got forgis on my whip
Cashed out, nigga, I've been racked up ever since

Go get you a check or two, that what you better do
So you can free yourself a lil bit, when you steppin' through

Am I depressed or stressed, 'cause I don't even know the meanin'
Ain't got nothin' to say but why I'm jumpin' on the beat then?
Never personal, it's business, that's the way I keep it
Hollered at my clergy, he love me like his own semen
Just dropped a album but I still ain't got no time for sleepin'
I might wake up, drop a mixtape for no reason
Influence you lil' niggas, happy that you wanna be me
Know you fake, Instagram page told ya secret
No booty shakin' music when you pop my CD in
Play a crook by the book, I'm sittin' back readin'
Real recognize real, but looks can be deceivin'
I still fuck with Young Money, I'm just CMB'n
Miss my Audi, in a different Audi every season
Can't believed they flipped the Audi that I used to sleep in
Thug to the bone, you can't roll if you anemic
Brought hell on earth, my hoe know I'm cheatin'

Future want me Freeband Gang, I can't 'cause I'm SG'n
Sleepin' and I'm geekin', sometimes I don't even feel like breathin'

Ya birthday Sunday, we just always end up locked up, ain't it?
With me on MTV on the red carpet, two lil' project babies
Yeah, at the VMA's we was the only ones taken
When this shit gon' end? I get out, you go in, it's crazy

Silence keep cloudin' me
Hands on my heart, it's soundin' like it's poundin' like the beat
Time never mattered
Time is money, I wish I could buy back all the time I gave away for free
Tunnel vision now, cause they was cloudin' me

Acting Weird,Heart Break Kodak (HBK),2018.0,"I fell in love with my bih from the field, baby
Said she from Miami, from the crib, baby
Yeah, when the link up and they ask me questions
You ever killed somebody before? (hahaha)

I don't play like that, you talkin' weird lately
Everybody 'round me actin' weird lately
I just want for you to keep it real, baby
I ain't let them know I had a mil, you crazy
Dressin' like I'm poor, I'm rockin' Timbs on the daily
All the record labels know the deals that I'm makin'
Coulda bought a Wraith, I bought a silver Mercedes
My head on a swivel, but your brain on the pavement
Remember hittin' licks and hidin'  basement
Talkin' to myself 'cause I understand what I'm sayin'
You ain't finna trip me out my mind, no more, Satan
You the reason that I'm Sniper Gang, and I'm shady
Walk up in the studio, bitch recordin' 'cause I'm ready
My bitch, she Dominican Republic, but I'm Haitian
I ain't quit the shufflin' in my feet, now I'm patient
Momma, look at me, mom, look at me, I been changin'
HBK, heartbreak kid, Heart Break Kodak
Remember when I laid there on the counter, seen you naked
Remember when I loved you, now I don't care who see you naked now
Remember when I loved you, now I don't care who see you naked
I came from the projects, Section 8, now I made it
Shit ain't never been the same, I wished I wasn't famous
But, Kodak, don't you give up, don't you quit like that lame did
Don't quit like them lames did
Kodak, don't you give up, don't you quit like that wanksta
Kodak, you better not go out like no lame 'cause you a gangster
Everybody actin' like some hoes all a sudden
Momma called me Joe, but I ain't no hoe 'cause I ain't Budden
In the field chasin' all my goals, I ain't puntin'
OG Kush got me with a odor, got me musky
Promise everybody 'round me known me since a youngin'
I be with my niggas they my brothers and my cousins
She so goddamn freaky stuck a bean in her booty hole
Money got me drunk, it got me peein' in the studio
Sometimes I don't know if I be goin' or I be comin'
Crack a nigga head like Humpty Dumpty

Everybody been actin' weird lately
I just want for you to keep it real, baby
I been had a couple mil, I ain't never say shit
I ain't never say shit
I'm codeine dreamin' in a spaceship
All the pain motivatin' me to stay real
Sound like a vulture cryin' in the glacier
I'm hotheaded but my chain is
I'm workin' like a slave still
And I don't need a Perky for the pain pill
I was sixteen with permanent gold teeth
Snatched 'em out and put diamonds in it
Y'all got the same grill
Everybody fuckin' everybody, we got the same girl
And I be walkin' 'round here like this my dang world
And I be walkin' 'round here like this my dang planet
Think about my family, had to pop a Xanny
Aye, I'm drinkin' liquor, tried to swallow my pride
I hope my son ain't gotta live like I
Mm mm, mm mm
Drinkin' tequila, smokin' sativa
I done made it out the rain, I ain't call FEMA
My baby momma in a Range, took her out the Beam
Ain't never showed no love to me on Valen-Day-Tine
I send words out through the grapevine
Made it out the jungle like I'm godsend
Swing with that vine like I'm Tarzan
I pop a nigga top, don't get your block spint
I ain't goin' out where I be god damnin'
I ain't do the jigga, I'm consumin' liquor
My wrist frame Muller
I don't do Invicta

She want love, but I just want war
I'm runnin' with my Z like my name Gohan
I bring a nigga that static, think he seein' Pokémon
My first hundred Gs, made it with my soldiers, huh
So when you see me with my Res on my feet, you know it's on
From the bricks, I rock a Dickie fit, I don't need Saint Laurent
Million dollar nigga, seven figure, Yves Saint Laurent
Maybe I think I'm paranoid when I'm feelin' on yo' booty
Can't break my heart 'cause I'm a thug, love just a illusion
Real thug need a lady to hold him down 'cause we go through shit

Went to jail, and I ain't never been free for a year
Ever since then, the kid ain't never seen the streets a whole year
I ain't pressin', applyin' pressure on a bitch 'cause that's weird
I ain't stressin', 'specially never 'bout a bitch 'cause that's weird

She's a nat nat, she's a theory
Make it rain like a deer
Stunt severe, stuntin' yearly

Express myself, but you don't hear me

A nigga like me, I'm prayed for
I'm thankful for everything
God just hear my prayer, I just know I'm alive

Every mornin' when I wake, I hit my knees, and pray
I'm so thankful, I learn a new lesson everyday
I was schemin', runnin' wild, and then I caught a case
I was locked up in a cage, that's when it all came to my brain
Keep your head up, Kodak, get out there, just do your thing
Get your bread up, Kodak, you ain't got no time to play
I was fed up, lost a lot, but never lost my faith
Cause there's reason's, I go through what I'm goin' through today
Had to tell myself, ""Kodak, you don't 
bubble
, you in trouble""
Had to tell myself, ""Fuck my friends, cause all I got is my brothers""
Then I told myself, ""Fuck these hoes, all I need is my mother""
Cause I realize, that I wouldn't be shit without my mama
Please forgive me Lord, know you understand that it's a struggle
Just a lil boy, in these streets, got caught up with the hustle
This for my two brother's, all we got is each other
I would be nothin' without em, that's why I love em
I gotta stay pure, I gotta stay positive
Imma step up to the plate, won't run a way, like my father did
Try to put my nigga on, but he didn't stick to the code
I ain't tryin' that shit no more, I'm just gon' keep my focus on
I gotta keep movin' forward, I can't get caught up in my ways
I been lost out here like pacman, feelin' like I'm in a maze
Steady leanin' off promethazine, I ain't got no medicaid
It's destined I'm gon' see my blessings, gon' be better days
You wasn't worried bout me then, why you worried bout me now?
Thank the Lord for what I got, cause I use to wear Fila
Niggas tryna box me out, been up, but I've been down a lot
Everything is temporary, don't get comfortable in your spot
You could be droppin' your girl at work, he'll be runnin' up in your spot
My niggas locked up, watchin' the clock, I can't wait until he drop
Counting bricks up on the wall, when I talk they drop the wall
You should want me to excel, why you wanna see me fall?
I been coughin' all night, it done really got severe
They say I should get it cured, before it get even worse
So they gave me cough drops, but I'm drinkin' cough syrup
In the coupe, I'm tryna splurge, and I'm 
fine off

From The Ugly,Institution,2015.0,"I'm from the ugly corner where we do a nigga nasty
Everybody toting straps, everybody trapping
Jit just jump up off the porch now he making it happen
This for all my young niggas up the road snapping
Big wheels, big bills, big automatics
All a nigga wanna do is ball like the mavericks
I could get a Rolls Royce if i keep snapping
Dope boys, wrap the slabs in the plastic

How you came up off of these DP-baggies?
How you get that jag I see you whipping out in traffic
That lil nigga so scrap call him lil scrappy
How you get more money than your damn daddy
Nigga how you fit that whole thing in your jacket
Me and Jackboy we be scheming we be carjacking
Looking for me, catch me creeping midnight with that ratchet
I just linked up with more wheezy in the back alley

I'm from the ugly corner where we do a nigga nasty
Everybody toting straps, everybody trapping
Jit just jump up off the porch now he making it happen
This for all my young niggas up the road snapping
Big wheels, big bills, big automatics
All a nigga wanna do is ball like the mavericks
I could get a Rolls Royce if i keep snapping
Dope boys, wrap the slabs in the plastic

All this money I be making I can't even stash it
And them niggas they be hating and they wanna have it
You gonna' have to come and take it I won't let you have it
Niggas try to come and take it ima' let them have it
Grinding on my mommas porch with my brother mazny
Everybody wit me ready and they bout that action
Why you think they call me Kodak? 'cuz i stay flashing
Why you think nobody like you 'cuz you stay flagging
If i stay consistent with it I can buy an Aston
I got shawty booted up she giving me daffy
Power high fuckin with me, he makin me happy
I just bought a new strap, I'm ready to blast it
Everybody in here with me straight bop-whacking
I can make a millie in my reebok classics
I forgot to bring the poker but i brought the flathead
Bout to make the bands drop, straight pop magic

I'm from the ugly corner where we do a nigga nasty
Everybody toting straps, everybody trapping
Jit just jump up off the porch now he making it happen
This for all my young niggas up the road snapping
Big wheels, big bills, big automatics
All a nigga wanna do is ball like the mavericks

Cut from a different cloth, I'm a different fabric
They wanna see the day that I go polyester

I will never stop thuggin’, I'm like this for life
I be gettin’ to the cheese, but I don't fuck with mice
Nigga rattin' on the team, hope them niggas die
When that four pound rock, I make the block shake
Glock like alarm clock, I make the block wake
I still can't believe Twin told on Jack
But I fuck with  Michelan’, but his brother rat
I ain't go to class, stackin' paper like it's loose leaf
I've been totin' straps, ugly corner too creep
All love fake, what you think the name mean?
I'm layin' on you like a snake, bitch, I'm A-Team

With the same vibe when I used to jack cars
How I boot up on these niggas, ain't got no remorse
I'm droppin' knowledge on you young niggas, no charge
And a nigga still thuggin' with this Prada on
Hundred thousand dollar watch, you know what time I'm on
I be lookin' in the mirror, I'm a fuckin' G
I done came from the street, this how I wanna be
My street cred' on fleek and I'm still intact

Me for Me,Project Baby 2,2017.0,"I'm getting so much money these days
It's hard to figure out who love me for me
Trying to balance out every thing
I'm getting sabotaged every way
You don't want to but you gotta change
It's going to hurt you trying to stay the same
Are you in it or you in it for the fame?
I'm trying to figure out who love me for me

I'm trying to figure out who want to see me winning
I already know resentment brings envy
I'm a business, man, I'm a fucking business
So I can't be up in the penitentiary
And I just wanna be able to tell who really with me
Is she for me or is she just playing with my feelings?
And I don't want to but I gotta switch up
'Cause you niggas want to have me locked up in the system
Even though that's who I am I gotta change my life
I'm getting so much money now I can't be slinging iron
And, girl, when we hooked up you said you gon' ride or die
So I'm assuming that you dead 'cause you damn sure ain't riding

I'm getting so much money these days
It's hard to figure out who love me for me
Trying to balance out every thing

You don't want to but you gotta change
It's going to hurt you trying to stay the same
Are you in it or you in it for the fame?
I'm trying to figure out who love me for me

I went to jail 12 times, I'll never go again
Even though I said the same thing my other bid
Everybody stopped fucking with me 'cause I keep going in
And I'm feeling like Ben Franklin my only friend
'Cause that nigga kept it real stayed in my pocket
He was with me when y'all weren't fucking with me in the projects
Is you in it for the fame or do you really like me?
It's hard to tell when I got five mil' in the Breitling
I know you don't want to but you gotta change your surroundings
'Cause them niggas don't want to change all they know is violence
I'm a sniper, you know all my niggas move in silence
I'm trying to balance out my life, I'm doing mathematics

I was fucking with you strong, what's the issue?
What you wanted? A lil song or a picture?
You say somebody hit your phone like it's pressure
So we'll just fuck it dog, I thought that we was better
What you wanted? A lil shoutout, a lil publicity?
If you asked me I would've did it with no resistance
You made a diss song and now you in your feelings
Runnin' around telling niggas you wasn't dissin'
Yeah, you niggas bout that life, but we more realer
Every time you pull a play, we pull one bigger
Yeah, you niggas 'bout that too, but we some lunatics
Man you niggas should've thought before you do the shit
Tried to shoot a video on my corner but we shoot the shit
If you a bitch then tell the media that you a bitch
I don't tweet, I tell that nigga pull up, bring some food
All my zombies in the projects will devour you
And it's easy to keep the tool but you don't know how to move
And you niggas ain't strategic, and you moving loose
My nigga caught him at the wrong time with the .22
Yeah, he let the .22 go, but it's a .22
I ain't specifically talkin' 'bout you Heffer
You niggas ain't got no balls, ain't got no testicles
You niggas pussy, ain't got no balls ain't got no pelvis
'Cause if you was a man you wouldn't be jealous
Y'all done brought it to a whole other level
Niggas getting kidnapped and getting let go
Niggas only did that just to scare you
To tell the truth, if I was there you would've been dead, bro
And I feel like it's a blessing I'm on house arrest, bro
'Cause you niggas already know a nigga head first
My cousin just got hit up and it fucked my head up
I was ready to rock and roll, come find my heavy metal
I ask my people ""Why you move my gun when I went to jail for?""
This house arrest might be a blessing, might be better
What the hell happened to that 187
On another note, you niggas should've knew better
Niggas know we ain't the niggas to be fucked with
But you niggas out here smoking on that fuck shit
Oh, you know we them niggas from the project
Oh, you know we them niggas, we them zombies
And you know we them niggas, boy, we about it
And you niggas gookin' right now smokin' mollies
If yall wasn't smoking mollies y'all would know the deal
How you a Z, but you goin' against the will
And I don't cop deuces, I cop 30s
And I can't believe Bushawn that nigga dirty
Yea you bout that shit you live it but you workin'
I don't care what you did out here, nigga you workin'
I keep having visions about these niggas getting wet up
How the hell you can't tell me 'bout the set up?
And I don't cop no pleas unless I'm jammed up
The only way you talk to me is about some cheddar
I'm swimming in the pool with my Beretta
I been learning moves dancing with the devil
Damn I heard you ain't wanna let the Draco spray
Why the hell you even got it anyway?

Swear we still gon' turn up when the Feds watch

Turned up in a coupe, they're goin' to Venus, yeah
Jump up in that pussy with my feelings in it

I'm jumpin' up in that pussy like I'm needlin'

Hopped out with that AP watch on like it's perfect timin'

If that nigga just like me, he tryna take yo life

You ain't understand me, I got more precise
I say ain't I resurrect, how I pull up in the flesh

I told him to pack his bags, we goin' out of town
And shit, I knew the best option for us to stay down

Told my future bright, yesterday I read my horoscope
I remember, I was in a jam, they said ""it's over for""
Young nigga, addicted to them bands, I'm bout to overdose

Paper chase, on the interstate, stick and movin'
Throwin' rocks at the chain gang
Out here tryna slang Caine
Asked God to forgive a nigga, but I just do the same thing
Cause I'm still on the same shit
And I'm still with the same clique
My girl is still around with me
I'm still with the same bitch
I'm still on the same strip
I'm still on the same corner
Now a young nigga smokin' crip
Remember I used to slang zona
I get in the booth and spit that fire, I put that flame on you
Rollin' off a monkey girl, come let me put this thing on you
Your niggas ain't your niggas, catch a charge and they gon' sing on you
They gon' turn the state on you
Switch, and put the blame on you
Now you want this head, don't you?
Now you wan't em dead, don't you?
I will pop a chance on em
Could of went fed on em

Ambition (I’m 14 And Already Thinking About Death),UnKnown,2011.0,"I grew up lookin' up to niggas that be on the corner
I can't stop cause if I stop then I'ma dissapoint 'em

My only goal is to keep courage and to make it out the bottom
Oh I was raised by the Chinese store
Even though I ain't Chinese though
Right by there is my Y and the corner store
Diamond grills guarantee you see all the hoes

I was raised where the thug lay
Where the little niggas die but I'ma maintain
I'm okay, don't worry bout me, I'm in God's hands
I just hope that the world understand who I am

Easy to talk about money but it's harder to get it
Uh, they gon' hate me for my ambition

The only thing I worry bout is how my grandma doin'
I'm doin' good, I'm stayin' healthy, now I'm makin' music
I'm gon' strive to success and I'm gon' try my best
I'm 14 and already thinkin' about death
Damn I was raised by the dead end
Where fake ass niggas always tryna fit in
Ambition
I'm young and ambitious
The dreams that I have, I'ma dream of madlib it
I can not caught no feelin's when no one else feel it
I cannot play my cards with no dealer to deal it
I'm just livin' with patience
Dedication and greatness
How can I be good when the hood so-so my validation?
I wish my grandma was still here to watch me grow up
I wish four clippers still here to watch me blow up
I guess things never go how you want it to
So I don't wanna be the man, I'm goin' to, uh

Where the little niggas die but I'ma maintain
I'm okay, don't worry bout me, I'm in God's hands
I just hope that the world understand who I am

Easy to start off your dreams but it's harder to finish
Uh, they gon' hate me for my ambition

I was raised by Wale and them
Get on the beat and let it breathe like oxygen
Every time they do things I follow them
But in a while a lil nigga gon' inspire them
Yeah, I even seen real niggas bail
Seen one got these beads reppin' like a Nextel
Same ones hollin' that they won't tell
Now you think you real cause your motherfuckin' phone tell
Swear these niggas think I'm in that stinker than a skunk tail
Swap my phones now my eyes liftin' like a dumbbell
Niggas sell their soul just to get a fuckin' record deal
So tell me how you fuckin' real?
My momma told me do me but just don't never steal
But I do it anywhere just to keep my pockets filled
They say one day I'm just gon' run up in the wrong house
And a nigga gon' come around and blow my brains out
Deadbeat daddy, grandma gone, that's all I know
They like me in the city, called Pompano
Grandpa was a player, he was with another woman
I just look 'em in his eyes and I see me right through him
I swear my throat hurt from tryna swallow my pride
My daddy fuckin' his god-daughter, she just 25
They got 3 kids and there's one just 5
That means he been fuckin' with her since I was 9
I just opened my eyes and let my ears listen
Friends ain't friends, lil nigga pay attention
Swear my only friends J-Crack and Lil Raw
Man we go back like Al Capone and cigars
And I know that some niggas don't want me to succeed
I just look past it keep balanced stay on my two feet
Got to watch my back cause niggas play keeps
My uncle looked at the weed, he ain't even got money to eat
And God damn, I swear my life crazy
Other people peep my swag, now they think I got a gammie
I'ma live my life
Man you never know, I might die tonight
But God with me
And I ain't gon' leave this world on no plain mission
That's my ambition

I was raised where the thug lay
Where the little niggas die but I'ma maintain
I'm okay, don't worry bout me, I'm in God's hands
I just hope that the world understand who I am
Ambition
Easy to talk about money but it's harder to get it
Uh, they gon' hate me for my ambition

Yeah half my life spent tryna find somethin' to do with the time we got. The time we got is spent tryna find somethin'.

I’m on that shit, I swear to god
And really this a 40
But my 40 hold 30
Met a cougar bitch, she 30
She heard a nigga putting that work in
Ho I’m just sliding, I ain’t serving
I be gliding, I be swerving

Keep these niggas out my face, so concerning
I be sniping and deserting
Skrt skrt, I be leaning when I’m turning
All my pieces working, got me splurging

I got 30 inches on my car, I just made 30 drops
30 shots in my Glock, 30 golds in my mouth
You can call me leprechaun, throw the gold in the pot
Dish soap in the pot, 30 bands for a drop
Need somewhere to hide that guap, think I need another spot
30 down, straight drop, dirty tan, get rocked
Love the way that 30 pop, Stephen Curry with the shot
16 I open shop,
 then the people kicked us out

Rest in peace to my grandpa, he had 30 jits
I’m not a killer, but where the beat? I wanna murder it
This a drought, it ain’t no work, this shit been working bih
So I’m lurkin’ bih, I’m ‘bout to go on a burglary
Them people playing at my bank, they think I’m doing scams
Nigga drop the 28, he lost seven grams
Blackin’ P’s every day like I'm Will.i.am
Heard you niggas was looking for me well here I am!

Keep these niggas out my face, so concerning
I be sniping and deserting
Skrt skrt, I be leaning when I’m turning
All my pieces working, got me splurging

I got 30 inches on my car, I just made 30 drops
30 shots in my Glock, 30 golds in my mouth
You can call me leprechaun, throw the gold in the pot
Dish soap in the pot, 30 bands for a drop
Need somewhere to hide that guap, think I need another spot

We do the same thing, but won't do it the same
I pray to God that I ain't losing my brain
Made a lot of music to forget all of my pain
I just wanted money, but it came with some fame
I get on the beat, and I just be wanting to sing
Even though I wanted to it's never gone change
All the love I got for you is never gone change
Shit ain't never, never, ever gone be the same
Shawty say she love me, so she tatted my name
So I ever leave her then I'm leavin' a stain

Leavin' 'em all, tryna hide the scars
I can't hide my carnality, my personality
I am who I are
I'm sitting in the dark
All I want to do is shine, they throwing shade on me
I turnt that money clean off of living dirty
Can't leave the streets alone
It left a stain on me
I get on this beat like it's my testimony
We do the same thing, but won't do it the same
And everything they do it's like they all changed
I got skeletons in my closet by my Balmain
That's my shooter coming around here
That's my dawg, man
I promise we gone all ball, man
Just bought a mansion, you just bought a damn chain
I'm about wacking, hope you about the same thing
I tried to forgive you but something wouldn't let me
I think about my woe, I just popped a xanny
I'm still fed up, but I'm countin' fetty
I tried to forgive you but something wouldn't let me
I be going too hard I might break something
I get retarded, boy, I shake something

We do the same thing but won't do it the same
I pray to God I ain't losing my brain
Made a lot of music to forget all of my pain
I just wanted money but it came with some fame
I get on the beat, and I just be wanting to sing
Even though I wanted to it's never gone change

We just came into this shit with it already

Baby mama flagein',
 she don't get no pardon
Boostin' up my ego, made me go my hardest

Louis Vuitton these thots, I trap out the spot
Hermes belts and drapes, keep my doggies straight

G1 had me in the kitchen, sellin' hard and doin' fraud
Took me out the 'jects, now I'm flyin' private jets, nigga

But it ain't getting to me, cause nothing can't get to me
Cause that's what the streets owe us, the world gon' keep going
I'm really disappointed but a nigga gone keep focused
It's like he already told me, it's like he had a warning
But it come anyway, even if that heater on him
Ain't gotta creep up on him cause I gotta feed the soldiers
I don't know when I'm finna reap what I sow
So baby show me all your love before I go
This wasn't supposed to be no thug song bae
This was 'posed to be our love song bae
Got me thinking bout getting my gun and going bae
Got me thinking about putting my gloves on wait
I be getting in that pussy without no glove on, wait
I'm raw dogging now I will never go stray
I got a lot to say but I don't know where to start
I might break off from a nigga but I won't break your heart
At least not on purpose, now you can't even hurt me
I done took so much pain, now I just endure it
I don't even need a perky, this shit isn't gon' even be working

I done fucked up and got into deep thuggin
You the one, the one that made me feel something

But once I walked inside the booth my phone started ringing
Ain't answer cause I'm trying to vibe and talk to my lady
Lemme put you on hold real quick, man you niggas talking crazy
Like why you calling me? I'm trying to do RnB
But now I gotta mix it up, I'm holding two conversations
Don't you know this album's 'posed to be for all the cuties
Now you calling me, got me in here talking 'bout a shooting
Fuck it leave him clueless, I don't like to express myself
Fuck it he ain't do it and I know that very well
Yeah, once I got a call I got the beat too
I couldn't finish the song and I couldn't go to sleep too
Went home my brother told me something else, they creep too
That shit deep too, threw me for a loop
I done got exposed to the life way too young
I ain't paralyzed but the street done turned me numb
Like nothing gon' even move me, but baby you make me run
I'm talking murder music, and make you fall in love

I ain't finna play, put the .40 on ya ass
In a Audi thing, 240 on the dash
Ya girlfriend know we got bags
Got her in the hotel, shorty getting smashed
It's just me and my niggas having a blast, living fast, buying the things we never had
We just love stunting, we ain't never like to brag
All us thuggin', we ain't never had a dad
I did a lot of dirt in my past, later on the cell came, bit me in the ass
Lately I be hit the beat with the tab
Lately I been doing shows back to back
Free Chattboy, free Cool
Im going hard, I ain't going back to school
Bob the Builder youngin' on the corner with the tool
Swimming in the money, what you doing in the pool?
Took flight, then I landed on the news
Playing with them bands, I ain't playing by the rules
Please stop playing girl you know how we do
Menajahtwa, bada-bing, bada-boom

Haa, this that summer jam .. go tell ya momma them
This shit right here make you..
This shit right here make you wanna go run up a check
This shit right here make you wanna go put some golds in ya mouth or something..
Or go cop a foreign or something
Or get you some money, man run up a check

Kodak Bop, this the money dance
Ran up a check, get that money man
Ran up a check, I be dufflin'
Ran up a check, do the Running Man
Ran up a check, pop them rubber bands
Ran up a check, run it up again
Ran up a check, ran up a check

This Life,Institution,2015.0,"Shit just crazy dawg
You know, when niggas fall victim to the system
Nigga get accustom to the street violence

Damn, I've been fucked up and got caught up in this life (shit deep)
I've been tryin', but I can't get my circle right (niggas creep)
It's consequences and repercussions when you thuggin' (I'm out here thuggin')
I'm doin' my thing, so now they trippin' all of a sudden (I be trippin' on em)
I ain't trippin', I'm just tryna get this money (I'm just tryna get this money)
Road runnin', state to state, I just been duffin' (I just been duffin')
Yeah, you pretty, but your personality ugly, girl
She gon' be there for me, even when I'm strugglin'
My daddy left us, left us at the house with nothin'
But I ain't trippin', I kind of like what I'm becomin'
Once a nigga get a little Fetty, boy, they comin' (you know they comin')
Ready or not, you better be ready, cause they comin' (cause they comin')
Keep it real with yourself, fuck a bitch (fuck a bitch)
You just gotta remain yourself, never switch (never change that)
I'm the last nigga left to do this shit (the only one)
Because it ain't nobody else doin' this shit (the chosen one)
I'm still workin', I ain't perfect, but I'm tryin' (but I'm tryin' though)
Mama, I don't like to see you when you cryin' (fuck you cryin' for?)
Even though I'm probably the reason why you cryin' (wipe your eyes doe)
Cause I be in some shit, majority of the time (we fine though)
Stick and movin, im maneuverin', I be swift (swift)
Road runnin', it be hard to catch my drift (hard to catch my drift)
Your life ain't tied up with a bow, but it's still a gift (it's still a gift)
You can have all the money in the world, you still a bitch (you still a bitch)
Why you out here, flaggin', like you bout that life? (he ain't bout that life)
When you want another nigga, black and white (nigga deaf as hell)
I'm just doin' what the fuck I want, cause this my life (cause this my life)
Already got it, I ain't tryna earn no stripes (I ain't tryna earn no stripes)
Now everybody wanna text me, but nobody sent my kite (ain't nobody sent me no fix)
I was livin' in the dark, but I'm just blessed to see the light
You know I hit them with that poker, but I'm special with the mic
I done took so much of losses, thought I'd never get it right (get it right)
Dancin' with the devil will have you sittin' up in the cell block
Nigga ain't give me shit, I was hittin' licks, I had to sell rock
All I wanted was some dope boy rees, fuck dem shell tops
No diversity, we just burnin' in a meltin' pot
Young niggas wylin', we just runnin round here, wreckin out
Everybody know that you get locked up, go to sellin' out

Remember I was down bad, funny how the kid up
Had to get my shit up, nigga run that shit up
Aye, pick it up, I'm out here tryna get it up, don't hit me up

It's the project baby, I been out here since the jitter bug
Swiper no swipin', just been runnin' round stealin' stuff
Bitch, you ain't my daddy, fuck the teacher and the principal
A damn shame, I dropped outta school to be a criminal
I'm different from these niggas, ain't nothing like the typical
And nah, I ain't stuttin' that shit, It's just the principle
I ain't got no image, I ain't gotta keep no image up
But you can call me Kodak, she see it she wanna flick it up
I'm in the field, applying that D, I'm like the Seminoles
I'm in your girl, applying that D, I'm gettin' physical
Nigga think you fuckin' with me, I'm not feeling him

Aye, pick it up, I'm out here tryna get it up, don't hit me up

Park the stolo at my neighbor house, they called the tow man
I won't bend, ain't foldin', I won't back down from no man
Scopin' and pokin', they hit the cash for gold man
I was 14, when I met the cash for gold man
See me when you see me, lil buddy, stop the commotion
All that talk you doin' just givin' me free promotion
Nigga, if you ain't gon' use it, then why you totin' it
Remember I was on my dick, now I let my nuts hang
Trappin' off my Que Sera, it's the busta bus thing
Early in the mornin', she callin' me, tryna complain
I told her ""ain't no love goin' on, it's just a fuck thing""

Mama, I know
Sometimes I act crazy but I'm still your baby
The projects made me like this, you can't blame me

Mama I'm still your baby but the streets corrupt me
I'm sorry I fell in love with guns, I fell in love with thuggin'
I'm clutchin', I keep that Colt .45 everyday like Tony Dungy
I shoulda just listened to what you said but I don't really like instructions
I don't be wantin' to hear nothing
'Cause I was lookin' up to my cousin
They was in and out of jail, that was all I seen
So I knew what I wanted to be as a youngin'
Mama said she hate my stubbornness
Why I gotta be so grumpy
When it comes to anger don't rush it
You gon' end up in a dungeon
I hate my attitude but I love him
'Cause I don't really be with that fuck shit
Mama I'm fried, I be just tryna vibe
I ain't really trying to get impulsive
Sittin' back sippin' on Hennessey
Niggas tryna drain out my energy
Ain't no bad vibe in these premises
I can feel the vibe you envy me
Tryna stay level-headed keep my head straight
But the devil he don't want to see me go the better way
Deep in my heart lookin' for the love I had
My heart was gold but these dirty streets turned it black
I was a good lil' nigga life turned me bad
Can't show sympathy, I might get whacked
On probation but I know I got to stay strapped
Went on a lick geek, I forgot my face mask
Went on a lick geek, turn up on a nigga ass
When they let me out VA, I had 30 stash
Poppin' fraud 'cause this rap shit wasn't bringin' cash
Always takin' care of my mama 'cause she all I had
You would think a boy roller bladin'
How I skated so much ramifications
I coulda got draft to the Patriots
NFL, run up on me get deflated
Drop some but I caught a lot of cases
On route, goin' up top on a safety
I pray to Yahweh could you save me?
Lately, I been goin' back crazy
Maybe if you be my lady
I might stop all this ragin'
Baby could you be my lady?
I just been sittin' here thinkin'
Wonder if you could be my lady
I be goin' through some phases
I don't want to know new faces
Everybody 'round me changin'
I was just talkin' about this to my partna them
I just gave a pussy-ass ho a compliment
Thought she was a thousand, I just start to like the bit
Nine dollar bill that ain't real she counterfeit

My nigga I was so close of wifin' it
I ain't brought it in, she's triflin'
All along she was just a bodit bitch
She a slimy bit, she a grimey bitch
She conniving, she a sloppy bitch

I got some shit to say so call the engineer

Trigger finger itching got me busting hoes in my crib
Trigger finger itching got me busting in my crib
Trigger finger itching got me busting hoes in my crib
I was a ghetto child, wanted to be down with my peers
What I'm rapping about the streets would vouch for me for real
I'm wild but I ain't doing no more wildin' gotta chill
Sorry I already made my mind up for real
Lowkey I be vibin' cause my family need me here
But god I gotta keep the fire on conceal
Yeah but I'm wiser now but I ain't drinking beer

You don't stop this music I'm gone keep killing it I swear

Fighting cases nigga facing PBL
Eating PB and J everyday waiting on some mail
I'm freestyling when I'm vibing so don't stop me I don't care
My nigga tried to send me a kite I swear to god he got his mail
First forty-eight my nigga told on himself
At school telling everybody the news before they rang the bell

They say they with you for life

Tellin' lies on me, say I caught 11 years
I done lost a lot of friends, shed plenty tears
Could've hung me by my throat and cut my fucking ears
Stay solid, had to do my bid, now I'm here
Road runnin' for that money, we in Chesterfield
You know they say shit real when you in the field
Had to get it how I live, that's just what it is
Tried to put my nigga on, but he fucking squealed

10 Toes Down,Heart Of The Projects,2014.0,"Look
Man, I need it right now
Gotta stay 10 toes down
I just gotta stay down
Road running, now I run the town
I ran it up, got it off the ground
Paper chasing I be on wow
Soundbite, they biting my sound
Niggas running off of my style
Gotta stay down

Started off with a quarter pound, that's the intro
Now I run the game, blow that money like Nintendo
I am never low
Man I be higher than my tempo
Trip Lee Kodak, I will jump right through your window
Had to stay humble
He murder say black, stay humble
I'm all I can be, bumble
Bakery, fuck pound cake I need a funnel
Tarzan swinging
Yeah, I made it out the jungle
I hustle and I bubble
And yeah I struggle sometimes
It make me wonder how I keep from going under
Do it for my momma
6 plus 4
I'm on my ten toes feet planted to the floor
Bitch I used to kick doors
Trying to get this money ain't trying to get no hoes
Once I stack that six, I want six more
Wrist gold
Call the plug tell him ship a shitload
I sit on the stroll and let that shit go
Fuck the fame
I'm writing foreign
Road running I be on the Jordan
And why all these niggas be so concerned about
What I be doing and try to hop on for a pony ride


Rolled up in that Jag
Roly poly
Niggas they pulling me back
But they don't know me
Codeine take the pain away
I might OD
I can't let you win this race
I need the trophy
Nigga wipe that frown off your face
You are an emoji
I'm outchea
20 for a day I'm like Kobe
Phony, get from round me
You niggas bogus
Nah, nah
I never leave that money call me oldie
Put me on stage, don't even show mix
Abracadabra
That work gon' hocus pocus
Took off like NASA
Fresher than Orbit
Show my ass off
Shitting on them, they like toilets
Pulled up in NASCAR
I just rent the Corvette
Boy I'm finna blast off
I let it surface
And she say she like purses
And like splurging
Only spend that money on me
My favorite person
No, I will never purchase
You ain't worth it
Riding like a derby
I can't work it
Flexing on them on purpose
They feelings hurting
911 emergent, I need a surgeon
This urgent
Bleeding concrete no longer virgin
Thank you
(?) like Turkey
My 40 churcking
I can't work it
I just get nervous
And go to bursting

Gotta stay down
Gotta stay down
Niggas running off with my style
Gotta stay down",https://genius.com/Kodak-black-10-toes-down-lyrics

What they did right there
Nah, let me see that
(Nah, that's just-)
Who that from, right there?
Yahhh, my nigga!
That real

Just got a letter from my nigga
I grabbed the top and I ripped it
Two pages front and back
I read them and started grinnin'
Wonderin' how I'm doin'
He like, ""Lil bruh, how you feelin'?""
Told me shit ain't the same without me, the streets miss me
He hate the situation I'm in, he say I'm trippin'
Just got out of the county, they tried to send him to prison
Just talked to his P.O. and he still facin' a sentence
While he was writin', he was blowin' kush and drinkin' Remy
He lookin' at my pictures right now, he in his feelins'
Just tryna bounce back, but other than that he chillin'
Tellin' me how his dog went down and went to snitchin'
Damn, that shit crazy cause we in the same position
Say he remember them times goin' on them missions
Say he for real, he really do, he reminiscin'
He out there making moves, then get caught up with the swivelin'
Everything going smooth and you just get caught slippin'

This shit a lesson for you breh, you better pay attention
When you get out, Kodak, stay focused and keep spittin'
Bruh, you remember that hoe you was fuckin' with, Lil Vicky?
Man, I hear she fuck with some nigga from Khia City
When you think about it, I ain't seen you in a minute
I hope when I get out we could ride around the city
I'm in Tallahassee right now, I'm with Lil Ricky
I'm tryna stumble across a little play, I'm just livin'
Just do your time and don't be worried about these bitches
I'm here for you, anything you need, breh, just hit me
Your brother just told me you hopped on a plea for three
But everybody sayin' you caught eleven years, G
I'm doin' good nigga, how about you?
I had to send a kite cause that's what real niggas do
You my lil nigga forever, just keep your head up
And write me back ASAP, soon as you get this letter",https://genius.com/Kodak-black-letter-lyrics
Fed Up,Institution,2015.0,"I'm so fed up with my niggas switchin' sides
I'm so fed up with these bitches and the lies
I'm so fed up you see the anger in my eyes
I'm so fed up with being sick and tired
I'm so fed up somebody might die
I'm so fed up with these niggas in disguise
I keep my head up cause I'm too strong to cry
I'm so fed up that I wish that I could fly

I just asked my homie could he help me bounce back
Shit so fucked up he ain't even hit me back
Everything good right now but I was on my back
I'm good though I just had to see if ya had my back
Fam just caught a charge and he took the time and rolled
T-Bird went down, he bitched out and told
 caught an L and that pressure made him fold
How come street niggas ain't livin' by the code?
I'm so iced out fucked around and caught a cold
I done ran my bands up I just came from up the road
I'm so fed up of these petty ass hoes
I'm so fed up I'm blowin' kush out my nose
All these bitches want a lil piece of my thang
All these niggas want a lil piece of my fame
I'm so fed up I put codeine in my drank
All this stress I feel stranded in the rain
Got me in the booth I'm rappin' my pain
I'm so fed up it make me wanna sang
I'm so fed up I'm going insane
I'm so fed up I went and copped the chain
Then I copped the bezels, I love the blang blang
And about whatever, I love to bang bang
They so pathetic man you niggas is lame
Ya'll ain't ready man you niggas can't hang

I'm so fed up with these niggas playin' real
I'm so fed up I just popped me a pill
I don't understand what's goin' on here
My co-defendant went down, fucked around and squealed
I'm so fed up I'm loadin' up my clip
All my life I've been runnin' in the field
I'm so fed up I put diamonds on my ear
I'm so fed up I pulled up in a spill",https://genius.com/Kodak-black-fed-up-lyrics

Doing fraud is my advantage I be stackin' them funds
Rapping is my habit I be rapping for fun

No more orange pop, I'm drinkin' holy water

I don't wanna love you, girl, 'cause I won't love you deep

I ain't have no time so I just took the bitch to Steak 'n Shake
The beat it got me in my feelings, vibin' to the rhythm
My ears a symphony but I don't show no sympathy
Don't let 'em kill your self esteem, they tryna kill your dignity
Niggas out here gamblin' wit they lives for some publicity

Thuggin' cross the country, from the US to Switzerland
Booted like Shaquille O'Neal

If you want this shit, you gotta be up late
I don't want it now, I want it everyday
Pull up drop top, fully loaded Wraith
Let the Glock pop, it don't hesitate
And I keep the strap on me, just in case
A broke bitch always got somethin' to say
You don't want no money, wanna get laid
I was doin' fraud, I was sellin' lace

(Yo, come on, yo, come on, yo, come on)
I pop the checks and get that money out of state
I be boppin' on yo' nigga like I'm on the stage
Want my nigga home so bad, you know the lawyer paid
And even though you gone, I keep the commissary straight
Slime in the Tahoe ridin' with that SK
No Wells Fargo, nigga, I got big bank
I be rappin' 'bout it, 'cause I'm livin' this way
Top nigga, I been put up in a fish tank
Took that bitch to Chik-Fil-A, she said she wanna steak
They had to let me outta jail for my birthday
This ain't no water gun but when I see you I'ma spray
Mine a sniper, quick to shoot, I fuck with Lil Tay
And this money doin' somethin' to my membrane
Shawty know I love that head, I love that migraine
And I just wanna be new Beyoncé
Crib so big, it's like an arcade

If you want this shit, you gotta be up late
I don't want it now, I want it everyday
Pull up drop top, fully loaded Wraith
Let the Glock pop, it don't hesitate
And I keep the strap on me, just in case
A broke bitch always got somethin' to say

That pussy good but tonight I wanna stick it in yo’ butt though

I mixed the KK with the cookie, stuffed it in my blunt
In the cell with a razor blade in my mat
I don’t shave but I hid the razor in my bunk
Pull up and I don’t honk
Hop out then I dump
My steering wheel on the right, it’s enough room in the trunk
I ain’t gon’ bump the horn or hit the horn when I pull up in yo’ front
Hit it on the porch or in the Porsche, kick it then I punt

He can't even read but he been slinging crack
You better tuck your jewelry, get your chain snatched
I'm tryna slow down, tryna lay back

shake
 back

Pokin windows that's la Jackboy n la J Black
I'm 'bout to wet the Cutlass, fuck a Maybach
Free J Green, they tryna give him 8 flat

 I caught the plane back
If rap don't work, then I'm back up on that same crap
You can leave, baby, you gon' find your way back
He can't even spell, but he can sell dope
Once you come up from that corner, boy you gettin' low
They been lookin' for the boy, think they tryna scope
They gon' pop it, you can lock it, you still gettin' poked
I remember you was ballin', now you dead broke
The last time I seen that nigga, he was smokin'

I just want the money, but they gave me fame too
You ain't really in the hood, I just came through
In the Audi A4 and the paint blue
They gon' love you now but later they gon' hate you

I ain't made the rules, but I break the rules
I was fucked up by that movie, now I'm paid in full
Go 
hard like
 go, go, do your thing boo
Get that money, just don't let that shit done change you
Left the 
high
 early, I ain't go to school
Young nigga bendin' corners in the old school
I just bought a new strap, no that's not my crew
I keep playin' with it, y'all might see me on the news

I'm not a idol, you can have the fame back
I don't wanna hear your music, boy you can't rap
Girl, you been on my dick, since I done came back
I sent you a letter, I ain't get a page back
He can't even read but he been slinging crack
You better tuck your jewelry, get your chain snatched
I'm tryna slow down, tryna lay back
You know that money got me beat, I'm tryna shake back",https://genius.com/Kodak-black-shake-back-lyrics
My Cousin,UnKnown,2017.0,"My cousin just text me and shit (Yeah Free BG, rest in peace Soulja Slim)
He said, ""I just got wet up sitting in my car this morning Cuzzo
I got hit one time but I'm good though (free all my Sniper Gang niggas), just letting you know before these niggas kill me
I love you to death and forever. Let me live on as a real sniper

My cousin just got hit up today, I wanna slide though
Even though I'm on house arrest, I wanna ride though
But I go to prison I know my mama'll cry though
He told me I'm just telling you I love you before I die though

I'm in the studio right now, I'm on album mode
I wanna get suited up and tooted up on sniper mode
Every time a nigga get focused, it be some fuck shit
It throw me off my pivot and make me get on my thug shit
Last year my cousin got hit up and got kidnapped
I wasn't even there but you know a nigga handle that
Hit him up again this year and I ain't feeling that
I'm throwed right now cause I don't know where my feelings at
I don't know if I wanna rap or want to pop a cap
But I know you niggas want to see me go right back
But this sniper gang shit in me, I'm living like that
You niggas about to make me relapse, I'm feeling like that

My cousin just got hit up today, I wanna slide though
Even though I'm on house arrest, I wanna ride though
But I go to prison I know my mama'll cry though
He told me I'm just telling you I love you before I die though

Soldier-like mentality, going through these tragedies
Don't wanna see me happily, rather see me raggedy
They don't wanna see me get a bag, they wanna bag a G
But I go on a clappin' spree and murk ya whole family
I guess a nigga kept it too real, that's why they mad at me
Sitting back thinking right now, I'm smoking Grabba Leaf
Nigga went from wearing baggy jeans to dressing casually
From being on the newspapers, now I'm on magazines
I'm chopping it up with Master P, told me keep God first
We doing venues now, selling out concerts
I'm trying to keep a tunnel vision, trying to see it his way
But I got blood in my eyes, I'm tired of seeing this way
I can't even sleep skraight, even on the Tempurpedic
Why I'm still going through it? Why I'm still fighting demons?
Niggas call you pussy when you focused and avoiding shit
We getting this money for no reason, nigga trying to enjoy this shit
I got a lil' boy and shit, and I don't wanna leave dude
Cause they'll trick him like they did me, that's what these skreets do
Niggas out here playing gangsta and playing police too
I seen the paperwork and that's why they don't kick it like we do
That's the same reason you couldn't come home to seafood
Been moving funny but a nigga just couldn't read you
Beat was been over with, looped it cause I love this beat
Looting for my cousin and my niggas who in custody
I'm feeling like its my fault, feel like it's because of me
Was tryna soak the industry, I already thugged the streets
Did my thing a couple nights, I already earned my stripes
Deeper than rap, they fucking with me cause I'm about that life
You know I'm head first, Big Cuz, that's why you called me man
But if I go to jail again, my mama she gone wash her hands
I'm innovating how to play it but it's still a slim chance
Cause you will sink in the sand in the game without a plan

Aye I swear to God cuz when you called me dog
And you told me that shit dog I said fuck everything
House arrest whatever, you know what I'm saying? 
I went to looking for my AR I couldn't find it you know what I'm saying
You know I fuck with them AR's and shit
Dracos too heavy and shit
Draco's get too hot
That AR got the coolin' center, the heat sensor, know what I'm saying with the scope with the crosshair
And shit I guess it wasn't meant, dog",https://genius.com/Kodak-black-my-cousin-lyrics

Like a runaway slave, ayy

Like a runaway slave
, better run or you get hung
I done walked 'way from some things, I'm a walk off with my son
I just walked off with my son, on top of that he won
I don't talk I got a gun, If we fall off, bitch, we done
Can't fall off, I got funds, I fall off then I'm dumb
Had to run away from my girl, she done ran up out of trust
I done ran up out of love
I done ran up out of love
You said you had enough, 
so I went out to the club
Can't drink 'cause I'm too young, but today I'm getting drunk
So motherfucking tired, been runnin' all my life
Oh, I've been runnin' all my life
Runnin' all my life
Harriet Tubman, I've been runnin' all my life, ayy
I'm standin' at the stretch line
Kunta Kinte, all my life, I had the fire
In the projects, all my life, I had to grind
Young nigga had to hustle to survive
Remember I was underground, now everybody on my line
Put the hood on TV, every day I'm on the rise
I done rescued all my niggas, you ain't gotta slang that iron
They changed on a nigga, so I left they ass behind

Feel like Harriet Tubman
I ain't stop, I kept runnin', they was actin' funny
I said the money train was coming, feel like Harriet Tubman
I was posted on the Ugly, I was caught in tracks
Came back with some money

Tryna do me like I'm 
Emmett Till
Runnin' like a fugitive
Jamestown, Virginia, slavery started and it's still is
2019, we'll be free after 400 years
I done got heartless
Attitude, cognitive
Street took my conscience
Been so long I shed a tear
Blood, sweat in my vent
Everything get a vent
I'm a need bloodshed
Make ya mama shed a tear
You don't care 'bout how I feel
What it took to get right here
Made a lot of sacrifices, yeah
Still I had to fight out here
Haitian revolutionary, but my lady France
Standin' at the stretch line barefoot
I feel like Toussaint, I feel like Boukman
I'm standin' at the stretch line barefoot
They gave my dawg a long sentence, hit him with the textbook
Hit him with the textbook, he can't even read
His family never finna go seem him, 'cause they sent him way up to Creek
The society corrupted we going through modernized slavery
Sell a black male to a plantation
Like a slave master sell a black male to a plantation
Bust a lick, right on Plantation
Double back, hit a lick right on Plantation
What happened to salvation?
Sniper Gang, I'm tryna build a foundation
And I'm runnin' like I'm Harriet Tubman
I'm runnin' like I'm Harriet Tubman
Yeah, I'm runnin' like I'm Harriet Tubman
I'm runnin' like I'm Harriet Tubman
Runnin' like I'm Harriet Tubman
Runnin' like I'm Harriet Tubman
Runnin' like I'm Harriet Tubman
Runnin' like I'm Harriet Tubman
Runnin' like I'm Jesse James
Like I'm tryna get away
Runnin' like a runaway slave
I just wanna runaway
Ain't never ran before, so what's gonna make me run today?
I just want to fly
I just want to fly away, I just want to fly
I just want to fly away-ay

Pelican,Heart Of The Projects,2014.0,"My name Kodak and you know that
Go and tell your girl
Kodak and you know that
Go and tell your friend
Keep that tool on me
Go tell your mama, go tell your buddy
Go tell your pal, go tell your neighbor
Look, I'm Section 8, Taliban

It's that Project Baby, run and tell a friend
Codeine with Xan that's my medicine
Life sentence in the trunk, like a elephant
I don't fuck around, bitch I'm celibate
True to my religion I'm a Reverend
My money long, I might need a measurement
I'm fly, I'm high
Off this cannabis
It's a bird, It's a plane, It's a pelican

Lil Kodak, call me Peter Pan
Yeah, I'm the finesse kid, you can be the man
I gotta master mind, I just came up with a plan
I had to strategize, now I'm getting ten bands
Get it in, got them chickens, like I'm in the den
I poured a four, now I'm leaning like a kick stand
Number one, money blowing like a ceiling fan
I got them drums, nigga, I will hit you whole band
I was stuck, then I took off, now I back again
Nigga, please don't make Lil Kodak, go Super Saiyan
I took a chance, I got tired of eating noodle cans
Young nigga on jiggas, I will never land
Damn I just finessed my own people them
About this business, I hope don't look creep to them
Sour patch, cause these hoes I'm not sweet to them
Stuffed in up my trues, I'm walking with a limp


Jump up out my whip, I pull up like I'm Batman
I just got outta jail, so bring them racks in
It's Lil' Kodak, motion picture, look how I'm flashing
Paparazzi kid, lights, camera, action
I took my tool and now I moving like a fat man
Little nigga, I'm just eating like I'm Pac-Man
I hit the scenes, spread my wings, I be super fly
He don't want it, I ain't worried, I'll shoot the guy
Usually I be polo down to the T
I'm a artist now so I'm dressed in Louie V
Who is he? Wanna drop a track, have fee
Foreign whip, can't pronounce it, got like two or three
Section 8, all this foreign shit is new to me
She don't like me, she in love with my jewelry
Project Baby running crazy, but I'm Cuban linked
Show the streets, because they love it how I do them beats",https://genius.com/Kodak-black-pelican-lyrics
Black Cat (Kunta Kentae),UnKnown,2017.0,"Feel like somebody put a cast on my ass
I'm dropping bad luck, I pull up in the black Jag
Can't fit these shoes, it's seven and a half
I'm focused on my future, I ain't dwelling in the past
Feel like somebody put a cast on my ass
I'm dropping bad luck, I pull up, the black Jag
Can't fit these shoes, it's seven and a half
I'm focused on my future, I ain't dwelling in the past

Same night me and Debo took the Mazda, bih we crashed
Bentley Bentayga, snapping like a lobster fuck a crab
They caught the helicopter, I don't want y'all to think I'm tryna flex
Nigga, what's your f'n problem? I'm on that Effen vodka, smoking gas
Yeah, beep, beep, I'm the nigga roadrunning to that cash
Fuck a frisbee, I'll spin n' bend a nigga like I'm Taz
Fuck my daddy, I can't believe I nutted out your sack
Fuck my daddy nigga, it's me and my momma sons like I'm Nash
I made my son king, put this crown on, fuck a ski mask
I swear to god, I get a hard on when this heat blast
Type it like a spacebar, fuck a keypad, think I keep that Mac
Hot shifter, can't control my pace, command, delete his ass

Feel like somebody put a cast on my ass
I'm dropping bad luck, I pull up in the black Jag
Can't fit these shoes, it's seven and a half
I'm focused on my future, I ain't dwelling in the past
Feel like somebody put a cast on my ass
I'm dropping bad luck, I pull up, the black Jag
Can't fit these shoes, it's seven and a half
I'm focused on my future, I ain't dwelling in the past

I'm hooked on phonics, hooked on Phoenix balling like I'm Steve Nash
Promise you ain't see me, I was in Buffalo with Ray
How you finna cut the hole, y'all just bad
In Charlotte, made a movie with that poker, left a scab
In Raleigh, fell in love with fraud,  on that slazz
Steady scheming, burying cheese and burying pieces in the grass
Controversy between the both supremacies, they gone be mad
Martin Luther King, last night I had a dream about his ass
No Rosa Parks, them shooters posted in the back
Nelson Mandela, rocking Maison Margielas, remember wearing Shaqs
Life's a gamble, play the hands they dealt me I'm a wizard at blackjack
In the Jaguar XF, putting a spell on you late night in the black cat

Feel like somebody put a cast on my ass
I'm dropping bad luck, I pull up in the black Jag
Can't fit these shoes, it's seven and a half
I'm focused on my future, I ain't dwelling in the past

I know that you got me forever
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
You know how to make me feel better
I know that you got me forever

You're the definition of a queen to me
Mama when I see you I see royalty
When I'm broken, you know how to fix it
You know how to check me with the quickness
Anytime I made you mad and pissed you off
Talking back to you when I thought I was wrong
You showed me how to shake off the drama
I'm the woman that I am cause of my mama
Everything good in you is good thing inside of me
I'm just hoping one day I can finally
Say I grew up to make mama proud of me

Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
You know how to make me feel better
I know that you got me forever
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
You know how to make me feel better

Mama you my number one
Never be another one
Ride or die by my side, even when the trouble come
 calamine lotion for the chicken pox
You would even hide the gun for me after lickin' shots
Send a prayer for me everyday, when I hit the block
Used to make me sweep the hallway, then I get the mop
Punishment when I fail, new sneaks when I pass
Only child so I had two feet in my ass
Now I give you the world, yea I'm talkin' long bread
All I want is peas and rice, collard greens, corn bread
Still lookin' good, dead broke or mucho dinero
I appreciate it all you will always be my hero

Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
You know how to make me feel better
I know that you got me forever
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
You know how to make me feel better

Nobody know me like you do
And I don't know how much I need to 
repay
 you
You never wash you hands with me and I thank you
Mama you my 
You the closest thing to Jesus
Know I put you through so much I hate it

This for all my niggas out here, tryna make it shake
Smokin' purple, every mornin' they nigga wake n bake
Poke in windows, early mornin', call it wake n break
Put me in the game, I'm just tryna make a play

When my homie crossed over, had to fade away
This for everybody, grew up off of section 8
Keep your head up, cause you gon' see a better day
Wake n bake, smokin' purple, buzz like a grape
Wake n pray, poking windows, then we in your place
Stephen Curry for the guap, 30 to your face
So much money on my mind, I can't even think
You can't even close your eyes, niggas come and take
Watch the niggas you around, don't you even play
Boy, I swear to God, I just caught another case
Tired of makin' momma cry, stressin', losin' weight
Baby, I can't be your hero, I can't save the day
But, I'm superman fly, with my fuckin' cape

All my niggas hungry, they say they need a plate
Put me in the game, coach, so I can lead the way
I'm just glad to be here, to see another day
Road runnin', gotta get it, any other way
I need a mill', but for now, I need a hunnid K
You gon' get it, if you wait, that's what my momma say
I had dreams of bein' a man, since the second grade
While you niggas gettin' pussy, I'm just gettin' paid
Me and Jackboy, car jackin', switchin' lanes
Yeah, we found a chop shop, took it with a day
Came up, off of cash, for gold snatchin' chains
How I'm finna shine, everybody throwin' shade

Fuck that shit, I'm goin' anyway
Project baby all grown up, I'm a rugrat
Still can't hit the club, and get drunk, but I'm like fuck that
Woke up and I dropped me a deluxe, I'm like plus tax
Teacher tried to put me in timeout, I said, ""fuck class""

You ain't my mama, ho, I ain't gettin' in nun no corner, I said ""fuck class""
Told me say no drugs, nope, you know I upped that
You already know I'm jello, graduated finnessin' got me a lunch rack

Finesse you out your lunch sack
Forgot my bookbag at the crib, but I ain't forget about the dutch pack
Geeked up like a nerd, nigga, test me, you get fucked back
Got them books on me, and just this page I'm readin' right now a hundred racks
Doctor ion take my meds no more right now, it cost me double stacks
Jaguar orange , jansport in the locker
I just seen my old teacher, she still waitin' on her retirement check
Lil homie SAT back, then I had a MAC-10
Said I'm on my way, make sure your babies with there daddy
I ain't no babysitter, but I be kidnappin'
That Glock will shock a nigga, what's that Glock static
Angelica, she suck my testicles, bih so fantastic

Pull up like a diaper

The teacher said, ""it's naptime"", but I am tired of sleepin' on the floor
Dumpin' at them, bagged the nigga, but ion do no fuckin' chores
Let me find out you still at summer camp
I done graduated, now I got a MAC-11
Aye, lemme find out you still at daycare
Put that wooly on that little boy and he shitted on himself
And I'm from the projects
And I keep that permit, don't I keep that permit
I'm a rugrat, little nigga, yeah, don't I keep that Tommy
Don't I keep that Tommy, I said don't I keep that Tommy
And I'm braided up like Chuckie

Love just like death, dawg, it change everything
Money, too
You know I remember going shopping, dawg, without money
And I seen everything I wanted
Now I get all this money, dawg, I go to the mall
I won't see nothing I want
I got everything
You too, my nigga, you hatin', too

First Choo Choo and now you, nigga?
All the hate y'all revealing way overdue, nigga
Ain't gonna lie, I was fooled, thought you was true niggas
I keep real niggas only in my crew, nigga
And none of this money ain't ever new, nigga
But my niggas changed, left me with new niggas
They testin' a kid, I went to school wit' 'em
I'm hangin' with crackers, hangin' with Jew niggas
You wanted a little fame, here it is then

Droppin' hits pussy nigga, I'm a veteran
Still droppin' hits in a Dodge Caravan
I'm smokin' on a pen, I will never land
I'm drinkin' on this Hen', got me arrogant
I'm higher than a bitch, I'm in the air again

He said that them niggas heard about him in my song
Now they 'bout to X him out because I said he told
And if I ain't save his life, that nigga would've been gone
Even though he snitched I told 'em not to do him wrong
Niggas sneak diss then they go to calling my phone
'Cause all I care 'bout: my kids, I don't care 'bout my future

And I ain't pay a nigga 6 bands to touch you, boy
My niggas ain't even worried about the money, boy
My niggas do it 'cause they love the boy
And now I do it for free I don't need no reward
And now I do it, just me, I don't need no support
And I don't play basketball, so I ain't goin' to court
See em when you see me we be like a pair
She love me to pieces, I love her to death
I woke up seen a demon dancin' with the Devil
I woke up seen a demon dancin' with the metal
She love me forever, she made me a lil better
She fly just like my sweater, I never forget her
I'm turnt up in the air, I be on the pill
I took off on a pill, I be in the air
Push a nigga head back, cut his hair
Snatch her lace wig off, she ain't got no hair
Know my momma good and my brother doing great
And my son good
God fucked around and saved me

Bitch look like I'm whippin' up
Wrist look like a million bucks
But it's just a quarter mill

Diamonds on my ear just so I could hear

As many she want Never let them see you weak stand up let me tell you something""

Picture me, riding in the two seat faded
When I came from the hood where most
Niggas don't make it
Kodak Black, Molly caps
With a Asian model feeding me grapes
Now picture that imagine this
Panamera Jim Carrey sheraton hotel
My bitch dipped in mascara Oooh
Foreign ride me and Polo poo in the Coupe
Top back, only two seats
Used to mask up lace my sneaks
Now round Tables f.b.g have a feast
Grew up in these streets
Turned the kid into a beast
Tryin' to get this meal, we gon' eat
Pull up in the hood giving shit to the kids
So they don't have to rob for it, like I did
Blowed basketball, AAU
You got me fucked up
I'll blow this rap shit too
They said I won't make it, my pride you can't take it
I won't fake it till I make it
Shouts out to Tribulation
That ain't break me either
Close friends acting strange that can't break me either

Never Imagine this cause I ain't have a pot to piss
Or a window to throw it out of
But picture this
At the top from the bottom
Even though they doubt us


They doubted me
Said I'm gon' blow it, ain't tryna blow it
My pain I never show it
They want my spot I know it
Said I was gon' be in that County Jail
15 cold cell, no bond, no bail
God sent the train I ain't jump on his trail
And I know Purp And Wayne watching us down here
Thinking to myself like there's God out there
But I got to thank him
Cause i'm still out here
Never thought of me, big offices
The same jit used to run from them officers
Came from the ugly corner to the spotlight
Let my niggas flex to get my spot right
Free bands, finesse plans
Willie in my mama kitchen whippin' like a chef chem
Pyrex pots he good with his left hand
Def jam, even the deaf jam
Even the deaf hear him, even the blind see him
The paralyzed feel him, nigga onomatopoeia
T-Burn snitched he got him a deal nigga
Once I get my deal nigga, it's gon' get real nigga
Yeah I'm a real nigga
I just wanna live nigga
Can't take no losses
I'm a lil nigga
Paranoid pop a nigga like a pill
Nigga keep my lil seal nigga
Imagine when I get a deal nigga

Never Imagine this cause I ain't have a pot to piss
Or a window to throw it out of
But picture this
At the top from the bottom
Even though they doubted


Somebody call the paramedics
Life done gave me all this pain and ain't came with anesthetic Thuggin' graveyard where i'm heading
We busting and fucking over niggas
Dawg I don't regret it, they deserve it
I can take it I ain't havea pot to piss in
I had a pop when he was always sick
And I was outchea trying to fit in
I'm fucking with these niggas from a distance
I rap but you niggas pay attention
A gun is my bestfriend
Father God won't you send me a blessing
From robbing now I'm rapping, It's destined
Section 8, I swear to God it gets treacherous
Only reason that my mama been stressing
I've been up against the odds
Even when it's dark
Even when it's raining and 
Even when it's hurting ain't no sense in me complaining
Cause it's destined
We gon' make it",https://genius.com/Kodak-black-never-imagine-lyrics

That project baby two, hell yeah
But right now, this that institution
Yeah, for real man
For all that time I was down, man
They said I caught 11 years, man
Fuck that shit, look it, man
I do this shit bad, on the real, nigga
I never seen the work, dawg

Look, this for all that time when I was lost, they left me stranded
See, I don't even do this for myself, this for my family
I made a lot of mistakes, made it off circumstances
That could've ruined my life, I'm bout to sign with Atlantic
Look, God be lookin' out for me, he gave me several chances
I sent him a lot of prayers, he sent me a lot of places
My momma said ""Imma make it"" told me that it's destined
I put in a lot of work, and now my dreams manifestin'
Project baby, I cultivated, do somethin' amazin'
I pulled up, all that bullshit, I just couldn't take it
I thought it was over for a minute, a bad situation
I was so far away from home, but I just emancipated
I'm just so captivated, that I could be here again
So fascinatin', to see my people again
Swear I tried to leave the streets, but they was pullin' me in
My nigga rolled a statement on me, I thought he was my friend
I can't even pretend
I love to jump on these beats
Tell my fans what I'm feelin' deeply inside of me
This what's inside of me, y'all a big part of me
I'm sorry for leavin' y'all, this my apology
I just hope y'all believe it, got trues and paid dues
But it ain't easy as queasy, it's like I'm here for a reason
I just hit rock bottom, I thought everything was sweet
But many niggas so sour, man
My cousin had me sellin' powder, I was bumpin' em off
We used to bag em up, and keep it all at my momma house
All my niggas out there livin', just keep livin' it up
All my life, in the projects, I was livin' it rough
When I was down and out, ain't nobody really gave a fuck
They ain't really down with you, they only down when you up
I used to be that cafe fit, the full holster in the cut
A young nigga, sixteen, with Remy in my cup
I had to take a Gatorade, braid, ran to these streets
I had to cut my niggas, showin' they were playin' for keeps
That's all a nigga has to tell ya, they were leechin' on me
I ain’t even charging them, getting fame for free
When I was in a sticky one, they ain't show no support
Before I learned how to swim, I jumped straight off the porch
We know a nigga from the south, hittin' licks up in north
I used to play ball, but now I'm in a whole other court
I'm married to the game, we ain't never tryna divorce
Fell in love with the game, I gave a bitch intercourse
Oh, you thought this shit was over with? Nigga you crazy
Kodak Black, I bounce back, like a foreigner baby
Boy this ain't no fugaze, run it back, yeah it's true
Ain't none of this no fugaze, what I be spittin' to you
Cuz I just get in the booth
And I be spittin' the truth
How I be spittin' to you, you think I'm missin' a tooth
How I be whippin' the coupe, you think I'm missin' no roof
Catch me playin' with the chick, like cock a doodle doo
I was out there on the jigga, call your boy jiggaboo
I ain't talkin' cereal, but I be gettin' the loop

I be ten toes down everyday, bruh
I try to maintain, let my nuts hang
It's the same thing young nigga, same thing (selling dope)
I'm stayin' patient, waiting on a blessin'
Rather hit the studio than a class session
Hell raisin on ya boy since 97

Hearing these voices in my head just can't ignore em
Lord help i got eviction letters stuck at my door
I done lost my mind i was kicking doors down DA want me direct file
She say I'm punishable by life
Nowhere to go so I'm in the dope pole and its getting cold
Nowhere else to go because my home just ain't home
Man my daddy out there having fun and I'm own my own
Jit gotta get right man live my life so wrong
Nigguhs tryna earn stripes so i ride all night with my chrome
And these crackers steady harassing me won't leave Lil Black alone
Man i was dropping chicos for a mil now I'm dropping songs
I get on these pills and ooh i get in my zone
I was raised round hobos 44s getting chased by the popos
Man i remember sleeping in them stolos
Dat project baby youngest nigguh out the camp
Wilding and cool ooh where would i be without them?
Just listen to me man Im'a tell yaw how it is
Im'a hit the booth tell the truth this how i feel
Ain't changing for no industry this how i live
If I keep rapping this shit for the streets i don't need no deal
And i miss my nigguh Croshawn he go hard
Shoutsout to John-John he taught me how to shoot that ball
And Angelo that my nigga though he taught me how to work that pistol
Then my nigga died and i miss him lost my nigga to the system
We was used to war, we was poppin' off takin' cars ya'll playin' around in the park
Thug holiday rest in peace Lil Purp its true them demons gone for real truth hurts
Okay just one more pill I'm on the lurk and if I'm ya boy then god tell me why i feel so cursed
And i get down and pray and pray but it just don't work
And I'm comin' to you wit my pain but it just gettin' worse
Ain't nothin' funny why you laughin'? Nigguh wipe yo smirk Man they took lil Wayne head out his foreign riding and it hurts And all them memories turn fantasy now they on a shirt
Took em off this earth just to go n put em off in the dirt
I'm a rock the verse, Swear to god Im'a put this rap shit first Even when my pockets hurt and I'm feelin' like snatching a purse
But im go hold on just gotta hold on to my dreams
Can't let my dream fade away no way i never sleep
Committing these felonies asking god for a sign am i blind to what you tellin me?
You joking boy? You better be
Cuz I whine to you when I cry to you and get on my swellin' knees
And this all that you got here for me?
But how would it be? If i would've took the good route?
And put my foot down? And shake that monkey off my hook now?
Now how would it be?
How would it be?",https://genius.com/Kodak-black-thug-holiday-freestyle-lyrics

Off A 14,UnKnown,2014.0,"On my lonely, scoping, poking
Crackers had to rope me

First i started off, with a 14
Then i worked my way up to a whole thing
I remember i was just 14
Soaked the game up, from sitting around the OG's
Ten toes down, i'm on my own feet
I ain't fucking with ya, if you owe me
I can't love a hoe, i love my OG
Cause love will get you killed, that's what she told me
I don't gang bang, but i'm a banger
But when i twist my fingers, i throw K's up
You ain't talkin' money, gotta hang up
Serving all my junkies, off my pager

Damn, i was in a jag, now i pull up in a Lamb
Abracadabra, that work go kazam
Fuck your baby-mama, kick her out, i call a pam
Finessing's all i know, i be quick to pull a scam
Jumpin' out your house, you can call me Rob Van Dam
All these molly's bagged up, look like M&M's
E-murder on the same shit, i'm on like synonyms
I need my bread first, i don't worry 'bout the ham
So why i hate to see them flockas taking over bam
Free my brother cool, i can't wait  till I can see him
I started off finessing and i went hard
I told my mama imma' be a damn star
In this rap shit everybody flawed
I want all my money, save the damn talk
Dont make me start back, the way i left off
I found me a connect ain't talking X-Box
Then i copped a 4 in a baby
Slim white girl- i call her shady
Stick and move, you know i'm on probation
My P.O. be with the woo, but she dont face me
Youngest out the projects, i'm the baby
Mama brought me here, my mama flew from Haiti
Damn i had to let the streets raise me
I ain't have no other choice, the streets made me
I be sippin lean it keep me lazy
Like a flower- that codeine had me daisy
24 grams call me Bailey
I just want to thank the lord, 'cause he saved me
I was caved in on my lonely
Like a sad dog i had to roam free
Stop that dick ridin', you dont now me
Young nigga i be balling like Ginobili",https://genius.com/Kodak-black-off-a-14-lyrics

Steady wrapped in chains
Jail back and forth (for that money)
I was going insane
Had nowhere to go (for that money)
They calling me names
They cracking jokes (it ain't even funny)
Back when I was lame
Was nobody close (nobody close to me)
Told lil mama blow
Niggas ain't believe me (but they ain't listening)
My mixtape free
But they be tryna buy my CD (tryna buy my CD)
I was out here scheming
Talking to those demons (to them demons)
They say I'm arrogant
Say I'm so conceited (I'm conceited)
You should be happy
I was blind now I'm seeing (ain't shit to see)
Nightmares going crazy
Ghetto dreaming (when I was dreaming)
When I was itching for that money
Out here fiending (I'm out here fiending)
Somebody feed me
Because my stomach steady screaming (know i need it)
Now you want some fame
Coming up you can't believe it (fame off of me)

My nigga Mark got indicted, that was the money man (Man)
The money gone, now the hood turnt to Zombie Land (Lah)
These lil' bitches sellin' pussy for the thirty piece
These niggas droppin' bodies like they never heard of peace
Niggas stood over Duke, shot him in his face (Uh)
When you been through what I been through it be hard to pray (For real)
Get a lawyer, ten K and still lost the case (Lah)
Jumped in the game and understood the risks that we would take (Facts)
Ran down on the opp, the .40 jammed on me (Damn)
I say, ""Damn, boy, somebody must be prayin' for homie"" (For real)
Had my shell, hustle down, but him hard body
Go to my hood and ask about me, they gon' tell ya (They gon' tell ya)
Young and body full of tattoos, the war wounds (Ayy)
Young and got it out the mud, and he refuse to lose (Lah)

Say he's a warrior (Oh)
He can do anything (He can do anything, oh)
Say he's a vulture, he can fly (He's a vulture)
He can do anything (He can do anything, anything)
See I'm a vulture, hear my cry (I'm a vulture)

Start some beef with me, boy, it'll be over any day
And my plug, he come from Italy, yeah he keep me paid
Everyday I'm sippin' on remedy, yeah I keep that drank
They need to free my dogs literally 'cause they in a cage
I fuck with youngins sometimes
You straight, but you got crooked ways
Life's a gamble, crushin' beans all in my ace of spades
Know I used to fuck with Sheen 'til I heard he gay
I heard a nigga stuck a broom right up his dirty ass
And, I be on a molly sippin' Grand Marnier
And, I don't like nobody, so get out my face
And, I be out here wilin', bitch, I'm young and violent
Aye, I'll get out my body, I get out my lane
I be way in Venus, I get out my space
The Devil, he be creepin', get him out my space

Niggas be like bitches, they be throwin' shade
Bitch, get out my face, don't like them anyway
Bitch, I'm gettin' money on pills, and I got laid
I'm like a horse on hay, I'm talking Mary Jane
Like Miami keep that Heat but I’m in Pompano
Nigga come 'round playin', snipers make you hit the floor
Stay strong, nigga
Bitch, I'm on my 10 toes

Front a nigga, call it ""dope on layaway""
Ship it through FedEx, sell it on Ebay
My goons goin' crazy, they goin' insane
Mention my name, I'm aimin' at yo' brain

Little nigga doing things that you never dreamed
Ok I'm on like Tray and Loopay

I swear you can get money in a lot of ways
You ain't gotta sell drugs to get them pockets straight
I'm on a positive vibe
I had a long day
Keeping my money right, right by the wrong was
Niggas hollering money they ain't worth a penny though
No religion, my niggas worship the semi though
Niggas claim real, they wearing stilettos though
You know I'm married to the money I can't let it go
Wait till send my nigga Angelo home
Other day I was talking to my cousin Bone
He said do your thing, hear you snapping on this song
Told him I love you cuz
Hold your head stay strong
He told me keep it up conversation on the phone
That's what it is, light switch cut a nigga on

You be on some  shit, in love with her body
She gon' fuck the whole crew, you gon' say I'm lying
She gon' suck the dick while my lil' nigga behind it

Get up in the game, fuck it up like a virus
Swear you Tyler Perry, your girl calling me Byron

Ohh My pockets fat, 'bout to put it on a diet
I'm on like the song
Hope they call my phone
Because before when I was old

My niggas they on the cut
They tryna' get it up
I get it live like a slut
Tony Hawk, I'ma stunt

He wanna see me win
When I make it he gon' have them chickens bumping like a pen
Shout out to everybody who fuck with lil' Black
And I fuck with everybody 'cause they fuck with me back
In the hood I can't sleep
Shit I gotta eat
Get on the beat
Don't let it breathe
My wrist game mean
My neck on bling
My roster full straight shooters on my team
Had to reup 'cause there was losers on my team
My lil' niggas got pieces like wings

My dog Wesley he go crazy for the weed
Yeah he a fiend, still fuck with em' though
And I fuck with  'cause he fuck with me mo'
And I ain't brazy 'bout this money, she in love with me mo'

Set my head head hot, like a perm
Was a jailbird, but they set me free, so the early-bird got the worm
I've been up, but I've been down
I was stuck, but I've been 'round
Pokin' windows, way outta town
I was lost, but now I'm found
These streets showed me how to be a man, cuz my dad wouldn't show me how
But it's too late to show me now
Cuz I'm in too deep with this lifestyle
Lord forgive me for that abortion, I wasn't ready to have no child
I was hittin' my girl with a bare dick, I ain't even have no lifestyle
Been out here, since a lil child
They safari, runnin' wild
Got felonies all in my file
Got me back n' forth, in the juvenile
Had to take my eyes off the prize, real quick
But, now my eyes on the prowl
I was hittin' licks, cuz I was on my dick, stayin' at my aunties house
Tryna stack them them racks in a pile
When I rap, they be like ""wow""
I can't even have no friends no more, so tired of them rattin' me out
Keep my head high, to the clouds
I stay hot, on that loud

Look, I'mma stay ten toes down
Gotta keep my head on a swivel

Young niggas, high riska's
Everyday, on the go
Already got a lil money, still out here tryna get more
This shit like shootin' dice, they just tryna hit a lick
Dope boys, they up all night, they just grindin' for a brick
I'm tryna stay out the mix
These niggas ain't real
These niggas go down, they'll snitch
Trust me, I know the deal

Blood in and out, like a tampon
Hood niggas forget the goal is to make it out
I been here forever, I'm tired of this dang spot
I was built to still grind when the rain drop
I still see them dark skies when the rain stop
And I was on the block 'till the daylight
Hit the  off his whip
Now I'm on the same bike
It's Lil Black on a stroll, all this damn white
Mosquitos, they eat me up, I start a campfire
I was 13, I met Ray
I was rackin' up the gold, I was seein' him every day
I was gettin' real greedy, now I'm shackled in them chains
Knew I had to pay the price, but I ain't really want to pay
What I'm doin' wasn't right but I ain't really want to pray
'Cuz I get down and close my eyes and I ain't be knowing what to say
Told me, ""Stay in school"", I'm not confused that just ain't what I wanted
I'd rather jump on all these beats, look what I do on 'em
First I cut back 3 and put 2 on it
Dj  Turned to murder, made the news on 'em
I was jammed, not knowin' what he gon' do
Week later, he in my room, I feel like putting my blues to him
Lil Dj was always my lil goon, but he told me that it's my fault
'Cuz I taught the rules to him
He had my pistol, dang, ain't know he was gon' shoot sum
Locked down, I had niggas giving they food to him
See, I put 'bout 5 on it, but I really had 10
Now I got 5 more
Jackboy wrote me, said he gon' be out shortly
Wrote me again, sayin' he got 9 more
Yeah, I be tryin' to catch my dreams with the lights on
Niggas schemin', so I ain't sleepin' with my eyes closed
Nigga I'm livin', what I live for I die for
I could walk around my projects blindfolded
Now I'm in the stolo, me and Lil Sodo
I had 5, I put 1 on it now I got 4 more
I'm that type of youngin', I be runnin' with the pistol
I be with the older niggas, I ain't runnin' with no Jits
See, they be dead broke, they be lookin' for a fix
While they was running 'round in a ditch, I was runnin' off with the sticks
I was at CL, 8th grade, me and PL
E Pimp told me pass him half a molly, on the DL
I was looking for a sign, I couldn't really see well
Then I'm lookin' for a plug, numbers low, retail
Had to switch my grind, 'cuz these crackers know my detail
Life's a beach
Pistol to yo' ear like a seashell
They ain't really know I was finessin'
Puttin' 4 on it
I was on codine, on that 
Movin' slow on it
Money comin', bustin' dick hard, I got yo' ho on it
You givin' me rides, and you ain't know I got my pistol on me
All my niggas criss cross, cross crissin' on me
Switchin' on me, lost and found, they went missin' on me
Was on my team, substitutin', went to pitchin' on me
But no, I ain't trippin' homie
I'm gone be the one, I knew that since I was 'bout 1

My young niggas on a bean and they goin' wild

I can't hear nothin' you said, cause I'm smokin' loud
I was put in by a cell, but I'm home now
I done made it through the struggle, now I'm goin' viral

Lil' homie on his dick, he 'bout to go en route
He just tinted up the rental, now he northbound
And once he touchdown with them bands, man it's goin' down
He hit the dentist puttin' every dime in his mouth
I might need a referee, these niggas so foul
If you ain't callin' 'bout no money, nigga don't dial
I stay on my P's and Q's
, I'm ten toes down
I just left from out the U cause the Trues out
My lil' nigga DJ wil' he need to slow down
Out here wit his shirt off walking with his pole out
I stay humble, I've been grindin' for forever
Just got out last month and I'm applyin' pressure

Sick spot, Boosie this, Boosie that, I'm the shit now
My clothin' line on fire, a nigga really straight
Check out my wrist game, bitch

In Magic City, throwin' fifties a nigga really wildin'

In 09' I went viral, I'm talkin' 8 bodies
I took crumbs and made profit
Now I got it and I'm viral

Shit crazy, a nigga came up slow though man you know
I tried every little hustle out here to get that bread

Came up slow, all off a caret of gold
I remember kicking doors, me and D's all hands stole
I remember we was poor, had to go get some dough
Cuban link on glo, polo, whip, my pants low
I'm too fly for you, I'm seeing through a birds eye view
I won't lie to you, she bald-headed like Caillou
All this time you was living in the skies
But now a nigga seeing right through
I'm the one gonna ride for you
I'm the one who came through
There was nobody else around
Let this shit change you, I'm the one gon hold you down
Look what we done been through, just think about everything
Thought you was my round, fuck the money fuck the fame
Ran out my wonder pain, I can't see a damn thing
My heart so cold I got ice running through my veins
Crazy how things change, you were just here yesterday
I just caught another case, I'm asking God for better days
Hit my knees and pray, forgive me for my selfish ways
I ain't mean no harm, I was tryin' get it straight
I was tired of second place, I was tryin' win the race
I just hope you understand, everyday's a paper chase
Everyday a damn struggle, you don't bother you in trouble
Thuggin' wit my brothers, on my life and the gutter
Crazy how things go, young nigga from Pompano
Can't go to jail no more, remember eating Sloppy Joe

I've been there before, is you a friend or a foe?
What you round me for? Keep it real let me know
I've been there before, is you a friend or a foe?
What you round me for? Keep it real and let me know

I had ups and downs, times that with no one around
Told me stay humble, but I just didn't know how
I was just down bad, crazy I'm on now
Wanna see me locked up, its a blessing I'm home now
Deeper than zone pound, young nigga ten toes down
I be in my own lane, I go on my own route
Thras got me dumb hot, feeling like I'm on cloud
I was running wild, living fast had to slow down
I was in denial, feeling is in my foul
Fell victim to the system, free cool I really miss him
Taught me not to be a fool, young nigga keep the tool

What you expect? For me to never come out of house?
Pop a X with my niggas, late night poppin' bottles
Just wanna hit the store and a buy bottle of some water
Post up on the stroll and hear what I been missing out on
My nigga say he went to rehab but he got right back on flocka
My other nigga popped a c class then that pussy came up out 'em

What you mean why I ain't pay for this beat? 'Cause ima motherfucking robber
I was in Fort Myers I was 15, and I was servin' Demi Lovato

If I was him I woulda' beat me to the floor
Then that nigga started creepin' very slow
That nigga he started leavin' very slow
Started skipping, giggling away like it’s hilarious
Yeah he protected, but he still scared of me
I was just 14 years old, I'm on methamphetamine
Y'all just sittin' 'round smokin' weed and watching Netflix
Every day I wanna do somethin' hot, in a stolo for no reason
Parked it in a vacant spot, and they towed 'cause I left it parked right in my neighbor lot, ay
I put that burner on that nigga, told him if he make one more move he gettin' popped
I dare you nigga, take one more step you gettin' stretched out
I customized a 38, it got a drum like I'm 
That was my last lick, but this my next stop
That was my last lick, but this my next stop
 my window roadrunning, got this rental here from Hertz

I got snakes on my Gucci, but not in my yard
I got that bag got that guwop, bought a icy watch
Shoutout to Convertible Burt
Florida boy, Florida boy, Florida shit

Can y'all please let me roll in peace, I'm smoking purp
My nigga said if he go to prison, he get the jury gone
All you rappers really be nerds with some jewelry on
Don't be remixing my shit, that wasn’t X’s song
Don't remix my shit, that's a nigga track
When I remix, I re-rock your shit like whipping crack
I drop a seven in a pot, and stretched me ten back
I just pulled a bag out a Cartier box
Pulled up to the dumpster, threw away some bank cards
Road running duffling
Yea I got that laundry
Rolling on a monkey
My car look like a pumpkin
In and out of juvenile, every day we rumbling
Bunky trynna sleep, I singing rest in peace Slim Dunkin
My bitch she got on MAC
Keep her face done
I'm sliding with the MAC
I got to stay with one
Don't remix my shit
Don't remix my shit, you can't ride the beat like me
All you niggas ain't shit, you niggas ain't in these streets

My Time,UnKnown,2017.0,"Yeah, yeah (Kodak)
Yeah, yeah (You know dat)

Way before my time, I was catchin' planes, hustlin' tryna make a wave
For me and my family (me and my family)
Way before my time, I was grindin', no choice but the trap
Then a nigga found rap, I ain't never goin' back
'Cause it's my time, yeah
It's my time, you don't see it, then you blind
'Cause it's my time, yeah
It's my time, Rolly told me it's my time
'Cause it's my time, yeah
On my grind, I can't work no nine to five
'Cause it's my time, yeah
It's my time, if I'm lyin', then I'm flyin'

I'm tryin' not to get locked up back again
Had to take a lot of losses just to win
I was young, jumped in that water, been swimmin' ever since
Then I drowned, I never noticed how deep that I went
Head first, ain't waste no time, I dive right in
And life's a bitch, she spread them legs, I slide right in
This ain't a game, I'm runnin' 'round eatin' like Pac-Man
Fuck the fame, I knew I was a star since back then
Way back then, was gettin' them chips like Low-So
I think I'm way before my time, say I got a old soul
With the grown folks, shootin' dice by the dope 
I got ice runnin' through my veins, my heart just so cold

Way before my time, I was catchin' planes, hustlin' tryna make a wave

'Cause it's my time, yeah
It's my time, if I'm lyin', then I'm flyin'

It's a shame how much pain I brought my mama through
I just want to get her a new Range, maybe one or two
Me and all you niggas ain't the same, I ain't one of you
Homie you a lame, you can't hang with this money crew
Lately I ain't been gettin' no sleep, I'm just 
One day you'll wake up and your dream right in front of you
How you tellin' all your homies you can't even tell time?
They been sleepin' on the kid, it ain't even bedtime
I been goin' hard, I'm on the grind, ain't no spare time
And I keep the tool in the trunk like a spare tire
Way back, hittin' licks with my clique spazzin' out
 cashin' out

Hell yah bih, Koly we got another one

Look, I'm tryna stay afloat
And keep my head above  water, you could say a boat
See I don' lost a lot of shit, but I didn't lose hope
They tryna pull me in the system, wanna see roped
But now they tellin' me, 
""Jit you the next to blow""
I'm comin' up, I got the rap game in a choke
I don' trust a nigga, they'll try to play ya close
Can't be fuckin' with these bitches, cause they love to do the most
It's the white man world, no love for black folks
It's still a dirty world, ain't no point tryna vote
A different president, but it's the shit thought
Ferro should of took the plea, but he took it to the door
I'm tryna make it, but they hatin' on the kid
I got an ice box, where my heart used to live
A nigga cross, I'ma double cross him
A nigga like me, don't forget or forgive
I'm the type of nigga come run up in your crib
Nigga tellin' on you, now you want the nigga killed
Bill keep the steel, I just wanna live, got evicted, so I had buy my mama a crib
I remember when, we was strugglin', shit, I had to move in with my cousin them
I don' see my friends from yesterday, none of them
Now I think about, it used to be a couple of them
Shit I ain't gon' lie, I learned a lot of stuff from them
God damn, I should've listened to my mama them
See the other side and I don' say what's up to them
But he fuck with them and I don' really fuck with them
Sharper than a trim
Jumpin' out the gym
24 Karot Gold dip on my rim
Now I'm gettin' older, now life kickin' in
Told mama look, I'm finally growin' hair on my chin
Mama your lil boy, just became the fuckin' man
I just dropped the 14, it came back lookin' 10
I just popped a bean, now I'm going Super Saiyan
You'll sink like the sand in the game without a plan

See this the type of shit I live
And what these niggas rappin' we don' already lived
I heard through the grapevine that Kodak got a deal
See we been on our grind since Nova donk was teal
I'm tryna touch a mil
And buy my mama them a crib
We rappin' about this shit we really live
So nigga straight up, them country boys better play us
Mention Broward County, better say us
See we didn't have shit, but a God-fearing mother
You ever see them suds in the tub tryna bubble
Them hoes show us love, but they don' know about the struggle
My aunty died with AIDS and Lord knows that I love her
I remember going broke with no clothes and no cover
Not to mention they killed Wayne and Purp, them my brothers
I been on my grind serving dime to them cluckers
My phone kang wanging and my trap going bonkers
I'm 10 toes down, with a 9 I'll slump you
Call up my lil round from out of town, he'll pump you
Get rich or die trying, so my mindframe is fuck you
Your chain look like mine, I ain't lying, I'll touch you
Coach these niggas crying on the line, call the huddle
And it's fuck a nigga, and my mindframe is fuck you
It's 24 boom, and Polo Pooh he comin' soon

4th of July,UnKnown,2017.0,"See there's pussy niggas everywhere
Gutter niggas everywhere
You niggas buy that shit or whatever
Yall already know niggas about they issue

I was fucking with you strong, what's the issue?
What you wanted? A lil song or a picture?
You say somebody hit your phone like it's pressure
So we'll just fuck it dog, I thought that we was better
What you wanted? A lil shoutout, a lil publicity?
If you asked me i would've did it with no resistance
You made a dis song and now you in your feelings
Running around telling niggas, they wouldn't listen
Yea you niggas bout that life, but we more realer
Everytime you pull a play, we pull one bigger
Yea you niggas bout that too, but we some lunatics
Man you niggas should've thought before you do the shit
Tried to shoot a video on my corner but we shoot the shit
If you a bitch now tell the media that you a bitch
I don't tweet, I tell that nigga pull up bring some food
All my zombies in the projects will devour you
And it's easy to keep the tool but you don't know how to move
And you niggas ain't strategic, and you moving loose
My nigga caught him at the wrong time with the .22
Go this a .22
I ain't specifically talkin bout you Heffer
You niggas ain't got no balls, ain't got no testicles
You niggas pussy, ain't got no balls ain't got no pelvis
Cuz if you was a man you wouldn't be jealous
Yall done brought it to a whole other level
Niggas getting kidnapped and getting let go
Niggas only did that just to scare you
To tell the truth if I was there you would've been dead bro
And I feel like it's a blessing I'm on house arrest bro
Cuz you niggas already know a nigga hit first
My cousin just got hit up and it fucked my head up
I was ready to rock and roll, come find my heavy metal
I ask my people ""why you move my gun when I went to jail for?""
This house arrest might be a blessing, might be better
What the hell happened to that 187
On another note you niggas should've know better
Niggas know we ain't the niggas to be fucked with
But you niggas out here smoking on that fuck shit
Oh you know we them niggas from the project
Oh you know we them niggas we them zombies
And you know we them niggas boy we about it
And you niggas gookin' right now smokin mollies
If yall wasn't smoking mollies y'all would know the deal
How you going against the will
And I don't call deuces, I call .30s
And I can't believe Bushawn that nigga dirty
Yea you bout that shit you live it but you workin
I don't care what you did I tell a nigga you workin
I keep having visions about these niggas getting wet up
How the hell you can't tell me bout the set up?
And I don't cop no pleas unless I'm jammed up
The only way you talk to me is about some cheddar
I'm swimming in the pool with my beretta
I been learning moves dancing with the devil
Damn I heard you ain't wanna let the Draco spray
Why the hell you even got it anyway?
I don't even know why niggas gotta be
You should've came with bloods you just wannabe
How you rhyme with a nigga who stripped you out your jeans?
Man I ain't forgivin a nigga who had you on your knees

Everybody under disguise man they scheming
These hoes will set you up
Tell you they love you they don't mean it
Full of syrup, bitch I'm leaning
Smoking dope with the demon
Send my younging at your little nigga give me a reason
I heard a nigga say they turned me up, get off a nigga dick
Don't like the fact that now I'm blowing up, nigga get on your shit
I got turned on next Montana ain't nobody give me shit
Bitch I bought my own car, started my own dealership
Cruising down Florida with my burner leaning faded

I'm that ratchet jay baker rap maniac
Where's that? Pockets fat
Hit my first lick I don't know how to act
New cracker say I look like lil Boosie
And plus I rock the Boosie
They call me Boosie, they say I'm so easy to catch
They say I'm ADHD, schizophrenic
My pistol panic, it just be firing
Get nervous, I can't handle it
Project Baby, and you know that I am him
My nigga found me, he was with me shootin' in the gym
I was settin' him up for 3's, but I was scorin' more than him
He wanted to be the team, grabbed my ball straight off the rim
My main bitch be trippin'
She not my main, but the only reason she my main cause I ain't got no other bitches
I be stolo slidin' foreign
She be nervous when she in it

Don’t Understand,UnKnown,2014.0,"I be feeling like nobody understands me

Don't know what I'm saying and if I tell you bro, you still won't feel my pain

When I get out of these streets and do the same things

I tried to explain, I swear, I tried to explain
Think lil Kodak got it good, cause the money and the fame
I got to leave the street where it's at, fell in love with the game
Studio night and day, now they say I ain't the same or I changed, cause I don't, come to my side no more and play
I don't shoot dice no more, cause I ain't got time to hang
They say I'm going insane
They say the mollies eating up my brain
I miss my nigga Cool
Like right now, I'd be with him chasing money and be running with'em
I just tried get'em with you
They water break
I'm tired of fake niggas, I'd let you walk in my shoes but you can't fit'em
Hard for a project baby
Sometimes I hate, I let the project raise me
I'm a bastard child, so the streets made me a man

Take me through this battle, but I not gonna let you leave
Send them haters around me and I won't let'm leave
Need a break just fall back and get my mind straight
Feeling like the devil took me on a blind date
I ain't coming home tonight when I'm on a mission
Niggas feening and I'm the only youngin with'em
Somethings I be tripping
Folks say I'm a ghetto child, they say I'm ignorant
Just listen
I might need a minute
I hope this beat was long, cause I need them to hear me
Can't make the lemonade, life just gave me lemons
Feel like they don't understand
They don't get it
I've been up all night
I just had to lay this verse down to clear my mind
I can't believe I thought you were my friend
Here I am in the move bleed my soul again

Molly Pt. 2,UnKnown,2014.0,"They say I'm the golden one
Ooh, Lil Kodak, you the
Man, why you always pokin’ stuff?
Lil Kodak, you know it

Oh my God, I'm rollin', molly got me geekin’
Man, I can't control it, think I'm seein' demons
I went out the orbit, I went way to Venus
I'm so paranoid, let me talk to Jesus
Man, everybody on the meetin'
She kick right in, I think she won't never leave me

Rollin' cavaliers, got me way in Cleveland
God damn, I can’t feel my face
How did I land far up outta space?
I need them bands, I can’t concentrate
Who's in my head? Can you go away?
I light my Black and Mild, so she can stay
Damn, what can I say?
They told me to take off, I had to take
Feel like Superman, I need me a cape

Spacemobile coupe, I’m rollin' in the beam
Damn, I'm goin' crazy, I can’t go to sleep
Went the Milky Way, I shoulda got a piece
Ow, went the Milky Way, I shoulda got a piece
Molly 2, wait for part 3
Went the Milky Way, I shoulda got a piece
I'm feelin' like I'm Louis Armstrong
Audemars glow, Jesus charm on
I'm high, y'all low
Can't go where I go, Astronaut zone
Hit the light, oh
And now I want every car I put my eye on
And now I'm out here schemin', that .45 chrome
God, I'm grown, need that 
Uh, money on my mind, my mind gone
Chop shop, get the guap long
Had to drop my top low
I'm outta here
Diamonds shinin' on my bright, it look like chandelier
My bitch red, she look like Rudolph the Reindeer
I'm in a spear, ain't no lackin' here
I'm hittin' 360s, I took off last year
This that Molly part 2, so turn on the lights
Cause I'm lookin' for you, and they lookin' for you too
You the shit, I put the diaper on you
Niggas talkin' shit, I put them snipers on you
I'ma cypher on you, put my rifle on you
I tend to catch a sugar rush, shit get so hyper on you
And I copped that Rover, that 2 door Rover that I was rappin' bout
And I was turnt up, tryna flex and then I fucked around and I wrecked out
But it's cool, though, I copped that Aston Martin
I pulled up to Ugly Corner and I parked it
Not new, done never loved those since bout Kindergarten
I get retarded
Project Baby, I'm just bein' honest",https://genius.com/Kodak-black-molly-pt-2-lyrics
Testimony Cover,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I'm God-sent, I know I’m God-sent
I swear 'fore God
You know what I'm talkin’ 'bout?
Now, I done overcame so much obstacles
Came up from up under so much rocks and shit
Even though I be out here schemin' like a demon semen
I know I'm God-sent
This gotta be God
(Moreschii)

See what I got, I'll be moving so quiet I'm high on the pot
Devil sitting on my shoulders, with light on d spot
Telling me to go for it, said to give what I got
Been in light too much,  I'll be trying the dark
Blessings on me, is it blessings from God?
I don't know where to start, they be throwing dem darts
Won’t lie to u, some got to my heart
Making me feel alert, gat me smoking cigas
With all ma niggas from Lag, we be chasing bag
Squad on black durag, yeah we ball too hard!
But that is On God, mama says that a lot!
Leaving life no messing, shawty needing attention
Got to be there for ma baby, but she be calling on section
Yeah We ball every second, squad move like d legion
And I made a decision, to live in perfection! Yeah

Ayy, blood in my eyes, I’m goin' blind, oh

I'm stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated
I've been livin' so crazy, feel like I'm dyin', baby

I just shot a nigga, now I can't sleep
My brother, he just washed me down with bleach, oh
Project baby, snotty nose, head peezy
Now everybody 'round the world tryna be me
Miss my niggas, hope they see me on the TV
I'm on Instagram showin' off my VV's
You won't understand that this wasn't easy
I been walkin' 'round with my head peezy
Shot a nigga, took a shower with the bleach, Yahweh
Mama, I fell victim to the streets, I'm sorry
I'm in middle school, sellin' weed in the hallway
I was skippin' school, got in beef, started robbin'
Jackboy, that's my G, we like Batman and Robin
God, I know you lookin' out for me through the darkness
Blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh
Stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated
I've been livin' so crazy, feel like I'm dyin', baby

Blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh
I'm stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated
I've been livin' so crazy, feel like I'm dyin', baby
