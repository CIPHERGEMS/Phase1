Kaancepts,UnKnown,2014.0,"Kaan! Kaan!

'Nother psychotic episode, I need my medication
Hyperventilating, 'bout to have a panic attack in public
Discussing this with the publicist while I'm meditating
All I spit is heat, so is this room properly ventilated?
I'm killing your high the way that I murder a track, I never relax
You feel like you fucking with me and my flow, but you isn't my nigga that shit is a rap
Supplying a relevant fact, I'm taking that beat and not giving it back
I'm putting that right in your face just to reverse the verse I'm rehearsing
Disperse a curse, that's a MRSA for certain, I've been conversing
Confirming your inadvertent conversion within this version
Cohersion and my persuasive perversion was a diversion
Assured it while I'm emerging, concerning my insecurities
I even said that last line insecurely
That's the second time that I won't say this the potent is pouring Out of my pores to the potion but come proportionate force
An abortion is purer than porcelain fortune abortion
I found within an assortment of force for fornication facilitating
A formulation of duress in a combination
Predicted the proclamation, perfect my mental projectable
Vitamin for the fighters, injectable, not digestible
Address the microphone with the tone of any professional
Impressed with impeccable lines, every time, it's incredible
My rhyme's highly respectable, penetrating the posher
You pompous imposter, que pasa papa? I did it proper
While eating penne and pasta, call the doctor or I'm obliterating
While reiterating this honest pronunciation
Of reciprocation, the eloquation within my innovation
You should hasten all that replication, this is elevation
Like an application, I need to see your credentials
Massage a pen and my pencil, get loose on an instrumental
With sentimental, incidental, the sound was more intrusive
Wasn't conducive, I'll be the one that will lose it
Coming at me with a lude, and never confuse it
I wanted to set the fuse, and given the realest of muse
Never to be able to use it
There was no way to refuse it, given the voice said that it uses
But when I wanted 'em all in a piece in that vision I see when I see when I step on a beat I'm making, I'm breaking, I'm giving them all I can say but I do understand that the music is fake
Created itself in order to relate
They love it or hate it, the minute we make it
We putting it out for the people to take it
And never would lead you astray?
A talent that I might display?
We give it a round of applause
I said I'm trying to make the motherfucking world rise
With the rhymes that I comprise, the lyrics synchronize
The softer part, then analyze, now watch it photosynthesize
Still in that state of infancy
I'm not looking for empathy
Why the fuck would you envy me?
Empty the automatic for enemies at the embassy
Emphasizing the motion created within the energy
Enterprising my mind to the single pace to infinity
Venturing to divinity
Da Vinci with division, delivered with ill intention
But if you don't pay attention, I'm placing you in detention
Without an honorable mention
Your ranks are filled with dissension
My bars are filled with dimensions
Demented like it's dementia descending upon defenders
For pinning a pawn dependent depicted within this sentence
I'm a mild man, a pacifist
Massacring the masochists
Murdering, blasting the masses off to massive amounts
They'd probably give a better effort if they knew what really counts
But if you keep it real and build, then you'll put bills in your accounts
I'm not a mathematician — this written arithmetic
So I'mma teach you algebra, dumb it down for you simpletons
If (y = mx + me), then I must be
An MC that's obscene in my scene, but must see
I haven't even touched on the square roots of my averages
The 3.14 pi divided with savages
This ain't a dead democracy, my flow's totalitarian
Battling with barbarians, buried them barely breathin'
While coughing, wheezing with heathens
I'm digging ditches and heaving dirt over my left shoulder
You introduce a Jehovah
Suppose the fool that's in front of me started running and stumbling
Mumbling something out of his lips till I slit his wrist
And I tied him up to a cross and I started off with incisions
Insisting on silence for this crucifixion
The victim was tortured for hours
Scorched by a blowtorch till the toes are burned to a fricassee
And now I'm carving all of the flesh, what's left of it crispily
I'm vividly visualizing my victory
I'm pushing the vascular vein down to the main artery
The smell of death induces vomiting, I'm violent with a bayonet
Filleted his fingertips to get rid of the evidence
I'm pulling out his canines, molars, and bicuspids
While following in the footsteps of all of my fucking idols
From Jack the Ripper to John Wayne Gacy and Jeffrey Dahmer
The Black Dahlia killer and even the Cleveland Butcher
Who take a subject and slice it with a surgical precision
Even though I'm only kidding, I've lost faith in the music
And every song that I hear is amusing, it's so confusing
You would rather have a nigga acting like a buffoon
Give him a clown costume with the floppy shoes and the red nose
And don't forget the diamond chain to go with his expensive clothes
Perpetuating an image that no one can afford
Ain't you motherfuckers sick of that unoriginal ignorance?
I pick the microphone up and give you something that's different
Just open up your ears when I appear and start listening
It's Kaan

I shall leave you as you left me. As you left her!
Alone for all eternity, at the center of a dead planet
Buried alive… buried alive…
Kaan! Kaan!",https://genius.com/Kaan-kaancepts-lyrics
Concealed The Outro,Abstract Art,2015.0,"My father used to tell me I was nothing more than worthless
A stupid motherfucker that would live without a purpose
Put my thoughts upon a page so I could try to prove him wrong
And every time I write a song I reminisce about the pain that I'm repressing in my brain so I don't have to feel alone
And I've been living with depression so I wonder how this shit really begins
I'm comfortable with the thoughts of vision and now it is
I've been working on this record for a minute
Still I feel like nothing that I do is good enough
My insecurities are creeping in so they would seep in to the music
Ain't it funny when other people see your pain as amusing?
Abusing many a pill and numbing the way I feel 'til the point of my reality's the furthest thing from real
The only thing I ever needed was a little piece of love and I couldn't find that in people so I would seek it in drugs
And I wanted to be the greatest instead I'm facing the truth
But the fact of the matter is that I'm losing it what's the use
And I know I'm sounding repetitive lack the lust for living
I pray that I be forgiven , I say let’s take a picture
For sinners to get the sentiment a critical acclaim to explaining  it wasn't evident
A premonition of my early death I'll make it prevalent malevolent confessing
And if I was down and out I can't sell my soul to be relevant
Gallivanting around like 'Fuck I'm finally free
I'm ignoring all of my problems
I said I'd bury them deep '
But I'm actually terrified and my paranoia was verified cause I just realized I don't wanna make it to twenty-five
A suicidal psychopath, a schizophrenic kinda guy that's looking for your empathy hoping that you'll remember me
The message I provided collided within the melody
A metamorphosism reliving giving debauchery
The resurrection of a savior coming out of Nazareth where you could catch a laceration and a crucifixion
Under what condition d'you make the decision moving like it's in a mild position living at the bottom wishing I was with it
Couldn't tell the difference
So tired of giving the false opinions
My faith in the book that was written by other people
They probably wrote with agendas
So every role was intended for anyone to follow
Attention, I got a testament
Just like the book of Mark
And I'm sparking a revolution
My story a revelation
Amazing, I'd rather save it, debate it
Everything on my mind
While I was taking a mental picture
OK, so my train of thought is evasive
I'm faded within my memory
From a daily addiction of always staying sedated and claiming I wanna make it
I'm nothing more than a follower
No apologies for it
Enforcing my fucking happiness
Don't know what I believe and I'm seething and barely breathing
I was thinking of positivity
The possibility that I'll be sane is like a fallacy
I got a way to go and I'm showing you people gradually
I been imagining a better life and then I contradict it
The consequence of feeling like a loser with no confidence
And I've been all alone, I'm tryna find the source of inner peace
I suffocate the beat until the flow has been consumed
I strangulate that mother fucker, turn the tune and turn the night maroon
And if I'm being honest, I think I'm losing my passion
I'm passing on opportunities
Giving in to distraction
The problem's that I've been having is all of it's a facade
It's quantity over quality
Profit over the product
But shit if it makes a dollar
Who gives a fuck if it's garbage?
We'll get it radio play and then now make it a classic
And take a nigga with talent that's about as big as a grain of salt
And put him on a pedestal
He'll eventually catapult to perpetual force
The actual result distracting
They forgot that mother fucker was never decent at rapping
They reminisce on the past and there ain't nobody original
But niggas stealing styles and never giving their credit
Accepting that shit's pathetic
A hypothetical pondering
I put it on a paper for some people I'm being honest with
Abolishing a novice and murdering his accomplice
A complicated affair with the notorious hitter
These habitual liars supplying a lot of ignorance
It's all about an image, so everyone's irresponsible
And if you got a positive message then it's impossible to overcome the current plan and rap a better obstacle
It's illogical to think that
The future is looking brighter
When money comes into play than the vision will get distorted
Cause you were forced into feeling by acting out of your character
You lost your sense of pride that's inside
Don't that embarrass ya?
Barely making it now when you're coming up from the rubble
Refuse to be in the rut
Ain't no need for an introduction
My shit is really disgusting
It's different and impeccable
Intelligent and highly respectable
You're susceptible to this lyrical giant
A tyrant acting defiant
I'd rather do this alone
So mother fuck an alliance aligning with preservation
To practice my dedication by defecating the delicate
Relegated with delegates to give them rigamortis
Supported within a deficit
Celebrated a reverence
Televising my decadence
From years of destitution
The resolution's irrelevant
It's gotten to the point where I can see that nothing's real at all
It's leaving me appalled and
I'm embarrassed I will get involved to mental regression for I have yet to evolve
Got to find a spot to put my aggression before I'm gone
But the pain that I feel has lasted so long
So by the end of this song I'm praying for my desire cause I'm refusing to fake it
I’d rather reform than retire so my generation remedial
I really can't believe this shit is happening
In any lie, I’m surrounded by fucking geniuses
And you gotta be kidding me
The only thing I was meant to be is the dopest mother fucker that people will probably never see
And if I never make it then I'm fulfilling the prophecy
Everything that I write has been centered around my honesty",https://genius.com/Kaan-concealed-the-outro-lyrics
Mary Jane,K.A.A.N. x SGULL,2016.0,"Are you insane like me? Been in pain like me?
Bought a hundred dollar bottle of champagne like me?
Just to pour that motherfucker down the drain like me?
Would you use your water bill to dry the stain like me?
Are you high enough without the Mary Jane like me?
Do you tear yourself apart to entertain like me?
Do the people whisper 'bout you on the train like me?
Saying that you shouldn't waste your pretty face like me?

I've been living with the demons that I got in my soul
I been thinking 'bout the pain that I got on my mind
My conscience don't exist from the things that I did
I been praying for forgiveness of the way that I live
You can find me in the zone I swear to god I is
Ain't nobody breathing currently the words like this
I'm a different type of nigga never worried 'bout the funds
I was focused on progression bitch I gotta get it done
I said I tried to bring it in but ain't nobody get it once
A nigga pressure was minding I had to find a way around it
I ran a couple miles couldn't find myself
Gon' get fucked up 'cause it always helps
Imma drown in my sorrows all by myself
On a quiet night you'll find me staring at the wall
With a somber thought
I feel like I been here before my nigga
Tell me what you really know my nigga
I'm insane like a motherfucker
Try to find a way to articulate
Taking plenty of time to author ridiculous text
I been giving you real even though I'm riddled with stress
Took 1 hit 2 hits 3 hits 4
I cry for help but nobody respond
My emotions gone, yeah they all up and down
My self-esteem left and my confidence squandered
Got all of this pain that I deal with alone

Are you insane like me? Been in pain like me?
Bought a hundred dollar bottle of champagne like me?
Just to pour that motherfucker down the drain like me?
Would you use your water bill to dry the stain like me?
Are you high enough without the Mary Jane like me?
Do you tear yourself apart to entertain like me?
Do the people whisper 'bout you on the train like me?
Saying that you shouldn't waste your pretty face like me?

I been killing myself for a dream I don't even believe in
It's really entertaining when you give it your all
I put my soul upon the table all they do is analyze it
I beseech the simple rhymes that I ain't never told nobody
When I start a rap the suicidal thoughts
Are running rampant through my mind
I made the mental find a way I guess
I can really make it vivid
So they see the clearer picture of depression
Panicking, I can't take this shit
My god
Tell me why you put me here for
I'm gone
And I don't want to live no more
Oh lord
The pain is temporary I hope
I know
That I was not created just to waste it, that's the truth
So why the fuck do I feel crazy
Can't explain it
It's a feeling deep inside of me
I got no witnesses left
I know I'm lost on the path I chose
Never lie upon the record, I will not be exposed
I'm only giving reality
I'm a lyrical legend
My complimentary honesty is a rarity yes
You feed the fallacy to them but I'm not really impressed
'Cause I can read between the lines and deceitful lies
Are you insane like me?
Been in pain like me?
Do you tear yourself apart to entertain like me?
Want to change like me?
But you can't like me?
Terrified that your misery going to remain like me?

Are you insane like me? Been in pain like me?
Bought a hundred dollar bottle of champagne like me?
Just to pour that motherfucker down the drain like me?
Would you use your water bill to dry the stain like me?
Are you high enough without the Mary Jane like me?

Rap God,UnKnown,2015.0,"Eh, knowledge, nigga!
Uh-huh, aye, uhu uhu uhu uhu uhu uhu!
Lawd!
Aye, aight let's do it
Aye, I’m finna go the fuck in
Please pay attention, please
Lawd!

My confidence is low I am no rap god, rap god
Do whatever that I gotta do
I guarantee it isn't that hard, that hard
I gotta get better and kill it but I keep it real, no fa-cades, fa-cades
There ain't no competition I murdered this motherfucker, 
Charles Manson, Manson

Now gimme the time, and I be blowing your mind
Yes I'm another lyricist, I was a cynical child
Now you need tons of venom and origin
Never really notice that my flow is fucking ridiculous
Picking the pitiful, never subliminal, seminal sinners
But I say, I'm a goddamn monster
Call me necrophiliac
I feel I'm on a level that most of these other niggas never really come close to
I hope you notice me, I spit it focusedly
This is my passion, devoted, I can't quit
I came in and conquered by constantly practicing
Passing these peons, they pleading for peace
I'm a beast and I treat all these beats like a feast
I don't eat with delusional idiots, so inconsiderate
Fuck!
Get it by yourself because nobody want to help
But when I’m reaching for the belt I keep it ringin' like a bell
But I can tell they wanted something faker, with makeup
I'm making amends for my sins with a hyphen
I break it like a hymen
When I spit then pay attention not to mention none of it
With a reel of caution
I'm living lawless, a nigga heartless
I'm fucking flawless
I want it all and I bet I finna' get it
I've been living like a suicidal patient
Pacing in my isolation
I can barely even think
So I've been giving the truth
Looking for some peace of mind
So can I get it from you
A negative type of do
No, I never had a crew

My confidence is low, I am no rap god, rap god
Do whatever that I gotta do
I guarantee it isn't that hard, that hard
I gotta get better and kill it but I keep it real, no fa-cades, fa-cades
There ain't no competition I murdered this motherfucker Charles Manson, Manson

You can hand me the torch, I be carrying that
I fell in love with the pain, I be marrying that
But if I take it from these niggas, I'm not giving it back
I figured the flow was kinda forming the voice of my own opinion
Dependin' if it was given by the nigga that you hear
Right now, right now
Got a positive aspect, a lyrical misfit
These motherfuckers hating but the style convincing
I'm revving the engine
A little bit of patience
I pray that I have that
I rap fast and tap basses with the backlash
Fag ass, body was stashed inside a knapsack
Going up and down, my temperament is the NASDAQ
Abstract, never distract, I'm giving contact
Impact nigga attack you gotta send back
Bitch I'm independent but never signing a contract
Never understood why you motherfuckers would want that
Better get away from me before I give you a dirt nap
Hurling and hurting, concerning
I'm a surgeon with words and emergin'
To the sentence, I been livin' at my leisure
Leaving the leech, I proceed to the thesis
I wrote it from the bleachers, I hope they can see this
Living on the sideline, feeling like a genius
Tell me why the fuck you want to stop my creativity
You listen to this sound and you hearing something that's brand new
Murdering any instrumental homie that's I can do
Leave a negative comment, nigga why can't you
Give the same effort as me?
This shit is very difficult, it seems effortlessly
How I swerve from verse to pronoun profound slowdown
Gotta let me catch my breath, time to impress
This is my vocabulary—it's from A to Z and I'm actually accurate
Besting the cool to determine earnings
Fancy flow feeling great, happily I just keep living life like my mind never gets operations, perpetual question requestin'
Secretion tenacity
Usually using very vicious vision worry worship Xenon yelling yesterday with a zygote, Zulu with a xylophone
Don't you get to study what I do with a pen
And I bet you tripping, take the alphabet and turn it frenetic
I got' em frantic, bow to the spiritual figure like Pope Francis
Take it to the Vatican to sodomize the beat
And I bend it over the pew like a pedophilic priest
Sheesh!
A descendant of kings
No, I'm a pharaoh, that's part of Egyptian religion
That ended when Romans began to accept Christianity
I am omnipotent
Call me Osiris, the god of the afterlife
How I transitioned the regeneration that I resurrected
The message directed is truth for a liar, the way I am robbing
Distinctive attire, a crown on my head with the largest of feathers, I carry a crook and flail
If I fail it's a symbolic tale
A story I'm telling the King of the Living
My life, it was written on scrolls for the people
You step in my steeple to see sacrifices
I'm licensed to carry my pen like a firearm
Walk in a crowded building, I yell ""fire""
And fire the weapon I brought in my trench coat
I'm detouring people away from the exit
I shepherd them into nefarious flurry of
Bullets bombarded so pardon my pace
If you cover your face, then you hit in the sternum
Never really giving you a chance with me
Huh, Voulez-vous coucher avec moi (ce soir)
But manually I shall make a critique
My apostrophes are so magnifique
Beseeching the people, I need your attention
I can not progress if I don't have a crowd
I've allowed all these evils inside of my life
Man I used to be sober, what happened to me ?
And I used to work harder then what I do now ?
I don't have self esteem, and I feel insecure
I'm unsure of the person I am, I'm in need of identity
Fairly sedated, I fade to my former self back in '09 when I knew that I needed help
Very depressed I was so isolated
Not leaving the house, I'm not feeling elated
I'd much rather go get a razor blade
No, I don't use it for shaving
I use it for saving myself from the stress
And attention I felt 'cause I thought that it'd help
I admit that I'm down and I am feeling lost
Lawd!

My confidence is low I am no rap god, rap god
Do whatever that I gotta do
I guarantee it isn't that hard, that hard
I gotta get better and kill it but I keep it real, no fa-cades, fa-cades
There ain't no competition I murdered this motherfucker Charles Manson, Manson

God, tell me why do I feel sick?
'Cause, son of a bitch, I stare in the mirror and cringe
Shit's getting worse, I need more medication
A mental vacation 'cause I can not take it
I'm holding my breath 'til I'm no longer breathing or seeing
I'm down to the ground and they call paramedics
No need for an ambulance, I have departed
To live in the clouds, I am finally free from the demons I have
Or man, should I say had? 'Cause now they in the past
And I can't reminisce I'm remiss, I insist that I used to feel bliss
Fuck that!
Trippin' on a motherfucker, bet I do it never knew it
I'm moving and grooving, you losing it's no illusion
Refusing to fucking work and I'm hurting to find a purpose
Concerned but never stopping, evading your positivity
The nepotism of a lyricist, my negativity is definitely innovative
I take it and make it mine
I redefine the line
I got a sword inside Camelot, I'm striking by the underside
I said I never tell a lie
I put my fuckin' hand up on the Bible, let me testify
I rectify the situation amazin'
I'm taking my time when I kill this
Praying that you feel this
Everything is factual, I'm only spittin' real shit
Why won't they leave me alone?
""Homie, you're dope, I really fuck with your flow
Man, if we got on a record and did it together I'm sure that that shit 'finna blow""
You niggas are hoes, and personally, I'm composed
I practiced and practiced some more
These kids are a joke, they never studied the craft
Attempts that they giving are half of the ass of the women that they procrastinated with
I'm obsessive
With this my confessional shit
Like father won't you forgive me for all my sins
And I'm playing some EPMD
But the sermons I'm serving
I guess you can thank every Sermon
And Parrish for opening all of the doors
Mr. Mojo is Risin', that's off of the LA Woman album I am still bumpin'
So please do your research, and both of those references coming from different genres
I am astute in my ears, I'm a student of this
With the way that I studied for years
I don't have any peers
I appear and I'm peakin' inside of the minds of the mentally struggling
Far from enlightened
Decided to slice of the piece of the pie
No man, I want a dozen
Refuse to attribute to making you dumber
I don't have no melodies, this ain't melodic
I'm honest to say that I wish you abolish
These artists that started embellishing fallacies
Feeling like I should forgo to be militant
Missing the messages of Makaveli
Damn!
Guess you motherfuckers never really understood that I've been working at a pace
I know I need to take a break
These niggas say they got an issue with the talent I was given
But I do it with a passion, and nobody surpassing
You think you fucking with Knowledge, but really I am laughing
Take a little time for yourself, I know you gassed up
And I'ma leave you gasping for air
Yeah, goddamn, nigga, woo!

That's it! Rap God. That's it. I'm not a Rap God, this isn't better than Em's version, I'-I'm aware of that. Still kind of cool though. Uh, yea, if you didn't like this, do me a favor and find a duck dick... and suck that duck dick",https://genius.com/Kaan-rap-god-lyrics
Phoenix,Eclectic Audio,2016.0,"Aight, let's do it
Think you're alright

I don't think I really got it
I don't think that I can get over all of my problems
I've been thinking, who the fuck am I to disagree?
I heard I'm pretty dope so I guess I gotta oblige
Inside, I been plotting on a way that we can elevate
A massacre to chop up your skin, I never hesitate
I put a lot of time into the craft, I make it resonate
I regulate with repetition; I could be the greatest
But half of me illogical, the other half elated
Practice on the pages that I got in my attentive mind
(
Think you're alright
)
I minimize the ignorance
So in a minute I make it relatable
Evade the negativity at all costs
Tryna find my way, I'm feelin' so lost
Find me in the zone, I gotta focus
But that can be an issue, I'm addicted to the work
It's all I ever wanna do, pursue the purpose that I'm pleading for
And need it more than pity, man
Them minuscule opinions picking apart the immaculate
(
Think you're alright
)
Happily apathetic and actually authentic
This sentence is sentimental like the words are just a piece of my soul, lawd!
I transcend into the artist that I wanna be
(
High stakes
)
I demonstrate my dominance; a derelict with dialect
My etiquette is excellence, I dedicate my all to this
I solemnly swear that I serenade with selections
(
Transform, you stand alone
)
And different cadences to kill it
Really givin' that in this and
Anyone that wants the truth that we present to be identified
I live a meager life
I'm motivated by progression 'cause a year ago nobody paid attention to the kid
And I'm persistent with the effort, document my declaration
(
High stakes
)
Dedicated to the death of me, definitely concerned that I prefer to be a purist
I'm purging all of the verses
Only way to get it off of my chest, oh lawd!
(
Transform and stand alone
)
If it's a problem, I solve it privately; polish 'em off
I punish with powerful poems, compose a doper​ creation
Case in point, I'm steadily provin' this ain't a lucid dream
I used to be infatuated, now it's just reality, I'm managing my temperament, my time to capitalize isn't infinite, the wisdom I'm attaining from trial and effort is priceless
I pride myself on putting the music before my sanity
Sing you a lullaby with alliteration and empathy
The lack of recognition is starting to fuel my energy
You know you made it when you receivin' hate from an enemy
(
You're not alright
)
Irrelevance was never an option, here's the synopsis
Said I'm knockin' out whoever you considerin' the king
I'll kick him off the throne, I want it, I'ma take it as my property
And properly prepared to go to war with any challenger
I battle in Colosseums, people cheer for me to finish it
Reminiscing of the legends that left remarkable legacies
I said that I'm ahead of my time, I am
You can never understand the headspace I'm in, I
Live and I'm writing about it
Giving a lyrical ballad
Workin' on findin' a balance
Dealin' with every challenge, but
It's a struggle, meticulously​ adjustin' my train of thought to be positive; transform to a phoenix

And we just tryna give you something you remember
We the illest, nigga, don't ever forget it, lawd!
And we just tryna give you something you remember
We the illest, nigga, don't ever forget it, lawd!
And we just tryna give you something you remember
We the illest, nigga, don't ever forget it, lawd!
And we just tryna give you something you remember
We the illest, nigga, don't ever forget it!

- A remnant of the time long passed. Genetically engineered to be superior so as to lead others to peace in a world at war. We were condemned as criminals forced into exile. For centuries we slept, hoping when we awoke things would be different. My name, is Khan

They call me, Marcus Aurelius Garvey
You wanna act was a way to assimilate
Imma disseminate every single intention you put in the verse
And the word for the flow and the form is definitive
Adoration what the fuck do you mean
A beautiful mind
And I am the product of Malcolm and Martin's collaborative dream
Perpetual king
So within the time that we living I'm giving you lyrics I deem
A cynical scene
You niggas are working for cream
I pick up the pen and I scheme
The biggest of critics are quicker to pick it apart
Defining the men and and they’re painting the part
Supplying a rhythm and calling it art
Committed a murder the verdict is dark
I start by giving you emphasis
Guaranteed you'll remember this
Memorizing the cadence I penetrate with comrodery
Constantly contemplating my theories of physiology
Follow me as I estimate
Humorously I escalate
Then execute astutely with a fuse
I pray that you never confuse it
Making it for your amusement
To realize they giving ridiculous lines
I'm speaking the truth
Presented to you
I said that we keeping it cool
This niggas' refusing to lose
I give an opinion depicting a radical view
I choose to be insane and my brain is an algorithm
An astronomical fortress conversing but not conforming
Cause' cowards cower for hours devoured by this performance
You dormant and I'm euphoric you given rhythm enforce it
The source of the simultaneous infiltrate with endorphins
My style Is highly choleric, the status quo was the flow
I defeated them with tenacity
My vocabulary is at a maximum capacity
General relativity
Revolutionizing the way you understanding gravity
A wrapping of the fabric of space and time I'm Einstein
Giving the people the formula
The dopest of niggas' is warning ya
I said that I'm focused you better believe it
The way that I'm rhyming and barely breathing
I'm minding my business, I murdered the beat
And the point that I'm working to make
Is the people debating I guarantee I'mma create
The sickest of sentences you can relate
And I would not do with the hidden I'm great
So I never resting control of my fate
They telling you everything that you wanted to hear whenever they right in your face
The second you turn, the quicker they burn
And I've been awake cause I already learned
I'm taking my time, perfecting the craft
And getting my way to give you the wrath
Of K.A.A.N ; is the consequence all of your lyrics contradict
They lack the certain presence and effervescence of prominence
The K is for the knowledge that I am constantly seeking
The A's are put in the middle as I'm attempting to allocate
The N is for the nonsense that the public will entertain
As I explain my names an acronym
Lyrical acrobatics
Knowledge Above All Nonsense
Can you imagine that ?
I'm moving the hustle and busting my ass
While giving the rhythm, you live in the past
The part of the pen and the pain that I book
A piece of the pie for the people to eat
We giving a beautiful feast
A literal beast
Until every daughters obese
Food for the minds of the foolish many a minuscule men try to suppress what I attest with a pen
When will it end ?
My lines are actually accurate never asinine
Put iodines inside my apparatus
I'm extracting the sweetest scent of malevolence
Necessary for relevance
An innovative poet asphyxiated his relative
Sedatives in my system while singin' swingin' a razor blade
Sad to say that I'm somber so someone tell me to save the date
The synthesizer sounds so similar to a symphony
Orchestrated a cape, strangulate you with a vapor
I, said I'm giving you elegance
But never defining the elements
I'm tellin' a story informative tale
A way for the people to really prevail
The problem is all the irrelevant rap
Like you biting everything you was sold
I'm wondering sitting inside of my room
And I pray for my soul to prepare for the doom
Assume that I would glorify violence and plenty ignorance
Subliminal messages inside of all of the images
I'm a reclusive author that's very strict with tradition
I'm speaking of isolation while giving you my rendition
Was ridiculed as a child and my pain I put in a chalice
Was silenced, the flow dyslexic and very mentally challenged
Allowing these mother fuckers to degrade me with degrees
But my decree is I can see that I'll probably never be free
I'm afflicted by insecurities
Currently contemplating
I've cultivated catastrophes by living alone and being oppressed
But then created a masterpiece
Exactly, I'm actually asking for attrition effectively you're submissive
Deficiencies in your vision, your mind inside of a prison
Prolific whenever spittin', accelerated the rhythm
I've written, formin' the similes so my signature resonates
Assembling a suit and then reprimanding a saboteur
Salivating for sabotage, get it since it is sinister
Delivering this dope to the pope and the poor minister
Principles in the precipice people pushing the passion
Perplexing the other purpose so pardon passive aggression
Premeditated predition, the pummel punisher punding
My punches harder than pumice
I contradict with some politicians and statisticians
A prescription that came from two physicians
Playing my position in my mind
I seem to find a paradise inside the prophecy
The paradigm particular policy of your piracy
Depositing the power to possibly be considered great
Disintegrate then dissipate
We gotta keep it honest, I can't deceive when I initiate
Tryin' to enter the fortress by formulating the gorges they forgin'
Forcin' the source in the hopes of finding a fortune
I've written this rigor mortis
You mortified and I'm morphin'
Absorbing the smorgasbord for the sport
The sword with a connaisseur
A commodore accommodating
Reconnaissance complicating
The case of the kid that was killing them with calligraphy
A legendary figure resemblance of a relic
I'm doing the most and I'm setting the pace
A picture painted by a person in pain
We keeping it real and you never can take
But there is a move in your hatred
Never complacent
Flow is adjacent
Showing you everything that I'm facing
What am I making
Never mistaking
Some of the illest of lyrics in ages
Suffocate like corsets, can't control when I torch it
Of course it was of importance, I point it out and I pour it
Deplorable as an asterisk, concentrate with consortists
Exuding the excellence of an existential extortionist
I pray that you enjoy what I created for you
And this concludes the feature presentation Kaancepts 2

I am fatigued
I give it my all with the music
People do not recognize
The passion I have for the craft
The effort I'm givin' with every line
That I write a ridiculous
Life has affected my content
All of the sins that would sit on my conscience
Insecurities that I am possessin'
Why is my death been a constant obsession
I am reflectin'
Thinkin' about the life that I chose
And the path of the young nigga moving on
And I been down and out
'Cause I was looking for the answer
But never really had no questions
Tell me that I'm accepted
I'm gettin' sick and tired of rejection
I said I can't deal with the nonsense
The pain been constant
I wish I wasn't this depressed
So I can deal with the stress
I feel at all times
I'm debatin' what the fuck I'mma do with the cadence
I hope it isn't weak
Nigga, I can take it deep to the depths of your soul
With the list of my goals
That I could never attain
And you would take it in vain
I tried to explain
And givin' you my pain
Take a listen to the record and tell me I'm insane
With the way that I was raised
I swear that I've been trained
Prepared to be alone
I pray that I can atone
I've been lookin' for the meaning of life
With the voice in my head
Tryna get it all right
I can never get a light
When I felt that I needed it
Proceeded with my genius
Conceivin' this
The meanest shit
Your will will bend the pain to end
The second that a nigga picked up the pen
I guess it all depends upon the mood that I'm in
And the mind-state in which that I write this
Puttin' my time in
I redefine what it means
Commended for my dedication
You never related
Relayin' my pain in the passages
Written on pages
This scripture for sinners
This sentence can save 'em
I give you the truth
And it's never debated
Degraded by hatred
And giving your ignorant comment deceitful
Accomplice the reason my life is abolished

I’m writin' a story that you couldn’t fathom, yeah
I'm givin' a vision that you can't imagine , yeah

Yeah, you're wondering what is my thesis
Yeah, you're wondering what is my thesis
Why am I lonely when people are phony
I felt like I needed someone to believe in, lawd!

Tell me that you want the real shit
Then take a second to listen and you'll feel this
As I reminisce on my self-esteem
That would evaporate in my adolescence
Turned introspective
Felt so dejected
I should use a noose as my newest necklace
I'mma set the scene from my wildest dreams
And I was headed for the valley of the shadow of death
I wanna be the motherfucker you define as the best
With a rhyme to attest
Releasin' all stress
I confess that I speak a life from my view
With deceive and disciple
The blood and the pew
We stained the white flag that you use for truces
All bets are off
There's no more illusions
And anyone wanna get a division is confusin'
I wanna a nigga rid and I wanted to infuse him
My flows amusin'
Niggas are so clueless
Blind to all facts
And don't know what truth is
I put it on wax
And backtrack maneuvers
Atrocities that you associated
All my fucking pain has been irregulated
In my isolation I was hesitatin'
I am terrified that I will never make it
Life is so evasive
I could make a statement
I'mma signify what this shit really mean
And that's another part that you will never get
Unless I paint a picture
You could visualize it
That was so surprising

Lots of iller shit for you to realize
That I am so lonely
I am so lonely

Ah, eh

These niggas speak on their word
Me, I just speak on the time
Time and the effort that I have invested
Inside of myself, I am losing my mind
I want it all, I said I'm mentally tough
Oh, what you thought I would quit?
Even in days when I feel at my worst
I will get up my ass and then get back to work

Lawd! What’s the point of complain' ? I said it I’d never do it
I’m working in isolation, silently I’ve been approvin'
Moving like I’m really focused
Fortified and then feeling devoted
Sacrificing for a dream, I see myself inside a favored place
I can’t escape, I’m panicking and pacing in a corner
Cop a coroner then come and get me
I’m missing my sanity, I’m salivating over beats
I’m motivated by the 
pay
 and now I spend the situation
I wanted them to connect
Resurrect the second
Descendant from any sinner
With this sympathetic simile and apathetic energy
My appetite is actually enormous
I’ve been rhyming in repetition, I practice
I promise that I’m so passive with passion
And promiscuity
The pen that I’ve been using, I run it across the page
Personally i’m amazed that i made it to 24
As I forced the feeling the source
I’m definitely the voice for anyone that is alone
I can’t atone
I tried to speak to god, it’s getting hard to find my happiness
I want another pillI said, I’ll force a better one
I start to hallucinate with another prescription
I’m like a different person, I know
My mother disappointed from decisions I’m making
I probably should have stayed in college
Instead I wanna procrastinate, that was a couple years ago
So I been on a mission to make up for all the time
I never let her down

Growing up they used to tell me I was strange
I remember growing up they used to say that I was strange
That's cause I kept to myself and I would never say a thang
I remember growing up them niggas said that I was strange
That's cause I kept to myself while playing Kurt Cobain
I remember growing up them niggas said that I was strange
That's cause I kept to myself while playing Kurt Cobain

Tell me what you really know 'bout being so fuckin depressed
That you ain't left the house in months, assuming you're mentally done
I got a razor blade and cyanide to silence my insanity
The voices in my motherfuckin' head they keep on callin' me
No seriously, every time I wake up in the mother fuckin' morning I am lookin' for the exit
Exodus, the testament, to rectify supply but I would've never sufficed
I read a couple different words from the Bible and decided with a nigga believin' defeat is the purpose of livin'
Now let me give you my story the moment you give the feelin' I'm feelin' for real
Don't kill my angst
I can't be a motherfucker that's giving you positive records to make 'em think that they really got a chance
When it's all down hill
I can tell ya how it is
Fuck friends
When you needin' the people they disappear
I hear niggas talk, but what you really sayin'
The cadence at which I kill it
Debating if I'm the realest
Revealing that I'm a monster, molestin' the beat
I beseech you a piece and I promise it'll be-
Relatable to the point that's not debatable
Giving you agony, pain is evadable
Very important to show you I'm capable
Came with a bottle of anti-depressants
I'm praying the problem is that I'm not patient
I'm pacing and wondering
Talking to Christ
And I'm crying for help, I can't do it myself
I'm in love with the vice that's destroying my life
I don't have any character, ain't it embarrassing?
Give me some medicine, then I abuse it
Stuck in a rut and I don't give a fuck
If I live or I die to reside in the sky
What's the point?
I thought that I was supposed to peek
Interest, unrest, not bless, don't rest, don't test
No, I would never try to make a fuckin' fallacy
I guarantee you'll never hear a song about a fantasy
A vanity
Reality is the only place that I would ever really wanna live
In a fake ass world
You wanted money and women
Depending if it's a mean to an end
Now you're fed
Cause I wanna be alone
Refuse to waste time and I work at a pace at which the weak can't keep
I need a moment to gather the sickest energy sentimentally up and sedate it
I pray that I can make it
My heart keeps breakin'
Why do I feel vacant inside of me?
Verbal abuse and a case of anxiety
Lack of financial stability
This is the recipe for my soliloquy
Cynically sayin' a word to Jehovah
Supposed to be honest
Come pass the composure for closure
I'm poppin' a perc for the hurt, and I don’t think it working, 
so wait and I’ll master the pain

All them stupid niggas used to tell me I was strange
That's cause I kept to myself while playing Kurt Cobain
I remember growing up them niggas said that I was strange
That's cause I kept to myself while playing Kurt Cobain
Nigga, daym!

Look, I was alone
So isolated from people that I cannot see what is real
I was alone
So isolated from people but I cannot feel through the pill
I was alone
So isolated from people but I cannot see what is real
I was alone
So isolated from people but I cannot see what is real

I am alone, so isolated from people that I cannot see what is real
And I feel like I finally found the foundation of sympathy
Can I get some of your love with no judgin'?
The sound is improving the sentence
So pungent, disgusting
They think that we made it but that's an illusion
Created inside of our basement
Just me and my nigga
We workin', for certain
I hope we accomplish it
Never content with a case of complacency
Keepin' the cadence of mine
We combine in a kind of a law
For the few connoisseurs or the lyrically spiritual
I am attempting to take you to places of peace
And that was for your soul
If I'm out of control I can sew with a knee-riding temperament
Telling the truth I'm severely sensitive
Insecure memoirs of secrets inside of me
Asking why I wanna die
I'm detesting the lie and I'm blamin' it on the society
Simple to see that they prefer to indulge
I prefer being passive
Detering the falsehood
I'm taking the fault and I fall with the force of a heavyweight champion
Channeling all of his pain
I provide it the point
I'm ready to leave
I no longer deceive like the rest of them
Constantly wrestling with an idea then I start to imagine it
I'm aggravated, evading the question
The question I have is irrelevant
Seldomly different
Distant, depressed and I'm speaking
But no one is listening
I'll fade away and just cease to exist
I'm no longer determined
I know that I'm worthless

I'm working hard
I'm sacrificing my life, I'm sacrificing my mind
I'm sacrificing my sanity but, most importantly, I'm sacrificing my time
Boy, I feel fine. I feel like I am a king
Honestly, I can't complain
Even with faith that's the size of a grain and some salt I will still move a mountain and do what I want
I assault the beat with my rhyme, my rhyme
You would kinda feel me one time, one time
If I gave you something realer would you comprehend the feeling and emotion that I put in my line, my line
I assault the beat with my rhyme, my rhyme
You would kinda feel me one time, one time
If I gave you something realer would you comprehend the feeling and emotion that I put in my line, my line

I'm a catastrophic and catatonic as I degenerate
I alleviate for the leniency of the listener
Misinterpreted my cadence for continuity, I engineer with ingenuity
My flow should really supersede the sea I seen with promiscuity
A positive solution for pollution of the purity
I personally purge a verse, immerse the words
I learn the work, assert the search, a SERP, a nurse, I suffer curse, it hurts to heave or have a hearse
I'm taking what I wanted and I bet I do, you never knew
I'm useless n' a necrophiliac the way I kill a fuck, a trick
A hypochondriac, I stay away from people, though I'm isolated, but I like it to do love with the craft
I created different realities
All that's on my head is the sanity
I'm very terrified of living by myself and the struggle seems to pursue me
So I'm peeking around the corner
I'm in the corridor of life
The definition of an artist that was falling for the light
I'm insecure and lacking confidence
I can't put up a fight
I mean I must of missed the opportunity, constantly lost
And extension of my aggression was never meant to affect my sense
This stupid lecture is the lessons that I have learned
As they living inside the legend of my alleged hypotheses, the pharoahcies
I put the hieroglyphic on the wall n' when I wrote it I made sure that it was legible for you, so my legacy was the truth, GODDAM

Hit the page with the passion that I'm possessing
The peasant prints with depressing
I'm pessimistic but very connected to positivity
Incidentally, immaculate, maximize all my efforts
All focus with no procrastination
Amazing I'm lacing soliloquies with the formula
Finally feeling better, not feeding you negativity
Detrimental assumption, I summon some of the power
And sanction the serendipity, pay attention when listening, The summit I'm envisioning is beautiful and, most importantly, I'm porously giving you knowledge
The polish for a deposit, possible fan of fortune, a fortune it wouldn't, wasn't
And I'm working to no avail n' it tells a tale of truant that fell in love with the music
I'm usually aggressive to make sure I get my point across, I hope I didn't waste all my time aside a fantasy
Consider me, your losing my reality's delusional

Look — huh!

Now, I can write something that's ignorant, present it as immaculate
Then package it for people to purchase diggin' inside your purses
And pockets for profit that I know that you needed
Don't pay no mortgage or no car, no, give them dollars to me
I dominantly attest a system that was set in place for politics
The problem is, this shit is archaic – so I'll explain it quick
Of course you need a singular image, then you're excellin'
Don't worry about your content 'cause hatred is always relevant
And prevalent; I'm sure you'll find a proper way to sell to kids
And catch 'em while they're young, they'll never question your integrity
Selectively invaded the market, your product's average
And with money behind it, I promise that you'll be poppin'
I put you on every blog and that's how you gain your respect
When you're popular they assumin' you're automatically next
And your catalog filled with records that sound exactly the same
It's insane and fuckin' monotonous all your music is drainin'
The energy out my body – it's crazy, I'm tryna take it back
To Pac and Big or Pun as I punish you with these artifacts
Relics of what they used to be, honesty over usury
Take a seat, come and see! I will leave you in disbelief
Now, you baffled by my intelligence – not to mention the cadence
But that's aside from the fact, in the stat I'm currently stated
Just pay attention to lyrics to see what they really sayin'
I bet that you would be blown away, wonderin' what you listen for
As I propose the apropos, opposers take the higher road
Expose their true intentions, they devious and deliberate
Deceivin' with the statics, the average of receptin'
Accept I'm settin' the tempo in tone, I'll take you to temple
Un momento, let the author breathe – focusedly I dispose of thee
Keep this kid in your memory, mention me but I need to be
Better than all my enemies, never sleep in my mezzanine
Wide awake I refuse to dream, flow is a methamphetamine
Meddlin' with adrenaline, pedalin' tryna pass
I'm gonna crush a couple Adderalls, I'm feelin' like a junkie
Noddin' off, I need my second wind as I begin the pen
Is now a part of me, compartmentalize the pain my father causes
Fuck that simple nigga – what the hell do you know?
And apparently, I am too stupid and gullible I could never be
Anything more than what I am currently, I should probably quit
I'm wastin' all my time and I might as well call it off
I guess I need to straighten up and fly right so I can be like
My dad, who set the perfect example on how you should live
And that's degrade your wife and kids until they no longer speak
Then you come home and 'cause 'em hell so that they never see peace
The place that we rested our heads ever stepped in a war zone
Where the tyrant that's runnin' rampant and rantin' on telephones
Tellin' anyone that'll listen that my kids ain't shit
A bunch of worthless motherfuckers and my wife is a bitch
Let's not discuss all of my issues, there's no need to recall the fact I'm a fuckin' alcoholic that was never involved
Or took an interest within the children that I helped to create
I live in a delusional world and that's not even my fault
The relationship I have with my kids is the one that I want
I provided and put food on the table, that's all that they needed
Who cares about love or compassion? Ain't no empathy given
That nigga never taught me shit, I learned this all on my own
I was lonely and suicidal way before I was grown
Now my adult years are filled with fears and animosity
I repress my emotions so that they will not affect me
I've done that shit for a minute but now I think I'm defectin'
Reflectin' on my regrets – I gotta find a way to deal with them
To get out of the darkness, become a productive citizen
I'll never run away from my pain, I prefer to live in it
Then document my pride in the peek of these perfect sentences
Prayin' that people feel it, I put my poems in proper pitch
Ain't no need for support, just believe if I ever make it
That I'll remember the doubt when nobody wanted to help
Had to get this shit by myself and I sacrificed all my time
But invested that in a craft and I broke it down to explain it
You'll see that it's simple math, I continue to bust my ass
As I work with the rarer focus promoted by segregatin'
You derelicts' demographic reactions, it is reality
I attacked and I tackled totalitarian temperament
Tenant attendance attempted, but never attended
Intended to take this metropolis, modernize it but modestly
Modifyin' monotony, mobilizin' monopoly
Makin' it mortify you, my mind is major and massive
The masses made me a martyr – I managed to use momentum
To minimalize opinions, maniacally they were given
I'm endin' this on a positive note, proceed with propriety
Do it without promotion, the media notoriety
Never exaggerate how I'm livin' is well below my means
Create the flawless flow for the fakers, the fornicators
Forsaken fame for I know that I'd rather really be honest
I'm on a different trajectory, but you are nowhere near me
I think that I'll speed it up 'cause I'm tired of speakin' this clearly

Yeah, I mastered the flow and they said ""he a beast""
I bettered the kid as you need
So what do you mean? You singin' I'm all in your dreams
That nigga is definitely clean
He painted a picture, recommended scene
You hearin' the most niggas into one fiend
You know that our work is a part of the dream
I guess that I struggle with everything
And that was the reason that we have created a plan
Of doin' it better than most of these niggas
But no one really understands
I live in the stanzas, I said that I'll play in my head
But now that I'm given the chance
A relevant nigga with negative stance, lawd!

""Aye, bitch, half my fans bitch! Don't nobody like that shit. There's a notebook on the motherfuckin' floor. January 12th, this is it! Rappin' it the fuck up.

White Lines,UnKnown,2016.0,"And I’ve got a couple of flows
You love my speed and I’m giving you all of my heart
Everything that I’m feeling inside don’t I confide on the records
Repugnant pundits that push agendas and pass judgment
My confidence consequently squandered, I’m being honest
These moments never lapse
I sit and watch them pass me
But still find time for the craft throughout the mist of madness
This mind numbing tactic has now been a major factor
What you see as monotonous becomes my daily practice
Studied the rhyme but from front to back till I know it all
Its every adjective, its every consonant, its every simile, verb, noun, its fortified
It’s for the soul but it’s all composed like a fragile mind

White lines, pretty baby, 
tattoos
Don't know what they mean
They're special, just for you
White palms, baking powder on the stove
Cookin' up a dream
Turnin' diamonds into snow

And my family worked they whole lives
I’ve seen em struggle and survive
That’s where I learned the meaning of sacrifice
To love someone so much that you put your dreams on the shelf
To provide a life for them that you never had for yourself
I recall all them nights at deep run, arguments over low funds, roaches inside the dresser
But never settle for less
All these rappers speak on progression as though they’ve actually seen it
This mindboggling selfishness
As though materialistic shit can fix all your problems in situations and instances
I’ve seen what money does to the soul
It muddies it
If there’s no moral compass
But you’ve amassed an amount of wealth
Then invest in a crucifix, an attempt at saving yourself
I can tell you it’s fucking hopeless but that would be pessimistic
The poster child, for contain negativity, I will never be
No longer am I lost in my thoughts, I’m doing the best I can
I have to put myself in their shoes, how hypocritical
Am I to judge what someone’s been through?
Or why the act they way they act and do the things that they do
It’s all perspective
We subject ourselves to different vices and my advice is be decisive with decisions you make
Don’t be overly obsessed
Find some balance and truth, everything in due time, it’s not as bad as you think
The frame you’re seeing things through
Just multiply it by two, and you’ll see a bigger picture than the one you currently view

White lines, pretty baby, tattoos
Don't know what they mean
They're special, just for you
White palms, baking powder on the stove
Cookin' up a dream
Turnin' diamonds into snow

And I wanted to make it I guess, how do i live with the criticisms?
People will give an opinion they put it upon a pedestal
A penny for your thoughts but I never asked for change
My work ethics ridiculous and yours is not the same
I swear to god and I wrote it all with a pure intention
The truest testament with no excess or false aesthetics
You couldn’t imagine or fathom the effort I’m exhuming
My heart and souls in the shit but yet they force me to prove it
Who in the fuck would’ve done it the way that I’ve done it with all of the pressure
No label backing, no facetious claims of independence, no hidden investor
This shit is developed in my mind
I pray to god and ask for strength and patience through these times
It’s to the point that I’m passed insane but it’s intertwined
4:30 AM, I’m up and my day has just begun
I’m living a life of focus
I’m giving you nothing but realness
But give it a couple a minutes, I swear you’ll hear all my devotion
Feel like I’m stagnant
I’m running in place
All of the time that I’ve invested have I spent it in vain?
Givin you a better effort, shouldn’t that work more?
Got me thinking to myself what I do all of this for
How you complain about the hatred but you accepting of love
So I take the good with the bad and I ignore the assumptions
I ain’t read comments in years ‘cause they won't do nothing for me
I never take for granted the fact I’m alive
It’s a blessing

White lines, pretty baby, tattoos
Don't know what they mean
They're special, just for you
White palms, baking powder on the stove

Knowledge, bitch

Look, said it's the big, bad wolf
Knockin' down your door again
I compose a selection of sentences for the masses
It's safe to say i'm celestial
Soar with the constellations
Spit verses of complications
Put concentrate on the cadence
Of course it was correlated
Come catch me casually coordinated
Fornicate with foreign languages
My flow is blasphemous
This bastard was conceived by the powers of the immaculate
The son of Mary Magdalene
 giving infinite wisdom
My message was not diluted by aesthetics or hypocrisy
I'm constantly concocting things with Constantine
I'm Socrates my sovereignty is seldom seen
As soon the sound'll stop the feat
The feast I'll feed your family for the sake of your sanity
Candidate I'm a narcissist, write as much as a novelist
Novices never feel it exposing plenty emotion
The purpose was  pose a podent, my potion you couldn't sip it
Addicted, and now you trippin' promethazine for parentheses
Emphasis I should make 'em cease
I'm a beast when I'm eating beats
I am very particular pick apart and then paragraph
Paraphrase in a paradigm, parallel to the pastor
That's preaching, selling eternal lies
As I supply the sicker line of dopamine that prey upon your mind
Then multiply the rhyme, divide to find the find the faculty
The fact remains that I am actually your fuckin' king you can call me your majesty
Masterfully maneuver my movements, sure to subdue yah
Solution is you salute then follow suit my lyrics fondle you
Molesting your mentality, now you in need of therapy
Not to mention prescriptions to put you in a sedated state
You describe the insanity, informing them how I got away
You shake and shiver from the somber thought just how I put it 
Now take us back to the place and the time of the crime
And tell me all about that maniac motivated maniacally
But biasedly beseeches with evidence of propriety
Priorly I was walking and minding my fucking business
And bumpin' ignorant rap about nothing another random ran
I saw him comin' so I ran, I never really had a chance
I tripped and took a look and he was standing with his frozen stance
The chosen man, they must've poked a hole when they created him
You gotta stop this nigga, he crazy, he wasn't having sense
Some sort of coincidence I was in that predicament
It's like he had predicted it all pause for the pitiful
He pointed to the pen and my pad and promised to puncture it
Started punchin' profusely, the reason that I was bleedin'
Believed that he woulda killed me if he had never stopped
I praying that don't listen I lay in a fetal position
Protecting myself from a blow to the body I'm feeling fragile though
He cracked my clavicle shattered some bones and broke a couple ribs
He said it's customary to cut the victim then watch'em leak
His stamina was something else
, he sliced and he slashed
Causing contusions, bruises and gashes, I'm gasping for air
I tried to find the will to fight but he had taken it from me
I must've blacked out then woke up, got attacked by a vulture
His language was vulgar,
 
I vaguely recall that, I called 911 no one answered the call back
I can't see, I can't think there's blood in my eyelids
My mind moving frantic, this man did some damage
My plan did not pan out, I pray that I don't see him again
He's about to blow up like Jihads
Insurgents from Islam, he's too calm, and so cold
The force was strong inside of this one, I never seen nothing like it
Enlightened by lack of resources, he had no fuckin' patience
Just pacin' back and forth my lifeless corpse in a balance
Adrenaline runnin' through me, and fuck it I'm feeling paralyzed
Apparently we met before he tried to explain
There's a decline within the music that had drove him insane
He couldn't take it anymore reflecting all of his pain
Inflicting the simple suffocation for ignorant publications
That praise to promote the popular even when its a detriment
That's affecting the innocents, sentences to a simpleton
Little do people know what they're choosin' for entertainment
Is actually more subliminal than they had imagined
You couldn't fathom what the fuck we're bein' fed on the daily
But quick sidetrack they're tryna take the labels for ingredients
Off of the food we eat so that we can no longer see it
Ingenious, take the power of knowledge away from people
To put em in the position where they're completely dependent on every word that you say
And they treat it like it's an artifact
Jumpin' Jehoshaphat, that's intelligence and attention
Too much to ask of the people
I'm pleadin' that you believe in me
Easily I defeat the seat the scene was set for you to see
It wasn't filled with money, women and diamonds for jewellery
I swear that I intended this soothing with something logical
Put it up in your mind so you know it wasn't impossible
To dominate the mind like a murder by K.A.A.N. the Conqueror",https://genius.com/Kaan-kaan-the-conqueror-lyrics
Stress,Abstract Art,2015.0,"I confess, I'm a mess
All I ever do is stress
I'm depressed than a mo'fucking nigga 
With a handful of pills trying to numb all of my pain
Tell me, do you motherfuckers even feel it?
Tell me, do you even feel it?
I've been writing all these records with resentment
Tryin' to find the happiness I never had, happiness I never had
I wish I could wake up early in the morning and realize the person that I really am, person that I really am
All the fuck I ever really feel is pain
And I don't think you could even understand
You could never understand
And all the fuck I ever really feel is pain
And I don't think that you could even understand
You could never understand
And I don't think that you could even understand
Nah

Hold up
Cause I don't think you’ll ever get it
Dismissing all of my issues and tell me to be submissive
Attentive whenever rappin'
I focus upon the tedious
I resemble my father, that's if we’re speaking of temperaments
Temporarily out of it
Falling off of an ottoman
Noddin’, bobbin’ and weavin’
I will depart out of my moccasins
While I swallow klonopins and I'm taking some mescaline, ketamine and excedrin
Ain't no need to exaggerate
But I'll elaborate
I am chemically imbalanced and killin' my serotonin from using drugs with no moderation
For daily sedation, I should be placed under observation
The fact that I'm faded is actually embarrassing
I see this as a vice and I'm using it as a crutch
But if I'm being honest with you
I think I fell in love with the thought of me dying young and not reaching my full potential cause
They never realize you’re great until you die
I - murder it all, I want to appease
I bet that I'm really a beast
I never release
I'm giving the people a feast the way that I'm killing the beat
You - loving it all enjoying the ride
I bet that you feeling the vibe
Is that what you want?
Fulfilling your needs?
Now give me a minute so I can proceed, Lord
Now this is not the life I really wanna lead
And all my pain is transparent; It's not that easy to see
I used to wanna be happy, it never actually happened
So I been feeling the same just trying to live with disdain

Tough luck, nigga, keep your fucking head up
They kicked you while you was down and now you refuse to get up
You medicating every single emotion that you feeling
You need to be in the dark to acknowledge all of your problems
You never speak of your issues unless you writing a song or two
You’re living with depression; its real and you fucking know its true
I'm guessing that it stems from the time when nobody noticed you
But that was years ago and you still stuck on the same shit
You need to get a grip
You dope as fuck and people tell you it
You need to be a man and start asserting all your confidence
You’re fucking 24 and you still can’t accept a compliment
You need to make a change
But I know I'm stating the obvious
And I wanna be better, but it's never that easy
Very vivid depiction of pictures that I've been painting
I promise you’ll feel my pain in a second
So ill explain:
Cause a couple years ago I couldn't even find a friend to call
And now you hit me up like
“I'm really loving your record, dawg”
And people never listen; I'm speaking bout being restless
I say I'm cutting my wrists and you telling me that its dope
I know you praying that I blow so we can 'all get rich'
“And if you make it, you can take me with you man
That would be it cause I've been down from the beginning
Boy, I knew you was the shit
Remember when I said that you would be the one to make a hit?”

Make you ingest my vernacular, master of all my abilities
Acrobatic, back and forth, I'm like an 
addict
Mr. ""Go And Get It"", 
gift to gab, I got it
Un-combative been to battles
, won 'em all
Flow ridiculous, sentences running on
Now they all opposed, no one fucking with me
That's okay 'cause I like my seclusion
They soon to succumb to the sound we created
I catered to no one but me and mines
Ain't no fucking handouts that was ever given
This is repetition at its finest, baby
I don't give a damn if anybody like it
Boy, I said that I do this for me, let's make it clear
I'm a demonstrative lyricist, literally in the infancy stages
I stated my purpose before, but they forcing my hand with this ignorance
I'm in the sinning the sense that I'm coming with purer intentions
I'm tempted to just take the scenic route
Got to figure out how we gon' make it happen
Time is not on my side in the midst of madness
I been so lost on the road I travel
Given everything I wanted, I let my pain unravel
I'm a singer, to writer, I'm like a poet I guess
None less than an era that was legendary
I took a plan and I mapped it out
In terms of energy I feel like I'm maxing out
How many times can you fail 'fore you just submit
No one is convinced, I'm in, but I want to get out
And my doubting just consumed
I've been thinking, ""What the hell I got to lose?""
A little bit of my pride, threw away food for thought
I'm getting rid of my ego as a way to progress
I want to humble myself, become meek and thankful
Just appreciate the talent that I was given
I want to maximize and to attain a lot
I send all praise to the most high, lawd!

Gimme a little bit of peace, I don't ask for much
There's no comparison to me, I'm just a bastard, bruh
The way I'm mixing with the words, I make a massacre
You hear the pain in my rhymes, spectacular
But then you pass it up and then move on
My shit looked over like it's not a threat
It takes a lot of time, I want to get you convinced
But when I hit you with this shit, it makes opinions switch
I better get the recognition that I really deserve
The style is superb, the one that they rather defer
And I patiently oppose hipocracy but don't patronize me in the least
Unleash my words of wisdom when the verse is finished
Never ever change with my tone and temperament
I channel my wrath from out the Old Testament
I lost it all like King Solomon
But I be getting it back, I tell a vigorous tale
A visionary what I am, but nobody believes
I'm trying to keep it all together, but I might conceive
My mic check sound nice, one-two, I done it. Been doubted from the beginning, I swear that I is
I'll give a simple example, the way that music is handled
I make a mandatory margin, I'm walking my territory
I'ma tell it like it is, but from my perspective
I can't fabricate, I'ma put my truth on the page
I could care less if it's accepted
You done seen my growth from inception
Search for profession, I pray that we prosper
The problem for me is I just want my happiness
Hope that it happens through records
But I can't imagine that I'ma do this shit forever, lawd!

I need some time for myself, I stay away from the rest of them
I just don't trust anybody, emotionally I'm invested
Selfish, centered, part it, walk up on it, bent the path
I'm passing the negative point of view, I move in silence, said I soothe and save
I sanctify the vein, I rectify the pain
I paint a picture, pay attention
Want your help to spread the message, like the gospel
This apostle never puts the faults in the form of my faith
I cannot take it, so I fade away, but my fate was predetermined
Got the firm belief that what I leave is a legible legacy
Blessings that came from the Lord
But I wasn't prepared to receive 'em at all
Hit you with the cynical energy, I'ma send you a sign
And I'll put it inside of a rhyme for your mind to grow
I'll take all the pain that I ever had and no one could see
I kept bottled up, gotta progress, get better, step back
Just let me, I don't make an excuse, I've been to war
I got to elevate it, take you to a level that nobody has been
I'm in a different mindstate, I feel like its time to attack
I never relax, a lab boy emitted to gas
To give you some, in California where it never rains
Gonna take a whole lot of work and I'm motivated to get it
Sacrificed and every one of my goals

Pick up my difficult flow
The pick and the roll
The way that I give and I go
A literal Tyrant
That’s taking the time to explain
The way that I studied the game
Perfecting the craft
Presented you more
I make it a point to define that I'm finding
That people in love with the fake
I said that I move at a sickening pace
The picture I paint
Is filled with the feeling and sentiment
Sending you positive affirmations
Giving you lyrical affidavits
Niggas are making exaggerations
Never created facade
I pray to the gods
Thank you for giving me life
A talented flow I’m invested
And I understand I have to stay focused
I know what I know it's the
The notion I'm making you sick and
I’m quicker to get with a flick of a wrist
When I pick up a pen
The prophecies spilling
I gotta get better
To sharpen my skills
It is a hunger that's fit for the harder
I’m peeling, not peeling the cap
I’m taking it back
And I'm feeling very apart
The people not really accepting these thoughts
They lie on the records, I'm giving the truth
The fact of the matter is I am aloof
But what can I do?
Continue to work at a rate
That nobody has actually seen
So I’m never leaving the house
Except when I gotta record
The minimal force
That most of these niggas have shown
They plagiarizing like attack of the clones
The reason I’m going as hard as I do
I’m fluent in different ethics
But work is the one that is truly effective
Investing my time, investing my mind
I feel like it’s worth it
I favor my isolation
Saving a place with nobody's opinion
I pray and I hope that it works
My spirit it hurts
My soul has been going berserk
I cannot take all the ignorance
Stripping the youth of their innocence
Witnessing children we see as the future
They throwing their lives away
The party and bullshit
Bipartisan pulpit
You’re one of the cool kids
But acting a fool yeah? Ha
Look inside yourself
Or search your soul
To find a purpose

I'm feeling great about myself
And don't the sky look blue?
And don't the grass seem greener than it normally do?
I got nothing but love for you baby
I got nothing but love for you honey
I'm feeling great about myself
And don't the sky look blue?
And don't the grass seem greener than it normally do?
I got nothing but love for you baby
I got nothing but love for you honey

Now can I can kick it?
Nigga yes you can!
But can I kick it?
Nigga yes you can!
I float away inside my mind
I’m feeling high
I float away inside my mind
I’m feeling fine
Now can I can kick it?
Nigga yes you can!
But can I kick it?
Nigga yes you can!
I float away inside my mind
I’m feeling high
I float away, I float away
I float away, I float away

Taking it back to a time
Oh when integrity was a priority
Purposely putting your life on the line of the page
And the lyrics you wrote with a pen and that
Everything you would say on a record
Was actual fact
You made a relatable track
But that will not get you paid
They don’t want your pain
They want you to be like the rest of these lames
That love to conform by sickening form
They praising  people adorn
And I’m feeling torn
I know I can switch it
And give you the negative
Dumbing it down and
Remake it repetitive
The lesson I learned
Is stay to yourself
Believing in rhetoric
That never helps
Just do what you love
And try to focus on your passion
Thinking of your life and
The things that you want to accomplish
Sacrificing is a steady and constant
I know it’s hard when
You’re lacking your confidence
Constantly haunted by all the
Mistakes that you made in the past
You gotta progress and let go of stress
Finding the beauty in difficult times
Relieving the pressure you work on your mind
Reliving the moments that
Made you the person you are
I swear that it will get you far
But never depend on the
People you feel like you need
Don’t ever think you need a friend
I used to think I was strange
Or maybe insane
But I wouldn’t have it any other way
Keep it a 100
I give you the gospel
And you coulda seen that
My shit was the truth

Consider me one of the best, you can attest, my lyrics upon
Your prodigal sons, passing you prominence never puns
I promise I punish mine when I'm punching pages with pens
You can pretend, never assuming that you know me at all
A post-apocalyptic policy, Pentecostal apologies
Apostles prophesied from the power that I preceded
With Poseidon with the proper propaganda endorsed
I propose a toast with propofol to make a lethal injection
My flow could slice and cut your gut like a cesarean section
Very selective when deciding when to make an incision
I said my mind is an annuity, stories like Mephistopheles
My legend shall ascend to the level of Greek mythology
And everything is factual, pathological fallacies
Have never been allowed as I lie upon Zeus' cloud
And you follow this young Apollo that plays with a golden lyre
And I feel that I shall adhere to these allegations complicitly
A system I'm sadistic, cinematic's an atrocity
Simplistically consistent of sorrows and many sins of similes
And homonyms with Homeric hymns for your friends
And you feel it like sharp syringes, it's soft essence was soothing
It sterilizes the negatives, cerebral as a sedative
Inside my active mind, in time I find that I'm ingenious
Odysseus' legendary, eloquent speaker
Cunning and coming for the knowledge that you claim to be carrying
Suffocating and I exit on my four-horse chariot
Galavant with generosity, all you rappers are Hermes
Another god of commerce, but tell me what your soul worth
I converse, in a concert, never concerned with yo content
In a convent, and it makes sense, I am all in, not complex
Like I been invested in a sicker vision, I can see it's something that the people needed
Write another rhyme, it's like the pen is leaking, I am at the beacon with a happy preacher
And a pessimist that's talking blasphemous
Bring it back, the flow is too amazing, I am innovating, you are emulating
You're insinuated, you are on the level, you can never be, as I proceed to teach
And I have built a fort that you can never breach
You wasn't ready for me, feeling incomplete, please don't compete, you will not beseech
You are obsolete, I am far from weak, my seinen represent to me
When it's looking bleak, be the first to preach, I guarantee, you can't crack my faith
Got up-scored taste, but the kid don't wait, my fate, if you really wanna hold your breath
Vocab impress, my mind's a mess, I stress about my death a lot
The solitary seat I'm spinning, it's sitting in Camelot
I'm the head of the table, decapitate with Excalibur
Calibrated my consciousness, it's of a higher caliber
Thirty feet in diameter, my poetic pentameter
Passes the condescending, it's consequences of misery
Viciously vindicate, liberate, but its expeditions leave as Plymouth Rock, the pompous place  this place composing my all
I picked the perfect hemisphere like where humanity start, and was innovated, raped, and pillaged, now it's dearly departed
Indigenous people possessing prominence that was regal
It was Kings and High Priests, but now we believe in Jesus
Blue-eyed and blonde hair for gentrifying the thesis and descending us to something, slaves, I cannot conceive it
But you take it as the gospel and think that it's concrete
We could start in Ephesians, Psalms, and maybe Ezekiel
Now let us testify when you died as high in the sky
It was documented in Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus, Now in the beginning, God created heavens and Earth
It was formless and filled with darkness that reigned all over the surface, the spirit of the omnipotent hovered over the water
Divided the day and night and then said ""Well let there be light""
Now ain't that great, but where's the evolution of that verse
And if it was written by a man, well then there's lies in them words
I think that we were given religion so we questioning less
Obsessing over all of your instincts, worry about what they think They giving false opinions like it mattered at all
Not to mention many wars that all these deities started
As we crusade into to the current, I noticed the recreation of ignorance in the mind of this impotent generation
I think that I'll take it deeper, look how you viewing these places
Of infinite destitution, no resolution for poverty
Your Western Ideologies, only causing illusions
That's similar to mirages, remarkable mental martyrs
That marginalize the struggle, a load that you never carrying
So everyone that's from the middle east is now a terrorist
Embarrassing that you can't even see what it is
We from a place that takes the culture that we don't understand
Then tell the people how to live and while we raping yo land
And taking every natural resource you have at your hand
And you can have it back, of course, it's for a discount price
There's no remorse within the fact that we have ruined your life
We gotta make sure that our vices and our pockets contrite
But you don't like it, not at all, so what you gon' do, fight? shit
Get a steady hand, and finished plan, and you get infiltrated by a white man
With a lot of guns, and the biggest bomb, please don't move, we got napalm
So your plan's warped, put your hands up, We gon' need the oil, yeah all of it

Can't nobody do it with this side or
This motherfucker is mine I shut it down I wonder now
Where I been and I'm finna'  get it
Who the fuck is gonna stop me?
You listening to a sicker type of nigga
Definitive when I'm killing them
I'm a villain on the MIC
I need more IV's
Intravenous  lyrics that are coming out of MD
I'm no one to envy I swear that I'm not
You do not know what I've been through but listen
I promise you'll never imagine I'm asking for silence
At least for a second
I'm masking my pain in a way that's a proper record
I sacrifice that to the Lord
Man I got faith in the path that I've chosen for sure
I want the legacy not the allure
Your misleading illusions are not for the boy",https://genius.com/Kaan-circles-lyrics
Flowers,UnKnown,2015.0,"You could say ya don’t need me
But with the energy I put inside of every track
I guarantee that I can make it look easy
Motherfucker better believe
That we are given a grievance
Nigga never receded to the back of the line
Every time that I rhyme it blows your whole mind
To divine from a sign the illegitimate grind
Of a man that was trying to expand his horizons
Looking at a pen and a pad
And I gotta find a source of innovation
More inspiration, procrastination won’t save the masses
The way that I’ve been setting an example for you bastards
No I’m not bashful, time has been passing
Every single second devoted to my passion
Pray my dedication is never put in a casket
The way that I’ve been rhyming and flowing I gotta have it
Givin’ my all as I do when your shit is the truth
There’s no reason to lie
I defy with these intricate lyrics
A derelict spirit, I pray to the Lord
Tell me the reason why I am still grieving
I’m depressed as fuck and looking for the meaning
While fiending and dreaming of sanity
Yes and I wish I was in this calamity
Less if I’m actually blessed and I wouldn’t confess
That my mind is obsessed with that beautiful death
Taking my time so that I murder the beat
And everything a nigga do is just greater
I disintegrate you with the incinerator
Residuous lyrics and motherfucker no fable
The labour of love, they judge but I was never for the fake
It’s delayed, let’s delay for the sake of the sound
And I found that the pain is the perfect companion
To finally understand that the man has been outstanding
This is outlandish, you take for granted
I said I got a vision, I put it up on a canvas
I am not candid, you would give us semantics
My mind is manic, flow will cause cancer
Please do not panic, the peace that I seek
Is the peak that departed regardless of conscious
A call to the constant, eliminate hate
So it breaks from the content
Reflects in the concept
Pick it up with the bass and the beat
As I pause for a second
I wanted to give a message
I never make guarantees and I promise the beat
Is sickest nigga you never seen
As I fuck up the beat till it’s unrecognizable
Tell me that's plausible, not what’s impossible
Toppling obstacles, make it applaudable
Fuck with this sound that's affecting your audio
Often I find myself off of the path
As I clash with a sense of identity
Sentences filled with the pain that I’m feeling
Concealing, revealing
I’m willing to go to the brink
And I'm praying my ship never sink
‘Cause I think I can solve any problem
I drown in a drink, on the edge of insanity
Panic and pray and my prominence
Put in part of the cadence, complacent, whatever
What I do is better than most of these niggas
You claiming your favourite
Debate if I make it you never relate
Been relaying the work that I speak is the gospel
I eat with apostles but not you impostors
It’s proper to foster the truth
So we find all the honesty
Some may see as intuition it’s out of division
Permission is needed to step in my presence
The essence of everything that I am preaching
Beseeching the people by showing we’re equal
Not evil, deceitful like most of them be
When they slave 'bout materials, we're never free
It’s a fucking disease or a pretence of rhetoric
Try to repent for your sins ‘cause at the beginning
We’re given no room with no way
If I stay in this random position I’m in
My definity was to excel, with the love I expel on the page
And the hate I contain
Is the reason I know that I’m going to Hell

Chill Bill Rmx,UnKnown,2016.0,"Started with nothing, came to this conclusion
You was blessed with a talent nigga I suggest you use it
But don't forget to practice, never take this shit for granted
It can leave as it quick as it came
Don't reach for the fame, it's fleeting
And when they shower you with compliments ignore it
Never sleep there's people working cause they're hungry and young, and they would love to fucking take your spot and massacre ya
So I'll just cool for a second let that all sink in
Fuck it
Bring the bass in, you see the way I write it
The feel was never confided, the rhymes, a nigga supplied it
My fam was never divided, right now I'll take pride in, the fact that we do this alone without no help
Homie stopped going to class so we could add to the process
And Jason threw me bread for the tour that fell through
Never got a return, but a lesson was learned
I only fuck with a few, no entourages at all
My name ain't Vision Chaser - so Nah they're ain't no turtles evolved
I heard this shit in Oklahoma coming right behind the wheel
We ridin' in Marissa's Jeep, the volume louder than the B.R
Mothafucker haters I ain't worried bout a peon
I been on my solo dolo shit no need to speak on
Creepin' with a light skin boy that look like Tebow
But nigga I don't want it, you can have her I don't need her
I'm concerned with getting better never laid with a whore
Niggas stressing over pussy then they start procrastinating
I got nothing but time and patience, I know that self-preservation is really the key
Acute is my Midas Touch, I got the mind of a genius
Genuine gesture I make
Sam just sent me a text said ""Nigga that shit tough""
But the next one that he sent is that I'm still ugly as fuck
Hope my niggas never change, that we always stay the same
Regardless of the funds or the lack thereof
Shit, I'm trying to put all of my niggas on a payroll
No longer struggling and stressing over what I can't control
I put faith inside my skill, I took the time to make immaculate
So my imagination made it possible to rap like this
You call me Mr. Rap po I wrap it up and ravish it
I'd rather be broke and honest then crook and living lavishly
And this is god's work, I sit back and let him do it
Riding with the holy spirit, praise Jehovah hallelujah
How you doin' bitch I'm chilling won't you mind your fucking business
Lord forgive me for my sins and my selfishness
I'm just a cold young poet I can't help this shit
I'm trying to keep a level head, but see my ego getting bigger
Lately I been feeling like I just don't fuck with anybody
Everytime I watch the news I see another black corpse
On the ground blood spilt and the killer was a cop
How you fear for your life when you carrying a gun
Then you wonder why we see them and our instinct is to run
Innocence is now a crime when your skin is filled with melanin
Moving from many cities when there wasn't many development
Now anyone can get it I'ma tell you my theory
I don't think that you'll enjoy what you about to hear
I just pray that God protects us, they closin' down private sectors
Prisons pay for a business so the longer your sentence is
More money in their pocket, don't you get it my nigga
When they can't lock us up another way to oppress us
Is to show their dominance, so they love to depress up
It's a domino effect in a game that we can't win
Yeah they let you get some money, but your ass gets taxed
So when your mind becomes enlightened
Then yo' ass gets waxed, thats the sickest shit in the world
And a system with disadvantages
Allows a child to see a man murdered upon the camera
But let his family mourn for a second or two
There's no compassion if you black and I'm sorry but thats the truth when they looked at Alton Sterling all they saw was a thug, Not a man with a family, a wife and a child, if you apalled by it all, boy that means that you sleep
And if you in the black community you already know
Brothers are losing their children for nothing from the brutality
Homie this is our reality to exist of futility
Lawd, eh",https://genius.com/Kaan-chill-bill-rmx-lyrics
Illumination,Abstract Art,2015.0,"Stop wondering how I do it
I am the dopest, I thought that you knew this
And I never fabricate
I'd rather concentrate
Writing these records till my fingers blister
The picture I'm painting
The vivid description
The vision, lyricism, niggas I written
I rose from the rubble
You'll never surpass it
The phoenix that flew
With the truth of the masses
I'ma get a motherfuckin' sound that you regurgitated
People lookin' at me like you really want it elevated
Never hesitated
Take my brain out while I meditated
I was highly medicated
Save your reservation
For another cadence, you could try to keep up with the pace
If you put me in the Cypher with niggas, I'm out of place
I murder an instrumental, turn it into fragments
Spittin the fast raps a mother fucking distraction
I cultivate a different sound that I would give em
Just a little mother fucker that was coming out of Maryland
Captivate them with lyrics
I guarantee I embarrass them
And take them on a ride
Make sure they feeling the vibe
My flow is really alive
And you was lookin surprised
At the way this mother fucker would make a rhythm collide
It was difficult depending on the way that I say it
And what a nigga displaying, I bet I make a statement
I was caught up in a vision of giving
Cause I was reliving
Now give me your fucking minute
So people can feel this sentence
I kill em with kinaesthetics
While keepin it copacetic
But niggas are prototypical
People fake as prosthetics
And I'll probably never get it
I swear to God that I'm honest
The definition of truth, the proof is in my compite
Plus I got a couple mother fucking bodies in the closet
With a new noose hanging from the ceiling revealing
I was alone for a while as a child
I would live inside my isolation
My self preservation's amazing
On several occasions
I came to a somber conclusion
That life's an illusion
Confusing, the way that I view it
Is darker than you and yo kinfolk
So keep with the tempo
By giving you vast amounts of info
I pray I'm forgiven for sins before I go
Never been the same
See I been a nigga  that's giving effort that you would never forget
And you was quick to expect
This mother fucker to talk about some ignorance
A diamond color chain, it's a pain when the colors change
When it's glistening
So now I got you motherfuckers listening
Positionin myself to where my intentions are interjectin’
If I ever make it then realism is in effect
I give an intermission the vision for what you lack
And it's actual fucking content
Don't you have a conscience
This myriad of topics and you was speaking that non sense
The Shit that I provided was similar to an antidote
My educated guess is impressin
And I'm professing
That I was given the prominence
Complements of the most high
A salaam aleikum aleikum salaam for the nigga with the bowtie
What is a material, I'm ready for the afterlife
I got a date with destiny, my ridiculous appetite
I eat that mother fucker, you probably wouldn't believe it
The beat is leaking a liter whenever that nigga speakin
I said that my shit's egregious, the legacy I was leaving
I'm feigning to find my sanity
Sanctifying on my inhibition
You know that I'm abusing
I wouldn't ever retrieve it
You know that I could proceed ya
Got the existential feeling they want it from the beginning
I try to make it apparent
They focus up on appearance
And what a nigga was wearing
Apparent never opinion
That mother fuckers were giving
And I was living to die
I wanted to make a masterpiece
I'm working like a starving artist departed from fallacies
I'm feeling like a mental patient, my life is insanity
They put me on a pill to differentiate a fantasy from actual reality
Self esteem is a casualty
I'm acting so erratically
Imagining a life I know that I could never lead
And I'm encompassing everything that you should never be
Cause you fell in love with the melody
While ignoring the message
The undertone of the reckoning is really reactionary
It varies upon the words and the people that I would say it too
Defending you
To try and free your mind is what I'm finna do
My vision wasn't miniscule
And when you at the bottom is when the person'll ridicule
I pray it never gets to you
I promise if you keep it cool
And stay composed and everything you do
Will have a better view
But that's if your intentions were honest from the beginning
When you do it for the love and you never receive a penny
And people just see the product and follow it up when they be
Automatically assume that your money is on boom
And find the prodigal son
And I get the crucifixion, resurrected on the seventh day
I need a fucking witness
They could document it and show you I was legendary
I've been feeling like a God repentance is necessary

Lord! Fuck with it
I'll just talk a bunch of random shit, I don't give a fuck
(laughs) Abstract Art, download that shit if you haven't yet
It's not out now, while we're recording this
It's gonna be out by the time we're done recording

Sorrow (syrup rmx),Abstract Art,2015.0,"Lord...
Said all I got is my pain
Come watch me drown in my sorrows
I'm petrified of today
And I pray I don't wake tomorrow
Cuz all I got is my pain
Come watch me drown in my sorrows
I'm petrified of today
And I pray I don't wake tomorrow
And I just hope the lord forgive me for my sins
Cuz I'm back to medicating all my issues once again
Once again
All I got is my pain
Come watch me drown in my sorrows
I'm petrified of today
And I pray that I don't wake tomorrow
I blow your mind with these rhymes
I paint a picture with words
My inspiration is agony
Tell me that ain't absurd
Try to break it with the flow, make a mothafucka feel it
Nigga either way you cut it, could you really tell the difference?
I would never try to be somebody they consider phony or fake
Go take another nigga's style then recreate it
No fabrication
Or exaggeration
My imagination
Been infatuated
With the other side
But my maturation
Wasn't comfortable
I left lacerations
On both wrists, on my sleeve stain
When that blood drip, I wasn't fascinated
With the facts of life
But I was terrified of my isolation
Man lately
I've been feeling down and out so proceed with caution
Cuz a nigga like me got used to losses
I've been living in a world that's imaginary
And I wonder is the realism necessary
Just had a premonition of a cemetery
And a grave plot with my name on it
I'ma treat it like a motherfuckin reservation
But the way that I've been living
It's the confirmation
Played the game and lost;
No consolation
Let a young nigga preach to the congregation
I'ma tell the truth on my pure pew
It might take a minute
Done a lot of sinnin
Never had a friendship, I was contemplating
Suicidal thoughts up on the fucking daily
And it manifested into my depression
Netted to my problems as an adolescent
Goddamn!
Gimme a second to set the scene
So to finally understand what the fuck I really mean
In a world full of hate you desecrated my dream
Realize they could never 
understand
 me demanding about an ounce of respect
To attest to the fact that I'm finally coming into my own
With a moment to atone
Tell em all that I murdered a microphone
With a story that was talking
To the minuscule minds of the masses, wasn't even ready for the bass
Or the motherfucking master
The young lyrical phenom
The master got a beating, I suffocated, I breathe on
I'm looking for a god damn reason
But I'm barely alive
I comprise the bereavement
And when a nigga in it I spit it with cohesion
The medicated mind of a mothafucken heathen
Hes down to the ground and nobody believes him
I wonder if I'll ever lose faith in the process
Don't, motherfucker try and focus on the progress
A low self esteem can easily impede on the mind of a person that's working to proceed
Elevated to a level that no one has ever seen
And my mind ain't right I can never stay sober
Negative attitude when I feel like it's all over
I came in the world with a question, but I was never given the courtesy of an answer
Instead I was left with, a soul full of hate, you could see it in my eyes
All I wanted was the love that I was deprived of, that was pushed to the side
With any type of compassion you wouldn't give a fuck if a nigga wasn't rapping
You're young and you're black
They see you as a distraction
We're all slaves on the inside
Even though you want to think that you're free
Please never believe it
Damn
Yeah, Uh-huh
All I got is my pain
Come watch me drown in my sorrows
I'm petrified of today
I pray I don't wake tomorrow
Yeah, Uh-huh, Look, Yeah
And I just hope the lord forgive me for my sins
Back to medicating every single issue once again

All I got is my pain
Watch me drown in my sorrows
Petrified of today
I pray I don't wake tomorrow

Bout it Bout it,1/12/199?,2015.0,"All that I wanted was my self-respect
I never got it so now I feel crazy
My confidence left
And now I cannot muster the courage
To get the fuck outta the house
And nobody's allowed in
Beside of the mind of this insecure man
But I don't understand how you feel
You relate to me
Maybe it's not what you thought
Cause you do not live in my position
Efficiently finding a bottle of pills
Effectively forcing myself to ingest
I must attest
I used to speak with the lord
Pray for forgiveness of sins
Believing the stress
But fuck it I'm off of my meds
I don't have time to think about a religion
For instance
I live life so terrible sinister
Sarcastic assassin he asking for peace
And I promise to change if you let me be free
But I bet that you won't I can feel the restraints
And I'm anxious in public I should be alone
I don't want interactions
I turn off my phone so I shut off the lights
And I pull in the blinds
And I sit and reflect about sickening times
When I saw that nobody was there for me
Luckily I had myself and that's all that I needed
Proceeded to sulk in the solace of silence
I'm in isolation no people around me
I'm drowning, I'm hoping that shit will get better
I want to be happy I used to be positive
But it was life that was beating me down
By the time I matured i'm preferring the negative
I'm at the point that i'm planning my funeral service
I'm sure that I probably won't make it
I got no love in my heart I am vacant
Do not approach me don't ever mistake it
I'm pessimistic and passing out hatred
I can't recall when I went through these changes
I pray the death that I receive is painless
On the front page of the news now i'm famous
Isn't it crazy that you get attention the day that you die
But the rest of your life it's just filled up with sins
Shall we indulge in the rest of our vices material woes
That we do not need
I still tried to kill myself several times
Before I finally saw what this life is about
It's the reason I die
Why you coming at me?
Those are intentions i've already seen
Just turned to commercial commodities
To showing your face to these people
That could give a fuck about you and your personal well-being
I know that you're feeling alone
We could take that and make it a catalyst
Capitalizing off your lack of happiness
That's a distraction that no one will see
Don't you want money and lots of attention
Attempting to turn you into a disgrace of the dollar
Someone could have spent on new medication
The therapy sessions is given to you
You're coming  anew
Cause you are the man that they all want to be
And I'm certain that you will sit comfortably
Right at the top where nobody can touch you
And now you're perspective becoming disgusted
You got everything but you feel like you nothing
You empty inside but you wanted relief
Self-mutilation to deal with the grief
Said to hail mary i'm hoping to be
More mentally stable so that I can breathe
I'm needing some help and I truly believe
My life is in shambles and I cannot reprieve
When I talk to a priest  then he'll tell me to see the omnipotent
We have not spoken in years and I lost the connection
Do you have his number?
Stop passing collections I don't have no money
Supporting your services
You're not a soldier for Christ or a leader for God
I can see the deceit in your eyes
You're an average man like I am
But you find you a hustle that's gonna pay all of your bills
So my nigga be real
Cause my soul is deluded
So what should I do
Can you tell me the truth
And don't say repent
My time it was spent
On nothing but ignorance
I need a razor blade so I can finish it
I am indifferent
Distant and dipping inside of myself
I cannot see what I'm made of
I'm taking a whole lot of shit but I don't anymore
You pay attention for what is in store
It's so legendary it needs a folk lore
You'll fall in love with it and then you'll want more
But this is something that you cannot afford
It don't have a price
I just want love
Honesty passion and all the above is that too much to ask
Gotta move forward can't live in the past
Stuck in depression can't get off my ass
And I'm tense as a bitch I can never relax
But I'm ready to die, see that is a fact

You and I, no we are not alike
See, you the type to do this shit for fame
And me, well I'm insane, I could've never changed
I swear that all these pussy rappers, they're the same

They got their diamonds out, that's for the photo-op

Got a line of them hoes and they comin' in?
Got a lot of them bitches, just bring em in

Sip it 'til you're comatose and feelin' fine
Your favorite rapper does it for the inspiration
Oh, he does it for the inspiration?
I don't know about anybody that's been poppin' Percocets because they listen to Future
I just know a couple people that grew up as scholars and turned into losers
Steal from their mothers and brothers
The almighty dollar, their addiction, what they covet
Run in your house before you knew whodunit
Take the food out your mouth and the kitchen cupboard
With the topics that you're covering in your lyrics
Like the end is here I know you niggas fear it
When the rapture come it sound like Teen Spirit
I hear Gabriel playin' his horn now
Check this shit here, it's a war now
We got that shit anymore huh
Me, myself, and I, of course bruh
I treat this shit like a sport, I
Would play your songs but that's torture
I relieve the stress with a tour jet
You've never jumped off the porch black
Nah, nah, nah
See, me? I was never lackin'
With the flows a-packin'
Let the Hateful Eight and Minnie’s Haberdashery
Been inside the room, that's where my habitat is
Because I avoid it all like Trump with the taxes
Couldn't go to college
I ain't get my master's
Still the bastard I knew I was
I dropped out and got right to it
Heard actions speak
And I'm quite fluent
Shit stupid is as stupid does
But that stuff y'all love is remedial, lawd

Rather talk about the best when they can't even tell the difference

You was pourin up a liter gettin thrown to the left
I was plottin' on my own Lord, hell to the yes
Patience darling, pace yourself, believe in something
Faith can help
The Almighty I'm praying to, so there's no one that I cater to
With a little work, I know I'll make it through
I say grace and then move
High stakes never takin' no food off of my plate
I stay spittin the real to make em migrate
I can't live in the moment this shit is planned out
You can't fuck with the kid, I feel like the man now

I've seen a life a nigga really wanna lead
Pick up a pen and a pad. I bust my ass to obtain that shit and I'mma spit the realest
Fact off of the bat like im a almanac fucking insomniac hypochondriac writing a rhyme scheme
Living out a pipe dream
The moment the light beams means that the flow is streamed
From the brain of this young rap fiend
I'mma kill it like nobody ever did it
You dig it, I know you feel it, you tripping that’s if you listen but I’m different
Not associated with your opinions
Seperatin' myself from your averages and percentages
Pity plenty of rappers
I’m cockin back and extracting
The bullet is metamorphic informin' you of the rap shit
They capture a simple bastard and place him down in the pasture
A pedicle’s for the passer to pass them off to  the coroner
Try to corner the marker ,cathartic catholicism, apparently its appalling
Averring to your appearance, appearing as the imperial
Prepare the proposition and compare us in a map
It's effecting my opposition, but the money’s a facade
And its a captivating vision
To capitalize upon the way that other niggas livin'
But the truth is in my sentences
Send it so you can sense that
I’m suicidal as fuck and that's something i’ll never censor
My god

I been staring at the pages where the pain is
Thinking what the fuck I gotta do to become famous
And put my niggas in a position where they can make it
I let my niggas know i got them if they
(need something) (need something) (need something)
I let my motherfucking niggas know i got them if they ever
(need something) (need something) (need something)
I let my mother fuckin' niggas know-ow

And I feel that I’m getting better
My recipe is exact when attacking an instrumental
Defendin' the fundamentals
I said that I break it down, so I turn it into a science
Defiant never compliant
Confiding in when you find me
Defining the definition of dedication and preparation
On my reputation
My repetition is surreptitious, very vicious when I vandalize
The victim's mind ,various visuals
Literal never minimal
Minuscule like a liberal
Live with the unforgettable
Guess I wasn't forgivable
Give in to my profession
Perfectin' what I attest to do
And yes I been the shit
But I thought you bitches already knew
I give a clue and keep it true
But what’s the use?
I’m not given respect
So I be comin' for your motherfuckin neck
Whenever feelin' vexed
It's not about the dollar bill and check and still I cook a rep
My lyrics is inject and I pray my niggas are patient
I promise we up next
God damn

I been staring at the pages where the pain is
Thinking what the fuck I gotta do to become famous
And put my niggas in a position where they can make it
I let my niggas know i got them if they
(need something) (need something) (need something)
I let my motherfucking niggas know i got them if they ever
(need something) (need something) (need something)
I let my mother fuckin' niggas know-ow

I'm infatuated with death and I don't even understand it
But dead to me yes i'm madness
I'm takin' complete advantage of the point
That you motherfuckers could barely even manage
To manufacture this ass and the fact of the matter is
That I manifest and manipulate
What you cannot reciprocate
And Imma regulate what I originate
While you just a imitate
Or recreate
And try to emulate as I assimilate, Never debate
The flow intimidates
They tell me slow it down, using the water, make it concentrated
As a thought that I would never put into consideration
Rather make the illest compilation with the nasa patient
That I have a self destruct type of
Human nature in need of a savior
I’m spiralin' in my depression
Regressing as I remember the memories
Of her breasts sitting right up on my chest
Until my confidence compress
Nigga I just wanna rest
And I cannot deal with the stress
I'm constantly having less

I been staring at the pages where the pain is
Thinking what the fuck I gotta do to become famous
And put my niggas in a position where they can make it
I let my niggas know i got them if they
(need something) (need something) (need something)
I let my motherfucking niggas know i got them if they ever
(need something) (need something) (need something)
I let my mother fuckin' niggas know-ow

These niggas love to procrastinate
And proposition women
The problem is promiscuity protruding through your vision
I'm consistent with the effort to never
Effect my ethics
Immortalizing my self on the record for your impression
Confessin I got the mind of a manic depressive adolescent
Convalescent conversating contemplating through the lesson
Affecting infectious connections for your conception
I'm blessing what i'm ingesting
Progressing within this section
I been at it for a year and a half and stayin' committed
I swear that I'll never quit it convincing through my convictions
Was the lifted lyricism, a passion for writing poetry
I guess a conscious flows the reason they never noticed me
Supposedly these niggas be workin'
I really doubt it, they clouded the game with impotence
And nothing new was interesting
It's like selling pussy, prostituting music industry
And that’s the type of shit that you niggas wanna hear
Seriously?

I been staring at the pages where the pain is
Thinking what the fuck I gotta do to become famous
And put my niggas in a position where they can make it
I let my niggas know i got them if they
(need something) (need something) (need something)
I let my motherfucking niggas know i got them if they ever

Focused, and I'm working on the craft

Look, my style too ill, no exaggeration
Can't get like this with procrastination
I'm a slave for the craft, no master, baby
All I can think about is making records lately
I've been workin' like I'm livin' on a mission
I'm efficient', but the vision wasn't given
To the niggas that was sitting on the sideline watchin'
They can see you strugglin'
Trippin' and fallin', but no one helps you out
Look, I know the feeling of being alone
I've come to terms with decisions I've made
But I pray everyday and I hope that I'm safe
If I send you this song, will you send me some positive energy?
Please, I am begging you for it
I'm forcing myself to feel something euphoric
Of course it's important, to point out the beauty in life
That I see like a minuscule witness
The muse for the music that people have muted
Confuse it for ignorance, that is not me, tho'
I creep low and see more, but my lack of C notes is see through
Be set in the tone of my messages
Negative outlook is getting repetitive
I am regressing, progression's my nemesis
My pessimism is potently powerful
Wordsmith, I might play around with their volatile

Never let you muthafuckas defeat the kid
Spitting egregiousness
Do you agree with it?
Never see them again, I'm a seed in the ground
I ascend to the light with the lines that I write
And my rhymes got girth, like Im foresting the earth
All I ever do is work, I'm asserting my worth
This is something I was taught since my birth
And you will attain nothing by sitting around
And to receive a blessing, you must do for self
As an means to an end, so that one day you'll help
Someone that you see struggling, just like yourself
And I can't justify why I do what I do
When I act how I act and thats far from the truth
If I told you my story, then you would past judgement
Disgusted by what you hear in that discussion
I swear that I've witnessed some sickening, cynical rituals
Pitiful pray that the pinnacle presents some pieces
I preset my presence, a pretense apart
With no beef and im starving
Ive barely started of carving my name in this game
I'll explain, but I gotta move fast
Get a point of view quicker, I'm a catastrophic nigga
Definitive when I kill it
Ain't no muthafucka that was giving you
Something thats realer, but never caught in a feeling, goddamn!

U.O.E.N.O. rmx,UnKnown,2015.0,"That nigga knowledge that dope, you don’t even know it, you don’t even know it
My mind gone and I’m all alone, you ain’t know it, you don’t even know it
In my isolation, I went insane, you don’t even know it, you don’t even know
Motherfucker I found god, I got insight and I show it, I show it

Nigga trying to tell ‘em of the prophecy, what do the monster be
A monstrosity, a little bit of the peace and I’ll be able to sleep
So I’ll be picking it up, then I’ll be quicker to leave
And I’ll be playing lead, until I wanna proceed
They found a way to perceive, as though they know me darling
Please hold your horses, I’m begging your pardon
Don’t ever assume that I told you my secrets
I keep them inside there’s no reason to speak ‘em
I think for myself and I know that I’m depressed
I regressed and now I need time and a deep breath
I pray and I hope but my faith has been fading
I can’t be complacent, I gotta keep working
My soul in this vessel of flesh has been hurting
I talk with Jehovah then ask for a purpose
Why do I feel worthless? It’s all that I've known
With the lack of attention I got in my home
Not to mention experiences I’m repressin'
And I wish that it wasn’t the way that it is
All I wanted was happiness back as a kid
But the longer I live I can see there’s no sympathy
Come here to sin and pray god has forgiven me
How to survive or exist in this misery
Agony sure to accompany me
I like to write all my philosophies
So then I organize them with apostrophes
I say the flow is real there’s no anomaly
And I’m a new Davinci with a masterpiece
I brought a Mona Lisa, that’s a bonus feature
With a bogus preacher and a larger posse
And a few surprises, give me kamikazes
I’ll be playing blind and swaying in the hammock
Like I drank it all and now I’m feeling nauseous
My words are slurred so proceed with caution
Libation in me, then in starts embalimin' my mind
Convulsing and now I’m evolving to a different person
I don’t even like him and my car is moving through your territory
I’m familiar with it, but I feel like a tourist
In the driver seat but everything look foreign
And I realize that it was never for me
I won’t change and I’m not conforming
One hit of acid with a few blunts
And my nigga Jake could give two fucks
With my windows down and these tools up
Masking emotions that I got inside of me
I’m no better than the rest of society
Please do not place me on top of a pedestal
Meet me in person you’ll say that I’m pitiful
Always complaining or take it for granted
I’m not satisfied and I don’t understand it
I barely managed to get out of bed
And I don’t have a plan that’s going to get me ahead
I cannot see the future I live in the past
I confess that I’m mentally sick, but you son of a bitch
Do you actually think that I care about numbers
Or if you are playing my shit
Man, I treat it like therapy, this is my session
The pen is dissecting my singular thoughts
That I took out the vault and I put on a page
Only ‘cause I want to give you honesty
I’m tired of these sickening motherfuckers
They’re preying upon the weak
And I beseech you with intelligence
I pray that you can feel it
I’m the realest and a villain that’s giving out his opinion
Only if someone is willing to accept the boy
Instead of giving out hate or reject the boy
I told ‘em give me a minute for some reflection boy
And you have tried your best, it don’t impress me boy
You’re like the rest of them that I see through
And that’s transparent, you should be embarrassed
Call up both your parents for some home training
There is no excuse for that sad existence
We are not the same, I can’t tell the difference
Nigga everybody on the internet
They’re giving out illusions and
You’re buying and flashing a miniscule moment of life
But you have no idea what the rest of it’s like
And you try to keep up and make sure you deliver
Now you gon’ be just like rest of them niggas
I break this shit down so follow my instructions
Ignore your reality that shit’s disgusting
Start living a life of heavy self destruction
You work at McDonalds but flash all the cash
That you got on your check that you owe to somebody
When you take the picture make sure that you’re smiling
That money right next to your face now you’re cheesing
That twenty on top of someone’s underneath it
Put a filter on it so people believe it
And don’t get me started on scandalous women
You don’t have a job but you want, you want men
So you’re taking that picture for your Instagram
And you’re checking your hair to make sure it’s on fleek
And you wonder why these niggas calling you bitches
And why they would treat you the way that they do
Like you’re lower than dirt, look at the length of your skirt
Never let someone else define your worth
You do not think you’re in need of companions
Baby girl there’s men all over the planet
Eventually somebody will understand you
Demand your respect and develop some standards
‘Cause darling your pussy is ruling the planet
But
 that's till it's ran through by niggas and bandits
That you let hit quick and then they start abandoning the ship
Oh, now you’re lonely as shit
‘Cause you don’t have love for yourself
And you search for your soul then I hope that it helps
But if you cannot grasp that it’s not about wealth
Then you just might be in this position forever
I stare in the mirror, can’t get it together
I’m losing my mind and I need to get sober
I don’t have the will and the way that I feel
It’s like fuck it, my nigga it’s already over
I, coulda took my time to make something for you that's average
The masterpiece I molded was motivated by madness
The depth of my disparity and clarity is varying
I should have justified it with the truth but I’m aloof
And I’ma do what the fuck that I feel is really necessary
And I want everything that I was ever denied
My shit is sounding malignant, you niggas looking benign
My style is getting ridiculous, way ahead of it’s time, lawd

My mind gone and I’m all alone, you ain’t know it, you don’t even know it

And I’m too dope and I swear to god that I told ‘em, I told ‘em, I told ‘em (2x)
And I’ve been the best, but I swear to god you niggas get defeated

Lawd, knowledge, nigga
Look, man these mothafuckas mad, I can really feel it
Never business always personal, that's why you in your feelings
Once a ceiling, nigga I surpassed that a year ago
Re-corded in a basement while you was with a basic bitch
Different states, but safe to say I'm moving on to greater shit
Sideline commentary, nigga sound like Heather B
Say you disagree, so suck my D like you Heather Hunter
1,2,3,4,5 grams in my front
A leaf rolled it up for me, no I don't need company
Smoking by myself, but comfortably, I'm feeling lovely
I'm Elroy Jetson high, this world is under me
My feet up with both eyes wide if they should come for me
A hundred forty five pound tyrant to a troglodyte
Keep my name up out your mouth, you'll bite off more than you can chew
These sneaky greedy heathens, let me bless you like you say ""Achoo"", I just went super saiyan, no Goku, hadouken with haikus
I swiftly move my IQ, large rappers singing like Elder Busche
Falsifying finances, facetiously, down play the losses
Off the bars alone I get more respect than your crews and bosses
Lucid dream, I'm living like an Allan Watts dissertation
Acid mixed with ayahuasca, now I see the Holy Father
Lights is getting dimmer, conversation darker watch me sparker
Park your ego to the side, this heat's a necessary crime
Pacino in the mirror, reenact it , no attachments to my life
That I can leave 30 seconds flat, imagine that
For the sake of time, this motion picture has been edited
Like, where'd you get your talents, Jehovah's where I credit it, but
I ain't talking Sean Carter, gold shield, strong armor, clean conscious, good karma, shine like the Beligian rapper
Praise the lord like Chance The Rapper, everyones a killer
How the fuck do y'all believe these rappers
Most of y'all are entertainers, shuck and jive, don't make a dime
These Sanbores are entertaining
Yes sir Masa, I'm sure is happy
Now tap dance to a mill and tell me how that feel
There ain't no hands inside my pockets, dividends devote directly, independence is intelligence, don't you ever forget it
You're favorite rapper is fucked, stressed, living in debt
Old quarter bought the niggas, I don't give them respect
A silver chain dipped in gold, with the god on their neck
I'm just a trail across suburban, now we used to live in D-ron
My pockets flat, no spare around
My anchors I still hold it down
My photo finish photosynthesize, I call maturation
Rappers feel they self too much, it's like they masturbating
I sterilize them, now they as stagnant as I
The young Popeye, call a doctor, would I proctor
Propose the proclamation, proceed to practice my teachings Ephesians, I feed them life, your alternative isn't nice
My advice is you fucking practice, I'm practically post-traumatic, impossibly passive impartial, my stance is my prowess, the vantage
My favorite point is to vanquish, no chance I could be defeated
Desktop presence ain’t the key to being icon
I shift alt delete, then shoot my shot like a nikon
The fuck out of my way hoe, I'm definitely manic
I smoke three in a row, the dopest way that I could manage
I'm not a practical thinker, I'll never ration my reason
If common sense ain't involved, then fuck it bro i don't need it
That's no common dependents, like wearing a nigga's pendent
And driving a car that's rented to profit off an image
These rappers using the internet to cover up their timidness
The end is imminent, living limitless, I just finished it

They call me knowledge
No apology
My flow is astronomical
I coordinate apostrophes
I’m sorry if you feel offended
Fuck a friendship I don’t need it
Force myself to work that’s all I want there nothing in-between it
Soliloquies for your cynical sorrows
Save up the energy that you would borrow
Please say a pray' for today and tomorrow
Hope that the future look better for you
I am looking at life from a beautiful view
Of the pitiful pew that I used to be leaning on, I was depending on people until I decided to switch and became independent
I said that I’m safe and the sound from these vultures
That violated and molested the culture then
Turn it commercial confusing to me , but I mean
That is usually simple to see
I subsided with silence of violence, impede
In succeeding in showing you ways of improvement
The illusions are unnecessary
I carry myself in the ultimate fashion
My passion surpasses it's point and I pop it
So please take a picture to get the composite and
These are the moments you want to remember , when it was for love and not about the cash flow
I can’t go a day without doubting myself so will someone send
Sympathy
 out to my mother and tell her I love her but I’ve been berated by management basically bartering, harboring, feelings for more discontent i’m am slicing the tension
Got to keep it going
Trying to give you something faster
I’m an ignorant bastard
But I’m looking for the way out
And I’ve been fucking struggling ever since I came out
I’m definitely different I need my medication ;
Never take it , now I’m paranoid I can’t avoid my destiny
And do it for the prominence, I’ll promise it
The politics eliminated the moments that I present my dominance

‘Bout to overdose im down and out
I fucking hate my self
I take this little pill and hope it helps i’m feeling overwhelmed
We don’t ever do it for the money we are steady working
Of for certain , the purpose will never be forgotten
I was scheming on a master plan
To make it materialize, and unable to realize
My lyrics has been divine, I tried to be less pessimistic, positivity forgiveness in ascendance, I surrender silence in my self esteem, it never helps
With my emotional temperament, I take the beat apart
You want the heart of the sentiment , my father wasn’t so abusive I wouldn’t be sensitive
The present premonition, my intuition
Intuitive an innovative introvert
I write until my fingers hurt and
Every time I stress something that I can not control
I can feel the positive energy leaving my soul
I gotta focus on the plan
Thats achieving the goal
I wanna give you something pure and
The fury that was confirming
Cause under your dedication, irregulative, your reservation
Please won’t you save it
I do not need them I know what I want
I am pacing myself while I’m setting the tone and
I pray that the devil will leave me alone
Cause he’s talking to me, he said make your shit different
Misogynistic and unrealistic
Start speaking of bottles and fucking these broads and
I know that you don’t but create the facade that’s fugacy and crazy
They’ll call you the illest
Don’t rap about real shit or issues you deal with
Cause nobody cares about suicide, nigga
Just  take all of your feelings, put them to the side
Then you start telling lies
Then your slice of the pie that we cut is gargantuan
When that’s in abundance there ain’t no assumption
Now don’t that look scrumptious?
So go 'head and grab it I see that you want it
It’s yours for the taking, now give you your vices
You give me your soul then let me take control
And I’ll put you in places that you’ve never been

Wonder where the fuck I've been
Said I am working
But I gotta go hard to the slaughter
You martyrs
I'm honest
I gotta keep it modest
And I'ma make a solitary promise
That I will soon abolish
The influx
Of concentrated maniacal diabolical ignorance
Integrated with the impotence that I've been seeing on the daily
Pursuing the passion by putting the pen to the paper
I punish with thousands of punches
I pummel with percussion
The prominence of my dominance
Product of my environment
My mind is sharper than a guillotine
And what I mean is that you probably couldn't handle it
By hyperventilating and then panicking
With a couple pack of policies
People left to decay
And it's safe to say I'm insane
Cause I can see the soul I threw away
I knew that I was special when they said I was nothing
It's whatever
I'ma get it on my own
I'm all alone
And I am focused on the task at hand
A mastermind to make the plan
With tools set to massacre
With fans and flows to understand

Apparently I suffocate the sound until it cease to breathe

Aggressively

The word play sicker than a pedophilic memory
For all of the niggas that played in the game
That wanted a change
But never attained

I bring you relayed
It's all for the love
When niggas are fake
It's preordained that I will be a statistic
The difference is I'm dominant
You could see my potential
Perpetuating my problems
I point'em out with the pencil
Depicting a sicker image
By putting life in the sentence
I told her we're false repentance
I'm blending with the sentence
Reflecting on circumstances
The canvas is getting dimmer
God damn, God damn
Where the fuck this nigga coming from
He's encompassing of the truth
Everybody wanna prove
To identify
See if it was identical
The attributes and accolades evade it with the principle
The simple seem to think that the only method to madness
Is making a mediocre reminiscule

I'm Shaq inside the post
I bet I block a bitch

You're nauseous counting your losses
I'm in a funny predicament
Politic in my purpose
I notice that negativity
Minimizes my worth
And I'm searching inside the verse of the source of the soft cynical said impairing the pardon
Regardless it was subliminal
Give a seminal reason
Bereavin'  leavin' you leaking
But never really believe it conceiving that we're even
I'm seething and you can hear it
Exuded off of my spirit these niggas capitalistic
I'm definitely realistic
Instead I'll be earning my respect, spit it like an automatic
I decapitate you head even extremities the way that I compose
Dispose all of my enemies they said the need the remedy but I can make it rest in peace
The recipe impeded seceded to save energy
Selectively to memorize the cadence of the poet
Exposing the un-explainable basically un-attainable
And I've been on a mission my penmanship is the para dime
Impressed that they invested in something unimpressive
Confessing my mind's a blessing and that's the essential present
Presented it to the public to possibly make it popular
And I don't  want a team cause people disappear in destitution
When you need em most they dissipate it the resolution
Walking down the road you never traveled what's the answer
I am living in a world full of followers gettin' herded like cattle
I'm a never ending pattern, another piece of the fractal
The fortress, the castle
Bet you never penetrate
See the way I regulate
I'm feelin' great and I
Cannot be hesitant to hail mary in a crucifix
To reach the precipice
What the fuck your message is!?
Do whatever you want
Long as you are in control of your life

I just keep working towards success
I've been obsessing about it lately
Feelin' like I got the weight of the world on my motherfuckin' shoulders, but I don't think imma make it
Breathe

I could never be complacent with the lies
Nor complicit with the evil and fear which you keep inside
People surprised at whether they despise lack of compassion
A pastor up on the stage
Surpassing what you've been asking
While laughing up in the moment
I live inside of the beat
The point I wanna get across is I'm not accepting defeat
At the feeling of being depleted
When all really I needed was a little bit of help
I never got it by myself
You mean to tell me that the only reason for living is wealth
As if the money purifies what we find within the soul
When I'm feeling outta control
I make a list of my goals—the ones I cannot attain
It's stuck inside of my brain
I think I'm going insane
I'm missing that serotonin
The formula for my happiness
A young black bastard spazzin' gaspin' for air
Does anyone really care?
They want you stuck in the system to steady ask for assistance
Your independence is distant
Dependent upon the dollars distributed by the government
Money is what we covet
They come and they contact but their consequence is what the context
The content has got you convinced that I'm refusing to make a song about the incidental nonsense
I gotta make it real, something that you could feel
The product that we deliver on the daily wasn't tarnished
It was simply irresistible

But sinister like a minister criticizing your sins
You pulling up in a Honda, he rolling out in a Benz
Collection plate like a record to get a couple of spins
They selling you salivation
You giving them all your wins
And rummaging through your pockets to find a penny or profit
The problem is you was promised a piece of mind and a providence that don't even exist
Religion is what you make it
Your common sense is forsaken
It usually means that you're producing hatred
Perpetuating the ignorance
Provided by an absence of the knowledge to acknowledge that the
Obvious is honestly right in front of your eyes
Try to see the bigger picture, while missing the major issue
To diminish the minor or miniscule
We're too dismissive and put ourselves in a problematic position
Foreseeing something, make a decision
Decisive with the precision
Not to mention all the persistence
You assisting on displaying within the sight of your vision
Contain a certain distaste for the life you currently livin'
We're only given a small amount of time to make a difference
So I focus on the facts, not the felonious opinions
Of the people that would profit from the pain that I've accrued
And then I write about it
Put it in a song  the views on down
Like I'm in a groove
A pitiful move
Pray that you never get it confused
And use every single word that I'm saying as the fuel
For the fire that's been burning deep inside of you
The desire to be better in any type of endeavor
So till the end of forever
My effort is the epitome
The passion I possess
Is pitter-patter on a pedestal till it passes the masses
A matter to splatter or shatter
Disaster wasn't imminent
In a minute I'm eminent
The truth is in my sentences
I give the realest sentiments
The sentimental subsequential line becoming evident
Gallivanting with relevance

Lord knows I just wanna say I made it
I could never deal with failure or the feeling of defeat
I just keep working towards success
I've been obsessing about it lately
Feelin' like I got the weight of the world on my motherfuckin' shoulders, but I don't think I'm a make it
Breathe

Man I'm steady shit
You been a bitch
Better hand on my business
A better of benefactors extracting all of the benefits
The beneficiary's revolutionary
And a visionary
Conversating with consiglieres
Asking is the lyricism prevalent or necessary
On the contrary, I'm levelin with malevolence
The message is methodical, philosophical follicle
Follow the false prophet who's probably got you convinced that's its confidence complements the continent but never contradicts the consequence? A heretic with fallacies upon the lips
Sick as shit, I spit it quick
To lift a bitch but never trip
My flow can block the biggest star with bars
Like a solar eclipse
But I gotta be different and stand out
Spit without apology abolishing the polished me
But honestly—ah—chronologically I mean
I'm trying to be the dopest rapper that you'll ever see in an eternity
I permanently permeate your brain within entirety
The irony of it is I'm accustomed to rejection and far too manic depressive
To care if I get accepted
I'm not afraid to confess it
Realizing all my faults are just a motherfucking blessing
And the pressure is mounting up to a point that you wouldn't even believe
I've been too stressed out feelin' like I can't breathe
Suicide on my mind without a time to reprieve
My God!

Lord knows I just wanna say I made it
I could never deal with failure or the feeling of defeat

A clock ticking, and every second is like a two minute warning
Tick, tick, tick (tick, tick, tick)
I didn't practice for this shit, I ain't prepared for it
Pressing forward, presence dormant
Flow off kilter but shit I'm still up on it
Right in the pocket where I need to be

Tons of potential, I ain't got a ring
A lot of losses, fiending for a win
The underdog complex, it's either me or them

But they would rather see me struggling and stressed, settling for less
Still in the basement doing shit for free, my nigga please
That false reality identity ain't made for me
Made some adjustments so that I could live more comfortably
Ain't fighting for no false beliefs when they would never fight for me
Jumped up off the fucking porch, a nigga had to spread his wings
Yeah I stuck the landing and I soared, but that was self belief
It's too late to turn back now, I'm on this one-way
The first seat in first class, taking off on the runway
But most of these niggas got it fucked up for real though
You couldn't have walked a mile in my shoes, that's just not possible
You niggas don't have the damn fortitude to beat the obstacles
I'm looking around like what should I do?
Just keep it moving
No sense in stopping or pausing, this mind state is appalling
Like Pistol Pete, I went all in
I'm just shaking defenders, I make 'em remember
My heart done turned as cold as December
In terms of roles, I played the king and man these niggas is Simba
Mustafa the stopper, Ibaka with the way that I block 'em
Don't bring that bullshit 'round me, no
I cancel that like Nino
Am I my brothers keeper? Yeah you goddamn right
The only problem is that just extends to me, myself and I
Nobody else, I got myself, that's numero uno
And you would feel the same nigga, if you knew what I knew
If you done seen what I seen
If you done been where I been
I'm in the conversation like apostrophes and hyphens
These niggas getting amped off of yes men and hype men
But can't get your career off the ground like white men

I just tell 'em be honest, eh, be up
I just tell 'em be honest, eh, be up
I think I'm beyond it, eh, be up
I said I'm beyond it, eh, be up
I tell 'em be honest, eh, be up
I said I'm beyond it, eh, be up",https://genius.com/Kaan-honest-lyrics

And I just wanna be successful or I wanna be happy
I've been working hard tryna make it all happen

You down to the ground nigga don't let that affect you
I said this shit before but I'ma do it my way
I swear to god I'm focused you know where to find me
If time is of the essence, I promise not to waste it
I'll take happiness or wealth, whichever one don't leave me
Vacant, vacant, ah

I, sit alone with my thoughts, let me reflect
And rummage through my mental checklist of regrets
It's okay, I'm just gon' wallow in my sorrows I guess
If you see me crying in public,  please walk on by
These are the tears of a clown I'm spillin'
This pain is the realest feeling
I feel for the life of me
I, just can't attain what I want
These wishful thinking prayers
I hope Jehovah hears, but honestly, they're falling on deaf ears
I'm revered as a rapid writer, releasing lines, I'm igniting the fire inside your soul
That's controlled by your insecurities
Can tell the personality trace, just to fit in with the fake
So that you blend in with the rest of the vague
It's a shame, there's beauty inside of yourself
But look you gotta find it
Within our darkest moments, we control our mental climates
Never fold under pressure, that's what makes diamonds
And even if you failed a million times, continue trying

And I just wanna be successful or I wanna be happy
I've been working hard tryna make it all happen
I believe in myself even when nobody else do
You down to the ground nigga don't let that affect you
I said this shit before but I'ma do it my way

If time is of the essence, I promise not to waste it
I'll take happiness or wealth, whichever one don't leave me
Vacant, vacant, ah

I would be remiss and negate the fact that I am a loner
My simple mind has been stressing over these things I conjure
And I'll admit that I'm selfish, ignoring other's problems
I never see the bigger picture, too reactionary
I take advantage of the fact my mother's there for me
I rarely say I love her, if I do, I say it sparingly
Embarrassed by my lack of compassion I wanted normalcy
I know I need to go and see a doctor for conformity
Of mind, body, spirit and soul, my god tell me why I'm cold
Murder opponents I will
No empathy that I feel
I found myself I was lost, but for my sake I just
Hope that it isn't too late, flashbacks of cold razor blades
How could I say that on record I still remember
My homie telling me that I was tripping
Said ""You need to be aware of what you speaking, man these people are listening, don't that shit affect your conscious?
How are you sleeping my nigga?""

And I just wanna be successful or I wanna be happy
I've been working hard tryna make it all happen
I believe in myself even when nobody else do
You down to the ground nigga don't let that affect you

And I feel
Think there's something wrong with my heart (Think there's something wrong with my heart)
Feel like it's been taken apart (Feel like it's been taken apart)
Left out with the junk in the street (and I don't know what happened to me)

GETTING HIGHER THAN A MOTHERFUCKER

Oh lord
6 in the morning, I'm still going, I don't wanna come down from my high

Floating, flying I'm just tryna get away from all the shit on my mind

Oh lord

Yeah, think I made a bad choice to turn  bad boys
Sick in the morning and I
Think there's something wrong with my heart (Yes lawd)
Huh, yeah
Tell me that you're not opposed to this
I'm honing in and zoning out I can't fuck with it
On
 another level, I'm thinking I might be
I ain't caught up in the madness no
All passive talk, that back and forth we ain't here for it
Therefore you've been forewarned my heart soft
Feel like it's been taken apart I can't move on
Waited for the moment to strike it's been too long
Second guessing I don't think that I'm prepared for it
I ain't worried about the feeling bout the care
Bear with this, bound to the craft
Niggas is giving food for the soul, fuel for the thoughts
Use it as a tool to provoke, evoke more emotions
Feeling left behind, lost and too stressed
Might be no hope, but we ain’t hopeless
Keep going till we got no hope left
Look, the past I'ma leave it there for we've been here before
But your obstacles and optical illusion they can't stop us
Due to the fact that we'll die for this
We'll live forever through the influence
And that's infinite

Skyfall,Abstract Art,2015.0,"Emotion I put in the song
I guarantee it will leave you amazed
Staring at every lyric I've written
A victim of pain and the mess that I have made
It's the clearest depiction of all my problems
A possible promise, and peace for the taking
My spirit is vacant, if I am forsaken for music I make
And I think that the purpose is really mistaken
I pray that one day I am forgiven for all of my sins
If there's a hell then I feel like I'm going for all of the ignorant shit that I did
Lawd

This is the end
Hold your breathe and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hearing my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue
I owe them
Swept away I'm stolen

Look
I
Could never tell them how the fuck I really feel
So I said it in the rhyme define that I'm ill
I'm a different type of nigga
The purpose of vendetta I've been better
A mother fucker that was giving his life with every line
These rights giving insight this might be the greatest nigga never heard
This man is absurd
He's giving you deep words
Put the poetry in motion
I'm way past devoted
You should go quote this
I am not folding
I will stay focused
I can't control this
I murder with the flow and the lyrics are consoling
I pray that I'm forgiven for sins when I'm going
Call the almighty
I need a savior
No more regrets
And I'm not debating or ever looking back
The fact that I'm facing
Every single fear that I have
I want greatness
Never complacent
I won't be defeated by my insecurities
Tried to conceive it
If words are deceiving I'm never believin’
Till the moment that I'm no longer breathing
I spend all my time writing songs about life
Because that's what I want and my mind is contrite
If I die and reincarnate to a mic
As I did what I love and I did that shit right

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart
If the sky falls
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the skyyyy
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At skyfall

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Where you go, I go
What you see, I see
I know I'll never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put my hand in your hand
And we'll stand
Let the skyfall

Lord knows I ain't ready for tomorrow
Never been a nigga that was really prepared
And I was honestly scared
Terrified of the dark side
Suicidal mind my demise
Never televised
When I realize
I got a reason to live
Like making a hit
Or fucking a bitch
And pushing the whip
Copping the chain
The diamonds insane
Make sure they can see a mother fucker doing his thing
Lord

Switch it up
Dumb it down
Don't nobody understand what the fuck that you even saying
When you get up on the track you spitting it at fast speeds
Indeed
Back, back
I need a second to think
I'm lost in my thoughts
My soul is diluted
I hope that you feeling the rhythm as I use it
To my advantage
No more excuses
Those things are useless
I'll execute
With the effort of a person
Dying to get a shot
No shock
Keep it down his last dime
Taking the time to re-define
This nigga is dedicated
He elevated is wrath
I still remember every time they laugh
And I reflect on the pain and put it up in the past
Now what type of shit is that
I could never relax
When I recall
That somebody told me I would never make it as an artist
I'll probably end up starving
I took that hate
Said ""Fuck it"" and kept marching
My life is in the margin
Giving it regardless
I got a story to tell, I haven't even begun
To sit and reflect
Or rewind on the memories that were repressed
And that's due to the fact that I'm living on the edge
Don't know how to get ahead
With a blade to my wrist waiting for this shit to end
Lord

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Let the sky fall
We will stand tall

The Shit,UnKnown,2018.0,"Yea, uh huh, lawd, knowledge, nigga, yea, look

And you can find me in a space where happiness is now a rarity
I pump Gorilla Zoe and force my foes to feel the energy
I'm rollin’ rollin' rollin' we ain’t slept in 'bout a couple weeks
I wonder where the hours go they dissipate I'm all alone

Fuck it I'ma get you a ridiculous passion
Let it trickle to the tenants intended to take time
My mind is amazin' I'm makin' it do tricks
True shit loose lips sink ships
I know it look
Homie I am dope and we just found a way to show it
Lookin' at the way that I’m workin’ I've been devoted
Focused on the dream nothin’ ever comin' between
Nigga everything is dope like a key from Medellín
And you could hop up on the train and take a ride
You ain't gotta tell me this is everything i like
If you listen close I bet I bring you back alive
Wonder what the facts are I tell the truth I never lie
If you feel the rhythm I'm done forcin’ you to side
Who the fuck am I to disagree I said I never do
I'm constantly damaging competition from moments of repetition
It's like you niggas don't get it it's simple this isn't physics

And I've been chillin' by myself and writin' rhymes for 9 days
I have lost track of the time and I ain't slept since Friday
I'm damn near too obsessive trying to do this my way
I been more focused than ever I'm just praying that it pays

Nigga we know we the shit
You ain't gotta tell us we the shit
We know we the shit and that's the truth
Nigga we know we the shit
You ain't gotta tell us we the shit
We know we the shit and that's the truth
Nigga we know we the shit

Searching,UnKnown,2015.0,"And I'm just searching for that love I never got when I was...
And I'm just searching for that love I never got when I was...

Why am I lost?
Giving into every single vice of my life even though I know the outcome, looking for the answer
I can never find it, what is on my mind?
All the insecurities that I am blessed with
Stressed that I'm never gonna make it
A man left vacant from all the pain he concealed
I said it with the validity, I felt as though I needed, defeated by everything I go through
I don't even know you, speaking with a figment of my imagination
Tryna find my soul, everything that I will say up on a record
Is similar to assembling a reason to live, I pray Christ forgives
And this life I'm in, devoid without a purpose
Diverted but not emerging, immersed in the agony
A life, I can never get it right to enlighten and I fight and finding the peace
My release is the music, and now I need a muse
Refuse to give you something you consider less than
Confused that you'd believe in the words of the next man
Amused that you would listen and tell me what I am
I don't even understand, cause I was never connected
I'm gone and complacent
The way that I've been living is off of the reservation
The stay of the state of steady evaluation
Evasive, I wish I wasn't isolated, so sedated, filled with hatred
Still retracing all the mistakes that I made
And never make 'em again, I thought that
I wanted friends, but people only appear when they see
That it's beneficial, dependent on emotions
That I am willing to give, I'm getting close
To insanity
Everything is cynical, sending em a better sign
The pain is never subliminal
Seriously invested, I'm resurrecting correcting a policy
A personal put the place, I deface the abrasive, you cannot erase this
The moment that you put in the ground, and I made it
The times ain't change, and it's always gonna be the same shit
Give a negative image that you are guaranteed to receive in an abundance of wealth
Attempts to cover insecurity
That you have currently felt
Materials never helped
They're only there to mask it, manifest, manipulate, relevate the energy
Praying never reciprocates
I'm working to eliminate the mindstate perpetuated by literal ignorance defended it by saying you playing it for the beat
And the lyrics they never matter you seeing as obsolete
And we seeking to see the center a hypothetical sinner with theoretical lineage to emphasize the innocence, a suicidal nigga, to be honest I don't give a shit
I'm really getting sick of it simmering every time to the world When I need to be alone to atone for sins and trespasses
Can I get a pastor
You ain't gotta say it I know I'm a fucking bastard
Prepare for the worst I feel like I'm ready for hell
I'm a different type of nigga that's very easy to tell
I think I'm in need of help
For pills to ingest for instance: my intent?
End it all, nigga
Been praying to God for the false repentance invented and said it was an anomaly impossible to proper the pain is part of the problem
Presented as a constant
I got a lot of secrets that's sitting upon my conscience
Call it what you want but it better be the truth
Never lie upon the nigga that was living in reclusion
Everything I do is amazing, it's no illusion
Whatever niggas given the vision has been alluded
Damn I cannot breathe
All of the evil I see is source for my apathy actually feeling like I'm insignificant
I am not different, never been better
A lack of intelligence, taking its toll, is embedded inside of me
Suffering silently see my demise is a way to be free
A depressing confession connected
The sentence malevolence given in my adolescence
Compressing the session until it's affecting the words that you have for the due convalescence
With question obsessing the day I expire
Attire from livid submitting my spirit affirmatively till I'm permanently in a place of seclusion
I cannot tell what is real as I fill up the page with the prophecy
Pardon the protestant lacking the sympathy making obvious deal with the consequence
I just pray my death is quick I'm a son of a bitch and I'm dying the way I was born
Told you I never depend I can't wait for the moment that I meet my savior to tell me this is the end
I just wish I was no longer here is the cause of the pain and the source of my fears
Lord

And I'm just searching for that, I never got when I was...
And I'm just searching for that, I never got when I was...

And I'm just searching for that love I never got when I was young
And I'm just searching for that love I never got when I was young
I'm at the end and I don't know if imma make it out alive
I'm at the end and I don't know if imma make it out alive
All these years of isolation drove this young nigga insane
All these years of isolation drove this young nigga insane
Said I don't think you'll ever understand my motherfucking pain
Said I don't think you'll ever understand my motherfucking pain
Said I don't think you'll ever understand my motherfucking pain

Yeah, alright let's do it

Ooh, and I just pray to God that we survive, that we survive
I asked the lord to give us wings so we could fly, so we could fly
And I just had a premonition that I died, I died
And now I can not go to sleep, I'm fucking terrified

Damn, god damn, damn. I pray that the lord forgive me for my sins, me for my sins, me for my sins
And I feel like I'm going to hell but I pray to my god that this isn't the end, damn

Ain't nobody that will ever get up on a beat competing with these poets
Competing with this notion, a murder with a villain, spilling my devotion
Is at a higher level so people have never seen it
They fiending to get the purpose diverted from any meaning
To find the root of happiness, hope it really exists
Insisted you sit and press play and sift
Through the words of a nigga that presented you a gift
When I hit em with the real it make the people feel It never
Made em feel that you should reconsider
Get em with the venom
I'm finding it kind of funny
Exaggerations of money
Have saturated the sound with a cynical sayonara
Disintegrated your energy
Emphasizing with empathy
Empathetic erratic, oh
Orchestrated this symphony
Formulated a plan with the lyrics I've written
Suicidal psychopath someone save me, don't forgive me
Lord! Do you even hear me when a motherfucker talkin
I'm takin all of my pain and make it the center piece
And I'm open to promiscuity that you promised to never pass
Thinkin all the pain that I'm feeling will probably really last
Living in the past with my negative type of mind state
They bouta manifest it Confess I dealt with depression
I was suicidal as an adolescence
I was steady stressin
Lookin for the reason why anybody should live with all my fucking isolation
I know you see what it did
I'm paranoid, I'm talkin to myself, a nigga wanted out
But I was sitting in the corner
Feeling like a loner
Contemplating what what the fuck a nigga finna do
I got a blade and a bottle of pills to keep it real
I be taking every one till a nigga feel ill
I don't wanna be insane
But there was no one to blame
Slit wrists
Blood drips
It dissipated my pain
Fuck!
Kill em with the flow, I said I'm minding my business
So what the fuck are niggas spending the impeccable feeling
Repetitive the plan is develop a sentence
They hearin, it wasn't becoming dependent
I'm picking up a pack a pencil
I could paint a batch of pictures depicting my whole story
And given my whole life find a nigga in the gutter
Succumb into his advice
Called Christ mother fucker
The relic of sacrifice
And I wanna be the greatest
So that you cannot debate it
Never talked to mother fuckers or suckers that could not take it
Berrating What I'm doing, proving hatred eliminated them all
Considering me the god
Disintegrating my opponents, I'm leaving people appalled
Yeah, heh heh, yeah
Disintegrate my opponents, I'm leaving people appalled
Disintegrate my opponents, I'm leaving people appalled

My nigga I pray to the lord that we make it
Salvation is me being faded, sedated
I'm soaking and sin and my secrets forsaken
But lately my nigga, I don't give a fuck
Marijuana induces my paranoia
Fuck it, I'm freeing my mind like a mason
When facing a J
I'm adjacent to Jason
Masking my pain, and erasing the aching
Investing into all of my business
The labels just want a percentage
The concept of branding an image
Wait niggas just really don't get
KAAN
Brandon, image
They my mother fucking niggas
And I'm getting premonitions
Scribbling all my writtens
The difference between sleeping and having a fucking vision
Is I plotted for the profit
The plot properly thickens
Lucid dreaming, reality
A percentage maintains society
Religion, pussy, power, puppet politicians
Praying that a nigga fucking flip a key
Make examples out of niggas tryin me
Money, pussy not defining me
They compare you to your own companions
Now them same niggas be your new rivalries
Lord, why these niggas wanna plot on me
They throwin shade, takin shots at me
So I'm ridin round with that pocket rocket
Pull up, James Harden when I pop a three, nigga
You either gettin paid or you gettin played
And if you ain't with it than you in the way
So nigga, fuck what a fuck nigga gotta say now

Damn, god damn, damn. I pray that the lord forgive me for my sins, me for my sins, me for my sins

When I take time to make it simple
Till its tenfold and eventful
But the man go with a dope stroll
Like a van Gogh but no vanguard
And a vagabond the imagine. nochalant
Not national(?) with the orchestras(?)
I orchestrated, not penetrated
And I resonated, and you can't debate (it)
But I'm feeling great, I'm in a good space
I got a cold song in my system blasting
And my window down, and my mind flowing
And that Marvin Gaye til' I'm comatose
I might overdose on that stylin'(?) soul
With that simple love that you rather hear
I gotta persevere, I wanna persecute

A cooler composer close the curtain
Cursing curving the beat up
Personal peak upon some piece
I plead the people believe
In need of the voice of Etta James
So I can drown out the pain, lord
 x2
I need to rest but I got stress on my mind
No longer sleeping
I've been thinking of these pivotal rhymes
I play some music all alone
The tone is passing the time
And I hear these stories and the lyrics
The energy is sublime, Lord

I want a magical, mystifying soliloquy
Send me something that's real
If I feel the seal of approval
Boost the truth I'm loose and living
Listening to Frankie Beverly
Amazed the maze(?) I made the flavor
Forsaken this shake(?) is Satan
Won't cave in I came and I claim
That I was exceptional
Paid attention astutely
By soothing(?) smooth as masseuses
I'm ruthless maybe relentless
Lament the lesson they lecture
They lace the lyrics they living
And listen this is by children
That feel alone for an instance(?)
I did I remember playing
So Makavelli melodically
Bother me and the people around me
Don't seem to care at all
I'm in this by myself
With no one to help or assist
I'm convinced to testing these lives
With the music I'm feeling fine
Now in my mind I reminiscence
I miss the bliss that I had
I remember ripping on the plastic
From 2pacalypse now
You couldn't tell me nothing different
Now i'm not putting it down
I finally found the love of my life
And this message is over beats
I beseech the speech and
I sing a song like Sinatra
I'm Johnny Cash
With these stripes on my soldier
The trains are coming
I'm running, huffing
But never stop because I'm dedicated sacrificing
I'm feeling so elated

I need to rest but I got stress on my mind
No longer sleeping
I've been thinking of these pivotal rhymes
I play some music all alone
The tone is passing the time
And I hear these stories and the lyrics
The energy is sublime | Lord **first time only**

I want that music that was real so I could feel it for sure
I realized that they don't even make that shit anymore

And I'm just trying to bring it back
To that rap with classic galore
We put some soul inside the sound
So they could feel the allure

Look I'm pushing it to the limit
Peter pan to my pen
I picture the perfect procreation
Appropriation of phrases
I phase the fake with the fuckin
A phase I 
Play a pun to punish them all
With that interlude 'bout the gun
You know:
Packing the mac in the back of the ave' 
Give them the rub on the lyrical track
I pity the moment 'm bringing them back
I'm lining the mind in a minute a minute
I own it, never tone it, I am alone
In love with the music, I'm putting it first
I've literally been immersed

I need to rest but I got stress on my mind
No longer sleeping
I've been thinking of these pivotal rhymes
I play some music all alone
The tone is passing the time
And I hear these stories and the lyrics
The energy is sublime Lord

4for1,UnKnown,2015.0,"​
As a child I dealt with abuse, I'm fusing pain with the mic
Felt like the world was on my shoulders, took attempts on my life
I understand that isn't healthy
Like, how the fuck could it help me?
Reflecting as an adult and realising I was selfish, but
You couldn't tell me no different
Try all you want I'm not listening
We had no shelter or place we could turn
This shit is routine and the lesson I learned
Is keep your mouth shut, the more quiet you are
No yelling or screaming inside of the house
Cause that wasn't ever allowed
See, I wasn't raised to believe I could possibly be anything that I wanted
There is no support for the kid with the home that is hectic
We were dissented
Tell me the way I should go
Everything I should already know
All the emotions I'm willing to show
My adolescence, progression, and growth were stunted
So I'm feeling mentally stuck
I live on the edge and I don't give a fuck
A handful of pills, that was never enough
The way that I cope with this is living this up
But if I recall we had been through it all
You niggas are speaking no problems of poverty
As if you actually seen it
But bitch, when we lived in that trailer we never had nothing but roaches around and we couldn't complain
My parents would bicker, it's always the same
My mother was picking us up after school
We'd be in the back of that old station waggon
96.3 on the radio blastin'
Smokey Robinson would have us relaxin'
Quiet Storm before we step in the madness
All of the peace that we had is now past us
Walk in the door but there's yelling and screaming
There wasn't a place where I ever felt safe
And I couldn't relate to the kids that I saw
Cause I felt that they all had it better than me
Cause they don't have to deal with the shit that I deal with
I stay in the middle of arguments
Shitting myself and believing this shit is my fault
Every time they would fight it was grief
Closing my eyes and my ears in my room
When I opened them up, man, that shit never ceased
And I want to be free but there's nowhere to leave
I wondered why people keep fucking with me
Cause when I was in school they would tell me I'm slow
Cause I never attend anything I was told
So they put it on me like that shit was my fault
Cause there couldn't be something that was in the way or the place that I stay
Cause I never got help
My mother got tired from busting her ass
Like, dropping us off and then going to work and then picking us up and then bringing us home
To a man that appreciates nothing at all
While he burning a cigarette, staining the wall
Monday through Saturday crushing us all
But gets up on Sunday to go praise the lord
But there's no time to time in those moments to spare
I figured it out, that life isn't fair
So do what you can
Cause nobody cares
It's all about loving the memories that you have made in your happiness while you are here
I pray that you live without fear
And you never think you're in need of materials just to complete you
Cause that ain't the truth
Don't be dependent on things that can dissipate or disappear when you need them the most
Lawd! Ey, knowledge, nigga

Look here
I've been the man for a while
My definitive plan
And I'm attentive to my terror lyrics of part too quick
Style constipated, I could never give two shits
Coming through your speaker like you need to go ""Who this?""
Now you need a nigga that's only giving you elegance
I gotta kill 'em, regulator, moving with malevolence
I try to paint a positive picture while feeling negative
A sedative, I soothe 'em, assuming that I'm a sinner
While sending you serendipity, I live in misery
I'm playing Mister Misdemeanour, changing my demeanour
Feigning for the fountain of youth
I wanted wisdom and truth
I know these other mother fuckers try to give an excuse
But my style is too loose, prefer to be reclusive
I give a simple sentence, serenade ya with acoustics
I been showing the way but nobody is tryna follow me
Believin' what I'm doing, I'll never make an apology
I built the foundation for a fuckin' mauseoleum
With a citadel and mural like the Roman Colosseum
Infiltrated by an infidel, I'll see ya when I see ya
Sippin' White Zinfandel
I'm a connoisseur and conqueror
A commodore with the cadence
Occasionally I kill it
I'm giving you food for thought, it's enough for a starving village
My image you won't acknowledge
The mileage up on my brain
Time for an all-chain
Now pay attention, I switch it
Efficiently give a vision
The mission is motivated
I make it a point, I plan it
I done managed to manoeuvre
The music is too melodic
Don't play it for any novice
I'm modest? My nigga, never
I focus on getting better
Embarrassing anybody
You niggas plotting for profit
And politicking with others, evasive is what we are
I'm working but never seen
It's all a part of the plan
There's a method to the madness
You'll never understand
I can spit it any way that I want
But you thought I want the flow they never really noticed
When you giving up your time
And in your mind you're thinking ""Man, I'm just a Diamond in the Ruff""
I know it's hard, you're feeling down
But when you get above the ground
I guarantee that you'll survive with nobody up on your side
Whenever you do decide you finally feel alive
We in love with the truth, we never telling a lie
I promise to give you honesty for the rest of my life

Man, I swear to god I would never give you nothing that was average
A young black savage
Fast rap bastard
Either way, you see me as the master
Owned a plantation, delicious destruction
My shit is salacious
Distribute discussions, attributing to how I think I can function
These guys on the internet think they did something
Oh no
Time for me to put them in their place, quick
Lyrically impeccable, punctually embracive
Face to face, your fade, it fades, refrains to fame is fake as fuck mistakes that I make
I gotta work with that selective amnesia
Focus on the test and follow all of the procedures
Maybe I'll take a break cause I'm tired I want a breather
I know these evil mother fuckers would like to deceive us
Jesus are you there, do you hear a nigga talking?
I been calling you for years but I feel you just ignoring
Like telling your secretary, ""Jot it down, he's not important
Take his name and his number and tell him I'm busy
I'll call him when I can
If I ever get the chance
If he's giving you attitude then just fuck him in advance
I ain't blowin' him up
Cause I know that nigga needed me for forgiveness of his sins
He need a pen and wanna run but he dependant on the pain
Cause that's all that he's got man, I know that's the truth
Subjecting myself to silent solitude
With no silence inside of me, soon to subdue
I'm submitting myself when I plummet
I pray they put poems inside of my casket
My posthumous spirit is piercing my peers
Don't adhere to the fear
Or the feel I appear at the peak of a pyramid
Pissing on pitiful peons for penance
There's plenty pretty petty pressing matters that I know that I need to address
My sobrieties
First I get I high in excess
That don't equal success
It just means I feel less than alive
I'm surprised that I made it as far as I have when I'm lacking a moral compass
Ain't ashamed of my past
Still remember when them niggas told me I was trash
I wanted to spit a couple of bars, but I'm aware that they would laugh
Now I never think about them cause all I did was surpass them, lawd!

I said I'm tryna make a way
I need the world to make a masterpiece
The devil's on my ass
That dastardly deviant chasin' me
Replacing my emotions
I'm motioning towards the negative
My nepotism navigates
I'll never reach the narrative
Your negligence is never necessary
It's nefarious
The window's getting smaller
Looking down a narrow barrel
Bullets flying like an arrow
Allocated by your hatred
Hindering the possibility to possibly make it
Aye please, when you rise, tell me what the fuck you really see
I pray that you can recognize and find spirituality
Hoo!
Don't you know fatalities and fallacies are definitely on the way?
It's babies killing babies basically
Cause don't nobody think I know they have secret agendas
To generalize a people of color
Formally cover but covet cash and account for a drinking
A diamond link
And give them all the tools they need to make sure that they become extinct
I try to tell all of my niggas
We are an endangered species
But am I the only one that sees or actually believes to see this
Sick and in my seat I seem to see the seed they planted
Plants are thrown out of the window of a moving vehicle
I mean I veer and steer
A benefit that fear is fabricated
Face it
Base it in my lease of predjudice and poorer confidence
Ignoring the injustice of a judicial system
That puts a race of people away at a rate that's faster than rabbits
Attack it from the inside, destroy a black family
Contra' did a lot of hurt that we have not recovered from the 80's
They put drugs and guns inside of our communities
At least the inner cities to make sure there isn't unity
Confusing that you think this isn't a genocide
We statistics mother fucker but we in need of some rest
And I supply the sentiment if there's actually any left
Cause it's either incarceration or seeing an early death
In the depths of my soul like the test of control like a test
I've been tested, they lessen the blow
On the spot they align and combine as a full
While exposing a posing impressionate person you'd personally
With their personal preference
No pardon for passes presented for people to place an opinion
Of pitiful, pungunt, disgusting provisions
I need to prepare as I peek with a pair
That's my pain and my passion, you cannot compare
Is it clear that I'm here?
Cause I hear that they heeding my messages
Heated with heathens, they heavin'
A heater to heat up the block
And then chop when they eat up the people
They call up the cops
But they can't stop the evil
There's forces at work that will not embrace change
It's insane how they think all black people the same
Lawd!

Eh! 4for1. That's it. T-that's it. Next week we gon' give you 5for1 then the week after that we gonna give you an entire mixtape that's just one fuckin' track. That's it
(Good work dude.)
I appreciate that, I appreciate you recognising all the work. It is a lot of work. It is a lot of work. Fuck! That's it, 4for1",https://genius.com/Kaan-4for1-lyrics

Columbine,Losing My Religion,2014.0,"Aaauh aaauh aaauh
This the story of Ronald
The loneliest kid you'll ever meet
You'll probably never meet him cause you've never seen him the streets
Ronald stays in the house, been pretty depressed since his dad passed
And left him in the darkness of his room with insecurities
But would often consume a fifth of poisonous fumes
Proceeding with an epiphany to beat his mother senselessly
Ronald stuck in the middle
The struggle to pull him off of his mother receive pain and dropped it off at the altar
She finally realized that she was stuck in the cycle
An optimist weighing options of taking her own life
Or dealing with all the problems
She wanted to raise Ronald realizing that domestic violence probably changed Ronald
It's monday afternoon 3pm to be exact
Was exiting the bus where he was bullied by his peers
Entering the house and walking right into his fears
Seeing blood drip from the top to the bottom stair
With a glare he sees his mother and releases a screech
He saw her vein split in half with a blade by her feet
Couldn't believe the scene that his eyes were forced to receive
Drops to his knees ""God please let this all be a dream""
But it wasn't and paramedics start arriving to the residence
His father already riffing 'bout the cost of the funeral
And now he's in the living room belligerent as usual
Ronald's a punching bag for his dad who's leaving bruises
The victim and victimizer, relationship is abusive
Ronald's only 13 with a deprivation of dreams
His father's an alcoholic who's more concerned with his liquor
Than he is his own seed ""Go get me a beer nigga""
His father was complicated he didn't believe in limits
A man of little conviction who's struggling with addiction
And now become well conditioned from drinking with repetition
On a downwards spiral he loads a clip of his rifle
Saying a prayer like he's searching for forgiveness
It's a futile attempt the lord refuses to forgive him
For that lifetime of sinning now you praying for repentance
All that alcohol dependency was physically depended
Then he says the hail mary kiss the crucifixion pendants
Puts the barrel to his chin like this is the end friends
Now Ronald's left all alone in a system of foster homes
Full of pedophilic predators, molested on the regular
Teachers don't understand why he hardly ever speaks
And his grades are getting worse as he academically plummets
Developed a speech impediment of pain he's impervious
It's from his foster mother who's sneaking under his covers
Ronald doesn't understand cause he has yet to reach puberty
Confused by perverted love he receives on the regular
He tries to fight the feeling but she always get the best of him
This bitch has taken his soul and now there ain't nothing left of him
Solitude in his room as he sits in the darkest corner
He's medicated his pain with strains of marijuana
Refuse to talk to a pastor, he don't believe in religion
He says ""if God resides then my mother would still be living""
Instead she left me in hell, the agony of this prison
No one understood that was his defensive mechanism
Not knowing that he wanted to push the pain that he was given
The direction of a person that's living without a purpose
He made it up in his mind that these motherfuckers deserve it
In a world where this child was abused and left deserted
He started studying killers such as John Wayne Gacy
And those kids from Columbine he saw 'em as masterminds
Perfected the blueprint and with the rifle Ronald's accurate
The same barrel his father used is now his muse
He loads the clip then cocks it as he throws it in the duffel
Smelling death, teen spirit and a whole lot of trouble
He's bumping Marilyn Manson, you could probably feel the treble
Ronald never talks to God conversations with the devil
Like ""please give me the strength to kill all of these motherfuckers ""
As he's walking into school with a fucking mac 11
He's done with the disrespect so he's aiming it at ya neck
Popping plenty of rounds and laying his peers down
As the blood starts to puddle, the children begin to huddle
Running and dodging the bullets, Ronald's finger on the trigger
If he sees you then he pulls it, his classmates are his target
Gun is hotter than august from automatic magazines he's releasing This a massacre
Genocide of his generation and generally speaking he's giving generous portions of bullets that come and they seek and they singe
Cleansing him of his sins, I'm guessing this is the end
Cause Ronald saved the very last shot for himself
So he places the barrel inside the center of his chest
Close his eyes take a breath and the rest you can attest to
Story of pain and agony written by yours truly
This a treacherous allegory
I hope you never confuse it, don't lose it",https://genius.com/Kaan-columbine-lyrics
NCS,Abstract Art,2015.0,"Stuck and I'm looking for the exit
I'm working everyday but I feel like it never pays off
I'm pacing and battling, struggling with my happiness
I take the situation and my mental instability
Using a few soliloqouies our lyrical agility
Adjacent to the fact the pictures I paint are honest to the best of my abilities
With the effort that I'm giving, necessary to remember every sentence that was written
I don't keep up with the status boy, but I cannot be apropose cuz I propose a proposition
Appropriate politician, long as these motherfuckers can always tell the truth
I'm at war with my sanity like the Hathaways and Montagues

Main reason why niggas buy materials, but will never succeed
In believing that if we emulate an image or a lifestyle we see it upon the daily
Perpetuating a certain type of mindstate, I said that I'm
Never to speak of the cash, a nigga will laugh
I told him I live in the past, I'm givin a vision to grasp
I break it in half

I got a ridiculous task, a different class
A nigga was lovin to teach, I'm one of the realest with speech
And give me attention whenever I speak , preach
Shit, now back to the topic of discussion
Disgusting, these motherfuckers are steady selling they souls for gold and promiscuity
Diamond encrusted jewelry
To justify your ignorance, and pray that you're forgiven
You will save a pretty penny, not to pass it out to many
But put it up in accounts, the amounts
Because the envy is petty, and I despise it
But you surprised that I realized
That its all about the positivity and love that we surmise

The real reason whyt niggas never had shit, spend it before we get it
But never saving a dime, intertwined with the hatred, we fending for ourselves
The morals that I was given reflected off of a TV
But never been takin' my time, 
one of the realest to fold
A nigga been knowin'
, givin' the people the show
The illest of foes, the fake composer
Better to murder my foes, and when I compose
Leavin a nigga to freeze, for takin my steez
And wage with the belief, that's what I wanna believe
God, damn, now can a nigga, think for a second?
Before I become a victim of this subliminal message
Consuming every product you place in front of my retinas
Directing me to a merchant to purchase whatever sold
It's a cold world that we're living in, lack of money is limited
A future for my peers and I feel that the end is imminent
Find yourself in positions of poverty and fragility
It's not about the 
world
 but the fiscal responsibility

Ampersand,UnKnown,2014.0,"Overdosing and comatosing, I'm barely breathing
What's a dream differed if you the one that don't believe it
I present a different thesis projected through my secretion
My competition is seething, but knowledge is what I'm seeking
IIII kill it right off of the bat and I'm bringing the heat
A nigga would never compete
The people are waiting to see
The realest of rappers that get on the beat
With the way that I murder the flow and I show when I go at incredible speeds
I'm something that you never seen, my lyrics are mean
I'm turning 'em all into fiends, and giving a villainous scheme
They hearing the scream, I said that I'm reigning supreme
The fuck did you mean?
A nigga is living the dream, I'm broker than ever
It's not getting better they give it a maximum effort
Dependent upon the endeavor, 
they faker than fuck
And I said that I'm feeling the vibe
A lyrical Jekyll and Hyde is really alive
I craft a masterful sentence like a scientific formula
Form of the fornication I formulated defacing
Then pacing, taking my time but I'm tryna develop patience
Preposterous that your ponderance possibly wasn't vacant
Mistaking my dedication for degradation with decadence
Destitute and aloof I'm eluding ever-evasively
My focus and concentration taken with inconsideration
Here's the situation, I could be a future constellation
Minus consternation, this sentence is just because I made it
Confiscated from the complications of my confirmation
Guess my conversations are compilations of records
Was lacking some type of content, they wanted the realest of concepts
The way that I spit it I said it at convents, enough of your nonsense
I'm coming up quick with this shit and I'm giving it quick, the music is filling they clips
I think I'm accustomed to hate, 'cause people are fake and that's why I can never relate
The time that that took to create
The passion I have is the reason I feel that I'm great
Was given at birth, determine a personal worth, they said that the flow wouldn't work
Instead I'mma leave 'em immersed, I'm putting my pain up inside of a verse
I'm dotting my I's and I'm crossing my T's
I'm one of the best that nobody has seen
They came in to know me fatigued, the moment they leave, I said that I'm taking the lead
But why are you looking confused, the beat is abused
Now wait you amused, the fuck was the literal muse
I'm giving a beautiful view, you came in the game with a crew
I do what I do and I'm doing it better than you, but I thought that you already knew
I murder the beat and I said that I rip in it right, it's everything that you like
I masterminded a massacre, manifested majestically
Mutilated your majesty, marginally imagining
Fathoming you could ever step to me but never recklessly
Or disrespectfully accept to dissipate discrepancies
I speak insistently as I simplify for the listener
Sympathize with the sinister, magnify it for menaces
Maximizing the minuscule, minimal effort given
By rappers making a living, for instance I been insisting
This game's in need of assistance, persistence has been the difference
The time I put into my sentences so you remember this relentlessness
Offended with pads, pencils, and pendulums
Popping pills of prescriptions, proprietors of addiction
A crucifix oughta fix 'em, that's automatic forgiveness
An artificial confession that's purifying your senses
What I spit is A-I-D-S, are you impressed?
My flow's an immune deficiency as I officially
But more specifically proficiently, even known as prolifically
But I'm envisioning that
They loving the way that I'm making it drop
I come for the tip of the top who wanted the nigga to stop
They give a ridiculous plot, he's stirring a line
And whether I like it or not they fuck with the way that I rock
I'm taking my time when I murder the feeling
The realest of niggas to be in the building
The illest of villains, defending a phony is fame
They giving a sickening claim and play an erroneous game
As I'm resurrecting my name
My lyrics they bang, I'm leaving a nigga to hang
I'm knowing you take it in vain, but let me explain
I'll tell you the reason I came, it wasn't for taking the blame
I said that I'm working your brain, they feeling ashamed
As I was remaining the same, I told 'em I would never change
I feel like I'm going insane
The point that I'm wanting to make is that niggas are fake
And I finally found where they made a mistake
When they focus on everything but the rhyme
And not really taking they time, the way I design my intricate difficult lines
I bet that I'm blowing your mind, but what do I find
These niggas don't listen to mine, they telling me I'll never shine
I wanted to make it sublime, they told me that that was a crime
Arrested if I actually try, convincing myself that I'm fine
Condemning the way that I rhyme, I guess I'm ignoring the sign
But there was no one that could find these niggas that giving you lies
But nothing I'm seeing is real, I'm telling you what I despise
My nigga, I go to the fullest extent and I'm getting revenge with a pen
And I'm telling you stories and sins, that I'm living my life with no friends
Sellin' lifestyles over half of these companies, of course it's for a couple fees
Nothin' I hear but logic can actually fuckin' comfort me
Audacity to think that I could make it in this industry without a label backin' me
Doing it independently but my dependency
Upon the music is confusing, conflicted by what I'm viewing
And what the public is choosing, they're puppeteers of careers
And these strings are made of veneer so I'm making it crystal clear
That my future is what I fear 'cause I know I'm destined for loneliness
Hopelessly, I devoted my time in a pipe dream
And it seems that my aspirations were actually asinine
With the hours that I have wasted, should have listened to the niggas that said I would never make it, they taking my lack of confidence and try to call it modesty
Never display my talent
I'm tryna die nigga, honestly, ironically
I'll probably never have to do it by myself, my local government will help
And they're not interested in my mental health 'cause nowadays
It's legal to murder a nigga for wearing a hoodie and eating some Skittles
They heads' in the sky but a nigga went out with a bullet that came from an ignorant cop
And I'm wondering when this'll stop, killing my generation with they shots
That isn't a shock, disgusted by what I am watching
Wondering if I see this from a cop that they'll capitalize on the shock in the streets
The land of the free and the home of the brave, at least for the people that's paid
The pain and the poverty causing disdain, it's simple and plain
It's in a residual change, and everything is the same
I'm telling the truth, so why the fuck does no one listen
Killers who wearing a patch that was given to them by the sickening system
Ha, yeah
And right now I ain't nothing, I'm not even in demand
But one day I'll be in your conversation like an ampersand
You understand, I ain't nothing, I'm not even in demand
But one day I'll be in your conversation like an ampersand
You understand, I ain't nothing, I'm not even in demand
But one day I'll be in your conversation like an ampersand
You understand, uh-uh

Get it while you can

It won't even take a minute
Just keep workin' through the pain

Tell 'em I done seen it all

Check the temperature of us
Feel like a soldier in the field
I said I'm goin' for the kill
Your shit is weak my shit is ill
Its over-drive and over-time it's all I'm pull up climbing
And I could give a fuck if you agree with what I'm doin' alright
Your vision only 20/20 if we talkin' hindsight
I was playin' Mathematics, you know Black On Both Sides
Elevated to a level where I'm feelin' past high
Tried to tell 'em that there's really no comparison to

I'll never be like you

You're losing big 'cause you choose to
I think you got it all confused

There's a reason why we at where we at
Survival of the fittest, Knowledge will acknowledge it
It's natural selection, some of us will fade and fall
Then disappear into obscurity amongst it all
The other half, well they ascend to somethin' greater, I
Can see the vision in my mind but can't articulate it
As frustrating as it seems this reality is
The farthest thing from real it's funny that we call it that shit
Cause if you think about it really we just die to exist
The fear of missing out inside like no one notices us
We take for granted what we have and then obsess about the things that we don't
Complain about the smallest problems and a list of our wants
Cause the things that we buy
They cover up how we feel
You insecure about some money, man that can't be healthy
Lost in the deep screamin' someone help me
But they won't cause the world is selfish

A pair of wings to fly (Yes lord)
Into the blue of
The wide open sky (Knowledge nigga)
Show me your scars
I'll show you mine
Perched out of the city
On a pair of power lines
Take a deep breath and don't over think it
Take a deep breath and stay positive

Take a deep breath and don't over think it
Tread light I won't make a wave, I wanna stay away from them bright lights
And on the track that's to refined life, long as the rhyme tight, that's all I care about, but I was never concerned with your deceitful lies
My eyes on the prize, all three of them
I gotta keep them open like it's CBS
I'm serving legal dope to people CVS
Oh I've been up for days, I'm trying to push the product, sipping cups of coffee, caffeinated rhymes
Ain't no

 in it, I got soldiers with me
Me, myself, and I, no we will not comply
I heard the world's a stage and we the many players
Only fate can save us what do you believe?

Young Brunelleschi, I'm an architect
A true trendsetter, lyrical vendetta
Let me adjust the content into a proper form , cause I could reproduce a three dimensional object in two dimensions
I invent perspective
Create the world that I reside in, within the sanctity of my asylum
The outside noise is brought to a whisper, I can't hear it so it don't affect me

Love (Her rmx),Abstract Art,2015.0,"And you can tell I really want it
But its hard to believe when the people never seen this
Young motherfuckin' genius
Bitch I put the pen to the pad and I bet a nigga write mean shit
And I was tryin' to make them realise I was all alone in my isolation
I was terrified my self-confidence will cease to exist as I reminisce
I ain't got no time for no relationship
That's what I tell myself as I proceed to write a couple of records about the way I’ve been livin'
And lord willing I can make it to the precipice, the top of it
Impressing with depressing shit
And now I got to see my therapist
Embarrassing that I depend on compliments, the only way to boost my confidence
SHIT! Goddamn!
Can a young nigga breathe?
I've been livin' a lie similar to what you see
Every time a nigga get up on the microphone I wanna talk about the real shit
Maybe you can feel this
Heart up on my sleeve is the way I'm gonna wear it
They garner a different type of attention
No need to mention
I wanna keep a minor attention of every single fact I put inside of a track
I attract a large crowd
I wanted the crown now
One dope motherfucker to tell you to calm down
What I found is that people embrace it if it’s real
Press play and pray it relates to the feelin' you describe in your lyrics
They hear it they gotta have it
In love with the sound but they couldn't even manage
Or really understand the pain of this bastard
Or painted a picture of the emotion he’s maskin’
FUCK!

But I guess that it all takes time
Blow minds with the rhymes that a young nigga spit
And givin' you dope shit
Make a motherfucker listen
I come with a notation
Your animosity was a prophecy in the pavement
And you could leave in a casket with every person that you came with
I feel like a nigga was steady soundin' redundant
We live in world that is morbidly repugnant
Am I the only motherfucker that can really see this??
See to believe
And in my talent I give 100%
I've been lookin' for the sanitary reason
Either I'm gonna give it everything that I got until there isn't a drop of passion inside of my body divided by daemons
I'm dedicated to the awkward thoughts feel that flow clean pristine like a fresh water stream
What the fuck you really mean, huh?!

All I wanted was a piece of your love
And all I wanted was a piece of your love
And all I wanted was a piece of your love and maybe a little bit of your compassion (passion)
All I wanted was a piece of your love

Losing My Religion,UnKnown,2014.0,"I've been standing in this corner for a week
Losing my religion I feel like I'm talking in my sleep
I been starring in the mothafuckin' mirror trying to find a reflection of the exception that any kind of conception
Confessing I got the essence illuminating fluorescent finessing forever stressing the problems in my possession
Potentially I can be one of the greatest poets living
My lack of confidence it compliments the formal art
I compose at the Symposium, make control at the podium
Passive aggressive opinions never make a difference
So why they try and admit my flow isn't art?
The fact I be writing in the paper because it glistens
Convincing people to listen, for instance my intuition
It saddens me though, I walk into a room with inhibitions
In addition to a Triton confirming any suspicion that my vision was conflicted by a minor contradiction
And my mission was affected by giving you this message
They tell me I'm impeccable, rapping like a professional
Words using to deceive, I need a moment to breathe
I got voices in my head, they're never refusing to leave
They're all speaking at once, my brain is so overpopulated
Pick the pen up put it to the paper discombobulated
Failure is not a accident, it's actually an action
It's the act to have an opportunity and passing with the lack of passion
You're relaxing to imagine what you fabricated
Fascinated while you take a break on the sideline
Salivating, aggravated, dedicated, talking like you in the position to really regulate
Records never resonated, this track is a revelation amazing and legible and that's the picture of my written resignation

And you don't have to say a word, I know I need serious help
But I've been so depressed and lately I can't even help myself
All I think about is death, I said there's pain in my seclusion
No confusion, I'm suicidal I've come to that conclusion. LORD!

All I really needed was a little bit of time
And I've been talking to myself I don't think I'm going to be fine
And I've been trying to find what it really means to have a purpose
Whenever I feel deserving and the pain that I receive that you're observing
With your wise, your mind, body and soul
And comes under the ignorance that keeps you in control
And you're the type to sign your life away for all the things your life is just to fulfill your appetite
Despite the new rappers delight
In spite of all the warning signals I been ignoring the signs of my signature
It isn't glory it lyrically I'm synonymous, an artist over a columnist
No respect for a novice, they only notice the novelists
Prophetic with my ledger like my pen was Nostradamus'
I can't make any promises
The future pedestrian I'm a 
Section for your indigestion causing your indiscretion
Suggesting that my progression develops with an obsession
The topics that I'm addressing, accessing need procession
Proceeding with an inception I been in search of except
I'm surgical with a verb, a vernacular is my procedure
Extracting a sentence seizure with thousands of anesthesia
I'm jousting you with the truth while I'm drowning you with some honesty
I doubt you're not gonna believe I'm actually a beginner
With aspirations of being a Pulitzer prize winner
Don't look so surprised nigga, you plot my demise nigga

And you don't have to say a word, I know I need serious help
But I've been so depressed and lately I can't even help myself
All I think about is death, I said there's pain in my seclusion
No confusion, I'm suicidal I've come to that conclusion. LORD!

Please don't ever confuse it because I'm going to do it like a rapper never did it
When I finish the beat will be in a critical condition
Medical attention to the point that it never survives
I'm barely alive and never revived
With a berry with a very crucial crucifix I'm losing my religion in the moment
And I'm praying for a Torah and it says that I can meddle with the past
And wash away all my pain, I'm finally free at last or alas?",https://genius.com/Kaan-losing-my-religion-lyrics
Still,UnKnown,2016.0,"Swear to god I got a skill to kill oh lawd
You can check the fucking record we have built it ourselves
Me and all of my companions built the foundation
A bit of ingenuity and a lot of dedication
It all a dependent on the original flare
I feel the energy collapse when I move along
As I correct the composition for the sake of your soul
My vernacular consuming
Nigga letting it go
I've been the cynical pessimist
So I try to stay positive in the personal interest
I deliver the sentence with the sentimental value from the past
My brain play a Keith Murray
The most beautifullest thing in the world is the interesting flow I got
Had the shot and I took it never standing around
I'm looking for a serious opportunity to pursue
I pick a position to play my cadence is so vicious
East 1999 born thug shit I spit it double time
So evident you can fuck with me
That was relative to the rhetoric that I render
Reluctantly I release it with new faith revealed
Reverse the verse to refine me define the meaning of real
Got me feeling like a goddamn king oh lawd
But my aspirations aren't materialistic I'm a simple man
Very minimalistic
Couldn't tell from the flow cause it was sick and sadistic
Man these rappers about as sweet as the Kiwi Mistic
Heard them niggas got the keys boy please just miss me
Said I used to be submissive but now nobody missed the bullshit
Its bad for your health high fructose corn syrup
Hypertension hyperventilating when I hear
Heard the sheep to a cliff you can jump in a group
That's a suicide pact when they missing me to
Like nigga the joint gold but my shit dope to
Hit them with the stale face
I disappear from reality I really wanna live in my zone
Wrote another monologue
Add it to my catalog
Let a nigga catapult and calculate my fucking effort making sure it's calibrated I could make it but I know I tell the world I've been devoted so I got to keep my focus so I pray the perseverance on display pays off God damn

Nigga fallin' I've been slipping on the daily
 (On the daily)
On my mind got a nigga going crazy (Going crazy)
'Fore I close my eyes and go to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
I hope Jahova hear me
Hoe I hold it down you best believe I

I still roll around smoking weed
Like I used to
I still ride around bumping Spitter
Like I used to
I still work alone Solitude
Like I used to
But this some brand new shit
Something they ain't used to

I can package you a pair
Coming out the complications
The preparation is a process please pardon
I put the parenthesis is a pivotal spot
I purposely propose a proposition to all of my people
Got a perfect alliteration I wrote it in my steeple
Second coming of the Father
Resurrection like the sequel
They decipher every noun but never understand the meaning Mr. Avant Garde
I'm a sheriff bastiat and not abiding to the rules or regulations resonating with the regular patrons
That is stuck in the matrix when I run out of patience
I proceed to barate you see to brigate
The gaze engage against the grain protect the culture
Not precocious rage like Zacharias De La Rocha writes a hook
Like Oscar De La Hoya pain inside his mind confined no one Goddamn

Nigga fallin' I've been slipping on the daily
 (On the daily)
I'm a mona got a nigga going crazy (Going crazy)
'Fore I close my eyes and go to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
I hope Jahova hears me
Hoe I hold it down you best believe I

(Lord)
Lately I been medicating all my pain
I took a hand full of some pills And I will never be the same
Feeling a estranged from this reality
I want piff in the after life
I wrote a metaphor in seclusion like I'm a troglodyte it at you
Working for the finer things to find a peace of mind
I focus on the bigger picture like getting better in time
I redefine configurations, my vivid imagination
Debated irregulations, I'm definitely dedicated
Collusion with indicated
Delusionally infatuated with the fabrication of image and my opinion is
My pain is desicated by putting painess
Apart of me Inside the composition
For compilations of poetry
Exposing and disposing whatever people composing
Proponents of ignorance that they spreading
I will oppose it
Supposed to be something better but at the moment I'm nothing
Disgusted by my lack of knowledge, the consequence of procrastination
And if you wanna go and get it by yourself
Motherfucker I can tell ya that's the truth
I been livin at the bottom in the bottle
Tryna deal with all my problems
Suicidal thinkin nigga what's the use
I don't have a single soul up in my life
That's ever tryna conversate
So i can speak and say the way really feel
But instead I put a filter on the pain
And I let it leak on to the page
The last thoughts that's on my mind
Is ""How do I get paid, Lord!""
Blowin yo mind and
Murderin a line and
Takin my time (Agh)
A reason to find
The flow is sublime
But giving you every thing
You ever wanted, you felt that you really needed
I see my future is dark I'm imparted that's all my sanity
I sit in isolation, I'm eye open no emotion
I'm hoping I'm being positive
I need my destitution before the day that I'm posthumous and put inside the casket
And buried a couple of feet to when at the eulogy they tell you that everything wasn't  sweet
I'm terrified that Ill die as man that was mentally weak

I always wondered 'bout
Why you let me go
Why you let me walk
Up on out that door
We just went out for drinks
Then you took me home
Walked me to my porch
Where you turned me on
That night you told me that you heard it in the background
Not just any music
Talking Mr. Soul Child
Said you was scared to come f*** with me
Cause you see I'm chasing dreams
But that mean that I don't need no love

So tonight you should go and take a chance with her
She could be everything you wanted
Everything you wanted boy
Don't let that get away
Don't let that slip away
Don't let that love escape
Don't let that get, don't let that get away, don't let that
Don't let that slip away
Don't let that love escape
Don't let that get away
Don't let that slip away
Don't let that love escape

I do not think that I’ll be fine
If all of this was just a waste of time
And I’m still alive
I’ll look back and say I spent my hours wise
Developed a plan
Made up some goals
Chasing the dream
Story I told was the tale of tenacity
Telling you truths that I learned from depression
An honest confession
That life is ‘bout more than the check that you get
From dollars like concessions
Hold up
Stop it, flip it, rip it
Nigga repetition is the only way that you can do it like me
I told you I'mma do it like nobody ever did it
Maybe even like the legends that the people never seen
I study Machiavelli
I understand it’s a process
My progress doper than methamphetamine

 try to understand the thoughts in a young nigga mind
The man I've become an what do I define
By default i've been livin' in a steep decline
And the trailer park we up in deep run
We had low funds, a real small budget
There was 5 of us in that one space
With animosity that you can't face
My father wake up in the morning like
What the fuck are we finna do
My older brother pissed off
And he don't wanna go to school
He was mad at my father for everything that he put him through
We lookin' at the world with a different kind of point of view
To tell the truth my father wasn't nothing but a fiend
By the time I came around
A nigga had got clean
Lost so much time tryna focus on the pipe
Now you wanna be a father to your kids, alright
And my older brothers ]
No time for looking back
Rather get it by himself yelling mutherfuck dad
Heading for the front door that was an obvious fact
And the pain that my older brother was feeling was real
But there ain't no way to cope when you couldn't even deal
And he was feeling abandoned, stranded understand that
He roll a couple blunts only way that he could manage
The man gotta live with the damage that was already caused
And there's nothing you can say nigga any fucking way with a damn staright face you are part of the reason why that mutherfucker gotta stay

Developing my destain so i kill it with the pain
My Brain is fucked up from everything that i heard
The walls were so thin i listen to every word
Absurd that i was made to believe that i was something
When my father wasn't running that nigga was steady bugging And yelling on the top of his lungs about something that was Miniscule within the bigger picture if you ask me
Discussing 'bout the situation i was living in
I been depending on a person that ain't never really gave a fuck
I focused on all the wrong things
Man, that nigga didn't wanna spend no mutherfuckin' time
And you must have lost your mind tryne tell me I was makin' up a story
Or forming a new opinion that really isn't that different
From the one you have when growing up is kinda tough
And when a fella wanna love I knew you wouldn't give a fuck
Is that enough I've had it up to here with all of your illusions
You really think it's that confusing
Cuz at this point it's ammusing
I try to break it down in a way you'll understand
I'm now in the process of becoming a man
What i learned from my father was never really taught
Mouth closed eyes wide to observe and to watch but within
That time i saw what not to be
And I know i can never leave with Hypocrisies
I prefer to write a record 'bout everything that I seen
And an accurate depiction of the way i really live
I put the pen on the page my story'll leave you amazed
I've been feeling kinda crazy the pain don't faze me

My pace been a constant addiction
I reflect on my life no revision
Let me work with a proper precision
My style like a head-on collision
Nigga think, don't make bad decisions
When a symbol is a basic condition
I insist that I show more attrition
Never bow down, not for submission
See the mission as a perfect incision
Got a vision for the peace no division
Let a nigga reach the peak of a sentence
And I
Don't let fallacies lie in my lyrics
Nigga never that
But I lead by example
Trample tracks attract a million fans
I like to wonder often
My sights on a cozy comfy coffin
I seek for the sanctity of silence
My god, my mind and such is itching
I came with a smorgasbord
And gave up my patience
Phase and dissipates
Quick to regulate
Disassociate from associates
Inappropriate code of conduct
Keep the falsehood
The fuck around us
Bottom of the motherfucking map
You found us
Locked up like ""what year is it?""

We still rising it's evident
If you don't believe me
You can check the numbers
I like to move while you niggas slumber
We work in silence I work to wonder
Why waste my time when I can value that
With these valiant raps
To uptrend your conscience
Can't kill with kindness that's too weak
I'm like MalcomX before the pilgrimage

I'll probably change it
With my simple ways and my evil tongue

With no damn budget
Stuck in the basement like rhapsody
Shit, every man for his fucking self
There is no need for a reply
Tell me whenever y'all decide
To unify not divide
I need cohesion
Less speaking
Your opinion, please keep it
Who in the fuck are you judging
Please do not give me critiques
I give a fuck about what you are saying
I know that my shit is unique
Me and my niggas are doing this shit
In a way that no one's ever seen
It's simple
It's U.N.I.T.Y.

Uh huh

Lawd
Yeah
Alright
Hmm

The mastermind is back
My flow I'm never forcing it
I'm putting you niggas to sleep when I get on the beat like I'm Dr. Kevorkian
Extortionist
They better proceed with caution
I was just countin' my losses
Giving a vision I really comprised
I'm making it real in front of your eyes
Develop a plan then we strategize
You want my demise and I bet you decide
To antagonize and try to divide
I'm keeping them niggas away from my side
I'm saying what you really gotta do when you intrigue
With the way a motherfucker do it properly
There ain't no way a pussy mothafucker stopping me
I said the flow is similar to an anomaly
What I got to be is one dope MC
That's necessary and legendary
Wonder why a nigga livin' with an attitude
But that's hereditary
Your opinion varies
And the people base it off of a few facades
Was a euphemism, but no you forgot
No, we should be ashamed
And ask for repentance
If you play that back, then I could  a sentence
And I fucking meant it, I am so demented
I would cut my wrist until the pain was ending
I was problematic when I needed help
And I pray to god to find a sense of self
And I
Know I never found it, became more grounded
Livin' in a puddle of tears and I was drowning
I put it on a page, amazed, and I'm astounded
To find what it means to really be well rounded

Yea
Sledge made the mothafucking beat
Aha
That's it
Ight let's do it
Yea

I keep it honest in my rhymes
That's all that I can do
As I provide the truth
But what's the use
It's hopeless for the youth
We live in a world where nobody cares
And I realize that nobody is there
Unable to hear
I'm making it clear
I'm working to overcome all of my fears
Surpassing the mothafuckin bastard boy
You wanna rap with the pastor giving you his passion
I preach to the masses
You would've never match it
But everything a nigga ever did was a classic
A drastic change that I can make as I fashion
Myself in a position where the people can't pass it
With all of the pain this mothafucker is masking
I still wanna die, what the fuck you really asking?
I've been tried prayer but the shit don't work
Read Psalms 15 but I still feel hurt
God Damn young man, what is your self-worth?
Shit I probably couldn't find it even if I looked
I take a deep breath, accept my regrets
Regroup and expect to be a reject
My pain to deflect
A moment to reflect
Gotta put it on a page
Prepare the concept
And I
Wanna make sure the music is real
Providing a product that people can feel
It's all independent I don't have a deal
But I have been dependent on vices that kill
I pray that the lord has forgiven it all
I'm doing the most, proposing a toast
I'm drinking it all

Uh huh
Look
Yeah

I swear to God that I went insane
I can't find my mind or my sanity
And I was baptized but never sanctified
I need Holy Water for my crucifixion
I’m sophisticated with a few convictions
You enamored with the way a nigga spit it
Style is enigmatic, do you motherfuckers feel it?
Flow is automatic, who said I wasn't the realest?
I'ma Seventh-day Adventist with this shit that I invented
The venomous villain is given and killin’ defining the feeling
I'm finding it funny
For fame and the money, frauds have been fornicated
I formulated the ends
And never gonna give it away
I've been embracin' every solitary sin
Ain't never heard of lyricism that ain't never depend
On monetary arrangements
Document it with pens
Got a whole lot of issues, I don't know where to begin
I'ma pick a pencil, pop it, point it at the pages
Paint a perfect picture, Promise that my pain is evasive within this stuff
And when a nigga really want it up was level the laceration
The scar of anticipation that came from procrastination
But I was never debatin’ I give a sickening fact
I put inside of a track
And lap a nigga, the trap
The motion I couldn’t match
You could bask in every one of my lines
No fabrication and concepts
I gotta make it real, my life inside of the content
The only way I'm dealing with the stress
But the sign is effervescent, I make a lastin’ impression, depressin'
They pressing play and these niggas are saying nothin, disgustin'
These motherfuckers are steady perpetuated the ignorance
And their competence causing mental sedation

Diluted any illusion confusing my generation

I was bowling
So you have no frame of reference here Donnie, you're like a child who wanders in to the middle of a movie—Walter, what's the point man?
There's no reason, here's my point dude. There's no fucking reason why these two...Walter, what is the point?
Look, we all know who is at fault here, what the fuck are you talking about?
Hey, this shit is much lighter than it normally is, it's not dark, I promise. Something different though, let's do it

Said the problem, well they'll never understand it
The way them motherfuckers should do it, I manage
Massacre the beat but you couldn't recognize it
They really ain't surprised with what the fuck are you finding
I can be the sickest and realest up on the planet
Illicit demands and a plan to proceed with
You ain't gotta lie nigga you ain't never seen this
Style pristine, sixteens of the clean shit
Why do you feel like the flow was the focal point when I'm just focused on words
I'm deserving a standing ovation for my eloquation and constantly killing the cruelest of cadences
Collected collegiate, connected the image
And I'm resurrecting my elegant vision
A topic that I couldn't put in a sentence
Assembling something to see is a sign that I set a remind, an irrelevant line of vesicular kind in a matter of time
I shall ascend to a level of peace and I'm playing my part till the day I'm deceased
I'm a natural beast, a vernacular feast
If you're getting your fill with the knowledge I swear that's a weapon, concealed
And I keep it inside of me, I remain silent, a part of society, never defining the purpose of life
What I write is contrite of a spiritual time
Till a dumb motherfucker trying to mess with that, no stepping back, we don't retract and never react
I try to relax and that's fact my nigga
When you do it like me the means is not minute
My truth, that's what I'm intending to give
And you're selling the feeling
I'm finally killing it, defining your image
And now you wanna tell me I'm the realest? Yes
Right before I fornicate with the chorus according to orders I bet that I sorted this sound of a cynical man is important
I managed to make a reality given the truth that you wanted
A fallacy
I would not ever comply with the fantasy
My lyrics come from a state of insanity
I am a sinner but I have been quick to admit it
I pray that one day I'm forgiven, damn

We're talking about unchecked aggression here dude
What the fuck is he talking about? My rug
Forget it Donnie, you're out of your element
Walter... The Chinaman....

Look, I'm back on the track for the sake of the song
Or the soul of a nigga that was really trying to listen
I give and you take
In due time to make a bond that won't break, it's real and not fake
Mistakes, eliminated
And you filled with hatred
That's less creative please do not take it
Within the wrong turns, I've learned to be patient
The pain is evasive
Then why do I feel it
A killer with this answer
Never taking advantage
I swear that I'ma give it the better and not less
A young black professor
You cannot F with
I bet you respect that my style is eclectic
I'm underground and I've found the perspective
They say it's profound and I have been accepted
So we separated, sooner apart
And I'm giving you everything in my heart
So I'm not an irrelevant nigga
To start you're embarking on a journey inside of my mind
I know what you'll find
You will go insane if you're thinking like me
I'm looking at death as a way to be free
I'm hoping to see some peace and a place to reside
I'll never confide in a person that purpose has given to see
I can see it for sure
And I will not buy into all the allure
I know that it is nice
They giving it out to entice
Advice, it'll ruin your life
Within that moment you say it's a vice
Riiight?

The real or the fake
Accepting my fate
Attempting to give you the grace
They love or they hate
Created the sound
I gotta give you something that's authentic
Or rid the repentance of pain
I'm lacking of personal gain
To build up my character
Carry your weight on my shoulders
I show 'em a sign of my strength
I never pray for a lighter load
And I don't complain about incidentals
I just stay focused I know what I want
So I work to achieve what I see in my dreams
What if I never sleep til the moment I feel satisfied
Man I'm stressin' bout what I cannot control
I been thinkin' bout time in a sense that it never has been on my side
How can I enjoy the ride if I'm always uncomfortable
Never complacent but beggin' for peace
I'll forever be dope and I'm reigning supreme

Talk about life like it's already over, Lord
Yeah, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Have you ever been terrified of your darkest fears becoming verified
By your destitution, no resolution

My darkest secret, my closest friend
Is my lonely pen, so let the pain begin
Now, we could put it on a page for people to read
A make a couple dope lines, you better believe it
Never taking it easy, I was trying to appease every solitary soul
That would listen to me, but I
Realized that it's all fake, not real
I figured out people take but they never give, and don't nobody give a fuck about the truth
Or what it means to you, you're barely making it through
You was living with a dollar and a dream, plus a minuscule scheme
Everything ain't what it seems
When I looked in the mirror but couldn't recognize the person I'd become
A nigga I despise, but otherwise I'm obliged to describe my demise
Surprised a motherfucker didn't make it, he couldn't take it
No resignation, his dedication was steady fading
But what he facing was so amazing, what you did to phase him
A difficult dilemma dependent upon a mental aspect
Flow abstract, niggas can't match that, detached to make a fat batch
Of the dopeness, a nigga wasn't this real then everybody would notice
We live in a world completely ass backwards, at least for the thanks and no please
Rankest police yank and murder a young nigga then leave him out on the pavement
Debating the basis of all of your hatred
I told myself that I would work and never start complaining
Can't be complacent, don't seek the fame
As I reach the brain let's beseech the cadence
I kept aside so I could try to survive
And lately I've been getting high for the pain I confide, Lord

I wanna make a change but it's never that easy
Really hard when you're trying to develop an image and give the people
The realest they ever heard
Talking poetry in motion, I'm speaking a spoken word, absurd, we differ within the pain and really live in a lie but the sign that I presented was a ridiculous vibe
A ride inside of my mind really defines it all, but if you really took a look I know you’d be appalled
Now take a step back, no need to relapse, but last week I was fine, I recently relapsed, I’ve rehashed the issues a nigga never dealt with, I wanna survive, it’s like I’m barely alive. I’m lost inside of a typhoon, I’m feeling helpless, I’m so selfish, I’ve been relentless, defenseless, my independence is not dependent upon the pendent, don’t really style, stupid niggas are trending, the records I’m making are colder, December, desegregated, disintegrate, people are never gracious, emaciating, interpretation, my flow is a guillotine, I decapitate it, iregulate it, regurgitation of anything that I was creating, this procrastinator will stay sedated to mask my emotions filling up on a daily, and I couldn’t give a fuck if a record label paid me, I wanna make a connection to people that is real, give them food for their soul, something that you can feel
Imagine the passion of packing a promise but what you are lacking is focus, please don’t ever think about distractions and pay attention when a nigga rapping, it’s all about the self-preservation, your effort to practice when its time for the lights camera action, lord",https://genius.com/Kaan-tell-me-lyrics

Wonder what I'm finna be
Wonder what the future holds
Wonder if the path I'm on is even aligned
Just give it some time
See patience refines
Don't rush it, it's Russian Roulette
Really realize where you're at
Really read the signs on the map
Really take a breath and relax
Really pace yourself 'cuz it helps
Lost on a quest for wealth
When you're unable to find peace

I'll seek and search the end of the world for some more perspective

Approach the paper then attempt to articulate what I'm on

Was once told that if it ain't broke then don't fix it
I'm holdin' on by a lot of hope and a big vision
I'm holdin' on, barely, terrified they don't get it
I can't be misunderstood, maybe I ain't that good
Maybe I ain't do the shit the way I was supposed to do it
Maybe I ain't give my all
Maybe I'm just lyin' to myself and everybody else

With its slight projection , my honest statement is;

Proper hypotheses, promise prompting me to the precipice
Plead for peace in my messages, press my pen on the page
They amazed, engaged, and the sages I save and slate
It's salacious, I sanctify with the sound like this
Holy water I found I just, pray Jehova can hear me
I panic over discretions, it sets a stress that's affecting this lecture
Sure to alleviate, abbreviate my grievances, grief I feel's Intermediate, leave that shit at the alter

I remember my adolescence, when we were left with a tyrant
That took the time to degrade and berate us, feeling deflated
I favor my isolation, was super safe in seclusion

Very socially awkward, with the field that I was set to fill
With the pen I ascend to tell you
What's in my position, purpose, condemned
I'm using my mind as a tool, but if that's been used and abused
I'm feeling confused, as I view my life as a detriment
Dire to feel affection, I have to ask for approval
I have to be heavily sedated, elated by agony, mutilating a track
I need medication for apathy

Step on the mic and I said that I'm running a circle around
The flow is astounding, a positive valence
Guess that I really been running for hours
Giving the people a lyrical ballad
That wasn't easily when I  devoured
Never a coward, niggas are moving a {?}
Keeping it higher, deal with the lows, I see them a lot
With nowhere to go, emotions I've shown
Considering calling it off because of the pain that I feel on the regular
Very consistent, my attitude bitter
My temperament testing, the word is the way I will lead

Blowing minds with wisdom
Spit sporadic my syndrome
I'm on pace with the metronome

No mezzanine that I call my home
All alone lost a lotta flows

Allocate my intentions

Languages led to secrecy
You decipher my frequency
Frequently feeling incomplete
Incidentally interesting, listen
I'm dropping hidden gems
And hymns to sing
I pray for release
Amazing, my grace could be but basically
I bask in the past, reliving memories and
Scenarios of pain that I had
I paint a picture, be attentive as I deliver
The funkiness tentative, irrelevant
The fact you fuck with the boy
His intelligence is off the charts
I choke and strangle the beat
Believe I'm a doper contender
Flows I contest with, it's best to put down
Your bets as I bless the track with my presence
Present perfection I paraphrase my life in a verse
Asserting a flavor, save and savor salivate for the sound
I solidify with every rhyme, relay relatable tales, I'm sure
To succeed and supersede, I see the scenic route
It's comfortable. I disappear and sacrifice for more
Than 'bout a month or two
Undermining the pressure I'm under, I'm wondering when are you giving a break? A literal taste. A piece of the mind that I feel like I'm missing, you know I got more, the minimal score, the average shit I abhor, I better allure
Giving the realness of legacies better be mentally apt I'm focused and never distracted. Forgetting the past, ahh, can I relax? I, breathe in like 'Woosah'
Do it a few times, spitting the sickest of melodies, measure a man by his actions, I assess and attack, I'm calculated pathologically, plead for pastors to pray for me, patiently wait for pardons apart from problems, I promise and I practice proper penmanship, emphasis on your excellence, exiting esoterically, enter super  sarcastically. Drastically change your outlook, savagely slay the preconceived. The notion I notify its a note of notoriety. Vast amount of perspectives, I vindicate with variety, I subject you to energy only felt by enlightened minds.

Maybe it's devious

I know that I'm leaving with all of his cash
A chain in the wallet

I'm doing it out of necessity
Not necessarily

Has made it impossible for my mother
To show me any love
She's coming and going
Whenever she pleases
Even though I really need her
Now I'm conceded
No one really gives a fuck

Committed a sin but I never atoned
I practiced that policy until I was grown

I got no income of my own
But I am refusing to starve
And I'm getting tired
Of saying that I'm sick and tired
Of dealing with all of these lies
So what's in my eyes
The vision of me coming up
This nigga did not realize
That he is the person
That I will be working and lurking
For certain to go victimize
Following him for an hour or two
I'm telling you now what the fuck I'mma do
I'm looking around
So I can check all of my surroundings
Make sure there isn't a witness
Fuck this forgiveness
Why am I feeling vindictive
I gotta deal with my issues
I should get rid of the pistol
Shouldn't be in this position
Fuck it I'm already here
I made up my mind
The thought is defined
I see him picking up his pace
And his movement is getting eratic
And I will not have it
But if I shoot a shot
And miss in the shadows
Of those that's in front of him
I guess that that will cause havoc
Ecstatic the perfect distraction
Pick up the pistol and blast, I laugh
Now I can see through all the madness
People are running and screaming
And my tunnel vision is centering
Upon the victim
I promise I'll get him
I'm running as fast as I can
I bet I'mma handle my business
When he hit the corner
He thought he was safe
I wish you could've seen
The look upon his face
And I have no regrets
About what I'mma do
Before I begin don't get it confused
Let's start with the shoes
And every time that you move
I feel like you're making me nervous
What is my purpose
Giving insignificant service
Taking everything you earned
But haven't you learned
Your safety is not a concern
I wanted the money inside of your pocket
Your wallet the keys to your crib
You finna take me wherever you live
He said I got kids
So I started thinking of ransom
Wouldn't that money be handsome
They would just give it to me
So the nigga could leave
And breath
And not be deceased
The second we move I see the police
I already took everything on his person
He was a waste
So I had to get rid of the nigga
But now I think about the cops
And they told me to stop
So I turn around let off a shot
And I'm running a couple of blocks
And I found me an alley
Where I can survive
I'm in a position where I gotta hide
And give it some time
With everything on my mind
I wanted to find me an exit
Looking and checking
I really think that I'm cornered
I can hear sirens
All that I wanted was silence
I can invision the violence
Shutting my eyelids
What am I finding
Nothing but all of the pain I was given
I'm dealing with misery
Nobody listens
I was a victim
My circumstances
Counting my losses
Taking some chances
Never given an advantage
I was just living without any plan
And you understand that
I will take nothing for granted
Finally come to the end
I feel like they found me
And if they did
I told myself that I will never die sober
I am a soldier
Sparking the blunt that I had in my pocket
So that I can think
Open my eyes
Cocking the nine
Stand up and shoot every cop that I see
Riddled by bullets
By every trigger they pull
And I feel like I'm finally free
Lawd
Yeah
Uh-huh

On a track not lax I should get paid
Nigga, shit my brain sharper than a switchblade
Because I don't flow, I just cascade
And every other motherfucker that you listen to
Don't stay true, that's a motherfucking masquerade
But who am I to judge cause they're in it for the money
I'm a hundred miles and running I'm automatically gunning down
Anyone that wanted this real
I'm never fronting, novocaine for your brain
My rhymes are mind numbing nigga
Writing that shit that you can't supersede
I give a fuck about what you believe
And I could care less about how I'm perceived

But am I ready for it, nigga I will never really know
Until I step up on the stage and then I let my lyrics flow
From a place of desperation, a balance of segregation
I'm leaving you salivating from lyrical elevation
And I hope the game ready 'cause this ain't a simulation
Assimilated the facts of rap that's on board
And stimulating the minds of my demographics abhorred
That your flow is so forced it's not consensual coitous
You niggas can't avoid this
You couldn't break change to make cents, four quarters
So when you step be cautious
Cause my mind lawless, and at this point in time I'm accustomed the losses
Chi-Town '84, he ballin'
Foot up on the gas but the car keeps stalling
Got fame from the game whose main dame is flawed
And while scuffin' up the hardwood floors till the mornin'

I check the contents of your context
That shit's nonsense, that's full of discontent
But I'ma bout to vent to get it off my chest
Just like a bench press
And if you feel impressed
Then you should write a check so that you can invest
I need advancement money plus interest

I said I burn it up just like incense
And if it's all about a dollar
That's a motherfucking problem

They got they eyes wide

It was confiscated by the constellations

I got flows that I got to kill and people that I got to see and shit I got to do

Put the pen to the page though
Like a canvas so I can let the pain flow
5:30 in the mother fucking morning
Nigga waking up to go and get his younger brother ready for school
Said it's a hell of a task
That nigga never had a chance to relax
His father left when he was young
So he the man of the house now
But his mother wasn't nothing more than a fiend
Itching for another fix
Living with the pipe dream
Get the fuck out of the house you got to go and get it
Ain't nobody gonna pay your rent and
Ain't nobody gonna put no fucking food upon the table for your family to eat
You want to starve motherfucker or do you want to survive ?
The only thought upon the young nigga mind is the way he maintains
And maneuvers through a plain
Full of snakes in the grass
And anyone is a seed
When you're looking like a meal
And they might just eat you
He's telling his brother to finish his breakfast so they can both leave
Gotta take him to the bus stop and every other day
The walk consist a different life story
Tryin' to tell him how it is and the way that the world goes
Everything ain't always gonna work out in your favor
But never lose faith
'Cause only God can save us
And do what the fuck It really takes
To stay away from the streets
At least an arm's-length
Do not look for strength
Within the words of another
To cover an insecurity
Courtesy of a hunger
To hustle and get your currency
But never lose sight of the goal
That you're pursuin'
The reason you even do it or who it is that you're helpin'
Try your best to find a purpose
Diverted from any ignorance
And bust your fuckin' ass to make sure that you're more intelligent
But try to understand that you must develop a plan
Never let nobody else make you feel less than

Put your mother fucking backpack on
We out the door in five minutes or less
Say ""Yo, we really gotta go""
His mother banging on the floor
And she begging to get a hit
She feeling sick and he can notice it
He moving up the steps
So he can find out what the issue is
It wasn't insignificant
He went inside his room and saw his mother in the shit again
Running through the stash
He was feeling disappointed
Now why can't you be responsible?
Do you think that it's possible?
That you could be the parent
Instead of giving me obstacles that imma overcome upon the daily
Mom why can't you get a job?
And how the fuck are you dependent on the shit that I've been selling so that we can keep the lights on?
You done turned me and my younger brother into a couple of victims
Of your addiction
But you don't ever want to listen
I'm trying to make 
it happen
 for us here right now
But with the way that you're acting
I see that you don't really care
She was already gone
Lost in a blank stare
It was at that point of time that he finally realized, it was hopeless
Grabbed his younger brother by the hand and said
""We really gotta go the bus is leaving in a couple of minutes""
They get to concrete and moving to get it
You better mind your fucking business while we're out here in the street
I wanna show you how to be a better man
So that you can understand
Everything that shines is not gold
There's a woman selling pussy for the proper restitution
With a nigga pushing pills on the people to feel sedated
There's a body on the ground
But the spirit is elevated
Ain't nobody seen what happened
It's definitely gang related
Just another act of violence committed from one of the natives

And see what im really saying
And sure that's a fucked up lesson

El’ Patron,UnKnown,2016.0," Intro
I said homie look around
I don't see nobody on my level
Why the niggas say they working but they not, and why they always talk a lot
And what the fuck you talk about, and why you always talk about
Some shit you know you never got, some shit you know you never did in life you know you never lived
You was at your mama crib watching Narcos
Cause you the motherfucking man with a plan, I guess
Wrap it up, I need it pronto got a nigga feeling like Pablo
Pronto, said I need a pronto, got a nigga feeling like Pablo
Wrap it up, I need it pronto, said I need it pronto, got a nigga feeling like Pablo
You the motherfucking man with plan, I guess nah you another broke nigga lying bout a check
Nigga you ain't gotta flex
I know you don't do it like Pablo
You watch too much Narcos
 Verse 1
I killed some niggas and buried them where you'll never find em
I sold some crack and than I slapped a bitch with a broken vinyl
I ran a credit card scam with my best friend
I ran off on the plug with some keys, and then got it in
I recently received just enough to lease me a Benz
I'll tint the windows and get some rims, guess what I spent?
The payments cost so much, a step is what you'd like to slip
The sarcastic side of this sign I feel something else
I'm sure I'll sell some records if I sell myself short
Rest assured, I can't convort to the other side of the force
Or resort to go in the store
They twist up the truth that's the proof of promise the pushes, a proven prominent leader
It's my way or the highway, I'm leaving you where I found ya
My shit is deep enough to reach the depths of the Atlantic
It's way over your head but the point is I'm at advantage
I'm feasting upon the feeble that fill me up when I'm famished
I fend off families of four with a form that was foreign to ya
I found my way through the door and the foyer forcing an entrance
Back and forth with a swing and a miss like that shit was tennis
I'm incapable of love, I would always be the winner
You was so put in Wimbledon, I win it twice, then win again
The subtleties of my soliloquies are breezing like the wind
I'm prone to plead the fifth, I'm accurate I never miss
A gargantuan dissertation, an author for explanation
My signature's affirmation like sealing the affidavit
My daily dilemma entails this:
Now should I roll me up a blunt or should I call me a bitch?
I told her bring a pack of 'rillos and a couple of friends
And we'll fornicate and face your foreign flowers and floral patterns and green pastures
While passing the faintest fragrance, i'm painting the vaguest picture
Like my current predecessors, they're predatorial figures
For editorial gimmicks and fallacies for an image

I said homie look around
I don't see nobody on my level
Why the niggas say they working but they not, and why they always talk a lot
And what the fuck you talk about, and why you always talk about
Some shit you know you never got, some shit you know you never did in life you know you never lived
You was at your mama crib watching Narcos
Cause you the motherfucking man with a plan, I guess
Wrap it up, I need it pronto got a nigga feeling like Pablo
Pronto, said I need a pronto, got a nigga feeling like Pablo
Wrap it up, I need it pronto, said I need it pronto, got a nigga feeling like Pablo
You the motherfucking man with plan, I guess nah you another broke nigga lying bout a check
Nigga you ain't gotta flex
I know you don't do it like Pablo
You watch too much Narcos
 Verse 2
I'm an animal baby, I've got this evil inside me
I'll explicitly explain the process of asphyxiation
First you find the weakest victim, for instance
It's Monday evening
I'm feeling the force of blade through your flesh
I testify over open fires, the feelings are found
There's blood dripping from my silhouette
It's cynical, I'm sitting with a sin or two
I made the sound that's to infuse
Except the words I wrote for you
I'm vocal, very vexed I affect the fake with the real
I'm literally inept to emotions that you reveal
I'm sending salutations, so from my side of the hill
There's a villa for vast consumptions
Integrate for mass assumptions
I summon sickening rituals, my cauldron started bubblin'
My rhetoric will render residue that runneth over
My recipe is simple, resonating keep composure
But rest assured my legacy is laced while I say asterisk
I asked the man above for leniency, but see my blasphemies
Are blatant with my lack of apathy, erratic temperament
I'm terribly confused, they knew the truth was for the youth
But what's the use as I am wasting my breath
It seems nobody gives a fuck, and that shit fine by me
Cause honestly my conscious died around the age of 18
Few dispute I'm losing sanity and entering euphoria, receding lucid dreams and out of body experiences is indescribable, I advise you respect the vision,nigga

The piece of these people's opinions, that's pretty pitiful
Archaic, the way that you do this shit, prototypical
I'm caught in this shit like a scene, you provide the visuals
If you wanted a piece of the pie, then you better get it
But I forewarned you niggas this shit could get pretty deep
I'm a wolf to a sheep, no shepherd
To the light that could lead, let me help ya
Nigga please you ain't close to my level
I must
Show my skill again, riddiling with the passion
Like Gilligan off on Ritalin, running around on the island
Spitting my most-est, I'm more or less out of it
Call a doctor, quit vomiting
Why the paramedics take me off of your ottoman
Intolerance, my tolerance hollerin Hallelujah
My mind is moving as wavey as waves out of Honolulu
These niggas selling their souls to do cover arts in a tutu
Nope, no, that's not true
That's hap, if you knew
The whole truth, what you do, what they do, I doubt that
I fell down, and got up, corrected my posture
Imposters that pop up, we feast on like pasta
The king like Mufasa, smell down like a Rasta
My home like Rwanda, Mi Casa Su Casa (yeah)
My comments might contradict
I used to love her like common did
All of this dope shit I commandeer
Right like some 88 counter shit

But I'm a smooth criminal

I'll make a lasting impression like lashes upon the spots of my ancestor or heritage

Barricaded my mind cause I don't want let the devil in
Hallucinated off of LSD and therefore masculine
Medicating my mental capabilities mutilated my will
I live ya life like is it even really real, I bought a dollar bill
An automatic weapon that a nigga would conceal
Aim it at a target pull the trigger till the blood has start to spill
Your cup runeth over till that motherfucker drip upon the page
A revelations of reservations eliminated by my preparation and
Lyrical fornication which formulated personification of the imagination
And elaborate type of labyrinth slapping rapidly, lacking the single lies of human decency
Frequent injections of methamphetamines, metaphorically
Metamorphing into the perfect moment when my soul has been reborn
And only God knows that I will never conform Lord


I lock myself inside of a room as I try to create a masterpiece
Mathematical madness precision down to the decimal
Take it to higher levels, I'm moving it up a decibel
If you're susceptible to professional fundamentals that capture your fascination
You create an interpretation or taking the broader stroke and make a classification
Completely eradicating artistic sophistication aristocratic vocation
Exhilarating elation I chose it for navigation to make a path of my own
Surpassing the aggravation perpetrated allegation my passion and dedication
Is penetrating your politics and if it's honest
You'll never have an internal conflict
Try to convince the world and then place yourself in that image
Where art is imitation reflecting illuminated
The truth will come to the light that your alternate form of flattery
Was just another extension of your demented fantasy
Vandalize with profanity too confused for humanity candidly I'm conducting the sickening type of cynical
Sacrilegious and criminal plan that couldn't be broken was spoken
It's not divisible minimal or remissible in any court of public opinion
So fuck your feminine feelings from this moment within the present to infinity
Recipe for divinity written within this imagery symmetry of my energy
Synergy of the sinister penning the proper living convinced the post  re-visuals
I viciously victimize while I victim you leaving you destitute without a restitution or a resolution
For your convolution of my revolution and the best solution
Solidifying constant confusion or current illusion that are eluding that your inclusion
Infusing the few formalities fanatics suffocate upon formaldehyde from publication came with degradation
And a sunny deposition the audacity that ever supposition when you listen
I'm fixing to be the greatest lyricist that sees a living if given the opportunity

Bipolar than a motherfucker, need to get a new bottle of pills
Keep it real kill all niggas
Hope you bringing unlimited ammunition you've hidden within the brim of your goose down Hilfiger
Conversating with my delegates, delegating rules and regulations with censorship in my sentences

I overdose with a terrapin, me and Boomer Esiason going off on a Niacin
Ripping up rap riff, a pharmaceutical connoisseur
Lionel Richie the commodore, commandeering the carnivore
This is lyrically nautical, hold it down like a barnacle
Sound is overly audible, audience of the audio
Automatically delegate, celebrating with decadence
Searching for the derivative, deriving from the fact that I'm black
Refusing to give a shit, Kendrick put out ""Control"" and motherfuckers got sensitive
Caught up in your feelings revealing that you the biggest bitch
Passion in a paragraph, pain in the words that I speak
You the realest nigga living if you practice what you preach
They put a cold ass killer on a mothafucking beat
Had to rip it to you niggas running rampant in the street
Don't touch that body let that motherfucker leak
Extremities in the freezer, I'm a motherfucking beast
In a white padded room with a one of a kind jacket
While offering niggas medicine, medicate with the Mescaline
Before the medication they forcing the mastication
While fornicating the kid, is the copious complication
The mental asphyxiation of over-exaggeration
I'm guessing you really like it, the sound was pretty enticing
I run this shit like a viking, sweet enough of a vicodin
Inviting any villain to battle, whenever hassled I strangulate with a tassel
To curbstomp on the gravel, I'm passing on my aggression but never passive aggressive
Reciting an aphorism, expecting an aborigine, acceptance is in the goal
Subliminally controlled, to minimize your emotion and give me all your devotion
I spit a lyrical portion, and give a poisonous potion
I treat it like an abortion, I kill it but can't support it
It's dangerous, rigor mortis, the realization of it
The dollar is what you covet, that's terribly dissenting
Cause nigga's offered their custom, I'm knocking out your bicuspid
What comes up in my discussion, it sounds like a percussion
The page is a punching bag and my words give a concussion
Yeah my words give a concussion, cousin
I guess I had to hit the brakes on it, just a nigga trying get a second wind tho'
I've been knocking at the motherfucking door, like is anybody there tryna let a nigga in though
Oh well back to the drawing board, I guess a nigga gotta go and pick it up (up,up,up,up)
Middle finger to anyone of you haters, why you actin' like a nigga is supposed to give a fuck (fuck,fuck,fuck,fuck)
I got a whole lot of hate, little love, paranoid so a nigga personally don't trust
I guess I gotta take it down for a minute, I've been going too fast and I need the people to get it like
Uhh that's nasty, flow is retarded my style is ridiculous, murder the witnesses
Pray for forgiveness, repenters with pennies perpetual killer that's pissed like a semi
To bury a nigga in the cemetery, position may vary, production is scary
You killin' this shit man is that necessary
But for my survival I murder my rivals, the smoke from the barrel infuses the bible
Don't get it confused bitch I'm still suicidal
So call paramedics to check on my vitals
I'm nervous as fuck like this my first recital
Your flow is on layaway, rhymes are recycled
The mind of a nigga is missing a light
Someone say a prayer, tonight is the night
My angelic lyrics were given no limits

Sirens,4/29/17,2018.0,"Um, look
I pray for higher favor
No lie or hesitatin'
No time is not for wastin’
No sittin' round or waitin'
Excuse my rude introduction, I’m not a people person
Recently reacquaintin' my cadence is kingly banter
I black the fuck out and change, my new name is Eric Bana
Affect the culture like Iverson, he's the fuckin' Answer
We're talkin' practicin' persistence
A perfectionist perfecting his profession
Insistin' they peep the messages
Like oh, it’s such a lovely day, it’s a blessin' to be here
I used to think I fail at this but now I’m on some Pharaoh shit
My ten commandments, it's mandatory you check the referendum
Reprimandin' I stand alone as somethin' you can’t avoid
A man of few words, my nigga fuck what you heard
I spit that rhetoric ahead of these regulatory sedatives
The way these niggas grind, it's low tide, a sign of the times
I compose my sentences like they editorial segments, lawd

Young nigga with a dollar and a dream
Tryna get it in the million necessary my nigga
I ain't worried 'bout another motherfucker
I've been focused in the zone, do you get it my nigga
Levitate and float away, I'm tryna leave now, now
I elevated and I'm gonna shut the beat down, down
I came back in, stayed movin', no slackin'
Pay attention, no lackin'
Before we make you tap in, oh

I got the focus right, I'm zonin' in, I see my goal
My vision straight, my feeling's great
I will verbally castrate
The pastor say you pass the safe
It's past the point of passive pleasantries
I'm pretty sure you're done
This painstakin' pageantry is masterfully demonstrated
The stain of degradation, bangin' like a kick drum
This one's an exception
 grants an example of proper grammar
And granted I know I'm biased
Like Pontius Pilate condemnin' it, lawd

Tryna get it in the million necessary my nigga

I'm terrified that I'm falling off
I've been secluded ashamed that I've lost it forgiving myself is done the test
Now I'm revising the vision
Slow down the rhythm Its easy to listen but fuck your opinion I've heard it before
I'm a force to be reckon with wreck that resonate
Running like Ricky right into the alley
Allow me to make the proper introduction I

I couldn't stop if I tried (2x)

See that nigga working with intentions to get it when I speak it into existence and I make it into reality now bounce
Don't feel the energy I'm in a meager mode and needed more that what I've been given and lemme talk
I ain't never been repetitive I beat up the cadence I can't believe these motherfuckers got nerve
This shits absurd
Boy you should watch and observe
Pay attention you could learn
I think its crazy
They told me about life
All the shit I should love
All the things I should like
Even what I should do but it's just for materials
Nothing that's gonna solve all my problems
See I still be lonely searching for acceptance
My random repentance is past do
I'm indebted and high been that and been back
Don't relax just relapse on releasing verses that kept you attentive
Taking your time to dissect every sentence
I document daily with devious dialogue
This time ain't different I definitely am with no misinterpretation tell em bring the base in
My shit never basic
Some might say abrasive
Overbearing baritone with a chip on my shoulder I carry that
Sacrificing I feeling like Makavelli
See I want the rose and then go herringbone
Cause apparently you the reason that's your own
Not the life that you dedicated toward the art
I put ten thousand hours inside of the craft

I need the recognition I'm not given
These talent-less artists are all over hyped
My foresight is intact I'm correct my intent is to take what I want but I leave no remains
The main objective I suggest that you practice
Prepare for the passion
The slaughter like behind the martyrs whose moral compass misconstrued for the rhetoric
Take my time
Tried to terrorize
I tell of traumatizing tell of trepidation fails
And I cannot excel
The hatred I expel is exponential very detrimental
In a sense what I was but this time has passed
Now I'm power hungry hurry hustle harder
I'll hold onto faith I have yet to obtain I'm a terrible tyrant this tower is terrific
Hit you with the symbolic synonym
Put the venom in
Sweetened sugar is in enemy is want another round
As I expend the mood and dispend that's expendature
That's in a couple of minutes
I've been accustomed to killing
Every track that I speak on
I lead you back to the promise land as I demand the manor
I operate is immaculate
My imagination has made me very uneasy
I want the antidote to cope with something that I can believe
I achieve the amount of success
Acquiring inner peace but in abundance
Something that's soothing in silence the pain I cannot continue to feel mentally drained I respond on my theory when I know you're ready
And I know you're ready

I'm working hard to obtain

Always been a nigga with a disposition
Didn't ever listen so I played the villain
Pacing like a mental patient, 'bout to kill it
Gotta get it while the getting's good
I'ma strike while the iron's the perfect heat
Man I make all these niggas look obsolete
The examples of what you should never be
Take the pen and I create a masterpiece
Da Vinci for the beat, let it rest in peace
I'm an anomaly that you never seen
On the course for the wealth, I’m not talking green
Looking for the knowledge, nothing in between
Said my pendulum swing like a guillotine
I’m convinced I can really do anything
Said my shit is dope, it sound like Medellin
You fuck around, they'll find you in the mezzanine
I wanted better things, a mausoleum dream
I’m the immortalized now treat me like a king
I'll fill the void you're feeling
It's the craziest thing that  I make ’em swallow
You should think and may be here to see tomorrow
Cause the time we living on is fucking borrowed
Gotta pay into this if you play the way you try to get out the same position you been in
It appears that you fought wit' yo' back to the wall if you really gon' rat on them all

I payed the cost, I took a loss
Yeah I got flows and I know this
But I regroup, then I recoup
Got off the ground and then got on my grind
Moving forward, I'm not looking behind
Second guessing wasting all of my time
Don't block out my light, just let this shit shine like aah
Can I breathe?
Can I think?
Can I just be me?
Indentured servitude, y'all act like it's a crime to be free
When I rhyme, I release, this tension on my mind
Can you please show some compassion to a nigga before the day that I leave?
I'm tryna float like a butterfly, and sting like a bee
Perspective I speak, can show you how the caged bird sings
A black mans nightmare is the new American dream
Let's make it great again
But can you inform me when this shit was great for everyone and not just some, I wonder
Columbus stumbled upon the mainland by making a blunder
A couple more days at sea, the Niña, Pinta and Santa Maria would have definitely fucking gone under
A fleet of pagan savages led by a broken compass
Saved by the same people, they would enslave
Spreading disease, they rape and pillage everything that they seen
What do you mean American history?
They've hideously hidden everything that they've done
That can't be forgiven, look but that's just me
And when the land and acres were split for the bread
Well, that's when it stopped being the land of the free

Yo, I said
Heh, I be sayin' some real word up

Figure it out when you get home!

If I get up on the beat and I can leave it barely breathing
For no reason motherfucker man up, nigga what?
If the flow is getting sporadic eradicating rappers
If a motherfucker speak about nonsense
I gotta make it a tangible feeling revealing
The way I'm living is nothing more than fucking contradiction
I admit it but it was never a given a nigga would be existing
If what i give is deficient and playing at your digression
And promise you pay attention I have the best of intentions
Eliminating descending depending upon my page
The problems is you're all taking the politics and illusions
Diluted to what I'm doing
Included to what I'm proving
Your ignorance is the bar and I hope that wasn't confusing
You'll remember when this lyrical literary abusing AH

Put the pen upon the page and I'll promise you'll feel the pain
And a picture a nigga painting a portrait that was contained
And the emotions I've been displaying explaining I wasn't much
And my confidence never present my promiscuity spewing
Excusing the effervescent niggas steady representing
There's a question that I really want ask tho
How is success ever equated with the cash flow?
But I will never compensate with any of these assholes
That only wanna talk about the money the bitches the business
And pitching a pack of narcotics up in the area of codes
And then give a disclaimer like I had to fucking do it
I got people that I feed so tell me what you were doing
You was in my situation running out of patience debating
On how the fuck you finna pay the rent
I could never judge a person for what they currently do
I don't know what that motherfucker has really been through
God Damn

One time for your mind with the rhyme from the realest
These niggas giving you feeling I can believe that you feel it
You gotta be fucking kidding and what the music is listening
Imma call intermission I said I've been on a mission
I've integrated my soul with the sound
I gotta tell the truth and a lie is never allowed
I isolate myself inside a room there's no time for fucking around
Shit I gotta build it up from the ground
Nigga resurrect a record I prefer doing everything I can
To make sure that I separate myself from every other motherfucker
In reality they never gave a damn
I've been telling everybody I'm developing a plan
It started off with a flow but these niggas don't understand

Gimme some sense but a lot of it
'Til I'm mentally out of it
Folding under the pressure but let me fade away
Attributing all my abilities
I'm quick to allocate
Don't agitate my spirit
I'm temperamental and terrifying
Verify my legacy
Lyrically a legend
I'm a living legend, left for dead, before I had to honor them
I call it like I see it, redirect if I don't like it
Resurrect the realer feeling I rape and pillage
Like a viking, god damn!
I don't make excuses I just go and get it
I fortify the figure four, I put them in submission
Now place myself in a position so we can achieve
Little have an guava juice and now look at the p's

I want the happiness that all these mother fuckers preach
I do relate, I hesitate to meditate with higher entities
I'm moderately incoherent
I sit in the crossfire spaced out

Explicitly spilling
My feelings I keep them far away

Won't somebody please believe me?
How come every time I lead is when they tell me that need me
Greedy people like ""pretty please won't you appease it for the moment Nigga
We could give a fuck about your pain
What the hell is hurt
Don't you understand that your worth is not connected to your last hit?
Now make another one, quick! I need it fast nigga
But don't do all the fast rap that back nigga
And don't forget to say nigga about a million times""
Keep your vocabulary as large as a grain of salt
Cause that's the only thing these stupid motherfuckers want
Don't show your skill
I need a melody and a catchy hook
You get me that and we can get a generation hooked
Tell them everything to do except for read a book

You and I we are not alike, no we're not the same
What's my name, what's my fuckin' name, tell me what's my name
Don't put a camera on a nigga ain't no need for me to flex

It really doesn't matter at this point I got nowhere to go

You'll get extorted then escorted out of my presence
These mufuckas lazy and it's clearer to see now
But you can find me writin' I got nowhere to be
I'm just a fuckin' workaholic, shit I feel like Gary V
Apparently I murder beats with kerosene I'm pretty flammable
How to (sell my rhymes?) I say I do it, I do it

Look, now ain't no pressure on ya, relax and take a breath
I relapse and spaz with the fact that its not alternative
I will black out or snap on a track, they 'gon need a tourniquet
Determined, tryna turn the engine on so I can start the race
My mind is lost, my vision strains, I focus yes I do so
When the time is right I'll shine as bright as diamonds in the rough
I hope the stars align my talent blind I don't think that's enough
I'm feelin' low again' I roll and light to take another puff!
No matter how high that I...(no matter how high-igh)
No matter how high that I...(no matter how high-igh)

Eh, knowledge nigga
Eh x4
Lawd, look

I'm a cold blooded animal
I don't know where my mind go
Got a nine to five I work a lot
I do it for survival
I supply you with a sound it's super soothing
It was not confusing
No illusion
I can tell you what the definition mean
My flow is sweeter than a cup of soda mixed with grenadine
Agree I fill the seat as I prepare with generosity
The pastor passed away and now the church has got an empty seat
A crucifix across my heart to sanctify my enemies
The vanity of master-minds that you have been believing in
It's nothing but a lie of your perception with aesthetics
I accepted that your soul was never ready for the spiritual
My suicide attempts have yet to work, ain't that a miracle
I'm cleaning out my conscious, put a broom up in the closet
Yeah the skeletons are in the corner right next to my self-esteem, overtop of the bible and the chapters that I'll never read
I guess I lost my faith I couldn't find it in disparity
I'm pacing praying hoping that prosperity and clarity is in the future for this dude
The truth is terrifying you
The pain that was induced
Nothing to lose
When you were destitute
Determined try to turn your situation from pathetic
To perpetual prominence preparing you for a blessing
Pray the power you receive is something that you can appreciate
Never take it for granted your confidence can depreciate
If you never acknowledge it then it's sure to emaciate
The agony is prevalent say a prayer to alleviate
Leaving it where you found it astounded by solidarity
It varies on the days when I'm not severely depressed
So sitting ,staring at my shadow solitude don't seem to help at all
And this is not reality
I should get my shit together maybe make a strategy
Before I cut my wrist and turn my life into a casualty and casually die before my time
I'm a sicker kind
Never lead you blind
I rewind
Giving you all that I got, I said that i'm taking a shot
Your flow is a flop, you wanted to call me a lot
The lyrical literal hot, that you would decline
Then give it a minute to find, the nigga would shine
Presenting it right, is that what you want
Then why the complaints
I said that i'll change, but never explain
I said i'm working with intensity that's so abrupt
My flow a cobra clutch
An uppercut
Leaving you niggas stuck
A legendary lyrical leader ledger encompassing
Now come and take a seat, the masterpiece
Was written by this beast
I beat the song to death
With a derelict in distress
Or a destination for rest
With a flow thats a minor test
And I swear that you'll respect it
Regardless of what you thinking
My perspective is immaculate
Accurate not inadequate

Oh what you thought that I was finished
I frantically bring it back again
The fucking fact remains that I am focused on my fantasy
The essence of the sentences synchronize with my sanity
Popularize the promise insert a proper profanity
Apparently it's paramount to pimp them out with vanity
And that becomes the norm so that people can 
form

Try to improve, but it's all for a lost and the costing
I'm constantly pinging this painstaking it pitiful
Penalized by reality, realising my limits is difficult dealing with the illusions inside my mind, ah
Pray for a happy ending, before apathy sets in
Asking a single question, like what's the purpose for this
Where's the communication, we used to speak on the regular now it's only seldom
This separation i see is something unnecessary
At least from my perspective, my pride and my heart protected
You knew every issue i have with dealing with rejection
I took all of the flaws i had and put 'em on the table
I told you all my insecurities and yet you judge me
It's funny all this materialistic shit you covet
In actuality, dulling, your mentality shallow
You wanna worry 'bout the surface level shit that other people can grasp as i
Pass it all with the masquerades, the sky charades, and lies you say
But only to me
I guess that i was never really that important
But you feel the way you feeling i can't force it baby
Nor do i have the time, so i choose to ignore
Prefer to do this by myself, the bullshit i avoid
The voice in you
My opinion and my pain is pointless
Tryna keep it all together but i'm torn and it seems that
Singing the melody fill with sorrow
And my attention is currently borrowed
I'm at the moment eternally hollow
Not looking for a sista for tomorrow

But that is if you want to make it to the top
Realize that the pain don't stop
Got to formulate a plot and a plan I'm hoping you understand
Your destiny's in the palm of your hand
Take control the role that you know you wanna play
Your focus and dedication will never leave you astray
To display the realest of any passion
You was never relaxing
Asking what it takes to finally get a break
The mistake that most people will make
Is believing shit is real when it was actually fake
Can I vent upon the page?
And try to give you the pain
Paint a picture of the problems that reside in the brain
With the man that was living with insanity
Is anyone understanding me?
Vanity is a curse
My happiness in a hearse
I disperse the lyrical content, you converse
Immersed inside a verse to me depicting my hurt
But first ima be honest abolishing any ignorance
I'm polishing the flow and demolishing any evidence
The truth has been distorted
They know it that I'll be peddling and passing my competition
Habitual repetition and with the way I kill it
They want me to get evicted
I bet they start a petition
But I built the definition of factual tunnel vision
I mention on getting a shot
But never the penicillin I'm willing to bust my ass
If opportunities are given you gotta be fucking kidding
I'm dying to make a difference, they lying to make a living
I can read between the lines in the motherfuckin sentence
Said you was never concerned or be preaching within my words
Sacrifice or repentance but not internally burn

Try to make a hit off this anguish that I claim
I put my life inside these lyrics hoping that you can see my pain
With all this agony I feel, I think that I'm going insane
To live forever through the music that's all that I want to attain
FUCK !
I guess it all depends on a mindstate that a young motherfucker nigga's really in DAMN! (3x)
I sit with my thoughts
The page and the pen
I write about life and how it all ends

I gotta take my time, so that I can murder your mind
To find inner peace that a nigga never felt
But nobody ever helps
They can never comprehend
The illest of illustrations that I'm giving with a pen
The depiction of my vision was given with a description
But never a contradiction
Admitting to my addiction was only giving me friction
To go and get a prescription
I know it's not the answer, the last man standing
The man in the ransom, and mutilate the game
Insane like Charles Manson, going off of on a tangent
Throwing a temper tantrum
Death will come in a tandem
You probably never seen it
If I gave you the truth I know you wouldn't believe it
My thesis is that I could be one of the greatest  that ever did it for ripping the mic
It all changed
They treat it like it's a canvas
I was lost in a trance
The flow was never pedantic
I was tired of your antics
Ya'll been taking advantage
But I'm looking for answers
Gotta make it an anthem
Originality in the fallacy of the fornicated
I was formulated, abated, never debated
I've innovated evasivley
Facing my fucking destiny
How the hell willI I make it?
I'm baking without a recipe
Rest in peace to the beat that remained of what I've wrung
Leave 'em believe 'em
My sounds egregious, enough to cause the bereavement I've seen
That most motherfuckers never want to see you make it
I try to deal with the hatred
And find a way to replace it
That boy could have been famous
And now he's strung out like an addict all day
The pain is a constant reminder
I've gotta use blinders and try to put the bullshit behind us
Your highness is they fittin' to call me
It's KAAN, that's knowledge above all
I said I leave 'em appaled
My god, they all gawk when staring at a reflection
Receptive and kept and I spin it like a weapon
Step in with a different type of mindstate
An automatic spitter but a nigga never breaks
I know you wouldn't relate to the fate of the man with the hope to devote all the time to the craft
The sickest of any rapper
Rap for my power
Never want to devour
Bow down you coward
Leairly I was complicated, concentrated, contemplated
Couldn't even wait for the moment to say I made it
But the time moves slow
And my life's so basic
I said I can't take it
And all I feel is hatred
I roll another blunt to keep me mentally sedated and faded
I said the day may change but it's always the same shit
I'm still suicidal and the Bible don't help
So I guess I gotta do it by myself

Try to make a hit off this anguish that I claim
I put my life inside these lyrics hoping that you can see my pain
With all this agony I feel, I think that I'm going insane
To live forever through the music that's all that I want to attain
FUCK !
I guess it all depends on a mindstate that a young motherfucker nigga's really in DAMN! (3x)
I sit with my thoughts
The page and the pen
I write about life and how it all ends
{Verse 3}
I know I'm going to hell for sins I posses in my soul that your eyes can't see
I recede to believe
There's a possibility that the grief of the green has been coming in between
Will the means intervene if I turn into a fiend for the cream?
Let it consume your dreams
Demeaning as it seems
I'm cleaning out my closet
Consequence of the conscience
The drugs made a nigga brain dead like a zombie
Lost in a depression
Never learning my lesson
Acceptance was the main goal of a young adolescent
With a dollar and a dream
Plus a penny for your thoughts
But nobody ever thinks
Stick around with the ship the moment they see it sink
That's a fucking metaphor
I adore any lack of attention
Dispensing dissension without the attention
Defending my right to ignite {?}
Said I was a mothefucking goner
Couldn't have been wronger
My will got strong but the stress last longer
The pain is a part of the process I must digest to progress
In the midst of the mess that I made
But I'm praying that my lord will save and protect
But I get a good feeling that a motherfucker next
I ain't talking 'bout fame nigga
Speak about death
I'll be ready when it comes
Take the necessary step
Inhale exhale
Take a real deep breath even though I want to die
Thank God I'm alive
Never want to be a nigga that can only say he tried
But somebody that had made it from the plan they devised
And attempts to divide the supply with the people that would ride
Giving everything I got
Doing more to survive only thing that's on a young motherfucking nigga mind
Damn

Try to make a hit off this anguish that I claim
I put my life inside these lyrics hoping that you can see my pain
With all this agony I feel, I think that I'm going insane
To live forever through the music that's all that I want to attain

Real,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Uh-huh ey, yes lawd, Knowledge nigga, uh-huh
We gonna do something a little different we gonna take it back, look one time for ya, one time for ya
Look, we gotta give them something they can feel, make it real
Yo we gotta give them something they can feel, make it real
Yo we gotta give them something they can feel make it real
We prefer to tell the truth and never keep it concealed
Look, if you knew, like I knew, then you do like I do
Told them the sound was real don't ever get it confused
Yo, we gotta give them something they can feel, make it real. x2

Now I reiterate myself on this paper promise to tell the truth, I'm ignoring distractions, in fact I'm finally focused, I found a flow I can go with, engulfing all your attention, my time is spent with the music, right now I'm truly invested. been tested by my environment, priorly by proprietors, profitizing from pain, its impossible to be positive, Looking for inspiration among-st a line of obscurity. Worries me I don't see any empathy, common courtesy. Currently and priority, purposely we're avoiding it, try to voice my opinion, but fuck it, I'm just a hypocrite, depicted different situations some people relate to, I came through my mind-state, was make sure my rhyme's straight, I can't take no time off, I don't deal with BS, I won't live with regrets, I detest, I'm too stressed, they giving you negative vibes, they barley try, say that we living to die, its never the way that it seems, they selling their soul in return for a dream
Am I different? Nigga yes I am
But am I gifted? Nigga yes I am
And do ya'll feel this? Nigga yes we can
And I'm the dopest motherfucker lemme say it again. x2

Now take my time when I am writing this, enlighten you with conciseness. I like to think they get the point I make is positivity. The power I posses is in my pen is unequivocally, the sentences I formulate inspired by my misery. Literally terrified, when I die no-one will remember me, the only thought I have inside my mind, is leave a legacy. Before I perish and they find me near the Devil's mezzanine, underneath a sub-scaffold, and next to 24 buildings with double sided partitions. Imported beautiful pews, and the view is fucking amazing, and now I can actually rest, been obsessing over my death since the moment of my conception, kept everything inside of me going insane silently. A victim of circumstances, but never of society, I sit, proceed to ponder how am I able to sleep at night when I'm not even where I wanna be, at least within my life, giving you my motivation, no hesitation, isn't it really amazing
I said we gotta give them something they can feel, make it real
Yo we gotta give them something they can feel make it real
Yo we gotta give them something they can feel make it real.         We prefer to tell the truth and never keep it concealed
Look, if you knew, like I knew
Then you do like I do, told you the sound was real don't ever get it confused
Yo we gotta give them something they can feel, make it real. x2

Look at the plight of my people, they force us to deal with politics, feeling deeply effected, they treat us like an infection. Elimination of knowledge, abundancy of our vices. And we're ingesting the poison we're given, leaving us lifeless, no talk of a revolution cause niggas are too complacent, I feel a sense of disgust when I look at my generation, There's actually inequality within these different races, if your'e black your interaction with police is confrontation, but you act like this brutality has not happened for ages, there ain't not turning of pages, instead I'm setting the scene, out in Texas they'll fucking murder you for traffic infractions, violation your civil liberties and all of your rights, if you don't understand the law then you can call it a night, getting harassed, thrown on your ass, and then they taking your life, but this reality is feeling very nightmare-like, I said its all the same thing from Sandra to Rodney King
I said we gotta give them something they can feel, make it real
Yo we gotta give them something they can feel, make it real
Yo we gotta give them something they can feel, make it real
We prefer to tell the truth and never keep it concealed
Now am I different? Nigga yes I am
But am I gifted? Nigga yes I am
And do ya'll feel this? Nigga yes we can
And I'm the dopest motherfucker lemme say it again. Lord, eh",https://genius.com/Kaan-real-lyrics

Clandestine with your weak attempts
It's not a hit, you ain't make a dent
Man these niggas sounding kinda spent
I'm a connoisseur of the finer shit
I'm a make a mill' off the rhyming shit
Came a long way from top ramen
Bitch, you went the wrong way down a dead-end
I took the back steps but never back-peddled
Had to hit the clutch and make the gear switch
Driving reckless bitch, that's the Twisted Metal
Dark as Darth Vader I am, came up from playing my hand
I couldn't stay in the stands
I had to jump off the porch and then climb up a mountain like fuck it, lets see where I land
'Cause I wanted me a Benz, Benz, Benz, Benz
The type where the rims spin, spin, spin
Sitting on twenty twin, twin, twin
The engine go  ah

Diamond in the rough, I bet I call your bluff
I bet I bet it back, you better double up, uh

Then y'all wonder why you never won

If This World Were Mine,UnKnown,2017.0,"Give me just one second, Imma take you
Way back when I had no help though
All I had was a dream and a pen though
Only one I would ever depend on
Is the man in the mirror I see him
Panickin' through the rhyme and I'm seething
Can't trust when they change like seasons
I'm a natural loner, I leave them
I'm a well versed leader, on speaker
Said it's all for the takin', I'm feastin'
Bumpin' and thumpin' and jumpin' around
I think they in love with the sound
Don't turn this shit down
The flow is amazin', they feel it
I fornicate to flip a pen
I guess it did
Never been timid my friend, silence just let me begin
Ah, still remember every difficult moment
So how in the fuck could you judge me?
I would take thirty-five dollars to go and record
Middle of Baltimore, I'm from the county
I'm not familiar with my new surroundings
Honestly, I don't like people around me
An extra fifty for the proper mix
I'm tired of stressin' over basic shit
I couldn't take it, lord, I had to elevate it
So I sacrificed so I could regulate it
I never hesitate, I made a confident move
I know what I want so I am never confused
The view that I see from my beautiful pew
Is purely subjective, I swear that it was
A different perspective so now I can live
My positivity's infectious

Oh lord, just bring the bass up again
I came on here with an attitude, nigga'
Takin' what I want to, no gratitude, nigga'
Gimme three years, Imma pass them niggas
Man, I got no time I can waste
I can't be holdin' no grudges, I don't need negative energy
Instead of giving you hate, I create and kill with soliloquies
Hol' up, back to the story I was tellin' from the I-95 with the windows down, one destination
Gotta make it there
Off a Steel Reserve, my partner laughin'
Police behind me, nigga', light the blunt
And turn the system louder, I ain't thinkin' about them
I'm gone
I get the pedal and move with speed
No other way that I kill a beat
My flow is like methamphetamines
Listen close and you'll be high as hell
Indubitably the way I excel
Insidiously you will make assumptions
They ain't saying nothing
I advise revision
He who wrote the sentence is a poet or saint
Got no complaints, I'm ecstatic as fuck
Keepin' the faith and you pressin' your luck
I'm in a situation feelin' stuck
Focus as ever proceeded with concentration
Nigga' imma get it, got no time for waiting
Why the fuck are we talking about the payment
How the money come into the conversation?

Fire & Brimstone,Losing My Religion,2014.0,"7:30 in the morning
Light from the dawn hits the cracks of his eyes
Who arise in a world that he hates and despise
To reside in the side of a town where the colors
That you wear might get a nigga lynched boy
Fill that motherfucking bench boy
That's the pain of the game
And the bullet that came from the frame of the weapon that was built for the automatic kill
The trickling blood spilt
To load it up to the top
And captivate till it pop
Seen your prey drop in the center of the street
Nigga died for the motherfucking shoes on his feet
All stemmed from the beef that occurred last week
An altercation with niggas he had never even seen
Didn't see the bullet coming so he never had a chance
A head on collision that ended a young life
He seen him in the morning
Nigga never got involved with the guns or the drugs
Or the bitches or the cars
He was living with a cost
But paid the ultimate cost
A feeling he had lost
But praying over the body
But the soul been gone
Just another victim of the Willie Lynch syndrome
Let me put you on game
Take a minute to explain
I'ma take you to the British West Indies
Slave trade when a man with a speech came in with a thought that confused all blacks
That's a motherfucking fact
With a page full of hate
Ideas they could take to control all slaves
Even to this fucking day
And that should leave you amazed
The fact we influenced by a motherfucking man from the 1700's
I'ma try to be exact with the stats I relate
Please pay attention to the words that a nigga say
Before a Jim Crow law
Willie Lynch had evolved
The diabolical scheme
That he had seen in a dream
The friction between race
The pigmentation of faith
Light-skinned, dark-skinned, the old against young
That's enough to make ya nauseous
Dividing and they conquer
Killin' the subconscious
A manifesto
Full of nothing but some nonsense
Same thought pattern that I'm seeing on the constant
America's to blame for this young black conflict
Take away they confidence and turn 'em into convicts
Hm... Huh
We're livin' in disparity
And all I pray for is clarity
To find peace of mind yeah that's a rarity
And I'm dropping knowledge but that's sparingly
And that thought of death is not scaring me
I said like a G you better bury me
I said like a G you better bury me
And when I'm dead and gone will you remember me
And when I'm dead and gone will you remember me
And on my grave pour a little bit of Hennessy
I said I give a picture for this men to see
And I'm suicidal don't envy me
And I'm suicidal don't envy me
And I'm suicidal don't envy me
Crazy how his life came to a halt
From the bullet that he caught
His younger brother had saw
He had died in his arms
They're ringin' him no alarm
For causin' a nigga harm
Conversation with his mom
She would try and keep him calm
And tell him ""remain strong""
But his brain gone off on a whole 'nother tangent
Causin' a nigga pain for he has manifested
The hatred he held inside has now festered
Bubbled and boiled over
Turnin' that kid colder
Lookin' for the motherfucker that took his older brother
Got a pistol in the trunk
With the automatic pump
To blast on him and dump
When he saw the nigga run
He would pull the trigger more
The body hittin' the floor
The gun let off a roar
Like a Vietnam tour
It's the same old sound, from the same old war
Two black men dead, and what was it all for?
That's the same bullshit your favorite rapper would endorse
The hatred of one another and I'm givin' you the source
The genocide of a people that treat it like it's a sport
And since they're currently on they're hardly keepin' afford
I know I'm goin' to Hell, for the way I'm livin' is wrong

Mind Games,UnKnown,2019.0,"Eh, uh huh
Lawd, Knowledge
Uh huh, eh

Off with they heads again
Lost my philosophy
Blood from the guillotine drips causing a shallow puddle
Watch it trickle down to the gutter to please the peons
Going inside a cluster of thoughts, they all negative
My attention span isn't vast, it's vague and vulnerable, yes
I feel the test of character, I can't continue to fall
These passages passing judgement like relics wrote 'em theyselves
Religious leaders and hypocritical seekers that read a chapter and only take from what they can gain
My frame of mind is fine in sanctity, it's sheltered from hate
I state the obvious for some, I feel like most can't relate
Embrace the pain I took from solitude like love to the youth
I get in the booth, I'm moving and getting a boot
I said that I'm searching for truth, living aloof
So why are you looking confused?
I do whatever I choose
I've been aware of the consequences and the repercussions
Complicated cousins I will cut 'em off
I am self efficient so it's fuck 'em all
And if it ain't about you then don't get involved
I am working to make it all possible
I can overcome the obstacles
No one is living this life but me
Story like I'm Mephistopheles
I wanna sit for a second
I don't think anyone listen
Taking a moment, I'm making 'em realize that it's my time and I want it all
For the simple fact I'm on another level
People talk but they ain't really ready
I could give a fuck about a failure
Never sorry and I tried to tell ya
Confidence, that shit can get ya killed
Death in dozens over dollar bills
Shit get realer when the rent is due
Anything for you to make it through
Destitution ain't a fucking option, it's a fucking problem, I'ma find the answer
You pedantic with your pessimism
Do revision on your attitude
Motivated, tryna make it happen
This life's a game but I like to play it
Satanic forces wanna hold me back
But I been focused on a holy land
Like a resurrection out of Nazareth
And I'm elaborate with this rapping shit
I been maximizing all my potential
Like expose a loss and don't show a win
But I chose to live with my list of sins
If you listening, I make it obvious
I can't contradict for no dollar sign
I don't feel connected to a net worth
So I keep pushing and I hope it works
I feel like I'm running in place, nowhere to escape
I'm stuck in a vigorous chase
Illicitly setting the tempo and pace
I never settle for less, expressing emotions I used to repress
The lyrical fashion in which I confessed
I fight for my sanity, I will contest
But nevertheless, I'm working, admitting my stress
Finding a way to relate, these people are fake
They giving me hate like a fade
As though I should pay attention, you don't get a mention
Measure me by the man that I am
A nigga that's playing his hand
Now you understand, I do this shit without no help
Self-appointed poet pushing limits
Putting my all into every sentence
Sanctified by the all mighty
Very focused is the way you find me
Meeker man'll give a pissed opinion
Bitter life, and better life created

Insomnia,Losing My Religion,2014.0,"Can't sleep
Nigga can't sleep
I can't sleep
I can't sleep lawd

I'm wide awake
I can't sleep and

I can't sleep still wide awake
And I can't sleep still wide awake
And I think I lost my fucking mind
Cause I swear to God I wanna die today (2x)

Now take it back to the motherfucking days
When a young nigga didn't have any fucking problems
Where do you go and who do you call?
When you feel like you ran out of every fucking option
And I'm a pill pop till a nigga feel nauseous
Suicide on my mind got me mentally exhausted
Fell in love with the pain of cutting my own wrist
And watching the blood drip, don't nobody give a shit
Until that motherfucker trip
Gone postal
Loco
Damn a nigga lost it
What does everybody think that I am finna do?
Here's something you can never understand
Is the way I kill a man
Make a life seem minuscule
Been a fool
Tried to OD back in middle school
Losing my composure
I'm dosing but tryna keep it cool
Cause if it don't make money
Than it don't make sense
In the land where a handful of cash rules
Dirt broke
The way that niggas are re-tenant
Complacent with being tenant
The problem never lieutenant
In a system where ownership depended on profession
Confessin' that I'm obsessed
With the craft that I've adapted
To write a spiritual doctrine
I back it up by conflict I deal with on the constant
Skeletons in my closet
Place sins on my conscience
Does anybody ever listen when a young nigga speak?
My god!
What?
You ain't got a voice in your head
That tell you to leave 'em dead
Turn the white wall red, nigga
Cut a motherfucker throat
I sit and I watch 'em choke
Suffocate upon your last fucking breath, nigga
Schizophrenic yes I am
Another young black man
With a whole lot of pain
I have nothing to lose
And everything to obtain
Going crazy with these suicidal thoughts in my brain

I can't sleep still wide awake
And I can't sleep still wide awake
And I think I lost my fucking mind
Cause I swear to God I wanna die today (2x)

Now I personally feel you should never get involved
With a psychopathic killer that's living closer to God
In a blacked out room with a demon on the wall
Already hallucinating from a handful of acid
Crashed the damn van inside of the mad casket
Cultivated the vision re-visual whiplashes
Premonitions of death, I've seen through thick glasses
I'm runnin' outta time but preaching to big masses
Sanctifying a mind of a lost atheist bastard
Covenants of the woman that's battin' her eyelashes
Blacked out the aesthetics I'm grabbin' a whore faster
Retract and attack of the motherfuckin' master
Servin' an hors d'oeuvre of blood, pain and disaster
Painted a perfect picture of bodies gettin' disfigured
I started off with a pen until I'm slicin' the cartilage
Cuttin' yo body open like a fuckin' cardiologist
I'm just an epithet with an appetite
Not a mothafucka that another nigga wanna aggravate
Hand on a blade, it's shaky whenever agitated
Not exaggerated it's factual when elaborated
I collaborated with the spirit of every serial killer
With a couple John Does that were found by the river
Just a few random thoughts you can find in my mind
The greatest of all time ah!",https://genius.com/Kaan-insomnia-lyrics

See I can read between the lines, let's call a spade a spade
I'm dealing with this bad hand, watch how I handle it
My wrist work like a sous-chef
My wordplay is Mos Def
Most definitely out this atmosphere, a black star that'll never burn out
Ooh, I like the way that sounded, never grounded, I be higher
I'm analyzing everything until they say my times up
I do the same shit every day now must a kid remind ya?
I told my story, gave it to 'em, I don't think they like it
I readjust to sound the same, we'll call it plagiarizing
Expand my mind to see it all, we'll call it visualizing
I want the world like Tony did, minus the complications
State your purpose, who sent ya, 'cause I don't fucking know ya
Cool as a polar bear, chilling out with the coldest shoulder
I'm trying to leave a legacy, you leave and no-one notice
I'm heating up, five hundred degrees; Wayne, New Orleans

Said do you notice?
I can't waste no time, I just been focused
Look me in my eyes, said do you notice
I live on a cloud, I just keep floating
I just keep floating

Some of us deal with the situations we stuck in, what
Living in misery, what
Exist in agony, what
I can't complain but I been better
Fuck it, my shit been butter
Dismissing these motherfuckers
No it's no love lost
These niggas is dove soft
Accoutrements to eat, accompanied like it's duck sauce
These featherweight competitors, I fly by
Flash in the pan, pot calling the kettle black as the hand that feeds him
Said I just keep moving, they all been stagnant
All I ever wanted was the Benz wagon
Whip it like I stole it, hit the better mansion
Money in abundance what I wanna have it
That's, not reality, still
Struggle daily is real
It's complicated I feel
But my emotions concealed
Hold them close to my chest
Let them release in this breath

Said do you notice?
I can't waste no time, I just been focused
Look me in my eyes, said do you notice

I just keep floating",https://genius.com/Kaan-notice-lyrics

Biggest fear I got is regret

Ain't no tellin' if my wounds will ever mend

Think that I got it, perhaps

I'm in the zone as a matter of fact
Carry the load, put it all on my back

Got no time to be stressed
Ain’t no time to be pressed except for pressin' forward
Pressin' the pedal, push it to the floor

Overtime, fuck the extras, I'm goin'
Keep it movin, no, my pace never slowin'
Pay attention on this ride that I've chosen

You know where to find me
24/7, isolated in confinement
I ain't got the time to sit around with you
Got too much on my mind, too many things to do
I'm plotting on that peace of mind, I keeps it tight
I'm plotting on the benz with rims, I makes it fat
I'm plotting with these flows and rhymes I makes it snap
I'm praying that we blow, but let me make it known
That all I do is work homie
You know where to find me
24/7, isolated in confinement
I ain't got the time to sit around with you
Got too much on my mind, too many things to do

I'm obliged to explain how it is
Now with this pen that I grip
I rips the page to bits and pieces
This beat is bumping
Believe that the bar has been raised a little
I'm feeling the pressure
Never the lesser I lecture & lead
I do this with ease, now please
Don't make comparisons
Parallel to a parody
Based off your ignorance
All of that surface listening
Casual listeners can't even hear me I guess
Been going crazy lately trying to find the source of my stress
I'm insecure internally, proceed with my lack of success
It seems to consume all my thoughts til I can no longer see
As I fade away from the memories I repressed and reveal 'em
I'm concealing all of my feelings and spill 'em on instrumentals
My temple is a conundrum, can't be bought for no lump sum
Some of us reach the summit but most of us plummet
I pray for you that it is the former and never the latter
Overlooking every shortcoming like they never mattered, what it do?

I'm praying that we blow, but let me make it known

I coulda been one of the greatest but why do I hold back
And it's so sad, that I'm hopeless
But I've chosen to be locked in, to monotony in my day to day
I can't make a way, I'm feeling stuck
I been broke as hell I don't give a fuck
I'm just giving up on my lost dreams
I can't bring it back to those bright days
And my happiness, it just fades away
I don't feel safe in those short times
I've been second guessing all my steps
As I regress to my regrets
And I digress with this dialect
And I'm in effect for the whole ride
Been wide awake this whole time
Ain't no wool on my eyes
I know the truth and I like to speak it
Won't lie but they might deceive you
My procedure, I'm never preaching
I wrote the gospel if you don't believe me
Take your chances with the other side
Good luck, I hope you survive
Everything is for everybody
Been about it but I tell a tale to take em to a place
That they've never seen
My mind is working in ways that it never has
And I pray it last for the single fact
I'm feeling and falling apart
I know that I could've been better
But maybe I wasn't prepared to conquer my fears

They said I do this for real
I say I got it fo' sho
I just set my attention on purity
Let me give my contention on minor details
The finer things that keep y'all complacent
I'ma case the scene
To keep a healthy distance
The prominence
Of my composition
Dismissed for instance
What I've written is a lyrical gospel
Strayed from the path I'ma lost apostle
I came with the wrath that I hold, a father
Fought foes, I ponder, God save the water
Wan't nothing more than real peace of mind
In my maturity, see I have realised
That if I do the work, my shit will maximise
Then I materialise, the shit I got on my mind
I don't thought, I sit, I think, meditate
And I'ma levitate and leave, a nigga better believe
That I really wanna get you with the proper style
It's not personal, it's just a part of the business
A deposition trying to pressure the witness
Flow get you high like narcotics
Wrote it in code like I'm speaking ebonics
A morgue is amore? to the form that I formally found
I astound with my sound, I'm astute with an additive
Gimme a subject I swear that I slay it
Come round the way with the shirk heavy slay 'em
But now this baby tryna find it's a payment
I keep it simple than y'all thou
Biblical water I'm sacrificing that's the best in the back of a fugal partition
Crawl like that abort a mission, completing the murder mutilating massacre with it



I won't exaggerate it, we got em infatuated
Now you in love with the cadence
Walk in a bit and I bet they vacate it, AH!
Working never on vacation, there's no relation
Bitch ima done like I made, all I need is warrant for the motherfucking regulation
Gimme me a second to cool off, I need a minute to move on

Yeah
Alright

So tell me right now my nigga whatchu want
Yeah
I sit in my room with a couple of blunts
Yeah, if I'm being honest then I was surrounded by lots of distractions
When it's all said and done I pray the lord can forgive me for all of my ignorant actions
What am I asking?
I can't believe in a deity that don't exist
And if I reminisce then I'm blessed with the clearest
Depiction of pain that some people are causing me
I was like ten or eleven vividly remember my father walking out to leave me
He would step out the door but then never return
So one time I was turning to something that you've never seen
I'm a literal monster that might make a massacre
Masochist and mastermind
I've been ready to die
If you took a look inside my mind and I guarantee that you'll go blind
What the fuck do we find
I've been living in darkness forever
My pen was never redefined
And I go back and forth in the system of psychoanalysis
Constant offender, repetitive felon
Develop a hatred of people
Possessing the same complexion that I see
When I look in the mirror I can't stand the image
Reflecting on everything I'll never be
And my mother's a fiend, I said my mother's a fiend
She been a user for years
And if I remember correctly
It was her addiction that made me a joke to my peers
And I'm making it clear I'm not longer a kid
Or a child, I'm a man that has run out of options
And I bought the biggest of pistols to pop it
At people I'm tweaking and see 
A victim, my seed and my future is dimmer
And bleak and if we ever meet I can never
Beseech, I'll besiege you with bullets by pulling
The trigger from thinkin' yo pockets are poorest
With pennies deplorable acable lurk
The committed and villain the venom up in nigga
Commended by givin' the spirt 
The hatred I have is inherent
It's oh so apparent that I wanted guidance
But never got that from my parents and
Paired with my confidence or self-esteem when I sleep
I can't dream I see too many things that are
Stunting my growth it's a constant regression
So I'm feelin' lost, abstainin' from everything
With the image that I have presented the people
Deseeded the pain that I'm feelin' it deep
But there's no pity party I'm starving so
I gotta eat it and I ain't seen my mother in weeks
And I mean if I did it was never that long
Come to think about life and the path that I chose
So I need to expose all my issues and
Get rid of all my problems that I am possessing
With prominence, people are breaking their promises
All for a piece of percentage they get
From repent is dependent upon if you
Feelin' the penance I live in depression I cause
A funeral procession my life ain't a blessing
This stress and austerity barely showing
Dexterity all that I wanted was clarity
Dare say the mind is a rarity really
Embarrassing, fuck it I just saw a nigga
That's walking and talking on a phone that
I can't afford and I seen him out my window
This is a problem that he cannot avoid
Cause I'm broke as fuck and I tired of feelin' stuck it's time
I pressed my luck I bet I put the pistol
Right between his eyes I make him feel surprised
To see his own demise
And what I should describe
A plan I would devise
So why can I survive

I breathe
Then decide

Devoted to what I am doing
Pursue the personal passion

I fathom many dreams and everything is serene
I seek to find peace a feast to find beats
The beast that I be defeat the mentally weak
Beseech by not priest
Depicting the realer vision is 
I said we never retreat but it’s harder to conceive
When you are doing the unbelievable and
Everybody is telling you it’s was never feasible
Agreeable i’m taking the road that you never travel
They baffled by what i’m saying
The opinion made it a statement
I’m working and never complacent
Complaining is for the famous
Explaining that i’m at the bottom and it's really easy to see

Deplete it every ounce of the emphasis in your spirit
The mirror image of relics
Accepting the overzealous
Expecting you to be jealous

Perpetuating the promise, see
A vision when i kick it
I got a different policy
Polishing all my attributes
To give in and get division
Flow is never deficient
Articulate when I spit it
Emancipation of lyrics
I'm tempted to make a symbol
For symbiotic appearance
And pairin' the realism
With symmetry in the sentence
These words they come from the heart
I departed from many centers
A sensitive sort of nigga too cynical to ingest
Attest
I'm one of the realest niggas to find, I live in the beat
You give an opinion I pick it apart
Depending upon it when I wanna stop
I do what I do when I'm better with rock
Givin' you passion I wanna stop

Triggered with these weak ass bitches, nigga never that

Devoid of this

Say you feel the way I feel, I'm sorry but I don't believe it

From the things that people done put you through
But it is what it is
And I really can't call that
I'm playing with the cards I was dealt
And I'm way too proud to accept any help
But I know motherfuckers gonna do it like this
When I'm down, I could never get a lift
But the moment that I really wanna quit
When I finally realize that nobody ever really give a shit
'Bout a young motherfucker with a dream
To revive the pride that's inside
He can no longer vie with a prayer for the soul
But it's already died
FUCK
 x2
Don't believe in my dreams
I no longer live with a passion
I've asked the lord to forgive me
For wasting all of my talent
The spirit that I possess is polluded by insecurity

 by reality, my predicament worries me

As I pray to jehovah
I swear I feel like it's over
My positive  evaporate as I elaborate
All my mental stability really should be evaluated
Salutations from my shallow grave
But look at the mess that I made
 living the fame
I murder the [
?
] and the slain 
I'm painting a picture of pain 
I'm knowing you take it to vain 
I said I was never regained 
The feeling of being defeated defining the fears 
A finding that wouldn't appear 
The smoke in the mirror 
Pray that I'm making it clear 
Hear the people that talking a lie 
But never they know what they speaking about
I guess that the way that I spit it 
My lyrics are making them listen 
I'm giving you everything that I got
My honesty wasn't a shot 
That's all in it what you could find 
You hiding your hideous lies
And living a life you despise
I'm wasting my time
By taking my thoughts out my mind
And putting them right on a page
I'm truly insane
But that was the one I could blame 
They wanted a sec in the game 
But never refrain
I guess I was really a strange 
You live in reality something you see is the norm 
But I woulda never conform 
Just giving it different form 
The flow is a door 
My spirit is torn 
I'm pausing to give you a minute to mourn

No Sucka MC’s,UnKnown,2017.0,"Yes lawd
Knowledge, nigga
Ah, look

Tell Kato imma need about a few more beats
Tryna tell the mothafuckas that the kid don't sleep
You can do this shit the way that I do it I don't see
I'm sacrilegious with the lyrics I'm a different breed
To break it down I give you elegance to kill it with speed
Backpaddle, no I never took it up another level, let it breathe goddamn it
Make sure they can understand it
Motivated I am more than them, I bring it to the forefront
If you got an issue I can bring it to your doorstep
I never fuck around with these cowards they looking dormant
I try to play their songs, when I listen it sound like torture
I can never pay attention to the listener that's torture
You do this for dependence and the ,  ass backwards
Most of these rappers are part-time
Separate I leave them out of it, 
I can do this with my eyes closed and my hands tied
Ain't no competition I should win this by a landslide
Sickest motherfucker breathing, I kill it they started grieving
Greetings from the other side, it's looking better from where i'm at
See I elevated like I put this in the high chair
The flow is hella random, my patterns done match the hi-hat
But nothing really matters I'm apathetic and overrated
Double dose of dope and I slip and slide to the precipice
Remediate rappers, I'm known to make them leave the premises
The premises and proclamation, boy I set the precedent
On their way to my decimation, control of my destiny
It's simple - I'm a poet, you a piss-poor artist, make it evident
I’m in the minority of intelligence, the rest of them
Are in the majority with the negligent
Was in the voting booth, i'm writing Eric B. for president
Left doing donuts in the parking lot, playing Paid in Full till the CD skip
My middle finger out the window, watch me wave it to pedestrians and average-ass peons
They all live pathetic
Born in a shittier circumstance, I refuse to accept it
I’ve been venting on these records with a reckless abandon
Treat it like a cage match, I'm the last man standing
Call me Jimmy Superfly Snuka, coming from the top rope
Tryna get some fun, make it double tell them pronto
Win this Super title like I’m Peyton with the Broncos
Got the last laugh like the kid, been the blanco
Talking to my nigga on the phone that night
Reminisce about the ones that thought I wouldn't be shit
But I stuck to the plan - no deviation
Roll a couple ciggarillos - high aviating
I'm a patient motherfucker, shit I'm used to waiting
I been studying the game, and all the innovators
Go a hundred miles an hour, with no moderation
I just thought that I could see it, that's an observation
Closed off from the world, I work in isolation
I could bless you with the truth but you ain't ready for it
I've got them hooked on my shit, we leave them better for it
I never once wrote a line about driving a foreign
'Cause in reality I'm broke and I cannot afford it
But if I could, then I prolly would write about it
I'm no better nor worse, and they put me in the dirt
I'm a man in a flaw, but the flaw's in the verse
Won't flock with the birds, I'm in tune with myself
No one does it on their own, everybody got help
With a little bit of funds and the focus ascertains
Speak it all in existence, the real no fiction
The fact that I fight then lie to addiction
I'm distant and different
Depict of my visceral vision
Is viscous and vast like the last of addictive

They don't seem to see the vision
I don't think they'll ever get it
They don't seem to see the vision

Focused  I've been all about the work work
Bless you with the real for what it's worth worth
Can't deceive me, I've just seen the light light
My intents are past the shining limelight
Corny rappers never get no play-round
Us will take your tape and slide in playgrounds
No procrastinating, I wait to play mine
Time's the last thing i am tryin' to waste now
Focused I've been all about the work work
Bless you with the real for what it's worth worth

Said I been feelin' like the whole world
Watching from afar, don't wake up

I want to like the lovely the things I bring
The light we share is something never seen
I pass it off to you in your due course
My time has run it's course, the dream is lost
The rising weight it feels to love the day
My reality has past the point of vague
A fatality to what my mind believes
Close my eyes and take the time to think
Alive and well, it's very nice to be
With the endless possibilities I see
Who the hell am I to disagree?
No, who the hell am I to disagree?
No roof or ceiling, stuck inside a dream
No limitations, life is but a dream
Feeling vindicated, trying to live a dream
With the world staged in parts to play a king

I get lost inside-side
I get lost inside my mind
I'm, lost inside a dream
Stuck inside a dream
I live inside a dream
Addicted to this thing
I can't quit it, but they'll never get it
Who the fuck am I to try to tell you different
I've been looking for insight, I just go blind and my mind do the rest
Articulate my vision under duress

Valley Of Pain,Abstract Art,2015.0,"Yeah. Uh-huh. Lawd. Yeah. Uh-huh. Aight

All I ever write about is pain
And all I ever write about is pain
Nigga I done went insane
I don't know what's goin on inside my brain
All the fuck I ever write about is pain
Nigga I done went insane
I don't know what's goin on inside my brain
All the fuck I ever write about is pain
Nigga I done went insane
I don't know what's goin on inside my brain
All the fuck I ever write about is pain, Lawd
 (x2)
I walk through the Valley of Shadow and Death it protects me from all of my enemies, enemies, enemies, protect me from all my enemies

Lookin at the muthafuckin mirror feeling worthless
A purpose upon this earth I ain't earned it
I'm disconcerting myself with the irrelevant
Developin a passion of visionary to grasp it
Necessarily askin
Literally the masses, could never really fathom stories that I imagine
Based off of events that really actually happened within a nigga life
They momentarily trife
My desire to be better than many serial killers
I'm sicker and iller but never vanilla
The nigga was movin at a fast speed to teach you a few things
Got a new routine sharper than a guillotine
Decapitatin my confidence
I was stating the obvious
Every lyric anonymous
Sorry for being ominous
Harmonizing with synonyms to make a sentence
Like a citadel for the omnipotent
Your ignorance is impotent
I'm sick of this  to what I've been deliverin
Gotta tell the truth I don't care if it's inconsiderate

And all I ever write about is pain
All the fuck I ever write about is pain
Nigga I done went insane
I don't know what's goin on inside my brain
All the fuck I ever write about is pain

I don't know what's goin on inside my brain

I walk through the Valley of Shadow and Death it protects me from all of my enemies, enemies, enemies, protect me from all my enemies

I been the way that I can never make it by force in the forge it terrified
They lies are more gorgeous
But how these muthafuckas went from a technicality to prayin on the people, supplying many a fallacy
Like everyone that raps got a million dollar salary
Well, actually admit it tell the word that's our reality
The saddest part about it is frauds are celebrating
Cuz you was buyin an image that every nigga was sellin
Created by evil people that focus on demographics
The shit was really wild and none of it even matters
They make it about materials; gotta have a distraction, wit diamonds and ya chains and women shakin they asses
Why stand for something when the people never need it?
We should make a couple records that you considered conceited
Believin in what I'm leaving, the bag of bodies around me
They drownin and feeling lost; a rebel without a cause
So I should kill em wit kindness
Instead I get em wit venom
A lyrical literal miracle nigga that's a 
I got a bigger vision I'm giving it wasn't miniscule
I'm looking for the knowledge that a nigga never found
I'm astounded, but I would never take in vain and I prefer to explain that all the fuck I ever write about is pain
And all I ever write about is pain
All the fuck I ever write about is pain
Nigga I deal wit insane
I don't know what's goin on inside my brain

Stressed for a living

Hard to keep composure when your heart ain't even in it
Tell me how you keep it
Tell me how you keep it
Tell me how you keep it
Tell me how you keep your shit together when everything's falling apart, god

My mind been running in circles constantly
It's got to be the opposite of positive velocity
My head still in the clouds
Looking at stars, that's astronomy
While pondering powerful possibilities and beautiful soliloquies
The characteristic traits of the greats
Save me a place and a plate, and I'll say grace while you save face
You copping out, like copping pleas, appeased by your saving grace
These niggas talking beef but never speak when we raise the stakes
Cease to bring the heat and keep it moving like roller skates
Protected 'bout as well as JFK in the motorcade
I cascade over the grass knoll by a flagpole
Aimed at a moving target, hit or miss, at least I shot my shot, uh

They gon' complain about the picture, irregardless of who painted it
The color composition and the hue becomes irrelevant
Could make a masterpiece but they gon' point out the flaws
Applaud that it's off, and tell you how to do your job
Critics and heretics are one and the same, they hypocrites
People love giving opinions assuming you give a shit
I tune it out, I'm not attentive, no I wasn't listening
Thinking you could do it better well go 'head and do it then
Watch you fail, come back and tell me how that feel
These niggas blind to the signs, yeah they might need braille
And the gon' fold under the pressure, that ain't hard to tell, nah

This should balance out the lows
This a ballad for your soul
A premonition, not a song

How you go alone to get along?

You could really get it if you really 'bout it

Pay-per-view for the viewers to view it
Overproduce it, create the illusion

Power Outage,Subtle Meditation,2018.0,"I'm living free, but what's that?
I wanna be happy, I guess
I wanna be more than I am
You know, content with my vision
Less existing, more living
Try to be kind and forgiving
Stare at a page and paint this paper with pain
I promise it's purified
Niggas full of bullshit putrefied let it 
Tryna jump off of the porch now they petrified
I've contemplated suicide a million and one times
But every time I tried the only thing that I could seem to see, was my momma's eyes
Deep down inside is where this misery resides
To say I'm fine would be a lie
But through these lines I come alive
I'm sending praises from the gods, Buddha Jesus and Allah
The odds are stacked against me spark McKenzie grab the key and start the engine
I'm revvin' it up until it runs right
Run through red lights and stop signs
Done a lot in this lifetime
But I hope the next is better than this
This some repetitive shit
We in this matrix with a glitch
This shit a dead end ditch
The truth hurts when it cuts through and infects you
I'm stitchin' up these wounds with a needle dipped in divinity
Sex, drugs and rock n roll, the holy trinity
I hope you never mimic me
Or live vicariously through my imagery
No complaints but I got questions and they still unanswered
This shit is hard, what's the reason we down here for?
Is it really green pastures on the other side of that wall?
If you created peace and love, then why would you make war?
And if you made me in your image, why I feel piss poor?
Unable to articulate all of the strain on my heart
Deficiencies inside my mind, it's like I'm fallin' apart
Be careful what you ask for, you just might get that shit
And feel as empty as you ever felt, just a shell of yourself
Hallow be the name that I proclaim and exclaim from the highest peak of Jerusalem
Prophesied and then invented it
The birth of a king that's more than a mere human being
Exuding the essence of Frankincense and Myrrh and silver my nigga
Mercy, mercy me lawd

And tell me why you cut my mic off
Turn the lights on
Pressure squeeze like a python
Once the fight's on
Clock tickin' like a time bomb
Threw my mind off
Can't say I lost it
I been gone
Been a bit off
Waitin' for this reality to dissolve (dissolve)
But in the process, try to be patient, prayin' the pain resolves

This is life as I see it, from my seat at the coliseum
Fishbowl livin' fightin' for position
Prayin' that I get a piece or gain knowledge
Hard to survive when every single dime is trickle down economics
Gotta get rid of all that shit like a fuckin' colonic
Laid up with a free spirit that mommy nicknamed Kehlani-lani
Tsunami roll it kamikaze watchin' Toonami
Hit the blunt and poonani, nine times out of ten, I demolished it
Diggin' deep in the hole til I strike gold
My heart cold, but clarity comes right after I nut, then I gotta go
Hit the lights maestro, the magic's over, spell is broken
Tell a friend, tell a friend to tune in
This revolution will be televised and monetized
Incentivized by vicious times and double knotted mob ties like Lucky Luciano
Fuck a humble abode I want a mansion with two grottos
If I find the strength to make it to tomorrow

Why you cut my mic off
Turn the lights on
Pressure squeeze like a python
Once the fights on
Clock tickin' like a time bomb
Threw my mind off
Can't say I lost it

Been a bit off

Came to calm my conscience, that's divine intervention
I know he got me, that's some real intuition
I'm still stressing , tryna deal with my issues
Like, put it to the side when I ride by
Said I'm so high I could skydive
Looking at the ground when I reflect (reflect)
Murder any beat, it's a reflex (reflex)
Could go deep but I digress
My depths make 'em high step like a Heisman
My sixteens set scenes look like Sing Sing 
Nothing you seen, sign I see resound and siren

Man they found a couple bodies in a shallow ravine
And you left your fingerprints on 'em
They know you did it, it's definitely a go on three, on three
Said is you ready, no you wasn't
Man they buggin', why they think they buzzin'?
Couldn't fly away they said they even wanted
I'm a fly on the wall, I been peepin' everything behind the scenes

Cut that tape, cut that cheque, cut out the covenant
Covered in fallacies, don't it feel comforting
Concrete the contents, that conquest I conquer and cannot confuse what I do
With the average shit
I don't even wanna ball I'ma pass that shit
I don't even wanna skrrt, I'm a passenger
Nowadays they taking shots at the messenger
Shoot at me, I'm going out like John Dillinger
Make a massive mess and massacre
And these niggas suck like they first name is Monica
Lead by example, they all finna follow you
I paint the canvas with beautiful colors, bruh
I'm making art that's abstract seem cumbersome
You pay attention, bitch, don't be so cumbersome
I'm in and out of these lines like an ampersand
I gotta get up and go just like ""ándale""
Y'all gotta find me a way, it's important man
Never compete with these niggas, I don't, I can't
Never forget what I did, what I overcame
I'ma do me while they all overcompensate
I'm just focused, trying to stay in a separate lane
Eh so these niggas act tough
Oh they some actors
Better yet actresses
Talking that loud shit
Knowing damn well they softer than mattresses
We don't allow it

They rhymes I would design
They ain't get appreciated

Now fast forward, me
I'm on the same shit, you
Quick to change up, I
Still remain in the zone
You fuckin' right man
Pick it up
Get fascinated by what I couldn't reach
Don't give a fuck
Time's of the essence
It's not a luxury
I'm livin' my life with a plan
I never be seated, no standby
Givin' you more than the average, yes
I am a literal monster, yes
Herculean with the effort, yes
Feelin' the pain and the pressure, yes
Step it up another level, yes
Give it a minute to settle in
Really savage with the penmanship
I been a bit of a misfit
Accurate, I never miss shit
Ain't no fuckin' intermission
I walk away and they gon' miss me
I never leave until the mission done
You couldn't keep with the pay say
They gon' see they can't erase the price
You pay to reach your goal

The consequence, the frozen constant
That's constantly bother me
Honesty's a commodity

I love you hangin' around
We hit that lake and get down

Road with you, road with you
Would you mind if I stay at home with you
Home with you, home with you

Bible Verses,The Black Blood LP,2017.0,"I lay my head before I pray
If rapture strikes am I too late
And what can take the pain away
I'm just preparing for that day
I got my motherfucking dope on the side of me
I keep it low I got one rolled on the side of me
Them niggas know I keep it cold on the side of me
And even though I got no hope left inside of me
I keep it pushing to the death

Revelations, revelations, I can see it
It do not take a genius to be in agreeance
There's evil all around me, peace of mind are screaming
""Oh the rapture coming soon, relinquish all my demons""
I don't think that I'm mad enough
All praise to the most high, back it up
The bright lights you seek full of sin and nonsense
Bad transgressions affect the conscious
Came from the soul tell 'em check the content
The cross that I bear is for peace of mind
Now, either I was out of line when I wrote it
Quote the last scripture, words that I dive in
Kings to Ephesians
Hope the Lord hear us
Save and embrace us
Never forsake us
Lost in your graces
Love is amazing
Niggas eccentric
This an extension
Tension I'm feeling
Father release me
All I need is faith in this lifetime
Nigga let it go and let God happen
Focus I don't see no distractions
Niggas tryna be mad wealthy
I'm just tryna be mad happy
My pursuit has been a lonely one
Got me feeling like the Mad Hatter
Hatred, that's not in my repertoire
Love thy enemy and carry on
I'm like David in the lion's den
The Ten Commandments bitch I follow 'em

I lay my head before I pray
If rapture strikes am I too late
And what can take the pain away
I'm just preparing for that day
I got my motherfucking dope on the side of me
I keep it low I got one rolled on the side of me
Them niggas know I keep it cold on the side of me
And even though I got no hope left inside of me
I keep it pushing to the death

Lost souls, new views, still the same religion
Evil minds baptized inside a mental prison
The Devil talking to me, I refuse to give in
The Devil talking to me, I refuse to listen
As-Salaam-Alaikum eatin bacon with a bow tie
We was on our knees, sending praises to the most high
You was out here running with them dirty rats, sewer shit
Niggas lacking faith and wonder why they never doing shit
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
Away from all the foolishness
The rich are ruling this
In their hands are killers and hooligans
Blam!
Never really seen a motherfucker like me when I get up on the beat and I'mma hit em with the
Blam!
Young nigga been anointed, seen the void and vindicated, regulated
Ignoring all the temptations
Good Lord I don't see them
Bible said ""love your neighbor""
I don't understand the thesis
All I did was keep the faith, ho
All I did was stay the same, bro
All I did was never change though
See it all from my angle

I lay my head before I pray
If rapture strikes am I too late
And what can take the pain away
I'm just preparing for that day
I got my motherfucking dope on the side of me
I keep it low I got one rolled on the side of me

Try and think of shit to sever through this writers block
I done smoked too many blunts now all my thoughts have died
Revising every single line, I do this all the time
I'm just searching for perfection I can never find
Now either I'm, going crazy I can't call it
Grip on reality loose, look what we living through
Minds closed off like a cul-de-sac or a dead end
Indifference in opinions best to get in where you fit in
Tread the water carefully it's easy to drown
There's happiness and patience in this peace that we found
Hopefully you feel that we proceeding with love
Trust and please believe in due time we gon' make it happen
It's mind over matter, manually manifest all these fantasies
Do all the shit they said we'd never do my nigga and some
Continuation through the flagrant effort like it's AND1
Finish what we started but regardless we gon' always move

I'm losing faith in this world, could we converse more?
Empathy's a distant memory, it's now a folklore
Your fellow man's your enemy, the energy we see is hate
I don't relate to none of this, can't normalize it
Inform the feeble minded, rationale is deep inside 'em
Just peek below the surface, more to see so we can find it
We thinking outside of the box of the 4 walls of our own asylum
Tryna see this shit through your view
A deeper understanding, pull the layers back, I'm seeing more of you
Perspective's everything, I know the truth
We either high up on the cloud or free falling without a parachute
Shit, I'm trying to find the middle ground, I need balance
Patience and perseverance is becoming a challenge
We smile through the hard times and the dark clouds
Stand tall, never bow down
Tryna keep my level head above the water nigga, while I tread

Most of my thoughts are so manic they might derail my vision
If you sat in the seat I sit in you would see this shit much different
All I'm doing is existing, I don't consider this shit living
Delusional mental limits, solitude, got me in prison
They say karma is the result of ill intentions, shit if it isn't
Base's loaded, blow for blow, off'a the juice, swing for the fences
You gon' do what you gon' do so it's on you if you defenseless

Never let these humbling times direct my trajectory
Taken a couple of losses, the lessons was learned separately
Keep my eyes wide, analyze mental dissection shit
Please don't be surprised that I survived through all these energies
Paid your dues in tithe but deep inside you lacking empathy

Eh
Eh, lawd
Aright

Emphasize with the rhymes I
Wanna take it back to a better time
In the middle of an identity crisis
I gotta find a way as I prepare for the journey
But I been stressing, see I got a lot of worries
I need to perfect what I do
I'm obsessing over everything, I swear that that's the truth
There's no comparison to me, apparently I am the coldest
Focused and devoted
I defy 
a preconceived notion
I'm just waiting for someone to notice
We are working from the bottom, they don´t give no recognition to people such as ourselves
Lawd
Can't nobody tell me nothing different
I give a hundred percent as I take advantage of when
I invent the venomous rhythms
Arithmetic with the pencil
I'm quick as shit, where's the witness?
Now listen, I leave 'em all appalled
I'm more than gone, I'm mortified
So call the mortuary
I'm borderline dependent on the feelings necessary
This a brand new state of mind, I couldn't find it for a minute
Embody for my emotions until they can not exist
Now I'm convinced I'll be the victim by vindicating my conscious
I'm a complicated specimen, that explains why I'm unique
I'm too deep inside of the beat, it silently weeps
Tryna take you on another ride
Change the energy to make sure they can really feel the vibe
Switch the melody, I'm tryna bring this bitch up back alive
I tell the truth, I swear to God a nigga never had to lie
I rectify the right or wrong
Now ride along so you can understand
I'm functioning by forging a formative form, my peace of mind
I'm in a mode that's purely aggressive, graced with a crest
But progressive graspin' at theories, I leave to see it's illegible
They never learn their lesson
Don't take it for face value
Ain't no praise for the vague, I put attention on the pain
It's plain and simple if you ask me
Lawd, eh
Getting straight to the point, I got some doubt
Look, I'm not that optimistic
The position of a pessimist
I'm pressed to make it happen
We need this shit more than ever
Now it's my responsibility to step it up a level
Never falter these endeavors, I'm just dealing with the setbacks
Intact with insight
I said that we never would change it
I wouldn't ever conceive it
I said that we never retreatin'
Everything that we leaving
That's something you can believe in

Got it all on lock and down pat, nigga
With the sinister raps I just snap, nigga
But no photo op cuz I tax, nigga
Put the flow on swang, we got ‘em listenin’ mayne
That shit’s a bit of a pain, but yet a minimal loss that I been willin’ to take
Take, take, take
No fold or break and pump my brakes I can’t
This picture painted passed the litmus test
I spoke to God he told me never quit
These niggas speakin’ never sayin’ shit
I’m not complacent, souls adjacent to my maker, beneficial clearer conscience
Niggas choke like clear your tonsils, intellect of infant toddlers, missing fathers
Light the Ganja, calm my nerves and think a bit
The mind of a mad man trapped in this
But the time moves slow and it’s ravaging
Goin’ insane tryna master this

While these niggas change, Bruce Jenner shit

Ever had to walk a mile inside these shoes of mine

Sayin’ do it like I do it tell ‘em you’s a lie
See the reality I’m livin’ well it’s down to earth
I could bless you with some game for whatever it’s worth
Operatin’ at a level that you’ll never touch
I’m underestimated, overworked, and underpaid
I been zoned out, goin’ in, ery day, 24/7 treat the booth like a pulpit
Preach like a Reverend
Leave a mark to remember this
I spark with the penmanship
Man they all acting feminine
I’m lost in the melody
I’m a God with the remedy
Feel the pain in my sentiment
It’s evident I do this shit correctly
Make it all look easy like no effort to reach the peak proceed to do the extra
Stretchin’ for the finish, lookin’ photogenic, stupid mothafuckas never fuckin’ listen
Nothin’s overnight, this shit is repetition
What’s your definition of success and what do you suggest I do to get the shit?

Judas Issacariot,Losing My Religion,2014.0,"Oh shit nigga here we go again, I need to get in contact with my doctor
I got voices in my head and my mind keeps spinning like propellers on a fucking helicopter
This suspicious blood is ridiculous, cause everything a nigga give is conspicuous
From my sense of security fell to obscurity
Yelling obscenities, this is absurdity
Lyrical entity, envy thy enemies
Empty this clip till they trip off the remedy
Sing with this melody, my flow is heavenly
Demons in my soul are constantly tempting me
Living in misery, learning humility, spitting a plan clutching a rosary
All that I wrote is to sanctify savagery
Pain and some agony, death and disparity
Clearly I need to get my motherfucking medication in my motherfucking system real quick
I'm more columbine, with 12 concubines
I got concrete rhymes that'll blow a nigga mind
Shakespearean the way that I construct it
Call it Al Jazeera like it's mass destruction
I've come way too far with this Alhamdulilah
And my belief in God has been cracked with a flaw
As I thumb through these chapters, this blasphemous baptist
I'm stuck in a nightmare that you can't imagine
I'm sick of my pastor he's preaching salvation, just bury me deep so I'm resting in peace
I eternally sleep with bouquets of carnations
Roses and posies and blood colored daisies
Mutilating my wrist going through phases
Nobody noticed that shit was amazing
Bitch I'm bipolar and borderline crazy
My father don't care, I swear that nigga hate me
Now look what the fuck you done done to your baby
I guess that I'm everything that nigga made me
I am what I am, what I am is a shame
The fact that I'm bearing this family name
Realizing my father and I are the same
See these apples you birthed they fall far from the tree
Now Chris rolled a blunt at the age of fifteen
And Kevin's a dick, a literal prick
I hope that you die you son of a bitch
I would give you the shirt off my back if you ask
When I got on that roof and I busted my ass
And the day that I quit you just pointed and laughed
Now you forty years old and you broke with no cash
I refuse to put limits on things that I have
But my life ain't defined by the things that I want
'Cause I wanted to kill you I ain't gonna front
But see then my nephews wouldn't have them a father
Consequences of my family drama
Fuck that, ain't no more lines being dedicated to these motherfuckers I hate
That refuse to acknowledge calamities caused that I'm dealing with everyday okayyy
Now a nigga 'bout to get technical I'm more mythical, spitting a pristine vow
I'm like Tyson my vices are killing me slowly
I'll burn all my bridges in this allegory
Disgusted by lack of compassion to man
The root of this evil is seated in wealth
Won't do for another what you do for self

Please let me, do what the fuck I gotta do
One time get a line refine what my mood
You could say that I'm a smooth young poet
Can't lose I know it
I could try to differentiate the love and the hate
The real and the fake
But either way I'm lost in a daze
I've been accoupled
Not accustomed to comin' up with apologies
The policy is prophecy the way that I like it
I'm on a whole 'nother train of thought
For my peace, no sleep, can't breathe
Make 'em cease I mean make 'em fiend for the feel
Til the cup runneth over, devoted to my art
The heart, I can't find it
A fault to the man, I do this with no help
I done built it from the ground up
Expectin' a couple losses
I'm mostly silent, don't approach me dawg
And I refuse to trust a random such-n-such
There's no sabotage and everything is on the up-n-up
It's all work, no luck, they don't get it
Live my life inside the image I presented to y'all
There's no mistake within the ghost cuz I know what I want
A misinterpretation and they base it off of a lie
But a fallacy is somethin' I would never supply
I try to keep it all together, but the evils divide
I needed somebody to speak with, I'm talkin' to God
A conversation that contains the kindness and love that I really need

Lost on the path that I

Homie I just wanna find a way
Cuz I have lost the will, I can't maintain through the madness
Minimize the negativity inside of my soul
A cinematic type of picture from a vigorous mind
But call it veni, vidi, vici I defeated a curse
Worse off than I was, I cannot do this shit alone
I sacrificed my happiness in the hopes I can receive
A return on the time that I gave to this
It is immeasurable, I know he counted the hours
I constantly work as I search
But I'm certain I've seen the signs
Tellin' me that I am headed in the wrong direction
Down the one-way, duckin' and dodgin' through the traffic
I swerve and I merged, immersed in my pity
But the only thing I pray is that people never forget me
And accept me for the man that I am
Gotta make 'em understand that I'm playing my position irregardless
I take my tone and mix that with emotion
Let's make it original
I been that bastard they never seen
A descendant of slaves that were hangin' from sycamores
Swift with the swing as the wind starts the breeze
The blood that drip down on the leaves that still blossom a strange fruit
See the evil that man do
There's no one left to save you
Try to run and hide, I hope you find a haven
Better way to heaven
Heavy heart you carry can't be healthy for you, gotta move on

Would I be happier than what I am now
Instead I'm broke, livin with my hands out like a charity case
I'm in a marathon, nigga it's a hell of a race
I can't keep the pace
So imma try to keep the faith that I can actually attain
Everything I ever wanted, but I'm not talkin materials
I never really asked for much, i don't have expectations, nor reservations
Stay realistic, I just want respect from my perspective

When y'all couldn't see the vision, y'all couldn't see the vision
Y'all boys act timid, y'all boys act timid
All talk, no livin', all talk, no livin'
That's a motherfuckin' limit, I could always tell the difference
Between the real and the fake
Ten to ten I'm up, no sleep, don't stop
Broke no more, I do believe, my God
Feelin' like I'm Eazy-E: Ruthless
Buy or sell we will proceed, just trust
Bye and large there's no-one quite like us
You ain't never really brandish it
Boy, you barely even manage it
The flow sick, might damage ya
Then man-handle ya
I see you need bandages
Too many songs about trap and the bandos
But you ain't never really seen one, no no no
How many times can they hit you with the ""Okie-doke""
Before you see that it's bullshit, oh my God
Good Lord, I'm back, I feel better than ever
Bitch I'm a king, the young Nebuchadnezzar
I took the time to get my shit together
Got through the pain and I'm still here
Y'all been stagnant like stillborns
I been on, and fuck that I'm movin'
Fuck that I'm runnin'
Fuck that I'm sprintin'
Fuck y'all don't listen
Fuck yo' opinion
My attitude has been reckless
I'm knockin' goals off my checklist
You let your life go right past ya
That's something I cannot fathom

You say I should fall off, I should fall off
I came through the front door on my own stuff
My name, what's the hold up, what's the hold up
Say my name, what's my name, they gon' know before I'm done
You say I should fall back, I could never leave
When I am done I guarantee I leave a lasting legacy
There's no way, there's no way, that's what they say to me
I want it all, I want it all, everything they owe me
I let it fly
I let it fly
I let it fly

Straight caution, I'm a Martian
Me and K.A.A.N on some bar shit, no nonsense
Everyday makin' songs, makin' waves constant
Kinda late on the knowledge, get to moshin'
Pick your play on some pawn shit
Better aim fast
Bet you ain't killin' like this
Got a lane, swerve and don't wreck
Gotta maintain, no less
Wanna give thanks to the man
Shot a bang bang bang full clip
I done made plays no rest
Hundreds in the bank go fig
Nothin' but a thing when you gotta go big
Wanna throw fade, wanna throw fists
I expect those by the boatload next
Imma throw show by the po-po's crib
Imma stay woke 'til my old soul ends
Imma lay low makin' dope songs hit
Please don't make music for random approval
Just man up and do it, you can like aluminum
I am not rude to them, I can make do with them
Idolize you and them, I don't mind goin' in
By the fall, honor man
Got a ball, shoot it in
Got it all, better win
Catalogue never ends
Not at all understand
Got a plan, write it off
Get a pen and jot it down, I'll listen to your innocence

You say I should fall off, I should fall off
I came through the front door on my own stuff
My name, what's the hold up, what's the hold up
Say my name, what's my name, they gon' know before I'm done
You say I should fall back, I could never leave
When I am done I guarantee I leave a lasting legacy
There's no way, there's no way, that's what they say to me

I.F.L.D,UnKnown,2015.0,"Stress, Knawledge
Let's do it

Lately I've been looking for myself
I'm just trying to find some happiness
Wish I never lost my innocence
In the middle of a sicker struggle
I'm dependent on a different feeling I can only find it with a milligram
And Imma need some more for my tolerance and
That's way higher than my confidence
Became introverted I don't speak and I can't sleep I been so stressed
What if the plan do not pan out?
All the time that I'm putting in
Wasted energy upon the dream and I can feel the fate as I begin to flow and I have been sedated for a couple months cause I am too depressed about a lot of shit
Life ain't going like I thought it would. realizing I'm a lost cause,  pray to god that I can find some peace I need the recipe you know the formula to get a normal life
I stay isolated can't trust a soul I don't feel love its like the only ones that ever cared about me these different drugs so I choose to use them I mixed them up
I need variety and I'm an outcast of this society with no 3 stacks and no 
Lucius left
 just loose morals and a ton of pain
Platency that I can never change start the fire Ima let it burn feeling low I know I need help
Headed to a safe place, can you relate to my predicament? I'm in vicious cycle but it never ends I might get clean for like a few days
But Its a constant struggle I need strength, I dont have faith, and I'm insecure a self conscious man that feels agony I can't fill the void in my fuckin heart But I'm terrified and I'm paranoid, I know I had the choice of positivity and my potential was a promiscuity but realistically
I am a weaker person persecute the soul I execute the purpose of my self destruction I don't have a conscious in a constant battle
But its mentally I need to find a better outlet lost in the dark space damn!
LAWD
Talking about the pain that I repress I'm in mutual relationships everyday, and I've been living straight by addiction but they can not understand the reason why I do it. I am feeling like everyone else is against me I carry a chip on my shoulder as long that's holding my head to the ground but I'm lower than ever
It never gets better I bet they maintain I'm the perfect example of wasted potential Not to mention all of my opportunity's are passing, can not commit to sobriety prior to pardon my etiquette, we make it darker to see what the message is affirmations alegated repetitive pacing myself on the why can't I and I do it, I come for oblivion I'm covering agony Masterpiece that was inspired by Misery living my life and I live for a muse, focusing something I like at the the moment
I'm vulnerable I am a loner insisting I see what it is, I get the sense that these people are fake, I'm disconnected I have No emotions
I'm heartless I've started to realize there is no hope. I am inspired by nothing I notice the smoke in the mirror's the sight of the sober
The flight that I'm on it was artificial, disappear into disparity , and everything that we are given is realistic it's depicted inside of my mind the minute I think half of my thoughts I'm moving on salutations from a better bond
I do not feel like the person I was or I used to be I know my purpose is gone, pray that I can become mentally strong I'm holding on but I know that I'm finished
Empty inside man I need to replenish, I said that I'll quit but I'm back on that shit and I sit by myself feeling disappointing but it's really pointed that I'm pointed out
Conversations with nobody else, at my lowest I sincerely know it I'm a lotus flower in the concrete Dirty pedals and a crooked stem but when I needed friends
Man I could never find em so I find my reality when I hallucinate, losing myself I can not get a grip of my self esteem man that no longer exist",https://genius.com/Kaan-ifld-lyrics

No cosign and no vouching
My head been where the clouds is
Your heart been where your clout is
No you ain't really 'bout this
No you ain't really 'bout shit
See, I'm picking up where I left off
I shoot my shot like a sawed-off
Playing the game like I really want it
Never fabricate I tell the whole truth
This incessant style is innocent
Eat the beat like it was Venison
Veni Vidi Vici when I speak
Ineffective how these niggas be
Insufficient been the fund status
Lord forgive them for they don't know
I never stall, but I starve for this shit to work
I ain't never had any opportunities, I just had myself
For what I saw was independence, not no regular work
I'm not dependent on no man
Out here living like nomads
Passed the point of no return, there ain't no way I can go back
To live how I used to
Safe to say I got used to, all the shit that I dealt with
Singular thoughts got me looking at me
In the mirror, I don't like what I see
In a mural where you feel immature
Take your time so you're not premature
Enjoy it all 'cause it could fade away
Who knows if it's permanent
Get through, tryna penetrate
Make it special, make it resonate
Build something from the ground up
It's all you, they could never take it
Life's short, try to live it baby
Be you and appreciate it
Focused, what I must be
It all ends so abruptly
It goes quick nigga, trust me
Won't stop until I reach the peak
Of my creativity
Wasting time, no I can't see
I'm a critical thinker
I vanquished all of y'all
The champion status like Ali
Muhammad as salaam alaikum
When you step in my ring
That Boom By Yay be like a drum
There's no alaikum salaam, you
Get choked, smoked or revoked with a dose of this rope-a-dope
Make 'em double dutch from my wordplay
No response, you ain't worthy
I wasn't aware of you but I know you already heard me
It's levels to this shit, so get rid of your pride and ego
No weapon formed against me shall prosper, my shit is lethal

What a life so phony
I might lose my cool
You just take it from me
I got nothing left for you
What a life so phony
I might lose my cool
You just take it from me
I got nothing left for you

Excuse me can I pick your brain a minute
I mean I usually think yours tasted different
You paint a picture full of fame and women
But they don't recognize your name on Twitter
I got a problem with the lame pretender
Y'all are puppies bitch, you claim your litter
You tippin' change at dinner
Your hits just ain't been hittin'
You claim you hang with winners
I seen them on the benches
You need to call up Denny's
Get you a job that's paying
Flippin' the sausage maybe
(Flicka-da flicka-da wrist, baby)
Rap game, Charlie Day
Act ways, awkward save
Say you got bars, hotter than a match
Played with Roger, shouts to Federer
I guess I let ya burn
You learn the best is earned
You heard the rest don't work
You heard it right, boy
I heard the lecture first
I felt the pressure burst
Call it a night, boy

What a life so phony
I might lose my cool
You just take it from me

I'm playing my cards the way that they was handed
I'm raising the risk, taking the rest
Double the work when nobody won't help
Ay don't doubt me nigga, doubt yourself
Ay don't hate me nigga, hate yourself
Ay we love greed, we love wealth
We love lies, we love death
We ain't shit, I attest
How you rest, how you blessed
I'm distressed, I've been pressed
I confess, I'm a mess
I take the pain and compartmentalize
I told my story, the struggle minimized
I paint a picture, my vision maximized
I got some money, my problems multiplied
Which way to go, I don't know, I can't decide
I ain't been home in like fifty-'leven nights
Reincarnated, been here a couple times
Too much pollution, I couldn't see the signs
I need a light, pass me the zip
Show me the way, I'm not convinced
I'm on the fence, falling again
Follow my gut, never a trend
Man of my word, until the end
I play the back, back, back, back

So many ways to reiterate it
And nigga we was never celebrated
Even with the shit we cultivated
To be honest, it was an obligation
Contracts and payments, backstab relations, at a loss for patience
No exaggeration, my imagination got 'em fascinated
Niggas wasn't fucking with this shit
I had to go and handle my business
Can you tell that I already been this, sick and persistent
Reject and deflect what a nigga don't need, yeah I been resistant
Really resilient, literally brilliant
Cracking the ceiling, back of the building
Back on a mission to make 1 billion
And we gon' get there, yeah Lord willin'
Check my resume, if you like
Matter fact, go double check it, if you like
Safe to say I'm on another level, bitch I'm high
Everyday the reaper calling, it's alright
Tell them niggas I took destiny and then I manifested every single thing I ever thought
I could go out today and it would be okay 'cause my spirit is straight and my karma ain't off
I ain't want the diamonds, the glitter, the shine and the shimmer
Want none of the shit that y'all on

I take a piece of the flow
Switch it up and try to give you something you ain't never seen before
The reason for the rhetoric to rectify the right
I'm feeling righteous and decisive from the lyrics that I've provided
I've been working like nigga with a baby on the way
A 9-to-5 with terminal winters with the way that I kill it considering my alliance is literally imaginary
Very necessary to give you an honest picture of a nigga that was speaking and reeking of any ignorance
Influencing the movements and proving it's an illusion
Refusing a view of reality
Never acting erratically
I'd rather be a rapper that's really giving you logic
I've elevated my elegance
Emphasizing my energy for better resolutions solidify it with empathy
Maximizing my effort, working for the restitution of all of my ancestors
A proposition of sentence and acquisition of image to get acquainted with sinners
And quietly I acquire the fire so I require attention at all times
As I defy with desire
I've integrated intelligence to find an ideology
Defile an instrumental and never give an apology
Ironically the music I've been making is contingent on whether people will listen or if I can stay consistent, persistent
I've been determined, depleted but not be defeated
Lord forgive me for my sins I know I said it in the past though
I was never perfect, impervious due to purpose
I promise I'll take a pen or a pencil, put it on the paper
Depicting the way I'm living to show I'm not feeling hatred
Degraded by your incompetence
Never giving a compliment
Reminisce in the moment so we can live with the consequence
Always try to be honest
If your intentions are positive then anything is possible
What the fuck is an obstacle?
An optical illusion, I'll make it cease and desist
And I believe if I continue to write a record like this
And focus on what I been saying make sure my shit is legit
And write until my hands are aching and breaking, no longer gripping
The bigger nigga was using
Amusing never deluded
I prove it to start a movement
The reason, never confuse it
I could activate my artistry to aggravate an activist with acrobatic words
Superb, my flow is accurate
I'm looking for the truth with a masochist in an asterisk
I'll make it astronomical
The shit's hereditary inside of my every molecule even my head follicles
People are fucking followers needing justification
They only show us support if the situation is similar
Send them a simulation I write in syncopation
And if I run out of patients I play a different position
Enforcing your opinion is minimizing the mission
I give it an intermission to put you into submission
These niggas acting submissive and timid
My shit is limitless
Intended for the tentative
Never sounding repetitive
Created every record for a certain demographic
I demonstrate it with poetry
Acapella composer, I keep it in mediation
I'm giving you innovation
Divulging the information while praying and meditating
I'm making it for myself when I feel the timing is perfect
I purposely put my life on the paper so you could judge it
Or analyze what I'm saying to start a major discussion
I focus up on the rhythm, the symmetry of percussions
The beat is a heavy banger
My punches coming in bunches
So by the time that I'm finished the track is sounding disgusting
I started the renaissance with a residue from the revolution
My only solution is eliminate pollution
I'm doing it for the love and what I get from the music is soothing the way to deal with my heavy substance abusing
And I'm murdering every record
Impossible to confuse it
And if you come to the funeral, closed casket or viewing
And I told them I wanna focus
I feel like I'm about to lose it
I said I'm giving my spirit, my soul inside of this sound
No need to look any further, the music is all inclusive
This motherfucker's the truth with a crucifix, hallelujah

I said, uhh
A nigga don' t think about much though 

Ah came in with a motherfucking attitude
Do I really gotta say the way a motherfucker feeling
I’m a villain tryna make a fucking killing I'ma get it
Lord willing as I pass these margins, and
Pass these bars in between these pages
Paint a picture of pain for the people to proposition with a
Confidence for my competition, they’re gonna need that
Ten years from now bet a nigga supercede that
Never seen that, tell me where the trees at
Motherfuck that, nigga tell me where the green at

So stressed out gotta go and get a weed sack
Get a cigarillo, roll it up my nigga ease back
Feel the wind breeze, we under the weeping willow
From adoration of fortunes of war to cover up poor shit
For astronomical portions from Maseratis to Porsches
To realize that nigga gorgeous, time is flawless
This is just a reminder my nigga
I care less about material living back in there starving like
You moving for designer my nigga please
The incite that I write is ridiculous
Receive it in your mind, it’s a blessing that was given
Or a message that was written from a nigga that was living with some suicidal tendencies
Running wrecking religion I
Try to goes in, but my flows off
Pay attention when a motherfucker rapping All Eyez On Me till a motherfucker doze off, ‘fore a motherfucker goes off

I’m just, letting my pain get exposed on a page at ridiculous speeds
The fastest of rappers that you’ve never seen
Angelic technical constantly deemed
Realizing this life isn’t all that it seems that you
See in your mind while envisioning dreams
You picture pristine, a perfect serene
As a person my purpose is murdering mind
Powerful, potent, legitimate lines
Soliloquies written I’ve hidden in rhymes
I’m offering poetry, looking for signs
I’ll make it I swear bitch just give me some time 
Don’t say shit to me bitch I’m losing my mind
Stop, can a young nigga come with a flow so dumb
Like a semi-automatic tell I'm finna let ‘em have it
Point it at your demographic, I cause panic and havoc
This barbaric jurassic velociraptor of rap is running the game down
Placing talons in your backbone
Rhymes hot enough to change a pussy nigga melanome
Cancerous tumors for you consumers, call it melanoma
Mesmerized by the size of the thighs on (Malona?)
Somebody call Pam Grier

Full speed down hill watch a nigga go
Floating round like Icarus until I burn out

Weight off'a my shoulders, lightening this load that I keep
My biggest strength or fault is ambition
Second guessin’ questionin' every step of the mission
Instead of enjoyin' the ride, I visualize the finish line
A lifetime flashes in front of my eyelids
These random thoughts inspired by the hybrid
And we stay on the move like some migrants
Just tryna migrate and elevate to what’s next
That’s success in excess, my feet set, no seatbelt
But this stress can get the best of ya
To where you’re feeling lesser than your potential
But that disappears ‘cause I notice that…

Shit it is what it is, yeah we still go
Only focus on what I can control, I know

Finding a lane and staying in it but still adjustin’

3 For 1 Special,UnKnown,2015.0,"Now tell me what the fucking problem is
Knowledge got the information, debate with Sigmas and Kappas
Decapitate the cadence, case closed 
Shake foes and I box 'em in in
You guys are monotonous
I try to be positive, my mind is a monster bitch
Demonstrative and negative taking ominous toxins
I'm tired of talking, I'm tossing my temperament
Off of tariff while tearing beats to bits and pieces
Proceeded to a sovereignty state of mind 
Fragile but yet he's magnifique, manually motivated
I'm reeking of fecal matter, grab some baby wipes and pampers
Boy that means I'm the shit
Got a urethra full of Ether, poisonous when I piss
And I'm accurate, I never miss
I dismiss 'em quick when I'm torching it
Correlate with a few from a destitutional view
And what I do is dominate like my name Ndamukong Suh
I pursue, consumin' the coon that was cool with kickin' some ignorance
Cut the head off of a thief that was stealin' in front of witnesses
Leave 'em in disbelief as I mutilate you 
If I cease in seizin' the moment, I'm sure attention will leave
And intent is to see me falling' in autumn on top of leaves
I mean jeez, just let me breathe
They criticizing my creation
Case the joint like I'm  before the conversion
Merging and swerving in traffic, this man is attacking
The flow is a trap and fuck all the tactics
Disintegrate your distractions
In fact I'm quick to react so you have to pardon my 
With these rapid fire raps that you couldn't wrap your mind around
I got a solitary  but I'm the sickest, I'm profound
For what I found is that I'm bound
I'll elevate, I'll never drown
I'm livin' high until I die, I'm in the sky, my nigga whaaatt?!
Bringing the rhythm, I swear that I do
 (no, no)
Tellin' you once and I say that I'm nice
I bet that I'm ready to (go, go)
Give me your life and then give me your money
I said that I'll take it in front of your face
I'm runnin' around in a race
Who keeping the pace?
You niggas are lookin' disgraced
I bet that I'm takin' your place
So why you givin' me all of the hate?
Come back like MJ but that's minus the 45
Levitatin' over water like Christ or Marty McFly
I, feel like I'm barely alive, alive, alive
I, feel like I'm barely alive, alive, alive

I prefer to tell the truth instead of living a lie

I'm a poster child with postpartum depression
K double A to the goddamn N

In the front of the 47 behind the bodies in the trunk and
The cop light flash but I hit the gas
My nigga fuck that shit I ain't going to jail
But when I'm put inside a cell, then it's in restraints
So then I hook a left but then I book a right
I think I'm lost oh no, but that's hindsight
My mind ain't right I'm manic-depressive
Tried to kill myself but that was excessive
I guess that it came from internal aggression
I can't get a therapist, oh so expensive
If I told a story it would be extensive
I pray to the lord and I call it repenting
In terms of addictions I know I'm dependant on different drugs that I can do myself
I'm all alone, a young silent soul
I want to serenate , save and sanctified
You want to verify rhymes with no compliance
But I counteract it with the concentration
And salute the Führer with the firmer plan
I want to purify, , and purge the land
You know gentrify, and try to clean it up
And get the Riff-Raff the hell away from me
Jody Highroller in a fucking noose
And I attach the rope to a sycamore
And I'ma sic ya boy, I got no remorse
I cut some more, they cussed galore
Accustomed to, abusin' you
You black and blue, it's more than true
So warn your crew, no need for truce, I chuck the deuce
Then grab a casket, pick a basket
I'ma basketcase, can a nigga think?
Better understand I'ma the man and a beast
I'm a crazy motherfucker that's comin' out of the verse
When I murder you with the verb and that visualized pain
But it is what it is, and you know it, lawd
I can't believe that you're really impressed
All of this bullshit I constantly hear
'Cause you playin' a rapper that stole from somebody
That rapper they stole from had stole from somebody
We are all derivatives, I am aware if it
No originality, it's embarrassing
When will they see this shit, nobody studies it
Hip Hop is Pop now-a-days and you loving it
Guess that I'm , I roll with they 
The next time you see me, the scene will be seedy
I seem to subdue while confusin' the greedy
I really don't get it  again
But I'm usin' my pen as a means to an end
And these niggas are talking, they say they the best
But nobody has yet to come close to Rakim
So  there is room for the growth
We should focus on that and stop doing the most
'Cause there isn't a title I'll work to attain
I just wish that I wasn't alone and insane, fuck

I told them all there's no chance
And I warned you all in advance
I don't plan to scramble for answers
My temper's like Eric Bana
Start panicking when I'm pissed
Persistent as pistols that pop, I insist, I insert the clip
I cock it and call you a prick while I'm picking off plenty victims
They playing possum, I spot 'em
One shot, I gotta reload it
The street is coated with blood
I'm an animal anticipatin', patience paying off
I'm pacing, praying, pardon me as people pass a pity party
Okay boy, let's get it started
Time to harvest all my hatred
Hasten statements, case in point as I depict with pens and pencils
Taking power, tower over weaker races
Not complacent when I'm writin'
Bite my tongue, I never do it
Got a purpose, I pursue it
I'm the truth, I thought you knew it
Oh well, show my skill
Feel this field is filled with fakes
It's fuck 'em all, can't trust no snakes
I navigate, elaborate, this labyrinth, a masterplan
Pastors came for donations
And passin' collection plates for his Monte Carlo 
The congregation debased
They see praising God as escape from dilemmas and tribulations
Attributing to the pockets of Pontius Pilates and demons that profit from all they problems
I promise that a nigga gon' switch it
I'm on it when I murder every witness
I  never tell 'em my business
I  with the way that I 
You talkin' but you never really lived it
Read a random chapter from the bible, screaming Hallelujah
Askin' God if he exist and if he do it's nice to know him
I just want my sanity and happiness, no Isotoners
I'm a loner, constant struggle, my depression will consume me
Soon to be a 
For the fact I fucking snapped and slapped a  for talking back
Attackin', take the heart from them
They lack the arsenal to win
An arsonist with narcissistic tendencies and temperament
Could take your soul and terrify it
I defy with all my rhymes, and they align like constellations
The Milky Way's mighty spacious, Orion's Belt is my spaceship
I follow the drink and  it, and quench my thirst and my hunger
I'm longing for something more so can some one send me a sign
'Cause I'm really having a difficult issue dealing with time
In addition to the attrition afflicting me in my mind, fuck
I can't breathe nor think right now
But I'm making the most of the time that I get
If I live like I did when I cut my wrist
Then I just might trip and you don't want that
I black out and do some things I don't remember usually
I used to see the world as a beautiful organism
But that was in '96, I mean shit I was just a kid
I've convinced myself that it's hopeless, I'm well aware that it is
I can feel the Devil, he's screaming, he's coming right at my neck
As he offers diamonds and cheques
And he tells me that they'll respect all the fucking art I create
But man I refuse to accept it, I'm not a vessel of hate
I'm just venting upon these pages
Apparently people feel that my poetry is preposterous
Probably pressing play and applauding when I am posthumous
Generation of followers, only fuck with the popular
Problem is that this populous glorifies the demonstrative
Dominate, I'm a deputy
Destitute with a debutante
Destined to be indebted to  many credit cards
E.B.T in amenities,  Benjamin Franklins
Frankly I'm a man of sin
Medicated with medicine
Mescaline for your Majesty
Maddeningly, 'cause I casually
Murder beats in this magnifique
Manufactured for listeners
But nobody is listening
Stand my ground, I'm not giving in
Top of the game and I bet that I reach it
You ain't fuckin' with me so why are you speaking?
This shit that I spit is ridiculous, yes
I give a fuck if you're really impressed

Catastrophic when the wave start peaking

Riding in a hatchback, tell me where the cash at
Think I get too high, pussy nigga you lie

(And uh-huh and uh-huh) x5
Lawd. Yeah. Aight

This is a tangible product I pray that you could feel
My pain's become the centerpiece; The part that makes it real
I reminisce what I repress whenever writing records, I'm feeling depressed when I play it back and then I assess it
I been obssessin over all the causes of my stress and lord forgive me for my sins I swear I never learn my lesson
Confessin I'm losin faith and I say yo name in my rhymes but I'm really just savin face I feel I'm fallin from yo grace
What is my place in this world? I know I'm worthless
The pain that I present to these people; Do I deserve it?
Deserted from destitution
I'm far from mentally stable
They threw me inside of an institution to find the resolution
But I was lost in the cause if you want a couple illusions
Never definin the music
Find it amusin
What do I see as my muse? The beat that I got to abuse
You better believe that I'm telling the truth
They wanted the real, so that's what I give and now they in love with the lyrics I spit, shit

Yeah
I'm hopin for an intervention, lord, make it divine
I need a sign
Lemme know if I'm wasting my time
If people follow me I pray I never lead them blind
I had the right intentions when I attempted to free they minds and sooth they soul
I'm giving them something that you could relate to
But I woulda never degrade you
Givin you everything that I have; My heart and my soul; My pain and my love
I guess that was all the above
But who do I trust? And when can I turn? And when does it end? I'm really concerned, Lawd
Will I survive? Is the question I'm always askin I know you blessed me wit talent then cursed me with insecurities currently writing this in a corner while contemplatin: Do I even wanna live? On the daily, I been debatin
I had a dream as a child for a while but it was evasive within a moment it faded I felt I fell on my face and I really wanna be happy, estatic, even elated but I'm just stayin sedated terrified I'll never make it, Lawd",https://genius.com/Kaan-la-la-la-lyrics

See i got nothing but love for ya, that's all we spreading to em
I swear i can't complain feel like i'm highly favored
I've seen compression the press forward pushing myself applying pressure from every angle trying to cover my bases
I'm making sure we straight over time as i double check it don't get it twisted like you chubby checker
I'm tryna, see the world on a tour bus double decker'd upper echelon no regular with no one next to us
Me myself and i on some fly shit refuse to act like refuse to act like i'm apart of some basis we breaking ties
Never saving face for the sake of saving a lie its the truth and the truth is real so that's all that we serve to them
Independent i'm on my own while they silent subservients hydroplane when i write it the way i curve with the cursive assert my services separate lyrics should serve the melodies i'm more concerned with messages than memorizing how i feel
This is real no cubic zirconia a flawless diamond in the rough Dirty Diana princess cut a standing ovation round of applause they need to give it up
Leave them severely scared like a scab if they ever pick at us
That last line wasn't deep but i bet it still connected or hovers over your center lobe like a head dress
And holy matrimony  pull the vale up and see your future i passed the litmus test on every level leave me lone
I need space every beats a peace of cheese cake ill take a pickers dozen handle business never delay for peat sake i'm regressing to my old ways press the pen to paper i'm preparing for the long race
A marathon if you will i got the stamina endurance to endure a deplorable situation
My steady need to believe
This that Oh La Oh Veto!! There go that sound again
I've realize its not what you say but the way you say it my epiphany cause its not the game its the way I play it respect is everything don't you ever forget
You need to get up get out and get something (uh, huh)
You need to get up get out and get something (uh, huh)
Don't let the days of yo life pass by (Oh, Nah)
Don't let the days of yo life pass by (Oh, Nah)
Don't let the days of yo life pass by (Oh, Nah)

Now keep your eyes on the prize and never take em off it
Marginalize every win and learn from the loses
This game is risk and reward but i'm never wary at war i'm unorthodox my rapport is rather brass and incredible
Autobiographical lines they more than legible pushing on this underground rail road feel like Harriet Tubman moving on a speed boat my main next post is moving into yo geographical grid
Coming to a home near you god willing true spilling all up in yo jaw when i fill it
No anesthesia needed my procedure is quick yo vanity facetious and pretentious you dig
I think we got it on lock but we could always improve gotta excel and succeed sold separately
Ya lack of attention to detail is revealing to me it says one of two things your a novice or lazy but baby
They they either blind or crazy i guarantee that ill make it excuses are for the week or the faint at heart but i'm neither
Refuse to be like all of these has-beens they had it at some point but lost it awhile ago
A lack of preparation is the reason you fail no one to blame but yourself when you fall and never get back up
Just keep a level headed focus but don't ever give up

And even though you ain't my blood, you like my closest kin
Before the money and accolades, you was my only friend
Forever grateful, you were the only one that I would ever depend on
I know I lose track of time, I know I ain't hit you back
I know you think I changed but I'm the same, that's in full effect
A phone full of missed texts, I ain't mean no disrespect
So before you tell me 'bout myself man just let me interject
It's like no one can recall when I was broke and starving
Back when I would pray for better days and bright tomorrows
I ain't no fool, I know this time we living on is borrowed

No more than a human being
If anything's possible why we stuck in this living hell?
Why cops killing niggas and then remain free?
Administrative paid leave to help relieve the stress
Leave the bereaved to bleed and starve there to defend themselves
Desensitize our minds
Normalize the savagery so we become accustomed to it
Useless all this falls on deaf ears
I pray it never does
Hopeless trying to find the light
Hopefully this sounding right
Singing like I'm Donny Hathaway
Half the way out the window
Falling
, playing K-Dot and Jay Rock
Talking about ""Money Trees""
Woe is me
Hope I see brighter pallets
Colors and poetry
Master composer, he held his own like he was supposed to
See, you ever wonder why there's have's and have-not's?
While the have's have what the have-not's need
The hunger pain inside your stomach like you ain't ate in weeks
You feel it deep inside your soul, it makes you mentally weak
Enough to drive a man crazy, change his mentality
'Cause ain't nobody trying to starve with a family to feed

Gospel of Mark,Losing My Religion,2014.0,"I know a pastor with a Bible & a crucifix
Religion's a disguise
I can see it in his eyes
Niggas preaching you the gospel
But the devil is a liar
He can lead you to the well
But I bet that bitch dry
10 percent of every dollar
To your local tabernacle
Collection plate spinning 'round
Two times in the service
Can I get me a receipt?
My Salvation’s tax deductible
I'm still givin' money
I been broke for 'bout a month or two now
Hallelujah Sunday and sinning on Monday
The red-eye to hell, a nigga only going one way
Obsessing over fashion and your false sense of worship
Don't even believe in God, you're just praying for a purpose
And refuse to ask questions 'cause your soul has been invested
And they're still segregating
Preaching Nate from Old Testaments
From what I understand that's the White man's rhetoric
We're tied to the South, Klu Klux & Confederates
Complexion of the Savior that I praise is tan licorice
Enslaved West Africans then turned them all illiterate
And call them all niggers and make them think they're the lesser
You abducted us from a land where we was kings & professors
Welfare's a manifestation of slave labor
And dependency upon the government from taking handouts
????
Put them in Section 8 so there isn't no way to stand out
Unless they on the corner selling poison to their people
Then you throw them in a jail
The population same color
Niggas see a cell mate with skin tones of his own
Industrialize the prison
Turn it into private industries
Years for petty charges
My people living in misery
A nigga twenty five with a record full of felonies
Was raised in the system so that's all he really know
Institutionalized minds, we still living in slavery
And fighting over shit that we can never even own
An educational system of a third-world quality
Then wonder why my people got the highest rate of poverty
The land of the free? I think that's literal hypocrisy
And fuck the constitution, that's just an idiosyncrasy
The words ""pursuit of happiness"" scribbled by slaveowners
Malt liquor for your liver, no longer an organ donor
Fastest way to kill a people is diminishing their minds
Give them drugs of different kinds, good grapes from a vine
They choose to procrastinate and waste all of your fucking time
Fuck getting educated, niggas getting medicated
Popping pills like they vitamins
Oxycontins & Vicodin
But don't forget the weed and make sure that the odor's pungent
We living in a society that praises over-indulgence
My generation's either locked up or on the substance
These niggas lack focus, always into dumb shit
I practice what I preach and watch the people that I run with
The truth is in my rhymes, that's divine & sublime
Coming directly at your face like that officer's mace
So get the fuck off of the couch and stop waiting on a meal ticket
Rap game full of ignorance

My nigga, had a dream but he killed that off
Left it for hoes goals and rose to battle his foes
Went toe to toe and blow for blow with the best of them
Not talkin' body shots but powder that they turned to rock
It’s pound for pound the dopest nigga 'round
Got control of the town holdin' it down
With the iron fist Tony Sparks can’t compete with this
Fishscale retail for sale yea they love his shit
Never hit or miss cause one hit will have you seein' shit
Hallucinate and vivid the picture painted
Like stained glass window frame it a billion's the motive
It's easy a million touchin' it weekly post a parlay in the meeting
Resided over linguine all his accomplices greasy
Olive oil slick, dirt-bag shit
The type to take a dollar from from their mother when he need the shit
Egregiously surrounded by these evils
Wonderin' well, where in the hell Jesus is
Discussin' company growth and expansion
Expandin' the reach like growth spurts
To touch every inch of this Earth
On this illegitimate search for the wealth
Them dollars help but you cannot live with yourself
Cause your conscious weighing you down
And the load’s too heavy to carry
But you’re already married to the bullshit
Til death do you part and you can start again
For now it's foreign engines and women with ill intentions
In a different dimension where your survival’s dependent
On vicious acts of violence you gotta handle your business
Hit that nigga you came for and let his family witness
In the back of his mind  hoping his creator isn't made of
The fire and brimstone they preachin' in them vengeful passages
But fuck it man, he passed the shit on I-95 in an i8 with 4 passengers
They passed the undercover in the cut with some shit in the trunk
Enough bricks to build the biggest building and make them a killin'
So much cash could stack it from the flo’ to the ceilin'
Stretch from wall to wall inside the section 8 apartment
Dogs are barkin' blunts that they sparkin' filled with the fire
They got 2 exits to go before they get home
Playin' that new what's his name yah that rigamarole
But when that pace pick up
The speed gettin' quicker
Them lights flash from behind yah it's over nigga

That karma kickin' in like yah you fuckin' owe me nigga
So it's time to pay for your sins
Come to collect on that Benz
Oh I guess you thought the good times would never end hmm

Before the car crash is don't nobody love him

Some might tell you that I'm cold
I'm on a search for my soul
And everything that I'm owed
The devil's lurking, I know
I guess the love faded, it's like it wasn't even there
Is it the drugs maybe? They got me high in the air

I've been on this hopeless quest, no GPS, like where the map is?
I've been on the road to zest to ease the stress, to all the madness
Matching tempos and tones, just trying to make sure they're straight
There's no balance, just repetition, same shit everyday
I hope you never follow me, I'm still unsure of the way
See I'm no better or worse, but for whatever it's worth
You can do anything you wish to do, you don't have to be miserable

Knowledge, nigga
Cliff on the beat
Pay attention

This shit is not for no amateurs
Go put my life on the camera , camera
I'm tryin make me a movie
I can only tell the truth see
Nobody did this shit for me
I don't make excuses I just make it happen
I got to much on my mind it gets harder to focus when I feel distracted
This shit is not for no amateurs
Go put my life on the camera , camera
(2x)
I demand your respect
All I want is love and the check
I give a fuck if you think you're next
This shit is not for no amateurs
Go put my life on the camera

Pick a different artist don't compare em to me
Apparently they're parakeets now they will try to repeat
I make a point let them see it
They can never reach my level
That's another lesson learn to better take it to hustle
Part of my power when I pass through
Manifest every thought is what the man do
You looking at me like my nigga how are you feeling there
I can switch it up and try to bring the vision back
I can make them realize I got a sicker vibe
You want a story and I'll be giving you the whole truth
You look surprised that they ever let the boy loose
I said i'm moving on the beat they see he keep it real
I can never do this shit to get a record deal
I just want the recognition that I never have
Why are you giving me opinions like I asked for
Oh I need some more stamps in my passport
Boy you know I got to work cause i'm that boy
But that shit don't matter
They watch me climb up the ladder
I missed a step and I fell
Flat on my face I feel like I fail
I can't prevail
All of these vultures around me
They just want a piece
Please keep your hands out of my pocket
This shit turn me bitter
I'm praying for death for the rest of these niggas


Difference in the way I deliver a message
A metaphor, mortify , I'm more then fine
I told a line , but what I find is that they are all fake
You motherfuckers approaching me in the wrong way
I told them once that I don't care about a single soul
Niggas are looking at me but I doubt you really know
Bitch I said I'm playin' this and  get and go
And all are you insistent gotta pick a role
Came back up in this motherfucker two times
Got me feeling like a poet , Nikki Giovanni
Verify a lot of vices that had no advice
I'm operating like i'm Isis I got to blow
They want the realest of niggas that ever did this
I dismiss 'em all with the skill but they want a melody
But instead I give many very mast potential
A whole lot of pain coming out a nigga pencil
But if you ask me that shit is so instrumental
At least to the process it leads to the progress
Believe that I could be what  I want
Even though these niggas told me I couldn't make it
Never hesitate but I made a way
I said I will always will
It's like I never feel
I'm just emotional-less and fucking heartless

You don't do what you say you do
No, I don't know what to say to you
Don't know what to say to you, say to you

Tell me what the fuck a niggas asking for
And when I get up on the beat I'm going back and forth
Gotta attract the flow
I'm like a matador
Never surpass the bull
I'm nothing more than equal
I stay broke with my bills due and
My time spent in this day job
With this nine to five
No I can not survive, it's like I'm barely alive
And every time I try
I just fall flat from a set back
What they call that
Woke up in the motherfucker like I need all that
Hold up, decline
Bitch you better run that again
I ain't even got no motherfucking ends
With no money I can spend
With the time that it takes to get dividends
Dippin' in and out of my savings
Until it gets down to the last few cents
Don't make no sense
I can never seem to pay my rent
God damn it but I'm back up on it
Microphone fiend murder any fucking opponent
That's ever opposed I know what a nigga pick appalls
Divulging but I'mma never be the one to give away the secret
I keep it for the people that would need it
But not for the ones retreated
And traitor is leavin'
I've never been up appalled by the treason
The only other side of jealousy is the reason

No, I don't know what to say to you
Don't know what to say to you, say to you

You can never really understand me though
I spit it quick to try to give a nigga antidotes
Another question I ain't even gotta answer for
Defending the purpose to find out what the fuck I need
To progress, impress as I proceed
To be the illest motherfucker that your eyes ain't seen
My nigga I'm obscene so what the fuck you mean
Your negative energy giving people you can believe
I wanna get it like nobody ever got it
I wanna strike it while the irons still hot
You envious of the plot
And you hoping a young nigga would stop
Praying for my down fall that wasn't really a shock
I'm the dopest motherfucker that's alive
Makaveli in the flesh
That'll let you get revived, I despise
The fact that my generation was deprived
From a different vision I'm officially comprised
You will not see my demise
But the times we living we don't really for forgiveness
I'm working with the tools that I got
Trying to manifest a dream
Everything ain't what it seems
I want a beautiful scene
But the situation I'm currently ain't serene
What the fuck I gotta do do make sure I'm really supreme
Dedicated to the craft
You understand what I mean
It's the passion and pain of the love of it all
With the focus I have I'm praying it never dissolves

I gotta go and get it

Straight Face,UnKnown,2019.0,"Man I'm a motherfuckin' alcoholic
Swervin' left and right when I drive
A ragin' drug addict, fiendin', jaundice, both of my eyes
I came home with 20 grams, but woke up to a .5
Like Brandon's barely alive, and man I think he just died
I took tablets of cyanide for a silent night like the Sabbath
Woke up in a pool of vomit, then quickly vacate the premises
Stumbled down the steps while I'm not coherent and non-compliant
Slapped the shit out of a silly bitch while preaching non violence
Grab her purse and car keys, take her phone, put my number in it
Told her call me on her day off and then I skate off
""What do you do for a living?""
Tryna OD is my day job
I went to college but they kicked me out for simple stupid shit
Like stabbing my professors and slipping bitches some Rufilin
Voices inside my head is where this fucking evil's rooted in
One man that does the job of twenty, hooligans and mexicans
Like fuck it, mask on
Lucha Libre that's if we wrestling
Then fuck it, mask off
Yeah, this danger is a prerequisite
I'll let this settle in like sediment, sunk to the bottom man
I do the dirty work and rebound like Dennis Rodman man
While y'all recoup and regroup from taking ""L's"" like Mrs. Rodham
My best friend's a Klonopin
Kinda kind but I'm kinda sick
Connoisseur of the contraband, constantly crying for a fix
First I'll start with a gram or two but one turns into 36, then 36 turns into 72, you get the picture boo
This my distasteful brew, disturbing news like fagots sending nudes
Am I offending you?
This feces flow is fluid, I'm the shit
Facetious bars you spit, I'm not convinced, I don't believe you bitch
I'm just a nihilist, force feeding you Niacin to heat your shit up 'cause it's lukewarm
I use your mixtape as a coaster to sit my drink on
I'm using you as an example of what I could never be on
I use your bitches face as a place I can sit my dick on
Fucked her then I sent her to the store to get some Backwoods
A pack an hour later, Strawberry Fantas and Frito Lays
She dip, I'm running through her shit
I'm out before she noticed it
The Pope and Anti-Christ mixed
I'm one hell of a contradiction
Sending salutations from somewhere private, experimenting
Prehistoric evolution, T-Rex to a salamander
Meaning rappers used to be monsters but now they basement dwelling, brand selling, peddling, boiling
Made products, like it's Pelle Pelle
Check the tag, if I don't see no logo nigga I'ma blast
Fire on that ass, go 'head with that trash
Smokin' that sufferin' succotash

I punish you with intellect and interject
I'm feeling vexed, I'm very stressed
It's been hectic around me
Drowning in a
Puddle of sins and sorrows
Seek a brighter tomorrow
But nothin's guaranteed for time is borrowed
I lead and never follow
Feeding you the toughest pill to swallow
That's the truth, now tell me how it tastes
When all my tracks are laced
I rarely leave a trace
I hit you with that boom bap ratt
Backpack shit and you lovin' it
This the ark of the covenant
Come and see the professional
Non-susceptible, highly legible, Mr. Incredible
I devour the beat like its edible, I'm conceded
All these rappers are liars
Your lines are fucking facetious
Taking this generation and turning them into fiends
Can you explain what it means to be 25 with a dream?
Searching for inspiration, all I see is a barrel
And I've been struggling lately
By myself, no one gives a damn
It's hard to change the world
When all that you have is a pair of hands
The situation is destitution dilutes the energy
Now it's just negativity rolling off of my tongue
Take a hit of the blunt
And proceed to cough up a lung
See, I've been searching for wisdom
Through words and for what it's worth
It's the pain that's holding me back
And I find it hard to relax
When my train of thought is getting taxed and attacked
But that's in the past
And I maximize my potential
By masterminding this manifest
Though I am manifested with my message
They don't believe me
I'm supplying the real that is seldom given
The subtle revision for revenge
That I verify when I vent
As the temperature starts to rise
And the reason becomes apparent
My music blasting and blaring
The system about to break
With Toonami on my tv
And a blank stare on my face
Like I'm lost in another world
And preparing for impact

Untitled,UnKnown,2017.0,"Yeah
Ah huh
Lord, knowledge, yeah
I said who's that now
I feel alone, I let my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind

I ain't even got no options I just hold it down
It's been a minute since I felt the way I do now
I can feel the groove now
Right back in the pockets of these records like I used to be
The restless nights, I stayed up
Wondering would this pay off
Second guessing my first thought
We all gotta learn
But in return, I received a valuable lesson indeed
Patience is something that you need within this journey of life
Don't get it twisted at all, I drain y'all's negativity
My tendencies are A-1, undeniable garçon
Unequivocal champion, channeling positivity
Undisputable view of perfection through my soliloquies
I wish that you could see the shit like
I
See I set my sights on something great I let my mind achieve it
All the time that I've invested feeling lost
Believe me
Oh lord, don't leave me x3
All y'all retreating, this worlds deceiving I can't believe it
The devil is alive and well he lives inside of some of them
I somersault the serendipity to find my happy place
My habitat's of isolation might cause my unhappiness
I hope and pray the holy hands that help me never go away
Won't you stay with me, won't you stay with me

Won't you stay with me, won't you stay with me

Nowhere to go and
I said who's that now
I feel alone, I let my mind move on
Nowhere to go and we say, hold nigga, never stop

I can't root for disaster, I roll up a Backwoodswanna 
On bastards to bask in the back of a coupe
What a beautiful view, father forgive me for sins
I complicity know what I do, now I must tell the truth
I said I must tell the truth
Nothing in this life is free, what the fuck do you mean
I got no damn expectations, my heart I wear that on my sleeve
Now it's torn and it's tattered, my blood turned anemic
I've just turned the corner, forgot all my demons
Can't hold no grudges, I just hold the tempo
I can't make'em wait please don't leave un momento
Like wrap this shit up, real never manufactured
We've brought it back I'm the one like the prodigal son
We was in the back in the cut, nigga we was never acting for them, but ya'll was acting for them
Them niggas acting like they had it for real
Them niggas acting like they had them a deal
Them nigga's acting like they off of a pier
I guess they added up and had it for real
See I was focused on the signature feel
I've been mobbing on the move I be, I ain't worried about a thing, not a negative thought

Risk taker, you mistaken

Look, ain't nobody safe around the boy
These games they play, I'm not familiar with
My apathy is actually an art
There's not attack and nowhere to be found
But when I speak so my speech is profound
A precursor to my verbs and pronouns
The way that I work with a soulful dope sound
I got it myself, no-one I owe now
This shit real, I swear would never hold out
I'll explain, it might just take a moment

Can't ride no wave, I get motion sickness

I'm fucking lost, I'm feeling off, it's kinda odd that life is hard,  this is
Stuck in limbo, I can't move, but there ain't much that I can't do
It's not my fault, I just can't lose

The meek receive the world that we inherit
The system's built against us, that's apparent
The path to righteousness, it's hard to find it
The pain consumes, the hate and anger's blinding

My apathy is real

Cause if I never do the numbers then you wouldn't notice
I just don't fuck with anybody detrimental floss
You niggas think I'm really dumb I heard and seen it all
Everybody down to ride until you really need 'em
I separate assumin' some'll see the signs later
I'm vacant and fast
But the vast amount of these people
Are poorless within they efforts
I remember when the shoe was on the other foot
Now please, put yourself in my position
Then sit and see for a second
It's a soulless journey that I chose to take
A lot of selfish sacrifices that I make
I missed my nephew's birthday just to work in L.A
I hope that shit pays off, feel like I'm going insane

Yea, look

I got a whole lotta stress I needa get off of my chest
I put my pain inside the lyrics of my songs
People tellin' me to slow it down or change it up
Or make it more repetitive so everybody else can sing along
So quick to tell a mothafucka what to do
But you ain't ever done it
You ain't even got a plan to show a nigga how to run it
Your opinion null and void
I need a blessing from the lord
I'll be the sacrifice repenting for us all
Goddammit I'm appalled
Appalled you would ever try to compare me to one of these niggas not at all
Goddammit I'm appalled
Appalled you would ever think that I would ever follow in the footsteps of these frauds
Goddammit I'm appalled
Appalled people buyin' into ignorance as if they couldn't see it's a facade

Second comin' resurrection of the real, a pussy nigga better bow to the God
Goddammit I'm appalled

Just give me a minute, I know you feel it
Depicted a composition exquisitely how I kill it
Dismissin' the opposition disintegrated they purpose
My dissertation of verses I've written in 3rd person
Within the times that we live in it's easy to form opinions
Assumin' they're not pursuin' the vision of dissolution
What you view is my reality or my current predicament
I'm livin' like a realist my future is far from limitless
But hold up, now don't nobody do the shit that you do
You comin' with the flow and you gotta know it's unusual
Amusin' when you murder the beat in dirty attire
They circle and form a cypher for stories like campfires
My desire is to be dope, c'mon homie we know
Prophetic not pathetic, you feel this in your libido
But goddamn nigga that's a shot below the belt
And my knuckle will break the buckle
Your self-esteem start to crumble
Accompanied by your pride
Now divide by your inequities
Imma call it incompetence, agree to disagree
I'm indifferent towards a compliment
Consequence of my confidence
Givin' you my disdain and my pain, I paint it with potency
Plus a picture of poverty
Penetrate with pathology
My policy is honesty
I gotta make it evident
A sacrificial vision
Repent and makin' it prevalent
Repressin' memories of my misery with a sedative

Peter paid the Piper with plenty of pennies
Dependin' upon the pity of people is problematic
A savage I've been sedated I'm saving all of my energy
Embedded existentially. a phenomenal entity
I'm feelin' like a phenom, lyrics for you to feed off
I'm barely standing on my own I'm not someone to lean on
My generation lost so I'm writing for predecessors
Impressive as they assess that you should play this for your fetus
These niggas send repetitive sentences through your speakers
I see this shit as egregious and actually facetious
But if I keep at this pace and the page is emaciated
The pain is alleviated the story abbreviated
I could try to break it down maybe go a little slower
Why tell 'em when I can show 'em
As I display my devotion
I'm divi-ing up my time as I'm tappin' into your temperament
You compliant with hatred complacent within your head
It takes an Ill-er type of a nigga, make you reconsider
Fuck what you deliver, call me Jack the Ripper, body in the river
I can make 'em all believe me, ain't it easy, up the ante
I'm hopin' you understand me, I'm plannin' to be a legend
My lyrics are indirect as I'm interceptin' your ignorance
Glorious nigga isn't it, I've been tired of your fidgetin'
Affix your fascination an actual castration

Eh
Eh

I just put one in the air
Think I might roll up again
Can't get too close to the sun
Burn out like Icarus did
They tell me ""stay on the ground""
I tell 'em ""it is what it is""

Applyin' pressure like a vice-grip
I don't think they finna like this
This that shit that make them sober up
This the terradome
This a cobra-clutch
This an upper-cut
This that rapid-fire
Don't get caught in the middle
The writin's on the wall, this shit ain't a riddle
So who's involved if I cannot tell the difference
If time is money then you should pay attention
I'm trying to elevate a couple of inches
I'm tryin' to be more than just out here existin'
They say it's a waste while my pace is consistent
I been face to face with the demons I lived with
The star of the show but my light isn't dim-lit
You can't compete when your shit incandescent
I'll give you a minute, a second, to get the message
When you're ready, I'll wait
Movin' at 100 miles an hour, full speed
Like I'm on the highway
Out of sight, out of mind
You know I been in the zone, in a different mind state
I put everything on the line, so in time
And I'm hopin' that it really all-

I just put one in the air

I tell 'em ""it is what it is""

Deep Blue Sea,Subtle Meditation,2018.0,"One false move and you might trip
Yeah you might slip, fall into the traps they set
It ain't a game if you thought it was
Nigga they ain't playing fair, how you think they won?
You better keep your eyes wide and your mind sharp
Keep your head on a swivel when you at war
Leakin' blood in the water with the great white sharks
It gets crazy in the dark especially when you got no heart

No love, my soul cold as a icebox
The pain wore me out like a carhartt
My paranoia kicking in, the only thing I feel is numb
I don't trust my mothers sons, I don't fuck with anyone
Think I seen too much, think I done too many drugs
8 hits of acid buggin' out in the hot tub
Fantasize, bout nooses round my neck until I breathe less
My sanity's on recess
All I got is regrets
All I do is regress
You can say I'm depressed
Drowning in the deep end, strugglin' I can't swim
Swinging for the fences but I'm feeling like I can't win
I make the same mistakes over and over, and over again, damn

One false move and you might trip
Yeah you might slip, fall into the traps they set
It ain't a game if you thought it was
Nigga they ain't playing fair, how you think they won?
You better keep your eyes wide and your mind sharp
Keep your head on a swivel when you at war
Leakin' blood in the water with the great white sharks
It gets crazy in the dark especially when you got no heart

My manuscript and memoirs reads thus
""Here lies the body of a nigga that's hopeless, and basically gave up""
The cash ain't changed much
I still never dealt with all the shit that I bottled up
I'm coming loose at the seams, can't get my shit together
Live in paradise but all I see is this bad weather
Got everything I wanted but I still feel hollow
My biggest fear today is that I'll wake up tomorrow
Premonitions of death, this time I'm living is borrowed
I got all of these blessings but yet I still feel sorrow
Only person that I like to talk to is myself
Too many voices in my head, not one of them help
I used to think it was being broke so I wanted wealth
But then I finally realized I'm forever lost, this another epilogue
We'll see if I make it to the next episode
Will I stay? Will I go? I don't know

One false move and you might trip
Yeah you might slip, fall into the traps they set
It ain't a game if you thought it was
Nigga they ain't playing fair, how you think they won?
You better keep your eyes wide and your mind sharp

I'm mackin' and smackin and givin' it back

Placed in a gas chamber that suffocates to unconsciousness
Author it like a novelist
Modest with my accomplishments

Teflon 
is the armor
 that sit on my chest
When I look at the page it's a visual mess
This
A tentative temper tantrum
That's targeted for an officer
Flying planes into offices
9/11 sarcophagus
Often lost in this awesomeness
Sacrifical the offering
Pterodactyl vernacular
Flying over your Acura
I'm
Taking my time with the rhyme
The page is for diamonds to shine
To blossom and bloom
In the dark of a room
With a voice to consume
All the thoughts in your mind
I'm givin' you peace when you listen to mine
The pastor, the preacher, the piece of the mind
Can soar to the aura of the coroner corridors

Smoke from the Bora to more of the bored of the
That reach for the stars and survive in the water
Confirming I'm leaving 'em dormant
The murder informant
Perfection I've ridden the sea
Mentally free what I spit is the sickest disease
I'm dotting my i's and I'm crossing my t's
Obsessing the lesson conceptual fiend
Convincing yo' team
Professional scheme
For grabbing the cash and then gettin' the cream
Awake from the dream
I 'mpeepin' the scene
I see it's the fakest facade
My lyrics are hard
I'm givin' you je ne sais quoi
The voulez-vous , for sure
Ménage with a broad
Now bow down to god
I see they appalled
A round of applause
A moment to pause
Now give me some gauze
They listen they tripping
Kaleidoscope vision
I'm giving the longest division
I'm breakin' it down like I'm addin' it up
Wrappin' it up
I stay in a rush
You stuck in a rut like I'm callin' yo bluff
Call up the coroner bruh
I just stopped givin' a fuck
The pistol was tucked
The clip on the ground and I'm pickin' it up
Then cock it and pop it at you and a friend
The bullet was burnin' the top of the fringe
I'm losing my mind and I'll say it again
Respectin' the words that I've written for you
A vision of two for this pitiful youth
They crucify niggas for givin' the truth
I step to the mic and I do what I do
When you lacking the ego there's nothing to lose
Don't get misconstrued I got something to prove
Speakin' of a nigga my mind state is atrocious
Spittin' supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
A smorgasbord of disaster
That's spits sporadic the rapture
They captured the per capita capitalistic afterthought
Cold day in hell if you was hopin' I would fade away
My intentions are purer than holy water on crucifixes
If you too submissive like you was chillin' with groups of bitches
New submission leave you limpin'
Yeah my shit is bruised from pimpin'

Came with a hell of a speed
The making of this is a hell of a feat
These niggas is sweet

They've triggered the killer that's letting 'em leap

Is it your image controlling your mind state?
I mean lately must I say
I'm not preaching to you at all
Or appalled by the way you living
It's different decisions made that created your current plot
Like you focusing on your fashion instead of earning degrees
Only been in class for an hour but now you ready to leave
When your best friend sent you a text and you simply follow the lead
Grab the backwoods and weed
Talk about many things
None of them are progressive, it's negative pessimism
How you speak of success when you lacking the work ethic
High as a 757, your sense is the 70s
Your boss is on your line 'cause you late for another shift
Now waitressing don't paying the bills
With that lavish life that you wanted
But still heavy souls though
Hold up, but there's still heavy souls though
And if you hit a nigga up you know I still fuck
She on a late night tip, I let her slide through

We step back and forth with the test
But you really testing my patience
Why you making excuses?
Why you acting evasive?
Asking too many questions don't come with no reservations
The conversation has gone from amazing to more abrasive
I thought I was in the clear but you started pumping your brakes
20 minutes have passed and you speaking on insecurities
40 minutes have passed and you speaking on inhibitions
Wasting all of my time, are you serious
Now is all that shit deliberate
Acquiring minds, well I don't know
How you go from you're ready and on your way
To hold up can you wait a second
And just give me a minute
I can't believe that you did this
When did you start acting different
I guess it's people's opinions
That live inside of your head
Punch your progression instead
You never used to be like this
Why you so indecisive
I don't honestly like it
You let everyone slide in
Never helps to be lonely so I'mma need for you to hop up in your motherfucking car, take a trip
Meet me half way but girl, that's if you're not convinced
I late night creep, a secret hit behind a tent
And you ain't gotta explain to me what that nigga mean to you
Tell me how you feel about him, I see that it's menial
I know that you got work in the morning so look I let you decide
You either stay your ass at home or you can come over mine

The come down is like a crash, call that blue crush
I'm Kukoč with these flows, I’m too clutch
These boys relying on gimmicks, they need a new crutch
See, once the high wears off, you'll find your wherewithal
And realize that you was never really there at all
In due time this darkness'll turn to light, dog
The crowd gone, they about to turn the lights off
I been moving too long
I been thinking too much
I'm workin' smarter, not harder, that's how I still approach it
The ups and downs and the intricacies, I really know it
This shit is deeper than you think, deeper than you know
Deeper than the deepest depths that you could ever go
You get a million ""no""s before they finally open up the fuckin' door
And see this shit for what it is, but you ain't even want it

The lights, the lights
So high, so high
They shine, they shine
So bright, so bright
Don’t go too fast or close your eyes
You’ll miss it all, miss it all
Doing too much
You're supposed to take your time
Get too close and you could lose your mind
Close your eyes and it could all pass you by
The lights, the lights
Just take your time
You could blink and it could all pass you by

It gets hard to block it out but we try
Silence now

Isolation is a potent motivator
It’s funny when the only one that you can talk to is the pen and paper
Creative outlets ain't that creative

It’s no room
Overwhelmed and consumed

Watchin' life go by
Wishin' it was different
Your intuition kickin' in but you ain't even listenin'
Hard to see the future when you can't even envision it
Life's a marathon, not a short race
Try to keep a steady pace
Don't worry about first place
Don't worry about accolades
Don't think about recognition
Try to find some self-belief amongst all the grief
Peace of mind is not enough when you want more than you have
Try loving yourself, see that's all that you have
Validation ain't much, you might feel good for a month
The happiness dries up, and then you feel washed up
I suggest that you wise up
I know the truth taste bitter
I know the lies taste sweet
But all that shit artificial
If you like it, I love it
If denial's what you covet
The delusion is covered
Shit, you know that well
Gonna swim in that river
You won't be by yourself
Know the water is shallow, you'll never drown in it
Don't spend every minute trying to uphold an image
That ain't worth upholding, to bring you closer to closure
Oh no

So high, so high
They shine, they shine
So bright, so bright
Don't go too fast or close your eyes
You'll miss it all, miss it all

Get too close and you could lose your mind

It's crucial that you pay attention now, now
The words that I can speak they were written by a man
That was multi-piece but never figure that shit out, out

It's a blessing I can live without the doubt, doubt
Like fuck the confirmation and the affiliations
I don't need a co-sign to shut this shit down

If you want me I want you too
I won't play no games

Nigga I'm not one to get sentimental
Just let me articulate it
See I might get off track
But I bet I bounce right back
And I know who I am, I
Been a man of my word, like
Well it's fuck what you heard, right
Never stuck on no stagnation
Feel the blame, it's my fault, maybe
Well I guess it's your loss, baby
In my book, see, we all crazy
Can admit that we all crave
That good L-O-V-E
Can't script that for no TV
That's the goal like a TD
Need my own Nefertiti
I want trips to the islands
Where it's secluded and tropic
I give my all, feel the throttle
Boy, that's my nature like Ric Flair
You arrived to this conclusion recently but I been there
For the sake of time I let you breathe, reflect upon these many things
Prepare for the fallout
Never known without a lifeline
Goin' in and out of a callout
Said I'm ready for the light now
I need all of you to pipe down
Gotta make a tough decision, I
Swear to God a nigga livin' right
We only get one in a physical form, Lawd

Take me all the way with you
I won't say a thing
If you want me I want you too
I won't play no games
Take me all the way with you
I won't say a thing
If you want me I want you too

Grab some sense or intercept it
My shit clean like 
Chloraseptic
Every track is a reflection
Score like I'm 
Boomer Esaison
Landline, how I dial in
Sink or swim, I'ma dive in
Head first in the deep-end
Nigga, I done paid the price to live the life I do
No damn excuses, chuck the deuces
Kept it moving, resolution
Lookin' for the restitution
Nigga said a lot of bullshit disguised as movements
False prophets impede on the weak and hopeless
Niggas doing too much, might overdose it
Said I been in my own lane, I ain't even notice
Came up from the ground like a Rose or Lotus
Gave my heart to this shit like an organ donor

Seen the writing's on the wall, yeah the kid is chosen
Tell him read between the lines and you might just notice
Bet I bounce back
Bet I get up
Basquiat, the way I paint my pictures
Colorful canvas, my shit look vivid
All good kings get the throne
It's all perspective, shit, to each his own
Bomb like Saddam on an enemy's home
It's a headshot to the front of your dome
It's a white flag in the war zone
Defcon 5, tell 'em ""ring the alarm""
It's a drone strike to the shit you love
Clear it all out 'til it ain't no more

Yeah, it's hard to gain the comprehension
I'm trying to make 'em understand me
I never took the pain for granted
They compliments were underhanded
Because niggas never walk the same road that I did
Niggas never lived the same life that I lived
Niggas never gave the same effort I give
No, no, no
And I did it
My way, my way
You can see I did it
My way, my way, oh
They just talk a lot, my God
They just selling y'all facades
I just wanna slice, can I get a piece?
I just want what's mine, what was left for me
Everything and nothing
This gluttony I see's disgusting
Shit's a disease and I don't trust it
ADHD, these niggas flustered
No PHD, I diagnose it
No silver lining, shit is hopeless
That finish line, I hope I see it
When it don't pan out they stop believing

F&F (At All Kaytranada Rmx),UnKnown,2017.0,"See
I'm not of this world
The place I reside
Is outside of the atmosphere
I'll make the temperature rise
Political prisoner status like Assata Shakur
The ink that I'm using to write
Is like a finer liquor
My words ferment, & lament
With all of the energy spent
My realistic point of view has been refreshing as all hell
Continue to try while y'all fail i'm still here
Your shit blow like windmills & quick thrills
My shit blow like C4 & George Jung
These rappers CB4 with no gusto
Trying to lead the blind, so I wrote this in brail
But you can feel this shit regardless of your competence level, and
I'm on the edge like a bevel blade
Shape up, or ship out
I been up, I been down
The one thing that I found
It's all about attention to detail
Try to keep the overhead low like retail
The mom & Pop operation I been runnings independent
Usain with the pen I paint a picture quickly
Running laps around the competition
Tell them come & get me
Jacking for beats
I can teach them how to rob like 50

Don't it look sweet
Don't it feel right
Gone take a bite of the forbidden fruit
Getting loose
Forget all that negative energy you came with
That lame shits unnecessary tell them I don't need it
(3x)

I impeach them with the pensive penmanship that I have
This tentative rhetoric tends to keep them attentive
I see that, believe that, now we back
To our scheduled program
Out side of the box
But I go in you feel me
Huh
Now lord willing we can make it out and elevate
The skill that I posses is powerful
I never hesitate
I readjust and regulate
It resonates with some
My cadence is sporadic
I spazz, I'm not in my right mind
Like Nosferatu
I do my best work in the night time
Young Oliver North
I smuggle dope with this shit
Spread it across your community
Causing Mass pandemonium
Making money hand over fist
But at your expense like
Whats a dollar to you
How much you wiling to give
You sell your soul
I'll give you wealth
Now that's the fairest exchange
Take a bite of the fruit its forbidden
But don't it look sweet
And don't it feel right
Yea, I said

Don't it look sweet
Don't it feel right
Gone take a bite of the forbidden fruit
Getting loose

War of Love,Abstract Art,2015.0,"Yes lawd
And you can say that my music is elegant
Long as it's never repetitive
Peddlin' passive aggression through all of your sentences
Lost in the depths of my sentiments
Center yourself and then sense all the sensitives
Search for the source of your pain
That resides in your brain
A perpetual force or a fortress
That was disproportionate
Pour a conventional portion
Can you give me a motherfucking second or minute to kill it
I promise you'll love it
And never put nothing above it
You  the greatest motherfucking thing that was ever heard in your sorry ass life
You giving into a vice
My advice is focusing on practicing to get it right, but it's nice
When the light shines bright
For the moment in time being the realest, I finally understand it
That life is all about making a plan, becoming a man
Couldn't comprehend
Remembering when I was younger and dumber, but now giving you something you never seen
With the realization that everything ain't what it seems
Just a nigga tryna live inside a dream
DAMN!

Yes lawd
Uh huh
Nigga Faiz in the beat
Extra crispy and shit

Look, I
Wonder when it's all gon' end
Paint a picture with a pen
I guess it really depends
On the mindset that I'm currently in
To defend
Realizing that these motherfuckers really wanna pass me up
And turn a nigga to a passenger
Never relaxing cause
I wanna focus on vernacular
But through the mud is where their dragging us
Tell me to pack it up
My nigga, look
Said I would never quit it
Admit it the victim was timid
The type and the tip and the top like they picking your pocket
And pitted your problem
I profit on propositional power
Devour then cower the cowards that counted in amounts
Was it really for material wealth?
You're selfish
You only focus on your motherfucking self
Will it last?
Only time gon tell
Well we're all going to hell
But I thought that my poetry would avail
It's a picture of the pain that I felt, my emotional tales
And I pray of a pair for the swell, but I hope that it all works out
You receive success and excess and your life stays blessed
Yes

Like the scar of age
Written all over my face
I remember his hands

The light shot diamonds from his eyes

Uh-huh. Eh

I'm thankin' God for the day and all the blessins he's given
With not a worry in the world and I don't have a complaint
The sun rise in the east and then it sets in the west
I'm praying for some peace of mind and happiness with no stress
I feel like I'm running in circles I'm in need of some rest
The sun rise in the east and then it sets in the west

Look
As I wake up
To a new day
With a clear mind
And my outlook
Upon life is like
Well it's kinda' hard
And I gotta move
There's no time to waste
But I pray okay my faith so strong
There's no way that I'ma let you stop me
Circumstances ain't that bright
And my situation don't look good
But my head high in this destitution
And I'ma make it work and stay positive
And there's a lot of pain that I put inside of me
Most times I wanna criticise
My point of view and my life decisions
Deal with the  as necessary
Some judge but they not me
I gotta go and get it
Bills don't stop
And I've been on a mission
For a better life
But I can't struggle for the rest of it
I'm like what's the point that you've elevated
And seperate from this poverty
Is it possible that I get a piece
I need something more than these 4 walls
And I'm motivated for the most part
But this pain I feel, see it prolongs
So I ride around and I doze off
But I can't quit, I'm right back at it
Up and at it like a fucking addict
Understand that it's a process
Gotta focus, usin' common sense
Stand for something never contradict
In the midst I gotta persevere
And Imma make it clear that I'm a different breed
Somethin' that the people never seen
Dedicated but I fell in love
With this artform that I can't forget
So I sacrifice and don't think about it
My current plight might cause doubt
And I'm all in I can't fall off
But I maintain as I chase a dream
Everything ain't always what it seems
Know yourself and try to find your soul
It's a lonely road that I chose to ride
But I stay steady on the incline
So in due time when I do find
A new state of mind for my sanity
But it's safe to say I went the wrong way
I don't recognize who I am now
I'm in too deep with no one to save me
Lord, I got this passion that's inside of me
I know if I focus my dream will come to fruition
I understand that it's mental
I'll speak it into existence
Persistence, patience and prayin'
Don't practice procrastination
Time is never on my side
So I work with a sense of urgency
Certainly terrified that my efforts could go in vain
Can't explain the pressure I'm under
I'm hoping that when it ends I attain achieve and succeed in surpassin' your expectations
LAWD! Uh huh, yea

The light shines on my face I feel good; I admit it
I'm thankin' God for the day and all the blessins he's given
With not a worry in the world and I don't have a complaint

[Verse 1: 
K.A.A.N.
]
I can feel the pain and pressure, too close
I done failed a million times, tell 'em I know
I relate to you when most, they don't
It's a beautiful thing to be self-aware
So when the nights are long and dark, too cold
When it's all too much to handle, don't fold
Try to find your faith, no forced euphoria
But the false and fake, they fail and don't return
I reciprocate the reciprocity
The reciprocal of love and all you need
If I spread the word and it's heard, I do believe
The power I possess, to truly lead
Giving my all
Giving my heart
Giving my soul
It's taking a toll
And I can admit that
Given so much and now I want my shit back
I need my time and my peace of mind
I need everything that I left behind
I need all the love that I threw away
I need all the days that I can't replace
I want to take it back, reverse all my efforts
Still remember them brighter times
Before the dream became this obsessive
Before I learned all these life lessons
Before I second guess overthinking
All indecisive, just make a choice
Nigga don't be silent, just use your voice
And this clarity yes I do rejoice
And I trust my heart, but that's not enough
It's tough to bluff your way through life
I slip but don't break
I'm real when they're fake
I can when they can't
The fake I've fought pass, I've had the last laugh

Sometimes I get lost in the maze of my mind
Blocking my blessings and discretions, I'm holdin' them closely
The one and only, if you didn't, now you know it homie
I'm just a voice for the lonely
I'm just a vessel for pain
I'm just a wandering soul, my destination's still unknown
Heaven or Hell how can you tell the place you callin' your home
I like to roam like cellular phones where no service resides
And isolate my physical so that my spirit can rise
These pivotal times, that noise is deafening that's outside
I got a conscious full of demons, there's nowhere I can hide
I'm Jekyll and Hyde, I only show the world one side
I juggle emotions when in motion they might cause me to trip
Just fly over the Cuckoo's nest and you'll see where I exist
My humble abode, comfortable in my depressed zone
My reflex gone, I'm sittin' tryin' to write my wrongs
Used to be easy when I reflected and wrote me a song

But the thrill is gone (the thrill is gone) uh huh, yah yah
The thrill is gone (the thrill is gone) uh huh, yah yah

Feel like I shot my last shot but I was off by an inch

The thrill is gone (the thrill is gone) uh huh

That fold like envelopes and dosey doe and shuck and jive to get the dough
Well informed nigga, yah, I'm in the know
Children of the indigo within a globe were led ashore by police and select few
View at your own discretion
What you see is a self-saboteur still in his adolescence
Has yet to find progression like my light is incandescent
The land of the clandestine I'm not even contestin'
This fate and it feels like destiny but yet so fuckin' distant
Speak this shit to existence, think about it, I insist it
You can hear my life story if you listen close
The things that I'm ashamed of only Jehovah knows
And even when I die my presence can be felt like the Holy Ghost
Say you got some peace of mind? Well I suggest you hold it close
Develop a tight vise-grip, and never let it go
Cause you gon' miss it when the thrill is gone (the thrill is gone)

Feel like a junkie coming down from a fix
Feel like I shot my last shot but I was off by an inch

I don't do the rumors, fuck what you heard
Got my hands dirty 'cause I do work
Kept it straight and steady, nigga you swerve
Hit the light switch, yeah I might bitch
Blow the building up like I'm ISIS
Run a clean route, Jerry Rice shit
Put the whole game in my vices
Niggas been known I'm decisive
Call me Phil Jack with an icepack
Run a play, ride it, run it right back
In the same night, how you like that?
Callin' out numbers, Pat Sajak
Feeling like Diddy telling 'em ""take that, take that""
You can have it when I'm finished
My shit real, authentic
Your shit fake, augmented
My status eminent
My feet set lil nigga
Get what you get, you get it?
Really don't make no difference
Bitch don't come 'round

Don't throw off my energy, you killing my high
They want the recipe, my slice of the pie
Said I'll let 'em rest in peace, before I divide
What's mines is mine, from nine to nine
I get up and cook like I'm Emeril Lagasse
Flow like a river, it run like a faucet
I'm in my element, nigga you lost it
I'm on my ship, my nigga you off it
I play the field like I'm Kenny Lofton
You got it backwards, that's some Kriss Kross shit
I've been on point, yeah that's some Chris Paul shit
I paid the price, I know what the cost is",https://genius.com/Kaan-recipie-lyrics
King Solomon,Abstractions,2017.0,"Uh huh, yea, lawd, uh huh, uh huh, lawd, look, huh

Now let the motherfucker drop
So they can feel the bass
So brace of a half bent
Surrounded by has-beens
There's killers and madmen
They plottin' and watchin'
They prey on the weak
And beseech when you speaking problems
These people they back-stab
I swear that it's all fake
My faith has been sealed, I sincerely pray there's no second coming of Christ
My vices have all consumed me
Mind, body and soul
The control that I used to have is no longer now in effect
I just resurrected my demons and brought them back from the grave
I could try dodge and evade but this massive mess that I made is a maze that I must reside in
Salutations from Zaire
You resilient as I am
That's a farce that you forcin'
Far along in your denial
Overrated and senile
Got my heart on my sleeve and I'm wearing it like a decal
Reasons are rarely feasible
Feed the minds of the famished
The feeble fain to complain
But I promise you that I plan this
Now granted, I gratify with this gift of gab that I'm blessed with
Yes I'm very obsessive
Never passive-aggressive
Protective of what I've built and I kill myself to obtain it
But can't explain or articulate images in my mind
These lucid dreams that I have like an out-of-body experience
End of the conversation like exclamations and periods
Mirror me if you want to
Flattery resonates through
Praises sent to the most high
Call Jehovah for replies
Movin' that's when I decide
See the style that I design
Never delay or rely
My entire life feel high
Watch me feast on these felines
Pussy rappers in disguise
I've been losin' my mind bein' pulled in many directions
Feelin' fatigued, I feel like a fallen soul, won't you save me?
I conversate with myself, I'm confused, I'm livin' aloof
And the truth, I can never find it
Tell me how you define it
Deep inside of these passages
Pastor pass me the holy water
These words are sentimental
I truly hope they help ya
So hold them close to your soul and promise they'll never slip
Yea yea, lawd, look
I grip the pen like fuck it
Busters and pastors duckin'
Runnin' yo pockets for ducketts
I need a bakers dozen
Due diligence, I'm destined
Solidify my presence
My energy is effervescent, bless it let it breathe
Believe that we can achieve and the sound will supersede
Surpassin' all of these dumb fucks
You're livin' with no luck
Hopeless, can't trust, It's a must that I do this
And prove that I can battle in these arenas
Arian mind state with the paragraphs, preach impurities
Surely with this uncertainty I am searchin' inside
For somethin' more than a drive a materialistic vibe
In my eyes you can see the anger, frustrated and anxious
Lord why you forsake us? multiple personalities
Just me, myself and I but accompanied by futality
I, took the time to try and truly reflect
Suffocated by the pain while strangulated from stress
Feel like it's hands around my neck, I say a prayer from next
I wrote this new religious text, that shit was tempting at best
I blast at these bastards with passion preparin' for the apocalypse
Master minds 'til they manage to manufacture their majesty
Masterfully melodic and modest minus the minor
I been mindin' my business
My Midas Touch has been itchin'
The feel is like a Klonopin
Honest with my accomplishments
All I want is acknowledgement
I don't fuck with you novices
The legacy I leave is in the league of King Solomon",https://genius.com/Kaan-king-solomon-lyrics

Lawd, Knowledge, nigga
I still don't know how to work my mutha fuckin' phone nigga I need one of those joints with like 4 buttons on it
I'm, I'm elderly at heart my nigga
Look

I gotta lot of stress on my mind man
I roll the fire, light the truth
Gotta lot of things I wanna say to y'all
So when I'm on it, 
This opinion's mine so imma share for free
When I die I wonder where i'll be
Wanna give you more but no ones listenin'
My time is short it's not infinite
Its incidental tempatential that's essential
You best believe the best is back to bless the track
Investigate the scene and gauge the things I've seen
I made mistakes along the way
I know it
Rose from the ground, and imma blossom like a lotus
Real niggas never quit motherfucka
And you know it
Told them what I want, and now I guess I gotta show 'em
I said it's all love, just let it
Seek through the bread, with the sauce imma spread it
You could see what it is, I am broke cause I levy
Imma huddle like I'm Drew Brees
Too deep, in it with the sound
You could feel it, am I down?
My opinion is bound to the rhythm
Imma difficult soul to explain (yes lawd!)
Can't change, imma never be the same (oh no!)
I remain as I am right now, yes lawd you know it!

Put some weed in the wood, wood
Man I wish a nigga would, would
Bet a nigga wish he could, could
Nigga we was never good

The pain is something deep inside
When the time is right I'll let it out for you
So the truth is never hidden, we're aloof
For I'm a lucid dream away from being free
I don't need acceptance, feel like I'm unique
But the peace of mind, the love I seem to seek
It's peeked and just past me, I can not grasp it
Good lawd I'm blackin' out, no backing down
Your barriers - I knock 'em down
I box you out, I lay them 'bout
Imma 'bout to bounce
You best believe me, I ain't done
I just work with no hesitation
Stay medicated, day-dreaming daily
Can't shit phase me, I'm just too focused
My train of thought is unbreakable, unmistakable, unbelievable

Put some weed in the wood, wood
Man I wish a nigga would, would
Bet a nigga wish he could, could
Nigga we was never good, good
Put some weed in the wood, wood

Limits/Obsession,The Black Blood LP,2017.0,"Part 1: Limits

Don't break me
I worked too hard just to build myself back up
Don't break me
I came too far just to let you hold me up
Don't break me
I worked too hard just to build myself back up
Don't break me
I came too far just to let you hold me up

And I did it
I know
I'm past the limit now I'm movin' out my restin' body
Oh, but in a minute
I'll go
I can't afford to make a stop I rev the engine passin' all these other niggas
Woah-oh
We not in a competition I'm just runnin' from the track
You niggas livid
Woah-oh-oh
And that's some shit a nigga owe

I got too much shit that's on my mind
I gotta zone out
I been trying to find a will or way I gotta know now
Lately I been thinking I should quit and take it home now
I'll just let her do it all, maybe I should slow it down

Lost to the sword, that's the way that a young nigga been
Don't break, don't fall, don't move, motherfucker, don't bend
I was thinkin' about the pain and the game and the way it don't end
I was sittin' in the rain now nobody experienced with a pen
I been on the path to enlightenment
Whole-hearted with the way a nigga write this shit
If you don't like this shit it's not for you then
That wasn't all just fuck it, there's no comparison
If you compare me with
I'm not an average Joe
I try to speak from the soul and give you a tangible feel
If only ability ever made a connection that's real
I said it's all from the heart, no animosity here

And I did it
I know
I'm past the limit now I'm movin' out my restin' body
Oh, but in a minute
I'm gone

You niggas livid

And that's some shit a nigga owe

I been trying to find myself, I can't, I feel alone now
I feel like I'm trapped and I don't have nowhere to go now
I can't seem to find my favorite way, my mind it flows now
Either way I'm movin' on, ain't no time to slow it down

Lost for a minute, but I'm back, give it to you with a venge-
I asses what I see  to beseech you again
I was searching for the meaning of it all, I'm wonderin' how it ends
I was looking for the way but never found it, self-doubtin' again
The words cut deep like blades of steel
I feel it in my soul like salt in my wounds
I gotta find a perspective so I can properly judge
Took a look in the mirror, I didn't like what I saw
It's like I'm masking the pain or a nigga wear a facade
Sounds like I'm speakin' in tongues like I was talking to God
Let me live in the moment like it was Deja-vu
Call it ""c'est la vie""
A gorilla glue
Ha-ha

And I did it
I know
I'm past the limit now I'm movin' out my restin' body

I'm gone

Part 2: Obsession

Light at the end of the tunnel
I done fell in love with it
Obsession is addictive, baby
Te-e-ell me about it
I don't push it far
Before everything (thing thing thing)
And the time been aloft
I done lost my family and friends
To this bullshit
My love, my love, my love, my lo-ove

Lost in the dark, but I'm focused on the light at the end of the tunnel
I, must have lost sight right around the same time I lost touch with myself
Desperation stinks and I sense it
I've internalized and my emotions are senseless
In return I've found that I'm actually helpless
Somebody  and baby I can't yelp
My hands are tied in this situation
I'm a slave to you
I've catered to you
You kept me high when I was feeling low
You gave me a glimpse about a year ago
But you left quick and I been searching since
My addiction itches, gotta find me a hit

My love, my love, my love, my lo-ove

And I ain't been around the world but I been looking eternally
Turning over a new leaf to relieve stress
Find the meaning of success and redefine that
Any time spent and they're sure to make a comparison
Idolizing these niggas for every wrong reason
My rationale is irrational, rushing to a conclusion
My mind is under assault from the false and the pretenses
Keep it all together, avoid the mental regression
Progression in the realest sense
What you really want from this?
What's the end game in the plan that I can't proceed with
Trying to get a million like I was standing next to Regis
A quick recession and essentially I'm in your region
Trying to find balance, I need it
Lost in the work, motherfucker, not leaving

My love, my love, my love, my lo-ove
Too busy staring at the

Light at the end of the tunnel
I done fell in love with it
Obsession is addictive, baby
Te-e-ell me about it
I don't push it far
Before everything (thing thing thing)
And the time been aloft
I done lost my family and friends
To this bullshit

My love, my love, my love, my lo-ove",https://genius.com/Kaan-limits-obsession-lyrics
Sh!t,UnKnown,2016.0,"Aye
Lawd, aye
Knowledge, nigga
Spending money on these hoes
Nigga you ain't fucking shit
Spending money on these hoes
Lawd

I
Know my position
I'm poised to point out I'm past important
I'm pretty sure my intentions pure as a priest and pastor
Egregious bastard that's never seen, but I seem to capture
Sleeping slumber something cumbersome, I come and slaughter them
Saw the mountain top I reach the peak, and still I plead the fifth
Pleased to meet myself, it's nice to make my own acquaintance nigga
Came out, saw and conquered
Confidence is through the fucking roof
A lucid dream I like to live, I base it off the honest truth
Bitch I be taking you way back
Giving you literal pay back
Like take that with a new flow
For the few dope
In a four door
What they don't know
Is I goes in
But it will show
And they all froze
And the four all
With a good plan
But a new time
And I need space
I alleviate for this leniency
My levels are up where they need to be
And I only focus on progress
With no pretense
And I can't judge
I won't give up
Push past pain, I'm in the fast lane
I can't stop, nor 
But these rappers' slides are ridiculous and derivative
This regurgitation is quite amazing
You ain't the same to enjoy the same
That Monday monotonous
With no common sense, but these compliments
That poor cadence, won't you change it
Been too brainless, that's my opinion
This pen and document anything that I ever think and that's detrimental
Sinning away, you in love with the pace
And the pain is the most, for the sake of the track
With the vibe that I bring, and I swear to protect
I punch your lungs with punctuation, pronunciate and I paraphrase paragraphs
But my language aristocratic
Combative, I'm at this shit like an addict
With extra additives added
Inside my daily routine
I'm serene, seen with a sedative
Perhaps I'll snap and attack the psychiatrist trying to conversate, talking about my past
""What do you think that you lost and recall the emotions that you have repressed""
Tell me all your sins, I want to hear them
I'm just trying to help
You gotta open up, can't be selfish so please explain yourself
I'm, a young sociopathic sin serenader
Sedated, save with this lyrical love of label
But later I learn intellectual lessons
The dissertation for sure, kinda sore
With the extra essence I effortlessly enunciate
Mentally I'm unstable, emotionally I fluctuate
Force the flows to facilitate
Censorship not incorporated
You reap what you sow, so in other words that's reciprocation
Feeling I supply sophisticated, call it fisticuffs
Physical altercation, I suffocate with my energy
I've attracted the elegance necessary to supersede
I can't succeed by seeking the deeper meanings of life
I live a meager one, personally the way I prefer
Mercilessly murder and mutilate
I melodically communicate, the coup d'état
My cross to bear's a lower self esteem
Assume positions to submit and quit
 praises to the king, I'm cleaning house
I'm numb, as cold as they come
Accustomed to destitution
Broke the mould while most of these motormouths were conceived
 of my keen ability to adjust
It's uppercuts for 
I function barely fair enough
My fear is falling if I attain what I work to receive
Then I recede, the  regresses if I haven't progressed
I'm just a shell of myself
A deficiency of determination
Mostly motivated by major mistakes that I have made
Was drastically affected by separating myself
See I choose to do this alone
I refuse to accept assistance
You think material wealth and I pray for my mental health
I had hopes that Jehovah could hear me
I fail my test and assignment
He's given me many talents for that I should be appreciative
Instead I ignore it and only focus on the negative responses and the comments
Fuck that I'm givin' a masterpiece
Make a  and they mad at me
Said I'm one of the realest to do it
I mean it my nigga well actually
No faculty distracting me, lawd

All these, niggas, rap a, 'bout a, life they, know they, never, lived
I don't, give a, fuck I, never, have and, swear I, never, will
Tell 'em I'm the sickest
I sit in sin and repent
I'm the illest of illustrators
Originator of deprecation is the foundation
Face the facts, I fast for the hell of it
Help the hold on reality
Realistically rationin'
Rappin' circles around 'em
Content with killin' contemporaries
Necessary verbal assault
And they so illiterate
I'm literally livid they livin' minus literacy
But I'm mindin' my bidness
So motherfuck 'em, I'm adios
I don't know about monetization or making money off this
I author the truth and I work so the rest'll fall in place
Said that I'm bringing the real in
We do not care about feelings
I’m making a financial killin
You people have got to be kidding
The way that I do it is different
Me and my niggas not givin' in
Positionin' myself to be one of the greatest of all time
And the rhyme is like an idea
Nigga, I fear no man breathin'
I stay breachin' these limitations
I won't stop, still going crazy
Can't be touched, just realize that it's not surprisin' I'm this good

I'm just tryna reach the peak
What's the limit? I don't see it

Room for one, this shit ain't spacious

Drive like a Tesla

No you don't impress us
Chess, not checkers
I been yellin' checkmate for the past 5 years
I steer clear past that bullshit
Had a taste of this life and I instantly got addicted
Safe to say that my vision been influenced by this mission

There has never been enough for a young nigga
I paint a picture of the pain I'm illustrating with a pen
I articulate the way that I've been feeling through the words
Lyrics deep enough for any shallow mind to be submerged
I emerged as a mothafuckin' poet, describe the plight of the people
Departed from all the evil, defeated by the deceitful
Depleted minds of the feeble that juxtapose the position
That composition the prequel, you ready for the sequel
I wanted to provide a vibe they can imagine
They finally pay attention when a mothafucka rappin'
Askin' why the hell that nigga spazzin'
He hyperventilate and barely breathin' like it's asthma
Then get up on a track and attack it in a way you couldn't fathom
But imagine that my intuition was never intuitive
I try to stay away from all these fuckin' opportunists
They just wanna take advantage of the dream that I'm pursuin'
Now with the way that I spit it, Imma set it apart
I give 'em everything I got, even a piece of my heart
I'm livin' out a pipe dream that isn't gettin' me far
I'm just an average mothafucka with a whole lot of ambition
My confidence is deficient, imagine in my position
Envisionin' propositions of powerful promiscuity
Money women and jewelry, fallacy not confusin' me
It's all a fabrication, the status of your desire
A company is compliant, so money is multiplyin'
Instead I remain defiant confided within the craft
Complyin' with regulations with practice and preservation
How practical you would think with your constant procrastination
That you was destined for greatness
The only thing that's real is the work ethic and effort
The patience and dedication to be remembered forever
But 'til the moment I reach it, I'm workin' to make it better
Creatin' the perfect record, goddamn

You're the only friend I need (you're the only friend I need)
Sharing beds like little kids (sharing beds like little kids)
And laughing 'til our ribs get tough (laughing 'til our ribs get tough)
But that will never be enough (but that will never be enough)
You're the only friend I need (you're the only friend I need)
Sharing beds like little kids (sharing beds like little kids)
And laughing 'til our ribs get tough (laughing 'til our ribs get tough)
But that will never be enough (but that will never be enough)

I want 'em back (I want 'em back)
The minds we had (the minds we had)
How all the thoughts (how all the thoughts)
Moved 'round our heads (moved 'round our heads)
I want 'em back (I want 'em back)
The minds we had (the minds we had)
It's not enough to feel the lack
I want 'em back, I want 'em back, I want 'em-

Imma kill it with the poison of a venomous scheme
Somethin' that you never seen, what I spit is methamphetamine
A medic in to set a scene, I'm tryna lead supporters of the subpar
Thus far every single song that I'm hearing is depressed
And I'm guessin' there's a recession of the honesty and passion
To make a lasting impression
I finally realized I provide a proper etiquette
My purpose on the earth is rhymin' synonyms and predicates

The drink you spilt all over me
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
The drink you spilt all over me

I know they fuckin' with a nigga and they feeling the vibe
It's a blessing that the kid is alive, ya ya

And I said, we bringing that roughness
That lyrical toughness ya fuck with
Created with structure, we leaving them flustered, in clusters Supplying the grievance, quickly surpassing peons
Pivot to the precipice, turn the page and I leave 'em
Intuition is kicking in, give it a couple of minutes, man
My lines are sound and sharp as a guillotine, swing and euthanize
Now understand, I just want my respect
My intellect like Imhotep, quiet as kept when I step
This aggressive verbal assassin assesses the situation
Berate these brazen attempts to prevent my spiritual rise
Surprise, it's all serene, the sweetest of serpentine's
Lurkin' searching for sure, I never move with uncertainty
Certainly some agree my egregious grammar's disgusting aah
Let me get it with the real again
Nigga you intimidated by the competition
Can't fuck with the kid with the rhymes invented
No time to waste, I gotta press forward
It's a long journey I'm prepared for
But I'm an ancient savage like Conan aah
Heard of kings and queens, that co-exist with gods and live amongst the stars
I guess that pasture's green, but is that conscious clean?
I worked to find my self worth and purpose
Surpassing the surface, beyond the persecutions

I put my life inside these lines that I write
I said that we bringing the real for real
I said that my flow can entice
I said that I'm one of the sickest to do this, and I meant that shit
It's all love, don't forget that shit, ye-yeah lawd

I said that we bringing the real for real
I said that my flow can entice
I said that I'm one of the sickest to do this, and I meant that shit
It's all love, don't forget that shit, ye-yeah

Am I just a pawn in the scheme, in the picture who's frame is too large?
Never too proud to move on, oh my god full of nuance
Secrets systematic, color coated schematics
I managed to reach my quota, quality over quantity
Scientifically I select, quantize, analyzing your lines
The way that I dissect, my rhetoric is righteous
My dialect is decisive, priorities in order
Proper authorities, forcibly held against your will
Seeing that show, the highlight reel
Meticulous murderous montage
Niggas being killed in the streets and no one sneezes
America the free, you're invested in them believing
This is a mental facetious egregious grievances, graciously patiently as I infect
Cultivator, I invent
Purely proceed my intents, intensely I laid the blueprint
Ignored, considered useless by most, they all denied me
A coupla years they gon' fuck with the boy
Just filling the void, lawd

I put my life inside these lines that I write
I said that we bringing the real for real
I said that my flow can entice

I've heard of kings and queens, that co-exist with gods and live amongst the stars
I guess that pasture's green, but is that conscious clean?

Surpassing the surface, beyond the persecutions

Skateboard,UnKnown,2017.0,"And this a lethal interjection expecting plenty exceptions
Prepare for any rejection, confess a spiritual lesson
For this restless adolescent you could read between the lines
And see this motherfucking message
The blessing a nigga give it through information
That's written as riveting
If you listening and using but rarely intrusive
Inducing allusions  methodical method proven
Confusion that's constituted in this lyrical revolution my god
The realest of niggas alive
I step on the track and I'm killing the vibe
I murder a beat and I massacre minds
I make 'em retru you listen to mine
The will of the pen that be bending their spine
Dependent upon if you giving the time
My runs are refined, my lines are defined
The technical skill and the passion combined
You living in fear with your life it's define
Inferior soul consumed like a fire
Controlling the vibes, the wicked demise
The nigga despises, they're wearing disguises
You keep with the pace I'm running a race
I'm filling the page up with nothing but hate
I give an example, a similar taste
I studied the past, and some of it was a man for that nigga that wants to be great
(NAH!) that music don't relate or resonate
They hesitate with their salacious ass stories that was fabricated
Overactive imagination mixed with exaggeration no cooperation
I'm just trying to keep my glass half full
Lyrically I'm fanatical, masterful, magical, even close to classical
My words they carry heat and at the least they'll break your clavicule
Then toss you into oncoming traffic on any avenue (rAHHH!)

Shit that I written and spitten
And spinning and sitting inside of a prison
Insidious vengeance with hideous hindrance
Is the way that we livin
Created a product with what I was given
Just shut the fuck up for a second and listen
This mathematician has brought ammunition to murder suspicion
For never submitting they found all the bodies I've hidden right next to my closet
Deposit it inside of my  of the visions
I've taken it back to the visual aspect of rap
Are you picturing what I'm delivering?
Different ignorance sounding belligerent
Battle the paper, assault with the sentence
Now lace up your tennis
And run till you're mental and physically finished
No time to replenish (HA!)

Now pay attention to my prominence
Aware I'm dropping knowledge
Like dissertations in colleges
I've been trimming the fat and subtracting all the collages
Studying every word in attempt to attain competence
I'm confident this dominance compliments my conglomerates
Acknowledging the effort they given is more pathetic
I run it like calisthenics, articulated phonetics, forget it as I'm progressing
It's still impressive, your shit's depressing
Never regressing, expressing my lyrical prowess
Then pick up a pen and get violent
Give me a minute my nigga I'm wilin' hol'up
This a sabbatical, why you acting dramatic?
Emphatic, I focus on my passion what these other rappers lacking
Never relaxing, listen and try to imagine graspin everything that you asking
 manifest too good you fathom hol'up
I got that newest shit, you rapper 'posed to go recite
I feel your appetite like Aphrodite with a lot of dykes
I'm a radical reverend while I'm preaching this rhetoric
I'm just trying to perfect and resurrect a funeral procession
I infest the conceptions that turn into inception
While you pay the price of admission in two consessions
You profess and I'm the dopest that is yet to be noticed
You overdose and then comatose then off a the second dose
Someone please explain how the game encourages the mundane Four quarters and a dream if the scene is in need of change

And all I think about is suicide looking at my reflection
I'm depressed it's only you and I
Staring down the barrel as the devils whispers you decide
(I can pull the trigger) I aim it where the pain resides
(OH!)
And all I think about is suicide
Looking at my reflection I'm depressed
It's only you and I
Staring down the barrel

Now the world is selfish (selfish)

6:40 A.M. alarm was set for 7 though
Arise it's time to face the world
Correct the blinds the sun will shine
Woke up by the faintest cry
Consoles his daughter, ease her mind
Rocks his baby back to sleep
Then go prepare a meal to eat
Feed the fam and conversate
It's safe to say this man is blessed
The crest upon his chest
Is a badge to serve and protect
The less, unless you got some melanin
Well, then it don't apply to you
He out the door and on the move
To make this world a safer place
Squad car with a complex
Reports filed outta context
Got a trigger finger and you know it's itchin'
Kill an innocent nigga the only mission
Hit 'em with a bullet but it's like a missile
Take 'em down but you don't give a fuck about 'em
Had his hands out but he looked confused
Hit 'em in the back that's if he try to move
Lawd, he asks is partner ""Are there any decent niggas?""
""Nah, they all a bunch of animals, lazy and irresponsible
Check this one right here, he look suspicious don't he?

6:40 A.M. he has to stay an hour late
The overnight shift, so by 7:40 he on his way
The pay is a minimum wage but it beats the alternative
See he 2 charges deep tryin' to avoid the 3rd
Provide for 4 kids, if cops harass then he pleadin' the 5th
His last charge was an assault plus he resisted arrest
They judge him off appearance alone like it speaks for himself
But he just tryna make it home to walk his kids to the bus-stop
He rushed to run across the street then seen the lights flash
An altercation soon ensues from assumed guilt, no innocence
Fishin' for sufficient evidence to charge him
""I need to see your I.D. can you just relax for me please
We had an incident and you fit the description
Of the assailant that we're searchin' for
For crimes committed, it's only gonna take a minute
Chill on the curb while I run your I.D. and check for priors""
He says ""I'm innocent"" they think he's lyin'
His alibi doesn't blend with their bias
They ain't gon' buy it, the temperature is risin'
Cooler heads cannot prevail through this
Words exchanged before he blinks
A flashlight where his eyelid is
They yell ""He's got a gun!"" and them put some bullets inside of him

TBT (Dreams),Subtle Meditation,2018.0,"They askin' me about my story, let me tell 'em the truth
I started with a dollar and a dream, scratch that
I barely had enough money to get back and forth to the studio
Let alone to record and then mix and master
So poor that my pockets empty pourin', prayin' that it all works out
A 9-to-5 grind can really make your mind bug out
You talk about your dreams and people start to tune you out
So second guessin' every move until you plan a new route
This feel like two thousand and twelve when I was stocking shelves at Target
Payed $8.25 an hour, dreaming 'bout making an album
Thinking how can I survive with this meager existence
When this dream of mine is out of reach like it's off in the distance
Chasin' after it, feelin' fatigued
I got persistence, that's that second wind shit
These mental one mile wind sprints
Training for this fucking marathon
Long haul, I'm quick to get to my goal
That's the point, John Wall
Resting on a pedestal, that's the fastest way to fall
Above all, I keep my head high and press forward
In hopes that people press ""play"" and say that I'm the dopest
A lonely road, I chose the ride being driven by focus
Refuse to crash and break down, I gotta keep it goin'
I can't be stagnant, stallin' out in the land of the hopeless
Ten thousand hours, I'm getting close, I'm over devoted
They underestimated, that's an understatement
Need a fill in for the underdog?
I would love to play it any day of the week
I was smoking Backwoods while y'all was rolling in sweets
Off yo' ass and on your feet, my nigga ain't shit sweet?
We in this maze with no exit, can only pray for direction
Be conscious, makin' decisions when you don't have no protection
Double negative my logic, make it positive
The double entendres, the consonants with the melodies as the accent and harmonies that could complement
That's called cold common sense
Like Southside where it's middle of winter, freezing flow
I left 'em frozen again
I guess by now it's probably safe to say I'm chosen to win
Yeah, yeah, tell me what you doing my man?
Nobody told you niggas that I wasn't going nowhere?
The spot was vacant so you thought you'd take a seat in my chair?
I'm right here
What you doing my man?
Nobody told you niggas that I wasn't going nowhere?
The spot was vacant so you thought you'd take a seat in my chair?

Get the fuck out of my way and stay the hell out of my face
Ya never wasting my time, my time, my time
Get the fuck out of my face and stay the hell out of my way
I'm never wasting my time, my time, my time

Tripping off a little dope I call it meditation
I took a bit too much, I'm on a vacation
Killing every brain cell, my mind's vacated
Very aware that the water is getting deeper and I just might drown
Found peace in the beats I'm depending on
Now turn that motherfucker up so I can function boy
The half dead backpack spitta comin' out of Maryland
Embarrassed to bury your shit is dope but it varies
I made a murder and pillaged pitiful people imported
I put my all in the flow, sick and they already know
I fit conform with the formin' and force 'em all to submit
A cynical son of a bitch that never repents for his sins
And I'm in a state of somber
Refused to be sober
But decide for yourself, I will never condone this
Do as I say nigga not as I done
Intentions of being rolemodels for them
No one ever had it, I'm a man with flaws
And you won't ever see me change 'cause the camera's on
I'm still rolling by myself a nigga never had a crew
With all the shit that I've accrued, I said it came from the work
How the fuck can I forget it when it's all that I'm concerned 'bout
Now I'm the man but last year I was lame
Suicidal bars I wrote 'bout my pain
Well look how y'all change
This shit is insane
Lawd


Give me a moment in the glory of the almighty
But if you looking for a nigga you know where to find me
I sacrifice all of my time I pay attention to it
I got the blueprint I'm using my skill to make it happen
I'm only focused on the goals I never see distractions
I'm having panic attacks and praying that I'll make it out
At least alive with a little bit of hope left
Lord knows that a nigga feeling hopeless
I gotta get it by any means I am obsessed
But nothing's ever good enough I'm thinking what's next
Maybe I missed a couple lines in the subtext
Is there a guarantee that I would ever be next
A different pedigree a higher caliber again
The talent that I was given you'll never understand
It was a blessing from the gods and it's a gift of gab
I got a sicker style
My shit's subliminal
I bet you feel me now

It's common sense, it's evident inside my crystal ball
The writing's on the wall but you can't even read the words
Fuck what you heard, it gets absurd
We'll search the ends of the earths surface for resources
Still porous, poised to point out all the hypocrisies
A Mephistopheles, a Socrates mixed with a lot of weed
My cryogenic sentence in your spirit, you can feel it mayne
The words get in your brain and bloodstream
Re-arrange your DNA
These phony niggas dip like a chip, I call it Frito Lay
Relay the message back to 'em, backstabbers get boxed out
The molly whop, the tomahawk, the blade to take his top off
Like strippers shaking asses in two-door coupes with the roof gone
They speak a different language, I'm bilingual and nuanced
A laundry list of money launderers lounging, you been warned
We get the bread and spread it out like Grey Poupon
This gift of gab will cut the price in half like two coupons
Can chop it up like gentleman and get down to the grimy shit
In line like rollerblades and motorcades
I'm known to call a spade a spade
I'll take the rain check and we can converse at a later date
Hope you got a plan b and a saving grace
I'll scrape your plate then make a great escape and take all the cake, you can keep a crumb
On second thought I'll take that crumb
I won't leave you with none
A fucking monster bitch, I only dine with godzillas and gorillas and godfather, mob figures get it nigga?
Picture it clear like
 it's like Picasso painted this himself nigga
Sistine Chapel, my dining hall it look like wealth nigga

I'm going in, my shit raw like no condom
I make a massacre, Hotel Rwanda
Back on my shit, back in my zone
Dictating like I'm Idi Amin
Colorblind, all I see is the green
Tell 'em pick a side, bitch it's you or I
Tell 'em level up 'til we eye to eye
Never, neverland where you niggas live
No coming down from here
I'm magnificent, the omnipotent, the prophecies fulfillment
This instalment, brand new proclamations for the indoctrination
These are words, take them as no more than just my observations
Reading the code of silence in my isolation
Hyperfocused sound inside the iso chamber
Slight arrangement, add a couple more steps to the process but I'll never change up
Niggas is malnourished, poor diet, edible and audible
The game shifted, switched up, I had to call an audible
I almost slipped, sloppy, sipping from a flask of Clase Azul
Smoking weed with my rasta crew, we do the impossible
Providin' the mayhem 'til the day end
From the A.M to the P.M I'ma WWE niggas
I'ma piledrive when I see niggas
I'ma Dale Earnhardt speed with it
I'ma take the fall before I leave nigga
Getting hella greedy, had to go and get it
I'ma take the mozzarella and the cheddar while the pan hot
Watching out for all the landmines
Planning on building an empire, make it sky-high in my spare time
Tell 'em I feel like a king, tell 'em I feel like a God
Terrorize you and your squad, like a montage
All headshots, tell 'em R.I.P with this monologue

Had to build it up and make it bubble
It's a miracle that we got through the struggle
It was hard enough so niggas act like they hard of hearing
When you elevate that's when they start revealing
We divide and conquer, taking out the weak
I got the sonic sounding fucking magnifique
I don't want helping hands, I do it manually
I'm a fucking monster, I'm a damn beast
On a campaign for the deposits
Mind frame like Chris Wallace
Staying on point and pocket
Working like I'm eating Top Ramen

Imperfections,I.C.a.B.S.,2019.0,"Give you my love, give you my heart
Give you my soul, give you my fucking all (All, all, all)
Pray we survive, livin' high
In the sky, hope we never fall (Fall, fall, fall)
Reachin' the limits they told us we never would
Never imagined we ever could
We wanted everything we seen
Lookin' for the truth that's in between
We survived and that's by any means
I believe we can do anything
Make a way and find one if it don't exist
I been down, I been out, but I never quit
I been lost in the sound of these melodies
Good Lord, it's a beautiful tendency
My intuition has been tellin' me
Don't buy the bullshit these niggas are sellin' me
Please, yeah

I got no fears left to adhere
I just been goin' through these growin' pains
The motions
It's up and down, you win some, you lose some
Shit, it's all the same
I know
No one is perfect
What's your purpose?
Hope you find it 'fore you go insane
Just remain focused, stay humble, and be grateful
It could all change

Peace is attainable if you believe in yourself, nigga
Money, it comes and it goes so don't focus on wealth, figure
Uh, you could be average or rise to the occasion
If you open up your eyes you'll see this life can be amazin'
You can get anything you want depending upon your persuasion
What I learned is it's a marathon, it's all about your patience
Don't get sidetracked and stall out from other's expectations
You'll be fine, give it time, make sure that you dedicated
Don't let setbacks define who you are, stay motivated
Positivity's infectious, let that feelin' procreate in you through everything that you pursue
It's true, but only if you knew that anything is possible
There's nothing you can never do
Uh, yeah

I got no fears left to adhere
I just been goin' through these growin' pains
The motions
It's up and down, you win some, you lose some

Admit it, deep down in your soul you know you feel it, you feel it
Admit it, wander all alone you lost your vision, admit it

You got all that you asked for, what you want?
Enough ain't enough, There’s still a void

Admit it, the place you’re in is dark, no sunshine in it, that's not living

The Jungle Book,Subtle Meditation,2018.0,"This old jungle looks mighty dangerous

Pressure turn you to a diamond ,or it can make you bust
Survival is a must, nigga trust
When you feast in the jungle you know it's no love
First come first serve
Watch out for the vines, poison their souls
Watch out for the low hanging fruits on the floor

Yeah, I just try to rise above it, 'cause I know you are what you eat
I know these bastards covert everything that's makin' them weak
I pray that there's a heaven, that I see eventually, created in his image, that's the game that they gave to me
I guess we bought into the half truths, and full lies we've been told our whole lives
So tell me what that make us, farther from our maker but close to the ones that hate us
The disconnect is real it's like we're spiritually naked
While I dwell on the spiel that I'm spillin' while feelin' vacant
My community was a victim of Ronald Reagan, crack killed the unity of blacks like a shotgun
So if you got a pill, nigga I suggest you pop one

Pressure turn you to a diamond ,or it can make you bust
Survival is a must, nigga trust
When you feast in the jungle you know it's no love
First come first serve
Watch out for the vines, poison their souls
Watch out for the low hanging fruits on the floor

Dear God, how come you don't care about us?
Is it something that we did to make our existence rough?
Is there a reason that you chose to make our conditions tough?
Is it because we never pray or talk to you enough?
I know you are the omnipotent and we just the recipients of this piss poor planet
I just can't understand it, it feel like nobody give a fuck they ignoring our pain
Took my grandmother for my brother, he ain't the same
Gave me suicidal thoughts that always run through my brain, like Jackie Joyner-Kersee man I swear this race is insane
Won't you pass the olive branch or baton, and move on
If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong, don't sound the alarm

Pressure turn you to a diamond ,or it can make you bust
Survival is a must, nigga trust
When you feast in the jungle you know it's no love
First come first serve
Watch out for the vines, poison their souls
Watch out for the low hanging fruits on the floor",https://genius.com/Kaan-the-jungle-book-lyrics
Test of Will,Requiem For A Dream Deferred,2019.0,"The stars aligned the day I was born, immaculate conception
January 12, '91, man what a fuckin' blessing
I'm grateful for this gift of life, my God, let me express it
Through a heartfelt message and authored expressions, I'm pressin'
Reflect on life lessons, realizin' I was the essence
Assess a certain presence, repent and pass the deceptions
As a convoluted youth feeling useless, my adolescence
Was filled with insecurities, self doubt and depression
Arrested Development like Michael Cera as I delve in
Self sabotaged all my progression, it's sheltered, I'm dwellin'
Trying to make a song cry, my heart swellin'
When you give 'em the real but they want facades
I gave 'em my story, they couldn't sell it
Without antics or co-signs, that shit is not compellin'
Told me I needed a hook, my shit sounded like one long acapella
I felt like Jay, Big and Dame when they started Roc-A-Fella
I wanted to make a Reasonable Doubt, they wanted more Hawaiian Sophies
Felt like the wind was taken right out of my sails
If my records never sell, does that mean that I fail?
If I do a million shows and no one shows up there
Venue empty, thinkin' no one cared
Terrified, I'm scared

Can't live in denial, the truth I gotta face it
I'm just living on a day to day basis
Where I'm at in my career, shit I hate it
Every single thing I'm recording, it sound basic
Voices in my head yelling ""Patience, patience""
Nothing ever happened overnight, be patient
Voices in my head yelling ""Patience, patience""
You gon' get everything you deserved, be patient

Just keep your wits about you, never let those dim
I know you hear them negative thoughts, nigga, don't give in
Don't embrace the darkness, nigga, that is not your friend
In fact, that's probably where your life gon' end
Never break or bend
If there's no room for you to sit at their table, go make your own
Build a throne if you willing and able
It won't be easy but Rome wasn't built in a matter of minutes
It took practice, persistence and practical thinking, my nigga
A level head'll take you far if you got a tactical vision
Just act on it, nigga, go put your plan in action much quicker
And it's gon' take some sacrifice, might have to pass on that liquor
But hard work is worth the pain, that's what makes you strong
So press on, pray, this takes time so pace yourself
No one ever made a billion out here chasing the wealth
Failure builds a nigga character like nothing else
'Cause no one's perfect nigga, if that helps
Well I hope that it does, 'cause if you can get this shit outta the mud
You'll come to the realization nigga that it was actually love
'Cause nothing's given in this life, everybody got it tough
The ones that made it kept the faith and never once gave up

Can't live in denial, the truth I gotta face it
I'm just living on a day to day basis
Where I'm at in my career, shit I hate it
Every single thing I'm recording, it sound basic

Nothing ever happened overnight, be patient

Once In A Lifetime *,UnKnown,2014.0,"My older brother said when he was young that he felt all alone
My father was never home, he was roaming the street couple days on end, was a fiend for a fix, he was hooked on the hit till the moment I was born, hit the light bulb switch quick
Rehabilitate himself to an alcoholic, couple years that a man shit gets much worse, because of time that I'm on earth
Born in a trailer park me and my younger brother D run right
Off 175 and Jessa mothafucka
We had roaches in them kitchen cabinets, instead they asking my mama: ""Why is Kevin absent and hardly ever home""
Because he left our house at 15 and was leaving us alone
Said he couldn't deal with my father and ventured out on his own
So then you move us to the suburbs like that shit supposed to fix the pain
The fundamental problem still remains, so everything's the same
When nothing ever changes and you're leaving real feelings upon the surface, constantly told you're are nothing and you're worthless
All I really wanted was some love, but it's not what I received
When the pain overceed that it turns into drank
Hit the dank till I pass out my face, feeling like I need to see my strength
God damnit, can a young nigga think
Looord
Just give me a minute or two
This the realist of shit that I've written for you
And I'm breaking it down while describing my plight
Depicting my pitiful life
I'm stuck in a cycle, no-one is essential
My father and mother were fighting, were yelling the top of their lungs
Eventually I would get numb, just turn up the television, they're yelling again
""Bitch if you be slamming them doors, I'm putting my foot in yo' ass and knocking you down to the floor and I'll do it in front of them boys""
It's the pain we can never avoid
I'm searching of filling the void that resigns in the depths of my heart and I swear that they tear me apart
When I look at my family tree I been seeing the hate that we truly protest
I confess that I'm far or less from perfect
The purpose of the mothafucking track is attack and distract, be exact with the fact that I'm momentarily living
I'm only giving you  as my innocence
Something is really interesting, that you prefer the ignorance
When I supply the 
It really wasn't feasible
They said I was remedial
Graduating them gradual levels are not foreseeable
Being deceive-able as non-agreeable
Meaningless attached, but attached to my pain
They probably take it in vain
Nigga you should be ashamed
Don't you know that I'm insane
Created my own lane, but I came to the inclusion
That fame and fortune is monetary, completely unnecessary
I'm guessing it really varies
The different peoples opinions that live inside our blitz
Growing up a nigga house which sounds like this
Heeey
Happiness is for a moment, my pain last forever
I'm a suicidal psychopath schizophrenic nigga with skeletons in my closet, couple bodies in the cellar
Rummage through the Holy Bible trying to get my shit together Laaawd",https://genius.com/Kaan-once-in-a-lifetime-lyrics

Feeling like I just might lose my mind

Originality, that's a rarity from what I can see

Philosophically Socrates
Socking these sad satches I'm sodomizing the tracks
In my laboratory this labyrinth
Conceives like Mary Magdalene
Immaculacy at its finest
Fortunate this force of rhyming
Found an outlet , no I ain't done with you yet
My therapist says that I'm crazy
Maybe off o' my rocker
I read her lips while stalking her
Through my new pair of binoculars
50 feet from her house, in high heels and a blouse
Just feeling out the situation
Tryna see what it's bout
I might break in and then abduct her
While she sleep on the couch
The blinds were drawn, my mind was gone
I'm on some whole other shit
I'm off my meds
The voices in my head they tell me to kill
For real

They tell me I do too much
I say I don't do enough
They say that I do
I say that I don't
I know what I want
They tell me that I smoke too much, I drink too much
I tell em I don't drink enough, don't smoke enough
They tell me that I sleep too much, don't sleep enough

I roll one up
I roll one up

I think I'm outta line
Cast away your fear, but you're out of line
Rap until they hear, but you outta lines
Passion always here, but I doubt I'm right
I'm after all that's near, but I'm outta time
Sign the dotted line
Don't make me go that way
I'm feeling Shady
But here lately my shit cold like Dre
I got a lady but she hate me, thinks I've gone insane
Now can you blame me, I'm so crazy
Empty so no brain
I'm feeling low like snakes
There's plenty me's no more days
I make it bleed no more veins
You can't see through all my pain
I'm on my knees at the bank
Up the river full tank
Of gasoline with the flame
Think I'm in need of a pill
My mind at ease for the day
I wake up fiending for thrills
Did I make peace, what's the deal?
My mind diseased, I'm so ill
It's make believe when I'm well
I think I'll pick at my will
Making the devil a deal
Hope I stay heavenly still
Staying ahead of the game
Ayy

I say I don't do enough
They say that I do

Lemme reflect, all my regrets to accept

I swear that I'm singing a song of seclusion
I felt like that was relief a word of release
I painted a picture of peace
I pray that when I am deceased
My pain will have ceased
So I can feel finally free
Anything that I would ever put up on the page
Is a problem that's all taken for granted
And if I do whatever that I really wanted
I would give you something real
But you never understand me
And imma be the greatest motherfucker

With a real dark tone
And his home is a canvas
But he can't stand it
Livin' with his fears got a young nigga manic
Damn, I should be in a much better predicament
Crying for help but nobody would listen
And I need forgiveness of sins I'm insisting
The way to survive I can see my descent
I'm suppressing emotions I feel like its hopeless
Every thing is a joke it's a lie
I refuse to believe on the things that I see on the surface
It seems like its solving your problem
When you at the bottom
You don't have an option
When there is no one left to call
And I'm finding it hard to create an identity
Fairly sedated and mentally scarred
It's a mark I will carry around as a constant reminder
I wanted reciprocity I never found it
I'm living alone and severely depressed
I'm deciding to end a terrible existence
Lawd, eh

Yes Lawd
(Sigh) eh

Wakin' up and paranoid, terrified scream
Been a mighty long time since I had a nice dream
Every thought in my brain is so evil
I cannot deal with these ignorant people
Try to deceive me by tellin' your lie
What I feel is the flow and the word you presented
Get it by yourself as the way a nigga got to
Never let a motherfucker impede and stop you
Can't be somebody that just sits and watch
Must not seem weak there's no time to think
I give you all that I am as a person
I pray you receive it as something that's positive
If I effected your life in the least
I would like you to think that I am realistic
And not pessimistic irrelevant sinner
Provided the image of purer intention
By giving you love in the similar sentence
Departed the flesh and my spirit has left

Medallion,Heart Shaped Melody,2018.0,"I got a medallion in my pocket, in my pocket
It's got memories of you inside it, you inside it
I hid it in a place where you can't find it, you can't find it
I wish you would have stayed but I don't mind it, I don't mind it
I got a medallion in my pocket, in my pocket
It's got memories of you inside it, you inside it

I wish you would have stayed but I don't mind it, I don't mind it

I wish you would have stayed, ahhhhh
These memories won't fade, ahhhhh
It's secrets but baby you're a guard
I wonder who I am and what we are

I got a medallion in my pocket, in my pocket
I lost my memories, now I can't find it
I wish you would have stayed but I don't mind it
I found it in a cage but trouble locked it
I got a medallion in my pocket, in my pocket
I lost my memories, now I can't find it
I wish you would have stayed but I don't mind it

It's secrets but baby you're no guard
I wonder who I am and what we are

Nigga when it rains, it pours
Shouts to days, not a ray of light in sight
Clouded, my vision is
Most my thoughts polluted by wants, not needs, shit
I need to find perspective but I wanna smoke and not think shit
I need to go outside but I'd rather record this record, shit
I need to take a day off, but I wanna record this record, shit
I need to call my mother bu-, and still I'm recording this record
I need to practice what I speak
I need to think things into existence
I need to stop overthinking to begin with
I need to stop feeling the need to wanna be accepted
I need to think past 27 to get my shit together
I need to believe there's more than just this current existence
I need to stop looking for answers and just accept the ones that's given",https://genius.com/Kaan-medallion-lyrics
Horses,4/29/17,2018.0,"Bitch you been fat, where you been at
We could take it to the kickback, where your friends at
Oh you missed that, we could fix that

Bring your people, are they single
All you gotta do is mingle, are they friends though
You wanna party, I can start it
We could make it go retarded, how you want it
We could throw a  starter, '91 shit
We could listen to the Carter, Wayne the truth bitch

Ay, ay, ay oh yeah
I love the way you sound when you say my name like that
Y'all fuckin' disappeared, have no fear, we right back
Bout to incite a riot when she move, how she shake that
Shit, I heard it's cheaper to keep her
More expensive to leave her
Said I ain't got the cash to buy, can I get a quote on a lease
And man I'm cool wit' what I got
But some want it all like Alicia said
I told her do something strange for the sweetest taboo, ooh
Hit that sweet spot, make your knees knock
Won't leave disappointed, that's a fuckin' guarantee
I, make your head will bang on the wall, that's a B5
Slim frame jeans fit, tight  Levi's
Baby do you smoke, you know damn well we high
Me, myself and I well, we been on the skydive
Space cadets, Summa Cum Laude, valedictorian
Gone back to the future like I'm ridin' a Delorean
Enough of me to go around, I wish that there was more of ya
One on one experience, you obliged to experience
Talents I got a few, to tell the truth, it's more a myriad
And I would love to show ya if you're serious
But that's only if you're interested, whaaat

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now what a wonderful concept
You seem to lack the vision like context
I think a little bigger than compact
I'm ready for combat
She got them itty bitties, the titties
I like 'em skinny but the booty be on fat, like Nicki Minaj fat
I pity the mini that tryna mention my enemies
Killing anything easily, I don't send 'em no empathy
I don't need to pretend to be kind, I'm in when I need to be
Can you tell me where K.A.A.N at
He probably in the back with them Backwoods
He brought a little pack for the fat blunts
Look how they hit you back 'cause your  sucks
My cash up, like when her ass up
I'm pipin' her down, she really likin' my action, licka-licka-licka
Pose in the bathroom, then go make me a statue
Kinda diggin' my fashion
You're illiterate, a little bit tacky
Say ""What's up?"" when you pass me
I'm in love with the money
But money never did nothing but let a chump get a bag
I'm a self made, get my mill' paid
Motherfucker up in L.A, feelin' healthy
Man I love it when the bills paid, don't you feel me
Got a budget, I don't feel fake, on the real babe

It's all fake and I've seen it with my own eyes
Dark times, depressed, I mean I might be
Making it outta alive is unlikely, cold and lost and I know where you'd find me
The pressure amounts and makes me think of death
I smoke and no it don't relieve the stress
I read the book of psalms and tried to rest
My mind is running rampant, no control if I die today what happens to my soul
Only god can judge me, -is you even real?
Understanding why I feel the way I feel
My heart's in twos, broken, battered  and bruised, a bit confused
I've been looking for a way this path I've choose has lead my ass a stray
If i cease to breath -I'll never feel the pain
Can't see the point in power and fame
I'm a humble servant working like a slave
I don't mind, 
stealing bread, out the mouth of decadence
This life, it doesn't lead
Ay
This hopeless nigga, shit

My Nigga,Abstractions,2017.0,"My nigga sent me a text and told me ""that shit is dope""
And I really wish he was with me so we could roll a blunt
You like my brother
The only one I could ever trust
Your words are wisdom
Gave me the confidence to not give a fuck
I came a long way from rapping in the blocks
And even with all I've done I still have yet to do enough
I owe you more than you could ever know
The only person in my life that ever encouraged me to pick up a microphone

If I recall correct the scene I set is seldom seen
No longer smoking in my whip in front of your apartment
Lost in a piece that was blaring inside of my honda speakers
I still reminisce to the days when our lives were harder
I wish that I could take it back to those simpler times
We never knew how good we had but we know it now
Used to be thick as thieves but now it's just a random text
I used to hit my partner up when I was under pressure
I grab my pack of cigarillos hit that nigga Boozer
The point 5s for 10 and the 01 for 20
Ain't had a lot of money
As long as I had my nigga
We trading stories embellishing every single fact
I put the beat down
Kicking my feet up and then I would rip it
And murder this shit it's just me and my nigga
Ain't nobody can tell me different I
Wondering why I was so distant
Back in the day it was just me and you
But lately I've been alone
Doing this shit on my own

My nigga sent me a text and told me ""that shit is dope""

I owe you more than you could ever know
The only person in my life that ever encouraged me to pick up a microphone

2010 we was working for that minimum wage
We needed weed money and dimes for pocket change
I reminisce upon these times when I'm by myself
These time of moments I reflect I swear it never helps
Couple of years my nigga packs his bags for basic training
He had to leave to reach his full potential I respect it
But deep inside I was jealous and selfish I confess it
The first verse that I recorded you was there with me
While in that homie's apartment freestyling just for fun
We thought we had it figured out but we ain't know shit
But when you left I started to see to your point to put everything that I have inside of the music
No longer wasting my time when I wake arise with a purpose
The person that perseveres is peculiar to these procrastinators
Begging for all the nonsense
I embody the knowledge
I want a song to be successful and happy, capisce ?

Inner Thoughts,UnKnown,2017.0,"Cashflow on the beat

Starin' at this paper tryna think of
Something deeper
Make you see from a new perspective
Resolution look clearer
No, preacher, please I ain't perfect
My purpose I purely stated
And say it like affirmations
I done fell more than a couple times
Balance ain't my cup of tea
Battling my inner demons
Tryin' to find some peace of mind
Piece together stanzas and poems, call it composin'
Combine these thoughts and emotions, record em they call it flowin'
I make the truth a priority, substance within these sentences
Substantive subtle sequences synchronizin' my sixteens
Uh

I bet you feel it that's the sound that got the rhythm (right, right)
I'm tryna make a way in the world but there isn't (la, la)
Take a hit and then relax, it's got me feeling la la
Got me feeling la la
Got me feeling la la
I float and fade away inside my mind, mind, mind, mind
I go and stay away inside these lines, lines, lines, lines

Upon the passage is these stories told from the past
A great example of how to move and what to do when you get involved in these situations
You get to where you going, don't choke when it's time to pass it to you
Miss the finger roll to your goal twice like you Pat Ewing
My shit ready rock, your shit Betty Crock
Bet he crack under the pressure like falling towers
Turn to rust and rubble, rush into your shallow grave
Back and forth, my guillotine, swing-set with the silhouette
More soul than negro spiritual, sang for the motivation
Just to make it through the day
Overcome this living hell
Crying out for help like SOS when we can't save ourselves
Lost inside the deepest depths, to dive you might want to take a breath
That shit leave a scar that ain't gon' heal, you must ain't heard me yet
Don't you ever feel like, don't nobody understand me here
Yeh
Don't you ever feel like. don't nobody understand me here

I float and fade away inside my mind, mind, mind, mind
I go and stay away inside these lines, lines, lines, lines
These lines",https://genius.com/Kaan-inner-thoughts-lyrics
King Shit,Requiem For A Dream Deferred,2019.0,"Everybody needs a song to sing
Even those out of tune
Everybody needs an inspiration
And I am glad I've got you...
You...
You...

Some of the sickest shit I ever conjured inside my mind
Unable to reproduce the feelin’ twice, it's like my passion died
Noose around my creativity, literally hog-tied
Stories passed around a campfire, they tellin' tall tales
Embellishing all truths, if facts a fact it should all sell
We tippin’ the scale and settin' sail, the score should be settled now
We lost inside this 
matrix
, still a maze we can't figure out
Coordinate with this compass, it's incumbent we pick a route
Immortal the way I feel, I'll live forever through word of mouth
I said it was never a problem, not an option to make a choice
I don't see any signs of weakness, or me and mines peaking
Your strength is in your faith, it all depends what you believe in
Believe it

No standing stagnant nigga, nah we been takin' off
Movin' like 
Dukes of Hazzard
, hit the gas with a loud exhaust
These niggas movin’ backwards, it’s a shame that you fallin' off
We leavin’ legacies, the writin's on the wall
And when I die, make sure the world know my name nigga
Sarcophagus in all gold like a king nigga
Ain't nothing changed, immortal forever I shall remain
The throne I leave as I can see these false prophets claim

I give it away and then I collect it, revive and resurrect it
The climate's now congested, the game has been infected
They feedin’ you bullshit so how the fuck can you digest it?
This acid reflux substance disgustin', disguised as 
Tussin
And they throw it on everythang, genetically modified
Descend when it's putrified and it's found where the devil lies
The truth has been crucified, crosses beared as we breakin' down barriers
It'll take more than a couple bullets or stab wounds to bury us
We the last of a dying breed, the bereaved and the ones forgotten
From the bottom, niggas is plottin', every apple in the bunch is rotten
From a place where the sun never shines and the hues is darker than 
Gotham
Where niggas use everything but words to solve their problems
Knowledge

No standing stagnant nigga, nah we been takin' off

Dukes of Hazzard

Make an angel feel evil, I rock the mic like Beanie Sigel

All this pyro, look at my spiral, niggas don't like me okay
First that bible, shoot it at 5-0, I head West from OK

See Nevv got big dreams, need that big screen, mama see me on Letterman
Bye bye groupie, on to that new thing, who the fuck you better than?
 whole gang with me, writing my own commandments
Spit that blicky, push that six speed, never need no commanders

Okay, now sit back and chill, for thrill we grab the wheel

Like crocodiles snapping on bitches, I need a mil'
Need that rocker feel, still rock a nigga like Holyfield

Better get this shit correct
Niggas just ain't close to me
Daddy was on that ship, boy I been dope since I wore dungarees
Hungry, rummaging through empty cabinets and cupboards
Hunger pains is humbling when you go to sleep eating nothing
Watching that Monday Night Raw, with cigarette stains on the wall
Rock Bottom, been there before
Stone Cold the world turned a boy
 fall my hair off when I think 'bout all that pain we endured
When you hit them lights in the middle of the night, roaches scatter 'cross the floor
Niggas never had much but the bills add up
Gotta make ends meet or you end up on the street
Niggas  surviving, taking off 
'Fore the day that I leave, what I need to see
Maxed out contracts Joel Embiid
With a standing ovation, the kid is a beast
Let me unleash, watch y'all retreat
Til I see them ends nigga I don't sleep
Nigga I just eat, y'all can watch me feast
Never fall on my ass, I'ma land on my feet
Ten toes inside the concrete
They listening when I speak
In tune for the recent dissertation
Pay attention or don't pay me no mind, god

Feelin' like I left and abandoned the place I'm from, nowhere to call home

Tip-toein' around the issues, dancin' with the devil
Wishin' for the best and hopin' everything gets better
We done fell a million times but tell 'em we still get up
That's how the game is set up
I'll get battled 'fore I back up, screamin' ""Fuck the funny business""

Niggas claiming false kingdoms and kings get they head cut off
I'll let it resolve, I seen the writing scribbled on the wall
Compose my thoughts and think over a glass of Pinot Noir
From afar, I seen them waving the flag for truces and calling it off
Come to collect like Curtis Jackson, bitch I came for it all
Shell-shocked, you see we leave 'em in awe
Mouth on the ground, hope they pick up they jaw
Shall I point out your flaw?
Your plan was fucked from the jump so you never had a chance
You fell flat on your face, that wasn't happenstance
Tell 'em to get right before you get left
Taking these chances, taking a stance
Taking my time, don't let 'em waste mine

Feeling the pressure, feeling the pressure, feeling it fucking all
Feeling the bumps, feeling the bruises, bouncing off the walls
See I survive through 
raging tides
 I know that there's a God
Far from religious I'm just intuned with my spirit uh
I came so fucking close to giving up
My toughest critic in my reflection, I can't look at you
When niggas was down and out, shit I just kept on looking up
Can't throw the towel in yet, I know it's gon' get better bruh

I pray I land on my feet
I pray my future not bleak
Pray my potential is reached
Pray I don't suffer defeat
I know the devil is calling, I pray we don't meet
I pray the Lord protect me from evils I can't see
I know that money breeds envy, hatred and greed
The wicked smile in my face and plot on me
Lord keep me in your grace, I pray for peace
I pray that I don't die before my time

I feel like it's simple, shit ain't complicated
I'm staying positive through all of the negative connotations
Protecting my spirit and energy, I know I'm obligated
To be grateful and thankful, feel like I've been highly favored
How we go from two room trailers and feeling like failures?
Shit I came from same clothes daily and negative savings
Shit I went from feeling so vacant, I ran out of patience
And shit I went from blasphemous, shameless, proclaiming it's greatness
I mean I couldn't tell you a lie, I gotta give you the truth
Can't take the credit for my progression, I was lost and aloof
Baptized with my first rhyme, I was reborn in the booth
A testament of will and faith, I'm an example for you
Said it's true, you can do anything you wishing to do
Yes it's true, everything can change, it can get better for you
If you knew, the pain it's only temporary, let it all pass through
The only thing we can do

Pray my potential is reached

I stay high to get rid of the lows, so I rarely see 'em
I been movin' around with a lot of patience
Ain't a man that could do this the way I do it
Knowin' I don't like it, said when I keep growin'
And I was only inspired by my influence
Wrote a flow so they all feel the sentiment
I'm makin' sure that it's evident
Ground up, like the sediment
They proud of my environment
Burn one with a lighter and
My Gs started exitin', excellent
No way you could F with it
We make it look effortless
They all gon' remember this
Hold up, I got smoke in my lungs
Roll up, nigga, that's just because
So lost that I never feel much
In tune while they all out of touch

I take my time when I do this
Back and forth from state to stadium
Nigga, only spittin' that true shit
The real prevail, the fake will fall
So what I provide to y'all is that true step

I won't listen to you lies, lies

Better options, can't name one
Better profit, might make none

I pray hard that I don't go nuts
I got heart but I don't know much
Blame it all on older stuff
Damn, my logic's holdin' up
I get nauseous holdin' grudges
I adopted more than one
Imma pop like corks with bubbly
Fix your posture, carry more today
Ain't no losses, open yours today
Now I got to thank the Lord to pray
For you, your crew and yours today
We don't need no news about war today
Hope that , when I reach high up
Like me, 'til you see what's under me
There's life inside what's on your mind
That's right behind, stop struggling
Imma light one up, no more to say

I won't listen to you lies, lies
I stay steady gettin' by, by
And we gon' stay high
And we gon' stay high
And we gon' stay high
And we gon' stay high
I won't listen to you lies, lies
I stay steady gettin' by, by
And we gon' stay high
And we gon' stay high
And we gon' stay high

Heard you boys falling off, shit you blew it like a tissue
I got a headstart, taking off like a missile
Too official, shot my shot like a motherfuckin' pistol
Got me feelin' like Isiah when he played for the Pistons
Call me Bill Laimbeer, high steer when I drive it
Think I lost my mind, won't you help a nigga find it?
Never waste a minute, time precious like a diamond
Just let me remind you bitch, I rewind this shit
Got 'em askin' where you find this shit, it's astonishing
My shit hotter than the climate is in, they fond of it
Keep it moving like kilometres, never stoppin' bitch
I just might hit that eject button quick
I just might roll up a blunt 'fo I dip
Motherfucker please, look I do this shit with ease
It's a whole lot of yous, but that ain't that many mes best believe

I've been cold since a nigga was a toddler
150 proof drippin' out my baby bottle
The Juice on the Loose, it's a motherfuckin' problem
I'm running like OJ, the attitude of O'Shea, okay
I'm energized off the weed, ya dig
I need this shit, you can take her I don't need the bitch
I see a cheque, I'ma chase it, might leave the bitch
She said she love me but you know I don't believe the bitch
More bounce to that ounce, make 'em shake it
I apply the pressure, yeah a nigga might break it
I don't even wanna buy it, I'ma pro rate it
Might lease for a week, bring it back and you take it

God dammit I'ma renaissance man, I'm just playin' my hands
You live in the stands, you talking but you really a fan
Niggas pressed for a look, don't know what to do wit' it
I'ma double check the plan 'fore I even move wit' it
I've been grindin', my shit's alignin'
Walk in the jungle with the lions, feel like a giant
Giving out orders like a tyrant, don't stand beside me
Blowing up like a kamikaze in Benghazi
Ticking time bomb status if you ever try to cross me
Movin' at a high speed, heart cold, icy, might freeze
AC Collins in the Bronco with a wife beat
Will they ever catch me nigga, no that's less than likely

They will be put in place in the name of our safety
But our freedom is well increasingly vanished
We will trade our freedom for safety
We will allow our right to eroded because
The authorities tell us it will keep our children safe

Maybe someday a future man will look back on them

The clean cut lines make it decent for digestion

My mind is in a more positive state, no mediocrity
I massacre, murder, i mutilate but do it modestly
Apologies to anyone offended by my honesty

My style is more Odysseus dancing for degradation
Ignoring the regulations to get to my destination
But never with hesitation i'm taking this trip alone

Independent with the vision and focused in on the mission
With no intentions of ever becoming dependent on ya

How many times will you keep faith in the process when it isn't clear?
How many times must you fight your fears?
How many time will you get up when you fall?

The gift of life, boy, ain't it nice?

Hard to survive in this climate
But your senses is heightened

But first, I humble myself
Gotta put my pride to the side and let it just fall by my waist
I might fall flat on my face

Never complicated, conversations keep it simple
Practice makes it perfect when I murder instrumentals
Treating my body of work just like a motherfucking temple
Assemble the fleet with the symbol that y'all recognize 'til the vision comprised and the villain arrive
Or the killer revive with a sick epidemic that's never dependent
In fact, in a panic, it's affecting appendages
Wrap it in bandages
I can dismantle that
We gon' need more penicillin, prescribing the feeling
Reciprocity properly reelin'
Recited the affirmation for the special occasion
Evading emotions elated
Forsaken the polar relation
Related the fate of the track in the back
Or the fact it was fat
 with the fragrance conveying the word I created
Mistaking the statement you making from hatred
Are you unsolicited and evaded
Repent for your sins at the altar
You fucking with me and my sound nigga, not in the least
For my shit ain't generic, it's more esoteric
Compare it, that's if you can bear it
Embarrassing, you disappearing
And bombing the beat I'm impairing
Evolving 'till I'm incoherent
Immersing your mind with a merciless groan by a merciful lyricist
Taking it's time, I'm meticulous
For a particular politic
Popularized by the power of following trends
I hope that my music offends
I pray that I take every one of your fans
You can tell I'm the shit by the way that I stand but I came with a list of demands and a letter for ransom
That's really provided that you can supply the amount I've requested, a minor investment
Now why are you testing my patience?
I want all the  in your pockets
Your cheque and your wallet, your earrings and watches
So give me a bracelet or else I'ma break it
But if you do not let me take it
Then your blood will leak in a crease in the pavement
An ambulance needed, but I give a fuck if you pray

Attention when a young nigga speak
No sleep
I ride, write another rhyme with a certain subtle aspect
You could never mask that, I attack that
Better detecting when I rhyme so fast that your mind couldn't grasp that

I break it down to molecular origins
Originated maniacal ordinance

Tell me what you expect
In a  concept
Fascinating content
Get the people convinced I'm the shit
You can probably smell the scent through the vent
Got a nigga hellbent on tryin' to be the motherfucking greatest that has ever did it
Difference is the effort that I put up in a rhyme
A ninety degree line
Perpendicular
These motherfuckers looking parallel

With delusions of grandeur
Like niggas survivin'
We just complyin' with our hands up
They still gon' shoot us down cause they can't stand us
The paper bag test we ain't passed it
I must've missed the master classes in the midst of madness
Was too consumed by the pressure of sadness
Alas, beating myself up like a heavy bag
Everlast, nothing's ever good enough my criticism's crucial
Tryin' to find some common ground that we can stand upon that's mutual

Nigga what you thought it was?
Made the proper adjustments adjusted this fuckin' matrix

A day to day basis is how I move on
Could go deep like 50,000 feet below the surface level
Get straight to the core of the issue it might get too hot
But I'll dig a little deeper til you tell me to stop, ah

Time moves on, I know, I know, I know, I know-oh
And you and I, In time, In time, will grow, will grow-oh

Woke up this morning had a conversation with
My maker no mistaken he said my purpose is this
That's my intuition talkin' I'm gon' listen to it
He said I showed you the way, but yet you still ain't convinced
This rap is much more than a passion it's the way that I vent
I keep my feelings bottled up behind emotional tint
The times I roll in currency then that explains why I'm spent
And thoughts can manifest that explains why I feel like shit
Stuck in this self-imposed prison for a life sentence
Life's a Rubik's Cube 4 corners small prism
This shit's simple addition don't treat it like long division
Yes I been on a mission just listen and you can feel it
I got too much on my plate overwhelmed
How can I help the world when I can't help myself?
How can I save them all when I can't save myself?
That's the million dollar question that I still ain't cashed in

Time moves on, I know, I know, I know, I know-oh
And you and I, In time, In time, will grow, will grow-oh

I used to be a pawn in the game
Now i change my position
If the end is near
Then send it here

Instead these niggas give me no credit like Scottie Pippen
And say it's trash cause I'm different, fuck em

I tried my best to take the high road
But I don't know the address to the high road
So I got to come at ya
I tried to bury the hatchet
I went and shook your hand and said you're doing a great job this year
I though that would be it
Leave me alone man, I got a lot of ammunition man
Stop man, leave me alone
I tried to take the high road but I don't know the address",https://genius.com/Kaan-wrap-lyrics
Paid in Empty,The Middle,2017.0,"I said I'm back in this bitch
Bringin' the flow that I got
Killin' em all, yes I will
Leavin' em dead where you stand
Better than most, this I know
I'm doin' it all, you can see
The God, a beast and monster
Be the artist see that I'm more, refuse to conform
When I perform it's not the norm, it's a standard
Hittin' innocent bystanders with this ignorant grammar
Now figure this shit out, 'cause I will bounce
As I leave them in awe
I resurrected on the Sabbath like a sacrificial relic
Rest in peace to the evils
I kill my pride and my ego
Leader by nature, I am
I don't think they understand
I can't complain about the cards I'm dealt
I'm playing my hand
An average man that's motivated, doing more than the most
I pick up the pen and I use it true
To give you the beautiful music
In the pursuit of happiness like where the fuck my muse is
I'm giving you all that I got
I'm taking away from the funk
Supplying a feelin' they couldn't replace
You in love with the vibe
Bringin' a rhythm and hit with the base
Ain't nowhere you could hide
I'm livin' a life of grandeur
Keep your hands where I can see 'em
It's signed, sealed and delivered
Riddled with nothing but apathy
After me there will be no-one, the Alpha and Omega
Major mistakes that they making
I spoke and I left them shook
Now they open just like a book
From the looks of things I could tell
It's irrelevancy for real
What's the deal, or perhaps a discount
Knock 'em off like a dismount
Ancient Egyptian culture, they tryna to figure my shit out
Chill out like in a villa
Vindicate with the villains
Freelance with the vision
Renaissance in my sentence
Sentimental descendant
I'm stealin' like Bernie Madoff
I'll plot and play with a caper
I'm Robin Hood with the paper
There ain't no way you could hate this
Emotionally I'm vacant
My mind has been running rampant
I fear they don't understand me
I'll never take this for granted
I pray for giving you more of me
A hopeless-ass poet shit
I feel like Jim Morrison
Idolize the legends
Wishin' that we had some more of them
If sanity was free then I could probably afford the shit
Instead I'm feeling out of it
Overdosed on an Ottoman
Took a couple klonopins
Poppin' pills like they M&M's
I'm insane, is it evident?
These kids'll do the most to make sure they become relevant
But if you preachin' then you look crooked like Televangelists
The vantage point I'm speakin' from is low to the Earth
It's like a spiritual birth
I stay calm, cool, and collected 'til I ride in the hearse
Just put me twelve feet deep, make sure I don't come back
And reincarnate to a problem that you don't want, blap
The fact is I'm snappin', I'm quick to attack
I'm leaving you gassed, the reason I'm mad
When I reach in the bag, no reason to yap, boom
Make 'em all feel it, you won't see 'em again, hey",https://genius.com/Kaan-paid-in-empty-lyrics
One Time,UnKnown,2016.0,"Cold copacetic nigga I'm an artifact
Your heart attack but that don't mean you are living
Harsh reality's given, put it all in a sentence
Going hard pushing limits
I really do this I'm fluent with it
Right now it's second nature
I'm just plotting quietly cause
I am more what I am currently not the currency
Speak a piece of mind do you understand
My lingo, bingo, comprende
I'm not materialistic, my vision is seeping in
I see it like CNN
It's hard to describe it I only view it in colors
No other choice but to move on
Allow me to walk by, I swear it's a short life
My time I will spent it wise
Revise what I wanted and that's if I felt it was needed
Never try to intrude
I'm just trying to improve
I want this more than anything
So all this shit that I lose I wasn't meant to have it anyways
Now sad to see it go away
I'm holding out for brighter days
I'm quite amazed that the turn of my life has made look
I went from manual labor to lacing tracks with the truth
I gave you nothing but love even the moments I hate
No pessimism involved it's positive energy boy
I send my praise to the Most High then the blessings received
Shit I'm grateful for life I'm content to be
I feel mentally free no longer chained like the weak
Yes lawd

One time (2x)

Look
A truth teller's all I have ever been
And lately nigga I've been feeling like a veteran
Long list of other motherfuckers that I'm better than
Never say a name though, no that ain't my angle
Ain't no place I can't go
Headed to the top
They try to hold me down like an anchor
The fuck you thinking I ain't sinking I'll survive
My mind is like a genius and a poet all in one
I'm disposing foes oppose them with the power of the sun
I gets it done like lithium then lynch the beat that shit was fun
I repeat we shall defeat the evils
Fuck away from us
Nothing you can say to us
Did this shit all by ourselves with no wealth
So my apologies if I'm not amused
But what I do is not for the faint of heart
You're easily consumed by lies of deceit
I'm not deterrable rejecting defeat
Look I gave you nothing but classic volumes is never archaic
Let me display my talent so you can judge and critique
Tell me I'm not unique and then place me on a pedestal
To sweep me off my feet I realize what I have
My gift of gab is amazing I fade away with the cadence
That's why I'm leaving for now
The re-approach in a second
Hope my message of kindness has been a kindness reminder
Let me perceive with inequity game that's been sold separately lawd!

All of this is patience, I'm learning through trial and error, error
Call it like I see it, my disconnect with this era, era
Servin' you this smooth sound, jazz more better, better
Look, now put your money where your mouth is, yeah
I'm partially surprised that you would even doubt this shit
I tone it down and change my style so you could hear me clear
You know I been on this steady mission
Not missin' a step my bad
I left for the right reasons
While y'all changing like seasons
I feel like they won't get it
My tempo to slow down
But I'm still the same, dog
I refuse to change up

I'm not adjustin', nah

Thirty right around the corner for me

Like sushi please

Silent than a motherfucker
Keep it to myself
You niggas wildin' in this motherfucker
Backup in this bitch
And I got something to say, though
No habla Inglés, like Pesos
Through work think can afford the image
Words to listen, they consume this
From the womb to the tomb
I'll forever be
Chefin' up this poetry
My haiku's are a masterpiece
This bastard be off in his own world

Damn, you try'na poison me motherfucker
Eheh… Ehh, nah, let’s do it
Uh-huh, Lawd!
Look…

Oh no, y'all niggas fucked up
My style like Kukoc, release slow, I need mo'
Cock back, young nigga, like a reload
Got so Kayne back in ‘04
Four deep in the 4-door, oh lawd
Got a quick detour, just hold on
Get straight to the point, don’t prolong
Back up in it, I brought a profile
I got a dope sound, that, you can all agree
The transparency that I like to use
And my lifes a muse for these soulful tunes
As I croon this moon, I can’t be stopped
Stroke a heart to hit the sweet spot
I got a couplet, to get a company
I need a couchie mama, for this crudité
As I eat the beat like it was Crème brûlée
I got extravagant taste
No man will erase ground work that I laid myself, I got no time to waste
Need space get up off of me
Back, back, can you please give me just one second to breathe
Until the energy leaves, so I can really proceed, I said I’ll never concede
I swear to god I’m a livin’ example
Testament to a sure faith
I got a work ethic that’ll captivate ‘em
Castrate 'em, young Casanova
'Til the game is over, or you hear the whistle
Don’t stop the play, or stop competition
With a tight submission, turn them all submissive
I complete the mission, hardly ever miss 'em
Mr. Too Official, with a crucial vision
We can do this shit I know I got it bro
This shit is common sense, it ain’t impossible
And yeah, there's obstacles, but that’s not stoppin’ me
A Mephistopheles, see your anomalies is no exception, when I’m going Hercules
A Herculean effort, yes, I do display it
You should peep the cadence, cause I think you’ll like it
My shit been inviting, vigorous and exciting
Extravagantly I begin it
Pen a sentence that you’ll never forget
How to live with regrets, I proceed and progress
I believe in myself, I got faith that I’ll make it
The feeling inside, you could never replace it, or take it
Eternally grateful for all that I’m given
Every single blessin' I overlook
I’m a workaholic, no one moves at my pace
If you pay attention it gets interesting
Let me break it down, I put it in perspective
Spit a messy message, you could never measure
How much I’ve invested in the term of time
Well my determined mind, this shit like turpentine
We got molasses drippin', like I’m sauced up
Paid the pastor, boy they caught you
Never accepting the losses
Take an L, then I move on
I wanna elevate, cause I’m above that
I never sat around, you can’t expect help
You better get it poppin' by your fucking self
A small seldom few will seep through the cracks
And blossom to roses from the concrete
But it’s obsolete without concentration
Need a level head, for clear navigation
Through the bullshit or the hypocrisy
If there’s levels to this I have yet to reach ‘em
Starring off into a distant region
I don’t even really like to pay attention
When they give opinions, speaking like they know me
Niggas phony, I see that
What is heaven, I don't need that
Fuck around, my nigga, ease back
Going hard, I never relax, huh
I countered your move, with a better move
Maneuvering through it, I swear I do
I’ll never die, I reincarnate
This rap shit like Carling cider to me
Over-top of the glass like a finger roll
Got the hitch, well equipped, for the given goal
I said adjust the position to my solution
Your shit fifty-fifty, my shit 100
Tell them keep it real, I know you don’t want it
I never slack when it comes to this, nothing new to this, I just do this shit
Feel like Bo Jackson, back in '86
Young king raw, black Raider shit
Made it to the major leagues and made a name
Want the big Range, with the gold chains
Big Daddy Kane but the caine gone
Never half-steppin’, nigga, never that
Gotta let it breathe, let me slow it down
Gotta ventilate and let me hold it down
Got the remedy, I let it go around
Swear these rappers sweeter than some Coca Cola
Said I do this shit for my la Cosa Nostra
Never falling off, I thought a nigga told ya",https://genius.com/Kaan-the-ojs-lyrics

If you based it in them fairy tales stories you off

That unfiltered unadulterated

Beatin' around the bush it gets me aggravated
Shock value of the false is fuckin' captivating
But it ain't real, it's just a fugazy
These niggas is crazy they rather have their dope diluted
Don't know the source they got it from but shit they still gon' use it
Go on, heat it up heat it up grab the needle
Put it in your vein let it go to your brain
Dang music and Methadone's one in the same
It's been this way since the beginning ain't a damn thing changed, at all
It's pretty entertaining though
They give you all the tools for self-destruction inside of the videos
A manuscript made from procrastination
A fabricated image based off of exaggeration
That's like God and the Devil collaborating
Oxymoron's perpetuated for homes and car payments
It doesn't make much sense, but fuck it
Long as the kids are still willing to spend and listen in intensively
And live vicariously through subconscious imagery well then the mission's complete",https://genius.com/Kaan-subliminal-lyrics

Responded three days later writing, ""Well I’m spitting now.""
Terrified of the fall, I been living on the cloud
If a shooting star falls and there's nobody around, well does he really exist and how should he persist?
I'm just asking for a friend so please forgive me if I trip

The sanctity of you and I, where we can both co-exist
But life ain't all roses, happiness and bliss

Payed the piper for a penance

Sit in silence with the sinners

You were spending in the summer
I was focused on the come-up
I was adding up the numbers
Unstable in the struggle

I lead, you follow down the path to righteousness
Enlighten those left in the dark
With an idea that could spark
And what I fear is I'm lost or I might veer to the wrong
But I'm quite clear in the songs, if you disagree then you're gone
Never bow down in submission, nah it's never that

All my shit is straight but the competition they been gay, comprende?

I see they deceitful, it's sad to say we'll never be equal

We been spreading positivity to the negative, I give two fucks
Niggas hate like the Klu Klux
In reality they don't do much
Fuck 'em all

So if I come off to an asshole as a dick
That's my astringent
I ain't worried about you sus' ass niggas, nah, never that
I got the goal in my sights like I run it back

Chew my words like food for thought, let them digest as I speak
If I give you all I got then what shall I gain in return?
Except for pain acquired and another lesson learned
My aspirations is to fly, your aspirations is to burn
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, we must all wait our turn for sure

What the fuck you thought?
'Cause it ain't what you think, it's a difference
And the game based off opinions
But the ref got bumped before you entered
When your real ideas diminish
Shit ran out might replenish
But you can't 'cause your ass got censored
How to operate in a rigged system
Can't play the victim, never been an issue
One to the temple, two to the face
Four L's rolled, nigga say your grace
Stay in your place, better be cautious

Sixteen seem pristine, who lost it?
Last time I checked, motherfucker still got it
Still a couple steps ahead, with a couple meds
Like I'm on the edge

I'm making a murderer drugs are nigga you reaching

Unforgettable I've been told, save your heartfelt momento
I'll never forget I'm dopest mind the mic can hold a terabyte

Authenticity, no apathy left in this altar bitch

Inaccuracies are actually engulfing em

A comparison to my flow is a running fountain
Took every lesson and learned from it
I done been through some shit that you couldn't stomach
Niggas thought I would fall off, I couldn't plummet
I kept playing my hand, that's a dirty dozen
Feel like DMX, I just don't know what they want
And I might not pop until I'm thirty something
Only thing a nigga ever needed was the intangible shit they can't take from me

Your surface level well man like you treading on the water
I should step it up a level but there really ain't a point
Imma relax with a blunt and watch a movie in the zone
Find me posted in the cut they call a nigga come along
Spitting fast upon the beat, i separate it then adjust
Justified the feeling for this fortified and pretty pure
If you coming with them games, get the fuck up outta here
But let a nigga make it clear, i fear nobody in my presence
They say they want the realest, evident that i present it
Melodies and fancy fills but i pray they can see the message
A method to the man is a secret imma keep it

The Reality,Requiem For A Dream Deferred,2019.0,"All of my days, all of my nights, all of my life
Fightin' to right every wrong when I went left
And stepped off the beaten path
Karma come around faster than you think
Knock you on your ass
Paper trail, a nigga leave, with devious deeds and missteps
Tryna recover, regroup from the setbacks
The shit that's out of your control, it gets hard to accept that
And all of the missteps
My biggest fear is that my time came, and a nigga missed that
Positive thinkin' ain't gonna replace what I gave up
Or reinstate your confidence from the fact you went against your common sense
The truth is hard to swallow, it don't come with no throat lozenges
Narcissist by nature, naive to believe in the soul surroundin' me
When we all drownin' in the same sea
The highway to hell or the stairway to heaven?
Who really knows?
Beautiful pearl gates or the sinner fire and brimstone
I won't atone for my current existence
The need to survive is the rule of thumb
Peace and prosperity secondary
And I can see it clearly
They kill the messenger nowadays
They ain't tryna hear me
They pigeon-hole me, clip my wings
Really try to kill me
Then when you die it's just posts readin' ""R.I.P""

Talkin' 'bout they feel me
Talkin' 'bout they feel me
That shit cold, ain't it?
That shit cold, ain't it?
Talkin' 'bout you feel me
How the fuck you feel me?
That shit cold ain't it?
See, how the fuck you feel me?

They told me patience is a virtue
You gon' learn through your failures
When you fall, you on your own
Nigga, don't nobody help you
But don't complain like it's the end of the world
'Cause they move on quicker than they gave a fuck
You replaceable, bruh
This ain't no over-the-top, grandiose statement as such
It's obvious, that's politics, there's stipulations with love
It's here today and then tomorrow shit is gone with the dust
Protect your energy, don't give it out to strangers
That's how you end up endangered
The remainder of your identity dissipates
I been keepin' to myself as of late
I can't let you dine off of my mental plate
And leave me to starve
Soul-searchin' as I look at the stars
Within this instant I'm lost
Givin' so much of me that there ain't nothin' left for myself
When they're done usin' you they throw your ass right on the shelf
No longer needed, past your date of expiration
Why yes, tryna keep my head above water
Breast-stroke like Phelps

This shit cold ain't it?
That water cold, ain't it?
So how the fuck you feel me?
That shit cold ain't it?
Eh, say how the fuck you feel me?
Say how the fuck you feel me?

Can I speak loud enough?
Maybe I'm out of luck
Maybe I'm stackin' up
Maybe I'm not really down for much
Maybe I pack a punch
Can't really add it up
Can't want it bad enough

Got 'em all acting tough
Gotta stick my passion up
Gotta tip them glasses up
Gotta make the best of us

Who the best? Who the greatest?
Who the brightest and newest?
Who the coldest? Who the dopest?
Who is missing and truant?
Under-informed and over-influenced, there's too much consuming
They wither away to nothing, we blossom, we shinin', we bloomin'
We modern day martyrs, we marchin', they made us targets for marksman
My motive has been the same, it's to make a livin', survive and prosper
Maneuver through all these traps they laid out for me to falter
Reachin' farther recently, realize that I can't get caught up
These mind games that they play are straight from the mental slaughter
The lion's share that they fightin' over, fortune's unfoldin'
The Mayan calendar saying that it's already over

They gave us false prophets, is there even an 
ayatollah

Never wakin' up from a dream
Never wakin' up from a dream
I just fade away
Never wakin' up from a dream
Never wakin' up from a dream
I just fade away

And I just fade and float away from you
The almighty, most highest, who I'm speakin' to
You got an issue with this truth, then I'm gon' pray for you
I never catered to the lies, I can't attest to those
True believer in this shit
Cigarillo roll while I was stretchin' for the finish, bitch
Close my eyes and let the Lord take control of these sentences
Repentance through my penmanship is plentiful, Lord
Pick yourself off the ground, you're looking pitiful, boy
Like where's your pride at, don't hide that, this spiritual text
I flex on my vernacular, hundred percent on my test
I feel like a fuckin' king, don't want no crest on my chest
I got this shit all by my lonely, I'm gon' need my respect
I got a plan, it's foolproof, I couldn't fail if I tried
I got a hustle that's revered, I work with all of these guys
What I supply is peace of mind, this shit is food for your soul
We livin' in some crazy times, this world is out of control
But I'm still playin' Makaveli, dissecting the message
The Don Killuminati theory no nefarious shit lawd

Never wakin' up from a dream
Never wakin' up from a dream
I just fade away
Never wakin' up from a dream
Never wakin' up from a dream
I just fade away
Never wakin' up from a dream
Never wakin' up from a dream
I just fade away
Never wakin' up from a dream
Never wakin' up from a dream
I just fade away

Now take me back to clear waters
Where your sons and your daughters
Got no fears of no monsters
Yeah they young but they ain't takin' no losses
Ain't no scarin' the process
Don't compare it to all us
Who haven't quite tasted the freedom
Why don't you sip it up
(It's divine water baby)
I need a bigger cup
(We could drink it all, baby)
I feed my spirit til I hear it like a beating drum
(Oh bo-bom, oh yeah-yeah-yeah)
Know where your heart at
You workin' hard at
Workin' so smart that
This test don't hurt you
You gone so far past
These pests don't bug you
The rest will hug you
The best will love you

You'll bless 'em won't you?
You'll bless 'em won't you?

My nigga, you could fall, fly, die, get high, or float
But either way it goes
My nigga, you could fall, fly, die, get high, or float
But either way it go, you know

Loss of hope is a reaction to reality
Your happiness is not contingent on your salary
You could have everything you want but nothing that you need
The most miserable people usually have everything

Life's finished before you know it, blink your eyes and it's over
I hope you reached all of your goals and that your focus was sober
I hope your pain turned into passion and you profited from it
I hope you put your past behind you and you find peace
Refining
The intricacies of this life
A 12 round fight
The bell just might
Go off before you get your big shot
Your time ran out, you feeling like you missed out
An idle mind's a terrible thing to have
Especially when it's filled with doubt

My nigga, you could fall, fly, die, get high, or float

Replace stagnancy with a purpose
Before the man upstairs, decides to close your curtains
And call it a night
I guess life is a paradigm or a puzzle that we don't understand
Still unable to comprehend, you may not like your hand
But that's the one you're dealt, you gotta deal with it
You better play your cards correctly 'cause the next one will
One man's trash is another man's treasure, you dug
If you unable to see that, well then it's on you
That mean that your angle is off, you got a fucked up view
Your perspective pathetic, the fuck is you gon' do?
Ay, look, I get it, I get it, it's hard to hide from the truth
The lies a temporary fix, like a Cortisone hit
And don't get down to your issues
You know, the deep rooted tissue
You know, the shit that affects you
Kill you off, don't resurrect you
Just leave you dead where you lie
'Til your potential is dry
Couldn't get it right this ride, but maybe the next time

Cause nobody loves me it's true not like you do (2x)

Crumblin’ herbal and leaf to relieve stress
Thinkin' of ways to elevate my status
No goin' backwards
The underdog is comin’ through
I tell 'em step out the way
Pass the baton I'm goin' long
And you can't keep with the pace
Most of these rappers sound the same
Like they read from similar scripts
Recycled lines tried to recite but end up bitin' your lips
Don't need no pen to document, I use a morphine drip
My mental strength my mind control more like a Morpheus grip
Illustrious shit, they call it grind these niggas busted this shit
No trust in this shit, one moment they love you the next they forget
They knock you off your pedestal it's back to regular shit
Like 2 9-to-5’s behind the counter
Cash register customer service takin’ orders
Countin' quarters no 7 G’s
Serve a number 5 with extra cheese
Please place the napkins in the bag too
The rent been past due for the past few
In a tight spot with a bad view
Yes lawd

Cause nobody loves me it's true not like you do (2x)

You better tell 'em I'm a cold blooded prototype
My paragraphs can paralyze
My pen and pad can petrify
Your petulism’s pesticide
That's poison poured in portions
I'm poised to point out these parasites
Present the light amongst the darkness preachin' the truth
Loose in the booth like untied laces
Mind racin' turnin' pages
Pacin' paintin' pictures peace and paraphrasin' barely breathin'
Gave it all I got inside me rapid fire kamikaze
Aim it then I hit the target captain of the ship I got it
I often use the flows as decoys
Decipher the words of this author like W.E.B. Du Bois
I said that I'm back with a vengeance nigga so kill off the noise
I'm makin' a vow on repentance all of the praise to the boy
I'm over-analyzing stressin' 'bout the lyrics
Not the analytics views and listens
Intricacies intimately involved with every sentence
Rhyme after rhyme line after line I kill this shit
Time after time inside my mind I'm feelin' like

Out of my head Rmx,UnKnown,2017.0,"I show you how to do dis
No talk about the author
I'm often lost, I'm often gone, I'm often off this
And I'm often honest
I'm an honest author, all of me I've put into this
Never gave it up, I never strayed away
While you was givin' up, I tried to make a way
I'm in a different state of mind
My god, but I really want it all
Yes lawd, I can tell you less them all, you know
Stressing, vision blurry, uncertainty ensues
Certain-ly, you understand what I'm going through
Search and seizure, my spirit's been stolen, I couldn't find it
Or find a slice of the pie that suffices my appetite
I'm polite until I feel hunger pains
Make 'em jump just like House of Pain
Hunt 'em down like the Hunger Games
Starving, that's not an option mayne
They tryna take the food off my plate, in front of my face
I'm wondering how much can I take, before I just break
And murder everyone in this place, and all that they'll say is

Can't get you outta my head
Can't get you outta my head
Can't get you outta my head
Can't get you outta my head

So what's the reason and purpose you do dis?
I beautifully explain my story but through the music
I gain some insight
My pen well..., shit
I ain't write this
These random thoughts that I ramble
My shield to see
No weapon formed against me prosper
The dollar that they covet, seeing like it's life itself
Deflecting insecurities, 'cause you don't like yourself
You like the wealth but you don't like the work
Was lead to the water, yet you still died of thirst
It hurts

Can't get you outta my head
Can't get you outta my head
Can't get you outta my head",https://genius.com/Kaan-out-of-my-head-rmx-lyrics

Said it's envy they disguise behind them fake congratulations
If the window to your soul is through them dilated pupils
Then yo' spirit is off, yo' intentions filled with convolution
Niggas runnin' in place and confusin' that for startin' movements
Makin' traction, makin' plans but lackin' action, fuck up the law of attraction
Ass backwards, imaginin' massive amounts of whatever you seek
Meanwhile we posted at the mountain peak
Ate some shrooms out in 
Maui
 then came back and hit 
Manhattan Beach
Put some 
potent flower
 in the 
fronto leaf

A silent seed, a quiet storm, now I can think as waves crashin' in front of me
Complacency just ain't my

But on the contrary, I went beyond my means and did what was necessary

I'll never die, I will be felt, energy multiplied
More than a mortal man, I'm an extension of the hand of God
Still abroad, mentally I'm gone, niggas been living it large
Pushin' it through the setbacks with more drive than a foreign car
Coupla scars, bumps and bruises adds character, take the flaws
Niggas ain't in the game, y'all watching from afar
Still unsure of who you are, still a tourist in this thing just passing by
Must stay awhile for your words to carry weight
You gon' need your opinion verified, not no 
blue check
We doin' boot checks to see whose laces torn and discoloured from getting they feet wet
I pass the 
Litmus test
, I attest I'm a testament
A test of will, a test of strength, a test of faith
The bitter taste of takin' the backseat and puttin' your dreams on hold
Of getting your shit together so you can get back in control
Revenge is best served cold, preferably à la Mode
How the fuck can you block my vision, you don't even know my goal
How the fuck can you stop my mission when we on a different road
Just sittin' reapin' the benefits from decisions that I chose
Outside the box, you can't define me, nigga yeah I broke the mold

Most days, I be in my thoughts and they cloudy
Most days, I be in the space of ""fuck all y'all""
But these days, I been thinking ""oh it could be worse""
My God, it could- it could cease to fall apart
All lost like a waste, oh yeah
It could- it could
But I think I'll be alright, I'm okay, yeah I'm straight
Motherfucker I'm good

Tryna reconcile and recollect my thoughts now
If our future's bright as stars then won't you tell us who we are
That's no facade, just keep it real with me
To be honest real is rarely recognized
The feeling's putrid now, no it's a mutual
No common ground to stand on
We can't see eye to eye
Unable to communicate, we lost the meaning of life
Now tell me what's life without that?
A whole lot of years we don't get back
'Cause we just couldn't see the bigger picture
We just overlooking all our blessings
Add a little light to let it shine
But I let it dim 'til it seem candescent
Unsustainable, these lies are
In the corner, standing like an armoire
You ain't tough under all of that armor
Fighting with myself, screaming ""En guarde""
In a battle of wills I am unscathed
In the mist of the madness, I'm unphased

I'm bound to  it up
And down, it makes the balance more than promising
I'm in the mountains, tryna catch my breath
I'm wildin' out again
I'm buggin' out again
You heard that sound and hit the ground
Drown in a percocet
I been the worse, I'm feeling cursed
Running these lines like cursive
Don't care about none of y'all
I curve that drama 
I need to run it off
It's perfect timing searching for my purpose
Why can I keep learning
Time ain't worth the purchase
Purple smoke is burning
Heard the dirt, it don't concern me, working on these verses
An early bird, I murder demons lurking
This like a circuit

And this surpassed those that look down on us
Transform like Voltron, the pressure's on us
Seize the moment, end the day while you delay
My DNA is filled with the realest, huh
Unusual to hear but I speak to ya
You used to hearing all the facetious stuff
But this the truth so go an' turn the speakers up
Real loud, young nigga shut it down (down)
Been around and what I found (found)
Tell me what it means to you
Is it clear the point that I prove
Now my mind state is in tune
Now I can't waste my time, I gotta move
Now a small taste of this new sound
Niggas turn it down to keep it all away
A hundred to couple all my rounds
Might just elevate us to the lime life
Or hype life like a highlight
That's what I like

We live that high life
We gon' make you turn around and run
Enjoy that limelight
We gon' turn this city to a highlight

Take the largest share and then I'll take some more

Anti Intellectuals,I.C.a.B.S.,2019.0,"You have to understand how things are up here
So then, in the, uh, situation of the zen community
Safeguards are set up
Within which, you can learn how to act without deliberation
Which is in, see, in a sense
Going back to the state of innocence
Now it doesn't mean that you give up thinking
It doesn't mean that you become an ""Anti-Intellectual""
You all can also learn, and this is part of the later phases of said training
How to think spontaneously
How to deliberate spontaneously
The saying is, you see:
""Stand or walk as you will, but whatever you do; don't wobble""
So, this is our difficulty
Because the human mind, uh, ha- is a feedback system
Feedback ha-has a peculiar susceptibility to nervousness
There was a young man who said;
""Though it seems that I know that I know
What I would like to see is the eye that knows me
When I know that I know that I know""",https://genius.com/Kaan-anti-intellectuals-lyrics

Why you wanna rush? Always in a hurry
Don't you wanna live, enjoy moment?
Why you wanna hit fast-foward an pass it?
Don't you wanna stop then smell the roses?
Why you wanna act like life is short?

Tryna make it fast, but can't make it last
Tryna live up to the highest standards

Inside is a soul, it's reflection, yeah

Have a couple homes, still lost
Buy a couple of cars with no drive
Can't fix what's on the inside

Maybe this go round might be different for me

Lord my shit is polarizing
These snakes in the grass that bite your ass
I call them

Judas Priest, I'm a beast that's makin' no revisions
Losing my religion, captivatin' is this crucifixion
Fixated on record sales that's coming posthumous
Preposterous, all my shit is proportionally propositioned
'Cause this the book of psalms
Not a song of contradictions
Saying seven Hail Mary's
Massacre my competition
An outcast with a pen
Refusing to be a victim

Losin' my sanity, handlin' my sobriety
Propriety, I had some demons I had dealt with priorly
Attempted suicide
A casualty of society
Dodging the notoriety
I need my medication
A case of social anxiety
Giving you ambiguity
And questioning Christianity
Amnesty in this vanity
Writin' a holy trinity
Sinnin' in this affinity
Affection for the usury
Blasphemy in the jewelry
Reflections of my savior is shining in yellow diamonds
Left in Sodom and Gomorrah
 
insidious in deceit
Beelzebub showing love so this the mark of the beast

What I'm sowing is what I reap

I die to trust trifles with rifles to crucify disciples
It's vital this villainous spitter was never vindicated
Commercializin' religion my sermons are syndicated
Serve like Erick Sermon conservative lyricism
A psuedomyn they assumin' I'm skimmin' off of the total
Gregariously precautious automatically sporadic
I made it to the top of the world I'm lettin' 'em have it
I came equipped with a shovel so I could bury the bastards
Prefabricated a grave so I could bury 'em faster
Emotionally detached, dismemberment with this hatchet
The escalator to Hell, through agony and disaster

Float,UnKnown,2017.0,"Well alright
Yes lawd, knowledge, at your service

Let me set the tone
I'm not down and out
I never have doubts I only have faith
I never halfass I only give my all
What I present to y'all is like lithium
To get your mind right
If you a little off
I've been ten toes since came into this
I'm like a demigod within the demographic
We could make a cult for what I've cultivated
If you follow me ya live to the life
There's no dirty sprite within my inspiration
Just a fixation on the unattainable
It's in my reach but man I can't grasp it
Tell em when I speak the speech sound graphic
No leech, ya bastards
I'm a basket case so when you're about faced with these masquerades
Ya gotta let me breathe
As I assess the field
These niggas 'bout nothin' like Seinfeld
Just a bunch of Kramers and product placements
Tellin' lies that we disguise as truth
You say the sky's the limit then someone lied to you
I see the bigger picture and the grand scheme
But it's a larger frame that I view prove
The room for improvement is a constant problem
Never settle for lesser
The flow is oppressive
Now watch me press up with the focal pressure
I left it all with my apathy
I need a masterpiece
 young Michael Corleone
Orchestrated with consiglieres
I'm incorporated
Re-enact it all, make sure it resonated
Long to the soil I got a sweet serenade
Young black renegade, step back demonstrate
Let me make the case and state the deposition
At a loss for words I mean I truly am
Let the beat ride for my train of thought
When that writer's block sinks in, yea
When that writer's black sinks in, fuck

I said now I'm just out here grindin' on my own now, my own now
Workin' by myself like I know, I know
I'm back I had to hit 'em with the dope now, the dope now
I am on a cloud but not alone, not alone
Say I doze away, and my mind escape
And I fade away, and I move through
I move away, and my mind escape
And I fade away, and I move through
I move away, and my mind escape
And I fade away and I
I fade away and I
I fade away and I

I can tell you what you got with this one
The realism make em stop and listen
I, talk shit for a second then I write back
Tight with a nice rap
Move back, I snap, high step
Like a heisman on a boom bap
I get straight to the point, y'all don't do that
I guess livin' in the dark is amusing
I digress then I get lost in the music
Time for action
I do proceed so I can visualize it like a movie scene
We gon' flood the market 'til we make it happen
It's the only choice
We got no options
Fuck all opinions and discriminators
I diseminate and then disintegrate
The indiscriminate, they try to scrutinize and tell elusive lies
They weren't euthanized
We in the land of snakes
Where many serpents lay
You need to watch your step, and proceed with caution
Keep your wits about you, head on a swivel
Put your blinders up and stare down the middle
I got tunnel vision, never lackin focus
I'm a foreign breed to these famished vultures
I'mma let em starve and self-deprecate
They try to ease the pain and self-medicate
Because I came up off of writing truths
Screamin who the fuck is you?
I, came back when the beat dropped, stay the same they believed that
I never changed I don't see that
What they selling, I don't need that
Style too pure, you bet your bottom dollar
I can make em fall back like they in autumn
Hype as high as the vertical of Vince Carter
Stone cold when I flow
360, pristine, i'm insisting my instincts assist this
I lays on wax like lips to Blistex
I'm lit like incense
I've met your intents, so meet all my sins
I'm straight as white lines on track pants
I'm trying to play the field like pac-man
The set like Bruce Smith, the kicks like Bruce Lee
But smooth like Bruce Wayne
My shot KD, in the ruggedness in the middle of the summer
Let it rain down
Step back, hit the three and shut the thing down
If i'm makin an appearance, I make it legendary
Give em what they ask for, but never less than
I can transmit a transparent piece of art (x3)

I said now I'm just out here workin' on my own now, my own now
Grindin' by myself like I know, I know
I'm back I had to hit 'em with the dope now, the dope now
I am on a cloud but not alone, not alone

And I fade away, and I move through

This my last letter to my loved ones
It says sayonara, it was nice to meet ya
I'm at the mountain top with warm green pastures
Or the purgatory as my life flashes
I close my eyes and take a deep breathe
I'm screaming ""fuck the world!"" I don't need stress
So I'ma cock the pistol then I pull the trigger until I flat-line and I breathe less
My God, you left a nigga terrified, mentally paralyzed, stuck in a paradigm
And I can't sleep, I need more pills, I'm havin' nightmares, it seems so real
From havin' premonitions of an early death
To gettin' no rest like an insomniac
Give me a prophylactic and a Cognac
That shit'll calm me down and keep my soul intact
And as a matter of fact, I'ma toe this line
'69 psychedelics try to bring back that feelin' of real
That's all that people used to feel
When music was from the soul, and money didn't control the arts
A sick integrity compromisin' the quality
Profitizing from all hypocrisy and your honesty
Givin' you my opinion for feelin' indifferent honestly

This, a cold world that we reside in
Currently confirming that society focuses on currency
A deterrent, assurin' this affirmation of evidence
I previously said it was regulated by confidence
It's all actual competence
Knockin' over the contents of my anti-depressants
Right next to my will and testament
This life I live of sin is what my soul is invested in
A nigga can't turn back now, I'm a veteran
Slow it down, slow it down, slow it down!
Nah nigga let the mothafucka breathe though!
In the garage with the door drawn down
And the windows rolled up
Exhaust fumes goin' off
It's carbon monoxide
As the common denominator
Desensitizing my mind
And immortalizing my spirit
Emotions within my lyrics
Soliloquies from a purist
I hope you mothafuckas feel it

As you dive in my mind and indulge in my fears
While I'm lookin' around at the stares of my peers
And these voices I hear throwin' daggers of hatred that's piercin' my ears
Causin' pain when I think
I'm drownin' myself in this bottomless drink
Someone tell my mama I'm drunk as I've ever been
People applaud an irrelevant gentleman
Softer than gelatin
Generalizing the general gesture of jealous content
Consumed by assumptions of lucrative functions
Material nothings, I don't understand it
Confusing illusions felonious imagery
Glorious truth I deliver through symphonies
Sonnin' these bastards like backwards in infancy
Die in the moment and live in the infamy
Hol' up, speed it up for a second
Like a nigga was ridin' off, and now hear the bass slap
Drank drip on the curb when a mothafucka pop
They playin' pocket full of stones like it's a mothafuckin' anthem

Dead Wrong Rmx,UnKnown,2015.0,"I'ma try an' do this
It's Josh Sallee
I did
I did, huh
I gave them a minute
That's probably too many
For y'all that don't feel me
Just fall back like 
poppin' a wheelie
Through PA's
But, nah, not from Philly
I got heat like Schilling
I'm not no one, really
Just thought I should kill this, then did that
I push on that pressure, impressive at profiting, sure
Offer the audience all that is over obvious don't
Like me and K.A.A.N., we should probably be on
What's taking so long?
They playing your songs
I hate everyone
Why'd I go do this again
Just to confuse up my brain
Like summer moving to spring
Some can just do it, some can't
Yeah, never too soon to be great
But better be sooner than later
'Cause someone blooming each day
But, never you so, what’s the wait up?
Need a break, I work my ass off man, I'm adamant
It's like bad breath
I'll outsmart them, I'm 'bout my biz, I doubt you is
You full of it, we left watching like that house of kids
My references miss like that gown and kiss
Stern on being private with parts of life, Howard did
Over tower them, block me out, Howard them
When I'm out, I get uncomfortable like laying down on bricks
They counterfeit, faker than your body shapes, yeah drop them grapes
Call me king, and after that you can call me great
Old me goin' away, new me always late
So how I'm s'posed to operate if both them walk away
Like, call in sick today
Let's make history
Go a different way
Souls can liberate
Hold it in a way
Blow it in a blaze
So what's wrong if I don't do shit today
I'ma do me, that's over anything
Run from my problems
I'm OJ Simpson-in'
Show it to my boss
So, there's no coincidence

I will terrify you with a sicker trance, and then paint a canvas with a can of blood
I'm in a canopy, I got a couple victims
I'll deprive 'em all, I need no assistance
And your nervous pimpin',  I will start dissecting
When I grab a weapon, it's a fuckin wrap
And when I hit the lights so that the room was black
I got a razor blade, I got a few knives
I got a broomstick for when I sodomize
I'm in a bad space, I mean mentally
And the only thing a motherfucker really wanna do is cut your throat and watch you leak
If I do speak, then I will degrade ya
I'm a man of hatred, but I truly love it
And I'm off my meds 'cus I don't need a pill
I wanna rape and pillage, I'm a fuckin' monster
When I pick the victim and I torture them, but then your face is pale, it's new porcelain
So call me Jack the Ripper, young savage nigga
And I'm tearing tendons, but I take my time
I got a temperament with no rational
I got an attitude, I wanna see violence
Shoot the school campus like it's Columbine
We'll set a memorabilia for the commissary
So we in the prison, in the common room
And I'ma tell the story of a mass-murderer
And the way I move like 2 cat burglars, but the saddest part is that I got the verdict
I'll be in this motherfucker for the rest of my life
I got no bail and no damn hope
I'm chillin' in my cell, they won't give parole
The habitual killer, he wanna slice them all
They try to medicate me with some Propofol
But I'm still wylin' and that's protocol
And I'm on a mission, 'cus I wanna recall
But if I break it down, then I can make ya vomit
Move in silence, should be placed inside asylums
 Sodom and Gomorrah
Tried to warn ya, you're a goner
I am gonna elevate, hesitatin', not me
Try to describe 'em but I can never depict 'em
When I mutilate them I take two pics
One Polaroid and one for my mind
But don't worry 'bout me nigga, shit I'm fine
You could take a listen to my deposition
Murder a nigga, the body in Florida
Yeah, he was screaming but I am dismissing it
Get the fuck out of the car
And I am hearing the sound what had came from the trunk
And I go to the back and I open it, popping him right in the mouth
And I'm grabbing the rope and I'm tying him up
And I'm still trying to think so just shut the fuck up
'Cus it's already done and I'm feeling offended, you offering funds
So why you insult my integrity, you had no leverage
Hurt everybody, yeah that's what the message is
Thought I was thinking while taking some Mescaline
Minding my business, I keep to myself
Suffocate people you say are the best
I'm no one to test, especially when I am stressed
My head is a mess
I'm having a vision of death, the duty is mine
Myself I oblige, I'm in full effect
My flow homicide, when I am correct
Yes I'll see you later, as I disintegrate ya
Dismember like a butcher, now you about to meet your maker
Chop your flesh and then I toss it on a piece of parchment paper
Six to two, that's what I do
A dirty dozen from the baker
Bake a cake and then make you eat it, put it in your face like anime
Animate it like anime, órale, what the hell he say
Vamanos, we should probably leave
Bodies leaking a liter, got blood on your Mamacita and the clothes that she wore
I hit the stairs as people stare, there's cartilage in your hair
As collagen and bodily fluids coagulate boy
And of course I caught me a corpse in a corridor out in Corpus
Christie
According to court order correspondence and documents
Looking for the motherfucking exit shit, it's my time to leave
I gotta disappear, I said I don't adhere but I wanna make it clear
I got no fear nor reservations
My lonely soul is in a different world and I'm a distant poet with a prophecy
And my proper form is like a masterpiece with no appreciation 'till I'm deceased
Spot you, now I gotcha, lure you into my trap
Enter the function, ain't no fuss and I'll be quick to attack
Taxing that ass, I'd take a sword and slice it right down your back
Hattori Hanzō with a combo, I crack a couple of vertebrae
Verifying my strength with the scent of death in the air, I appear and punch a medulla oblongata for wisdom
Make an incision but it's empty, nigga what a surprise
I know they wanna see me fall, quick to embrace my demise
I'm going on a killing spree, I got blood lust in my eyes
But don't you step into my cellar, it would leave you surprised
I know you don't want anymore for when I step through the door
I've been strangulating the victim on my hardware floor
Choke him with force until I take the life up out of the boy
With no remorse I mortify ya, this holy water will sanctify ya Sending liars into the fire to burn eternally
But that's if I despise ya, advise that you wait your turn
But if Knowledge was crucified, I would resurrect and return on the Sabbath and started stabbing with static
Have you collapsing

I go off on this with Illuminati priests that sleep on cots inside the Vatican
The confidential record we've written but try to seal off
A predatorial pope with an altar boy he can feel on
Givin' you Catholicism
A spiritual type of contradiction
This is narcissistic, the prophecy's finally manifested
Through my mannerisms the majesty of this apathy
The track was appetizin' antagonizin' protagonist
Protection through perplexity
Politic'n with Parliament
Funkadelic, a relic, regardless of any reservations
Convolution was the resolution for this revolution
It's delusion givin' confusion that's never fabricated
Ashes from the blunt tumble inside the Book of Revelations
Kick it then rip it then give it a flip bet I kill it they feel it the realest alive
I'm cunnin' felonious lines, they give in their rhymes
Suggestin' these niggas is livin' a lie, I think that's a crime
That shit I despise, I'm takin' the venom inside of my mind
Then I'm placin' it right on the page
The shit that I'm writin' should leave you amazed
I'm turnin' the people to fiends
A nightmare, that vision I spit and you seein' the dream
I definitely run for the cream
In the 36 chambers of death 'til we run out of breath
But honestly I might digress
With the way that I'm movin', refusin' to rest
You can mark up the beats like a family crest
If the beat was a person I know I'm for certain
Brand all of my lyrics on top of their chest
With stab wounds for your arteries
Stories that got corroborated by cooperators
That suffer from lack of concentration
But it's complicated, responsibilities obligated
Rules and regulations I'm delegating concurrently
I'm runnin' in yo pockets and confiscatin' your currency
Compromisin' position, no wash rinse and condition
Vindictive is my rendition
With censorship and resistance
With a pen I stay consistent
But if you need some convincin'
I'm eatin' the beat alive
And I'm only leavin' you parts of it
Pardon this bipartisan
Grill that shit like it's artisan
The proclamation that like a river
My flow is steady streamin'
Liquid Swords like I'm the GZA
This nigga's a fuckin' genius
But you're never comin' in between that though
When I rip that mic, just to kill that show
Just to backtrack on black cap with a backpack full of wack raps
I'll attack that if they got a fat sack tryna get that mothafuckin fast cash
Never gotta worry 'bout a backlash
But we had a bad car crash and was runnin' from the cops
But the sign said stop and the lights turned red
Got my foot up on the gas, nigga full speed ahead
'Til the bitch broke down in the middle of a 4-way intersection
My plans been intercepted
Regrettin' mistakes in the mornin' like where's the contraceptive
I conquered your mind, you were cuckold to what I'm conjurin'
Every line is a classic like Leonardo da Vinci
Created a work of art comparable to Mona Lisa
Usin' my lyrics as brushstrokes, I let you hear the features
Comin' off as pessimistic whenever soundin' facetious
Veni, Vidi, Vici I'm supplyin' to the masses
Serenade with violins
Then devour it like Leviathan
Your hand stuck in a mandolin
While dismantling mannequins
Usin' bodies for canvasses
Shootin' sprees for your local campus
A crazy-ass nigga runnin' rampant
Heard they want it sign sealed delivered
Motherfucker I'm the one who stamped it
I roll a blunt just to deal with stress
An insecure motherfucker, let me get that off my chest
And my sanity's disappeared
I'll probably never see that bitch again

Ridin,UnKnown,2015.0,"Eh, Lawd, hah, Knowledge. Knowledge, knowledge, knowledge, knowledge, nigga. Uh huh, ridin' in my, switchin’, Lawd, huh, look

Don't touch the volume or adjust the dial
Chill for a while with my faculty, I mean exactly
When I exude the heat beseech the beast or treat the beat
And this the makin' of a masterpiece
I’m motivated military mind-state that a young nigga have
And I pray I never pass and I do not have the time to relax
When I'm puttin' my life inside of a track, that's a fact
Real rap, I attack until the topic is tackled
I dabble in fine arts, you wonder where did I start
By undertaking the issue from understanding the plan
And then I'll be available I never been a nigga that would
Gain an advantage by given semantics
And sayin' somethin' I don't really mean
I’m a fiend for the truth
Your general negativity was hidden nepotism
The prism of relativity timidly you attempted
To terrorize with a sentence I see the pain in your eyes
You give an efficient vision, then pray you can survive
Propriety of the mind, our spirits never align
I’ma call it how I see it, divinity of the rhyme
My lines are a tyrannical temper tantrum of tongues
Articulate poet composin' devoted to the process
Lyrically impeccable gettin’ rid of your nonsense
The only thing that I would ever stress is the progress

Ridin' in my mothafuckin' car, I'm switchin’ lanes
I'm prayin' to the lord above, hope he eliminate my pain
I got a dollar to my name
I don't know how to make it through the truth
I'm broke as fuck and stuck and it's the month my bills are due
I cannot handle the weight
I cannot handle the weight of this world on my shoulders
I cannot handle the weight
I cannot handle the weight of this world on my shoulders
I cannot handle the weight
I cannot handle the weight of this world on my shoulders
I got the weight of this world on my shoulders
I gotta focus and work with composure, LAWD!

Never paid attention in class
I couldn't have understood the importance of givin' everything inside ya
This is a reminder, that when you got a goal and a dream
You better chase it, but you might need blinders
Put the past behind ya, try to lighten your load
Nobody said it was easy, believe me I really know
And I chose to be a loner up on a solitary row
The pain a nigga was feelin' I wrote it to get exposed
Listenin' to Makaveli created my own road
Like a story that was told to the flower that had rose
From the concrete, on the wrong street
In a raunchy environment riotin' with the rest of the crooks
To reside at the level where niggas are tryna settle
But you only recognize the cracks in their stems and the dirt up on his pedal
Not the fact that he was actually trying to make a difference you dodge him with your opinion GODDAMN!

Ridin' in my mothafuckin' car, I'm switchin' lanes

Leading you right off a cliff, when you fall you really surprised
We give you tools for success, they give you tools for demise

Soaring over enemy lines just like a paratroop

Dead Prez (Dead presidents rmx),UnKnown,2015.0,"I swear to god every line that I spit
Religious relic, overzealous from the flows that I flip
I'm keeping it real
I said in the moment I feel
I'm giving you all of my pain
I wanted a way to regain
The sanity everyone else had been taking in vain
I feel like I'm losing my soul
Achieving a goal
The way that I'm living is cold
I murder my foes
Or anyone that would oppose
The rhythm in which I compose
And now I dispose of ignorant nonsense
Every day I was hearing the content
Wondering if you were given a conscience
Never believed in the lyrics they conjure
How do I conquer?
Putting my life on the page
That nigga was giving you honor
People like Common, they only think about commas
Nobody cares for your problems
Pick a position to play, and practice your part
That feeling inside of your heart, you never ignore
We taking  to explore
Attentive when asking for more
And for the most part, I'm Mozart, Belafonte and Bogart
Imposing, giving you classical
I'm masterful and magical
The depths of my emotion is devotion
What am I really divulging?
Giving into my impulses
What about focus, nigga they already know this
As I eliminate simple acts of intelligence
Talking televangelist, my hands upon the bible ah!
I open the book and I look at the chapter
I'm a legitimate bastard
Causing disaster, leaving that lyrical madness
Staying away from distractions, never attracting
That was an overreaction, digging inside of my faction ah!
Praying to Jehovah, asking him to grant me inner peace and bless me with some happiness before I'm finally deceased
My soul was sanctified by the soothing sound of the symphony

I'm out for presidents to represent me
All they care about is dead, , I'm a titan, nigga
Hit 'em with this light gun, I enlighten niggas
You ain't gonna light none, you ain't sparking a thang
You a little light, son, always guarding your chain
Since my Gram left, I ain't been right son
In the dark, just waiting until the light come
And I'm just contemplating all the things I've done in my days
I'm obsessed with getting paid in a couple of ways
This year, I done doubled my days to keep the work up
We pushing through the struggle and pain, sometimes it hurt us
But people dying daily, how the fuck I'm 'posed to feel?
I've been ducking from these labels while they tryna close the deal
I ain't finna sell my soul, not for none of these devils
They be biting off my style, here's a wannabe medal
And my girl always saying she gon' love me forever
I done made a few mistakes but I wanna be better
Ain't nobody ever say that I was perfect
But stick around, I promise I'll make it worth it
I give you everything I am in these verses
It's my purpose, I knew it before my first kiss
Living in a time where you gotta be afraid of the cops
'Cause your skin color black, they gon' laser your top
Every day the headlines show another nigga blazed
Tryna give us  or they want us in the grave
I'm already dead
I'm already dead

I'm out for presidents to represent me

Oh how the mighty have fallen from high graces
I'm just trying to stay on track in the front like braces
This life is a marathon, we been running through the mazes
Trying to stay the same through the changes
Oh well, I guess that everybody's going through some phases
The quest for validation isn't painless
It's because we just looking for acceptance from strangers

I'm running round trying to find myself, I am
The best I can, my nigga I'm just playing my hand
Can't buy into this faulty system, see this shit is a scam
A devious plan to leave us all dead where we stand
I can't reiterate, regurgitate the folklore
That make you feel criminal all because that you want more
While you watching these screens with things seen in your dreams
This shit is human nature, don't we all want cream?
Generational wealth passed down to offsprings
Financial literacy is not a small thing, like damn

At any given time we could trade places
Oh how the mighty have fallen from high graces

This life is a marathon, we been running through the mazes

Oh well, I guess that everybody's going through some phases

My generation stuck in debt and we can't get out
They said by 2050 that there might be a drought
A catastrophic incident that could take us all out
This shit that we inherited and can't do nothing about
These politicians heretics and they consumed by greed
Human leeches and they feasting off of you and me
These bloodsuckers play with numbers so that they can succeed
Rig an election in succession on the quest to achieve
The truth is filled up with the bullshit you like to believe
We only see the shit they want us to see

At any given time we could trade places
Oh how the mighty have fallen from high graces
I'm just trying to stay on track in the front like braces

Half Way Through Psalms 1,Losing My Religion,2014.0,"Now I've been workin' like a slave, perfectin' my lines
Makin' sure this automatic flow can blow your fuckin' mind

Now let this mothafucka rise until you feel the soul
Now let this mothafucka rise until you feel the soul
Now let this mothafucka rise until you feel the soul
To change the way the people thinkin'
Lord that's my only goal

My rhymes are contortionist analytical torture
Could stab and slash your aorta while smokin' hash in the fortress
This metaphorical fortune for which I've rationed the portions
It's all aesthetically gorgeous priority it's important
I'm simulating intercourse with the sound of my recordings
While stimulating your mind not confine do in support
It's the pen is my lifeline thy mind soul and my body
The teachings of Helter Skelter, the violence of kamikazes
But I try to preach peace when I speak like Mahatma Gandhi
The hierarchy of rap and my concepts are impeccable
Flow is highly respectable, do it like a professional
Repentance for my sins, like I stepped in a confessional
Pray for me

Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers
But his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night
He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers

Now let this mothafucka rise until you feel the soul
Now let this mothafucka rise until you feel the soul
Now let this mothafucka rise until you feel the soul
To change the way the people thinkin'
Lord that's my only goal

Fuck a platinum plaque, bitch I want some monuments
A sacrificial concubine with 12 o' clock masters
A masters and doctorate for the bastards that I've indoctrinated
Spit the body of Christ, you sip it, you feel intoxicated
Now I ain't stoppin' 'til I reach the fuckin precipice
Sayin' my Hail Mary's I'm spiritually invested
Puttin' scriptures together, I'm craftin' 'em with some message
This blasphemous nepotism is older than Nefertiti
That's evident in my rhymes and we edit that for your T.V
The Bible's my dictionary contingent upon convictions
'Cause Jesus wasn't weepin' from the pain of crucifixion
But the loss of innocence within the truth that he had givin'
My flow is Old English like it's Victorian diction
When I spit it's automatic like weapons with ammunition
I fire with repetition then I throw another clip in
And aim it at my sins so I eternally glisten, AH!

Now let this mothafucka rise until you feel the soul
Now let this mothafucka rise until you feel the soul
Now let this mothafucka rise until you feel the soul
To change the way the people thinkin'
Lord that's my only goal

The properties of distention make you mentally dependent
When you focus on the pendant instead of words in the sentence
Conceptions of this irreverence was birthed by Mary Magdalene
I'll never trust my Reverend for pedophilic malevolence
Slice the wrists of a hypocrite, spittin' the sickest ignorance
Illegal drug smoke is engulfed in my own chest
Another breath and I'ma visit Pope Benedict in the flesh
Strategizin' in the Vatican to start a new religion
They fiendin', they need it, they want it, I seen it
Said open your conscious so you can receive it
I'm spittin' the truth and I hope you believe it
I write on the page 'til the paper is bleedin'
I'm hopin' my prophecies come to fruition
I murder all men, man I kill competition
I'm breakin' away with the skill that I'm given
Get back to my roots with the way that I whip it
Get back to the truth with the way that I spit it
Your cup runneth over the way that I fill it
My style's illicit my flow is the ill-est
Just give me a beat and you know that I kill it
I studied the legends that all came before me
I'm bumpin' Rakim 'til my systems exploding
A cyst on your brain that insists on imploding
Created a movie my vision is gory
I wrote this multivious biblical story
I pray that the people embrace and endorse it
These words out my mouth are salvation and glory
But shit is a shame when no one will endorse it
I'm guessin' the money is way more important
I do it this way for some clarification
That's rarefied there in the rhymes that I've written
And all that I covet's the mind I was given",https://genius.com/Kaan-half-way-through-psalms-1-lyrics

Then add some bells and whistles with all the aesthetics they like

You fade away, or die like MJ
Your opinion doesn't matter, I don't need you anyway
I just got back from the future, no really the other day
And the world is ending soon, we don't have no time to play
And the world is ending soon, we don't have no time to play
And the world is ending soon, we don't have no time to play
Time is running out, you can do what you want
What your perspective 'bout, nigga what you on
Feel like the end of days, judgment is on the way
My meteor to take her home, you waitin' gettin' paid

Shit I'ma give you this several ways
Let you niggas choose your fate
How the fuck you lose your faith
We found a map in the same place
In the same chase in the same race
In the same lane in the same vein
That the others came
I took heat and I ran wit' it
Light speed with my tunnel vision
You niggas don't run shit
You got flat feet and don't pay attention
How the fuck you in the backseat
Tryin' to put the key in the damn ignition
No drive then you nose dive
The art of war you can't coast by
I can see the writings on the fuckin' wall
And I ain't talkin' bout a damn co-sign
You wanna take it all and I can tell that you
Wanted to find the line between yours and mine
You gotta understand that it's a battle here
But the fight is not between you and I

Nigga run it out, who am I to judge
If you can't tell the time, I can't tell you none
Won't try to sell you none, go and get it bruh
After all we all just run until the race is done

But I got a shortcut straight to the cash
You could get that check than flip (flip flip flip)
You was backstage with the passes
While I was on stage tryna get into the VIP (vip vip vip)
Niggas don't flash or impress
I could take your bitch, nigga when I dip she dip (she dip dip dip)
Mothafuckas say they real I seriously doubt
You know what the difference is
The imprisonment of mind, body, soul
The confinement will turn a nigga cold
Isolation will kill a nigga's goals
Make a run for it like a give-n-go
Who knows
I don't
Lights on

It's all fake
A nice show
The world is a constant revolvin' cycle until

These motherfuckers want you dead, I can't succumb to the odds
I don't believe in mortal man, I place my faith in the Lord
Created in his image, nigga, so that make me a God
But I ain't perfect, I'll admit it, I've accepted my flaws
I had to chill on smokin' weed, was coppin' ounces a week
I got off track and lost my focus like my vision derailed
Was in the deep, I couldn't swim, I almost drowned in the swell
Been treadin' water ever since, I'm lappin' all of these simps

Measurin' wealth by the things we can hold
And everybody measures love by the words that they told
And we just livin' in the past of a dream that we're in
And the selfishness we contain is consequence of our sins
And we're all measurin' wealth by the things we can hold
And everybody measures love by the words that they told
And we just livin' in the past of a dream that we're in
And the selfishness we contain is consequence of our sins

Wasted potential and talent, tattered and torn at the seams
Sellin' our souls for this gold in search of that infamous dream
We wanted money and power to cover pain that was given
This is affirmative action with argumentative spirit
And after kid of non-complacency, I hope that you feel it
This mirror image of imperfection is in my reflection
I'm contemplatin' suicide with an automatic weapon
This seclusion and delusion has caused my mental digression

Lead by example, give 'em all that they could handle though my shit plays on rewind
I'm tryna figure out how to get back where I left off, I'm not impressed at all
But I'm depressed of course, I'm tryna press with force
I need the world to pause so fuck a good report

As my blood drips upon a crucifixion
You're not used to this you love blasphemy
It's a catastrophe, I leave you fascinated
To the depths of Hell my soul gravitatin'
Spit sick slick shit, left agitated
An educated opinion that I give with the pen
I'm tryna write my way to Heaven, not the seat of a 'Benz
And it's amazing the way that these people believe
Every detail they see and they read
The soul of a man filled with hatred and greed
Consume all the doom of the visions he's seeing
'Cause life is a bitch it's a fact that I know
Since I'm trapped in this corner with nowhere to go
These the thoughts in my mind that I try to conceal

Look,Requiem For A Dream Deferred,2019.0,"I try not to stress so much, I try not to underthink
Overzealous opinions living inside of idiosyncrasies
Realizing things ain't really as simple as they often seem
That's the reoccurring theme, that's the overarching scheme
I had to tell 'em, hope is inside us so we never dream
Our date of birth, we D.O.A so we ride down this mezzanine
I'm surrounded by kings, queens, and fiends alike
Chained together, shackled by this struggle life
Peeking around the goal with blindfolds and no GPS
I turn on my TV less
I'm searching for truth in excess, I still haven't found it I guess
Perspective is perfect, I'm blessed
Long as my heart pump in my chest, I'll push and I prosper
Propel myself through the problems, I'm in control of my conscious
I've come to terms with the losses
I'm not concerned with the pre-conceived or the falsehoods of grins
We in this game of veneers, these crooked smiles ain't clear
I once read our energies will never die so we eternally here, yeah

I been a, man on a mission but mortician by trade
Been killing the noise, I'm filling the void, I find it hard to relate
If niggas is starving, I suggest you protect your arteries
It's cutthroat, survival's always been the name of the game

I feel I’m on my own, I know I am, there ain’t no helping hand
With food held in his palm up in my face to feed this hungry man
The plan was try to make it big and I tripped at the finish line and fell flat on my face
Feelin embarrassed, wasted lots of time
I embodied the hatred that was given to me
The literal poet thats murdering every thing that he touches, I see!
I’m given you honesty, passion but I bet that my dedication the key
They wanted the sick and sadistic but this the tradition considerably!
Try to be positive and prosper from the blessings I have
Attempted to view the bigger picture
Put my poems in perspective
For people that’s livin similar
Never given advantages
Depression settles in with no medication to manage it
I'm not leavin the house, I would rather sulk in seclusion
And give you something that's realer instead of vivid illusions
A steady state of dilusion with deprevation of self
I’m aware that constant complaining and popping pills never help
I just pray that the Lord forgive me for sins I’m commiting daily
Pacing, talking to myself, I’m all alone and feeling crazy

The reason I work the way I do and I’m refusing to sleep
Cause when I was younger people askin me why I never speak
I truly believe I’m insignificant

Evaporated confidence compliments on my self esteem
Astutely sterilize with my sass, anonymous signature

Don’t Leave,UnKnown,2018.0,"Don't leave me girl, no no
Please stay with me tonight

Oh there's no energy to build up
No opportunities I live for
Must admit I'm a little paranoid
High that I can't come down from

So what would you choose?
With nothing to lose
Well, I almost blacked the fuck out
I almost didn't make it here, a motherfucker lucked out
Dry to the bone, wipe me down, dirt embedded in my skin pores
Ninety percent of y'all are probably finished before you quit, or
Worse, what the fuck you worth
Should have doubt you know, when the clouds hang low
When it rains and it pours
And the land where the lost are in control
If it's all unknown
All the same to you
Eh, let a nigga do what he came to do, do, true, true, true
Fuck the bullshit, nah, I'mma give 'em me
Yeah, it's imperfections in my shit, I ain't no masterpiece
Yeah, therefore my pride and ego; let that shit rest in peace, hoe
Feel like I got the ball and then I missed the fucking free throw
And then the motherfuckers I disappointed, here we go
Don't need no negative energy, standing in front of me, shit
Sometimes I feel just like I'm
Losing control of the pain, I'm flying and falling, fuck

Oh there's no energy to build up
No opportunities I live for
Must admit I'm a little paranoid
High that I can't come down from

I push my Chevy to the left, I'm not focused
My burdens heavy, could've guessed, you don't notice
I push my Chevy to the left, I'm not focused
Your curse has left me with the stress now I own it

Yeah, I stop myself from thinking
I'll pro'lly spill my drink when
I whip my Whip this evenin'
At least my thoughts ain't leakin'
I keep reminders hidden
What else can I be feelin'
Content my spirits drivin'
I got my fear in gear tho
I like to start from zero
Pick my guitar like heroes
Dark, but the stars appear tho
Heart fell apart like bread crumbs
What am I to do? I'm that one
Hold on my depression, suppress it with the finest dark rum
Put the light punch, can I pipe when I'm fightin' these lies
Man I might be rollin' till five
Got tears keep rollin' down my eyes
What a surprise!
I keep pushin' till the CD stops right at the lane
Feel like I'm swingin' my Caprice a problem night at the day
I'm flippin' cops off when I see em, holla fuck em, they all one and the same
They took like two shots, aiming one at the brain, so insane

I push my Chevy to the left, I'm not focused
My burdens heavy, could've guessed, you don't notice
I push my Chevy to the left, I'm not focused
Your curse has left me with the stress now I own it

I hydroplane, I'm swervin'
Stay in my lane, no mergin'
Hop out the whip and serve it
Then grab a vick escape quick
Roll up the shit and blaze it
Face forward for forward progress
What's filled with dope to content
Inhale the flowers essence
But never would come out with intentions
Slick as all my transitions
Got dry with this transmission
Flashin' lights I'm transmittin'
Sendin' signals, see the signs
Shit is sick as cyanide
Fast collision, fresh mind, end up and see the cyanide
I float and glide, you drag and slide
Now I describe, possessed by ""I""
No veil nor wife, these squares beside themselves blowin' smoke like a Newport
I can't prevent through
Never land will one plan that was get mine
At all cost no love lost
I pushed on, got slept on, like futons
Got fed up then moved on
I fell down, got back up, nigguh

They want financial dependency
Addicted to materials
Never think independently

I'm breaking it down and picking it up
And giving you everything that you want

Giving a fact, I guess I was doing the math
But I wouldn't speak of the cash and that's what I lack
They spinning irrelevant raps
I'm giving you elegant tracks for niggas to mass
Supplying a ridiculous batch
Banging and bringing it back
I said that I'm proud and playing at the volume it's loud
The dopest of niggas around, I'm tearing it down
I'm telling you what I have found
But to the music I'm bound
And I want it now but I got the patience to wait
I'm so in control of my fate

Then it's best you keep those wide
Never let that light inside you die
Nothin' worse than a dream that's been deferred
I concur, I agree, I relate, true indeed
God speed, hope you find the right direction 'fore you make a wrong turn
Bridges burned, lessons learned
We still risin' from the rubble like a phoenix out the ash
Time moves as the sand trickles down the hourglass
Got these blindfolded bifocals, prayin' I don't crash
If I do, no regrets, it was a blast
Nothing lasts, can't move forward if you livin' in the past
Never really been that sentimental
You can say I been a little temperamental
To the detriment of my inner sanctum, my sacred temple, my fragile mental
It's instrumental, , you get the sentiment
I make it evident so that the universe can then leverage it
I'm a testament of pure energies and how beautiful that this life can be
I'm an example of true potential, reach

Some'll plot on your demise but the others are just surprised
You alive, survived and thrived
Internally your drive is an engine with unlimited horsepower inside
Take a look under the hood, what do you find?
Something sublime
Gettin' off your ass, gettin' on your grind, no that is not a crime
You gotta read between the lines and decipher the bullshit
Practice what you preach, no pulpit
But don't you be comin' around with that foolishness
These niggas sellin' snake oil and hair-brained schemes to get rich quick
Got a viper in your cypher I suggest you dismiss
That poisonous, venomous, envy that they carry with them and hidin' within
I'm not here to enlighten mortal men
There's a glitch inside the matrix, this just a portal of sin
They got you believin' Jesus really had porcelain skin
Or that it was even Jesus to begin, god damn

Now who the realest I don't care I swear I do this for me
I'm not competing with the 
flock
 I'm just ahead of my time
Been complemented by some legends but I stay on my grind
While you demented the complacency is searching for shine
I never lie on these records, I tell the truth it's my duty now
I do more in a day than these niggas do in a week
I made a beat and wrote a verse while all you rappers asleep
Respect is earned so I suggest you only speak when you're spoken to
They don't care about the work, they want the personal fame
But this here is labor of love so I leave my trust in the process
My grievances I state them out my claim to fame is word of mouth if you ain't hip to what I'm doing nigga you just out the loop
Refuse to be like all of ya'll my heart is really in this shit
No tenements inside of me, my sentences like sodomy
I slice and dice the verses up, verbal lyrical fisticuffs
They only hit my line when they need something from me
Niggas fake as a whore, like what you calling me for
Time is money motherfucker every minute and second has got a dollar sign attached to it, these dreams that I'm imagining
Surpass my current plight like, what is life without a struggle
What's success without the failures nigga nothing is given
God is my witness imma get it if I'm able and willing

See now, what I've done is elevate from the place that I was
Mental progression is the key behind the doors more loved
So I unlock it with my passion I place nothing above, while I was focused on the craft, these kids was focused on buzz
They want the money and women it's like they can't tell the difference between the real and the fake, that shit's a fatal mistake
I tell it just like it is, all of these flaws I expose look
I don't mean to oppose but would you let me proceed
See, I'm the farthest bit from perfect man I sin I admit it
My biggest fear is when I die is that I won't be forgiven and
And I'mma go out alone, without a home of my own, I put so much time in this shit I'm not attached to this world
My mind is fucked up, sinner, conversating just with myself
If this music shit don't work man I don't have nothing else
Ain't seen my nephews in a while and man I hate that shit
This pain is real I feel it daily I'll explain that shit
I'm home sickin' on a different coast, praying to the holy ghost

It's like you searchin' for weakness, tryin' to find your center here (find your center here)
Sanctuary for insanity my nigga yah (my nigga yah)
Lookin' for reactions you just tryna get the trigger pulled (blow)
Cock back like what you say, oh no there's no debate
See clouds belong outside, not in your inner state
It's like you fiend to have a camera flashing in your face
It's 'cause you always got some fuckin' stupid shit to say (fuck outta here man)

You gon' make me act a fool now
You don't want me to lose my cool now
I've been doin' just fine for a few now
Till you came along and fucked up all my mood now
It ain't sunny when it rains (sunny when it rains)
So don't let me shine on yo' ass again

In all reality nigga, I give a fuck if you go
Rep return a repo, or give it all to a ho
Actin' outta pocket like she 'bout to call an audible though
Then turn around and go give that bitch some more, no
And it don't bother me that your life's a quote
But wanna down-talk niggas like what you doin' is dope
Condescending mothafuckas get they lip busted
And they can't be trusted, so its mothafuck 'em
Yah, this ain't our first go-round, nah we seen it all before
You the type of nigga to undercut your mom to get all the gold
Tryna be the star of the show, but your 15 minutes on a layaway though
You ain't gonna get what the fuck you want
Whats the point of all this dumb shit though?
Fuckin' dumb-ass

You gon' make me act a fool now
Fuckin' niggas, ha ha ha ha
You don't want me to lose my cool now
You was doin' better just sittin' there lookin' stupid
I've been doin' just fine for a few now
Ol' Ashton Kutcher ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" bitch ass
Till you came along and fucked up all my mood now
OK now I'm mad, shit!
It ain't sunny when it rains (sunny when it rains)
So don't let me shine on yo' ass again
It ain't sunny when it rains (sunny when it rains)

To find all that I need

Who do I love
Only, ones I hold close

I'm in the background minding mine
Sole purpose is a peace of mind
Even though I seem to find
Chaos in the quiet singin' all the time
Outta key and outta pocket
Auto-tune the Melodyne
Content of another kind
Fuck you niggas talkin' 'bout
It's time to march you tryin' to walk it out
The exit's where the bitch nigga in you stand
10 toes in a stairwell
You went the other way I wish you well
Leave me be
'Cause weaponless on the battlefield you won't find me
You lookin' for allies and friends 'cause you won't eat
You fightin' the war alone tryin' to bring the battle-zone to me
But you the one that started this shit
So I'm supposed to be a part of this shit?
My nigga where's your heart in this shit?
You only pop out when the dust settles and dust off your false medals
While I'm in the field they can find me when the sun set and laid the fuck out in

Underwater dissolving all my emotions like a pill
Tryna kill my pain and all my ills
All the thrills is gone, all the skill's been shown
All the venom injected paralysis got my right leg stiff
Tryna kick the habit and not trust her
In love with my wife but this music keep me lustin'
The only thing that gives release unless I'm bustin'
Revenge is somethin' I keep close like first cousins
I smile when I shake a few hands but I don't feel nothin'
Keep a  just as close, you ain't got no manners?
I make bodies disappear like abracadabra, poof

Denzel,UnKnown,2016.0,"I've been having conversations with my fucking self
In need of help I try to focus on my mental health
If I'm not in this game then I don't have time for procrastination
Screaming motherfuck rest and relaxation
I'm tired of waitin'

Lord, I'm suicidal nigga can't you tell
I cut my wrist and watch it drip while screaming fare thee well
Don't touch my body let me burn in fire leave me still
I grab a crucifix and say a prayer going straight to hell

Why you got a motherfuckin problem with a nigga that would push you to the limit with the effort he was givin'
Delivering sinning inside my context, perplexed, by an intelligent type of concept
I navigate a conversation my topics they tend to vary, various complicated essential thought, document with a pencil
To put it off in a file record a record I write
You ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight
Ever bust a nigga's head with a black lead pipe
When the blood starts to gush it's coming in out in a rush
That's a pretty vicious vision you're given
I'm getting vivid depicting death in a sentence
Aligning with the consensus
If you ever pay attention
You'll probably think that I'm demented
The mental case who's dependent on many antidepressants, oppressing the present feelings I have as I'm confessing
I'm looking at the prescription like a motherfuckin prison
Presenting it effervescent
Authenticating my message
The method in which I use
I pray it's never confused
The pages battered and bruised
From the way my lyrics fuse
Get a hold of my pain try to use it as a muse
A tool to entertain in vain for the amused
I'm a semi-automatic
With static I let em have it
The bullet flying sporadic
The shell will fall in the casket
To burn the flesh of a bastard
For preparation of rapture
The rigor mortis I'm writing
Is rummaging through your arteries
Autograph with an asterisk
Notarize with authority
And all my shit is different
I'm giving written deformities
Formulated the plan for avoidance of the conformity
And I can put the cots in the corner of dormitories
Deploring that negativity
Given in your fragility
Lyrically my ability
Showing off my agility
Indiscriminate killer who's never spitting it timidly
Reminisce with a riddle to rid you of any empathy
Empathizing your sympathy through the sound of a symphony, purifying the soul conflicted by my emission
Sadistic but realistic
And not materialistic
This motherfucker was gifted with the talent of taking words
Nouns and adverbs and making it backflip
Lui Kang crane kick with a different type of twist
The protagonist ain't alive
And the villian's tryna survive
As he salivates over bodies
He's severing with a hatchet
And leave em down in his cellar
The definition of ratchet
That captured imagination with captivating dismorphia
Consequence of the pain you contain inside of your orifice
Do you want any more of this
Mortifying your pulse that palpitates with your goriness
Introduction to the maker
I can show you what the glory is
Speak on the salvation
I preach with a prime motive
Let these motherfuckers know it
Ahhh

Lord, I'm suicidal nigga can't you tell
I cut my wrist and watch it drip while screaming fare thee well
Don't touch my body let me burn in fire leave me still
I grab a crucifix and say a prayer going straight to hell

I'm nothing more than a nigga with attitude
MC Ren, Yella, Dre, Easy and Cube
I'm showing some gratitude
Testing your aptitude
Look at the game and I gain a conclusion
It's all an illusion
The water's diluted
You sippin that juice and your mind is polluted
By these convoluters and losers
I'm taking that situation and I try to diffuse it
Man fuck that
I'm a ticking time bomb
But I heard they got the motherfuckin evidence
They must of found the body hidden in my residence
It wasn't for the money and the pocket full of precedence
Instead I give a fact and make it evident
They found it with its ripped eyes out visor with a top hat
Blood up on my rug so you know you gotta stop that
Claws at the foot of alpacas motherfucker better block that

That's $25,000 alpaca
You block that shit

And what you thought that I was finished
Diminished, replenish whatever you motherfuckers givin', reliving
I made a tape about religion but that was prior to what you currently hearing
Serving the secret
To leave it to keep it
To feel that I need it
But never retreating
The rarer defeated
Your mind is depleted
I'm trying to find the frequency
Juvenile my delinquency
I do it for respect not fame
If you want me to be honest then don't wanna be sane
I've been speaking with the voice that lives inside of my brain, contained to explain
But how do you maintain
I need a divine deity
Looking for my identity
But all I wanted was a piece of mind and sovereignty
Find it up in the melody
I created a remedy
Hoping it giving clemency
Flow is moving that Hennessy
And when I'm dead and gone I just pray that you remember me
My god!

Somewhere I could park a yacht
Somewhere where the climate's hot
Eating like the king a fine feast for my dinner yup
What a fucking dream I just woke up in my trailer park
Hunger pains, and 9-to-5s, bill collectors on my line, fine

Can you imagine the mind-state of this narcissistic
Convalescence that gives the essence of what the realest shit is
And I know that the people gon' love it
Every single line that a young nigga spit
And my flow so sick that it make a nigga nauseous
Lawless, please proceed with caution
Lost it, speakin' of my motherfuckin' mind if you find that bitch please tell me

Said they're pissin' me off with there's a vanity am
When they string you along for your hopes and your dreams
And exploit your emotions on numerous things
The cars, the women, the money, the clothes
Monotony constantly makin' me doze
See from the view of the highest of heights
I'm holdin' my head to the lowest of plight
But they want me to fight for humanities rights
While I'm smoking a blunt elevatin' my life
My cadence is right through the stress and the strife
A bit of advice is stay true to yourself
Develop some morals and tighten your belt
A legend should focus on posthumous wealth
You got it, you get it, ok then let's roll
They pray for the brackets, I pray for my soul
I'm goin' to Hell, that's a fact that I know
The mortality rate is affecting my goals
And the way that I'm livin' is turnin' me ghost
So just follow my lead as the journey unfolds
To the depths of disparity nobody knows
Psychosis atrocious, the killer of flows

Tryin' to make a livin' off of every line

On a path to self-destruction or the road to self-enlightenment

It manifests through my breath when I'm spittin' that sick shit
That ignorant slick shit

I want the respect, I don't wanna get rich quick
Emotion that people could feel probably ill with the steel as he handed a huey
Then takin' a shot like they're filmin' a movie
Geronimo pride in the back with an uzi
Then silence the violence they try to subdue me
The car movin' slow, you confuse it for cruisin'
We massacre, blast off, we call it a movement
A vision of peace and my people consume it AH!
Just a victim of this economy

All I hear is false prophets (false prophets)
Vultures disguised as poets (disguised as poets)
Operating with the words of their deceit (words of their deceit)

I just wanna live for all of eternity
They just wanna bring me down to their level
I used to think that life was nothing, not a thing
But now I see the beauty in it, ain't it strange?
My whole perspective changing, all of that but took a little bit of effort
Boy I still remember all the times that I would sit in silence
Silence of the Lambs, a Son of Sam I am
I said a secret message to the ones that need it
Helpless or the hopeless, not the wealthy, greedy
Greetings, how you doing in that living hell?
The captain of the ship, just call me Ishmael
And shit I’ve been depressed but now it's in remission
Live in different states to keep the demons off me
But the past that follows  finally acknowledged it
Take responsibilities, no apologies
My defense of my estate's an anomaly
By the time they play this shit, I’ll be out of it
Think about death, I reflect on it constantly
My pretentious point of view, well it's vicious
I've been the victim and the victimizer
They don't get much wiser, let the kid remind you
Many moons ago I made a smart decision
Picking up the pen and putting down my thoughts
Apart from internal struggles, repressing them lately
I practiced, perfected the craft, it was daily
It's stupid the effort, the work that's forever
They'll never forget what I did (It's incredible)
Created something that’s mines and nobody elses
Starved for this shit all alone , I ain’t have no help
I was the one that was pushing the vision
Made sure that the sentence was sick and insensitive
I was the one that was giving my all
I was vulnerable on every one of them records, bitch
I was the one that was making revisions at 3AM when I had work at 6
And now these niggas finally getting off they ass so I'm supposed to support and respect that shit
Man I could give a damn about your well-being ’cause you never gave a fuck about mine
Lord forgive the weak minded and those with malice in their hearts
For they know not what they do
Selling lies to the youth

Said all these motherfuckers seem to care about is money
They want some money, some more
My pride and my heart is something they could never take from me
Can't take it from me, no
Said all these motherfuckers seem to care about is money
They want some money, some more
My pride and my heart is something they could never take from me

Tell the truth, I ain't figured it out, what all this shit is about
I couldn't give you a definitive answer
See I could tell you a lie, ’cause everything look fine
But in reality my mind been frantic
Tryna get through the pain, see the other side of it
Past the things that we covet, pass the weed to me buddy
Meditate and I love it
Life is short and I know it
We get one shot so don't blow it
There's a thin line and I toe it
Ground up so I grow it
Get love and I show it
Getting by but not over
No luck involved in my situation
Shit's preparation and patience, baby
I left home and they said I'm crazy
Met a few people, been a couple places but I still ain't made it
Said I still ain't made it
Still ain't made it
Still ain't famous

Said all these motherfuckers seem to care about is money
They want some money, some more
My pride and my heart is something they could never take from me
Can't take it from me, no
Said all these motherfuckers seem to care about is money

Knowledge, above all nonsense nigga
Pay attention
Look

Don't step one foot up in the ride 'less you understand the vibe
That somebody 'bout to motherfucking die from a side
Where the colors collide
They got a look up in their eye
Like a thirst for another homicide
To decide, never get you for the drive
Anywhere that you would hide
Is easy for the bullet to come and find
Never mind what that means to define, what do you really 
But I seen you been complacent with a lie
Nigga tryna be the one, but all the substance abusing
And  with a regular influence
The problem is that life is so motherfucking confusing
The path that he walks nobody would ever choose it
Diffusing the situation, but the manifest too evasive
A scar for the heart but it's hard to erase it
The pain that remains and a drug to replace
With the same sad look up on his face
Nigga woke up in the morning with a different type'a goal
Turned cold from the fact that his father was never 'round
Picking up a semi auto, boutta lay the victim down
Blood drips from the body to the cracks of the ground
Then they mash on the gas, but they pass 5-O in they cut
Red lights everybody like fuck, just hush
3 niggas, 2 guns, 1 blunt
Put that motherfucking pistol up under the damn seat
Don't move and the cop'll approach
With a boisterous boast ""So I caught you doing 50 when the limit 35, please turn the engine off and everybody out the ride""
So he sits up on the curb outside
What they found was a stereotype
It wasn't even surprising that he had enough evidence to put 'em up in a cell
Another young black male with some difficult problems
But a penitentiary will help solve them
Lawd
Somebody told me that this life is but a dream
I reside in agony where happiness is never seen
Ask me why I'm so depressed and I confess my future's bleak
With all these voices in my head and I can't motherfucking think
Damn

Meanwhile there's a child laying dead from a gash
That was riddled with bullets that tore his body up in half
Do the math, he was only like six
Caught five from a clip
Thats a mac-11 auto tip straight to the hip
When it ripped through the flesh and then punctured the spine
But it left through the chest and the barrel was suppressed
Now the concrete's a motherfucking mess
Bet the nigga standing next to the body is feeling blessed
Man that bullet wasn't meant for an innocent bystander
Delusions of grandeur, to think that the violence has a name
But it does, its the one's that they claim
From the boy that was slain to the young man sitting in a cell
But the nigga that was running away from the bullets and covering hide hops up and finally realized, witnessing the death of his one child
Through the midst of the madness
The man sits down to reflect on society
Was tired of living trife
Took a singular second to try and get his mind right
Mustn't trip but the force of the moment tipped his whole life
And he knows it'll never be the same
This blood will drive him insane
He was thinking 'bout the pain that it caused
The emotional loss
But in all actuality
It probably was the cost of the cost
He was paying with a seed
I'm praying that everybody takes heed
This off an article I found, hidden in a publication
It's not some fabricated allegation
A gory allegory and the moral of the motherfucking story
Is try to be positive, not deceitful but alive
Nigga never pick the day when you die, try
Be a better person while you're still alive
And search for the divine that you never seem to find
Understand that happiness is the best state of mind
God damn
I been terrified of the way I'm living
Cut my wrists, I watch it drip
Hope I'm forgiven for my sinning
And I'm only 23 but I feel like my life is ending
I've been speaking with Jehovah and he told me that it's hopeless
Damn

My grandpa asked me one time if I care whether I live or die?
Yeah I do

My god, will it ever get through, who knows?
Everybody wanna chill, get money, fuck hoes
To be honest with you, nah I don't no stress
Running in a rat race till I'm all out of breath
I compete with myself, that's it, that's it
If I'm falling now, I won't trip, don't trip
I'ma get back up once again, once again
I done been through it all a couple times
Learned many lessons I won't forget
No, never thought that this shit was easy
I ain't into no people pleasing
If they don't feel this shit, they don't need it
Don't believe in me at all, it's cool
I'll find a road 
Just tryna find some light
But they object, fully fine with no hopelessness
But that don't mean that I be content with this tension building inside
This pain I hide behind the rhymes
If you could read between the lines
You'd see there's more than meets the eye, yeah

We just be trying to find ourselves amongst all this bullshit
Tryna find out what's real and what's fake
In the Garden of Eden surrounded by snakes
Your comprehension and full potential you've yet to reach
Every word is a glimpse into the mind of a man who chose to make something of himself, lawd",https://genius.com/Kaan-train-of-thought-lyrics
Timeless,TWENTY NINE,2020.0,"I've come so far, my efforts took my lyrics abroad
My vision is large, feel like the head nigga in charge
Got a mentality, to stand the test of time attained ability
The goal is that they listen and learn and not try to mirror me
But everything ain't always as it seems, can't trust appearances
Meaning you pick and choose what you show to public witnesses
People so quick to judge as if they don't know what forgiveness is
I learned the bad habits that's passed down through my lineage
My dad smoked 20 some odd years, picked up the lighter myself
Been hooked ever since, ain't looked back once
Cigars filled up with potent flower, packing a punch
I take a hit and start the sprint on this marathon run
They feel this shit deep in they heart like a shot from a gun
Our future bright, we heating up, our temperature is the sun
We went through hell to get to heaven, yeah we living and won
But stacking the funds and filling suitcases with ones

Prepare for them rainy days
The lost and forgotten ones, we the throwaways
I hit the blunt and take a breath, the pain float away
I take another hit until it all go away, until it go away
Feeling like this chip on my shoulder too big
Don't feel no genuine love from the place that I live
Niggas never show support unless convenient for them
Misery loves company so they don't want us to win, damn

Can't be stuck and stagnant, in a mind state of I gotta make it happen
Manifesting my reality, this is law of attraction
Bringing more than just some phrases you can put inside a caption
Audible distraction, these lethal words a call to action
Divide the faction of those who's real and those that's acting
You feel the passion, we energize, revitalize, let your mind imagine
Forever we immortalized from these timeless classics
Enough rations to feed the masses, teaching master classes
Mashing, no gashes, the whiplashing, the big gas
With this gift of gab I'm Inspector Gadget, I reach long
Sick and tired of hearing the same shit, it's a re-run
Protect yourself at all costs like you signing a pre-nup

Prepare for them rainy days
The lost and forgotten ones, we the throwaways
I hit the blunt and take a breath, the pain float away
I take another hit until it all go away, until it go away

Do you think that was a typo?
Uhh, what was number one?

Hmm
Nah that's cool, okay
Nah that's okay I thought Drake was going to be number one
Eminem's not even on the list

He was on the list but Eminem ain't even on there?
Shout-out my *bleep* Gucci

Uh-huh, lawd, Knowledge, nigga
Uh-huh, Uh-huh, Uh-huh
Lawd, look
These fuckin' rappers are acts
'Cause they need a camera on them
But couldn't comprehend the Mikanis simply on the stream
My, lines are a web of tapestry weaving
I'm leaving a list of commandments that's transparent
I'm paralyzing these guys to the size of a molecule
Everybody sounds the same now
The game is refurbished modules
A bunch of sorry motherfuckers
That don't actually practice
Passing their pitiful habits
That's blasphemy
Feeding the masses, and my
Minds an amazing maze, I'm
Brought to a shame to say, I
Don't like the person I see
Panic, now what's on upry
Pacing inside of my thoughts
I wish I knew what I want, see
A minuscule force forcing myself to feel as the
Vanity is a real
And the pain remains still
Vanishing they responses
I'm giving it, get the gist
With this gesture I've been remissed
To simple perfection impressed
I've been painful of regression of the past
And I'm leaving soon
My grievances graciously greedy
Greedy and CD, that's only dialing my number
To call me up when they need me
I see the signs on the wall
That were written, forming text
That we call hidden calligraphy
You can view through a monocle
Monetize the experience, mirrored upon a monitor
I can sense that you niggas are shook
Trying to tell them fallacies, not a flattering look
Cannabis at the bottle, reading his rhyme from his book

Recycling bullshit, the same content but it's re-rap
My shit penetrate your cranium and wave cap
I never took a day off
The god and I really feel like I can say that
So many flows, had to use a new one to show I'm nuanced
A project a month 'cause bar none is more than a bar gone
Niggas disrespect, we come through and bomb like 
Saigon in Vietnam
Sound the alarm
In this game of kings, queens, these niggas all are pawns
My mode I'm moving down the autobahn running an audible
I muted the bullshit, no longer audible, the flow is soluble
The school of hard knocks, we was on on the honor roll

Author of this Orthello thespian shit
In tune with the most high
I can see this shit from both sides
I can never take it, all lies
Read between the lines if you can't, uh, yeah
And that's just a little advice
Talent, that could take you far but common sense can take you farther
Hardest part of life is realizing that there's no limits
Look I may have fell, but never failed nor hesitated
That's an understatement, I'm overthinking and overplanning
All of this in effort to make sure they can understand me
Superficial titles, I can do without the fame boy
My mind is flying free like a plane that's leaving the airport
Empathize with reciprocity, now that's a rare thought
Like henceforth, no cease or stopping
Wasn't left with any options
Left home, evacuated
Now I'm just evaluating
Suitcases filled with fragments of memories, now faded
Lawd, I'm lost and weary, I need direction
A soul's collective messages written in verses for you
Before I go any further, I'll find some steady ground to stand upon
A man of morals, most of y'all will never get it

Feel like I'm talking to myself most times, I-I-I (most times)
Feel like I'm talking to myself most times, I-I-I (most times)

People move on, I know this, so won't nobody stay for me
They tell me wait my turn but patiently pray that it's coming soon
Let opportunity arise, I'm sure to take advantage of
All the things that I been dreaming of
They ain't the way they seem, illusions only  with you
They look larger than life at times
Reality been setting in for me, I'm tryna manage shit
It's hard to ease your mind when every single thought is damaging
Condemn yourself with doubt, the cloud of negativity surrounds
I take all of the lows and then replace 'em with highs
The farthest thing from perfect, look that's not what I claim
I can feel your pain, see I relate in a way
The stress of living check to check, not knowing how you make it through
Starving, wanting more than what you got but still coming up short
Feel like survival's a sport
Either you do or you don't
Either you will or you won't
That's not the way it is, there's certain things you can't control
It's how you choose to handle them
You can choose to keep the faith, be positive for heaven sakes
The time it takes to hold a grudge or hate, it ain't worth the investment
Lessons learned along the way, we're stuck in stagnant trying to find
Peace of mind for real life, protect that shit at all costs

Feel like I'm talking to myself most times, I-I-I (most times)
Feel like I'm talking to myself most times, I-I-I (most times)",https://genius.com/Kaan-ttm-lyrics

I'm about to throw a party, everybody's been invited
I said bitch my name is Knowledge, everything I spit's enlightening like

Hold up nigga what’s your purpose?
Tell me what you represent?
I separate conjunctions, run-on sentences like ampersands
I'm dropping jewels of knowledge, my composite is a helping hand
I'm flowing like a steady stream that's sturdy as the hoover dam
And I don't think they understand that I relate to mental patients
Pop a pill, my I.V's filled with Propofol for concentration
Put me on a stage with flashing lights, I'm under observation
Murder beats like people, treat the page like it’s an operation
Open up your mind without a few sedated medications
Long-awaited meditation from my mental elevation
Peace of mind to find, but by design it was of no relation
Corridor is mighty spacious, I been feeling lonely lately
Kill 'em with a flow that I bet they never seen it
Hit ’em with a side two wide demeanor
Heard they boy once now they all just fiendin'
Think you can do what I do, stop dreaming
Reach for the goddamn spot that nobody ever got till the moment that you actually seize it
Believe it, achieving, it's easy
The corner of an ax of the trees that were there for a reason
I don’t even know the person that I am
And I’ve been searching, digging deep it's obsolete, I’m absolutely incomplete
My spirit’s been defeated by the demons that I do possess
I’m too depressed, I’ve been oppressed from pressure, I shall not progress
I must confess my head's a mess
I stress about my sanity
I sanctify my soul upon the pew from views of vanity
Just crucify my flesh then let my blood drip on the canopy
Then catalog or catacomb, I call it home and rest in peace
But mentally I’ve been deceased, depleted by my recreation
Moments of seclusion, my hateful thoughts have been procreating And there’s no illusion or confusion I'ma die alone
So don’t neglect the lessons offered by my introspective thoughts the mine Kaan fury he’ll alert you to a holocaust the putrice in the desert definite daisies and daffodils
The bane of runneth over old pedal just to make it real with all these voices in my head encouraging my malice
Manifest the manuscript, it was magnetic and magnificent
My father told me I’m too quick 'cause ain't nobody listening
But that nigga don’t know me, when the last time that we really spoke?
I’m wasting all my time with rhymes, ok alright I get it folks
And right before I take my life, insisting I propose a toast
Me and the holy ghost discussing issues that he only knows
But I’m so insecure, I never leave my room
I'm terrified that if I go outside then all my fears will soon be verified and I'm stunting my mental growth
I'm emotionally paralyzed
I live inside a paradigm
I wanna die, is that a crime?
I find that people never care unless the problem's beneficial
Cut my wrists, I'm tearing tendons and vital vascular tissue
But I realize that if I die today, no one would miss me
Tell the coroner to throw my corpse inside of shallow ditches
I been living like a loner, I just pray the lord forgive me

Mama cooking in the kitchen, Daddy bugging for no reason
Playing a lot of Makaveli, drowning out my fathers screaming
I can barely even think in this bitch
No peace, no sleep, nigga I can not complain though
Everything the same though, why am I insane yo?
Wishing I could change but I can't, it's the constant allure
How the hell can I survive, homie I'm not even sure I know
I seen a premonition, pardon me as I prepare
I'm paranoid and paralyzed, a paradigm isn't my fear
Apparently you put a price on happiness, I couldn’t do it
No illusion, I’m alone
I can't relate to what you doing
I can read between the lines
I know they’re recently influenced
I just pray you pay attention 'cause when they lead you astray
It's sad to say that you'll be safe in the solitude of my sound
I serenade ’em with my soul and I feel like I'm an apostle
Spirit of baptizers, silent  like gospel

Yes I know the devil is alive

Personally I'm  and I've already heard incredible
You asking me, your shit is pathetic

If I get analytical, dissecting every sentence 
Your influence is infusing the fuse of the fuel that's lighting your fire

Then why should I help you? Oh you ain't askin' for it huh
No you got all this figured out, so much bullshit to untwine
Oh so you a stand-up guy but fall on your ass every time
It look like your paper running out
You might have to find a new paper route
Might have to sit your ass on the sidelines
Till you get your shit sorted out
Funny how the word broke ain't pronounced
Like y'all ain't know what that's about
Pride is a double edged sword
Ready to take a nigga out

Excuse me, don't

So nigga guess what I'ma do
The opposite of you
Tryna ride a wave nah that's what sucka niggas do
I give two fucks what niggas do
Shit you might call me out of touch
My shit hit like an uppercut
I hit you with another one
Somebody please tell me why
These niggas trash by design
That shit sound mad asinine
Sound like the blind lead the blind
Mothafucka I can't read braille
But I can see bullshit pretty well
These bitch niggas fold under pressure
That's 'cause these bitch niggas frail

Lawd
Huh

All these motherfuckers try to give me their opinion like I ever asked for it, like I ever asked for it
Tell 'em if I wanted your opinion, motherfucker, then I’ll probably ask for it, then I'll probably ask for it
I'm the type of nigga that’s been living in seclusion, trying to deal with all the pain, trying to deal with all the pain
How the hell can I survive through the stress, I just want to find a way to maintain, find a way to maintain
But what is happiness?
I loom in my sanity, it's lucid, and I feel like a loser
I think I'm finna fade to an early grave
I need to pray and talk to god, make sure my soul is saved
I know I'm going straight to hell for all these blasphemies
I hope one day that I'm forgiven so that I can finally rest
I know I'm going straight to hell for all these blasphemies
I hope one day that I'm forgiven so that I can finally rest

I can attest, I take your stories of a darker time
A timid kid with no self-respect and a lack of pride
I used to pray, before I slept, that I would cease to rise
Nobody understood my plight 'cause I was fucking silent
Assuming that I would never make it to 25
I saw my life as incidental and accidental
I mentally manifested my message of many depressive tendencies, temper tantrums and nightmares
I’m here, but only in a physical sense
I’m soon to ascend as a sign of my 
I lace the page with my theories
Livin' the lines that I wrote
I offer you honesty, truth ’cause that's all I have at the moment
Mastered the craft and the masses gazed in amazement and awe
But that's the allure, are you sure that I'm everything that you call me?
Constantly honored by insecurities, certainly self-conscious
Of course I was cursed to curtains and close ’em
My time has been running out of my mind into mediocrity
Modestly made a promise, a problem I couldn't keep and I'm speakin' for me
The music is the means to an end so if I offend or fender-bend then I repair it my friend
The paradigm that I'm in is pitiful, passing my pain
Can I explain for a second these words that you can dissect?
But I won't accept what they set as a standard, sterilize your mind with the pen
The prison I'm in is unexplainable
Not relatable, 'till you took a chance and flew
I'm finally free but giving you me
Even though my life is meek, it's still beautiful and unique
I wanted to find peace
With a belief, said I would never retreat
Put in the realest of worth, inside of a song
Sending you nothing but love
Shit that I'm giving is positive, demonstrative and delicate
Talent I was given is a blessing from a higher power
I am just a vessel to preach
I beseech you with the gospel, sweep you off of your feet
I just hope you pay attention to my meaningful speech
God dammit

I need to get my credit score high
Not influenced by these liars
In reality, they functioning junkies
The only thing they stood for was some muhfuckin' money
Only people that they helped are the ones that they know
Man this game full of hoes, and I hate this shit
Seen it with my own eyes and it's damaging
3-0s in a week just to manage shit
I feel alone, don't nobody understand the kid
Isolated, got me back up on my manic shit

I make the energy shift, so feel the slightest breeze
I feel my temperament is carefree, content to be
I feel nobody cares if I proceed to go succeed
The plight I've seen, it's nice to dream of finer things in hopes that you receive 'em
I hope to set the example for someone to believe in

I don't need an introduction
Don't need recognition for me to function
I believe that the work is more important
I've been putting in time, I never force it
I'm in love with the process, it's gorgeous
All the time in the world, I can't afford it
I've been running from the pain, I can't avoid it
I've been sprinting, I've been jumping
I've been ducking, I've been dodging
All the problems I can't hide from
Peace, do you got some?
Love, I can't find none

Smoke till my mind gone
Sitting, I reflect thinking where it all went wrong

Believe mistakes what  all the way, somehow

I control this shit, I steer, I never cruise
I don't wait around, there's plenty left to do

I said I'm going down if the ship is sinking
Niggas jumping overboard to deeper waters
I can make them realize their plans are faulty
Never let them into my 
Wanna throw a temper tantrum, pity party
Niggas said they dedicated, that's the farthest
From the fucking truth that they could possibly be

I pray that this perspective never leaves me

What you out here pursuing?
What's your mental perspective?
What's your final objective?

Find some silence and peace of mind, that's a goddamn blessing
I've been up, been down, been out
I've been up, been down, been out
I've been all around the world now I'm right back where I started
I just kill my fucking ego, rest in peace

I've been up, been down, been out
I've been all around the world now I'm right back where I started
I just kill my fucking ego, rest in peace
It ain't just what it seem to be like, searching for purpose in life
Searching for signs and affirmation, asking myself is it worth it?
What route to take and what to do when the work isn't working
The pressure felt, the doubt consumes, insecurities surface

I can feel it, I can feel it all
I can feel it, I can feel it all
I can feel it, I can feel it all
I can feel it, I can feel it all

What you really been chasing?
Where's your faith, where's your patience?
Don't give into temptation, just exceed expectations
How you gon' rise from the bottom when you gave up and you quit?
How you gon' throw in the towel assuming your effort's useless?
Well ain't that something, well ain't that something
I'll keep it moving though it's bumpy, this road is bumpy
They selling dreams but I don't trust it, no I don't trust it
Prey on the weak, ugh that's disgusting, that shit's disgusting
That's just the way the game goes, I guess that's just how it be
I don't complain 'bout the rules, the calls or the referees
My nail's no sharper than yours, you got the same tools as me
Watching me dine then wondering why your food too cold to eat
I know that life is perspective, wish you could see how I see
I wish the frame on your picture could be as big as mine be
I wish that you could comprehend that real beauty is free
Lessons learned along the way, given to you from me
True indeed

Salvation,Losing My Religion,2014.0,"29 days
35 minutes
That's as long as I've been sober
I can't tell the fuckin' difference
I ain't find that peace of mind
I heard sobriety delivers
I'm dyin' the slowest death
Like cirrhosis of the liver

Sober 29 days and 35 minutes
Fuck it, roll me up a blunt
I bet that shit won't make a difference
Sober 29 days and 35 minutes
Fuck it, pour me up a drank
I bet that shit won't make a difference
Sober 29 days and 35 minutes
I learned nothin' from sobriety
So what's the fuckin' difference
I could really care less for another person's opinion

I just found out all niggas are alike
And it seems that every one of us is the same
I'm ashamed we're content with this slavery
Given today we're consentin' these diamonds and chains
Now that's a connection connectin' you right to the past
Those shackles they gave us for free
Can now cost you more than a house
An abundant amount of materialistic disease
But it seems that we're all just tryin' to be free and happy
Searching for peace of mind and a handful of factors
Coverin' insecurities with name-brand fashions
Then covet a lifestyle we couldn't even imagine
Designed by a dictator, fabricated by a fascist
You better get your seat-belt fastened
If this plane crash, go down in front of a million people
Where the HD camera lens flashes
Cheers for the happiness but standin' ovate for the tragic
Hand claps when they see a mothafuckin casket
Nigga was nothin' more than a bastard
Live on a plantation with figurative slave masters
Now I depict the vision so you can picture composite
Complicity sold souls to get the largest deposit
For cars that go fast and diamond encrusted watches
The life I live's a facade, mirage, nobodies watchin'
I'm hopin' music is more than the allure of dollars droppin'
Illuminated my mind mystifyin' euphoria
Rappin' 'bout imperfections to lace a sentence with purity
Hopin' to find salvation and glory amidst obscurity

For 29 days and 35 minutes
Fuck it, roll me up a blunt
I bet that shit won't make a difference
Sober 29 days and 35 minutes
Fuck it, pour me up a drank
I bet that shit won't make a difference
Sober 29 days and 35 minutes
I learned nothin' from sobriety
So what's the fuckin' difference
I could really care less for another person's opinion

I, drift in-n-out of consciousness
Incompetent, tryin' to stay afloat
Conductin' myself with a certain rapport
The realest of rhymes for your mind to absorb
I'm ready for battle, preparin' for war
Condition my soul as the battle ensues
Alluding these evils that try to pursue
Like the voices I hear that could probably subdue
A political power that counter-produce
The proponents of owners perform, it's a duece
Confusions diluted the mind of the youth
While we runnin' in circles in search of a truth
Significant ignorance give us the glue
An omnipotent impotent imminent clue
The suicide note that I've written for you
Mixed with hateful content and insidious views
My soul is at peace with that sight of a pew
Damnation for many, salvation's for few
It's unfortunate fortunes of sins we've accrued
For a moment to fornicate
Sins of the father condemnin' the seed
Before it can prosper it failed to reprieve
But it's fillin' a voice for your venomous greed
Discriminately, considerin' me
Less than a man 'cause the wealth I received
Is a spirit of mind and materialized into my indiscretions
Like catholic confessions foretellin' sins of the fleshes
I'm writin' 'bout imperfections to lace my lyrics with purity
Hopin' to find salvation and glory amidst obscurity

For 29 days and 35 minutes
Fuck it, roll me up a blunt
I bet that shit won't make a difference
Sober 29 days and 35 minutes
Fuck it, pour me up a drank

The streetlights hit my windshield and glisten

The misrepresentation, disenfranchised, lost and lonely

So now we, playing some Gucci talking 'bout booties and boobies and boosting that bass to bump till the speakers can't function none
And these niggas fiending for funds

Infecting your mind with something positive through my convictions
I'm giving you more than just the average
The lavishness, the callousness, cataclysmic savages
Madness laced with the truth inside of these audio passages
My rhymes ain't for the faint of heart, a pacifist
Anyone saying different never walked a mile inside my  moccasins
Ahead of my fucking time, my vision is similar to binoculars
Niggas are fading fast, a step behind, they all inoperative
They playing a role and playing a part
They playing into the politics
Unable to recognize all this colossalness
Them gimmicks get 'bout as old as a fossil is
Fantasies of the novices not for me, I'm an optimist
So give me a beat and blunt and I'll transform like Optimus
I'm painting a perfect picture for listeners to composite it
Niggas are taking the road of least resistance
I can not oblige if it don't coincide with the vision

""Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice""

Nigga we been through too much to throw the towel in, that would be blasphemy
Living a life of purpose, pulling the strings, controlling the strategy
I maximize my gift so that my future's not a casualty
I'm moving accordingly, outside of the box and not conformity
Still alive, we prosper and strive to fight the dormancy
Throwing punches like Tyson to find some silence and normalcy
I'm looking inside my soul not just the surface, see there's more to me
We going against the grain, these other niggas move accordingly
Filming every moment of the sacred in the name of business
Battling with your pride and ego, back and forth like playing tennis
Living inside the land of the blind where you couldn't find convictions
Nigga's will sell they soul, get out of control to profit from the image
We'll package it up and sell it to 'em, turn 'em into believers
Follow the leader, consumers more like golden retrievers
They love the chase, they love the game even if it's deceiving
Keep giving 'em what they want not what they need
They'll never leave you

Self-depricatin' truths to help me fly as high as a dove
To whom it may concern, the tables turn when times got tough
Stuck in this in-between using faith as a leverage for luck
The bell rang, they blew the whistle, but I can't give up

Wanna try appeasin'
Pause when I saw a grievance
For the life of me, I'm torn
When I try to see a much better way to do this
I'm foolish for actin' selfish
I felt like I had to adjust
Or is it that I'm terrified that I could fail all alone
No one to call, the cost of burning every bridge that I own
I built this wall around myself, now I'm secluded from most
My mind is gone, I'm disillusioned with this life that I live
A seldom few that chose to sacrifice and grind with the kids
So many say that they down to ride but I can see they fake erroneous claims
I came with nothing but this heart on my sleeve
It's harder to breath or believe that I'm meant to do this
I'm definitely in over my head
Repetitive effort, I make something that mesmerize
Creatively in tuned to sources of inspiration
I'm facin' realities truth
I'm 25 with no options, right now I'm running in place
My faith is based in this talent that I am blessed with
Pessimistically 'pressive, for a progress is prompted by actions with no permission
I'm spiritually consumed, I don't want for worldly possessions
I'm prayin' for peace of mind, it's as precious as blood diamonds
I defy with my effort, effectively I articulate the way that I intend to infuse
Lyrical structure with melodic symphonies to amuse
Another language to communicate my seminal views
Or how we living and maintain through the evils we see
Idiosyncrasies synchronize with an ignorant tongue
As dope as they come, I ask for nothing but attention from some
 I'm prepared for the rise
Searchin' for hope, it's hard to cope, you see the pain my eyes
A constant reminder that complacency can only bring me closer to death
But they don't relate, it's like my words are falling on deaf ears
Dearly departed, disregard every fear that I had

I'll live forever through these records, never die
The way I, bounce back
Way I, bounce back

Said I been chopping with these bars like a battle axe
And everything a nigga write, well it's matter of fact
See you could take it as the truth or choose to not believe it
No need to beat around the bush, I'm off the beaten path
The quest I'm on is one for life, I gotta figure out
Everything that I been looking for, I can't find
How the fuck do you critique a nigga's inner thoughts?
As if you even understand what I'm going through
I'm in a business where the numbers matter more than the product, you might get caught up
You will take losses, I got my back against the wall
I throw these records out with reckless abandon
I hope and pray that one of them sticks
Still slumming, ya dig?
Still spitting this shit
Still outta the mix
My shit fresh, your shit outta the box
You outta your mind, you outta your lane
I'm outta this world, I'm out in a hurry
I hurdle hearses and all traffic
I step back and fall in line
A wise man once said, ""Be , be patient, all good things, they come in due time""
Everybody don't ball like they Chris Duhon
Everybody don't push the Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Some of us are broke and hopeless, pockets empty
Me, I wanna find some peace of mind, 
Yeah I may be down right now but not forever

I may be down just for the moment 
I'll live forever through these records, never die
The way I, bounce back
Way I, bounce back
Way I, bounce back
Way I, bounce back
I may be down just for the moment 
I'll live forever through these records, never die

I found a way I could move, did that shit all by myself
It's still motherfuck 'em, if these niggas don't wanna help then I do this shit all by myself, do it all by myself

Get up in the game and I'ma kill it, make 'em bounce to all my shit, my shit
You ain't never met another nigga like me motherfucker, make 'em bounce to all my shit, my shit
They can call it what they want, but shit, it better be correct, I make 'em bounce to all my shit
And if I do what the fuck that I gotta do to prove that I can be the greatest, I make 'em bounce to all my shit
And if I hit 'em with the flow, I bet that I can make 'em move
Playin' my position, let a nigga keep it cool
I'ma tell the truth and everything I say is smooth
Feel like I don't have a single thing that I can lose
But I'm bending corners like I'm riding in a '64 Impala, make 'em bounce to all my shit
But I'ma give 'em what the fuck they wanna hear from my perspective is the real, I make 'em bounce to all my shit

I've been that nigga from the jump, I gotta start the camera late
Never hesitate, I regulate, there's no debate
Take it to the back, I let that motherfucker faint
Master of the craft and my abilities to 'splay
Who the fuck is you, these people talk about the challenger to knock me out my spot or position
You need to apply for a year
You better offer the bigger barricade to bury your body and bullets burnin' your flesh with these rapid-fire attempts
When I spit it I'm like an automatic, attack rappers, savagely eye damaged, detrimental aesthetic
Step inside of my mind but I'm minor to negativity to get the message out but we doin' it expeditiously
A whole nother level of attention to detail, I see hell and clean swells, I mean well
When the weed fails, then I'm relying on your reciprocity
Follow the path as I and I personally design it
I'll find that I'm lost with no direction inside, my plights become real
I write what I feel, I'd like to invite the vain to vacate
My pain is profound, I pray I don't drown
I'm pressing my luck, repressed to find love, impress you I does
This professional is poised, I progress, with passion perfects
The price to convince this victim will win

Get the fuck from , stay the hell up off me
Look I gotta grind, that's right I really want it
They was high and , I been low and working
What I know for certain that I never trusted
If you told me no, I’m screaming motherfuck it
That rejection they give got me gassed up
Never hot, my emotions don't mask that
Temperament up and down like the NASDAQ
Think I been feelin' like a new man
My pursuit of happiness, I got a new plan
But definitive lyricism’ll bust back
The way a motherfucker spit will make your head spin
Activist, don't lean like kickstand
Man in the mist, the madness is still 
Tentative, I need attention when I speak now
All Eyez On Me like I'm Makaveli ridin' in the front seat
These motherfuckers on , but you the  like lunchmeat
Nigga please let me eat the beat
They French Polynesia, then I paint a picture like the Mona Lisa
Brushstrokes correct, I sketch flawless features
If it's feast or famine, I'm not retreatin'
I assault with  can't stop the bleedin’
Never claim perfection, I work to reach it
What’s the word

What's the word, word, word, word, word
Let it bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
I’m just movin' low, went through it all alone
And you know where to find me, I be in my zone
But what's the word, word, word, word, word

I'ma spit this shit until they sick of us
My flow fisticuff, now quick pick it up
Don't be dismissive of or try to judge the kid
Now let me juxtapose and re-assess it all
But I been well invested with the best intention
Don't forget to mention that I'm calculated
Bitch I been creating with original flava
You regurgitated 
I got straight to work, there's no time to waste
And my mind escape, I view the landscape
I gotta  respect and only one objective
Do or die, selective, with a fine collective
Any more suggestions they can keep that
If you got opinions don't speak them
They unnecessary don't need ya
Fuck out my face with that fake shit, that ol' snake shit
That's all the same tricks
And loose lips sink ships, think quick, don't stop
I try to re-invent but the flow gon' 
Been ready for the game I lace my high-tops
Fourth quarter under pressure  the block
Under  justify
I gotta leave it on the ground for you to rectify
Spit the real the way I do, it's like it's sanctified
And I'm a non-compliant  narcoleptic
Never narcissistic but I stay consistent
Let the work convince 'em, I don't talk about it
I would rather show ya but the weight I shoulder's so paralyzing for the feeble mind
I got a rebel spirit, not a  soul
And that's food for thought for you to feast on

Eleven,UnKnown,2017.0,"Live in the moment, I never do
Too worried, stressin' ’dwellin' on my negative thoughts
They got the best of me
Took my confidence and squandered it
There's nothing left of me or left in me, I’m empty see
All I got is empathy, a penny for my thoughts
I'm underpaid for these epiphanies
The least that you could do is hear me out instead of listening
The difference in nodding your head and moving your feet
See my mission is to make 'em peep everything that I speak
When you play this shit, hopefully it resonates wit' your soul
I can take this shit deeper, we ain't even scratched the surface yet
Still searching for my purpose, persecuted by my fragile mind
Stand tall within these frantic times
The world is fucking cold, it leave you froze like 3 below
I hope I don't ever break, keep it together I will
I feel like I'm on to something
My intuition buzzing like hummingbirds
I heard through the grapevine I got that honey nectar sweet shit
That shit them niggas serving overpriced high  shit
Saturated,  and fast,  the raps
I lacerate and trim the fat to get down to the nitty gritty
Ain't no structure in your shit, your foundation’ll fold
It’ll crumble fo' sure, oh, oh

Said ain’t it something I, I
Said I know if I take my time, time
Said I know if we take our time, time
Then we can get it in due time, time
Never let you block my shine, shine
Never let you block my shine, shine
Never let you take what's mine, mine
Never let you take what's mine, mine
I know if we take our time, time, time

My heart and mind, they both aligned with my spirit, I swear
They told me patience is a virtue, take heed and believe it
The route of evil, well it's money, is how some see it
But not the ones that down and out, ’cause they actually need it
With mouths to feed but not enough funds
To get through the week and bi-weekly payroll
The next cheque don't come in 'till next week, already spent most
But that's just tryna stay on your feet
Just staying afloat, but cracks in your boat hoping it don't sink
But hope can only take you so far, it's low mileage
Ya ain't gotta take my word as the gospel, I'm nobody
I'm just speaking from experience and talkin' to myself, oh, oh

Said ain't it something I, I
Said I know if I take my time, time
Said I know if we take our time, time
Then we can get it in due time, time

Take a sip of the truth, it's compelling
Never been the type of nigga that was acting overzealous
Like a motherfucker that came in with a note for the teller
To tell her to put  up in the bag
Let's see the cheddar
The feta, the mozzarella
Depending upon the weather, all ties got severed
Except for the seven niggas with seven different opinions
For serenading a victim, sedate them until they listen
Berate them until they give in
As we step in your house under cover of night
A rope and a knife
We ending your life
I came with a cult type of crew as my following
Torturing niggas we do that methodically
Raping the beat with misogynist sodomy
Feeling disheveled, now can I speak honestly
This is not personal, I'm a professional
Slicing you up, now you look asymmetrical

Better tell them motherfuckers I'm coming I wanna run it
Signing a synonym, selling a citizen off of the Ritalin
Feeling your residence through the residue
Resonating by a saboteur, the sabotage
The camouflage came with a posse and Paul
Apostles and all
Popping off with apostrophes
I'm fulfilling a prophecy
Promiscuity's moving, consuming
You chronologically refuting any incident from argumentative inconsolable minds
With uncontrollable lies
I'm coming, I'm running, I'm hunting
And by the time we done with them
You can see what we done to them
Take a look at the damn crime
See the sharpest blade ever made inside the belly
Of your pregnant prom queen tied up to the banister
While I'm slicing the vascular
Stabbed that bitch in the

Reliving the pain given
Delivering in a sentence

We was dragging the bodies out
In southern California where it never rains
Go to the dark part of Yosemite
Yelling plenty obscenities
Digging ditches intensively
Attention wasn't the purpose
To film a murder with a tripod
Turn the audio to MP3 so we can hear the screams on an iPod
Close the damn curtains, turn the motherfucking lights off

I'm learning from every lesson
But these thoughts can get compressing
I take it back to the essence
Mistakes I make 'em daily
Can't tell me I'm not regressing
Couldn't fathom or imagine that I would be where I am
See my progression is a miracle, I leapt from the stands
That's past tense, I'm in the present
This proprietor of blessing position himself to prosper through practice and dedication
This shit came to fruition like the Book of Revelations
In the land of temptation, like Adam without an Eve
Watching out for the snakes and that fruit that's been hanging lower
While y'all just getting over, I've been focused with composure
Forget about the past, I got amnesia, call it closure
Still me, myself and I and I know don't nobody know us
Keep moving through the traffic jams of life like ""What's the hold-up?""
Been a minute since I left home
Yes I made room but I don't fold up
Only reliant on myself, a comfort when this world gets colder
People change, but that ain't nothing new
The fuck am I supposed to do?
Stay stagnant 'cause your fears done got the best of you?
Convinced you gave your all 'cause you feeling like nothing's left in you
But me, I kept it pushing through depression for a better view
Niggas make decisions but don't want to live with consequences
Life is filled with bumps and bruises, I brush off the incidentals
Told my life story a million times on all these instrumentals
Even the darkest thoughts inside my mental, that I never spoke
This shit was spiritual, I felt like music was my Holy Ghost
Saving grace through somber times
These non-sober lullabies that I supply subdue the mind of similar thinkers
Pill poppers and heavy drinkers, wrist cutters and deep thinkers
That the world forgot about, so they quiet, suffer in silence
Trying to find the kindest word that comply with all of their problems
Been speaking from experience, this myriad of knowledge
Was never judgemental, it was genuine and gentle",https://genius.com/Kaan-thoughts-before-a-flight-lyrics

I serenade with the cadence, I do
I serenade with the cadence, I do
I'm back and forth with this shit
The pen is a weapon for me
Extravagantly, I bruise and then batter the beat
My shit is a masterpiece

Ehh
Look
Huh

I would ask for a second at the most
Pray to God but I never get a response
Guess I'm really unimportant to the almighty
In a dark head space but I need light
Rewrite every single rhyme I would ever spit
I ain't never been a nigga they considered cool
But can I kick it with the vision that I'm giving you
And to be honest man, I like it when I'm all alone
My telephone is on silent, I want to breathe
I think it's funny that what these people have changed up
You better bow down, give me what I came for
My attitude is getting rude and I'll admit that
But I recall when nobody gave my shit a listen
Now they all up on it, think I let 'em take a ride
Nigga, I'ma be the same until the day I die
You'll find inside I bring the realest from a sicker mind
Trench coat mafia we'll call it Columbine
Can't sell my soul, I'ma need that please
Lawd!
Tell me where to go now
I am lost on a path of redemption
 I thought they wanna murder me
Show me how to separate, it's an absurdity
Clarity is all I ask for these days
Somebody said that I should hate less and love more
Shit's hard man, these niggas kinda random
How the hell do you relate to what I've been through?
You ain't never seen a struggle quite like mine
Try to keep it all together but I might break
Put a bullet to my eyes for my soul's sake
I don't ever leave the house 'cause I don't feel safe
All I know is that I wanna find a better way
We gotta make it happen now, I cannot hesitate
God damn!
Knowledge you back in this bitch, will they listen?
Your problems you packaging
Impasse a poignant poet, put it right on the page
Plenty people pay attention from pity
I am surrounded by vultures and leeches
Evil entities that beg for a feature
Politely dismissed but it's still motherfuck 'em, I'm having enough in the sight of the ordinary
Now it's necessary, I adjust the tempo
Tell the truth to troops, I truly mean every word
I'm absurd, I assert a certain type of energy
I am fulfilled by the lyrics, I feel like they fuck with me
That's if they come with intentions intended
They're only deceitful, you pray for my spirit when I am deceased
Now they piss on my grave and my memory
Lessen the pain, I'll explain why I quit and submitted
Decipher the secrets inside of the sinister silent vision, very hungry
I try to achieve but the world is so sad that they stole it from me
So that someone that seldomly uses it can't see the beauty in what I create unless it has a monetary value
Dollars and cents
I want sinners to sacrifice for your repentance

Uh-uh

From the moment that I told myself I do this for the rest of my days
Irregardless of the plays of the fame or the fortune
I'm workin' with a vision I feel is more important
Than any monetary to me
I'm not concerned with the amount of money I currently count
Attention was all I wanted
That would mean I'm superficial and hypocritical
Write and live a life that they can diss but destitution is the normal form of fantasy
I'm happy when to wake up to reality and realize I really ain't shit
Who the fuck I ever reach, you even listen when I speak?
This speed is all they seem to talk about
I've been appointed as a poet, disposing many emotions
Supposedly all the pain is the part that makes it relatable
Opinions I don't need and you might as well keep 'em
I'm always too mean and I never make an apology
Appropriate a policy properly
This a positive proposition, the pencil cooperation
The quota by defamation, amazing by definition
Perfected by repetition, accepted by statisticians
Deceit a professional, put his life in the lyrics
I wanna give you the truth
I testify with the real, the feel is foreign to fakes
It's not familiar to snakes, I've made mistakes in the past
Gradually I progressed and graduated to a man
I tell myself I can again and against so I don't forget
Submissive within your actions, I'm actually reactin'
Relaxin' is for the weak and the fain of heart
I departed away from the negativity
Energy's an anomaly, modesty's a commodity
Modified by the masses, I've mastered the art of making 'em think
I could lead you to the water but I still can't force you to drink
I can influence your decision but I never make it for ya

Only effort I could ever give is legendary
The success of failure they will judge you by does not apply to me, myself nor I
The type of focus they remember for centuries
Documented is the greatest that ever did it but different to most
We had ulterior motives to motivate and subdue us
Assuming intentions were the purest they could possibly be
A monster to see, I plant a seed and watch it grow from the earth
You can't determine my worth, I'm not obliged to comply
I passed on any type of judgment, they don't know me at all
You look confused from my view, I do whatever I choose
Giving nothing but the Gospel, I supply through a sound
Complicated by the noise that I'm attempting to drown
Profound innovation defacing the soul is but someone control
I can see that it's hopeless

You don't wanna act on it

You don't want to go to bed with your head on the last moment
I'ma lie to ya, tell you what we had was in the past in a bad moment
And I'm tired of ya but I'm proud of ya
Not bad enough to make you sad
Enough to push out the lust and look past the dust and turn your back on it
Toughen up, put a patch on it
Buckle up, put a latch on it
Good enough for a rap or a sonnet
Feel the buzz from the , don't ya
Feel the love when I'm acting above it
We don't ever wanna feel lost
Cut that shit off
Bet I see you on the weekend
Cut yourself 
What you wanna do?
Look incredible
In a better mood
You look edible
I'm a better dude
Bet I see it through
And you see it too
What are we to do?
I'm in need of you
Woulda never thought that you and I'd cross paths
It's unbeatable

Ooh, I never meant to treat you wrong
I never meant to need you neither
I never thought I'd write this song
I bet you never thought you'd need me either

I can feel the pressure, yes I can (na, na, na)
No one there to lend a helping hand (na, na, na)
I just put this shit all on my back (na, na, na)
Everything in due time, that's a fact (na, na, na)

I wrote this shit and got lost, I did
In search of peace, I can't find my soul
My mind is running rampant, rampant
I hope they understand me, stand me
Can't take this shit for granted, granted
We more than just some rap niggas, that's a fact
I could take it way, way, way back
We done came a long way, way 
That's the truth and you know it is
I do for self when they don't believe us
Won't nobody give a helping hand
It's every man for his self
Boy they only want wealth
Stepping over the weak
Allow me to beseech the power
When I speak the  and the beats
I pray for enemies
In hopes I find peace
My life is looking up from the seat I sit
Platinum a downfall, but I see that shit
Tell 'em keep the extras, I don't need that shit
I'm looking for the exit, I testify yes
See I defy with the faith inside this
Bloom and blossom, I pray that we will
But don't no one care, for empathy's rare
I can't complain, I just keep on moving
Said give me space, allow me to do this

Homie I was working on my skills to make a play
But nigga tell me what's a break, I do this shit everyday
I been a massive monster moving like a strict dictator, young Fidel Castro
I catapult to kill the temporary, mister mercenary, more than likely mutilated
Many many give opinions but they sound regurgitated
I know, force submission with the sentences I stated
I ain't even going in, I swear I'm going Super Saiyan
My demeanor's like Vegeta, I defeated all my nemesis
I never underestimate my peers of competition
My position, no quitter, let me kill the opposition
Lord forgive me, get the gist of what I'm giving
See the vision and the image
I've been sinning since I was an adolescence
Digging out but working like a slave, a conversation getting shorter
Sorta sure that I can soar, I'm sourcing the inspiration
Disappear, revise a line, I went away for hibernation
My hyperboles are purposely proportionate in weight
I want respect so I'ma take it, there's no way you can escape it

I wrote an actual masterpiece, it's the flow with your majesty
I masterfully maneuver, my mind is a mausoleum
The walls are painted with murals, my portrait is purely perfect
I personally designed it and  in front of a pew
It's punitive for the scription, my diction is legendary
My ledger leaving a mark to conceive in the ceremony
Erroneous reciprocity  far from anomalies
I'm appalled at the paradigm, they applaudin' these parasites
I'm apart of it all, I can't take the tentative temperaments
Told a tale of tenacity, giving it content
I attempt to connect the dots but I thought you wanted a lie
What I saw was something astonishing, see the shit that you laundering
Lives are loosely affected, effect with a lethal weapon
I'm well aware of the weary, my theory has been exhausted
I had a passion inside but it died or I think I lost it
My fault, I'm forced to the feeling of fear that they fabricated
Let's face it, I'm fucking faded
The faint of heart are excused
Swear that I'm going harder then Jordan
It's '96, it's Seattle, silencing crowds
And you see the flick of the wrist
I insist I inflict some pain on the vain, now are you convinced?

Boy you better tell 'em I do it
Boy you better tell 'em I do it, better tell 'em I do it
Boy you better tell 'em I do it
Boy you better tell 'em I do it, better tell 'em I do it

Prince,UnKnown,2016.0,"Heard your voice this morning
Calling out my name
It had been so long, since I've heard
That it didn't really sound quite the same, no

Take 'em on a ride
I ain't got the time
I've been living like tomorrow isn't promised
Do this shit like a professional, you novice
Every barrier of this, I will abolish
I don't make apologies for what I do
I'm the dopest nigga breathing but you knew it
Had a chance to be a part and then you blew it
I'm a partisan, I swear a nigga never judge
You can tell I do this shit because I truly love it
Getting better at the craft is all I ever covet
Lyrically my shit's impeccable, I really does this
Name another nigga doper than I
To tell the truth, you wouldn't get a reply
Just call my name and I'll be there in a second no
Sicker sentences be sending through your stereo
And who the fuck you know could make these people lean
I dream about being the best, you best believe that I'm a fiend
I see the scene as pretty barren, embarrassing with the content
The key is my transparency, you can see what I am
I give you all of me to the second then understand
Analyzing the mind of a man on a mission
But it's really fucking simple, I'm tryna get you to listen
Won't you please pay attention when you hear a nigga speaking?
We been at it everyday, we even working on the weekend
Reach the peak to see the plateau, and I could never let go
Just call me whenever you need me
And don't hesitate when you dialing
These niggas whylin'
I need a challenge
That means I don't have no time for your nonsense
Please take your problems, while you act childish
I'm sacrificing my sights set on high bitch
I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch

I wanna give you loving when you say so
And do you think of me when I am not around?
Aiming high you could believe a nigga lay low
I got difficulties dealing with my caseload
I am working to repress the past
I been running but I'm stagnant
Never pass me, when I pull up in the Jag yeah, with a bag yeah
Bumping Juvie in the fast lane, try to catch me
Wrote a masterpiece, it's , you would grasp it
Got a blunt then nigga pass that
Where the cash at?
I been working like a madman
Feeling manic, shit fresh like Mannie, I'm the man yeah
But you know a nigga plan this, doing damage
I am ahead of my time, do you even understand that?
I got a purpose and I better see it through
There ain't no time to wonder a nigga finna do
So we can hop up in the whip and put eyeglass on
Any suggestion that you have, I be hearing it out
Backseat, two blunts, I be feeling her out
It's kinda hard to call my name with my dick in your mouth
A nigga putting in some work when I be digging her out
I had a moment of euphoria, I figured it out
Elimination of the ego is a beautiful thing
Lemme unite it with a unique cadence, but do you feel vacant?
Nigga we don't chase 'em, I erase and replace 'em
I'm a sin and a saviour, so my lyrics will save you
When you really attentive and your intentions intended to take the Tension out the room, I feel, I feel
She a sucka for the groove, I kill, I kill
See the message getting through, I'm real, I'm real
Only if I approve it, do not confuse it
You see the way that we do this
I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much

I know I'm down at the moment, not accepting it
I'm broker than a motherfucker, my regret is this
I should have never tried to spit
The moment I dropped out of college is constantly in my mind
I wish I could forgive myself so that my wound might heal
When I'm looking in the mirror, all that I can see is fear
I couldn't comprehend the consequence that came with my decision
Maybe I was never meant to be nothing from the beginning
I'm sick and tired of my livin'
I'm really looking to end it, my attitude is offensive
I guess that I realize that I'm actually unimportant

Guarantee I'm astounding, screaming it out loudly

Don't hibernate

I can tell you wanted something meaningful, I'll make it deep

Get a sense of the pain tho'
Any idea what the fuck that it really feel like
The infiltration and destruction of communities of colors
Turn 'em into users, consuming, constantly covet
Accustomed to coming up short, of course, when the rent is due
Dealing with inequalities, lower personal standards
Indecent conditions for living, limited opportunities
Insist for something better than what the fuck you were given
Like public housing and government assistance
A victim of circumstances
No silver spoon in your mouth
Or a father inside the house
It ain't a stereotype when your life is like a statistic
Attempted to do it legally, ain’t nobody that’s hiring
Customer service, minimum wages never inspire
I'm tired of feeling affected, the product of this environment
Where violence ain’t a vice, it's an intricatal part of life
Well the fit and strong will survive but the meek, we seem to struggle
A plan to keep us in poverty
Niggas don't ever vote so we see political policies
Set in place for injustice
For judge and 
And galavant with the D.A
Uncontrollable hypocrites, disenfranchising people that plead for equal equality
Lawlessly laying sentences, send 'em somewhere to suffer in a silent cell of seclusion
Assume a  they giving with darker pigment
Petition for peace, I feel I can’t breathe
I am swimming in the deep
And they giving badges to killers
Elected officials with bills that passing inside of Congress
 cause hysteria, aiming at the incompetent
A lack of education and knowledge, that's what the problem is
Stop and frisk but the reason is biased
It's off of ignorance, fear of someone that's different
Judging off of appearance
Like I know that nigga rolling with a pocket full of stones
He headed home alone,  attire he was wearing
Apparent police will profile
This ain't the Land of the Free, there's a fee
Ain't no where to flee from the scene I set, it's obscene
It's insane, we're seeing the same amount of hatred distributed to minorities
But most importantly these legal homicides committed by these people but they supposed to serve and protect
It's incorrect or  as I strategize for the rise
Hate  lies
We're witnessing genocide

I believe that they felt it was more valuable, to sacrifice, a particular sector, sector of America, and a race of people in America, in order to save the whole country.

Resuscitate the beat then I slay

Promise the shit that we on
The foundation's laid so the work can survive for eons
Nevertheless we zone in then analyze the details
Considered minute for the feeble minded

We could watch the truth unfurl to the point of disgust
I maneuver the metaphor, make sure the track is concussed
I focus, dedicated, my intentions surpassing the cusp
As I grasp for more gratuity, gradually gratify
In attempt to gather my thoughts that I saw but forgot
I've allotted no time for mistakes
All of this done in one take
Fully functioning feng shui
Fundamentally sound, I'm a student soon to consume
My appeal is purely allure
But attention spans are short
And they forget all the words
It's like you never resisted but still persistent consistently
For the fact that it's peace and love and the passion we found

The crudite I display's a rudimental adjustment
I juxtapose and compose as far as the effort goes
I control and contort this shit, forcing it, nigga never

Pack,UnKnown,2016.0,"In the trap, I put away my cameras
With the killers, dealers, swipers and the scammers
Never got the bag up in my comfort zone
I don't get played, I just play along
It's so many layers to this, that I can't forgive and forget, when I reminisce
Off of that liquor, fell deeply in love, but the love fucked me over so steady red cup
Met a plug, he flew me out to Texas
Steady snorting coke and poppin' Perc depressants
But we all just trying to soften up the edges
When you worth a couple mill' that's not excessive
Neighbors think I'm trappin' out the Lexus
Fucking up a cheque and fucking up my checklist
So be careful who you gotta get in bed with
'Cause the snake was hissing, then he got arrested
I wasn't around, and neither was you
Loyalty got me out here like a fool
I lost everything, you was out on the move
Not everyone gon' have the same heart as you
But you can't have hope without the pain
The blue faces smelling like cocaine
And politics and war, they both the same
You can't see what I see without a crane

Hit em with the pack I say, lawd
Hit em with the pack I say, lawd (pack, pack) x8

Got a  right here, and it's righteous
I got 'em coming back quick as I write this, lightwork
Let me high step, then I elevate, I never hesitate
I take my time with it, I blow your mind with it
I'm out of this world, let it unfurl
Now it's confirmed, pray it all works
First and foremost, a fuck I will never give
Led with malevolence, the rhymes that I'm peddling
Why you sleeping on me like a super bunch of sedatives
Why am I surrounded by these pessimists, peons
Never been the type of motherfucker you could lean on
Niggas get they fiend and they greed on, yeah
So now I grieve them, breathe in, breathe out
I, never told lies, I tell the whole truth
They tell a tall tale, agree to disagree
I disregard regardless I got it down pat
I make 'em fall back, I got a tight plan
Rhymes hand over fist for a lump sum
Kick dope flows that they can't keep up with
I praise on the week then beseech on a Sunday
I, took a one way trip can't go back
I hit em with the give and go, and tell 'em hold that
All in, never half-ass
Niggas been capped but I'm rolling on E, lawd

Hit em with the pack I say, lawd
Hit em with the pack I say, lawd (pack, pack) x8",https://genius.com/Kaan-pack-lyrics
