Colors,Greatest Hits: The Evidence,1988.0,"Yo Iz, let's do this

I am a nightmare walkin', psychopath talkin'
King of my jungle, just a gangster stalkin'
Livin' life like a firecracker, quick is my fuse
Vendettas of death back; the colors I choose
Red or Blue, Cuz or Blood, it just don't matter
Sucka dive for your life when my shotgun scatters
The gangs of L.A. will never die - just multiply

You see they hit us then we hit them
Then we hit them and they hit us
, man
It's like a war, ya know what I'm sayin'
People don't even understand
They don't even know what they dealing with
You wanna get rid of the gangs it's gonna take a lotta work
But people don't understand the size of this
This is no joke man, this is real

You don't know me, fool
You disown me, cool
I don't need your assistance, social persistence
Any problem I got I just put my fist in
My life is violent but violent is life
Peace is a dream, reality is a knife
My colors, my honor, my colors, my all
With my colors upon me one soldier stands tall
Tell me what have you left me, what have I got?
Last night in cold blood my young brother got shot
My homeboy got jacked
My mother's on crack
My sister can't work cause her arms show tracks
Madness insanity, live in profanity
Then some punk claimin' they're understandin' me
Give me a break, what world do you live in
Death is my set, guess my religion

Yo my brother was a gang banger
And all my homeboys bang
I don't know why I do it man, I just do it
I never had much of nothing man
Look at you man, you've got everything going for yourself
And I ain't got nothing man, I've got nothing
I'm living in the ghetto man
Just look at me man, look at me

My pants are saggin', braided hair
Suckas stare but I don't care
My game ain't knowledge, my game's fear
I've no remorse so squares beware
But my true mission is just revenge
You ain't in my set, you ain't my friend
Wear the wrong color your life could end
Homicide's my favorite binge

Listen to me man
No matter whatcha do don't ever join a gang
You don't wanna be in it man
You're just gonna end up in a mix of dead friends and time in jail
 I
Know, if
I had a chance like you
I would never be in a gang man
But I didn't have a chance
You know I wish I did

I'll just walk like a giant, police defiant
You'll say to stop but I'll say that I can't
My gang's my family, it's all that I have
I'm a star, on the walls is my autograph
You don't like it, so you know where you can go
Cause the streets are my stage and terror's my show
Psycho-analyze tried diagnosin' me, why?
It wasn't your brother that brutally died
But it was mine, so let me define
My territory; don't cross the line
Don't try to act crazy cause that shit don't faze me
If you ran like a punk, it wouldn't amaze me
Cause my colors death
Though we all want peace
But our war won't end
'Till all wars cease

See the wars of the street gangs will always get to me, man
But I don't wanna be down with this situationm man
But I'm in here, if I had something better to do I think I'd do it But right now, I'm just down here boy
I'm trying to get money cause I'm smart
I'm gonna get paid while I'm out here
I'm gonna get that paper, ya know what I'm saying
If I had a chance like you
Maybe I would be in school
But I'm not, I'm out here living day to day surviving
And I'm willing to die for my colors

Yo, please stop cause I want y'all to live
This is Ice-T, peace",https://genius.com/Ice-t-colors-lyrics
99 Problems,Home Invasion,1993.0,"Yeah, last year a lot of motherfuckers asked me
Why I didn't do no old sex nasty shit
But this year I went down to Miami and got my nigga from 2 Live
Brother Marquis in the house! (Yeah I'm the motherfuckin nigga)
Yeah, we gonna answer the question about girl problems
All these niggas is havin girl problem, Marq
(Huh, tell them man, tell them how it is)
Lemme tell you what time is it..
I got a ho from the East, got a ho from the West
Got a ho that likes to jack it off and rub it in her chest
I got a ho from the North, a ho from the South
A ho that likes to suck it long and hold it in her mouth
I got a bitch with hair, a bitch with none
A bitch with a knife, a bitch with a gun
A bitch with a ass big as a TV set
And there's a bitch over there; hey, the one I'm gonna get
But yo but maybe not, she might not like me though
No sweat to a vet; I'll slam her sister, though
Word, Ice in the whole damn herd
I fuck 'em all and leave 'em on the curve
I got a bitch with a mink, who rocks a fat gold link
Who likes to fuck me with her ass up on the kitchen sink
Got a bitch with tits, a bitch with ass
A bitch with none, but hey, I'd give her a pass
And I love 'em all, I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you having girl problems, I feel bad for you son
Got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit it

Nah, a bitch ain't one

I got a bitch that's old, a bitch that's new
A bitch who love velvet in the colors blue
I got a bitch who's fat, a bitch who's built
A bitch who all her titties give out powdered milk
I got a bitch who's funny, a bitch who ain't
A bitch who can sing, a bitch who cain't
A bitch who loves fucking on a airplane..
I even got a bitch off Soul Train
I got a bitch who rolls a rag-top Benz
Long ends
I got a bitch who's broke as a bum
But she's the most fun
I got a bitch who play piano, a bitch who don't
A bitch who dances naked, a bitch who won't
A bitch who's short, a bitch who's tall
A bitch who burns my pager with priority calls
And I love 'em all, I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you son
Got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit me

Yo Marquis - you from Miami man why don't you show these motherfuckers all the over the world
The 2 Live style of how the bitches treat a mothafuckin' fly nigga like you

I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one of them
I don't trip on hoes, cause I don't need none of them
Pussy's the temptation, dick's the persuasion
All hoes suck cock nigga how you play 'em?
That's why I don't sleep on 'em, I just freak on 'em
Stick dick in they mouth; take it out and I skeet on 'em
The nigga the one-nighter, the bitch exciter
I only love my hoes when I'm going up inside her
Problem number one is getting money
I'd rather taste the green than sip the honey
So don't expect nothing cause I ain't offering
I go hard on my bitches, cause I'm never never softening
Putting the demand on 'em, fuck 'em and scram on 'em
The ""wham, bam, thank you ma'am"" game is ran on 'em
So fuck how you feel, your fucking cheap thrill
I hope you took the pill cause I won't pay the bill
Getting pussy's just another expense
If pussy pays the bills then dick pays the rent
I only need a ho for one thing and that's to cum
I've got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one


Ha! Yo Marquis my motherfucker you got problems man?
(A bitch ain't one) Aww shit!
Now let me tell you how to do this shit
 I got a bitch that loves to G
 She'll fuck you right after she fucks me
 I got a bitch who loves both
 I got a bitch who loves handcuffs and ropes
 I got a bitch that's fast, a bitch that's slow
 A bitch that's a virgin and a bitch that's a ho
 A bitch that lies
 A bitch that's true
 A bitch who's a man because they're ""Bitches 2""
 I got a bitch that's cool
 A bitch that's hot
 A bitch who loves rap, a bitch who loves rock
 A bitch who's lost and one who knows where it's at
 She gets up under me and purrs like a cat
 I got a bitch that runs, I got a bitch that walks
 I got a bitch that yells, I got a bitch who talks
 I got a bitch that's dirty, got a bitch that's neat
 I got a super fine bitch that I knocked in the swap meet

And I love 'em all, I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you having girl problems, I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit me...
No, a bitch ain't one

Huh, you know a bitch ain't one

Youknahmsayin? I got problems with my mothafuckin' rent Marquis
But a bitch ain't one
Man you got yourself nothing man
Fuck them raggedy stank-ass hoes nigga
A bitch ain't one
I got a problems staying out here on these streets
With the police trying to take a nigga out, y'know?
But a bitch ain't one
Got problems with motherfuckers.. buying my records
But a bitch ain't one
Fuck 'em all, nigga fuck them motherfuckers
Youknahmsayin? A bitch ain't one
Got problems man
All them motherfuckers can kiss my mothafuckin' ass.. for real
Really, niggas worrying about bitches
They better, they better find something else to worry about",https://genius.com/Ice-t-99-problems-lyrics
I’m Your Pusher,Power,1988.0,"Yo what's up man, I need to get high man
I need to get hold of some big time dope man
You know where I can get a ki?
I know where you can get an LP
LP, man? Have you went crazy man?
I'm talking about some dope man
I need to get high right now man
Why don't you hook me up with a 5-O?
I can hook you up with a 12 inch
12 inch? Man have you went crazy?
You don't even know what time it is
Out here on the streets and don't know what time it is
Man youse a fool
Yo homeboy you a fool
You don't know what time it is
Out here, messing up your mind
You know what I'm sayin'?
This is Ice-T talkin' to you boy
I'mma tell you what time it is

Yo, it's time for me to pump the volume
No problem, the record's revolvin'
Evil's
 the mixer, I'm the rap trixister
Paparazzi on the bum rush for pictures
Ice, coolin', yo colder than ever
Punk-Executioner E, pull the lever
Rotate the wax then cut an' axe the tracks
Push up the levels till the red lights max
Don't try to size up, you better wise up
To the rap criminals, we're succeeded
Dope beats and lyrics, no beepers needed
For this drug deal, I'm the big wheel
The dope I'm sellin', you don't smoke, you feel
Out on the dance floor, on my world tour
I'm sellin' dope in each and every record store
I'm the kingpin when the wax spins
Crack or smack will take you to a sure end
You don't need it, just throw that stuff away
You wanna get high? Let the record play

Aww man, I like this dope here man
It's feelin' alright boy
What you say your name was man?

I'm your momma
I'm your daddy
I'm that nigga in the alley
I'm your brother when you need
A true player to emcee
You know me, a true friend
Your main boy, thick and thin
MC Ice-T
I'm your pusher

I know you're lovin' this drug as it's comin' out your speaker
Bass through the bottons, highs thru the tweeters
But this base you don't need a pipe
Just a tempo to keep your hype
Groovin' like I see you doin'
Some stupid crack would just ruin
Your natural high, why? That ain't fly
And anyone who says it is, lies
Move like I knew you would, like I knew could
And if you ain't cracked out, then I know you should
Be able to give me a clap, to match exact with the track
And since I know that you ain't, I expect that
Oh now this jam is lit, it's like the ultimate
People high off dope but still physically fit
I'll make a million bucks, pack my dough in trucks
From sellin' dope beats, dope rhymes, dope cuts
I'll be the biggest dope dealer in history
Because all the fly will be high off that Ice-T

Aww man, you ain't ever lie, man
This dope's alright man
I gotta get back with you man
Let me get your number man


I'll bring it to boil, Evil E rock it up
You want it? I don't think you got enough
Last suckers crossed, Syndicate shot 'em up
Cops found 'em in the lake bottom up
I don't play when it comes to my dope
I check my lyrics close, like with a microscope
I don't clean 'em up with no Ivory soap
I leave 'em hard and pure, hope that you can cope
Because you might O.D. if you overdrive
This record, tape or CD, because the sound I've
Created on this wax is like a chemical
And the knowledge I give makes me invincible

Aww Mr. Dopeman
I'm lovin' you man
You got it goin' on man
What else you got?
I got some of that 
Kool Moe Dee
Aww yeah man, I want some of that
Got some 
Doug E. Fresh
Aww yeah gimme an ounce of that
I want that all night long
I got some Eric B. & Rakim
Aww that is some real dope right there
I got some LL Cool J
Nah, nah man, I don't want none of that
You can keep that man
I got some 
Boogie Down Productions, KRS-One
Aww now you're talkin' man, come on
Public Enemy
Yeah don't stop, don't stop
Biz Markie
Makin' music with yo mouth Biz
I love it


The cops don't know what to do, because my dope breaks through
No matter what they do, my stuff gets to you
Kickin' on the Boulevard, my tempo's hyped and hard
I don't ask, the ICE just bogards
Sire Records puts me out, with Warner Bros. clout
My dope hits the streets with no doubt
Evil E adds the cut, then removes it
IZ checks for purity, then approves it
And then you get it, try it and like it
And if it ain't potent, we remix and spike it
To bring you the pure dope, not a noose in a rope
Because if you're doin' crack, you're on death row
You're just a toy punk, to mess with that junk
You want some real dope, come look in my trunk
The dope I'm sellin' is life, 100% legit
So get real fool, and try some real hit

Word up my brother
You got me high as a kite
I feel good tonight
Ice-T, you alright

I'm your pusher",https://genius.com/Ice-t-im-your-pusher-lyrics
New Jack Hustler,O.G. Original Gangster,1991.0,"Hustler, word, I pull the trigger long
Grit my teeth, spray till every nigga's gone
Got my block sewn, armored dope spots
Last thing I sweat's a sucka punk cop
Move like a king when I roll, hops
You try to flex, bang, another nigga drops
You gotta deal with this cause there's no way out
Why? Cash money ain't never gonna play out
I got nothin to lose, much to gain
In my brain, I got a capitalist migraine
I gotta get paid tonight, you muthafuckin right
Pickin' my grip, check my bitch, keep my game tight
So many hoes on my jock, think I'm a movie star
Nineteen, I got a fifty thousand dollar car
Go to school, I ain't goin for it
Kiss my ass, bust the cap on the Moet
Cause I don't wanna hear that crap
Why? I'd rather be a New Jack... Hustler

Hustler
Hustler
Hustler
H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler

Yo man you know what I'm sayin?
You got it goin on my man, I like how it's goin down
You got the fly cars, the girls, the jewels
Look at that ring right there
I know it's real, it's gotta be real
Man, you the flyest nigga I seen in my life!
Yo man, I just wanna roll with you man
How can I be down?

What's up? You say you wanna be down?
Ease back, or motherfucker get beat down
Out my face, fool I'm the illest
Bulletproof, I die harder than Bruce Willis
Got my crew in effect, I bought em new Jags
So much cash, gotta keep it in Hefty bags
All I think about is keys and Gs
Imagine that, me workin at Mickey D's
 (ha ha ha ha)
That's a joke cause I'm never gonna be broke
When I die there'll be bullets and gun smoke
Ya don't like my lifestyle? Fuck you!
I'm rollin with the New Jack crew
And I'm a hustler

H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler
New Jack, New Jack..........

Here I come, so you better break North
As I stride, my gold chains glide back and forth
I care nothing 'bout you, and that's evident
All I love's my dope and dead presidents
Sound crazy? Well it isn't
The ends justifies the means, that's the system
I learned that in school then I dropped out
Hit the streets, checked a grip, and now I got clout
I had nothing, and I wanted it
You had everything, and you flaunted it
Turned the needy into the greedy
With cocaine, my success came speedy
Got me twisted, jammed into a paradox
Every dollar I get, another brother drops
Maybe that's the plan, and I don't understand
God damn----you got me sinkin in quicksand
But since I don't know, and I ain't never learned
I gotta get paid, I got money to earn
With my posse, out on the ave
Bump my sounds, crack a forty and laugh
Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam
Is this a nightmare? Or the American dream?
So think twice if you're coming down my block
You wanna journey through hell? Well shit gets hot
Pregnant teens, children's screams
Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam
You don't come here much, and ya better not
Wrong move (bang), ambulance cot
I gotta get more money than you got
So what, if some motherfucker gets shot?
That's how the game is played
Another brother slayed, the wound is deep
But they're givin us a band aid
My education's low but I got long dough
I'm raised like a pit bull, my heart pumps nitro
Sleep on silk, lie like a politician
My Uzi's my best friend, cold as a mortician
Lock me up, it's genocidal catastrophe
There'll be another one after me!

That's DJ Evil E

Islam creates the beats
You girls look so sexy
I wish you all were up here with me
You drive me crazy with them big ole butts
Girls, let's get butt naked and fuck

Tonight, I'm trying to make this real clear, dear
I've no time to whisper in your ear
No time to remove your fears
I just wanna get near
Get butt naked and roll around
Move our bodies like up and down
Do that stuff that your mama call smut
Girls, let's get butt naked and fuck

Come on, you know you wanna do it too
It's good to me and it's good to you
I only speak what's true
You say you don't, but I know you do
Come on up to my room
We'll undress by the light of the moon
Lay down and I'll caress that butt
Girls, let's get butt naked and fuck

I mean real stupid and nasty
I know what you want, so you don't have to ask me
Just lay back and I'll operate
Jimbrowski will go to work and penetrate
And then we'll both feel great
Make your move tonight, girl -- don't hesitate
We both want it, don't make it tough
Girls, let's get butt naked and fuck

Homeboys, you know the situation
You're trying to rap but they give you frustration
Nose in the air, turning you down
When you really wanna say, ""Yo baby, let's get down""
But you don't, you keep fronting
Kicking conversation, ain't talking 'bout nothing
When all that's really on your mind is what?
""Yo baby, let's get butt naked and fuck""

That's right, if you're a man you want it
If you're a woman, you tease him and flaunt it
But my crew got to have it
And after they dog it, I autograph it
The Syndicate don't lecture
We move in a group, seduce and capture
And if the posse has good luck
The girls will get butt naked and fuck that night

Islam takes the pictures
And girls, I'mma say Evil E's gonna get ya
Get ya illing in a nude mode
A double X-rated episode
Hotel rooms cold explode when my posse unloads
Sex in effect when we're on the road

Put your hands up in the air
If you love sex -- I know you're out there
Safe sex that is
Ya gotta be careful with this '88 sex biz
But that's another song
Girls, move your bodies sexy and the brothers will come along
Homeboys, move in on that butt and say
Girls, let's get butt naked and fuck",https://genius.com/Ice-t-girls-lgbnaf-lyrics
O.G. Original Gangster,O.G. Original Gangster,1991.0,"Ten years ago I used to listen to rappers flow
Talkin' bout the way they rocked the mic at the disco
I liked how that shit was goin' down
Dreamt about ripping the mic with my own sound
So I tried to write rhymes something like them
My boys said, ""That ain't you, Ice! That shit sounds like them.""
So I sat back, thought up a new track
Didn't fantasize, kicked the pure facts
Motherfuckers got scared cause they was unprepared
Who would tell it how it really was? Who dared?
A motherfucker from the West Coast, L.A
South Central, fool, where the Crips and the Bloods play
When I wrote about parties, it didn't fit
""6 N' the Mornin,"" that was the real shit

O.G. Original Gangster

When I wrote about parties, someone always died
When I tried to write happy, yo, I knew I lied
'Cause, I lived a life of crime Why play ya blind?
A simple look and anyone with two cents would know I'm
A hardcore player from the streets
Rapping bout hardcore topics over hardcore drum beats
A little different than the average though
Jet you through the fast lane, drop ya on death row
Cause anybody who's been there knows that
Life ain't so lovely on the blood-soaked fast track
That invincible shit don't work
Throw ya in a joint, you'll be coming out feet first
So I blast the mic with my style
Sometimes I'm ill and other times buckwild
But the science is always there
I'd be a true sucker if I acted like I didn't care
I rap for brothers just like myself
Dazed by the game in a quest for extreme wealth
But I kick it to you hard and real
One wrong move, and your cap's peeled
I ain't no super hero, I ain't no Marvel comic
But when it comes to game I'm atomic
At dropping it straight, point blank and untwisted
No imagination needed, cause I lived it
This ain't no fucking joke, this shit is real to me
I'm Ice-T, O.G
[Hook}

Two weeks ago I was out at the disco
Two brothers stepped up to me and said, ""Hey yo, Ice
We don't think you're down. What set ya claiming?""
E drew the Glock, yo my set's aiming!
Dumb motherfucker, try to roll on me, please!
I'm protected by a thousand emcees
And hoodlums and hustlers and bangers with jheri curls
We won't even count the girls
Cause they got my back and I got theirs too
Fight for the streets when I'm on Oprah or Donahue
They try to sweat a nigga but they just didn't figure
That my wit's as quick as a hair trigger
""He's not your everyday-type prankster.""
I'm Ice-T, the original gangster


So step to me if you think that you're ready to
Got on your bullet proof? Well mine's going right thru
This ain't no game to me, it's hollow fame to me
Without respect from streets, so I don't claim be
The hardest motherfucker on earth
Catch me slipping, I can't even get worked
But I don't slip that often, there's a coffin
Waiting for the brother who comes off soft when
The real fucking shit goes down, take a look around
All them pussies can be found
They talk a mean fight but fight like hoes
I'm from South Central, fool, where everything goes
Snatch you out your car so fast you'll get whiplash
Numbers on your rooftop for when the copters pass
Gangbangers don't carry no switchblades
Every kid's got a Tec 9 or a hand grenade
Thirty-seven killed last week in a crack war
Hostages tied up and shot in the liquor store
Nobody gives a fuck
""The children have to go to school!"" Well, moms, good luck!
Cause the shit's fucked up bad I use my pad and pen
And my lyrics break out mad
I try to write about fun and the good times
But the pen yanks away and explodes and destroys the rhyme
Maybe it's just cause of where I'm from
L.A. (*bang!*) that was a shotgun!",https://genius.com/Ice-t-og-original-gangster-lyrics
Body Count,O.G. Original Gangster,1991.0,"Ice-T, after your tremendous success on your past album
Some have said; you have sold out
Because of the use of rock'n'roll in your music
How do you reply to that?

You see, a lotta people don't realize that, you know
Rock'N'Roll is truly black music
It was created by Chuck Berry, Little Richard
Even black people like that, who started it off back in the day
You know, and as far as I'm concerned music is music
I don't look at it as Rock or R&B all that kind of stuff
I just look at it as music, you know
And anybody who said that I've sold out, they can basically suck my dick
Cause I really don't give a fuck about that shit, you know
But uhh.. I do what I like, I happen to like Rock'N'Roll
And uhh.. I feel sorry for anybody who only listens to one form of music
You know, right now, I got my own Rock band, it's got to jump off
It's really black hardcore band called Body Count
And uhh.. on some of the records I'm like laying some vocals on it
And uhh.. I got a tape of it right here, yo, check it out

You know, sometimes I sit at home, you know, and I watch TV
And I wonder what would be like to live in some place like
You know, The Cosby Show, Ozzie and Harriet
You know, where Cops come and got your cat outta the tree
All your friends died at old age
But you see.. I live in South Central, Los Angeles
And unfortunately... SHIT AIN'T LIKE THAT!!
It's real fucked up!

God damn, what a brother gotta do
To get a message through
To the red and white and blue
What? I gotta die before you realize
I was a brother with opened eyes?
The world's insane while you drink champagne
And I'm living in black reign
You try to ban the A.K
I got ten of them stashed
With a case of hand grenades

(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!

You'd know what to do
If your kid got killed on the way to school
Or a cop shot your kid in the back yard
Shit would hit the fan motherfucker and it will hit real hard
I hear it every night, another gun fight
The tension mounts, on with the Body Count

Yo Beatmaster V, take these motherfuckers to South Central
Ha ha ha, yeah, fuck that
I hear it every night, another gun fight
The tension mounts, on with the Body Count
Last weekend thirty seven kids killed in gang warfare in my back yard
NO!!, NO!!, NO!!
Yo Ernie C, take these motherfuckers home, yeah
Yo, we're in the house, Body Count fool, 1991 motherfucker
I hear it every night, another gun fight
The tension mounts, on with the Body Count

God damn what a brother gotta do
To get a message through
To the red and white and you?
What? I gotta die before you realize
I was a nigga with opened eyes?
The world's insane while you drink champagne
And I'm living in black reign
Don't you hear the guns?
You stupid, dumb, dick sucking, bum politicians!!

What's up?!
What's happening Cous'?
WESTSIIIDE!!

Here we go, another one
Iceberg, Gangsta Rap 2006, 8th album, SMG

Time to take you back to the days of old
64 Chevys, big fat gold
Out to the west where the gangstas roam
South Central, L.A.. my home
We was out there feeling that Hip-Hop beat
But couldn't connect to the New York streets
So we took our bandanas and we tied them up
Rolled up in the studio and laid it rough
Ice Cube and them niggas with the 'tudes
Showed a motherfucker how to blast at dudes ""BLAW!!""
COME ON!! Dr. Dre, N.W.A
Eazy-E and 'Ren, Fuck what you say!
Too Short kept it raw for them niggas up North
Geto Boys, we was like to fuck the law
W.C. nigga, sag your pants
We taught you how to gangbang and to crip dance

This ain't no R&B this is Gangsta Rap
Bitches get smacked, busters get jacked
Front if you want, you'll get laid on your back
It's about guns and drugs and ho's and clubs

Cypress Hill made a nigga understand
How I can just kill a man
Long Beach out of the dark, came Snoop
Skinny little nigga not scared to shoot
Dogg Pound Gangsters, Kurupt and Daz
Suge had the whole Death grow on blast
King Tee motherfucker Warren G
Nate Dogg reppin that 213
Don't front motherfucker don't hate
Compton's Most Wanted, MC Eiht
Throw your sets up niggas like you don't give a damn
Inglewood, Mack 10, Watts was KAM


So you wanna really know what's real on the Mic!
My little homie 'Pac lost his life
East coast, West coast, Gun-talk rules
Cocaine, big wheels, ho's and jewels
Down South, gold teeth, niggas is real ""Dirty South""
Gangsta Rap got mass appeal
Little white boys in 'burbs got heat
A ghetto is a ghetto and a street is a street
Eliminate the poverty disease
And we'll start rapping about birds and trees
You can get shot, no matter how much fucking cash you got
You can never get away, the streets stay hot (*Gunshot*)
And gangsters ain't the ones to push
They'll kill you a second ask president Bush",https://genius.com/Ice-t-gangsta-rap-lyrics
Freedom of Speech,The Iceberg / Freedom of Speech... Just Watch What You Say,1989.0,"Intro
A-yo Ice, man. I'm working on this term paper for college. What's the First Amendment?
Verse 1
Freedom of Speech, that's some motherfuckin' bullshit
You say the wrong thing, they'll lock your ass up quick
The FCC says ""Profanity - No Airplay""?
They can suck my dick while I take a shit all day
Think I give a fuck about some silly bitch named Gore?
Yo PMRC, here we go, raw
Yo Tip, what's the matter? You ain't gettin' no dick?
You're bitchin' about rock'n'roll, that's censorship, dumb bitch
The Constitution says we all got a right to speak
Say what we want Tip, your argument is weak
Censor records, TV, school books too
And who decides what's right to hear? You?
Hey PMRC, you stupid fuckin' assholes
The sticker on the record is what makes 'em sell gold
Can't you see, you alcoholic idiots
The more you try to suppress us, the larger we get
Verse 2

Fuck that right! I want the right to talk
I want the right to speak, I want the right to walk
Where I wanna, yell and I'm gonna
Tell and rebel every time I'm on a
Microphone on the stage cold illin'
The knowledge I drop will be heard by millions
We ain't the problems, we ain't the villains
It's the suckers deprivin' the truth from our children
You can't hide the fact, Jack
There's violence in the streets every day, any fool can recognise that
But you try to lie and lie
And say America's some motherfuckin' apple pie
Yo, you gotta be high to believe that
You're gonna change the world by a sticker on a record sleeve
Cos once you take away my right to speak
Everybody in the world's up shit creek
Verse 3
Let me tell you about down south
Where a motherfucker might as well not even have a mouth
Columbus, Georgia, said they'd lock me up
If I got on the stage in my show and said ""Fuck""
So I thought for a minute and said ""No
I wasn't even gonna do a damned show""
Cos for me to change my words from my rhymes
Is never gonna happen cos there's no sell outs on mine
But I vowed to get those motherfuckers one day
They even 
arrested Bobby Brown and Cool J
Yo, they got their's comin', cos I'm mad and I'm gunnin'
Homeboys, and there's no runnin'
I'm gonna tell you how I feel about you
No bull, no lies, no slack, just straight fact
Columbus, Georgia, you can suck my dick
You ain't nothin' but a piece of fuckin' shit on the damned map
Verse 4
Freedom of Speech, let 'em take it from me
Next they'll take it from you, then what you gonna do?
Let 'em censor books, let 'em censor art
PMRC
, this is where the witch hunt starts
You'll censor what we see, we read, we hear, we learn
The books will burn
You better think it out
We should be able to say anything, our lungs were meant to shout
Say what we feel, yell out what's real
Even though it may not bring mass appeal
Your opinion is yours, my opinion is mine
If you don't like what I'm sayin'? Fine
But don't close it, always keep an open mind
A man who fails to listen is blind
We only got one right left in the world today
Let me have it or throw The Constitution away
Outro (Jello Biafra)
What they're trying to do with radio, with this, uh, 
McCarran-Walter Act
 and a lot of other ways, is start by saying that they're protecting the public from wicked rock bands, or girlie magazines, or whatever. But, if you follow the chain of dominoes that falls down what they're really trying to do is shut off our access to information itself
If they can't do it by law they know there's other ways to do it",https://genius.com/Ice-t-freedom-of-speech-lyrics
Straight Up Nigga,O.G. Original Gangster,1991,"Yo check this out
A lot of people get mad cause I use the word nigga
You know what I'm saying they don't like the fact that I use the word nigga
They say you a black man I tell em I'm a nigga they don't understand that
So I'm a say what I wanna say I call myself what I wanna call myself
You know what I'm saying
So they can stay off my dick
Damn right I'm a nigga
And I don't care what you are
Cause I'm a capital N-I double-G-E-R
Black people might get mad
Cause they don't see
That they're looked upon
As a nigga just like me
I'm a nigga, not a Coloured man
Or a Black, or a Negro
Or Afro American, I'm all that
Yes I was born in America true
Does South Central
Look like America to you?
I'm a nigga, a straight up nigga
From a hard school
Whatever you are
I don't care, that is you fool
I'm loud and proud
Well endowed with the big beef
Out on the corner
I hang out like a horse thief
So you can call me dumb or crazy
Ignorant, stupid, inferior or lazy
Silly or foolish
But I'm badder and bigger
And most of all
I'm a straight up nigga

My man Lord Finesse is my motherfucking nigga

That's why I'm not bitter
Cause everybody is a nigga to a nigga!
America was stole from the Indians
Show and prove
, what was that?
A straight up nigga move
A low down shame
Yo it's straight insane
Yet they complain
When a nigga snatch
Their gold chains
What is nigga suppose to do?
Wait around for a handout
From a nigga like you?
That's why a low down nigga gets hyped
But I'm not a nigga of that type
I'm a steak and lobster eatin'
Billionaire meetin'
Cash money makin', movin' shakin'
Corporate jet glidin'
Limousine ridin'
Writin' hits, filthy rich
Straight up nigga!
That's right I'm a nigga
Now I'm a write this song
Though the radio won't play it
But I got freedom of speech
So I'm a say it
She wanna be lez he wanna be gay
Well that's your business, I'm straight
So nigga have it your way
Those who hate me I got somethin' for ya
I'm a nigga with cash; a nigga with a lawyer
Not a watermelon chitlin eatin' nigga down south
But a nigga that'll smack the taste from your mouth
A contemplating thinking 
best champagne drinkin'
Ten inch givin' extra large livin'
Mercedes benz' drivin' strivin' to survivin
All the way live n' and kickin' hi fivin'

Ease back fool cause I'm a trigger nigga
I work real hard for my livin
But I don't celebrate bullshit Thanksgiving
Sit up like some fool and eat turkey
That's the day your forefathers jerked me
Shipped us all over here in locks and chains
Split us up twisted up a nigga's brain
Now you keep me in constant sweat
But I'm a nigga that you'll never forget
A black bad iron clad always mad

"Money, Power & Women",Greatest Hits: The Evidence,1988,"""You gotta make the money first""
""Then when you get the money, you get the power""
""Then when you get the power, Then you get the woman""

The problem is you broke, You ain't got no car or job
You slow with your hustle, You dress like a slob
Ladies ain't looking for no brothers like this
They want the dub-twisting ballers with the ice on their wrist
You gotta get your cash right to get in the game
Might have to pull a pistol, Flip some caine
Get out in them streets and hustle hard in the rain
Take your come up and reinvest to the game
""You gotta make the money first""
You need a lot to go far
What you think is rich, I just spent on a car
What you think is paid, I just blew on a watch
What you think is wealthy, I just dropped on a yacht
Flip the street cash and try to pick some stocks
Kick back in your pad and watch it roll like crops
But it really ain't that easy, Or we all would be rich
One mistake, You're broke, The come up's a bitch
Make the right moves and forget about sleep
Concentrate on the paper chase, Join the elite
Few dun got mad cash and money to spend
Money to straight blow and money to lend
And only then, You made it past stage one, My friend


Now you got the money and the cash flow thick
But you really ain't nothing but a richer trick
Just because you're paid, you can still get thick
By your low life homies or skanless bitch
You gotta move it around, put it in the right hands
Maybe a judge, Make a PA your friend
Understand what really moves the world
Recognize what really moves these girls
Juice is more important than cash for real
Money you spend, But true power you feel
It ain't that easy to reach
Respect is about the hardest damn thing in the streets to get
Make your moves correct, Watch your crew
Watch your back, They watching you
Anybody round you has gotta be true
Or you never make it past stage two
Listen, when you get the real true power, You know
People will feel you, Wherever you go
And when you really max this game
You'll never have to say your name


Now you got the power, It's on, My friend
Cuz the one thing women love is powerful men
The one thing women hate are brothers that bend
They act like they like 'em, But they only pretend
They wanna be with that man in the V.I
They don't wanna stand in line
You outta your mind?
That other player's got cash, But no juice
Cuz the powerful men get to choose
From a multitude of women that be steppin in crews
Willing to do much more than before
Give you quick brains, It's insane
Just what the woman'll do just for you
Cuz if you got the power, Then they gets it too
If you rollin benz, Then they rollin too
If you livin phat, Then they ballin too
That sounds stupid to you, Not to me
They winning one move when it takes us three
Cars, Big houses, And shopping sprees
While most of us see the penitentiary",https://genius.com/Ice-t-money-power-and-women-lyrics

Bitches 2,O.G. Original Gangster,1991.0,"I once knew this brother
Who I thought was cool with me
Chilled out together
Even went to school with me
Fly nigga, my ace boon coon
Used to low ride together
Shot dice in the bathroom
Ya want trouble?
Well trouble ya found
Cause we diss ya, then issue
The critical beat down
He needed money
I would always come through
Needed a car? He could use mine too
But bust this!
Out on the street
People say he was riffin'
Callin' me a sucker
Talkin' bout how foul I'm livin'
Someone heard him
Poppin' that shit last week
Frontin' for some pussy
From some big-butt freak
Sayin' I'm his worker
I was on his dick!
Talkin' that craazy old weak assed shit
And after all of that
She still walked away
How ya gonna diss your boy
To get some play?
And when I 
stepped
 to him about it
He said, ""Who snitched?""

Yo, how did he go out?
He went out like a bitch!
So ladies
We ain't just talkin' bout you
Cause some of you niggas
Is bitches too!

""You ain't nothing but a... ""Bitch!..."" ""Nigga...""
""Some of you niggas are bitches too""
I knew this brother named Mitch
Stone player
He meet a girl, in five minutes he'd lay her
Trucked crazy jewels
Hands smothered in ice
Been to prison not once, but twice
Kept a stupid thick posse
Made of thugs and
Crooks and hoods
And vet hustlers
Who were up to no good
But they all stood behind him
And watched his back
That's the only way
To roll on the track
But yo
Mitch got rushed by feds last week
They snatchbared the trunk
Of his white 
Cornice
Took a look inside
And what did they see?
Two 
keys
, and a gallon of PCP!
Oh shit! The thought crashed
Mitch's subliminal
Three strikes, that's called
Habitual criminal
So instead of goin' under
He snitched on his whole posse
Maxed at the crib
And sipped Martini and Rossi
Sold out his whole crew
That rat named Mitch


I knew this guy
That was never that fly
Couldn't act cool
Even when he tried
When we played rough
He always cried
When he told stories, he always lied
A Black brother
Who was missin' the cool part
He had the color
But was missin' the true heart
When we would fight
He would always go down quick
So he took karate
And he still got his ass kicked
But now he's married
And he kicks his wife's ass
Says it comes from problems
That he had in the past
Doesn't like Blacks
Claims he's upper class
Joined the police, got himself a badge
Now he rolls the streets
And he's out to jack
Doggin' young brothers
Cause they usually don't fight back
Got a White partner
And he asked for that
And every night
Another head they crack
So now he's big man
But he really ain't shit!

Yo, how did he go out?
He went out like a bitch!
So ladies
We ain't just talkin' bout you
Cause a lot of these pigs
Are bitches too!

Out one night with my crew
And some new kid
I didn't know homeboy, but Evil E did
So I thought he was cool
We rode in his ride
Rag top tray on 
Daytons
Lifted side to side
We hit the party deep
Niggas was hawkin' me
You could feel the vibe
Of thick artillery
Parliament was on, some O.G. shit
I put my back to the wall
And felt my pistol grip
Al of a sudden
Niggas started trippin'
Flippin', the record started skippin'
Wildin', fools started locn up
Gats cracked
The room started smokin' up
Me and ""E"" hit the floor
And then the back door
My boys let off an automatic encore
But when we made it out to the ride
It was gone, we had to shoot it out
Side by side
Punk left us there to die in a ditch!

Yo, how did he go out?
He went out like a bitch!
So ladies
We ain't just talkin' bout you
Cause you scary-ass niggas
Is bitches too!

So if you're wonderin' why we lookin' at you funny, it's cause
(some of you niggas are bitches 2)
You always tell a brother you're gonna loan him money but you don't cause
(some of you niggas are bitches 2)
Yo, Aladdin, you know why they be frontin'? I'mma tell you why
(some of you niggas are bitches 2)
You always act like you can fight, but when it's a real fight you find out
(some of you niggas are bitches 2)
""Yo, I'mma do it Ice, I'mma do it, Ice."" No you ain't, no you ain't, cau
se

A brother think he got backup, but he really don't cause

Bunch of players listening to the seventh deadly sin
Short dawg is doing his thing with my nigga Ice-T
Don't fake the funk
I: Ice-T baby, this goes out to all you haters out there
Actin' like a brother done did somethin' wrong
Cause he got his game tight
Don't hate the player, hate the game

Don't hate the player, hate the game
Niggas, sharpen your aim
Every baller on the streets is searching fortune and fame
Some come up, some get done up, except the twist
If you out for mega cheddar, you got to go high risk

Sometimes I get illy, cock back the nine-milli
I choose not to bust, smack your punk-ass silly
Just bought a crib, it cost two-point-five milli
Swimming pool in my livin' room, I guess I'mma willy
I don't get high, so I don't split the phillies
Niggas say they gonna kill me and I say: ""Oh really?""
Hit my Kawazakie I pull off on a willy
This is straight-lace pimpin', I know you hoes feel me
I come through - make your whole club petrol
You might as well let go, I blast, make the whole cub echo
You don't really wannna test an L.A. vet though
Most of my crews' on Death Row - the real
Quick with the trigger, nice with the steel
Step into the kill zone caps get peeled
You whack, you looking for a record deal
Bow down, on second thought punk bitch kneel


Don't hate, cause my game's much tighter than yours
My girls, finer than yours, my jewels shine, brighter than yours
You look me dead in my face
Then you act like you don't see me
You wanna be me, you hate my motherfucking guts
Licking nuts - what's the deal? It's a level playing field
My game's against yours, hustling wars
Roll the dice, risk your motherfucking life
Bank rolls and low hoes, anything goes
Ridin' rolls in a week, clap a nigga who speaks
I'm suceedin', in tryin' to keep from bleedin' in the lane
Crystal Meth, F.C.C., and crack, cocaine
Got a nigga tryin' to figure out the best route
I got cops in my rear view, too, but I'll shoot
Every bitch I meet is fucking up to something
Take a nigga to the crib lay him down and start dumping
Gat pumping, they'll kill your ass for a G
Hate the game, motherfucker, don't hate me


Yo, my name will sell better than rap like the Acropolis
Suckers might as well step back, there ain't no stoppin' this
Whack magazines who tried and tried to toppen this
I still got more Lexus and gators on my shopping list
Make a fist, take your best shot, bet you drop it kid
Hit more licks than you, and never caught a bid
Make the whole world go crazy, they said about the pig
Bald-headed hoes step back; bitch, go and cop a wig
When I do a show, best believe it drop
Every night I got my straps, best believe they cocked
Some bitch talks crazy, then that bitch gets socked
If a man steps up, then he too gets dropped
Fuck the cops, I'm still folding fat knots
Catch me on the weekend, floating my yacht
Say, ""Ice, kick some game,"" and I'll teach you a lot
Knock your bitch no matter how hard your block


I don't know why a player wanna hate T
I didn't choose the game, the game chose me",https://genius.com/Ice-t-dont-hate-the-playa-lyrics
Midnight,O.G. Original Gangster,1991.0,"Midnight chillin' at A.M P.M
Coolin' drinkin' apple juice
In Evil's BM
The sound's up loud
To attract attention
Armor All-ed tires
On a lowered suspension
Nardi to steer with
Alpine deck was glowin'
Bumpin' Big Daddy
And the nigga was definitely flowin'
I was ridin' shotgun
Donald and Hen in back
Look through the tint recognized a jack
Two brothers strolled up
Talkin' 'bout ""Get out""
Donald D blazed
Shot one fool thru his fuckin' mouth
Why would they step
When they know we're strapped?
I never cruise L.A
Without a gat in my lap
The other fool shot
Caught the E in the shoulder blade
I busted through the car door
That's where the nigga laid
Hen jumped out
Dropped two nines in his forehead
Evil was bleedin' bad
The car seats were turnin' red
Looked to my left
There were two more carloads
Niggas in hats and hoods
In an attack mode
And they hadn't yet begun to fight
E hit the gas
It was one past midnight!
""Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang!""
""Take you on a walk through hell""
""South Central""
Yo, E, drive, drive, drive, man, drive, fuck it, let's get the fuck outta here, man!
We boned down Vernon
Made a right on Normandie
Left on Florence
Gettin' through the E.T.G.'s
Spun out on Vermont
Made a left on Colden
Right on Hoover
""E, where we goin'?""
He didn't even answer that
Checked the rear view
They were still out back
Where were these brothers from?
What made these brothers come?
Bang! Our back window
Was removed by a shotgun
Now Hen G was shot
Don caught a ricochet
These motherfuckers was ill
They didn't come to play
Bust a right turn, parked
And then we got left
Hid in the the bushes
Shot the gas tank to fake death
But would this really
Keep them psyched?
Three of us bleedin'
It was ten past midnight!
""Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang!""
""Midnight, time for a homicide""
""South Central""
Come on, man, y'all bleeding bad, man, you gotta keep up, man, we can't stop here!
I really didn't like
How this shit was goin' down
Wrong night, wrong time
Wrong fuckin' part of town
Ya see we was deep
In the Hoover's hood
Three niggas bleedin'
That shit don't look good!
See over there red don't go
Some places red's all they know
But not our luck
Tonight we was real fucked
Broke down an alley
And we instantly had to duck
Fuckin' police on a gang sweep
No time to deal with one time
So we had to creep
Broke through a back yard
Ran through a vacant lot
E, Hen and Don kept up
To be some niggas shot
Shit was gettin' crazy
So I had to get busy
Hen was bleedin' worse
And Evil was gettin' dizzy
Looked in a parking lot
I needed a snatch bar
Had to hot wire
So I moved on an old car
It was a bucket, but fuck it, it had to do
Started it up
And scooped my whole crew
Two blocks later
We saw fuckin' blue lights
The pigs were behind us
It was half past midnight!
""Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang!""
""Take you on a walk through hell""
""South Central""
Y'all just lay down on the floor of this car, fuck the police, man, i'mma handle this
When they pulled us over
Shit got worse
I waited till they got out
And then I hit reverse
Fucked 'em up, I seen one cop fall
Threw it in gear, yo I'm outty y'all
Don't know how
But somehow we got away
Lost the jackers, the cops
Dumped the G.T.A
Made it back to the hood
Fixed the crew up
And even though Evil's car blew up
We made it home and then I crashed out
Thinkin' bout my all-night death bout
Then somethin' woke me up
From my dark sleep
The sound of fuckin' police
When they're tryin' to creep
Broke through my door
With no goddamn warning
Looked at my watch

Power,Power,1988.0,"I'm livin' large as possible, posse unstoppable
Style topical, vividly optical
Listen, you'll see 'em sometimes I'll be 'em
Cops, critics and punks, never ever want to see me in POWER
Well, that's too bad, Apocalypse Now I'm back and I'm mad
We're comin', you're runnin' cold and cunning
Ice T on the mic, TopGunning
After your neck, checkin' respect, makin' you sweat
Rhyme Syndicate boy in effect
The rap motivator,teacher,talker,night rhyme stalker
Words thrillin', so real they're chillin', the hit author
Gettin' louder than a shot gun, you don't want none
RHYME PAYS was the name of the album
But that was number one, this is the number two
The posse grew, we're gonna break through
Power
Somebody line up the suckers who refuse to recognize the truth
Tie up the punks who refuse to understand the youth
My posse's growin' and it's gettin' larger every day
Detroit, Chi-Town, Pittsburgh, Houston, L.A
Come on, come on, come on, toys, let's play
Circle the calendar, perpetrator doomsday
ICE T fool man of my own full-grown
I cause havoc when I speak upon the microphone
I'm outspoken, no jokin', get in my face your jaw will get broken
Layin' it, sayin' it, then you're playing it
Lyrics so heavy that you might try weighin' it
Hated by many but I hate'em back
Loved by troopers who know where it's at
You might like me, might think I'm wack
But don't step to me cause the boy stays strapped
I'm taking no shorts, hatin' the courts, hatin' the judges
Punk DA's with their personal grudges
I hate the clubs that think with their butts
No hats, no jeans, no sneakers, no what?
No beepers, no gold? Yo kiss my ass
We'll wait and see who gets the last laugh
We'll have the power
Power (x3)
Power, it starts with P like pussy
She knows she's got it, she doesn't worry, does she?
Spendin' your cash, leavin' you in the trash
While your little head's thinkin', they're gone in a dash
They got it, know it, that's why they show it
The power of sex, if man could overthrow it
He'd be king in a day, no way
We get rich, hard, give it away
We're weak and as we speak, the girls are hawkin'
Sizin' me up straight out as I'm talkin'
You gotta have control if you want the gold
I don't wanna be alone like Stallone
So I keep my mind thinkin' 'bout the green
And stop dwellin' on the in-between
I got the power
Power
I'm on a mission mackin' hard as a hammer
Take my picture, I might take your camera
My posse might move, and they move fast
A fool's move could be a punk's last
Ain't no criminal although I used to be
Ain't no new jack rappin' ain't new to me
I been makin' records on wax since 1982
Now it's 1988 finally I'm coming through
That adds up to six years of makin' ok jams, but now I'm mad
Here comes the body slam
Turnin' out concerts, housin' the industry
Lovin' all the fly girls screamin' for ICE T
Rollin' with the Syndicate my unstoppable battalion
38 Solid gold my medallion
Gainin' velocity, momentum, and energy
ICE Capital T
I got the power
Power
So you say that I'm a fake, think, you really must be a fool
I been to jail more times than you have probably been in school
Shot at, shot back, hit, and seen my buddies killed
That's the foundation upon the raps of Ice-T are built
I say what I think, the system does stink
Money you walk, you short, you're writin' from the clink
Come on, what's up, you know the laws are full of bull
Prey on the lame, release those with pull
Power, I know you wanna try it
Well check out money can buy it
Control and mold the world to do your wishin'
The knowledge of power is mine, so just listen
Money controls the world and that's it
And once you got it, then you can talk shit
Power
You have the power
Power
You have the power
I got the power(fade out)",https://genius.com/Ice-t-power-lyrics
The Iceberg,The Iceberg / Freedom of Speech... Just Watch What You Say,1989.0,"Oh baby, man, this is a funky track
Man, you got it goin' on, Ice-T my nigga, man
Yeah yeah, boy, they gonna go crazy when they hear this one, boy
Album 3, man, we still in effect, man
Yo, Ice, kick some of that pimp shit out there
Throw that fly shit at 'em

I-C-E B-E-R-G
What's that spell? Iceberg, baby, can't you read?
Time to bleed, slaughter, slice
Try to say I wasn't nice as we waxed them punks like lab mice
Dice 'em up, slice 'em up, dissect
Put you in a boilin' pot and let your ass sweat
Cos I rap on game you think I'm weak in a freestyle?
Well 911 you should dial
Before my posse makes a move on your mom's crib
Think we got knives and guns? We got bombs, kid
Blow up your whole block, you hear the gunshots
Throw you in the Syndicate cellar and let your body rot
Cause I'm the coldest motherfucker that you ever heard
Call me The Ice...or just The Iceberg

Oh, baby, 
Man, you got it goin' on, man, and it's strong, baby
Kick that fly one to me about my man Evil E, aight?
Come on, kick it

Evil E was out coolin' with a freak one night
Fucked the bitch with a flashlight
Pulled it out and left the batteries in
So he could get a charge when he begin
Used his dick, the shit was tight
Bitch's titties start blinkin' like tail lights
Rolled her over to change a connection
Bitch's ugly face cold spoiled his erection
I'm the Ice rhymer, a big timer
And yes I'm a pimp and a player and a hustler and kinda
A mack and a poet, impressive I know it
Don't only rhyme for niggas 'cause I live my life co-ed
On the mic it's livin' breathin' hype
A 1989 type Dolemite
Cool motherfucker, word
Call me The Ice... or just The Iceberg

Oh my god, mercy mercy, man, you's the coldest mother fucker in the world, man
You's a pimp nigga, man, Ice, I love you man
Throw that one at me about Charlie Jamm

Charlie Jamm fucked a freak on a ski-lift
10 below, gave her the dick
It was cold and she said ""Quit!""
Charlie Jamm said ""Bullshit!""
She said ""Oh, oh, oh my god!""
Charlie's dick was frozen hard
But she said she never felt it
Maybe Charlie's dick melted
Yes, I'm the rhyme kicker, the hard liquor
Parental Guidance Sticker? Yeah, I'm the nigga
Triple-X is how I rate
I'm the one your parents hate
I'm as cold as cold can get
Under pressure never sweat
Cool motherfucker, word
Call me The Ice... or just The Iceberg

Oh man, Ice, Johnny Rivers' got this track just kickin', boy, you know what I'm sayin'? Me and that cat Randy Mack up here lovin' this, man. Kick the one about Donald D

Out with the posse on a night run
Girls on the corner, so let's have some fun
Donald asked one if she was game
Back Alley Sally was her name
She moved on the car and moved fast
On the window pressed her ass
All at once we heard a crash
Donald's dick had broke the glass
Yes, I'm the big wheeler, the girl stealer
And if we play cards don't let me be the dealer
The Ice, cool as water, hard as stone
The black mack of the microphone
Talkin' shit the way I do
Rhyme Pays, the posse grew
Did you like Power? Word
Well this is The Ice... or just The Iceberg

That's right baby this is the Iceberg, man, you got it goin' on
Oh man, Beat Master B is in here, lovin' this, you know what I'm sayin'?
Got my man  in the house, boy, I got my one and only Afrika Islam cold lampin', you know what I'm sayin'?
I don't think nobody could fuck with the Syndicate, Ice, you's a mean bad cold motherfucker, man, you my nigga, man
Yo, Ice, could you loan me some money, though, man, 'cause you be talkin' all that pimp shit, man, why don't you just go on and hit me with uh, thirty or eighty thousand, or somethin' somethin'
Give me one of them jewels off your hand, man
Come on, Ice, man, come on man, yo
You's a pimp nigga
Ha ha, yo Ice
You know I like you a lot, man

Rhyme Pays,Rhyme Pays,1987.0,"Magnificent rhymer, I'm the ill beat designer
If they ask you if I'm def, don't front and say kinda
Merciless, meticulous, so fresh it's ridiculous
I'm raised in the heart of Los A-N-G-E-L-E-S
King word connector, the vocal projector
Your girl tried to jock me, I had to reject her
Always adventurous voice some say is sensuous
Now, I'm on the mic so I think I better mention this
I don't like Gucci, Fila, Louis, or Fendi
Those are fads and I ain't trendy
But whether your name's Lucy, Terry, Laura, or Cindy
Ice got the beef and this ain't Wendy's.
Bust a move while I'm talkin'
Sucker rappers I be stalkin'
When they see me on the street with my homeboy walkin'
They slow down, turn around and ask was that Ice?
Then they see me cold countin' my cash
Rhyme pays!!

Moves must be busted, girls can't be trusted
I looked at your lady and I was disgusted
Came into the party just to rock the place
And your big zombie lookin' freak still won't get out of my face
I don't mean to diss her, but do you kiss her?
Look at her lips, she got them crazy blisters
Body that smells like the New York mets
Arm pits all nappy packed full of sweat
I hope this something that you never forget
Tie that freak outside next time you come in the set
Because my jams be crazy, packed with all fly ladies
I'm talkin' def girlies and I don't mean maybe
The way I rhyme no one will ever slay me
And I ain't lyin' rhyme do pay me !
Rhyme pays!!

I'm notorious, I'm infamous, like a snake I'm venomous
For those who may diss I think you should consider this
I can make a rhyme complicated as a puzzle
Dangerous and as violent as a pit bull in a muzzle
But this record is for radio S-T-E-R-E-O
It not to be banned or for some underground mix show
My hearts in my pen every time I begin
Sometimes my lyrics go crazy and I just can't control em my friend
I try to edit what I'm rappin' about
But I can't write polite my anger just jumps out!!
Perpetrators in the business claim their hard as hell
Talkin' that gangster shit, know'n they're soft as jell-
Oh! I better chill out before I ill out
And my negative potential just might spill out
And then this record won't be gettin played
I'll save that rap for another day
-Rhyme pays-

The front stage area goes into hysteria
As I start to rhyme and unleash my criteria
Of what is to come during the beat of the drum
And Evil agitates the records with the use of his thumb
Using his intricate moves, the record stays in the groove
My boy cuts like Jason, it's easy to prove
That Evil E is the great, his cuts are real not fake
Not emulated effects or a play back tape
So suckers witness your fate while Evil demonstrates
I'm bout to get off this mic, E., dog the break - Kick it!

Like me if ya want'a, diss me if you're gonna
But my jam will still be kickin' on your neighborhood corner
As my bass is max'n out the V.U.S. on your box
There'll be no doubt within your mind whether this MC do rock
Like granite, I planned it, So you could understand it
If someone's talkin' when I'm rhymin'
Then just say, ""Damn shut up!""
While Ice is breakin' the boy don't be fakin'
Maybe they're just jealous of the dollars I'm makin'
But you're down with me. You know god gifted me
Black kids say I'm trech, white kids say I'm nifty
Spell out my name ya go I-C-E T
But right now it's time for Evil E to hit me!

Rhyme pays, buys my food every night and day
It pays my rent my bills I guess I'm doin' ok
But when I say rhyme pays, I mean in different ways
Cause rappin' gets a lot of kids out of the streets each day
It makes me feel real nice when someone likes the Ice
Or some young MC asks me for advice
But there will always be rappers who hate Ice T
Maybe I dogged 'em in a battle or just jealousy
Inevitable situation, sucker rapper frustration
I rhyme too tough to bite, too intricate for notation
Syllables jumble, competitors crumble as they witness mic attack
And the microphone rumbles like hurricane
I maim, sometimes I go insane
Step toward my rap and I inflict the pain!
No shame Ice capital T's my name!!
Damn there I go illin' out again!!!!

The Tower,O.G. Original Gangster,1991.0,"Artist: Ice-T
Album: O.G. Original Gangster
Song: The Tower
I'm rollin' up in a big gray bus
And I'm shackled down
Myself that's who I trust
The minute I arrived
Some sucker got hit
Shanked ten times
Behind some bullshit
Word in the pen the fool was a snitch
So without hesitatin'
I made a weapon quick
If found a sharp piece of metal
Taped it to a stick
Then a bullhorn sounds
That means it's time for chow
My first prison meal
The whole feeling was foul
It wasn't quite my style
But my stomach growled
So I washed the shit down
And hit the weight pile
The brothers was swole
The attitudes was cold
Felt the tension on the yard
From the young and the old
But I'm a warrior
I got my ground to hold
So I studied the inmates
To see who had the power
The Whites? The Blacks?
Or just the gun tower!
In a blink of an eye, a riot broke out
Blacks put their backs to the wall
Cause it was north and south
A gun man shouts
And everybody had doubt
Until the bullets started fly'n
Took two men out
Then they rushed everybody
Back to their cells
Damn the pen is different than
The county jail
I'm in a one man cell
I know my life's on a scale
I wonder if that gunman is goin' to hell
This is my second day
I got a ten year stay
I learned my first lesson
In the pen you don't plaay
I saw a brother kill another
Cause he said he was gay
But that's the way it is
It been that way for years
And when his body hit the ground
I heard a couple of cheers
It kind of hurt me inside
That they were glad he died
And I ask myself
Just who had the power?
The Whites? The Blacks?
Or just the gun tower!
You see the Whites got a thing
The call White pride
The Blacks got the muscle
Mexicans got the knives
You better be wise
You wanna stay alive
Go toe to toe with a sucka
No matter wht size
A fool tried to sweat me
Act'n like he was hard
I stuck him twice in the neck
And left him dead in the yard
It was smooth how I did it
Cause nobody could see
With my jacket on my arm
And my knife on the side of me
Bam bam, it was over
Another one bites the dust
I went crazy in the pen
With nobody to trust
Bench'n ten quarters, so I'm hard to sweat
Used a tat gun, and engrved my set
They call me a lifer
Cause I'm good as dead
I live in the hole, so the floor's my bed
And I ask myself again
Who has the power
The Whites? The Blacks?
Or just the gun tower",https://genius.com/Ice-t-the-tower-lyrics
You Played Yourself,The Iceberg / Freedom of Speech... Just Watch What You Say,1989.0,"This is it, dope from the fly kid
The Ice mic is back with the high bid
Suckers you've lost, 'cause players you're not, gangstas you ain't
You're faintin', punk, if you ever heard a gunshot
Yo, the pusher, the player, the pimp gangsta, the hustler
High Roller, dead pres folder
Is cold lampin' like a black king on a throne
Evil E...turn up the microphone
So I can ill and break on the rollin' tape
Another album to make? Great
Islam turn the bass kick up a bit
Hype the snare, now I got a place to sit
And ride the track like a black mack in his 'lac
Hit the corner slow where the girls are at
And kick game the way it should be done
How you gonna drop science? You're dumb
Stupid ignorant, don't even talk to me
At school you dropped Math, Science and History
And then you get on the mic and try to act smart
Well let me tell you one thing, you got heart
To perpetrate, you're bait, so just wait
Till the press shove a mic in your face
Or you meet Boogie Down or Chuck D
Stetsasonic or the Big Daddy
And they ask you about the game you claim you got
Drop science now, why not?
You start to sweat and fret, it gets hot
How'd you get into this spot?

You played yourself...
Yo, yo, you played yourself...

I'm no authority but I know the D-E-A-L
When it comes to dealin' with the females
What you got they want, cash is what they need
Slip sucker and they'll break you with speed
But you meet a freak, you try to turn her out
Spendin' money's what I'm talkin' about
But you fool out, your pockets got blew out
And after the date, no boots, you got threw out
Mad and shook 'cause your ducats got took
Call her up, phone's off the hook
But who told you to front and flaunt your grip?
You can't buy no relationship
You played yourself...
Yo, homeboy, you played yourself...

I'm in the MC game, a lot of MC's front
And for the money they're sell out stunts
But they claim that they're rich and that they keep cash
Yo, let me straighten this out fast
Two hundred thousand records sold
And these brothers start yellin' 'bout gold?
You better double that, then double that again
And still don't get souped, my friend
You think you've made it, you're just a lucky man
Guess who controls your destiny, fans
But you diss 'em 'cause you think you're a star
That attitude is rude, you won't get far
'Cause they'll turn on you quick, you'll drop like a brick
Unemployment's where you'll sit
No friends 'cause you dissed 'em too
No money, no crew, you're through
You played yourself...
That's right, you played yourself...
You played yourself...
Yo, yo, you played yourself...

You got problems, you claim you need a break
But every dollar you get you take
Straight to the Dopeman, try to get a beam up
Your idle time is spent trying to scheme up
Another way to get money for a jumbo
When you go to sleep you count Five-O's
Lyin' and cheatin', everybody you're beatin'
Dirty clothes and you're skinny 'cause you haven't been eatin'
You ripped off all your family and your friends
Nowhere does your larceny end
And then you get an idea for a big move
An armed robbery...smooth
But everything went wrong, somebody got shot
You couldn't get away, the cops roll, you're popped
And now you're locked, yo, lampin' on Death Row
Society's fault? No
Nobody put the crack into the pipe
Nobody made you smoke off your life
You thought that you could do dope and still stay cool? Fool
You played yourself...
You played yourself...
Ain't nobody else's fault, you played yourself",https://genius.com/Ice-t-you-played-yourself-lyrics
Race War,Home Invasion,1993.0,"Yeah
Yeah
Check this out: now I'm black
But black people trip
Cause white people like me
White people like me
But don't like them
What's the fuck up
Are you my friend?
Hell no, you're a racist
You say you got one black friend, so you're in
Sorry homie, no win
Check the facts
Mexicans are still gettin pushed to the back
Puerto-Ricans gettin dissed the same
Won't speak on the Indians, shit's insane
Fuck John Wayne
I don't hate whites
I just got a death wish for muthafuckas that ain't right
You got black skin
Still you gotta show and prove, friend
Back to the facts
What about Australia?
A fuckin failure
The Aboriginal people are black
So they got jacked
You ask me about free speech and the Riots?
So what's in store?
I'm talkin bout a race war
(Get yourself together)
(Open your eyes
Get wise)

Race war
People gettin killed in the street
Blood on your feet, the ends don't meet
And who they gonna blame it on, me?
Try the media
Try the P.D
Try your TV
Try your quest for wealth
Anybody but yourself
But once the bullets start flyin
People start dyin
It's all because we're lyin
History books that teach hate
A kid has no escape
From the racist fate
And pretty soon South Africa
Will stop chillin
And start killin
Race war (8X)
Every night I pray
That people get this shit together one day
But this country ain't with it
America was founded on that racist shit
I judge the devil by his deeds
It's usually connected to the size of his greed
And keep the hope
Even though they'd love to give a nigga like me the rope
And when this shit hits
There's gonna be a lotta white kids rollin with the Africans
You can't sweat skin
Cause there'll be a lot of blacks is down with the Republicans
This shit don't have to happen
That's why a brother like me's still rappin
Just treat each other right
Either that, or you're lookin for a sure fight
Fuck the police
We already know they ain't about no fuckin peace
You wanna know what I think's in store?
Justice or a race war

Orientals were slaves too
Word to this fuckin red white and blue
People from Iran ain't never did shit to us
So why the distrust?
The system wanna keep us at each other's throats
While we're payin the tax notes
Cause bein black ain't no fuckin minority
It's the fuckin majority
So they gotta make us hate each other
Word, check the brothers
Mexicans - black
Jamaicans - black
Iranians - black
Indians - black
Hawaiians - black
Puerto-Ricans - black
Eskimos - black
South-Americans - black
Orientals - black
Yeah, that's right

Murder, intrigue, somebody must bleed
Miami Vice is small time, L.A.'s the big league
From the Rollin' '60s to the Nickerson G's

I've been dogged out by cops, shackled and socked
Paid my dues to the streets, took my hard knocks
Disrespected by snobs, damn near trampled by mobs
Persecuted by squares workin' nine to five jobs
But like a panther I prowl, like a lion I growl
Learn to see behind my back like the head of an owl
I'm the voice of the youth, the prophet of truth
What I speak is reality though some may say ruth-
-less tactics are takin' by me to awaken
People to life but I feel no fakin'
No jivin', no lyin', no frontin', no playin'
Say exactly what's up, understand what I'm sayin'
Ban me, try it, you might cause a riot
What the radio won't play, the underground will supply it
I'm an MC pirate that's loud, not quiet
Radical as they make'em, make a rule I'll defy it
Critics may say I'm wise, some may call my words lies
I've lived more in one day than they will in their lives
With most due respect the words I inject
Kick credit for realism and the truth I project
Because I could bust rhymes for fun, or cut MC's like a knife
But the topic I love is the drama of life
So don't diss me don't dare, I feel you should care

Reagan sends guns where they don't belong
The controversy is thick and the drag is strong
But no matter the lies we all know who's wrong
Homeless sleep on the city streets
Waitin' to die with nothin' to eat
While rich politicians soak their feet
In the pools at their ten million buck retreats
People hate people for color of face
No one had a choice in the race we were placed
A brother in Queens was beaten and chased
Murdered cold in the streets, a goddamn disgrace
Just because of his race, his life went to waste
And no one went to jail when the court heard the case
Justice or corruption? It's all interlaced
How can you swallow this? I can't stand the taste
Squeeze the trigger

I get paid for illin', cold makin' a killin'
My pockets keep fillin', I got dollars to the ceilin'
Got a safe in my floor, car got bullet-proof doors

I was in a contest to rock the world
First prize was a virgin young girl
For four days I was up on the mic
All sucker MC's were on the bite
Bittin' my rhymes, stealin' my style
I rocked so hard, it wasn't true
I won the virgin girl, and her MAMA too
Sex (x4)
When I'm upon the microphone
All the fly young ladies want a take me home
When the party's over, take me to their house
Throw me in the bed, know what we're talkin' about?
Then they say,"" Ice-T you are the best
I love your eyes
Your things, your chest
You put all my lovers to shame
I can't remember my boyfriend's name
You made me feel all hot and wet
The way you move I can't forget
I came, I came, I came again it felt so good I told my friends
You can have my cars, my jewels, my wealth
I love you more than I love myself
After tonight fulfilled I'll be
No hundred men could match Ice-T

Then she turn out the lights, throw back the sheets
And then our two hot bodies meet
And all at once she felt the thrill
The caress of the best, the Ice-T chill
Start with her tongue upon the back of my leg
She didn't stop till I hollered screamed and begged
Then she rolled me over, took me to the stage
Like in the nasty book where you tore out the page
Sex (x4)
I put it in their blouse
In their brain their little panties that their boyfriend saw
I put it in their mini skirt and up their thigh
Deep, deep girls, I wanna make you cry
I move it in and out, know what I'm talkin' about
Then around your neck until you show respect
Then on your cheek until I reach my peak
Then in your mouth girl, no joke, I'll take it out
Don't want to see you choke
I'll run it down your back, might cause a heart attack
I'll put it in your butt until I get enough
And then I'll take it out and put it in my pants

It's like walking barefoot over broken glass
It's like, jumping rope on a razor blade
All lightning quick, decisions are made
Lifestyle plush, females rush
This high profile personality, who earns his pay illegally
Professional liar, schoolboys admire
Young girls desire, very few live to retire
Cash flow extreme, dress code supreme, vocabulary obscene
Definition: street player, you know what I mean
The high rollers (x2)

People of the city stop fooling yourself
Crime rules the streets, who the hell else
All the police have gone out to play
Because for enough cold cash they'll look the other way
Just look at the cars as they go by
Benzes, Ferraris, trucks up high
Beepers connecting players to big-time deals
With all of this technology who needs to steal?
Just live a life of leisure every night and day
And you're living proof that crime does pay
Your life is dangerous and reckless
You eat fly guys and girls for breakfast
You're a titan of the nuclear age
Your muscles flex with a Uzi or 12 gauge
And you love the game that's why y'all boast
Because you're high priced, high speed, high post
High roller

Now when I say high rollers, I mean the best
Forget the half-steppers, eject the rest
Because these high ranked officials of our city streets
Make millions all triggered by electric beeps
They dress in diamonds and rope chains
They got the blood of Scarface runnin' through their veins
Silk shirts, leather suits
Hair always fresh, eel-skin boots
Large hearts – though their sizes vary
Bankrolls that take 2 pockets to carry
Cruising in their 500 Benz Sedan
With their systems peaked out rockin' Pusherman
Yes, their fashion's high and hard to beat
They buy their Gucci from Gucci's, not the swap meet
Eat very well, much clientele
And whatever you need, they probably sell
The high rollers

Oh yes, I'm here to tell you females also roll
Drive the same cars, sometimes wear more gold
Cold as an igloo, or hot as a flame
They'll shake ya, break ya and you won't know their name
Gangsters to the max all marks will be taxed
These girls drive Ferraris not Cadillacs
Respect is demanded most men don't understand it
Till they peep the huge bank that these girls have landed
They're junkies for fun love life on the run
And if things get hot, they will pull a gun
Prey on the lame no shame to the game
And they all seek power fuck the fame
The high rollers

Now radio stations probably won't play
This record because of the things I say
They'll say I'm glamorizing the hustling hood
And a record like this can do no good
But I'm not here to tell ya right or wrong
I don't know which side of the law you belong
Yes, the game has flash, but sometimes hurts
Behind any mistake, hard times lurks
And jail's not your only problem though it may seem
You just may die by a barrage from an M-16
But to each his own, choose the mobile phone
The tailored suit, the luxury home
You'll never get caught cause you got nerves of ice
And you're much smarter than those crooks on Miami Vice
Right?
You wanna be a high roller
You wanna be a high roller
You better watch your back if you wanna be a high roller",https://genius.com/Ice-t-high-rollers-lyrics
First Impression,O.G. Original Gangster,1991,"Upon initial contact with Ice-T's music, I had envisioned him to be an ill-mannered and psychologically unstable man with an extremely uneducated and barbaric frame of mind, whose raps displayed nothing but ridiculous jargon, shocking sexual audacity, and repulsive images of the ghetto
However, after further analysis of his music I can deduce that he is the epitome of antidisestablishmentarianism who embodies the entire spectrum of the urban experience and struggle
But to make things more plain and simple to the layman, I find Ice-T to be the dopest, flyest, O.G., pimp, hustler, gangster, player, hardcore motherfucker living today
To be honest, I'm totally and irrevocably on his dick",https://genius.com/Ice-t-first-impression-lyrics
Mind Over Matter,O.G. Original Gangster,1991.0,"It's been a long while
Since I hit you with freestyle
High tech selections
From the vaults of the Ice files
Kick back relax
And watch as I melt wax
Don't ever let a brother like me
Write a dope track
Cause once I hit it with the vocal tone
It's mine, have motherfuckers
Rushing to rewind
Cause I'll flow slow
And still twist your tongues up
Rock the house from night
Till the sun's up
Cause it really ain't
How much you say
It's what you say
I got no fucking time on the mic
To play
I write rhymes
With addition and algebra
Mental geometry
Don't even come at me
Talking that weak and
Popping that bullshit
Get out my face
A fool could get his head split
A lot of doubters
Said it couldn't be done by me
Them same suckers
Are now looking from under me
Wondering what I did
I didn't play myself kid
I respected my fans
And made the high bid
Sometimes I write my rhymes
At night and fall asleep
Wake up with new techniques
Grab the pen
And place it on some loose leaf
Nothing soft, always the tough meat
The white paper and
Blue lines excite my mind
Not allowing me to stop the rhyme
Until the whole motherfucking
Book's complete
Then I write on the
Back of the sheets
I made a promise
To my brothers in street crime
We'd get paid with the use
Of a sweet rhyme
We put our minds together
Made the tracks clever
Now we're checking
More bank than ever

Mind over matter
(So you gotta have mind power, like the fellas say)
Mind over matter
(Mind power)
I can drop rhymes in twos
And threes and fours
And still have much shit
Left for encores
Cause once my mind locks
In on a dope idea
Motherfucking ducks
Should stand clear
Cause I'm a hit the topic point blank
It's jail ya better keep your shank
Cause I got mine
And I'm out on a solo creep
(Uggga!) Your face hits the concrete
You wanna roll
With the niggas that don't play
I think you got false courage
Get out my damn way
Cause the car I'm in
Is rolling full of men
Not kids or boys, E got the Mac 10
Islam's got the Zulu Nation back up
DJ Aladdin to
Hook the fucking track up
Syndicate's making the move
With the ski masks
And I'm housing the long cash
So now you realize
You underestimated the Ice
You thought that I was OK
But now you realize I'm nice
But that's alright
Cause I knew I'd make it in the end
Those who like me now
Might not have liked me then
But I'mma keep impressing
Stressing my lesson
And keep motherfuckers guessing
Armor plate my mind
With walls and shields
As I escape from the killing fields

(I can understand)
Mind over matter
(I know what it means)
(Mind power)
Mind over matter
(Mind over matter)
Mind over matter
(Mind over matter)
Mind over matter
(Mind over matter)
Wise up
Move to the tempo of this hype groove
You know this shit is dope
So what you trying to prove
VU's max as Evil E
My nigga dogs the wax
My brain's a hand grenade--catch
I'mma hit you with an overload
Of bottomless thought
Reversing all the shit you're taught
Then throw words at you
Syl-la-ble-at-a-time
Your brain recites the rhyme
No matter what you do
The power's over you
When you sleep
You'll be saying these rhymes too
Cause the brain has the power
To control all
Think positive
You'll be unable to fall
Brain cells swell
Thought process becomes a trance
Makes you feel possessed to dance
I'll say I want a million
My mind is so deep
I'll be busting a check for it next week",https://genius.com/Ice-t-mind-over-matter-lyrics
G Style,Home Invasion,1993.0,"Artist: Ice-T
Album: Home Invasion
Song: G Style

Yeah! Right about now motherfuckers is layin for a nigga like me Ice-T
To bust some freestyle shit... but I don't do that
I just cold lounge up here at the Ammo Dump
With my nigga Alladdin, SLJ, LP and my nigga Henry G
Yeah, we do the shit like this

The card after the ace is deuce
So cut the nigga loose on the 3
That's me
The motherfuckin T
I got ride on my surfboard
Rhyme hard
But only buy the shit that I can't afford
That's everything
That's why I truck big fat rings
Cause in the motherland gold is for kings
I got backup
To jack up
Punks who try to act up
Do a world tour
Watch the big bank stack up
Motherfuckers get dropped with the quickness
I got an ill left and a right fist
Make mistakes and you'll lose
Or you might die
Cause I'm the wrong Ice for your bruise
And that's no lie
Meanwhile the penile is stacked to the top with my niggas
Mostly for squeezin triggas
I call em homies
Pigs call em crooks
So I write and put bucks on they books
I give a fuck about a cop or a G-man
They all talk shit
Their breath smellin like semen
I catch em in the alley all alone
Put em in the prone
Pop! Pop! Pop! To the dome

It's the G-style
Gangsta style

G Style, The gangsta talk
I got a teflon .9
And it eats vest
I take a motherfucker out quick
Just for talkin shit
Ride Rolls
Catch hoes like a mitt
LA, Atlanta, New York
Yo, my shit rocks
Chi-town, Miami, Detroit
I get much props
Because I roll with the hardcore G
Every street's the same street to me
I don't bullshit
I don't quit
Writin a rhyme fit
KKK pray each day
That I get hit
Motherfuckers try to flip on the Icepick
Move and slip
Close the eyes and catch a fuckin clip
Not in the ghetto no more
But I do hang
Got a black game
And it's sittin on them thangs
I kick the game from the street
Not the slamma
Tighten up my knockas with a big lead hammer


Some of the times
I write my raps with extreme speed
Some of the times
I take the pen and make pads bleed
My mind clicks to Homocide
Bullets fly
Ladies cry
A lot of people die
Some nights I can't right
Stare at the blue lines
I think I'm a go blind
Then the beat becomes me
Sit in the dark
And write a whole fuckin LP
G Style, the gangsta talk
Never near soft
Hard as a knockout bout
It's no sellout
I keep crime in my rhyme
Cause it's my thing
Packed with guns
And drugs
And lots of street slang
A-B-C-D-E-F, and LAPD
Words from a motherfuckin OG
Ammo Dump pumps the sounds that you bump in your trunk
So turn it up punk
What'cha fraid of?
What'cha made of?
Pull the pin
Set the grenade off
Blastin sounds out ya jeep
On every city street, nigga
Straight gangsta beat


Many like to dress the style, and act hardcore
Many motherfuckers are and they crack jaws
I like to lay in the cut
In a nightclub
Don't smoke bud
Drink suds
But I gets loved, mack, cool
I scope the freak with the mad backs
Hit her with the gangsta style
Cool, relaxed, bam
Put her in the Benz
Bump Too $hort, let her know
Right off the top, what's my sport
You think long
You think wrong
You got it goin on, baby doll?
But I won't sing you no love song
You either love me
Or you don't
You're either rollin tonight
Or you won't
She likes the style
Cause it don't bullshit around
Tounge in my ear, real slow
And then it went down
I gotta flip into a ill mode
Pack a clip full of hype tracks
And then unload
Music for the hardcore beatdown
No weak pop shit
Strictly underground
And if you don't like the style, as I get wreck
Ease back nigga, catch a knife through the neck",https://genius.com/Ice-t-g-style-lyrics
What Ya Wanna Do?,The Iceberg / Freedom of Speech... Just Watch What You Say,1989.0,"Party!
(Okay party people in the house)

Yo yo, in the place to be
My name is MC Ice-T
I got the Rhyme Syndicate with me
We about to tear stuff up, y'all feel good?
Yo, what the hell y'all wanna do, Syndicate, tonight, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Randy Mac in the place to be, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Nat The Cat, you're in the house tonight, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Donald-D is in the place to be, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Bronx Style Bob is in the house, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Hen-Gee is in the house, what you wanna do, homeboy? (Party!)
My man Shaquel is in the place to be, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Yo, Toddy Tee is in the house tonight, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Yo, Everlast is in the house, come on, what you wanna do? (Party!)
And MC Taste is in the place to be, what you wanna do? (Party!)
My man Divine is in the house, what you wanna do, homeboy? (Party!)
Yo yo, I'm about to kick this party up, is that alright?

Yo, Yo, MC Ice on a Syndicate Rhyme spree
You say you wanna be down, you gotta talk to me
You wanna get in? Put a sucker's head out
Sound a little hot for you, boy? Then, toy, get out
Syndicate mob ain't nothin but hardened crooks
You try to diss, your butt is on a meat hook
Want some of me? You're on a mission
Bad move, you end up missin

Let's get it straight for the '89 tip
Randy Mac is clockin a stupid grip
On the party track I'm cold lampin
But when the Syndicate rolls I be jackin
You thought I fell off, I ain't even slipped
The Mac is cuttin records and punks are gettin ripped
Gangster I am, bust the lyrics like a drive-by
You wanna sleep? Well, it's lights out, beddy-bye

Notorious Asiatic, tough, talented
A power entertainer
Catapultin above the top
Nat The Cat, too swift to be stopped
I'm like Jordan, a team player on a solo flight
Lookin down on MC's faces full of fright and fear
I slam dunk a rap through their ear to hear
Eureka! I just struck a platinum fame
In the game things'll never be the same
Because money changes everything

Once again comin at you hyper
Donald D the Syndicate Sniper
Boston Strangler, Charles Manson
No matter what killer I mention, keep dancin
Five Fingers Of Death
, 
Fists Of Fury
St. Valentine's Day Massacre on a jury
Wanna convict me for kickin black on wax
I walk the street with a battle axe

Life ain't nothin but a piece of existence
Cause when you die, you'se a past tense
So I like to live my life like a big carnival
Get drunk, act like an animal
I like the rock'n rolll, the funk, the jazz and hip-hop
Suckers get loud, I drop em
I like ( ? ) Fab Five
I'm Bronx Bob, bring the beats and I'm live

Black stallion, knockin on concrete walls
Standin tall, rappers in my face, they stall
Stutter, softer than melted butter
There's no other word, go ask your mother
Hard solid as your city sidewalk
Born in Brooklyn, can tell by the way that I walk and talk
Strollin with a slight limp
Flyer than any big city pimp

Gold, girls, cold cash
On the mic Shaquel Shabazz
Supreme, the Lord, the G-o-d
Down with the Syndicate posse
It's you we rule without a tool
Mathematics in effect, it's time to school
I'm the principal and knowledge is the key
Shaquel in the place to be

I climb a mountain top with just one rope
Get to the top of the stairs and say a rhyme that's dope
Cause I'm a cliffhanger, no, I ain't a stranger
Yo, I'm Toddy Tee, and I'm a Compton banger
Wanted by the F.B.I. for transport of
Sucker MC's across the Syndicate borders
No, they can't give me no time, cause it's my rhyme
Everlast, get funky for me one time

Everlast is in effect gettin big respect
Then I collect big checks
1's, 5's, 10's and 20's
A 100 g's and I'm pullin honeys
Left and right, day and night
You gotta see it to believe it, it's quite a sight
They're all on the tip to get a sip
Of this poetic performer that's fully equipped

Y'all played yourselves right in front of the mic
Moved your body so that the feelin was right
But if you get lost scream out and admit
That the beat's too fast, slow it down or I quit
I'm not the kind to give you a call
To stop on a rap that I lead, so I pause
I give you 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
If that ain't enough, sit down till we're done

Syndicate scorned, you act obedient
Tired of your fish rhyme ( ? ) ingredients
Black on black while styles ( ? )
( ? ) of brothers that's gotta be
Circlin cyphers into molecules
Takin over your space, that's illogical
The vocal chords on a board with 24 tracks
Get away from the break ( ? ) gotta rap

Syndicate posse growin, goin out of control
You say we're weak? This record's shippin gold
Power, strength, my posse got unity
We stick together and we're soon to be
In your town, we gonna bring the roof down
Ice-T and the syndicate underground
No sell-outs, cause it's caps we peelin
Girls we love em, and shows we steal em

Knowledge and wisdom, it's a mystery
I drop science for the ones who know it's me
You say I'm dope, cool, it makes sense
I ain't conceited, I'm just convinced
Strapped for the attack Randy Mac is rollin
The mic, the mixer, then the show is stolen
The pimp, the player, hustler ass kicker
Watch your girl, cause I stick her

Nat The Cat, my man will rap when I'm playin the back
Some think my stage presence is low, I think it's loud
Enough to see me flowin and showin
Go psycho breakin backs like 
bolo
Give me the mic, a metamorphis ignite
I break down on a cat stand, I kill ya like a hitman
And come out kickin with the ( ? )
Rockin on a rappin rampage
In control of the stage

There's a mouse in my house, so I bought a cat
The cat ran away, so now there's a rat
I'm on the attack with my baseball bat
That one rat brought many others back
All through my house I set up traps
It seem like the rats have a map
But nowadays I don't know how to act
So now I feed the rats crack

Back and I'm statin the fact
I know you're waitin for a rap
To make you get up and start to clap
For Bob, a Bronx ( ? ) Syndicate style
More bounce to the ounce and trizzy to the file
'79 the time I was inclined
To get smooth and prove that I can rock a funk rhyme
Hey yo, ice-cube chillin
Cause we got the gats and knack to see the kids top billin

Impressionalist, not a ventriloquist
Don't hang out with suckers worth less than piss
Suckers can all come kiss the tip
Of my nine when I aim I don't miss
Aim it to suckers that come around jockin
On my tip when on the radio my records be rockin
Don't come frontin askin me for a pound
If y'all ain't invited means you simply ain't down

Wake up it's time to be noticed
I'mma do this, I'm gonna show this
Beat to be mathematical
Syndicate's in the house, let's get radical
Bum rush the show and grab the mic
Syndicate's chilllin out tonight
They let me loose and now it's war
Bust the mix and let the rhymes roar

Grab a partner and hit the dancefloor
Cause I'm back to rock for you once more
I don't worry about what he said or she said
As long as what's said-said is done-done in my bed
The Juvenile Committee's on my side
And I'm kickin knowledge on a natural high
And I'm feeling strong
Yo, take this mic and get the party on

This is mortal combat, there ain't no comeback
You're tryin to get with me but you don't know where I'm at
Cause in this world there's no bombs or guns
Just a microphone, metaphors, words and puns
Sentences and phrases, no clubs or razors
No mercy for a sucker that wages
War, I'll take the floor, even the score
Grab the microphone and proceed to roar

Are y'all set, all prepared to start
Move in close cause here comes the dope part
By the way, I'm the Taste, if tracks
Could talk but they - but here go the facts
Brace yourself, you shoulda grabbed a grip
Protect your clan cause we're about to trip
Bass reflex, the kicks that drive, divide
The weak from the rest ( ? ) can't survive

Syndicate's housin all competition
We paralyze a physical powerful vision
But savage ignorants pop that's ignorant listen
Divine is ( ? ) no time for style
And I rock your grey matter with a smile
Cause I'm the rhyme thriller with dimensions of flavor
The knack - stylistic black

The reason we're bustin these raps are what?
To make all you wack MC's shut up
You're always buyin rap records jammin def beats
Then dissin rap artists out in the streets
You always say our jams are wack but yours'll be tight
But you never been near a studio in your life
You see, disrespect is your last resort
You're like Howard Cosell, you never played this sport
But you're always talkin mess bout how it should be done
And when we ask to hear your record you never made one
So this message goes to amateurs and pros alike
We're the MC's that cold be doggin the mic
You may be good but there's no one better
We rock you so cold, you need a cashmere sweater
Fight dirty in the pit when combat is on
We always attack before attacked upon

Yeah, Rhyme Syndicate, we in here
We tossin it up
I got my man Everlast in the house
Tossin it up, youknowwhatimsayin
Kid Jazz and Bango couldn't be here
But we gon' to' it up for them anyhow
Wherever you are you're a star
Rhyme Syndicate blowin up like napalm
I got my man Chilly Dee deejayin on the set
And the one and only DJ Evil-E, we in here
Yo, we outta here like last year
Rhyme Syndicate
We gotta do it like the alphabet and a-b-c ya
Yeah

Everlast
Everlast in full effect
Where's my gold record?
Where's my record?
Where's my record?

Divine Styler with Physical Poets, look out

Microphone King Donald D the notorious, yeah

This is Bronx Style Bob...

Nat The Cat, boy

Randy Mac
One in a million on your back, boy

Yo
So we bout to get outta here
Seems like the police is outside, man
(Yo Ice, man, they got King Tee, Aladdin and Islam)
What, the police, man?
I knew somethin had happened
I was wonderin why King Tee missed the party, man
Yo Randy Mac, you got some money?

Layin down the dope groove, smokin those who disapprove
Wreckin the deck, you'll regret if you cross punk
Rollin like a Mack truck, waxin those who talk junk
Dialing you in, I got your face in my crosshairs
Wanna see your dome bust sucker cause I don't care
Nuttin bout you, your crew, because you talk shit
I'm the Lethal Weapon boy, ridin the apocalypse
If you're in my way, then lay beneath the ground soon
Violence is my business fool, the microphone of doom
Mission that's to cure all punks as I bust caps
Peelin your back, my ammunition hollow-point raps
You try to run, that makes it even more fun
I just cold lamp and vamp you with the shotgun
Cops try to flex.. but guns they'll never find..
My Lethal Weapon's my mind!

A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin

You hit the deck, as rap busts from my lips
You think I'm finished - I load another clip
Look in my face, I crack an evil grin
Lyrics bring death from the microphone Mac-10
Sucker MC's, you ain't down with the Syndicate
Try to kick game, but end up talkin weak shit, yo
You're weak, you're wack, you need to quit you lil punk bitch
Go and freak your mother, go dig a damn ditch
Get out my face, I'm tired of the press too
You write about me, I write about you
You think I'm violent, but listen and you will find..
My Lethal Weapon's my mind!

A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin

Up against the wall - it's Valentine's Day
The Massacre's about due for a replay
I'm about to explode - like a hand grenade
Evil E do damage on the crossfade
{*Evil E scratches*} Cuts like a battleaxe
You try to bite, get iced, my raps are boobytraps
Claim of mine, designed by the Ice himself
You beg for mercy as you read the hand you're dealt
{*screaming ""Ah ahh ahh AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!""*}
Cause there's no let up, you walked into a set up
It's suckin you down and now you can't get up
Why because you froze the moment we met up
And I never run punk, I go head up
I ain't no fool and new jack poppin fake rap
I rap from the heart and soul, where only facts are kept
Many rappers sell-out pop and other MC's slept
I ain't in no playin mood, so nigga watch your step
Cause if you cross the boss, you go to bed quick
Know my situation boy, don't diss the Syndicate
Cause when we chose to move, you're gone
And no remains they'll find..
My Lethal Weapon's my mind!

A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin

More bodies than John Gotti, the Lethal Weapon is slaying
Just open any book, that's ammo to the brain
What really matters, is how well is your weapon trained
Some would say genius, while others would say insane
The Weapon power has been witnessed upon my page
From Martin Luther's ""dream"", to Hitler's psycho rage
What's more powerful - the brain or a twelve gauge?
The words I speak have scared many people to this stage
But promote violence, I really have to disagree
It's entertainment, like ""Terminator"" on TV
But some'll never see, you're stupid ignorant and blind
The Lethal Weapon's the mind!

A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin

The mind..
Think!
The mind..

If he got any money, take it!
If there is money there, rob the motherfuckin' joint!
As far as moms bust her in her goddamn head!
Dumb bitch, that's the reason we're going up in there!
She don't know what the fuck she's talkin' about!
Everyone get back, this is a rap jack
I'm takin' your kids' brains, you ain't gettin'em back
With a move of perfection, my dissection
Some call it lethal injection
I'm gonna fill'em with hard drums
Big drums, bitches, hoes and death, come on and get some
I'm not the nigga that you want to leave your kids alone with
Cause I got my own opening-dome kit
And once again I'm gonna put them under my fuckin' spell
They might start givin' you fuckin' hell
Start changin' the way they walk
They talk, they act, now, whose fuckin' fault is that?
The home invader...
Yo, moms you can basically just suck my dick!
This is a home invasion...
Yo, pops that shit you talkin' is noise! Word! You full of shit!
Check this out, moms, I said time bomb
And they sit in your house and remain calm
Till you feed'em lies and the flip
Start talkin' crazy shit (Fuck you!)
Might call you and pops a fool
Tell ya that's why they hate school
Been offensive and askin' questions
Give your brain indigestion
Why? Why? Because I have indoctrinated the youth
Yhey're mentally intoxicated with truth
So they know the noise you talk are lies
Pretty damn soon they'll be by (I'm outta here)
They listen to me and I give'em the real
And every night caps get peeled
And every night a ho gets smacked
A fool gets jacked
Now, whose fuckin' fault was that?
The home invaders...
Yo! Yo! Yo!
All that shit you taught me, mom, was full of shit!
Know what I'm sayin'?
How the fuck you gonna tell me to run my motherfuckin' life?
Bitch! You dont even know who the fuck you are!
You talkin' about you don't like rap, you don't like how I dress!
Yo! Fuck you and pops! I'm outta here!
Both of y'all can kiss my ass...
All cops want me, so does the F.B.I
Because my rhymes are fly
They still tryin' to stop me, shut me down, block me
Make motherfuckas boycott me
But that will never happen, it's impossible
I move straight through all obstacles
They say I'm fuckin' up the minds of little kids
But half of my fans are in college
P.M.R.C. suck my dick, please
You can kiss my ass while you're on your knees
Word! You're listening to the verbal assassinator
E's the crossfader, your factual updater
Until your cranium grows like uranium
Hard as titanium, parents, I'm blamin'em
For teachin' you lies about life, racist viewpoints
And other trite bullshit they learned back in the day
While I learned about death from an A.K
But they'll never quite understand
Bam, bam, bam, no gat is the Walkman
Boom, bash, yeah, yo, it's goin' down
Me and Ice Cube are in town
But the fuckin' pigs cancelled the concert
They're just scared of some niggers that do work
What they do? What did I do?
Just say truth motherfucka and it's comin' through
I tell you what we did: we stole your fuckin' kids
The home invader...
All right! we got the motherfuckin' kids!
We outta here! C'mon...",https://genius.com/Ice-t-home-invasion-lyrics
The Girl Tried to Kill Me,The Iceberg / Freedom of Speech... Just Watch What You Say,1989.0,"Yo! I met this girl the other night
Hype super-dope body and face, her mini-skirt tight
Talkin' 'bout legs and lips, mindblowin' hips
Had to cross my legs just to look at her tits
Said she came out lookin' for some fun
Looked me in my eyes and told me...I was the one
I said ""Why?"", she said I was fly
Grabbed me by my hand and I thought I would die
Said she wanted to take me home to make love
Now that's the kind of rap that brothers dream of
I said, ""Fast, slow, hard or soft, baby?""
She said, ""All the above""

This girl tried to kill me
She didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life

Now, I ain't no sucker on the weak tip
But let me tell you, she was on some motherfuckin' sex trip
Took me to her crib that night, leather and spikes
Broke out the rope and the dope strobe-light
And started buggin', lightin' candles all over the room
Then she did a backflip, landed on my dick
I knew that I would be dead soon

This girl tried to kill me
She didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life
This girl tried to kill me
She didn't use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me
Homeboys, watch out for this one

Yo, my pants were on, but so what?
She ripped off my shirt and tied my monkey-ass up
Faster than I could say ""No!""
It was like a rodeo, I was with a sex nut
I looked in her face...
She sweated and she grinned with delight
And then she broke out a whip, I said ""Shit!""
This girl had crazy plans for the night

This girl tried to kill me
She didn't use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me
Homeboys watch out for this one
This girl tried to kill me
She didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life

Now whips ain't all that she had
All kinda crazy shit was at this bitch's pad
I'm talking about latex suits, spike-heeled boots
Oversized vibrators so that she could get loose
I said, ""Don't...don't...don't whip me!
I'll do anything you ask!""
And then homegirl stripped, 38"" tits
Man you shoulda seen that ass

This girl tried to kill me
She didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life
This freak tried to kill me
She didn't use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me
Homeboys, watch out for this one

My dick was harder than a bulletproof vest
She started pourin' baby oil on her chest
And then she said, ""Gimme gimme gimme""
Jumped on my Jimmy, and rode me like the Wild West
I almost passed out, then the front door cold bust in
It was her fuckin' husband, six-foot ten
I knew my life would soon end

Homeboy tried to kill me
He didn't use a bomb or a gun
Homeboy tried to kill me
Yo...yo, nowhere to run
Homeboy tried to kill me
He didn't use a gun or a knife
Homeboy tried to kill me
Cause he had caught me fuckin' his wife

It’s On,Home Invasion,1993,"Yo, Ice
The organization say they can't stay in business with us any longer
What you gonna do?

We always knew we were gonna come to this point sooner or later
We have absolutely no option but to move forward
We'll have to set up our own distribution, manufacturing
Run a totally indipendent organization and operation
We still got our connections in Texas, Miami, New York, Chicago
Detroit, and soldiers on the street willing to die
I can't put any cut on the product
I just can't live like that
But from now on if any cops get in our way


Turn up the mic dog, so I can get off
Find me Charlton Heston and I might cut his head off
I'm not to be fucked with
Step in the range of my Gauge
 and get bucked quick
Niggas, hoes, I don't know who you are, my friends or foes
Smile in my face and plot to kill me behind doors
I got a new attitude, no trust
Got me in a corner all a nigga can do is bust
It may be you
There's gonna be a lot of dead before I'm through
I'm 'bout to break off niggas who play me and dis' me
Try to switch from side to side like they whip me
The damage is done
Source Magazine, you're the first one
You try to dis Chuck, Cube and me
How the fuck you pick us 3?
You punk motherfuckers ain't shit, you're just a bunch of hoes
Makin' money off the pros
And when I see I get you in my sights
I give your ass a story to write
Cause it's on
It's on

It's on motherfucker and you can't turn the shit off
Catch you in the streets and your ass'll get tossed
Bang! Bang! Bang! Cause it ain't no thang
To put in work and watch your head burst

A lot of fans ain't shit
Let me repeat
A lot of fans ain't shit
Quick to flip if our group don't hit
They don't make you nothin but a 
pop ho bitch
And I don't need ya
I love to bleed ya
All I ever wanted was a real nigga's praise
But the sad motherfuckin' fact
Is that ain't that many real motherfuckers these days
Game knows game I know too many who plays the name
And I can make it in the music or the street game
I still got hoes that'll work, still got crews that'll hit
Still roll with an extra clip
And those who think they'll stop me, doubt it
Those motherfuckers better think about it
You'd best to let me rap
Ice back on the streets?
You don't want that
Cause I break ill
And you'll really have to Body Count the cops I'll kill, it's on

It's on motherfucker and you can't turn the shit off
Catch you in the streets and your ass'll get tossed
Bang! Bang! Bang! Cause it ain't no thing
To put in work and watch your body jerk
It's on

It's on motherfucker you goddamn right
It's on, my royalty cheque, yeah, fool, I write my own
I own my own label put my own shit out
So no one tells me what the fuck to talk about
And all the suckas that said I was through
You need to wake up to my view
I'm fallen off
Ha! Ha! That's a joke!
You motherfuckers are still unknown and broke
And I'm stankin' rich
My fuckin maid lives better than you, bitch
So shut your trap
When it comes to this level of game, you don't know jack
CIA, FBI, IRS
Try those letters out for sweat
But they'll never sweat you son
Cause you're broke and you're dumb and you're no threat to no one
Them fools don't play
I gotta deal with those motherfuckers every day
They'd love to get me behind bars
They hawk a nigga like I'm Carlos Escobar
But in a way I am
Been puttin dope on the street for years and don't give a damn
So I'm thinkin about them, friend
The real motherfuckin gangstas wanna see me end
It's gonna end up in a bloodbath, no doubt
That's the only way I'm going out, it's on

It's on
It's on motherfucker and you can't turn the shit off
Catch you in the streets and your ass'll get tossed

Drama,Power,1988.0,"Cruisin' for a bruisin', I'm takin' no crap
Pipe bomb in my trunk, got a 
nine
 in my lap
I'm layin' for a sprayin', tonight there's no playin'
The posse's most strapped, tonight the crew's weighin'
Dust is burnin'
, the steering wheel's turnin'
I'm out a week, I'm already earnin'
Suckers crossed, tonight it's their loss
Payback time, boy, life's the cost
Gauges out the window, one lay cross the roof
They all die if those suckers ain't bulletproof
I'm rollin' death tollin', of course the car's stolen
But I'm blind to what's wrong, all I want is what's golden
A fool in a fight, too dumb to know right
Fuckin' blue light, read 'em their rights
Drama (x4)
I copped an alias bailed out in an hour or less
I keep a bank for that don't know about the rest
Copped another piece, hit the dark streets
Rollin' once again, fuck the damn police
Called up my boy Joe, a roof job pro, 459 on his mind car stereos
He said the spot was sleek, he cased the joint a week
3 a.m. on the dot inside we creep
Got Alpines, Fishes, JVC's
Motorola Phones, Sony Color TV's
Had the ride packed up 'til we heard ""Freeze""
Fuckin' blue lights, read 'em their rights
Drama (x4)
4 in the morning, lights in my face
That's the time, you know the place
Cuffed in the room with the two-way glass
Detects in effect cold doggin' my ass
""What's your date of birth?"" ""What's your real name?""
I stuck to my alias, I know the game
If they don't know who you are, then they don't know what you've done
""You're just makin' this harder on yourself, son""
I know this shit by heart, I'm too clever
""Have you ever been arrested before?"" Nope, never
D.A. reject all over his face
You see, no confession, no case
Then my boy started illin', talkin' and tellin'
Son of a bitch, he was a snitch
Drama (x6)
Under I went, I caught a case and half
He dropped the mallet, then the judge laughed
Now I'm in the penzo, chillin' like a real pro
I can't move 'til the man says go
A puppet of the big game, an institutional thing
I wouldn't be here if I fed my brain
Got knowledge from school books, instead of street crooks
Now all I get is penitentiary hard looks
The joint is like an oven of caged heat
You're just a number, another piece of tough meat
Killers and robbers are all you greet
Act soft you will get beat
On death row they got their own hot seat
For those who feel that they are truly elite
The last thing you see's a priest
The lights dim, your life ends

That’s How I’m Livin,Home Invasion,1993.0,"Artist: Ice-T
Album: Home Invasion
Song: That's How I'm Livin
I was born in New Jersey, I said it before
But I guess nobody heard me
My mother died young
No sisters or brothers, I was the only son
When I was twelve my pops died too
What a brother was supposed to do?
They sent me out West
To live with my aunt
I guess they though it was the best
But there was no love there
Growin' with no moms
I guess I was prepared to live in a vacuum
The bedroom, the kitchen, the hall and the bathroom
I didn't leave home much, didn't like L.A
Didn't have no friends to trust
Got bused to a school
Blacks and whites, I guess the shit was cool
But in highschool I changed
Didn't wanna bust, didn't wanna play the game
I walked to Crenshaw High, shit was fly
I hooked up with a new crew
Some brothers that seemed like they knew what the fuck to do
You might call it ""gang"" but we called it a set
And it was our own thang
The whole school was down
And one way or another everybody fucked around
Whether hardcore or not
You wore the right color or your ass got shot
That's how I'm livin'...
I did three years in and made close friends
Havin' no love my homies became my only
I was glad: the family I never had
But I grew up fast, got a girl on 10th grade pregnant
Needin' cash, I had to change my style
Switched from bangin' to hustlin'
No more goin' buckwild
Had to get a cashflow
But my hustle was weak, it was a no go
I joined the army, four years in that shit
Be all fucked you can be
Came back to the hood
My homies had done good
Had elevated their game
About 100 gees a lick, no mothafuckin' shame
Passed for the jewels
Baby sledgehammers with the tools
I speak on this with hesitation
Even though it passed the statue of limitations...
I checked the bank
Bought a porsche and gear, earn high streetrank
But as I grew my whole crew fell through
Cops had us on the books as interstate crooks
Murder robbery rape escape, the whole damn nine
You robbed a nigga blind
I had too much juice, I cut my boosters loose
I was in tread with the pimpgame
Took on the Ice name
But the pimp game moved too slow
Especially for a nigga who was hooked on quick dough
In one night late I was in a carwreck
And I was lucky to escape
Hospital for ten weeks, in bed almost dead
And when I got well, I got caught in a cross
And got locked in a jailcell
That's how I'm livin'...
They cut me loose
And I had to change troops
This time they didn't catch me
Next time they'll stretch me
Cause my time was gettin' short
All my homies was in court
Or locked in a hole, this shit was gettin' old
So I changed my life
Put down the gun and picked up the mic
It took ten years to get from there to here
But I still keep a gun, cops got me on the run
And they hate me more now
Than they ever did before
My homies came back from pen
And we all worked together
True friends but every once and while
Some punk mistakes me as a chump
And he gets in my face
Wrong mothafuckin' place
And I ain't lyin', that's how you dyin'...",https://genius.com/Ice-t-thats-how-im-livin-lyrics

Somebody Gotta Do It (Pimpin’ Ain’t Easy!!!),Rhyme Pays,1987.0,"My lifestyle's crazy, I'm luxury lazy
So much gold that jewelry don't faze me
Cordless phone, eight or nine homes
Girlies on my Jammie with an Ice-T jones
Bank account boomin', fast-lane zoomin'
Known around the world for my high post groomin'
Mac like a preacher, love like a teacher
Got a girl who lives in Paris
When I want her I beep her
Too many clothes, got a ragtop Rolls
1,000 Watt system and my speakers are Bose
I kick it like a champ, I thought you knew it
Pimpin' ain't easy but somebody gotta do it

My thumbs are tired just from countin' cash
No more room in my diamond stash
Filin' my nails is such a tirin' task
Gold knobs on my Benzo dash
Five freaks just to comb my hair
Monograms on my underwear
Bodyguards around so please don't dare
You're takin' a chance if you just stop and stare
Livin' my life is just so hard to do
Makin' deals a million one or two
Buyin' new cars for my entire crew
Matching Ferraris, E's black, mine's blue
Can't swim a lap in my pool because it's just too long
Could never go broke because my bank's too strong
No matter what I do I simply can't go wrong
And I'll make money I don't need from this damn song
But somebody's gotta do it

When I walk in a joint, punks always look at me hard
Because I wear enough gold to tie a dog in a yard
Cold maxin' in my mansion so big it's silly
Got a butler named Humphry and a maid named Milly
Mink sheets on my bed, that's what I said
Gourmet chefs in my kitchen so that I can get fed
So tired of sailin' on my boat I might
Just helicopter to my jet and catch a midnight flight
So many girls in my book, it weighs a ton
Gotta leave the damn country just to have some fun
Private suite at the track to watch the ponies run
And there ain't nothin' in the world

 Oh-oh, here we go again ""Stop lying""

 lyin' man, what you talkin' about?
 All lies ""Stop lying""
 Let's hear this one
 no man, you niggas is buggin' man
 alright go a head, go 'head
 Alright, let me tell you what's, let me tell you what's goin on, man
Let me tell you what happened to me
 go a head, go a head, go a head ""Stop lying""

The other day I spent a million on a def gold chain
It weighted thirty nine pounds, my name plate the same
I put it on, it was too heavy
So I hired me this brother to wear for me
One night, we was out chillin, he and I minus crew
I was held at gun point by a thug's .22
But when I told him that I was the L.A. player Ice-T
The brother robbed somebody else and brought the money to me
You might think I'm lyin' but man, you're wrong
As I told you before, my word is bond

 You expect me believe that? ""Stop lying""
You're the master of lying, man
 Yo, look at you with your basketball outfit on, man
 That's cause I can play
 What do you know about basketball, man?
 What I know?, yo, yo...

I played ball back in ( name ) Park
The ( name ) on the board, hit three pointers in the dark
I got a scholarship but said: ""Yo, forget it ""
Goin' straight to the Pro rank, coach, so don't sweat it
The Lakers wanted to pick me, but I said: ""Step""
Cause takin' Magic's spot, could be bad for my rep ""what""
So he sent me to Chicago, to play in front of.. you know
But then I said: ""Either he go or I go""
I gave Jordan a break, then came back to the city
You know, cause everybody missed me ""right, right, right""
You think I'm lyin?, but brother, you're wrong
As I told you before, my word is bond

Lies man, man you're crazy
Look at Donald D comin' through the door late
We're makin' a record, brother
What you're doin' so late, man
What's up, man? ""Stop lying""

My girl was pissed, so she tried to diss
The D, until I showed her my fist
I argued with her in the pouring rain
After the fightin' with her, I missed the train
It was delayed for an hour, so I fell asleep
When I woke up, I was on 14th. Street
By the time I got there, it was way too late
Came back uptown and decided to wait
Ran into her cous', and hung with him
Met Billy, Joe, Bob, Frank, Chuck and Slim
Went back to the crib to watch a VCR
And then I had to pick up my father's car
Looked around for my brother, to see where he went
And then I had to pay my mother's rent
I know y'all think I'm lyin', but listen, you're wrong
Like I told you before, my word is bond

 Lies man, you be late to the show
How you gon' make some money, man?
 Money?, You talkin' about money?
 Man, I got money, man
 You ain't got no money, man
 Yo, check this out

I got so much money that the bank couldn't hold it
Car so dope that I didn't wanna roll it
So many houses, sometimes I forget
I brought a yacht and a brand new lear jet
I flew to Paris just for good meal
Then to Rome, to sign a record deal
Off to London, to kick with the Queen ""what Queen?""
Back to LA, I bought a football teem
I just can't stop spendin' that green
My girl loves the water so I brought baby a submarine
But see, I left my house without my credit Cards
I think I left my wallet in my other car
If you could loan me ten, I'd pay you back
Yo man, you're lookin' at me crazy, what's up with that?
You think I'm lyin' but man, you're wrong
As I told you before, my word is bond

lyin' man
 yo man, I'll pay you back
Yo, you be talking about them girls you got, man
You ain't got no women, man
 That's why I went to jail, man
 What's up with your girl, man?
 alright

Monday morning, walkin' down the block
Saw this girl in a Jag, y'all, and she stopped ""aww man""
She said her father casted for the Cosby Show
And she said: ""Bob, would you like to go?""
You know, so I went with her, and we chilled
Got her drunk off the Eight Ball, and we illed
She was stupid rich, so I bought myself an island
Charged it to her Master charge, I be wildin'
So, after that I stepped and she was cryin'
She gave me mansion, yo, why should I be lyin'?
You got me frontin'?, well homeboys, you're wrong
As I told you before, my word is bond

 lies
 Why, why it gotta be all that, why it gotta be all
 look at Donald, he always be lyin' about shows
 Oh, he, he be lyin'
 yo, I ain't be lyin'
 Check him out

Yo Ice, I did a concert in the White House
And after that me and Donald Trump hung out
And then I knocked Vanity boots in a limo'
I rejected Michael Jackson's demo
Smacked Freddy Krueger and he didn't reply
Hit Mike Tyson in his eye
Sharks around me and didn't die
Drank a case of Cisco and I didn't get high
You might think I'm lyin, but listen, you're wrong
Like I told you before, my word is bond

 You high right now, man
 No, I'm not (Stop lying)
 Let, let the man with the money get it right for you
 What money, man?(Stop lying)

You think I'm lyin' but I'm tellin' the stone truth
I have been player ever since my youth
In 1st grade I was knockin' kids out cold
In 2nd grade I was truckin' the large gold
In 3rd grade I was checkin' the youth bank
4th grade puttin' Gas in Benz my tank
By the 12th I was gamblin' outrageous
I drove through Desert and broke Los Vagus
You probably think I'm lyin' but brothers, you're wrong
As I told you before, my word is bond

 lyin' man, lyin' man
 What you talking about, man?
You and that basketball stuff you talkin' about
Donald talkin' 'bout Donald Trump,' man, y'all is crazy
Shawnie Mac, what are they talkin' about, man?

 Don't believe the hype
 My Word is Bond

Comin to the jamboree to hear the poetry
And when you break north, the melody
Stick to your mind like paste, it can't be erased
Face to face I overpower like bass
To the climax, I don't carry a sax
I carry a axe to tax and wax those who rap

Born in Brooklyn, crib West Coast
MC's I toast, you that talk most
Trash, noise, can't throw, get with it
Comin from the mouth of Hen-Gee from the Syndicate
Ballers, mafia down to throw
Gangsters, convicts throwin solid blows
Start prayin, your sisters I'm layin
I'm Hen-Gee, a Spinmaster, hear what I'm sayin?
(Party on the dancefloor)
(Evil E's in the place)
(Doggin the wax)

An organization, alliance, no duplication
Rhyme Syndicate, a strong creation
The Syndicate's stronger day by day
12-gauge leave suckers brutally
Layin in a (?)
Your lines are thin, Hen-Gee came to win
Don't talk a bunch, just known to crunch
My one-two punch will put your butt out to lunch

Full-court pressure's what I'm applyin
No relyin on the next man, roar like a lion
Flexin, plexin ultra, the Bronx is my culture
Strikin hard like a vulture
Flingin, I'm slingin my hammer like Thor
No singin, bringin it raw to the core
Shogun assassin maxin in a limousine
You stick your head in, out comes the guillotine

(?) the game as I kick it
Don't miss it, get with it
Diss it, you're a knucklehead evicted
From the crowd that's proud to be the Syndicate connection
Respect mandatory, up is the direction
I stand alone, one man that's true
But you, my crew, you're on my side
We're on a ride
Power and pride is our gift
And you're down with

Always Wanted to be a Ho,The Seventh Deadly Sin,1999,"This goes out to all you ladies out there
A lot of you won't grow up to be lawyers or doctors
But you have a dream. And I think you should follow your dream
When you was just a little girl, you used to love nice things
Pretty party dresses, candy and rings
You was your Momma's little angel, Daddy's little girl
They used to fix your hair up in pretty ribbons and curls
Your sex drive was much deeper than the rest of the girls
You used to freak your boyfriends, take them 'round the world
As a teen, you didn't like school that much
Your moms drank, your daddy likes to cuddle and touch
Too much, so you hit the street looking for love
Affection and devotion, met none of the above
Met me in the club working your fake id
Looked me in the face like a slave set free
I said walk into my eyes baby, come with me
I can show you things that you dream to see
Take you off the street get you something to eat
Something nice to wear and a place to sleep
My name is Ice, I'm the nicest guy you're ever gonna meet
Tell me what you want, I'll make your life complete
She said, I always wanted to be a ho
I always wanted to be a ho
You just had to find the player that was right for you
Now you met the Ice baby, and your dreams came true
The first thing we're gonna do is buy yourself a new dress
Take some pictures, put you in the LA Express
Teach you how to walk in some high heeled shoes
Let you strut your stuff by the House of Blues
Or farther down Sunset where the tricks all cruise
""Are you my pimp?""
Oh dear God don't say that
I'm your manager, your boyfriend, you're agent, your mack
Now I'm a do my hair baby, I'll be right back
Because we gotta look good when we hits the track
Now your real name? ""Shirl""
Yeah, we gotta change that
I think I'll call you Apple, cause your ass is kinda fat
How old are you? ""16""
Well that's just right
But you're 18 if anybody asks tonight
I'm a teach you how to get this long paper right
Catch a trick, suck his dick, break his ass for life
Cause I love you, that's all you really need to know
I'm 'bout to miss my hair appointment, girl I got to go
She said, I always wanted to be a ho
I always wanted to be a ho
You just had to find the player that was right for you
Now you met the Ice baby, and your dreams came true
""Now what if I meet a trick that got long cash?""
That's when I call the crew with the black ski masks
But right now we'll only worry 'bout the basic stroll
Hooking up my Cadillac, and upping my gold
A hundred for a full hit, 50 for a hand
Throw in a blow job, they'll fuck off grands
I may even put you where the real johns at
Some call the strip club, I call the indoor track
They got lap dancers, table dancers, mad back rooms
And you can double up your profit if you take them home
""I wanna be the best""
Well this game's the test
G-string bikinis and silicone breasts
Suckas break themselves just to sniff your nest
And if you get tired, I got crystal meth
""I think I'm in love...""
Baby doll it's on
You were made for me baby, since the day you were born
You just had to find the player that was right for you
Now you met the Ice baby, and your dreams came true

Yeah baby, we gonna do a lot of beautiful things for each other
You know what I'm saying?
We gonna get me a new car
We gonna get me some better jewelry
Some nicer rags, you know what I'm saying?
We gonna help each other out, you know what I'm saying?
We gonna get me a new pad, you know?
Maybe get me a Rolex
We gonna do a lot of things for each other, it's gonna be beautiful
Me and you
I love you baby
We gonna put a whole lot of money in my pocket
That's what we gonna do. You are so cute in that dress
That's right
Damn, go on
Get your ass out there and do something right quick for a player
Yeah I love you, get your fucking ass out there
I love you, get the fuck out.. aiite..",https://genius.com/Ice-t-always-wanted-to-be-a-ho-lyrics
The Coldest Rap,The Classic Collection,UnKnown,"Some people claim that I'm born to play
'Cause I'm your Ice-T on a sunny day
I make the goers come, the leavers stay
I make the lovers kiss and the workers play
I make the runners walk, the quiet talk
I bust so viciously, I make the blind man see
I'm the ladies' cream, the virgins' wet dream
I got that kind of movement that makes the young girls fiend
I'm tired of these DJs going around
Talking about how they go down to town
'Cause I'm the best Rapper that you have found
So all you lovely ladies, let's party down
Take all your rapping records, throw them in the trash
Ice-T is the only brother that you got to blast
Hook up the stereo, turn up the watts
We're gonna rock 'til the niggas call up the cops
We rock rock y'all with no fear, and
If you don't dig it turn off your ears
We rock rock y'all and keep on, and
If you don't dig it take your damn self home
'Cause I'm a player, the best alive
I prefer fast money to a Nine-to-Five
From the womb to the tomb, I run my game
'Cause I'm cold as ice, and I show no shame


Well I'm Ice-T, I'm terribly bad
I'm here to knock out the windows and blow up the pad
I may be small but I'm willing to say
I jam this party in one hell of a way
The powers I got are hard to find
I'll be breaking women's hearts while I'm blowing their minds
They be giving me money, and buying me things
But I spend their cash and pawn their rings
If they treat me right, I'm willing to show
The coolest young brother they'll ever know
But if they do me wrong, I hate to say
I'll never teach them how to rock this way
'Cause back in the thirties when times was hard
I had a sawed-off shotgun, a marked deck of cards
A turned up collar, a turned up hat
A .38 hustle and I stole that
I walked in the party, there were women for days
And I started dancing one hell of a way
I was dancing so hard, couldn't no one compete
I turned out the party with my Ice-cold feet
'Cause I'm a player, that's all I know
On a summer day, I play in the snow
From the womb to the tomb, I run my game
'Cause I'm cold as ice, and I show no shame


We're born to play, and brought up that way
We catch the women night and day
And when I want to, I'll talk to you
And you'll become one of the chosen few
Can't you see that now I'm me?
I'm the brother known as Ice-T
And umm.. I'm the brother whose like no other
Whose black in soul but not in color
You dig the race, and a hit to the case
When you're trying to get outta my face
I'm trying to tell you I'm a brother that's nice
I'm sweet as honey, I'm cold as Ice
But if you say something to me that ain't too down
You'll be picking your booty up off the ground
You can ask your father, your sister or mother
I got a Rolls Royce in every color
I keep my rides tuned to perfection
I got a Stutz for every direction
I'm the pimp, the player, the women layer
The holy dueler, the whorehouse doer
I just play young whores, slam Cadillac doors
I'm the black Mack of the heart attack
But I don't smoke no whack, I don't cut no slack
I'm here to rock y'all, so rock rock
I'm Ice-T when I dress, I never jive
I do all my shopping on Rodeo Drive
When I leave the pad, I'm never loud
I'm just so sharp, I cut through the crowd
I got so many clothes in my wardrobe these days
When I put some in, I got to throw some away
'Cause I'm a player, some call us Macks
With private phones in our Cadillacs
From the womb to the tomb, we run our games
'Cause we're cold as ice, and we show no shame


The ladies say that I'm heaven sent
'Cause I got more money than the US mint
I ride Rag-Top Rolls with rocks on my hand
Maseratis and Mercedes Benz
I have an ocean liner, private jets
Bel-Air bookies place my bets
I own islands off the coast of France
Now I wear designer shirts and pants
When I was brought into this world
My mamma never asked if I was boy or a girl
First I rolled over to her, and gave her a kiss
She said: Your daddy don't rock me like this!
When the doctor hit me on the behind
I broke on down with a funky rhyme
The nurses said, I was awfully cute
When I played out a joint, in a three piece suit
Yo yo yo, please, please, please check it out
'Cause I'm a player, I'm always clean
I bought a Mercedes Benz when I was seventeen
From the womb to the tomb, I run my game
'Cause I'm cold as ice, and I show no shame


Then I met this madam named Angel Adams (?)
She said she liked my style
She said sit down T, let me rap to you, for just a little while
She was a gravedigger, pulled .38 triggers
She's a lady in love and sent from above
She wasn't sly, she wasn't slick
Just made that money real quick
She had a way of getting it fast
It came from dealing in cold cash
She ran her game with the utmost ease
To break a player down to his knees
I said lady, put freeze on that rap, and
Prepare yourself for a heart attack
I took her by her hand, I said come with me
We drove off in my vicious eighty three
I took her to diner, I took her to the show
I took her to the Snooty cause she begged me to go
We got to the room, (?) man after long snaps
So she shook herself and broke herself came up with a gat
She went through the door, I didn't cut no slack
I had her on the floor, on her stomach, on her back
I had her on the wall, on the hall and on her knees
I put her in the hot tub and the water started to freeze
I took her out the hot tub then I put her on the floor
She said: ""Ooh Ice-T, I can't take no more""
I put her in the bed then she looked up in the mirror
Screamed so loud, I think the East Coast could hear her
I rolled on my back, I put her on the top
She said: ""Ooh Ice-T, will this ever stop?""
I said No! The freaking has just begun
We hit fifty more positions before I got done
When we've got finished, it was no longer dark
We had rocked so hard, made the Snooty Fox bark
Then she rolled over to me, she looked me in my eye
And said these words to my surprise
She said: I tried to catch you, cause I knew I could
I came here with you, cause I thought I should
I tried to freak you, cause I thought I could
But oohh baby, you sure are good
She said: baby you're one hell of a man
Ain't no better riding than Disney Land
Now to all you ladies that think you're fly
And can out freak the average guy
Don't ever come venturing through my door
I'll have begging to stop, while you're screaming for more
Yo, please check it out
All the ladies in the house come check it out
'Cause I'm a player with jewels on every hand
So deeply in pocket I control demand
But we all know how I earn my pay
'Cause you don't wanna work, when you got to play


Brothers when you wine and dine a fox
You don't take her to McDonalds or to Jack In The Box
Don't pick her up, in a bus or a cab
She needs a black belt chauffeur and a cornice wrap
You can take her to dine at the finest spot
Or you take her to a disco that's really hot
You can take her home and while you're all alone
Don't forget to disconnect the phone
You can take her to the bed, you throw back the sheets
Rock her butt to the rhythm of the beat...",https://genius.com/Ice-t-the-coldest-rap-lyrics

Watch the mic blow
I flip scripts, and the Dump drops the Ammo
Time to get wreck with the new style
It's '93 and MC's are gettin buck wild
But I - ain't a - nigga
That's gonna get left with a big zero as a figure
I'm gonna end up with a big sum
Cause if you don't like one jam, I always got another one
Different, specifically I don't copy
Tear up the track if the flow sounds sloppy
I don't play one game
I bust about a dozen cuts on my lp's, none the same

I ain't new to this
I ain't new to this
Never been
New to this
Nigga
New to this
I ain't new to this
Fool
New to this
Fuck around and catch a left and a right fist

Boom bam, I drop fat slang
When I used to hustle, used to be down with the crack game
When I was young, I used to roll with a street gang
If you wanna squabble, muthafucka, it ain't no thang
I ain't new to this, I ain't new to this
Blow your dome, I hit quick as a pugilist
Ugh, ah, what's up? Now your eyes swoll'
Thought I went soft, cause my records went gold
(Sucker) Buster, you'se a - muthafuckin punk fool
Caught you in your eye while you reached for your tool
Now it's mine, and you're blind
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop goes the nine
Yeah. what you're dissin bout, friend?
Sayin I went out, but you ain't never been in
I got r-e-s-p-e-c-t in the industry
That's somethin that you'll never see

(Yeah-yeah)

On and on to the funk track
Back glass shakin like shit, that's where the trunk's at
That's cause my shit's - made for
Niggas that are hardcore
Brothers is quick to hook a left to your right jaw
Girls, come on, girls, come on, girls, come on
Get your clothes off and the fun on
Girls, come on, girls, come on, girls, come on
Get your clothes off and the fun on
It's time to check cash
Jump in my 4, hit the switch and lay the ass
While the Klan try to kill me
But I wrote 'riot' on my muthafuckin will, gee
So when I'm gone, it's on
Caps goin' off on the streets like popcorn
Talkin' bout sirens till the early morn'
Word is bond
But now I just cool
Bumpin' my Gang Starr tape by my pool
I ain't new to this


Check, check, I got problems with the press
Caught the punk in traffic, stabbed the sucker in his neck
(Ugh) Punk reporter tried to diss me
(Ugh) Now the muthafucka's history
(Ha) I got to make a break hardcore fat tape
Word, I don't fantasize, I don't exaggerate
Just kick correct with the 1-2 mic check
Still quick to swing, take a sucker to the deck
I'm not the nigga you should step to like a sucker
Walk up talkin shit, you best to be a good ducker
Your posse best to run from my gun
Keep my nine off safety, and E holds the other one

Fly By,O.G. Original Gangster,1991,"One, two in the place to be, I'm MC Donald D
And in the house Nat the Cat, the Syndicate Mobb boss
And standing after me, Ice-T the O.G. Gangster
Syndicate is about to jump off on a buckwild freestyle
Ice, drop some dope shit!!

Everybody step back from the mic cause I set it off
All playing the wall, it's time to sweat it off
Anybody with static, awww, please try
I'll do you like Godfather 3 and do a fly by
Time to rip and hit and strangle
I eat Guardian Angels
And toy emcees with their names on the front page
I bury in shallow graves
I don't rap with girls in my LP
I don't beg for pussy, I love the ladies and they love me right back
Now who's the mack?
Mission accomplished
I came to stomp this microphone and leave suckers unconscious
And if you think you got a 'S' in your chest
You better wear two vests
Watch your back, your front, I always hit, don't bunt
Crazy posse when I'm out on a duck hunt
Emcee Ice-T answers to no one
Load my rhymes and cock them like a shotgun
Let off like frags from a pipe bomb
A low stroll and my mic in my right palm
The cops hate me and that's right they oughta
Before my crew gets to their daughters

Ha ha ha, yo, Nat the Cat, you're next baby
Yo, why don't you get on this Mic
And jump off like suicider off the Brooklyn Bridge, baby?
Yeah, you're a player, kick it

Do you know me?
Right, that's why carry the mic
I'm not flashing my American Express
I'm playing my cards closed to my vest
My name that you say, what, I'm vesting
Listen up and listen close and listen for the lesson
Black panther resisting that situation
Executing with tact, jumping exact
Ripping up slack on the tack
86 didn't mack, turn tales and back up at stack the jack
Cause I'm venerish, Nat The Cat, unloading like the million tons of T.N.T
Yes that's me, you see, you wanna be but can't MC
Cause on the real, the science ???? behind your capacity
The simplicity that's how I say
But I said it, you know you wonder how did he say that anyway
To you it's complex, when I flex for flex flood
Stimulates the opposite sets, and that's dope
Though why you can't cope
I'm throwing you a rope, I'm about to draw you as you don't rock the boat
Or you be back inside the ocean this time it won't float
You be stuck on the bottom with other suckers I got them
Sporting to see me, woof, while I'm banking the loot
Just off the end, you travel around the world in a fly silk suit
My style is custom made suede and leather
Down to fly by in any weather

Donald D the smuggler, goin' for the juggler
Firing wild out here, police sirens
What's up? Do you wanna die by?
The Syndicate sniper tonight on a fly by
Swing while I came into the tune that grip ya
Flip ya, trip ya, rip ya, I keep dipping ya
In and out, back and forth, up and down
Me be sleeping with the heat, I can't fuck around
City sounds, I proceed with caution
Teach you that B.S.C.s another fortune
I'm here to sink your brain, I'll take the thought you think
Make you walk the plank, to watch you sink
The M.O.B needs a hitman
Well here I'm, Uncle Cocaine, floods your membrane
As the black ball swings from the chain
Learn to steal, learn to wheel and deal
When things got hot, caps got peeled
MC's, come on, step with your rhyme
What's up, put your life on the line
I shall robe them, headlock choke them
While you walk them when the Syndicte Sniper get stalk them
Red Beam on target, you can't dodge it
Wouldn't wanna be ya, ABC ya

Aww yeah man, that was MC Ice-T
Nat The Cat and Donald D, you know what I'm saying?
In your face for 1991 and did something

Been a millionare for years
Still saggin
Left pocket's stuffed with a huge ass brick
.380 in my right so it sags a little bit
More than the rest of my gear

Bust lips

And want police shot?

The next duck reporter might get hit with a blackjack

Every one of my true fans
Totally understands
A nigga like me

Pain,Rhyme Pays,1987.0,"Deuce deuce revolver
Was my problem solver
Had a def girl, really didn't
Wanna involve her
In the life of a gangster
Used to rob bankster
But now I'm locked up
I'm just a punk low rankster
Jail cells
Know me too damn well
Seems like I've built on earth
My own personal hell
No matter how high I climbed
Somehow I always fell
Guess a lot of players got
This story to tell
No matter how cold you roll
You simply cannot win
It's always fun in the beginning
But pain in the end
Pain (x4)
Organized crimer
Big trouble finder
In and out of institutions
Ever since I was a minor
But now I'm on the bricks
Deep in the mix
Crime-smart, searching hard
For some new street tricks
I think I'll join a gang
Sling a little cane
Put a beeper on my belt
And get myself a name
Fresh sneakers, silk shirts
24/7 work
Nine-to-five to survive?
You gotta be a jerk!
I clock two grand a day
Yes I was born to play
Who me? At Micky D's?
It wouldn't work, no way
I'm a big money haver
But not the last laugher
For me infamy
Makes me no autographer
Custody haunts my dreams
Nightmares of capture
Paranoid of surveillance
Phobia of cameras
My bank's bigger
But so are my fears
Past records prove players
Live limited years
But I'm unlike the rest
Known to be the best
Fast money, true wealth
My eternal quest
I hustle all night long
There ain't no gain in rest
12 gauge close range
Blood's on my chest
I looked into his face
I thought he was my friend!
My boy had me set up!
This wound would never mend
No matter who you trust
You simply cannot win
It's always fun in the beginning
But it's pain in the end
Pain (x4)
Gold rope wearer
Neighborhood terror
Can't hang around my mother
Cause she says I scare her
Got a light sunburn
From too much pool-side sittin'
Cordless phone keeps me on
Cause there ain't no quittin'
Mind's in a money mode
Seems like it should explode
Girlies on my jammie--
Got a female overload
Young street messiah
Professional liar
19, got a Benz
21, I'll retire
Crazy money it ain't funny
Suckers lovin' my jock
But there's some people at my door
That didn't even knock!
Task force boomin'
Doggin' my crib out
Can't shout!
F.B.I.'s got a gun in my mouth
Threw me on the floor
Called my girl a whore
Pulled ten G's out my mattress
And was lookin' for more
Cracked my safe with an axe
Then they laughed to the max!
When they seem my money kickin' it
In twenty-G stacks
Booked me on ten counts
With bails of different amounts
The charges stuck like glue--
Some that I couldn't pronounce!
They threw my ass the book
My life was surely took
Then they gave my girl ten years
For hangin' out with a crook
She played the game herself
Fast lane quick wealth
No respect for the law
Or the city's health
The sweat of hustler's greed
Is not reserved for men
It's always fun in the beginning
But it's pain in the end
Pain (x5)
Yeah, that ain't nothin'!
Cause when I get outta here, I'mma get right back in the money
Cause they don't know that I know what time it is, ya see
I done learned something. I did half my time, but I can learn more when I was in here
And I'mma go right back out and get paid, you understand what I'm sayin'? Cause I did half my time. Word!
I only got nine years left

Yeah, Geto Boys in the house
Yeah, Donald D's in the house
Yeah, Body count's in the house
Yeah, Zulu Nation's in the house
Yeah, Ice T's in the house, yeah

You go on and on and you don't stop
Got sticky sneakers from the blood of a shot cop
Bailed in the club, I'm leavin' tracks on the white rug
Punk tried to rif and he met double-aught slugs
I ain't the nigga to step to
Out catchin' bodies and the next one could be you
Quick on the trigger, yo, I'm a gravedigger
Chop up a body and deep six 'em in the river
A night-stalkin' psychopath
All cops hunt the black male in a ski-mask
But I'm too damn clever
Will they ever catch me? Never!
Because I operate in and out of state
Move at a quick rate
And never hesitate to take a chump sucker down
And my H-K it holds 80 rounds
So when you move be careful and don't play
And watch for the ricochet
Suicide, it's a suicide, yeah (x8)

So shut up motherfuckers as I lay the ink
When I'm in Detroit, niggas fight in mink
When I'm in Chicago, motherfuckers get buck wild
When I'm up in Oakland, niggas roll in huge pile
In Atlanta, niggas crash you doors
When I'm in Philly, it's a sold out tour
In L.A., I max out real hard
When I'm in New York, I build with the Gods
So don't try to deny me my proper juice
E cuts the records and the yellow nigga gets loose
No static, just much respect
Truck my Rolex when I cruise the projects
A fly brother that's hard to figure
I punch hoes and I smack up niggas
Cause I'm a pimp and a playa
Sometimes I bump hip-hop, the other times, Slayer
You don't like it well stay out of my fucking way
Duck from the gunshot and watch for the ricochet
""Being cool, 'cause i'm ice"" (yeah!)
""Being cool, 'cause i'm ice, without a doubt"" (yeah!)
""Being cool, 'cause i'm ice"" (yeah!)

Suicide, it's a suicide, yeah (x3)
C'mon yeah (x7)

Yo D., what's up?, suckers is popping lip
Grab the H-K and the dum-dum clip and spread out
I'm putting punk's heads out
Doors is shut, there's no chance to get out
I got the motherfuckas tied with bike locks
Raise the auto-loader and let off the buckshot
{*gunfire sound*} That's how I like to do work
{*gunfire sound*} Got guts on my T-shirt
Motherfuckers tried to play the Ice
Because I rhyme smooth and on TV act nice
Soft, that's what you shouldn't have said
Now I'm so mad I'm bustin veins in my forehead
You want to get off, come on let's rock
But have your safety off, and your shit cocked
Cause when I come to get that ass
Leave your whole fuckin' block filled with hot brass
So punk, don't make me pop my trunk
Show you my amps and my Mossberg pump
Cause when I pull it, most niggas run
Fool niggas stay and get hit by the ricochet
Suicide, it's a suicide, yeah (x8)

Niggas wanna know about me and the ""L"", though
We squashed that shit with me and him about a year ago
But there's a new rule starting tonight
Diss me on a record, see me, FIGHT!
Cause in the days, you used to battle on mics
{*gunfire sound*} Now it's '91, I'm using gauges and flashlights
Ease back and don't give me no feedback
Yo, ""Ice cool out"", yo, fuck that
I'm hot, I'm putting niggas in cots
Some get knocked out, some just get shot
Where'd I get all the juice I use
Gotta posse full of brothers with nothing to lose
Some just got out, some will never
Some beat their cases cause their lawyers were clever
I love' em all and they know that's true
So they won't blink while they doing a punk like you
Freeze motherfucker
Get on your knees, hands behind you back
Bow your heads, if you will please
I'll swing my axe, watch the bodies fall
Watch your head bounce off like volleyball
So all you motherfuckers down with the fly guy
Look me in the face, if you're strong when you walk by
And all you punk niggas talking shit
Step to the side, bow your head like a bitch
I don't play, you'll get hit by the ricochet
You'll get hit by the ricochet
You'll get hit by the ricochet

Escape from the Killing Fields,O.G. Original Gangster,1991,"Here we go, I'm movin' off death row
Ya gotta keep up hops, ya can't be slow
‘Cause their towers are high, they got the high gats
Check the perimeters good, Read the maps
It's night, they might not see us
‘Cause if they catch us out there, they'll bleed us
Shoot us, kill us, dump us in a dark ditch
Clean it up, call it a gang hit
I gotta make my move, ‘cause I'm a renegade
I recognize when mind techniques are being played
It's a plot they use to keep down another
Here comes another brainwashed brother...
""Yo man, it sounds like you're selling out to me, ‘cause I'm from the ghetto; I lived in the ghetto all my life!
We ain't supposed to leave here! We're black! We're supposed to be poor!""
Shut up! Do you know how dumb you sound?
That mentality's  what keeps my people down!
No one wants to live in an urban war
You live there cause your parents were poor
They live there because theirs were also
Get yourself together, hit the gates bro!
CHORUS
Ya gotta get out! Ya gotta get out! Why?
Ya gotta get out! Ya gotta get out! Why?
Ya gotta get out! Ya gotta get out! Why?
‘Cause the fields are where you die!
I escaped from the killing fields!
I escaped from the killing fields!
You try to keep us running and running faster
But I ain't runnin' from ya; I'm runnin' at ya!
And my posse's thick, about a mil strong
Too late to make up now, cause it's on
I'm the one that's got ya in constant fear
I'm the nigga ya shoulda killed last year
But you played yourself: you let me gain wealth
Now I can change the way the cards are dealt!
I've schooled my homeboys, made 'em all understand
The tricks and twists inflicted on the Black man
How ya make me think to be down
I gotta stay around
Down in the motherfuckin' battleground
""We got the Puerto Ricans where we want 'em, we got the Mexicans and the Blacks where we want 'em... Well, shit, they're all Black! We gotta keep 'em together, the same way we got those fuckin' Indians!""
There'll never be any good schools in the hood
There'll never be any cops that are any good!
The hospital is a great place to go to die
Real estate's cheap, let me tell ya why
The man's got a sure fire system:
A economic prison!

I Must Stand,VI - Return of the Real,1996,"Nobody ever said life was gon' be easy
But damn..

Just a kid, moms died when I was seven
Pops died, eleven, what's up with heaven?
It's hell when you're an orphan at a early age
This impressionable stage, no love breeds rage
In the heart of a child who never knew his roots
Looked up to pimps and to hustlers in the eel-skin boots
Parkin Caddies on the sidewalk, gangsta talk
Truckin diamonds and gold
Rubberbands around the bankrolls
Fly girls to make your head spin
Seemed they partied all 
night
 long
I was like, ""Put me on""
But they said, ""Little fellow, run and go play
Take your butt to school or else you'll have to be like us one day""
I didn't understand, but I tried to get a job
While all the players got the girls cause they'd hustle and rob
I was like makin 'bout 1-50 a week
And after taxes, you know what that is - lunch meat
And I know I can be better than this
I gotta get me a car, man
I gotta get a girl
I know I can do it out there, man
I'm gonna go for it, man
I gotta get some money
Word

Streets of anger, trouble and crime
I had it hard, had to sleep in my car sometime
But I never let another player see me down
I kept my front up, my gear clean
Even when checkin minor green
Brothers knew my game was true
So I hooked up with the real crew
That knew excactly what to do
Bank jobs and jewels, quick to flex with tools
Pimpin hoes on the block
Checkin cash non-stop
Crack spots, armor with interior bars
No lie, I used to own 'bout 15 cars
Every piece Fila made
Drape my women in suede
Pavet Piaget, Cesar's Palace holidays
It was on, crazy out of control
We made up the word 'ballin', that was how we rolled
But the FBI had a-whole-nother idea
It's called multiple indictments for hundreds of years
What
Daff is dead?
Carter got 25 years?
Nah..
Spike 35 to life?
Nah, don't tell me B.O.'s dead, man
I don't wanna hear that, man
I was just with him

The game is vicious, no retirement, you die young
Listen to a fake, he might tell you to grab a gun
I get phone calls from condemned row
Brothers I ran with, brothers I really know
They tell me, ""Ice you got much love in the pen
You're the one that got away, don't wanna see you in""
They tell me, ""Tell the little homies the deal
Don't let em come up in this hellish habitat of shanks and steel""
I marched two million strong in D.C
Lookin eye to eye with brothers that I used to think below me
Damn, my mind was twisted in my hustlin days
But God spared me, I got a baby son to raise
And bein black ain't easy, prejudice is real
But health and liberty is all we need for us to build
We gotta come together, unseparated
Check yourself like I did, blackman, because we're all related",https://genius.com/Ice-t-i-must-stand-lyrics
Big Gun,Tank Girl (Original Soundtrack From The United Artists Film),UnKnown,"Oooooohhhh, oooooohhhh
Oooooohhhh, oooooohhhh

It's going down, yo, the girl got a gun
Best run, because she is, quick to flip and empty out the clip
And make the men understand where she is coming from
The hardcore is connected to the base of her fate
She just breaks and brings drama to the situation
Ejaculation of her projectile, she buckwild
Better recognize that she comes, she comes correct
Collects respect, and if not, you'll catch a broken neck, buddy
Look down and your shirt is all bloody
Looks like she caught you with the bad one
For messing with the mad one
Told you about this girl before, you didn't listen to me as I talk
Now you stalked, by the hunter of the fronter
Who's size five and sexy
Quick to catch your body and another one next week
Huh, it doesn't matter cause the girl stays strapped
She said she had enough of men and now she's looking for payback (WORD!!)
And there's no way that you can fade her son
She walks softly but she carries the big gun

She walks softly but she carries the big gun
She walks softly but she carries the big gun
She walks softly but she carries the big gun
 And there's no way that you can fade her son

The most venemous feminist, homey she ain't soft
You give her trouble then she might cut your head off
Or something that you like to think's the best
She'll blow big holes in your shest (*Gun Shot*)
She said she gotta cause she says a lot of ladies won't
She said she gotta cause she says a lot of ladies don't
She said she gotta cause she says a lot of ladies can't
She said she gotta cause she knows a lot of ladies
Romance the thoughts of giving men their own medicine
Electrocute them, light them up like Con Edison
She got no fear, five rings in her ear
Holes in her nose, way out clothes
Living life to the fullest, buckshots and bullets
Triggers she'll pull it, Earth she wanna rule it
Maybe she will, cause she is quick to kill
The city lights make her dresses tight, yes she bites
You'll never know where she'll coming from
She walks softly but she carries the big gun


She got no time to trip or argue, you're through
I bet she gets you
Homeboy'll catch a stretcher like so many before
She is on the Bodycount tour, but not rock
She couldn't suck the punks and cops
You say she is nothing but a woman then you'll come up shot
You say why you wanna kill me? - and she says why not!
Pop, she got a body that'll make you cry
Pop, she got a shotty that'll make you die
Don't bring drama to her homey, cause you'll wind up flat
She'll put your ass horizontal then she'll pull your cap
She got no love, and love is something that she never had
She loved the mother but she hated the motherfucking dad
So stay the hell out of her way, cause the girl don't play, none
She walks softly but she carries the big gun

She walked softly but she carried the big gun
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
 So don't even try to play her son
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
 So don't even try to front son",https://genius.com/Ice-t-big-gun-lyrics
Mic Contract,O.G. Original Gangster,1991.0,"Brainstorm microphone napalm
This is it, words from a timebomb
Attack speed, fast as an F15
Raise the heat, light the gasoline
Overload, it might cause a blackout
Dead end
There's no chance to back out
Hit the tripwire
Duck from the gunfire
Broken glass, screechin' car tires, bodies hit the deck
As I commence to wreck
Eject another clip and drip sweat
Face of danger, increasin' anger
Point blank
I smoke another stranger
Grip the mic tight
I see the brake lights
Hit the back door
I lay down cross the floor
E's on the wheels
He makes the rubber squeal
Blood's on my gear
From caps I've peeled
About a block away I sit up
Look back
It wasn't nothin' but a
Microphone contract!
Dressed in black I stalk my prey
Parabellum in a leather attache
Low tones I speak, I speak to few
Just give me the money
And who the fuck to do
Four blocks away my aim's clean
Night scope on a silence carbine
Place my crosshairs on my vic's eye
Squeeze the trigger
Watch the brains fly
Violent? Yeah you could call me that
Insane? You're on the right track
But turn the sounds up
So I can stay amped
Do another crew and break camp
The only way I sleep is in a cold sweat
You think I'm crazy?
You ain't see shit yet
Cause I live to kill and kill for fun
The microphone it goes off
Like a handgun
It's goin' down now
Grab your girl hops
No excuses when the bodies
Begin to drop
Look in my face fool
It look like I'm play'n
Don't become another
Victim of mic slayin'
What's up?
You want your feet in some concrete?
I got some brothers
That'll do you for gold teeth
But most the time I move, I move alone
Take a bat
Break your motherfuckin' dome
Shoot you dead in the face
With a sawed off
One hundred ten degrees
Ice don't get soft
Cause I'm hard as they come
I come correct
You can't handle the vandal hit eject
If not you better get
Out my face sucka
Or else you better be
A good bullet ducker
Cause I'm a rip shop
Tell that ass drop
Five o Ice, yo fuck a damn cop!
Cause I move hard and cold
With a gangster stroll
Five thousand dollar suits
And fly gold
Rolex, you can't fit no more
Diamonds on it
Pinky ring, worth a house
If I decide to pawn it
What's up now punk?
Yo start to choke up?
You try to move on the Ice
You'll get broke up!
Midnight, time for a homicide
Showtime, somebody's gonna die
E hits the switch
And thouands of volts connect
With the weapon that's in my fist
I see a sucka in the third row
Try'n to riff
A paragraph and a half he's stiff
I start bustin' off barrages ear high
Mothers grab for their children
Tears fly
I'm like a psycho
When the microphone's on
Speakers blown, mind gone
I can't be touched
Once my lyrics begin to fly
Simple stage radiation
Could make ya die
Ya got a problem nigga?
You think your rep's bigger?
Hold your head right there
While I squeeze the trigger
Cause I'm a crazy motherfucker
That's no joke
My favorite smell is
The aroma of gunsmoke
I'm bustin' off another
Lyrical nightmare
Parents hate the Ice!
You think that I care?
Well I don't give a fuck
Cause I rhyme tough
Drop science, still bust the ill stuff
So now it's time for crime
And the rhyme is mine
Track the movement
Hide from the punchline
I rhyme with quickness
Microphone fitness
The assassinator
Stay off the shit list",https://genius.com/Ice-t-mic-contract-lyrics

33 and 1/3 revolutions per minute
This record is def because my heart is in it
Vocals laid by the Ice, tempos tight and precise
Special effects will be created by an editor's splice
The funk is in it, ya dig it, so stop that frontin'
Bust a move to my groove, work your body, do somethin'
No way in the world that you can deny my method
As my record rotates, my words get more impressive
I'm an M.C., Evil's my DJ
On Sire Records not M.C.A
C.B.S., Capitol, cause they move too slow
Now Sire/Warner Bros. (clocks all the dough)
As the record revolves money's gettin' made
A.S.C.A.P. pays me every time it's played
I chill in def leathers pure silks and suede
And the gold around my neck will never fade
Down with my Syndicate organized rhyme
Kickin' def tempos that I design
And if you can't hear 'em, that's such a crime
You better wash your dirty ears with some 409
I always rhyme elite, stay on beat
I travel in a posse when I walk the street
I loved to say my rhymes when I used to max
Now I don't speak much, I save my words for wax
I just wanna make a little point in this song
With a little nonsense we can all get along
And on and on till the break'a break of dawn
This jam will never play out because the groove's too strong
Guys grab a girl, girls grab a guy
If a guy wants a guy (please take it outside)
I wanna make ya enjoy yourself
On the mic tonight (Ice T!) Who else?
Evil's on the cuts, Henry Gee's shot gun
Islam's my producer, Bambatta's son
Bronx Style Bob's cold watchin' my back
Melle Mel's just layin' for some punks to act wack

Ya Shoulda Killed Me Last Year,O.G. Original Gangster,1991,"Before I go, I'd like to say a few things. This album was completed on January 15th 1991
By now, the war has probably started and a whole bunch of people have probably died out there in the desert over some bullshit
There's a war goin' on right now in my neighborhood, but I can't really determine which one is worse
I think the one that we are all fightin' is fucked up, and that's the war inside our brains, you know?
But, uh, I feel bad about all the brothers and sisters gettin' pulled right out of their neighborhoods, all the cities, and small towns in America that go over there and fight for that bullshit That most of them don't really have anything to do with, so I gotta send peace out to 'em
Also peace out to all my homies in jail, brothers that are dead locked up right here on earth. Talkin' about the brothers in Soledad, San Quentin, all the way up to Pelicans' Bay, Tracy, Chino, and all my homeboys out there in the east coast lockdown facilities. I'm talkin' about Clinton, Rikers, Joliet, you know every prison in the whole fuckin' world man, that's like, you know, all bullshit, you know?
They say slavery has been abolished except for the convicted felon; y'all need to think about that. That lets you know what the fuckin' Constitution is really about, you know?
A lot of my homeboys have been locked down my whole entire career, and thats some bullshit
So for them from the Rhyme Syndicate and Ice-T, I'd like to send this special shout out: Fuck the police, fuck the FBI, fuck the DEA, fuck the CIA, fuck Tipper Gore, Bush and his cripple bitch!

Yo Grip, flex on those motherfuckers one last verse

So just keep it to yourself
Not a sellout, G, My records will sell
'Cause i'm a young black woman
So you know i got clout
I'm  like a title and i'm knocking suckers out
 so tell me who's next
So step up to the pro 'cause i can't be stopped
And it's 187 on a undercover cop
And when it comes to my rhymes i never play games
I write what i fell, fuck the fortune and fame
'Cause i'm a strong black woman, my name is Grip
 my rhymes will make you trip
And when it's all over, you'll be shouting ""Grip!""

Yeah, in your face 1993, Grip's in the motherfucking house, fool
All female MCs beware
Wait for the LP comin' out this year

I’m Your Pusher/Pusherman,Hip-Hop History: The Collection,UnKnown,"Yo, it's time for me to pump the volume
No problem, the record's revolvin'
Evil's the mixer, I'm the rap trixister
Paparazzi on the bum rush for pictures
Ice, coolin', yo colder than ever
Punk executioner E pull the lever
Rotate the wax tehn cut an'axe the tracks
Push up the levels till the red lights max
Don't try to size up, you better wise up
To the rap criminals, we're succeeded
Dope beats and lyrics, no beepers needed
For this drug deal, I'm the big wheel
The dope I'm sellin', you don't smoke, you feel
Out on the dance floor, on my world tour
I'm sellin' dope in each and every record store
I'm the king pin when the wax spins
Crack or smack will take you to a sure end
You don't need it, just throw that stuff away
You wanna get high? Let the record play
Mc Ice t
I'm your pusher
I know you're lovin' this drugs as it's comin' out your speaker
Bass thru the bottons, highs thru the tweeters
But this base you don't need a pipe
Just a tempo to keep your hype
Groovin' like I see you doin'
Some stupid crack would just ruin
Your natural high, why?.that ain't fly
And anyone who says it is, lies
Move like I knew you would, like I knew could
And if you ain't cracked out, then I know you should
Be able to give me a clap, to match exact with the track
And since I know that you ain't, I expect that
Oh now this jam is lit, it's like the ultimate
People high off dope but still physically fit
I'll make a million bucks, pack my dough in trucks
From sellin' dope beats, dope rhymes, dope cuts
I'll be the biggest dope dealer in history
Because all the fly will be high off that Ice-T
I'm your pusher
I'm bring it to boil, Evil E rock it up
You want it?.I don't think you got enough
Last suckers crossed, Syndicate shot'em up
Cops found'em in the lake bottom up
I don't play when it comes to my dope
I check my lyrics close, like with a microscope
I don't clean'em up with no ivory soap
I leave'em hard and pure, hope that you can cope
Because you might O.D. if you overdrive
This record, tape or CD, because the sound I've
Created on this wax is like a chemical
And the knowledge I give, makes me invincible
I'm your pusher
The cops don't know what to do, because my dope breaks thru
No matter what they do, my stuff gets to you
Kickin' on the Boulevard, my tempo's hyped and hard
I don't ask, the ICE just bogards
Sire Records puts me out, with Warner Bros. clout
My dope hits the streets with no doubt
Evil E adds the cut, then removes it
IZ checks for purity, then approves it
And then you get it, try it, and like it
And if it ain't potent, we remix and spike it
To bring you the pure dope, not a noose in a rope
Because if you're doin' crack, you're on death row
You're just a toy punk, to mess with that junk
You want some real dope, come look in my trunk
The dope I'm sellin' is life, 100% legit
So get real fool, and try some real hit

The I, the C, the E, the T
I'll never get a Grammy, so fuck the G
All I need is crowd, and my M-I-C
Got a gangster ass DJ named Evil E
My record label's called Warner B
William Morris is my agency
I'll never go broke, I got property
Got a dope pitbull named Felony
Got four gold albums
So what you tell'n me?
Power was two, Iceberg was three
This one here shipped five hundred G
Now when I roll, I roll stupid deep
Benzes, Beemers, and boomin' Jeeps
I'm always strapped
Cause my money I keep
You move on the Ice
And you're goin' to sleep
But when you see me
Walkin' down the street
You say, ""What's up Ice?""
And I say, ""Peace!""
You give me a dap, I give you one back
Cause I ain't souped
So forget about that

Sign an autograph
Kick a little flavor
Have some fun and laugh

You might cause a riot
What the radio won't play, the underground will supply it
I'm a MC pirate, this loud not quiet
Radical as they make, they make a rule I'll defy it
Critics may say I'm wise, some may call my words lies
I've lived more in one day than they will in their lives
Cops hate kids and kids hate cops
Cops kill kids with warning shots
What is crime and what is not?
What is justice? I think I forgot

Gotta Lotta Love,Home Invasion,1993.0,"Woke up the other mornin, I heard a rumor
They said the gang wars was over
I told em they was bullshittin, they said it's real as hell
Can't explain the way I felt
Too many years I seen my brothers die
And I can't say that shit was really that fly
But I used to gangbang when I was younger
So it's really hard to tell a kid that he's goin under
I never thought I lived to see us chill
Crips and Bloods holdin hands, the shit is ill
But I love it, I can't help it
Too much death on the streets, and we dealt it
Van Ness Boys, The Hoovers, The 60s
Bounty Hunters, 8-Treys, all coolin out, gee
I pray the shit'll never stop
You used to see the wrong colors, and the gats went pop-pop
But now the kids got a chance to live
And the O.G.'s got something to give
That's love, black on black, that's how they made it
And if any busters flip, they get faded
L.A. is where I'm speakin of
Peace to all the gangsters, cause I got a lotta love

I got a lotta love, cause you're all my brothers
Red or blue, black's the color
We got a chance, so we can really sweat the real fools
Show those muthafuckas the real tools
Check the enemy, it ain't the family
Not 1-11, try L.A.P.D
They gotta understand, they beat on a blackman
There's gonna be drama, know what I'm sayin?
And if we flip, let's all flip together
Cause I'm prepared, kid, for rough weather
And we gotta realize, the boys on the east side
You call em Eses, I call em allies
Because the day that we all unite
Watch the pigs get real polite
Punk muthafuckas gotta learn quick
That we ain't takin no more shit
L.A. is where I'm speakin of
Peace to all the gangsters, cause I got a lotta love

Crenshaw Boulevard, Sunday afternoon
Folks sittin on things, mad systems boom
The girls are lookin better
The gang truce is on, so you wear whatever
At Venice by the ocean
Rag-top Trey hits the three-wheel motion
There's gangsters all around
Still crazy sets, but you just don't clown
I pray L.A. can stay this way
It's the first summer I can really say
I felt cool, we all chilled
Went to the park, and nobody got killed
Now if you got a problem, it's man on man
You don't need a gang to solve em
I seen the greatest thing I seen in my life
Two brothers in a straight up fist fight
Nobody pulled a gat, nobody jumped in
Nobody pulled a knife, nobody got done in
L.A. is where I'm speakin of
Peace to my city, cause I got a lotta love

G-a-t-e-s, I hope you wear a vest
Even after you're out the fuckin office
Cause we're on a totally different tip
Fuck that pig brutality shit
This unity is gettin to me
Every brother on the street is my homie
I'm rollin through a hood that I never been
And every brother steps to me as a friend
I love it, I love it
And nothin in my life will ever be above it
We wanna see our kids all grown up
We're tired of seein our hoods get blown up
L.A. is a great place
Fly girls, dope cars, life at a fast pace
But gangbanging was killin it quick
Another child got hit - bullshit
Pop-pop-pop, 10 on a weekend
We was goin off to deep end
But now we got a chance, my friend
To mend, and make the colors blend
Let's all go out on a picnic, kick shit
And squash all the static
Last year I lost about five homies
This shit is real to me
L.A. is where I'm speakin of
Peace to all the gangsters, cause I got a lotta love
Yo
This is goin out to all the gangbangers
All over South Central

Pulse of the Rhyme,O.G. Original Gangster,1991,"Just checkin' my microphone once
As I check your audio
Increase the bass response
Hopin' the speakers blow
I got no time to sit and flip and pop bullshit
Turn up your stereo hops, insert the rhyme clip
Close your windows up, make sure it's air tight
E.Q. the track exact, so shit sounds right
I rhyme of death and darkness and danger
Your crib or car becomes a torture chamber
I write my rhymes with violence, what you expect?
Sounds of pain, the snap of a broken neck
All alone in darkness I sit each night
Write my rhymes with blood upon a butcher knife
You say the Ice is ill, and ill I am
They try to ban my shit and I don't give a damn
Roll up, your eye will get swoll up
Suckers who flexed, yo, their deaths got tolled up
Cause I'm not the nigga to toy with, boy with the big mouth
Ya got time to riff? There's time to take you out
Put a couple caps in your ass, cut your head off
Send it to your mom with flowers 'cause I'm so soft
Lay on your wack crew, smoke the whole bunch
Bury 'em in my backyard and then I'll eat lunch
Cause I don't give a fuck about you or him or her
Whenever I'm in the house a death just might occur
Is this real or fiction, You'll never know
CHORUS
While you're locked to the pulse of the rhyme flow!
Once I lock you up, you can't get loose
You put your head inside
And I placed the noose
The mic drips juice slow
From its steel mesh
My words feel like hooks
Underneath your flesh
Makin' you twist and turn
Scorch and burn, when will you learn?
The '90s are my turn
To pitch a vocal fit, like the ultimate
Gangster rhyme, yo, I invented the shit!
Watch me do it, as I do it
And I do it right
Grab the gauge
Duct tape on the flashlight
Don the black ski mask
And come to your house
Cut off your power
And do you with the lights out!
Is this real or fiction?
You'll never know
CHORUS
A pool of blood
And floating body parts
Would make me grin
A close view of a razor
When it's breaking skin
If you were burnin'
I'd use gasoline to put you out
Cause I walk alone
And choose the dark route
Nightmares gotta be loved by some
And I'm the one
Ya wanna come, bring your shotgun
You ever see your partner die?
No? Well I have!
You ever see your father die?
No? Well I have!
You ever see your mother die?
No? Well I have!
So shut the fuck up, punk
And clear the rhyme path!
What would make me feel calm and nice
Is a slow slice
Through your jugular and windpipe
Throw me in jail
I won't even try to make bail
Put me in the gas chamber
And watch me inhale!
Is this true or false?
Well you'll never know
CHORUS
Jason, Tales from the Crypt
And the Dark Side
Another fly murder, another suicide
Did these flicks
Have an influence on my brain?
I really doubt that shit
I think that I was born insane
When I was young
I had a lust for knives and guns
Use a magnifying glass
To fry an ant with the sun
And on and on
My lust for death got bigger
At fifteen
I was placed behind a trigger
Although I'm dirty
Not the one to be swept up
Step up, I'd love to open your chest up
I've got no concept of life or death
All I want is your last breath
Give me a motherfuckin' break
I should behave
Give me a motherfuckin' shovel
I'll dig graves!
I break ill in extra large portions
Where's your parents
I'll make you an orphan
So when you're talkin' crazy
You better think of me
The I, to the C, to the E, to the fuckin' T!
There'll be no tears
No screams or cries, just a laser beam
Between your fuckin' eyes
You feel strange well now you know

Iceberg, Gangsta Rap album, 2006, bitch!!
SMG in full effect, keeping it real gutter for you niggas
But all the gangsters out there ain't got a girl
This really especial to them, that's right!
I think it's to keep it real
And sing something to the ladies, sing something to my girl

I love the way you move your tongue
Your sexy moves got me sprung
The way you lay me back in the bed
She loves it when she is giving me head
You make my body hot and cold
Your fat ass corrupts my soul
You get my dick hard as a rock
She gets on top and just don't stop
Five stilettos on your feet
Your pussy lips taste so sweet
So sexy walking down the street
Ain't got no problem carry a heat
You're just so goddamn fly
You're so bad that niggas don't try
I love the way you moan and cry
She is down with me, ride or die

If you got a bad bitch and you know it
Keep it real my niggas, anytime the week ends to show it
Throw your hands up, if you feel the girl that you with
Fuck your homies, she is the one sucking your dick

I Love the way you lick your lips
The sexy way you move your hips
The vision of your big round tits
She scents the average nigga in fist
You make me want it all night long
You make me wanna sing this song
You make feel so hard and strong
She loves it when I rip her pro-tong
I love the way you stroke my dick
I love it when you start to lick
Your booty is so round and thick
She makes cum so damn quick
How she getting into those Jeans
That finest shape I have ever seen
I'm starring at you like a fiend
She makes me wanna yell and scream


You're skin is so soft and smooth
I love it when you fill in your groove
They sexy way your body moves
She ain't got nothing to prove
You know how to bring the heat
No other chick can compete
A brother don't need to cheat
She sicks me dry and leaves me weak",https://genius.com/Ice-t-my-baby-lyrics
Lifestyles of the Rich and Infamous,O.G. Original Gangster,1991.0,"It's eight a.m. I roll out my silk sheets
Get fly crash the limo back seats
Lookin' in the faces of some ladies that I never met
On the interview tip, no sweat
They ask me questions, I throw the words back
They say they write facts, I know that's bull crap
They're kickin' drama but then drama's my middle name
That's the price ya pay for big fame
The cellular phone rings
Don't wanta pick it up
But it's my J-O-B I gotta kick it up
Another damn reporter
On the line with a word quiz
I gotta show cause I'm livin' in showbiz
Out the limo, to the plane, in the pourin' rain
I hate flyin' but there's no time for slow trains
Another show to do, I gotta catch my crew
They left last night in the bus around two
The plane's a small one
No fun at all
Bouncin' round the air like a tennis ball
When it touches down i wanna kiss the ground
But it's time to wreck a new town
Get to the arena, meet up with the crew
They tell me all the speakers blew
The cordless don't work
Sound man's a jerk
Somebody's gonna get hurt
I'm crazy mad but my fans want autographs
I turn my angry frowns into fake laughs
I can't be rude 'cause they wouldn't understand
I ain't human no more, I'm a superman
CHORUS
You can try
But you'll never understand this
You can try
But you'll never understand this
You can try
But you'll never understand this
The lifestyles of the rich and infamous
Four hours 'til show time oh well
I might as well check in the hotel
Get a little rest before it's time for us to play
Ten brothers standin' in the hallway
All with demo tapes, they need the hook up
They heard that I was the one to look up
I can't ditch 'em
Cause they already saw me
I'll put my head down
Maybe they'll ignore me
No chance ""Ice what's goin' on?""
I listened to twenty-five songs
And after that the brothers still wouldn't leave
They started lookin' at my T.V
I was gonna break down if they didn't jet soon
Snuck across the hall and crashed in E's room
But then this freak came in, thought I was E
Straddled her legs across me
Ripped off her blouse
Pushed her breast against my face
Started gyrating her waist
Sounds fly, like a hype sex thriller?
But see, she looked like Godzilla
Pushed her off me, homegirl hit the floor
This is what it's like on tour
I hit the hallway it was crawlin' thick
""Could weez take ya picture real quick?""
Jumped into a pose that I used a million times before
Took pictures with the whole damn floor
I couldn't say no, not to my fans
You see, they wouldn't understand
CHORUS
Now it's show time, ""time to flow"" time
""Evil lost the records but we still gotta go"" time
The house is packed, everybody's on their feet
So I say, ""Throw on Rakim's beat.""
E hits the fader and the crowd is lit
I start bustin' off some new shit
The stage is so smokey that I almost fall off
I start inhalin' it, I'm tryin' not to cough
I'm catchin' problems from every angle
The mic cords are tangled
I try to flow smooth but my words are mangled
Damn near slipped and broke my ankle
If that ain't enough the police are hawkin'
Listenin' real close to the words I'm talkin'
They wanna put a brother like me in the back seat
Just because I curse the beat
They wanna tap my phone, wanna keep my crib bugged
Call all my homies felons and street thugs
You might say i think this lifestyle sucks?
I wouldn't trade it for a million bucks
Although it's all not glamour and gleam
It's still my dream

We heard some niggas ran in on you man
Yeah yeah, shit was fucked up man, it was real fucked up
Don't worry - We know who did it
What're you talkin about man?
The shit just happened about 3 hours ago
Yeah - but we know who did it man... it was your boy
What? Naugh man I'm not trying to hear that
Yo listen man, it was your boy man - He talks a lot
I can't believe this shit man, I grew up with this nigga man
This motherfucker, I would've died for this nigga man
And this nigga set me up?
You're now fucking with your last nigga
Quick to blast nigga
Gauge Masturbator
Chest Plate disintegrator, rider
I never wore no mask, wacked the witness - vestless
I'll put you on the graveyard's guest list
ICE - cause I lack all emotions, I'm heartless
That's why I can't figure for the life of me
You'd want to start this
My crew is bottomless
Street Lobotomists
Gun slingers
Glock cocked and diamond ringers
Hustlers
My nigga got shot but still alive
He took a full clip from another player's 25
And he said he's rolling with me, if you're coming
I told him, stay home, rest up, I got enough gunning
Homiciders
Ballin' rag Rolls riders
Blood letters
Money getters
Life betters
The last thing I heard you say you said I was a dead man, bitch
I'll put you right into gun point, you snitch
Now I know your plans are rolling on me, late when I sleep
Why don't we do this man to man? Let them bitch niggas creep
I still remember in the days when we was friends chillin
Now it seems you going to have to be my next killin
Chorus x2:
You wanna go to war, nigga tell me why?
Punk niggas talk shit, bitch niggas die
I never backed down and it ain't no time to start
Let's take it to the streets and I'm a check your heart
You must be death wishing, what's up? You know my steelo
Got love with the illest of blacks and amigos
Your jealousy is outta hand, I can't fuck wit'cha
And all your so-called down niggas, say good luck to ya
They know you're off the hook and you're soon to bleed
My reputation states that I kills with speed
More drama than a rap verse
You'll feel the mack first
In your back first
Then the black hearse
Goddamn, I can't understand the drama why?
To tell the fucking truth I thought your crew was fly
Now you're talking that shit like a bitch on the rag
Don't give a fuck about your set or the pants you sag
I drop a hot one in your forehead, neck and mouth
Then rush a hospital and bank ya if you don't check out
Cause I'm a mad nigga once, a crazy nigga twice
A cold blooded motherfucker, that's why they call me ICE
And if you told me this would happen
I would said never - no, we down forever - we flipped keys together
Now the street talkers say you want my spot
A lotta niggas did, A lotta niggas shot
Chorus
It's obvious some sucka niggas got ya gassed
Let's see if they around you when the gunshots blast
It ain't nothing nice, letting off slugs under the street life
Early deaths, dry gags and last breaths
I seen your time before you want - war till it's on
How to fuck with the king, when you're a bullshit pawn?
I can't comprehend your stupidity, miscalculation
Word to obstetricians show your crews anhiliation
Predicted, Brains get evicted, Fuckin with me kid
Bullets lift your lid
And watch your weak kool aid heart run down the drain
I got the Method Man who came to bring the pain
Let you know quick, niggas suck dick if you trip
Used to be my homie, now you just a punk ho bitch
Frustration leads to aggravation and dismay
Now you're player haten, but that's the wrong game to play
I light your block up, kidnap your moms - snatch your woman
You beg for me to stop, but I'll just keep coming
You're fucking with the illest fool in Southern California
I can roll with ya, or motherfuckin' on ya

Peel Their Caps Back,The Iceberg / Freedom of Speech... Just Watch What You Say,1989.0,"Coolin in my crib, cold video dubbin
FBI warning? Huh, don't mean nuttin
They call that shit a crime? Yo that shit's a joke
Hit record on my dope remote
I heard my phone ringin, I wonder who could it be
It was the E, the V, yes the I-L E
He said, ""We got static - word, I just got out
Punks tried to move at the club and we shot out
Bullets everywhere,"" Okay what's the prob?
""Ink got popped, he's dead as a doorknob.""
You bullshittin! ""I ain't fuckin around
The posse's rollin tonight, nigga are you down?""
I grabbed my AK, my 16, and my baby Mac
Strapped on my vest, and threw the 9 in the small of my back
I said - Chill, don't let nobody move without me
Say you know where they are?
He said, ""I know where they be""
Let's peel their caps back
Let's peel their caps back
Twelve o'clock midnight, posse was airtight
Twenty-five cars, under the streetlights
Some people talked, while others cried
Ink was a brother, who shouldn't have died
Then the silence broke, Ice what's it gonna be?
38 hard brothers stood and stared at me
There were only two words that I had to say
P-A-Y, B-A-C-K
The car's loaded with a silence that could wake the dead
Pistols clipped as the chambers loaded full of lead
Everyone in the crew knew what I said
Would mean by morning, somebody else soon would be dead
Let's peel their caps back
The cars at the corner like a long black snake
Night prowlin' for a life to take
Ya see down in the ghetto it's an eye for an eye
That's the answer to the question why
In my throat, there's a lump, then I swallow it, I ain't no chump
Face of Death, then I cocked my pump
I'm a nigga on the trigger, madder than a pitbull
Just layin for a reason to pull
On you, any duck motherfucker that gets in my way
I'm insane, and my homeboy's death made me this way
But then we spot him, Evil E shot him
Dead in the face, made sure that he got him
Others ran, but no mercy to the posse's wrath
Automatic Uzi motherfuckin bloodbath
Let's peel their caps back
Let's peel their caps back
Let's peel their caps back
Then all of a sudden, a bullet came through my eye
My dome exploded and I felt my other brothers die
I drank my blood as I fell like shit into the street
My corpse stunk like a burnt out rotten piece of meat
Ten brothers died in this stupid homicidal binge
Cause whenever someone dies, nobody wins
But this drama, you'll never hear a word of
Cause all the paper's gonna read is a gang murder

Please Believe Me,Gangsta Rap,2006," Baby, I wanna let you know I really like how this is going down
 Yeah, I like how it's going down too, daddy!
 Though we can make big moves, baby I know, real big moves..
 Ummm.. just tell me what I gotta do and I'm down for whatever!

Girl, if you do what I tell you to
You can have this whole world if you wanted to
Buddy, it ain't going to be easy
Just listen to a player, and please believe me!

Let's start this off with facts
You got on some nice shoes but you walk in it
You got on nice coat but you're outside it
Now, if you're ready to accept that state you was made in upgrade
Hiding up your game in form
I can let you come over here with me and get real real warm
They say: if you knew better, you'll choose better
And you think wrong, you think wrong
You can't swing a slow batter the fast pitch
The problem with most of you women, y'all so used to loosing
You can't even figure out what you want
Now first, we gotta let you know everything
If you did - you'll be living on the side of the mountains
Somewhere in Seattle like Bill Gates
And I don't know everything that's true
But I definitely do know more than you
One thing is you got style, cause you quote my eye
Two is you got class, that's what makes you fly
Three is you're intelligent cause you're listening to me talk
And four is you're very very sexy, you can see that in the way you walk
But all that ain't work nothing if you don't get it together and move something
Now, this game is played in ones and twos, that means soloists and crews
And that's exactly what I'm trying to do, is team up with you
But you have to learn how to take some instructions, boo
Please believe this, and listen to me


Alright, baby look..
I can see you harmonious cause your rent is more than my mortgage
So it's obvious you ain't got enough left to pay attention
But I.. I'ma renew your lease for a small fee
Then we gonna psychologically house-shop
So you can have some space for that brain of yours
Consider me Real Estate
Now, I can't front, you're fly
And you're hanging around me for some reason so I must be the shelter
They say: conversation is like a combination
So I'ma open that safe, take a turn at it
You want-a dime, yeah, you want-a dime
But your nigga paint you a picture
How much cents do that make?
Alright then.. now, what you should do
Is grow some hands on that forehead of yours
So you can hold that thought
I see you used to get in your way that's why you go on the wrong direction
You need a RUN D.M.C. and 'Walk This Way'
Don't you need two pilots to fly the plane?
But only one get to hold the steering wheel, baby
So sit back, relax your ass, cause you're flying first class
And this going to be a smooth ride, baby, and please believe me


Now, I'ma give you the real deal
I'm going to need at least two more inches on them heels
And that gut made up cool to you, but I'ma ask you for a stirrup or two
And as for your hair.. I ain't even going to go there
Just keep it clean and tight, and would be alright
Overall.. I think you're fine
And I'm sure I can buck out the dime
And this is going to take a little time
First, you got to forget everything you know
Cause right now..
You're on a real course to becoming a real motherfucking whore
Now, that's cool too..
But at least let me show you how to be a motherfucking pro
Cause it ain't going to be all fun
If you're fucking with me, you better duck or run
This is final level of the game baby
And it ain't going to be all biscuits and gravy
You got to have a nerve, for the motherfucking curve
Cause we can do it either way, baby
The street way, or the corporate sweet way
But no matter how me and you do it, girl
It would definitely.. be the elite way

 Awww! you know, I'm down, baby
 That's what I'm talking about
 Ha ha ha ha!
 Yeah, I know you like it when I see you smilling..
 Ha ha ha ha ha!
 Yeah girl, I see you're feeling this right..",https://genius.com/Ice-t-please-believe-me-lyrics
Make it Funky,Rhyme Pays,1987.0,"(Make it funky)
So the people can get down to the funky sound
'Cause my crew don't mess around
(Make it funky)
So the girls can get busy, dog the dance floor
Make the guys get dizzy
(Make it funky)
Totally def as Evil E cuts the records and the beat is kept
(Make it funky)
Stupid fly, it's got to be F-U-N-K-Y
So that you can get loose as I produce sounds hard as the deuce
Manipulate the bass gain give the level's a boost
The lyric layer rhyme sayer, born to be player
If politics were my kick then I'd be your mayor
Governator, Senator, I'm your mentor
Rap rhythm is erratic, time is four, four
I'm the microphone scholar, clockin' long dollars
Here to make the place funky while the fly girls holler
Genius vocalist, rhyme style priceless
Pound of gold around my neck, mic in my first
The microphone virtuoso crazy insane I'm loco
With the speed to exceed, make other MC's look slow-mo
Un-lease release words mean as a beast
I eat MC's for lunch and dinner, I can serve for a feast
Their rhymes are elementary, mine deserve a PH D
This beat is F-U-N-Key my name is Ice T
Make it funky
Undoubtedly you recognize this jam is the ultimate cut
Uncontrollably you motivate and move your butt
It's rough the beat is gangsterous, call it tough
If you're dissin' stop frontin', come on what's up?
Complicated voice gymnastics are all in your face
Vegas got my highs, E.V's got control my bass
My break is comin' get busy no time ta waste
Now's the time do bodywork here's the place
Make it funky
Make it funky enough so the tracks lay tough
'Cause I'm tossin' it up and the Ice don't bluff
The girl charmer toy Harmer, juice strong as armor
When I stand upon the stage you could call it melodrama
Intense suspense my voice immense
I wouldn't have you come and see me under false pretense
The girlies do be wildin' as I'm profilin'
Limos lined around the block for about a mile and a half
Autographs the list goes on
If you forgot it, ""make it funky"" is the name of this song
Stupid dope and you know it, it rates a ten
You pray my DJ cuts the records so it starts again
'Cause I can keep the mic cookin' for an entire month
My rhymes are always hard hittin' I don't know how to bunt
My DJ cuts like a laser E-V-I-L-E
Put your finger on the records
Make it, make it funky

Radio Suckers,Power,1988.0,"People, it's time for the Ice crush
So listen to my words I bring much
Sense, as I commence, my lyrics intense
Your telephoto, break out your big lens
Look, check out the sales charts
My record's kickin', I'm breakin' P.D.'s hearts
They banned me from their shows
Because they said I'm too hard
But no sell-out, I guess I'm just barred
I ain't changin' mine for nobody
They bleeped words from Doug's 'La Di Da Di'
I can't get a bleep? What's the deal?
Maybe my words are just too real
It's not profanity, it's just the man & me
He doesn't want you to see what I see
Doesn't want you to be what you can be
Word, censorship of reality
""Radio suckers never play me""(x3)
Suckers don't, but some do
The real troopers bring the Ice to you
And close friends to me, yea, Public Enemy
These stations have high intellect
They don't pretend to be, too bourgeois to rock a jam raw
Understand what I'm sayin', they're down by law
They play the jams that are right, sometimes not polite
They realize you gotta get some people uptight
Speak the word, your voice will definitely be heard
Lie to yourself, you're destined to be to the curb
Some stations don't care, they'll never put on the air
Nothin' but commercial junk, their brain power's impaired
They don't listen or try to hear what I write
Maybe just think once, or try some school at night
They're makin' radio wack, people have to escape
But even if I'm banned, I'll sell a million tapes
""Radio suckers never play me"" (x3)
I make records for music, not for the money
To some of you that might sound funny
But I ain't broke, and I don't joke
And my lyrics are known to make ears smoke
Clear as a gun scope, I speak the pure dope
Can the radio handle the truth? Nope
Uncut, no edits, no censors
You can get a plastic rapper from any ol' dispenser
A penny a yard, to make a record ain't hard
But to make it mean something, that's a job
But then we do it, they refuse it
So I tell them duck suckers to cold go screw it
We shouldn't sell out, we should just yell out
And get them wack motherfuckers the hell out
""Radio suckers never play me"" (x4)
Cruisin' down the street what do I see?
Crash Task Force, L.A.P.D
Gangs illin', wildin' and killin'
Hustlers on a roll, like they got a million
Girls on the strap and you know that
You know the guys will stop wildin' if you stop that crap
But you can't, you want money so bad
You'll jock anything with the Gucci tag
You gotta have it, so the men go get it
Robbin' and stealin', soon to regret it
Livin' in a jail cell, feelin' like a dumbbell
While you jump the next jock, well
That's reality, that's what I see
Nobody says that you got to agree
Censorship, that ain't the way to be
I thought you said this country was free?
""Radio suckers never play me"" (x2)
Tone it down is what they say to me
The FCC will not allow profanity
Your subject matter's too hard, make a love song
You better get real, come on
I ain't no lover, I'm a fighter
Hardcore radical rap rhyme writer
Pushin' the button, E does the cuttin'
Everything I say amounts to something
More than a single rap, I'm too deep for that
I lay my lyrics with logic, press the wax
Play it on your tape deck, feel the effect
If you can't take the heat, eject
But I know you can, 'cause you're an Ice-T fan
No sell-outs here, my man

Personal,Power,1998.0,"And the guitar's on there?
Do this (do this, do this)

Emcee's no time out, it's time to rhyme out
You dug your own grave, now you must climb out
Dig out, crawl out, hide from the fallout
'Cause when I get mad, I go all out
Ice, cooler than the coldest cube, dude
And when I'm micin', boy, I'm known to get rude
Criminal background,it's time to get down
I use a silencer, don't like the loud sound
Of my mic blast, you better run fast
The last punk that popped junk passed
Spit on his grave, laughed, jumped in my stretch
Signed his bitch an autograph
Syndicate boy, I don't fool out
You're full grown, school's out
You try to diss? I think you better cool out
'Cause your butt is smoke, if we ever duel out
This jam is directed to all of those who expected
For me to cold be rejected, but now I'm highly respected
And now their ears are infected with dollar signs I collected
Jealous punks, I said it!

Take it personal
Personal, personal

Take it personal, punk, I'm talkin' to you
And if they agree with you, then your crew too
I never diss an emcee, I wish 'em all good luck
But if you diss me to my face, duck
My style don't ramble, you shouldn't gamble
With your grill, I got a fist like an anvil
I write a record, lock it on the topic
Evil and Iz dog the track, then we drop it
Record stores rock it, stock it, fans buy it
People that never heard of Ice-T, try it
Then you try to diss? You got gall
I got gold on my neck and gold on my wall
Gold in my fingers, gold in my ear
When this jam's spinnin', gold's what you hear
Toy, this ain't Christimas, no time to play
I ain't no child,punk,you'll get sprayed
Illin' on a mega-villain
You must want a pine box to go chill in
Buried deep, creep, no one will weep
'Cause the next night, with your bitch I'll sleep

Take it personal
Personal, personal

I ain't East Coast, West Coast, new style, or old style
You wanna know about me? Check police files
Get out my face or you might have a bruised one
Brass knuckle prints? Yes, I used some
I ain't here to boast, I don't do that
When I talk it's straight dope, pure facts
I rock hard but still called a new jack
But talk shit, you're sure to get head-cracked
I don't drink or smoke or do dumb drugs
But my posse's still labeled street thugs
LAPD's got all my boy's mugs
Can't use my phone for the damn bugs
I live in privacy, don't like suckers hawking me
News reporters, some think they can talk for me
Lies, misquotes, changin' all my words around
But if I catch 'em on the street, they'll get beat down
They get money for hype-type publicity
They don't think twice about dissin' me
But that's a mistake, with the Syndicate you shouldn't mess
I hope those punk reporters wear vests

Take that personal
Personal, personal
Now the words I speak to some may sound radical
But I'll explain, it's simply mathematical
You diss, I diss, this is creates an equal
You reply to my diss, this is called a sequel
I reply to your diss, this is called a battle
Not intelligent, not very adult
So I don't battle, I just put heads out
A straight line is always the direct route
I write lyrics clear to leave no doubt
Don't even have to say who I'm speakin' about
You know who you are, you just jealous
'Cause you hear my records are million sellers
Try to say I'm wack out on the streets
While your whole crew is jockin' my beats
See me on TV and in the papers
See me at a jam, catch vapors!

This shit is personal

I Love Ladies,Rhyme Pays,1987.0,"Ya heard the Ice was rockin', ticket sales were high
Bought some fresh Adidas so you could look fly
Broke out from your crib rushin' to get here
Tripped ans stumbled almost broke your neck comin' down the stairs
Jumped into your ride, pushed the speed to the limit
Jumped out of your car faster than you jumped in it
Now you're at the jam but in for a shock
Stupid big line wrapped around the block
Through the walls of the hall you could hear me rhyme
Methodically you schemed a way to cut in line
But when you got inside the sight straightened your curls
Cause as you look around all you could see were girls
I love ladies
I think it's time that I tell the truth
I been dissin' females since my early youth
But you know that's a drag and there's no doubt
Cause females are the one thing that I can't do without
Female companionship is my one vice
I love to buy the girls things, love to treat em real nice
Homeboys you must admit the best part of each day
Is when a beautiful lady comes walkin' your way
Females possess that one commodity that no man will ever have
Not that hangs around me
They got it, we want it, they move it, and flaunt it
They shake it and sway it, we'll die just to lay it
We try to supress it until they undress it
And beg 'em to use it, and cry not to lose it
No man can deny it so don't even try it!!!
I love ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)
I Love Ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)
That sounds nice (You know we love you Ice!!)
I'm junkie for females and that's a fact
I'm not into havin' my homeboys rubbin' my back
Don't dig goin' to the movies alone
Or talkin' to myself on the telephone
Goin' to a disco that's packed with men
That's like tryin' to get a dance in the federal pen
Walkin' through a park with a gang of the guys
And a beach full of fellas never opened my eyes
And man if females are one thing that you don't need
You better get away from me at a high rate of speed
Cause if you don't like them you must like men
And homeboy that's where our serious problems begin
Because to me women are God's true gift
There's absolutely no question who I'd rather be with
I love ladies
I seen this fly girl walkin' down the street
Jammin' a box rockin' to the beat
The girl looked pretty, she really looked nice
So I said to myself she's got to be with the Ice
Walked over to her, started sayin' my rhyme
She said ""Ice you're so bad, you damn near blew my mind""
I kept on rappin', runnin' my mouth
The next thing I knew I was at her house
Looked at her closely, said for goodness sake
The girl was cut like a diamond, had curves like a snake
Her top half was heaven, the bottom was the hell
I knew tonight that the Ice was gonna rock well
But then she started talkin' mess about love and romance
Until she noticed the bulge growin' in my pants
You should'a seen the girl's eyes as my body expanded
She grabbed for my leg, raw sex she demanded
My knees started knockin', I tried to run
She said ""Please don't leave Ice, I want you to come""
This girl meant business I had no doubt
This is just about the time that the Ice passed out
The next day I woke the girl was through
Room still smokin', my legs black and blue
My eyes bloodshot, my hair pressed straight
My knees still knockin', I knew I lost weight
She was the best y'all, yes on this earth
I would'a paid a million dollars, that's what it was worth
If I had got her name or number it would'a been nice
But I'm here to let you know the girl went off on the Ice
I love ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)
I Love Ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)
That sounds nice (You know we love you Ice!!)
No when it comes to partyin' the ladies know how
When I ask for a reply they always scream owww!!
It's the homeboys always tryin' to act real chill
Sometimes it's jealous MC's mad cause they ain't on the bill
Maybe they scared if they say ho!
They might lose their cool
But I got some news for you: a fool's a fool
But don't get me wrong, most fellas do rock
They put their hands in the air, they take the show to the top
They start rockin' with the ladies once the show begins
They don't stand lookin' stupid like some mannequins
They don't lean against the wall like they're I some trance
They did not come with no intention to party or dance
You know what? yo dead beats should just stay home
Leave me, my homeboys, and the ladies alone
We love ladies",https://genius.com/Ice-t-i-love-ladies-lyrics
Soul on Ice,Power,1988.0,"It was a Saturday night on the streets of Cali
Threw on my dope silk suit, brushed off my suede Bally's
Threw on enough gold for any girl's pleasure
Left a pound and a half of that shit still in the dresser
I slapped a clip in my nine, threw a clip in my sock
Pick three grand up off the dresser, it was ten on the dot
Now my beeper started beepin, I threw that shit in the sink
I didn't need it no more, I had more money than 
Brinks
See, I was quittin the game and tonight was my fling
You see, on the streets they're players but only one king
Now that's the title I held but the game is real fast
You gotta get in and get out if you expectin to last
Now my homeboy Evil was downstairs chillin in his brand new Benz
I had many adversaries but very few close friends
We broke to the set, E parked the car on the grass
High-signin was his trademark and he did it with class
Hit the door like two titans, the whole jam stopped to stare
And as we walked through the crowd they threw bills in the air
I spied my man Jazz maxin out with two stone cold freaks
""Yo, what's up Ice, you rich now, man, you too good to speak?""
Now Jazz was a player from the east coast, the Bronx
He was known to be hard on the women and a brother he'd stomp
Smack a bitch in a minute, some say just for fun
And he was known for his chrome-plated pearl-handled gun
""Yo Ice, you my brother and I love you and all
But what's up with that six g's you owe me, man
...'member when your boys took that fall?
And I posted the bail cause yo ass was locked up""
Evil gave Jazz ten g's and Jazz shut the fuck up
Just then I saw Donald-D hit the front door
More gold than a Aztec, black leather he wore
Hoes grabbed for they niggas when D hit the set
Cause what Donald-D wanted is what Donald-D'd get
Donald's eyes hit mine and a smile crossed his face
Then a light hit his ring and blinded the whole goddamn place
""Yo Ice, you the coolest and Evil, you mean
But I got the fliest new shit rollin off gasoline""
Everyone in the party moved quickly outside
To see Donald-D's ultimate Superfly ride
It was black, it was low, cost twice that of my Porsche
A Testarossa Ferrari - convertable of course
It purred like a jet, ""Yo man, I bought it with cash""
It had 'Donald-D' written in gold on the dash
Then out of nowhere came a shot across the street
I felt pain in my chest and my knees got weak
There was blood on my hands and I fell to the ground
And all I could hear was, ""Yo, Ice is down!""
Somebody had shot me that night that I quit
The night that I ended all this hustlin playin shit
It's ironic ain't it, the night I retired
Would be the same night that my whole life expired",https://genius.com/Ice-t-soul-on-ice-lyrics

Thought that I would never get you? Got you
Doggin the floor like you know you never done before
How could a brother be so hardcore
And still keep you on the floor like a maniac
That's your question? Well I'mma answer that

Eight years of mine, no time for draggin
You wanna be an MC? ""Get off the bandwagon!""
But if it's in your heart, get a pen
Don't stop writin til the inkflow ends
Work and work and don't halfstep
Dog the mic every chance you get
Motivation must be kept
Stay down and build your rep
Yo so let me demonstrate, rappin as a fine art
And when I'm finished, you can take this rap apart
Analyze my elements and tactics
First I'm over there, and then I'm back to this
I jumble topics, you won't know where I'll go
Back in your face with a cold but steady flow
You feel the power of the Ice in the first row
You already know what to say, ""HOOOOOOOOO!!!""
On the mic is a stone cold vet
Evil E's on the set, hit the deck
{*Evil E scratches for a long time*}

I'm in my mode, called the fourth episode
Or the last verse, if you wanna decode
So I gotta raise the heat, hype up the beat
Switch the mic from airtight to elite
Pounce upon the deck, it ain't wet yet
Let me see how hot you can get
Then I'll turn up the amps, blow out the lights
You're in darkness, then the mic ignites
Glowin like it did before, but even more
The room is lit, the raps are hardcore
Evil cuts the records like a psycho with a switchblade
You see a blur -- that's the crossfade
Loud and proud, words bombard the crowd
Look up in the air -- you see a mushroom cloud
I kick flavor to a musical track
Too fast to catch, too complex to match
I'm gettin hyped as hype can get

Intro,Rhyme Pays,1987.0,"A child was born in the East one day
Moved to the West coast after his parents passed away
Never understood his fascination with rhymes or beats
In poetry he was considered elite
Became a young gangster in the streets of L.A
Lost connections with his true roots far away
But no matter the job or crime
He never lost his hardcore obsession to rhyme
New York's hip hop movement broke loose
DJ's cut records, raps had the juice
Since busting rhymes was his natural thing
He was crowned the west coast MC king
But after his inauguration there was a rush
Of wack rappers with one intention to crush
This master rapper and take his throne
A simple job,he had no crew, he stood all alone
Assassins came in groups of one through five
With raps no mortal MC could survive
But he showed no mercy, he rapped blood thirsty
Battling from Friday on through to Thursday
Never losin a bout, never ending in doubt
Every confrontation K.O. knock out
On his never ending journey to the T.O.P
The L.A. player M.C. ICE-T",https://genius.com/Ice-t-intro-lyrics
Message to the Soldier,Home Invasion,1993.0,"Yo, Ice, you been down with the struggle for a long time, man...
Why don't you drop some knowledge for these brothers who
Want to get involved in this war...
Take notes: real gangstas wear trench coats
Grey suits, black ties and they seek votes
And you're not to be misled
They'll kill you in your fuckin' bed
They don't sell dope, yo, excuse me, yes they do
But they don't look that much like me or you
But if you pull up the sheets and expose them
They'll crawl up like snakes and show fangs of venom
Now I've been soldier for years
Representin' the tattooed tears
Other brothas locked up with no choice
Left in the 
bowels of the devil
 with no voice
My phones are tapped, my crib is bugged
My car is tailed from club to club
And this ain't no fuckin' joke
They want to see a nigga broke
You can't slip, if you slip you're out
You gotta know what you're talkin' about
Drop science every chance you get
Hit direct and indirect, speak in code
Cause you're never alone
That's why I use this low tone
Follow this and you might grow older
This is a message to the soldiers...
Now they killed King and they shot X
Now they want me, you could be next
All you gotta do is speak too loud
All you gotta be is be too proud
Cause once you let'em know
Who you are and where you're at
You better watch your back
Cause you might think you're just dope
While you're livin' in a sniper's scope
I'm not tryin' to scare you
But there's a danger if you get too deep
Some nights I don't sleep
All you wanna do is tell the truth
All you wanna do is save the youth
Ice Cube knows, Souljah knows, P.E. knows
They throw death blows
And if you got kids or a girl that's true
They'll move on them too
But when I'm gone I need you to carry on
You gotta be strong and fight for our salvation
But there will be retaliation, soldier...
To think that rap couldn't be attacked
Is ignorin' the simple fact
That they never ment us to speak
They had planned to keep the black man weak
But rap hit the streets
Black rage amplified over dope beats
Now they want to shut us down
And they don't fuck around
Check the history books, son
Black leaders die young
They tell us that your words are scary
They're revolutionary
Because we speak the truth
About crime and drugs
And expose the real thugs
This info is not beneficial
To the groups that go by three initals
So they try to discredit
They'll dog you with an edit
Print the words the way you never said it
But we gotta make'em regret it, soldiers...
Word! I know a lot of brothas out there want to get in this war...
You know what I'm sayin'? a lot of sistas got a lot of knowledge to drop on our people. But right now they're movin' to shut down all hip-hop. The first amendment had absolutely nothin' to do with black people, at the time constitution was written, we were considered nothin' but property...The expectation of havin' black people speak on records never came to mind, so we gotta move!
But believe me, all the black leaders have been silenced and most
Of the time it's been violent, so if you choose to get in this war
Realize what you're in for but we gotta move on...
And we gotta stay strong...

But I don't know if I should put it on this record, yaknahmsayin?
Man go ahead and kick it man
Let the people know what's happenin man
You know brothers out there sellin out man
Why they goin out like that man?
Yo, sellin out like it ain't nothin man
I ain't with it

Dig it, I'm just a brother from L.A
South Central, I live life the fly way
Used to bang and hustle but I traded for the big game
Infamy got dumped for fame
Now I'm known and respect as creator of the crime rhyme
;
But my lyrics are deeper
Because I'm the one that makes you think before make a move
I wrote ""Pusher"", ""High Rollers"", and ""Colors"" just to prove
That I could kick game, and drop knowledge at the same time
But one L.A. station wouldn't play my records one time
I'm tryin to save my community
But these bourgeoise blacks keep on doggin me
They don't care about violence, drugs and gangs
KJLH, you ain't about nuttin
You just a bunch of punk bourgeoise black suckers
And this one's for me
You won't play no Public Enemy
You ain't playin no Boogie Down Productions
You ain't tryin to represent the black community
You just carin about your little ol' R&B +BULL+
You play all day and night
I represent Los Angeles all over the United States
And you ain't did NUTTIN for me
Think about it
Hold up, I ain't finished on the diss tip
There's a few more punks that I got to rip
All you chump MC's who sell out quick
When P.E. was on the top, you rode the tip
But now they got problems and you suckers run
Who's Chuck's real friends, does he really have one?
You yell P.E. this, P.E. that
Fist in the air, proud to be black
Now they got static and you run like punks
I haven't heard an MC stand up for him once
Maybe you suckers are just hopin that they fall off
So you can fill their shoes, nope sorry boss
That's what the matter with black people anyway
We ain't down with nothin, I don't care what you say
Yell or lie, don't even bother
How low will a brother go for a dollar?
Public Enemy broke a new rap age
And now you rappers ain't got nuttin to say?
""Yo it's their problem"" ""Griff shouldn'ta said it""
E where's my pistol? (Yo I'll go get it)
Cause it's time for me to enforce some discipline
Are you down or not, are you out or in?
Chuck Flav and Griff are my true friends
I got their backs if it means my career ends
All you so-called down MC's with Public Enemy
I ain't heard nobody out there, tryin to help my man out
YouknowhatI'msayin? Griff is my man, I don't care WHAT he said
YouknowhatI'msayin? And I ain't gon' let them go out like that
YouknowhatI'msayin? Chuck, Ice got your back
Anybody out there got problems with Public Enemy, come talk to me
Once again, I'm back in the diss mode
I gotta speak my mind, it's time to unload
On this so-called government we've got
If I lied like them, I think I'd get shot
They sell drugs to kids and say it's us
And when the cops are crooks, who can you trust?
You only see young brothers in a drug bust
Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust
My homey got a year for an ounce of weed
While Bush sells weapons to the enemy
You gotta be stone blind not to see
""Our government is honest!"" Nigga, please
Cocaine can't be made in the United States
Kickin facts like this our government hates
The young kids on the streets ain't the enemy
They're just ghetto youth after money
They sell drugs, but who sells drugs to them?
Try the C.I.A. my friend
Or the F.B.I. or even Bush
Somebody's gettin rich, damn sure ain't us
We're just killin ourselves while others laugh
Look at the street, it's a cocaine bloodbath
We gotta realize dope is pure death
Mess with drugs, you're breathin your last breath
Sellin drugs is straight up genocide
They're gonna laugh, while we all die
Sittin up there thinkin you're makin that money
Hustlin and all that, you're killin your brothers
YouknowhatI'msayin? You just stupid, straight up stupid
Puttin dope into your body - c'mon, youknowhatI'msayin?
You gotta get somethin goin out there
Get some brains, youknowhatI'msayin?
We are just playin ourselves cold out of the pocket
This one's for me, I make records for you
But this cut I straight out had to do
There's topics in my mind I have to break
Cause so many of you out there are so damn fake
If ya ain't know they're no-one, cutthroats
Backstabbers, scheamin for banknotes
And all of you out there know what I'm talkin bout
If you claim you're down then NEVER sell-out
Never sell out, youknowhatI'msayin?
You gotta stay down for yours
You know I want it, sure as I'm Ice-T
I make records for you, but this one's for me
You know what I'm talkin bout out there
There's ways to sell out left and right
But you ain't got to do that
There's things more important than money
I'm talkin bout pride, I'm talkin bout dignity
You got it out there
All you got to do is stand on your own two feet
Don't go out like no sucker
Stay down, youknowhatI'msayin?

Prepared to Die,O.G. Original Gangster,1991,"Artist: Ice-T
Album: O.G. Original Gangster
Song: Prepared to Die
Watch me flip and rip
On the freedom tip
Open your mind
See the point of the ice pick
I stand tall
While my brothers
Still choose to crawl
Black power, it7s in effect yall
But you don't understand
You're still a slave to the man
Prepare for revolution
Some sucker say we're free
I gotta disagree
Half my posse's in the penitentiary
So I'm a drop and kick the science
With defiance
Because I have no alliance
With suckas who choose
Not to act Black
When they are Black
Get out my face with that
You better ease back
Cause Mandela did 27 hard ones
Not in a windowed room
But in a barred one
While his wife had tears in her eyes
The man is a hero
He needs a Nobel Prize
But that will never happen
So I'm gonna keep rappin'
Freein' my brothers' minds
From their entrapment
To silence the Ice, they'll probably
Put a bullet in me
But I'm prepared to die
And Mandela's free!",https://genius.com/Ice-t-prepared-to-die-lyrics
The Hunted Child,The Iceberg / Freedom of Speech... Just Watch What You Say,1989.0,"(Today in Los Angeles another youth loses his life. Gunshot wound to the head. Street violence is at an all-time high)
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do? Death row? What a brother know
No jokin', I'm sleepin' with my eyes open
Wanted for a homicide ride, the gun's still smokin'
Didn't know what I was doin' but did it anyway
Now the posse's on my trail, they say I'm gonna pay (Run!)
I had a gun, it's mine and I packed it
Out with my crew, the boys caught some static
Me and this sucker punk went at it
Bang! Nine automatic
Hunted Child
I'm the Hunted Child
(Sources say the assailant was 17-years old and lives in South-Central Los Angeles)
Now I'm on a hideout tip cos they're after me
LAPD says they're gonna capture me
Was I crazy? I guess I had to be
Cos once you kill it's instant catastrophe
Your whole life is over (Through!)
Forget about your girl your (Crew!)
Nowhere to run, so what you gonna do?
Be glad it's me, homeboy, and not you
The Hunted Child
I'm the Hunted Child
Hunted Child
I'm the Hunted Child
I'm only 17, I didn't mean to kill, man
But I was slangin' and bangin' for the thrill, man
When they said (Kill!) I felt chill, man
But once I pulled the trigger, boy, then things got ill, man
My homeboys dipped out the back fast
Left me alone in the echo of the gun blast
Everybody saw my face, I didn't wear a mask
You wanna know my name? Just ask
The Hunted Child
I'm the Hunted Child
Hunted Child
I'm the Hunted Child
(The science of Capitalism which you teach to the youth on the streets today with the 'ends justifying the means' mentality ain't happenin')
I'm sweatin' heavy cos my face is on TV
Everybody in this whole world's after me
Since I was young I never had a damned thing
At Christmas time I'd hate to hear the bells ring
Cos in the ghetto Santa ain't got a dime
Your mother's standin' in the welfare line
The way the youth survive is crime
My life is over so I might as well speak my mind
I killed a brother cos this system had me geared to kill
Cos what I call home you call hell
My ghetto quarters ain't no better than a jail cell
But there's a message in this story that I'm tryna tell
We're just brothers on the streets killin' brothers
This system has us geared to kill one another
Sellin' dope to poison each other
The plan of The Man, word to the mother
But I'm a sucker cos I fell into their plan
187, I killed a brother man
My life on Earth was hell, you understand?
But when I die I'm goin' to hell again
I'm the Hunted Child...",https://genius.com/Ice-t-the-hunted-child-lyrics
Street Killer,O.G. Original Gangster,1991.0,"OK check this out, I got a crazy posse
I got the stupidest motherfuckin' posse in the whole goddamn city
You fuck with me I'll snatch out your car
Right in front of your goddamned bitch
And beat you down right there
I got more guns than anybody
I got crazy guns, you know, I got homeboys on motorcycles
And when we come we wearin' our blue
You know what I'm sayin'?
And I'll beat your fuckin' ass
Don't nobody call me on my name
Cause they'll get smacked the fuck up, you know
Can't put me in jail
You can't even fuck with me
Cause I'm the craziest motherfucker on the street
Don't nobody want none of this

Check Your Game,The Seventh Deadly Sin,1999,"Chorus:
It's 99 players check your game
Make sure them young boys respect your name
Keep your heaters at close reach cocked and ready
Cause the streets will catch you slipping, rock ya steady
Watch your back with your homies that you feel is real
Your homeboys from your crew, yeah them the ones that do you
The suckas that got the player hater venom
I wanna take 'em outside and lay some slugs up in em

When they need work
They call the cali drug expert
Smashing in a six hundred dollar bill burnt
Looking flossy living costly
Off the edge, out of state
They gots to break bread, for sho
I needs mo' ice drops for the lexo
Briggetts sets blow when I'm sipping the mo'
Freelancing, trying to build a mansion
And stay faded
Have hoes walk around my crib butt naked...

True, pop the remy kick back and let the players represent
High floss true boss game and take aim
These sucka wannabe's
Nigga please - you're green
I'll bend hoes on the downlow - banks obscene
Wanna chill with these niggas, bet you wish you could
And suck game out my ass like sponges
I run this
You can't fuck with the steelo
You niggas wanna be low
When I'm on the east I play ceelo
Cash flow
One track mind serial hustler
Quick to break a buster ya snitch bitch?
I'll dust ya
Bentley ballin' bastard
No hustler faster
Game maker
I knock a white bitch and break her

But Ice, Chronic got me bruising my brain
But soothing my pain, I'm true to the game
I got my mind made I gotta be that rich motherfucker
Set it up so my grandkids don't suffer
The phat hummer
The phat drummer - what's your choice?
Trying to find a sister with a voice
Make her moist
I'm throwing up the W
Bringing trouble to
Those in sight
King T and Big Ice
Chorus:

But T that's trippin' and that ain't my sport
I'd rather lamp in my crib and flip the Robb report
And set my v-dozen on the streets
Bump my beats
Cause when I'm twisting my dubs
Can't nobody compete
Imagine this:
A hundred G 'lex on your wrist
Imagine this:
About ten karrots on your fist
Imagine this:
All dime hoes on your list
Ha - that shit would be nice
But your name ain't ""Ice"" - kid...
I'll screw the silencer on - rock you softly
How you gonna step to me kid? You grew up off me
TV, Movies, and Records and Tours
So many busters wearing Versace I don't wear it no more...

But this will be a classic
Many facets to get that ass kicked
The alchoholic Don, call me King Tragic
Watch me speak the magic
Watch me teach that old habit - full of havoc
And Ice'll tweak the mix when it statics
People pay
Just to have me stay
And say a verse
I'll freak a couple words unrehearsed
Then I burst
I mean I bust
From all angles
Guarunteed platium on your single

Yo T, I really must admit I'm blessed
Master V does some other shit TV's in the head rests
Never wear no vests because I got mad love
I catch respect when other niggas catch slugs
1, 2 I bust shit to load guns to
Beats for the hoodlums
Somebody's gotta do'em
Fed's screw 'em
Faggot's got my whole crib bugged
Mad tapps on the phone cause I deal with the thugs
Drugs? never
No, the Ice is too clever
I'm overseas
Checkin G's
Nigga please
Ballin' since the 70's - yeah baby
Blew up in the 80's
Now you niggas hate me
You can't see me motherfucker your focus is off
You can't be me motherfucker, you're broke and you're soft
Too many niggas try to pert my lifestyle - romancing
I was kickin game while them kids was breakdancing
Overlord - so why the wack niggas ain't dead?
Probably because my aim is over nigga's heads/
East coast - west coast, I play the whole map and bounce/
They got a benz but live in their mom's house...
Chorus

To all my G's rock on
Get your ride on - when you hear it
The forbidden Gangland lyric
Player Haters fear it
Get you right up close near it
Possessed by the Eazy-E spirit
Ice-T set the limit
And niggas won't cross this line
Suicide - and niggas won't cross this nine
In your mouth
Puffin' with my niggas down south
What the fuck this really all about? man..
I'm coming out
Front and back, 98 brougham
All you fake G's stay home
Leave that shit alone
King Tee's back on the throne
And that nigga on the mic - straight gone
Cra-zy, y'all niggas wanna know the real deal?
I'll freestyle and smack you in your grill

Depths of Hell,Home Invasion,1993.0,"* strictly best guess only on Daddy Nitro's reggae patois

Now hear dis!
All bad man what dey a know
The original bad man dey a know, seen?
Daddy Nitro, an' Ice-T dey 'pon ? man
Come talk wit reality
An' any guy who nah like dey got shot in ? face
No Ice-T, come talk wit reality star
Tell dem bout da endin of da world today.. COME!

I got a attitude as thick as a convict's
Bomb ticks, my heart beats as I rhyme over hard shit
Watch this, the nigga that you didn't think could do
Break through with the rhythm that'll rock your whole crew
Thought you knew; I ain't no punk or no pooh-butt
Step to me, the cops are still diggin niggas up
What's up? What's up? What's up? You wanna try your luck
You move, you weave, you bob, you got stuck
And now you're trippin with your fuckin brain
You never seen so much blood pour through one vein
You try to scream, you choke
You try to run, your legs are broke
You're bulletproof, I hope
Yo, I ain't no nigga to flex, but I will flip
Fuck up a nigga and dropkick his fuckin bitch
I love to squabble and I'm good widdit
So if you want some nigga come get it
I ain't trippin nigga trippin at all
Yo, I'm fuckin walkin over weak rapper's downfalls
It ain't my fault they fell, it ain't my fault I sell
I pull my ass up from the depths of hell

Lawd! Jib-bibbidy-bong, jib-bibbidy-be-bong-ska-dang
Daddy Nitro an' Ice-T come wid a different some-thang
Comin out de ghetto tings are wild like pure 'ell

While other lyrics are full of our style we fill up our clientele
Ice-T an' Nitro from the, depths of 'ell, COME!

You punks are jealous cause I'm rollin in fly shit
My shit, all paid for and I don't owe no guy shit
Fuck you, it ain't my fault your ass is on empty
Thought you was it, but you're smooth gettin pimped G..
.. I ain't no ho fool
Got much respect for the new and the old school
But many rappers can rip mics but can't count..
.. zero bank amounts
Word and many critics are hot cause hard rap hits
They like to make it all soft that we pop shit
Fuck that, I'll die before I let the hardcore go
Cause I'm a nigga from the G-H-E-T-T-O
I got a posse who's airtight, quick to fight
And got the power to continue or end the night
And if you stepped on wrong, then you're a done kid
The yellow tape's in the club because one did
I got no pity so don't ask me for fuckin any
I'll break a bum off but you niggas can't get a penny
When I was broke, I stole my gold, I pawned
I lived the life of a hustler off and on
I'm just a brother that lived to tell
I brought my ass up from the depths of hell

Come! In a de ghetto tings are wild round de clock
Some man a smoke crack and soem man a fire shot
Me tell de people dem laws, that we no inna dat
If a guy try dat thing we get them sixteen shotta
It's a lovely night ?? ?? off de chatta
Easy Ice-T make them no say you a mark-a
Anyway we go on I bet a no say we stop
Wit lyrics and de music and right on de ?
EASE UP and come again my selector
All over de world is only for pain an' sufferin
That's why Ice-T and Daddy Nitro come wit the reality thing
Nice this everytime star
Man like Ice-T 'pon the ?? man
Come in star, one last time and teach dem bout reality
Now watch dis, COME!

I met this girl who act like I owed her somethin
Nothin, all I owed her was some good steady fuckin
Fuck that, not the one that's gonna fall on no ho trap
Ease back bitch, before you need all your teeth back..
.. I ain't no fuckin mark
Made all my money workin bowcutters in the dark
Snatch bars and cars and vice grips
Long handled sledgehammers, saws and wire snips
I got an ill side that drips from my brain at times
It still thinks of the psycho and brutal crimes
I still remember when I had a low cash flow
No hoes, no cars, no gear no dough
And times got wicked..
.. I even remember havin to sell all my pawn tickets
But suckers spread out and they left me with few friends
But that's who wit me as we fuck up the true ends
So don't be trippin if your luck's gone bad, be glad
It'll empty out the fake fuckin friends you had
Then get yourself together, nigga aim straight
Shoot point blank at your goals, work hard and wait
You can do it even if you fell
I brought my ass back from the depths of hell

Cause we are serious, en-ter-tain-ers
Talk about de Ice-T, he no joker
Cause we are serious, en-ter-tain-ers
Talk about de Daddy Nitro me no joker
Me come and pull up my lyrics and full up my style

Walking in the Rain,Gangsta Rap,2006,"That's what I'm talking about
Iceberg, 2006, remember this?

Go Ice man!
Walking in the rain with the people I love, feels so fine ""UHHA!!""
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind ""YEAH!!""
Walking in the rain with the people I love, feels so fine ""UHHA!!""
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind

Damn, this record takes me way back, to day that
I said the words I love you, I'm not the kind to say that
I spent my lights in the streets with beef crooks
Shook cats get lifted off their feet with heat
Nobody loves, you can feel the cold in their hugs
At each man checks his weapon and protects his life
The last thing on my mind was ever having a wife
NO! I'm not the type to do that, I can't commit to that
But then you stepped to me ""Damn"" blew my whole spot up
Dropped me to my knees, and I still don't think I got up
Uhh.. you made me re-evaluate my G
Now, I'm gangster for you, baby, you gangster for me
And we're walking

Go Ice man! ""UHH!!""
Walking in the rain with the people I love, feels so fine ""YOU KNOW!!""
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind ""UHHA!!""
Walking in the rain with the people I love, feels so fine ""COME ON, GIRL!!""
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind

The truth is, it ain't easy for a brother from the streets
To ever show affection or an aim at direction
When we roll, you're by my side, I feel pride
And my partners got no problems cause they know that you're true
And if anything just jumps off I taught just what to do
Get low, get the bail money, call up the crew
You take a bullet for me, I'll take a bullet for you
We'll do old, strolling girl
You know how we do, we're just walking

Go Ice man! ""UHH!!""
Walking in the rain with the people I love, feels so fine ""UHHA!!""
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind ""YEAH, GIRL!!""
Walking in the rain with the people I love, feels so fine ""UHH!!""
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind

Break it down!!
Yeah, you know, it comes at time in every man's life
Player hustler or whatever
That he realizes.. that he needs that companionship of the woman
Strong woman to hold him down, through them cold nights
Through them hardships and pains and struggles in the streets
STRESS!!
Go Ice man  -----------] Coco

Realized I've grown in life I had to get shot
Before I understood; that you come in this world and die alone
Don't wanna spend my life chasing flash and cash
I'd rather whip through the hood with your feet on my dash
The homies understand and they're looking for girl to their own
So they can't get out these streets and stay home
It's cold when you got no one, but I've found mine
As long as we're together, girl, I know we'll be fine
Cause we're walking


UHH!! COME ON!!
Yeah girl, UHH!!
We're just.. holding hands.. holding our pistols
Rubbing your booty, yeah baby",https://genius.com/Ice-t-walking-in-the-rain-lyrics

Pimp Anthem,VI - Return of the Real,1996,"'96
Ah shit
Ice-T back
Representin, nigga, once again
That real shit, nigga
I thought you knew, bitch
Better recognize

Players, check your grip before you get popped
Bitches, get my money before you get dropped
Gotcha - buggin off the words I say
Because this type of pimpin happens every day

Niggas wanna know my steelo
Bitches wanna get with the baddest
Hustlin apparatus
It's the LA cash flow master-roller
No one gets colder, I used to flip boulders
Of caine, on my brain, it's outta control, crime plot
A dead-ass cop and muthafuckas get got
In the game it ain't safe for the weak or the timid
Known to break a bitch but barely rarely slide up in it
So you see me in a club, grab your woman like you wanna
Blink your eyes and the freak is out there freezin on the corner
She got caught by the curls and the jewels
Lookin for a nigga that is quick to pull tools
Now she's breakin herself, makin herself
Respect my technique of pimpin, minus all simpin
Check it bitches, it ain't nothin nice
You're gonna seal or sell pussy if you roll with the Ice


Oh my God, the nigga rolls hard..
Every player mentions me
The hustler of the century
(Ice, that nigga ain't nothin nice!)
I got more freaks than Heff', my bankroll's off vice
Commandin straight pimp tactics
None of y'all can match this
Meet a freak in a week, her workplace a mattress
Really though, recognize the pimp type flow
I don't smoke endo, I count cash on my patio
So much love on the streets, don't need no bodyguard
Big up to my homies with the pimp type nod
I'm off the hook, checkin traps in Vegas 
Full link mink with the matchin borsalino
I change cars like you change drawers, bitch
I got a stable full of thoroughbreds that make me rich
Niggas hate me, cause they can't control they roll
They see that fat old ass and start givin me cash


My mind's blown off fine champagne
So bent on currency, got green in my vein
So damn smooth that every woman wanna touch me
So much sexuality that nuns wanna fuck me
I kick back with my pimpin ballin brothers
Stand over the bed, dump the cash on the covers
The game's got me, I'm a slave to the roll
Hoes belong on the track and I belong in gold
Silk and satin, I deserve a pimpin pattin
Been in the life so long cause I stomp bitches who start rattin
Mostly friendly, but do got that gorilla in me
Save it for the player-hater niggas with the envy
Lot of niggas talk it, but they can't hold a hooker
Ice took her, she was too long a looker
It's strictly straight-lace hustlin on mine
I been pimpin all my life and I don't mind dyin",https://genius.com/Ice-t-pimp-anthem-lyrics
The Lane,VI - Return of the Real,1996,"The fast lane, half heart, half money
Ain't nobody smilin, ain't nothin funny

So baby, don't sleep
The fast lane, half heart, half money
Ain't nobody smilin, ain't nothin funny
Raise the risk, raise the profit
And can't nobody stop it
Unless your game's weak
So player, don't sleep

The streets crawl with ill niggas on the block
Goin hand in hand
Leanin in and out of sedans
Pumpin crack dreams to crack fiends for a fee
Their dream is to re-up to a ki
Cops watch the influx of dope
Through a telescope
Snitches in the game
Give the young g's names
Bitches on the jock
Of the hustlers on the block
Jump from gee to gee
Similar to a flea
Suck the blood out, or in this case the dough
Roll with the blow till considered a ho
Babies are born and pawned off to grandmama
The bitch ain't done, she still lives for the drama
Lookin for another baller
To hit and never call her
All in vain
Life in the Lane
A new crew of hookers on the track from up north
Vice cops, they watch em stroll back and forth
They take a pay-off
Or a blow job just to lay off
The Lane's no joke
Yo, you players stay broke
A ghetto garage makes a nice laboratory
PCP and crystal meth, wars of glory
End of story, gotta watch my back myself
Or else they'll find my body layin on a coroner shelf
It's the Lane


Gees take the game on the road to Minnesota
Supermarket's all sold out on baking soda
Gangbangers start to understand the dope game fast
Kidnap the drug dealers for the ransom cash
Gotta represent, what you say you are, that's a star
Feds got a homing device on your car
That made you easy to follow to Denver, Colorado
Birds you had, 12 now you got a l
Crack babies born in the hospitals cryin
Drive-by shootings can't end, kids are dyin
The cream is the ultimate goal
Gots to roll
Till my cash flow's mega
Baller not a beggar
Bitches workin plastic with the fake ID's
Life in the Lane, stackin up g's
Chop shops taggin up Benzes and Beamers
Crack spots boilin full kilos in beakers
Damn, the game's quicker than shit, don't slip
Cause bet your life there'll be another hustler checkin yo grip
It's the Lane


Brother on parole need a quick lick to come up
The score went bad, now he's back stuck
Bitches settin niggas up jacked and waxed
Small-time workers movin weight in a g ride Lac
Don't talk on your cellular, your phone is tapped
Don't check the rear view, there's no turnin back
It's the Lane, now you're in it, hit the gas and mash
Through the land of the hardcore hoes and cash
Jackers and robbers, hustlers and clockers
Everybody'll squeal, take the l or the deal
Yo, spin the wheel, for the cops you're a meal
Tailor suits gator boots make the fly hoes kneel
But if you miss, my friend, guess what you win
A one-way ticket to the federal state pen
It's the Lane you chose, you fill your shit, ride Rolls
High-priced clothes, baddest fuckin hoes
Anything goes, there's no limit, just mash
The cops will be there when you crash",https://genius.com/Ice-t-the-lane-lyrics
Freestyle/Zip-lock,Gang Culture,UnKnown,"* originally performed in Montreux, Switzerland 1995

COME ON SWITZERLAND!! JUMP!! JUMP!!
COME ON!! JUMP!! EVERYBODY JUMP!!
EVERYBODY JUMP!! EVERYBODY JUMP!!
EVERYBODY LET ME HEAR YOU SAY YEAH!! (YEAH!!)
SAY HELL YEAH!! (YELL YEAH!!)
SAY HELL MOTHERFUCKING YEAH!! (HELL MOTHERFUCKING YEAH!!)
NOW, SCREAM!! (AWWWWWWWWWW!!)
SWITZERLAND!! (AWWWWWWWWWW!!)
COME ON SCREAM!! (AWWWWWWWWWW!!)
Yo T, let's do this shit baby, dog

Is it new year God? I'm coming back mad hard
Moving harder than a convict with a shack in the yard
New Jacks wanna hear me rap, begging for freestyle skills
I've served so many rappers, I can make a land field, fool
You've doubt for a mic dude, the Ice is a jewel
Fuck rules, I got more pool than a mule
Matter of fact, you never comprehend the styles I sin
I keep breaking to annihilate fakes and teens
The Yellow nigga from the Westside cheered, I peel libs
What praying that you do, yo when I all ready did
Like your girl gotta admit she was a sexy bitch
But I hit it with the Jimmy so my nuts don't itch
So just check as I pore for the mic core
THE NIGGAZ!! THE NIGGA!! THE NIGGA!!
Six ounces, squeeze the trigger
For you hardcore motherfuckers that's been dying for.. this gangster shit
Time to squab and rob and fight, hit til you through
I got a strain in my brain like pain
But niggas sucking up my shit like I'm some crack cocaine
To you white kids, you better watch your head
As you popping down the street by these words I said

MONTREUX MAKE SOME GODDAMN NOISE!!
YEAH!! COME ON!! UHH!!
GET THEM UP Y'ALL!! YEAH!!
COME ON MAN, LET'S RIP THIS SHIT!!
RIP THIS SHIT UP!!

Once again I'm back in the place to be
The I, the C, the E, the T
I'll never get a Grammy, so fuck the G
All I need is crowd, and a M-I-C
Got a gangster ass DJ named Evil-E
My record label's called Warner B
William Morris is my agent
I'll never go broke, I got property
Got a dope pitbull named Felony
Got four gold albums, so what you're telling me?
Power was two, Iceberg was three
This one here shipped five hundred G
Now when I roll, I roll stupid deep
Benz's, Bemers, and booming Jeeps
I'm always strapped, cause my money I keep
You move on the Ice, and you're going to sleep
But when you see me walking down the street
You say, ""What's up Ice?"" -- what would I say, ""Peace!""
You give me a dap, I give you one back
Cause I ain't souped, so forget about that
We might take a picture or sign an autograph
Kick a little flavor to have some fun and laugh
But step to me wrong, you might get shot
And wind up looking out a ziplock!!!

YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!",https://genius.com/Ice-t-freestyle-zip-lock-lyrics
Dog ‘N’ The Wax,The Classic Collection,UnKnown,"Suckers step back, reacting his attack
Evil E's in the place, cold doggin' the wax!

WORD!! WORD!!

All punks grab for your mothers, today's the day
I'm here to say warriors come out and play
Rhyme for your lives, weak run and hide
My name is Ice-T, L.A.'s where I reside
Fly as a bird, also awesome with herb
If you bite I will take your life best believe that's word
FBI's most wanted, but them suckers can't stop me
Mean rapping mother, terrorizing Qaddafi
Few tried to match the def raps I wrote
Dis my rhyme that's the time, razor meets your throat
Born in New Jersey but raised in L.A
Streets just as hard and the player's still play
Far from a fag, getting paid for my brag
So if you wanna come and battle bring a body bag
Definitely deadly and that ain't no jive
And if you don't like what I'm saying, we can take it outside
'Cause ain't nothin' like a squabble 'cause you know I'ms fine
And if knife be your reason, then Uzi be mine
So all punks get ill cause you know I'm gonna
Rhymes that ignite bite like a piranha
Ice-T's just rockin' the tracks
And Evil E's in the place, just doggin' the wax!


I love the ladies who were down with the T
But what I hate and I state is a fool MC
You wanna battle the Ice, you gotta be insane
One step toward my reppin', I inflict the pain
Got so many raps, I got no place to store 'em
Got so many damn pages, I can wallpaper the Forum
Assassination, is my solution
No light operation, just massive contusions
Def dealing rhymer with a lust for blood
Conflict with the master and your name is mud
Kick it up, no mercy for the fact you're brave
I'll just bury your butt, then I'll spit on your grave
Laugh at your family as they stand and cry
Cold smack your mother all in the eye
'Cause I'll never get to heaven but you know damn well
I'll wear Bermuda shorts while I'm maxin' in hell
So all suckers step back, reacting the death's attack
Don't try to write me off, just talking like way smack
Because I'll leave a shamble, I hustle don't gamble
And I'll rock your butt blind like HBO scramble
Doggin' the wax!
""Warning. The surgeon general of Chilltown, New York has determined that the sounds you're about to hear, can be devastating to your ear""

Sharp as a razor, down as dirt
Rhyme is my life, party is my work
L.A. is my place, More Righteous is my base
So my lyrics make sense, no words I waste
Down for a duel, colder than Kool
Chill with the brothers who built the old school
Rhyme like a rocket, smooths in the pocket
Program the 808 and just lock it
Crash the studio with my crew, twenty four tracks mixed down to two
Jam hits the stores, packed kinds of floors
Freaks in my hotel room by the scores
This MC Ice-T, I rock the freaks to ecstasy
Take them to the T-O-P and bust them out officially
Never off, always on, rockin' to the break of dawn
Like this, like that, an MC that's not the whack
All rappers in the game, recognize my name
They write off as been lame, or get me credit for my fame
I'm here to make it clear, '86 is my year
I'm the rapper you should fear and I'll have to peer
Supreme MC Chief, and when I die in my belief
Battle from L.A. to Rome, rock beyond the Thunderdome
Sound hard, know why? It is, don't try
Only the top MCs will master this ability
If you do, you'll find out what that misword 
Or run that other , for high speed poetry
Take advice from Ice-T, leave the cuts to Evil E
Get a girl, feel the bass, rock her at this funky pace, ah!


I'm dialing M, for murdering fine MC's heads
Showing no remorse, reanimatin' the dead
Kicking dirt in the wombs, turning a wheel in the rap
I'll make you run for the hills with a streak up your back
My rhymes are my pigeons, stock cooler than cold
Boys always convincing, jewelry solid gold
Magnified finesse, a Hollywood address
The perpetrator, cremator, representing the West
Avenge is my best friend, homicide is my life
I write my rhymes in my book with blood on the knife
Never been beaten in life, never planned to beat
Either rocked two days straight before I take a breath
The rhymes, memorize them like inside my head
And anyone who dared bite somehow ends up dead
Got a license to kill, dogs refusing to chill
Uncut violence is my true thrill
I'm a hitman kinda sort of, suckers talk in manure
With co-cold man known tactics, no man can endure
Not to be mistaken, when MCs fakin'
All contracts issued, to Ice-T are taken, with the multitude routes
You have no chance to shout
With the silencer of a ninja, your lights are out
Girls cry to sight, some in Latin fight
For the post positions at my jam each night
The player from L.A., cooler than any Jay!
My name is Ice-T, I make the mafia pay!
Doggin' the wax!

Not bad y'all!
Not bad at all!",https://genius.com/Ice-t-dog-n-the-wax-lyrics
Heartbeat,Power,1988.0,"Once again, my friends, it's time to rock it till the party ends
Rhymin' with timin', while EVIL E lets the record spin
Kickin' it, hittin', rockin', just so dope it's shockin'
Because I be layin' rhymes super sly, 'cause this is do or die
Make it or break it, although most emcees do fake it
I'll say the ICE can't take it, time to microphone bake it
Raise the heatin' level, break out your coal shovel
Pump the temp, I'm sweatin' like a devil
Listen to my heartbeat, it's beatin' like a wild man
But that's natural, cause you know that I am
No punk, no chump, no fool, no toy
Try to get ill and serve you, boy
I'm on a hype tip, this ain't no ego trip
Just rollin' thick as hell, champagne I sip as well
Listen and you'll envision, this rap's metabolism
I think the beat is dope, but it's still your decision
Whether to turn it on, turn it off
Turn it up, make it loud, make it soft
EQ me with new frequencies or
Just rewind me till the tape bleeds
My heartbeat's kickin' like a saturday movie
Some say it's def, some say it's groovy
I say it's fly, you know why?
Because it's spoken by the brother, whose name is spent with the ""I""
The C-E-T., Cold Chillin' rhyme villain on the M-I-C
With raps roarin', I'm never borin', I keep tourin'
My record sales keep soarin' and soarin'
I'll make a million, maybe two
Buy some rides, gold blow the dough on my crew
Wake up the next morning broke as hell
But not for long 'cause my records sell
My heartbeat's kickin' like a gunshot
Why not? That's who I made it for, the hard rocks
Better watch your gold when the posse breaks
Because what they want is what they take
But I'm coolin', I'm never foolin', too busy rulin'
Sucker emcees who need microphone schoolin'
Leave'em dazed, dogged, served and droolin'
By the playin' punk slayin' mac of microphone duelin'
Heartbeat (scratch freestyle)
This conglomeration is just a demonstration
Of rap's penetration to the core of our nation
Some rappers get down with toy commercial sounds
I had my choice, I chose the underground
Like me or hate me, now if you want you can rate me
My beats is by ISLAM, the cut's by the great E
My heartbeat is kickin', it's kickin' louder and louder
It's gettin' deffer and deffer, I'm feelin' prouder and prouder
Not robbin' or killin', just mic illin'
The phone rings, ""WE MADE ANOTHER MILLION""
Break out the 
Dom
 and pop the corks
Catch a flight to New York
Hit the L.Q. watch RED spin, ""IT'S CLOSED""
Brooklyn strikes again
Heartbeat (scratch)
Once again, my friends, it's time to rock it till the party ends
Rhymin' with timin', while EVIL E lets the record spin
Kickin' it, hittin', rockin', just so dope it's shockin'

Hit the Fan,Home Invasion,1993.0,"Yo, what's goin on Ice?
Yo what's up Shawnie Shawn?
Man, just trippin off this girl, man
Girls?
You?
The Iceberg?
Aw man, come on, spill it, man
She was a swinger
Talkin 'bout high post
She was the most
Knew she was fine, dope, fly
She didn't have to try
She brought a eye on my eye in a crowded club
I tried to stare the girl down, but she didn't budge
She moved through the crowd in a straight line
The closer she got, mad thoughts ran through my mind
Yo, what would I say, yo, how would I chill?
My mind drew a blank, the whole scene was ill
She stepped in the light, she was dynamite
Her eyes said, ""I wanna be with you all night
I wanna rub you down, I wanna kiss, caress your soul
Make your body warm and cold
Do everything sexually you ever heard""
And she hadn't said a single word..
I said, ""Damn, what the hell am I gonna do?""
But my eyes said the same things too
I tried to speak, she put a finger across my lips
Followed it with a kiss
She said, ""I want you bad,"" and she moved in next to me
This woman spelled out ecstacy
Said, ""I've seen on the movies and TV
I love your records, but I ain't no groupie
Just wanna love ya, cause you're a real man
And you deserve this lovin like only I can""
I wanted her bad, and I am a man
That night the shit hit the fan

Damn, man
Keep on with it, man
Come on now kick it, man
You gotta kick it right, though
Let me know what's up
She had a 500 S-E-L airtight
Cellular phone, brand-new, it was white on white
As we walked to the car, I couldn't help but recognize
Her small waist and sexy thighs
She had a beach house she owned and a restaurant
Took me in her crib and put Sade on
As the waves hit the rocks in the moonlight
She came up behind me and squeezed me real tight
My mind started to trip, flip, roll, and roam
What about my girl who's at sleep at home?
But before I could lock in on that thought
She broke out with a new men's watch that she had bought
She put it round my wrist, it was a perfect fit
And said in my ear, ""Want you to have it""
Then she unzipped her dress, dropped it to the ground
My mind was totally blown by now
She gazed at me nude in the moonlight
Pumps still on, her body was firm and tight
I looked at her breasts as they glistened and rised
Right before my eyes
And all I could say to myself was, ""Damn..""
The night the shit hit the fan

Man, man, man
I understand...
(The night the shit hit the fan)
Come on now
I feel it
Come on
(The night the shit hit the fan)
Damn, man
It's all that
Shit
Come on, Ice
Kick that shit
Now I'm a player, I been all around the world
Made love to many girls
But tonight this was the big league
And I was worryin about fatigue
I wanna do this girl, so she won't forget me
And I knew that she'd let me
She moved close and took my shirt off
She said my skin was soft
Then slipped her hand
Between my stomach and my waist band
Man, I couldn't take it no more
Fuck the bedroom, we use the kitchen floor
We hit skins all weekend
We didn't even eat, we just hit em again
I love to think about how it went down
But she's no longer around
Left town with some fly guy
She's on some island drinkin D'Acqueray's and Mai Thai's
But she gave me the keys to the beach house
She knows what I'm about, at least now she figured out
I ain't nothin but a straight up man
And I might need those keys the next time the shit hits the fan
Yeah
Uh!
Yeah
Uh..
Yeah
Uh
I want her

Damn
All that, all that
And after all that
You know?
You always know, man
In the long run
You meet another one like the other one",https://genius.com/Ice-t-hit-the-fan-lyrics

Representin for my real niggas out there
Fuck all you buster-ass niggas
Word

Saturday night in L.A., time to play
My beepers hummin like a vibrator, gotta make crime pay
I'm packin two gats and I wish I could carry more
Might sound crazy, but I ran out of slugs before
Yeah, I know the feds watch me
But my vest clashes hard with the Versace
So I'm just rollin in the black five hun'
I used to lowride, now it's just for fun
I had 5 cars, but now I got one
Hard to keep up ballin when you're on the run
I got two ki's in my trunk and a shovel
Stepped on the one, so now I gots double
The shovel's for drama, need I say more?
Got the fat stash spot under my passenger floor
That's for the other strap, the automatic type
I gotta keep it close in case shit gets hype
Got a bitch in jail, she didn't snitch, she did three
I'mma have to roll solo till they set her free
Cause I got some other crimeys down, true gees
But they got all day, so now it's just me
And I'mma kick this slang until the day I die
I can't go straight, I won't even try
I'm stuck in the game, so don't ask me why
It's life in L.A
I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
Long Beach and Compton are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where the shit goes down

Now niggas like they credit and they like to get they loans on
So I hooked up with my boy who turns them phones on
He told me bout this nigga who won't pay
He also said he knew excactly where the muthafucka stay
So I went and got some homies I hang with
Some crazy muthafuckas who I used to bang with
We took a trip to his crib
I snatched his ho and his kids, and this is what we did
I tied they punk ass up
I cracked the safe with an axe, and then the phones we cut
I didn't hurt his wife
But I promised next time that I would take her life
I shot a nigga in his neck for disrespect, caught a body
Got a murder in Miami for a shoot-out at a party
Got blood in my trunk from a punk who squealed
Had a partner tried to play me and his cap I peeled
Now I rest with my finger on my heater
Hand on my beeper, a light sleeper
I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
New York and Philly are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where my shit goes down
I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
Frisco and Oakland are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where my shit goes down

I use to sling enough water you could float a boat
You could ski on the mountains of fuckin coke
But now most niggas serve chronic
So I let em check the bank, and then I'm all up on it
I serve em with a cute ho
In a week they tell my bitches 'bout all they dough
Then I jack and I kill
The jack's for the money, the kill's for thrills
I got 9'000 blacks that still serve crack
Got a bitch who works the Plaza too on the track
Got a GTA connection and I fence for jewels
Got some little kids that move my fuckin dope in schools
Got warrants for arrest in about 20 states
Got a bigger body count than fuckin Norman Bates
I'm a killer, jacker, dealer, pimp supreme
I'm livin out the hustler dream
I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
Houston and Atlanta are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where that shit goes down

Tonight I gotta meet this nigga from around the way
Some think he's cool, I think he's DEA
He said he want it bad, he heard that I got it good
I bagged up ten ki's of flour and met him in the hood
I met him at my spot, cause I know it's cool
Pat him down on sight to remove his tool
I made him name 10 niggas he should know
But that still ain't shit in the game of blow
He asked to see the dope, I asked to see the cash
He reached for that briefcase too fast
A fuckin pig, yo, he thought he had the jump
I had my nigga in the closet with a bull pump
And now there's fuckin shot-up body all on the floor
But that's what the shovel's for...
I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
Newark and Miami are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where my shit goes down
I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
Detroit and Chicago are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where that shit goes down
I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
D.C. and Cleveland are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where the shit goes down

Pimp baby, you can see my wrists with the lights out

Godfather baby, only play to my rogues
Step back, hater make a little room for my hoes
Gators on my feet, take a look at my toes
Money is the reason all the real players know that
Godfather lays punks to rest
He got no chance up against the best

Valuable Game,The Seventh Deadly Sin,1999,"(Intro: Ice-T)
This song is dedicated to my man 2Pac Shakur, rest in peace!!
Notorious B.I.G., rest in peace!!
And all my other homies that have died
In the madness called street life
Rest in peace!!
(Chorus)
I'mma straight up G, let's not pretend
Dedicated to, all of my friends
On the East and the West Coast
Gotta let this drama go
(Ice-T)
Nineteen eighty six, deep in the mix
Me and my team out for cream and jewel-liks
The faster, the better, blood, leather, the baby sledge
Case hitters - me, I'm the point man
Give less than a damn about anything, just let my hammer swing
Come up, give me my cut - what?
Girls don't mean nothin' to me, don't push the button on me
Out for the twist, ya nastically nasty G
Basically makin' me anti-social individual, too hype
Recognize the type?
Then a music called hip-hop came along and saved my life
I had a story to tell about my knowledge of hell
$2.50 for a book, listen and look, now let's do some Math
A gun and a hand, plus an angry man, minus love
Equals and me, the sky's blue and they rags
Toe-tags and body bags - y'all feel me?
Is it too real G? Brothers say drop some heat T
Absoultely, everything's goochie since we realized
This games' the only one we got left
Hip-hop's become the game of death
Some of y'all busters out there tryin' to waste up
It would've took some of us hustlers all this time to lace up
(Chorus)
I'mma straight up G, let's not pretend
Dedicated to, all of my friends
On the East and the West Coast
Gotta let this drama go
(Ice-T)
Ok, let me break it down, they got the one strike law
You go in, you reach the other two before you know
What happen to you - game's over dude
On the next page, they got power in effect
While you two rednecks waitin' to see which one of us
Kills the next brother next
Think about it too long'll make you sick
Believe me the last thing they wanna see is us risin'
Economically, astronomically it could happen homie - follow me
Hip-hop's the black goal - mind and soul
Refined as we roll, another ghetto story is told
I stopped flippin' ki's in eighty three
They need a time machine to carcerate me
I'm square as a pool table, twice as green, know what I mean?
Flippin' from heat, the legal green, the hip-hop scene
Beef, the only beef I got is the steak
I'm tryin' to eat from the players elite
East, West, North, South, Moon, Star
I'm gonna ball wherever the chips are
I hope y'all players listen, ain't out there hatin' and dissin'
Y'all know the game is to be sold and not told
I should be takin' a collection, this time I'll make an exception
I've just been here for the start of this
I gotta come from the heart for this
(Chorus)
I'mma straight up G, let's not pretend
Dedicated to, all of my friends
On the East and the West Coast
Gotta let this drama go
(Ice-T)
Some nights I lay awake tryin' to analyse
And anticipate the moves of the fakes
Wonder if the cancers' in too deep - can't sleep
Tryin' to diagnose the poison that's increased
Injected into a pure hustle born on city streak
Migranes fill my brain as I reach toward the realm of the insane
Wishin' and prayin' that another brother gets
To live the life that I got to play in
Tryin' to represent to the fullest
I gotta come hard y'all, no time to pull it
Y'all fools think illin' and tearin' up
Hip-hop is the thing to do G?
I'm paid I don't need rap no more fool I make a movie
Y'all tryin' to lose me
And to y'all suckers with your afrobatic, player hatin' tatics
Tryin' to jump over the bree and plannin' and hustlin'
I've been corporatin' to this music over these years
Y'all will fall victim to your own lies and the P.I
Will continue to rise, over your eyes kid
This games' immaculate, dramas' irrelevant - stay sucker reppellin'
Invent, incoporate, parlay, play
And I got no reason to lie to you
(Chorus)
I'mma straight up G, let's not pretend
Dedicated to, all of my friends
On the East and the West Coast
Gotta let this drama go
I'mma straight up G, let's not pretend
Dedicated to, all of my friends
On the East and the West Coast
Gotta let this drama go

Code of the streets,Gangsta Rap,2006.0,"Yeah, IceBerg nigga, 2006, SMG bitch
Niggas out here got nerve to tell me keep it real
Faggot ass motherfuckers have no motherfucking.. reference point to real
Thorough niggas know, there's rules to this shit

Original gangster, I respect the laws
Of the crimes lords and the gangster wars
My only religion, is the code of the streets
We never use cops, we just handle our bleat
The penalty precision is an infant death
Never disrespect or betray your set
Love and loyalty is the ultimate goal
To the Code of the Streets, I hear my pledge in my soul

When I was nineteen, I learned the game unpolitely
Niggas threw me on the back of the 'llac, told me to shut up
Put me in the crack spot, made me chop rocks
Put me on the streets, taught me how to lock blocks
Told me never snitch, never trust man or bitch
Rock revolvers, never trust gats with clips
Speak in low tones, even when you think you're alone
Cause phones will get you sent upstate, cause feds rotate
And all that close talking, talk about birds and cake
They talk it better than you, so advice your crew
And any body new, watch him with profiles
Cause the D-E-A is crafty and those sending spies


Feds get gangster, hard niggas tell
Bitches get jealous and they send you to hell
Your best friend is a rat, I can tell by the smell
You'll get cracked for the gat, they can tell by the shell
Truth is, most of these bitches, is harder than men
Fact is, most of these gangsters, turn gay in the pen
And if I let you rob me once, you'll probably rob me again
That's why some niggas lives must end
They tell, you keep your friends closer, I keep them closer than most
My enemies can do whatever, I'ma pose with a toss
Live your life low and simply you should be like a ghost
When you get a legal paper, it ain't too smart to boast, nigga


Yeah, niggas out there talking about how real it is
Niggas got this shit twisted
Niggas is snitching like motherfucking bitches
Niggas got this shit all fucked up
Nowadays, you niggas analyzing the shot not the shooter
Got a gold simi, choose the Glock not the rooga
Don't leave your conversations on your Goddamn computor
Listen to me close, it might extend your life
Don't trust all your homies, some of them'll bend your wife
Cause there's two games, one that respects the laws
And one that's straight scandalous and listed across
If you're fucking with the second one, you'll end for a loss
They play another game, blast, kill, collect the cash
No running when they're gunning and they don't wear masks
The middle niggas mobbing, just trying to eat
They don't give a fuck about the code of the streets (COME ON!!)",https://genius.com/Ice-t-code-of-the-streets-lyrics
Ed,O.G. Original Gangster,1991,"Let me tell ya a little story
Bout my homeboy Ed
Use to drink every day
Straight 40's to the head
You try to snap on him
He'd ask what you said
You still try to break
He'd start given up lead
Love to gamble
On one knee he stayed
Tryin' to hit seven
On  he played
Worked tees and weights
So he always got paid
Blew on the hoes
Every dollar he made
Crazy friends, crazy friends he had
Superfly drobe, super dope pad
Cars for your ass
And I'm talkin'  about class
Benz's and better
With his name on the dash
One night he got drunk
And started drivin' real fast...
Ed's dead",https://genius.com/Ice-t-ed-lyrics
The 5th,VI - Return of the Real,1996,"He yo, Ice
This guy here say he wants to get in, man
You're sure homeboy's ready?
Yo Ice, this nigga said he's ready, man
Yo, kid you're sure you wanna be down with this, right?
Yeah, I'm sure, I'm ready
Aight
Know what you're in for, right?

Blood flows like sands in the hourglass
Cash moves everything
Bitches in g strings
Gats flashin, mothers make cream on a stick move
Improve your dope flow
Cold max with the long dough
High rollin, back breakin plot diggers
The ill niggas
Comanche style
Blood letting weapons of death
Stop your breath
If you trip on the click
A hot thump to your chest
And your back just rips
You wanna be a made man
The fam accepts no mistakes
Chopped up bodies, lots of funeral wakes
Make your bones
Bring a rat back dead just ahead
A cop's better
Use this beretta
Snitch, bet your bitch
She in a pre-dug ditch
Cause I command a whole batallion of life takers
Plus the other bosses wanna see yo guts
Check your nuts
Dump the bodies in the desert
Here's the keys to a truck
Me, I'm overloaded, born hard and scarred
Crime intellect
More complex than nerves in your spinal chord
Bank job my forte
Not off of gunplay
Hostage taker
I killed my brother with a salt shaker
He tried to short me a buck
What the fuck?
A nigga that lies
Is a nigga that dies
No cries for the punk
He got trunked and bombed
Since he tried to steal I chainsawed his arm
I drink blood from a cup when I wanna then
Plus the bosses up north made me kill my friend
They told me, ""This ain't no game, kid, you're in it
You're down with the Syndicate, but never admit it""

Muthafucka, now you're down for life
Rat on the fam and we'll kill your wife
Fuck up a scam and you'll feel the knife
Who is this?
(The Syndicate does not exist)

A thousand ki's, off-shore private yacht
Really ain't no sweat, Coast Guard and customs are bought
Columbian-Mexicano connect
Raise the bet
One DEA woudn't roll, we pulled his tongue through his neck
Just a message to the rest: don't test
Housing developments are built on the bodies
Of punks who wouldn't party
Big shots are called from the pen's inner sanctum
Where the mega-gees
Regulate the streets, fuck release
They got power that you can't comprehend, my friend
They want you dead, yo, you're dead before the daylight ends
Your eyes shiver and you grit your teeth
You sold your soul, now cold blood's how you get relief
Now you do what we do, say what I say
Muthafucka, don't blink unless I say okay
This is a organization, not a one-man gang
And you die if I ever hear you spilled my name

My friend, I thought this day would never come
(What do you mean, man? Hey!)
Who was there when your wife had your first child?
(Hey, why you're lookin at me like that, man?)
Who looked out for you when no one else was there?
(Hey, I'm your friend, man!)
Now word's out you're talkin to the feds about me
(..they lyin, man)
There's only one thing I can do
(Hey man, wait a -)
You treat me like a bitch
(Hey yo - )
( *shots* )
Now look at you!
Look at you, muthafucka!
Now look at you!

Cops on the take, I got moves to make
Feds ain't that easy, I still got em to shake
They had my man's bitch wired for a month and a half
Snatched my nigga up in Aspen, bail's five million
Bounced him out in a hour - power
Went and met him quick, hit him with a ice pick
Can't take no chances, he romancin with whores
No tellin what he spilled when behind closed doors
The fam's protection and loyalty is top priority
Violate, your body is found in three states
Cargo is heat on a Hong Kong cruiser
??? contact ???
No cash, they want a ton of crystal meth
High risk'll bring more riches than the national debt
We launder money through he s&l's and pro-ball teams
Ain't no business untouched when it comes to cream
Documents forged from my hitters from Jamaica
In and out of town before you hit the ground
This is the mob, baby, now you're on, no off-switch
Suffocation ??? you snitch",https://genius.com/Ice-t-the-5th-lyrics

The last standin' man, smack you with my backhand

You can slide by me with the rest of them damn snakes
Flakin' like paper while I'm takin' my life serious
You talkin' and playin', your whole antenna's mystevious
Claimin' that you got juice with an ultimate ???
But when the brother test you, murder and recieved no types of love
You think you got game, with that favour to your brain?
FUCK YA NAME!!! Stompin' the rut got yourself to blame
I represent Castor - bring it to you live
But cool and civilized, despise a nigga's livin' lies
No alibi's I see the weakness in your eyes dun
You wanna run? Plus ya scared to shoot a gun for fun
You bust a couple of slugs off the rooftop
My team, come and touch ya somethin', make ya crew drop

God Forgive Me,The Seventh Deadly Sin,1999,"""In the year 1982 a music was created. It was given the title: Gangsta Rap
It had no positive messages, no redeeming value, hated and feared
By the establishment, it changed the course of the world""
(SLEJ)
Ride as my jabos, cocked my straps watcha back
You know where you at? You in urban combat
So stay alert, use the attack of the tactical expert
Puttin in work, and leavin your troops with wet shirts
Your casuality rate is high, I'm closin in
Prepare for your ultimate end, tell your family bye
Better cool like Egon, and shine like veegon
Pissin on your beons, for decades and eons
You squad has no muscle plus you, my new hustle
Fuck scuffin up my knuckles, rather buck you and watch you buckle
I can't stand a snitch, a switch real bitch
I got some transcripts to say you been runnin ya lips
Now its on, on site, if I see you I'mma sin ya
If I catch you in traffic I'mma gift ya somethin in ya
Letcha battle with death for the prize of life
I learned ta never come empty handed to a gun fight
My advesaries feel fright, his last sight
Was a flash of light, you said lightning could strike
From the same place twice, I have your head on my death
1500, tonights your last night gettin blunted
""The voices could not be stopped, it began to morph
And reinvent themself, I grew like a black blade
Moving like a tornado from the west to the east coast
Leaving behind a path of destruction and mayhem""
(Laquan)
Thick's ice fix ghosts infrared no remorse
And low from the exchange, psycho derranged
Playa lay no feel pain, killa cocka-main
I'm top framin the game, use muscle for the hustle
I zip duffle bags to muffle fags
Scuffle my knuckles bad on niggas that think that they runnin shit
They feel the punishment, uh, blood bath, the wrath
Aftermath, at least the guns in shit
Too under fallin charum leads to send up on the earth
Mix things with daughters with men
Since poured from birth the worth for the others
Go to war with my brothers
I'm unstable like Kane did to Abel
I'm out the stable sinnin from the beginnin
Leavin daddy's little girl pretty linen bloody red
What's said in the book of dead is now all forgotten
My soul's rotten, still the blood's spilled I feel
Chills, I'm still plottin, I'm ill-norm
Take life forms like light storms I laugh at the wrath
Of the guys comin on, visions of the antichrist is risen
The question is now, am I unforgiven?
""Legends tells that the creator of this poison's name was Ice
Although, others have told different stories, no matter
Who or what invented the monster, their souls would be forever
Damned to Hell""
(Ice T)
Enter the death chambre, cash richer, leave ya nutless
Cutless with the raw scope, double ya dope
Feel my back lash, body cash your whole fam and media
Greedy shit, tag ya out the rag Jag, speedy shit
Look in the sky, the four horsemen bustin no discussion
No stoppin its apocalypse, lock and load ya clips
Gonna be rich and dead, copa said don't matter cats scatter
Suckas get touched, niggas get rushed
Watch em transform into animal form, wicked Hell-born
Lord of the Flies, cry and ya die
Mechanama come masses soul snatcher, fallen angel
All angles covered for you fuckin God lovers
Possession, good suggestion run cuddle your funds
Double your guns, watch your kids grow, stay out my flow
Be wise, the magnificence, evidence, decadence mind
Seven sins, the abomination, I'm
That nigga, last nigga, street mack
Hot is my strap, wet is your back
Understand I never forgive, leavin bodies like seive
Clap gats til my fuckin shit's clipless
Niggas bear witness

From the east, west, north, and south, gangsta rap is now
Alive, God forgive me, God forgive me""",https://genius.com/Ice-t-god-forgive-me-lyrics
Rap Games Hijacked,VI - Return of the Real,1996,"Yeah
Too many hardcore muthafuckas out here in this business
Ain't gettin their proper loot
You know what I'm sayin?
(Right)
Check the technique
(Aha)

Everybody talkin 'bout the way hip-hop ain't the same
Suckers kidnapped the game
I know the biggest in the business, and no joke
Half of em broke - and none of em smoke
(Bust the facts, loc)
I got into this hip-hop game
Just to try to get a girl and get some light-weight fame
There'd never been no cash made in it
So who thought you could get paid with it?
Just crash the club with my crew and then I'm outta there
Hit some skins, act bugged, that was a rap career
Then Run-D.M.C. jumped the fuck off
Got mad paid, word, kicked the bucks off
There wasn't many rappers out there rockin the streets
When hip-hop was just cuts and beats
I seen _Wildstyle_, dug the scene
I wanna be an MC, rock, rock on - know what I mean?
I started crashin rap contests
Shootin hardcore rhymes through wack MC's chests
I signed on the lines of a wack contract
Didn't even read it, fuck that
They gonna put my record out
I'm gonna be large, know what I'm talkin about?
In the first 2 years I made about 300 bucks
Yo, this business sucks
But I got another chance and I came correct
Got a lawyer and accountant, now my shit's legit
But many won't get no second chance
And get fucked in this biz without a kiss or a dance
The game is to exploit young ghetto kids
A straight pimp game, and there ain't no shame
And the shit's gone too far
100 hip-hop labels with all white A&R's
The game's hijacked
The rap game's hijacked
Let me tell you how it happened

Now while every MC in the game
Was worryin about a white boy gettin the fame
They dug out the foundation
Now let me give a demonstration
Say you got a dope group from the hood
Talkin mad shit like they're up to no good
You take em to a label
Now who sits behind the table?
Some jewish muthafucka that don't know shit
Tryin to tell y'all what's a fuckin street hit
The shit's way off course
It's like me tellin Johnny Cash how to sing about his horse
You go on tour, the white agency says you're wild
Tone down your style
The radio jocks are all pop
So how the fuck this nigga know what shit to rock?
The shit that make your face turn green
Is when you get dissed by a kidnap magazine
I give a fuck about these muthafuckas
I'm doin this jam to save my hip-hop brothers
Get your paperwork straight, kid
Get a lawyer and accountant just like I did
Don't blow your dough, cause you will see g's
But this game has no guarantees
Learn about publishing points, so you won't be blind
Learn to read everything you sign
Then you might have a chance
If not, bend over, pull down your pants
The game's hijacked
(Yeah
I don't they hear you, brother)
Yo, the rap game's hijacked
(Word)
I'm talkin 'bout a hijack
(Say it one more time, baby)
The rap game's hijacked
Check it
(Break it down for these niggas)

You can go gold and still owe the record label cash
Yo kid, check the math
Learn about the word 'recoup', troop
And stop walkin round all hyped and souped
You ain't nothin but somethin to be used and worked
You ain't nothin but a sucker to be duped and jerked
Cause the fuckin record label don't love ya, pal
They didn't love ya on the street and don't love ya now
They're out to make an end, friend
Cause every dollar you make, they damn near make 10
They'll take you for everything you got
Or else they'll sign you and they put on the shelf to rot
I'm tryin to tell you what's up
You best to listen to this record even if you hate my fucking guts
Cause I just can't stand around and watch rap get done
And my brothers ain't gettin none
A nigga like me has gotta spit game
Nigga, get that cash flow. fuck that muthafuckin fame
Cause the white man's rippin us off once again
Real hip-hop, my man
Fool, the rap game's hijacked
You need to listen, nigga
The rap game's hijacked
Need to play this record about ten times
The rap game's hijacked
Black people don't own shit
The rap game's hijacked
Check it
R&B's hijacked
Black acting is hijacked
Just being black is hijacked
(Build, my nigga, build, my nigga)
Nigga
Stupid muthafuckas, they rippin us off
You better get a end..
While the money's there, boy
Silly-ass bitch runnin around with a gold chain
All niggas gotta get some real estate
Muthafucka
Come up
Fuck a bitch
Better get somethin you can own, asshole
White man ain't givin up shit
Word o' life
Although I got a white engineer
But he's gettin minimum wage

Killers,The Classic Collection,UnKnown,"A man took an ad on T.V
To enroll in the police academy
He's very talented, outstanding proof
From his clean-cut apperance to the shine on his boots
When it comes to graduation, he's number one
An expert with a rifle and also a gun
Three weeks on the beat and his weak nerves crack
And fires four warning shots into a kid's back
Killers! These are the killers
Killers! The coldhearted killers
Killers! Bloodthirsty killers
Killers! Beware of the killers
A young girl marries an older man
With more money than you can understand
He smothers her with pearls and jewelry
And they both seemed as happy as they could be
But three months later, she's sad but content
Seems he had an unexpected accident
The girl said he would be hard to forget
As the papers interviewed her while she flew his jet
Killers! These are the killers
Killers! She was the killer
Killers! The coldhearted killers
Killers! Beware of the killers
It's time for all to work together for peace
'Cause everybody's doomed if the killings don't cease
Street homicide, war, it's all the same
'Cause murder is murder by any name
An young man loses his only job
Too proud to hustle, too honest to rob
He goes to tell his family and his wife
But an argument breaks out, she grabs a knife
Tempers escalate to a total rage
Shots burst out from a loaded twelve-gauge
They call it mass murder, suicide
But somebody tell me why the kids had to die
Killers! these are the killers
Killers! the coldhearted killers
Killers! bloodthirsty killers
Killers! beware of the killers
Vietnam vet, home from the war
Can't get a job in a candy store
Unemployment hurts and he's living proof
So to take out his frustration, he climbs on the roof
He shows no pity as victims are shot
The only thing to stop him are the bullets from SWAT
Ten people died on a sunny day
But tell me who taught him how to shoot that way?
Killers! These are the killers
Killers! You know the killers
Killers! Beware of the killers
Killers! Are you a killer?
It's time for all to work together for peace
'Cause everybody's doomed if the killings don't cease
Street homicide, war, it's all the same
'Cause murder is murder by any name
A known criminal is sentenced to death
Now the legal system controls his last breath
He tries to fight execution with petitions and pleas
And a pardon from the governor is all he needs
He cries out for mercy but nothing's spared
And on his day of termination, he's strapped in a chair
High voltage fills his body in a house-like jail
And all of the people of vengeance grail
Are you a killer? a cold-hearted killer
A killer! a bloodthirsty killer
A killer! a merciless killer
A killer! a killer!  A killer!
Georgie-Porgie-Pudding-and-pie
Couldn't get a girl, let me tell you all why
He tried to be down like all the rest
Had curls in his hair, gold on his chest
He rolled around town in a Coup-de-ville
But he had no money, he was broke as hell
Ladies love money and he needed more
So he tried to steal something out a liquor store
But before Georgie-Porgie could get away
The man pulled out his gun and blew him away
He was a killer! A coldhearted killer
A killer! Are you a killer?
A killer! A merciless killer
A killer! Beware of the killers
It's time for all to work together for peace
'Cause everybody's doomed if the killings don't cease
Street homicide, war, it's all the same
'Cause murder is murder by any name
Politicians plot for power each and every day
We are all just puppets in the games they play
They manipulate the message to attain their goals
And for simple re-election they will sell their souls
Nuclear supremacy is the ultimate thrill
So our tax we pay is paid for overkill
B-1 bombers, super weapons, rockets in the sky
While we all pray to God the missiles never fly
Killers! These are the killers
Killers! They are the killers
Killers! Are you a killer?
Killers! Don't be a killer
It's time for all to work together for peace
'Cause everybody's doomed if the killings don't cease
Street homicide, war, it's all the same
'Cause murder is murder by any name",https://genius.com/Ice-t-killers-lyrics

Grand Larceny,Power,1988.0,"Stick up, hands in the air
You move, you lose 'cause the Ice don't care
No chance to run, don't shout
Flinch an inch I'm gonna take you out
Grand Larcenist, soloist, felonist, vocalist
Crime's my rhyme, but here's a new twist
I ain't here for your gold, bro
All I want is the show
This is Grand Larceny
This is Grand Larceny (x3)
I lay low for a show, and then I go
Steal the motherfucker, then we count the dough
It's kinda like robbin', but it's legally done
And nowadays if it ain't legal I don't fuck around
I get a thrills when I ill and a jam is filled
With 10.000 screamin' people, now that's the pill
Who's gonna dog the set? The Ice will
And once I'm in effect it's overkill
Kinda like a hold-up, all the tickets sold up
And then the black stretch limo cold rolls up
And then the posse breaks, high off the Cold Duck
And then I set the mic to show destruct
Even if we open up, that don't mean nothing
I rock the rhymes, E does the cuttin'
Call it show-nappin', I take a hostage at night
Do shit and break out on the next flight
This is Grand Larceny
Grand Larceny
I'm a kleptomaniac when a jam is packed
You can fight all night, but you'll still get jacked
By the show stealer, crime rhyme dealer
Rap kingpin, L.A. big-wheeler
Got a posse so strong they could lift a tank, rob a bank
But now we steal shows, the cops say thanks
Breathe easy 'cause the Syndicate deep
Before we start rappin'
They got no sleep
This is Grand Larceny
Grand Larceny
Just give me a beat, give me a stage to stand on
I know that none y'all ever planned on
A dude from L.A. who could rock shit this way
Have his record go gold, with no radio play
But it happened, the Ice is rappin'
Just listen to my fans that are clappin'
Or come to my show.sit in the front row
And watch me steal the motherfucker before your ass can say ""ho""
I'm like a time bomb, but I'm a rhyme bomb
Spray the whole audience with napalm
Or something just as hot, I'll bust a rhyme, why not?
Rap hittin' so hard, you'll think you shot
I'll take a show and abduct it
Stone cold house it, and if it gets wild
With gasoline I'll douse it
Set it ablaze, and then I'll stomp it out
Many burnt emcees know what I'm talkin' about
This is Grand Larceny
Promoters on my tail now
Cause they billed me low
Here I am 'bout to steal another show
So they turn my mic down
Fuck up my audio sound
But too late, we just dogged another town
Rappin' like a Mac 10, as soon as I begin
The only way to stop the stealin' is throwin me in the pen
But that will never happen 'cause I'm just cool rappin'
My Larceny is legal, so sorry Captain
I would never steal a style or would ever steal a rap
But I'll steal a show in a minute, it's as simple as that
An interstate crook, my pistol's my rhyme book
Any show that I'm on is a show that's took
Better watch my left hook, or your jaw will get shook
If my posse gets mad, it's best you book
From the Grand Larcenist, Ice-T is my name
Got a rap like a mac, and a game the same
This is Grand Larceny (x3)",https://genius.com/Ice-t-grand-larceny-lyrics
Intro (Rhyme Pays),UnKnown,UnKnown,"A child was born in the east one day
Moved to the west coast after his parents passed away
Never understood his fascination with rhymes or beats
In poetry, he was considered elite
Became a young gangster in the streets of L. A
Lost connections with his true roots far away
But no matter the job or crime
He never lost his hardcore obsession to rhyme
New Yorks hip hop movement broke loose
D. J's cut records, raps had the juice
Since busting rhymes was his natural thing
He was crowned the west coast M. C. King
But after his inauguration there was a rush
Of wack rappers with one intention to crush
This master rapper and take his throne
A simple job, he had no crew, he stood all alone
Assassins came in groups of one through five
With raps no mortal M. C. Could survive
But he shoved no mercy, he rapped blood thirsty
Battlin' from Friday on through to Thursday
Never losing a bout, never ending in doubt
Every confrontation K. O. Knock out!
On his never ending journey to the T-O-P
The L. A player, M. C. Ice-T",https://genius.com/Ice-t-intro-rhyme-pays-lyrics
Watch the Ice Break,Home Invasion,1993.0,"It's goin down
From the Ammo Dump
I got my nigga SLJ and DJ Aladdin
Droppin the fat tracks
Hit em with it
Syndicate's in the muthafuckin house
All duck MC's get flat, muthfuckas
Yeah
1993
And it's still me
A rappin brother from L.A., the cool T
Diss a brother, hate a brother, I still come back
With the fat tracks, fuck the pop crap
I got a mind to cold diss a fool
Wack rappers sellin out urge me to pull tools
For no reason
Pop suckers hookin for hits like hoes skeezin
Prostitutes that can't shoot, yet you clock loot
Dancesteps with the weak styles, but you look cute
Bitch, that shit's wack
Let Hammer dance, and you other fools ease back
The microphone in some twist in a clenched fist
Mind locked on ???? load of my hit list
And make duck rappers pray
Many talk shit, but none step this way
Cause I'm quick to beat down a weak clown
Clock crazy juice from L.A. to the Boogie Down
I play the whole map
Got hoes locked like a muthafuckin bear trap
Ice muthafuckin T
Before hoes gee they need two forms of I.D
Never fess, not the best, but I'm hard to shake
Huh, watch the Ice break
Watch the Ice break
Yo, let's see now who's tryin to diss me
Say I sold out cause I rocked with the B.C
Y'all are bitches, you're straight wack
Quick to talk shit, but always behind the back
I do whatever I wanna do, punk ho
I rock a perm, you rock an afro
I wear khakis, while y'all wear silk
Y'all drink forties, and I drink milk
Cause that's my muthafuckin biz
I never sell out, cause it's no sale, kid
Hardcore to my heart from the fuckin start
Whether done over beats or loud guitars
I drop the dope hits
Case you forgot, I invented this gangsta shit
You wanna step to me? New jack, walk
Come back in five LP's, then we can talk
You're just new, kid, you got a hit out
In interviews you talk a lotta shit out
You got paid, you really made out
You went broke when your one jam played out
Now you're searchin for that one more hit
Shhhiiit
I ain't new to this, I got gangs of gold
I come original, then I break the mold
Too many MC's hit, then fold
They're just fakes
Hah, watch the Ice break
Watch the Ice break
Yeah
Syndicate jumpin off 1993
On some old fly smooth shit
All the muthfuckas out there down with us
You know what I'm sayin?
We're rollin strong
All the busters out there that got some static to say
We're settin this shit off physically this year
Like KRS-One says:
Sucker MC's duck down
Muthafuckas ain't takin no shit
I'm swingin on busters, point-blank
Diss me and it's on
Straight up
Now it's the break of dawn
And the mic is still on
All hoes are fuckin and the rhymes are damn strong
Many MC's that choke from the mic smoke
Those who tried to get with me
Lost in rhyme infinity
Or they lost breath
Try to step to the Ice equals sure death
Cause ??it's then I begin?? than you ever assume
Drop the mic, go rap in your living room
I love the quick kill
Swing on a nigga sometimes just to break ill
Knuckle up, buster, fool, in his fuckin eye
All hands, I need no gun, yo punk, why?
Cause if I pull my gun, you die
No second try
I gotta cool out now, so I don't over-freeze
Nut up and start murderin MC's
Start catchin bodies from state to state
Throw on a ski mask and walk the streets late
And do me up a whole damn crew
The Geto Boys was trippin, but my mind's trickin me too
Cause diss me, and I meet you one day
And bet your life it won't be a fun day
I hope, nigga, it's not your fate
That you're around when the Ice breaks
When the Ice breaks",https://genius.com/Ice-t-watch-the-ice-break-lyrics
Addicted to Danger,Home Invasion,1993.0,"""Yo whats up man? Yeah I gotta trunk fulla this shit
Word, broads still with me man, comin over to grapevine right now
Yo I can't talk right now man, I gotta get off this phone""
Damn, how'd I get into this scam
Roll in a car with the trunk worth 5000 grand
I came up from the curb, word
First thing it rocks, now my ride's packin crazy birds
I gotta freak in the front seat
She got crazy game, might even have more than me
And thats why I don't trust, I ain't no busta
One wrong move and I'll dust her
But she knows that, keeps a gat
Works much plastic, always stays on phat
She said she loves me
Looks deep in my eyes, sometimes cries, all lies
She only loves my cash flow, long dough
The falso love of a pimp and a ho
But me and her gotta job to do
Get this luggage back to the crew
She got scanner, I hadta listen to the pigs talk
And if they speakin about us then its jumpin off
But I ain't sweatin them at all
2 cops'll roll up and 2 cops'll fall
The lines on the highway, I'm makin my mind drift away
To my last jail stay
5 years for a 459
I'm never goin back, no matter what the crime
Surrenderin ain't me
Fuck that, I'm holdin court in the street G
For a nigga like me there ain't no ounce
My life filled with drug busts and shoot outs
Pure ghetto anger, pure ghetto anger
Pure ghetto anger, I'm addicted to danger
Some nights I crash clubs
Rollin with the posse made of well-known thugs
Cool out with the freaks
Truckin much jewels, beggin for beef
Thens some niggas roll up
Lookin for a way to pump the reps up
But I ain't the one
I'm handin out beat downs, no need for guns
Sometimes I gotta ask myself
Is all this buck whylin good for a niggas health?
I don't know why
Am I suicidal, do I wanna die?
The answerin, simple
A headache throbs in my temple
It says it ain't fair, it says it ain't right
It says its goin down tonight
We finally made it to the drop spot
King and Weston Ave, snoody fox
The posse was there, but it ain't right
Fuckin police lights
Its all goin down that road blocks
I never seen that many cops
It was a setup, my whole damn crew's gettin wet up
Big time, some motherfucker dropped a dime
But even in the flurry of gun shots
My adrenaline was boilin hot
I crash down on the floor of the ride
Punch the gas, drove that benz through they punk ass
Hit Vernor doin 90
Looked in the rear-view, no one behind me
I got on the phone
Called up the homies to see what went wrong
But no time to sweat that
I still gotta trunk fulla shit, I was on phat
I just need a cool place to hide
Dumped the benzo, slammed the G ride
Me and a freak hit a motel crash spot
The streets was hot
Rubbed me down, said she adored me
Said the gunfire made her horny
The she pushed me back on the bed
Licked me head to toe, toe to head
Then I closed my eyes real slowly
Is this love? No not me
Then I felt a pain in my chest
The smell of gun powder and burnt flesh
I looked in her face, opened my mouth
And then her badge came out",https://genius.com/Ice-t-addicted-to-danger-lyrics
New Life,Gangsta Rap,2006.0,"* Styled after AZ the Visualizer from the album _Pieces Of A Man_

Yeah, Iceberg, 2006
Been out the game for a minute
You know, just checking it out
To tell you the truth; most of y'all niggas sound real soft, real happy
Everyday niggas ask me for that gangsta shit

It's a new life for me, yeah

Confessions of the ghetto nigga, cursed at birth
I brought the guns to the Rap game, bitches and work
Hit your body with the pump shotie, watch you jerk
L.A. Westside, nigga, now in New York
The berg; nothing gave out the words I say
I'm a grown man, ain't got no fucking time to play
Step on the game once, I recruite and parlay
Slide out it for a minute, step right back in it
Why not?.. y'all niggas don't rap that good
The truth is.. y'all niggas ain't all that hood
You act like gangsters but ain't got the heart to be one
I act so I know the fucking actor when I see one
Too much security, too much crew
Too much hype, nigga, not enough you
Me!?, they call me double O.G

It's a new life for me, yeah
Birds flying high, you know how I feel?
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel?
Reeds drifting on by, you know how I feel?
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me, yeah

See me in the streets or bowling up in the club
Me and Lil' Ice roll like lawn wolf and cub
Don't worry about the clips, nigga, watch my fist
Watch my bitch, watch my new compact disc
Your album is garbage; filled with love songs for pussies and hoes
I keep it gully, nigga, every one knows
It's all the game, til you see the flame filled the pound and
Security is on their toes every club that I'm in
Cause they know I don't give a Goddamn
Never bust techs cause them fucking shits jam
Respect! but I don't respect that much
I like Mobb Deep and Nore' -- some mothers like Shyne
Game from the Westcoast, them niggas can rhyme
Keep it hardcore, keep the shit gully and street
And don't let soft R&B niggas make your beats


Who's the fucking greatest MC and who cares?
Who can fucking shit on my name and who dares?
I straight reinvented this whole fucking game of rappin'
I'm may not be a General, I'm damn sure a Captain
Pull your pants up, nigga, lean back
You're strapped, but ain't got the heart to squeeze that
The rap game's in the ER laying on its fucking back


Confessions of the ghetto nigga, cursed at birth
I brought the guns to the Rap game, bitches and work
Hit your body with the pump shotie, watch you jerk
L.A. Westside, nigga, now in New York
The berg; nothing gave out the words I say
I'm a grown man, ain't got no fucking time to play
Step on the game once, I recruit and parley
Slide out it for a minute, step right back in it",https://genius.com/Ice-t-new-life-lyrics

Youn claim you want beef, it's too tough, called your bluff
Shot you at such close range, blew out your eardrum
Caught you with my mack, blast your cage our your back

Casualty after casualty all up in ya
Ya not a street vet yet bitch, just a beginner
My niggas eat punk like your crew for dinner
Rock ya in broad daylight to make the wrist-double

Step up, feel the Teflon, black talent
Rip through your vest, hit your chest, lose your balance
You never had no drama with the real, now ya want it?
My skill got you haunted, my ski-mask got ???
(Marc Live)
Aiyyo blackout, my whole click we blastout
The wrong move, show improve you assed out
Venom it, warn the niggas, treacherous
Squeeze automatic, quick to bust fuck with us
Yo the worst niggas, work the bitch to double figures
In new sixes, hennessey with dark mixes
The richest, fuck around, you won't fix it
Toke, heavy metal, settle shit, rebel shit
Fuck a cop, why not, we last niggas on your block
Last standin', coked up, we fucked up
Twenty g's, rope 'em up, you in the trunk - Lex Coupe
I'll leave a nigga with cement boots
Now we off lootin', hold me down, yo I'll start shootin'
In ya double lefts and tell the rest an'
Marc Li-ive, fuck the pad, bust his ass
And slide my fuckin' heat in the stash
(Chorus: Marc Live)
Yo, yo, yo motherfuckers can't fuck with this, realness
Seventh sin deadly, raise the key to rock steady
Run son the hour has come, touch ya
Remember this, real niggas don't rhyme
We walk up and buck ya
Stuck ya in the head, rush ya
Trife niggas knife you, seven venoms fight you
Your life's through, fuckin' with the wrong click - kapow!!
From the crackhouse, niggas quick to blow your back out
(Ras Kass)
She musta kicked off like special teams
I walk rare from a muchy bled nigga all lookin' like Grenedine
Murder scene, three to the head, three to the sline
We tied that motherfuckin' number like Kareem
It seems that I used to wonder why niggas don't give a fuck
Within 2G - niggas is just buck
From hip-hoppers to gangsta's, sportin' stompers at yompers
The mirror has two faces in this room is not proper
So we religiously pray for peace and pack one
I walk softly, carry a big dick
These family jewels is my most important riches
But I still want my liquor, my sorry-ass friends and my bitch
And nigga this me, I only see green like a Marine
Support Calvin Klein jeans, fed a bitch from the Phillipines
With a immoral nose ring (masterbatin' with a magazine!!)
Yeah, I'm acid 9 and half the time undercover
Fuck you, your lesbain lover and your mother with the same brother
The blade runner, my games' tight
I could talk the Virgin Mary outta panties the same night
(Castrophe)
And that's the seventh deadly sin as the terror begins
Me and my friends came to rob ya for your props and your ends
Tuck it in, my niggas want, whatever's costin'
The rings plus the watch, plus thst chain from the slossin'
Son, that's why I go in and shit stop
Last night my nigga Ice-T had to pop a cop
I write the chop-chop lyrics, tryin' not to scratch the detail
I put 'em through the system, slang 'em out at full retail
It's thirty g's for the title and the ki's
Throw in the extra three and take the tyres and the D's
Nigga please, this is lik-wit and I'm the Alki
At three months from now you're gonna read all about me
One cause I smoke 'em, two cause I'm wealthy
Three because I rapped on my nigga Ice's LP
It's Castrophe, lik-wit fam, lik-wit crew
West Coast is in the house nigga, what you wanna do?
(Chorus: Marc Live)
Yo, yo, yo motherfuckers can't fuck with this, realness
Seventh sin deadly, raise the key to rock steady
Run son the hour has come, touch ya
Remember this, real niggas don't rhyme
We walk up and buck ya
Stuck ya in the head, rush ya
Trife niggas knife you, seven venoms fight you
Your life's through, fuckin' with the wrong click - kapow!!
From the crackhouse, niggas quick to blow your back out

Chorus:
I represent from LA
All the way to (NY NY)
And when I get down
I get down here in LA
All the way to (NY NY)
And when I parley
I parley here in LA
All the way to (NY NY)
Touched the Iceberg baby
I'll send you under like the Titanic
Gun fight romantic
Gigantic on the pages
Of the hustler trade
World reknown for my realness
Only the real will feel this
Stainless steel is
The straps that I'm copulating
Touch'em a lady (?)
Blow your hand off
African stand-off
The general
Ice the hardest mineral
Feel me, a gem correct
One thing that I got you'll never get's respect
I stick the pits on ya
I represent California
Home of the shooters
The looters
The drug movers
Girl barracuda
Set you up for the kill
Where you're really not ballin unless you got 10 mill
I shine so bright I blind ya
Cross my crew, we'll find ya
It's a motherfuckin shame
My dominance to this game
I live for gun smoke aroma
Mack yo' bitch into a coma
Two hoes like Noah of every type
Bitches I kick to curbs, you would make your wife
Twice hit by the gun spit, kid still breathing
While half you busters in this damn game are still teething
Believe it if you say it enough that you'll be it
You never lived none of your raps, or even seen it
I mean it, every word a brother say
Everyday a brother play, kid
I politic and parley
The fact is I practice
Camoflauge to this
R & B androgynous
Get the most play
So I get fly
Do a movie - quadruple my cash
You just went double platinum
Let's see if you last
Every word that I say is documented and repeated
The truth is, I dropped the raw game, boy believe it
I've succeeded, in turning dirty dough legal
Bounced to the Bentley from the prime-it-up Regal
Like Biggie says, It's unbelieveable
My street pull
You even play like step in my way
You'll meet my people
Chorus
I've been round the world ballin, did it all, what's next?
While most of y'all busters on your first rolex
Been deep in the life kid, since 76
Touched the water, the crack game, the jewelry licks
Fix yourself if you're broke fool, that ain't my fault
The game must be taught and comprehended, then implemented
Moves done illegally, carried out strategically
Or else incarceration is felt, the hand is dealt
You lose it's frightening
Hit with 10 indictments
Kiss your baby and your wife
You're riding kites for life
Alot of y'all won't feel me, but some of y'all do
I'll move at least a half a mill of this before I'm through
That ain't the most, but I've done this longer than you
Plus it ain't my only gig, I'm still connected
With the boys that can flip a thou to a ticket
Wicked
My stature when you're in my rapture
Meet me on the street? I'm the nicest brother you meet
Confusing sometimes, the way I bust a rough rhyme
You might think I'm lying, cool I like that
I smile in your face, squeeze off the case, rock the Glock back
In your stomach, then I'll smile again
Don't want to be your enemy, I'd rather be your friend
Only the real win in the game, but what's the prize?
Every man goes through mad drama, and every man dies
Look in my eyes, touch my soul, I ain't like you
The evil I've done, I've got lots of retribution to do
That's an impossible task, cause every night the gats blast
So I look to the sky and ask
I've been blessed by God to rock this mic hard, so I do it
You got a problem, work through it
I love New York night, bright lights and action
I love bailin with my Bronx niggas, party crashin
I love switch hittin with my niggas on the shaw
You might see me in New Orleans at Mardi Gras
Or Miami at the Lex, in the Oaktown live
Or in Chi-town at the Players Ball, true P.I
Pimp or Die, Ice baby, it's a well known fact
That true players play the whole map
And we play all the way to (NY NY)

Got my nigga Radzay, my nigga Bazaro, my girl Gripsta in the house
We gonna do it for all the hardcore niggas out there like this...
(Radzay)
A hard hit makes a soft ass, that's what they told me huh!
I'm totally gone, I'm in another zone nigga put me on this
We layin' stick, my lyrics is heat
Havin' visions of ritual mirrors inside my sleep - nigga peep
I remember watchin' the news, dead people in jimmy bag
I got a Nine nigga get me mad
And watch me throw up razorblades and get to trippin'
I'm cats and crippin', lickin' is civil like Jack the Ripper
I'm on a mission drippin'-a-fog
An when it sees a million motherfuckers deceased
Some of police are brutal hog, I'm actor-baitin'
No hesitation to slice a motherfucker in thirty places
Fuck a case - ain't leavin' traces here to Redder-Dip
I'm aimin' a - automatic find a bitch I'm hangin' up
Protainin' up, boss strangler, better save my mother
Flat packs will end as brothers - the bloody covers
Bloody gloves like Yo-J, AK's my brainwaves
I'll strung a nigga all day to my dear play you won't be comin' back
I put that on my dear pops when I blast a fierce drop
My bloody mask revealin' Jason it's non-stop
The cemetary is what you facin'
My steel shot is smokin' like chainsaws, brains call
Recommend that you get your homies and watch your motherfuckin' game fall
(Chorus)
I only like my shit hardcore
(Radzay, South Central L.A. nigga)
I only like my shit hardcore
I only like my shit hardcore
I only like my shit hardcore

Prepare for the night that you never wanted
These streets is taunted, blacked out impala with the big rims on it
Hit'cha corner with the lights out, bitch it's on
Duck down wit'cha kids, you know what you did
Motherfuck what your niggas say, watch for the ricochet
It's gonna be hard to hear much, once my trigger spray
That's neither here nor there, just beware
Cause when I bust off my gat flings like a roll flair
You now listenin' to - the most hated and most loved at the same time cuz
Ice nigga what the fuck you wanna do about a T
Most'cha bitch niggas can't fuck with me
Cause your chin-chalked talk I can see through
Like you're rollin' in a phat V-12
Bulllshit - pull quick and have your shit cocked or dropped
Keep a spare clip cause sometimes the shots don't stop
It's motherfuckin' game to rap about, shits' for real
Double action, ain't gotta cock back no more
Got you bitch-ass niggas sweatin' like Taibo
Rather lookin', in my face, I'm just checkin' my flow
So, I advise you to keep it in the studio
Your attittude, you don't wanna meet me dude
My crews' like a fuckin' wild bunch of escaped beasts
Like scientists, cross cells of apes and G's
All the war - get you battle gear, black fatigues
You talk shit, your crews' catch a casualty, uh!

I only like my shit hardcore

I only like my shit hardcore
I only like my shit hardcore

Aiyyo my style be official, I bust like a pistol
Criminal - the issue, mad shit the nigga been through
Peep now, system, handcuffs nigga listen
Word up, robbin' white boys to buy blunts
The representative - GorTek Assassin thought to be a stallion
Yo I be splashin' Street Wars
The hardcore Ambassador in a black four door Akaror, I attach yours
The Marquise piece, gold teeth and medallion
Heads I be sappin' like the grams I be baggin'
Fightin' women, cut throat and tree smokin'
Violatin', infiltratin', blunt bakin'
Block regulatin', the cake, bake, a brick flippin'
Green expedition thicker to body stickin'
Bazaro, yo I got the hardcore flow
I drop to put a rock from the Bronx y'all know

I only like my shit hardcore

I only like my shit hardcore

On the mic, Grip be flexin'
Who's next to wreck when I mic check, mic check
I'm checkin' any verbal an' steppin'
What the fuck nigga duck you ain't fuckin' with this
Get touched cause I lust to bust when I clutch
With the quickness, killin' lyricist when I spit this
Who's next on my hitlist when I rip this
Lyrically I'm material, the Rap War General
Droppin' hoes quicker than a syllable, yeah you killable
Your style, unfillable, wishin' my shit was stillable
I eel for the fuck of it, queen you know I'm lovin' it
Dick, never suckin' it unless I see a buck in it
You need the whip, cluck it kid, I'm furious
Leavin' your crew delirious so you don't take it serious
I'm guessin' you was serious about the West, none test
I got the rep for my niggas on the shaw
Got the ball, fuck the law and yep I wet 'em out
As I proceed to spread 'em out and dead 'em out
Spray 'em out, lay 'em out
Ain't no surprise, come see me with four eyes
Young Grip I'm a prize, prepare for you demise
Recognize I put a hole in the local aforenor

On these muthafuckin records talkin all this bullshit

Them other sucker-ass niggas, them old fake-ass bitches)
I ain't tryin to hear that shit, man
These bitches ain't players, man
(Yeah man
You know these niggas out here been fakin for years, man
I'm glad my nigga Ice comin with that HP shit
That high-powered shit..)

Peace to my street niggas movin that weight
Much love to my comrads who's out in upstate
Mad connections from the bottom to the top of the game
Street fame, I got much that's in touch with my name
Got a overload of guns to unload on a lame nigga trippin
Wake up my posse, interrup the Rémy-sippin
Four in your back and keep bailin
Listen to the HK wailin and your vital signs failin
Everyone that ever met me knows
I work bitches like niggas, pimp niggas like hoes
Command a mack that's immaculate, your girl's naked
You think she ain't been hit, kid yo, you best to check it
For ten years I been connected to the top of this
Hold your breath, kid, I'm never droppin this
Too busy rollin off them fat chrome rims
And niggas who trip get sung hymns
We crash clubs and security shits
Cause they know they got size but they know we keep clips
Crazy muthafuckas lickin shots in doors
Leavin suckers' bodies bleedin over nightclub floors
You don't want none, son, stay gone
Break north when I come and you might live long
Yeah, my face kickin treble, you're just a pebble
You're gettin rocked, yo E, cock the Glock
And let these niggas know, yo, that the west don't play none
Fire shoots out of my strap like a ray-gun
You broke ill and you cold fucked up
Now you're bleedin through your fingers while you're holdin your gut
For real

So get your money how you want to, friend
But when it's time to count the chips only the real will win

But it's all about the dollars when the day is through

Than these here niggas)
It's the return of the real
(These muthafuckas best to get to recognize
Before I gets to chastizin
Cause see, the shit all ties in
It's just some of that pimp, player, hustler shit
Ice-T been around for a while now
Nigga was gangbangin when gangbangin wasn't even cool, nigga
What you know about that shit?)

I go deep into the street life's anatomy
A nigga take me out - yo, what a upset that'd be
And if I fall I fall on cushions, ???
Hittin niggas up with the Tec and watch the blood gushin
I see your videos, a 100 niggas in it you don't know
Framed in the lens, bought friends
Who really got your back, nigga, check it out
You really possess like zero street clout (think about)
The only place you're safe is in the studio
Yellin in the mic, you'se a bitch, that's right
I take a nigga like you and make him prostitute cute
So what you got a gun, punk, you're scared to shoot
You front hardcore, but I don't feel ya
Kids from my hood'll take your punk ass and peel ya
Let me check my Rolex quick because time's money
Squintin from the Pavet face because it's kinda sunny
Skinnin the top back, flossin the rag and the thing
Feelin the sun, backin off of my pinky ring
Hittin the 'Shaw with my niggas and clown
Lift the ass, hit the switch, raise the front off the ground
But most of the time you can't see a nigga
Deep in the archives parlayin new ways to get my bank bigger

(As I slides up out the do'
Gots to give a special props shout out to that nigga the O.G
Got muthfuckin Red in the house
 and the muthafuckin ringleader of funk, DJ Ace
Hot Dollar's up in this muthafucka
If you didn't know
Count your muthafuckin blessings and handcuff your hoe
You know what I'm sayin?

The House,O.G. Original Gangster,1991,"You know the house down the street
Where the kids are
And every day
They seem to have a new scar
Something strange is going on
And everybody knows
Doors always shut
Windows always closed
The little girl had a burn
The boy was black and blue
They said it came from play
You know that shit ain't true
The boy's arm's broke
Girl's scared to speak
Their parents drink all day
Couple of dead beats
Some days they go to school
And other days they might
It's hard to stay awake
After you cry all night
You see 'em every day
Tear tracks on their cheeks
But they will never tell
It goes on weeks and weeks
(But what can they do?
They're only children man!)
You ain't no fuckin' kid
Act like you give a damn!
Won't someone save these kids
Do something, call a cop

The Game’s Real,Gangsta Rap,2006,"Enough time has passed, false prophets steering you wrong
You won't appreciate my wisdom, 'til I'm dead and I'm gone
Underground dead from combat
Laid down on the floor.. in some club
Girls scream at the ocean of blood
No use to call the paramedics, to hit me with the fifth energetic
Close range, cut in the base of my brain
Blew my face on through some bitch's head, before I hit the ground
Some nigga touched me in the chest, and blew it out with the pound
My niggas didn't have chance to move, they used silenced weaponry
Couldn't hear the sound, as the club bass bound
All you heard was.. Yo, Ice is on the ground
The assassins, when they heard this up, stepped back and mixed in with the crowd
Gloom broke into hysteria, spot went wild
A lot of bitches yelling and crying, while fake niggas smile
I heard voices of my loved ones said I leave the party
God kisses my face as I leave my body

Yo, I wanna see what the fuck's happening!
Yo, yo, back off my man, man! (*Sample of L.A.P.D. sirens*)
Awww shit! y'all

The game is real, anyone can get touched up
Get moved on, left in a plunger blood
No matter how gangster you are, how deep your crew
Niggas can get you if they want to

Yo.. yo.. yo.. attack mode
Look, listen, it's the general.. code
Gully and gutter, I roll with some box cutters
I'm bringing.. fucking Jersey City niggas
We got.. tons of triggers, for tons of niggas
We walk and talk a lot, we run some niggas
No glitter and glades, it's guns and niggas
Nightclubs or your social clubs
Backstage with your membrane, on the side of your freeway
It's ugly, the bomb squashed blonde bitch for our shit
It's M-16s switch off clips
Bullets ripped fleshy death right through your kids
Except your bids, except all that shit you did
Uhh.. you can't hide in the town houses
When two niggas are nine-ing like two ounces
Scarface Colombia, Walker Tah's style surrounding, your white bitches out


Now, if you faggots got some questions about how real this is
A straight Strong-Arm, half of you niggas in the biz'
Your bodyguard, bitch made, motherfucking fake ass whores
Can't even roll for dolo, walk through your own hood solo
Niggas push up and change-snatch your logo
The truth is.. no homeboys are brought through
Your own crew is destorying you
So now you're carrying guns, you know, you won't shoot
You copped a new whip, had to get a bulletproof
You wanted to be Rap-Star, now, you're too shook to move
Cause the streets say the words, you kid gotta prove
Living a lie, you might die, in this game of hot caption whores
Check your rearview you're being followed


Eat the dick, if it be.. we gonna shoot from a block away
We keep with heat, and turn your face into a plot to play
Yeah, we spray out your feet and watch you burn in a flock away
Nerd, niggas stop and pray
Heard, they can't drop the lay
We come out, run out, one route to Dun-house
We're about to blow his wig off ""yeah yeah""
Nigga we jump out, pump out, dump out
Infront of the Dun house with the sun-hounds
Shit to peel off and I'm.. running the trot like crooked cops
Taking capes, pushing weight, while I shipped this back
From California to the.. Hill Tah, Comille fitting dots
Activille for them bills and he'll get drop

Look I.. show guys and buyers we're not kidding
I know the size, brothers stick-bys, when we start spitting

Busters don't know you get laid down for much less
This ain't no game, cuz niggas now we come
.50 cal dum-dum, rubber-grip bear guns
I see you run like diarrhea

Question is now which pussy want it the most?

Your mistake thinking that I'm dead and gone
Ask your mama, I'm bloody in the octagon
I'm iller than Chucky in Child's play
I bench 300 on a bad day
I'm wild like Uganda machetes
You motherfucking with a psychopath, you niggas ain't ready
Cracked my nigga T.I., but they didn't catch me
My silenced P90 sounds like sewing machines
Bugatti Veyron, Plasma Screen
Malibu beach house, lake house, I'm caked out
I come in all blue, I don't know red
And, I don't know throw dough, I make it rain lead
Coked out, I'm boiling bricks in the kitchen
I don't matter If you got it, nigga. Tricking is tricking
Algebraic, I multiply my metaphors
I'm so spa from deep tissues and pedicures
Overload of niggas in ski masks
Westside rider for life, you ain't gotta ask
L.A., home of the triple beam
My niggas run all up in your crib like a S.W.A.T. team
I'll make your SUV lean
Full metal jackets have it rockin' like a raft in rapids

Common Sense,The Seventh Deadly Sin,1999,"It starts like this
Gats hit harder than fists
Just cock and lick it
The aftermath's wicked
Brass gets evicted
Another crew shot
Can't put your strap back in your waist
Cause your barrel's too hot
You did it kid
The more dead
The more weight on your head
Plus you ganked a suitcase
Full of black tar H
Baby boy, twenty keys
Dead Colombian Gs
Now you're ballin full speed
One slip you bleed
You had your nigga with you
Hard rock street gorilla hitter
He took a hot one in the shoulder
Now he's bendin over
Mad illegal
Nigga flipped harder than Buggsy Segal
He wet the room up with the rocket launchin
Desert eagle
Blood oozin through his black dickies
Ya nigga say he's getting dizzy
The car seat's fuckin getting sticky
He leaned back, his whole chest plate's cracked
You thought they hit him once
He must of got double clapped
Your niggas dyin but he ain't cryin
Soldier no doubt
He looked you dead in the eye
Said ""get that money"" checked out
Ballin bent him back in the black
S T S but where he's going no stress
Your niggas dead, but you're thinkin bout head
Fly hoes and condos
Once you flip the kilos
The fact your niggas out ain't shit to ya
More profit for your greedy ass
No one to split the grip wit ya
Chorus:
Common sense will keep you safer than vests
Ambulance, cots, cause real niggas give head shots
LA streets will make your guts leak
Player no doubt
Young killers live for drug wars and shoot outs
You flipped your chip
Motorola, called your hooker
Said you had a little foul up
Told the ho to wet some towels up
She didn't even talk
Clicked the phone off
Might a new some weak niggas
But this bitch ain't soft
Make your next call
Straight to your chicano connect
Said they would flip the boy for girl
Up the weight, give you Peruvian flake
You had to dump the body
Burned it beyond recognition
Back back in commission
Scooped your hooker, cleaned your seats off
Squeezed off
Two in her head
Now the fuckin bitch is dead
You're all alone just how you liked it
Straight laced hustler from hell
Street life you spiked it
It's time to hook up with the mexicanos
Layin in the Dooly parking lot of a McDonalds
Hit the corner they was there
You're prepared
Circled the block, screwed your silencer on
Rock the esse they had
Kickin back to get ya
Crept on the dropped truck
Double crossin ducks got bucked
Check the back of the cab
Suckas had the fuckin math
Ten more keys of uncut pure cash (Yes!)
Now your weighin thirty full keys
Of girl and the pony
Jumped for your lack
Hit the yack threw your head back
The big time is what you wanted
And now you got it
The devil put the strap in your palm
And you shot it
Chorus
It's going down now
On forever
Square life is never
Buck wildin is your life stylin
Mashed out
Hit a motel room
Crashed out
Called up a ho to get your dick sucked though
Bad bitch phat backs green contacts
Real hair, kept her feet all night in the air
Kind of square
Said she only worked the streets a week
Said her boyfriend kicked her out
And she needed to eat
She cuddled to you like a baby
Keep the girl mabey
The pussy was tighter than fuck drove you crazy
She kissed you on your chest and legs
Asked you to fuck her in the ass
Then she started to beg
It kind of got you open, no doubt
When baby doll fell asleep, with your dick in her mouth
Now you're layin there, lookin at the motel door
Hand on your strap, some beautiful whore
You fuckin relaxed, fell a fuckin sleep bad move
Big game take little game, show and prove
Baby jumped up, went for the strap
Dumped off
Three shots in your face
Grabbed the sutcase
Don't forget, grab the blow then jet
Before that ho hit the door she sipped a glass of Moet
Street life sabatoge
Niggas wanna live large
Demon ho out for cheddar
Capped you with your own Berreta

Retaliation,The Seventh Deadly Sin,1999,"(Intro: Ice-T)
Every year the same shit happens
More fuckin' funerals, dead homies
Niggas out here killin' each other
I don't know why
And when it happens to you
Just can't turn the other fuckin' cheek
Gotta get back for your dead niggas
Yeah I'm caught up to
(Ice-T)
Sometimes I sit and wonder
How many motherfuckers gonna die this summer
Gunshots from the hummer
Now the sawed-off riot pumps lead across your beds
They said: ""Mama, less you wouldn't strike back""
Mack ten, eleven, twelve, hit us and then puts us to hell
They started it, there's no way to mend it, we'll end it
My crew'll hit the matresses, G.O.D
Father style - all prepared to get buckwild
Half my niggas ball, other half ain't got it all
They stay up at nights waitin' on a combat call
Drinkin' hard liquor, smokin' mad loop and shit
So high, sometimes I even gotta load they clips
I ain't mad at them though, they dumps the ammo
In you, suspend you in the air, hell yeah
It's the time that the real niggas live for retaliation
Move on 'em, show, improve on 'em
All you punk bitches just stand back and watch
Me, I'm oilin' up the Heckler & Koch
I gots no love, for them busters, who put the work in
I can still see my fuckin' boys' body jerkin'
I ran over to him, put my hand on his chest
Hole like an apple in the side of his neck
His eyes glanced up, his body jerked once more
There's nothin' else to do but to go to war
Slide the hollow-tips in the chrome four-four
Roll down the windows, hang the heat out the door
Catch all the fuckin' bodies that I can tonight
Double-back on your bitch crew, broad daylight
(Chorus: Ice-T)
There's no innocence allowed in these ghetto streets
Grab your guns, buck 'em off, when ya hit ya leak
Tell me what would you do if they killed your best friend?
Could you keep your cool, would the wounds mend?
If I said ""peace"", I'll be a motherfuckin' liar
(""I'm lettin' off until my arms tired"" - cut and scratched*)Retaliation
(Ice-T)
Been packin' straps so long
I gots some permanent bruise in my leg
Better that than dead
Now it's time to show you what I'm trained for in this
Rally up the wolfpack-attack relentless
Make ya understand it was the wrong crew ya fuck with
Now it's on bitches, guys are darker than shit
You musta not a known who you fuckin' hit that day
Or maybe you did, you're dyin' anyway
And not just you, some of your family
To tell you the truth any fuckin' body we see
You might just wanna turn yourself into me
To save your hood pain of my crews' treachery
You fucked up, we know who you are, where ya live
We got your place ran up to a cop on the take
We'll hit your block so hard, you'll swear it was an earthquake
Squeeze off the fully-auto, make your whole crib shake
I know you're breathin' hard, livin' on your last day
Or maybe, you're laughin', thinkin' that you got away
I don't give a fuck, I won't sleep
Till one of us lays me and my nigga
That's the fear of these triggers
If ya smart, ya probably make a break out of state
We'll just snatch your kid, grab your fuckin' bitch and wait
I'll catch ya down South, lay your ass out straight
There's no where to run, it's time to meet your make
You got one chance, arm your whole damn crew
I couldn't stop my fuckin' niggas if I wanted to
(Chorus: Ice-T)
There's no innocence allowed in these ghetto streets
Grab your guns, buck 'em off, when ya hit your leak
Tell me what would you do if they killed your best friend?
Could you keep your cool, would the wounds mend?

New Jack Hustler (Nino’s Theme),Whatever: The ’90s Pop & Culture Box,UnKnown,"Hustler, word, I pull the trigger long
Grit my teeth, spray till every nigga's gone
Got my block sewn, armored dope spots
Last thing I sweat's a sucka punk cop
Move like a king when I roll, hops
You try to flex, bang, another nigga drops
You gotta deal with this cause there's no way out
Why? Cash money ain't never gonna play out
I got nothin to lose, much to gain
In my brain, I got a capitalist migraine
I gotta get paid tonight, you muthafuckin right
 my grip, check my bitch, keep my game tight
So many hoes on my jock, think I'm a movie star
Nineteen, I got a fifty thousand dollar car
Go to school, I ain't goin for it
Kiss my ass, bust the cap on the Moet
Cause I don't wanna hear that crap

Yo man you know what I'm sayin?
You got it goin on my man, I like how it's goin down
You got the fly cars, the girls, the jewels
Look at that ring right there
I know it's real, it's gotta be real
Man, you the flyest nigga I seen in my life!
Yo man, I just wanna roll with you man
How can I be down?
What's up? You say you wanna be down?
Ease back, or muthafucka get beat down
Out my face, fool I'm the illest
Bulletproof, I die harder than Bruce Willis
Got my crew in effect, I bought em new Jags
So much cash, gotta keep it in Hefty bags
All I think about is keys and Gs
Imagine that, me workin at Mickey D's (ha ha ha ha)
That's a joke cause I'm never gonna be broke
When I die there'll be bullets and gunsmoke
Ya don't like my lifestyle? Fuck you!
I'm rollin with the New Jack crew
And I'm a hustler
H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler
New Jack, New Jack..........
Here I come, so you better break North
As I stride, my gold chains glide back and forth
I care nothing bout you, and that's evident
All I love's my dope and dead presidents
Sound crazy? Well it isn't
The ends justifies the means, that's the system
I learned that in school then I dropped out
Hit the streets, checked a grip, and now I got clout
I had nothing, and I wanted it
You had everything, and you flaunted it
Turned the needy into the greedy
With cocaine, my success came speedy
Got me twisted, jammed into a paradox
Every dollar I get, another brother drops
Maybe that's the plan, and I don't understand
But since I don't know, and I ain't never learned
I gotta get paid, I got money to earn
With my posse, out on the ave
Bump my sounds, crack a forty and laugh
Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam
Is this a nightmare? Or the American dream?
So think twice if you're coming down my block
You wanna journey through hell? Well shit gets hot
Pregnant teens, children's screams
Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam
You don't come here much, and ya better not
Wrong move (bang), ambulance cot
I gotta get more money than you got
So what, if some muthafucka gets shot?
That's how the game is played
Another brother slayed, the wound is deep
BUT they're givin us a Band Aid
My education's low but I got long dough
Raised like a pit bull, my heart pumps nitro
Sleep on silk, lie like a politician
My Uzi's my best friend, cold as a mortician
Lock me up, it's genocidal catastrophe
There'll be another one after me!

What does a rapper do when he starts out hardcore, but can't sell enough records to remain in the record business?

Ice, we can send this niggas all to Hell
I never like them niggas from the get go
We used to break em at craps
And fuck all they motherfuckin hoes!

Made another car-hit
30 Killers on the hip
Ready to rock, packin, Magnums and Glocks
Mad connections who trips the question
Niggas on the way to play with the laser ray

Nigga you got two strikes and I got two strikes
We can't afford to leave no fuckin witness tonight
But if this is what they want is like Christmas to me
It's been a long time since the Big Rich caught a body

Fuck it, I Like the way you think my man
I pack 20 motherfuckers in an Astro Van
We pass the crib about 12:30, dirty
Nigga be ready to roll, I know you heard me!

Nigga it's on, so don't trip I'm down

When the shootin stop, car look like confetti
Went my ass home jump back in the bed G

Fuck why they wanna fuck with us
When they know my posse is crazy and they down to bust
Big Rich take no shit from these busta ass tricks
Check a punk ass nigga like we check a bitch

I got no love for no nigga flippin, trippin on my fam
Got damn, I make L.A. hot as Vietnam

DJ Ace
Iceberg nigga
Gangsta shit
Niggas out there running their mother fucking mouth
Acting like bangers
Acting without sad cards
Like somebody supposed to be afraid

You faggots don't scare me, I'm twice as cold
Niggas can't tell me shit, I'm twice as old
Fuck how much you sold, I got twice the cash
Fuck how raw you are, I blast twice as fast
No matter how fly you get, I get  twice as smooth
No matter how slick you are, I got twice the moves
Fuck how big you get, I got twice the fame
One word Iceberg, that means twice the game

Twice the heart nigga look in my eyes
L.A. gang-banging, to the streets I'm wise
Notice a novice when it comes to the guns
I never flash, just reach and blast
Chrome hydraulics and the black ski mask
Your next decision might be your last
Real niggas fed the fuck up with the fakes
Think about the next move you make nigga

You faggots don't scare me, I'm twice as cold
Niggas can't tell me shit, I'm twice as old
Fuck how much you sold, I got twice the cash
Fuck how raw you are, I blast twice as fast
No matter how fly you get, I get  twice as smooth
No matter how slick you are, I got twice the moves
Fuck how big you get, I got twice the fame
One word Iceberg, that means twice the game

Fame
Motherfuckers want it so bad
Give away every fucking piece of soul they had
Lie to themselves and they lie on the pad
Its a motherfucking hip-hop fad
Get gangster, get gully, get raw
Talk about shit that you never fucking saw
Well the streets talk
They say they need to holler at you
You go to jail, you got problems there too
That's the drama that comes with fakeness
Body guard niggas straight making me laugh
Forty niggas in your entourage, all of them fags
The real nigga in your crew straight extorting your cash
Who am I talking to?
Half you rap whores
Rolling with the cops talking all about your hardocore
No names needed, everybody knows
The real niggas in the game, and the straight hoes

You faggots don't scare me, I'm twice as cold
Niggas can't tell me shit, I'm twice as old
Fuck how much you sold, I got twice the cash
Fuck how raw you are, I blast twice as fast
No matter how fly you get, I get  twice as smooth
No matter how slick you are, I got twice the moves
Fuck how big you get, I got twice the fame
One word Iceberg, that means twice the game

These streets got a problem with you
They say the shit you say on your records ain't true
They say that you're talking about people that you never knew
It's a gimmick niggas see right through
They want a little cash back for the lives you stole
They say they'll take it back in your blood and your gold
More body guards, more steel plates
In the doors of your cars and your SUVs
You know you got real problems 'cause you're fucking with Gs
You got the fake gangster rapper disease
Keep lying nigga, digging your grave
Claiming how you bust guns when you know you're bitch made
Your whole posse knows nigga, when will you learn
They're looking at your bankroll, laying the turn
You wanna be a gangster but forgot one thing
Gangsters get murdered or they die in the bing

You faggots don't scare me, I'm twice as cold
Niggas can't tell me shit, I'm twice as old
Fuck how much you sold, I got twice the cash
Fuck how raw you are, I blast twice as fast
No matter how fly you get, I get  twice as smooth
No matter how slick you are, I got twice the moves
Fuck how big you get, I got twice the fame

Exodus,The Seventh Deadly Sin,1999,"Yeah, This is Ice-T
You've just been listening to the Seventh Deadly Sin
To me the Seventh Deadly Sin is hardcore rap
And I'm very proud to have been a part of that throughout the years
I'd like to send peace out to all my homeboys that kept it real
And love to all my niggas that have died out here
In this bullshit that we call the streets
You know? What can I say? Hip Hops been good to a nigga
I got mad love for the East coast, West coast, North and South
I got my niggas The Top Guns here
We gonna sign this one off like this:
My life's been a great story in the ultimate war
Should I ill or do right? Make peace or go raw?
I can't explain the true penalties of fame and the wealth
Tell me who can I trust? I can't trust myself
Got the devil got me thinking 'bout them ill moves
Every damn kid on the street, they got something to prove
Push a bullet through my heart, why not? That's a start
They could push their reps quicker, kill a well known nigga
And if you say you're going to kill me, should I blast you first?
Being black is kinda like being born with a curse
Do or Die, that's the code of the streets I didn't invent
Niggas sketch my life out with malicious intent
My skin color's got me trapped in a never ending ghetto
I move to the hills, but I can never let go
The gun shots and the homicides just don't stop
And just because I came up, I can always drop
Yo.. we come prepared for guerilla warfare
Never scared soldiers to the heart
And hose them body parts with the hardwear
You spark a dun with Bizzaro or sequel
When you catch a link on the wings of this desert eagle
Flappin, we splittin caps friend
Remember when niggas would shoot joints
Now niggas be wildin' placing hollow points
Cause in this rat race, shit be moving at a murderous pace
Mad sons got slugs to the face, OG packs kilos
Over sore losers and cilo, prepare like a scout
I hold the burner on the delo
In this age of idolatry, mad niggas worship u vanity
If Five ?? you nigga maintain humanity - insanity
Hope you see the light ­ like the prism's true colors
Only a few remain brothers, fuck the others
In this cold world ­ the war that's controlled by the trigger
Revelation or the scripture got to be that live nigga
So if niggas want to bite the sound like Tyson
Deck him in the left eye, murder sit down like ryerson
You wanna dis, don't even try son
Hey yo, Pizzone ­ I'm the prodigy you need to keep ya eyes on
Yo who the don, who plays it all night long?
50 mill strong, Handle like napalm. Word is bond
Who get it on when it's time to drop a bomb?
Sadq keep it cool and calm with the niapalm
Droppin emcee's to their knees and make them pie straight
Dust and take and serve niggas on my hot plate
So cats who got beef, we can take it to the streets
Cause shit these niggas talk to the grave with they teeth
It's time to meet your maker step into the new millennium
I analyze data like intel Pentium
So follow me, I blame sovereignty for God we bust
Top Gun, move bright, smooth as Ice, sex and dust
Ante up the goods, Top Gun Ice-T in your neck of the woods
I'm 15 blocks deep in the foreign neighborhood
Street of my styles, no smiles, trying to gun down the golden child
Still on trial for my old endeavors
Cold weather got catched trying to buck wholes in my fucking sweater
Niggas is soft like butter, leathers and felt
Time to heat it up and melt
Felt the welts from brass belt buckles to brass knuckles
Kill all the jokes and chuckles ­ let's all get together
My fam stay thick together
Trick off and lick off together
No matter the weather
Lets ease on down to the bow and to the bricks
When I start to squeeze, I won't ease off a bit
Won't be no teams up in here with no clashes
Just bunk mile sleds boot shines up in the masses
Life got no guarantees, I'm looking for the long lease
When I'm in LA, it ain't hard to find me
21st floor eating shrimp at Belonte's
Every time you see me I'm connected to a dime piece
I check your styles, although you rhyme quicker
No matter what you do, I'll always lace mine thicker
Jealousy will make a fool die quicker than liquor
Watch your back with your niggas
Cause that's right where they'll stick ya
You see me in the club jeweled up, all alone
I give love to my homies, then I bounce the fuck home
Bodyguards are something that I just don't do
Cause if I'm after you black, I'm gonna clap them too
Money makes all my homies look brand new
I don't fuck with the fakes, I make moves with the true
Ice ­ baby chopping that real, thought you knew
I might sound hard, but nigga I can die too
Cause I'm as real as you",https://genius.com/Ice-t-exodus-lyrics

Do you wanna go back to your man or, baby, stay here with me?

Wanna roll up in your river like a steamboat
Pretend you're takin a bath and I'm your piece of chalice soap

Alright, check this out, girls
Me and my man Big Rich, we got an idea
Why don't we just use body language
Let our bodies do all the talking
And just kick back and enjoy the erotic conversation

Hello Sunshine, now you did quite fine
Shall we rewind, relive these good times?
I feel your body gettin hot again
Girl, don't you know I'm 'bout to dive on in?
(It's never gonna stop until I know it's truly over)
I got some more oil I wants to stick up in your motor
And kiss you on the grill, squeeze your headlights
Rub your bumper kitten, gettin nasty like a triple x-rated flick

I know you're feelin what I'm feelin, sexual energy
Time to chill and pour another glass of Hennessy
I hit it again like a gangster should
And give you somethin to tell them girls up the hood
Now how does it feel?

Now how does it feel to make love to a gee?
Do you wanna go back to your man or, baby, stay here with me?
How does it feel to make love to a gee?

Bittin' my rhymes,stealin' my style
I rocked so hard,it wasn't true
I won the virgin girl,and her MAMA too
Sex (x4)
When I'm upon the microphone
All the fly young ladies want a take me home
When the party's over,take me to their house
Throw me in the bed,know what we're talkin' about?
Then they say,""Ice-T you are the best
I love your eyes
Your things,your chest
You put all my lovers to shame
I can't remember my boyfriends name
You made me feel all hot and wet
The way you move I can't forget
I came,I came,I came again it felt so good I told my friends
You can have my cars,my jewels,my wealth
I love you more than I love myself
After tonight fulfilled I'll be
No hundred men could match ICE-T
Sex (x4)
Then she turn out the lights,throw back the sheets
And then our two hot bodies meet
And all at once she felt the thrill
The caress of the best,the Ice-T chill
Start with her tongue upon the back of my leg
She didn't stop till I hollered screamed and begged
Then she rolled me over,took me to the stage
Like in the nasty book where you tore out the page
Sex (x4)
I put it in their blouse
In their brain their little panties that their boyfriend saw
I put it in their mini skirt and up their thigh
Deep,deep girls,I wanna make you cry
I move it in and out,know what I'm talkin' about
Then around your neck until you show respect
Then on your cheek until I reach my peak
Then in your mouth girl,no joke,I'll take it out
Don't want to see you choke
I'll run it down your back,might cause a heart attack
I'll put it in your butt until I get enough
And then I'll take it out and put it in my pants
'Cause I fuck with the beat,the only way to dance
Sex (x4)",https://genius.com/Ice-t-sex-bonus-beat-lyrics
"Money, Power, Woman",UnKnown,UnKnown,"""You gotta make the money first""
""Then when you get the money, you get the power""
""Then when you get the power, Then you get the woman""
The problem is you broke, You ain't got no car or job
You slow with youer hustle, You dress like a slob
Ladies ain't looking for no brothers like this
They want the dub-twisting ballers with the ice on their wrist
You gotta get your cash right to get in the game
Might have to pull a pistol, Flip some caine
Get out in them streets and hustle hard in the rain
Take your come up and reinvest to the game
""You gotta make the money first""
You need a lot to go far
What you think is rich, I just spent on a car
What you think is paid, I just blew on a watch
What you think is wealthy, I just dropped on a yacht
Flip the street cash and try to pick some stocks
Kick back in your pad and watch it roll like crops
But it really ain't that easy, Or we all would be rich
One mistake, You're broke, The come up's a bitch
Make the right moves and forget about sleep
Concentrate on the paper chase, Join the elite
Few dun got mad cash and money to spend
Money to straight blow and money to lend
And only then, You made it past stage one, My friend

Now you got the money and the cash flow thick
But you really ain't nothing but a richer trick
Just because you're paid, you can still get thick
By your low life homies or skanless bitch
You gotta move it around, put it in the right hands
Maybe a judge, Make a PA your friend
Understand what really moves the world
Recognize what really moves these girls
Juice is more important than cash for real
Money you spend, But true power you feel
It ain't that easy to reach
Respect is about the hardest damn thing in the streets to get
Make your moves correct, Watch your crew
Watch your back, They watching you
Anybody round you has gotta be true
Or you never make it past stage two
Listen, when you get the real true power, You know
People will feel you, Wherever you go
And when you really max this game
You'll never have to say your name

Now you got the power, It's on, My friend
Cuz the one thing women love is powerful men
The one thing women hate are brothers that bend
They act like they like 'em, But they only pretend
They wanna be with that man in the V.I
They don't wanna stand in line
You outta your mind?
That other player's got cash, But no juice
Cuz the powerful men get to choose
From a multitude of women that be steppin in crews
Willing to do much more than before
Give you quick brains, It's insane
Just what the woman'll do just for you
Cuz if you got the power, Then they gets it too
If you rollin benz, Then they rollin too
If you livin phat, Then they ballin too
That sounds stupid to you, Not to me
They winning one move when it takes us three
Cars, Big houses, And shopping sprees
While most of us see the penitentiary",https://genius.com/Ice-t-money-power-woman-lyrics
Dear Homie,VI - Return of the Real,1996,"Dear Homie, whats the hap, since your up in the sky?
With God by your side
Homie what's it like?
I know your bein' treated right
No more worries
Plus you're bein heard G
I guess you know niggas is still trippin
I don't know why, they see a future in it
We're headed for self-destruction
Can't function
Only thing I can do is pray
And thank God, for another day
Yes Homie, it's rough down here. I gotta watch my back
Cos it's hard being black
If it ain't the other
It's my own colour
Tryin to work me
Tryin to hurt me
Ain't no L-O-V-E
Please tell me why, Dear Homie

Dear Homie, gang-bangin ain't joke
And I'm lookin over ya loc
Always knew there was fools out to get me
I didn't even hear the gunshots till after the slugs hit me
I grabbed for my chest and my neck, hopin
When my head hit the ground my skull busted open
You used to ask for my advice
Well Dear Homie, dyin ain't nothin nice
And the place I'm at is overpacked
With young blacks who crash crack and gats
I can only pray
You don't come this way
You gotta stay alive, you got a kid G
I feel ya partner but I worry alot
Bust shots
I know you're tryin' to comfort me
But I don't want no company, Homie

Dear Homie, even though you're gone
I still fell your presence
Sometimes I can sleep
Cos I just can't see
Reality like it really should be seen
I still reminisce on how we used to kick it
Strollin' the yard, just hangin' out together
Down for whatever, whenever
And now I'm hopin, you're seeing a true friend in me
We where meant to be

Dear Homie, you used to call me O.G
Now ya really gotta look up to me
Cos the place I'm at, is way high in the sky
I didn't want to die
But the life I lived was just to reckless
Too many bad marks on God's checklist
And many many brothers will go out
Just tryin to get that hard-core street clout
But a street reps final test, is when you're lying in a coffin
With you're hands folded on your chest
Then ya hear the girls cry
Then ya hear the brothers lie
Talkin' about how down you was
Then the next week the back on the street, they cold forgot ya cuz'
Don't wanna see ya on your back
So for me stay sucka free, cos you don't need that, Homie
Dear Homie...
Dear Homie...
Ya know I miss ya Homie...",https://genius.com/Ice-t-dear-homie-lyrics
Make The Loot Loop,VI - Return of the Real,1996,"Yeah
This is goin out to all those muthafuckas
That like to use the word 'gangster'
Although I am the O.G
I'm representin that hustlin game
To the end, nigga
I'm tryin to make the loot loop

I ain't no muthafuckin gangsta, wish you'd quit callin me that
Although I still pack straps I roll in Benzes and Lacs
Best believe the gats in my promo shots ain't props
I hang out sunroof tops and pop Glocks at cops
(Yo, how ya livin?) On the mellow, coolin with my fellow
Hustlers, players, super bitch-layers
Mackaronies on the true d-l - hell, most
Fuckin with my niggas you could end up ghost
I made a million, got my shit out pawned
Bailed out the homies, now the shit's back on
Moved out the ghetto, cause I hate it
But I roll through your fuckin hood and regulate it
Cause I wasn't born to be broke, I let the .45th smoke
Before I let my baby boy go under, no wonder
I'm addicted to the cash flow, stacks of green
Flashback, I'm nudgin weights down a triple beam
I'ma make the loot loop

As fast as I spend it
I'm tryin to get back in it
I make the loot loop
It's cop and blow
Nigga, that's all I know
I make the loot loop
As fast as I spend it
I'm tryin to get back in it
I make my loot loop
Nigga
I'm tryin to make my bank roll bigger

I must admit, I got a lust for loot, quick to shoot
Ostrich, fruits and Austin Martin coupes
Fill my dreams with cream, I got wet sheets
I'm bustin nuts over currency, kid, fuck freaks
We be the niggas in the back of the club with the Moët
Bitches, shrimps, mackin like pimps
Wearin fly shit you never seen before (raw)
I turn a angel to a whore, now need I say more?
My perm got bounce, fuck a 40 ounce
I'm sippin Cristal, pal, and represent I shall
To the end of the game
(That nigga Ice got fame)
And just not over these beats
But on the 4-wheel streets
I make the loot loop


Say what you will, I'm the fool on the hill
With the pool, jaccuzzi, laser-beam Uzi
Niggas in LA know the Ice don't play
I'm just a savage for the cabbage and a pimp parlay
I rock a million with the jewels on the paw (don't start)
Cause my niggas ain't the big ones, just big guns
Pushin the limits of this game till I gets my piece
I put my true queen Darlene in a white Corniece
So stay broke if you wanna, hang out on your corner
Step back from the curb when we roll up on ya
20 black cars all tinted, we meant it
'Syndicate forever - posse of the clever'
Rubberbands strap the fat green knots
We're strictly hustlers not gangsters, but we still lick shots
For the goal
Peace, I'm out like Nicole
(Get down
Get down)
Nigga
The bank's getting bigger
Yeah
I'm makin the loot loop
Straight player for life

While whole crews flash they fo-fo's in the flicks

Late night, auto, maga-static
Hit the next turn, hang 'em out and cause havoc
Your cash, your block, I gotta have it
Nigga normally toss it up and live lavish
My traps well lured, I go hardboard
It gets loud, known for bustin' off in crowds
Word 'em up, hurt 'em up, move out, blow the spot
Round two, rounds flew (*shots*) in the parkin' lot
Niggas rallied up to see who got shot
Wait down G, my whole crew surrounds me

Forced to Do Dirt,VI - Return of the Real,1996.0,"Ice-T back in that ass
Return of the real
Muthafuckas fakin and frontin like they don't know what time it is
Niggas on the streets ain't really got a muthafuckin choice
Muthafucka
(So niggas is forced to do dirt) --] Prodigy
Born hustler
I only run with real niggas who wear gold and jewels
Diamond rings, strapped with tools
I take no shorts cause I been in it for the long one, the strong one
Gotta tell the truth, yo, half my niggas is on the run
Street giant defiant to the laws
That the white man made, nigga
That's why we play, nigga
A/k/a the street hustler from the Westside
Too damn fly, too much finesse for the hoo ride
I rather take a mark off smooth
Cause the skilll of a hustler is to stick and move
And make you say: ""Damn, what's his name?
Got to give a nigga props cause the kid got game""
Mad game, fool, I base my hustle not on strength
But think, you say 'the liqor store', I say 'brinks'
Cause my mind's on the massive roll of the dice
The magnitude of my game's insane, precise
So now you're mad cause I got money and you don't
The hustlers win, the busters won't
What can I say, you can't come out and play
With the real ones, dig this
You'll get broke with the quickness
I don't gamble, I cheat when it's on
Two g's on the table, two in my palm
And if I spill up, I pull the nickel .25 strap
Then the place gets flat and then I'm out the back
With my niggas and them 4's on thangs
And if I really wanna floss I flex my Bentley wings
Damn, over your head, got a problem
Keepin lyrics down to earth so normal niggas can solve em
But the game's extreme so quit your high beams
And increase the light, now can you see me, you might
If you ever been to jail or shot, sold rocks
I'm talkin 'bout weight down like movin ki's and pounds
But every nigga in the hood ain't fly
Light-skinned or dark, they're 90% marks
Straight vics and they got money to give
Then without em tell, me how the hell a hustler lives..
I got no love for a lame
I use my strategy from crack to rap, no shame
And now instead of cooking some ki's
I'm flippin million dollar ??? call em wack MC's
But suckers got it twisted, they missed it
Wastin they life when yo, they mentally gifted
The streets ain't the only fuckin hustle in town
You gotta get in where you fit in, gotta stay way down
But a buster is a buster for life
He makes excuses why his ass ain't pay
That shit's played
Cash rules everything around me, kid
I hit a 50'000 lick and never did no bid
Cause I'm bent on a come-up and my shit stays tight
How many fake gangsta rappers will I hear tonight?
It don't matter cause the real don't care
You know I'mma gonna get mine, so I'mma let em get theirs
But I know in the heart what's true
So if you listen very closely, maybe you will too
My mind's blown off Armani suits
Pavet medaillons,  boots
Cristal and steak, shrimp big as your hand
I bought a silk robe and it's from Siam
This jam's for the hoods and thugs
Pimps and hoes, the slingers of drugs
Hustlers and thieves, cons and crooks
Bookers and sharks, muthafuck the marks

Cold as Ever,Cold as Ever,UnKnown,"When I was young I knew everything
And she a punk who rarely ever took advice
Now I'm guilt stricken, sobbing with my head on the floor
Stop a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice, now
Can't be held responsible
She was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place
For the life of me
I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me

We were mearly freshman
My best friend took a weeks vacation to forget her
His girl took a weeks worth of valium and slept
Now hes guilt stricken, sobbing with his head on the floor
Thinks about her now and how he never really wept he says
Can't be held responsible
She was touching her face
I won't be held responsible

Hey yea yea yea yea yea

Can't be held responsible

Absolutely not, where'd you get that information from

Naw, naw, it's all fantasy
It's just, you know you just make this stuff up
Rap is fake

I don't know what they're talking about it's a joke
I make movies, I make records

I'mma slow it down for a minute
I wanna talk to all the ladies out there
I got my man J-e-ll in the house
I got a message I wanna send out to all the fly ladies, yeah
Check me out

It's time for me to kick game
And if I can't do it, then ladies, Ice ain't my name
Now real brothers ain't easy to understand
And it's a long hard road to become a man
Drama seeks and chases him through every year
His homie dies, you might see him shed a tear
But mostly hardcore feelings are all you see
Cause you gotta be raw to be called a gee
But every man slows down
You'll see this side when there's probably no one around
And there's no safer place
Than if you ever are some gee's homebase
But it ain't easy, these brothers got barricades around the hearts
It's gonna take time before the trust starts
But girl, you must be true
Cause if your man's a gee, he'll definitely die for you
Look him deep in his eyes, let him know you're there
Show him that you really care
Trust me, you move with time
Through the darkened halls of his mind
You just might find

The me inside of a gangsta
Yo, Jell
You know what I'm sayin?
I try to represent for all the brothers out there
And I know my latin homies have the same drama with they girls, man
Won't you let em know how it's goin down

Man, I'm lookin for a hina that's down
But you don't have to be brown
If you wanna hang around
All you gotta do is stay in check
Cause if you're rubbin me right
Then you can bet you'll get respect
And that's why I guess my feelings will have to show
How can you hide somethin that's in your soul?
Cause there's more to the l-o-c
Than all the violence, baby, that ain't who I be
I know my dogs and me can still pull straps
But I rather have you rollin in my Cadillac
Cause when we cruisin, thangs is all good
And that goes for every vato in the hood
Now sometimes it's hard to show the other side
Especially when my crew is caught up in a homicide
Cause East L.A. don't play
And if I had my way
I'd kick it with you everyday

Whether black or brown, the situation's the same
Different hoods, but the same game
Some girls won't take their time
Others will stroll through our souls and find

Anything can happen
Don't stop, huh, ha, huh, uh, yeah, shit
(Buckshot, Ice-T)
Buckshot, he be the emcee
What, watch your step

Can I hear it for Buckshot? (Buckshot)
Buck's hot, spell it and yell it but the shit don't stop
It be hot, y'all niggas is worthless in the money market
I'm buck you ain't worth shit, nigga what?
Think about it, shorty what you drivin' stoned by your daddy
Oops, you almost had me, geesed up until I saw the truth
And one day I see you standin' at a token booth
It was on a hot wet night, I think it was a Saturday
Right after that party that he lead out down the way
Gunshots spread - everyday, all day (fuck!)
D.T.'s rushed the party in 2K
Buck - The Beef be - fled the scene right before the cops
And the Swats came with the triple beam
Uh, shit is real you know how we do when the young niggas peel out
Don't squeal (*undecipherable*)
(Ice-T)
If you niggas don't know you should know by now
Ice got more game than the law allows
Straight up - the biggest baller in the industry
Went straight from pimpin' hoes on the NBC
Do you feel me? I dealed it, ace off the bottom
Ho's got 'em, I'm the one you just can't fade
Rolex in the tenth grade, hair was laid
Everything I wore to school baby was tailor made
Shot dice in the bathroom on my knees
I'll roll across the break and break that ass with these
Start hittin' jewel-liks, re-investin' in ki's
Drop the top on the flo', let you feel the breeze
(Buckshot Shorty)
Trees make my eyes bleed I come from an ill breed
Thoroughbred born from a strong seed
Led by a bunch of individuals (Ali)
Uh, criminals to generals - this is like wow!
Look at how my brain ay blew you out the frames
Twist of fate cause you say the same shit now
The Local Mobb Grill and let y'all niggas know I'm dead
I'm serious, somebody can get killed
Wait for the fire drill and when you start to smell the smoke
Run nigga Buck ain't no joke I'll buck a shot at your zipped up coat
Chop the throat like a blow from Judo, nigga you know
(Ice-T)
Is it new year God? I'm comin' back mad-hard
Movin' harder than a convict with a shack in the yard
New Jacks wanna hear me rap beggin' for freestyle skills
I've served so many rappers I can make a land field fool
You've doubt for a mic dude, the Ice is a jewel
Fuck rules , I got more pool than a mule
Matter of fact, never comprehend the styles I sin
I've been breakin', annihilate fakes and tens
See I'm a nigga from the West Side cheered I peel libs
What prayin' that you do hill when I all ready did
Like your girl gotta admit she was a sexy bitch
But I hit it with the Gin so my nuts don't itch
(Whta, what, what?)
(Buckshot Shorty)
Buck's got ya locked, body drawn like pit bulls
We don't give a fuck if we have to pull, click, shit
Brooklyn niggas is known to rep-resent
Any nigga happened that's why I left
Niggas get strep-throats, throats get strepped
Get your shit taken then your shit is kept
Uh, shit in a step, if not got your back broke
Plus ya jaw tapped, snapped your 'Adams Ap'
It's just a fact that niggas ain't shit
Ain't shit like Egyptians, nigga trippin'
Beenie-eyed, never slippin', I'm grippin' the four-twenty
Motherfuck the bullshit talk - where the money?
Years ago, a friend of me ask me to start up a company
Duck Down's the name, rap music is the aim
Lyrically I bring the pain and lock the game with no padlock and chain
Some said that Buck went bust
But when I came out, I left 'em all in the dust
Look at your sound scam, original brown man
Makin' million everytime I drop a jam
(Ice-T)
Nigga duck, DJ drop the cut, huh
250 niggas throw they sets up
L.A. style, nigga what? (West Side!!)
If you've never seen it before they'll put a knot in your gut
Stand up, check your areas your group, your troops
These gang killers is real plus they, off the loot
Proceedin' to leave a nigga bleedin'

I Ain’t New To This,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Come on, come on
Do this, ugh, come on, come on
Time to get wreck and kick the so on and so on
The I C E-T, O.G. M.C., L.A.P.D., H A T E S
(Ho)
Watch the mic blow
I flip scripts and the Dump drops the ammo
Time to get wreck with the new style
It's '93 and MC's are gettin' buck wild
But I ain't a nigga
That's gonna get left with a big zero as a figure
I'm gonna end up with a big sum
'Cause if you don't like one jam, I always got another one
Different, specifically I don't copy
Tear up the track if the flow sounds sloppy
I don't play one game
I bust about a dozen cuts on my LP's, none the same
I ain't new to this, I ain't new to this
Never been new to this, nigga, new to this
I ain't new to this, fool, new to this
Fuck around and catch a left and a right fist
Boom bam, I drop fat slang
When I used to hustle, used to be down with the crack game
When I was young, I used to roll with a street gang
If you wanna squabble, muthafucka, it ain't no thang
I ain't new to this, I ain't new to this
Blow your dome, I hit quick as a pugilist
Ugh, ah, what's up? Now your eyes swoll'
Thought I went soft 'cause my records went gold
(Sucker)
Buster, you'se a muthafuckin' punk fool
Caught you in your eye while you reached for your tool
Now it's mine and you're blind
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop goes the nine
Yeah, what you're dissin' 'bout, friend?
Sayin' I went out but you ain't never been in
I got R E S P E C T in the industry
That's somethin' that you'll never see
I ain't new to this, I ain't new to this
Never been new to this, nigga, new to this
I ain't new to this, fool, new to this
Fuck around and catch a left and a right fist
They can get a smack for that
Yeah, yeah
On and on to the funk track
Back glass shakin' like shit, that's where the trunk's at
That's 'cause my shit's made for
Niggas that are hardcore
Brothers is quick to hook a left to your right jaw
Girls, come on, girls, come on, girls, come on
Get your clothes off and the fun on
Girls, come on, girls, come on, girls, come on
Get your clothes off and the fun on
It's time to check cash
Jump in my 4, hit the switch and lay the ass
While the Klan try to kill me
But I wrote 'riot' on my muthafuckin' will, gee
So when I'm gone, it's on
Caps goin' off on the streets like popcorn
Talkin' 'bout Simon till the early morn'
Word is bond but now I just cool
Bumpin' my Gang Starr tape by my pool
I ain't new to this
I ain't new to this, I ain't new to this
Never been new to this, nigga, new to this
I ain't new to this, fool, new to this
Fuck around and catch a left and a right fist
Check, check, I got problems with the press
Caught the punk in traffic, stabbed the sucker in his neck
(Ugh)
Punk reporter tried to diss me
(Ugh)
Now the muthafucka's history
(Ha)
I got to make a break hardcore fat tape
Word, I don't fantasize, I don't exaggerate
Just kick correct with the 1 2 mic check
Still quick to swing, take a sucker to the deck
I'm not the nigga you should step to like a sucker
Walk up talkin' shit, you best to be a good ducker
Your posse best to run from my gun
Keep my nine off safety and E holds the other one
(Yeah, sucker)
I ain't new to this, I ain't new to this
Never been new to this, nigga, new to this
I ain't new to this, fool, new to this
Fuck around and catch a left and a right fist

Fuck, fuck around and get your punk ass dropped

Pray,Gangsta Rap,2006.0,"Yah you know
Niggas don't really want drama
I'm just trying to live
Go out, hang out, have a little fun
Shit always gets wild, always

Its Saturday night
I'm rolling with my bitch and my niggas
Well known ghetto-grown Glock rocking street figures
Their cars trailing
I'm rolling in the front with my bitch for life
You can call her my wife
The four in the back in the blacked out 'lac
They high off the yak and they dusted too
Streets call 'em killers but I call them my crew
Some niggas wear red, my niggas wear blue
Step through the door, niggas can't help but feel us
Faggots tuck their jewels, bitches trying to see us
Led us to the back, put us up in a booth
Got vodka and cran, Jagermeifer to shoot
Coco started dancing, everything was fine
'Til some nigga said that table was supposed to be mine
I was feeling good, ain't paying him no mind
'Til the nigga got wild, threw a bottle of wine

3, 2, mother
3, 2, father
3, 2, sister
3, 2, brother
No time to pray

The shit just missed me and my niggas kicked in
Blade swing the razor and he opened his skin
These niggas wasn't having it, gangstas too
Mother fuckers started shooting, lighting up the room
(?) wore a vest and it went right through
They bodied Big Wrench, what the fuck Imma do?
Flip the table up, me and Coco hit the back door
These niggas wasn't done, these niggas want more
Fell off in the cut like a video game
Pulled my strap took my aim, make the door my frame
Everybody that stepped out, that body got flamed
I knew I was bleeding, I could feel the pain
Broke out, had to get behind the wheel
Running through the parking lot, Coc broke her heel
I started getting dizzy as I clenched my gat
I made it to my whip, I was shot in the back

3, 2, mother
3, 2, father
3, 2, sister
3, 2, brother
No time to pray
Jumped in the car, laid across the backseat
Coc grabbed the wheel, I was really starting to leak
Halfway out the lock got blocked, its back on
Some niggas in a blue Seville with a grill
Hopped in the stash by going for dolo
Its  extra big but it packs a fully auto
Blast through my own glass, should have heard the sound
It was on bitch, no time to roll shit down
Hit the corner, see my niggas Smitty and Mick
The was rolling toward the club when they heard 'bout the shit
Didn't have to tell 'em they just a block up the street
Cops on the way, still ain't throwing my heat
Don't even know why the fuck I'm out here dealing with beef
Just went out for some drinks in the club with my peeps
My two boys are dead, I seen 'em fall at my feet
And I'm shot the fuck up bleeding all on my seat",https://genius.com/Ice-t-pray-lyrics

Real,VI - Return of the Real,1996.0,"Ice-T VI: Return of the Real
Real is a word people don't really want to deal with
Real is the difference from the way things should be and the way things are
Things should be beautiful and everybody should get along
But things are really fucked up
Opportunity isn't available to everybody
Motherfuckers do go to jail
Men and women do not always get along
A woman doesn't think twice about referring to a man as a dog
But then breaks down when she's called a bitch
That's really fucked up
Real
The first four letters of reality
You ready to get there?
That's what it's all about
A lot of my homies are really incarcerated or locked up
In federal penitentiaries or state institutions and will never come home
This album is dedicated to them
And my homies that have died and passed on in the past few years
Really never get a chance to hear this record
My music is designed for the individuals out there who are ready to deal with the truth
The truth is that anything that is alive
Will do whatever it has to do to remain alive
It's called survival
And no matter how cold and fucked up it may seem
That's real",https://genius.com/Ice-t-real-lyrics
Iceapella,The Classic Collection,UnKnown,"Suckers step back, reacting his attack
Evil E's in the place, cold doggin' the wax!

All punks grab for your mothers, today's the day
I'm here to say warriors come out and play
Rhyme for your lives, weak run and hide
My name is Ice-T, L.A.'s where I reside
Fly as a bird, also awesome with herb
If you bite I will take your life best believe that's word
FBI's most wanted, but them suckers can't stop me
Mean rapping mother, terrorizing Qaddafi
Few tried to match the def raps I wrote
Dis my rhyme that's the time, razor meets your throat
Born in New Jersey but raised in L.A
Streets just as hard and the player's still play
Far from a fag, getting paid for my brag
So if you wanna come and battle bring a body bag
Definitely deadly and that ain't no Todd
And if you don't like what I'm saying, we can take it outside
'Cause ain't nothin' like a squabble 'cause you know I'ms fine
And if knife be your reason, then Uzi be mine
So all punks get ill cause you know I'm gonna
Rhymes that ignite bite like a piranha
Ice-T's just rockin' the tracks
And Evil E's in the place, just doggin' the wax!

I love the ladies who were down with the T
But what I hate and I state is a fool MC
You wanna battle the Ice, you gotta be insane
One step toward my reppin', I inflict the pain
Got so many raps, I got no place to store 'em
Got so many damn pages, I can wallpaper the Forum
Assassination, is my solution
No light operation, just massive contusions
Def dealing rhymer with a lust for blood
Conflict with the master and your name is mud
Kick it up, no mercy for the fact you're brave
I'll just bury your butt, then I'll spit on your grave
Laugh at your family as they stand and cry
Cold smack your mother all in the eye
'Cause I'll never get to heaven but you know damn well
I'll wear Bermuda shorts while I'm maxin' in hell
So all suckers step back, reacting the death's attack
Don't try to write me off, just talking like way smack
Because I'll leave a shamble, I hustle don't gamble
And I'll rock your butt blind like HBO scramble
Doggin' the wax!

Sharp as a razor, down as dirt
Rhyme is my life, party is my work
L.A. is my place, More Righteous is my base
So my lyrics make sense, no words I waste
Down for a duel, colder than Kool
Chill with the brothers who built the old school
Rhyme like a rocket, smooths in the pocket
Program the 808 and just lock it
Crash the studio with my crew, twenty four tracks mixed down to two
Jam hits the stores, packed kinds of floors
Freaks in my hotel room by the scores
This MC Ice-T, I rock the freaks to ecstasy
Take them to the T-O-P and bust them out officially
Never off, always on, rockin' to the break of dawn
Like this, like that, an MC that's not the whack
All rappers in the game, recognize my name
They write off as been lame, or get me credit for my fame
I'm here to make it clear, '86 is my year
I'm the rapper you should fear and I'll have to peer
Supreme MC Chief, and when I die in my belief
Battle from L.A. to Rome, rock beyond the Thunderdome
Sound hard, know why? It is, don't try
Only the top MCs will master this ability
If you do, you'll find out what that misword 
Or run that other , for high speed poetry
Take advice from Ice-T, leave the cuts to Evil E
Get a girl, feel the bass, rock her at this funky pace, ah!

I'm dialing M, for murdering fine MC's heads
Showing no remorse, reanimatin' the dead
Kicking dirt in the wombs, turning a wheel in the rap
I'll make you run for the hills with a streak up your back
My rhymes are my pigeons, stock cooler than cold
Boys always convincing, jewelry solid gold
Magnified finesse, a Hollywood address
The perpetrator, cremator, representing the West
Avenge is my best friend, homicide is my life
I write my rhymes in my book with blood on the knife
Never been beaten in life, never planned to beat
Either rocked two days straight before I take a breath
The rhymes, memorize them like inside my head
And anyone who dared bite somehow ends up dead
Got a license to kill, dogs refusing to chill
Uncut violence is my true thrill
I'm a hitman kinda sort of, suckers talk in manure
With co-cold man known tactics, no man can endure
Not to be mistaken, when MCs fakin'
All contracts issued, to Ice-T are taken, with the multitude routes
You have no chance to shout
With the silencer of a ninja, your lights are out
Girls cry to sight, some in Latin fight
For the post positions at my jam each night
The player from L.A., cooler than any Jay!
My name is Ice-T, I make the mafia pay!

Body Rock,The Classic Collection,UnKnown,"Let your body rock!
Let your body rock!
Let your body rock!

Hip-hoppin' is the thing that's in
It's where the stone-cold nitro parties begin
So listen party people with the ear to the street
The college professors and the social elite
To the fly young guys and the pretty girls
Ice-T is gonna tell you 'bout that hip-hop world

Hip-hoppin' is a way of life
With graffiti and rappin' on the mic
As the records scratch to the break of beat
A-hip-hop is sounds of the street
Hip-hop has been around a while
With the serious funk, the disco style
A record scratch, a simple rap
A breaker spinnin' on his back

Body Rock!
Body Rock!
Body Rock!

Now I don't care what people say
Hip-hop is here to stay
When the hip-hop scene first gained attention
They said it would die
They said it couldn't make it
They said it it'd never fly
Now everywhere for you to see
In movies, radio and TV
But the hip-hop scene has substance, unlimited dimensions
And it will live with or without mass media attention
'Cause it is not some fad created overnight
It is a cultural movement that's bred by city life
Now I'ma break it down for all of you
Who've never seen a hip-hop crew
The gangster cuts of cold DJs
Shockin' and rockin' 'til the break of day
Or the master arts of the graffiti man
Expressin' himself with his spray can
Yo people, what's it gonna be?
Hip-hop is makin' history
Now a hip-hop club is not a disco
It's a record-cuttin', cold-crushin' rappin' show
Like New York's Roxy, L.A.'s Radio
The DJs keep you at a peak and on the go
No three-piece suits allowed inside
T-shirts, tennis shoes, loosely tied
You hear scratchin' turntables across the floor
And DJs spin on two and sometimes four
Like this...

So when you listen to the music by your radio DJ
And listen to the rappers on the records that they play
And check out the graffiti that turns ghettos into art
Or watch the kids who dance on the street and in the park
We hope it's time you realize hip-hoppin' is the way
To find true peace in city streets in this cold world today
Let's dance, not fight, and all unite, just turn the box up loud
To the funky beat, on any street you'll find that hip-hop crowd

The Body Rock!
Keep your body rock!
Let your body rock!
Let your body rock!
Keep your body rock!
Let your body rock!

Just Body Rock!",https://genius.com/Ice-t-body-rock-lyrics
