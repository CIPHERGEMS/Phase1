Insane in the Brain,Black Sunday,1993.0,"Who you trying to get crazy with ése?
Don't you know I'm loco?


To the one on the flamboyant tip
I'll just toss that ham in the frying pan
Like spam, get done when I come and slam
Damn, I feel like the Son of Sam
Don't make me wreck shit, hectic
Next get the chair got me going like General Electric
""Aaaant"", the lights are blinking, I'm thinking
It's all over when I go out drinking
Ohh, making my mind slow
That's why I don't fuck with the big 4-O
Bro, I got to maintain
'Cause a nigga like me is going insane

Do my shit undercover, now it's time for the blubber
Blabber, to watch that belly get fatter
Fat boy on a diet, don't try it
I'll jack yo' ass like a looter in a riot
My shit's fat, like a sumo, slamming dat ass
Leavin your face in the grass
'Cause you know, I don't take a duro, lightly
Punks just jealous 'cause they can't outwrite me
Or kick that style, wicked, wild
Happy face nigga never seen me smile
Rip that mainframe, I'll explain
A nigga like me is going insane

Like Louie Armstrong, played the trumpet
I'll hit that bong and break you off something
Soon I got to get my props
Cops, come and try to snatch my crops
These pigs wanna blow my house down
Head underground to the next town
They get mad when they come to raid my pad
And I'm out in the nine-deuce Cad'
Yes I'm the pirate, pilot
Of this ship if I get with the ultraviolet dream
Hide from the red light beam
Now do you believe in the unseen?
Look, but don't make you eyes strain

How I Could Just Kill a Man,Cypress Hill,1991.0,"It's another one of them ol' funky Cypress Hill things
You know what I'm sayin?
And it goes like this

Hey don't miss out on what you're passin'
You're missin', the hoota of the funky Buddha
Eluder of your fucked up styles, I get wicked
So come on as Cypress starts to kick it
'Cause we're like the outlaw stridin', when suckers are hidin'
Jump behind the bush when they see me drivin'
By, hangin' out the window
With my Magnum takin' out some putos
Actin' kinda loco, I'm just another local
Kid from the street gettin' paid from my vocals
[Hook: B-Real & 
Sen Dog

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand

I'm ignorin' all the dumb shit
Yo, because nothing is comin' from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fuckin' around
My gat straight hummin'
Hummin'... comin' at cha...
And you know I had to gat ya

Time for some action, just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance to run the interference
Into your satellite, shinin' a battle light
Sen got the gat, and I know that'll gat ya right
Here's an example, just a little sample
How I could just kill a man!
One-time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said ""Yo, it's on
Take cover son, or you're assed-out
How you like my chrome?"" Then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast out, but I did anyway...
Hahaha... that young punk had to pay
So I just killed a man!

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I have to establish
To light my spliff, ignite ya with insights
And if you ain't down: bullshit!
Say some punk try to get you for your auto
Would you call the one-time, play the role model?
No, I think you play like a thug
Next ya hear the shot of a Magnum slug
Hummin', comin' at cha
Yeah ya know I'm gonna gat ya
So how do ya know where I'm at, when you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm comin' from?
When you're up on the hill in your bigger home
I'm out here riskin' my dome
Just for a bucket, or a fast ducat
Just to stay alive, ay yo I gotta say ""fuck it""

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand

Pick it, pack it, fire it up, come along
And take a hit from the bong
Put the blunt down just for a second
Don’t get me wrong it’s not a new method
Inhale, exhale
Just got a ounce in the mail
I like a blunt or a big fat cone
But my double barrel bong is gettin’ me stoned
Home skillet, there’s water inside don’t spill it
It smells like shit on the carpet, still it
Goes down smooth when I get a clean hit
Of the skunky funky smelly green shit
Sing my song, puff all night long
As I take hits from the bong

Hits from the bong y’all
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?

Let’s smoke that bowl, hit the bong
And then take that finger off of that hole
Plug it, unplug it, don’t strain
I love you 
Mary Jane
She never complains, when I hit Mary
With that flame, I light up the cherry
She’s so good to me
When I pack a fresh bowl I clean the screen
Don’t get me stirred up the smoke, through the bub-bling
Water is makin’ it pure so I got ta’
Take my hit and hold it, 
just like
Chong
, I hit the bowl and I reload it
Get my four-footer and bring it on

Eat the worm motherfucker
Tequila spice, hot nice
Feeling right, 
sipping on Jose Cuervo
Down in Tiajuana, Mexico
Thinking of the big score the night before
Met the connect, who was impressively dressed
In high fabrics
With troops like Beirut, up on the mezzanine
Brandishing sub-machine guns, aye-yo
It's all about the money, son
Now that's the only reason
We came south of the border, to complete this work order
We gotta get it, no looking back, going all out for it
Ready to attack, die in a minute flat for it
As God is my witness, we got ditches
For all you motherfuckin fake bitches
It all boils down to the business
Nothing personal, when niggas acting like they helping you
I fuckin blast you like Frank Castle, motherfucker!

Tequila Sunrise
, bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die
So get the money nigga!
Tequila Sunrise, bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die
So get the money nigga!

I never knew money like this, in the palm of my hand
'Til I met the man with mad hook-up, and big plan
Every where you look'a, he got everybody shook up
Running for cover, the big bad WOOF, motherfucker
He was like a father figure, show me the bigger picture
Fuck slangin' on the corner, don't let the pigs get you
Not like these fools who don't comprehend
You end up doing a twenty-five bit in the pen
You got that? Getting your cup, I took a swig
The bitter taste of the 'mezcal', free worm shit
Droppin' a lesson, he slapped my face, he said listen
Pay attention brotha, you're my ace, but don't ever question
Just do what I say, and you'll be rich
And keep this in your mind: rats lay in a ditch with no spine
Don't ever forget that golden rule in the game
Cheers, they all know your name, it's like fame
Why, women and money don't mix, like drinking an' driving
Watch those conniving women and keep your eye out
Always be aware of what's around you
They wanna down you, and fuckin' clown you
Keep your shit in order the money won't stop
Pretty soon you'll be on top

Tequila Sunrise, bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die
So get the money nigga!
Tequila Sunrise, bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die
So get the money nigga!

Tequila Sunrise, with the bloodshot eyes
My, my, my, how time flies and goes by, surprise!
My mentor passed on and passed a warn to me, emergency
For my enemies who wanna murder me
Eat the worm, mothafucka, while you burn, mothafucka
Better kill me, don't let me return, mothafucka
Trust no man, cause I'll be back, you understand?
With a plan, and my 
ice
 in hand, I want it all
I recall the words from Jesus, you are the Juice
Better go get it, don't let it get to your head, embed it
Let these words stick, you better be ready to die
Now take a fucking sip, caution it, but I never lie

Tequila Sunrise, bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die
So get the money nigga!

Yo, so where is he man? You know?
He said he‘d be here, homies
Damn, he’s a little late but,  he’ll be here, just wait

Fuck 'em! And feed 'em, cause I don't need 'em
I won't join 'em if I can beat 'em
They don't understand my logic

I never wanted to hurt a nigga

That grave on the east side of towwwwn
Lay ya six feet undergrounnnnd

Click-clack, barrel at my dome
Give all your loot or you ain't goin' home

Motherfuckers be drivin' me up the walls
Hopin' that I fall but they can lick my balls
Straight jacket, strap it
In a padded room when some punk niggas can't hack it
Distracted from all reality
Now I'm let out on a minor technicality
(Ahhh) They all fucked up now
Cause they let a nigga back on the streets somehow
I'm lookin' for someone like me
Livin' in my own world to my own degree
On the loose in the city lookin' at the ho wit' the big titties
Lookin' at me and I feel shitty
A little tensed up gettin' hot
Cause she looks like my girl who got smoked at the crack spot
I'm tryin' to find ways to cope
But I ain't fuckin' round with the gauge or a rope

I Wanna Get High,Black Sunday,1993.0,"I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high

Well it's the funk elastic, the blunt I twist it
The slamafied, Buddha-fied funk on your discus
Oh, what you missed this, you got to bear witness
Catch a ho and another ho, Merry Christmas
Yes I smoke shit, straight off the roach clip
I roach it for the blunted ones to approach it
Forward motion, make you sway like the ocean
The herb is more than just a powerful potion
What's the commotion, yo I'm not joking around
People learning about, what they're smoking
My oven's on high, when I roast the quail
Tell Bill Clinton to go and inhale
Exhale, now you felt the funk of the Thai
Wanna feel the effects...
I want to get high–so high!
I want to get high–so high!
I want to get high–so high!
I want to get high–so high!

(Rock) Superstar,Skull & Bones,2000.0,"Alot of a...sharks out there...try'na take a bite of somethin'
What's hot
Lot of chameleons out there...try'na change up
Anytime somethin' new comes along...everybody wants a bite
Don't happen overnight

So you wanna be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, 5 cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust no body
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

I remember the days when I was a young kid growin' up
Looking in the mirror dreamin' about blowin' up
The rock crowd, make money, chill with the honey's
Sign autographs or whatever the people want from me
Shit's funny how impossible dreams manifest
And the games that be comin' with it, nevertheless
You got to go for the gusto but you don't know
About the blood, sweat and tears and losing some of your peers
And losing some of yourself to the years past gone by
Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac and the brainiac don't know how to act
Shit's deep, 48 tracks
Studio gangster mack signed the deal, thinks he's gonna make a mil'
But never will 'til he crosses over
Still filling your head with fantasies
Come with me, show the sacrifice it takes to make the cheese
You wanna be a rock superstar in the biz?
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games but the price of fame is high
And some can't pay the way
Still trapped in what you rappin' about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The route you took started collapsing
No fans, no fame, no respect, no change, no women
And everybody shits on your name

So you wanna be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, 5 cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust no body
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
So you wanna be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, 5 cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust no body
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

People see rockstars, younawhaI'msayin?
But you still...try'na...get out more like, like everybody else
It's a fun job, but it's still a job
Save your money man, save your money too
Hit single don't last very long, younawhaI'msayin?
I mean...you're lucky in this game too
There's gon' be another cat comin' out
Lookin' like me, soundin' like me, next year I know this
They'll be a flipside, do whatchu you do
Somebody'll try to spin off like some series

You ever have big dreams of makin' big cream?
Big shot, heavy hitter on the mainstream
You wanna look shanty in the Bentley
Be a snob and never act friendly
You wanna have big fame, let me explain
What happends to these stars and their big brains
First they get played like all damn day
Long as you sell everything will be O.K
Then you get dissed by the media and fans
Things never stay the same way they began
I heard that some never give full to the fullest
That's while fools end up dining on the bullet
Think everything's fine in the big time
See me in my Lex' with the chrome raised high
So you wanna roll far and live large?
It ain't all that goes with bein' a rockstar

So you wanna be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, 5 cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust no body
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
So you wanna be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, 5 cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust no body
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

My own son don't know me
I'm chillin' in the hotel room lonely
But I thank God I'm with my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home
But only no radio or video didn't show me
No love, the phony, gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by Sony
I'm in the middle like Monie
And the press say that my own people disown me
And the best way back is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
They're too worried about them honies at the Paladium
Who just wanna cling on, swing on, and so on
Go on, fall off, the hoes roll on
'Til the next rock superstar with no shame
Give him a year, he'll be right out the game
The same as the last one who came before him
Gained fame, started gettin' ignored, I warned him
Assured him, this ain't easy take it from Weezy
Sleezy people wanna be so cheesy, the fuckin' lethal
""Assassins, assassins""

So you wanna be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, 5 cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust no body
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

Rolling around nine deuce cadillac
Still got my homies to watch my back
And they'll smoke your ass if you wanna come and chat
That's why some pigs and the kids come sweating they follow

Why wallow when you come to roll on I put the clip in the four five
Bring your ass on, left kicking dust as you hear the gat bust
My cribs surrounded, I'm about to get rushed, I brushed with death
How many shells stuffed in my closet where my big chrome things kept

When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)

Hot damn I didn't want to kill a man shit
I still stand tall with the hill clan ya'll better stand back

Come one come all and see how it's done
If you see the pigs there's no need to run
Cause some of these pigs are down with Greenthumb

Don't front on me, baby boy, and break bread with the sack (low-ri-der)

I be the vato with the fine hoodrat in the ranfla
Always roll deep on the streets like the mafia
Pleito, just might come back and haunt ya
Flossin' too much, no vato's gonna want ya
Not right here homes, we're past all of that
Makin' that feria, spittin' that raps
Ya me conoces, I'm down for my calle
Cypress Ave, y el puro desmadre (low-ri-der)
Ya tu sabes, we don't play that shit
Any pendejo's gettin' hit up quick
Wassup ese? What hood you claim?
Now throw it up and down like it ain't no thang (low-ri-der)
Hands in the air with the pinky rings
Soul Assassins, runnin' everything
To all you vatos, make sure you check this
In every barrio, I'm well respected (low-ri-der)

Aww, comin' through fo' real we Cypress Hill, ohh baby
Got that crunk, for yo' trunk, goin' gangsta crazy
We some real life hustlers, playin' games in the street (low-ri-der)
We got that low-ri-der, scrapin', dippin' on three
So pop yo' collar, give a holla, throw the dubs in the air (low-ri-der)
We tear the roof, off the mother, lady let down yo' hair
Playa do that thang, that make you feel alright (low-ri-der)
Smoke that tree, crack that brew, we gettin' freaky tonight

Hand on the Pump,Cypress Hill,1991.0,"Well I'm an alley cat, some say a dirty rat
On my side is my gat, see I'm all of that
Spittin' out buck shots, boy I'm gonna wet'cha
Run and hide, but I'm still comin' to get'cha
Thinkin' like a peace smoke, comin' on a homicide
You talkin' shit, tryna take me for a ride
I'm not a bad guy, but I'm the funky feel
Finger on the trigger when my hands up on a steel
Lettin' out a bullet, this is goin' boo-ya
You're stuck in my hood, so what ya gonna do now?
Bein' the hunted one is no fun
Here I come son, yo I think ya better run
Better run more, and move a little faster
Second of thought and I'm comin' to blast ya
With my...

Sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump
Left hand on a forty, (Puffin' on a blunt)
Pumped my shotgun, (Niggas didn't jump)
Lala la la lala la laaaaa...

Comin' at you like a stiff blow, fuckin' up your program
Ain't takin' shit from you him or no man
Master mind maniac and a menace, soooo
How they want to pass the sentence
All because a nigga tried to play me on the trigger
He missed, so now the nigga's hist
Rude and crude like a pit bull, get to the point
Your fuckin' card will get pulled, now
I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And I'm handin' out beatdowns
I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And I'm handin' out beatdowns (Get your face down!)
Put me in chains, try to beat my brains
I can get out, but the grudge remains
When I see ya punk ass, I'm gonna getcha
Get some through ya, shotgun go boo-yaa!

Sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump
Left hand on a forty, (Puffin' on a blunt)
Pumped my shotgun, (Niggas didn't jump)

Kickin' that funky Cypress Hill shit
Think I'll light another for the blunted to chill with
'Cause I'm the chill one, known to get ill when
They stepped to the Hill ""What's up?"", I had to kill one
Now I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And they got me on lock down
Headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And they got me on lock down
Livin' like a nigga who done lost his mind
'Cause I ain't goin' out like a spineless jellyfish
Some say life is a bitch
Ask that punk who dug his own ditch
Up on the Hill fuckin' up at a party
Tried to get funny, put a hole in his body
Lala la la lala la laaa
Look at all of those funeral cars
'Cause I'ma

It's round two
I got my lunch and my dinner, fool
You think we gonna bow down to some punk ass niggas
We from the evil side, boy
Chorus: B-Real 
Doughboy , Wack 10 
Doughboy , Wack 10 
Doughboy , Wack 10 
Doughboy , Wack 10 

In about four seconds some east side niggas
Is gonna put the foot in the ass of Doughboy and Wack 10
I suggest you stay tuned muthafuckas

It takes two of you faggots to get with one of me
Now I'm running up in you hoes with ""No Vaseline""
You could be the big fish, bring your drama
Fuck your mama, I'll bring the pack of piranhas
You tried to pull a ditty, ho
But you the one who got the alternative rockers up in your video
You get addicted
You can take your four W fingers
And stick it in Mack 10's ass and lick it
Ice Cube is a thing of the past
If I got no nuts it's because they're still stuck in your ass
You're the King of punks, king of busters, king of thieves
Now get down of your fuckin' knees (Shag: Bow Down)
Start to sucking
You tried to remake N.W.A. without Dre and Ren
Dub's cool, but you're fuckin' up with Mack 10
Silly little philly, I'm back tearing'
Can you really see my machine gun turrets?
Open and aimed at your fat little frame
How can I miss?
I'll twist your cap and take your name
Analyze it, my name should be Mack 11
I'm a higher caliber MC, there's no question
Anytime you wann run up you get dealt with
You get melted 
""Check Yo' Self"" (bitch check it)
Ice Cube, you better tell'em (tell 'em mutha-fucka)
Muggs made the best songs on your third album (biatch!)

You and Wack 10
Can't deal with this
Cypress Hill to the muthafuckin' fullest
Fuck y'all
So what'cha wanna do?
Bring it on, nigga
This is Shag from the Neighborhood Family

Mack 10 is a bitch, suckin' Ice Cube's dick
But what you faggots know about some gangsta shit?
 (B-Real: Nothin)
Let's take it to the streets and fight like real g's
What you niggas wanna do? You can't fuck with these
Ain't never had a strap now you wanna gangsta rap
Can't come to your hood cause you're scared to get jacked
Fuck peace, this is war everybody on the floor
When I see your fat ass I'm takin' one to your jaw
Fuck you Fuck your mama fuck your whole clique
Better yet, fuck every nigga that you're down wit'
Unoriginal, can't stand bitch made niggas
Ice Cube, you'se an actor not a muthafuckin' killa
What neighborhood you from? what don't you ever done?
When the shit goes down you the first one to run
Every time you talk got a mouth full of drama
Only missing you done is going to church wit'cha mama..

You got the Real-a Swingi' of my nuts Cube Killa
Break yourself niga, huh! Give a lick-a you ain't a killa
You a busta muthafucka 
bitch made niggas
I never trust ya --Cube's ""Can't trust 'em""--
Hoes like you can't figure out where you're from
Are you from South Central, the Westside or Compton?
Mack 10, the only thing you hoggin' on
Is Ice Cube's nuts now he's all in your guts
You wanna be like him but you got no skills
If he's the king you must be the queen of the Hill
But I shank the Cube's fat neck cause 
""A Bitch Iz A Bitch""
And a bitch don't get no respect
No doubt Westside connections means
Ice Cube's stickin' his dick in Mack 10's mouth (Aahhh!)
All of your homies are down wit' my clique
Why you always gotta be bitin' my shit
And you don't know one bitch on my dick
But yours is best get a blood test for your kid
Only bangin' you done was with toy figures
Your mama wouldn't let you hang with real g niggas
Bring your clique on you wanna scrap
So let's get it on (bullets for some chingazos, ese!)
Mack 10 I give you a year I guarantee
You'll realize that you're getting' fucked and you'll run to me
You pretty little trick, you look real sweet (Mmmm!)
I should make you one of my hoes like Cube was for Eazy
Doughboy, you're fuckin' around wit' the real Cuban
I'm no fictional Scarface movie land bullshit, actor, studio gangsta
You should win an award For most outstanding wax banger
Fuck what you been through, what you're going through
East Side family, nigga What you wanna do?

Eastside!
That's right nigga!
East muthafuckin' side
'Til' we die, nigga!
Fuck all you punk ass niggas!

Take your toke from the

Now let it out
How you feel when the herb
Got you by the balls

Like them on the purp that's blazed, I don't say a word
You don't wanna follow me, son

You just wanna swerve with a little herb, absurd

Got a pair of Jordan's dancin' on your fuckin' face
Paralyzed, see the paranormal paratroops
Summoned by the Grandmaster as he prepares to loose
Temple doors open up, smoke billows out
Now you hoping, what, for mercy? Get your soul brilloed out
From another hood, you ain't really fuckin' with our brotherhood
Even if another could, I wish a motherfucker would

Wicked as you ever seen
Heavy on the throttle
Smoke when we hit the scene, rollin' unseen
Under the cover of night
Spirit flying free, niggas higher than a kite
You got nothing on me, we some nomads
And my clan goes way back to the Cro-Mags
Run together, unbreakable bloodline
Too much to fuck with when all the brothers combine
Everything you ever heard of is not a myth
Crazy dogs you don't ever wanna deal with
Which smell? It's the hash that we left around
Smoke a whole pound when I feel myself comin' down
Live how I wanna live and answer to no one
Similar to the ways of the shogun
Think again before you try and come and get me
Or you'll be shot up by a gang of gypsies (shot)

Get your lips ready & 
tear this motherfucker up!

Cube, better step back and check yourself!

Hmmm... let's talk about this
First solo album on the east coast dick
The east coast niggas all showed ya love
Especially the one known as King Sun
He tried to warn us niggas about ya
But nobody would listen
Even began dissin'
Two albums later, you callin' my crew
All because ya wannabe Cypress Cube (No way, motherfucker!)

Good boy went to school out in the valley

Where everybody was going insane
Took a look at the Real one: afro gone
The next morning, you didn't have yours on
How many ways will you bite my shit?
Would ya wet me or start throwing up a set?
Caution, when you enter the zone
Never used to bang 'til you heard the microphone (Studio gangsta!)
I got Cube melting in a Tray
Pulling up his card and fucking up his ""good day""
Unoriginal rap veteran...
The nigga who say he don't steal from his friends (""I don't steal from my friends!"")

To understand what it's like
But you always gotta
People always gotta see you smile
You always gotta put on that fake...
You know what I'm sayin'?
No matter what you just been through
Shit has gotta be right""

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

I remember the days when I was a young kid growin' up
Lookin' in the mirror dreamin' about blowin' up
To rock crowds, make money
Chill with the honeys
Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me
Shit's funny
How impossible dreams manifest
And the games that be comin' with it
Never the less you got to go for the gusto
But you don't know about the blood sweat and tears
And losin' some of your peers
And losin' some of your self
Through the years past, gone by
Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac and the brainiac
Don't know how to act
Shit's deep
48 tracks
Studio gangsta mack
Signed a deal, thinks he's gonna make a mil'
But never will
'Til he crosses over, still
Fillin' your head with fantasies
Come with me
Show the sacrifice it takes to make the cheese
You wanna be a rap superstar in the biz
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games
But the price of fame is high
And some can't pay to play
Feelin' trapped in
What you rappin' about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The route you took started collapsin'
No fans, no fame
No respect, no change
No women
And everybody shits on your name

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

When you sign to a record label
You don't know you sign your life over
And these white boys don't care about you
'Cause the minute you fall off
They'll find another Noreaga
And they'll find another Capone-N-Noreaga
And they'll find another B-Real
So you need to just keep
Stack your chips up
Do what you gotta do while you hot
And motherfuckin' get out the game
Just stick to the drug game
It's even worse because in the drug game
If somebody jerk you
You can shoot 'em and kill 'em and
If you, in this game if somebody jerk you
You gotta be humble

No matter what you just been through
Shit has gotta be right
You gotta approach people
You gotta be on the up and up
And everything's gotta be all good
When you see someone, slap hands with 'em
You know what I'm sayin'
Give 'em a pound or whatever it is, you know
But you always gotta act like it ain't shit

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

My own son don't know me
Sittin up in the hotel room lonely
But I thank God I'm wit my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home
But only no radio or videos
Cuz they show me no love
The phony gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by Sony
I'm in the 
middle like Monie
And the press say that
My own people disown me
And the best way back
Is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
Your crew worried about them honies at 
The Palladium
Who just wanna cling on and swing on
And so on and go on and fall off
The hoes fall off
To the next rap superstar
Wit no shame give him a year
And they'll be right out the game
The same as the last one
Who came before him
Gained fame
Started gettin ignored
I warned him
Assured him
This ain't easy take it from Weezy
Sleezy people wanna be cheesey
They talkin evil

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-rap-superstar-lyrics

Direct with the biggest, fattest joint
Comin in with indo flavors
Fuckin buddha comin at'cha like this

It's, Friday mornin, where the weed at?
Let me dip into my pocket for my fat weed sack
Cause I wanna get high like a plane
In the sky, with the indo cloud in my brain
Where the fuck are my zig-zags and my lighters?
So I can roll it and set it on fire
Damn, I wish I had scissors cause the shit is so sticky
That it's gettin on my fuckin fingers
But it's smokeable, double tokeable
I got the one-hitter quitter bombay shit that's tokeable
I wanna do a joint venture
Let me make sure there ain't no lump in the god damn center
Impregnated lookin joint, fuck it
I can smoke it and I still get faded

Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up
Inhale, exhale

(East Coast hittin that blunt), West Coast hittin that honeydip
Marijuana joint, then I want another hit
Roll it up, (light it up), smoke it up
I wanna stimulate my mind (so I toke it up)
Can I get a hit? (Can I get a hooh!?)
Gimme that fat bag of weed and the brew
So I can get faded, elevated
Smoke the joint down to a roach then I ate it
I stand true to the yesca, mota
As I keep runnin from the Chota
Gimme dat weed fool and ya zig-zags

In the midst of the madness no question, who's the baddest
MC's in the game runnin for the status
Take a few seconds to review the crews
Sittin on top is the Hill lookin over you
Killa Hill Niggas, cream in my dream
Cookin up a scheme for all them big bank figures
The world is yours
, but it can be mine and his
Bust you out the frame, I don't give a fuck who it is
Number one mission, opposition
Get thrown sent home in dead position
In the casket, best wishes
At the bottom of the lake, sleepin with the fishes
Full out search for the body
Of the MC's who be comin to disrupt the party
No wins, no ends, no way
That I'm ever gonna let ya come back again!

Check my dramatics, brains get splattered, dreams shattered
Sabas get blasted for words he packaged
Peep the sequence; crab adolescents, on his defense
Power-U niggas talkin fast like Puerto Ricans
What you seekin, son I catch cream like Dominicans
Last Mohican, lyrics I'm speakin, wild as Indians
Tomahawk - Shaolin slang, the violent talk
Upstate New York, where chumps get extorted for Newports
What you thought?

Ease back, ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger

Ease back, ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger

From a dune in the desert Mega-Babylon pleasure
Comin out the domepiece, smell my aroma
Warrior nomad, put you in a coma
Comma, llama, smash-crashin your armor
Drama, I'm a, stealth aircraft bomber
Here is where I dwell at the gates o' hell
It ain't where you're from it's where you're in the mentals
And if not yo, credentials are essential
I see reality, few things surroundin me
Three like a spread, precise strikes the lyric
Not frontin or braggin, hundred percent red dragon
Pine fragranced lyrics, the rhymes you can't imagine
The globe-trotter, call me Meadowlark Lemon
Five part criminal, two part felon

Bust how we gonna bounce off this ninety-five Soul Assassins Cypress Hill joint
Yo we want everybody out there to throw their hands up
So get it on kid!

Fresh is the word, when I display
My rappin forte quicker done than O.J.,
Hey I freaks my shit, E the lyrical master
Stress me out, no doubt, I might have to blast ya
Let me ask ya, can I gets busy one time?
And unwind and chill, with Cypress Hill
Huh, I go on with my bad self
I'm the four pound toter, the Phil blunt smoker
Believe me not, I'm wicked like three sixes
I'm doper than the Pete Rock remixes
Never walk through the crowd sluggish
I'm hardcore to the Bone, I'm Thuggish Ruggish
The Green-Eyed, Bandit, I be Errrick Serrrmon
I gets real determined
And one for the trouble, and two for the bass
I take it to your face with this here lyrical mace
And if you don't know, y'all better recognize
I'm coming through with speed, with pounds of weed

Ahh shit, another one of those gangsta hits
Niggas wanna get busy with the ultimate
Fools get real, yo I'm representin the Hill
With chips and clips and tons of blue steel
So who wants to be the first nigga to die?
Then try and test this, buddha blessed Gemini
You get thrown sent home in a coffin
Punks don't make it back very often
I got Erick to take care of the Sermon
Ashes to ashes, dust, bodies burnin
Bustin open the doors to the temple
Takin' you to the dark side of your mental

Kickin it to the brothers on the corners, in the alleys
Throw your hands in the air
Kickin it to the brothers on the corners, in the alleys
Throw your hands in the air (x2)

I rhyme tricky, the sticky smoka with the mind itchy
Finger up on the pen, be like ""He the bomb, dicky!""
These off-keys MC's hawk me, they won't get off me
So I kill em softly and use em as walkie talkies *bzzzzt*
Turn up my level adjust my voice pitch
Hoist this diagnosis, comatosis
Is what I leave your crew with
Boom bip or some two and two shit
Raw silk, cuz YOU DO IT TO MY MUSIC
*Funk Doctor Spock* lock the hypest
Individual, to put criminal in diapers
With my nigga E and Cypress, what I write bitch
You swore, it was a nuclear war, crisis
In your back yard, word to God, Def Squad!
With my nigga Keith in the place takin charge
Word up you'll get hurt up like the jury callin murder
You're deaf cuz I freak shit you neva heard of

Kickin it to the brothers on the corners, in the alleys
Throw your hands in the air
Kickin it to the brothers on the corners, in the alleys
Throw your hands in the air (x2)

Steppin to the park in the Hill, you can't hang
The original baby gangsta on this Compton thang
Don't slip, the late night hype, is when I dip
Boo-yaa is the sound from a lonely clip
Can't feel me, if I was crack you'd try to steal me
Heard you, and your little crew, wanna peel me
Keep your hands on your hood, you get got
The Green-Eyed Bandit, Cypress Hill, and the Funk Doctor Spock
You wish you could hang, like I hang
Dwells in the C-P-T, the hood thing
G, the trigga finger, I'mma get you
Hit you, the Tech 9, I'mma split you
Ain't no poppin, no stoppin
Tick to the tock, tick tock I hit your block-and
Throw your hands in the air, don't bite this
I squeeze, nigga please, the E down with Cypress

Yes I know that you can't withstand it
Watch that ass cause punk I'll brand it
With a steel-toe, how you feel now

Cry on a pillow, weepin ass willow

Round and round (round and round), the reefer blows
Far and wide (come on), high and low

Swim the sky, here we go
Round and round, the reefer blows

As it travels through your lungs back out, I see it swirl
Now you're feeling I'm without a care in the world (Once again)
But that's what happens when you come see the doctor
I don't care what the feds say, fucking cockblockers
I live in reefer land, I grow a little reefer and you wanna get high?
I'll make you fly like Peter Pan
On cloud nine no one but the reefer can
I'm the reefer king of Cali known as Reefer Man
I recommend you don't tell a friend, they will buy it out
Then they never leave you nothing in the end
I could never grow enough, so people want my secret
But you don't get to peep it, you're in danger if you seek it

Round and round (round and round), the reefer blows (The reefer blows)

I have so many different strains to choose
I break 'em down in samples
Make sure you get the one you want and know what you can handle
Got the indo (yeah) and sativa (uh-huh), gonna make you a believer (That's right)
Yeah my brand is off the meter and the flavor so much sweeter (Oh, shit, me?)
You wanna blow some trees, you wanna smoke some real shit?
Put it in the paper, roll it with the Phuncky Feel Tip
Then put it in the air, smoke rises 'till the heavens ash
Falls to the ground, cash, doubles up in seconds (Ahh)
OG Kush from Cali from the Valley to the Playground
People on the street wanna call this one the lay-down (Lay down)
The hydro's so heavy like a '57 Chevy
Heavy, feeling ready for a steady dose as the reefer blows

Hmm she's fine, son que fresca
Here homes have a hit of this yesca
Teach you enseño, el leño lo prendo
Now you know, that I am in the centro

Vatos waitin' on me, along with the heinas
Catchin' all the sweat for what I said to one-timer
So when you see me at the party or the baile

Had an attitude while you tried to play me macho
Just relax, calmado mijo

Dead in the middle of the twilight zone
Losin' my mind, so high, no lie
Can't tell if I'm in a dream, my, oh my
If I die tonight, I'ma get high tonight
Not sure I'll survive the night
Now I sweat, can't see straight
Now I start to hallucinate
Still way so crazed, you know it now
If you come at me, better slow it down
I'm about to snap, don't come close
Got a strap on the lap, ratta-tat-tat
Po-Po's comin', I'm on the run
With sun on my back and my elephant lungs

Don't ask me 'cause I don't know
Where I came from or where's my home
If I seem uptight, you ain't wrong

Pa'la Salud
Primero Yo!!
ARRGH!!!! (Mexican Yell)
Cometelo!!!!!!!

Aqui estoy con mi barrio listo a hacer feria
Cartel Cypress Hill esta en tu area
Colectando queso allá en Mexico
Donde el sol quema duro y baja despacio
Tengo mis camaradas y todo esta bien
Tengo una mansion en tierra que mide cien
Y todos se den cuenta vengo a hacer transas
Como Chalino aqui estoy pa'la raza
Me veen en mi ranfla con todos los hierros
Cuidando mi negocio con todo mi perro
No trates nada tengo mis soldados
Espiritu asesino vienen preparados
Raperos desperados es nuestro tema
El dicho de nosotros Agarra La Crema

Tequila Sunrise
Con los ojos rojos un dia vamos a morir
Escandalosos!!

Nunca conoci dinero asi, En mis manos
Hasta que conoci, un camarada como hermano
No importa donde miro, Tiene a todos asustados
Corriendo por cubres, Por mas que vende amarrados
Pero como guerrillero me enseno la foto grande
Asi vendiendo drogas, Jamas nunca antes
No como rateros, Que no entienden no comprenden
No pases anos torcidos con placas en tu frente
Entiendes??, Me dio una copa y tome
El sabor malo del gusano me jame, Dandome lecciones
Me cacheteo y dijo mira, Eres mi mejor paisa
Pero nunca me digas, Lo que digo y te hago
Rico Chico, Que hasta duermen en hoyos
No me cruces o te pico
Que no se te olviden las reglas del juego
Te van a conocer hasta que quemes en el fuego
Mujeres falsas y dinero no va
Como tomando manejando mi hermano te matara
Quedate alerta a lo que esta alrededor
Esas cosas que dije van a ser tu matador
Tenlo todo en orden, La plata no va a parar
Recuerdate de mi y siempre vas a ganar


Tequila Sunrise, ay ay ay
Tiempo vuela rapido y by surprise
Mi pana se murio y a mi me dejo
Capitan de la movida aqui, digo yo
Tragate el gusano cabron, Soy el maton
Si no me matas te mato a ti, Como un ladron
Confia en nadie, Vengo pa'atras y jamas me cruces a mi
Porque yo, Tengo mas, Me recuerdo lo que digo Jesus
Si quieres el dinero, Paisa, Tienes que ser primero
Que te peguen mis palabras
Estas listo pa' morir, A todo tiempo
Porque si no, Vas a sufrir",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-tequila-sunrise-spanish-version-lyrics

You smokin' up, Rasta nuh sprinkle dust
Too much ecstasy, make man a exodus
Too much fantasy, can't come next to us
Fi di ganja we always notorious
So just answer me, if you feel glorious
We have weed inna cakes and Oreo's
Believe me though, better than your Marlboro
You want my roll, on someone you hardly know
This Marley bro a tell unno fi take it slow
You tell me no, say you want to star the show
Like who? 
Johnny Depp and you want to blow
You short a breath, that means you are far below
You start to take, substances up in your nose

Cloud nine ah where you find me
Some boy wan reach, cloud ninety
We're smokin' like a genie
The skunky and the greenie

On the ganja bus, they comin' after us
We makin' stops all over Los Angeles
On the block, where the weed that get scandalous
When we run around, police can't handle us
They wanna clout the bus, and on the top be us
They never wanna come around, just a rowdy bunch
Tengo el poder, tu no aguantas
Yo sé, que el juego es dificil para usted
Despiertate, no dejes tu gente ver
Tu situación cuando no puedes mantener
En fuerza que nosotros, enseñale
Deja tu vida sin rastros, escondete
Portate

And if you want we can jet through Montego bay

Cuando fumo yo no juego, pásame el fuego
Me lo fumo todo, quememe los dedos

Antes que nada, yo quemo un pipaso
Enamorado con la yerba buena
Comida cubana y las nalgas morenas
Todas las nenas saben que yo tengo
Las colitas, vete en mi leńo
No hay nadie que me quite el vicio

Mundo entero quiero que me entiende

I only want your cash crop, not your life jack

Well this pig worked at the station
This pig he killed my Homeboy
So the fuckin' pig went on a vacation
This pig he is the chief
Got a brother pig, Captain O'Malley
He's got a son that's a pig too
He's collectin' pay-offs from a dark alley

While some motherfucker's out robbin' your home
This pig he's a big punk
And I know that he can't stand the sight of me
'Cause pigs don't like it when ya act smart
And when ya tell 'em that your a group from society
This pig works for the mafia
Makin' some money off crack
But this little pig got caught
So when he gets to the pen it's all about the pay-back
'Cause once he gets to the pen
They won't provide the little pig with a bullet-proof vest
To protect him from some mad nigga
Who he shot in the chest and placed under arrest
An' it's all about bacon or sausage
Do ya feel sorry for the poor little swine?
Niggas wanna do him in the ass
Just ta pay his ass back, so they're standin' in line

What’s Your Number?,Till Death Do Us Part,2004.0,"Let's go

I met her at the club, her friend liked me but she didn't
She noticed a lot of girls giving up their phone digits
She didn't wanna be one of those hoes
In clothes exploiting her body from head to toes
She had glossy lips she was swaying her hips
On the dance floor and every nigga's flashing her grip
Trying to impress her in vain she gave no play
Niggas hit her up for numbers and she said no way
I thought to myself let it go and roll on, B
But like Smokey said she really had a hold on me
I couldn't stop staring I started to fantasize with her
Voices in my head said she's tantalizing ya
Even if I moved to the other side of the party
I had pictures in my head of her moving that body
I was beside myself with hunger pain
So I slowly walked over and I asked her name

What's your name, what's your number?
I would like to get to know you
Can we have a conversation?
The night is young, girl give me a chance!

She gave a smile but I got no answer though
I took a while before she gave a chance she's acting cold
I offered her a drink she turned me down flat
She said if you want my name you gotta do better than that
I said OK, now your shit don't stink
I'ma walk away only tried to buy you a drink
As I began to walk away she said I'm sorry for real
But every guy in the club tried slipping me pills
I don't trust guys each and every one will lie to you
I said I understand but it's not what I try to do
I wasn't even gonna come to your table
But if I didn't I knew that I'd regret it later
I go after what I want but I got class
For me no need to slip a pill if I want ass
She gave me a funny look I couldn't tell what it meant
She let her guard down and on our conversation went


She said I want a man with a plan and ambition
Not an immature nigga on a ""pussy-hit mission""
I'm too good for that I have so much to offer
Got a good job working at my mom and dad's law firm
You got goals, that's what she asked
Yeah I wanna fill my home with platinum plaques
It takes hard work but you know it's coming after
She said 'oh my God you must be a famous rapper!'
I do all right but I'm never satisfied
I'm told when you still love what you do it never gets old
I strive for more but that's enough about me
Why don't we skip out the club and take a walk on the streets
We slipped out of the club with no worries
Seems she wanted to get out in a hurry
We hung all night till we lost our friends
Till they caught us bangin in the back of a Benz

Bitches better keep up or they gonna miss the train
You might try in vain
You ain't gonna make it to the station, mane
For all y'all missin' out
Wishin' you could fuck her for the weed we dishin' out
I make shit simple
We smoked all the most potent weed for the temple
There ain't no example
Here we cultivate for the mind and the mental
Just breathe that in
Listen, I don't even know where to begin
You feel that urge?
Like a shock through the body and you're gonna feel the surge
This shit is is a blur
Like I took a mushroom my life's all swerved

Oh na na (Oh na na), marijuana (Marijuana)
Oh na na (Oh na na), smoke the ganja (Smoke the ganja)

K.U.S.H.,Rise Up,2010.0,"Chong: Hey man! Check this out. 
I got the best kush ever man
Cheech: Aw, man... I've been so out... 
You got sent from heaven
All right, man, 
light it up
, 
Holmes
!
Chong: Okay, check it out man!

Yeah, it's time to blaze that shit up
Pass me that lighter
I'm the original Dr. Greenthumb ,the rest are liars
I'm the one with the prescription to get you higher
I got every type of weed that you might desire
Go ahead, fire it up, maybe you can get inspired
Any kind of flavor you savor, I can do you the favor
Just as long as you share with your neighbor
Some like the 
Sour D,
 
that's an east coast swing
But on the west coast we all know kush is queen
Some of y'all will smoke anything, but me, I'm picky
I throw it out if I don't see that it's green and sticky
No stress, no bush,
 
I'm pushing the kush
When I harvest put a K on the bag like the Nike Swoosh
I'm over the world, in case you wonder
I smoked everywhere I went, they call me the Weed Hunter
But no one does it better like we do in Cali
Just ask one of my patients cause they always tell me that the

K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit

Kottonmouth Kings are down with us
Snoop Dogg and Dre are down with us
Cheech and Chong, they're down with us
But the DEA, they can get the nuts
On a High Times cover, you might see us
Taking 
hits from the bong
 
with the eight-foot Zong
With weed so strong, that knock out King Kong
Hit it one good time... your mind's gone
Your eyes get red, and your mouth goes dry
Just get me when you want more and I'll supply
Red and meth said, ""let's gets stoned"" I said ""How High""
They said ""high enough to touch God and kiss the sky""
""That's a tall order But I think I got what you need""
I got the food for though and I'm ready to feed
So, follow my lead I got some gifts to bring
It's an everyday life from the Reefer King

K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit

I got the cream of the crop, my crop means cream
When it's time to bag it up I assemble the team
We're like the Yankees, most winning, grand champs of the herb
Nothing gets you like the type of medicine I serve
Lawyers, teachers, actors, street cleaners
No matter what they are, they all come to see the Reefer
They stay high 24 like Keifer
I tell 'em don't hit too hard, this is a Creepa
Woody Harrelson is down with us
Bruce Willis smokes all, he's down with us
Yeah, Willie Nelson is down with us
Who the fuck you think drives the ganja bus?
Dionne Warwick, she's down with us
She got caught at the airport with joints and such
So if anyone asks, she's down with us
And you don't wanna enter more weed in the Cannabis cup
I'm Greenthumb, I reign supreme, son
A strain better than mine, I've never seen one
The K.U.S.H
Keeps you so high that you can't concentrate
Dave Chapelle, is down with us
Halle Barry, too, but don't tell no one
KRS-One is down with us
He's a blunt getting smoked and he can't wake up

K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-kush-lyrics

Some think I'm a criminal but, yo I ain't all of that
Hit'cha with the baseball bat when ya wanna ill though
Wanna mess around, you get fucked on the hill bro
Kick it like a steel toe, real slow hits from the bong
Make me feel like Cheech and I'm kickin' it wit' Chong
Just like Cheech and Chong frontin' with ""Ice Cream""
Cypress Hill is here to give you a nice dream
Speak it like a rolla', and you know it's rolled tightly
I'm like the funky beat, so, why ya tryin' ta fight me
Pigs often site me, that's not polite G
And any hour of the day ya know I might be
Harassed by a pig real fast
They wanna Rodney King me, always tryin'a crown my ass
Ain't got no class
 (Sen Dog: No Class)
I hit they' ass like the buddah that's stinky
They wanna' scruff but, they' just so rinky-dinky
I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk
Sen got the Philly, and he's gonna light the blunt
Sippin' at the kufu make me go cuckoo!
Somethin' like loco then I turn into this loocoo
Bringin' the beta, yeah, now the funk is risin'
Got the beta bass
 
and the nasal highs and
As I kick a trip, it comin' straight from my sinus
Crazy nasal vocals,
 cannot make the hotties loco
I remember sista Maggie, breasts were kinda saggy
Used to sell me buddha outta fucked up little baggies
Honey'd up a twenty even when I had no money
She said ""Pay me back with some Latin dick Sonnie""
Well I never went out, and I don't think I'm gonna
Just for some buddha, she wanted me to bone her
""Demeaning, ya think ya know what I meanin''
I got somethin' for the ho's ta be schemin' on
I'm the Buddha-Real I take a trip ta hoota'ville
I'll throw ya out the door... of my big blue Seville
Then light another joint, this ain't no exploitation (point)
For we are the ones strollin' in the ways of the masters

Stoned is the Way of the Walk
Stoned is the Way of the Walk

Woke up in a casket

Ain't strong enough to contain the Afro Marx
Critical bell rings
Snapped out the dream
What the fuck's up with the funny red beam

Strictly Hip-Hop,Cypress Hill III: Temples of Boom,1995.0,"Yeah…
Funky…
Come on…
Busy…
Yeah, yeah this one goes out to all you “real” emcees
Rappin’ on R&B records and shit
Talkin’ ‘bout keeping real hip-hop alive
And… and to all you Cindy Crawford ass motherfuckers
Doin’ fashion ads, wantin’ to be models
Talking bout keeping it real
What’s goin’ on
And a couple years ago, everybody talking bout doin Sprite commercials and shit
That motherfucker sold out, that motherfucker sold out and shit
All the real niggas is doin’ sprite commercials now
What niggas need money that motherfuckin bad or what
I ain't goin out

I never rapped on an R&B record, and I never will
I got these phoney motherfuckers, talk about lets keep it real
But they don't know how to take they own advisement
Going out, do it solo on an advertisement, commercializing
Fuckin' sell out, nigga, this is hip-hop, not fashion
Get the hell out
I'm taking out these so called gangsta niggas
Takin' pictures, modeling clothes for small figures
And I never took another fuckin' MC's shit
And made it my first single, for a hit
Fuckin' hypocrite, you can get the dip, when I lick a shot off
I'm gonna, and all of it
It's a damn shame when you got all these fools in the record industry
Sellin' out for the fame
I just sit back and watch these fools with their gimmicks
Go down in flames , in the big game

Yeah all you real hardcore (?)
Get Busy…
Always seem like… you got a album full of hardcore jams
Just so happen to have two pop songs
And they just so happen to be hit singles
And to one certain writer named James Bernard
Yeah you, motherfucker
Nigga got mad ‘cause I wouldn’t let him suck my dick and I smacked him and told him to get the fuck outta here so he started writin’ bullshit
Wait till I see you, bitch
House Of Pain ain’t down with us…

Zippidey-dooda, I smoke weed and I got brain damage
But, I don't give a fuck cause I still manage
To represent to the fullest
No pop singles, and no actin' foolish
To the studio gangsta with the metaphors
In them magazines with the bitch editors
Keep it real in the game
Niggas got no shame
Now all the executives want all the fame
Based on the videos, just a gang of silly hoes
For the fucking industry that's taking all your dough
I never stole it, stole it all
Just hard work, and sweat, for them platinum records on the wall
Fools want me to fall
I won't cause my roots are to thick and strong, like the chocolate thai stick
I hear niggas say no, but, I know they front
Cause after they shows they want me to smoke a blunt
I don't respect a hypocrite, motherfuckers I despise
Cause me I tell the truth, even when I tell a lie
All you brothers in the game run a check
Cause you get checked fucked off, with no respect

Smokin' MC's like a bowl of Buddha

You'll be a prisoner in the temple of thieves
Movin out, just movin on out, no doubt
We the number one crew
Kickin' all gas niggas out the house
Puttin' up an argument, just don't bother
'Cause I'll whoop that ass just like I'm your father
Take heed to the master's call yes y'all

Bullets fly, but they don't give a fuck about who dies
When you're in the middle of the buckin'
No question, confrontation
Nowhere to run from the assassination
Let the rain come down
Whoops there goes another body on the ground
Watch out for G hound
It's the undisputed Cypress family
Kickin' up dust, can you handle us gradually
Growin' inside your mind like a tumour
Spreading in your head like a rumor

Let the flow roll

You ain't got no game
I'm breakin' ya out the frame
Coming through like a train
Looking to take over the world is my goal
With my unstoppable crew takin' all control
You can't get none of this, we're runnin' this
Well taker, earth shaker, 3 point gunnin' this
Get out the lane, I'm comin' through
And if you don't wanna move then I'm comin' right through you
(coolio)
It's like inch by inch and step by step
I'm closing in on your position and destruction is my mission
Though eight is not enough, your whole squad better duck
It's like switch when I bust
Now you're whole crew is dust
Comin' through my area, i'ma have to bury ya
The real scream team on your scream scene
It's like showdown on the range
Go tell me who wanna tangle with the
Ghetto witch-doctor neighborhood superhero?

Insane like a runaway train I'm in your lane
Like it's only 3 seconds to score to win the game
Came to bring the ultimate pain upon the brain
Untamed, you won't like it when I change
And you are type strange
Make room, manaical monster in the game
And I got my eye on you
Deadshot aim, as free throws keep comin' down like rain
You feelin' me, I'm feelin' you
The monstar again, I'm tellin' you
Pass me the rock, now I'm headed to the basket
Get up out my way is what you better do
My tactics is unsportsmanlike conduct
You better ask it
Don't get no better than this, you catch my drift?
You get stripped by ballhandlers ruled by swackhammer
Danger, you're dealin' with offical hoop-bangers
With hang time like a coat hanger
Jump, with thunderous 360-degree type dunks
What up doc? the monstar funk
(ll cool j)
Lightning strikes and the court lights get dim
Supreme competition is about to begin
Above the rim, finessin' and moves is animated
Once I get to ballin', I can't be deflated
I'm rugged raw, my monstars is gettin' money
When clicks get to buggin', I'm snatchin' up their bunnies (uhh!)
Every step I take shakes the ground
I'll make you break your ankles, son, shakes you down
This is my planet, I'm bout business
The best that ever done it, can I get a witness? (uhhh!)
Cumulus clouds bring darkness up above
You in it for the money?
Or in it for the love, m.j.?
23 ways to make a pay
Loungin' in the mothership back around my way (uhh!)
I'm 28 light years old
If the refs get political, dribble like bob dole
Am I gettin' lyrical?
Daddy, I think so
Monstar droppin' flavor fluid so drink slow
Chorus
(busta rhymes)
Yo, God bless!!
Pick up your chest
Here's an example of how I can stress your full court press
With finesse, I bench-press your stress whenever you test
We're speed ballin', on the fastbreak just like the pony express
I'm gonna mingle in your face and take the lid off
Just use your head and forfeit the game
You and your team just need to back off!!
Get off my block, gimmie the ball, I said it's my rock!!
I'm startin' a line-up by gettin' y'all to bring the livestock
Throw all your money in the pot
And make sure you bet all your money on my bank shot
When we come right through tell me what you really gonna do?
We'll leave your team name in shame and take your talent from you
While you abandon your ship, we take your championship
With nothing left for you to see except the instant replay clip
Money spending, goal tending, stay-bending teams like crash cars
Who do they be?
They be the monstars!!!!!!

Carry Me Away,Rise Up,2010.0,"I was an outcast, outsider, trouble maker
A lost soul, outta control, in danger
Didn't have a care in the world, my feelings were numb
Never showing emotion, it's easy for some
I don't know how it happened, how I got to this point
But I needed a way out, I was stuck in a ploy
I needed another path or I'd self destruct
I was down on my luck, my head was so fucked
A menace runnin' the streets is what I was
Holdin' my heat and rollin' with the serious thugs
You couldn't tell me a thing, I was like my brother
Words went in one ear and out the other
Slangin' and bangin' with a chip on my shoulder
An insane in the brain certified street soldier
So close to the grave, you at an early age
Can't tell you the price I've paid

Oh, the sky overhead, it's like a canvas of grey
I don't know how much time I'll be given to stay
From the first spring to light till the end of the day
I'm just livin' my life till they come carry me away

I've been there in LA nights in the block where I came up
My pops used to hate when we hanged with them bangers
Guess he knew one day that we'll become us
That's just how it is when you live where we come from
""Fight, don't run!"" is the motto we live by
Get 'em on the ground and stomp a mind about ten times
Sure we was just kids back then
I had no remorse for what we did back then
Six of us, one call, we'd all pack in
Hit the strip and go and get the shit crackin'
Gun wars and drug deals, I seen 'em happen
When I started losin' homeboys, I wasn't laughin'
I looked all around and seen none of 'em there
That's when I figured out that nobody cared
If we lived or die, we'll just get high and ride
And I wasn't gonna let this happen one more time

Oh, the sky overhead, it's like a canvas of grey
I don't know how much time I'll be given to stay
From the first spring to light till the end of the day
I'm just livin' my life till they come carry me away

My mother would stand for me every step of the way
She didn't judge me, she told me I'd win some day
When I was at my lowest, when I had no focus
She pulled me out the gutter, said I wasn't hopeless
Every night she prayed for me I was out on the street
Chillin' on the corner with the hand on my heat
Eyes open wide for the pigs and foes
It's an every day hazard when you hustle for dough
So many nights I didn't come home, she thought the worst
Maybe somebody shot me down without any remorse
Maybe I hurt somebody and I was stuck in a cell
Well, I regret all those times that I put her through hell
When I reflect back on those days, my heart aches
And everybody I lost or let down, I wish I could take it
All back and make it better but I can't, so I try
To make amends and be there through thick and thin

Oh, the sky overhead, it's like a canvas of grey
I don't know how much time I'll be given to stay
From the first spring to light till the end of the day
I'm just livin' my life till they come carry me away

Come carry me away
Come carry me away
Come carry me away
Come carry me away",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-carry-me-away-lyrics
Can’t Get the Best of Me,Skull & Bones,2000.0,"(Sen Dog)
Hell nah, you can't handle a man of my superior strength
I've been rockin for years, now it's time to go to length
Bitin emcees in their tracks I stop em
My rhyme style make em turn dropper
My concepts come sick like Dennis Hopper
I jack fools up and stick em like dirty coppers
Like I said before I'm takin you lane of whores
Down to the phone, knock his ass on your good balls
Only one way to deal with these softies
Take they ass out like heroes and they flossin
And when you test me you better bring styles
Cause mine can go on and on and on for miles

Five roll with the weakest
What you need is, the chrome plated heater
So you can peep this, tragedy had to be in your mind soakin in
Sad to see you broken down, not at least broken in
Can't stop some Hill shit from comin through
The reality is out with the old, and with the new
Ways and things change, with strange haids of braids shade
Switch place life and life plays with thumb pay
Does and un-trues, the mule leaves no clues
In the dark confused, we choose to eat you
Out the whole stroke away so I can listener
We don't stop if you can, fuck commissioner

Tequila (Tequila Sunrise),Los Grandes Éxitos en Español,1999,"Word up, Tequila style eat the worm motherfucker
Tequila spice, hot nice
Feeling right, sipping on Jose Cuervo
Down in Tiajuana, Mexico
Thinking of the big score the night before
Met the connect, who was impressively dressed
In high fabrics
With troops like Babe Ruth, up on the mezzanine
Brandishing sub-machine guns, aye-yo
It's all about the money, son
Now that's the only reason
We came south of the border, to complete this work order
We gotta get it, no looking back, going all out for it
Ready to attack, die in a minute flat for it
As God is my witness, we got ditches
For all you motherfuckin fake bitches
It all boils down to the business
Nothing personal, when niggas acting like they helping you
I fuckin blast you like Frank Castle, motherfucker!
Tequila Sunrise, bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die
So get the money nigga!
Tequila Sunrise, bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die
So get the money nigga!
I never knew money like this, in the palm of my hand
'Til I met the man with mad hook-up, and big plan
Every where you look'a, he got everybody shook up
Running for cover, the big bad WOOF, motherfucker
He was like a father figure, show me the bigger picture
Fuck slingin' on the corner, don't let the pigs get you
Not like these fools who don't comprehend
You end up doing a twenty-five bit in the pen
You got that? Getting your cup, I took a swig
The bitter taste of the 'mezcal', free worm shit
Droppin' a lesson, he slapped my face, he said listen
Pay attention brotha, you're my ace, but don't ever question
Just do what I say, and you'll be rich
And keep this in your mind: rats lay in a ditch with no spine
Don't ever forget that golden rule in the game
Cheers, they all know your name, it's like fame
Why, women and money don't mix, like drinking an' driving
Watch those conniving women and keep your eye out
Always be aware of what's around you
They wanna down you, and fuckin clown you
Keep your shit in order the money won't stop
Pretty soon you'll be on top
Tequila Sunrise, bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die
So get the money nigga!
Tequila Sunrise, bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die
So get the money nigga!
Tequila Sunrise, with the bloodshot eyes
My, my, my, how time flies and goes by, surprise!
My mentor passed on and passed a warn to me, emergency
For my enemies who wanna murder me
Eat the worm, motherfucker, while you burn, motherfucker
Better kill me, don't let me return, motherfucker
Trust no man, cause I'll be back, you understand?
With a plan, and my ice in hand, I want it all
I recall the words from Jesus, you are the Juice
Better go get it, don't let it get to your head, embed it
Let these words stick, you better be ready to die
Now take a fucking sip, caution it, but I never lie
Tequila Sunrise, bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die
So get the money nigga!

Hand on the Glock,Black Sunday,1993.0,"Crusing through the neighborhood, some say I'm no good
Claiming I'm a criminal but lets make it understood
I'm just one man with a whole lot of homeboys
You get the click and a pop when I pull out the chrome toy
Jack me and I'll jack you back
Then jump back to my big Buddah like
I'm not a bad guy but don't take advantage
I'm throwing out the garbage just show me where the can is
All I was doing was searching for the boom
Then some punk tried to hit me with the broom
Lucky I ducked quick or else I'd be assed out
Last thing I wanted was have to pull the gat out
Here comes a nigga and he's got a .38
Well like Grandma said, hey yo I'm shooting up straight

Cause 
I put away the shotgun
 bought me a Glock
Took a little trip to the funky weed spot
Tried to jack me but homie got shot
La-la-la-lalala-la!

Couple niggas from the east side fucking up your program
No one witnessed but they heard the gun blast
Left the problem unsolved now I'm gonna sum up
How people getting hurt in the process of the come up
Gotta get with fools that'll wait for you to run up
Rolling in the hood that you already shot up
Pocket full of gats and see if we can spot the
One we let slip in the process of the tip
When we find his ass, gonna unload the clip
Then take a little trip down to Rio
Now my hood's hot so I got to go chill


Kicking that funky Cypress Hill shit
Think I'll load a clip, let's see if you can deal with
Cause a bulletproof vest ain't shit
When the infrared's pointing at your head kid
And that's just too bad y'all
Now I'm 
headed up a river with a boat and no paddle
Should've put the Glock down
Now they got me in lock down
Living like a nigga that done lost his mind
Cause self defense turns to the offense
But nobody even really knows that
All they see is me and the gat
Up in the court room looking at the jury
Starin down the punk ass District Attourney
La-la-la-la-lala-la!

High Times,Cypress Hill IV,1998.0,"Now this some baaad weeed...

The very first time I hit the weed I was young
Coughin up a lung, high strung, back in '81
Goin to school, hittin the buddah behind the bleachers
Comin to class high, sellin the lie to the teachers
Nickel bag, nickel bag, dime to a nickel
Sellin joints to the honeys suck it like an icicle
Others wanted the 40 but I wanted the weed
While everybody was runnin out, I was plantin my seeds
Homegrown, backyard boogie, I'm still stoned
Got my weed plants taller than your telephone's pole
I can remember when I could only get ses in those days
Now I'm rockin that chocolate thai, skunk and the haze
Roll a fat one, pass it to the left don't front
But I hate it when they don't take the seeds out the blunt
A bunch of blunt-rollers are like rookies on the field
Spillin the weed plant fuckin dookies with no skill
I should write a book, how to roll it then pass it
Light it, grow it, sell it and then divide it
Mr. Greenthumb, Dr. Weed, I proceed to give the herb man what they need
True indeed, blow your fuckin smoke up in the sky
And get high with your bong or your Phillie or 
Dutches
, give me a light

Grab the weed up, pack it in, put it in the pipe
Light it up, smoke a bowl, we puffin the lye right
Put your finger on the hole and hold it in brother
Take a puff, that's enough, and pass it to another

Get the weed sack, 
smoke it up, til it's all gone
No roaches up in the ashtray, smoke up all the bomb
I used to spend money but now I'm growin the crops
But I hate it when the pigs throw a raid on the spot
It was once said I smoke so much weed, by a brother
That I look like the nigga on the zig-zag cover
Maybe I used to look like that way back when
When my nigga Sen Dog was around sippin on the 
Hen
Let the fly rhymes smother you with the scent of the skunk
We got the High Times cover shows you how to roll a blunt
Quarter pound, quarter pound, pound to a quarter
Makin trips to Mexico runnin down to the border
Long hairs, bald heads, dreads and punk rocks
Kids of all colors be puffin it down the block
I got the weed on lock with all the hydro methods
Call me Puffy cause I makin and takin a hit record
Blow your fuckin smoke up in the sky and get high
With the bong, Phillie or 
Dutches
, give me the light

Grab the weed up, pack it in, put it in the pipe
Light it up, smoke a bowl, we puffin the lye right

Rise Up,Rise Up,2010.0,"Since  the Watts riot of 1965 has the city seemed so out of control. Los Angeles is still on the edge

Living in the big city, the American dream
Is far roaming in the streets of greed
Everywhere I turn I'm on a mission for more
But I ain't selling my soul
With the dope there's no girl
I'm on a one way box to the top
Hitting the strip but got a sound that would rally the block
I'm in the fast lane and I won't stop
You ain't nothing but talk
You couldn't hang on the rope by ball

This life that I live, it ain't for the weak
I'm a roddy ass gangster that came off the street
I'm trying to keep the peace, but I gotta keep my peace
Got these drunk police want me all rappy
And I'm searching for the higher ground
I want my head in the sky
So high that I can't come down
Leave your lies in every town across the nation
'Cause you can never stop to play

Gotta Rise up (to the top, to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)
Gotta rise up (to the top, to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)
'Cause what goes up must come down
So we gotta rise up to the higher ground
Rise up (Rise up)
Rise Up (Rise Up)
Rise Up (Rise Up)
How high can you get?

Cruising in the drop Chevy
Got my foot on the floor
I'm hitting switches and my brain is heavy
You wanna look inside and see who's crossing the brine
Curiosity is killing you with stick in the prime
I get high from the brim in the set
Never gripping the script
But all you haters couldn't hold my dick
Don't need a clip for my nine is straight
You should leave it alone
And check your toe 'cause my line will spit

This right here's as high as it gets
Somebody likes the split the hell
Cause you stepped on the sex
But guess who will show you, you gotta pass the check
Got my clock on deck and my custom vest streets
You came, for me I'm the best
And you can keep the dress
'Cause I'm smoke at the less
Turn a step back I'm tired of getting pushed

Gotta rise up to the top (to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)
Gotta rise up to the top (to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)
'Cause what goes up must come down
So we gotta rise up to the Higher ground
Rise up (rise up)
Rise up (rise up)
Rise up (rise up)
How high can you get?

I go psycho, crazy Michael Myers
I set the stage on fire, go higher
'Cause when my name's on the flyer
There's so much more to make the whole city rise
This defines a man to get the whole world lifted
One man trying to make a land with a mission
There's no way you can stand in this position
You can't take the heat, get the fuck up out the kitchen

Born with the will to hustle, see we hittin' the floor
You'll never stop it, you ain't got the muscle
We're on the world tour, homeboy, this is for sure
We got a tour, blow the stage up, we out the door
Sometimes we all need an escape, so when we fall off track
You get your mind while we make a stack
I made a pack with a crew on the hill
We continue to build with all the people who believe their bill

We gotta rise up (to the top, to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)
Gotta rise up (to the top, to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)

(Mueren los mocosos)
 - this goes with the chorus
Mira...
Cypress Hill, diremos algo
Pero nosotros, el Machete, aquí rondando
Con los grandes, representando, mira
Ah ah!
Desde Monterrey, el Cerro De La Silla
Nos los llevamos a Los Angeles
Colocando nada mas así ah ah
Transportamos por todos lados a donde vamos mira
Ah el Control Machete ah

Pass the knife, I'ma take a life
Seems I'm on a bad one, every night
More attention to the light
Burning up at the very touch, runaway train
I perform the ritual, take away all the pain
Free you from this life, from my hands I release you
If the end is what you pray for more than women to appease you
Another chapter starts and more darkness fills the ages
And another stage is set for many names upon the pages
I can sing you all the lullaby and nullify the threat to me
Then disappear, no one knows my whereabouts, presently
Blend in with the masses, now I'm fittin' in society
Hide behind the mask, overwhelmed by the anxiety

In the middle of the street and I got me a pistol
If you wanna see more, all I gotta do is whistle
Ah shit, now you looking at a bloodbath
But queued motherfuckers is the one who had to have that

Hit the floor, better hit the floor, better hit the floor
Better, better, better hit the floor, better hit the floor
Better, better hit the floor, better hit the floor
Better, better, better hit the floor when you hear the sound
Better hit the floor, better hit the floor
Better, better hit the floor, better hit the floor
Better, better hit the floor, better hit the floor
Better hit the floor when you hear the sound

Rolling stone
Everywhere I roam, I can call it home
I've adapted to the elements and set the tone
Set the bar high, stars in your eyes
Far as I can see, I can see those little scars that you hide
You one of the rock gods
This is only the beginning
'Cause the ghost is in the shadow
And this patience slowly thinnin'
Sweat drippin' down my face
As I'm waitin' for the moment
When the metal's flyin' blind
There's no chances for atonement
It's my life and I own it
Inside my sleeve and I've shown it
I have skill to survive
All my life I have known it
I'm the one you should look to
If your enemy shook you
I have the skill if you need it
My name, don't even repeat it

In the middle of the street, and I got me a pistol
If you wanna see more all I gotta do is whistle
Ah shit, now you looking at a bloodbath
But queued motherfuckers is the one who had to have that

Trouble,Stoned Raiders,2001.0,"It's been awhile now, been around the block many miles
Many faces, many places, that I found friends
Places where I spend time, places where my mind roam
Places I could call home, places I could get stoned
I just wanna be alone when I'm feelin' in my zone
People want to knock me down, 'cause they never have their own
They won't get the best of me, but they try hopelessly
Why you wanna fuck wit' me? I'm not, what you 'posed to be?
Used to not give a damn, coulda just killed a man
Sawed-off in my hand, but I had to kill the plan
Think I've found my peace of mind, feet planted on the ground
I just had to redefine, what I thought to myself
It all goes around me and others who would down me
Who I don't give a fuck about, trouble always found me
I know used to welcome it with my arms open wide
Trouble's hand's on the door, but it can't come inside
[Chorus: B Real + 
Sen

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

You want trouble, c'mon, you want trouble?
You want trouble, c'mon, you want trouble?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
TROUBLE'S AT MY DOOOOOOOOOOR!
You want trouble, c'mon, you want trouble?
You want trouble, c'mon, you want trouble?

Trouble on the line, all the fuckin' time
Got me contemplatin' the solution, the fusion my wicked mind
Got suckers that hate me but it don't really matter
I'm like a gat when I bust, niggas run and scatter
Movin' in circles, throwin' elbows and fists
You got to be a real nigga in the Cypress Hill pit
Like the critics talkin' shit, but I'm not concerned
A hundred G's for sixty minutes is the bank I earn
I try to put it to you bluntly so you bitches can learn
That nobody get tired when it's time to burn
With so many phonies out there lot of you have been fooled
Into actually believin' that some shit is cool
Take the blinders off and go look for yourself
Fuck hearin' about shit from somebody else
I'm down for myself, I back up myself
Put in all on the line make sure that I'm felt

*scratching interlude*

Felt the walls closin' in, and my shoe's wearin' thin
Had to be the biggest clown, man you couldn't comprehend
Some hated on my game, said I wouldn't be the same
Called me ""Rock Superstar"", ""Insane In The Brain""
But I know I haven't changed, so I brush you to the side
Trouble's knockin' on the door, anxious just to come inside
'times I gotta block it out, no one likes to talk it out
Trouble keeps comin' and I can't seem to lock it out
Got my hands on the phone, I don't wanna have to talk
If you're feelin froggy, son, then I guess you gotta jump
I can see it in your eyes, you don't seem to recognise
I wouldn't fall into your trap, for many lives to compromise
I'm not fallin' for your shit, you ain't gonna take me there
You can talk all you want, but I don't got your weight to bear

Hey, corre ese, borrate
Por que viene la hoota, siempre carga fusca
Buscando a la más filosa clica
La famosa Cypress Hill rifa
Todos los vatos salen, están en la calle
Tírense cabrones, si me ven manejar
Con los que me junto
Con un Magnum quebrando unos putos
Puro cholo loco, empaca cromo
Y te llenamos el saco de plomo

No le pongo mente a estos pendejos
No voy a gastar tiempo
Yo te dejo, yo no doy hueco
Mira mis dos cañones
¡Tumbo los cabrones!

Tráiganme la acción, yo les traigo a tragazon
Mis palabras son ataques sin razón
Va tu satélite de visión
Enseñaste un violenta ciclón
Hago un ejemplo de todos los pendejos
(¡Y te dejo todo chueco!)
La chota entro a mí cantón
Un matón, narco, pistolón
Cúbrete, guey o te mato
Porque siempre quiebra al más macizo vato
No quisiera matarlo, pero si lo hizo
Cuerpo en el piso

Chingón el tiempo para que te rinden
Las misiones que establecí
Empiece, me fumo hierba verde
Aveces tumbo gente
Vi que un maníaco quería tu carro
¿Crees que la chota te va hacer un paro?
No, creo que te vas a parar
Y comenzar a cuetear, disparar
Mueve puro fierro
Y te deja todo chueco
¿Como me vas a entender si balazos no te ha llovido?
¿Entiendes lo que digo?
Cuando 'ta de matón, cierro tu cantón
Por aquí se pone cabrón
Por el dinero, barrio peleonero
Muchas veces robos dejan entierros

It's a Tribe thang

Madman gonna gat cha, quick with the cuete
See a gang, no there ain't no jugete
Rollin' like a psycho with the windows rolled down
Who you lookin at, you tryin to fade me clown?
Plato, si mon, you want static
When you reach for your gat to load your automatic
(Boo-yaa!!) Spittin' out buckshots
Homie say blood claat, so you can call a pig
'Cause no one could handle, aguanta en loco
Insane to the brain, you get the bullet and

A hole in your head

A hole in the head, a hole in the head
You get a hole in the head (a hole in the head) in your motherfuckin' head

Eight barrel pumpin', system thumpin'
See a fine heina, c'mon baby jump in
I stop to cop, here let me tell you somethin'
Me and you, ruca, we should be humpin'
Honey likes the mack, homie's got her in the bag
But there's vato's rollin out, and they're stickin' up the flag
He jumps out with the sag, hey where ya from homes?
It's on... he sees him reachin' for his chrome
Buckshot to the dome, jumps in the Brome
Honey's in the back but she just wants to go home
But he trips to the store homeboy needs a forty
White boy at the counter's thinkin' oh lordy lordy!
Pushin' on the button, panickin' for nuttin'
Pigs on the way, aiyyo I smells bacon
Dips out the store, one-time hits the corner
And he hits the fuckin' alley like if homes was Pop Warner
Still had the forty, comin' out the alley
Seen the chief's son, pig Officer O'Malley, oink
In the black and white thinkin' he's gonna jack him right
Wrong, hah, it's gonna be on
That pig better saca la chrome (P.D. 187)
A to the motherfuckin' K! (You know whassup Sen)
Shoot your ass down! And by the way

You get a hole in your head
A fuckin' hole in your head

You get a hole in your head in your motherfuckin' head

Six rollin up and now he's really baffled
Brother's thinkin' ""Damn I never got this gaffled"" (to' up)
Beat down (down) on the way to the station
Gaffled up from a false accusation
Oink to the pen, you know homes the one that's where the
Attitudes are flying and the punks will be dying
Made a comb to a shank, I'm gonna stick ya
Wet ya, you know homes the picture
(Yeah you never been to jail boy!)
Broomstick up your ass
And by the way, you get

A hole in your head
A fuckin'  hole in your head

A hole in the head, a hole in the head
You get a hole in your head in your motherfuckin' head
A hole in your head, a hole in your head

To buy you and yo friends drinks? Do I have assets?

She wanna ride me, she wanna tie me
Around her tiny little finger and ride me blindly

And smirk when you fall down, but I calm down

Never settle for stress, or wack rappers

Busted in the Hood,Till Death Do Us Part,2004.0,"Well here's a little story I got to tell
About a thugged out homey I know so well
It started way back, when I was a teen
In the hood, on the corner, slanging dope to fiends
Had the little stash that could serve your need
You can do what you want but I got weed for me
Riding for my fam, trying to hit a grand
CRASH unit on my ass, now I'm in demand
One lonely family I be
All in the hood, I got nobody
The sun is beatin down on my red dark hat
Pigs are roaming through the alley so I gotta toss my gat
Forgot about the sack, looking for a place to hide
If they ask me for my name - fuck 'em, I'mma lie

One O.G. gangster I be
Busted in the hood, I got no more weed
Pigs are coming down on my gangster stash
When they caught me with the weed and the dope and hash

He said a little something, I wasn't so impressed
No more running homey, now you're under arrest
The sack was in my hand, felt like a sack of bricks
I swore he couldn't see it when I threw it in my whip
He said he wanted some, I said I don't have none
Found it in the sun on the floor next to my gun
Next thing I saw was the gun to my head
Now the lead will make me dead, and yo this is what he said

My name is Sgt. Slacker with a license to kill (uh-huh)
I think you know what time it is, it's time to get real (yea)
Now what do we have here? A banger and his peers

He cuffed my hand you understand he threatened me with tears
Sorry motherfucker had his gun out with a grin
You think the story's over but it's ready to begin

One O.G. gangster I be
Busted in the hood, I got no more weed
Pigs are coming down on my gangster stash
When they caught me with the weed and the dope and hash

Now I got your crack and most of your crew
You got a couple choices of what you can do
Better make the right decision if you know what I mean
You can do some time or fork over your green

I said I got no green he started looking at me harder
I said I don't have nothing you can go fuck your daughter (what?)
He hit me with the fist, he hit me with the gat
He put the night stick to my back, so
I think I'm done, the pig's got my gun
It isn't lookin good, I got ink on my thumb
Another pig walked in, said he's playing games
He gave another look at me, found out my false name

One O.G. gangster I be
Busted in the hood, I got no more weed
Pigs are coming down on my gangster stash
When they caught me with the weed and the dope and hash

Sitting there pissed as I dwell in my cell
The place smells like shit in the County Jail
Homey looking at me like he seen me before
He started throwing up a set, then he spit on the floor
I think ay-yeah yo, I know this kid
It's the same motherfucker cocktailed my crib
This dude said, ""Get ready"", pulled a shank on me
I said c'mon homey you a bit too sloppy
Fool tried to stab me, socked him in the eye
The guards yelled, ""Give it up!"" and let two fly
The guards said down and we hit the floor
If you make a move after you won't move no more
He said I see you once again best protect ya neck
I said eat a dick from me you don't get respect
I said you wanna come with it, any time and place
And I'll leave you like Pacino with a scar on your face
They put him in the hole, and all the bullshit stopped
But when his boy had beef, yeah he got dropped
P.D. had no witness, D.A. dropped the load
I got probation for the gun and the dope, case closed

One O.G. gangster I be
Busted in the hood, I got no more weed
Pigs are coming down on my gangster stash
When they caught me with the weed and the dope and hash
One O.G. gangster I be
Busted in the hood, I got no more weed
Pigs are coming down on my gangster stash
When they caught me with the weed and the dope and hash",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-busted-in-the-hood-lyrics

Hanging on my chain cuz you wanna be a rich nigga
You can't feel me without the Braille
Im like that shit that get you amped without the Yale
Make busters pale 'cos they seen too much
But really what they saw was me and Kurupt

Here is something you can't understand
How I Could Just Kill A Man
Here is something you can't understand
How I Could Just Kill A Man
Here is something you can't understand
How I Could Just Kill A Man
Here is something you can't understand
How I Could Just Kill A Man

Penitentiaries, stuck for centuries
You gotta be real like me and B-Real
See you shoot, you ride but we kill
Concentrate unloadin' our steel
Dippin', hit up niggas, yes we will
Riding on niggas that when the mayhem spills
Pistols launch off and travel like arrows, animals, Hannibal
Hamlet, and unmanageable
What you gonna get, nigga? Ham on the Table?
I sic the home girls on you, struck by angels
Get em up drive by
Watch em gone drive by
Yeah paranoid, we drive by till we die
You niggas really don't know shit
I treat niggas like hoes when they silly dumb BIATCH!

Here is something that they just don't get
I don't give a fuck nigga, I don t give a shit
Here is something that they just know
Back to Fo, creepin' through the back door
Here is something that they just don't get
I don't give a fuck nigga, I don t give a shit
Here is something that they just know
Back to Fo, creepin' through the back door
I just dope blast 'em...

...'Cos I ain t finished yet
I see remains of someone you ain't diminished yet
We re like a pack of piranhas
In your Sauna
Attackin you, till there is nothing left for your mama
East side, do or die? Niggas wanna ride
Hitting switches in the Cadillac, getting people high
'Cos we live this, did this, beatin' like a pistol whip
Don't pull out ya gat if ya gunna let ya pistol slip

I'm ignorin' all the DUMB SHIT, 'cos these vatos can't hang
With the Mad Dog, nigga, out here runnin' thangs
Dump on that ass if you fuck with my business
Stop Pop, and drop all of you witness
Glocks lock, and unlock if you listen
Buck shots, hard stops, no more snitches
That's what you get when you fuck with the Real
Hardcore niggas that pack that steel

Here is something you can't understand

Yeah
The streets is ran, by heats and mini vans
Invading the spaces, chucks and fat laces
The ""I Don't Give A Fuck"" committee's just arrived
With millis and fifty-fives
Homicidally, I've separated the busters
Blasted the snitches, broke the switches
Fucked the bitches, invaded the glitches
Stole the riches, booked the bitches
Like fuck ya interests, nigga

Poet in the streets, niggas livin' on the edge
We take it to the Darkside, gettin' in your head
While you haunt us like a fed, we twist you like a dreadlock
Has I got to hammer talkin bitches in the bed?
While you fuckin' with the Soul Assassins and the Dog Pound
And all my latin dog-niggas get to hold it down
Now your violatin' 'cos you haters know i'm waitin'
In the silver stack in the parkin' lot
With the handle cocked

Here is something, that I think you just can t understand (How I could just kill a man!)
And you wonder why and how it is I could just kill a man (How I could just kill a man!)
You see, in these streets I pack my heat cuz should it be for real (How I could just kill a man!)
And if you think you wanna come and test me, then come deal with my steel (How I could just kill a man!)
Here is something, that I think you just can t understand

Looking Through the Eye of a Pig,Cypress Hill IV,1998.0,"I wake up every morning, kiss my wife goodbye
Hug my kids, tell 'em I love 'em, I'm out, hit the ride
I'm out on patrol, in my squad car, do I lay
Where you never know, if you'll be makin it home today
So many different attitudes, that I come across
I'm hardened and scarred tonight, feeling nobody's loss
Hookers hustlers killers and thieves, out on the streets
Got my mind warped, just found another corpse on the beat
Bound gagged raped, I'm frustrated, I hate it
Found a woman in the dumpster, body was mutilated
Bad dreams all up in my head, no lie
Sometimes I gotta take a sniff so I can get by, why
Don't I get hurt, cause there go my nerves, I got the urge
To merge this bullet in my brain, relieve my pain
What a fuckin shame, I don't wanna live, or paint the wall
With the bloodstains, eye of the pig, I see it all

The eye of the pig
* DJ Muggs cuts and scratches 'This pig' from _Pigs_ *

I've been on the force, over twenty years, I can say
That I'm worse, than some of these motherfuckers I put away
I'm in the biggest gang you ever saw, above the law
Lookin through the eye of the pig, I see it all
Drug abusers, drug dealers and the gang-bangin
Pieces of shit who should be on the fuckin noose hangin
These days you can't tell who's-who in the world
Is that a whore, or is that, an innocent young girl?
Fuck, I need a drink, and I'm almost off
At the precinct, it's like an AA meeting all gone wrong
I.A. got an eye, on my close friend guy
For takin a supply from evidence from a bust on a buy
That doesn't concern me, we never rat on each other
We went through the academy, just like frat brothers
Midnight, I only have an hour left on my shift
Think I'll get my dick SUCKED by this basshead bitch
My marriage is all FUCKED, my wife is with the neighbors
Subpeonaed, now I gotta sign these fuckin divorce papers
I recall, happier times, before the fall
Lookin through the eye of the pig, I see it all


Now I'm on my way, back to the station to check out
So I can go home, relax, take a drink and think about
My abrupt change, out of the clean, to the corrupt
Lookin through the eye of the pig, I'm all fucked
No longer can I determine, who's the criminal
From the innocent man down, to the pedophile
No one gives a fuck about me, I'm slippin
Into darkness, I'm comin to grips and feelin heartless
What's this?  A dark green truck, tinted windows
Duly modified, probably a dope dealer inside
""Pull it over to the curb, take your keys out of the ignition...""
.. and raise your hands out the window and get em in high position
Don't move, or I'm gonna blast your fuckin head off
Just tell me where the guns and dope are and you'll get off
Don't give me that bullshit, I've heard about your raps
All you talkin about is slangin and shootin off the scraps
OK, Mr. B Real, get the FUCK out of the truck
I love it how all you fuckin rappers think it's so funny
Hit the FUCKIN floor, I need no probable cause
You got a big sack of coke in your truck (what?) so take a pause
You find it funny?  Get that smile off your face
Motherfucker take this

I Remember That Freak Bitch,Cypress Hill IV,1998.0,"Aiy-yo!

I remember that freak bitch, up in the clubs
The Victoria's Secret, she give love
No matter which way you keep it
You'll get shoved out the picture, now peep it
(You get the gloves bitch!)

I used to know this girl that slanged the green shit
Had it all goin on, but it didn't mean shit
She wanted to be a star, with big cars
And all the fame that came my way I gotta say
That she was all that, and a bag of indo
With no seed, such a delightful weed
I wish she was still around but, no she's gone
I guess she got blessed and she got put on
Aiyyo I miss that girl, she had the bomb, was the
Bomb-diggy bomb bomb, and nope, I'm not Qu'ran
Had all the holy books, and notes to get still
I never met another dealer with that appeal
With those electric eyes, hypnotized
Any wise man surprised, the queen of the lye

Bee eyes, bouncin five deep, clicked of innocence
Hangin with friends, all under surveillance from the government
While Don want tights they floss rights, just chewin on ice
Meditatin with her camp, gettin damp
She's a pimp or tile freak bitch, high maintenance
She got her fuckin clit pierced, chained to her anus
Professional for wettin niggas up, suck em first
Til they bust, swallow nut, then she's quick to strut
Right out the projects, been a whore since ninety-one
Suck a niggas dick for fun, holdin guns in her buns
Type of chick tell you 'fuck me in the ass' talkin shit
While she goin WALLA-WALLA-WALLA-WALLA-WALLA on your dick

I remember that freak bitch, up in the clubs
The Victoria's Secret, she give love
No matter which way you keep it
You'll get shoved out the picture, now peep it
(You get the gloves bitch!)

Yeah since I seen the queen of green on the screen
So I stepped up, to her screen door, like a dream
Or better yet like a fiend needing a fix
She wasn't like other chicks, pullin tricks on the scheme for chips
She was like, Run-D.M.C., _Tougher Than Leather_
Raw bitch, but then she was soft like a feather
Never again will I meet a woman of her nature
SkyPager turned off, datin one of the Lakers
Lucky-ass nigga with the jump shot
He got that hot shit, all in his pocket on lock
Damn I guess I'm jealous that another fella's got with her
But her sister's, bangin too, what should I do?
Fuck it I'll do like my nigga Smooth with the Princess
Plantin my seed in the next Queen of Buddha Bless
Fuck playin the second string, on the squad
I'm blowin up, all in your face, word to God

Yeah I fucked her in the Hershey Tunnel, deep inside
It made her pussy bubble, aiyyo she told me that it loves you
I told her 'arch that back, let me see that ass'
And then I kissed it, licked it, stuck my nose all in position
You tell me baby listen, can't you see my fuckin dick is throbbin
She started slobbin and gogglin, spittin burblin burpin it
I told her 'just don't matter baby, just don't bite it'
No hold barred, my dick was hard enough to dent a car, I stuck it in
Between to spread the Red Sea apart, the pussy fart
Was a motherfuckin work of art, she rode my dick
Just like a Kawasaki til the pussy started soundin sloppy
Like an old jalopy, time to nut
Took off the condom slapped her on the butt, then I bust
On her face in between her lips
Then she started lickin it, cause it was good shit, protein!
Hot and rich.. damn I got my shit freaky, Mr. Ricks

I remember that freak bitch, up in the clubs
The Victoria's Secret, she give love
No matter which way you keep it
You'll get shoved out the picture, now peep it

Highlife,Skull & Bones,2000.0,"I rolled you up like my Rizla
Cut you up, with my scissors
You wanna get us, yeah, the venom spitters
Your style's trash: don't litter
You got the jitters the hardhitters
No quitters your soul quivers
When you see the gats blazin, get out the street now
There ain't no use for you beggin to turn the heat down
You label me coldblooded
You wanna warm me up with hot lead the gat thudded
You can't cut it
You wack, but it's, no use your mouth shut it
Shootin arrows diamond-studded, and still budded
You got to love it, you better chase the paper all day
So you can walk down the long platinum hallway
But now the fools are minutemade;
They get played for a minute
Then played out they never get back in it
Gun park I bring chalk for your body outlined on the floor
You got hit by the 4-4!

You're in the game called life, son, how you're livin it
Street corner kids growin up blowin up
You chase dreams you want the highlife, with the skylights
But in the end your soul's lost, you lost the shine right
Never turn your back ever, on niggas true to you
Stand alone for the cheddar, and they'll be through with you
The highlife; yeah, the highlife
The highlife; yeah, the highlife

You gotta hang out with B. Reezy, and take it easy
It's gettin greasy, I had to learn how to beat me
That's when you go for dolo, and get your meal ticket
And still kick it hardcore I'm runnin real with it
Niggas getting softcore, the people want more
Hardcore shit that's why I give them an encore
Curtains opened, you see the people applaud feelin it
You can't figure out the formula so you're stealin it
Can't stand unoriginal cats with minimal
Skills that's criminal - you fake bitches!
You're lookin for riches, in the wrong places
The faces of death look you in the eye cut off your breath
When you fall feel your knees shatter
The bones breakin with your weak blatter
Pissin on yourself it don't matter
Dead weight, the bed waits for you on the set date
Dreams gone instead fate didn't hesitate
To put you away, close the gates now you're locked out
Your life: cable, with all the porn channels blocked out (damn!)
What you good for? Nothin, so be gone suckers
Have a nice trip see you motherfuckers!

You're in the game called life, son, how you're livin it
Street corner kids growin up blowin up
You chase dreams you want the highlife, with the skylights
But in the end your soul's lost, you lost the shine right
Never turn your back ever, on niggas true to you
Stand alone for the cheddar, and they'll be through with you
The highlife; yeah, the highlife
The highlife; yeah, the highlife

I live for the highlife, get my mind right
Fuck the fame, the game and the limelights
Fools that be out there tryin to duplicate
But they can't match the aura, can't impersonate
See the first things that comes to pass, is the blast
Of the Cypress Hill weed funk blazin up a path
You can't help, but inhale and get strong
You need that good shit all up in your lungs
I live fast, and keep energy in motion
Jah bless, so I feel I been chosen
But I know, (?) of he who conquers
You gotta come strong and sound off like thunder
I check myself and make sure I'm comin real tight
Rhyme for my fam, the G's and the highlife

The highlife - hah, hah
The highlife yeah

You're in the game called life, son, how you're livin it
Street corner kids growin up blowin up
You chase dreams you want the highlife, with the skylights
But in the end your soul's lost, you lost the shine right

'Cause we are answerin', any brothers that've been
On the dick swingin', and straight gatherin'
Enter all the info, cause yo what you're in fo'
Is a crazy day, strapped in a pimp mode
Trapped like a prophet, but I still profit
Even when you're off it, bank's in my pocket
'Cause of my music, what you call me chumpy?
In my trade, the Tribe is known to get funky
Hif is here to hack you down, Son is here to buck you down
Joke's on you, cause you're the biggest duck in town
You've got to relax, we got to kick back
Brothers just sit back, enjoy me like a six pack
As I let the rhyme flow into the hook, yo
Where you gettin' took, but that's another story black

Begin to take your girl, your girl she's the flyest
Flyer than the other broad, hookin' on the fish rod
Isn't that odd, instead of sayin' my dick's hard
It's not about knockin' you, do you feel like clockin' loot?
Forget it, act stupid little sucker I'll be clockin' you
With the right or left hand, duck they was still stand
Troopers on the side step, bucks him down to death man
With the greater lyric, if you can spare it
Just an ass kickin', is what you inherit
So don't try to snake off, you know I can't be shook off
Why the suckers took off? Well that's another story black

Standin' on the corner, close to the real estate
Homes I really feels it get when brothers try to imitate
Meanin' when they simulate, but they can't stimulate
Like a fatty joint, straight from the breath I take
Make me act loco, then switchin' up my vocal
Out to catch you so-called MC's with a roll call
Then you gotta close your eyes, you can't stand the sunlight
There is just one light, the Tribe's buckin' heads tonight!
Buck buck buck ya head! Sorry that Fred is dead
Deader than a doornail, someone cold made his bed
Didn't just break out, the sucker got cracked out
Hit the pipe and blacked out, with the shit from back down
So much more integrity, greatest deal I hook up
Was a funky looker
But that's another story black

Blowin' a hole in the speaker
You don't wanna dis the Perro, the Real One, or the Guerro
Slangin' rhythms through the ghetto
Ya best keep ya ass in check
Come on little mutha fuckas betta show respect
An whats next, the big brown takin' ya down
How ya feel (how ya feel punk)
When your sorry ass can't hang with the Hill

I'm the freaka
I'm the freaka

Nobody even knows how I kick the flow
Slow down, cause ya commin' up too fast

Killafornia,Cypress Hill III: Temples of Boom,1995.0,"Living in the city of the Scandalous
Shiesty motherfuckers, can't even trust my own brothers
So who can I choose to trust, me, that's who
Niggas want a piece of the pie, fuck off and die!
Jealous, envious fools want to rush this
Loco, Cuban ass nigga with the cash, shit
Motherfuckers just get your own, and leave mine alone
Forty-five ways to get sewn
Send you the invitation
To the party of your elimination
I got creeps that play for keeps, (Hardball)
Now I'm laying your ass down to sleep
But every hustler wanna be balling
But I got the balls for the shot calling
I pull strings, the Don King, only in America
Can I hustle, and flex my muscle

-Yeah, man, I've been out here
Running game for eight years
-I know I'm getting tired of standing
On this corner
-Nigga, I want a fat pad, and fly ass pool
Finest motherfucking bitches, jewels
And all that shit, if I got to take it
From a nigga
-Shit, let him run for me then
-I can work for myself, don't have to
Work for nobody, I'll be my own hustler

Where can I roam to get my hustle on
Killafornia, stacking the chips, got the full clips
Loaded and cocked, used to run with the Glock
Nina Millimeters and I'm lighting up the fucking block
Now, who you gonna trust?, who can you trust?
I don't know, but if you coming on my corner
I think I'm gonna bust
You can't handle us, devious, dangerous
Criminal mentality, insanity
I move weight, from state to state
All the niggas moving weight, can you relate?

-Damn, what's up, I see you
Pushing that big time weight
-I told you, I wasn't bullshitting
-You coming up, aight!
-When I seen you three or four
Months ago I told you
-Got respect for a man now
-Handle your shit!

Where can I choose to get my hustle on?
In the alleyway, lighting up all night long
Fuck working at McD's, I'm rolling with the O.Z's
In the QP's, puffing on trees
Who can I trust?, who can you trust?
Not that shady motherfucker in the city Los Scandalous

-Well, well, little man came up a little bit
-It feels good having money in the pocket
-Fuck that nine to five bullshit, right?
-Yeah, kick that shit to the curb
-But you got to look out for the scandalous motherfuckers
Cuz niggas is tricky than a motherfucker
-Yeah, but motherfuckers got to look out for us too
You know what I'm saying
I'm just as shisty as a nigga
-Shit, set me up and niggas are gonna die
-You get set up back, cuz we ain't having that bullshit
-I got your back, you got mine, that goes without saying
-Twenty-seven and mo' baby, twenty-seven and mo'
-Let's get the fuck out of here""",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-killafornia-lyrics
Get it Anyway,Rise Up,2010.0,"I'mma do my thing. let me tell you right now
'Cause I don't know any other way of living my life now
Some of you know the struggle, some of you live in a bubble
Some like you hustlin', some of you just looking for trouble
I don't follow or lead, tommorow's a dream
Pray to God to intervene on all the sorrow I've seen
You want out of here, you can leave when you wanna
Nothing can stop you, if that's your type of persona
Life is shorter now, don't make me say it ten times
I keep going for mine, even in the end times
I can beat the system, come on and say it with me
Show me some optimism, we can take over the city

Staying paid is like the battle of forever more
I stay pedal to the metal, foot on the floor
Earn my keep on the streets, knocking down your doors
I'm by the dollar like everybody oughta be
Don't burn nobody and make the money honestly
Open your home with the internet technology
I get it anyway despite of the economy
See I ain't coughin' unless it makes a profit

Tippin' that bottle, got you forgettin' where you came from
But I'm the same one, where you think my name's from
I'mma keep it moving and never stop till the game's done
Forever we live it, forever we spit it
Remember the minute you witnessed the realest that ever did it
(Quit it)
Still I'm committed no matter what I hear from the critic
People can see through a gimmick, I'm putting on a clinic
We in troubled times, swerving through the double lines
You run ahead on collision course, now you served your time

See I'm talkin' about those whose vocals ain't coming off
A skill to kill at will, but awfully dumb of course
Some go nut, the power of the last one
Slower, flower, blower

Doggone it, another come mierda on it
Now you're wishin', fishin' you could do this
But on the strength, yo, I think you knew this
Was just like a dream, when you supreme, the king
Of a minor league team, bro
Off of 47, swung a load of eleven
Got hit with a pitch like a bitch and went to heaven
Weak ducks, duckin' and buckin'
Sayin' fuck it, ain't worth damn pay the ducats

Hahaha, B-Real and the DOG, motherfucker!
Ha! Yeah

Here we go y'all, that's the nigga head dog
Lunatic smokin loops, loose in your sector
Got my eye on em, on the apparatus
Like a bone to a dog, yea you know I gotta have it
Anywhere you get it shit, and I'mma grab it
Turn around stares to your face and I jab it
Drop you, like one of those ill bad habits
Hunt you, like a hillbilly huntin a rabbit
Cuttin niggas up like Muggs on the wheels
For reals, penetentiary steel
Pull heads to bed from the choke of a headlock
Fadin baldheads to perms, even dreadlocks
BWOY, rudebwoy with me style
I can get foul or wild, or just cool for a while

(Checkmate fool!) Hang em high
Got the live shit, bang em whenever you/he wanna try
Shoot to thrill, be at the Hill, I/we take em all
(Checkmate fool!) Wherever the pawns fall
(Checkmate fool!) Hang em high
Got the live shit, bang em whenever you/he wanna try
Shoot to thrill, be at the Hill, I/we take em all
(Checkmate fool!) Wherever the pawns fall

Look look punk, every way you get shook
To the pawn, takin out the rook, off of the book
Lights get tooken, taken you for Satan
You can't breathe, no need to look up and see me
The last hope, when you mellow you call whoever
For the hype shit, you call the Hill, put it together
Runnin this game, bringin the same, raw shit
Over the hills, through the city we come equipped
To the letter, keepin your temperature down low
What I reveal, the good shit to heal all souls
Makin you roll late night, you trippin, my game's tight
To the new shit I bring, never the same hype
So PUSH THAT SHIT OFF, get up, don't let off
No matter how much blood you spit up
You could never be, fuckin with Greenthumb
The outcome's specific, you spliff it, collapsed lung
We hit hard, breakin your guard, you can't tell
When the bells ring, bustin your shell, the pawn fell

Got the live shit, bang em whenever you/he wanna try
Shoot to thrill, be at the Hill, I/we take em all

I'mma freak that funk yea slam it in the trunk
I'mma kill all junk with the suicide clunk
Ain't nobody came my way, talkin bout
The Westside of L.A., so whatever
Punk-ass click you claim, you keep bumpin that shit
And elevate your frame, cause I want that
Big-time, asshole, studio gangsta
Worth a lot of shit, but that's not the main factor

My nigga Sen's rollin again, remember when
We rocked shows, battlin foes, the time's been long
Strong with the styles, you ain't hear to win
Like blood pourin out of the pen, the ink stains
Slim chance if it gets in your brain, the hot flash
Got you heated with repeated attacks over the tracks
Smack niggas up, back niggas up, hack niggas up
Jack niggas up, hangin the wack niggas up
Snowball effect, we rollin the city limits
Crushin the bitch-ass niggas with all the gimmicks

Jesus Was a Stoner,Elephants on Acid,2018.0,"Jesus was a stoner, uh-huh
Born in southern California, uh-huh
Lying out on the corner, uh-huh
While they're tryna stone us, uh-huh
You wanna stone us, you wanna stone us
Come on stone us
They wanna stone us, they wanna stone us
Come on stoners

I'm called the weed messiah, grab your lighter
You're transfixed with the spliff and your lips higher
Like smoke rises, your sex is heightened
Inhale, embrace Mary, but don't be frightened
I bring the God flower, uplift the people
Holy sacrament communion, take and let me feed you
No superstitions or crucifixions or false prophets
Crosses burnin' in my hand, call it burned object
Smoke gathers like holy masses
Take a hit, pass it to the left, it's in the passage
You know my disciples, this is a new revival
Judas rose and took the soil to enrich the cycle
Smoking Mother Earth, blessed is the herb
Mother Mary save us, thankful for what you gave us
Roll it in my papers, share it with my neighbors
High as skyscrapers, a cult of cultivators
We got the multitude, our sisters and our brothers
How I break my bread like it's the last supper
I'm the blood of stoners, I'm the higher after
Believe me, elevate, hear the sounds of laughter

I be the greenest rapture
Stoner Jesus with the cleanest shatter
Sum of demons, that's some genius banter
Get the screen capture
If you perceive this as some needless chatter
You need to heed the Stoner Jesus chapter
I be the greenest rapture
Stoner Jesus with the cleanest shatter
Sum of demons, that's some genius banter

Yo yo yo - all my niggas say jump up, doc broke out the kennel
A dog on four paws spittin' out the window
Jump up! It ain't no need to fight
We may squeeze the pipe, you gonna bleed tonight
I eat beans and rice, shit up a storm
I walk the streets with shark fin off my arms
Doctor Dolittle, lit off the bone
My bracelet like I raised it off the farm
Home-grown, thick, dirty
My family feud dudes who pack 2's on survey
Jersey and house
Gun like an elephants snout
Pull ya ambulance out
Ya whole team'll get bombarded
Ya on target, and bombed by some unsigned artists
We leave ya hair cut like a blind barber
Cut it, and gave you a line with fine markers
I won't leave till the job is done
Till the last prick nigga take ya wallet, RUN
Doc with the shotty and we both catch a body with Cypress Hill

We don't give a fuck, we live it up till the day we die
You try to deal with us, but you got no blunts to get high
You won't be real with us, but ya reelin' us and you want to ride
You try to deal with us, but you got no blunts to get high

Yo, yo
Blunt smokin', half a bottle of remi open
You either holdin' or half-assed like semi-colon
I leave ya chokin' on them lollipop rhymes ya callin'
So hard, hell I crack the shell on ya candy coatin'
If the shoes fit like Alan I be too thick
Ever since you hit, yo my new chicks a new bitch
Ya know if I can't eat, ya can't sleep
Plus I'm in denial, I just can't admit defeat
My mind is my Glock, keep my third eye cocked
Bust mines off tops, leave a rapper's nerves shocked
Now who's hot and who's not
I want them rocks and that money in ya two socks
Meth the mister, if crime is an art, then let me paint a picture
I'm gone, Kodak can't even frame the riddler
Gold realin', Meth, doc, Cypress Hiller
Whoever think they fuckin' with that, lets be realer

We don't give a fuck, we live it up till the day we die
You try to deal with us, but you got no blunts to get high
You won't be real with us, but ya reelin' us and you want to ride
You try to deal with us, but you got no blunts to get high

Take the back seat and smash beats
Smoke blunts through ya lungs and flips ya brain cells like athletes
Run a track meet, the rhymes on ya rap sheet
With the foot long crush bong, look your collapsing, sicko
They go on the break-off, mental breakdown and shit you wouldn't think of
I spread it to Reggie, chances are better but deadly
You wanna be friendly on the get high Bentley
You twisted up, burnt out within seconds
Cos you couldn't hang with the John Blaze methods
Bong hittin', doc spittin', shark bitten
Star stricken, Glock clickin', stop shittin'
Inhale the smoke from the master's lungs
You wanna roll up, yo I'm the fastest one (ha!)
You wanna test with the sess, well first off
That shit is funny like Kid Rock with his shirt off

You know, motherfuckers need to have some weed etiquete

Can I get a hit of your weed
Can I get a hit of your weed
Can I get a hit of your weed
Can I get a hit of your weed
Can I get a hit of your weed
Can I get a hit of your weed

You know I hate it when I roll a joint and give it to somebody
Who ain't got weed but they wanna be up in the party
Laughin and gigglin, sippin on a Heinie
Son you need a Tic Tac your breath is gonna blind me
Talkin about you wanna hit, spittin in my eardrum
Oh you new in the cypher, step to the rear son
Still they manage to hit it, and put they grip on it
That's when they wet the tip and put they lips on it
Then when you get it, forget it, it's been wetted
Who gonna hit it now, not me, you got me
Thinkin about these fuckin jokers, 
double tokers
Smokers who hit it like they suckin a dick, fuckers
Flippin it, lovin it, smokin it to the head
Givin it to me half way down, ""thanks again""
Then when you see 'em later smokin they own stash
When you ask 'em for a hit, they say, ""sorry this is my hash""
""
I shared some with you, ""Sorry that's not my problem
Talk to the hand but I got plenty if you wanna buy some""
These people piss me off, this is true indeed
But nothin's worse when someone's askin for some weed
What do I look like a tree where the bud grows
Here pick my left nut and smoke it in the bowl
Or better grow your own leave mine alone
Here I'll give you a clone now raise up outta my zone
I know I got the best weed, but don't make me
Make your burnt chest bleed what you need
Is weed etiquette, please don't be offended
Cuz the weed costs money I'm the one who has to spend it

And that's just the way it is man (Can I get a hit of your weed)
Y'all motherfuckers need to learn (Can I get a hit of your weed)
You just can't come (Can I get a hit of your weed)
Askin for some shit and not givin none in return (Can I get a hit of your weed)
What the fuck is that man? (Can I get a hit of your weed)
We goin into 2000 motherfucker
 (Can I get a hit of your weed)
You need to learn how to smoke some weed with people (Can I get a hit of your weed)
Pass it to the left motherfuckers (Can I get a hit of your weed)

Broken dreams what I see when my eyes open
Life's mundane, I'm just going through the motions
See the dream, I want the nightmares come to life
Fighting my demon, heard a voice coming to the light
Soul burning like coal in a steam engine
Silence my enemies swift with a clean endin'
The way Tammy looking for somethin' upliftin'
Intoxicated by the bloodlust, fuck slippin'

No singing no sad songs or kind words by the Reverend
No one sheddin' tears with happy thoughts to think of
The sufferin' and pain, I bring the one you need to speak of
I'm a bad seed, cultivated from anyone in need
I become cheap, one speed
Hit the target and leavin' your souls free
Call it the night, you never stood a chance
Dance with the Devil, two hands on the metal
Two vans in the shadow, one man in the battle
So I slam, I could kill a man, put my foot on the throttle
Tomorrow is gone, headed for the border
No sorrow for those left in the wake of my disorder
My fuse is shorter than most men
Pre-game, you livin' a dream
I send 'em off with no strings attached
I cut them off like a puppeteer, outta here
Don't ever see me again, I disappear
On the run, I live in isolation

When it's over for me, the reaper surely waits
Standin' with my victims, waitin' by the Pearly Gates

Wishin' I could be inside, the life for never me, no
Runnin' 'til my numbers up but now my soul's in Limbo
I look into the darkness while I'm starin' out the window

Close your eyes, tomorrow's gonna be another day
When you wake up in the mornin', they'll be plenty bricks to lay

Ran out of ammo no doubt
My gat is dry like a fuckin' drought
Got to make my way home, hit the gate and get my chrome
Hot damn it's on
They got me cornered lemme just warn ya
I'll pull this trigga make your family mourn'ya
Boo-hoo! Where ya gonna run to
When I pull out the scooby doo
Run! Let me break ya off some
Hit the floor cuz it ain't no fun
But here they come, they must wanna get done
No frontin'. Punk I'll break ya off somethin'!
(1 2 3 that coppa goes down!)
What the fuck I'm rollin'
In a Mack truck that's stolen
Guess what I'm holdin'
Ammo to bust my load
Still I'm easin' on down
The yellow brick road
Whatta ya know? A pig in a plain brown
Wrapper, he wanna bring me down
I'll hit that corner, lemme just warn ya
I'll bring ya ass down make ya family mourn ya
21 gun salute, trying to take my loot
Don't make me shoot
I'll hit my blunt and pass you a lump
And punk let me break ya of something
(break em' off some)
I got to roll with the self control
In the green tank when the shit unfolds
Hold up. I got it sewn up
Me and my niggas are about to blow up
Got the pigs on my tail, what they get
Is the hollow point shell
Caught in the cell
Servin' my sentence, got my apprentice
In the hood but the nigga is senseless
Out on parole, now the nigga has
Turned to my 
fold
, now the punk gotta go
That punk got shady, woudn't repay me
Let the punk know that ya still can't fade me
Maybe the frontin' would stop, but nothin'
Would stop me from havin' to break'em off something
(On to the next spot kid
We ain't havin it yall
Ya know what I'm talkin bout
I'm about to break your ass of some'n!

It Ain’t Nothin’,Rise Up,2010.0,"This is the story of Cypress Hill

I used to carry a Glock on the waist line
Man I don't waste time
I'm strong on the bass line
You'll never taste mine
See me on the screen
Fuckers beggin' for face time
Get your own tape
But don't bother to chase mine
I got a block, man, we havin' a great time
You couldn't fill the shoes
Anytime that I laced mine
Light up the stage
For the homies we make shine
Sick the dogs on you get more by the K-9
Homies on the yard never walk in the main line
The manes find that they can never be in the game
I'm lettin' off rounds
Hittin' blunts at the same time
Pick a crew homie
You a neon to save time
Bitches like you always spittin' the same rhymes
We put you all to shame
You never went through the same grind
Put you in the bind the minute you came by
So stay in your lane and get wet by the rain

You wanna step up get your ass touched
You wanna rap, son, get your ass buff
Try to test us, you's gonna get smashed up
You wanna run wit the dogs? Get your cash up
Git it
You gotta get your straps up
Git it
You gotta get your stash up
Git it
You gotta get amped up
You wanna run wit the dogs?
Get your cash up

I'm right here on the block
When it's time to ride out, you know what I'm all about
Hundred Harley bikes on site when it goes down
Me and my homies, we always holdin' the fort down
Come up in our town and your pissin' a fourth now
Got 4 ounces and 3 bottle's of Jack
2 fifth's in the back and everyone I'm with's strapped
What ever happened
To chin checkin' and wreckin' fools
Try disrespecting me
My Smith & Wesson is endin' you
And I ain't changed since back in the day
Get your shit split quick if you get in my face
You wanna run with the dog
Better stay in your place
Cuss your little ass name, don't hold no weight
And your little ass safe couldn't hold my cake
Get your asks denied down the road I take
And let me tell you one more thing before I skate
If you a fake or a snake, I'mma send you to your grave
You wanna step up get your ass touched
You wanna rap, son, get your ass buff
Try to test us, you's gonna get smashed up
You wanna run wit the dogs? Get your cash up
Git it
You gotta get your straps up
Git it
You gotta get your stash up
Git it
You gotta get amped up
You wanna run wit the dogs? Get your cash up


Im a First Staff OG from outta the gutter
With a fucked up demeanor for you punk mothafuckas
Get played like some dicks who try to start ruckas
I'm a real gun busta so don't ever try to rush us
Can't nobody touch us that don't leave on crutches
Or worse, get a ride in a Hearse with their bodies covered
It's gunna be a cold summer
As soon as the hilt drops
ALL BULLSHIT WILL STOP

A couple scums in the street
We don't care what you Bustas think
It might sink in sometime
But I won't blink
We go against everything
Smoke all the green
Got the flow wrong, swing it ain't nothing to me
We put it down anywhere like it's something to see
So all you bitches goin' rogue with your haters degree
And when you wanna get loud son I'm ready to work
Punks act up and you bound to get hurt
You wanna step up get your ass touched
You wanna rap, son, get your ass buff
Try to test us, you's gonna get smashed up
You wanna run wit the dogs? Get your cash up
Git it
You gotta get your straps up
Git it
You gotta get your stash up
Git it
You gotta get amped up
You wanna run wit the dogs?

Everybody Must Get Stoned,Cypress Hill III: Temples of Boom,1995.0,"This sure is
I got that-a old crazy shit from round the corner you know
The homeboys and the brothers be slangin' this shit
But anyway, (everybody must get stoned (x4))
You over there singin' some shit, talkin' 'bout
Everybody must get stoned
I don't know but that shit sounds good to me

Hit the joint, up the bomb, take a puff
Till you just can't get enough of the skunk
A punk nigga named 
Doe
 wanna take control
But to free
My soul, puff on the endo (keep puffin')
Let me take it in then I let it out (let it out)
One of you motherfuckers pass the white owl
Peace to the niggas in all the Buddha spots
Slangin' fat bags o' weed and runnin from the cops
(runnin' from them fools)
I hit the leño then pass it on
To the cypha' of dreadlocks gettin' stoned
(All the dreadlocks lya')
Roll a fat joint, twist it at the end
'Cos I get high with a little help from my friends (from my friends)

Everybody must get stoned

Hit the blunt or the bong, take a toke
Now my head's in a cloud of smoke and no joke
Caught the up-tight motherfuckers puttin' me down
'Cos I talk about the green shit in every town (Everywhere I go)
You right in front of me, I can't see ya
I'm blind and faded and I got the cheeba
And everything's gonna be alright
When I pass that kush up on the left-hand side
Niggas is havin' a good time tonight
Roll it up, hold it up, pass me the fucking light

Indo or the home-grown
Light it up, everybody must get stoned (gotta get stoned)

Kronologik,Stoned Raiders,2001.0,"You don't know no real shit, nigga (it's the real shit!)
This the original Cypress Hill shit, nigga
We numb niggas, ya don't feel shit, nigga
You ain't on no real shit, nigga
You don't know no real shit, nigga (it's the real shit!)
This the original Cypress Hill shit, nigga
We numb niggas, ya don't feel shit, nigga
You ain't on no real shit, nigga

'91, Cypress Hill burst upon the scene
Three crazy, gun-totin' niggas smokin' weed
Talkin' about life on records was the whole plan
So we put out The Phuncky Feel, but you were feeling Kill A Man
That was about the time we was openin' up for royalties
Didn't know shit, we were jus' tryin' to rock the party
'92, a year later, 'bout a million records sold
From doin' shows like Lollapalooza on the road
Buildin' up momentum, whilst spittin' deadly venom
Takin' pictures for High Times, me, Muggs, and Senen
Chillin' with the Beastie Boys, smokin' lots of weed
But it was time to hit the studio for another LP
'93, Black Sunday hits, with critical acclaim
Had a monster hit from Insane In The Brain
Topped the charts, held the spot, for six weeks to boot
It was a trip to note, that we was the first ones to do it
In rap music, but it was a feat none the less
So we started gettin paid and I stopped smokin' stress

You don't know no real shit, nigga (it's the real shit!)
This the original Cypress Hill shit, nigga
We numb niggas, ya don't feel shit, nigga
You ain't on no real shit, nigga
You don't know no real shit, nigga (it's the real shit!)
This the original Cypress Hill shit, nigga
We numb niggas, ya don't feel shit, nigga
You ain't on no real shit, nigga

'94, still in the door and we conquered many tours
With Rage Against The Machine, House Of Pain and many more
Was even invited to Woodstock, some niggas from the block
Called up Eric Bobo and half a million rocked
How could all this happen at 24 years of age?
Half a million bouncin' to your shit from off the stage
'95, I was alive and survived so far
Still tryin' to cope with bein' a Rap Star
'Cos that's the type of shit that can really affect your mental
This was evident, in the way I broke the tempo
With confusion, (I'm havin' Illusions) pain, and hence illusions
But I still kept my set up with the critics bein' abusive (yeah)
Even the record company, they became illusive
When it comes to showin' support for the Cypress institution
'96, with no support we were still makin' moves
Cypress Hill, in the summer, we were on the Smokin' Grooves
But like every legend every clique, someone had to split
So the Dog left the house, shit was gettin' kinda thick
I was with the electric lady, we was talkin' about babies
But the groupies on the road don't help me from misbehavin'

You don't know no real shit, nigga (it's the real shit!)
This the original Cypress Hill shit, nigga
We numb niggas, ya don't feel shit, nigga
You ain't on no real shit, nigga

'97 was the trip, it was the year we killed the feud
Between us and Cube, over shit nobody knew
The Dog came back home but after Smokin' Grooves 2
Chillin' with George Clinton and Erykah Badu
This was a crazy time, we were flowin' off the boo
Niggas on stage, trippin' on the 'shrooms
'98 was kinda great, cos it felt just like before
We hit the studio, recorded Cypress Hill IV
But someone dropped the ball, as I still recall
'Cos it felt Cypress Hill got no support at all
We did the last Smokin' Grooves, but did it all with Sen
And the old chemistry, just reared it's head again
'99 I got to recline, because there was no doubt
That the first year was a success, of the Smoke Out
'99 was even better than the year of '98
And Skull And Bones was comin' out, kickin' from the gate
2000, 15 million records sold
They broke the mould, but there's others along the road
But we still keep rollin' on from Heaven to Atlantis
Droppin' shit in English and makin' albums in Spanish
2001, goddamn, who knows what's in store?
Just as long as motherfuckers know, who's knockin' on the door
We remain unjaded and still we go unfaded
See how long we made it and never ben outdated

We ain't goin out, motherfucker (That's right, FUCK that!)
You don't know, (it's big time Cypress Hill)
(Motherfuckin' renovaters up here)

You don't know no real shit, nigga (it's the real shit!)
This the original Cypress Hill shit, nigga
We numb niggas, ya don't feel shit, nigga
You ain't on no real shit, nigga
You don't know no real shit, nigga (it's the real shit!)

Memories,Stoned Raiders,2001.0,"As I sit in my silver stack thinking about way back
Even before I started blazing the chronic sack
I was a young wild unfocused troublesome kid
Looking up to all the gangsters and the shit they did
I was at an impressionable age through a faze
An unmentionable stage deranged full of rage
Walking through life in a haze with dark clouds
Hanging over my head being wicked and loud
And sometimes those demons haunt me and taunt me
Follow me pursue me confuse me they want me
They come at me from all angles and dangles
Memories in front of me, but I won't run away
I put the gun away but sometimes my hand ditches
But I don't want to get locked away cause I whack bitches
I left those ways back in the old days
So go away I don't got no time to throw away

Memories they haunt me (They haunt me)
They follow me to the day I die (We fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (They haunt me)
They follow me to the day I die (Got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive)

I got my education on the streets
And I learned how to spit rhymes out with or without beats
To say whatever I went through or going through
Tripping off people who acting like they been knowin you
Learn how some of these record companies be holdin you
Attaching an image in the end controllin you
But we set out to set ourselves apart
And let these people know just what they had from the start
It's like Ghostface said we studied our art form
We turned the mike on and spit a fucking dark storm
People slept on me and doubted my skill level
But I'm tenacious and I got a strong will level
You been introduced to some of the real rebels
Injected with venom from god to kill devils

Memories they haunt me (They haunt me)
They follow me to the day I die (We fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (They haunt me)
They follow me to the day I die (Got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive)
Memories they haunt me (They haunt me)
They follow me to the day I die (We fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (They haunt me)
They follow me to the day I die (Got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive)

I remember my days as youth
Teenage gangsters with somethin to prove
See man amuse and we creep and we strew
Catch your ass slipping and dump on their crew
Just -- having fun but you crazy kids
Never thought about no prison beds
Got gang-sters twenty-five and alive
Never see the kids all fucking wild
But that's the game and shit don't change
Get respect for smoking brains
You get a name and you build your rep
You courting fools coming in your set
Before you know we're having fun
Slamming doping and packing gun
Leaving mad traces and blasting their faces
Got a hundred years for all my fucking cases

Memories they haunt me (They haunt me)
They follow me to the day I die (We fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (They haunt me)
They follow me to the day I die (Got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive)
Memories they haunt me (They haunt me)

Throw your hands in the air, the Hill's live and direct, see
So let me put my clip in, watch this nigga start flippin'
My, why must they always be trippin'?
Shut up, what up, fool tried to nut up
Dropped the gat, riccocheted, the fool got cut up
(Why'd you drop the gat, G?)  I got hit from behind
Now a nigga like me, I gotta go for mine
Bring it on, bing, make ya bells ring
When ya hit that pavement, what a feeling
It's on, cracked like a baseball bat
Oh shiiiiiiiit, out the boot came a gat
Pointed (aimed) the nigga said ""You're through!""

I remember the time them niggas tried to get me (I ain't havin' it)
Throw your gats in the air if you wanna come test me
So let me just run through, as I pull out my Scooby-Doo
I get the chills when I see that dead man's crew
I got to get up, let's go head up, dead up
I'm loc'ed like that, punk, that's why you're gettin' wet-up
Want me to let up, but I ain't tryin' to hear that
Bullshit cryin', punk, let me just clear that
Buck a shot, lick a two shot, lick a three shot
Ran out of ammo, damn, I ain't tryin' to get got
Two niggas standin', dirty under-handed
Lighter shade of fire, check my slug expanded
Now tell me what the fuck are you gonna do
When I pull out my Scooby-Doo?

Outro:  B-Real (Mexican dialect?)
Take a good look ... 'cause this is the last time you're gonna see
Fat bell like this again, you fat piece a chit!  Kid muchacho
Muchacho kid, get flabby - (oh - choot that piece a chit.)  You
Fuckin' lobsta piece a CHIT!  I'll stomp you like a duck.  And you ...

Child of the Wild West,Blade II: The Soundtrack ,UnKnown,"I traveled many miles above the dark road ahead of me
Obstacles in front of me but I kept movin' steadily
Enemies wanted to face off, grip the fingers threaten me
But I ain't goin' out grip and sit firm and readily
I'm a child of the wild west keepin' you guessin' constantly
Usin' this lumen and y'all don't know how to respond to me
It's simple, keep ya mouth shut I don't care what ya want from me
Pump up the volume so ya eardrums are rattlin'

Hurt em' then I murdered them
Think that's competition cause I've never heard of him
I hurt em' then I murder them
If they come runnin' up I make them hurt again

Your rhymeness and blindness, just find out who was rhymeless
The shit weighs out in a month, the loss goes on timeless
Ya rolled into crimeless, aggravated and shineless
I designed this for the lost who need to find this
The blind baby and maybe you need someone to lead you
Stop actin' like an infant, I'm tired of force feedin' you
You can't keep runnin' from the destiny that's meetin' you
It's your own soul, your own ghost that keeps beatin' you


Pump up the volume so ya eardrums are rattlin'
This is just a warning before I begin battlin'
Unsensible with ya actions with ya tractions
I'm facin' the methodical, serial rhymes in my state
Meets periodical, we're in a hostile, colossal
Situation and it's possible to get from the bust, bust, bust
From penetration, lyrical blows
You cynical hoes are speechless


The psychological, projectile article missionary
Start to realize what the fuck in speech is scary
It's diabolical, straddle on top of you
When mister rebels spray levels of melodical
With doses of venom, big toke go hypnotic
Go for broke cause if ya lose control ya end up in the hospital

One time's tryin to gaffle me, harassin me
Tryin to send me to the penetentiary

In the nighttime, niggas are creepin you fuckin sleepin
And the beat, just keeps on seepin into the street
While you peakin I'm meetin and greetin the people speakin
And leadin the motherfuckers who's seekin to catch, ruckus
Meaning you suckers no-luckers overdub us, nut hug us
You love us, you can't stop, these mad audio hustlers

Blood on My Hands Again,Elephants on Acid,2018.0,"All you devils plotting on the god and on his throne
Blood on my hands again
Blood on my hands again
Blood on my hands again

From the darkest corners of the world with
(Demons, twisted suffering)
They tried to walk amongst the livin', corrupt the kings that
(Dreams of nothing)
They see the man in the shadows, lights a fire, lookin' for the one
Ridin' on the pale horse, blade and head (Death has come)
Fear the reaper when you see his face, in this case, you're lost
Wicked dreams of glory, tell me what your soul has cost
I'm the vengeance of the meek, with the hammer of the people
I'm the tip of the spear thrown by God (At the evil)
As I move upon the wicked through the mist with one objective
Send 'em back into the fire, then you gon' be resurrected
Sickened soul taken quickly from the shell (From the ruly)
Angels cryin' up in Heaven for the path that I have chosen

As the wind blows swiftly, fire rises in the night
With my blade takin' flight, souls are reachin' for the light
Your favorite beat, go 'head and get it
Tell 'em I'm the one who sent you
If the one who brings the rain and pose as evil that you men do
Heard the sounds of the trumpets blown, a king rises to the throne
God saved the king unless God wants me to bring him home
Stick the razor's edge in the light, my blade is clean
Until it's pressed against your neck, and now you're eternal dreamin'

And only God could judge me for those things I had to clean away
The tidal wave, it came and washed every single thing away
And as I stray, lookin' for the day the maker makes a plan
I'll be lurkin' in the shadow with your blood upon my hands

All you devils plotting on the god and on his throne
Blood on my hands again
Blood on my hands again
Blood on my hands again

Warlord,Elephants on Acid,2018.0,"I was born with thunder up in my hands to silence all of the lambs
I've conquered so many lands, put up with whatever man
A sucker for God's plan, the journey eternal
Hell fire spreading wide, now you're in the inferno
Pray to God to intervene, you feel it, your inner being
The sinner sings a song, plays all day
Will it bring peace, to the hearts of men?
Spending life on the frontlines of life, to no end
Waste of time, wasting away
Wasting the day, tasting the bitterness of hate
Face of decay, lead 'em off into the dark
They follow me from the start
With the light chasin' the demons, runnin' from the spark
I'm the sword, guns clutch, swingin' at the unjust
Just one touch from the blade that cuts us
Leading the rat race where losers are born
When it's above you, whatever form, it goes on
The cycle, perpetual, death is eventual
If you ain't givin' no hundred percent, unacceptable

March on the Devil
March on the Devil
March on the Devil
March on the Devil
March on the Devil
March on the Devil
March on the Devil
March on the Devil

I was formed with fire upon the blade
The violence and the crusade
The engine is cultivated where the revel is made
Invading with the horde on a white horse, just a warlord
The country is war-torn and that's love, it's a universal way
The archangel gon' hang in the clouds and they watch us pray
For the glory of history, intimate story
Night of the Templar and the tempest warning
God's too delayed, we'll give the prayers to the fallen
Hymns are callin' if you willin', give yourself and we go all in
Ritual beginning, individual strike
A violent, quick, in descendence of height
Feel her soul elevate while enemies lie in wait
I'm sendin' 'em to the gate, kill them, we the hate
Be eaten at the rat race where losers are born, winners are loved
When it's performed, it goes on
The cycle, perpetual, death is eventual
You ain't givin' a hundred percent, unacceptable

March on the Devil
March on the Devil

Loco In El Coco,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Para ese que se hace, pero nunca gana
Tira ese jamon en la pala
Y gana como rana, rana, estoy en la pista
Me siento como el hijo que conquista
No me hagas romperte fuerte
La silla me tiene como General Electric
Y las luces brillando, estoy pensando
No es lo mismo cuando estoy tomando
Ohh! mi mente despacio (despacio)
Por eso yo no trago del 4.0
Brother dame la yerba
Porque un negro como yo tan perdiendo la cabeza

Medio loco en el coco
(Ido de la mente!)

Hago lo mio por abajo, ahora en el tubo
Para el voto, ponerse hasta mas gordo
Gordinflon en la dieta no te metas
Te robo a ti como ladron en la revuelta
Lo mio tiene fuerza, te tiro en la tierra
Con tu cara en el piso y tu cuerpo todo tuerca
Duros, tienes algunos, pero, no a mi, yo soy numero uno
Pateo el estilo, de espiral del rio
Pero cara de payaso, nunca me rio
Con mi seria cara, te lo digo todo
Un negro como yo se esta volviendo loco

Medio loco en el coco
(Ido de la mente!)

Como Louis tengo fuerza, toca trompeta
Le pego a la pipa y aplasto tu cabeza
Rapido, dame a mi mi loteria
Policia, quiere coger lo que crecia
Los puercos quieren soplar mi casa
Pero estoy por abajo con mi grasa
Pah se ponen bravos porque no estoy ahi
Estoy en mi Cadillac, hace tiempo que me fui
Soy el pirata, piloto del bote
Cuando estoy alto como un papalote
Corre de la luz de la chota
Cree en lo que no ves, cree en la lota
Mira, pero no te vuelvas loco
Un negro como yo, ya perdio su coco

Till Death Do Us Part,Till Death Do Us Part,2004.0,"How many times have we been thru this
I can tell you that it's getting harder everytime I try to resist
We go way back and you held me down
And you helped me keep my feet moving in the ground
No matter what situation occasion
You were amazing, you knew just what it took to keep our love blazing
The thug in me, but when we separated I was thinkin foolishly
Remember when your ex boy tried to bug on me
I told him: ""bring it on, I'll buy you a slug on me""
He didn't like that but didn't want the fight
Fuck 'im, he didn't know how to treat you right
We go hand in hand they don't understand a man
But you do and I really respect that, damn
We been down so long but it's all good
That's why I dedicate this song

Till Death Do Us Part
I do

Who would have thought it would last so long
So many loose-sighted think that they can't go wrong
I know I make so many mistakes
I know you felt neglected, you called me ""outta line""
If you thought I didn't respect it - I heard ya
But I never showed an emotion
If I haven't ever said it, you got all my devotion
When I fell hard you picked me up
Made me think about my life, where I'm going, a little tricky - huh?
I know at times, that you thought I would change
But I'm the same motherfucking brother even in spite of the fame
There might be some times we don't agree on somethin'
But don't never feel your thoughts don't mean nothing
Some'll try to steer you wrong, I'm not one of those people
Always tell it like it is, cos the truth will free you, but don't get mad
When the truth is lethal, I'm only telling you cause I got your back


You got my mind right and I don't know how you did it
When I trip not too many who can put with it
But you still there, still care, so rare - oh yeah
Got so much love, when you need, you can go there
I appreciate what you're doing for me
I had to open up my eyes so I can see the minutes we lost
Whenever I was out on tour, or gone, we can make 'em up, like never before
You want all the little things, that make it worth it
Why not, we can get it, we can both deserve it
It's hard, but nothing good, is ever so easy
We have a bond that won't break, no mistake, believe me
Till Death Do Us Part, like I said from the start
You're the light that guides me thru when I'm in the dark
They said we'd neverlast but we're still strong
That's why I dedicate this song - C'mon
 - 4X

Lalalala-lala-lalala
Lalalala-lala-lalala
Lalalala-lala-lalala

I'll admit, I was a wild seed when I was a kid
Slangin dope, poppin Shroomz and droppin lots of 'cid
Psychodelic visions would ensue my view
Feelin the alter-states as they altered my fate
But our sordid due, all that distorted shit brought it up
I came short and couldn't afford to store it up
So I began to record it on audio
The autobiography of Luis Mario
Something that's unbelievable, inconceivable
That half the shit I set out to do was achievable
But alas, look at all the shit come to pass
While we remained strong, others broke like glass
Cos you lack style, and you need all the help brother
Cos you're fragile, and it should say it on your cover:
This side up, for the celebrity
Who lacks intelligence, integrity, intensity
Oh it's true, I got you in that angle like Kurt
But don't go gettin your fuckin feelings hurt
I spit many bars of heat, that burn like a furnace, I pour rhymes out like
Coffee spillin out your thermos

(Lalalala-lala-lalala)
I got my 9mm at my waist, papa
I got my shotgun in the escalade, papa
You feel groggy then jump and get sprayed, papa
I don't wanna but you dug your own grave, papa
(Lalalala-lala-lalala)
I got my 9mm at my waist, papa
I got my shotgun in the escalade, papa
You feel groggy then jump and get sprayed, papa
I don't wanna but you dug your own grave, papa

You know me and you've grown with me
And if I had a big enough pad, I'd take you all home with me
I don't walk around with bodyguards, that's not me
I'm hangin out with the people as my posse
Used to have a lot of enemies with bad intentions
Spreading gossip like disease, creating lots of tension
People turn around when you become a star it seems
But others hate you all cos you've fulfilled all your dreams
They smile in your face and act like nothing's wrong
When you turn your back, they hate, and play one of your songs
Why don't you take your mask off, look me in the eye?
You afraid I might blast-off and call you on your lie?
Take a deep one, and peep son
Retribution comes around more than once, like a re-run
You're a cheap one, the hill's so steep, son
You're just another one who gets thrown in the quay, son

(Lalalala-lala-lalala)
I got my 9mm at my waist, papa
I got my shotgun in the escalade, papa
You feel groggy then jump and get sprayed, papa
I don't wanna but you dug your own grave, papa
(Lalalala-lala-lalala)
I got my 9mm at my waist, papa
I got my shotgun in the escalade, papa
You feel groggy then jump and get sprayed, papa
I don't wanna but you dug your own grave, papa

You know they smile in your face
You know they try to take space
I let you punks know you ain't safe
Cos you know you're just dead-weight
But at the present day they gettin stalled out for some reason
But not from me, because it's punk-hunt season
Charged with high-treason, I'm easin the blow never
The body that you're leasin, ain't gonna roll forever
So think about that, is it worth the pain?
When you flirt with pain, bitch it'll hurt your brain
But you're thick-headed, numbskull and rig-setted
It was the moment you feared, when my venom spreaded

I got my 9mm at my waist, papa
I got my shotgun in the escalade, papa
You feel groggy then jump and get sprayed, papa
I don't wanna but you dug your own grave, papa

You say I'm the joint, but you can call me hooda
Computer, wizard, the butcher of scissors
Cut me up, then spark me, blow me out like a blizzard
Dwellin' your cells up, lungs start to swell up
Your pipe's gettin' crowded, yo just forget about it
Me, is potent, so bring an opponent
You could suck on that shit, I know you wanted it

Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
B-Real, light another

I'm smoother than a menthol cigarette
How could you figure, or even, consider that
I'm, a weak seed? No, I'm the Humboldt weed
I think that you need this spliff, this tweed
Any type of stylee, how do you spell it?
Take a hit from LA, New York into Phillie
Hit some Visine, smell the smoke and let out
Now do you really think you can take the red out it?

Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
B-Real, light another

Spliff, aiyya, get on by ya
Why ya, want ta, turn off the fire?
You can't get higher, when you turn me off and
.. aiyyo, pussy stop coughin'
You're wastin' the lingo, soon all the sack's gone
He'll take this bounty rhyme for you to stack on
Anyway you have it, you love me like Mary Jane
Or a 40 to the head, like my brother Kenny Wayne
You need to inhale, musical paraphen'
Yes musical, Muggs fixed the trend
Ahhh, just like a head
Brain cells get lit, but I'm the joint you can't grip
Through, your finger, I'll start to sting ya
So just hear my words linger and

Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
Yo Muggs, light another!

Put me in the bambu, with just the tape deck
And the white brother rewinds the cassette
Was it, because it's funky that ya loves it?
(Yeah man) Here's another lyric, go puff it
Don't choke off, the hype or croak off
When you blow the smoke off, hold until I get off
Or turn off the fat joint, wanna hit that joint
Here is the flat point, I rob it at gun point
I'm, the High Times, you get through my rhymes
Suck on the pipeline, sit back and recline
You gotta suck on, the fattie so come on and

Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
I'll just, light another

Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
Yo, light another
You wanna feel the effects of the high?
You wanna feel the effects of the high?
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
Aiyyo, light another

Better have a hustle if you mean to survive

Talkin' is smog you're fate's signed and sealed

Expressin my thoughts, lettin my nuts out in the walls
Of sleep, I can't keep it all in the hall clear
While others keep it inside for the pride they hold dear
Shoulda been, woulda been, coulda been the cops
Stop look and listen, you'll get a vision of hip-hop
Individuals lookin to the battle the shadows of man
See it all, be it all, you need a plan
It takes one man to understand this
Learn fuckin with a deadly gas, you get burned
From the window of my room, I shoot all stars
Every little bit you consume, the high cost
Of living it's all given to you, don't lose it
Every man's given a tool, but don't use it

From the window of my room, assume all's lost
Every little bit you consume, the high cost
Break free, you're selling your soul, for a fee
But all that shit ain't worth it, you burnin up see
The window of my room, assume all's lost
Every little bit you consume, is high cost
Break free, you're selling your soul, for a fee
But all that shit ain't worth it, you burnin up see

From the window of my room, the gloom spreadin across
The land of milk and honey, no money to feed the boss
Funny the cost of life, cut clean blood streams
Out the body, nobody wants you dreamin about shorty
No longer don't need a 40 to take away any pain
So punk me and I'll give you the world exact change
Or quote me and you're never the same, I claim no one
I show none the weakness individuals go forth ya seek this
Wherever I roam is home to me
You Shogun, look at my enemies try to do me
The influential status, you know the baddest
Lookie here, show you what that is, bringin the madness
Sadness to those appealin to any conflict
Lookin out my window pane, I see you fallin
What are you a man or a mouse, the house light
Shinin within, that's when you begin to live again

From the window of my room, assume all's lost
Every little bit you consume, the high cost
Break free, you're selling your soul, for a fee
But all that shit ain't worth it, you burnin up see
The window of my room, assume all's lost
Every little bit you consume, is high cost
Break free, you're selling your soul, for a fee
But all that shit ain't worth it, you burnin up see

From my window I can see
Humanity, goin insane G
Everybody want respect, but you gotta collect
Only hardcore vatos on the set
Don't get me wrong but some rhymes get twisted
There it goes, the pride, you missed it
I ain't upset with the motherfucker dissin
Find me in Watts when you wanna come hit me
Some shit ain't what it seems, in the land of dreams
Some sell their soul to get the cream
From the teens I don't sling or slang no crack
I'm known for bringin in funky ass raps
See those magazine crews and I'm a goner
Dull interviews with these damn primadonnas
Unlike some of these fools on the turf
Look like the real thing, but they soft like Nerfs
So unrehearsed that it shows in the product
Need to get the fuck out, before you get caught up

From the window of my room, assume all's lost
Every little bit you consume, the high cost
Break free, you're selling your soul, for a fee
But all that shit ain't worth it, you burnin up see
The window of my room, assume all's lost
Every little bit you consume, is high cost
Break free, you're selling your soul, for a fee
But all that shit ain't worth it, you burnin up see",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-from-the-window-of-my-room-lyrics
16 Men Till There’s No Men Left,Cypress Hill IV,1998.0,"""Ladies and gentlemen
We would like to present to you
A group that is simply just marvelous, just marvelous
Ladies and gentlemen, Cypress, Hill""

16 men on a dead man's list
Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo!
16 men till there's no one left
Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo!

So many fuckin emcees claim supremacy
On whose got hip-hop locked, it could never be
One who is solo, runnin the whole game
That's bullshit, like cops never sniffed cocaine
But I'm taking on all comers, droppin bombers
Reducin numbers, makin it hot like the summer
This, one emcee he couldn't deal with the skill
Like Jack did Jill, I rolled his ass down the Hill
Beaten broken and coughin and chokin on the rhyme
Like a hooker, suckin a dick for the first time
His, rhyme was hollow with no flow to follow
Bust a nut, all in your mouth, and made him swollow
I take 16 emcees, lock em in a room
Make em feel the contact, eatin the mushrooms
Playin with your mind, makin you feel the Force
Had to cancel out, two punk niggas up in The Source
Tried to get XXL, they still fell
Bitches go tell your troubles to Montel

16 men now there's 13 left
Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo!
16 men now there's 13 left
Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo!

I'm trippin on the people controllin the airwaves
Got it goin on, you know it all, but God save
Your ass for clashin with the Soul Assassin
That's like Mike fuckin with Poppa Joe Jackson
Ass-whoop all over the place, you can't hide behind
The physical, better run to the spiritual
Ass-whoop critical, or you can get it
From the lyrical, bitch-made niggas are invisible
Dysfunctional, hypocritical, smile in your face
The fuckin cynical shit brains
As I sit back and say, TALLY-HO!
One of these days your punk ass gonna go
Guess you had a key to figure the fuckin flow
But you're locked out, and the bomb's about to blow

16 men let me see who's next
Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo!
16 men till there's no one left
Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo!

Twelve punks to go, who's next on the list
Matter of fact I got one in my head to fix
There was one particular fool in the circle who fell off
Greed overcame the nigga who at all costs
Changed up to gain it all, but shared none
Who made him all the money to overcome?
Niggas up on the Hill, in the lab
He was rollin big balla style, high profile
Oh child, make me wanna act juvenile
All smiles, right in my face, but wait a minute now
Welcome to the 360, degrees
Pay a fee when you fuckin your people over the cheese
No soul, no conscience, no loyalty
To the niggas who got him treated, like royalty
Aiyyo time's up, you're gonna end up seein visions
Of everybody, you fucked over, you're Scared Sober

16 men till there's no one left
Yo-ho-ho them niggas has gotta go
16 men till there's no one left
Yo-ho-ho them niggas has gotta go

Fuck the hater with the symbol and no soul
And that bitch nigga who stole my car stereo
Trick Deez, gets no love, she gets nuts
Like Ass Miller, and that fuckin ex-dealer
Can't forget the nigga who was down with the Hill-a
And that punk who tried to dip into the squealer
You get bucked like C. Tucker and Will Bennett
Let me step, over the hump, and represent it
You go down like Jerry, and get smacked
Like Trick Leo, now here's your fuckin eulogy-o!

That was 16 men now there's no one left
Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo
16 men now there's no one left
Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-16-men-till-theres-no-men-left-lyrics

Oh what you missed this you got to bear witness
Catch a ho and another ho Merry Christmas
Yes I smoke shit straight off the roach clip
I roach it roll the blunt at once to approach it
Forward motion make you sway like the ocean
The herb is more than just a powerful potion
What's the commotion, yo I'm not joking around
People learning about, what they're smoking
My oven's on high, when I roast the quail
Tell Bill Clinton to go and inhale
Exhale, now you felt the funk of the Thai
Now feel the effects...

Better just scatter, or you're gettin' leaded
I'm the one who said it, boy it doesn't matter
You're gonna get splattered with my funky ill juice
Cause I'm ""The Phuncky Feel One"", makin' you get real loose

From what you want me to select
Different forms of beta, psycho for alpha

Serpico: ""No....just the division""

""Yeah, once again, (that's right)
We about to attack this
(Harlem Inc, Murder Inc) Yeah

Jimmy Cagney type shit, Nicky Santoro
All my little short niggas
Joe Pesci and all that shit like this yo""

Filling out the cards to your eulogy
Murder that ass, send my regards to your family, fuck it
That's what niggas get for fuckin with this maniac depressive nigga
With aggression, Smith and Wesson, in his possession
Harlem got me like that, too many grimy, slimy niggas on the take
For short cake, we won't hesistate
I miss inhabitants who politic in residence for presidents
Across 110th, to 55th
My covenant is protected, I'm doministic
Survival principles my ethics, eastern philosophy's my method
Good samaritans need paremedics, so what's your premise
I hope you fuckin with Glocks and fo' fifths
Wrath's Napoleon, so teach your origin, slash wrists
Shatter chins, and bust clips
Check it, ""here is something you can't understand""
Steel Magnolia

I got the steel magnum, braggin, leavin my toe tagged
As I get raggamuffin, no bluffin, the body bagged
Breaks all your bad habits, bad blood fanatics
Clean up the magic, chrome startin up static
Greed means that you die quick, click the vision
Greed lies anmbition, five slugs for the mission
Seven cause you go to the heaven or hell and dwell
To meet your maker, but you met the shotgun shell
Buckshots sting like bees, I smoke trees
On the hilltops, clubshops and chilling overseas
Take in the breeze, Mr. Freeze squeeze the trigger
Killa G's got you week in the knees, to take it ea-sy!

Steel Magnolia
Magnificent guns bust when 'Uzi Weighs a Ton'
And yo' Glock spits, consecutive rounds shot from clips
Spells murder, sound synonymous to burner
Leave niggas ass up, gaspin for air, front seats of truck
So who the fuck want me to press on they luck, bastard they son
When gats start to hum and whole crowds begin to run
Annihilation, destroyin all expectations
Have relatives embrace your Harlem hopital, we all patient
5 foot 6, concealed steel, pop more grip
With fixed sights that drifted to right, triggers light
So relinquish son, I'm to the finish, and you acknowledge
Couldn't pop a clutch or light a skyrocket, nigga stop it!
Steel Magnolia

Steel Magnolia, bury ya, six niggas carry ya
To your final rest area
What you worried though, you ain't above that with a slug
And your chest beats, blowin out your back, take it easy
To your eulogy, open heart surgery
Emergency, 911, come in a hurry
From the Hills to the Polo realms, stackin the bills
I put you under my lo-lo, hit my switch, then kill
A bitch nigga steppin on my toes, fuck foes and hoes
Get stuck in the ass like Pete Rose
I suppose you wanna get wild and throw blows, you chose
To get you nose your broke, in a thick cloud of smoke
You're like a fat joint, I'm takin a toke, I'm like coke
But you ain't smilin, feelin erratic, a fuckin addict
To the dope shit, you better hope the shit stop
Smooth, holdin the Glock, rockin the hot shit

Pasa la lumbre para quemar

With the kush weed that would hurt you
If you got the purple we can blaze it
Either way, the high you search
You shoulda bought
Then you know the rules before you hit it once
When you catch my blunt
You know which way to pass it when it comes
Pass the joint on the left hand side
Don't ever pass it on the right
Never ash it on my Nike
If you sprinkle hash in it
Just don't let it out your sight
'Cause if you take it outta sight
Well ya just beggin' for a fight, aight
Give me a lighter
So why you can't decipher, ignite it
Puff Puff Pass homie
Don't just stand and try to hide it
I smoke a bowl or a spliff and uplift my spirits
Then I take a bong hit
Hit it fuckin' hard and clear it
Hit it with the left hand

I'm center stage high
Civic center stage dive
Even summer, winter, spring
And fall, ain't the same
My heads in the clouds
Of smoke then I choke and laugh
Then toke on the left hand side
No joke work
Can touch these Los Angeles souls
We twist herbs up
The word's a dangerous flow (Go!)
(Only on the left hand...)
When I smoke, I'm tilted to the side like a kick stand
Roll up a rock and call me a middle man
I'm sinkin' a riddle like it was quicksand
One *snort* clear out your nasal passage
Wit the medicine of Dristan
Voila, my mind at ease
The Policeman (Whoop-Whoop) wanna come find my trees
Hashish from Iraq
Will make my eyes chinese
Tearing up the studio just tryin' to find my keys

Life's about timin' it, and time, it waits for nobody
It's like a fuckin' drug controllin' your mind and your whole body
Burnin' from your soul, yearnin' for more in this, how come he
Livin' the life of royalty? I take what I want, naturally
You're the casualty as we casually take you tragically
Magically make you disappear, randomly cause calamity

Sittin' in the Cali sun, heat it up

I keep fallin' down (Stay down)
I keep fallin' down, I keep fallin' down
I keep fallin' down (Stay down)

This is the insanity, get this dose of anarchy
Soak in all of the vanity, devoid of all humanity, examine me
Break apart your family, randomly
'Cause what ahead of me? This is a rhapsody, a tragedy
Examine me, take a close look like a man, throwin' the ghost hook
Got you fuckin' shook, and now I close the book
As I'm walkin' through the park, got you scared of the dark
Frightened by the shadows, I'm the one that is behind

Sittin' in the Cali sun, heat it up
Sittin' in the Cali sun, heat it up

Smuggler’s Blues,Cypress Hill III: Temples of Boom,1995.0,"I got the sawed off shotgun
Hand on the pump
With the fucking red bastard
Snitching like a punk
I had the operation tight the flaws
Faded doors
Indo growin room on the basement floor
I'm holding weight every 30 days
Business pays
So many ways
Many methods of moving my white haze
I got the cellophane, get this money tonite
I got the shipment goin out
Got to be air tight
So when you fuck around
No time for me to fuck around
I got the ballin niggas waitin on me
At the compound
So get the trucks ready, and let's hit the back roads
To scam this motherfuckin' ass border patrol
I got my cousin Huey paid
For lookin away
Back on the 405 on the way to LA


I'm multiplying in my head
Just how much stash it's gonna take for me
To double and triple up all my cash
I hit the city limits, time for me to check myself
Cause I don't wanna sit inside no fuckin cell
Slope the rolls down, hold down, I see the gate
So I'm pulling up, and I hope these fools ain't late
Or I'm outta here, wait, no, I see them in the rear
With 3 or 4 fools holding 2's in the real
I got the double barrel shit, hidden under my coat
For any crazy eyed motherfucker rockin the boat
I got the big boss hoss, just sippin the sauce
You got the shit? you got the money?
Then break the shit off

Check out the herb man smugglin' (Smuggler)

This is for the herb man sumgglin' (Smuggler)
I know it's your daily livin' (Smuggler)

I came a long, long way from slangin the herb
Sometimes I think about when I was kickin it to the curb
Now it's dirt in my pocket
But shit done changed
Tatoos on my body and fat gold chains
Got the mega shipment that must go out
On the same route me and my cousins started out
Head back to Mexico for a friend of mine
We're gonna bring this shit load back, 4-0 pounds
It's like clockwork, cause we done this shit before
Now I loaded up the stash on the hollow floor
Double checkin everything, now it all looks cool
Now we rollin to the border like we used to do
We pulled up at the border, but something was wrong
I began to realize that the swoop was on
I had the DEA and immigration closin' in
They had dogs all around my shit, no way to win
They lookin in the truck, now I know the shit's for blast
DEA agent sayin ""now I got your ass""
It's been a long time smugglin, now I'm done
It's all over now, it's lookin' like I'm Audi, son

Now I'm headed up the river with the boat and no paddle (Smuggler)
And they got me in lock down (Smuggler)
Big up to the herb man smugglin' (Smuggler)

Me queria bajar la feria este ladron

Dicen que voy a caer y voy a quedar

Quedo bien locote
Un toque, fumo pa calmarme

Caminando solo, a mi no me conoce nadie

Un delinquente solo ves
Y recuerdo que aqui han muerto mis carnales
Quiero que paren esto
Pero no voy a morir por mi propia mano...

Insane OG,Elephants on Acid,2018.0,"See I started as a soldier in our culture, in the shadows
My approach with every note is like I'm copin' with the battle
Every move is calculated, celebrated, no more lessons
Hit you quick, I don't get caught, I got no time for no confessions
Never move in one direction, no detection, I ain't slippin'
If you question where I'm headed, then your body comes up missin'
Bullets hissin', bodies twistin', in the ground you will get buried
Mercenary, visionary, don't become my adversary
Took the dare, I'm in a trance, when I advance the seal is broken
Send you dancin' with the Devil, holdin' metal, barrel smokin'
Hand of God, I am the rod, I am the staff that keeps you humble
I'm the hunter that you run from, I'm the lion in the jungle

I got my hand upon the gun, I'm on the run, they'll never catch me
I'm the one and only one under the sun who keeps you guessing
With my finger on the trigger, heavy hitter got you stressing
Got your blessing in my weapon, look into my Smith & Wesson
Got my hand upon the gun, I'm on the run, they'll never catch me
I'm the one and only one under the sun who keeps you guessing
With my finger on the trigger, heavy hitter got you stressing
Got your blessing in my weapon, look into my Smith & Wesson",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-insane-og-lyrics

You can't fuck with the steezo
Please no interruptions
Your crew pull up guns get waxed in the sun
Like my rag top six-five
Smash you with the switches
The hitch is, you're gettin too big for your britches
Why you runnin like bitches
With your tail up, I'm the thug pirate
Put the sail up - your whole crew frail, what
You want this joint, suck it inhale nut
Niggas are feelin' this track in Braile, huh
We're grade A while you motherfuckers fail, what
You understand, immitators gotta bail up
To all the males and females gangin' up
All on my cell phone talkin' shit, hangin' up
I gotta show you how a nigga bang it up

You panicin' I'm leavin you stiffer than a mannequin
My high lyrics constantly brain damagin'
Brandishin' a fire arm, still managin'
Hurt niggas, bandagin' who give my lyrics
That play like a mandalin
I hold my mic like my dick, but you handlin'
I kill flows on tracks who abandonin'
I eat you like pussy, then take a sample
Then spit fire in the places you standin' in
I take a fool to the Hill
Light a candle then you in the dark stuck part in the scandalin'
Now I see your whole brain's scramblin'

Suck it hard swallow easy, put a soul in it

You still fuckin' but your wack, ain't throwin' it
Stepped in shit, now your chillin' all alone in it
Head full of hair, still ain't combin' it
Five child in the world who's ropin' it

Lowrider (Spanish Version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yendo por ahi es Cypress Hill en un low low
Con la rumba que te tumba pandillero loco
Somos negros callejeros jugando juego en la calle
Sesenta y cuatro va a brincando desde aqui hasta el valle
Si vas conmigo dame un grito pon tu clica en el cielo
Rompemos todo lo que vemos mamas sueltate un pedo
Negro haz lo que quieras pa' sentirte bien
Toma algo quema algo y a freakiar tambien

Cuando la gente termine de gozar ya vez
Que olvidas a todos los demas despues
Por años conoces mi familia chacho
Yo paso por calles pare darte un brazo
Pero yo quiero quemar seguro si es microfono no
Mota no le hace el tiempo es duro
Pensaste que no pude por di­as pero sabes que entrastes
A mi casa pero no tienes fe, si no los ojos bien
Porque nunca sabes cuando me encabrono y te dejo vigilando
Quemo palabras como hierba que te fumas, oidos explotan
Como pulmones pa la mota, deje que seque, se mete, se crece
Todas mis palabras en tu mente, tienes bronca yo te dejo chueco
Y tu vida mijo no vale un peso

Yendo por ahi es Cypress Hill en un low low
Con la rumba que te tumba pandillero loco
Somos negros callejeros jugando juego en la calle

Negro haz lo que quieras pa' sentirte bien
Toma algo quema algo y a freakiar tambien

Porque somos Cypress Hill ven a fumar loco
Metete adentro vamos ir y a pistear un poco
Ponte de lado, con tu gorra, pon tu asiento pa tras
No juegues güey con la mota dame esa mata

Yo soy el vato con Sofia Vergara en mi ranfla
Siempre con mi clica en la calle estilo mafia
Pleito ten cuidado que no te coja si te crees demasiado
Ten cuidado lucha roja
Aqui no homies que sufrimos todo eso
Agarrando la feria, vendiendo estos quesos
Ya me conoces soy chingon de mi calle
Cypress Avenida y el puro desmadre
Ya tu sabes, no jugamos esa mierda
Cualquier pendejo le partimos una pierna
Quiubo ese tu clica que se llama
Ponla en el aire como si fuera nada
Manos en el aire con soritjas y
Soul asesinos corriendo todo aqui
A todos los vatos chequeen esto
En cada barrio tengo respeto

Yendo por ahi es Cypress Hill en un low low
Con la rumba que te tumba pandillero loco
Somos negros callejeros jugando juego en la calle
Sesenta y cuatro va a brincando desde aqui hasta el valle

Ez Come Ez Go,Greatest Hits from the Bong,2006.0,"I'm in the city of sunshine
But don't be fooled!
They say it never rains
I can tell you: ""That ain't true.""
Cause when you hustle on the streets
So that you can feed your family
Depending on what you hustle
Niggas could just kill a man!
The game of life
I'm a full-time player!
Never settle for less I keep searching
For what's greater
Inspite of any hater portrayal
I keep it moving
Never fucked anyone over
Cause it comes back later!
At the dump it's a long fall
When you hit the bottom
People remember all the attitudes
You shot 'em!
The minute you fall
You're as good as forgotten!
Thought you had it all
But it all went rotten
But no many times I have failed
I've never let anything get in the way
Of my dreams and hot spells
I stay focussed with my mind on the price
And if you try to block me
Then we push you aside!

Yeah, that's right; yo!
Hip-Hop veteran!
Gon' tell you that we better than most of these fools out here!

Easy they come when you got the dough!
It's the Hill, baby! (it's the Hill, baby!)
It's the Hill, baby! (it's the Hill, baby!)
Easy they go when you got no mo'!
Spit it real, baby! (spit it real, baby!)
Spit it real, baby! (spit it real, baby!)
C'mon! (c'mon!)
Easy they come when they want your soul!
Shit is real crazy! (shit is real crazy!)
Shit is real crazy! (shit is real crazy!)
Easy they go when yo' shit gets old
Shit is real crazy! (shit is real crazy!)
The game is so shady lately! (the game is so shady lately!)

This business ain't nothing
But a series of comebacks (comebacks!)
Write you off as dead 'til you
Come back with a bomb track! (bomb track!)
Man you got to save food
Cause they said you washed-up (it was washed up!)
Even if your prays nothin'
All over your hot stuff! (all over your hot stuff!)
That's right I believe in myself and my talent (that's right!)
Skills have been diminshed; motherfucker
There you have it! (there you have it!)
You got to learn the game
Master every angle (master every angle!)
Like a zen master runnin'
The triangle! (runnin' the triangle!)
Just when they think
That you're all dried up (you're all dried up!)
Surprised that they asked when
The back don't cut! (when the back don't cut!)
All around the globe
Keep a silent fan base, (shut up!)
Hip-Hop icon -
Tell you what it takes! (tell you what it takes!)
Patience, persistence. -
Perseverance! (perseverance!)
Know it in your song, they gon' love it
When they hear it!
 the career been down
And  for years!
Nobody's takin' me out;
I'll decide when I'm outta here! (I'll decide when I'm outta here!)

That's right y'all!
EZ come EZ go!
 Cypress Hill, dog!
We takin' it forever, G!


I got love for every fan
Ever part of the plane
So while you can take some pictures
And sign some autographs
Share a couple of hits
Of my kush  is you should ask
But if you push!
Then I put my foot in your ass!
Not many in this game would
Last so long
So they can get what they can
Before the time is done
People are gona stay with you
But you must never mislead them
But if you treat them wrong
Lead them on they'll say: ""We don't need you!""
Then it's back to
The streets to square one
Now you're screaming:
""This ain't fair!"" Yeah
But nobody cares!
You had the money and the cars
Big house and pearls
Jewels and hot beats
So that you could spit out words!
So much time and emotion invested
From being on top;
Nigga, can't get arrested!
EZ come, EZ go;
When they forget who you are
Forget you were star
Forget you in every regard!

Yeah!
My maaan... still comin' at-chaaaaa!",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-ez-come-ez-go-lyrics
Clash of the Titans,Cypress Hill IV,1998.0,"""Make certain that no stone stands
That no creature crawls
I command you to let lose the last of the Titans""
""It's time to strike!""

Let the rain pour down from God above
With the blood of my blade, no love, begin the flood
Open the gates, let the battle begin, wherein
With wind at our backs, ready for any attacks
Sound the horns, prepare for war, begin the storm
The flaming arrows hitting your body, keeping you warm
With the uniform of my sworn enemies
You raped and pillaged my city, and spread disease
Feel the sword of the warrior's wrath, the path you take
Can lead to the math that the master's break
The clash of the titans, are you frightened of loss
Fighting with the cause to free, you and yours, and God's law
Look in the stars, aligned with sign and Mars
Destruction, what's your function, you roll with God

""Attention""
""Attention""

The soul of the master's elements, disaster
Breaking ya faster, transmitting the broadcaster
The blade swings, slashing your throat
The vision's on the mission, seeking the note
Dropping the bomb, by remote
Load up the cavalry's, no salaries, the keys
The life's memories, strife bringing the thieves
Cut the heads off, hide in the loft, don't even cough
Or breath, pay the cost, moving your life's lost
Let the spirit reunite, with your weapon, you wanna fight
Hear the sound of the warriors stepping into the night
The eye in the sky, looking to punish ya, never hide
No cover to shelter your life, the souls begin to rise
And to clash

""Attention""
""Attention""

God's enemies, fall in upon, the knees crawling
Beheading the dead souls, who runaway from their calling
Behold, the white horse, remorse, never the case
Every corner of the world, the battle is taking place
Let the war drum set the pace, you face fire
Resume, from the Temple of Boom, and seek higher thought
Maybe you live, or maybe not, the blade's hot
Many renegades ready for battle, die on the spot
With one shot, one whole city becomes rocked
The clash rages on, people remain calm
Good, bad, all in the balance, you going mad
You can never tell, heaven or hell, the blood shed
And it's all around, you can't run, sit in the cell
When the war's over, the light will shine, covering the spell
Celebrate now, put the blades to rest
No wickedness, only the blessed will hold down

""Attention""
""You creating hysteria""
""Attention""
""Attention""",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-clash-of-the-titans-lyrics
Another Body Drops,Till Death Do Us Part,2004.0,"You ready holmie?
Yup

My first mission runnin' through the head to smoke jack
With memories poppin' in my head recall that
Late night creepin' through the alley with six deuce
Strapped up everybody focused no mixed views
A sawed off pumped in my hand with two shells
The other four holmies on the scene with cocktails
One nigga lookin' for popos and foes hell
Someone lookin' through windows the door bells
Goes off followed by the punk you gas bomb
Adrenaline pumped up still I remain calm
House lit up you could see it for eight blocks
Runnin' through the hood run in front of the fade cops
The game chase but they couldn't cover the streets up
Rolled out ran into the spot to meet up
Strapped down covered up the tracks and back home
Laid low earned me a stripe perfect no

Shoot 'em up
Bang bang
Another body dropped
You can't stop the head nod
Soot 'em up
Bang bang
Another body dropped
You can't stop the hip-hop
Shoot 'em up
Bang bang
Another body dropped
You can't stop the head nod
Shoot 'em up
Bang bang
Another body dropped
You can't stop the gunshots

Yeah I'll hit your block up better lock up
Fuck the gang and shit don't stop uh
A mad dog with a bob in the reagle
Go into mode and just kill all your people
Coast to coast ain't a nigga more evil
Now made me act a lot and call Sen Diesel
Rock the block with the M one six
.44 mag like a east war fit
This here granadilla break you off right quick
Be prayin' up to Jesus and all that shit
Uh niggas be jackin' when they see my bucket
Roll down they block they hide and say fuck it
Come back in form of an assassin
Three hundred yards with the infrared action
Troop is the layer black Doc Holiday
Cuancho raider the modern day huh

I manned all missions when I was a youth so thoughtless
G ride no fingerprints it's spotless
Six bows hittin' all the Gs and we got this
Rag top down like a stripper that's topless
See me hittin' the corner you meltdown
Slugs fly thugs die moment ya fell down
Somebody's screamin' you hangin' the hell down
I'm certified nigga when you're sittin' there spellbound
No thoughts barkin' just hearin' the hellhounds
Burn you with the heaters spittin' out twelve rounds
It's life in the hood no escapin' the gunplay
Buy one day I'm out gotta figure out some way
Rats in the park all scatter when guns spray
Got you locked in now where do the slugs stray
I found ways out but the street be one way
Got a dark mind no thoughts blacker than Sunday

Can’t Keep Me Down,Cypress x Rusko EP,UnKnown,"(Intro)
Cigarette is banned from these premises
But don't be afraid to smoke the high grade
(Rusko)
Now where was written that I would be another killa spitting
That I was born to be the Buddha king and your my witness
We blow trees better believe we taking care of business
Hit the kush, brains mushed tastes so exquisite
I pay a visit within sub-conscience*
Thoughts and listen
You see a vision collect your nine times optimistic
Medicate don't hesitate form n twist it
But if ya try to send my sock boy we go ballistic
They call me Doctor the party rocker the scientific
Warlock with a tigers blood I fuckin mystic
Animalistic with beautiful minds self admitted
Fathered a style then so many bitches counterfeit it
20 years grindin it out blood, sweat and tears
I was supposed to be the lost one but had no fears
Hit the gas, taking lanes then switching gears
Whatever the path is concentrate on what you hear
I live amongst the clouds
Only the most high is above me
No One Can Keep Me Down
My roots are in the streets
An the streets will always love me
So No One Can Keep Me Down
(Cypress Hill)
It was written
The dogs gonna go the distance
Off the leash
Terrorising the streets
Your styles bitten so stop the counterfeiting
We the first ones that rapped for that marijuana leaf
Your staring at your feet
While im staring at defeat
Ride in its sides it's success or demise
I keep Cypress Avenue fresh on the mind
You know I made it out the ghetto one step at a time
I live amongst the clouds
Only the most high is above me
No One Can Keep Me Down
My roots are in the streets
An the streets will always love me
So No One Can Keep Me Down

Cross the line in the town to be
Cypress Hill keeps it incase they fail to see
Big guns and bullets
We pulled in to spray
Then smoke a big ass joint and call it a day
That's how the dog roll leavin haters jaw throwed
Violators get rolled
Kush and jack yeh that's a killa combo
Messed up side show tripping up the room doors
I live amongst the clouds
Only the most high is above me
No One Can Keep Me Down
My roots are in the streets
An the streets will always love me

For any buster who wanna flip
Fat ese ring shining in your eye
Soul of an Assassin, until I die (Por vida ese!)

Nightmares running through your head, won't cease
Look at you now, broke down and done
No competition can ever get none

I might sound funny out here
But really, niggas get money out here
And hey, everyday is sunny out here
So listen, don't play dummy out here
King try for bust make your whole pack run
Stacked enough cash so now I stack guns
Fat ones, all cold and black ones
Southland Killin', it's just how that's done

All, my niggas, do you wanna ride wit' us? (Do ya wanna ride wit us?) (Killers!)
Throw your clips up, man we's about to bust (Man we's about to bust) (Killers!)
Cy-press, Hill click, yeah we ready for war (Yeah we ready for war) (Killers!)
All y'all niggas, better just hit the floor (Killers!)

You can try to ride with the Hill, lie on the Hill
But when your shit (?) is when die on the Hill
We get, hot on the heel, rely on the steel
When your paper gets pulled and you design is steeled
Like you, signed the deal, or signed over your will
 BUSTERS GET SLAYED...!

...when you fuck around with Real
Take time to feel, what I'm tellin' you hoes (Tellin' you hoes)
You couldn't fuck around with me if I was sellin' you blows
Just goes to show the incredible skill tell
Bitch nigga, now you trapped under my wig well
Gettin trampled, DUMPED on and thumped on
Scraped on the six-five with the HAND ON THE PUMP SONG

Don't even fuck with these Southland grandes
We the vatos that run on Los Angeles
Call me Mad Dog, if you think you know me
If you're not sure then turn around and LEAVE SLOWLY!

All, my niggas, do you wanna ride wit' us? (Do ya wanna ride wit us?) (Killers!)
Throw your clips up, man we's about to bust (Man we's about to bust) (Killers!)

Get Out of My Head,Skull & Bones,2000.0,"Uh..uh...yeah....
These voices up in my head...

All these voices up in my head
Makin me dread, when I sleep at night
Visons of people with evil intensions wanna fly my sight
Visons are changin, engagin, and ragin', I'm in a stage and a fight
Listen, the system is pissin' me off, you wanna feel my pipe
Fingers pointed, annointed people, day better up to the knight
Whispers, darkness the hardest, time ain't never gonna feel alright
Feelin' my soul in the hole
I can't breathe, and I'm frightened for my life
Think I need help or I dwell in hell, cuz I got a grip too tight!

Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?

Through every dimension as tension ahead, I gotta go my main
Dreams are like beans up like coming through my brain
Then I know I'm baked
For every single minute that's in it, each and every brand new day
Denial of trial I'm vile, whatever that bullshit they say
I'm sinking so low in my self, help me gain, never give no break
Confusion is usin me sinkin me up, now the sky's all grey
I'm blazin and liftin my mind with kite, let me hit that J
Holding, controlling my self over, but the shit won't stay!

Certified Bomb,Skull & Bones,2000.0,"Call me the serial rhyme killer
Mic-cord strangling, mangling, tangling, you in the web nigga
Your head is dangling off of your shoulders
Cause my mic told me to do it cause you wasn't a true soldier
Fake bustas get hit with the clusterbomb
You're a hotdog with no mustard, you're flusterd, I'm calm
Spit heat like a fucking dragon, bagging you up
Tagging you toe, zipping you up
Clipping you up, mic-cord tripping you up
You're in the dark with no light
And wishing a nigga had lit you up
So much for wishful thinking, you're body's stinking
You're sinking into the hole and I'm at the top winking at ya

Don't play me too close I'm a certified bomb
Designed to designate all over the tape
Got my Cuban Puertoricans all up in the place
Gonna smash you in the face with tapes check it out
Don't play me too close I'm a certified bomb
Designed to designate all over the tape
Got my Cuban Puertoricans all up in the place
Gonna smash you in the face with tapes check it out

Call me imperial beatslayer
All prayers try to be advisory to rivalry in the battle player
Bitches who lie to me and cry to me use bribery
I'm taking the torch and burn Puffy-music for canivalry
That'll teach you I beat you on every plain
Ain't no other way to reach you, I reach you with pain
Shred you into pieces using the tigerclaw
I'm a cold nigga you need more than a lighter to thaw
Me and my lyrical Iceberg suckers are panic
Fuck what you head I brought down the Titanic
So can it and shut it, I wrote it and bust it
Because it never gonna be safe for wack niggas I don't trust 'em

Call me superior showstopper, your hiphop legacy
Claim us to remember we break you off proper
Oh you got a short memory? You wanna render me?
Harmless and surrender me for the fucking enemy?
I won't let ya I bet ya I reign supreme
Make your fans forget ya search ya in front of your team
Make a nigga smoke a ounce and bounce over the rhythem
And hit em and get another suck and hit em with venom
Nigga my name is Sen and I'm real while you're pretending
Suckers with no style I hope you get offended
So I can lock your ass up with my jawclutches

So many motherfuckers out there talking shit, doing their little thing
It's cool you know what I'm saying, go ahead make you money
But don't you be comming around me perplexing playing like a bitch
You know what I'm saying

You're glass homeyboy, you're glass you know what I'm saying
Don't play me too close y'all
I don't think I like you too much you know what I'm saying
Always kicking it, doing what we do
Trying to act like us, trying to sound like us

Do You Know Who I Am (Bonus Track),Skull & Bones,2000.0,"Uh, uh, yeah..
Do you know who I am? (3x)

I'm in a deep yo
Peep though
Things are on the fallout
Kids all lookin' to peel my wig back
I figure that shit out
The other day
The rearview mirror
When things are closer than they appear
Tear shit down hit the corner
Cut through the alley
Seen a fine chick
Didn't have time to rally
I remember you but I gotta dip
Skip the fuck out
These niggas are following me from behind haters
They can't fade us or eliminate us to get famous
It's all painless
I'll show 'em what insane in the brain is
Maybe they'll run, or find out what the rain is
They want beef fuck giving it to 'em shameless

Do you know who I am?
Do you know my lifestyle I don't think so....
Do you know who I am?
Do you know my lifestyle maybe you don't...
Do you know who I am?
Do you know my lifestyle I don't think so....
Do you know who I am?
Do you know my lifestyle I don't think so....

They can't deal with the ruckus
Motherfuckers get wicked in situations
That causes a nigga to react
More to the back hit the corner
Know what they say
Caught a nigga live on to fight another day
Maybe fight and not appear
Maybe they want it
Maybe you niggas following my attention
I dispatch the troops quick didn't give 'em time
Didn't give 'em a second to push me over the line
Between that the humiliation I saw my life flash
Gun blast, all out confusion
The smoke clears
Foes crawlin' outta here
Snap fingers like magic, they disappear
These bitches had it no question they're all bloody
Never fuck with nobody who's crazy!


I'm in this world hell called life
Willin' to risk it
Pop the disc and you ain't bustin' a biscuit
Fools think they heavy weight
They never wait
Like a nigga tryin' to get pussy on the first date
They featherweight, whatever hate if you want to
Kill me in my soul will come back to haunt you
You never sleep, never get rest
Feelin' the cold breath, you're the opposite of everlast
You never last!
Pass 7 days of madness
After my soul path
Your spiritual plane is weak, nigga you need to fast
Cause you're bitin' my shit
Mouths full but don't swallow
My shit's acid burning your stomach making you hollow
Best learn who you're fucking with
Before you try shit
You might die with my name caught in your eyelids

Born to Get Busy,Cypress Hill,1991.0,"Born to get busy, born to get busy baby
Born to get busy, born to get busy baby

I'm the stiff and I do get nicer
Up the pussy when we in the same party, what
We can do this bro, we can't be maxin'
The figures is useless, unless we're taxin'
This is a perfection and my tribe's the cash dump
Known as a musician, imitator act up
Nobody's kid brother, that means I'm up for this task
And I set out from the beginning, to kick on the scratch
Using modern technique, I place a beat in a rap
I went to learn, acquire knowledge of a scholar went to college, all
Comes very handy when it comes to pushin' shovin' and stuff
Then ask who is he though, I'm not the sissy
I'm stiff to neutral brother, and I'm born to get busy

Let us start to freak you and we'll make you feel alright
When you come to Cypress Hill make sure that you're down with the tribe
Cause we're born to get busy, born to get busy baby
Born to get busy, born to get busy baby
Born to get busy, born to get busy baby
Born to get busy, born to get busy baby

As I smoke my joint I feel one with the earth

The, physical effects of marijuana
The first sensations may be felt instantly after having smoked grass
Or an hour after having eaten
Usually, they creep slowly into this stoned condition
Inch by inch, sliding upward, but to beatnik
The effects may come upon you, suddenly, and startle you full force
(The, physical effects of marijuana)
(There are four basic types of marijuana)
Psychologically, sometimes the early psychological stages
Coincide with the early physical stages experienced while stoned
The famous ""mind expansion"" comes after the famous physical sensation
Grass, heightens and distorts
For example, profound revelations
You may think you have profound revelations, only to discover...

A hollow point shell's hard ta swallow
Why wallow when ya come ta roll on I put tha clip an dust

Dust,Skull & Bones,2000.0,"As we bust out on the scene like a machine with a team
Looking for theme between cracks searching for cream
Physical energy can never be lost
Never be cleverly read or took on into the search of your own
Suckers are looking for treasures and pleasures endeavors images of plastic
Material whenever you're ready and steady rolling with deadly and friendly
Territorial glorious story I've heard nothing but hate for me
Coming from ghetto 
the gueros are holding the metal
Settle for gas as we passing you by sticking the pedal
Down to the floor
 and the horror is starting to pour
Everything I just threatened your blood you can't take it no more
Why did you try to forget it I said it to FUCK OFF!!
Now you'll be headed said I'm making you try to do laws
That's what you get for fronting I'm hunting em all
Giving them suckers a push and they fall

Got what you want got what you need the hardcore
Breaking the law the new seed yes they want more
Cypress Hill Soul Assassins we smokin
420 all day we ain't joking
Serving up none less than the hard stuff
Excess of the zes make it sound right
Beat it up all you want it's a damn right
Get up in my way I'll smoke your ass like dust
???? is loaded with snakes serpents who come and they take
Pieces of those who they break bodies are found in the lake
Only the victim is passed you got what you wanted last
Pockets are loaded with cash now that you're actually grass
Time keeps ticking and slipping away
Look at you tricking I'm sicking its clicking the trigger
And so is your place
Only the strong will survive hoping to keep it alive
I'll never be denied watch in who you confide
People are out on the prowl looking for those
Who obey dying like these killas defy so I keep fucking with y'all
Join fucking with the pace your just a waste in my face
Hit you with bass in your case give you all just a taste
Even the lemo the rebel bringing the metal with treble
So many rebels incredible time we battle
You're looking for answers no chances or victory dances
Don't give me no glances you'er all through in time no advances

Got what you want got what you need the hardcore
Breaking the law the new seed yes they want more
Cypress Hill Soul Assassins we smokin
420 all day we ain't joking
Serving up none less than the hard stuff
Excess of the zes make it sound right
Beat it up all you want it's a damn right
Get up in my way I'll smoke your ass like dust
Under the heavens with weapons step in directions of flesh and feeling the heat
The tension now dissin' and stressin'
Life is a battlefield the gat'll kill really die
Think of how that'll feel Sen will gladly build up your high
And going through changes the pages keep turning and burning
The rage is concerning the stage is becoming the sermon
Searching for harmony you wanna be balling me
But you never get no where cause I'm killing your whole philosophy
Rising like temperature a signature flow when we just scavengers
And wait your posse watch I'm truly tipping ya
Must be sipping the liquid to try to get with the sickness
Only the hardest will limp in and only the thrill when we get it?
I'm an assassin of soul out of control when I roll
You better hide in your hole I got your name on my skull
There ain't no running from me assassin are cunning you see
Blasting at those who obey clashing and lashing the weak!

Got what you want got what you need the hardcore
Breaking the law the new seed yes they want more

Hurry up to the walls see how I react
But I keep comin back and that's for a fact

Fuck the bullshit let's get to the bottom
Stompin punk styles, agein rock got em

Don't give a fuck, bring the rough one time
And I think we should all get down and busy
Say the four word and you spin until your dizzy
Niggas say who is he, but I'm the ? fact
Same fool that's watching, is the one who stabs your back
So, make a plot, but yo, it's non-stop
Knowing exactly who comes on the block
Take no prisoners, put that in effect
Get the name from your set, and tat it on your neck
Let these know motherfuckers know who got next

And show your respect, when you step up to me son

No sunshine, no California dreaming
The demon is roaming on the loose, you got juice
Up for abuse, when electric currents are induced

The games you play, look up and say you want to change
And rearrange, the strange, you never go the way
Don't look back, forget that, you need that
Just sit back, look at the show, and see that
Display the raw power, black out
Even the score, open the door, and break out
Leave it alone, the unknown fury, blind rage
Move aside, get wise and make the front page
Center stage, you ?, and leave with
Go suffer the pain, leave us alone, or be fixed
The heart beat, pumping your blood, high pressure
Look at you stuck in the mud, bring in the stretcher
Strapped down, ready to roll, the god knows
Tears coming down, the bucking, so ? slow

Meltdown, taking you home, the unknown
Countdown, hitting the ground, the seeds grown
Downtown, hitting the alley, the dark night
Get's slit up, when lightning strikes
Get up!
Meltdown, taking you home, the unknown
Countdown, hitting the ground, the seeds grown
Downtown, hitting the alley, the dark night
Get's slit up, when lightning strikes

Valley of Chrome,Skull & Bones,2000.0,"You can't hide from the man with the master plan
Huntin' for your head, ""How I Could Just Kill a Man""
Ayo, where you at, baby? Keep your head low, damn
Got you on the camcorder in the black minivan
You crossed line, time for the light to blind
You can run but I never be far behind
You never know when it's gonna come, paranoid
'Cause the mentality is seek and destroy
Better look around before you come out your door
'Cause shit catches up but you don't want no more
Only time will provide the right sign for real
You might die 'cause you hesitate to find the steel

You better never let me catch you alone!
Bring it on, bring it on! Bring it on, bring it on!
You might die in the Valley of Chrome!
Keepin' on, keepin' on, keep, keep, keepin on!
You better never let me catch you alone!
Bring it on! Bring it on, bring it on!
You might die in the Valley of Chrome!
Keepin' on, keepin' on! Keepin' on!

Listen up, motherfuckers, I got shit on my mind
The spotlight's on me and it's time to shine
I smack any brat that be jumpin' outta line
I smoke any fool try to diss on my rhyme
I get y'all when no one can't protect y'all
Wash your brain and have you infiltrate the
Same bunch of suckers that be tryin' to hate me
Wanna take me out so they can try and replace me
Fuck what ya heard, have ya seen lately?
The size of my clan is improving greatly
No holdin' back, bringin' the big heater
Watch a nigga run scared, faster than a cheetah
Speed of light, move faster than sound
But I'm still on they back and I'm gaining much ground

You better never let me catch you alone!
Bring it on, bring it on! Bring it on, bring it on!
You might die in the Valley of Chrome!
Keepin' on, keepin' on, keep, keep, keepin' on!
You better never let me catch you alone!
Bring it on! Bring it on, bring it on!
You might die in the Valley of Chrome!
Keepin' on, keepin' on! Keepin' on!

No matter what you seen, we still smokin' the green
Represent for all the people still a part of the scheme
Playa haters, imitators wanna roll with the team
But they fade away, hate away, all for the cream
They wanna instigate and get me to forget my stake
Take advantage of the Real-a, rob killa who scrapes
Stupid motherfuckers who don't know who I am
Better step aside suckers watch the heater expand
Get outta hand, see the light, you and your clan
Better scram outta here before you get slammed
I stand strong, keepin' on, when I'm rollin' alone
But you sorry bitches hide away, place unknown

You better never let me catch you alone!
Bring it on, bring it on! Bring it on, bring it on!
You might die in the Valley of Chrome!
Keepin' on, keepin' on! Keepin' on, keepin on!
You better never let me catch you alone!

One Last Cigarette,Till Death Do Us Part,2004.0,"(Fuck you motherfucker!  Untie me from this chair man
You better untie me from this chair nigga
You know who the fuck I am, I will have you killed nigga!
You better untie me motherfucker, fuck y'all motherfuckers man!
Do you know who the fuck I am?)
{*beat drowns out the voice as a Cypress Hill member speaks*}
Right {*duct tape being unrolled*}
Sho' you right
You want a cigarette nigga?

You was a good kid, your parents musta loved you
They got you out of trouble no matter how big the bubble
They gave you everything, nah you never needed nothin'
We used to get high, 'member we was weeded cousin
We used to go to clubs, blaze it up and act crazy
What made you turn around, was it drugs or your lady?
We had good times, committin' hood crimes
We drew lines but you never understood mine
You don't go fuckin' homies, just like my momma told me
I held my hood up boldly, you were a fuckin' phony
I guess it manifested when I got the call early
They said you bunkered down in the hood with ol' girly
She had your back covered, but that didn't matter did it?
I know you're livin', but you put your fuckin' self in it
Don't try to make a move, nigga don't go fuckin' 'dere
I know you're hurtin' cause you're tied up to the fuckin' chair
You never loved your family, you robbed that mall gladly
They tried to love you sadly, you let 'em down badly
Just call me Death's angel, but we were never strangers
You 'bout to get mangled, that's truer than Kurt Angle
Now it's time to pay, any last words to say?
I know your mind strays, son I think you need to pray
Don't even need to tell you, you were a smart nigga
Save your teardrops, yo don't even start nigga
You shoulda thought of that long ago before you fucked me
You dodged me long enough, homey now you been lucky
But now it's pay the piper, no fuckin' traps or snipers
Just the gas and lighter, caught up in the web of spiders
But now you get devoured, burnin' in the flames you coward
This is the very hour, I send your family flowers
I'm sure they all will miss you, but they will be good without you
They'll reminisce and light a candle as they talk about you

Relax... no no it's okay
Let me give you a light {*muffled: ""Oh SHIT!""*}
{*flames roaring, a voice screaming*}
That's my favorite fucking song..
{*in the background, ""Pigs"" by Cypress Hill plays*}

This pig harassed the whole neighborhood
Well this pig worked at the station
This pig he killed my Homeboy
So the fuckin pig, went on a vacation
This pig he is the chief
Got a brother pig, Captain O'Malley
He's got a son that's a pig too
He's collectin pay-offs from a dark alley
This pig's known as a narco..

Vato wouldn't know me, along with the reinas
Catchin' all them slippin, for they such a one-timer
So when you see me at the party or the baile

Had an attitude, tried to play me macho

He's gettin back, at all the punks that harassed him

He'll say there ain't, nothin' like the motherfuckin robbery
So don't crowd me, cause yo I run shit

I'm out to get mine and ain't takin' shit from no man
In the neighborhood cause there ain't no brotherhood

Verse 1: B-Real
It's Friday mornin', where the weed at?
Let me dip into my pocket for my fat weed sack
Cos I wanna get high like a plane
In the sky with the endo cloud in my brain
Where the fuck are my zig-zags and my lighters?
So I can roll it and set it on fire
Damn, I wish I had scissors cus the shit is so sticky
That it's gettin' on my fuckin' fingers
But it's smokeable, double tokeable
I got the one-hitta quitta, Bombay shit that's tokeable
I wanna do a joint venture
Let me make sure there ain't no lump in the goddamn center
The impregnated lookin' joint, fuck it
I can smoke it and I still get faded
Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up
Inhale exhale

(I'm the freaka, the one freaks the funk

Verse 2: (Sen Dogg), B-Real
(East Coast hittin' that blunt), West Coast hittin' that honey-dip
Marijuana joint then I want another hit
Roll it up, (light it up), smoke it up
I wanna stimulate my mind (so I toke it up)
Can I get a hit? (Can I get a hooh!?)
Gimme that fat bag of weed and the brew
So I can get faded, elevated
Smoke the joint down to a roach then I ate it

(""...Police in riot gear..."")
""The police are, uh, forming a long line now...""

In the year of ninety-eight, you can't wait
Niggas been waitin on our release date
I know how to pick em up, stick em up
Everybody go crazy while I'm fuckin shit up
Who's on the floor, while the beats break
Hey ? feelin to catch a vibe, you buyin an e-ticket
To the unknown, hilltop feelin a lot drop
You gotta get the fuck out of the spot
Hear no, speak no, see no, but we know
Good reigns over evil, how it be though
I'm doing it my way, like Carlito
Taking over the whole scene, a bad dude, so
Bring yourself off up the ground, start it up
Break it up, shake it up. you better be wakin up

Riot....Starter
Riot....Starter
Come on

""Yeah...move it to the side
Cypress Hill coming through once again
Check this out, this is for ninety-eight, nine-nine
Forever baby, come again now!""

People like talkin, but can't walk a mile
Puttin you down, but they can't bite a style
I start the riot up, fire it up
Watch the roof cave in, while I'm lightin the shit up
You want some more, fanatical, rhyme animal
Slammin your head, bangin the wall, it's all mechanical
Hear no, speak no, see no, but we know
Don't even try to breathe though, an amigo
Don't move unless you feelin the whole move
Like a bomb, gonna blow, I'm killin the whole room
Still no real souls, heal those through real shows
Broken, how your grill goes, you feel those
Then I pealed those off of the wall who got bombed
Cypress Hill reignin supreme, we stand tall
People never answer their call, they fall slow
When the riot starts feelin the boom, you better roll

Riot...Starter
Riot...Starter
Riot...Starter
Riot...Starter
Come on

""Yo, get the fuck up out the stage
We gonna tear the roof up off this motherfucker
Yo, move the fuck out kid
We gonna tear this shit up
Hit that breakdown, homie!""

Look at all the pigs they can't hold me down
Riot gear on, they fiendin to get clowned
Watch as I throw my weight, they hesitate
While I'm circulatin the flow, movin through every state
Stay calm, play on, be gone, the teflon
No delay on the mission, I breathe calm
Who's gonna be the thrilla when I'm gone
Makin the scrilla, Manilla, the Don Juan
Seek low, need no, info, the weed codes
Don't even try to think though, I'm a kilo
Dope shit, my position remains firm
Fuckin your head up, take a sip, eat the worm
Let it burn, up in your stomach, you never learn from it
When the stoned of Soul comin to return

?Como esta todo?
Bien, bien, que bueno, que bueno

Bueno, a lo que estamos hablando, van a ser 50000 (cincuenta mil) bolas
25 (veinticinco) ahora y 25 despues
Y a que usted agarre noticia de que Don Miguel ha muerto
Nos veremos en el centro de Los Angeles
Aha por la Pico y la Figueroa

Lookin' back in the days of my youth no doubt
I didn’t have any role models kickin' the truth out
So who am I supposed to look up to?
 on the corner, or the boys in blue
Now I had 2 choices, what could I be?
Down with, runnin' with the pigs or the g's
Let’s see, a pig ain’t done nothin' for me
But try to guide me to the penetentiary
The g’s on the other hand wanna see me
Callin' shots in the hood, recruitin' homies
Either way I’m  unfortunately
So I think I’ll roll with the neighborhood family
G’s in the hood are influential
Pigs on the street are detrimental
A g’s got stripes on his credentials
Growin' up ain’t easy in the Central

In the soul of the one holdin' the gun
Of the Assassin, elimination, blastin', assassination
The lone hard core to the bone individual
Highly advanced than your average criminal
Through the shadows I lurk through the alleys
And rooftops, scoped and aimed at your brain
Until we meet in the next world again
Until the year 2000 come on in my friend
An O.G. told me how to make some ends
To get the Rolex and the phat  Benz
All I gotta do is take out a few friends
Disappear for a while then come back again
I used to have to hit them with the long range shot
In time I got better in the closer I got
The last thing I learned was the knife in hand
Blade to the throat, Oh, how I could kill a man
You could never understand how my mind works
The professional methods I use when I do dirt
Enemies and adversaries on the contract
No combat, I catch them in their Z’s

No one ever knows how the cards get dealt
In the hands of the maker when you break yourself
Why do I do  things I do
Nobody was ever there for me to talk to
Once I was youngster, pure and true
Now I’m runnin' with the sick  crew
You could never understand what I go through
There could never be another  fillin' my shoes
Sometimes I wonder how I made this far
In the gang set trippin'
Givin' up the set I claim
Pigs lookin' at me and they wanna take aim
But I don’t give a fuck cause it’s all the same

 Jus' hold on, just wait a minute
It's gone, along with my big bad nickel-plated
Whatta you know? The fucker took my phone
I still can't believe that he robbed my home!
Whatta you know? I think he got to the herb
And the ferria, and the jewlery, and the Mossberg
Whatta you know? I can't find my keys to the 6-5

With the 21 diamonds, shinin' on flecks
Whatta you know? When I find that mark-ass nigga
I'mma cut out his fuckin' heart!

For the dollar and the weed sack, and his Impala!

Like me, and you thought that you know me?
Whatta you feel, when you're lookin' in the closet
And the gat's gone, and so is your cellular phone?
Whatta you know? I took your loot and the jewels
With the buddah and the laptop in the nickel-plated tool!

Forty-five slug is bad for your complexion

Te mato bien matado, ya dormi un ratico...

(Checkeame tu!) Te cuelgo alto
Tenemos lo que suena, vente y te parto
Tira la bala de la loma con la bomba
(Checkeame tu!) Ten cuidado que no te rompa...

Mira mira, ten cuidado, ponte en fila
Matando raperos y quitandote la vida
Me llevo la tuya, simple, no vales nada
El ultimo imagen que ves, es mi cara
Si quieres la bomba namas llamenme a mi
Cypress Hill vive, siempre tamos aqui
Corriendo el juego con el mismo fuego
Quemando los demas, tirandolo en el hueco
Ya despues que queme, yo bajo la llama
Corre, escondete bajo la cama
No te hagas bobo, mi juego apretado
Listo, preparado, como un soldado
Te corto tan malo tu madre ni te conoce
A cuantos se lo hice? tengo mas que 12
No juegues conmigo, tengo dedo cuete
Ten mucho cuidado o esta en la muerte
Pego duro, tan duro que tu no sabes
Cuando suene la campana eres uno de mis esclaves...


Voy a patear (Uhh!) como un sonero
Dame mi dinero, lo meto de mal empleo
Y nadie ha venido a mi
Hablando del oeste, largo de aqui
So como quieras
Y no me importa a que grupo tu perteneces
No venga por aqui hablando tierra ese
Como les tumbo pandilleros, se derriten como hielo
Les gusta hablar mucho pero no tienen huevos...

Mis negros estan en juego, no te recuerdas
Haciendo los shows rapeando contra cualquiera
Fuerte con estilo que gente ni sabia
Mira que matamos a muchos ese dia
No tenian chance, los desvaratamos
Y hasta este dia todavia melozamos
Vete pa tras, negro te doy patadas
No vale na, dale con la mota
Te rompo la quijada, estoy en tu ciudad
Si tienes una esposa la dejo viuda...",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-tu-no-ajaunta-lyrics
Trouble Seeker,Rise Up,2010.0,"I'm on a rampage, rippin' up the damn stage
Wartime fate dealer, some say renegade
Part-time psycho, sippin' on lemonade
Don't want trouble but I'll give it to you anyway
Yes, I'm insane, put you in pain
My mind has been trained to live in the fastlane
Should I slow down? Fuckin' speed up
You better take a hit from my weed, you need some

Go hard, go hard, live hard, die hard
Rape one, cap one, fake one, slap one
Break one, jack one, save one, gat one
Rise up, rise up, take me higher

Got my hands on the wheel
And I'm never lookin' back in my rear view mirror
(I'm a trouble seeker)
(I'm a trouble seeker)
Can't eat or sleep, I need some
Medical attention, I'm a trouble seeker
I'm a trouble seeker
I'm a trouble seeker
I'm a trouble seeker
I'm a trouble seeker

Blowin' the chop', but I'm midnight stalker
The graveyard walker and I don't like coppers
The mic linebacker, Elvis comin' at cha
Middle of the pig, wanna pay off disaster
Hide ya from Cypress! - All around hypin'
Songs like these keep bringing up my prices
Dog in the food in the Bob Marley hold out
Balls to the wall on a date with a student

Go hard, go hard, live hard, die hard
Rape one, cap one, fake one, slap one
Break one, jack one, save one, gat one
Rise up, rise up, take me higher

Got my hands on the wheel
And I'm never lookin' back in my rear view mirror
(I'm a trouble seeker)
(I'm a trouble seeker)
I don't care about them
And if you see me comin', actions are clear
(I'm a trouble seeker)
(I'm a trouble seeker)
They say I'm crazy, lately
I'm off the chains, don't touch me, baby
(I'm a trouble seeker)
(I'm a trouble seeker)
Can't eat or sleep, I need some
Medical attention, I'm a trouble seeker
I'm a trouble seeker (trouble)
I'm a trouble seeker (trouble)
I'm a trouble seeker (trouble)
I'm a trouble seeker (trouble)


Is that so? Listen in your headphones
Carvin' up your headstone, guessin' you was dead wrong
So up the heatwave! Betta learn to behave
These days we pass weed like a relay

Sorta like a hand off, then you really handle
It; you puff up a hit, then you're lit like a candle
We lead by example! - You know that we are showin' proof
Gonna beat them whose are over you beat down overdue

Beat down owerdue. - Had to learn the hard way
Homie started flippin' and we left them in the hallway
Gonna puff all day! - Shut 'em down late night
Motherfuckers wanna play, What you got stage fright?

Go hard, go hard, live hard, die hard
Rape one, cap one, fake one, slap one
Break one, jack one, save one, gat one
Rise up, rise up, take me higher

Got my hands on the wheel
And I'm never lookin' back in my rear view mirror

The Only Way,Greatest Hits from the Bong,2005.0,"Sometimes I think about the only way that I'll ever see life beyond L.A. is dying
Sometimes I think about the only way that I'll ever see life beyond L.A. is...

Only way out is in a bag I figure
You ain't leavin' me, you lil punk ass nigga
Once you down for me, you down for life
We stay hustlin fool, keep the family tight
We run business, snow out witness

That's why I only love to control it
Love for my hood, and the niggas that I roll with

I love LA, but it's a jungle
We come from the darkest corners, where all the street kids rumble
Get their hustle on and hold dice in the bundle
Stumble on the red, some can't stay humble
Many catch cases of leather, pressure, they crumble
Will pigs catch 'em, they bound to catch a couple
Streets of hot lead sure enough, will make you tumble
No names attached, they could put you out with one blow

Sometimes I think about the only way that I'll ever see life beyond L.A. is dying
Sometimes I think about the only way that I'll ever see life beyond L.A. is...

From eastside to the valley, raw dogs all over LA, here represent Cali
Lowriders and hot women, what you tell me?
We're ballin' out here and the weed is so smelly
Don't slip or you can get drugged through the alley and violated for credit, get stuck in your belly
Cause it's all about survival
Better learn it quick, or you might get wet on arrival

I got ways of dealin' with my own
That's better off not spoken or shown
Hot-head city when I bring the anger
Heat on the street in the form of gangbangers
This side of earth don't forget, chew you up and spit you out like...
Legal bill and it stung like hell
Hunt your ass down to the graveyard 

Sometimes I think about the only way that I'll ever see life beyond L.A. is dying
Sometimes I think about the only way that I'll ever see life beyond L.A. is...

As a young buck growin' up in the Angel City
Caught a glimpse of life, together, will ya say it with me?
Was an outlaw for so many years, some in tears
Come reminiscin' about the homies who ain't here
Escape the street karma, no matter what deep harm, I could never catch sleep
You know everyday gets much harder
Will set up and get product or set up and get shot up
If you wanna survive, better have the street knowledge
Rappers, actors, gangstas, ballas
Watch stars, cop cars, we pop collars, chop dollars
Better have that shit on lock, you got a fat wallet
So you might have a braveheart like Will Wallace
With a chip on your shoulder, I'm  freeze
I'm the coldest nigga in the streets to trigga' with these, assault you, nigga
I know life's cold and bitter when you're all alone and ain't nobody running with ya'

Sometimes I think about the only way that I'll ever see life beyond L.A. is dying
Sometimes I think about the only way that I'll ever see life beyond L.A. is...",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-the-only-way-lyrics

Motherfucker with one little single
Three or four Caimans under your belt
One good game gonna put you in the Hall of Fame motherfucker, nahmean?
Got one hit think you an all star baby
Ha, you sure got somethin to learn, rookie ass nigga
It's the big hill baby, stand strong motherfucker, what

Don't trip when you hit the lunatic, transmit ah shit
Break it down for the bitches and don't slip
You wish, get a grip you talkin with loose lips
Runnin your mouth, give you a tip, eat a dick
Huffin and puffin now you the man, understand this
Dumb motherfuckers explode up in the push persist
Keep movin with no lyrics, your spirit's broke
Sounds like you got a dick caught in your throat
Huh, hit wood-a takin you under a down low
Shitting on your one single and carry O's
Hold up; let me slow down the catch up
Before you open up your mouth for the kick to the gut
Pure breed, raw killer, rhyme thriller
Spit fire like Godzilla, the mad willer
Swingin over the beat, you ready, hold steady
You come across, biting the bullet and be the boss
Hard, sit-cars, you wanna floss guitars quick
You rapping like you wrapping your lips around my dick
Nobody told me to stop until I bust in your face
Got your rhyme Puffy, sprayin the mace, the case closed
Expose the whack nigga who chose to pose high
Figure burial, up in the hills, the gravedigger, nigga

Rookies got a single, they think they all pro's (yeah, you can man)
Not one album mounting, they thinkin they got close (motherfucker, you bitch)

It Ain’t Easy,Stoned Raiders,2001.0,"I remember times I hustle, times I struggle
Times I had to get over the everyday shuffle
People trying to muffle my thoughts and all my dreams too
People who I thought were down, and see true
But I blame me too 'cos it's a Chronicle
My life, I realise I'm responsible for obstacles
In front of me, my own self to blame
But I worked hard to receive the wealth and fame
It's a worthless game, but if you're willing to play
There's sharks in the water who are, willing to pay
The price of your soul, but if you give it away
You silly motherfuckers are all committed to stay
It's a cold world, but you still want a part of it
So then you'd better fuck around and learn the art of it
Don't walk through life with your blinders on
'Cos you'll keep going crazy till your mind is gone
Chorus : B-Real (repeat 2x)
It Ain't Easy
But you got people trying, to put you down, believe me
I keep gaining ground, It Ain't Easy
How many times, must you deceive me?

I been around for many days, of musical mainstays
Cypress, is Worldwide and we like it that way
You can't fade-ER, or compare TO
The Original Pyscho-Baiter
Got the next rhyme and we'll check you all later
Can't nobody fuck with them Cypress Hill Raiders
Heard it all before and I don't need no more
Advice on the game and how to kick hardcore
Played the game out here with the best
Toured around the world and got big respect
Now, what's (?) all with this year 2000's?
We putting the Smackdown and we ain't clowning
Not many have lasted
Since we first blasted
Up on the scene, singing about the dream
Recruiting for our team, niggas know what I mean
?Damn?, you defy, when you live or die
Chorus (repeat 2x)

Times I hated, times I waited
Times I went by where I was drunk and faded
They said I wouldn't make it, but where are those people now?
Still hating, creating all the evil now
Your insecurities are showing, exposing you
You're tripping on me and showing emotions too
Don't you spend your life full of envy, it's deadly
Heed me, as I spit the venom believe me

I keep my guard up, and always let you see my rage
I get pissed, like a pitbull in a cage  (*barking*)
Not that many can deal with the fury
Attack and ransack and kill in a hurry
I kill and observe and go in an instant
I bring the pain like the Rampart precinct
I kept it right for the brother in the chullo
Something I bump when your gates in the (?)
Chorus 
It Ain't Easy
But you got people trying, to put you down, believe me
I keep gaining ground, It Ain't Easy
How many times, must you deceive me?
It Ain't Easy
But you got people trying, to put you down, believe me

Street Wars,Till Death Do Us Part,2004.0,"{*church bells gong*}

As a kid, I was known, son of a thug
Snub-nosed .38 in the glove, who can relate with us?
Never had an easy life, shit's way out
Clips spray out, fools pay out or play out
Any scenario, been there, done that
Gone where some of y'all niggas, couldn't come back
Been through the hottest parts of hell
Came back with a hard shell and, hard as nails
I went through it all, do it all, screw it all
Small you recall, the hard times as a juve-nile
Often misunderstood
Some joined the military, others just joined the hood
Street corner combat, part of the dark streets
Your heart beats pump when my slugs release
And there ain't no tellin, don't be the one yellin
These birds are deadly, they can shatter your melon

When the street wars jump off, there's only one thing to do
Grab your gat and squeeze one off
This ain't the life of the soft ones who run off
You got one shot to get you a knot

At the crossroads, sick of holdin the badlands
Where street wars, kick off quicker than Van Damme
Mistakes of mad man, I remember the old ways
The old days where fools clapped yo' {?}
No quarter, you feel me?
Life expectancy's just a little bit shorter
G's gave the order, you carried 'em out
Quick fast, you the last nigga I'm worried about
Get that street lead, that was one step over the edge
Much closer to death, every step I kept on
Learnin about the dark paths, made a hard left
Prayed to God death is swift and painless
This life ain't for everyone, stay out my shoes
You can't trade your fate, I hate to break the news
The young won't respect the fences these days
You a marked man if you get caught up in these ways

Take My Pain,Rise Up,2010.0,"I can't afford to lose you
Who do what you do?
You're the tip of the fucking speer
Who's gonna hold back the animals?

I'm at a strange point of my life, my spirit ignites
I'm destined for heights, I'm so solid with the quest of the life
I'm under pressure but the time is right
For me to look inside of myself, time passes by every night
I'm searching for answers meanwhile my faith is a prize
And my neighbors are looking at me with hate in their eyes
Grinding their teeth, the streets filled with death and lies
Was set up to die but we plant seeds to rise
So when the day comes pray some miracle will keep it protected
Some of us have gotta go but you know it you expect it
I gotta believe in more than I see
In something better than this, whatever it is
I need it quick before my feeling is gone
Maybe my feeling is wrong
But I'll embrace it like a beautiful song
I feel something strong coming along
I can't explain what it is, but I'm relaxed till my mind is gone

Day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Reaper's hold is tight
Lord take my pain away

This feeling is hitting me hard, my soul is scarred
The feeling is all like I'm getting a message from God
Believin' in cause, no one believes in the laws
The reason the straw breaks, a soul is lost
I'm searching for my soul in the mist of all this insanity
Out of vanity my home is a war zone calamity, randomly
Tragedies happen I'm sick of this life
I'd give in a minute if it could free us from strife
Gotta bond with the new brothers, leditucci and
Cheddars survival of our mothers would be proud of us
When the day comes and we rise to the height of our faith
And nothing can touch us, we don't the feel the mothers
Now the beast inside of my head, the life that I led
Left me for dead and lost on the path that I tread
I've laid so many to rest, from family to friends
We pretend it doesn't happen, but when will it end?

Day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Reaper's hold is tight
Lord take my pain away

I gotta new thought in my mind in a matter of time
I'll be in a sublime state of the spiritual kind
My family is holding me high, they're nervous inside
I can see in their eyes pride but the eyes don't lie
If the celebration continues I'll follow my heart
And my home is being infected from the poisonous dart
It's fallin' apart, I don't wanna see its demise
So I'mma have to make a difference to remember I tried
My brother and sister smiling as I leave in the night
My mother kisses me on the cheek and my father is quiet
No words need to be said as my patters begun
'Cause nothing can break the chain of a father and son
As I take a step in the street where my destiny lies
Trying to focus, my nerves got my stomach in ties
Rollin' in a club, goddamn these people are young
What needs to be done, so I'll reach you over the ho

Day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Reaper's hold is tight
Lord take my pain away
Day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Reaper's hold is tight

It's time I came to get mine
Runnin through the hoods with the hand on the nine
Why do the pigs come
Bring your ass on
Cross the line so I can get the blast on
Oh shit I'm empty but I've got a shake to the side
So don't even tempt me
Runnin the program Cypress Hill on the real with
The Pearl Jam and I'm packing the steel
Don't come my way cause it only takes one minute
To reach for the AK then why what you gonna do now
Nowhere to run when my dog's on the prowl
Growling howling, give it up punk you might wanna throw
The towel in
I'm not doing the ill thing
Cuz ain't nothing like the real thing

GIve me a taste off open a place and a black nine
By the 
waist
 line
Never know when someone will test ya
Let you know I got mine by my body chest ya

Hurt a little friend with a bullet car jacker
That I won't do anything for the looper
When I've reached the Hill I strap when I swoop
Click click bang bang
Cuz it ain't no thang when I hang with 
Stone
And I kick that funky slang

My dough so long, baby why prolong
Baby we get high, Baby we get dough
Baby we can party all night till death come

We been in the game for a long time
Yes we're battle tested
With the time and the emotion, and the money invested
And if you think hard
No one elses game is tighter
Check the network, up in ya fucking service provider
I bought you thug shit
Thought you drug shit
Got you bugged shit
Tell me what we haven't done
We run you through course son
Leave you understanding what the street life is
But you haters never understand
So eat my dick
You better
Get on your concentration
If you ready to roll on me
And good bitches if you wanna unload on me
Cause if you miss you won't get that far
Ill have you jumping fences
And running down the treet like a track star
I'm at the finish line, its essential
We so influential
Well strip you of your street credential
Game recognize, game we all about
Think you can deminish mine
Look homey I got a career


They call me dog homey
Look I don't sell woof tickets
I got my fingers on the trigger
And I'm ready to click it
I never back down
Theres nothing you cand do to me nigga
Who the fuck are you
Your face is really new to me nigga
You wanna run with the dog
Try paying your dues homes
Bum nigga yelling every time that I use chrome
So many niggas, ain't none of them blast, the right lights
In the woods be stunning their ass
I took a chance
To advance, in my life believe it
It takes a stand to be a man
Plus the gang conceited
Fools trying to be hard
They only act the role
You little sorry ass bitches, Ill smack you hoes
Try to fool people
Make em think you something your not
I'm exposing all you bitches
By provoking the crowd
Raw dogging, dying for some action, drama
Your bitch shocked out

Last Laugh,Till Death Do Us Part,2004.0,"Reflections of my own life flash like a fire
Powder burns the memories life seems a bad dream
Fall for cenetries physical and the mental
When I crashed through work
I was cursed but still I
Quit my curse found my hustle
Stack paper made it world wide
Feeling the dream, dont be a hater son
Think you the greater one
Gotta put you on the fader son
Cut your ass up see you later
Gotta drop till your praying nigga
You ain't a player hust a frail nigga
I'm the slayer in your nightmares
Unstoppable
When you see me on the street
Call a audible
I got you covered, face it
And you can't dodge this bullet baby
This ain't the matrix
Got to put you in your placement
Hide your body in the basement
Your boys wonder where your face went

Homey we keet those on us
Smoke like mufflers
To calm down/I sell
But still explode
Those things so fast/they know not to gas they self
They can't fuck with us, we laugh last

Backbreakers of the game
Many many musical
Legendary criminal destined to be professional
I rain supreme
Ever since my days you rock vest just to push your range
No doubt about it
We grew up in the cloud
Read up in your magazine just to see what were about
Peep into the case, see me, ask
Why that black ass nigga flow over the piano
Droppin it good
For that hoody in the front row
Thats my good pro down for the juggalo
Three guns busted for the battle man
Shoot the whole scene make the motherfucker rattle
Duece, double o, slow
Church folk say we ain't got too many more
Either man rush I'm gonna hit em with the head rush
So be careful on what you trusting


Yo
I was walking on the block
Heard a couple shots
Caught one in the leg
And I know who did it
They gonna get it
Wrap up my leg
Bounced upstairs and got strapped up
I love that drama shit
I'm all gassed up
I lit that kush up and got doughed up
And thought about all the foul shit I did
I can't help it, I was this way since a kid
Then I slide out the crib
Hunt down my pray
The look in my eyes like I sniffed some yay
Ran up on homes
And blast away
He passed away twin got the last laugh today
Anybody front I keep that on me
You had to die homey thats part of the game
I got guns put niggas don't know how to aim
I'm in the shooting range mastering the art",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-last-laugh-lyrics

Él tiene un hijo que es un puerco
Y el colecta sobres en el sur de Cali...
Ese puerco es un narco
Asi es, polizón, talves otra cosa
Este puerco es mariquita
Son los otros puercos, les dicen mariposa
Y ese otro puerco es buena gente
El vota solo, nada le pasa
Y este otro puerco come donas
Mientras que alguien roba tu casa...
Este puerco el se hace
Y se cuando me ve no me aguanta
Por que los puercos no les gusta cuando dice
Eres un rapero del grupo que canta
Este trabaja con la mafia
Haciendo dinero de las drogas
Pero a este puerquito lo cogieron
So cuando llegue al bote le van a partir su boca
Por que cunado llegue al bote
No le van dar pa que se pueda protectar
De un negro loco que el mismo

Bitter,Stoned Raiders,2001.0,"I lost my innocence at birth but I make no excuses
For the trivial things and the pain life induces
Bitches are wild, and so was I, young and stupid
It's incredible, what a shitty circumstance produces them
Criminals, led by the originals, high strung, motivated by the, principles
Some of us out - he used to think we were invincible
On the corner bangin' and slangin' the habitual
Deadly rituals fill my head, nothin' spiritual
Bullets filled up bodies like hands from my physical
I got touched by the hot hands of bitter fools
Divided and tempted snake bitten by the ridicule
Frustration and hate filled my adrenaline
I play doctors here's two bullets for your medicine
I carry those days like a weapon close to me
The memories of hot lead rippin' a hole through me

Son, fill your heater, how bout chase killer
Rock 'em up and show you're no quitter
Snakes' pit every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
You hate the songs that you pump up all day long
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
Snakes' pit, every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
Stand...

So many, come and go in this lifetime that you serve
Faces change, like seasons everywhere you turn
Gangsta's become blinded, visions become blurred
Learned to stay alive to the real side of the curb
You came along way but some still refuse to notice
They turned they back on us and they tried to provoke us
You ask about us, you talk trash about us
Walk fast around us, but my block fast allowed us
Don't try to crowd us nigga, we'll smack you up
Look around and see who's willin' to back you up
You're in a ghost town and home alone like Macaulay nigga
Don't say my name nigga, don't even think of me
Fire start spittin' from my grill piece, ya scorched up, touched up
I'm the C4 that blew up your porch
I spit venom quicker than the punch on your Porsche
Venom so deadly I'll make your fuckin' life divorce ya
Ask for Alamoney, bitches, you all phoney
I'll make you sing the blues like you're Paulpau Coloney
Go ask Moley, you in the middle of shit
And anything you say I'll be known the shit
The force drops hits a ball, makin' me die of laughter
Cause I know what these son-of-a-bitches are after
Your mind and soul, if your blind and cold
Then your true sign is shown, then your fuckin' mind is blown

Son, fill your heater, how bout chase killer
Rock 'em up and show you're no quitter
Snakes' pit every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
You hate the songs that you pump up all day long
Hated on, but we're still standin' strong
Snakes' pit, every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong

(Rock) Superstar - Explicit LP Version,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(b real)
So you wanna be a rap/rock superstar, and live long
A big house, fine cars, to be in charge
Comin up in the world, dont trust no body
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
B real:
I remember the days when I was a young kid growin up
Looking in the mirror, dreamin about blowin up
The rock crowd, make money, chill with the honeys
Sign autographs or whatever the people want from me
Its funny how impossible dreams manifest
And the games that be comin with it
Nevertheless
You got to go for the gusto but you dont know
About the blood, sweat and tears
And losing some of your fears
And losing some of yourself to the years past
Gone by
Hopefully it dont manifest
For the wrong guy
Egomaniac and the brainiac
Dont know how to act
48 tracks
Studio gangster, mack
Sign the deal, thinks hes gonna make a mil
But never will til he crosses over
Still filling your head with fantasies
Come with me, show the sacrifice it takes to make the cheese
You wanna be a rap/rock superstar in the biz
And take shit from people who dont know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games but the price of fame is high
And some can't pay the way
Still trapped in what you rapping about
Tell me what happened when you lost
The route you took started collapsing
No fans no fame no respect no change no women
And everybody shittin on your name
Chrous x2
Sen: (only in rock version)
You ever have big dreams of making real cream
Big shot, heavy hitter on the main
And you wanna look trendy
In the bentley, be a snob and never act friendly
You wanna have big fame, let me explain
What happends to these stars and their big brains
First they get played like all damn day
Long as you sell everything will be ok
Then you get dissed by the media and fans
Things never stay the same way they began
I heard that some never give full to the fullest
Thats while fools end up dining on the bullet
Think everythings fine in the big time
See me in my lex with chrome raised high
So you wanna roll far
And live large
It ain't all that goes with bein a rock star
X2
B real:
My own son dont know me
Im chillin in the hotel room lonely
But I thank God Im with my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home
But only no radio or video didn't show me
No love, the phony, gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by sony
Im in the middle like mony
And the press say that my own people disown me
And the best way back
Is to keep your head straight, never inflate the cranium
Theyre too worried about them honies at the paladium (a venu in la)
Who just wanna cling on, swing on, and so on
Go on, fall off, the hoes roll on
Til the next rap/rock superstar
With no shame
Give em a year, hell be right out the game
The same as the last one who came before him
Gained fame, started gettin ignored, I warned him
Assured him, this ain't easy take it from weezy
Sleezy people wanna be so cheesy, the fuckin people (gun cock noise)
Whispered: assassins, assassins

Everywhere I ride, kept the gun on me
I only used to listen to my one O.G

Brand new one from the Call O Da Wild
Give big shouts to money makin Manhattan
145th street crews, 155th street crews
All my niggas on the East Side
We gonna flip the track baby, flip the script like this
Big shouts to all the weed spots and all that who know how we do
Moon-Finger Willie slap hard, Monie' chicks
Spillin' Barcadi on club seats
Harm's from the DK-crease-NY fully featured
Harlem incriminate
You dualistic heathens of the street all malfunction seats
Crews stand like mannequins sportin damaged Timb's
Army Cam' and flat burn in self-discipline
And supportin the medicine
Few convinced they fit descriptions of movie-men
Experience and heart with cinematographers having captured raw footage of this
Mischievous black kids dipped in black hooches
Ruthless shotgun car swindler stupid used to pump Luther in ya cougar
Now let the card hold the futures

The five six I'm livin fortune of survival tactics
Keepin my enemies close and all my niggas at a distance
What is this?
Slicey characters spreadin my business
Fragments that can't manage that do damage yo I had it
Environmental pressure causing static
In fabric of the asiac cabbage it's madness

Big shouts to the LES baby we see you
Put on Stella performances
While niggas place bids at auto auctions
Re-model frames and changin rusty engines and courting
And while you Forman fools wanna shorten my life
My life is like survival organs
It's not important that you're this lyrical dissertation
Tossing lineal (????) break your vinyl
Chronically spotting spiral perhaps spinning out wax
Yo ?Nas? put the black wars on elegant floors
The teachers got operations make em insecure
Gypsy cabs I flag Donnas DC slam that ass take a detour
Affiliates with my predominately black landscape
Hop the squad I watch the sling shot from rotting up your pin spot
Jostling nigga (????) playing possum

Ain't nothing poppin while the tears who interfere
And the fears they disappear

Ah man that's the Call O' Da Wild flavor baby

But before we get up out I wanna give big shouts
To all the Buddha spots that made this possible
Big shouts to the 99 cents store baby
The discount health foods knowI'msayin?
All the brothers on the Lexus ail with that good, goodness
Big shouts to the party bag shop
To all you other food spots on your roster crew with the end shit
Yeah we out baby don't forget to flip this to the other side
Get with that Call O' Da Wild baby, it's like that yeah",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-intellectual-dons-lyrics
Once Again,Till Death Do Us Part,2004.0,"""Ladies and gentlemen.. boys and girls.. I bring to YOU""

""Once again!""
 Once again it's Cypress Hill
""Once again"" .. ""Once again!""
 Once again it's Cypress Hill
""The greatest show on Earth!""
""Once again!""
 Once again it's Cypress Hill
""Back again!""
""Once again!""
 Once again it's Cypress Hill
""I bring to YOU""

Welcome everyone, take ya places
It's great seein all these familiar faces
You want thug shit?  We got a lot of it
You wanna get high?  I'm on top of it
You want bottles?  C'mon, we poppin it
You want a revolution?  Ain't no stoppin it
Enemies try to fire back
Desire that, find you where the tire track
Cause we run ya down son, but in spite of that
Got a joint?  Fools give me my lighter back
... I'ma light up the bomb
I'ma blaze 'til we set off the fire alarm
No need for evacuation
Find a honey that's ill for ejaculation
She got friends, well the more the merrier
No limits, no worries, no more barriers

Once again it's Cypress Hill
We some ill-ass niggas straight bumpin the field
Smoke it up, from now until
Somebody calls out steel and we live for the thrill

Plug the mic in, and I'll move the crowd
Neighbors get mad cause the music's loud
I send a few girls in the hall to talk
Crusty old man never called the cops
No pistols, if you get my drift yo
You pull one and miss better slit yo' wrists bro
This ain't a gangsta party
But if you turn it into one a bullet might pierce yo' body
Relax, there's a lot of girls in here
You shitfaced niggas, don't earl in here
Don't break shit or take nothin, mind your manners
Or your head goes BOOM like it's fuckin skanless
But we ain't for all that right now, just chill out
We can pop bottles or let the blood spill out
Cuanta, suck it up, shut your trap
Before you lose that fine-ass girl on your lap


You wanna room?  Let me clear one out
But while I'm gone, just don't let the beers run out
In the morn' we can watch all the tears come out
When the pigs come, a nigga wanna hear one out
For now, we can pass the time
Blazin it up, if you slow you the last in line
Got a roach, so what?  You ain't spent a dime
You ungrateful-ass critter, back the hell of mine
You can, lose the life or lose the knife
Use the pipe, but I can't lose tonight
All the girls bein picky who they chose tonight
You better hope you chillin with the right crew tonight
See that girl over there?  Yeah she like your style
Probably seen her on the video ""Girls Gone Wild""
Hesitation is constipation
Of your game when you're in for a night of elation",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-once-again-lyrics
Shut ’Em Down,Rise Up,2010.0,"Breaking news story! Just bringing you up to date...

The Congress is proposing new taxes...
Symbols remind you of the toll the ongoing wars are taking on our country!
CEO's

We shut 'em down, we shut 'em down (shut 'em down)

Somethin' getting down from the motherfuckin' get go
Hands around your neck and I'm refusing to let go
I'm like a down south, crooked-ass police
Get me some of everything, down to your show biz
See? They got me straight going off, G
Going buck wild, swinging on a paparazzi
We not done, this shit ain't over
'Cause we're back with a nation of soldiers
And we ain't havin' it, we takin' over, kid
Coming through with the cannabis potent shit
I'm thinkin', ""Oh, no! We rock the good show""

Going down the crossroads, feeling kinda lost no
Way to make it forsaken and taken for a lost soul
I don't want your sympathy, I don't need your hand out
Never had it planned out, system cut your man out
Wars on the newscast! - Caught it on a news flash
Heard about a new tax What if I refuse that?
I don't want your promises, I don't need your bullshit
I don't need you telling me the answers at the pulpit
Setup for the meltdown, hunted by the hellhounds
Spiders got you spellbound, get up if you fell down
I don't hate your slick talk, I don't seek your point of view
I'm the fucking thorn your side that keeps annoying you

(Crooked cops) Shut 'em down
(Drug lords) Shut 'em down
(Higher tax) Shut 'em down

""Say what?""
""Say what?""

I be that, short-temper, hostile rhyme bringer
Lifestyle gone wild, similar to rock singers
Check me on the big screen, livin' out my dreams
Cypress, Assassins, SX, latin thug thing
Fools think they get bad, I ain't really with that
Flavour of the month, bro, (?) try to dispatch
Always got the good badge, take it to the head
Got me wasted like Jerry from the Grateful Dead
Don't trip, get a grip, be strong and don't fake it
Or else you get beat down, an' stripped butt-naked
I just kick the lyric, straight from the spirit
You can tell I got soul first time as you hear it

Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it's Amplified
You wanna party with the best and say ""fuck the rest""
'Cos we take away ya stress and never settle for less
Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it's Amplified
You wanna party with the best and say ""fuck the rest""
'Cos we take away ya stress and never settle for less

When you deal with the Hill, keep your mouth still
If you rely on your skill then rely on your steel
If you have no ideal, or any thoughts to feel
What you sought was real, to give 'em slots to fill
Busters stop to deal
But I face them, quicker than takin' a box of pills
Now you gots to chill
Get cops and sheilds, steady, hark the (?)
If they're lookin' for prey, ready to stalk and kill
As I lock the wheel, don't you mock the drill
'Cos I'll cock my steel, make you drop and spill
Got no mercy unless you talk to deal
Quit talk and kneel, you won't top my will, bitch!

Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it's Amplified
You wanna party with the best and say ""fuck the rest""
'Cos we take away ya stress and never settle for less
Welcome to the show, all come inside

Ain't no-body better, on that you can bet (Cypress!)
Wanna see a dope show? Put your money on my set
Real emcees and real DJs
Real South-siders from the heart of LA
Now, back in the day we had big sucess
And it's like that now and we won't settle for less
You can beat the LB from the new latin lingo
Nowadays you nothin', without a hit single
Time to get loco, and put bodies in motion
Hit the stage in a rage, and start up a commotion
No I ain't jokin, see my mic smokin'?
I slam it like the art and make sure it's broken

Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it's Amplified
You wanna party with the best and say ""fuck the rest""

With the musket
At'cha head, and I'll fire it
""It's the return of the Red Beard!""
And Polly don't want a cracka'
I'm gonna make you back up
With the wind in the sail
Destination on to the temple
Where the boom lies in the mental
Outlaws ridin' beside me
I see a ship on the horizon
Comin' up, and I'm realizin'
It's time for another uprisin'
I'm manin' this attack by suprise n'
""Avast mates, fire up the cannon""
Right on the enemy's vessel it's landin'!
Look at all these ships sinkin' low, and goin' down
With the captain, that's goin' under
Let no man put us under
When me and my ship's rollin' like thunder

On the seven seas fiya'
Pump that cannon when the flames get higha'

I'm still on the high seas
Smellin' that salt of the ocean breeze
Feelin' that heat of the sun on my face with a 'Yo Ho Ho and a bottle of rum'
When you see my flag in the distance
You better run and call for assistance
""Cuz we're comin' on the pillage
Killin' all the men, and takin' all the gold and the riches in the village""
""Pull up the anchor! Swap with the bounty!""
Headin' for the east where my enemies hound me
They wanna hang me for high treason and chivalry
And for many other reasons
Wanted dead, and a handsome reward for any motherfucker who delivers my head
""Shiver me timbers!""
I'll burn your bloody ass to a cinder
So all you motherfuckers remember

Think of the many moons I been away from home
On the seven seas or wherever I roam
Black Beard takin' you down to the galley
How does it feel with my sword in your belly
You can face the cold shank
Or get ?blind funk it? when I'm makin' you walk the plank
Standin' over the edge in the dark

When ya on ya way to the sea flo'
B: ""Sixteen men on a dead man's chest""
Sen: I killed them fools and I'll kill the rest

The broadcast worldwide don't can't you hear it

Walk around talkin' like your runnin' shit's over
Never hesitated to the fray take suckers out
Roll 'em up smoke 'em and take those fuckers out
I don't follow I got the hollow point shell
With these swell headed busters yo I ring bells
You don't know me I bring the streets where you livin' at
Killers hustlers and thieves remember that
Makes no difference to me my strategy
Seek the enemy crush 'em into a memory
Say a prayer
Then spit on his grave, crack slayer
Layer the flows the players and hoes
Awaken the pros forsakin' the foes
Rakin' the dough breakin' the shows
For stickin' my nose tu te onas

Break a leg for my weight when you fake on us

So take this here and stick it in your file

Give me your bag of weed so I can chill out
If you're blind then you gotta feel what Real's about

Throw the funk up, the Buddha blood flowin' in ya veins

Down to take a ride and roll on some gente

Isn't it odd, that we pulled their card
Thirty-one flavours of funk, woe you

With the funk to plaster
Up a punk ass nigga if I have to
Rollin' in the mind of the wicked
Slick and slide don't drive when I kick it
Whatcha wanna do, it's that way fool
I mean how you gonna do that, when you got no tools?
No skills, no funk, no feels
But still you wanna run up on the hill?
Let me give you what you deserve
Phuck the nigga with nerves in my party with no herb
Everybody want to hit the blunt, but nobody wanna share it
Tear it up - So I just keep on with my skunk
Now everybody wanna just freak tha funk

Mientras que alguien roba tu casa
Este puerco el se hace
Y se cuando me ve no me aguanta
Por que los puercos no les gusta cuando dice
Eres un rapero del grupo que canta
Este trabaja con la mafia
Haciendo dinero de las drogas
Pero a este puerquito lo cogieron
So cuando llegue al bote le van a partir su boca
Por que cunado llegue al bote
No le van dar pa que se pueda protectar

And bull shitters

Who had the jitters sine some bitter tasting minute
I spit it for those who did it
Like a soldier so committed to winning

Who you gunning with, who you thugging with
In times of struggle shit
Never be blinded by diamonds they signin for weak nigga
No sign of loyalty in anything you speak
You never know
You're breakable, celebrated but fadeable
You're biodegradeable
You just might die tonight
Get out of my sight cause
You ain't even know theres your fight


I been through the scandal and handled them better than other vandals
Hearing insane rambles saying that lifes a gamble
Praying for just a sample in amble times
To trample, example
Enemies who shit they need a pamper
You never know
Every thug nigga living his life
Giving his life meaning
Haters in the wings, they feeling their pride stinging
We here, death knocking its schocking
We keep it popping homey
We never stopping we keeping all you bitches dropping homey

When I swerve I'm bustin adjectives and verbs at curves
Hear the thunder then I melt the frozen tundra, sank Titanics
Crack solid granite, initiate global panic
Harlem got me branded, rhythms jingle like bricks

To hang all the weak rappers for leavin the bullshit they wrote
Counterfeit fools all in the pot, let em boil

Like pushin your face straight through a window pane
With twenty bars, I'm sinister God, administer pain
To your paragraph it ain't hard, see I studied the life-science
For years in this, doin songs with my indigineous
Peers n shit, hit you with the omnipotent gland

I’m Still #1,In Tha Beginning... There Was Rap,UnKnown,"Artist: Cypress Hill
Album:  In Tha Beginning... There Was Rap
Song:   I'm Still #1

Funkmaster Flex, is down with us
KRS-One, he's down with us
The Wu-Tang Clan is down with us
Busta Rhymes you know he's down with us
Naughty and Fat Joe are down with us
The MAAD Circle are down with us
Def Squad, is down with us
?DN's and Mike M? are down with us
Dr. Dre you know he's down with us
Julio G he's down with us
Sway and King Tech, are down with us
Makin funky music is a must... I'm #1! *one echoes*
People still takin rappin for a joke
A passing hope, or a phase with the rope
Sometime I choke and try to believe
When I get challenged by a million MC's
I try and tell them, we're all in this together
My album was raw, because no one would ever
Think like I think, or do what I do
I stole the show, then I leave without a clue
Whattayou think makes up Cypress Hill?
Concisive teaching, or very clear speaking
Ridiculous bass, aggravating treble
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid
Not by financial aid, but the break of hits
Causing me to take long trips
I'm the original, teacher of this type of style
Rockin off beat with a smile or smirk
Or chuckle, yet some are not up to
Cypress Hill Posse, so I love to
Step in the jam and slam, I'm not Superman
Cause anybody can
Or should be able, to rock a turntable
Grab the mic, plug it in and begin
But here's where the problem starts, no heart
Because of that, a lot of groups fell apart
Rap is still an art, and no one's from the old school
Cause rap is still a brand new cool
I say no one from the old school cause rap on the whole
Isn't even twenty years old
Fifty years down the line, you can start this
Cause we'll be the old school artists
And even in that time I'll say a rhyme
A brand new style, ruthless and wild
Runnin around, spendin money havin fun
Cause even then, I'm still #1! *one echoes*
Soul Assassin crew of course
Comes to express with styles galore
Ways of rhyming, old and new
Past and present, knock knock who is it?
A brand new style, RRRAH time to change
People talk about me when they see me on stage
Live in action, guaranteed raw
I hang with the rich and I work for the poor
And after all you can say you saw
Cypress Hill, stompin once more
I play it by ear, I love to steer
The fifty-seven Bel Air from here to there
I grab the beer, but not in the ride
Cause I'm not stupid I don't drink and drive
I'm not a beginner, amateur or local
My album is sellin, because of my vocals
You know what you need to learn?
Old school artists don't always burn
You're just another rapper whose had his turn
Now it's my turn, and I am concerned
About idiots, posing as kings
What are we here to rule, I thought we're 'sposed to sing
And if we are to sing, then let us begin to teach
Many of you are educated open your mouth and speak
A Cypress Hill soldier, is something like a total renegade
Except I don't steal I rhyme to get paid
Airplanes flyin, overseas people dyin
Politicians lyin I'm tryin
Not to escape, but hit the problem head-on
From bringin out the truth in the song
So C-H-P short for Cypress Hill Production
Made a little noise cause the crew was sayin somethin
People have the nerve to take me for a gangsta
An ignorant one, somethin closer to a prankster
Doin petty crimes goin straight to penetentiary
But in the scale of crime that's really elementary
This beat is now compellin me, to explain the silence
Why my last jam was so violent
It's simple, Cypress Hill will teach reality
No beatin around the bush, straight up, just like 'My Weed is Free'
So now you know, a poet's job is never done
But I'm never overworked, cause I'm still #1! *one echoes*
MC Eiht, he's down with us
Big Boy and Ralph M are down with us
ReFugee Camp, is down with us
Khartoum and Vigga V are down with us
Call O' Da Wild is down with us
Psycho Realm, is down with us
Lifestyle Car Club is down with us
Makin funky music is a must, I'm #1! *one echoes*",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-im-still-1-lyrics
Just Another Victim [Tazz],WWF Forceable Entry,2002.0,"So you wanna be a thug superstar and live hard

Growing up in these streets of Brooklyn
Out here in the Hook where ya world gets shooken
Thug life's a tough one, my life's a tough one
Don't make me have to reach out and touch one
I'll break ya frame up, turn the flame up
Run ya name up, cuz you're a lame duck
The Tazzmission leads you to submission
You're just another victim, here to rock the friction
I want it all and if it's lead through you
I'm gonna get mine, So you know my name
Be aware cause the mood's about to change!


Let me tell ya exactly what will happen
When I choke punks out and people start clappin
Switch into mega phase and feel the rage
Of a psycho destroyer that you can't just take
Down for the count cause I just won't let it
I'm here to break bones, Ring the bell, And let's get it
Arm for the strong just like gladiators
Rip out ya spine like the second terminator
Haters ain't got no time for the tactics
I can see through you and the child like tactics
No advances, No chances, Oppositions get a beat down


I got no friends, No allies, Hell rises quick
No love for nothing of you, Cuz you despise my trip
Keep your distance, I don't need your assistance
Cuz I'm built to last, And made for resistance
The pitbull terrier, Bone crusher
When I lock on y'all, You scream like a busta
Cuz that's the only way we know out here
When you're a thug, You're always taught to show no fear
My flow hit em dead, Him with anybody, And I'll make sure
That none of these son of a bitches get up
Gonna get mine, So you know my name, Beware
Cause the mood's about to change",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-just-another-victim-tazz-lyrics
Weed Man (Bonus Track),Stoned Raiders,2001.0,"(*Inhale, exhale repeated throughout intro*)
(Intro: B-Real)
You know, there are times when, you run out of weed
There's no one you can call
But at last there is one person you can call - Weed Man
(B-Real)
I've had drop dates with no weed to smoke
No roaches, no nothin' when I need to toke
Damn, where can I find some shit to puff on
Damn I need the kye cause it's gettin' tough on me (me)
Cause I'm a lumberjack and tree's
Get chopped up and packed up and sold to D
Bolo's are free, did you hold one fee?
Herchers for the herbics no waterin' the seeds
Some of your friends just really see me
Cause sussin' this, losin' no GHC
The pigs always wanna PH me, my gush hits harder than some GHB
But some of these swine wanna hit off mine
I just sit back, recline, and never waste time
I'm the lead man, you read man, you need man
Call me and all inhale- ""The Weed Man""
(Chorus: Sen Dog)
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), gettin' me HIGH!!
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), gettin' me HIGH!!
(B-Real)
You can always call me all day, all light
Service with a smile, make you feel all right (yeah!)
From college-heads, co-ex and dreadlocks
Lawyers, teachers, doctors buy my stock
So many call on me for what I got
So many try to compete to take my spot
Caked out, how many dimes dropped?
How many times I lost one of my plots?
The competiton was to knock me out
The D.E.A. want to lock me out
Broke in my home tryin' to sock me out
But the true blue stoners never locked me out
I'm easy to find, call me whenever
You need some green and I'll make you feel better
I'm the lead man, you read man, you need man
Call me and inhale - ""The Weed Man""
(Chorus: Sen Dog)
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), gettin' me HIGH!!
(B-Real)
I'm the most well-loved, bringin' the bud
Stickin' the club up, everybody ridin' my nuts
What? You say you want credit? You must be high
There's no free rides on my supply
Unless you're one of my friends you need no ends
Just sit back and wait for the joint to begin
But if you know someone in need of this weed leaf
You can take my number down and beep me
I'll hook you up if you look me up
Just don't give my number to a rookie huh!
Then I'll cut you off and brush you off
Never trust you and won't dicuss your loss
I'm the lead man, you read man, you need man
Call me and inhale - ""The Weed Man""

(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man

(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), gettin' me HIGH!!
(Outro: B-Real)
There it is motherfuckers, you run out of weed
Call somebody like me and I'll hook you up
No stems, no seeds and things that you don't need
That's right! I'm the Weed Man
Don't trip I got gush, for a high price ho...",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-weed-man-bonus-track-lyrics
Ready to Die,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Are you ready to die, ready to die, tell me
I see your look in your eye and its deadly
Better pray to the sky and get ready
When you decide come on tell me

You got a choice in life with a fork in the road
Got your back turned with your eyes closed with a blindfold
When you open them up there's a signpost
Enter at your own risk better find out where your home is
Some chose the streets livin a life outlawed
Doubt you'll see me spittin'my game southpole
Careful with the choices you make
You gotta live with them, can't you hear the voices you hate
How do you deal with them
Some took another path felt they own wrath add drugs to the math
Cut the life spans in half from deaths to cold sweats
To soul lets go into the abbys
We are gonna miss you yo


I put my fist up I ain't gonna hit you nigga
I got no regrets I ain't gonna diss you nigga
I just pray for you even though you're hard headed
You made your own bed and I hope you don't get wetted
I took the wrongsteps too but I learned from them
I drew heat from my niggas like the burning sun
But like all lessons I need a self check I still got my strap
But now I use my brain as a weapon
Could have stood left chose death no bread underfed
All these niggas spraying lead pushing on me laying dead
This ain't gonna happen yet bitches I'm a fucking vet
If you're coming for my head you can get a slug instead
Every nigga something something dues are they even fucking paid up
What do you say to all the haters writing in the fukin papers
Homie wake up or we take up all the ground that you can't make up",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-ready-to-die-lyrics

Armed & Dangerous,Rise Up,2010.0,"Ready? set, go! I'm ready to run
Steady we get though, under the sun
About to let go, show me respect though
It's gon' be a fat joint. - Soul - in your mental
We came from the bottom and rose to the top
Like the cream in your coffee - burning hot
Climbing the Billboard for the number one spot
King of the block - stop for a second to watch
Look and learn and loose your knot
No more bottles to pop, no birds in the drop
But - we still rollin'! (we still rollin'!) - Pocket's swollen. (pockets swollen!)
We're locked and loaded, then the scene exploded
We solid as ever on any endeavour
Cypress Hill forever, doesn't get any better!
We - came and saw. - And conquered it all
We're hungry for more like the kids in Darfur

We live hard, still armed and dangerous
We young love, be alarmed, don't play with us
Play the song, gotta bounce just to stay with us
Come along, hit the bong and blaze with us

I'm the dog and I'm undisputed and you've been recruited
I'm the general that your boy saluted
Give you a minute to see how we do it
You've never seen such finesse cause you're so polluted
I'm the king in this area hombre
Knocked 'em out the park when I'm standing on home plate. (c'mon!)
So many years of blood sweat and tears
Without me the dogs stay switching the gears
But I'm still the same man from back in the day
And I'm still gettin' luck from Africa to L.A
.Jake One hit play; burst started to sway
Every time I leave the city fools want me to stay
'Cause they stay loyal, so it's harder to go
And like the lights. - I got's to grow
That means I'll roll (I'll roll!) but I'll return later
Give props to my peop (le), and buckshots to haters (buck, buck)

We live hard, still armed and dangerous
We young love, be alarmed, don't play with us
Play the song, gotta bounce just to stay with us
Come along, hit the bong and blaze with us
We live hard, still armed and dangerous
We young love, be alarmed, don't play with us
Play the song, gotta bounce just to stay with us
Come along, hit the bong and blaze with us

Raise your hands in the air like you're supposed to
And everybody scream like you're on a rollercoaster
We're down - with the Costra Nostra
We smashing! - We sick jackin' and the Soul Assassins
The Hip-hop culture - we fuck you both
Just as you caught in the rapture. - All I hear is laughter
In a year's time some of you punks, won't matter!
Let's see - if you can hang if you can climb the ladder
You ain't a rapper, you're a fucking joke
A one-shock hack on a track, get your pass revoked
I got keys to the city and we locking you out
We come hard for the paint and I'm blocking you out
So run for the hills and hide in the can
We just put the mic down and be that fan
With your petty hands outside the lobby
I'm a pro, get my signature, this ain't no hobby

We live hard, still armed and dangerous
We young love, be alarmed, don't play with us
Play the song, gotta bounce just to stay with us
Come along, hit the bong and blaze with us
We live hard, still armed and dangerous
We young love, be alarmed, don't play with us

You're a lost soul rollin down the street
Hustlin, scramblin, money you eat
You wanna jack somebody, never look at me
Cause I'm like you when I'm holdin heat
You don't want to think about re-percussions
Cause you don't give a fuck about who you rushin
So what you gonna do when the blood is gushin?
You're playin Roulette without the Russian
The stakes are high; can you feel the pressure?
Lookin at the club on top of your dresser
Born for the big bank robbin your own
Thinkin your stone but your weak ass throne
Bitches like you ain't got no heart
Paranoid, you're settin in, fallin apart
How many times will you take to see it?
You fallin away, but you don't believe it

Jack me and you'll never go back
Jack me and I'll jack you back
Where y'all bitches got the scheme or the stack?
Jack me and I'll jump to attack
Tell me what started a scheme at ya lap
Jack me and I'll jump to attack
Jack me and I'll jack you back
Jack me and I'll jack you back

Clothes are settin off from the start
I'm crazy as fuck just like 2 Pac
Mash on Cypress Hill in a Catalac truck
Steels all gone, so I gotta play it ruff
Got hate for do out there, I ain't jokin
Can't hold me back these days, I'm out smokin
And I still see myself as Enforcer
Knock em in their face if they dedicate closer
A Cuban massive man (Spanish)
With real attack touch straight, from the ghetto
Walk for a twenty all day like a (Spanish)
Spit ball; lick all rhymes just like (Spanish)
I run over fools like Dorsey Leathers
And murder antiques like J-Rhyme I kill peasants
Take over ships like Female Kastro
Do anything that a nigga HAS TO

Look at you now what road you choosin

Always poppin shit and hide from the Hill
Comin out where you reside for the kill

Knocked out Pluto, Super Hill thriller
Verbal assault, Soul Assassin killer

Bet your ass that I'm bangin to the fullest
And don't get in my way punk ass, not a Buddhist

You on my nuts so you better hold tenderly
I can tell you what's crackin' and done get splitten
You corrosin' on the floor, shaken and snake bitten
You in a cold sweat like James of the names you knew

Of what's about to happen - interaction
Two worlds collide - one survives the reaction
Hold tight, keep yourself together
Cause we're about to storm you like shitty weather

Gun spray, gunned away, cut from the roster
You're just an imposter, you lost your composure
Respect your exposure to bring you to your closure

Clash of the Titans / Dust,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Zeus:) Make certain that no stone stands
That no creature crawls
I command you to let lose the last of the Titans
It's time to strike!
(B-Real)
Let the rain pour down from God above
With the blood of my blade, no love, begin the flood
Open the gates, let the battle begin, wherein
With wind at our backs, ready for any attacks
Sound the horns, prepare for war, begin the storm
The flaming arrows hitting your body, keeping you warm
With the uniform of my sworn enemies
You raped and pillaged my city, and spread disease
Feel the sword of the warrior's wrath, the path you take
Can lead to the math that the master's break
The clash of the titans, are you frightened of loss
Fighting with the cause to free, you and yours, and God's law
Look in the stars, aligned with sign and Mars
Destruction, what's your function, you roll with God
Attention (2x)
(B-Real)
The soul of the master's elements, disaster
Breaking ya faster, transmitting the broadcaster
The blade swings, slashing your throat
The vision's on the mission, seeking the note
Dropping the bomb, by remote
Load up the cavalry's, no salaries, the keys
The life's memories, strife bringing the thieves
Cut the heads off, hide in the loft, don't even cough
Or breath, pay the cost, moving your life's lost
Let the spirit reunite, with your weapon, you wanna fight
Hear the sound of the warriors stepping into the night
The eye in the sky, looking to punish ya, never hide
No cover to shelter your life, the souls begin to rise
And to clash
Attention (2x)
(B-Real)
God's enemies, fall in upon, the knees crawling
Beheading the dead souls, who runaway from their calling
Behold, the white horse, remorse, never the case
Every corner of the world, the battle is taking place
Let the war drum set the pace, you face fire
Resume, from the Temple of Boom, and seek higher thought
Maybe you live, or maybe not, the blade's hot
Many renegades ready for battle, die on the spot
With one shot, one whole city becomes rocked
The clash rages on, people remain calm
Good, bad, all in the balance, you going mad
You can never tell, heaven or hell, the blood shed
And it's all around, you can't run, sit in the cell
When the war's over, the light will shine, covering the spell
Celebrate now, put the blades to rest
No wickedness, only the blessed will hold down
Attention
You creating hysteria
Attention (2x)
(Dust)
When people stare at the scene like a machine of the team
Looking for theme between cracks searching for cream
Physical image can never be lost
Never be cleverly read or took on into the search of your own
Suckers are looking for treasures and pleasures endeavours images of plastic
Material whenever your ready your steady rolling with deadly and friendly
Territorial glorious story you've heard nothing but bull for me
Coming from ghetto the güero the heart in the metal
Settle for gas as we passing you fast in the pedal
Head to the floor and the horror is starting to pour
Everything I just threatened your blood you can't take it no more
Why did you try to forget it I said it to FUCK OFF!!
Now you'll be headed said I'm making you try to do laws
That's what you get for faking it hot and no more
Living I'm sucker I'm pushing the bomb

Do what you want do what you need the hardcore
Breaking the law the new seed yes they want more

We ain't joking serve it up oh yes and the hard stuff
Excess of the zes make it sound right beat it up all you want
It's a damn right get up in my way I'll cross your ass like dust
???? is loaded with snakes serpents who come and they take
Pieces of those who they break bodies are found in the lake
Only the victims its pass you thought that you gonna last
Pockets all over the cash now that you're actually grass
High kids taking and sliping away
Look at you tricking and sipping its clicking the trigger
And so is your place
Only the strong will survive hoping to keep 'em alive
I'll never be denied watch on who you can find
People around and they're proud looking for those
Who obye dying like these killas defy so I keep up the withdrawl
Join fucking with the pace your just a waste in my face
Hit you in base in your case if all you want is a taste
Even the lemo the rebel bringing the metal in temple
So many rebels incredible time we battle
Looking for action don't judge us avenge us redempt us
Don't give me negligence your all though in time no revenges
(Chorus:)
Do what you want do what you need the hardcore
Breaking the law the new seed yes they want more
Cypress Hill Soul Assasins we smokin 420 all day
We ain't joking serve it up oh yes and the hard stuff
Excess of the zes make it sound right beat it up all you want
It's a damn right get up in my way I'll cross your ass like dust
Under the heavens we representing directions of flesh and feeling the heat
The tension now dissin' we stressin'
Life is a battle to the cattle you gonna die
Just how that'll just suffer your glad you built up your high
And go up the chain the pages keep turning and burning
The rage is concerning the day is becomming disarming
Searching for harmony you wanna be balling me
But you never get no where cause I'm killing your whole philosophy
Robbing like temperature I signal your flow when we just clowning
Just tell me just pass me watch me I'm truly tampering y'all
Must be simple delinquent to try to get what the sick is
So leave the hard is to limp it and only the thrill will we get it?
I'm an assasin of soul out of control when I roll
You better hide in your hole I got your name on my skull
There ain't no running from me assasin of hunees you see
Blastin at those who obye blasting at last at the weak!
(Chorus:)
Do what you want do what you need the hardcore
Breaking the law the new seed yes they want more
Cypress Hill Soul Assasins we smokin 420 all day
We ain't joking serve it up oh yes and the hard stuff
Excess of the zes make it sound right beat it up all you want it's a damn
Right get up in my way I'll cross your ass like dust",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-clash-of-the-titans-dust-lyrics

And NO! - I'm not gonna slow down!
They try tell me what it is what I can or can't be
I gotta family that I gotta hold down!

So I'm gonna rise like - smoke!
So I'm gonna rise like - smoke!
So I'm gonna rise like - smoke!
'Till the day they put me underground!

I gotta break these chains. - Take these reins!
Ignore these pains; no pain, no gain!
I gotta hard move like like a muscle car
Get ahead of the pack. - Hit like a double-R!
I never loose sight, only to too tight!
Only to get away - too many will lose right
Kill right now you got your head in the clouds
Screaming your name! - Nothing can bring you down!
Everybody got a dream; hurry up and go get it!
'Till it gone;  and gone!
You singing the same song. - You ain't in tune!
Tellin' yourself - ""I'm gonna get mine, soon!
It's a race to the limelight - and the pack is running
Can you keep up and tell us that you want it!
When you get it tell us what you're gonna do with it (do with it!)
'Cause I got mine, I'm a show you how to move with it!



Still lookin' for the gusto, desirin' to hustle!
Deep on the street with Soul Assassin muscle!
Still motivated! (MOTIVATED!) - Still upgraded! (STILL UPGRADED!)
Still updated and always on fated! (AND ALWAYS ON FATED!)
Thought we come again? - Watch we roll up
With the real channel 13 stone us!
Never rest! - Gotta keep moving!
Anything less put my shoe in it!
What you want holmes? - Yeah, we got some!
Best believe it's the motherfuckin' box, son!
I'm still hungry but that's the sex!
Ain't done yet like broadway brick!
Ain't no question, that's why I'm a threat! (I'm A THREAT!)
I'm getto raised right out the projects! (PROJECTS!)
Now you know that I'll be done when I wanna go (WANNA GO!)
And for real until that Death thing come and go! (COME AND GO!)




When the lights go on and the mic turns on!
Find someone it's so live, it's wrong!
You wanted more then your typical common hit
Feels good when the fans bounces kinky shit!
Right after the show, after the flow
On the grounds in the back then get out the door!
Look the shorty is! - She wanna ride with the band!
She screamin': ""Guys I'm your biggest fan! ""
Runnin' through. - Whatever she can
And she's - lookin' at you like a bride in day
She's - sweatin' hard, she won't resist
When you ask: ""Why? "" She plays just like this:

I'm a go hardcore what I believe in
And NO! - I'm not gonna slow down!
They try tell me what it is what I can or can't be
I gotta family that I gotta hold down!

Juega con las reglas o si no te rompo
Bien apretado estas en mi luz

Nada que hacer nomas esconderte
Entraste, tu pacas siendo tu viente
Cuando conviene esto me da sabor
Si estas en mi camino te enseño mi calor (ahh!)
La pongo en la mesa laten las tijeras

No puedes perder, nomas escoje

Has lo que tiene que ser y no te rompas
Cuida la salud y comparte con las compas (compa)
Ten cuidado, con la pista
Si estas en la loma usa tu vista (vista)
Que se cuenta? que soy cuento...

Te doy mi todo, no pierdo nada
Pasa que ayer, el tiempo se acaba...

Te doy mi todo, sabes como soy
Me meto a tu cabeza, te destruyo hoy
Agarro mi pluma la meto en tu cerebro
No voy a parar hasta que quedes muerto

Step back punk 'cause I'm a Latino
What I bring you is the hardcore lingo
Funky, but ya don't understand
Now I gotta stand with the Glock in my hand
No scope
And there's no hope
'Cause I'm dishin'
Out my. 45 slug and it ain't missin'
Here it comes hissin'
Here it comes hummin' at ya
Now the slug is comin' at ya
One little two little three hoodlums
Gotta hit the ground 'cause here the slug comes

Make 'em run boy, make 'em run boy, make 'em run

Movin' em back, click-click goes the gun
Make 'em run boy, make 'em run boy, make 'em run

Swift of the engines
Coming like the three little indians
Stompin' around on the ground on the plains

In the brain
So I gotta maintain
My direction
What I mighta gained
Without my protection
Not a damn thing
So when I come just bring
That new style, break ya off like a chicken wing
Buckooock!!
So you can just suck my c***
Like a fat blunt, stoned is the way of the walk

Checkin' out the punk-ass creepin'

Back from the dead of resurrection
We came to change the whole complexion
Take this game a new direction
Last stop when the gas popped
When the kush blows free and the low-lows drop
This photo-op, no flash, we smash, get cash
Cash out the fuckin' spot
It’s a new day to bill, expect the hill
We grab the bill, the trip is real
Don't make me pull out the steal link
Cause all the commotion and emotions kill
Heat-seekers, if the come seekers
Serve your asses through your weak speakers

If he acts tough, shut him up, put him down

Adrenalin maxed in bringing the rapture
We cap it and coming at ya
Studio gangsters applying the actra
Still print that real shit
I'm the dog in the cup and real hard to deal with
How long have we held you down
And broke down doors with the grimey sound
No surrender, we push and enter
Take over the scene and blaze the green
Put a chill through ya body when you saw my teeth
Find yourself in the middle where the pink convenes
Don't slip on the misfits

So hard to charge, no complication
Take another hit for respiration
Legalize don’t criticize
'Cause one day you might understand who to symbolize
Any man, any woman gotta like that
First trying put a cape, gotta fight back
Let strip shows, like flip mode

Dead Man’s Gun,Rise Up,2010,"""Am I a good maaaaaaan?
Am I good maaaaaaaan?
Am I a foooool?
Am I fooooooool? ""

It was a cold dark night in December
Running from the po-po's the alleyway I enter
Trying to hideaway - when I stumbled on a gun
And nobody's knows nothing about - where it came from!
And nothing hotter then the summers in June
Who knows how many souls - they put in the tomb
When I picked it up man, I felt alot of pain
Like a shot  thru the brain - for reasons I can't explain!
After it went away - I felt a sudden change
Like - I can do anything. - And don't get in my way!
I'm scared for my family! - They couldn't understand
With gun in my hand - I became - another man
No more running and hiding away from the cops
No more getting robbed from the dudes on the block
You're looking at a new man in the light of the sun
You're staring down the barrel of a dead man's gun! (dead man's gun...)

Cause you never know what's around them corners
Enemies try to run up on us!
So I keep that gun right by my siide
If you want it you gotta take my liiiife
And if you got problems, I got answers!
""One shot from the Revolver  - can solve it! ""
Anyway you want it, it don't mat-ter!
""If you got hard. - I'm a go harder! "" - You gotta take my liiiife!

You walk into a dream and shit feels like a game
Everyone is different - but they all end up the same
Even the places - and the faces all change
At the end of the dream - I could see - the bullets rain!
I thought it was me who brought these people to the death
'Til I noticed a funny thing, I was standing on the left!
Looking at other people with their hands on the gun
And pulling the trigger - until their enemies were done!
And with each hand that held the gun it got deeper
They ended a question against the shoulder of the Reaper! (yeeeahhh!)
They all look invincible with the weapon that was cursed
Until it was their turn - to ride in the hearse!
Seems like the history - is passing down to me (GO!)
Cause my finger was itching (GO!) to go after my enemies. (GO!)
I welcome them all (GO!) with the best on my chest (GO!)
Because I put 'em (GO!) to the test and laid those bodies to rest. (bodies the rest...)


Spring for more pimpin' - it's time passes by
And people are telling me about the look in my eye
Sayin' it seems there's a chip on my shoulder
And for some reason my attitude has gotten bolder!
I knew it was true - cause I felt myself changin'
But I don't care what they think cause I'm still the same man
I don't show weakness - anymore without a question
Don't wanna be stressin' and have to teach them rappers a lesson!
Never a time - I felt so alive (GO!)
An' situations (GO!) I thrive - like bees to a hive. (GO!)
I murder these (GO!) new kids - who got something against me. (GO!)
The thought of you (GO!) talkin' shit - really fuckin' offends me! (GO!)
In no time at all we come back to each other
Seems like I've seen it before. - I swear it on my mother!
A shot  rang out - and then my hands went numb
Seen my body on the floor - with the dead man's gun! (dead man's gun...)


You gotta take my liiiife... (liiiife...)
You gotta take my liiiife... (liiiife...)
You gotta take my liiiife... (liiiife...)
You gotta take my liiiife... (liiiife...)  ",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-dead-mans-gun-lyrics

Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
In the hills where the trees grow wild with weed fields
The fucking pigs with shields holding the blue steels
Greenhouse effect with the weed connect
(Doctor) DEA can't keep Greenthumb in check (Doctor!)
HPS, God Bless the whole crop
Please God, don't let me see no cops
Trunkload, ready to hit the highway
Don't let the eye in the sky fly my way
Or we gonna have big trouble, that's no shit
Can't be growin without no permit
But fuck that, I study the 215 trip
That way when they come they can suck my dick
Weed can't grow without attention
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb

People can't live without the herb man
If not they'd be drinkin and drivin and swervin
But thanks to Dr. Greenthumb weed grow
In the backyard or inside with hydro
To the cush plant brushin a tangerine dream
Tasty, blowin a fuckin smokescreen
Cycles of weed are constantly grown
Somebody give me the razor to cut groves
I'd like to stop, but it feels so good
Horny plants stinkin up my whole neighborhood
DEA never wanna leave green alone
But never ever ever got a warrant for my home
What that funny sound knockin at the door (Open up it's the DEA!)
Sorry Greenthumb can't talk no more
Please don't follow me into the sun
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
1/2
(B-Real)
Out from the lab, no need for rehab
If I can't drive then call me a cab (taxi!)
In my closet the weed is dried out
Like Eiht said, ain't no place to hide out
I don't wanna buy no weed from no cop
Get locked up and they close up my shop
That's why I buy no weed from no one
That's why they call me Dr. Greenthumb
The scientifical, mystical one
Growin my crops with the rays of the sun
Come one come all and see how it's done
If you see the pigs there's no need to run
Cause some of these pigs are down with Greenthumb
But you never know what be the outcome
You see the photo in the album
The weed is growin like my erection
Look I never told you where I was from
Some call me Real, but I'm Dr. Greenthumb
Dr. Greenthumb
Doctor, your Bulova plant needs special tending to
Doctor, we need more oxygen we need more CO2

Don't mistake my kindness as a weakness

They try to put their hands in ya pockets with out chu' lookin'
But when I find you out ya whole world's shookin'
And they're relentless, the quest for the ends is endless
You lose yo senses and you get beatin' senseless
But there's others you can't do nothin' about
Cause they're on a higher level and they hold too much clout
But in time, in the end they'll pay
When they're standin' before the man on Judgement Day
Standin' there but what excuse can you give
You reduced to shit because you refuse to give

It's been a while now
Been around the block many miles
Many faces, many places
That I found friends
Places where I spend time, places where my mind roam
Places I can call home
Places I can get stoned
I just wanna be alone
When I'm feelin' in my zone
People want to knock me down
'cos they never have their own
They won't get the best of me
But they try hopelessly
Why you wanna fuck wit' me?
I'm not, what you s'posed to be?
You could not give a DAMN
Coulda just Killed A Man
Sawn off in my hand
But I had to kill the plan
Think I've found my piece of mind
Feet planted on the ground
I just had to redefine, what I thought to myself
It all goes around me and others who would down me
Who I don't give a fuck about, Trouble always found me
I know used to welcome it with my arms open wide
Trouble's hand's on the door, but it can't come INSIDE!
NO TROUBLE'S AT MY DOOR!
You want trouble, c'mon
You want trouble?
You want trouble, c'mon

You got to be a real nigga in a Cypress Hill pit
Lotta critics talkin' shit, but I'm not concerned
A hundred G's for sixty minutes is the bank I earn
I try to put it to you BLUNTLY so you bitches can learn
That no-body get tired when it's time to burn
With so many phonies out there a lot of you have been fooled
In to actually believin' that some shit is cool
Take the blinders off and go look for yourself
Fuck hearin' about shit from somebody else

Interlude,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I wake up every morning, kiss my wife goodbye
Hug my kids, tell em I love em, my mouth, hit the fried
I'm out on patrol, in my squad car, do I lay
Where you never know, if you'll be makin it home today
So many different attitudes, that I come across
I'm hard to console tonight, feeling nobody's lost
Hookers hustlers killers and thieves, out on the streets
Got my mind warped, just found another corpse on the beat
Bound gagged raped, I'm frustrated, I hate it
Found a woman in the dumpster, body was mutilated
Bad dreams all up in my head, no lie
Sometimes I gotta take a sniff so I can get by, why
Don't I get hurt, cause there go my nerves, I got the urge
To merge this bullet in my brain, relieve my pain
What a fuckin shame, I don't wanna live, I paint the wall
With the bloodstains, eye of the pig, I see it all
The eye of the pig
Dj Muggs cuts and scratches'This pig' from Pigs
I've been on the force, over twenty years, I can say
That I'm worse, than some of these motherfuckers I put away
I'm in the biggest gang you ever saw, above the law
Lookin through the eye of the pig, I see it all
Drug abusers, drug dealers and the gang-bangin
Pieces of shit who should be on the fuckin news hangin
These days you can't tell who's-who in the world
Is that a whore, or is that, an innocent young girl?
Fuck, I need a drink, and I'm almost off
At the precinct, it's like an aa meeting all gone wrong
I. A. Got an eye, on my close friend guy
For takin a supply from evidence from a bust on a buy
That doesn't concern me, we never rat on each other
We went through the academy, just like frat brothers
Midnight, I only have an hour left on my shift
Think I'll get my dick sucked by this basshead bitch
My marriage is all fucked, my wife is with the neighbors
Subpeonaed, now I gotta sign these fuckin divorce papers
I recall, happier times, before the fall
Look into the eye of the pig, I see it all
Now I'm on my way, back to the station to check out
So I can go home, relax, take a drink and think about
My abrupt change, out of the clean, to the corrupt
Look into the eye of the pig, I'm all fucked
No longer can I determine, who's the criminal
From the innocent man down, to the pedophile
No one gives a fuck about me, I'm slippin
Into darkness, I'm comin to grips and feelin heartless
Watch this, a dark green truck, tinted windows
Duly modified, probably a dope dealer inside
""Pull it over to the curb, take your keys out ""
And raise your hands out the window and get em in high position
Don't move, or I'm gonna blast your fuckin head off
Just tell me where the guns and dope are and you'll get off
Don't give me that bullshit, I've heard about your raps
All you talkin about is slangin and shootin off the scraps
Ok, Mr. Freeload, get the fuck out of the truck
I love it how all you fuckin rappers think it's so funny
Hit the fuckin floor, I need no probable cause
You got a big sack of coke in your truck (what?) so take a pause
You find it funny? Get that smile off your face

A duck with the public's favorite rhyme order
I ain't no waiter or hater of a spectator (kill em B-Real)
Seekin to find the toys, with no flavor
See I'm talkin about those whose vocals ain't comin off
A skill to kill at will, but awfully dumb of course
Some go nut, the power of the last one
Slower, flower, blower
Those who ain't pros I wet my stupid radio
Cause he needs a G when you listen to the vocal
I'm not a loco but I'm lookin just til punk go OHH

All these motherfuckers that wanna run up on the Hill
Step off! You know why?
This shit is all about BOO-YAA cause I said step off!
This is the crime you find you're not an exponent
Doggone it, another gonna mierda on it
Now you're wishin, fishin you could do this
But on the strength, yo, I think you knew this
Was just like a dream, when you supreme, the king
Of a minor ?
All for 47, swung ? eleven
Got hit with a pitch like a bitch and went to heaven
Weak ducks, duckin and buckin
Sayin FUKKIT, ain't worth damn pay the ducats
From my public, my favorite subject, I loves it

Ain't paid a plot, for un-em-b-boyment

Damage or duel though aiyyo, cause our crew now
The Real is the ?, sport and you can see this
G-ness dialogue, of the real skiers
I ain't nuttin like a joke, get stoned, get smoked

Yo I told you to keep down brother
The motherfuckers just don't learn nothin G

Ha yeah that's right fool
Yes the master pass, kick your ass
And feel combustion, for the dope blast
Cause you're steppin on my property, get off it G
Get caught up, then you get shot up
See, violators will be prosecuted

Not so, no there's no sellout
You ain't got enough ducats to shell out

Que no valgo madre y no voy hacer
Nada porque me critican
Ahora tengo feria y ellos me envidian
Chingan y piden siempre me siguen
Y al mismo tiempo me dicen:
No entendemos tu onda
Con tu cuete, tu dinero y adicto a mota
Yo nunca quise golpear a vatos
Pero si me cruzas a mi yo te mato
6 pies bajo de la tierra
Yo no miento es verdad
Ese, quedaras como antes
Solo me acuerdo cuando me asaltaste
Clik clak, cuete esta cabron
Me queria bajar la feria este ladron

Wa da da dang, wa dada daa dang...

Dicen que voy a caer y voy a quedar
Torcido en el bote donde no salgo
Quedo bien locote
Un toque, fumo pa calmarme
Me dejaron mi tiempo no pudieron darme
Fue un error porque soltaron a un criminal ese
Yo busco alguien parecido
Algo como yo, que viva como vivo
Caminando solo, a mi no me conoce nadie
Pienso que deveras no valgo madre

Y recuerdo que aqui han muerto mis carnales
Quiero que paren esto

Why wallow when you come to roll on? I put the clip
And before I bring ya ass on, what chu gonna do
Kickin' dust on your head like I bust

It's the first line of defence, imminence combat

I see the birds of destruction fly by
Convey the Code Red and begin arming all nuclear warheads

Embrace all the data within the home base
The virus is spreading at a maximum pace
Eliminating all traces of the human race
(Commander, the enemy has begun to infiltrate!)
Send the word and spread it (Let's get the fuck outta here!)
Through all the southern states
Activate self-destruct, elimination is imminent
Stabilize your positions
The spirit of God is infinite
Women and children take shelter
The enemy is upon us

What’s Your Number? (Explicit album version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Let's go!
I met her at the club, her friend liked me but she didn't
She noticed a lot of girls giving up their phone digits
She didn't want to be one of those ho's whose clothes
Exploiting their body's from head to toes. She had glossy lips
She was swaying her hips on the dance floor and every nigga's
Flashing the grips trying to impress her in vain
She gave no play, Niggas hit her up for numbers and she said no way
I thought to myself let it go the girl on beat
But like Smoky said she really had a hold on me
I couldn't stop staring I started to fantasize with her
Voices in my head said she's tantalizing ya. Even if I
Moved to the other side of the party I had pictures in my
Head of her moving that body. I was beside myself with conquer
Pain so I slowly walked over and I asked her name
Chorus 2x:
What's your name? What's your number?
I would like to get to know you
Can we have a conversation?
The night is young, Girl
Give me a chance
She gave a smile but I got no answer though it took a while
Before she could gave a chance she sat too cool. I offered her
A drink she turned me down flat she said If you want my name
You gotta do better than that. I said, Okay, now your shit
Don't stink, I'ma walk away, only tried to buy you a drink
As I began to walk away she said I'm sorry for reals, but every
Guy in the club tries slipping me pills, I don't trust that each
And everyone would lie to you I said I understand but that's
Not what I tried to do, I wasn't even gonna go to your table but
If I didn't, I knew that I'd regret it later. I go after what I
Want but I got class. For me no need to slip a pill if I want
She gave me a funny look, I couldn't tell what it meant. She let
Her guard down and on the conversation went
Chorus 2x:
What's your name? What's your number?
I would like to get to know you
Can we have a conversation?
The night is young, Girl
Give me a chance
Lets go!
She said: I want a man with the plan and ambition, not an immature nigga
On a pussy-hit mission. I'm too good for that, I've got so much to offer
Got a good job, working at my mom and dad's law firm. You got
Goals? that's what she asked, Yeah, I want to fill my home with
Platinum plaques. It takes hard work but you know it's coming
After. She said Oh My God! You must be a famous rapper. I do
Alright, but I'm never satisfied. I'm told 'when you still love
What you do it never gets old'. I strive for more but that's enough
About me. Why don't we skip out the club, take a walk on the street?
We slipped outta the club with no worries, seemed she wanted to get
Out in a hurry. We hung all night, and we lost our friends...'til
They caught us banging in the back of a Benz

Uptight, when you steppin' into the night, right
Pigs comin' up and shinin' the bright light
Nothin' better to do, than fuck with the pride
When you hide behind your badge, your gun and ride
Billy club show me no love, think you above
All the fuss and the locs is rushin' in too close
Let me lay it on the table, forget stable
Freak niggas, comin' to slay to the label
You got nothin' to lose, come on choose
Stay away from niggas that bring down your crew
Whatever it takes, you make or break yourself
With the wealth or the chance to stay in good health
Sword blade swingin' you back off away
And the track off the real, straight off the hill
What the deal, motherfucker?

Takin' this pencil, across the brain
Ain't stoppin' there till the rhymes all drained
All out my system, take 'em and then I twist 'em
Put 'em out one day and see, who wanna diss 'em
As you fold I'll sting ya, run up and you bitch up
Y'all get the picture, just call Mr. Excitement
Comin' with the thunder and lightning
Shit is quite frightening how niggas keep biting
So I keep the writing, down for the fighting
Cold with the flows, they both quite exciting
And let me take space up, heat your face up

Lightin' the fuse to the bomb, better run
Come on, come on
I'm goin' all out, nothin' to lose, you better roll out
Sold out, niggas be livin' in times run out
In the present smell the presence of what you stressin'
You get sent a lesson ain't missin' the point blessin'
Expression, feelin' the tension over the session
The question, fillin' your body with intention
Don't mention the profession, keep adressin'
The real motherfuckers in the crowd pay attention
I'm goin' the fuck out, Smith and Wesson
You better stall me out, no extension
Only the strong will ever be settin' the pace
When you look up I'm gone and never left a trace
No worries, set you with flurries and no juries

Don't get the twist, you listen or get the fist

No Pierdo Nada,UnKnown,UnKnown,"No pierdes nada, te doy mi todo

Si vienen los puercos te pongo en una cruz
Nada que hacer nomas esconderte
Entraste, tu pacas siendo tu viente
Cuando conviene esto me da sabor
Si estas en mi camino te enseсo mi calor (ahh!)
La pongo en la mesa laten las tijeras
Raperos son esclavos de compaсia disquera
No puedes perder, nomas escoje
Un grupo de matones que no son ladrones

Ten cuidado, con la pista

Te doy mi todo, sabes como soy
Me meto a tu cabeza, te destruyo hoy
Agarro mi pluma la meto en tu cerebro
No voy a parar hasta que quedes muerto
Estoy en mi zona corro y te destuerco
Pongo en un palo a cocinar, dia de puercos
Yo soy el loco, agarro una foto
Entiende la foto me importa poco
Me llamo sr. Trueno tremendo

Tengo mi puesto, yo lo manifiesto
Te doy mi todo y siempre te afecto...

Esto es una guerra aqui no hay paz
Represento, soy ejemplo

Ay quien puede con mellow y cypress hill?
Cuando saca esto va haber tremendo lio
3 caсones, somos 3 leones
Quien quiere un pedacito, le parto los riсones
Pzz pzz pzz! Piсiazo en la frente

Smuggler...
I got the sawed off Shotgun, hand on the Pump
With the fucking red bastard, snitching like a punk!
I had the operation tight the flaws, faded doors
There's no - growin' room - on the basement floor! (yeeah!)
I'm holding weight every 30 days, business pays
So many ways many methods of moving my white haze!
I got the cellophane, hiii! - Get this money tonite!
I got the shipment goin' out. - Got to be air tight!
So when you fuck around (around!) - no time for me to fuck around (take that shit off!)
I got the ballin' niggas waitin' on me at the compound! (compound!)
So get the trucks ready! - And let's hit the back roads
To scam this motherfuckin' ass border patrol!
I got my cousin Huey paid - for lookin' away
Back on the 405 on the way to L.A.! (way to L.A.!)
I'm multiplyin' in my head - just how much stash
It's gonna take for me to double and triple up all my cash!
I hit the city limits, time for me - to check myself!
Cause I don't wanna sit inside no fuckin' cell! (no fuckin' cell!)
Slope the rolls - down, hold - down; I see the gate
So I'm pullin' up! - And I hope these fools ain't late
Or I'm outta here; wait, no! I see them in the rear
With 3 or 4 fools holding 2's in the real!
I got the double barrel shit - hidden under my coat
For any crazy eyed motherfucker rockin' the boat!
I got the big boss hoss, just sippin' the sauce
You got the shit? You got the money? Then break the shit off!
Check out the herb, man smuggliiiin'! (smuggler...)
Bright and early in the mornin'! (smuggler...)
This is for the herb, man smuggliiiin'! (smuggler...)

Take out the herb, man smuggliiiin'! (smuggler...)
It's my ass that I'm risking! (smuggler...)
This is for the herb, man sumggliiiin' (smuggler...)
I know it's your daily liven'! (smuggler...)
I came a long, long way - from slangin' the herb
Sometimes I think about - when I was kickin it to the curb!
Now it's dirt in my pocket but - shit done changed!
Tatoos on my body and - fat gold chains!
I got the mega-shipment - that must go out
On the same route me and my cousins started out!
Head back to Mexico for a friend of mine
We're gonna bring this shit load back; 4-0 pounds!
It's like crack rock! - Cause we done this shit before
Now I loaded up the stash on the hollow floor
Double checkin' everything; now it all looks cool!
Now we rollin' to the border like we used to do
We pulled up at the border, but something was wrong
I began to realize that the swoop was on!
I had the DEA and immigration closin' in They had dogs all around my shit! - No way to win! They lookin in the truck, now I know the shit's for blast
DEA agent sayin': ""Now I got your ass! ""
It's been a long time smugglin. - now I'm done!
It's all over now! It's lookin' like I'm Audi, son. (like I'm Audi, son!)
""Now I'm headed up the river with the boat and no pad-dle! (smuggler...)
And they got me in lock dooooown... "" (smuggler...)

The men here, so sealable doors, so stand clear
Breath takin', niggas rollin' up with the gat shakin'
No puss here, brothers sadly mistaken
The chains breakin', back to check the rules you fakin'
That's violation, like a Muslim eatin' bacon
Much got the beat breakin', faggots niggas instigatin'
I'm runnin' with the law while you triple six in your Satan
Comin' in blastin', with no maskin', niggas askin'
""How he lastin'?"" Jewels, with the tool flashin'
Blacked out now I'm lacked in, I'ma second win
More oxygen, niggas on my jock again

Runnin' with the PMD, universal, no rehearsal
Controversial, no commercial
All rough and rugged, you buckin' off at the straight thuggin'
Audio thumpin' and head bumpin'
Motherf**kers wanna hear somethin', CD's jumpin'
Thumpin' the ground all of a sudden
In the mist of the smoke I shut it - all competition
Set the condition to submission
From the contact I'm sparkin' at brain cells
Through songs and magazines and through the e-mail
I'm worldwide, six side, killafornia highs
No time, define, no wolfs, we need the blind
To the slaughter, I'm baptizin' you through the water
Pure hip-hop and D makes you grow like weed, proceed
That's right, Soul Assassins, the Hit Squad, Cypress Hill
All up in your dome piece

Pigs (clean vocal),UnKnown,UnKnown,"...Boulevard, (garbled) in the building next to the location
Suspects are seen climbing out of both windows. Male hispanic
And a possible male black
They have their vehic' er van parked outside...
This pig harassed the whole neighborhood
Well this pig worked at the station
This pig he killed my Homeboy
So the fuckin' pig went on a vacation
This pig he is the chief
He's got a brother pig Captain O'Malley
He's got a son that's a pig too
He's collectin' pay-offs from a dark alley
This pig is known as a Narco
If he's a pig or not, we know that he could be
This pig he's a fuckin' fag
So all his homepigs they call him a pussy
Well this pig, he's really cool
So in this class we know he rides all alone
Well this pig's standin' eatin' donuts
While some motherfuckers out robbin' your home
This pig he's a big punk
And I know that he can't stand the sight of me
'Cause pigs don't like it when ya act smart
And when ya tell 'em that you're a group from society
This pig works for the mafia
Makin' some money off crack
But this little pig got caught
So when he gets to the pen it's all about the payback
'Cause once he gets to the Pen
They won't provide the little pig with a bulletproof vest
To protect him from some mad nigga
Who he shot in the chest and placed under arrest
An' it's all about breakin' off sausage
Do ya feel sorry for the poor little swine?
Niggas wanna do him in the ass
Just to pay his ass back, so they're standin' in line
That fuckin' pig
Look what he got himself into
Now they're gonna make some pigs feet outta this little punk

B-R: *grrrrrah!*
B-R and SD: *mexican yells*
SD: Cometelo! (eat it!)
Verse One: B Smooth
Word up, Tequila style... eat the worm Motherfucker
(overlapping intro's end)
Tequila spice, hot nice
Milling rice, sipping on Jose Cuervo
Down in Tiajuana, Mexico
Thinking of the big score the night before
Met the connect, who was impressively dressed
In high fabrics
With troops like Babe Ruth, up on the mezzanine
Brandishing sub-machine guns, aye-yo
It's all about the money, son
Now that's the only reason
We came south of the border, to complete this work order
We gotta get it, no looking back, going all out for it
Ready to attack, die in a minute flat for it
As God is my witness, we got ditches
For all you motherfuckin fake bitches
It all boils down to the business
Nothing personal, when niggas acting like they helping you
I fuckin blast you like Frank Castle, motherfucker!
Chorus
Tequila Sunrise, bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die
So get the money nigga!
(repeat 2x)
Verse Two: B-Real
I never knew money like this, in the palm of my hand
'Til I met the man with mad hook-up, and big plan
Every where you look'a, he got everybody shook up
Running for cover, the big bad WOOF, motherfucker
He was like a father figure, show me the bigger picture
Fuck slangin' on the corner, don't let the pigs get you
Not like these fools who don't comprehend
You end up doing a twenty-five bid in the pen
You got that? Getting your cup, I took a swig
The bitter taste of the 'mezcal', free worm shit
Droppin' a lesson, he slapped my face, he said listen
Pay attention brotha, you're my ace, but don't ever question
Just do what I say, and you'll be rich
And keep this in your mind: rats lay in a ditch with no spine
Don't ever forget that golden rule in the game
Cheers, they all know your name, it's like fame
Why, women and money don't mix, like drinking an' driving
Watch those conniving women and keep your eye out
Always be aware of what's around you
They wanna down you, and fuckin clown you
Keep your shit in order the money won't stop
Pretty soon you'll be on top
Chorus
Verse Three: B-Real
Tequila Sunrise, with the bloodshot eyes
My, my, my, how time flies and goes by surprise
My mentor passed on and passed a warn to me, emergency
For my enemies who wanna murder me
Eat the worm, motherfucker, while you burn, motherfucker
Better kill me, don't let me return, motherfucker
Trust no man, cause I'll be back, you understand?
With a plan, and my ace in hand, I want it all
I recall the words from Jesus, you are the Juice
Better go get it, don't let it get to your head, embed it
Let these words stick, you better be ready to die
Now take a fucking sip, caution it, but I never lie

Psychodelic Vision (Explicit),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Intro 4x)
Lalalala-lala-lalala
(B-Real)
I'll admit, I was a wild seed when I was a kid
Slangin dope, poppin Shroomz and droppin lots of sin
Psychodelic visions would ensue
My view feelin the alter-states as they altered my fate
But I ??? ???, all that distorted shit brought it up
I came short and couldn't afford to store it up
So I began to record it on audio
The autobiography of Luis Mario
Something that's unbelievable, inconceivable
That half the shit I set out to do was achievable
But alas, look at all the shit come to pass
While we remained strong, others broke like glass
Cos you lack style, and you need all the help brother
Cos you're fragile, and it should say it on your cover:
This side up, for the celebrity
Who lacks intelligence, integrity, intensity
Oh it's true, I got you in that angle like Kurt
But don't go gettin your fuckin feelings hurt
I spit many bars of heat, that burn like a furnace
I pour rhymes out like coffee spillin out your 'dermis
(Chorus 2x)
(Lalalala-lala-lalala)
I got my 9mm at my waist, papa
I got my shotgun in the escalade, papa
If you feel groggy then jump and get sprayed, papa
I don't wanna but you dug your own grave, papa
(B-Real)
You know me and you've grown with me
And if I had a big enough pad, I'd take you all home with me
I don't walk around with bodyguards, that's not me
I'm hangin out with the people as my posse
Used to have a lot of enemies with bad intentions
Spreading gossip like disease, creating lots of tension
People turn around when you become a star it seems
But others hate you all cos you've fulfilled all your dreams
They smile in your face and act like nothing's wrong
When you turn your back, they hate, and play one of your
Songs
Why don't you take your mask off, look me in the eye?
You afraid I might blast-off and call you on your life?
Take a deep one, and peep son
Retribution comes around more than once, like a re-run
You're a cheap one to kill, so steep son
You're just another one who gets thrown in the quay, son
Chorus:
(B-Real)
You know they smile in your face
You know they try to take space
I let you punks know you ain't safe
Cos you know you're just dead-weight
But at the present day they gettin stalled out for some
Reason
But not from me, because it's punk-hunt season
Charged with high-treason, I'm easin the blow never
The ????, that you're leasin, ain't gonna roll forever
So think about that, is it worth the pain?
When you flirt with pain, bitch you don't hurt your brain
But you're thick-headed, numbskull and Rick said it:
It was the moment you feared, when my venom spreaded
(Chorus 2x)
You know they smile in your face
You know they try to take space
I let you punks know you ain't safe
Cos you know you're just dead-weight",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-psychodelic-vision-explicit-lyrics
How I Could Just Kill a Man (radio / clean version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"""It's another one of them old phunky Cypress Hill things, you know what I'm sayin'?
And it goes like this:""
Hey, don't miss out on what you're passing
You're missing the hootah
Of the funky buddha
Eluder of your fucked-up styles, I get wicked
So come on as Cypress starts to kick it
'Cause we're like the outlaws stridin'
While suckers are hidin'
Jump behind the bush when you see me drivin'
By
Hanging out the window
With my magnum taking out some putos
Acting kind of loco
I'm just another local
Kid from the street getting paid from my vocals
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
I'm ignoring all the dumb shit
Yo, because nothing is coming from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fuckin' around my gat straight humming
Hummin', coming at ya
Yeah ya know I had to gatt ya
Time for some action
Just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance
To run the interference
Into your satellite
Shining a battle light
Sen got the gatt and I know that he'll gatt you right
Here's an example
Just a little sample
How I could just kill a man
One time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome
I said, ""Yo, it's on!""
Take cover son or you're assed-out
How do you like my chrome then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast him but I did anyway
That young punk had to pay
So I just killed a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I had to establish
To light my spliff ignite
You with insight
So if you ain't down, bullshit
Say some punk tried to get you for your auto
Would you call the One-time and play the role model?
No! I think you'll play like a thug
Next you hear the shot of a magnum slug
Humming, coming at ya
Yeah, ya know I'm gonna gatt ya!
How you know where I'm at when you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm coming from
When you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here risking my dome
Just for a bucket
Or a fast ducket
Just to stay alive, yo I got to say ""fuck it!""
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

Stoned Is The Way Of The Walk - LP Version,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Stoned is the way of the walk
Stoned is the way of the walk
Well, it's the alley cat puffin' on a hootie rat
Some think I'm a criminal but yo, I ain't all of that
Hit cha with the baseball bat and ya wanna, ill though
Wanna mess around, you get fucked on the hill, bro
Kick it like a steel toe, real slow, hits from the bong
Make me feel like Cheech and I'm kickin' it wit' Chong
Just like Cheech and Chong frontin' with ice cream
Cypress hill is here to give you a nice dream
Speak it like a rolla' and you know it's rolled tightly
I'm like the funky beat, so, why ya tryin' ta fight me?
Pigs often site me, that's not polite, G
And any hour of the day ya know I might be
Harassed by a pig, real fast, they wanna Rodney King me
Always tryin'a crown my ass, ain't got no class, no class
I hit they' ass like the Buddha that's stinky
They wanna scruff but, they just so rinky dinky
I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk
Sen gots the Philly, and he's gonna light the blunt
Sippin' at the curfew makes me go koo koo
Somthin' like loco then turn in to this loo coo
Binggin the beta, yea, now the funk is risen
Got the beta bass and the nasal highzen
As I kick a trip, it comin' straight from my siness
Crazy nasal vocals cannot make the hotties loco
I remember sista Maggie, breast were kinda saggy
Used to sell me Buddha outta fucked up little 
Honeyed up a twenty even when I had no money
She said, ""Pay me back with some Latin dick, Sonnie""
Well, I neva' went out and I don' think I'm gonna
Just for some Buddha, she wanted me ta bone her
Deminin', ya think, ya meanin'
I got somethin' for the hoes ta be skeamin' on
I'm the Buddha, real take a trip ta hoota'ville
I'll throw ya out the door of my big blue siville
Then light another joint, this ain't no exploitation, point
'Cause we are the ones stonein' in the ways of the mastas
Stoned is the way of the walk
Stoned is the way of the walk
Stoned is the way of the walk
Stoned is the way of the walk
Hit they ass, hit they ass
Make the Buddha get stinky
Alas, captain, there's a ship in sight

On my side is my gat, see I'm all of that

You talkin' shit, try to take me for a ride
I'm not a bad guy but I'm the funky feel one
Finger on the trigger with my hands upon the steel
Lettin' out a bullet, this is going boo-ya
You're stuck in my hood, so what ya gonna do now?
Being the hunted one is no fun
Here I come son, yo I think you better run
Better run more and move a little faster
Second of thought and I'm coming to blast ya
With my
Sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump
Left hand on a forty, puffin' on a blunt
Pumped my shotgun, niggas didn't jump
La la la la la la la laaaa
Comin' at you like a stiff blow, fuckin' up your program
Ain't takin' shit from you him or no man
Master mind maniac and a menace
Oh, how they want to pass a sentence
All because a nigga tried to play me on the trigger
He missed, So now the nigga's hist'
Rude and crude like a pitbull

Now, I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And I'm handin' out beatdowns

And I'm handin' out beatdowns

Put me in chains, try to beat my brains
I can get out, but the grudge remains

Headed up the river with a boat and no paddle

What’s Your Number? (Explicit a cappella),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Let's go!
I met her at the club, her friend liked me but she didn't
She noticed a lot of girls giving up their phone digits
She didn't want to be one of those ho's whose clothes
Exploiting their body's from head to toes. She had glossy lips
She was swaying her hips on the dance floor and every nigga's
Flashing the grips trying to impress her in vain
She gave no play, Niggas hit her up for numbers and she said no way
I thought to myself let it go the girl on beat
But like Smoky said she really had a hold on me
I couldn't stop staring I started to fantasize with her
Voices in my head said she's tantalizing ya. Even if I
Moved to the other side of the party I had pictures in my
Head of her moving that body. I was beside myself with conquer
Pain so I slowly walked over and I asked her name
Chorus 2x:
What's your name? What's your number?
I would like to get to know you
Can we have a conversation?
The night is young, Girl
Give me a chance
She gave a smile but I got no answer though it took a while
Before she could gave a chance she sat too cool. I offered her
A drink she turned me down flat she said If you want my name
You gotta do better than that. I said, Okay, now your shit
Don't stink, I'ma walk away, only tried to buy you a drink
As I began to walk away she said I'm sorry for reals, but every
Guy in the club tries slipping me pills, I don't trust that each
And everyone would lie to you I said I understand but that's
Not what I tried to do, I wasn't even gonna go to your table but
If I didn't, I knew that I'd regret it later. I go after what I
Want but I got class. For me no need to slip a pill if I want
She gave me a funny look, I couldn't tell what it meant. She let
Her guard down and on the conversation went
Chorus 2x:
What's your name? What's your number?
I would like to get to know you
Can we have a conversation?
The night is young, Girl
Give me a chance
Lets go!
She said: I want a man with the plan and ambition, not an immature nigga
On a pussy-hit mission. I'm too good for that, I've got so much to offer
Got a good job, working at my mom and dad's law firm. You got
Goals? that's what she asked, Yeah, I want to fill my home with
Platinum plaques. It takes hard work but you know it's coming
After. She said Oh My God! You must be a famous rapper. I do
Alright, but I'm never satisfied. I'm told 'when you still love
What you do it never gets old'. I strive for more but that's enough
About me. Why don't we skip out the club, take a walk on the street?
We slipped outta the club with no worries, seemed she wanted to get
Out in a hurry. We hung all night, and we lost our friends...'til
They caught us banging in the back of a Benz

Trunkload, ready to hit the highway
Don't let the eye in the sky fly my way

If not they'd be drinkin and drivin and swervin
But thanks to Dr. Greenthumb weed grow
In the backyard or inside with hydro
To the cush plant brushin a tangerine dream
Tasty, blowin a fuckin smokescreen
Cycles of weed are constantly grown
Somebody give me the razor to cut groves
I'd like to stop, but it feels so good
Horny plants stinkin up my whole neighborhood
Sticky angel, I neva wanna leave green alone
But never ever ever got a warrant for my home
What that funny sound knockin at the door (Open up it's the DEA!)
Sorry Greenthumb can't talk no more
Please don't follow me into the sun
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Out from the lab, no need for rehab
If I can't drive then call me a cab (taxi!)
In my closet the weed is dried out
Like Eiht said, ain't no place to hide out
I don't wanna buy no weed from no cop
Get locked up and they close up my shop
That's why I buy no weed from no one
That's why they call me Dr. Greenthumb
The scientifical, mystical one
Growin my crops with the rays of the sun
Come one come all and see how it's done
If you see the pigs there's no need to run
Cause some of these pigs are down with Greenthumb
But you never know what be the outcome
You see the photo in the album
The weed is growin like my erection
Look I never told you where I was from
Some call me Real, but I'm Dr. Greenthumb

Got one under my coat
It’s late night no stage fright
I'm going for broke
While I'm hittin’ my smoke
I'm contemplatin' how to hit em hard
Hit em fast
Get away it's all she wrote
It's a heartbreaking habit
When you gotta have it
You grab it
Stare at an album
So good at it
Certified
Good magic
Look at it
In your face
Money's gone
So am I so long
But now my hustle's changed
No more stickin' you up
I’ve got some weed I know that for sure it can lift you up
Just spark it up
I gotta dime or a twenty sack
All sales are final
Don’t ask for your money back
Don't even look at the money sack
It’s funny that
It still wasn't enough
I like still searchin' for honey flack
No I'm servin’ the boulders
Looking over my shoulders
Every step that I take
A rock might knock me over

Strike the match
That sparks the flame
Start the fire that burns down the system
Hit em hard hit em fast
Keep the gas on em
We're gonna char
Get the dogs go gas on em

Lone range
A brace to be a gangster
Grew up
Rock stages
A long way from
But i got gauges
Comin' out pullin guns out on strangers
Bunch a wild niggas
Nobody can tame us
Sixteen in the clip
One in the chamber
Drive by homicide
Shit I gotta roll a dime
Ever day I ran away
My life one helluva time
I like to see heads get busted
A problem
That's how i solve em
No discussion
Go for my mind
Task force rush em
Until that day
All i gotta say is fuck em

Strike the match
That sparks the flame
Start the fire that burns down the system
Hit em hard hit em fast
Keep the gas on em
We're gonna char
Get the dogs go gas on em

Post it on the top son
Claw some
Makin' my way
Through the jungle
Living with the life
Call something
Evolving with each hustle
The street sweep
To a heatseeker
With ambitions to be a ring leader
When you're in the top spot
You better be top notch
If not watch the haters take pot shots
It's non-stop shit talkin'
Beat off the conflict
Ready to harm him
Disarm him
Send his ass away in a coffin
My game is silent you don't see it that often
But every passing day I see the time slipping away
Ticket on a train 'til an early grave
Reap what you sough
Never had a handout
Had my hustle's planned out
Worked to get the brand out
You wish my luck would run out

Strike the match
That sparks the flame
Start the fire that burns down the system
Hit em hard hit em fast
Keep the gas on em
We're gonna char
Get the dogs go gas on em",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-strike-the-match-lyrics

Trapped like a prophet, but I still profit

Hif is here to hack you sown, Son is here to buck you down
Joke's on you, if you're the biggest duck in town
You got to relax, we got to kick back
Brothers just sit back, enjoy me like a six pack

Yo where you gettin took, but that's another story, black

Flyer than the other broad, workin off the pitched rod
Isn't that odd, instead of sayin my dick's hard
It's not about knockin you, do you feel like clockin' loot?
Forget it act stupid little sucker I'll be clockin' you
With the right or left hand, duck they was still stand
Troopers on the side step, bucks him down to death man
With the greater lyric, if you can spare it
Just an ass kickin' is what you inherit
So don't try to snake off, you know I can't be shook off
Why the suckers took off? Well that's another story black
'Cause I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One
I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One
I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One
You know I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One
Standin on the corner, close to the real estate
Clones they really pull stickin brothers try to imitate
Meaning when they simulate, but they can't stimulate
Like a faded joint, stiff from the breath I take
Make me act loco, they switchin' up my vocal
Out to catch you so-called, MC's with a roll call
Then you gotta close your eyes, you can't stand the sunlight
There is just one light, the Tribe's buckin' heads tonight
Buck buck buck ya head! Sorry that red is dead
Deader than a door nail, someone cold made his bed
Didn't just break out, the sucker got cracked out
Hit the pipe and blacked out, with the shit from back down
So much more integrity, greatest deal I hook up
Was a funky looker, but that's another story black
'Cause we're the Real ones, yes the Phuncky Feel Ones
We're the Real ones, yes the Phuncky Feel Ones
We're the Real ones, yes the Phuncky Feel Ones

What’s Your Number? (clean album version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Let's go!
I met her at the club, her friend liked me but she didn't
She noticed a lot of girls giving up their phone digits
She didn't want to be one of those ho's whose clothes
Exploiting their body's from head to toes. She had glossy lips
She was swaying her hips on the dance floor and every nigga's
Flashing the grips trying to impress her in vain
She gave no play, Niggas hit her up for numbers and she said no way
I thought to myself let it go the girl on beat
But like Smoky said she really had a hold on me
I couldn't stop staring I started to fantasize with her
Voices in my head said she's tantalizing ya. Even if I
Moved to the other side of the party I had pictures in my
Head of her moving that body. I was beside myself with conquer
Pain so I slowly walked over and I asked her name
Chorus 2x:
What's your name? What's your number?
I would like to get to know you
Can we have a conversation?
The night is young, Girl
Give me a chance
She gave a smile but I got no answer though it took a while
Before she could gave a chance she sat too cool. I offered her
A drink she turned me down flat she said If you want my name
You gotta do better than that. I said, Okay, now your shit
Don't stink, I'ma walk away, only tried to buy you a drink
As I began to walk away she said I'm sorry for reals, but every
Guy in the club tries slipping me pills, I don't trust that each
And everyone would lie to you I said I understand but that's
Not what I tried to do, I wasn't even gonna go to your table but
If I didn't, I knew that I'd regret it later. I go after what I
Want but I got class. For me no need to slip a pill if I want
She gave me a funny look, I couldn't tell what it meant. She let
Her guard down and on the conversation went
Chorus 2x:
What's your name? What's your number?
I would like to get to know you
Can we have a conversation?
The night is young, Girl
Give me a chance
Lets go!
She said: I want a man with the plan and ambition, not an immature nigga
On a pussy-hit mission. I'm too good for that, I've got so much to offer
Got a good job, working at my mom and dad's law firm. You got
Goals? that's what she asked, Yeah, I want to fill my home with
Platinum plaques. It takes hard work but you know it's coming
After. She said Oh My God! You must be a famous rapper. I do
Alright, but I'm never satisfied. I'm told 'when you still love
What you do it never gets old'. I strive for more but that's enough
About me. Why don't we skip out the club, take a walk on the street?
We slipped outta the club with no worries, seemed she wanted to get
Out in a hurry. We hung all night, and we lost our friends...'til
They caught us banging in the back of a Benz
Chorus 4x:
What's your name? What's your number?
I would like to get to know you
Can we have a conversation?

Quick look around, you can't hide
You just might die right where you are

You're a lost soul rollin down the street
Hustlin, scramblin, money you eat
You wanna jack somebody, never look at me
Cause I'm like you when I'm holdin heat
You don't want to think about re-percussions
Cause you don't give a f**k about who you rushin
So what you gonna do when the blood is gushin?
You're playin Roulette without the Russian
The stakes are high; can you feel the pressure?
Lookin at the club on top of your dresser
Born for the big bank robbin your own
Thinkin your stone but your weak ass throne
Bitches like you ain't got no heart
Paranoid, you're settin in, fallin apart
How many times will you take to see it?
You fallin away, but you don't believe it

Jack me and you'll never go back

Knock em in their face if they dedicate closer
A Cuban massive man (Spanish)
With real attack touch straight, from the ghetto
Walk for a twenty all day like a (Spanish)

I'm not a bad guy, but I'm the funky feel
Finger on the trigger with my hands upon the steel
Lettin' out a bullet, this is goin' boo-ya
You're stuck in my hood, so what ya gonna do now?
Being the hunted one is no fun
Here I come son, yo I think ya better run
Better run more, and move a little faster
Second of thought and I'm coming to blast ya

Ain't takin shit from you him or no man
Master mind maniac and a menace soooo
How they want to pass sentence
All because a nigga tried to play me on the trigger
He missed, so now the nigga's pissed
Rude and crude like a pit bull, get to the point
Your fuckin card will get pulled, now
I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And I'm handin out beatdowns
I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And I'm handin out beatdowns 
Put me in chains, try to beat my brains
I can get out, but the grudge remains
When I see ya punk ass, I'm gonna getcha

Take a lot of mental for the blunted to chill with
Cuz I'm the chill one, known to get ill one
They stepped to the Hill ""What's up?"", I had to kill one
Now I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And they got me on lock down
Headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And they got me on lock down
Living like a nigga who done lost his mind
Cause I ain't goin out like a spineless jellyfish
Some say life is a bitch
Ask that punk who dug his own ditch
Out for the Hill fuckin up at a party
Tried to get funny, put a hole in his body

Look at all of those funeral cars

Te persigo y te sigo y te meto como un palo
Juntando raperos como modos en la mesa
Sopresa, te rompi la cabeza
Te pongo a dormir, con abrazo de pescueso

Haciendo los shows rapeando contra cualquiera
Fuerte con estilo que gente ni sabia
Mira que matamos a muchos ese dia
No tenian chance, los desvaratamos
Y hasta este dia todavia melozamos

If they come runnin' up I make them hurt again

Your rhymeness and blindness, just find out who was rhymeless
The shit weighs out in a month, the loss goes on timeless
Ya rolled into crimeless, aggravated and shineless
I designed this for the lost who need to find this
The blind baby and maybe you need someone to lead you
Stop actin' like an infant, I'm tired of force feedin' you
You can't keep runnin' from the destiny that's meetin' you
It's your own soul, your own ghost that keeps beatin' you


Pump up the volume so ya eardrums are rattlin'
This is just a warning before I begin battlin'
Unsensible with ya actions with ya tractions
I'm facin' the methodical, serial rhymes in my state
Meets periodical, we're in a hostile, colossal
Situation and it's possible to get from the bust, bust, bust
From penetration, lyrical blows
You cynical hoes are speechless


The psychological, projectile article missionary
Start to realize what the f**k in speech is scary
It's diabolical, straddle on top of you
When mister rebels spray levels of melodical
With doses of venom, big toke go hypnotic
Go for broke cause if ya lose control ya end up in the hospital
Incomprehensible, unconventional, go go go
From eventual tactics",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-child-of-the-west-lyrics
The Phuncky Feel One (extended version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Are you ready?
Ladies and gentlemen, 'bout ready to get down?
Are you ready?
Ladies and gentlemen, 'bout ready to get down?
Ladies and gentlemen
Well I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One
Cypress Hill has come, any quest/just ask them
Cause we are answerin, any brothers that've been
On the dick swingin, and straight gatherin'
Enter da info, 'cause yo what you're in fo'
Is a crazy day, strapped in a pimp mode
Trapped like a prophet, but I still profit
Even when you're off it, bank's in my pocket
'Cause of my music, what you call me chumpy?
In my trade, the Tribe is known to get funky
Hif is here to hack you sown, Son is here to buck you down
Joke's on you, if you're the biggest duck in town
You got to relax, we got to kick back
Brothers just sit back, enjoy me like a six pack
As I let the rhyme flow into the hook
Yo where you gettin took, but that's another story, black
'Cause I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One
I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One
I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One
You know I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One
Night in a stiff block, hangin up the pimp's jock
Used to call me Pimp Poppa, 'cause I likes to hip-hop
'Cause I'm down with Cypress, illin' well I might
Begin to take your girl, your girl she's the flyest
Flyer than the other broad, workin off the pitched rod
Isn't that odd, instead of sayin my dick's hard
It's not about knockin you, do you feel like clockin' loot?
Forget it act stupid little sucker I'll be clockin' you
With the right or left hand, duck they was still stand
Troopers on the side step, bucks him down to death man
With the greater lyric, if you can spare it
Just an ass kickin' is what you inherit
So don't try to snake off, you know I can't be shook off
Why the suckers took off? Well that's another story black
'Cause I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One
I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One
I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One
You know I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One
Standin on the corner, close to the real estate
Clones they really pull stickin brothers try to imitate
Meaning when they simulate, but they can't stimulate
Like a faded joint, stiff from the breath I take
Make me act loco, they switchin' up my vocal
Out to catch you so-called, MC's with a roll call
Then you gotta close your eyes, you can't stand the sunlight
There is just one light, the Tribe's buckin' heads tonight
Buck buck buck ya head! Sorry that red is dead
Deader than a door nail, someone cold made his bed
Didn't just break out, the sucker got cracked out
Hit the pipe and blacked out, with the shit from back down
So much more integrity, greatest deal I hook up
Was a funky looker, but that's another story black
'Cause we're the Real ones, yes the Phuncky Feel Ones
We're the Real ones, yes the Phuncky Feel Ones
We're the Real ones, yes the Phuncky Feel Ones
You know we're the Real ones, yes the Phuncky Feel Ones",https://genius.com/Cypress-hill-the-phuncky-feel-one-extended-version-lyrics
