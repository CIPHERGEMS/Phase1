Poppa Large,Funk Your Head Up,1992,"I keep in shape and do my physical fitness
Your head's numb, so your brains a miss this
Pick 'em up, eat 'em up, pick 'em up, heat 'em up
Pick 'em up picklehead, pick 'em up picky
I roll wit globs and I come real sticky
Grippin' the mic, I plug it up in your ears
Crazed and brewer. I'm coming out like beers
Like Rheingold, Miller, Coors, and Buds
I'm a eat 'em wit popcorn and treat 'em like suds you duds
Coming out the wick wack, wicky, wickable wack
Black jack, that's a fact, writing exact behind your back
The funk rhyme'n master, blaster
Kicking up in a brainstorm, rainstorm
Rap storm, rap form
Rap time, rap rhyme
Rap class, I'm here to fail and to pass
To continue, furthermore on the hype tip
I roll and rock, rock and roll
Jazz and pop, rhythm and Blues
Dance and fusion, brain confusion
Look at the lights, what a night on the town

I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast

Now I'm back to funk, freak the funk
Hype the funk, swipe the funk and all that junk
I get busy on 'em, communicate wit the world
Man, woman, a baby boy and a girl
Poppa large looking out, the bombs drop
Taking stroud while your face and arms drop
Stop, look, learn to read, learn to write
Learn to talk, learn to walk
And watch your step though, I'm hype and ripe though
Kleptomaniac, a rhyme'n psycho
A Ricky Ricardo, a Guy Lombardo
Sporting a ragtop, an El Dorado
Step into Hollywood, I'm screening the boulevards
The rhymes is gain type, I'm ready to pull a card
Jack'a Ace, King'a Queen
Call me the deuce, I'm pouring out like juice
Hitting the top, feeling the rim
Getting a trim, I never rhyme like them
On and on, on and on, on and on
Until the break of dawn
I go overtime, rock the mic in nighttime
Daytime, switching off to Primetime
Pacific east, strolling back in the west time
Ride the funk wit the mic in the east rhyme
Hype and dope, hype the frame
The mic is smoking, yo I ain't joking
Rhyme to kill, rhyme to murder, rhyme to stomp
Rhyme to ill, rhyme to rock
Rhyme to smack, rhyme to shock, rhyme to roll
Rhyme to destroy any decoy boy
On the microphone

I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast

You're dripping sweaty, coming hard on your neck
As I flow and grow from head to toe
Seeking a style like John McEnroe
Dissing 'em all, serving them wit the mic stand
Like Prince and Michael coming out wit a big band
The crowd is live, you can play as the manager
Run wit the money, I pull the trigger and damage ya
Boom, taking life more serious
I may sound lyrical and very mysterious
Rhymes are grip tight, program to kill more
A son of Sam, how could I be Gilmore?
Grabbing the mic, you see the dark and shadows
You're in living hell, without time to battle
The funk ignited, hands are writing, brains dividing
I'm coming out in sighting
Like I'm Blackula, a better man that Dracula
Spectacular and not irregular
In fact you are speaking impopular
Rhymes are moved and you can't be stop wit the
Beat as it goes to the rhyme that flows
Like a coke in a straw burning up in your nose
That's a bad habit, stepping out on stage one
Drop the mic, come and turn to page one
Look at the master, my rank is higher
My lyrical burns, your brain's on fire

I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast",https://genius.com/Ultramagnetic-mcs-poppa-large-lyrics
Critical Beatdown,Critical Beatdown,1988.0,"Well I'm the equalizer, known to be graphic
I clear static, breakin up traffic
Move, while I enter the groove
I'm on top, and happy to prove
To wack MC's who claim to be better than
No way, I'm frankly more clever than
All of you, each and every one, my son
Pay close attention
I take your brain to another dimension
Hold it, mold it, shape it
You got a knife, yes I wanna scrape it
Up and down, sideways, any way I can
Be rude to you
But I'll rap and be crude to you
And eat up, 
toy ducks
 I beat up
I am the oven your brains I wanna heat up
Mega, supersonic degrees
I come around, roastin MC's
With fire, to burn the toy liar
Raw meat, turn the flame higher
Cook it, like a fish I'll hook it
For any beat, it's time that I took it
Right, correctly to the top
With the rhythm and as your head bop
I'm hype, for the critical beatdown!

I'm attacking them, my job is stacking them
For every rapper, must I be smacking them
Once, or twice in the face
With rough beats, producin the bass
That blow out, cause power to go out
Inner spark, I'm ready to blow out
Like this, altitude level
Reachin forth, stompin every devil
In sight, you might just wanna bite
My illusions, mental confusions
You're a mark, skulls I've been abusin
Losin, any rapper who follow me
Your girl loves me, now she wanna swallow me
Back up, move on to the rear
When I'm on the stage should be clear
Speakin, goin ear to ear
Places far, ducks would appear
For the countdown, so you wait to rhyme
And twist, stuttering, uttering
Parkay, margerine, everything butter
And another thing, you shoulda been a Muppet
A toy boy, 
a thin string puppet
I'm takin titles, and punks better up it
To me, Ced Gee on the mic, and I'm hype
For the critical beatdown!

Here's the K, combined the double-O
Swing in the L, I'm ready to go
As Keith, Rap General Chief Executive
Plus 
exquisitive
Mandatory, capital statements
I am the teacher, preaching what makes sense
Class, you wasn't able to pass
For any germ or lice who come last
I'm boric, high computing acid
Get off the mic and won't you please pass it
To me, for a one-two check
Give me a pound and lots of respect
No hands, you dissapointing my fans
You on reverb, and talking to cans
Hello - how are you doing?
I come to wreck, and parties I'll ruin
With rhymes, pumpin up smoke
Diesel advances makin them choke
And cough up, the hard-headed I'll soften
Spongee, then after that drink a dungee
Roll the sess, the buddha with the ganji
Puff up, while I make tough stuff up
I'm Kool Keith, cold rippin MC's

Just for you; it's the Ultramagnetic MC's!

Say what, Peter Piper?
To hell with childish rhymes!
'Cause this jam is just movin'

They use the simple back and forth, the same, old rhythm
That a baby can pick up, and join, right with them
But their rhymes are pathetic, they think they copacetic
Using nursery terms, at least not poetic
On a educated base, intelligent wise
As the record just turn, you learn, plus burn
By the flame of the lyrics which cooks the human brain
Providing overheating knowledge, by means causing pain
Like a migraine headache, your cells start to melt
While the Technics spin, the wax is on the felt
Motivating clockwise the more you realize
Moe Love's moving steady, by most, with Everready
Like a battery, charged, I'm worth the alkaline

Usin' frequencies and data, I am approximate
Leaving revolutions turning, emerging chemistry
With the precise implications, achieved, adversely
Explorating, demonstrating, ruling, dominating
Igniting causing friction with nuclear alarms
Separates competing biters from me, the scientist
As I execute lyricists known as predators
When by strippin' high potents and makin' penicillins
I will surely sort out, and stomp, every pest
Of the rampaging paramedic, potent is my title
To inform other worlds of such, a hellacaust

Leading melodies obtaining slight positive beams
Of the average formulation, apply mechanically
Maintainable display expressed by alternate
Microwave frequencies, directly inorganic
Operating logically, new developments
Separate, accumulating ambiguous thoughts
Admitting parts, specify particular words
Volunteer, agitating ears of parasites
Respond, duplicating, attempting lyricists
Like a notch competition and ultimate reality

Leaving specimens frozen near zero degrees
By controlling every germ, and spraying disinfectant
With tranquillized brains and stunned competitors

Ever basic style of writing, they have no elevation
That their audience respects and gives them an ovation
Yet they think they’re so inventive, using lousy edits
Biting companies' beats, too cheap, and get the credit
On the scandal type base, embezzlement-wise
Now as my lyrics tell the truth, they'll sue plus juice
And by the force of my rhythm which freezes the average man
Allow a force fightin' rhythm which can’t be redefined
Gamma ray, planet-wise, no more you will despise
Ced Gee, I’m always ready, at least I’m not confetti
Like a missile I’m precise to zero-in on others
Bein’  to cancel out the others
This rhyme I’m reciting, the words are so exciting

With a scratch

Ease Back,Critical Beatdown,1988.0,"""30 seconds to respond—""
""30 seconds to respond with our anti-ballistic missile""

Say what (yea) now ease back to the rear
You hear eardrums drown, the bass pound
Real stupid, we didn't loop this
Nor did we scoop it, it's that we rock it
While ducks jock this
Biting and writing and fighting for this
Beats and wax, rhymes are facts
Biting acts
How we did it, for this one, that one
Biters around, check out the sound
In town, to the rhythm that we give 'em
In fact you lack (Ultramagnetic) skills
'Cause your record's no frills
Here's your bill now ease back
Ease back

I'm back, back to smack attack
Those who wack and lack my experience
On the microphone holding my own ground
Dominating forces
Change the sources, punks takes losses
Enough 'cause it's me on the mic
Feeding on words, smart like a nerd
Haven't you heard this change of rhyme
Continuing the land of time
For my incredible, highly elevated
Smooth in the mind, more sophisticated
Motivated, as I relate it verbal
Dissing a mouse and smacking any gerbil
I bought a Saab, a 1990 Turbo
Shining, fog lights in the front
I'm by myself, no seats for a stunt
'Cause I want it like that, I got it like that
I have it like that, I need it like that
It's better like that, I made it like that
I bought it like that, I'm living like that
For you wack MC's
Who go on the mic and blow on the mic
And perpetrate frauds and making mistakes
Like an amateur but I'm a 20 year veteran
And better than, including the rest of them
I chew 'em all and spit out the best of them
One by one, I'm teaching my son to ease back
Ease back

What's up, it's me again
I'm Ced Gee wit a funky blend
Of beats and rhymes on time with my DJ
He's not weak with anything he plays
Rocking, slicing, rep is treacherous
Like a professor, he had perfected this
Simple potion, through devotion
With his blends, his motions and fastly approaching
Coasting, reaching higher levels
So when you see 'em, you best say hello
I'ma take out a knife, pen and paper and write
A rhyme so dope you can't think, can't cope
Ducks, who are you really kidding
You say you're dope, well you're admitting
That you can't compete because you're rhymes are weak
Full of more nonsense, past tense, incomplete
Weep and learn a new rap style
From Ced Gee, the wizard of know how
An innovation, elevation, psyching the nation
When I ease back

Give the Drummer Some,Critical Beatdown,1988.0,"One two, one two
Ultramagnetic's in full effect
We talkin' about givin' the drummer some
You know what, Kool Keith, yo, tell 'em what's on your mind

I'm ready
And now it's my turn to build
Uplift, get swift, then drift
Off... and do my own thing
Switch up
Change my pitch up
Smack my bitch up, like a pimp
For any rapper who attempt to wear Troop's
And step on my path
I'm willing as a A-1 General
Rhyme Enforcer 235 on a rhyme test
Whatever group or vest in line
I put 'em all behind
Play MC Ultra as a warning sign of my
Skill, and what my mind deserves
I smell a grape in the duck preserves
And who deserves the right to be king of the screen
And shout wack poetry
What, are you buggin'
Germs that want to law me
Quit it, before I heat your ear off
Let your burn deduct another year off rappin'
For a face I'm slappin'
Gimme applause when hands start clappin'
Now give the drummer some

Well I'm Ced
The Rhyming Force Delta
When I enter, you best take shelter
Cuz I'm dope, and yes I will melt a
Anyone who tried to even felt a
Emotion, or thought that they could hang with me
I cut you up, because you are my enemy
On my stage, interfering with my radius
So step back, cuz I'mma start to spray with this
Can, of Raid Spray
If you're a germ, filthy like AIDS, I'll
Clean, you up with heat
Vapors, scrubbin' and scrubbing
Like a mistake on paper, I'm rubbin'
Erasin' you out like some ink
Cuz you dirty, your rhymes are stink
Like garbage, I hafta put you in a Hefty
Or instead, should I just let thee
Weak MC's accumulate like dust
Take out my duster, shine them up and
Teach... them respect
Hook 'em up just like a tape deck
Mono or Stereo, cuz I'm a real pro
With a cameo, and not an afro
This beat is funky, I'm not a nympho
You know why?
Then give the drummer some

Some rappers are ratin' us
Some are hatin' us
Some are talkin'
Some debatin' us
Critically, but physically my mind is
Self-taught like a rap pro designed us
A matter to burn MC's and toys with
Flame, 500 degrees of
Rhymes, that heat and cook and
Sizzle, your brain is on the grill at
Nighttime, and what about the daytime
I hear the wack ones, they get a lot of playtime
Saying they're wack and wastin' my airtime
You're #2 and next in my spare time
Another rhyme has to be controllin'
And for your brain, it must have been stolen
Tookin', yes, taken away
I'm on the court, and I'm fading away with a
Jumper, I shoot a rhyme in your face
Add the points while I rob the bass
Incredible, come in three dimensions
Parallel with the funky extensions
I'm Kool Keith runnin' rap conventions on

""Watch me now""
Watch me
""Watch me now""
Yo, Kool Keith—why everybody gotta watch you?

Well, I'm the ultimate—the rhyme imperial
I'm better, but some don't believe me though
But I'm a pro in hot material
On your Walkman, box or any stereo
Uno, dos not cuatro
Spanish girls, they like to call me Pancho
On the mic, innovating this pat-ter-en
You fell off, your brain is on Sa-tur-en
Take steps, and climb my ladder-and
Climb... climb, climb
Pace the rhythm, and clock the time
That I leave, come back on beat
Different, telling and selling
Like a Skyjet, plane propelling
But dwelling, deep in your skull
My rhyme shines, and yours is dull
Like dirt, it hurt to be wacker
But instead, I'll grab a big stack of
Wack MC's, lay em down like tile
Scrap and garbage, germs I'll pile
To keep clean, I'm in a movie scene
Ears turn, and needles lean
To cut scratches, in a part that matches
I'm leavin' eyes, and brains with patches
Stuck, so push my luck
For any roach, or MC duck
Just watch me

""Watch me now""
Word up, watch me now, suckers!
""Watch me now""
Yo, Ced Gee—why everybody gotta watch you?

I'm livin' large, my record's on the radio
Every day, you hear me, your stereo
Rappin hard, with lots of volume
You hear static, well use your fine tune
Knob, to tune me in better
'Cause I'm Ced Gee, and I would never let a
Wack MC G off with STYLE
Touch my mic, rip and smile
Like a duck, you know you are a soft punk
Livin pink, your material sucks
Liver and worse than you can imagine
You best run, 'cause I'ma put a badge in
Your brain, so you can see the real time
Grab a pen, and write down my rhyme
And learn it and learn it and learn it, until it sinks
Inside your skull and you're no longer pink
But red, 'cause now you are a biter
Learnin' from me, so I guess that is Oreida
Except if you try to be the original
Rhyme imperial, the exceptional Gee
Sometimes I rhyme offbeat, awkward
But different with the rhythm
Back and forth, one-two, and then I give 'em
A chance to see the world's greatest MC
Just watch me

""Watch me now""
Word up, you gotta watch me now
""Watch me now""
Moe Love, you needs to groove

{Moe Love cuts ""Testify, c'mon testify""}

I'm continuing! Back and forth
Your brain spins, facing North and
South and West, not East at a angle
But mines dangle, where's your Kangol?
It seems weird, your head is triangle
Like a mango, somethin' I snack on
A soft duck, somethin' I smack on
Every day, when I come outside
You step back, stay inside
Your house, while you look out your window
Your girl screams, where Kool Keith go?
Walkin', while punks keep talkin'
Annoyin' me, MC's hawkin'
On the stage, any time
I'm cold chillin', I'm wearin' the rhymes
To keep warm, with the beat that's playin'
You hear me now, you know what I'm sayin'
To you, you, and you
Your whole organization and crew
Just watch, as I enter your mind
Decorate, and paint my sign
I'm hazardous, so scatter this around
I'm Kool Keith, knockin MC's down
Just watch me, and him

Rhythm with madness, I had to have this
Chance to rock again so you can hear this
Over and over and over, until I'm finished
Hey but I'm not, so here's the rhythm
A rap beat step beat keep feet happy
As we gradually slowly we'll teach
All, how to rap, I will attract
All the def girls smack the ugly ones back
And sit, as I chill, I'm drinkin' Moet
Expensive champagne 'cause Ced Gee is a poet
Rappin and teachin', reachin' levels higher
Don't wanna be king, so don't call me sire
But instead, a scientist, with the breakthrough
My rap is funky, it can relate to
You, him, her, your little brother
His older sister, your baby's mother
Cousins, aunts, your whole family
In other words, Ced Gee, I'm absolutely
The best producer, at makin' rap music
I know how to use it, so just watch me

I'm rather suave, not finished with the pussy yet
Now turn that ass out, I wanna wax it {*smacking sounds*}
Shoot my jism embalms, I wanna tax it
Your bed? My bed -- fuck it, where's the elevator?
I set your pussy off, like a fuckin detonator bomb
Relax and be calm
Tell your friends to leave, no time for cockblockers
I hate the girls who front, and really cock-suckers
I have no time for phonies and kiddie games
A bunch of bitches with numbers and wrong names
I just chill, and cold mack at the jam

He's X-rated, I seen him in the video
He's jerkin off on my girlfriend's booty though
You want the dick too? Then come to me though
Start suckin and suckin and keep suckin
And then for hours, I keep fuckin

You think I'm braggin? Well let's go
Cock em in the air and let your other sister watch

Open your legs wider.. wider!
Let me slip my tongue deep inside ya
Rub ya up and down with strawberry Jell-o
Eat every inch, from head to toe
And make you hot, make you ? than 4th of July
The pussy was never dry
Warm and wet, uhh, and entertaining
The moves we make could never ever drain me
I fuck you hard, smooth and then rough
Like The Mack, I'm heavy like a truck
Captain Hook goes deep into the sea
And when I'm through, you're sure to believe
That I'm the master man don in the land
Cause I'm ""bad bad, and I'm wicked in de bed""
Come.. come baby, come
The time is now to be together as one

Uhh, yeah

Pumpin that ass until your back starts stingin

A Chorus Line,Critical Beatdown (Re-Issue),1986,"Ultramagnetic

Yo whassup yo
We in the Ultra lab man
We got this beat rollin man
We might as well start this Chorus Line, y'all with that?

Word up, yeah let's do this shit man
Let's get on that

Yo so how we gonna do this?  Yo..
Matter of fact, you know how we gon' do it?
Yo Tim Dog, you lead it off, aight?

Aight

We gonna, yeah we gonna get out of here man
It's on you, take it my brother

Ahhhhhhhhh , call me the hick that vicked
To lick the dick you spick, cause I'm too quick
I be appraisin, raised with the brave
I'm the headmaster and you're my slave
Metaphor master, rhymes are disaster
Have the class to, faster, call me the master
You wanna jet, project with a similie
But I'm so large I boned your girl Emily
Procrastinator, laid her, hate her, played her, sprayed her
You wanna be taught? Later
I'll control, get bold, uphold, re-fold
In tow.. cause I got so
Many dollars, scholars, holler
Girlies wanna stop and talk but I walk
Away, cause Dog don't lay
If rappers wanna play - go ride a sleigh
I'll compare and dare with a stare
You say where?  I'm over here
Metaphor physical, rhymes are artistical lyrical mircales
Difficult, to some terrifical
Hypothetically, alphabetically
Energetically, theoretically
No joke hardcore, rhymes will sting more
Dog will get more, yes yes yes y'all
I manifest protest and progress
Confess with reflex, cause I get cold sex
I can't believe how dope I am
Give me a pound, thank you ma'am
So whether you think that I'm just a myth
To rift to lift the gifts that itch the fifth
To shift the spliff that's in control to hold and fold
A bowl'll make you take and ache and fake
Whoooo.. hot damn I'm great
I'm on the Chorus Line
	It's a Chorus Line (3X)
	Yo Trev (yeah) bust your rhyme

Hold the beat, stop the beat, drop the beat
Gimme a second, to think of
The dopest lingua, lyrical interest
The metaphor better for, if and in awe
Before the score, want more then implore
The rhyme line fine, com-bine design
Redefine, intertwine
Down the line, see the sign, stop sign
Pause -- and let me enter your brain
Reachin the full circumfrence then maintain
To build, in which I equal to destroy
I'm like a twister tornado, you're just a toyboy
Made, manufactured by, Parker Brothers
You bought your rhymes, from another wholesale
Words are stale, up to bail
Cause you fail, try to trail
My certain style, words and rhythm for connecting
Dissecting, interjecting, I'm collecting
Fiends, the way it actually should be know to me
Cause that's the way it has to be done for me
Mine, and everyone else around
You're unequal to the sounds of my ratio
My strength is mental universal power
For the hour I will rain like a shower
Nucleon, cause you be on, fatal
More than able, also capable
Of takin you out without a doubt
And with clout just a sissy, a sucker girl scout
I'll rewind myself and then begin again
Strike ignite and burn, just like hydrogen
Come again, as I intend to start to end
To go beyond, means of a titan
I'm fightin, releasing my fury to cause static
And shine, the superstar, reign supreme
T.R. the Lover has got to be
Dope and def, the best that never fessed
Unless you guessed the test, a threat in chess
Never mess up for my Chorus Line
	Yo Ced, here's your rhyme

Metaphor layer, kickin it righteous
Ced Gee's the hypest, man that might just
Rip into this, rap right through this
Beat that's sweet to eat, I'm not new to this
Rappin with swing and, bein distinct man
Seein the waffle can, rap with me understand
The fact I sound def means that I'm buildin
I'm so dope I got rhymes by the million
The image maker breaker taker faker shaker
You rhyme like me, you shoulda stayed the
Hell out the industry, cause that means you're jockin me
Your sweating me, getting me, telling me, you're not ahead of me
But that's not all, I just feel that I'm better than
Cause I'm Ultra, and I'm a veteran
With rhymes, by the thous', stacks and piles
I'm a scientist, you say how
The hell can we ever trust, Ced Gee when he starts to bust
A rhyme with gale force, conducting with mega-thrust
To build or ill or kill or deal a fill the will
That make the people straight and still
To prance and dance and find romance and take the chance
To glance, while I still deal
Rhymes that's powerful, witty and logical
Mystical just to show, what I know when I go
Out, and move on the battle tip
You rhymes like , you'se a quick pick to stick
The type of hype I like to recite on - my Chorus Line
	Yeah boy it's a Chorus Line
	Aiyyo Keith (yo) you know what?
	It's your rhyme

I'm crankin up with the rhymes, brain tanks need fuel
Sunoco, diesel rhymes are locked in, turbo
Combustion attitude, gratitude, increasing altitude
Levels, but changing latitude
It's very rude when you step on my path
I laugh and giggle, smile and grin my friend
My style within - holds the righs to win
Your brain I bend, like a pound of steel
Lethal power, to me you're weasel power
I'm overloaded with tons of diesel power
Contraction, you're not ready for action
Two hundred rappers a day, I keep waxin
Buffin cleanin polishin, every act up
You wanna battle with me you must be cracked up
Stop the jokes the games you're playin
You never were sayin or payin, one bit of attention
To me my rhymes my clothes my hat my shoes
My shirt my tie, the glasses on my eye
I try, not to cry
Cause you're wack as ever, never better
Clever to pick up the mic, in any snow or rain
Whether or not you tried to scheme or dream
A beam of life, but my lyrics are bright
Like a satellite, with crystal ball knowledge
I got to college, attend to astrology, test
A million groups'll fess, I'm still the best
Kool Keith to impress
I'm like a heat ray, cookin up your brain
I like it well done, on the Chorus Line",https://genius.com/Ultramagnetic-mcs-a-chorus-line-lyrics
Kool Keith Housing Things,Critical Beatdown,1988.0,"Well I'm sonically, high bionically
For you dummies, ironically stupid
What are you, Cupid?
You steal my rhymes, and then you loop it
Wrong! Back this way
Follow me now, head this way
Into this, while I rap on through this
For many germs, who never knew this
Switch is upside down
Turn around, look in the mirror
You rap catchers are makin' a error
Every inning, I'm back to the dugout
You on the field, I'm ready to bugout
Like a manager, smackin' up your team
Male or female, ducks who dream
Of takin' me, on the mic and makin' me
Rack up, MC's I stack up
Foreign precinct rappers need to back up
Quickly, I'mma rip your brain off
Throw it down so the blood can drain off
My hands, while I wave to a fan
I'm Kool Keith, not a Bill or a Dan
But a General, equal to a mineral
Pushin' a crowd, to keep on dancin'
I'm Housing Things
{Moe Love cuts up ""Kool Keith""}

Now I'm back, to continue my verses
I'm never screamin' loud with any curses
Roughly, that a child can learn
I teach kids, and ducks that burn
With a flamethrower, and how do you show a
A grass rapper, cut him with a lawnmower
Twice, into golden wheat
Ground the rest into moldin' meat
And cook 'em, 'til they all well done
They not ready, they don't smell done
Like fish, it ain't my favorite dish
I grab a steak and a battle I wish
A Coke MC or Pepsi I'll sip up
Drop your face and bring the other lip up
Watch, while I stun and amaze you
Kick out lyrics that truly'll daze you
I'm your boss, the one that pays you
Nine to five, all ducks are hired
And when I come MC's are fired
No pay, no way today
You're unemployed with nothing to say
But I can say, one thing for sure
I'm Housing Things
{Moe Love cuts up ""Kool Keith""}

I think it's pitiful, that you had taunted me
Your girl sulkin', she wanted me first
Before you was thought about
Back in the days, when I taught about
Science, the real construction
No other solo team or production
Did that, or got with that
I play brain ball usin' a bat
To your skull, smack it out the park
I rhyme bright, and you're in the dark
With shadows, hallucinating battles
To compel, the capital K, as in Kool
Combined in Keith
Rap metal is terminal chief
Android, squashin' the beef
On time, and my mic will stay on
For any roach or germ who wanna pray on
A weakness, but my uniqueness
Has a way to show that I'm slicker
Creating rhymes, you have to be, quicker
And versatile on the microphone
I'm Kool Keith, cold Housing Things
And I'd like to say whassup to my man, Father Mashon
And also my brother Kevvy Kev, Ced Gee, Moe Love, TR
And my man I God, Paul C, Public Enemy and the Jungle Brothers
Peace, I'm outta here",https://genius.com/Ultramagnetic-mcs-kool-keith-housing-things-lyrics
Here I Go Again,New York What is Funky,UnKnown,"All 1992 flavor...
Yo, back in eighty-six it started with a song
The lyrics was bugged out, the samples strong
Different, innovative, the new school found it
A couple of years, I did the ""Criminal Minded""
LP, with KRS
Scott LaRock was dope, rest in peace, God bless
Next was Ultra, a classic found
I took my time, producin ""Critical Beatdown""
It was raw, puttin sales, in stores
The brothers today, wanna hear it even more
Than they did back then, but that was then
I didn't get the ends but I had a lot of friends
Yo fuck that!  Cause I'd rather have the papers
Ride in a Lexus, set the record straight the
Way it's supposed to be, my production is poetry
A lot use my style kid, but that doesn't bother me
Now I'ma freakin wreck shop, my shit is the tip-top
Conditioned like gold, Ced Gee and I won't stop
Breakin ground in the rap game, so here I go
Here I go, here I go again


Let's turn the page, move up to date
Gee takes you by surprise, just like fate
Our rap got soul, it was astounding
I grabbed Tim Dog, produced ""Fuck Compton""
But I backed off, the brother got greedy
So I kicked him in the nose, gave it to the needy
In Swahili, I really, saw a hillbilly
He came out with a rhyme rap the kid went platinum
Got mad airplay, brothers kept clappin
To the bank, move these soundtracks
It's quite fast, he even did hog rap
In ef-fect, a fresh pair of Timberlands
But everytime you saw the {?}
{?} you know this is a problem
Get on the mic king and please start solvin 'em

Yo yo Ced, check it out
Rage and hostility fills me
I'ma slave to the rhythm, even if it kills me
People don't know, how it feels to be sick
And tell them suckers bullshit lyrics they kick, I slit your wrists
It's danger, and now degrees slappin up foreign MC's
A track ain't nothin to rip
It's done just like this but not just as quick
The madness, when I start to flip
Is blowin the joint, my style, my voice
Destroys, {?} stalks ya
My style of hip-hop is unorthodox
As I rock the spot, razzamatazz for your ass
Flash past, outlast and surpass
Almighty Allah blessed me, so I'm gettin cash
Major rappers with posse, suckers can't stop me
Okay just say rap was a house see
I huff and puff, and blow the house down
I'm sound as I, design the sound
When I'm in your town, nobody's around
Lettin mics smoke like herb (here we go again)",https://genius.com/Ultramagnetic-mcs-here-i-go-again-lyrics
Bust the Facts,Funk Your Head Up,1992,"A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
You're listening to the sounds of the best MC in the world, Kool Keith
I got a flyer in my hand, Bambaataa with Cold Crush
The place is packed, with Johnny Wa and Rayvon
Lovely ladies smelling sweet with a lot of Avon
Jazzy Jay by my side, Charlie Chase behind me
Flash and Theodore, super cuts sublime me
""Catch a Groove"" is the rhythm, spinning back and forth
From the East and the Valley, swinging back up North
Towards the South Bronx, to Cedar Park and Webster
The speakers are pumping, power bass is thumping
With the Ultra mega amp, keeping pep up jumping
From side to side, the double meters have peaked
They had some good MC's, a lot of them they was weak
They had no style with no metaphor, no voice to speak
Melle Mel had the best rhymes, ranking with Caz
Kool Moe tried to get down, but I made him sit down
With that metaphor quickness, you bite and you bit this
Stop and go turn, see the flame and go burn
To ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Seven years later toy you still crusty crust
Your old rhymes are rust, very dirty and dusty
And under your arms you're kicking power and musty
Get out of my way, and let the rhythm path roll
Let me run up the charts, freak a rhyme turn gold
While you're listening, I throw a buzz in your ear
Bust the facts!
Go swing a partner around, dosey-dosey
Like musical chairs and ring around the rosie
The party you pay see, Kool Herc with Jay Cee
The Herculoids
 battle, 
The Disco Twins
Funky rhymes with breakbeats, the DJ spins
For the 
L Brothers
, stepping right in the scene
Mean Gene
 was maxing, Rockin Rob went to work
While the tables would turn, the old needles used to jerk
With the belt drive, 
Technics and B-1's
With the orange light shining, the 
red on D-1's
Direct drive
 and Nova, I'm chilling with G.L.O.B.E
Mr. Biggs and Pow-Wow, Monk and Superman
Pulling out that 
Olde E
, that funky funky 40 ounce
Ikey C from Cosmic, the bass bottom bounce
Red Alert
 in the booth, the 
T-Connection
 to mix
Silly rabbit.. you know my style has tricks
To go on, to the next line, to the break of dawn
While I move up step, to the early early morn
With a hip-hop drink and some rhyme popcorn
Never smoking or sniffing or ever joking or riffing
Because it's time to plex more, and rhyme fantastic
Dota-Rock
 and 
Whipper Whip
, neither rapper was plastic
Back in the days, you had to be so sarcastic
To stretch out a rhyme, and make it double elastic
You learn new jack, step back and be wack
You know what time it is boy, and every mic I smoke
Bust the facts!
Later on at the Boys Club, while time excel
I got a name for your brain that surely rings a bell
Patti Duke had the nice hands, swift with Billy Boy
Playing James Brown records, you stupid you silly boy
Bongo Rocking
, hard where the rhythm go
You fake and pass, 
Busy Bee
 give and go
To the 
AJ Skratch
, a funky beat that matched
With a two-second break, that was hard to catch
DST
 was mixing, slicing with his elbows
Freaking the wheels, looping rhymes, here we go
To the master faster, speed up and go faster
Turn my JVC to mega power and blast a
Mario tape, yes The Disco King
Where the beats had the funky drums, no new jack swing
Happy rappers with polka dots, were bound to get stuck
You had the Zulus the Nine Crew, you're pushing your luck
The Casanovas was maxing all scheming to duck
You had The Black Spades, plus The Savage Skulls
Gangbanging was over, neither crews exist
They got a job and a wife, a pretty woman to kiss
So on the rhymes kept rolling, straight up into disco
Eddie Cheeba
 with Sweet G, and back up to Cisco
Afrika Islam, with the Great Love Squids
Spinning high-top beats, can you check it, you dig
Kool Keith out smoking, my lyrics are hot

Raise It Up,The Four Horsemen,1993.0,"Yeah... yo Don, gimme a little bit of that chicken
That smooth chicken, a little bit of that gravy
And I want some... old hot jazz biscuits
With a little bit of that blues butter
Bring in the snare

They never understood, many people were so slow
My funky type of rhyme and my style is psycho
Complex wrecks wrecks, my style go X-X
I move around offbeat, creating more styles
Showin' white boys, other kids my black styles
I kick lyrics like shoes right in your face
Walk up on a carJack of Spades, pluck the ace
I get slow-er, down in, on in
Flowin' like I used to be on Critical Beatdown
I drop styles on ears the public bite 'em
Not many went to school, so the dummies wouldn't write 'em
They say yo Keith, you Kool, you usin' big words
I went to college, I'm even more stupid, herb
Back on the scene to put a lesson out
Even if I have to pull a black Smith and Wesson out
I grab a hammer stick a nail in that little crack
Tame the monkey show the hummingbird how to act
I go atomic, hypo-galactical
Word to mom I'm in my own world
Galaxy rays! Powerful

Raise it up (8X)

Yo, yo money grip money grip, now this ain't no ego trip
Yo money grip money grip, now this ain't no ego trip
Now back in the days and we used to use elevation
And then the people said ""What's up, with Ultramagnetic?
Yo they sound kind of crazy, Kool Keith is a psycho
Ced G is a scientist, the lyrics are hyper""
Creating a fusion, of sampling hits
We all came down just to be distinctive
Some rappers complex, but they can't see the music
We show orchestration, and with funky prevention
It was different and black, and it caused devastation
Gotta new bag, signed a deal with Wild Pitch
Now we're back on the street, with the flavor you missed
So get with the program, Ultra hot off your real high
I know I'm a real pro, like Michigan Fab Five
Runnin' and shootin', for me alley-oopin'
Is makin' an album, with big distribution
Promote it and hype it, make up posters then snipe it
Raise it up!

Ladies and gentlemen, live from Flatbush Brooklyn
I bring to you tonight, the Godfather Don
From the Office...

Lookin' down the barrel of a gun is no fun
So for some, I rum-pum-pum and flip, like a tongue
Of young dragon, with the force and ten sacks of buddah
To wax a crew of jacks and looters, even your ho I shoot her
In the face, with the mother-uffin bass
Now taste the venom of the ish that I sent 'em
And foes, that doze, I chew 'em like gristle
Wipe my mouth with tissue, there's no issue
I'm first print, mint, check the wizard
The force of my blast, blow 'em like a Tec in a blizzard
Now what is it? Exquisite physics to stain your brain
When they visit cardiovascular masterer, words are massacred damn
I got beats rhymes tanks gats includin' Ultra
Check the loop, snoop low we do ya like a vulture
Back in the days, there was just beef and knuckles
Nowadays, a beatdown consists of some clips
My oowop, rips with abandon at random
Whiff, you be ghost, like Michael Landon
When I bust amazing nuts you play the cut

I gotta tell ya, sweet and I can smell ya
Mmmm, what you wearin, Liz Claiborne?
Giorgio, or that other stuff Avon?
You walk away, but love, I still follow you
And if I had a chance, I may swallow you

Juicy Fruit, I'm a real live brother

Girl I like your style, the way you wear your smile
	I like your style
Everytime I get with you you seem to blow my mind
	I like your style

Yo listen baby
It takes more than a boomin system
To turn my head, make me flip and listen
You gotta know how to walk, you gotta know how to talk
You gotta know how to stand, you gotta know how to smile
You gotta know how to wiggle, you gotta know how to move
Just to catch my attention
Now after that you gotta have a personality
I'm talkin class, not a skeezer's mentality
Know when to wear your jeans, how to wear your jeans
And where to tear your jeans, and when to keep the jeans
Hangin in the closet
And when it's time to wear a fly silk dress
You wear it well - I like your style

You cold mack at the clubs with your girlfriends
You ain't lookin for games or no boyfriends
A kid tryin to kick the dil-deally line
A fake rap or two, a hillbilly line
I get smooth and offer you a big drink
I like the way, you're pumpin in hot pink
Italian, black, you could be Puerto Rican
Yo give me your number, I'ma call you on the weekend
You got a head on your shoulders, plus I like that
You ain't no dummy no fool, I still like that

Ah fuck it, I'm like Steve the Wildman
Fuck the bitch that has no style man

Everywhere I go, you follow where I walk
On Madison, I pull a ho with my gold voice
And show her my mansion, my custom Rolls Royce
I'm large, let me call up the President
Or Michael Jackson, or Frank Sinatra
With two hundred million dollars, baby I got ya
A hot dog, now take a Coke and a frank
And if you think I'm a fool, what the fuck do you think that
You thought like Nellie, with a big belly
Walking around smelling pissy and smelly
Giving it all you got, trying to work and jerk
Flirt, berserk, you ain't fly
Because a fly has wings, and I'll swat 'em
Urinate on 'em and warn 'em twice to step to the next man
You got that problem from your ex-man
Billy Joe, Pickle Peter and Bob
I'm not a scrambler, a pickpocket, a thief
I just max at Hunt's Point, and clock on the East
Smack my bitch up


See that's all you had to do, Ced
That's all you gotta do, I'm telling you, word

So it's that easy? Yo I kinda know what you talking about, Keith
I think I do, but uh, bust this
And sum it up with just one verse, {?} Ultra
Just listen, listen, listen!

So if a bitch try to play me like a dum dum
All she'll get is a face full of cum cum
Cum cum's sticky, wet and drippy
A face full of hickies, she'll never kiss me
Cause when you try to jerk me, you lose
I haven't got time for that so I choose
To get a quick nut, wearing a jimmy hat
Charge you a fee cause Ced Gee is a mega mack
Gamma pimping the bitches who haven't got
A clue how to live when you treat 'em right from the start
So bust this, trust this, justice
If the bitch ain't shit you must get
Even like me, cut her off or train her right
If you can choose, you must whip her every night
All jokes aside, Ced Gee, I'm not having this
I got no time for games, I'd rather get
Money and money, and then more money
Ced Gee ain't no dummy, and you'll never run me
I'mma shoot the gift, cut the riff, a girl ain't legit?
I'mma smack the bitch


Yeah, that's what you had to do, that's all you had to do, man
That'll relieve a lot of the problem
You had to smack the bitch

Yo man, you's a sick brother man, you know
That's how I feel, but you know what?
I like this smacking the bitch thing
You know what, why don't you tell me some more about this

Now let me see now, how much I got in my stash?
One million, 20 million, 30 million, 40 million
Hmm, I'll never marry an ass
Fuck it, let's take a ride on the cruise
Go out to Puerto Rico and drink some booze
Quatorze, freaky dominant chocha
With all the spanish rice and beans from Goya
I'm chilling, like the motherfucking mack and
Furs and diamonds, the bundles I'm packing
Small to large, I'm coming so gigantic
Sailing across, stepping down the Atlantic
A mega-pimp, pushing hoes like records
Up and down, side to side, North and South
East to West, coming out fresh, like I'm oxygen
Now you see who rocks again
Time and time I gotta circle the blocks again
Pick up the bitch with the heavier cash flow
Stop and go, keep my bank and my stash though
Rhymes to move on, flowing to Hollywood
Shake up the boulevard, and then they say how you could
Pull up in eight cars, a truck and a bus
""You must be crazy, man!"" (Hey, you fucking with us?)
Going mega-pimp, hanging out with the government
Paying my taxes, and thinking intelligent
For the upscale, 20 billion a day
Smack my bitch up",https://genius.com/Ultramagnetic-mcs-smack-my-bitch-up-lyrics
Ain’t it Good to You,Critical Beatdown,1988.0,"I'm like Kato, my rhyme's the Green Hornet
You know you want it, rappers get up on it
I flaunt it, throughout the metro-politan
The world's my area
Dance interior, fresh interior decorated
A painted wall with rhymes
That glow and show the biter slow reciter
Up who mighta tried to copy this style
Or change their ways, to wonder if you can
Take me out, on the microphone
I'm strong like Benzine, I kill a fiend
Rhymes in my tank, brains pumpin gasoline
Out, I use Exxon
And any rappers wack, my mind checks on
Meters and gauges, crankin up lyrical engines
Now I'm ready to roll
On you and him, your whole crew
Let's film it, now take two
Watch the movie, your brain will be the star
Thoughtless, when I take you far
To the galaxy, and leave your domepiece
In the hemisphere, now you're lost on Jupiter
Your brain revolves around, you get stupider
Tryin to think, where you're goin
On other planets, rhymes are flowin
Through the Milky Way, quicker than warp speed
Brains I feed with heatable rays
Ain't it good to you?

I'm a wise man, prophet of the bible
You wanna try me, then I'm liable
To go and flow and show, don't you know
Edgar Allan Poe, could not write like this
Mysteries, with a twist
And I insist, to uplift my metaphor
Slice dice and write, and make the brain sore
For, you and him
I kill a rapper, then begin
To wrote and smoke you're chokin then provoke
The joke the most, and walk around like notes
Programmed, you're equal to a dummy
Them want rhyme? You do summies
Backwards, forwards, sideways
Anyway, I say hold it
Now you're in space, plus you're folded
Up, like molecules of matter
Plus you scatter, you wish you had a
Chance to shake, recuperate, recreate
The brain cells, I have ate
Scraped, soak em in solutions
Like Benzine, iodine producin
Student of Cee's, tryin to be, just like me
Ced Gee, the Ultramagnetic
A scientist, skilled with knowledge
Once a God, years of college
Accumulated, my wisdom and wit
Thoughts float, ideas are legit
To fit, the rhythm of the tempo
Also, the music more so
Have to move groove soothe and lose you
Now ain't it good to you?

Once again my rhyme blows up enemies
Wack MC's, across the nation on rotation
You get the hype at the station
Promotion, I put your brain in slow motion
Like lotion, and let it float in the ocean
Then I drown it, your brain begins to bubble
I bring trouble, hang with Barney Rubble
In Bedrock, and watch another head rock
Go through West to Washington and Ced block
The Avenue, passin you, bashin you
In your face, rhymes are crashin you
On the chrome dome, swellin your Astrodome
You're in an ambulance, I'm takin you home
To complete the ways I'm on a mission
I see your balls of clay with x-vision
I'm a scientist, your satellites are weak
They get dimmer every time I speak
On my gyroscope you hope to seek the style
That copacetically, bugs you out
On the mic, Kool Keith in a spaceship
Risin, not followin, plexin
Muscle flexin, lyrics for connection
Rhyme injection, rhythm perfection
Brain selection, has protection
My reflection, shines
Triple times your eye, invisible
I get by your brain
Now ain't it good to you?

Aiyyo Keith, how you say?
Just another Boogie Down Bronx Ultramagnetic sure shot
Done at the Ultra lab of course
Mixed at D&D with my man Andy

Ladies screamin' and creamin', 'cause I'm comin' with Adam
Hi-tech apex, orgasm they have 'em
Most times multiple, in different dimensions
Activate rides, now I'm ready to enter
I see big proton, gaze through your galaxy
It's gaining momentum, you're having a fit

The walls of the spaceship, transport to receptacles

Lieutenant Uhura.. Captain Kirk has nothing to do with you

Supersonic, primitive, riding on the BOOTY
Take 'em on down to level four, sequence
Cowboys check the funk measurement, station
Floating with time, verdict one, affirmative
Insert eight into a cervix, incredible
Over combined between sheets, a nucleus
Get in a square, open uterus, BLOSSOM
Hidden away, see a side effect's intercourse
Floating in space with Captain Kirk

Word up I like that, one more time, one more time
""You've got the feelin""
Aight yo Keith, bust this, tell em how you REALLY feel

Now here's a funky beat, my rhyme is updated
For soft ducks, I played it once
A biter jumped on it
Girls got stupid, freaks humped on it
And from the back, I pumped on it
Mostly, with skill, top finesse
East to West, but I guess, I'm right
While others are wrong
Tryin to teach, and usin my song
Along, with your wiggedy-wack
Stay back, get back, sit back down
And think about it, whenever you're dissin me
You are the roach, the six legs wishin me
And pushin me, steadily on
Metaphor, better for, psychin more
On my tour, brains are sore
I'll be sure, I'm fresher
So tell me how I (feel about ya)
Ducks, wack rappers around
In town, never wearin no boots
Toy Ballys, sharkskin suits
With a story, and through his auditory
Canal Street, is my territory
For gold glory, reachin my hand out
Smack rappers, and makin em stand outside
Waitin for me, to tell them, my secret style
And show them, how it really is done
My son, now I'm back to you
And if you're bad I'll smack you through
A glass of rhymes, shattering
Now you're cut up, say what up?
Shut up, 'cause I'm feelin' it
 Yo that was dope!

 Yeah word up, bust this
Man I'mma do this
""You've got the feelin""
I might as well go do this right?
 Definitely man
 Aight, do it

Hello! I'm back again
It's Ced Gee, the champion
Of knowledge and wisdom over all topics
I'm the chief, the general prophet
Topping, all the ducks who are delirious
About rhymin, I'm more serious
Like this, with twists as changes
I took time, and rearranged this
Style like how versatile you ask me now wow
I'm like Ching Ching Chow
The movie, you seen on TV
I'll be numerous, but believe me
I'll chop you up, bash your brain, rotate your liver
Then I'm gonna give ya, a fresh rhyme, made
Sealed and delivered, by me
The manufacturer
Straight out of Attica, I come after ya
And if ya run, I have to damage ya
Mentally, by using my mind
Choosing adjectives hard to define
In rhymes, a dictionary word feast
From the Brainiac, I blew your dome piece
Open, hopin you'll say to me
""That was dope,"" like an anatomy
Operation on the turntables
Slicing nerds with verbs, fully enabled
Equipped, with a white handkerchief
To wipe away the germs who wanna hang with this
Ultra smoke a dope man, no joke-uh
With the lines I wrote, and I quote-uh
'Cause I'm feelin' it!
""You've got the feeling""

Funky,Critical Beatdown (Re-Issue),1987.0,"I brought a band, Sam is on trombone
He's blowin' hard, back-to-back notes, get with it
Take off your coat, meditate, let your brain compel
Just think as the beat excels to your eardrums
Cause cells to numb and freeze while I break off at ease
Real smooth, combined the piano
My voice nasal, no soprano is needed
To get overheated and burn while the Technics' turn
For the U-L, the T, the R-uh-A
You got a copy? Watch the record play
Bite more...spin it every day
You wake up and try to make up a rhyme that fear me
But let me tell you straight, I know you hear me
And when I'm on the stage you just cheer me up another level
Down below I'm throwin' with the Devil in a cage
I'm on the rampage, you need a number? Wanna know my age?
Psyche! I carry a Magnum
Other groups - I only will rag them, and wait
While you debate I hesitate, observe your wack styles
You been rappin', talkin' for miles about nothin'
Cos you don't amaze me, I'm like a game, everyone plays me
Regular, extended to the bonus, for some of you
I think you should've known this was funky...

Understand the sounds you're listenin'
It's a band, with nitroglycerin
One with horns and trumpets, I've really pumped this
Track up cos I knew I must get you to dance across the floor
Plus give myself more of this beat, then teach
All of you how to really reach your peak
And don't have a seat, cos while the bass hits harder
My snare drum's never weak, hi-hats used real funky
You get freaky, weakly groovin' to the beat real neatly
So try to devote your-self to Ultra-Magnetic
Pick up my sculptured phonograph copy
It's not sloppy, ax your girl, she called me Poppy
That was Ceddie, not Eddie, I'm ready
I'm not confetti, nor spaghetti
But instead I'm great because I create
The lyrics that match the pitch of my bass
Kick drum, SynDrum, no hi-hats are needed
While Ced Gee gets overheated
And rough as I switch to matter in which
Combined with rhythm I can't miss
Yo, this track is funky, man...",https://genius.com/Ultramagnetic-mcs-funky-lyrics
Pluckin Cards,Funk Your Head Up,1992,"That's why you were hired
And i'll kill anyone, who dares go against me!
It doesn't take long for the nightmarish news
To sweep the world like a shockwave
The mighty Man of Steel, once the superchampion, admired by billions
Has proclaimed himself a wildman
Afraid of going on an uncontrollable rampage at any moment

Hey yo stupid, you thought I was over
Living like Oscar, Big Bird and Grover
I'm the X the man the first challenger
I keep rhymes in place like Bob Gallagher
Fittin, and in the chair I'm sittin
Rappers know I'm Kool, rappers know I'm Keith
Like 
Charlie Brown, good grief
I see rappers I know they turned African
I just pedal my bike, then I laugh again
I pull the girls with thread and one string
They say I'm steppin to them for one thing
But I don't think so, you think so, really?
Tapes is wack and new MC's sound silly
I hate to criticize, I have a problem
In this school wack rappers I'll solve them
They wanna be like Ultra on the jizz-ock
Try to act like they not but on the cizz-ock
Suckin, takin, aw-ll be slurpin
Comical bums your wack jams ain't workin
You ain't got the style to rock no man
You get a pound from me, but with no hand
Diss em, I'm not the one Miss Ferguson
Cold stupid as hell like George Jefferson
Yeah, you dummies better be careful
I pick up rappers and throw away a handful
Yes... I'm
Pluckin everyone's card

Behind those glasses I know who you are
You 
Racer X

his brother's speed
You 
dissin James
? 
He's chicken feed
He can't rap or clap or make a feet tap
How bout 
Monie
 and 
Nikki
 
they both bullcrap
I see light in my lamp, but not on the mic
How could I diss myself in front of Dolemite
You wanna preach and teach and be a rebel
Then underline disguise and be the devil
Call yourself God, can you make it rain
Can you tell me how or what I'm thinkin in my brain
I'm not the bighead kid who wanna show off
I just pick up the mic and then I blow off
Dirt, crumbs, any type of feather
You ain't genuine, toyin real leather
Pleather, coming out in the weather
You rap on R&B tracks and whatever
Hi Uncle Tom, go head entertain
Dance and get sweaty, and let me use my brain
I think twice about the big bow tie
You wearin one? I wanna know why
I see fools all dressed in tuxedos
And at the Grammy's, a bag of Fritos
Dumb people wonder, dumb people think
Just to be large, do they have to wear a mink
Drive a Cadillac, drive a Benzo
A Rolls Royce with a funky Testarosso
I'd rather stay in New York and not Hollywood
Fool, I'm
Pluckin everyone's card 
(repeat 4x)
You takin off and you're gold and for what?
Because you wanna be down and so what?
You buy your African beads from Koreans
Africans, you walkin by human beings
You don't know, you're so stupid
Take the books you read you're still stupid
Learn, see the rappers I burn
You're coming next, it's your turn
Let me sprinkle 
Salt, let me sprinkle Pepa
On doo-doo, and whatever
You wanna speak on the X, then let's go with this
I know I'm talented, good, and such a pro at this
Trade, skill, future my job
And at lunch I eat a rap shishkabob
You wanna spin with the real and make a big deal
Yes, you're in the showcase showdown
I hope you're ready to rock and come blow down
Huff, and puff, like the big bad wolf
I'm not the man concerned with that story
Look out, watch, you're 
Three Feet and Sinkin
The Tribe's are lost
 and everyone's breath stinkin

Look at one man carry many loads
I gotta move enlighten a sleepy world
Remember, I'm
Pluckin everyone's card 
Pluckin everyone's card 
(yell at the top of my lungs)

Hahahahaha, you can't even focus the energies of your own body
How can you hope to topple the God of War, against his will?

Of fifty-five million, eight-thousand nine
""Rebel base...rebel base""
 Like this!

I got a radio, small and yet portable
Comfortable, with the sound in audio
Kickin, high hats just tickin
Spicy lyrics, and words finger lickin good
But you know I could
Beat on steel, break tons of wood down
With a funky sound
Square mixer, the record is round
And turning, for the million I'm earning
Shock the rhythm, and just keep learning
This, that is supposed to
Grab your ear, and have it move close
To the speakers, so you hear me clearly
I'm out yes, to damage severely
You're very far, and not yet nearly
Expressing them, but you're messing them up
Your bummy rhymes, I'm dressing them up
For the battle win, like a snake I'm rattlin
The red ball with the wooden piece paddlin
MC's, stop the perpetrating
And step off, release the mic and Break North

Computer rapper for ducks who wanna bite em
Stand back, watch the man recite em
It took a minute a second for me to write em
And type em and hype em and psych em, up
Change my rhythm, before I get stuck
In an altitude, beyond my own level
I smack rappers and send em to the devil
On a bus, return em to dust
I start infections, reduce em to pus
I'm known as scanner, and brains I blow out
To old bones, and skulls I throw out
To the backyard, and yes the wackyard
You need a pipe, there's the old crackyard
Your last stop, it has to be the graveyard
Peakin, Ced Gee I'm speakin
I smell smoke, my tonsils are leakin
Words, in the right direction
Add the beats with the lyrics perfection
Stompin, the bass and highs, Break North

Well I'm rocked, like a chain to a link
I wear black while suckers wear pink

I break domes, and speak in the raw

I chop rappers, and throw em in the river
Tastin, as I swallow your liver
Here's your brain for your girl I can give her
Messages, clues from a murderer
And if she's ugly, I never even heard of her
Telling, bugging detectives
I wear a bag, four contraceptives
And aluminum, wrapped in all foil
I play a game, slick to be oil
For the other roaches, MC's I boil
And roast, mega degrees
I swarm around with a thousand of bees
Absorb earth and the honey from trees
I'm the King Bee, my girl's the Queen Bee
And when you're stung, you never even seen me

Eliminating, another predator
From the face, of the Earth
Not the first to feel the wrath, of my curse
Competing, just like David and Goliath
My rhyme's a slingshot, and yes they triumph
Over the weak, minds, who claim they giants
I'm more defiant, while you're relyin
On, your weak rhymin with connectors
But I'm Ced Gee, the rhymin inspector
Delta Force, number one, Omega Supreme soundwave
Bringing your dreams to reality
And by the formality of thoughts
Yes, atomic of course
You steppin to me, you take a loss
Radical, the replication of a quasar
A pulsar, immense to suplicate
Crush a germ, then further eradicate
Destroy, which means to eliminate
Wipeout, remove, erase, and annhilate
Suckers, crews to soloists
You need a barricade, my rhyme's a hand grenade
Blowing up your brain, techniques astonishing
Just like EnDust, my rhymes are polishing
Rappers, cause to me you're like furniture
Dusty old and gray, and I'ma cleanse your soul
Rap to take control
I'm Ced Gee, and I'm on a roll
My name's the Delta
""Ced Gee, a champion""
""Ced Gee, a champion""
Back to take control as I begin
To rip this mic apart, from end to end
Combine the rhyme that's mines to make em blend
Produce a beat that's dope
I hope you smoke the dope I wrote I quote
I made your brain choke - you need an antidote
Of, rhymes, just like funky potions
It killed your membranes, so now you're hopin
That you can become, another intellect
But you're a dummy, your rhymes can't connect
Metaphors, 'cause your style is very basic
You leave traces, you have no aces
Jacks, Kings or Queens, or even deuces
I'm like Spades, you can't renege this
Ultramagnetic style of rhythm
Brain combustion is what I give em
To make them shake and hesitate and make mistakes
To stay awake cause the Gee stands for Great
Man, reachin my apex
The more I climb, some rappers hate that
Twist and change the way I rearrange their brains
'Cause I'm the Delta
""Ced Gee, a champion""
""Ced Gee, a champion""
""Ced Gee.. a champion""",https://genius.com/Ultramagnetic-mcs-ced-gee-delta-force-one-lyrics
"Two Brothers with Checks (San Francisco, Harvey)",The Four Horsemen,1993.0,"Yeah this is a story about two brothers with big big checks
And pretty white Cadillacs; and they was fly from the South
So check it out..

My wicky wicky style is unbearable for this world and the planet boy
I swing at the store, buy a lunch, play LaCroix
Supercat chasin rats, with chemicals at the bottom
I'm givin gold with enzymes, connections I got em
One thing, two things, like Father Mulcahy
Recto and Smekto, go get my boy Luce (LET'S GO!)
Let's see Babe Grim and his exoskeleton
He's pitchin a fastball, you swing and you miss
But seven times away clown, you're smellin the piss
Drippin offa your forehead, rollin down to New Mexico
You're caught in a bid troop, you thought you was flexible
X-able, 
Montreal Expos
Hypodermic you turn it, you pick it up and you learn it
Now you're chillin with zinc as it kicks with the sodium
Pele came down just to sign some autographs
He laughed and he left, 
went to El Segundo
For cheese and some bacon 
my Philadelphia steak-umm
I got a hole in my pants, I said, ""
Asalaam alaikum
""
Got a new jacket was breakin out to the trainin camp
I danced and danced and danced and danced
And danced and danced and danced.. then I sat on the toilet!
Wrote a rhyme and then ordered, now I'm spinnin and winnin
Got the girlies up on it, 'cause I'm kickin and stickin
Finger-poppin and lickin, can you do me a favor
Can you go get the chicken—as you see we're a legion
When we roll we're just easin', up to Egypt and Pakistan
There's never no treason, 'cause we're—""treated with respect""

Two brothers with check, yo, that Caddy is fly
San Francisco, Harvey
Two brothers with check, yo, that Caddy is fly
San Francisco, Harvey
Two brothers with check, yo, that Caddy is fly
San Francisco, Harvey

Drivin' from Cooperstown, swingin' like Don Hahn
Rhythm X in the batter's box
Thurman like Munson, left while I swing right
And change courses and dialogue
Regional Atlanta, Alabama Savannah
I kick a rhyme like a ball to Indiana
Missouri, Kentucky, like 
Dent, call me Bucky
Rogers I'm nice, I float in space wild
Dr. Smith
, I'm dope, yo watch Sparky Lyle
As I throwback a spitball, my slider and check back
The stadium's packed rope, the people should get back
And walk to the plate, yo Jerry Grote, pause
Swing swing swipe! I get MC's on my third strike
My hot dog is done, I'm in the dugout, check it
I know I wreck shop, tip-top, heads bop, heads drop
And many rappers get senile
Back to the plate, see the catcher, pitcher
You in the audience man, you be the fan
Like 
Supercat, Don Don Dada
I play the field in New York, and hit Jamaica
Like Giants I roll like San Francisco, Harvey
No time for rats with cats in Bristol playin
I'm makin moves.. yo man..

Two brothers with check, yo, that Caddy is fly
San Francisco, Harvey
Two brothers with check, yo, that Caddy is fly
San Francisco, Harvey
Two brothers with check, yo, that Caddy is fly

Two brothers with check, yo, that Caddy is fly

Cashin them checks up at the Chemical
We might cash em in Oakland, San Francisco whatever
Pick up honies in Cleveland, with the game so damn clever
As I roll like I'm Charlie Hough, kickin that ball down
The crowd is wild, need the gas for a mile
So let's roll out and catch em, fire points by the parrish
Make a record like this, as we drive through the city

Your MC Champions, Ultramagnetic

It's flaming!
I am sealing off the dimensional window
Closing the hole in the fabric of the cosmos like a scar

Ah yeah
One two, one two
This is Agent Bless Ced Gee
Ultramagnetics in full effect
We in here dropping freestyle rhymes like MC Champions
So Keith, take it away

Power compactor, brain distractor
Dropping a bomb right in your anal connector
Sector, vector, the lyric inspector
X-Ray vision, power perfector
Lecktor, Megator, Igor
Ah yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
The rhythm the drop the hit the top to make ya swing or pop
As I flow, pick up the micro-
Phone get hypotension is original
Lyrical miracle, back to attack one
Black one, white one, green one or blue one
Colorful street rhymes, I'm back to do one
Or two of you, three of you, or four of you
Five or six or seven, eleven of you
Wack MCs get back in the last line
And wait on the mic, you think I'm ready to pass mine
Up in the roach hand, with clever ability
I know when to sting a brain, just like I'm a killer bee
Hitting em hard with the rhyme as the flame grow
Hardcore, softcore, and even the rainbow
Polka-dot MC's, African, Indian
Spanish-American, mixed with Panamanian
Arabian Nubian, speaking Siberian
Japanese, Chinese, and regular MCs
Preachers, teachers, and negative creatures
I roll and kick a rhyme, you grab your mic back
Sidewind and rattle like a snake I strike back
I chew your brain and, the monkey behind you
Your company management, the dummy who signed you
To pick up the slack but the hype ain't selling many
Records and tapes cause your rap ain't telling any
Metaphor phases, think that amazes
Me, the next man, no biter but innovator
With lyrical instinct, you look like a duplicator
Bite my style, nibbling on the big jock
With rhymes so tight, they keep your brain in a headlock
Count the one two three four five
I'm like The Bushwhackers tag-teaming your dome
I'm just a champion

Ah yeah, yo Keith, bust this
I got some freestyle rhymes too
I'mma warm up, then I'mma get deep
Bust it, check this out
Yo, poetic genius, kicking metaphor
Ced Gee is the big boss, making it better for
A pile of them, MCs again, I'm ragging them
So listen up my friend
I'm rapping to manifest, people so blind I guess
Type of hype I select, when I rap come correct
My mic is on, and it's loaded, and it's lethal
Here's a dose, a taste of my potential
My super menu winds you bends you sends you
To watch a brother like me, continue
Out on the warpath, flashback, sit back
Kick back with that, dope rap attack
Those that can't rap, with that weak rap
Need to get back, and just to add to that
Fact, with words from the knowledge tip
My rhymes are swift, I have the gift
Like hocus-pocus, Ced Gee, and I'm still on
My mic is loaded with rhymes that flame on
Now you know just what I am creating
We call it mega funk, a plan stating
I'm verbally passing, rhymes are outlasting
Waxing and smashing and kicking more ass and
With intensity, Ced Gee has got to be
Schooling the wannabes, rappers who try to be
Like me, C-E-D
To flow on the mic and show no mercy
I'm a champion, I'm undefeated
My rep is strong, no hype is ever needed
To grow and grow, to grow and grow
To grow and grow, and grow and grow
To grow and grow, and grow and grow
Rap taller than Buckwheat's afro

Checkin my style, return to zero
Checkin my style, return to zero

Mik-make my flows, show a rapper what I give them
Don't 
flex funky
 yo, kick it honey step back
Watch when I come, you scratch that kitty-kat on top of that
Rappers know I'm X, slow down, watch me get stupid open
Dance for the ladies, I strip in Chippendale's
Funky hypo, or technical, lyrics make computer
With a brain that spins like Kid Capri, 33
Drop a 45 down just like the first record rotate
My style, my rhyme, my game is droppin doo-doo lyrics
Make a brother say, ""Keith is out? Damn, I wanna hear it""
Buy a copy tomorrow, kick his old tape
Take it back two times to smack his girl, let him go
Tell his uncle brother aunt and Cousin Belle (Ding-Dong!)
As I rock so well, spanki'n tail, check the beats
My style is so early, you couldn't catch it on 
Bobbito
As I flaunt and I stretch
 just like a rubber band—poppin'!
Stoppin every rapper like a trooper on a turnpike
I'm long and strong and just like the Lincoln Tunnel
'Father, big up, check it out
Back back, I switch switch, I check check, I know that
Bored as I kick up, you proud of me you know it's me
I got more muscle to flex to show than Jodeci
Take off them panties, I turn Boyz II Men

The right way, not the wrong way
Watch me when I do this, pay attention
Check it out
Shut up! Step back! That picky-packy-wacky rap
Your old flow is over and your rhyme style is over with
In fact, dickhead, yo take it as a bigger diss
I come walk in your show like David Berkowitz
Make you think you swimmin' like that homie Mark Spitz
How can you put up a fox, against an ALLIGATOR
I chew your crew one by one, like a Now or Later
I make a heavy man light, turn a black kid white
Bust a rhyme in they rectum, squeeze it tight
I wreck shop like Rock the Ricky Wrecka
Crush-a, stomp-a, 'nother, brother
I make MC's go, ""Heyy ho heyy ho""
Look at me now, whassup? HEY JOE!
You say you bad but good, but soft as oakwood
Perpetratin' wild when you're comin' from NO hood
I wipe your style like doo doo, when I beat ya
Treat ya like an old Bible rhyme in schoolteacher
Like my son, did your mother tell you?
Pee pee's on the rise, why the X gotta smell you?
You know me, I know you, you droppin' lyrics
On the record that's spinnin' that smell like doo doo, yo get back
I rock styles on top, another Funky child
I kick a rhyme so swift, and make your girl smile
You better go off and think, 'cause I'm your father
Yo black, go back, step back, you're wack (5X)
Check it! One two, you don't wanna step to
Crazy psycho patient from the Bronx, comin' at you
I get hyper and deep, funky freaky flex
Bust my style, get wild, flow like Rhythm X
People know they wack, in fact, I'm comin' back black
Bustin' stupid styles on you clowns with the maps out
You say you good with the mic, man I wonder why
You think I'm sleepin'? Pajamas on, beddy-bye
Rappers on my D-head, quick to stick in New York
Everywhere I go ho, never ridin' I walk
You think you fly and don't try, yo lick the penis B
I ride around to Mars, and go to Venus see
Take you on a trip and make you bug out, freak out
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday whole week out
Check it, watch it, back up, slow down
The same way you blow up, I make a rapper bow down
I make you quit rap, and try to get with Bobby Brown
Slide and glide, Boogie Down like James Brown
Never will I say I, watch me when I do that
When I grab the mic and rock, watch them say ""Who dat?""
I know my tongue is long, just like a lizard
Can you drop the mic - respect the funk wizard
I know you breakin' your neck, to hear the X stuff
Back to burn, yo Sam, yo ain't the X rough
I look at millions of groups and tell 'em get back
Yo black, go back, step back, you're wack (4X)
Third rhyme, see who rock and move and spread the rumors
You rappers been played like suede Puma's, yo bust it
I kick a style so rugged, they're makin' hoes wet
Change they panties and bras, and make a dollar bet
Never will I stop it, got the target on your anus
Your preschool style, kindergarten not the same as
I rock, you can't, this ain't your place to be
I make you cry kid, cover your face to me
I'm not the one, fairy tale like Patti LaBelle
My job is easy when I'm draggin' 'em down to hell
You know my story when I'm throwin' you off the cliff
Them jelly rhymes on the table with Skippy and Jif
I see these suckers better find another game plan
I never heard of you stupid! What's your name man?
Don't try to come back, and cut your hair bald B
Jump on my tip, when you're takin' a fall G
You see the style is mine, but can the X flow?
I make your fans get wild, and boo your next show
Kick it when I feel it, the X style reveal it
Don't try the ""bee-bee-bo"" flow, rap on no track
I give you more than some comp, I give you no SLACK
People know I wreck, did that kid get the message?
I drop the rhyme, aim a missile in your rectum

By my side and wit the mix clocked
Scratches, matches, all cuts combine
The faster master, more quicker than the grand
Peep his hand going back and forth
North, wit the fader, smooth
Pickin' the spots where the needle can groove
And move and lose it trying to bite
His fingers and palms and arms
 as I ride the skills
Of a champ, the vamp, blow watts in the amp
And stamp your brain, as I ride and glide and hide
Moe Luv is on the mix tonight, Moe Luv

Ok, now Moe is on the mixer
So get ready, cuz here's another twister
About the way he gets the crowd to move
And groove and dance to the things he do
And prove the way he sway andlift and shift
And rock hard, all night he's on and on
Swiftly slicing, cuts are nice and smooth like rice and
Beans, another cut rises
Moe surprises more than one
2, 3, 4, 5, the jam packed crowd
Of biters and writers
Accumulating reciters observing
Cuts from the master as I move faster
Pass the wack DJs
Going on, flowing on, smooth and sailing on

"Saga of Dandy, the Devil & Day",The Four Horsemen,1993.0,"Why don't y'all play that pitch
The right manage gonna be in the game

It's the top of the ninth
Josh Gibson is at the plate
The bases are loaded, it's a three and two count
And here's the pitch

Steppin up to the plate, first batter

Kool Keith

Black baseball, it was a known fact jack
With the weather so hot, who could play like Danny Day
The greatest and the best, like the Satchel brother Paige
Long Tom and Little Bomb, in the Hall of Fame
Like Josh and bunt, be alert, duck
Everybody was down for beer and peanuts
Foxes in their Sunday's best, their brightest dress

And on deck, Ced G

Now baseball today troop, is mostly not racial
But back in the days it was all segregated
The whites had the majors and then the blacks had the negro leagues
They both had great talent but then us blacks have no history
Of all our great players, the teams in the ballpark
But we're here to shed light, restore the glory they haven't got
Black baseball, they paved the way
With players like Dandy, the Devil, and Day
(repeat 3X)
Black baseball

Bring er home

Now the ballparks they played in was very far from a stadium
They only sat hundreds troops as opposed to the thousands
But the stands they was packed, for the league that was fat
With teams like the Baccarats and the Homestead Grays
The Eagles and many more, came ready to play
In cities like Birmingham, Newark and Chi-Town
The bus trips were very long, paychecks would bring a frown
But not to these players, cause they really loved baseball
You could ban them from majors, but not from the game
With players like Leon Day, who pitched almost every day
His arm would hold up, blowin hitters with smoke away
And then there was Bullet Joe, also was Smokey Joe
King Richard and Savateen, and brothers like Ed Pole
Next, batter up!

Bring it home Keith!

They took the long great line that was so fine
Super and strong to play, three games a day
Hey hey, Thunder Twins are up and gonna win again
Make the other players say ""Oh him again!""
But whattya know?

Black baseball (baseball) they paved the way
With players like Dandy, the Devil, and Day
(repeat 3X)
Black baseball (baseball)

Poppa Bell was Cool, broke any catcher's rule
On the base, at night, total speed rip the light
Comin past flick flash he was so fast
Scouts watchin in awe at what they saw
The best in the game, it's a shame, you don't know
Alex and Double Duty, and don't forget Juty
Talent was there, and it was black

Give them their credit folks, and build em a hall of fame
Where legends can rest, with uniforms and the whole shebang
And honor the players, coaches fans and the ballparks
From the Giants or Phillies, to the New York like Yankees
The Pittsburgh Crawfords, yeah they don't have to thank me
Just thank the Red Bull's, just thank the Abe Manley's
Just thank Rufus Lewis, a few names that grab me
Black baseball (baseball) they paved the way
With players like Dandy, the Devil, and Day
(repeat 4X)

And we talkin to y'all from Los Angeles
Live, on W-K-R-Funk Radio, our own station
See rappers don't know, I snatch a beat
I hear a beat, I catch a beat
The Rhythm X roll up, my style gets critical
Brain connects, computer rhymes get phsyical
I walk low, and howl with no afro
X with a bald head, like Fidel Castro
Walk in a jam, with the mic and my girlfriend
While two girls are buggin, sayin, ""Keith is my boyfriend!""
But I come back though, start the attack though
Add up some points, like I'm playin Nintendo
Now look at the game, I move step in first place
Leave em all blind for hard times and third base
Back to bake em more, fizzle and burn though
But you can't see the record sizzle and turn though
Hittin the top like a hot 45
Like, ""Ahh - ahh - ahh - ahh - STAYIN ALIVE, STAYIN ALIVE""
Yeah, gettin back into business
Rappers get back and do some physical fitness
Jumpin jacks, situps and pushups
Now pick up your brain, and come and lift up some heavy weights
Stupid you're dumb, standin still with dead weight
Rappers try to plex, I mark X
I stamp X, and throw em another X
X-tra Rhythm flow, X-tra metaphor
X-tra hype and dope, X-tra Cupid feet
X-tra body heat, X-tra brain power
X-tra cash flow, you soft cauliflower
But I do get swift, change the pitch if
You got the rhymes and Hammer foots to dance with
Yo, let's get the dead party jumpin
Rappers are crazy wack, and ain't sayin nothin
While people are steady, sweaty tired and boring
Let me go on, steppin to and flow on
And so on, turn the mic in my show on
Please the crowd with some super dope hype stuff
Lyrical metaphor, and some of that right stuff
Shakin your brain up, wakin your brain up
Confusin your mind like a block or Rubik's Cube
Think about it, you probably don't understand
With a lower IQ, a weak brain my man
So listen up, and go on back to school
Fool.. you ain't jack
Yeah that's comin live from W-K-R-Funk
With DJ Moe Love, TR Love
We gon', bring it out, by special request
For TR Funky Love

Yeah, thanks a lot for that funky introduction Rhythm X
I appreciate it
Yeah the phones are lightin up crazy
We want the 103rd caller to come in
And win them disco pants in the contest
Now if you ready for some more live hype stuff
So here it is..
Some rappers can flow and, rock off the slow jam
Stay hype, continously, cause I know I can
Rock off tempo, fast or even hyper
Just like a sniper, pied microphone piper
Smooth rough and ready, hardcore stanyin steady
In the lane, rock'n'roll ready
On, any, MC type wannabe like
Had to sound like, gots to be like
Wants to look like, has to act like
Now you feel like.. hmm
You know you're perpetrating?  Yeah right
C'mon face it, and then chase it
You can taste it, cause I placed it
Smack in your face, with five million pounds of bass
Boomin systems ads can't replace
In fact all, the rhythm is packed on tightly
+Days of Thunder+?  Not likely
Fact or fiction, while I got you scheamin
You ain't ready boy, I caught you sleepin
And searchin for a dope style, combine to watch our
Freestyle, straight from the penile
Buckwild, runnin wild with the golden mic
I'm like a flash, first you see, then you lose sight
Of the master TR, plan in hand
Destroyin a foe, who's not in demand
So act now, and for the fact now
There's no doubt in my mind, I'll be rap now
C'mon on man, c'mon!
Yo, MC's, you say you're comin back?
Huh, yo, you ain't jack.. jack.. jack.. jack.. jack..

Jack.. Jack.. Jack.. Jack..

Yeah, ha hah, ha hah, ha hah..",https://genius.com/Ultramagnetic-mcs-funk-radio-lyrics
You Ain’t Shit,Mo Love’s Basement Tapes,UnKnown,"It's been a while, fuck it I flex, Rhythm X
Can flow yo, turn the mic on pro
And watch me go, flaunt the style, rhythm I give 'em
Never be with 'em, stop 'em out but I hit 'em
One time, bust it with one rhyme
Motherfukin danger, talkin to me rap ranger
I get swift, prepare for the next man
And you can't handle, look out for the X-Man
Cause I get mad, take your mic and perform
See you're fuckin with heat black I'm lyrically warm
A form of Storm, of lyrical lightning
While you keep bitin'en, but I keep brightening
But you can't see the X style is frightening
Connectin often, brains go in spherical
While you make whack rhymes, your records are miracles
SMASH~! Record company trash
Sign a bullshit act, you need a foot in your ass
Boom bap, bash and crash, motherfuckers I mash
Keepin up on the bass
Step to pep, I gotta boost the rep
And get rugged and raw, back to run and shift
But you need a ride cause your brain need a lift
Four blocks away you hear the drums compel
Not a popout star perpetratin from hell
YOU AIN'T SHIT!

Yeah motherfucker, YOU AIN'T SHIT!
Yeah whassup, whassup, YOU AIN'T SHIT!
Step to me, c'mon! YOU AIN'T SHIT!
YEAHHH, like this

You ain't shit, motherfucker rhymes are packed in
Just like Lassie with an ass full of fleas
Please, and put on your motherfuckin collar
I'm a 50, you're a bullshit dollar
Tryin to get busy like you're nice in freestyle
But I get buckwild and rape you like a child
Now your whole ass is out
Walkin buttnaked and have no record
Take off the motherfuckin handle
Let me see you bawl that head, you only fight in bed
Track the distortion, you've grown out proportion
Like a bitch and her baby I put you up for abortion
But caution, you're illegit and counterfeit
So stop the bullshit, it's all irrelevant
Tim Dog's the preacher, my rhymes'll reach ya
Beat ya, teach ya, feature, seizure have a feature first
While I'mma crash and crash
Smash and smash, dash and dash
Mash and mash, slash and slash
And throw your ass in the God damn trash
I'm Tim Dog, asiatic, acrobatic
Too much static the 9 is automatic
Rappers wanna hang and swear they can get loot
But with Tim Dog you got much to improve
YOU AIN'T SHIT!
Yeah, all you motherfuckers out there, YOU AIN'T SHIT~!
Yeah, that's what we tryin to tell y'all whack motherfuckers
YOU AIN'T SHIT! Yeah, yeah these happy motherfuckers out here
YOU AIN'T SHIT!
Aiyyo Kool Keith, man drop some science on the pussies

As I mark with the X, chapter one I feed
Fuckin lyrical hypeness, mind of a double man
A motion picture, fiend from the trouble man
MC's who watch me, you're live in 3D
While I go rhyme, cut a single and CD
LP, step away with the whack shit
Cause I do things in the form of a prophet
While you backstep and think your brain can stop it
Look at the steel doors, rhymes are rocks
Each time I flow you stick your hand to the box
As you bite and borrow, say a rhyme on tomorrow
Give me a pound and walk away like you're Rollo
Sanford & Son, comin out with that junk style
But I ain't with that, that crocodile punch style
Lyrically faster, strikes of the master
Fuckin with brain farms, my style it has to
Flow on smoothly, reflect and groom me
But I'm not God and my fans don't boo me
Around the clock, state to state, fuck it you wait
Yeah, while your brains debate
I move once, twice, three times or four
And let an R&B rapper come settle the score
You ain't shit

Yeah that's right boy, c'mon
You ain't shit, know what that means
C'mon, c'mon, you ain't shit
They don't want none man, old school large boy
You ain't shit! Aiyyo Ced, get with it

You ain't shit, you're like a stain in my drawers
Battle me is some shit that crawls and
Leaps out the side of my baby's little diaper
You think you can rhyme but Ced Gee rhymes hyper
Faster, smoother, and even more clever than
Watch me I'm mad now, so step up get buried in
My metaphor twister, rhymes that's dazin
To me you're a kid so, come and get raised in
South Bronx, New York, you might learn a thing or too
Where rap stands tall and, the artists are true and blue
Like me and Kool Keith, Tim Dog, TR Love
Moe Love in Brooklyn, Ultra we stay above
The other groups or rappers that's so low
You steppin to us, you get crushed up like bolo
Rhymes that's whipped up, with all tongue twisters
We're stickin you so slow, come on get zipped up
Buttoned up hyper, Ced Gee is pier piper
My music you like-a, I'm twice as nice ah
The ultimate, fully equipped, the mic I grip
Cause you ain't shit!

""T minus one minute, mark, and counting""
""The firing system for the sound suppression water
Will be armed in just a couple of seconds from now""

Yo, Ced, we only got a minute left
What are we gonna do?

Word, yo I'm gonna bust a rhyme, we out of here man y'know
We hit the road, y'now
And come back next winter, somethin like that
Aight?

Cool

Aight, let's do this
A minute left, to give you another rhyme
Thumping it, to keep you all on time
Kicking it, wit much rhythm and pace
To set my tone, follow the bass
Quickly, other rappers are annihilated
Designated, eradicated, suffocated
Like a cake that's set to bake
I'll take, mold and shape
Scrape, like a butcher, I'm carvin
You're brain's starvin, I'm steady scarrin
A plastic garden, the crowd is chargin
And I'm dodgin, I'm livin large and
Better than ever and clever to battle me never
Whether or not you rock a lot of rhyme
To twist and shift the pitch to switch the gift to gab
To drop a dab of rhythm
Give em, a certified rhyme
That I use, confuse, clock the time to a point
A metaphysical radius
I'm Ced-Gee and all I have to say is this
Yo, I'm outta here, yo, I like to say wassup to my man CJ
Down at six corners, Red Alert, the Violators, the Jungle Brothers
The whole family, Afrika Bambaataa
My man Andy down at D&D
Yo, I'm outta here, peace!",https://genius.com/Ultramagnetic-mcs-one-minute-less-lyrics
Chorus Line Pt. 2,Funk Your Head Up,1992,"Can you funk with it? (3X)
Rappers wanna step on the X, then go to shit
I got the mic in my hand and well equipped
Usin my style for a firm set of action
MC's beware, the club windows I'm bashin
Throwin rhymes and bombs and some cocktails
You better move quick, but not slow snails
I get smooth on daddy and granddaddy
Why?  Cause I'm the great grandfather
MC in motion, G as in go left
Rhymin on off-beat, the X is so death-defyin
Super scrubs keep tryin
You wanna bite like a pit?  I'll be the lion
I'll chew your ass like monkies on wild kingdom
And look at birds and bees that come sting them
Time after time, rhyme after rhyme
Cause you ain't jack shit, not even a dime
A nickel and penny, a one dollar bill
How can you break wild and tell brothers to chill
You ain't the man to move and stop the cannonball
No matter how you run hide, it's gonna land and fall
Straight on your brain, the X'll drop rocks
Leave a rapper with mumps and chicken pox
Standin still and stiff like a mannequin
Bloody Kotex and sweat, and start panickin
I'm dissin rappers like Damon on Living Color
You need my help on the stage?  I'm not your mother
Father, son, your pissy little cousin
Suckers are crabs, I grab em all by the dozen
You think you're hard with them hats and all that black on
You're not scarin the X, yo bring the wack on
I load the mic up and bust like a mack 10
While my DJ go wild, do a backspin
Kick em down, one two, flights of four stairs
This ain't no sample or break from Roy Ayers
I'm just a convict, skippin the prison line
Yo, I'm on the chorus line
 It's a chorus line
	It's a chorus line!
 It's a chorus line
	It's a chorus line!
 It's a chorus line
	It's a chorus line!
 Flipmaster, bust your rhyme
Yeah.. my funkiest deep down from the underground
Down in the Bronx, this is the FUNK

Yo melody change up, grip on the beat right
I come correct hit hard like a fist fight
I thank God for pavin the ways
For writin these dope rhymes, and rappers I slaid
I'm kickin the rhymegram, as dope as I can and
To make you say god damn, Gee's got a hype jam
To crush a punk and make em beg for mercy
Because he's nothin, he can't touch me
The metaphor master, has to blast ya faster
You wanna step in my way, then I'll smash ya
You see you're a bit slow, your flow's out of sync bro
You rhyme like a weasel, my rhymes are cock diesel
So step if you really feel cocky
And I'll flip and bash your skull like Rocky
Call you Bullwinkle, snatch your gameplan
You played out son like Dudley Captain Caveman
Set you down, explain you can't go far
You rhyme kinda country like some shit out of Hee-Haw
Ced Gee and I'm flexin my wrath
Takin rappers by one, cold BUSTIN that ass
So now you know exactly what's the time
I'm cold illin on the new chorus line
 It's a chorus line
	It's a chorus line!
 It's a chorus line
	It's a chorus line!
 It's a chorus line
	It's a chorus line!
 Yo Tim Dog, bust your rhyme
Yo, man it's the man himself
The motherfuckin illegal alien one
Yo comin up next is Tim Dog
Yo Dog, eat them motherfuckers

Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh, comin at cha
With a funky rhyme that'll sure nuff catch ya
Get fat, get slow, get high, get LOW
But you still can't BLOW
Rhythm is smashin whippin ass is a passion
Suckers that keep clashin break em like glass and
{*crashing glass*} you just shatterin
Fuck with Tim Dog, well you know you're not badder than
I'm rich and thick, you're ""cup of noodles""
My rhymes are hardcore when you're rubber like doo doo
Step back, ease back and just listen
I'm dissin, all suckers that keep wishin
Rhyme and rhyme, with the rhyme, bring another rhyme
Get another rhyme, bring a rhyme, let your mother rhyme
Steppin to the A.M., steppin to the P.M
Steppin to the bus while I'm ridin in the B.M
*vrrroom vrrroom* You see me jettin right by
With the fly latin girl in my ride
You gettin jealous?  You shouldn't be jealous
Let me ask the fellas - hey fellas
Why is he jealous, jockin me and my fly ride?
You really really really wanna get inside
You wanna riff but I got the gift that come swift
And ain't got time for that BULLSHIT
Pulsate devestate and innovate
Suckers that think they're great I just mutilate
Tim Dog, comin back with the rhyme
Fuckin up shit on the chorus line
 It's a chorus line
	It's a chorus line!
 It's a chorus line
	It's a chorus line!
 It's a chorus line
	It's a chorus line!
 T.R., yeah, bust your rhyme!
I think the track is very complicated
I don't know, any place that will accept the track like this
We can't deal with that stuff, it's too tight

Back again, comin off on a hype track
The man is back again, cause it's like that
BLACK, matter of fact, in death react
Combat, motherfuckers don't want that
Style, rip it up style, catch a fill it up style
Freestyle, so buckwild
I got the style you want to hear
Who's next?  You better fear
T.R., the super S-T-A-R, like a Czar
In control, by far
Cruisin, like a Benz or a Jaguar
Boss your Audi, like John Gotti
So like my man whose name is..
Make a move?  I'll make you famous
And if you choose to step to this, you get next to this?
Remember the Exorcist
I wrap rappers like my man named bolo
Take out a city, like Chernobyl
I'm greatly underrated, highly elevated
To serve and destroy, is how I demonstrate it
To keep grooves and move to soothe and prove
Fans and guests performers I amuse
To teach and reach, anyone or anybody
A fan will grab my hand and wants to join the party
I got skills and style for each and every time..

We are the Horsemen,The Four Horsemen,1993.0,"As we search for black people and white people
	seeking the world of the four horsemen facing
	John, Henry, the robot, Dr. Smith, and Will Robinson
	Come in please -- on track for the remix

Adjusting our systems the horsemen are ready to go
Our jets, should be ready for take off, any second
	Aheheheheheheheh!
I probe for evidence, movin, positive beams
Incite the first gadget, my atom explodes
Just hit the fifth planet, the X reload
Take a brother on a flight for the Alpha, Omega
I kick lyrics on Earth, you think I'm cosmic
A spacewalker, dippin in my spacecraft
Through molecules, a steel wall interphase
The Fourth Horseman, legendary universe
Dark shadow human rhymin on a funky verse
I'm level 7, Optimus pull back
Feeding the world of gamma data, to locate
You interlock, power 7 warp speed
Negative charge, biochemically crush
My own nucleus bomb, the great Menudo
Yo Wolverine I'm down, Cyclops, Rhythm X
X we can back up The Four Horsemen
Toronto Blue Jays, field, just like Dave Winfield
Pick up your bat and go to third
I see that man at the plate, he's waitin home
	We are the Horsemen -- ENTER YOUR SPACESHIP! (3X)
	We are the Horsemen -- ENTER!
	While, returning back to my spaceship
	on my galactic horse, this is what happened..

I get super bionic
No my name's not Mantronix, but I'm 4-H-M
Kickin flavor so steadily, so wickedy wicked
Can I switchedy switch it, I saw my troops last night
They said, ""Ced could you kick it?""
I got mega in concert
Then I wrote a deposit, I hit my mega-mini
Zoom back to outer space, ten nine EIGHT seven six
Five four three - the chain reaction
Triggered the mad flows, then the rhymin got hyper
Plus I knew what they like-a, so I ripped it and rock it
Frequencies in the pocket, one blast two blast
Yes approximate, green in the chambers
The lights came on, infrared and exciting
Most don't know what I'm saying, galactic come beams
Beams beams beams beams beams beams
Beams beams beams...
Now it's classic the atom, no I don't mean The Phantom
Molecules in the mix, with lots of protons to hand them
Plus I'm billin the workers, secret charts led to Persia
When they're reachin their pick-up, I'ma crossover bezerker
We turn to the galaxy, the universe bothers me
From the Wild Wild West, I have a spaceship mentality
When I chill at the planet, magnesium flip
So I shake up the myolex, so what's left?

Check it out, one time
My tricky tricky style is so cocky I knock you out like I'm Rocky
And then I'll bet you the world, plus some loot, on the point
A licky lethaler rapper 'cause my rhymes are like potion
I think he burn like ?, to put your mind in slow motion
Simply, it's done, like makin' a bungee
You lick it or roll it a sticky spark with the fellas
Let's contact Quinton, they call him the chief
Plus I'm votin' destruction, on suckers they're nerds
Take their style toss it up, then add effects like a reverb
Take it and match it, 'cause the flow is exceptional
The Washington Congress, the House and Congressional
Professional, call it geronimo
Frequencies on the mickie, watch your girl give a hickey
Now you're flippin' the ill way, diluted with ?
The Horsemen style is to flow so rapid

Mad sick, used to hang with Charles Manson
Cut up any foot, if I saw it kept dancin'
I smeggle smack 'em, briggle briggle break 'em
Catch 'em with the Hefty bag, walk away and take 'em

You ain't hard, buggin and so rough
You're jack doo-doo, and soft as cream puff
I know MC's who feel proud and black though
I know many; their ass sound whack though
Tryin to walk up, don't give me no pound
FUCK YOU, cause you ain't down
Busting a move and that fucked up freestyle
I go mad wild, lyrically so wild
Look up stepchild, I fuckin support you
But you sound whack, now I have to abort you
CAUGHT YOU, jerking off in the bathroom
Bitin my fresh rhymes in back of the classroom
Copyin, bitin shit off the master
Lookin for dope rhymes but I'ma come after

Yeah them niggas is whack! Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em.. fuck 'em.. fuck 'em.. fuck 'em..
Fuck 'em.. fuck 'em.. FUCK YOU!

Yo, fuck them! I put their rhymes in a pooper scoop

Rap for money fame women and videos
They need to sit down write better material
Like this, for a motherfuckin freestyle
Lose they jheri curls cause they're not real
Niggas, from the motherfuckin Bronx and
Killin in Brooklyn, with rhymes that's stompin
The competition, to me they're like children
You pick up the mic you get treated like pilgrims
Back on the boat, on a mission to another land
Takin you out's like beatin up Peter Pan
Boy, I hear you like to copy
Rap in yo' country, that shit sound sloppy
Learn how to rap like a pro with a real flow
Straight up South Bronx original rap tone
Takin my time as I teach better rappin buddy
So be quick like a kid with some Silly Putty
So back up, think what are you doin
You live in a fantasy, you're soon to ruin
Your career, you hear? I'm not here to scare
But I'm here to share what I feel is fair

To come to my house, and let me tell you that I rhyme
You always made excuses, such as
""I'm sleepin right now, call me back,"" no nevermind
Cause you and your friends are very hard to find
Lisa, Pamela, Angela, Renee
The girls who shoplift, and steal everyday
Lookin for Benz's, food and a hamburger
Just to connive and rob a brother for cheese
That ain't right girl, in your fantasy world
I call you once - you never dialed back
Twice - you never dialed back
Saturday morning, live, I'm on Soul Train
Talkin to Don Cornelius
Saturday night, my phone rings
Saturday night, I won't answer
Saturday night, my phone rings again
Saturday night, I don't answer
Finally, I cold screened the call - hello?
""Hello?  Hey Keith, it's me baby.  I miss you!
Where you been at all this time?  Whatchu been doin?
Hey you think we can hang out tonight?
Y'know, we really gotta talk
You still workin in the grocery store?""  Please!
{*Keith hangs up phone*}  Stop jockin me girl
Chorus: {*singers*} + Ced Gee
Stop jockin me girl.. (you're jockin me baby)
Stop jockin me girl!  (slow down, you're clockin me baby)
Stop jockin me girl.. (you're jockin me baby)
Stop jockin me girl!  (yeah, you're jockin me baby)

Ha ha ha hah
Here we have the same scenario, but different people
We have a young man who's been followed by a secret admirer
She too once fronted on the rap
Let's look in on his story, and see what happens

Uh uh baby you know what?  You really need to check yourself
Yo I find this is sad, that here we are in the 20th century
And y'know you still practicin these primitive tactics
Y'know jockin a brother when he gets large
Check yourself baby
Let me step over here and do my thing..
.. like this!
Yo b-boy comrades, this girl she keeps jockin me
Regardless what I say, she's constantly clockin me
Houndin me like a pest, callin like she's obsessed
I tell her she'll never get, me but she'll never let
The situation rest for a day or two
We're goin on tour, Trev said, ""I'll bet she'll follow you""
And boy was he right, I know you're probably wonderin
This girl like a groupie, followed me into London
Show for show, state to state, night after night
Hotel to hotel, and even the airports
She tried to play me close
Now could you believe, she tried to play high-post
At one time, before I made a record
She wasn't sure it was me, so then, she had to check it
She turned on the video, show on the TV
She couldn't believe it was me, on the big screen
Performin the hit, yeah the record was kickin brother
From that day on, the girl, tried to smother
Me like a blanket, but I wasn't havin it
I wasn't a grocery, and she wasn't baggin it
So I took my time, looked her in the eye
And said -- stop jockin me girl
Chorus: {*singers*} + Ced Gee
Stop jockin me girl.. you're daily jockin me
(you're jockin me baby)
Stop jockin me girl!  Ahh girl, you're a hooker
(you're jockin me baby)
Stop jockin me girl.. girl I can't, get with you
(you're jockin me baby)
Stop jockin me girl!  (you're jockin me baby)
Said won't ya, get away from me..

So there you have it
Typical situation of jockin
First you fronted, now you want it
For all you girlies thinkin about jockin somebody
I suggest you don't do it, or you will get dissed
Peace out",https://genius.com/Ultramagnetic-mcs-stop-jockin-me-lyrics
Dolly and the Rat Trap,Funk Your Head Up,1992,"Yo I met this fine motherfuckin bitch last night man
Pussy taste like strawberries man
I was up in the crib chillin...
...and spendin much cash

Yo I hear you man
Them big shot bitches be perpetrating
And you still be taking a loss
Look at Donald Trump!

I know a bitch named Dolly, she live uptown
She got a fly new Benz, kid of asian brown
Every night she would front and try to flex on the X
For no reason, with that diamond and stud shit
With two other girls, on that glamour and big shit
Walkin around, at Apollo and Bentley
Sportin the weave, like the Queen of the Centuries
Lookin for Buster, Holyfield and Tyson
Jordan and Sugar Ray, a cake with icing
Dolly walked in, with a tiger-striped mink coat
Her friend had on some shit, I think it was billy goat
Tryin to play all and many boogie down brothers out
Regular b-boys, the crew, and others out
Steppin to bar, the first order was champagne
Dolly had a fat ass, with Tina and Charmagne
Lookin for tank four, on E with no gain
The Benz was outside, parked with no gas
Bitches inside, frontin hard in first class
Tryin to play the X, like fucked up TV
Lookin for green to get to Washington D.C
You give him his car back, money and coat back
Shoes and hat back, the credit you're known for
Hoein out of state with the big drug dealers
From East to West and only cash money stealers
Charlie got much shit, them bitches are eatin well
You say to yourself, I'm Al Capone, so what the hell
Damn... I jerked three hundred G's
I coulda put out a group with ten or twenty MC's
And made megabucks, but you never did realize
Dolly was shifty with her lips and chinky eyes
Never had a dime, but know how to get one
Jerk one take one, out for a long ride
With Tina and Charmagne, bums on E side
Lookin for BM's, Cherokees and Jaguars
Benzes and Audis, for the brothers with Jettas
Watch yourself, and step away from the rat trap",https://genius.com/Ultramagnetic-mcs-dolly-and-the-rat-trap-lyrics
Talkin Out Ya Ass,Mo Love’s Basement Tapes,UnKnown,"A lot of rappers ain't shit, they just bullshit
They wanna step on stage and pop piles of shit
But I ain't with it, so black quit it
Who pulled the plug? .. You know I did it
Cause you sound whack and, fucked up with no class
But I get deeper, stick a rhyme up in yo' ass
Light up your inner skull, and burn up your rectum
MC's are doo-doo I never did respect 'em
Fuck 'em, like a bitch with no drawers on
So you want a tape, stupid-ass with pause on
Damn, I cut you off on my radio
As I take a step back, and piss on your video
Piss on the pop charts and fake material
Rappers know I'm stupid mad, I'm gettin fed up
And fuck all your whack groups, they get set up
Five at a time, let 'em come with that cheap shit
Now 1 Adam 12, with that fantasy street shit
Or rappers who try to teach, and brag and pop shit
But I'm on 8th floor, and ready to drop shit
Pounds and pounds and stacked up with metaphor
Open the bag, step aside and then let it pour
Hittin your brain like a current through a lightbulb
Or any old bar, plus your neighborhood nightclub
Beware yo, you're talkin out of your ass
{*laughter*}

You say you make this much, and you make that much
You come in your white Benz, and pull up like Cap'n Crunch
But I don't give a fuck; I drive a Geo
Now who got the best rhymes? Tell 'em Leo
While you stand stiff like Gilligan with no Island
I burn the MC, who wrote your fucked up style and
Cause I'ma get the axe out, and start choppin 'em
Call President Bush to keep stoppin 'em
Whack MC's get the fuck out the business
Oh you with a major? Now tell me what is this
Yo, I'm gettin busy and hyped up
While you gotta scream your rebel tracks are fucked up
Measured unmeasured, off-beat and left field
What dummy produced that? That shit ain't real
I'm tellin facts, I'm blowin up on your ass
And if your show is tonight, I'm goin up in your ass
Just like an outlaw, smooth rugged and raw
I never roll with a clown, when I'm out on tour
I'm not impressed, fuck around with that cheap style
That African tribe shit, political freestyle
School is lettin out now, it's three o'clock
Fuck all that weak whack shit, it's four o'clock
Time to get paid, the critic kingdom New York an'
While rappers try to talk I step away and keep walkin
Fuck 'em~! Male rappers and females
Cause you ain't worth two cents, a bag with seashells
Tryin to dance, tryin to talk, tryin to rhyme
Tryin to preach, tryin to ill
Tryin to teach, tryin to scream, listen close chief
You're talkin out of your ass
{*laughter*}

Continuin, no fuckin bum can stop me
Unless you write in, and tell the company drop me
But I don't think so, c'mon Freddy
I woke up at 8 o'clock, I'm fuckin ready
For any your whack shit that's hard to sell
10 weeks on Billboard, it's hard to tell
See I don't get mad, the X'll get even
I jump on stage, your dirty ass is leavin
You're lettin off steam - oh yeah really?
No time for rat turds, you're fuckin silly
Don't come with that phony Monie macaroni Love style
Cause I'ma get mad, stupid crazy and buckwild
Son of a bitch, step to me Rich
And watch the X flow reverse and switch
MC's to the other side, they get waxed though
You never knew I could rhyme? You didn't axe though
I'm rollin all of you two-faced bastards
Ready or not, that's why I always practice
Catch me off guard, yo Sandman fuck you
I stand in the front while other rappers they duck you
Come inside, they try to sneak out the back door
As I get hyped and criticize the whack more
Fuck 'em, I got some shit for their black ass
White rappers too, I got some shit for their whack ass
Cause I don't hold back with tons of mega shit
Come on stage sway down with a weak hit
But you think you're fresh though, you ain't jack shit
Smoother than Rhythm X, go 'head with that whack shit
Aiyyo duke, you're talkin out of your ass
Yes, this is the one Rhythm X
And all you stupid-ass motherfuckers who think you nice
I wanna see what you got
But I know you ain't got shit
Ain't nuttin but jack doo-doo dumb doo-doo whack shit

I will not take my mask off to reveal
Check it out but I'ma drop lyrics
You know what?  Hit it
Yo niggas wanna get in the backdoor, but fuck it
Rappers can't rap a lick, chompin on other dick
I gotta do this for X, and make them brothers quit
Don't try that sissy shit, that gettin busy shit
I bang a nail up in your dooty hole and booty quick
Rappers know me, I'm bugged, I chop your ass right
Take that body and bag it, then I'm out of sight
I got the F.B.I., not the F.O.I
Tryin to find the design, and take what underline
The pure facts on the stupid wicked wax
People they know, I'm out the hospital
Cold buggin and illin like Dr. Doolittle
You better walk up the street, now look around black
See that man on the street, who's at the corner yea (8X)
Back to hell to the graveyard
With fog on the street, you see the Ghostrider homepiss
I walk down on your block and see you sleepin
Cold jump in your bed, and fuck you up, yea yea
Down with the X, I'm at the basement
Got the body and bag, up on the pavement
Cement I went, just hid em in the vent
I put the rappers upstairs and let em air out
Before the cops came, I cleaned the blood up
I called detectives in town and said yo whattup
I wasn't home - somebody's in my house
I took them rappers back out, up in a pickup truck
Think I'd tell on myself?
See that man on the street, who's at the corner yea (10X)
Yeah
I'm not gon' reveal myself
Still standing here with this black cape on
White gloves, these big silver boots
Ain't nobody notice how I fly, how high
So I'll see you on the next issue

I Ain’t Takin’ No Shorts,New York What is Funky,UnKnown,"Hey yo Ced
I can't believe that A&R person put us on hold
For all the happy rap man!

Word Dog, she must have been buggin
Yo Keith man, she actually really thought we was takin shorts
Talkin 'bout, wait 'til next month
When she'll sign us when her boss gets back
Hey yo Keith man, tell 'em whassup man
How you feel about bein put on hold for all this happy rap?

Happy rap, is not my style
I never sweat and walk with a smile
Like you do, comin out like doo doo
On the anal tip, butt MC's flip for
They try to play the time on a small tour
Small cash, small floor
Small digits, perpetratin a fraud
In their face, I'm thinkin out with bass
Jackin ace, king or queen, hype and dope
Nice and nice, comin out of the woodwork
Happy rap, polka dots and ties
Clowns who demonstrate in front of your eyes
I'm a businessman, steppin out more serious
You get curious and lookin for a hit of this
I'm on the mic to speak and I realize
Rappers are sellin out, screamin and yellin out
Talkin the weak whack, dancin and fallin out
All on the floor, lookin out at the circus
Two little pigs, tryin to move and work this
Jerk this, now get your hand off the mic
As I grow and grow, grow and grow, grow and grow
Now call me grand Poppa Large
I'm a hustler, and I ain't takin no shorts
And I ain't takin no shorts {*3X*}
Yo Ced, I know you down with all this happy rap
Why don't you tell me about it?

Aight, bust it
No shorts taker, kickin the flavor
Ced Gee is a wise man, with knowledge I gave the
Beat whack a chance to cut the gap in rap
And snap, out of the happy rap phony
Attack with metaphor, I'm strictly teachin
My rhymes'll steady swarm, with words that's reachin
Youth, to tell you I'm mad about
The rappers who clown around, I think they're sellin out
They cry, they hide and lie, then try to make
The lucky hit, tune, then die
Wreck up the business, I guess it's just what they do
While artists like me, stick with rhymes 'til I'm Ultra proof
The man of vision's intuition are proficient
To change rap course, I'm on a mission
Like no one, could ever imagine
I'm takin no shorts, because I ain't havin it
And that's not all, I just feel I have to get mines
I'm not dissin, I'm just correctin a problem
For me and my brother man
Rap is soft now, so I must take a stand
And build and drill and ill and rebuild
Rhymes are appealin and reappearin
It seems, you know what I mean
You've been schooled by Ced Gee, so sweet
So be a boss a force of course and take no loss
If suckers try to cross
Just remember... I ain't takin no shorts, yeah!
Yeah, I ain't takin no shorts!
That's what I'm talkin about, I ain't takin no shorts
Not in 90, not in 2000, I ain't takin no shorts
Hey yo Keith I know you got somethin else to say my brother

Happy rap, walkin out with a clown suit
The red suit, the green and brown suit
Look at'cha, I wanna throw a hook at'cha
Eggs and rocks, I need to wail a book at'cha
Back and forth, talkin out real loud
While you scream out ""shout,"" disrespect the crowd
On the money tip, get back money grip
When I pick up the mic, turn around and flip
To the left side, I like to move and swing low
Cut up a rhyme and drop it out on a single
More rhymes are funny now, happy and silly now
Happy-go-lucky, on the mic and meanwhile
You standin still, lookin out for a good rhyme
Makin the whack junk, wastin my good time
Aiyyo Tim, why don't you tell 'em what it's like out here on these streets

I ain't takin no shorts, suckers tryin to play me like I thought
But Tim Dog got rhymes of all sorts
I crush them up and bust they fuss and discuss the hush
Think you're better than Dog?  You'll end up
Either dead or in a theoretical copacetical alphabetical
Hypothetical, now watch me let it go
My rhymes are hard, yeah
I pulled your card, yeah
Labels don't know why rap ain't sellin?
Too much dancin and too much yellin
So take the time to learn some metaphors
Then you get better for, so you can just let it pour
So you can be like Tim Dog of course
And just remember, I ain't takin no shorts
Yeah, believe that",https://genius.com/Ultramagnetic-mcs-i-aint-takin-no-shorts-lyrics
Smoking Dust,The Basement Tapes 1984-1990,UnKnown,"* song is poorly recorded + hard to understand; corrections appreciated

Yo!  That just about wraps up
What I believe is some unique careers
But how else to bring this... decade
And, different y'know that new innovative rap
To an end, but with a song that best describes it
It's called ""Smoking Dust,"" it's 1993, check it
""Today's top story - President Fairlane spent the morning
In conference with the nation's top scientists.  He discussed
The massive {?} problem no other man had ever had to bear;
The face, of evil.""

From the Boogie Down Bronx, Voltech City
We are here to teach the imbeciles
The ignorant, the most stupid biological {?} of course
How can you be so dumb, {?} with that smoking dust
Flying particles, enbalming fluid (AIGHT!)
Powerful, igniting my mass appeal with steel
The legislator, funky phantom masturbator
Galactic arraignment, I step to you gay men
For organism, my imprinted mechanism
Solo flex, my flowers grow like the embryo
Doctor Oc
, and mega {?} come in video
Alpha control, Spock to Scotty beam in sick bay
Relay the ADAT, my new computer chip
Watch the dim{?}, the mack {?} computer flip
Never wastin time, I cruise warp speeds
Atom speed, I blast rocket the blind speed
7-X-oh, who coming light speed
I got the fly the bucket seat spaceship
Missile control, Spectrum City sees the fold
I'm in the atmosphere, word to planet Earth
My intro verse can funk so impeccable
Styring{?} styring{?} styring{?}
I'm a zeek smoking dust

Not drug dust, the dust of fools (hit it!)
Smoking dust.. we're smoking dust
Smoking dust.. we're smoking dust
Smoking dust.. we're smoking dust

Come see the psycho, kick another caper
I'm only here to strafe ya, set the record straight
Let my mental powers break ya, elevate, correlate
Fate just scraped ya - come one come all
My sight is on the justice
I know what you've been told, but you really have to trust this
Rippin alleys up, my aim's to ride
I know it's ass-backwards, instead it should be I
The alien, citizen, straight from the bottom
{?} cycled up, part the dust, yeah I got 'em
Through heaven and hell, it's all in the mind
Cause when you're gone you're buried, 'til the end of time
The biblical master, arrangin the trip
Some humans wanna doubt me, they catch me on my ship
To me it's no problem, that's far beyond my way
I leave 'em like a puzzle, each play is mine to sway
Debate, is open, today
So pick up pick up, the blast from my brain
{?} Ced Gee, the infinite, infinite
Like Churchill was elected, yeah I have a special gift
To lecture, shift ya, switch ya, move ya
Get you out your seat, totally improve your
Search, state, learn, find
WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM, WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY MIND?
I'M SORRY, SORRY, SORRY, SORRY, SORRY, SORRY...
I'm smoking dust!

Smoking dust.. we're smoking dust
Smoking dust.. we're smoking dust
Smoking dust.. we're smoking dust
We're smoking dust
We are the immortals
Take us to your leader as we exhibit the Earth through different forecasts
What is right for one, which can understand, limits

I'm comin hyperatomic, connectin rays to power
To blow up brains and steal the real skill, the shit is ill
Then I conduct and switch to mega
And I can choose to include the views, to set my move
And like the beat will never cease
Inhabitants disappear through my brain vision
A Babylon, skatting, in search of human, {?}
The main decision, of mind control
See what I mean is, energy
The master of the guardians of the universe
And you will search for, my armageddeon {?}

Smoking dust.. smoking dust
Smoking dust.. we're smoking dust
We're smoking dust.. smoking dust
We're smoking dust.. we're smoking dust
Smoking dust.. we're smoking dust
We're smoking dust.. we are the immortals",https://genius.com/Ultramagnetic-mcs-smoking-dust-lyrics

Yeah
It's time to come out and give the people somethin' they can understand
Somethin' not too complicated ('cated)
You know what we gon' do?
We gon' bring it down to Earth (Earth)

Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!

Megabomb ignite, super reflection
Power ignites the Fourth Horseman, turbo (hee hee hee hee)
I kick styles like Data, computer reading
Miles away to beam Star Trek
Movin my style up, Optimus level 4
I get it warp speed, youse on my space tour
Get with the elements, eloquent spacecraft
Change my gamma flow, one-three-eight-seven
Twenty-oh-nine-six, cereal silver seven
I got the skills to rap, so what you want Spock?
Style like Captain Kirk, gamma ray one block
Particle leading out, rock the way intercourse
Damaging animals, a lady with menopause
Rising at one speed, altitude X be..
We need some gas or fuel, yo—come in, major!
I'm just a level or pinch, I'm hittin New York
Flyin' with Ced, I see the other world
I need some gas, yo Jim, I gotta come down
Perimeter's reading we might crash!!

Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!

I know you out there and y'all understand
But I'ma let Ced' get on and tell y'all what it's really like
It's not so complicated
But connect with me and y'all follow me right on through!

Yo, ultra power flowin, get ready for Centron
React with the digital, kicks like loose bombs
High tech C-spects, hit data brain checks
Soundin like John ?, time's up brain TEST
Info storm, locked like SMPTE
Buzzz buzzz buzzz, it's annoying
So pick up kicks and, flex with the mega mega
Square roots on time, so check check check check
And go as I ignite, the energy will unite
FAKE ATTACKS FOR ME, hard as I get hype
T-Minus 7 counts, divided by kilograms
Input outputs, the figure is fluid
But some plug censors, replace it with bass
It's kickin up fiercely, boomin with heat
While you sneakin with energy, sound heat sneaks
The chamber the membrane, delerious insane
Now think about it, hmmmm.. I know it's crazy
With moisture one, and texture seven
The panel's on fire, interference is higher
Delay is in, device is on
Spinnin that plate, proceed this quick
Some bomb it and quit, then give up on life
They just can't handle, the rays of light
They tryin to see, they move the barriers
They catch the enzymes, becomin' a carrier
They stop they breathin, they hold they breath
Pass out and soon, then they forget

Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!

Message from the Boss,Funk Your Head Up,1992,"You wanna know my business? I got things to do
People to meet, people to see
Very important - matters to turn to
A waste of time for me to try to burn you
And talk a minute, you're not worth a conversation
I speak intelligently, with information
Goin and flowin and showin, you're still growin
Adolescent -- with a childish mind
Your brain is small, plus it's hard to find
I need a microscope, to see a two-cent brain
That don't think, when they rob and steal
And rape and kill -- and murder their loved ones
Now put your brain in the guillotine
Slice it to cold cuts, you're goin nuts ? cell
You wanna low rate me?
You're better off in Hell, feel the flame
Fire burn roast and toast
Let me hear you scald, while I brag and boast
I keep your brain on stand-by
Cause it's the message, comin straight from the boss!

Your attention please, come on, let me try this
This beat is funky -- so I just
Made up some rhymes that are hyper than hyperspace
Ced Gee will kick bass, eliminate
Rappers who think quick slick with a few tricks
Can't be quick fixed if they try this
Man, and, aiyyo, I have the right to be
On any stage and mic someone can pass to me
Cause, I'm in there, and I swear
I'm like Vladimir, no one bet-ter
Step to me, get to me, or pes-ter me
Confess to me, guessin me
Adressin me, be less than me, or testin me
Because, it only brings out the best in me
Soul, no - here's what you really need to do
Instead of battlin you need to really improve
Our race, and every other race
Bring em together -- and let's face
The problems, that we need to be solvin
People are dyin, starvin, robbin
Bein discriminated from different jobs
And things like that so think about that
We have a tool to use that they call rap
So, yo, let's use it, not abuse it
And in the long run, we have improved this
Situation and turned into a positive
They doubted this, so we're proud of this
Institution we invented of course
That's why this message, is comin from the BOSS!

Once again, I hear your garbage on my radio
Left to right, and comin through my stereo
I turn it off, go off without show-off
Blow off MC's who can't talk or read or write
Or learn, stutter - I think you need to go ?RIFT?
But watch me shift
The smarter I get, the dumber you get
The better I get, the wacker you get
Ha ha hah, I gotta laugh - MC's are very funny to me
And on Easter, they're like a bunny to me
Hoppin around, without a education
Formation, results in occupation
Better skills, how to sign a application
For a job, but you'd rather be a slob
A parasite, eating corn off the cob
Beggin everybody, you got a dollar for crack?
I'll pay you back
Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday's here
Where's my money?
It ain't funny with a pipe in your face
For a fracture, last time the cops smacked ya
For hittin your moms and pops
You need a shake in your brain, adolescent
I'm a vet, you're juvenile, and driven wild, meanwhile
You look stupid and petty, and now senile
How's time in jail without bail?
Now you're up for sale, you're like a prostitute
Another man's wife, on the la-la tip
Think about it again
Cause it's the message, comin straight from the BOSS!",https://genius.com/Ultramagnetic-mcs-message-from-the-boss-lyrics

Kickin MC's in the face like Jim Kelly
While Keith use the cold cuts in DJ's from the deli
In a sandwich, cooked up, baked up and wrapped up
Aluminum foil, MC's I gotta boil
Bake, burn heat 'em, eat 'em, chop 'em beat 'em
Down to the sound as it blows in your brain though
I look at MC's, walk away and my brain blow
A UFO object unidentified
I'm takin your skull on a journey to another ride
The aplha omega, but the X is live and
But they can't see the swift style that I've been
Effect on their stereo, with mega material
Cap'n Crunch DJ, I mix 'em up like cereal
Back in the format, and radio fess
Rhythm X, back to flex, stamp X and break necks
And eat up the Wheat Chex
You know who I am?

Yo X this is Superior M
The mad dog, Tim, TR
Yo step to 'em again on that 74 degree angle

I be the Rhythm X flower, stutter steppin to 'em

One rhyme, maybe if one more time or two
Rappers are whack for you and so will I laugh at you
Ha ha ha ha ha, giggle giggle
Hmmmmm, excuse me while I cough
AHUH~! Then I break on MC's
One at a time they'll send me 84 rappers
Watch 'em go back and turn to 84 crappers
Feet tappers, bitin fist snappers
I stamp X above, the letter K
But you can't see the alphabet in a better way
The style arranger, super and flexible
Connect a sector, with lyrics and metaphor
Stackin a beat like a truck full of Wonder Bread
Listen up close you'll hear the rhyme that thunder said
I be the X, X for execution
X'n 'em out with heavy rhyme confusion
Pickin up styles to bake bombs I drop doe
For whack MC's your toy albums'll plop doe
But you got a nerve, comin bustin some other rhyme
Young MC style, or maybe your brother rhymes
Who wrote that shit for you?
That ain't you, but see the X wanna know
I get mad cause you lyrically can't flow
You're like a toy, He-Man or G.I. Joe
Wait a minute and stop it, hold it, chill
Yo... you wanna get ill?
Hey you with the glasses, hey you with the Kangol
Hey you with the big head, hey you with the suit on
Hey you with the panties, c'mere fish face
When I'm on stage, play me like 3rd Bass
You know who I am?

And throw mayonnaise all down your ears
You know what? We got some jams for you boy
Yo, ? the meltdown on 'em, check it out
A lot of rappers, think they can rap and then do that
Who dat? Jumpin' on my testicles, my black scrotum
Show 'em that they style is cold butt, doo doo
Like a baby's heiny, a stinky funky boo boo
Kickin' with more rounds, hi pops all sounds
Get with the drift, what I'm sayin'?  Slayin'
Bringin' MC's to the program
Not like H-Town, soft on a slow jam
I kick it wicked with the funky style lick it
Suck it, jump on the jock just like a groupie woopi
I make MC's look bad like Charlie Brown and Snoopy
Your mother act wild, sister act goofy
DJ's go wild and act retarded, illiterate
Put me in the mix, well consider it, oh yeah
I'm down to step and throw a gun in your face
Hijack all that shit, spray your station with mace
I got my things in effect, all plans down
The boys ready, stupid crazy with they masks down
I walk around, okay, you think I'm jokin'?
Just go to sleep and see what happen, remember
Where could I be, when you're lonely for Tony
Take him outside, on the highway for a ride
Remember when the detectives come, you don't remember anything

AOWWWWWWWWWWWWW!  Check it out
I get picky picky picky, sticky sticky sticky
Give a girl a pronoun, make her get with Mickey
Mantle from the Yankees, Buckwheat and then Spanky
Froggy and with Idi, drink the Tetley Tea leaves
I kick the style to make a blind man see again
Drop ??, that's like ?? again
Fully roll out, connect with the one and two
Like Silk, ""I wanna get freaky with you..
.. and let me lick you up and down,"" yeahhhhhh
Now back to the verse, I had some of you debatin'
He's beatin' up the demon, I larger ? than Satan
Hangin on the porthole, ???

This is for all you stupid niggas out there
Talkin that dumb doo doo weak shit
We comin live and direct
Straight in your motherfuckin face with some pure raw shit
And we gon' get busy, like this
It's been a while, since I seen a good street fight
A good fight, throwin fist to fist
Blow for blow, toe for toe, yeah
Put your gun down, and give a brother a fair fight
Smitty with a left jab, no AK
Automatic pistol, put it the hell away
Bring out a baseball bat for your black ass
Cincinatti, beatin down on Oakland
But I'll be the referee, while nose get broken
And basket broken, and brains get beat down
Bronx style, buckwild, nobody should jump in
Just stand the hell way back, before you get slapped back
No posse to run back, the gangsta hard talk
Braggin on the mic, you shootin cops
But when you in a cell, shootin stops
Look at the murderers, third degree psychos
Waitin to get hanged, and next on death row
Behind the steel bars, you're froze and can't throw
But back on the streets with a tool you are still hard
Callin yourself God, and hangin with bodyguards
But look at the snitch, your whole face is scarred
Go 4 Yourz
Chorus: Tim Dog (repeat 3X)
You gotta Go 4 Yourz {suckers} Go 4 Yourz {suckers}

Yo listen up, a lot of rappers wanna be hard
Walkin around with fifty-seven bodyguards
Armed with guns, crazy automatics
Wearin black, but they're faggots
Cause when the Gods are gone, and the guns are gone
And they're one on one with someone
Time to put the fist up straight into action
Blow for blow for real satisfaction
Hit the deck the results are fatal
They can't throw cause they're not able
To kick out a left hook and follow with the overhand, left
But duck cause you'll miss he'll land, a bomb
And put you on the canvas
You wish your boys were there but they're in Kansas
""Back on the Block"" like Quincy Jones makin cash
While you're on the road, goin out like a jackass
So when you're out there, perpetratin fantasies
You need to stop it, and face reality
And grow up like a man who understands
Be yourself, never give a damn
About who accepts you, because it's only you
Who choose..

Hey, I got a flow that is wicked, so sit back while I kick it
The incredible edible, change my pitch while I rip it
We can make it just happen, while I'm keepin you snappin
Now the style is correct, so I'ma keep gangsta rappin
Cause I'm back and I'm flowin, I'ma keep people knowin
That I'm just like the Energizer (STILL GOING!)
So get that and make that, somethin you think is real fat
It's a small thing I'm back, on the Delta Force track
As the figure get bigger, as the soul brother nigga
I don't plan to waste time black, I just pull the trigger
Now my mic is just smokin, like the 'R' I'm not jokin
Fuck around, step to me troop, your big toes is broken
Now I be the headbanger, releasin more anger
Cause my fury is deep, so don't challengers scatter
When I'm ? the head, I make beats that just flip
So I write up a rhyme next, then flex
Back at the ranch with the 4-H Horsemen
The flavor is steady, move your head to the bass
So check the rhymes and check my stats
And now you know, that Ced Gee is back
I'm still the Delta
	It ain't nuthin Gee, it's just a small thing (4X)

I go to battle with cattle head but I'm not takin prisoners
I'm playin whatever moves, like come through those prison doors
I'm fakin a bat, then slappin rappers to misery
I'm pickin them up, then droppin them in some deep fat grease
I'm burnin and turnin plus them I'm makin a barbecue
Like Hector Camancho with fancy shorts and I'll ridicule
You come and you challenge, but there isn't a guarantee
I'm scratchin that ass up like my rap name is Wolverine
I put you in critical, condition don't make a move
Then treat you like Barney -- you purple little dragon
Condensin the center, cause I rhyme like a ?
Cause when a freak try to base me that's when I become outstanding
Cause I'm riggedy wreckin it, micky miggedy shakin it
Put a rhyme on the table, then I'm strippedy stretchin it
Toss it up and erasin it, discombobulate violate
Your bladder is gone, get lost G, don't wait
So check the rhymes and check my stats
And now you know, that Ced Gee is back
I'm still the Delta
	It ain't nuthin Gee, it's just a small thing (4X)
Goin back to Boston..

I ? mega with talent, and I'm loaded with skills black
It's been like that since records like ""Ease Back""
And ""MC Ultra"", magnetic magnetic
We always had flavor, that's why we're the Horsemen
Now we rollin with Wild Pitch, that's as hard as the hard get
Moe Love make the fat beats, while Ced Gee got that chronic
Cause I'm here and I'm stable, ready willing and able
Makin moves like Clark Gable, dance like Fred Astaire
So come to the pedigree, bring plenty of verses too
It better have swingin flav, like Das EFX babalu
Mr. Gizer, once again you're dealin with the Energizer
I might surprise ya, take time to realize the
Potential essential, residential credentials
I might take things for granted, but I'm still presidential
The outstanding commander, full of charm and demanding
In the mix like a hit, so like Star Trek I'm scanning

Roaches wonder why I'm traveling

Rocking the beats will cause hard time
Wit the way I say and I freak rhymes

We shake, shake, we wiggle, I wreck, wreck, or bang, bang
A platinum waterbed, break out the boxsprings
I damage your spine, but baby you'll sing
Loving you is easy, 'cause you're beautiful
And everything I do is all because of you
Then you will find I'm, unique one of a kind my
Technique for making love is brutal but on time

Mentally Mad (Original 12″ Version),Critical Beatdown (Re-Issue),1986," With the power, ammunition
 Bombs and hand grenades
 Are concealed
 To blow your 
 Distort your blood vessels
 With treble, dissolvin' human skin
Into liquid, flaming acid
As we enter your skull, 'cause we're mental
Mentally mad!
 Aiyo Keith, I know you tired of all this
(""I'm tryin' to tell you now!"")
But tell me son, how mentally deranged are you?

I'm like a sniper, when unloadin' my gun
I got the suckers paranoid and they're on the run
To the next corner, while I shoot up a florist
Out of nowhere, bullets coming your way
Just duck, grab your girl and sway
I'm aiming, I'm searching for the brain
That I need to destruct any lyric combined
As well as designed
To behold, and tell the untold
I'm crazy, destructive and erratical
I love static, I got an automatic
If a sucker don't believe, touch my pocket
Padding, just feel the steel barrel
Please look out, and watch your next cookout
While I stake out, and find a person to rust
'Cause I'm mental, mentally mad!

Just like a time bomb, I blow up your arm
Alarm!
When suckers wanna battle me, I'm very calm
Manipulatin' plans, to blow away you germs
A term, that I use like glue
To confuse, plus move you
More and more, to the level of a massacre
Blood taste as I proceed to erase
And alleviate, furthermore dictate
My type of pressure to crush the human skull into mess
There's no contest, I'm the best
And nevertheless I'm mental
I'm tryna tell you now
Mentally mad!
I'm mental!
Son, I'm mentally mad!
Mental!
Mentally mad!

Well I'm a revolutionist, with skills of Malcolm X
To improve my intellect, while another man checks
My information, relayed identity
I'm John Doe, and far for him to see
I'm known as terrorist, well armed and dangerous
I run committees, connect cities to cities
And overseas, I'm moving quick as a breeze
Into a meeting, with flame I will be heating
Up the booby traps, while suckers take naps
And go to sleep, I'ma sneak up and peep
Like a Tom, I'm here to blow up your arm
With a rifle, me, I'm more trifle
I should be towers, call me the Eiffel in Paris
London, even Rome
I won't quit 'til I break off your dome
'Cause I'm mental, tryna tell you now
Mentally mad!
'Cause I'm mental!
Mentally mad!
'Cause I'm mental!

I'm a  to learn and manifest
To obtain a higher level  and protest our government
They lack efficiency in Iran and the Persian Gulf
 it's time for them to fix, no point returnin'
Who will keep earnin' and earnin' degrees
Keep preachin' for me and to defeatin'
All the nonsense and the cheating out the system
Just make somebody listen as I preach
I'm here to reach out and seek usin' assault
I just might rip out your jaw
With  large and more colossal
I'm down with Judas,  apostle
And believe what I said
I won't quit 'til I damage your head
'Cause I'm mental!
I'm tryna tell you now

When I staple they lips together
Have girls come out of Creedmore and solder they dicks together
Carry a skull around 82nd Street!

Leave a bag of horse shit on your dresser
Diarrhea on your green two door Benz compressor

Where the fuck is Lester?

New brains for the genetics
Got they growth fucked up, the mom that gave birth to 'em was, handicapped

Biologically, that you're irrelevant
Unintelligent, a fool to exist
Stupidity, behind your brain cells
Cause you're a roach, and I'm your DeCon
Evaporating, dissolve and eating germs
This is my turn, you must burn, cause I'm speaking
Connecting every word, so smoothly
Calm as I teach, so have a seat
Don't cheat, or else you'll regret
Your PUNISHMENT, and I will excel
With momentum, which is parallel

 TR, Moe Love

You cats are scared to write
I can tell by the way you nibble, dash and doggie bite
You sweat in the booth, spit negative truth
With all your might, look at you scratchin for rank
I'm sorry Mr. Strongarm, I can see the way you fight
Over hampster food, that's not right
Now I'ma have to urinate in your left hand
Teach you how to be polite
Stop it, stop it, you hittin me hard~!
I don't like the way you can't even 
play right
With gigantic pub and news hype
You walk the walk, your shoes are too tight, dinosaur metaphor
Pack in the back of your Ford Explorer

The plaques, 2000 gold records on the wall
Ten million people in tuxedos
Waitresses with Lamborghinis at the grand ball

Yeah! Check it, uhh
Now you got niggas that talk good ones
You got niggas that talk bad ones
Nah I ain't either/or dawg, son I just carry big guns
This rap shit? I do it for fun
Now I'm still missin my nigga Big Pun
Now I still got you corward niggas on the run
Now I still keep 16 bars on the stash son
And if I got to spit, the average cat's career is done
Now don't be stunned, you know youse a bum
You been livin off years from my crumb
Dawg I saw your mom last night, believe me son
She swallowed all my cum, she loved every ounce
I smeared all the leftover residue on her face, then I bounced
I met my squad at the studio, we put down some heat
I know a lot of you cats don't believe me
But y'all the same cats that are scared to walk the streets


I'm tired of people talkin what they capable of doin
The thing to leave rap quick, the table's empty in this area
What do you bring to
When I come you cancel your phone ring too
{*phone ringing*}

Uhh, yeah, uhh
I blaze spots with it, bribe cops with it
I purchase platinum things, cop rocks with it
Even iced out socks with it
Chrome with it, whips with it, dime pieces
Disposable Glocks with it, I cop Crist' with it
Make flicks with it, we bustlin all the industry dawg
That's how we gettin it, we roll with it
Bling with it, flow with it
Thug life, son we reinvented it
Hit politicians with it, make sure the jury's with it
Hit the judge with it, uhh, the whole team's acquited
We circumvent the rap salary cap

Can I get a deal, can I rhyme you dumb slow poke?
I'm not the wiggy one, heavy like a megaton
I got a shell and a pretty black shotgun
The Fourth Horseman, the biggy boss man
I do my dirty work and travel when I cross men
Don't call me 
Rocky, Marci-or-the-ano
A 
white band with a black grand
 piano
People gather 'round on my pee pee, penis
I stomp out quick, you catch a porno flick
I got a major label hoppin on my drumstick
I kick anus, I rock a rectum
Who's the A&R, disrespect 'em
I see brother get down and sign a whack group
You Uncle Tom, you black Fruit Loop
So what you know about rap you little fairy?
Critics can walk and suck my wee wee okay~!
I drop bombs like the paper called The Times
Rappers are whack, you paid 'em forty G's

People can talk, say what they want {*4X*}

Hey! I'm over here and over there, been there and everywhere
Take a look stop and stare, GLANCE and then compare
Where's your ears boy? Rhythm the top choice
You know you can't front on me, cause now I got the voice
Here I here I come, not the wannabeez
AC/DC's, and the Bee Gee's
Groups that can't - rap, groups that can't - sing
Groups that have a gimmick more image and other things
My name ain't - Quayle, my name ain't - Bush
A 4-H-M, a superstar with push
The ragga mecha don, with suckers on my cock
You know I got the flavor, so why you got the boogies?

Crush Kill Destroy,The Basement Tapes 1984-1990,UnKnown,"CRUSH.. KILL.. DESTROY
(Moe Love..)

Now we're the Ultramagnetic - out to devestate
Bust brains - chop heads - specifically kill!
Act ill - smack suckers - yes - impossible
To obliviate - and suffocate

Any duck MC who perpetrates
Interferes - they will be
CRUSH.. KILL.. DESTROY (sucker MC's)
They will be
CRUSH.. KILL.. DESTROY (sucker MC's)
DESTROY (sucker MC's)

I'm very hazardous, hot and flammable
Like diesel - high aluminum fuel
I'll burn - never heat at degrees
Of seven, two thousand milligrams
Containing, positive to heights
Through particles, gold, neptunium
Accelerates, directly exterminates
As abusin, a nuclear experiment
Effective, by accumulating skulls
In the basement, my Ultra laboratory
Underground, sealing up humans
In a coffin, Keith's funeral home
In order to destroy and...
CRUSH.. KILL.. DESTROY (sucker MC's)
CRUSH.. KILL.. DESTROY (sucker MC's)

I'm exploding!  Blowing up germs
On the mic!  With the fury to burn
Every transforming rapper, off beat tapper
At a ratio and speed, proceding rapidly
With reflectors, shielding off suckers
Boosting scanners, launching deadly missiles
With a charge very high, aimed at our position
What I'm saying - I'm really on a mission
As a Secratron{?}, my foes must beware
I'm re-entering, to add and {?}
As the wizard scientist, known as Ced Gee
Unpredictable to most, impeaching coast to coast
As I
CRUSH.. KILL.. DESTROY (all sucker MC's)
CRUSH.. KILL.. DESTROY (sucker MC's)

I have intelligence, a mind to rule the world
Specifically, under orbital speed
Capabilities, appear to be superior
Competing, far beyond thought
As a scientist, scientifically equipped
With laser beams
That destroy, melt, subivocly
Into bones, forming, skeletons
Through a diagram
I'm out to kill the devil with a zone pitchfork
Poking MC's, interfering
Diluting my radius, here's a warning
Signs to be cautious, from the general speaker
Corporal Kool Keith as I
CRUSH.. KILL.. DESTROY (all sucker MC's)
CRUSH.. KILL.. DESTROY (sucker MC's)
CRUSH.. KILL.. DESTROY (every sucker MC)

With {?} bright, unpolished adversary
While projecting microscopic, beams of farenheit
Using major high-tech strategic arms offense
Supplied by Washington's, President Reagan
I can LOCATE any duck by use of monitors
Track you down, causing terror, confusing every foe
With the use of proper data relayed by info
Higher voltage energies are used to plan attack
Rockin certain strategies, my act
Will decapitate suckers, moving left to right
On the mic I recite and scorch with cyanide
Any toy MC, Ced Gee will dominate, as I
CRUSH.. KILL.. DESTROY (all sucker MC's)
CRUSH.. KILL.. DESTROY (sucker MC's)
CRUSH.. KILL.. DESTROY (every sucker MC)

Chuck Chucky, Chuck Chillout
Chuck Chucky, Chuck Chillout
Chuck Chucky, Chuck Chillout

As I freak with that hyper dope I'm with Chuck, fuller trunk
Off my style get sexy, the phantom with the spunk
Kickin one-oh-seven, the point five gettin liver
Like a redneck truck, he'll be the tractor trailer driver
Pushin my low-down, I'm headed up the turnpike
In Madison Square Garden, Boogieman to Burmite
No rapper out there, in groups can compare
I take they baldhead girlfriends, and give 'em all some hair
Respect is due, not tryin to be so Jamaican
United States immigant, your first black President
Intelligent Chill, like rock'em sock'em robots
MC's get played, just like a Slinky and a Go-bot
I know they styles are weak, I flush 'em down like doo doo
They just that brown stuff, floatin in the baby's boo boo
I run this game, you suckers know my name
Great walls of fire! I roast you in the flames
I'm Kool Keith, my thing is long and pure beef
Signin off, check it out the master
Comin with that great stuff like, Beetle Bailey


It's the super, producer, coming out crazy
When I grab a mic, I could never rock lazy
I went downtown, and I had this girl named Maisy
I came back uptown, did a show and got loot
I got paid with foodstamps, quarter fifty cent juice
I wiped off the sweat, cause I never ever let
I wiped off the sweat, cause I never ever let
A roachy thing like that, get me on the low
Instead I write up rhymes, I come out with the flow
It comes out kind of hyped, now people don't be scared
If you're poor I got sympathy, here's some welfare
A wick wick wicky, check I'm gettin sticky
My foodstamps are so late, I had to watch the Ricky
Lake, show, get deep into the topic
Make up my own subject, turn on the radio

Jumpin on the floor when you're hoppin on my D.O
Rappers know my game when I come in with the flame
Fire, burnin, the technique of turnin
From here to California to the edge of Mount Vernon
I gets nice like Phil Rizzuto
From the money store, can you take me on tour?
You know my style like George, HEY STEINBRENNER
I'm not losin of course, I'm a mind winner
I work sweat, they wet, they stole bras
And leave they funky panties in they girlfriend's cars
You know my secret I rap, no type of singer
R&B pop group, dizzy rock swinger
I get ill like Bill and do it Cartwright
Flaunt the flick and scare it's like fright night
Yeah, I needed tokens for the train
Standin on the platform, pokin in your brain
While you try to be down, who you wanna be clown?
I'm not the kid with the burgers, Ronald McDonald
Or Mr. Drummond so mad, punishin Arnold
I shoot a rhyme that score like Pete Marovich
Down in Houston like Rudy Tomjanovich
I jump quick and fly just like a rocket
Tappin on your dome like a bell when I knock it
I get hits like Joe, D-DiMaggio
Playin rappers out like a little toy Casio
Now the kid on the screen with whack soundtracks
I stick right in they butt like metal thumbtacks
Down like doormen, Lakers guardin Nixon
While this style, EMI mold mixin
I keep stamina champ, when I rock

Biscuits and Eggs,New York What is Funky,UnKnown,"Yeah, it's a shame out there how you girls fall in love with the same
How they tell you these lies, and fill your head up, full of dreams
They make you go home and cry at night, look at their posters on the wall
I think it's a shame, they don't care about you at the shows
But I do
You got these R&B groups, they sing a love song
And after the show, they treat you real wrong
Cold spit in your face, and say you ain't my girl
Make you wanna go cry, and tell the whole world
I looked around, you walked away, he didn't kiss you
A pretty girl, so fly, yo honey why he diss you
I thought about it, yo baby yo wipe your tears
Your heart's been achin and cryin for many years
I know it's problem time, sweetie pie come talk to me
I'm gonna get the train, sweetheart won't you walk with me
Come on and pull out your token, don't be ashamed
I wanna make you my wife and change your last name
You know I'm Kool, I'm your personal psychiatrist
I see a movie star, you know I wanna get with this

Don't give me biscuits and eggs, I wanna marry you
{*falsetto*} Don't give me biscuits and eggs!

Beautiful indeed I had to grab you like my mic away
From all these singers with the stupid crazy hype
They had you beggin for autographs in the limo
Crazy goin through changes to hear their demo
I know the foul, livin wrong totally
I walk you home, and take you where you oughta be
I know you're nervous and shocked and so confused
Badly beaten and smacked and so abused
Never will the X fail, truth is what I tell you
The games and lies and chitter chat is only what they sell you
I had to step from my homies to come and stay wit'chu
You got some time and some cards, I wanna play wit'chu
Let's spend some moments inside, flip on the quiet storm
Find some blankets that's heavy, to keep our bodies warm
Eat some cookies in bed, some Jiffy popcorn
I rub your back and your shoulders up every week
Lock the doors and windows and watch you sleep
I tell you secrets and things I never told you
I even come to your job and grab and hold you

{*falsetto*} Don't give me biscuits and eggs!

Every day I smile, I have to come and get you
Your mother says you left so fast I have to catch up with you
Yo throw them tickets away, we gotta cancel that
The phony singers on stage, they gotta handle that
Never will I come too late or have you out there freezin
If I'm late I'll tell you why and always have a reason
I'll take you out in the summer to see the METS
I'll take you out in the winter to see the JETS
We can go on a boat, or take a trip or two
Be some fish in the water, that dolphin skip or two
Own a mansion and yacht, and have a honeymoon
Have a girl and a boy, and raise 'em real soon
Go in some clubs and have a drink together
When you're sad or you're mad, we'll even think together
Walk to the beach, and go through Central Park
Bring the family aboard, just like in Noah's Ark
Stroll in the sun and watch the flowers go - hey hey hey!

Don't give me biscuits and eggs, I wanna marry you
Don't give me biscuits and eggs, I wanna marry you

Another chance to uphold my lightning

I'll crush a motherfucker that gives me beef
I'm the hardcore master, one that has to
Cruise right past ya remain disaster
So step - what the fuck you got beef for
You fucking with me for, a kid on a see-saw
The man in hand that sass the clan the motherland
So what's your damn problem man?
Comprehend and then, if you still pretend
That your rhymes will win, I will fuck your girlfriend
Again, and again and again, and again
And when the pussy is sore, I will fuck her again
In the back door, in other words her black ass
I send her home for sex ed class
She ain't shit, she can't even fuck
She had the nerve to not even suck
My dick, yeah she's gotta be sick
I threw her out my house real quick
I'm a bitch molester, an Uncle Fester
The one to lust for, caress and test-a
So I suggest-a, when you address
To grab a titty palm her ass, cause I done left her
Forget her, cause Tim Dog is large
Dog's a motherfuckin Benz garage
I'm a Porsche Audi, like John Gotti
I like to party but what's up with the body
I'm a sex fiend, won't jerk off or masturbate
As long as pussy I hear, I'm straight
I'ma fuck and fuck, and fuck and fuck
Then fuck and fuck, then I fuck and fuck
Then I fuck and fuck, then I fuck and fuck
And what I'm doin after that?  I'm a still fuck
So Ced Gee, you know you're next in line
Yo, take the mic and bust a dope-ass rhyme

One two one two one more goes like this
False alarm - you ain't seen no smoke
The smoke you're seeing, is there cause I broke
Down the rhyme a vicious kind to feed your mind
The warning sign, and then recline
Down, and rhyme when the pace kicks
Up up a hundred, yo I gotta get
A mic and get hyper, cause I can recite the
Lyrics to flip the crowd, just like Pied Pipers
Music, I won't abuse it, nor misuse it
Just add some flavor to it yo and prove it
Just like that new car, with mileage it go far
You'll see the best Ced Gee I'm an Ultra star
Galactic, Galactus, fantastic
Brass trick, practice, yeah
You understand what I'm sayin?  Yo bust it
I'll control uphold the show
From beginning to intro, Ced Gee is like nitro-glyc'
And I will diss, those who insist
On bustin their weak rhymes, Ced Gee will just piss
My urine right on you, strut then transform you
Hold you and mold you, rip you and fold you
Duck, so what the fuck, you out of luck
You rhyme like a Jetta while I rhyme like a Mack truck
Rollin hard with eighteen wheels and all
With the mic, so I must call
Myself a leader, a whack rap deleter
The feeder who needs the, crowd to procede the
Whole 9 yards as well as the distance
I'm Ced Gee, and I represent
All who want the call, me their boy in awe
Who wants to be a toy

Boogie Down Bronx, doin hip-hop

Every half of a tick, a pen, I'll choose the Bic
Yes the prompt rolling writer, for the top reciter
With the paper on the table I'm not your average biter
Incredible to see, for you to judge agree
Now I'm older with finesse, my style relate the best
But we done the super facts, superb I'm not whack
As I cruise upon the hill, the Bronx I'm out the 'Ville
While the indy look and stand, the bold shake my hand
Yes it's time to get heated, park a blue Sedan
Now it's all about her, her friend I would prefer
Do the kid much respect, because they call me sir

I'll make you shake

Make make you shake

Now you stimulated ready the beats gyratin steady
At a megawatt level, bold to kill the devil
With exam-ious reading against myself competing
It's the wizard of the world, rough and stampeding
Every fighting ear temper, half a slighting rapper
Would evacuate the town, descend and drop down
Whereas Hurricane Keith would blow and come around
Like a vandalizing tutor, a programmed computer
When I'm drilling in your brain, my job at Roto Rooter
Is forming incision, slicing in division
And commoding every nerve, with language to serve
As the basic fundamental, smooth and ex-stential
Dictate it digit-ly, and also exclusively
Created by the best, I'm here to express
Cause I'm not one to know what Double K express
Make you shake!
Make-make-make-make-make-make-make-make you shake
Make you shake (Boogie Down)

Now the steady beat controlling, your ears now going
With the flow of the voice you thought this style was lost
But it's back to inflict, affects with steady kicks
In-ful-gating frustrating, and administrating
Who stands in rap, Ced Gee is demo-strating
Impotent to yo' brain, discrete and not the same
Methods and skill I display, upon bass
Explosive, I'm loaded, my style is so devoted
To slaying other rappers, the ones the skill lackers
Extremely gifted, I'm makes a pro a living
That my syllables are chosen, made to cause erosion
Damage all cells in minds, I cause explosion
Ex-spellish, the crowd, me and my pal
Kool Keith, Ced Gee
I'll make you shake

Make you shake... make you shake

Space Groove,The Basement Tapes 1984-1990,UnKnown,"Yo!  Later on we made a joint called ""Make You Shake""
But you know, that's what we was tryin to do
We ain't gon' even talk 'bout the, the other one
But check dis, this the first joint we ever did together
Dis like 19.. eighty...... five, check it

Space - the final frontier
These are the voyages, of the Ultramagnetic MC's
To boldly go, where no other rapper has gone before
To examine the universe, reconstruct the styles
Of today's, hip-hop, culture

The groove to emphasize, the beat to utilize
Together we combine the thoughts to energize
To go with the flow and zap, every show - indeed!

Proceed to explain the sound of music
When it{?} zaps from space

The pitch is controlled, distortion is corrected
All tweeters are jumpin, the bass is injected
Equal meters are movin, the beat just groovin
The tune is amplified, music breakin the vibe
As I talk, amazing soul, come out your stereo
In a three-dimension swirl, this groove'll twirl
Circulating through your ear, sort apart you hear
Likewise to surprise, or even otherwise
To boom your system loud, and boldly equalize
With monitors reading, the power you're receiving
Your output's kickin while time is just tickin
At a maximum pace with class and taste
All elements converge, to roughly emerge
As a soul mechanism, tough expressionism
To prove a man's mind, there's knowledge then wisdom
Kool Keith I stand, here to rule and command!

Yes I see, but can you further enhance
My understanding of that last question

The mix real cold, the rhymes are complacent
When the atmosphere is dense, the sounds are compression
All the levels are movin, with us just zoomin
The mix is Gemini, soundtrack make you realize
That as I speak must be deep my force is at it's peak
Ten thrills per second, this formula's injectin
Vibrating through your brain, sorta strange deranged
Likewise to arrive and be, immortalized
To choose your designation and boldly energize
With sensor readings, the message you're receiving
Your accents kickin while your bass keeps hitting
At a minimum rage with an order restrained
All power circuits surge, then roughly diverge
Choose brain functionisms, work with mechanisms
To simplify all science, rules with definitions
Ced Gee at his peak, information never weak!

Hmm, so then let this track be called
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA...
(Space Space Space Space Space Groove)
(Space Space Space Space Space Groove)

As a space MC
What kind of powers do you posess?

Well they call me Kool Keith, the lady's relief
No alias rapper, or Vulcan chief
Now hocus, pocus, bring your mind in further
Cause I'm a wizard to abolish, disappear astonish
As I move beyond space, the clocks hear the bass
While the Earth motivates, spins and rotates
My mind innovates, absorbs and dominates
Every typical brain, drained with no complain
At a radius measure extemporize pleasure
To phase interchange, evidently strange
Transmit it to a form, some heat to make it warm
Throw vapor in the air, produce a thunderstorm
With effective material, beamin through your stereo
At orbital speeds information to feed
Seven words per second, the mega force is wreckin
On a voyage to discover and wipe out any other!

Yes - but how does HE use his powers?

As I orbit through space, my rhymes set the pace
My mind concentrates, consumes then innovates
Multi-celled membranes, trained to be insane
Make symbolically fresh, yes to impress
Expand at range, more and never less
So rapid with thrust, I'm here to brain crush
All toy perpetrators, social mind invaders
Reduced to nothin, because they just bluffin
In a sense, to convince, I'm here, in great suspense
At a warp factor seven, returning you TO HEAVEN

So I see, so I see
AH HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!",https://genius.com/Ultramagnetic-mcs-space-groove-lyrics
Brainiac,The Basement Tapes 1984-1990,UnKnown,"""We are opening the magnetic field""
- {*cut and scratched as beat starts*}

Well I'm the mellow brainiac
Buildin molecules on my SP-12, my percussion will enthus-
-iastically propel like a power dump truck
Pumpin heavy STEEEEAM, into..
Solid iron pipes releasing octane
Through a sonic oil tank, fuel, will ignite
Sending blood pressure, above the brain level
Increasing mega speed, at a..
Height to excel, changing different gears
Left and right I'm rolling, hauling MC's
That are whack cross country, straight to California
Dropping off a big load, increasing dead weight
Touching turbo charge, word to sight
Unbelievable, many miles away
I'm a brainiac!

{*random samples of Keith saying ""Brainiac"" repeat*}
""We are opening the magnetic field"" {*cut and scratched*}

Now I'm checking every meter, raising up a bit
On the handle, advancing technical
Direct, automatic, charging energy
At a level generating, boosting pistaloids{?}
As an Autobat, increasing brain limits
Far beyond space, yep another track is laid
To continue enhance
Building much knowledge, breaking down parts exact
In positions, above sucker ducks
I am schooling, teaching territories
Like a book maniac, Ultra vocalist
The general speaker, {?} Kool Keith
With a mind vibrating, dissolving intellectuals
Who wannabe, and try to be
Like me you see but you're gonna be expelled
Politely dismissed - I'm a brainiac!


Move a little further, approaching metaphysical
I am burning, combinating elements
Agreeable, compilating monitors
That revolve in equivalent, reaching
Optimus, sun rays compute
At a radio waves, frequencies attack
Emer-ging, all obstacles
Magnetic, reducing brain power
As a nucleon, dynamic MC's from Cybertron
Completely on a mission to annihilate
Electrocute suckers who perpetrate
Known as interference on the microphone
I will and climb higher
Hexagonal away, blowing toys immediately
Absorb the intellectual
Kool Keith is back, I'm a brainiac!",https://genius.com/Ultramagnetic-mcs-brainiac-lyrics
Mechanism Nice (Born Twice),The Best Kept Secret,2007,"I'ma take these ward, Ultramagnetic release the vinyl
And competitor's limo drivers come to the Bronz from Connecticut
A legacy that was born, since KRS and Scott LaRock
The flow is hard to jock, with the formula
Who can stop the UG controllers from droppin bombs on the block?
These guys really think they stars on the block
I move in right after ya, sign your shit like Metallica
You would think I came with drums and a band
When the crocodile step on your drawings you wouldn't understand
You would become a remodeled fan
It's time to let America know you tell Uncle Sam we jam

Mechanism nice - mechanism, mechanism, mechanism, mechanism
Reincubated - mechanism nice, born twice
Mechanism nice, reincubated
Born twice

It's like nobody compensatin and changin the movement structure
The operation is far in your mind
How many telescopes you bring in like the Jurassic Park
Dinosaur, I'm not dyin no more
We headlinin Dave Matthews tour
Don't sleep cause y'all be layin with the jab, from judo on the floor
With bad news more, I can spot bad news whore
By the yappin of the jaw
The funky drummer, wouldn't buy the underwear in the drawer
Underwear, underwear

Mechanism nice! Me-cha-ni-sm
Mechanism nice! Reincubated - reincubated, born twice
Mechanism nice! Born twice

Now we did shows with the Masters of Ceremonies
Rakim and Eric B
The Wu-Tang Clan to MC Shan
And of course the cats from around my way, Boogie Down Productions
Otherwise known as BDP
Rooftop, Latin Quarters
Union Square, Disco Fevers
From the hardest clubs to the biggest arenas
Over a billion people have been blessed to have seen us
From Princeton to Amsterdam, France to ""O! Canada""
We get love around the world
We didn't need any management to handle us
On the tour bus, snappin and rappin
With the Big Daddy Kane, Kool G. Rap
My man DJ Polo, Positive K
And of course I can't forget the Scoob and Scrap
The realest of the realniks, cats who had your back
Stealin shit from Arby's, with tons of cash in our backpacks
Yeah

I’m On,The B-Side Companion,UnKnown,"Well I'm entering, a style that's rappable
To keep you moving, feets tappable
Fingers snap, hands are clappable
Kickin, to the ultimate sounds
And every record, it spins around
And rotate, while the rhythm motivates
I pause once, then I hesitate
Like this, twist then change it
Another rhyme I have to rearrange it
For, an easier flow on
And this rhyme I can start the show on
After you, I'm ready to go on
Damage, and properly manage
House arenas, then take advantage
Of MC's, rhyme duck wannabe's
You need rhymes? No not none of these
So keep goin, yo stop beggin please thank you
Like a baby I'll spank you
A rap inmate, you know that I'll shank you
Hard, dead in your ear
So you can hear every rhyme that's near
And far, like the Northern star
Cause I'm on..

I come hard, boostin my stamina
Skills until my rhymes are full and damage ya
With action, causin distractions
I'm the center, the main attraction
Taxin, ducks I'm waxin
I'm Ced Gee, and true to five maxin
Attackin, smackin em serious
Into a coma, and more furious
With anger, I treat you like a hanger
Hang you up, grab your girl and bang her
Hard, hard and hard
Like John Leslie, a porno star is born
You know what I'm sayin?
I keep goin while the others are prayin
That I, cut, this, rhyme, short
In order, so, they, can +Break North+
Far, out of my range
Dodgin scanners, repulsive rays
I gave, so give me some praise
Better yet -- another raise is due
To the man that's hyper
I hit this beat, just like a sniper
Shooting, aiming at a target
I never miss them, call me a Sargeant
A Corporal, a General, a higher rank
My rhymes are sharp, just like a shank
Blade, cutting through boxes
I do it good so I might as well rock this
Party tonight, live and outta site
Excite riot, light and do it right
I'm on..

I'll take a second, but now that I'm wreckin
Don't play me close, and keep checkin
Your background, and how you sound
Dissin me, at one point pissin me
If you're a girl, another crab kissin me
Yeah, what's wrong with that?
So what I made another song with that
Incredible, skill to be vital
Hand it back, I'm housin that title
Snatch, now who's the champ again?
I said a rhyme, and blew an amp again
For you, deep in your brain
I write Kool let Keith remain
Stuck, inside your domepiece
And later on, you're gonna need a chromepiece
Shield, to protect your mind
I work hard puttin parts in line
To assemble, rearrange your afro
You are the toy, made by Hasbro
Trying, the dominant moves
Pick up the wack, and count the grooves
I'm on..

I'm like a sparkplug, made by Champion
I speak loud, I blew a cranium
With highs and bass, sputtering words and syllables
Here's the format, from the general
Speaker, Ced Gee will only teach ya
Bite my aims, and you'll get weaker
Noticin, the way I keep pace
With fast tempo, pumpin style that shakes
You like Jason
Friday the 13th I'm makin again
Par 16

My solo voodoo is here, Zapp with kazoo
What can you do when the funk comes behind your crew
Like Greyskull, Skeletor the bus is on tour
Kool Keith with Indian Chief Sahara
Holdin the flashlight, shavin cream in the mirror
Like Yogi Berra, big Yank count bank
Movin work out the country, you think I'm Big Hank
Forty-eight waist with bass, all in your face
I be there, in the atmosphere, super underwear
My cape aluminum, light up crews when I'm booin em

Plus you know I'm spittin cheeba

Collectin fancy pearls and sexy girls

The right way, the hype way
The way that MC's used to rip the mic way

	So won't you kick that son?
	Yeah..

Even compressed, I snap back like Aquaman
The Boogieman, lookin down at the city
Nuclear bombs, Band-Aids, hurt your arms with quickness

Check, check.. check
Up in the ghetto I rip up mad parties
I rock the bells, lyrics kick like Bacardi

Witness ill, reel to reel, change like weather
Penetratin plether, for goose feather

We gotta get our horses and get out of town
Oh no, who you? Gotta gotta get back
Stompin with the boots like a 4-H Horsemen
I shoot a rhyme like a hunter do a reindeer
Walk up on a moose, and smack Mother Goose
You say I'm buggin, liquor's all I'm drinkin
Drivin on the road with a Continental Lincoln
I see a red light, you're thinkin headlight
I move around, grab a ticket, then I plex
You ain't the man with a cow and a haystack
I tote a shotgun, I make 'em pay back
I see a bank job, I catch 'em out there
You take a space test, I'm the atmosphere
You ain't the funky one, you catch a back smack
I make you run, tuck your tail where your maps at
This ain't no country town, you in the city B
I throw some doo-doo on a wannabe, an MC
I ain't no President, the 4th Swingmen
I'm hittin homers like the Mets, Abe Kingman
Get off my jock while you stare at us in the field
The sheriff is scared, who the Four Horsemen? {*3X*}
The sheriff is scared~!
Continuin, close yo, back as I kick up
See them rappers runnin, singers I will stick up
I put 'em way out, make 'em lick my head right
I turn 'em porno, make them wear those panties tight
I'm not the bum from the underground or dog pound
The funky Horseman, jumpin on a Greyhound
We takin 95, I'm steppin to you jack
And all them records on my pubic sound whack
I roll the Peterbilt, somethin like a mack truck
You pick up one, holdin bodies in the bread truck
Deliver two like the man see the mailman
West of Cali, San Jose railman
I pick a bean, bringin rice like an outlaw
You see the rain catch a bass on the outpour
I drop the X on my horse with the saddle an'
No time for games like a battle with a rattle an'
Step in my town, don't play yourself
The sheriff is scared, who the Four Horsemen? {*4X*}

But lookin at the master tape in front of me, that joint was eighty-four
But uhh, check dis, we gon' run through a bunch of old joints
And then we gon' sum it up, with a brand new joint at the end
To bring... this whole thing to an end y'knahmsayin
So check it

Yo, yo, yo Kool Keith, yo!
Yo can I borrow a quarter, c'mon?
 Yo Ced, what a stupid motherfucker, he's a asshole
 Get a job motherfucker, not some bitches like me to pimp
 Yo Keith tell 'em about it

Everyday on the block, you sit and wait, you need a job
Eatin corn chips, and lookin nosy as hell
Seekin all of the business, open mouths can tell
Who worked 9 today, who got a 5 today
Who sold a bundle of dope, who else survived today
Now think internal dummy, you walk around like a fool
With your feet on the ground, a quarter beer and you're cool
But you don't watch me, nobody watch your back
I keep a scope on my prey, an eye behind my back
So I can see when you perpetrate, and talk when I leave
About this man, that man, the Joker or Batman
See these girls with no money, all bummy, hangin with Catman
Cause they're silly, we're not impressed with gold
It takes a brain and a washcloth, the school even told ya
Mind ya business, and pay your bills and walk
You're mad at neighbors upstairs, because they won't even talk
They have a job, a day and dollars ahead of 'em
While you paw me and beg me, joke around for fifty cents
Make it simple and plain, you probably know who you are
YOU NEED A JOB!

Three o'clock in the mornin you're screamin up and down the hallway
Can a workin man sleep, you're stupid taggin up his doorway
Wit'cha radio loud, you're unaware of your scent
So take a piece of advice, and buy your brain the common sense
Look around on the dirty ground, you're scrapin up your knees
Always hangin with trash, pigeon female pickin seeds
Steady one by one, they'd rather eat off the floor
They leave their bones in the street, and chew that meat off the floor
Ain't that a shame - one girl is tryin to diss
Because while her friend's at work, ain't got a pot to piss
But she insist more, to take a powerful stand
With her new three dumb friends and jack buck in her hand
With no intention, on ever finding a job
To get a coal out your eye before it turns to glob
It takes time, and such a positive mind
Like you search for a high, a job is easy to find
It's total laziness, go give your mother respect
You wanna live like a roach, and wait around on a check
But you ain't right bum, you're still foolish and dumb
You're just a fish out of rock, creek and a lowlife scum
So tell me somethin - you get a kick out of sleepin?
Because you're facin the clock, another day on the block
YOU NEED A JOB!
 Aiyyo Keith I don't need a job I'm down with Uptown Management
 Stop speaking garbage to me man - one more time Keith

Five o'clock in the evening, Friday payday is sharp
You got your face in my wallet, your feet is draggin the tar
But you don't see it fool, they go to work and you don't
They like to pay off their credit, they'll wake up early, you won't
Try to better yourself, and keep a can of pork and beans
Like a malnutition, step away when you're dissin
Because your ears are invalid, neither organs will listen
But you insist more, you step up laugh and diss more
The A is for apple, knowin what you can kiss more
The back of the donkey, swing around like a monkey
Out there searchin for needles, in disguise of a junkie
You're just embarassin, a total menace disgrace
I seen you scrapin for residue on that pipe and you bass
You need to stop it, deduct that habit and drop it
You see my rhymes are like pills, you need to take it and pop it
And let it float through you blink, let it go through your brain
It takes a pity to see, you're wastin my time
You think I'm writing for nothing or am I wasting my rhyme
You're grown beggin for pennies - YOU NEED A JOB!
Get a fuckin job motherfucker!

Yo money I ain't gotta get a job I'm LARGE boy
I'm out here I'm runnin shit on the corner y'knahmsayin?

 Release the groove over there, c'mon
 Aight, T.R. Love in effect
 Yo let's do this man, we out",https://genius.com/Ultramagnetic-mcs-kool-keith-wild-lyrics
Ya Not That Large,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yo, this next joint, we never put out
Because like uhh, one of the engineers was gettin weeded up
And he, he kinda like erased, a majority of the song
So we just moved on
But it's so butter... I put it on here anyway
So check it out, it's Kool Keith on some solo shit
But once again, there's a big skip in the song
It's not the tape, nobody's messed up
This is what the engineer did when he got weeded up
And erased the track, so check it

A lot of rappers are weak-whack, bullshit speak that
Same ol' style, I think I heard it before
I'm steppin to you, through you, like you wasn't even there
Pissy rappers with Pampers, get out of my hair
Run to mommy and change, come back when you're ready boy
Stinging your small brains, rhymes that be steady boy
Toy, you're just a perfect decoy
To follow, learn, look, write, copy
You still ain't down, your fuckin rhymes are sloppy
Scrib-scrab, scriggledy scrab
Motherfucker with a crayon, coloring book out
You stop you look out, right beside with a rhyme I took out
Banging your brain cell, I'm hype and hyper
Ready and riper, but not that type of
Whack MC, who try to fuck with me
So bring your stupid ass, and try your luck with me
I get busy and snapback, flashback
Smack back your crew and the sidekick motherfuckers you look whack
Step up black when I'm on center stage
Here's the mic, psych, go back, sit down
And stop perpetrating, because you're not that large

You're like a small time rapper, frontin your big and
You and your boy, check out Keith diggin
Your rhymes are useless, shitty and senseless
You want a career, better yet you should end this
Stop and go twice homepiss what's wrong
Show me rhymes and hooks, oh that same ol' song
Awww shit, you think you're comin legit
Your rhyme a jumble of words, and half of them don't fit
You need to quit boy, jump up fetch sit boy
You're bitin my rhyme bone, like it's a play toy
You're starvin, takin rhymes hey Marvin
Here stupider brains I need to mold and carve and
Every time you rhyme, keep your step and distance
D'ya know what you're doing, you need further assistance?
Rhyme hot blisters, takin your sisters
Deep in the love zone with all tongue twisters
Rock and roll, calypso, jazz
Like Brick was a funk band, fuck with Dazz
What'cha sayin, you wanna step on the hardwood
Rhymes'll beat you down like the back of a billy club
You bite and bite, just another silly dub
On cassette and tape decks, who got you the deal?
You wanna rhyme like me toy, now be for real
Walk off, step off, give me back the mic
Come in, step up, fuck around tonight
And stop perpetrating, because you're not that large

I'ma say 'em again, over and over, powerful rhymes
The motherfucker ain't large
Tryin to diss man, yo homepiss man
Step in a rhyme jab, get hit with a fist mad
National, you fuck around with the champion
Show me that whack style plus that campeon
Stick and move, uppercut with a left rhyme
Damage ya brain, punch it out with a def rhyme
You're sleepin, stupid as you slept
And everytime you move, I take one more step
Further down the road, super rhymes a detour
Smoke is built up, but can you see more
I'm ready now, bring your ass on stage
Look around in your green book and turn the page
Aww, yeah, what, oh I thought so
You think you could rhyme, uh-uh, no no
Put the mic down, and listen how you sound
Writin bullshit, and cheap old metaphor
Your rhymes need homework, a grade and a better score
Zero, fuck around with the madman
Cause rappers like you, keep me happy and glad man
To pick up the microphone go solo
Grabbin your brain, crush it up like bolo
In a second, step aside as I'm wreckin
Takin, choppin, back to back, you whack rappers are over
Flippin like Rover, and out of a smooth rhyme, steppin all over
Back and forth with, go back play home
You comin with whack rhymes, go back stay home
Think about it - never lie to yourself
And stop perpetrating, because you're not that large",https://genius.com/Ultramagnetic-mcs-ya-not-that-large-lyrics
Black Potions,New York What is Funky,UnKnown,"Yo!  That was some ninety-four flavor... you know?
Rather check that, ninety-three
But now we gon' take you back
To some more recent, ninety-two type flavor
So check it

Aww yeah... bounce
Yo, I attack!  Take my time to sit back
But when a rapper steps to me that's when I get up off your back
I don't pretend to get up, perpetrate, go through the motions
I use my drum machine to create a black potion
The sounds are right, the lyrics are adjusted
Now I'm hyped, like Steven Seagal I'm _Out for Justice_
You wanna hijack, hold my crew on 211?
I ain't havin it, I'm _Passenger 57_
Proficient with delight, my funky dialect
Was never ever wet, or even {?}
With that most get checked, my stats are always def
You question that I'll break your jaw bust your shit and you'll regret
The day you tried to, degrade then lie to
Yourself and your boy, plus you tried to slide through
The main attraction, the man who's waxin
The satisfaction, of takin action
You need protection, I'm pure perfection
Bring your boys bring your crew, and I'm still wax ass with aggression
Black potions
Yeah, that's what you want money, that's what you want money
Want the black potions, yeah

You want the black potions, yeah
That's what you want money, that's what you want money
You want the black potions, yeah
That's what you want money, that's what you want money

A new era has begun for the sentiment, let the mic attest to this
All weak foes are cast out, like I was an exorcist
Get next to this flow?  Never
I got the +5 Holy Avenger, and I endeavor
To sever all ties between me, and average MC's
They're like tweeters in the fishtank of rap, I'm a Jack Dempsey
Don't tempt me, Ali tank's empty, niggas exempt me
From the melee but the paladin must combat
The ones that say they, just wanna get paid, at any cost
Think of the youths and the dudes they paid to bring it forth
Whatever happened to quality, cause these niggas don't wanna be fly
They wanna be high, on the charts
By selling out the music, the arts that we love
But the dark angel of death will swoop down from above
Like an, ancient alchemist, I mix the ingredients
Verbal as well as semantic to make sure they're expedient
Complex attack formations are then combined
The druid forms rhymes that are fluid until we find
Black potions
{*short instrumental break*}
As I imbibe the black potion, my intelligent host becomes infinite
I love kickin rhymes, in fact I'm intimately involved
With the bass line, never will I waste time
Keep a 40 oz. of blackness in my backpack just in case I'm
Caught in a desperate situation
My metamorphosis to {?} will always bring elation
I'm the rap vindicator since so many abuse it
My verbal attack's a sonic cone and I defuse it
To an angle of 60 degrees, foes I freeze
I rock keys, and fly for light centuries
To the ethereal planes, of the rules of speech
So I can replenish my powers, on return all I see
Are these wannabes, without the slightest notion
How to rock the rhymes divine like the fly black potion

As I dissect into my lab
Into frequencies your ears grab
Yeah Ced Gee the man in the mix
It's your problem I will fix
Yeah as I sit back without a notion
I'ma create this black potion
Yeah, that's what you want money, that's what you want money
That's what you want, you want the black potions, yeah
That's what you want money, that's what you want money
You want the black potions, yeah
That's what you want money, that's what you want money
You want the black potions, yeah
That's what you want money, that's what you want money
You want the black potions, yeah
That's what you want money, that's what you want money
You want the black potions, yeah

Ya Nobody,The Basement Tapes 1984-1990,UnKnown,"Aiyyo Keith, you know what I was thinkin about?
You know how we go to those parties, and the whack rappers
Who got a lil' hot record tryin to act like they don't know us
Ya, y'know the, the fake ones, who try to
They imitatin LL Cool J one month, then this month they Africans
Or they wear a lot of polka dots cause they think it's commercial
Or they sing a lot in their records - what'chu think about that?

A lot of rappers can't talk - they're quite stupid
They rhyme and they stutter - they're quite Cupid
But I know the deal, they only rhyme on a slow beat
Some lookin for slack and bustin rhymes with no heat
Soft as Cottonelle and rolls of Scott tissue
They wanna be down, it's time to bust the issue
Now you think you're hard, with 57 bodyguards
Runnin around, lookin bummy and extra
Cause you think the people, wanna move and get next ta
You're paranoid, about your gangster fantasy
Now look at the swift pro and face reality
So watch your back end, you slip and you're slackin
See I don't talk to the weak and the whack and
MC's step back and, I damage they industry
Then play like a fool, like you never did notice me
Now hop on the jock and, now see who's rockin
Don't give me no pound, cause you ain't down
Clown... you're nobody, tryin to act like you're large

You're nobody, nobody, you're nobody, nobody
You're nobody, nobody, you're nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Just nothing, you're a piece of shit... you're nobody
My record is fly, your record's a big flop
Now in this new year, it's time for a real drop
As I take a picture, great pose and black beat
With Keith in the limo, countin cash in the back seat
You did a cheap show, no cash in Birmingham
And while you was gone, we signed a new deal with Polygram
But you don't think so, you're probably jealous man
You know that we're dope, but you're scared to just tell us man
Cause you like that happy stuff, the two-faced DJ
You'll soon lose your job, with the records that you play
Got a little juice at a New York station
So what you don't play me? I'm on heavy rotation
Across America, in funk formation
Around the world and, with heavy persuasion
The man at hand to grand the stand in total command
- and plus I must say damn
Well some of you groups play, like you're with the people
Like we're united, we're all equal
But when people see, you try to act like DeBarge
But you're nobody, tryin to act like you're large
Yeahhh, you're nobody, nobody
You're nobody, nobody, you're nobody, nobody
You're nobody, nobody, you're nobody, nothing
You're nobody, nobody, you're nothing, diarrhea

You got these African rappers who try to act like they African
They're playin themselves and dressin up like they African
But I'm in New York, chillin hard on the city street
Where crime and drug wars, my bouts in city be
While you be a fool, you think it's worse than Africa?
Like Ice Cube said, I gotta giggle and laugh at ya
So what are you doin, so what are you sayin?
So what are you gettin it, so why are you playin?
Cause you just a phony plus, the Queen don't impress me
Preachers and teachers, rebel ones come test me
While you catch amenesia, and go into seizure
I treat you like pinball, and show you I played ya
Out of the box like a old pair of socks and
Choose to go when, now see who's flowin
Keepin in step the rep the pep for those who slept
Yep, I'm not a new jack swing man
So groups that perpetrate, they can't even sing man
Drivin around, owin cash on a Benzo
Your payments are due, your car is not even paid for
... you're nobody, tryin to act like you're large

Yo yeah that 'bout some that up Keith man
Just just y'know what we gon' do we gon' keep on schoolin

Ultra (Magnetic)


.. of a mystical style, combined with common data
If a sucker can't catch it to me, it doesn't matter
A fact, equivalent to a stupid MC
I'm greater, than the rest of them
I'ma smack every deaf and beat the best of them
'til they die, and I'm tellin no lie
Fly native warrior from the Bronx, Cooley High
As my rhymes get tougher, MC's all suffer
From the consequence, in awe and elegance
Your girl's on my jock and it don't make sense
At all, because we're having a ball
Takin out all suckers, to soften up the troops
Cause you got too many, divide your big group
And get paid... and try to be like me
Not another sucker duck punk toy MC
Cause we're - Ultra (Magnetic)

Ultramagnetic, here to emphasize
That we are wizards, sent to reply to
The fundamental, the skills of fascination
To evolve, questing, alluding
Transmissions, received from lower levels
Becoming, music {?}
We represent, our past tense
Of rhymes of course, which make sense
But you claim to me you can't hear it
Because your brain is dumb and you're illiterate

Combined with rhythm made logical
Expanding your thoughts to read this manual

I'm like steel, the others are plastic
That try, to deny
My eminent, thoughts emphasized
Above the unusual pattern
Rearranged in a rhyme... but sometimes
I don't, and I won't but keeping up the pace
As the bass kicks
At a positive height, excelling
To a higher degree of mathematical
Irrelevant terms, germs just stop
Release the mic... put it on the stand
Step back while I overreact and have a flashback
Breakin down the frame
And take part that you don't use - then abuse it
Throw it up and down, then confuse it
Leave you out of control, your memories
Of the wizard Kool Keith advancing energy
Cause we're

Of studies, three thousand credits earned
Enter data release, obtained true knowledge
Effective when brought in place, or continous
Above the levels that, for the human brain
I've drained, a militant frame
You're a mechanism, for accumulating thoughts
While pertaining, to make my experiments
I'm analyzing suckers who are dumb
I'm enriched with vitamins son!
And if you mess with me, I'll sure you agree
That you will vastly see, that my velocity

Scientist,The Basement Tapes 1984-1990,UnKnown,"I am dominating, biochemical source
To effect scientific, beats and attitudes
Through my hemispheres, packs and galaxies
Beyond and out of range, far is sent to me
Cause to the left I am blinkin, mega and hype
While absorbing predators, as a scientist
Skilled with medical degrees I combinate
Years on Ampex, experience Ced
Indeed, bioforce parallel MPC
Was in-gen-ulity, and ability
I'm the wizard Ced Gee, I'm a scientist!

To DELIVER, such a powerful mic
I'll excite, and I'll also ignite
The crowd to respond to my total formulation
Particular words, designated for a path
That you can sell, a new format combined
And I won't rhyme, but instead I'll refine
The proper use of speech, as I teach
Things physical, change must be rearranged
Passing data of a mode, choosing a code
Kick back the time, then I'll explode
Into ATOMS, and the mixture I'll build
Just hammering a mouse, a third, would be evil
To the science, formed expressed by Ced Gee
I'm a scientist!

NOW I'm pickin up speed at a maximum pace
And all nucleus attached, must metriculate
With me the scientist, the man to compel
Against competitors, equal to excel
To a nuclear wave, events and above
All meters, contain precise, the same extended
Opposite to illusion is BASS
There be no confusion
To set my megameters, laboratory stories
I'm gain more glories in all, sorts of categories
To be raised up, a bit

I'm more tragic with the treats than a cheap critic
On the net, talkin shit, downloadin beats
Piss on the type of nigga that won't go the distance
Take his girl to the World Serious, I'm behind homeplate
You thrifty bastards, sit in the bleacher seats
With secondhand pre-washed jeans, and hippie coats on
Alternative clothes, I never seen
That shit ain't the STREET!
All you discount bargain hunters fuck up the game, and make rap weak
The previous albums, those are the tracks I leak
I save all my good stuff
Little pieces of shit don't deserve to hear me at my peak
Mountain niggas with climbin gear, suck my dick
And hop in the back of your Cherokee Jeep with Cherokee beeps!
I know I come steep, the Ranger Rover
Play Sesame Street niggas out like Oscar the Grouch and Grover
See bitches wigs in the middle intersection
Back up the track and I roll over


You know me! I don't give a fuck who you wit
I murder you, your crew, and all those fools you wit
I blast shots from my 9, 'til I move ya kid
Aim one for your head, then three to your ribs
You talk a good one son, but all that shit is fibs
Your time is up in this game, you got a short time to live
Your whole career, was nuttin but hype
Your whole career, you talked about your silver and called it ice
Your whole career, was sold out for a very low price
Your whole career, your stupid ass couldn't get your couple of weak lines right

Y'all can't leave dawg, your girl be missin me
Pissin me off, have her go back, cryin to your door

I'm not the nicest, I'm one of the best
You fuck with me I put exaggerated holes in your chest
I make your lung feel the wrath of my lyrical flow
And the heat of the beat by who do you know, you know
I said fuck all you bitches that don't think I'm the one

I'm more mature, so go on kids and play
With your blocks and rocks
Throw your rhymes in the dirt pile, and back in the swing of things

Drop it off in the trash, cause my rhymes are mac-10
And kept in the stash when I flip on, grip on

They found his ass laid out on his back
He got caught by the gat, brrrat-da-dat, brrrat-da-dat
Now we can do it like that, or you can catch these 16 bars
And just take your L like that


To rap with me it don't mean you gain fame
The Triton is out of order, the MP button don't work
Now it's a struggle, against the policy
Overnight temporary stars they knew it was complex

To cop ecstasy pills goin up cheap hills in expensive whip
Kissin the gonorrhea movie star with crab lice on her lip
Spendin the time on the gay cruise ship
Restauraunt waitresses say they don't leave a tip
Cheap posses in jalopies, girls watch me baffle Chicago
With no uniform, I swing in my white jockies


I'm usually in the house by 8
The gorillas go and I close the windows on the apes
Come out before you wake up and get my papes
Y'all too busy thinkin 'bout jazz bass
Y'all smokin grass that's sprayed and laced

Hey yo pass the dutch, pass the Henny
Keith I still got a ma up in the vocal booth
And she might be a little bit skinny
But she got on a little bitty mini
And I'm about to go up inny

Delta 2006,The Best Kept Secret,2007,"Uhh, that's right, that's right
He's back, Ced Gee, Delta Force, uhh
Here we go, faction, Ultramag
Check it
Hey yo, y'all nigz need to sound the alarm
Yes it's the Delta, I'm back, I'm causin harm
Every 16 I spit, it's gon explode like a bomb
See I've been gone for a while, son I can't be calm
So I'ma treat this like a battle, and I'm comin fully armed
And I'ma hit you with a punchline, dawg this is work time
Two minutes left in the game, it's crunch time
Homey the big dogs make big plays, they call it star time
And when the chips look down, that's when it's my time to shine
Cause my flows are so structured
Most cats they get nervous
They know when it's all said and done
They gon' need funeral service
So get your casket up dawg, son you deserve this
Lyrical abuse, I'ma turn it loose
Levy words like a body shot, 'til you gon' need a masseuse
I'm still the Delta
(Delta... it's the Delta)
(Delta... I'm still the Delta)
(Delta... it's the Delta)
(Check it)
Now this is somewhat old school, and this is somewhat new school
Dawg just call this track fire, in other words, I can't lose
Just keep shit tight, and drop jewels
I like shorties in stiletto shoes
All my fat shit cats is grimy, we drink booze
That's what's up, we make big moves
See I'm on the grind right now, dawg I gots to get my weight on
I want all the Rothschild's riches, the platinum plates they ate on
Dawg once I get to the top, you can bet your life I'ma stay on
Ultra, we gon' do it on our own
We don't need platinum cats to sing on our songs
Ced Gee the Delta, my 16 bars are strong
Dawg don't get it wrong, I'm still the Delta
(Delta... we didn't need that last drop)
(Delta... it's the Delta)
(Delta... I'm still the Delta, check it)
(Delta... yeah, verse three - it's the Delta)
(Check it, uhh)
Now before I send you cats off
I'ma make sure all my dawgs is fully reloaded
Now I can keep you spellbound, or make sure my shit's promoted
One million sold, the plaque's platinum coated
My career has me roaded
I'm an exception, instead we exploded
We still hot on the streets and around the world, XXL can quote it
All this hot shit, I wrote it
I love when my cock get deep-throated
To be a porn star, dawg that's my motive
We bringin it back to the streets, see dawg it's been a long while
Since you had some real rugged Ultra shit
Like our old joint, ""I Like Your Style"" - the ""Basement Tape"" version
Now you can cop this at the Tower, or at the megastore at Virgin
We NY, to the worldwide
And dawg we ain't got to make gimmicks joints
Talkin about the different cars we drive
YEAH~! I'm still the Delta
(Delta...)
(Delta... it's the Delta)
(Delta... I'm still the Delta)
(Delta... yeah, it's the Delta)

(Delta... it's the Delta)

Uhh, this real New York shit right here man
You already know
Kool Keith, Gee-Banga let's go
(Ced Gee, Ultra, uhh)
Uhh, uhh, yo, yo
I wanted keys in my collection, so I loaded bullets in my weapon
Put on my gear, gun in my hand, prepare for this 187
See I'm a hustler, not a murderer
But if you get on my fuckin nerves then I'm gon' have to murder ya
Badder than stores that's from the Saudia{?}
Pull out my tec, gunnin yout neck execution style and just slaughter ya
Cookin them cracks that you be coughin up
Really don't give a fuck about family or who you the son of daughter of
You gon' really make me have to torture ya
But that's my second name in the hood, you can call me the extortion
G to the Danger is the enforcer of, G.K.B
And gangster shit that the streets could ever offer ya
I always been less fortunate; so I fuck bitches
Party and drink and blow that sticky to get up off of it
When in reality you the talk of it
So don't be surprised me cock back and be demandin you take off your shit

This is war, son you know we always packin that 4
And we puttin bullets straight through your door
Plus we stayin on point cause we don't wanna fall
If you get caught slippin you'll get killed for sure - brrrap!
This is war, son you know we always packin that 4
And we puttin bullets straight through your door
Plus we stayin on point cause we don't wanna fall
If you get caught slippin you'll get killed for sure

I'm international, worldwide traveller beyond that block shit
You hear about it, y'all can't avoid it when I drop shit
It's like takin a fat-ass sumo wrestler out with a dropkick
You get they rap careers started, my job is stop shit
Piss on anything y'all spit
Door #1, I can play Bob, Barker
Your bitch can't bid here
Better stay with the cock she picked, with sauce on her lip boss
I fuck up your lip gloss
Get your handicap games out nigga, cause you gonna limp across
Like a slow man in the street
Y'all niggas put up your umbrellas up
Nobody wanna fuck with my sunstroke heat
That's on the strength~! After you leave, the car wash
I shit on top of your Cherokee Jeep
When I knock on the door
Niggas play like they not home, cause they scared to speak!
Sleepin under beds, wrapped up in fuckin sheets!
Sega Genesah nigga we finish a nigga


Yeah, check it
Dawg you cross me, you might as well take your own life
See I ain't takin no prisoners son, I'm even murderin your wife
Slaughterin all your kids, yeah, I'm that trife
Then sit down listen to your rep and give a thorough sermon
About the wrath of Christ
Drink some hot cocoa, sleep well that night
Then wake up in the mornin, and write some Ultra elevation
Do a show in Italy dawg, then listen to a standin ovation
Make a couple of songs in Haitian
Spanish and Japanese, bee-da-dong-yong
I'm great son, make no mistake son
You sleep on me all you want, and I bet you they find yo' ass in a lake son

Ahhh... it's time to relax
For all the people out there, it's time to take a break
A little intermission
Go urinate, get a little popcorn, stuff like that

Ahh yeah, or get that quart of Old Gold
Or a banana

If you wanna jerk off or two
Anything you know

Or a cup of coffee
Whatever turns you on, take that break
Yeahhh...

Give me twenty
A Mexican cat sold me the turtles
Pick up the greens and purples
Challenge me, your academic pants get hemmed up like Urkel's
Your eyes get tired from rappin against me with dark circles
You ever heard of Tommy Purple's, or Larry Woerfel's?
You don't know? You don't want it from Johnny Burko's
I'm the top, you the robin, and the pigeon
With the seed, you're all jerkles
I lean on your freckles, with the deckles
I get hype, I got the workles
You caught up with the herples
A new disease, you get the nerbles

Get your system, get your system - yeah
Get your system ready
Ma get your system, get your system
Uhh, get your system ready
Now I ain't missed the game at all
But the game's missed me
Dawg it's been a long time son
Since you've been blessed, by a Ced 16
The vocab is still exquisite
Only a chosen few, know what I mean
Dawg I still spit fire
My words erupt like gasoline
No time to waste on chickens, in dirty jeans
With cheap hair weaves from Billie Jean's
Ma you ain't puttin disease in my spleen
I'm on a mission you see
Don't want you hang around me
Ma go work on yourself, go see a beautician mami
Then go, boost a bag, boost a dress
Boost some shoes, I might look at you
I might run up in you
I might splash you in the face, let you play with the jewels
But you best not chew, or I'ma slap you
Into Tuesday, when it's Sunday
You gon' think it's Monday, cause I'm

Ya Sleepin’,The Basement Tapes 1984-1990,UnKnown,"Yo, it's time to reach and seek and speak to each
About the beast, that needs to be teach
Cause in this world today we have problems
We must work hard, together to solve them
Word up, that's on the real tip
And this is real shit, so don't forget this
When you find the type of time to sit and chill
And listen, to a record like mines
Which is equal, to the reality
It touches topic, like solvin poverty
Racial difference and a host of many others
But here's my real point, we're all brothers
And sisters, so get the, point I insist-a
Have a dream, feelin the wish the
World would follow
It's time to shape up, for tomorrow
So swallow, these words that I am statin
We need to stop drugs, keep educating
Our youngs ones, our gifted, our loved ones
How to up-build, become one
Race who must erase, eliminate
The problems that we face to set them straight
Set things straight so that we can advance
Yeah... cause you're sleepin
""I caught you sleepin"" {*4X*}

Some say keep it simple, but I say that's not right for me
I think I'm deeper, I have my own philosophy
About rappin, the way I feel it should be done
It should be clever, competitive but also fun
And educational, teachin all our younger people
That no one's better, that everyone's created equal
Now here's a rhyme to make you blink and wink
And think about the problems we have linked
To a brother man, and me then the other man
Must take time, and understand
That when you get yours, I must get mines
Or at least have the equal chance to find
A job, in the executive class
It sounds simple, but it's a difficult task
For them, the rich and the greedy
To give up some to the poor and the needy
Cause they controlled it, for years and centuries
It's not hard to see, why you must share with me
Money, then we can all live as one
Stop the prejudice, for everyone
This might sound farfetched, but I will bet
You give up some cash, and problems will jet
You're sleepin
""I caught you sleepin"" {*4X*}

Now, people and comrades, it's time to listen to
Ced Gee from Ultra, I'm willing to give to you
The type of knowledge, to make you think quick
Ced Gee can do this rap with much wit
Helpin my people see, the power of unity
So get the message, then teach dignity
To all of my young ones, becomin the strong ones
They learn in the long run that they have to love one
Another, brother or sister
Here's another point, cause you missed the
Whole idea when I ran down a funky rhyme
So once again, as I get mines
Reachin, teachin, speakin
Seekin ... yo, cause you're sleepin
""I caught you sleepin"" {*6X*}",https://genius.com/Ultramagnetic-mcs-ya-sleepin-lyrics
