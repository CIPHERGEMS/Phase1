Doin’ It,Mr. Smith,1995.0,"Mmmm yeah (mmmmm) check it out baby
Make it hot... then we drop it
(oooooooh!) Uh, yeah
(oooooooh!) Uptown, you know how we do it
Yeah you know
Make it hot
[Verse 1: LL Cool J & 
LeShaun
]
It's the first time together and I'm feeling kinda horny
Conventional methods of makin' love kinda bore me
I wanna knock your block off, get my rocks off
Blow your socks off make sure your G spots soft
I'ma call you Big Daddy and scream your name
Matter fact I can't wait for your candy rain
So whatcha sayin'? I get my swerve on, bring it live
Make it last forever, 
damn the kitty cat's tight
Mmm... daddy slow down your flow
Put it on me like G baby nice and slow
I need a rough neck nigga
, 
Mandingo in the sack
Who ain't afraid to pull my hair and spank me from the back
No doubt, I'm the playa that you're talkin' about
But do you really think that you can work it out?
I guarantee shorty it's real, baby stick it out
Here comes the man of steel
[Chorus: LeShaun & 
LL Cool J

Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well

I'm in the mix now, searching for the right spot
To hit now, get down
Damn I love a dick down, you use a rubber?
Damn right
You are my lover
All night
The putty good to you? Word to momma
Mad tight
The only thing left to do is climax
Let's make it last
Word we ain't goin' out like that
All this time you've been telling that you was a Don
I tried to warn you, girl, you wouldn't listen
Now let's get it on
Mmm, baby wild, don't do that
Chill wait a minute baby let me please you back
You talk a good one shorty now you're makin' me sweat
How a live nigga like it girl?
Nice and wet
We get it on To The Break of Dawn

How a big girl like it Daddy?

Baby, I wanna hit it in the worst way
Make it hot
Schemin' on the ass since the first day
Don't stop
Damn I love it when you talk like that
Make it bounce sugar
Long as you can bounce me back
More flesh than the Greek Fest
Roll up the sess
Pass the Hennessy
Put my body to the test
Wait wait daddy many niggas ago
I was a young girl listening to how you flow
Now's my chance to hit you off daddy I'm grown
From the back, from the side
Right, I'm in the zone
One of a kind when it's time to do mine
Camcorder and the whole shit
Press rewind
Let it flow on the screen while we puffs the L
Layin back in the cut while we're under the spell
Word life, I like the way the ep went down
Go to sleep, tomorrow I'll take you back downtown
We'll be

Mama Said Knock You Out,Mama Said Knock You Out,1991.0,"C'mon, man

And with the local DBT news, LL Cool J with a triumphant comeback
But tonight

Don't call it a comeback,
 
I been here for years
Rocking my peers and putting suckas in fear
Making the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosion, overpowering
Over the competition, I'm towering
Wrecking shop, when I drop
These lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare, you better move
Don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's paying the price

I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)

Don't you call this a regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty bitty world by storm
And I'm just getting warm
Just like Muhammad Ali they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
'Cause you know I had beef wit
Why do you riff with me, the maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready 'cause it might go
BLAAAAW, how ya like me now?
The ripper will not allow
You to get with, Mr. Smith, don't riff
Listen to my gear shift
I'm blasting, outlasting
Kinda like Shaft, so you could say I'm shafting
Olde English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme

I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
Breakdown!

Uh, Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio HUUUH!!!
I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw?
But now I got a new tour
I'm going insane, starting the hurricane, releasing pain
Letting you know that you can't gain, I maintain
Unless ya say my name
Ripping, killing
Digging and drilling a hole
Pass the Ol' Gold

I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)

Shotgun blasts are heard
When I rip and kill, at will
The man of the hour, tower of power, I'll devour
I'm gonna tie you up and let you understand
That I'm not your average man
When I got a jammy in my hand
DAAAAAM!!!!! Oooooohh!!
Listen to the way I slaaaaay, your crew
Damage UHH, damage UHH, damage UHH, damage
Destruction, terror, and mayhem
Pass me a sissy so suckas I'll slay him
Farmers (What?!) Farmers (What?!)
I'm ready (We're ready!!)
I think I'm gonna bomb a town (Get down!!)
Don't you never, ever, pull my lever
'Cause I explode
And my nine is easy to load
I gotta thank God
'Cause he gave me the strength to rock, HARD!
Knock you out, mama said knock you out

I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-mama-said-knock-you-out-lyrics
Around the Way Girl,Mama Said Knock You Out,1990.0,"You got me shook up, shook down, shook out
On your loving, your loving

I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping its hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jams
She sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey coated complexion, using Camay
Let's hear it for the girl, she's from around the way

I need an around the way, girl
Around the way, girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around the way, girl
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving

Silky, milky, her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
'Cause if I didn't tell you then another brother would
You're sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender act tender be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty, you're ready for loving
You're real independent so your parents be bugging
But if you ever need a place to stay
Come around my way

I need an around the way, girl
Around the way, girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me (to the bridge)
I need an around the way, girl
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving

Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
Witcha New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here, you say meet me half way
'Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the homeboys sweat you so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While you watching all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirl's crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawking you
Baby hair pumping, lip gloss is shining
I think you in the mood for wining and dining
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee
I love you, you're from around the way

I need an around the way, girl
Around the way, girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around the way, girl
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
I need an around the way, girl
Around the way, girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around the way, girl
I'm asking you

You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-around-the-way-girl-lyrics
I Need Love,Bigger and Deffer,1987.0,"When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove
For the first time in my life, I see I need love
There I was giggling about the games
That I had played with many hearts, and I'm not saying no names
Then the thought occured, tear drops made my eyes burn
As I said to myself, ""look what you've done to her""
I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels
All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal
Playing make-believe pretending that I'm true
Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you
Saying amor kissing you on the ear
Whispering, ""I love you and I'll always be here""
Although I often reminisce I can't believe that I found
A desire for true love floating around
Inside my soul because my soul is cold
One half of me deserves to be this way 'til I'm old
But the other half needs affection and joy
And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy

I need love
I need love

Romance, sheer delight, how sweet?
I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete
You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle
I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle
I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat
Kiss you on the cheek and say, ""ooh girl, you're so sweet""
It's deja vu whenever I'm with you
I could go on forever telling you what I do
But where you at? You're neither here or there
I swear I can't find you anywhere
Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug
This love search is really making me bug
And if you know who you are why don't you make yourself seen?
Take the chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean
Fantasies can run, but they can't hide
And when I find you I'm gon' pour all my love inside

I need love
I need love

I wanna kiss you, hold you, never scold, you just love you
Suck on you neck, caress you and rub you
Grind, moan and never be alone
If you're not standing next to me you're on the phone
Can't you hear it in my voice? I need love bad
I've got money, but love's something I've never had
I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all
I love you more than a man who's 10 feet tall
I'd watch the sunrise in your eyes
We're so in love when we hug we become paralyzed
Our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal
You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel
It's like a dream land, I can't lie, I never been there
Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share
Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet
I swear to you this is something I'll never forget

I need love
I need love

See what I mean? I've changed, I'm no longer
A playboy on the run, I need something that's stronger
Friendship, trust, honor, respect, admiration
This whole experience has been such a revelation
It's taught me love and how to be a real man
To always be considerate and do all I can
Protect you, you're my lady and you mean so much
My body tingles all over from the slightest touch
Of your hand and understand I'll be frozen in time
Till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine
If I find you, girl, I swear I'll be a good man
I'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands
I can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive
I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive
I'll search the whole world for that special girl
When I finally find you watch our love unfurl

I need love
I need love

Girl, listen to me. When I be sitting in my room all alone, staring at the wall
Fantasies, they go through my mind, and I've come to realize that I need true love
And if you wanna give it to me, girl, make yourself seen. I'll be waiting
I love you",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-i-need-love-lyrics
I’m Bad,Bigger and Deffer,1987.0,"Calling all cars, calling all cars...
Be on the lookout for a tall light-skinned brother with dimples
Wearing a black Kangol, sweatsuit, gold chain, and sneakers.
Last seen on Farmers Boulevard headed east.
Alias L.L. Cool J. He's bad...

Aaaahhhhhhhhhh
No rapper can rap quite like I can
I'll take a musclebound man and put his face in the sand
Not the last Mafioso, I'm a MC cop
Make you say ""Go LL,"" and do the wop
If you think you can outrhyme me, yeah boy I bet
Cause I ain't met a motherfucker who can do that yet
Trendsetter, I'm better, my rhymes are good
I got a gold nameplate that says ""I wish you would""
And when rappers begin then I gotta join in and
Before my rhyme is over, you know I'mma win
Cool J has arrived so you better make way
Ask anybody in the crowd, they say the kid don't play
Slaughter competition, that's my hobby and job
I don't wear a disguise because I don't owe the mob
Got a pinpoint rap that makes you feel trapped
So many girls on my jock, I think my phone is tapped
I'm bad
Cool J, Cool J, Cool J, Cool J, Cool J, Cool J

I'm like Tyson, icin', I'm a soldier at war
I'm makin' sure you don't try to battle me no more
Got concrete rhymes, been rappin' for ten years and
Even when I'm bragging, I'm bein' sincere!
Emcees can't win, I make 'em rust like tin
They call me 'Jaws,' my hat is like a shark's fin
Because I'm bad as can be, got my voice on wax
Some brothers think he's making records, now he must have relaxed
I couldn't, I shouldn't, and it'll stay that way
The best rapper you've heard is LL Cool J
Kamikaze, take a look at what I've done
Used to rock in my basement, now I'm number one
And can happen on time, never standin' on line
You wanna try me? First you better learn how to rhyme
I'm the pinnacle; that means I reign supreme
And I'm notorious; I'll crush you like a jellybean!
I'm bad
""Suspect was last spotted with three other members of his group. Bobcat, E Love and the Cut Creator. They are extremely bad, so keep your eyes open. Use extreme caution""

I eliminate punks, cut 'em up in chunks
You were souped, you heard me, and your ego shrunk
I'm devastating I'm so good it's a shame
Cause I eat rappers like a cannibal they call me insane
I'm as strong as a bull of course you know why I pull
I enjoy what I'm doing plus I'm paid in full
Not Buckaroo Banzai, but bustin' out as I
Say the kind of rhymes that make MC's wish that I'd die
Never retire or put my mic on the shelf
The baddest rapper in the history of rap itself
Not bitter or mad, just provin' I'm bad
You want a hit? Give me a hour plus a pen and a pad!
MC's retreat, cause they know I can beat 'em
And eat 'em in a battle and the ref won't cheat 'em
I'm the baddest! Takin' out all rookies
So forget Oreos, eat Cool J cookies, I'm bad!
Cool J, Cool J,Cool J,Cool J, Cool J,Cool J

Never ever no never
Never wearin' no Levis, battle me why try?
I'll treat you like a stepchild so tell mommy ""bye bye""
Slaughterin' MC's and I'mma never get whipped
When I retire I'll get worshipped like a old battleship
LL I'm bad, all the rappers know
When I enter the center they say, 'Yo, yo there he go!'
My paycheck's large Mr. Bogart in charge
Not a puncher or hunter from a raccoon lodge
The original Todd, teachin' how to be hard
Take the skin off a snake, and split a pea from a pod
You're a novice I'm noble and I decipher my tongue
Not Attila the Hun, nor Abdullah his son
My vocals exact, like rack and pinion in a Jag
You try to brag, you get your rhymes from a grab-bag
No good scavenger, catfish vulture
My tongue's a chisel and this composition's sculpture, I'm bad!

(Think I'm gonna need backup)
(Think I'm gonna need backup)
Gimme that walkie-talkie!
Yo this is LL Cool J
And you'll never catch me so don't even try it
Cause I'm too bad for ya, understand?!
Aaaaaahhhh... I'm bad!",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-im-bad-lyrics

Playing my position, hot Nick, son
This one, for all the sick ones, infliction
Poisonous darts sickening, best believe
Finger itchin' with two broke legs, now I'm trippin'
On MCs cliche, shot that ricochets
Start trouble bust bubbles, hip to wicked ways
Gotta love me, G-O-D, no one above me
Look good but fuck ugly
Tap your jaw from my Punch Buggy sonning you
Got you shittin' in your last Huggie, running who?
Fuckin' punk, get a speed bump coming through
A single shot make yo meat lump, respect

[Verse 2: Redman & 
Method Man
]
Ayo, I put it on a nigga, shitted on a nigga
Turn a Christian to a certified sinner
The bomb I release, time pent up (
Explode
)
When you got sent up I was hitting your ex ho
Shit, I kept low, petro' your metro
Politic, keep the chickenheads gobblin'
Shit I'm driving in come with funk halogen
Terrorize your city from the spliff committee
Kick ass 'til both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty, smack the driver's head in the 
gypsy
When I approach, rappers be taking notes
I drop like I shoulda invented the raincoat
Absolute, I love to burn to the roots
I keep cummin' 'til your pour sperm from your boots
Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you, ""Fuck you"", my attitude is anaemic

I'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it
I snatch your crown with ya head still attached to it
Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics
Beating niggas to death and beating dead niggas to life
When you look at me long enough, I'll start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff
Like, ""Yo, how many rhymes you got?""
I think I'll go on for more Milleniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
And there's nowhere to run to, when I confront ya
Nigga, I call your bluff like it had a phone number
Who wanna see Canibus get wild?
Who wanna act fly and get shot down with a surface-to-air missile?
I take em on in all shapes, sizes and forms and spit on
Anybody who ain't close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty? I'm already doin' a hundred when I'm blunted
And I give it to any nigga that want it

Stay out the dark, cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
When in doubt, however it's gon' go, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you, dog, believe that
Where we at? Do you value your life as much as your possessions?
Don't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock, cause it's better to give
Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put you somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on, you ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby
You'se a pink nigga, ski mask for it baby
So I can hit you up on Front Street, you think I'm sweet
Want heat, one deep, leave him behind, front seat

When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords, I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little ass should be somewhere cryin on detention
Watch your mouth, better yet, hold your tongue
I'ma do this shit for free, this time, this one's for fun
Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces
With one thesis (""LL Cool J is hard"")
Every little boy wanna pick up the mic
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But that's like picking up a ball, playing with Mike
Swingin at Ken Griffey or challenging Roy to a fight
Snapping, you amateur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team touring overseas
For rappers in my circle, I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringing a tiger cub to his knees
In the history of rap, they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side, it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't wanna borrow that, you wanna idolize
And you don't wanna make me mad nigga you wanna socialize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train
Watch your mouth, don't ever step out of line

Hey Lover,Mr. Smith,1995.0,"I've been watchin' you from afar
For as long as I can remember
You're all a real man can need
And ever ask for
This is love, girl
This is more than a crush
Yeah

It was Harlem at the Ruckers, I saw with your man
Smilin', huh, a Coach bag in your hand
I was layin' in the coupe with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment, and that was that
So skated off, as you strolled off
Lookin' at them legs, god damn they looked so soft (So fine)
I gotta take ya from your man that's my mission
If his love is real he got ta handle competition
You only knew him five months (That's right)
Besides, he drink too much and smoke too many blunts
And I be workin' out everyday thinkin' bout you
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view
Catchin flash backs of our eye contact
Wish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I hadn't had a crush in years
Hey lover

Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

I see you at the bus stop waitin' everyday
Your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
But I don't want ta violate your relationship
So I lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip
Still, he can't stop me from having daydreams
Tonguin' you down with, uh, vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
Searchin' your body with my tongue, girl, all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams turnin' into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the aisle of destiny
What your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
Break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
That seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead
Hey lover

Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standin' at the pay phone 'bout to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
Tellin' you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about travelin' the distant lands
Escapin' all the madness out here in the world
Becomin' my wife, no longer my girl
Then, you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparallel
Into an ocean of love, we both fell
Swimmin' in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchangin' with each kiss
Undyin' passion unities our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control, but
It's a fantasy it (that, you) won't come true
We never even spoke and your man swear he love you
So I'm a keep all these feelin's inside
Keep my dreams alive until the right time

Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than...
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

Luv U Better,10,2002.0,"This is for my number one
This is for my number one
This is for my number one
True baby for I adore

This is hard to say
I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
Cuz lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don’t feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you’re hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, “You make me sick”
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart’s half-broken and that’s hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
Cuz I can’t see you bouncin’ with somebody else
It’s a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn’t give it up
I can’t let us self-destruct

Baby smile today
Cuz I been imaginin’ more ways
I’m gon’ luv U better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there’s nothin’ else I can do
I’m gon’ luv U better

When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin’ all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL’s, baguettes and rings
Instead I walk around like I’m a king
And having you ain’t nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin’ you the lovin’ was good
Too busy frontin’ in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don’t ever let go
I’mma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
One more chance baby and don’t say no
Cuz I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow
Well it’s time for the pain to go, ya’know

Baby smile today
Cuz I been imaginin’ more ways
I’m gon’ luv U better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there’s nothin’ else I can do
I’m gon’ luv U better

Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
So let’s laugh together, cry together
God willin’ we gon’ die together
Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
So let’s laugh together, cry together
God willin’ we gon’ die together

It’s a brand new me, a brand new you
A brand new day, sky so blue
Hold my hand while I walk with you
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you
No more games callin’ you foul names
Actin’ like females is all the same
I’m gon’ love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward I’ll never be the same
I’mma rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you, lemme show you what I mean
Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
A toast to the queen, you’re back in my life
But this time I’mma do it right
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart
Nothin’s gonna tear us apart, promise

Baby smile today
Cuz I been imaginin’ more ways
I’m gon’ luv U better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there’s nothin’ else I can do
I’m gon’ luv U better

Rock the Bells,Radio,1985.0,"L.L. Cool J. is hard as hell
Battle anybody I don't care who you tell
I excel, they all fell
I'm gonna crack shells, Double-L must rock the bells
You've been waitin' and debatin' for oh so long
Just starvin' like Marvin for a Cool J. song
If you cried and thought I died, you definitely was wrong
It took a thought, plus I brought Cut Creator along
Evened up with E-Love down with the Cool J. force
Specializin' in the rhymin' for the record of course
I’m a tower full of power, wind, rain and hail
Cut Creator scratch the record with his fingernail
Rock the bells
The king of crowd rockers finally is back
My voice is your choice as the hottest wax
True as a wizard, just a blizzard, I ain't taken no crap
I'm rhymin' and designin' with your girl in my lap
The bass is kickin' always stickin' cause you like it that way
You take a step because it's def and plus it's by Cool J
Cut Creator on the fader, my right-hand man
We rock the bells so very well cause that's the name of this jam
Rock the bells
Some girls will like this jam and some girls won't
Cause I make a lot of money and your boyfriend don't
L.L. went to hell, gonna rock the bells
All you washed up rappers wanna do this well
Rock the bells
Now I'm world-wide known, whether you like it or not
My one man band is Cut Creator a.k.a. Philpot
He'll never skip it, only rip it when he's on the fader
What's my d.j.'s name, Cut Creator
Now you know, at the show, who’s on the wheels
He'll drive the cross fader like a cut mobile
So precise with a slice that you know he's greater
What's my d.j.'s name, Cut Creator
Now you know, what do you know, Earl roles the weed
I go to the store and get Old Gold
So all you crabby lookin' nappy headed girls get back
Cause there's a ten to one chance that you might get smacked
Rock the bells
The bells are circulatin' the blood in your veins
Why are girlies on the tip, L.L.'s your name
Cut Creator's (good), Cool J. is (good-good)
You bring the wood pecker, I'll bring the wood
The bells are wippin' and rippin' at your body and soul
Why do you like Cool J., we like rock and roll
Cause it ain't the glory days with Bruce Springsteen
I'm not a virgin so I know I'll make Madonna scream
You hated Michael and Prince all the way, ever since
If their beats were made of meat, then they would have to be mince
Rock the bells
So listen to the lines of rhyme, I rhyme on time
He'll cut the record in a second, make your d.j. look blind
So all you Jheri Curl suckers wearin' high-heel boots
Like ballerinas, what I mean is you're a fruit-loop troop
All you gonna-be(s), wanna-be(s), when will you learn
Wanna be like Cool J., you gotta wait your turn
Some suckers don't like me, but I'm not concerned
Six-g (s) for twenty minutes is the pay I earn
I'm growin' and glowin' like a forest blaze
Do you like Michael Jackson? ""We like Cool J""
That's right, I'm on the mic with the help of the bells
There's no delayin' what I'm sayin' as I'm rockin' you well
Rock the bells",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-rock-the-bells-lyrics
Going Back to Cali,Walking with a Panther,1988.0,"I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali... hmm, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali... I don't think so
Going back to Cali, stylin, profilin
Growlin, and smilin, while in the sun
The top is down, on the black Corvette
And it's fly, cause it's sittin on Daytons
Nardi steering wheel, plushed out, gold-leaf phantom top
And three girls waiting
VRRRROOM engine's blowin, the chrome, is shining
Passing all the cars on the way
Movement of the wind, back wheels spin
Pop in a cassette and push play

I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali... hmm, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali... I don't think so

I'm going back to Cali, shakin 'em, bakin 'em
Takin 'em to spots they never before hung
?? the place, on Sunset it's a trip
Where the A.C.'s cold, and the girls still strip
The record skip, but this girl kept dancin
Prancin, grindin, grinnin, romancin
I asked her to the barn, so we could hit the hay
I wanna do this, Brutus, but I don't wanna pay

I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali... hmm, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali

I'm going back to Cali, rising, surprising
Advising realizing, she's sizing me up
Her bikini - small; heels - tall
She said, she liked, the ocean
She showed me a beach, gave me a peach
And pulled out the suntan lotion
Now I thought that was fast, but this girl was faster
She's lookin for a real good time
I said, ""Close your eyes, I got a surprise,""
And I ran away with the bottle of wine

I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali... hmm, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali... I don't think so

Loungin (Who Do Ya Luv),All World,1996.0,"Umm...Go head daddy!
We doing it with L....(Laughs)....Go head baby. Who do ya luv baby?

How you doin', miss? My name is L, I'm from Queens
I heard about your man, he like to lace you with cream
Dolce Gabbana, Moschino with Donna jeans
But he slipped up, and threw his rock to a fiend
He be playin' like a Willie 'cause he dress ya dove
Never knowin' that his woman is in need of love
You got Versace gold link stomach chains with rocks
Official hair style but you stuck up in the spot
Makin love, Duke is weak then he fallin asleep
You on the phone wit your old peeps dyin' to creep 'tween my sheets
So what you got Chanel on your feet
Hot sex on a platter makes the mission complete, uh

Who do you love? (I wanna lounge with you)
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)

Jew-els and Cristal got him actin' funny style
He ain't watchin' you, he rather watch his money pile
Can't protect treasures when it's in a glass house
Soon as he turn the corner I'mma turn that ass out
Full blown, frontin' in the 6 with the chrome
Yo B, why you leave your honey all alone with me?
Just because you blessed with cash
Doesn't mean your honey won't let me finesse that ass
So see the moral of the story is a woman need love
The kind you so-called players never dreamed of
You got to try love, can't buy love
If you play your hand, then it's bye-bye love

Who do you love? (I wanna lounge with you)
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)

Who do you love? Are you for sure? (You know it's you)
Who do you love? Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)

So what you got the cash flow in escrow, damn
But your honey ran away like presto, ala-kazam
Man made the money, money never made the man
You still fakin' jacks throwin' rocks on her hand
See, you put your mack down, now you Nino Brown
Rock roller with so much ice your cap's polar
I got her smokin' beedies, modeling bikinis
Pushin' your whip on the Van Wyck to see me
I keep it steamy, I make it burn when it's my turn
Teaching shorty all the jewels that you never learned
Don't get it twisted, getting money ain't wrong
But she wanna make love all night long, I'm gone

Who do you love? (I wanna lounge with you)
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)

Who do you love? Are you for sure? (You know it's you)
Who do you love? Are you for sure? (Are you for sure?)

The Ripper Strikes Back,UnKnown,1998.0,"We just gon have some fun with hip hop
Ha-ha!
A lil hip hop, that's all
Relax, hold on to ya seats
Haha! Uh-huh!
Oh, yeah, this is the Tunnel banger too!
Word up, this the Tunnel banger, baby
Hip-hop style, baby, y'all remember

By the middle of March, when the pregnancy starts
In your ladies' placenta; that means L just entered
Duct-taped your little bitch-ass for fronting
Your four-eleven crackhead ass ain't hurting nothing
Nigga, you want the fame?
Now, you're famous overnight (Ugh!)
Famous for getting fucked by a stick of dynamite
You're weak, nigga! You bout to die up in your sleep
The overlord of rap will never meet defeat
Pain to agony, I don't touch them zones
Fuck your epileptic lyrical methods! It's my throne
Blast your fifty-pound ass and make you float
You read it, shook nigga! I wrote the book, nigga!
Held down my crown for a decade and a half (half)
Now I'm bout to give your grimy ass a bloodbath
Talking bout being broke? Nigga, I'm rich!
'Cause I learned to separate the money from the bitch (bitch!)
Don't hate me cause I'm paid
Hate me 'cause I'm everything you want to be
Handsome; young; plus, legendary
Talking 'bout Farrakhan
Nigga, you better call Jesse Jackson for some affirmative action

Can-I-Bus? (Yes you can!)
Can-I-Bus? (Yes you can!)
Can-I-Bus? (Yes you can!)
Can-I-Bus? (Yes you can!)
Ugh!

Don't ever open your mouth and mention my seed
Talking 'bout my book you bought to read!
You know you watch my sitcom, nigga, so stop that
Mad rapper, but now you turned mad actor (hahahaha)
Forty-nine pounds and tryin' to be a mobster
Run around town with the Bob Marley impostors
Ask Canibus, he ain't understanding this
Cause ninety-nine percent of his fans don't exist
I'm going underground and blowing your rep down
Next time, save that shit for the Lyricist Lounge
Or a house party, where you can battle some clown
On top of all that, I beat your homeless ass down
Heard that convicted rapist on the record, too (uh-huh)
Fresh out of jail, asscheeks still black and blue (uh-huh! ooooh!)
Tell me 'bout the things Ear-Biter taught you
How to bust a nut or two? (Yeah, that's butter, boo)
You be decomposing, but you frozen because my title's golden
Steady rolling in a world that I'm controlling
Vanguard Awards are for kings who did cause!
Climbed Platinum Mountain, so pray to the Lords!
Talking 'bout my first- and second- and third-born
Now I got a fourth, Canibus, but he cut off
From the riches of my empire, I'm like a pimp
Who thought he had to retire but found a new Can-I-Puss to hire
You're hardcore, in a sense, like Heather Hunter (huh!)
But definitely not with the lyrics that drop thunder
Found you in a trash can
Hot, black, 'cause you scared to bust
Nigga, in Todd we trust!

Can-I-Bus? (Yes you can!)
Can-I-Bus? (Yes you can!)
Can-I-Bus? (Yes you can!)
Can-I-Bus? (Yes you can!)
Now break it down for me!

See I, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat...
Eat amateur MCs!
Hahaha!
This real hip-hop!
Taking it back, baby! On some hip-hop!
Word up, no bullshit (uh-huh)
Oh, I ain't done yet! Haha!
LL Cool J is hard as HELL!

You soft as a newborn baby taking a nap
Made my dick hard with that bitch-ass track
Where you at? Smoking in some one-room flat?
Sucking on Clef's dick, hoping to come back?
Never that! Nigga, my size is unlimited!
Yours is prohibited; of course, that's attributed...
To not knowin ya limits and who you need to test
(When you!) Step into the house of the Lord and get blessed!
Get on your knees; bow down to my decrees
Young slacker, save that demo for Jack the Rapper (yeah)
You gargoyle, slash-olive oil, pussycat
I've wrapped up in aluminum foil, ready to boil
I'mma tear the skin off your ass with ten knuckles
Rhymes was weak
They made me chuckle like a name-buckle (haha!)
You call em lyrics, nigga you need to stop (stop!)
You going out! Ahh, fuck it! You going pop
I feed you a poisonous verse, so don't try it
No more rhyming, you on a lyric-fast diet
Call the paramedic and tell them that he's pathetic
His lyrics ain't energetic; you're sweet as a diabetic
Career be over next year; yeah, I said it
Look over your shoulder, nigga! That's where you headed!
MOTHERFUCKER! Where's a rhyme when you need it?
First rule of lyrical war: Never repeat it
You said that same bullshit at House of Blues
Lit the pipe, dropped the match, and sparked the wrong fuse
Not new! Yeah, nigga, I'm goin at you
Stop basing, and you can be a role model too (*coughs*)
Diss my moms?! Who's the real rap don?
Who ruled for fifteen years and dropped bombs?
Who's copped solid gold Grammys that say ""Todd""?
LL! While you dropped verses at niggas' proms
FAGGOT! You better battle Number Two
Cause Number One got his title locked down, son!
The king of all rappers to ever grace the stage
Or the mic! Best that ever did it; I'm wicked
Write a verse and flip it; melt it down to liquid
And drown shorty; fill his lungs until I rip it
Chest busts open, heart bursts; it's smoking
You see that nigga, son? (Damn L, we was only joking)
Maneuver, manipulate brainwaves, transform
Your thought process, when my pen gets caressed
Warning: all MCs better retreat
Look at Corny-bus! He can't walk down his own street
Better run and get the Fugees (Oh-la-la-la-la)
Cause I EAT, EAT, EAT MCs
Devour they titles, cause I'm an idol-slash-icon
And tell Wyclef: don't even turn his fucking mic on
Soldier, nigga! Thought I told ya, nigga!
Crossover, slam dunk! Game over, nigga! (One more time, son!)
Soldier, nigga! Thought I told ya, nigga!
Crossover, slam dunk! Game over, nigga

Can-I-Bus? (Yes you can!)
Can-I-Bus? (Yes you can!)
Can-I-Bus? (Yes you can!)
Can-I-Bus? (Yes you can!)

Stay in your place! Nah'mean?

(To da break of dawn)
All my effects involved
As we get funky
Problems will resolve
Everybody knows
When it come to a situation like this
Little more effects
And I can't resist
So we get funky in the house
Youknowmsayin?
L.L. Cool J style
But this ain't on a pop tip
Check it out

What is a panther?
 A animal that kills
I'm like a shark with blood comin out the gills
You could never in your wildest dreams
Get a piece of this gangsta lean 
straight from Queens
Strong as liquor, to be seen in a limousine
Now you're gettin done without Vaseline
Wouldn't bite because your rhymes are puppy chow
Made another million, so competitors bow
Homeboy, hold on, my rhymes are so strong
Nothing could go wrong, so why do you prolong
Songs that ain't strong, brother, you're dead wrong
And got the nerve to have them Star Trek shades on
Ha, you can't handle the whole weight
Skin needs lotion, teeth need Colgate
Wise up, you little burnt up french fry
I'm that type of guy
And I slammed you know, just like a sumo
Put him in Pampers
, 
leave my drawers in his hamper
When I'm through, you need a brand-new identity
I was scoopin girls before you lost your virginity
Your jam is just a dreamin MC scheme
Gettin crushed by a L.L. theme
Somethin like Shaft
, put you in a cask' - bo!
You little blood-clot boy, you must not know
The rep I keep, the MC's I peep, sweep, play cheap
And freak with a chic unique technique
Get rid of the yukmouth smile
Cause brother, you ain't got no style

Keep on
(To da break of dawn)
(To da break of dawn)
Yeah
Keep on
(To da break of dawn)
Hey yo, that's kinda funky
But check this out here
(Rock that shit)
(To da break of dawn)
Yeah...

Immaculate styles I use to abuse
MC's, so light the fuse
And spread the news, you lose
To the damager, microphone manager
Cold crush and bruise and bandage a amateur
That amateur swingin a hammer
From a body bag, so run and get your camera
Get a flick of the stiff dead-shot to get swift
But I'm the wrong brother to dance with
Cause I don't need a partner to swing
Keep your eyes on the Cool J ring
Shootin the gift, but you just don't shoot it right
You couldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
Wouldn't throw a rock in a ghost town
So don't try to play post, clown
You know the L.L.'s back in town
And all the wanna-be sherrifs is gettin shot down
Gimme that microphone
I'mma show you the real meaning of the danger zone
Stop dancin, get to walkin
Shut your old mouth when young folks is talkin
Huh, you little snake in the grass
You swing a hammer, but you couldn't break a glass
Gimme a lighter - woof!
Now you're cut loose
From that jherri curl juice
Cool J is back on the map
And when I see ya, I'mma give you a slap
That's right, a little kick for that crap
Cause my old gym teacher ain't supposed to rap

Keep on
(To da break of dawn)
(To da break of dawn)
Yeah
Keep on
(To da break of dawn)
Hey yo, that's kinda funky
But check this out here
(Rock that shit)
(To da break of dawn)
Yeah...

How dare you stand beside me
I'm Cool, I freeze I-c-e
On your trail and I'mma cut that pony tail
You're disobedient with the wrong ingredients
But I'mma drink you down over the rocks
While the freak on your album cover jocks
You're gonna hear a real ill paragraph soon
I took the cover right home to the bathroom
In the immortal words of L.L., 'hard as hell'
Your broad wears it well
She's the reason that your record sold a few copies
But your rhymes are sloppy
Like Oscar,
 and you're bound to get dropped
And stopped, 
I ain't Murray the cop
Nor am I Felix
, 
but I got a bag of tricks
Mr. Pusherman, gimme a fix
So I can show you I'm immune to them 
romper room tunes
You little hip-hop racoon
I'm not Scarface, but I want more beef
Before you rapped you was a downtown car thief
Workin in a parking lot
A brother with a perm deserves to get burned
So tell me how you like your coat cream?
On a cone, in a bowl, or in a wet dream?
With your tv on channel fuzz
Uncle L, that's how much damage he does
Here's 5 dollars, catch a taxi cab
Take your rhymes around the corner to the rap rehab

Keep on
(To da break of dawn)
Yeah
(To da break of dawn)
I say keep on
(To da break of dawn)

Just wanted to funk it up a little bit
My man Pete Rock is up in the crib, youknowmsayin
Over here at Marley Marl house
Just coolin out
My man Clash in the house
Sippin on this Bartles & Jaymes premium peach-flavored wine cooler
Loungin back
Keep on

Pink Cookies In a Plastic Bag Getting Crushed by Buildings,14 Shots to the Dome,1993.0,"The act of makin' love is

Pink cookies in a plastic bag, gettin' crushed by buildings
Pink cookies in a plastic bag, gettin' crushed by buildings

I'll take thirty electric chairs and put 'em in a classroom
Thirty MC's and set 'em free from their doom
Just like a tomahawk cuts through the wind when we begin
The wheel of fortune, it spins
Holdin', the rhythm like elastic moldin'
Your whole body like plastic
So why try to deny what you already know ya love
Up above
Cause the mania, hysteria in the streets
While ya lovers gettin' merrier in the sheets
I met this lady named sweet young thing and
She gave me that feelin' that sunshine bring in
Hoardable, sportable, totally affordable
Silky smooth, voice was real audible
I said your cool as Ice Cube-a
She said, ""you're that Public Enemy I seen on the tube-a.""
Nah, I'm like your Uncle, baby
The style of your beautiful face drives me crazy
Well can we do ya so Heavy, I'm D?
She said, ""You tried to play me like Big Daddy""
I said, ""I know your Tribe I Called and re-Quested
For you to be manifested""
She said, ""You know the Same Gang and my Flava Unit too?""
I said, ""You only knew the certain things I wanna do, do you?""
Rub ya down with warm Ice-T
Make ya feel Brand Nubian instantly
Boogie Down and check this Production
Gimme them lips, they look good for suction

On the side just doin' the fly""
You like pound cake? Come to my house
Turn on the lights and see me on the couch
I said, ""You're jinglin', you're from around the way
I like your earrings: two L's, but anyway...
Your grand-daddy is here to spread cheer
Somethin' nice and smooth with my tongue in your ear
Give me a snack some salt and pepper on a burger
Ice Cream Tea or if you prefer the
Taste of honey Kid, ride in my Capri and
That's the joint they got the real clear CD in
She said, ""Stars couldn't get me in a car
I don't know what type of man ya are
You might know karate, do me and get away
I got a glimpse of your license plate, N-W-A""

Belly to belly and chest to chest
Thigh by thigh, leg by leg and I guess
Ain't no way to get ya out
Your so caught up S-E-X-U-A-L - sort
Of a freaky situation with a peppermint twist
Ricky or Mike is next on the list
Nastified and all-funkified
Come on, come on, come on, ride

And I will appear

With a beer
And bags full of cheer
And waterbed... YEAH!

She said, ""You got to be bad to make the Monie moan.""
Ain't no reason to front
On the way your life shown
Booyaa! How I'm jumpin' your bones
Like a Grandmaster in a Flash
Put out your cigarette and rest your tired ash
All I wanna do is make whoopie
Your my pink cookie
Not a wookie
When you take it off, I'd love a lookie
Cause I'mma mix it up toss style
Peace out, you got the sexual profile

Big Ole Butt,Walking with a Panther,1989.0,"I was at the mall, sipping on a milkshake
Playing the wall, taking a break
Admiring the girls with the bamboo earrings
Baby hair and body's built to swing
That's when I seen her, her name was Tina
Grace and poise kinda like a ballerina
I said how you doing, my name's Big L
Don't ask me how I'm living, cause yo, I'm living swell
But then again I'm living kind of foul
Cause my girl don't know that I'm out on the prowl
To make a long story short, I got the digits
Called her on my car phone and paid her a visit
I was spanking her and thanking her, chewin' her and doin' her
Laughin' because my girl didn’t know that I was screwin' her
Laying like a king on sheets of satin
That's what time it is, you know what's happening
She had a big ole booty, I was doing my duty
I mean yo, I admit that my girl's a cutie
But Tina was erotic, 
Earl's my witness
With the kind of legs that put stockings out of business
When I went home, I kissed my girl on the cheek
But in the back of my mind it was this big butt freak
I sat my girl down, I couldn't hold it in
And said to her with a devilish grin

Tina got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true
But Tina got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you
Tina got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true
But Tina got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you

I went to the high school about three o'clock
To try to catch a cutie riding my jock
My homeboy's jeep, the system blasting
Cold forty dogs
, smiling and laughing
Girls all over, the kind I adore
I felt like a kid in a candy store
That's when I seen her, her name was Brenda
She had the kind of booty that I'd always remember
I said to my man, stop the jeep
She's only seventeen but yo don't sleep
I kicked the bass like an NFL punter
And scoped the booty like a big game hunter
I said to the girl, yo, you look tired
Let's go get some rest, relax by the fire
I put the big booty on a bearskin rug
She gave me a kiss, I gave her a hug
I said to the girl, them young boys ain't nothing
You want to get freaky, let me kiss your belly button
I circled it and teased it and made her squeal
Grabbed a pack of bullets and pulled out the steel
When I was through, I wiped the sweat from my eyes
When to the kitchen and got some sweet potato pies
Tina busted in my house while I was eating
You know what I said
Too bad you caught me cheating but

Brenda got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true
But Brenda got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you
Brenda got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true
But Brenda got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you

I went to Red Lobster for shrimp and steak
Around the time when the waitresses are on their lunch break
I pulled in the parking lot and parked my car
Somebody shouted out, I don't care who you are
I paid it no attention, I walked inside
Because Brian had a nine and he was chilling in the ride
I walked in the place, everybody was looking
And shrimp and steak wasn't the only thing cooking
I sat down to eat, ordered my food
I said to the waitress, I don't men to be rude
But I'll take you on a platter
She said you got a girl, I said it don't matter
You look like you're tastier than a piping hot pizza
What's your name, she said my tag says Lisa
I said, O.K., you're smart and all that
But when you get off work, yo, I'll be back
She looked at me and said make yourself clear
L where we going, I said right here
She looked kind of puzzled, I said you'll see
I pulled up at ten on the D-O-T
When she walked out the door, I threw my tongue down her throat
Pushed her back inside and pulled off her coat
Laid her on the table and placed my order
And gave her a 
tip much bigger than a quarter
On and on to the break'a dawn
All over the restaurant, 
word is bond
I heard somebody coughing, I checked my watch
I couldn't believe it said nine o'clock
I grabbed my pants, put on my Kangol
Who did I see, oh yo it was Brenda
Yo she worked at Red Lobster but I didn't remember

Lisa got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true
But Lisa got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you - see ya
Lisa got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true
But Lisa got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you - see ya",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-big-ole-butt-lyrics

Nightgown draggin on the heated marble floor
Flash Cartier when you open up the door - slide these on baby
So butter, still relate to the gutter

Fell in love with a cat who's gifted
Turn you back to paradise, damn I missed it
Pop a bottle, light a purple candle

Belly to belly, one hand on the jelly
At the telly on the celly - get that money Elle
Please believe it, if the mind can conceive it
Then the man can achieve it; you gotta breathe it
And I breathe deep, I'm one with the universe
Minimum, ten percent go to God first
Lay back baby, close your eyes
Ice on the pinky finger froze your thighs

Deepest Bluest (Shark’s Fin),Deep Blue Sea: Music From The Motion Picture,1999.0,"Uh, my hat is like a shark's fin

Deepest, bluest, my hat is like a shark's fin
Deepest, bluest, my hat is like a shark's fin
Manmade terror
Hungry jaws of death
Y'all don't cross my depths
I'll pause your breaths
I cause you to sink down forty thousand leagues
Bleeding to death with no arms and short sleeves
My world's deep blue
Killers gotta eat too
Looking for human flesh to rip my teeth through
Other fish in the sea but Barracudas ain't equal
To a half-human predator created by a needle
Jet black eyes baby they stare while you sleep
When your Titanic sinks I'm the one you gon' meet
Hearing terrified screams they surround my team
All you see is trails of blood
Even God won't intervene
Nightmares of darkness
My apetite is heartless
Even if we related, you eliminated regardless
In the deep blue, underwater walls
Half man, half shark
My jaws don't fall

Our Father who art in Heaven
Hallowed be Thy name
Killers sworn to beast
Swallowed them in flames
They switched my DNA
Trip me into Cool J
I can't fight the feeling
I'm born to kill prey
To survive an attack
There's only one way
Battle to the death
That's how sharks play
Weapons left behind
We dueling with the mind
You blind, crippled, or crazy
You're real easy to find
Struggling to flow with hemorrhages in your throat
Getting the lap dance while I smash through your boat
Eat your whole fam'
Nothing left but a right hand
Clinging to a rail
Escape, attempts fail
You'll never make it home
Tear the flesh off your bone
Walking in undercurrents is a dangerous zone
I'm talking death out a moment's notice
You wasn't focused
Me and my crew strike
Like some underwater locusts

Uh, uh take it deeper
Uh, uh take it deeper
These waters are waist level
The hallway's flooded
Lost your scuba gear
The killer's cold-blooded
His name's LL
You don't really want it
I ate your ancestors
The ocean is haunted
I'm closing in cause I'm supposed to win
How the cold steel feel when it froze your chin
Should have stayed on dry land
Stroke while you can
Cause now you under pressure in the land of the damned
Abandoned pirate ships
Eels and sod scum
Fish that glow in the dark
The Titanic's hub
Underwater storms
Your blood is so warm
Your life vest is off
And that turns me on
Killer for centuries
The Gotti of the deep
In the next millennium
I'm still gonna creep
Sand under my belly, ocean over my head
Through the light in the shadows
You become the living dead

Jack the Ripper,Walking with a Panther,1989.0,"Milky, and I'm back
My ace in the hole was this brand new track
I'mma slow it up and speed it up and now you're gonna eat it up
Listen to the funky beat, my tongue is gonna beat it up
I did it, but the devil didn't make me
I did it for the suckers who tried to shake and bake me
Proving a point that I'm a serious joint
You can roll me up and puff me, and then I'll anoint
Your head with oil--lots of oil
Make it run like water, watch it boil
Cause I made 'em play it, made 'em say it
Made 'em okay it, made 'em obey it---HUH
Prince of the growl is on the prowl
How You Like Me Now punk? You living foul
Here's what my game is, kill is what my aim is
A washed up rapper needs a wash up, my name is--

Jack the Ripper
Jack-Jack-Jack the Ripper
Jack-Jack, Jack-Jack, Jack-Jack, Jack the Ripper
(King Hercules!)

Back for the payback, I must say that
I heard your new jam, I don't play that
It ain't loud enough punk, it ain't hitting
This year you tried, next year you're quitting
Last year you thought I was dying out
But again, and again, and again without a doubt
It's the gangster boogie, the earthquake sound
Pump it up and play it so they hear it all around
I do it up rough, tough, I don't bluff
And this is an example of funky stuff
When you wanna make hits, you make 'em like this
They ain't like this they don't hit, they miss
It's a strong record, a record for the strong
For those who appreciate real rap songs
Listen how I won't allow myself to go off track
Stay back, I got the power, I'm--

Jack the Ripper
Jack-Jack-Jack the Ripper
Jack-Jack, Jack-Jack, Jack-Jack, Jack the Ripper
(King Hercules!)

Jack the Ripper, a man, not a myth
A-k-a James Todd Smith
Hard like penitentiary steel
Breaking necks while I flex my sex appeal
Homegirls in the house, c'mon
Homegirls in the house, give it up
You gotta want to get hotter
Moving and grooving, and always improving a lot'a
People don't know how nice I am
He was sleeping, so now I gotta slice my man
Like ham in a pan, wrap him up in Saran
Kidnap him and slap him up inside of a van
While you're doing your dance I want you to make moves
No one out there thought you could do
You know my name and my game and what I'm here to do
Party people, lemme see if you can dance to--

Jack the Ripper
Jack-Jack-Jack the Ripper

Break it down! x3
Yo Bob, show that old school sucker punk what real hip hop is boy

""How Ya Like Me Now?"" I'm getting busier
I'm double platinum, I'm watching you get dizzier
Check out the way I say my, display my fame, my
'J' on the back, behind the Cool, without the A-Y
I love to ride the groove because the groove is smooth
It makes me move and I'll improve
As it goes on, as it flows on
When you see me, don't ask if the show's on
How that sound? Don't came around, playing me close, brown
Pull on my jock to be down
You need to stay down, way down, because you're low down
Do that dance, the prince of rap is gonna throw down
Aiming to please while I'm killing emcees
I'm gonna keep on hitting you with rough LP's
Day after day after day
You're smacked in the face by the bass of Cool J
I'm--
""Jack the Ripper!"" ""The baddest around!""

I'm a beast on the microphone, a night stalker
A killing machine, a savage street talker
Jason with an axe, but I put it on wax
To eradicate the suckers who thought I had relaxed
The prince of Hip Hop, straight from Queens
Kicking it mean, keeping it clean
And you've never seen anybody rock the party
All you funky beat-aholics, this beat's Bacardi
I go to the show, and terrorize emcees, don't you know
Moving my hand like I'm playing the piano
Don't touch the dial, don't change the channel
Don't let me hear you say I ain't debonair
I'm better than any emcee out there
As a matter of fact, suckers can't compare

Cheesy Rat Blues,Mama Said Knock You Out,1990.0,"(Nothing can save ya
Nothing can save ya
Nothing can save ya
*scratched* Nothing)
Just throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
Keep 'em there
Yo, run the jewels, run the jewels, run the jewels
(Can you feel it?)

I used to be rollin' like a millionaire
Cash in a flash, bankroll to spare
Homeboys hangin', champagne and girls
Got my main woman diamonds, my mistress pearls
Everybody laughin' at my corny jokes
I was stupid; I thought that they were sincere folks
It turned out they liked the money and the fame
If I ain't get paid, I'd be 'that nobody James'
The nobody, who dreamed about bein' somebody
Chief rocker at the party
And they was hangin' like, ""Yo, I'm your man
I don't even care about the ring on your hand""
We'd go out to eat and chill
But they would go to the bathroom when it was time to pay the bill
I didn't notice all the chuckles and laughter
Too busy with a female tellin' me I'm the master
I was slick like, ""Huh, do I know you?
I got play, here, let me show ya""
Used to have a girl that was on the ball
When the cash flow got low, so did her calls
Used to have a homeboy, always chillin'
My cash went low, he told me I was illin'
And don't call 'cause he don't hang with derelicts
Broke with no cash, yo, I was in the mix
Everybody stepped 'cause my pocket wasn't fat
My girl got a new man, I fixed his flat
I'm the one that they're laughin' at
They say, ""Cheesy rat, you ain't all that""

(Can you feel it?)
(Can you feel it?)
(Can you feel it?)
(Can you feel it?)

I mean crabbin', played out by backstabbin'; I feel like tyin'
A anchor to my ankle and jumpin' right in the ocean
'Cause I'm ashy and I can't afford lotion
So-called friends in the jewelry store
Told me, ""Todd, come back when you get off tour""
Souped as hell, I really regret it
Now the only thing I got in my pocket is bad credit
How can a man like me
Be walkin' around in a world of misery?
And if women like a man with a body, it's not mine
'Cause they be walkin' past me like I'm a stop sign
My homeboys laugh when they pass the forty
Sayin, ""Todd, as if he used to have a sporty""
The Benz was slammin', the Jeep was pumpin'
Ain't that somethin'?
I just laugh and say so what I was rich
When I walk away, it's like ain't this a
Kick in the rear, that I'm standin' here
And can't afford a tissue for my tear
Should I drink wine and brandy
Or get a job puttin' stripes on candy
Or put a hole in donuts?
'Cause when you're broke, your middle name is ""so-what?""
I had to learn in an incredibly fast way
When you ain't got no money they treat you like an ashtray
I pawned all my jewelry and clothes
Right after that, I got dissed by all the hoes
That I thought was mine, but really never was
Soon the whole neighborhood got the buzz
That my tank was on ""E"", and that means empty
That Twinkie looks good, so mister don't tempt me
Everybody thought I was trippin'
I rode the back of the bus, but my grip kept on slippin'
I'm the man that they're laughin' at
They say, ""Cheesy rat, you ain't all that""

(Can you feel it?)
(Can you feel it?)
(Can you feel it?)
(Can you feel it?)

I wanna hang with my man like, ""Let's do this""
But this man like ""Who this?""
That's right, the brother got two faces
They got me puttin' the tips on shoelaces
P on the Puma, a mop and a bucket
My motto is... I don't care
I don't give a damn, so what, why try?
I might as well rob some Blake Carrington sucker for his money
It's so funny
Cars ride by with the boomin' system
Sayin, ""Leave him alone, my man already dissed him""
Now I'm on the cheeseline, poverty-stricken
As the red tape thickens
I go to the park, they wanna baseball-bat me
I go to the mall, they throw my old tapes at me
I'm so horny
And every girl I know be like, ""He's so corny""
I want money in a hurry
I'm gettin' tired of leftover curry
I wanna fall off, but I don't know where the edge is
I'm so hungry, I eat my neighbor's hedges
Now I realize I gotta go for mine
It's windshield time
I take quarters, pennies, dimes and nickles
And a kiddy's tricycle
I'm a desperado
""I'ma steal your rims"" is my motto
I watch wrestlin' until I'm dizzy sore
So if you're cashin' your rent check, know how to get busy
Go to the drive-through, run with a milkshake
Go to the supermarket, pocket a raw steak
I need beer
I'ma catch the Miller truck out there
You know how they throw, the newspapers in the morning
The owner don't want em
I'm the man that they're laughin' at
They say, ""Cheesy rat, you ain't all that.""

(Can you feel it?)
(Can you feel it?)
(Can you feel it?)
(Can you feel it?)

So yo, one more time, one more time
Party people in the house tonight
Just throw your hands in the air
And wave em like you just don't care
Keep em there

Just wanna feel ya touch
Everything will be ok
If you do it my way (my way, my way)

You feel so good
Rest of my life I wish I could
Hold you tight and take a flight out the hood
Was I foul or just misunderstood?
Mild-mannered or up to no-good
It really doesn't matter, either way I should
Maximize the moment and hold ya close
Jump in the drop Spider and cruise down the coast
Who loved you the most?
I was never ghost
When lives was on the line
Confusion in ya mind
Runnin outta time
Drama of all kind
But there's faith in our mind
We're spiritually inclined
Sometimes I flip
Sometimes you flip
Sometimes we wild out and act like lunatics
We movin too fast, the whole world's in a rush
Everybody just hush..

If you wanna come and play
Gotta do it my way

Just wanna feel ya touch

If you do it my way (my way, my way)

Its all a test; the pain, the drama
The villa in the bahamas
The highs, the lows
The hooptie, the Rolls
The money flowin
Certain doors that we go in
The people we meet, the hands that we shake
Whether its Morton's or Sizzler steak
But everything will be okay
 if we do it my way
Cuz I believe in romance
Kissin while ya slow dance
Me bouncin baby? no chance
No matter the circumstance
Whatever it takes gurl, ill swim to France
Cuz ya beauty's unmatched
Such a great catch
Unconditional love, forever we are attatched
Deal with the drama, we can find our way back
With or without the Maybach..

This is how its gonna go
If you wanna come and play
Gotta do it my way
Hush baby, dont talk so much
Just wanna feel ya touch
Everything will be ok

I can feel ya pain
Like we siamese twins connected by our brains
Walkin thru the desert in the ice cold rain
Want you in my life and nothing's gonna change
God willin, we still be doin our thang
When my six-pack's faded
Raps outdated
But thats many years from now so don't rush
Little mama just hush..

Cause he's so-so, I got the instinct
They call me Deputy Dog, now put your ass in the clink
Innovating, devastating, and dope on the single, now
Let me see your earrings jingle

(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby

I chopped you, chewed you, baked you and {fucked} you
That {shit} you pop, you need to stop, you're kind of rude you
No good {niggaboo} tryin' to base
How we livin' homes? Get out my face!
I'm complete, in effect, and I can't fall
I rise, suprise, and I advise you all
To stand back and peep, don't sleep or doubt
My skill'll get ill, I turn the mother out
I'm top-notch, you're still playin' hop-scotch
Now I'ma do ya while the party people watch
You're real funny, you really try to go for yours
But I know why: you ain't had no dough before
So you tried and lied to drain my fame
This ain't a game, yo, you know my name
Forget all the MC's who like to mingle
Yo baby, let me see your earrings jingle

(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby

When you first walked in, I ain't know what to think
You grabbed the microphone like your shit don't stink
And tried to run down that; I can't get over that
Shit you were sayin' - you call that a battle rap?
How you gonna go against an army with a handgun?
I'm Cool J, yo you don't understand, son
I'm a legend, on top of that I'm livin'
Now you look stupid like that bitch Ms. Givens
Whoever geesed you up; nah, how should I say it?
Whoever set you up, they knew just how to play it
Cause man, YO, I feel for you brother
I'm a baaaaaad... (Word to the mother!)
Takin out suckers while the ladies pucker
And rollin' over niggas like a redneck trucker
Innovatin', devastatin', and dope on a single, now
Lemme see your earrings jingle

(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby

Yeah baby, you know what I mean?
You like be jinglin crazy, word
(yeah yeah yeah)
All over this funky beat
You be like jinglin', and your earrings be jinglin'
And shakin all over the place and all (mm-hmm)
It's like real, it's real wild to me honey yaknahwhatImean?
The way you be jinglin', worrrrrrd

(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby

Can't believe you tried to grip the same mic as me
Your grip's too weak, you can't hold it, B
You can dream of makin' progress and gettin' this nice
But when I roll up, it's like Hip Hop Vice
I serve to curbs, I never swerve I'm superb
Every word you heard played tricks on your nerves
You played your hand, lost track of your plan
When I show up, I blow up, end of story, my man
I'm a play you like a poker chip, that's what you get
I bet your fret, sweat, and regret you met
The titan of fightin', excitin' when writin', you triflin' toy-boy
I gotta enlighten, so start bitin'
You know you can't create and get mean like this
When I'm on the court, G, it's strictly SWISSSSHHHH!
When it's all over, said and done, my friend
They say, ""That {bad motherfucker} just scored again""
So take a step back, give me some room to wreck shop
Here's your token back, you're gettin' off at the next stop
I'ma deliver and give a speech with vigor
I drink some Olde E and start waxin {niggas}

The Boomin’ System,Mama Said Knock You Out,1990.0,"Just kick a little something for them cars that be bumping
Yeah, aight, but we need a beat that they can front to
Oh, that'll work, be funky
You know what I'm sayin'?
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
Funky
(Cars ride by)
For all the cars out there
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
And all the brothers
That like to front in their rides
(Cars ride by)
Check it out

You know it's funky, funky, funky 'cause you heard it from hearsay
A jam that you love that don't be gettin' no airplay
Strictly for frontin' when you're ridin' around
12 o'clock at night with your windows down
Headlights breakin' 'cause your batteries drain
Armor All on your tires and a big gold chain
Parkin outside of all the hip-hop spots
Push the E-Q and play connect the dots
Leanin to the side, people everywhere
The trunk full of amps, there ain't no room for a spare
Big beats bumpin' with the bass in back
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack
'Cause they don't understand why I act this way
Pumpin' up the funky beat until the break of day
It's because I want attention when I'm ridin' by
And the girls be on my jock 'cause my system's fly

(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)

Girlies wanna ride with a brother like me
'Cause they be hear me gettin' funky frequently
They tell me don't drink and drive, I say what is this
Mind your business
Now pass it around
Laid back, hypnotized by the funky sound
People in the street see me bobbin my head
While I'm checkin' out the rapper and the rhyme that he said
I'm frontin', and I don't care if you know
The backseat of my car is like a disco show
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone
Crazy air freshener, who needs cologne?
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top
Cruise, it's 3 o'clock
The girlies, they smile, they see me comin'
I'm steady hummin, 
I got the Funky Drummer drumming
My trunk be shakin', vibratin' and rattlin'
Pumpin so loud, all the shorties be babblin'
My right-hand man's here without the swing
Every chance I get I'm showin' off my rings
I can keep it up until the break of dawn
'Cause I'm frontin' in my ride and my word is bond

(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)

Sunroof open, so I can feel the wind blow
I don't give a damn if it cracks my back window
C to the O to the O to the L to the I to the N
To the F to the R to the O to the N to the T to the I to the N
That means I'm chillin'
Like Spoonie Gee said, my seats are soft like a bed
They recline way back, so I can get real cozy
I got the gangster tapes in the place
Like a basehead would say: I want 
BASS
I want a hit, I want a dose
You're rollin' up smilin', but you can't come close
'Cause my system is pumpin' loud
Like Rakim said: I wanna move the crowd
I warm it up with Kane
, 
fight the power with PE
Tell the cops: 
you gots to chill with EPMD
This is something devastatin' that'll break your trunk
And remember, Uncle L is like the future of the funk

(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)

You know what I'm sayin', word
So next time you're in your ride pumpin' it up
Just remember
It's cool

I’m That Type of Guy,Walking with a Panther,1989.0,"You're the type of guy that can't control your girl
You try to buy her love with diamonds and pearls
I'm the type of guy that shows up on the scene
And gets the seven digits, you know the routine
You're the type of guy that tells her, ""Stay inside""
While you're steady frontin in your homeboy's ride
I'm the type of guy that comes when you leave
I'm doin your girlfriend, that's somethin you can't believe
'Cause

I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy

You're the type of guy that gets suspicious
I'm the type of guy that says, ""The puddin' is delicious""
You're the type of guy that has no idea
That a sneaky, freaky brother's sneakin' in from the rear
I'm the type of guy to eat it, when he won't
And lick you in the places that your boyfriend don't
You're the type of guy to try to call me a punk
Not knowin' that your main girl's bitin' my chunk
I'm the type of guy that loves a dedicated lady
Their boyfriends are boring, and I can drive 'em crazy
You're the type of guy to give her money to shop
She gave me a sweater. Thank you, sweetheart

I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy

I'm the type of guy that picks her up from work early
Takes her to breakfast, lunch, dinner, and breakfast
You're the type of guy eatin' a TV dinner
Talkin 'bout... ""Goddamn it, I'ma kill her""
I'm the type of guy to make her say, ""Why you illin', B?""
You're the type of guy to say, ""My lower back is killin' me""
Catch my drift?
You're the type of guy that likes to drink Olde English
I'm the type of guy to cold pour 'n pamper
You're the type of guy to say, ""What you talkin' 'bout?""
I'm the type of guy to leave my drawers in your hamper

I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
You know what I mean?
Check it out...

T-y-p-e g-u-y
I'm that type of guy to give you a pound and wink my eye
Like a bandit, caught me redhanded, took her for granted
But when I screwed her, you couldn't understand it
Cause you're the type of guy that don't know the time
Swearin' up and down, ""That girl's all mine""
I'm the type of guy to let you keep believin' it
Go 'head to work, while I defrost it, and season it

I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy, know what I mean
I'm that type of guy
""So ridiculous!""

So funny
I don't know

Phenomenon,Phenomenon,1997.0,"Ah ah
Baby girl was draped in Chanel
Said she love 2Pac but hates some LL
Seen her at the bar with anklets and toe rings
She can take a prince, turn him into a king
I was looking at her in the limelight, pearly whites
Said her man get paper but he don't live right
All these emotions flowing inside the club
Do you really want a thug or do ya want love?
She gets the paper when it's time to get it
She keep these clowns sinkin' like Chappaquiddick
Honey smoke make you click, feel it in their throats
No joke, all these love letters they wrote
Behind every playa is a true playette
Bounce you up, outta there, push eject
Taster's choice, have you nice and moist
Or play paper games or floss the Rolls Royce

Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon

You was king of seduction, cop a suction
Now she with a cat that worked construction
You wanna starve her with the paper, abuse her mind
This a new lover, when you know it's on mine
That's on top, lap dancin' got to stop
You play out your chick cause your game is hot
I give you two, Italian iced my whole crew
Piece banging on my chest 'til I'm black and blue
You beefin', yellin' on the cell of my 6
You reachin', then you hear the cordless click
Now your club hopping, keep the Cristal poppin'
Use my chips and take the next man shoppin'
Hell no, must be out ya mind
Got you on your knees and your elbows each and every time
That's why I love you mami, you
Run your mouth, throw your legs over the bed baby
Work me out

You was all souped up, but played it just right
Mami I was full blown, my game was airtight
I needed to switch up and get it in gear
It's a whole new movie, a world premiere, yeah yeah
Keep it jinglin', no more minglin'
A brand new year, me and you can bring it in
I was sick and tired of the freakin', night to morn'
Bonin' in the mirror with my Cubans on
Let bygones be bygones, no more games
Hope all the chickenheads go up in flames
Now we in the brand new mansion, with the lake in back
Got it all figured out, mami I like that
Collect tips, cop his and her whips
To waste a quarter mil on clothes is sick
But you're worth it playgirl, it's real in the field
Say what you want, but keep your lips sealed

Met this little girl she was off the hook
I got cold chills when her body shook
Hot sex on the platter, no need to cook
I let her steal my heart like a horny crook
Had her grinding and winding against my leg
She messin with my head, wanna play in the bed
Sexy pumps on, toenails red
Your body's a gun baby, pump me full of lead
It hard to hold you when you moving vulgar
Peace sign on your eyes like John Travolta
My Pulp ain't Fiction, it's an addiction
To see your booty clap on the floor in the kitchen
Nasty girl, taught me all the lingo
While mama play bingo, she ride mandingo
She don't give a damn if I'm married or single
She makes me tingle, shorty I'm your

She likes hip-hop and R&B
Her lifetime goal is to be on TV
She looking for a man that could give her a break
Like Usher or Justin Timberlake
I'm really not sure if her breasts are fake
Cause with whipped cream on 'em, they taste just like cake
We drink some beer inside of daddy's '64
She shot me in the back with cupid's arrow
We finish the 6-pack, she push the seat back
Pulled up her dress and she let me peep that
I'm drunk as a skunk,
 feeling all dirty
Truck stop bathroom at 7:30
Bought her some dessert, give a damn if it's early
Head spinning around like roller derby
Everything about her says you dont deserve me
I hope I'm worthy, cause shorty I'm your

Cause I'm your baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby

You need something like me? (Yeah!)
Cause he ain't nothing like me (No!)
You can search but you never gon' find (No!
A love that's quite like mine (No!)
Need a man that can love you good
And treat you like he should
With me shorty you the shit
He might be good but he ain't like this
Cause I'm your baby

In the back of the pickup clothing ripped up
She see my chrome wheels, it gets more real
Running and laughing, music blasting
Side over the road bent over crashing
Mouth all dry, I can feel the urge
If you see my mama, dont say a word
The cops wanna know why my words are slurred
Don't ask me officer ask hurr
""Wanna another drink baby?"" She like, ""Sure""
""Wanna hit the club?"" 
She like, ""I dont curr""
She all in the rear-view doing her hurr
Hairspray and lip gloss everywhurr
This all happens on an average day
Your life is a trip girl, I'm here to stay
Never had a girl make me feel this way
Even though I had to pay, shorty I'm your

Cause I'm your baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby

It was crowded at the entry (Woo!)
I slide right through like how I do

She said her name Shayeeda
I could tell her mama feed her (Yeah!)
When they tight and thick them jeans don't fit
I'm L, nice to meet ya (Uh-oh!)
I could feel my body yearning

Temptation is a mother
How we lust for one another (Yeah)
We barely know each other
Yet we're wilding like we're lovers

The hustlers throw cashin'
The bartender keeps splashin'

Her gaze was so hypnotic
I begged this girl to stop it
But she continued to pop it
You know I know you like it
Let me hit you on your Sidekick
Because the after party is at my body
Meet me you're invited

Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna

She licked, off, her lip, gloss
Her hips, tossed, back, and forth
Side, to side, and up, and down
She touched, the ground, it turned, me out
I'm battling desire
Lord help me douse this fire
This internal inferno
Hotter than a shot of Cuervo
Her top was short and purple
Belly dancing in a circle
When I feel like this I can't resist
Stop it don't make me hurt you

(where at?) back seat of my jeep

Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an ep'

I'm pullin' over near your building
I light a candle on the dashboard, we're chillin'
I knew a girl like you would love a scene like this
You got class but deep down you're real freakish
You got it all, but you never had a wild episode
That's when me and my jeep showed
Up with the funk in the trunk and
Hittin' it, we're spunkin'
I'll even get you drunk and tipsy
Cause I know you're feelin' frisky
You love it cause it's wild and risky
You got your eyes on the hood
You're up to no good
I took you in the back, you hoped I would
You got your black on black so stacked in the back
While I'm pumpin' it the CD will skip a track
Windows are foggy
And, uh, back seat treats in the streets could be a hobby
And you ain't in between the Isley Brothers' sheets
I give it to you real raw in the backseat
That's how you want it, don't ya? (yeah)
You'll tell your girlfriends, won't ya? (nah)
Don't lie
Take it in your eye (Why?)
So buckle up, buckle up
What's my name? what's my name? what's my name? what's my name? huh
I never knew a four-wheel drive could be so live
I'll put your numbers in the archives
So take 'em off, and put them things on the mirror girl
It's my jeep and your world
You got it going on lovely, time to do the right thing
Cause I can tell you wanna swing

Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an ep'

We're bonin' on the dark blocks
Wearin' out the shocks, wettin' up the dashboard clock
Seats full of sweat, I told ya I would get it
Your kitty, kitty, cat, cat, was hungry so I fed it
Workin' as a team
Somebody, anybody (scream)
Jump with me to the casbah
I'll be like Bruce Lee in them skins goin' ""waahhh""
Damn, it's so good, the mad grip on my tip
You're still a nice girl but my jeep makes ya flip
You go wild and stick your toes on the roof (yeah yeah)
You're so cute, wit' your gold tooth
Extensions on the carpet
That nice round brown is my target
It's so firm, so cushy, it makes me feel mushy
I love it when it's pushy
But don't laugh, I'm serious with this (word up)
The back seat of my jeep is priceless
You're climaxin', you're climaxin', it's full action
You love a good waxin', it's so relaxin'
Ahhh, give me a hug
See what I'm sayin' love?

Rock the Bells (Original),UnKnown,1985.0,"Rumor has it that you're tired of my scratchin' and drums
And of couse I wanna expand to the maximum
So I injected one more element to that of L.L
Came up with something' funky called Rock the Bells
During this episode vocally I explode
My title is the king of the FM mode
See,My volume expands to consume
And my structures emote a lyrical heirloom
Vocally pulsating, I initiate gyrating
Ya must respond to my bells, there's no waiting
For the duration, there's no articulation
Receiving ovation for the bell association
The vocalization techniques I employ
The voice of my shadow could dust a toy boy
The injection of bells into this beat
The result: enough energy to amputate your feet
Greater insulator microphone dominator
My name is Cool J, manipulator innovator
Connoisseur, I'm sure my percussion will excite
These bells are gonna rock all night
Rock the bells
The bells make your energy escalate
A sort of musical fury L.L. might detonate
Subject matter entitled ""The Bells""
The lyrical arrangement is by L.L
My program strains the tympanic membrane
I've been ordained the BLZ I'll flame
Paragraphs I concoct, Cut Creator's like an organist
Cool J exists as a journalist
I illuminate over any number on the Richter
My throat contracts like a boa constrictor
You're totally engulfed by the structure and the format
It's not dormant, it goes to the cornerman
As you repent, you'll say I win
To torture individuals for exitement
Ambassador, the 
Thane of Cawdor
Dialect so def, it'll rip up the floor
Ignite and excite with verbal extensions
What I'll mention will put you on pension
Makin' you tremble, nothin' resemble
The bells and if it does
I'll disassemble
Hit if you bit
I go have a fit
The master impresario of lyrical wit
A hip-hop creature, concert feature
Amateur teacher, my rhymes reach ya
When I commence with excellence
It eradicates levels of pestilence
Upon a plateau
No mortal can go
Mythological characters stand below
Rock the bells
A B-boy symphony complete with bells
No classical fanatic is parallel
From the design of my lyrics many people call me
An immortalized B-boy prodigy
Eeee a misdemeanor, cleaner women I subpoena
No conjecture in my lecture, name and adversary Gina
Promoter, my tune revolves like rotor
Whilst I decode-a the cranium of Yoda
Rehearsing steadily, growing I sing tweeters, mid-range
And woofers need guarding
The bells rip your auditory canal
Plagiarism is suicide for then I shall
Be forced to assault
Opposition will halt
Upset you with words
Drink your blood like it's a malt
Opposite of illusions
Evidently it's true
The beat metabolism supposed to accelerate you
Hallucinating severe convulsion
Your equilibrium is took from my propolsion
I came here tonight to rock
These bells will never stop
Rock the Bells
Ya livin' on my live side
Autographs I sign
Inferior fan-recorder of my rhyme
Perfect spectator, well I'm the dominator
You reline and refine, it and you save it for later
Swipe it as you type it
You recite it as you bite it
Then you claim it as your own to get them excited
About it as you shout it
You don't tell them how go it
And you repeat it and rock it
Multiply it, divide it, ya even sit inside it
It's L.L.'s rhyme, I know ya wanna bite it
You announce, I pounce, destroy, annihilate
If you break, you'll be straight when I eliminate
You study like scholars even write 'em on your collars
You'll buy em and you'll try even for a million dollars
I get like a leopard, attack, ransack, disturb, cold crush
Use a line, I make 'em hush
The lovers in the taker, faker, lovers of the Lakers, simulator
Rap traitor,l perfect perpetrator
To see ya as you bite the words
You'd think you never heard
The mic sings like a hummin' bird
Rock the Bells
Jack the Ripper
King Hercules
Professor of Death in the Seven Seas
Grim reaper of rhyme
Holder of the rock
Eradicating suckers all around the clock
The supreme machine
A microphone dream
My revenge is brutal when you start to scheme
I mean, you're my adversary, I enjoy the few
The Peruvian rock, cocaine or quaalude
The story, the beginning of your death is heard
But your cries are ignored by the kind of word
I'm the super insane murderer in the reign
Like a vampire goin' for your jugular vein
Exterminating crews with my manuscript
And the best thing you wrote was a bunch of bullshit
The night of the nights
You're my victim tonight
You ain't nothin' nobody so get outta any sight
Bein' crushed by the source
It's reinforced (thoughts)
Now ya feel remorse cause ya know who's boss
L.L. Cool J is your undertaker
Def hit-maker plus a bone-breaker
Treble terminator, bass mutilator
You can drop your drawers, I'm a rapper castrator
On the microphone you will never recoup
When I'm finished with you, boy, you'll be suckin' on soup
Music virtuoso, melodical employer
I knew you was a sucker, first time I saw ya
Roll the red carpet, royalty's arrived
Don't try to fight back cause you won't survive
So don't never ever in any kind of weather
Try to mess with the tall young legend in leather
L.L. servin' 'em well
The beat elevates and the scratch excels

No More,UnKnown,2011.0,"We need to have a conversation

I made you, why would I play you?
Trade home base for a California angel
Swing at a fast bitch, foul out betray you
When I won't even wanna hit it in a day or two
Straight home I'd run, well that's debatable
I can't front, I hit a slump, all players do
But tough times are minor, to a major dude
We all lose sometimes, I call it paying dues
Now you're searching other clubs for what's available
A year ago my slot was unassailable
My feast is a famine without you to cater to
If these walls could talk, what would they say to you?

Don't understand what we're going though
But it's like you don't know me
And I don't know you, no more
Not no more!
And it's like, damn how the hell we get here?
No idea, but we're not what we were before
Could it be that I don't love you
And you don't love me no more?
That girl don't live here, not no more!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that girl no more!

The dining room has an empty chair
The mirrored staircase has an empty stair
House full of company, but no ones here
We're saying cheers while we're holding back tears
To keep up appearances in front of our peers
We play holiday card tricks every year
Black jack, poker, make the joker disappear
The ace can't breathe when there's tension in the air
Three clubs in one night, but nobody cares
Cause it's still not a full house without a pair
You tipped your hand, but the text wasn't clear
You're dealing from the bottom queen of hearts, play fair!


Slip in the door, you hold my hopes so
All I hear is love don't live here anymore
We can tear the house down or build some scaffold
We're sitting on a fence, so where you wanna go?
You're the architect of your life, it's your show
You create the blueprint and how the rooms flow
Before you burn the house down, think, take it slow
Even arsonists needs shelter, let me know!",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-no-more-lyrics
Ain’t Nobody,All World,1996.0,"Oh my God, you know

I'm the best when it comes to makin' love all night
Throw your butterscotch body beneath the red light
Blaze it up girl, I'ma lace it real tight
Go deep 'til the full moon turn to sunlight
'Til the darkness is gone love remains strong
Like the bond between mother and child, you're so warm to the touch
Passionate interludes is such
When your gone, your body's what I yearn to clutch
Just imagine ecstasy floatin' in a cloud
Animal attraction burnin' through the crowd
Heaven on Earth, paradise for a price
It's cool though, I'll pay it for the rest of my life, you know why

Ain't nobody does me better
Makes me happy, makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody does me better
(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh)
(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh)
(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh)

I'm explorin' your body and your erogenous zones
Like a black tiger caged up, 'til you come home
Lovely, you make a man swoon like a boy
The love is so soft, it gets hard to enjoy
Cause the mind flies, and sometimes the sex lies
Smooth little girls fall in love with rough guys
But you can chop a big heart down to pint size
I guess that's what it sounds like when the dove cries
Uh, the whole world is trapped up in a maze
But you save this real good lovin' for rainy days
Uh, the lord works in mysterious ways
He must have put you on this Earth for all men to praise


As I travel through your body our souls become one
Indivisible, uh, it's getting critical son
I'm on the run from love, it chased me out the bag
Get the point boo, you hit it right on the head
It's an endless adventure, two bodies collide
King fulfilling dreams with a queen by his side
Forever, infinite time we intertwine
Destiny, we fall in love by design
What's yours is mine and what's mine is yours
The road less travelled is ours to explore
I adore you, heavenly angel shine light
Hold my hand, I'll be your guide through the night


Come on now, a man chooses a woman
A woman chooses a man, give you half for a second
Then I'll give you the full plunge, uh

Shoot down to Jamaica, pretty white sand
Suntan oil, pina colada in you hand
Layin' up at night, peepin' out stars

I'm sick and tired of the stories that you always tell

Said you slapped Rowdy Piper and didn't get a hassle
You promised your girl filet mignon, took her to White Castle
You said you have a lot of women, you don't even know a few

All I know is that you made it with the whole damn crew
They say you're a man-eater during the full moon
Mascot of the senior boys' locker room
They said Yvette walked in, there wasn't too much rap
Her reputation got bigger, and so did her gap
Cuz girl your momma shoulda taught you better
I'mma sit down and write you a long letter

I'm glad you ain't my sister, then again if you was
I'd have to treat you like you was my distant cuz
I'm not a news reporter, I don't mean to assume
What should I think? I seen ya comin' out the men's bathroom
You wasn't in there alone, wasn't usin' the phone
The door was locked for twenty minutes, all I heard was ""Moan""

I don't really know if the story is so
I can either ask Curly, or Larry or Moe
Or Earl, Shabazz, Lou, Mookie or Joe
Like Santa Claus said, you're a ho-ho-ho
In every disco you say hello
Like you're a little angel, but we all know
Since you was eleven you been actin' this way
You always got in bed when you wanted to play
You're a freak, you think you're Lady Godiva
Some freaks are live, but Yvette you're liver

You're a back-seat queen, a elevator pro
A high-powered body makes your Levis grow
See the stories I've heard, they could amaze
I heard she did it on a motorcycle back in the days
So calm down freak, get a G.E.D
That's a General Education on Decency
One day you'll see, and agree with me
Unless you're gonna be a freak until you're 93
For you there's no fee, everything is free
This is from me to you, not you to me
Every night is your night, your leather pants are tight
You try to shake your butt with all your might
I don't really wanna dis nobody
You might think I had a little too much Bacardi
But that's not the problem, the problem's Yvette
How bad can a girl's reputation get?
See she's the kinda girl all the homeboys met
If you're desperate ask Yvette, cuz she'll say ""Bet""

B-Boys are hard on the boulevard
The Reverend at the church said you was barred
Homeboys on the block love you a lot
You're a real famous freak whether you like it or not
So before you start walking and your beak starts squawkin'
Let me explain to you who is talkin'
I'm L.L. Cool J from around the way
You boogie down to my records almost every day
Go a hundred miles an hour when you're standin' still
You're faster than my Caddy when it's goin' downhill
Won't forget that day in the Y.M.C.A
The guy at the desk said it was OK
For you to come inside cuz he knew you'd stay
Greg G. and Garfield yelled ""Hooray""

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest female of them all?
It was Frosted Flake, she loved to bowl
And although her skin was white she had a lot of soul
Rich female, very debonnaire
Drivin' a Rolls with rollers in her hair
We was hangin' out, pumpin' the stereo
She took me to a club, I think the name was Cheerio's
She walked like she was jumpin' a hurdle
I was happy as a kid that just saw _Mutant Ninja Turtles

A guy walked over, said, ""Your earring's cute""
I said, ""I'm wearin' a earring, but it ain't no Fruit Loop""
Me and Frosted went to get a drink
But she ordered somethin' bugged and I ain't know what to think
She ordered potassium, calcium
Carbohydrate scotch with sodium
She took me to her crib, threw me on the couch
I woke up the next morning with a spoon in my mouth
She's

Milky cereal

Milky cereal

I went to Vegas, didn't think it'd do any harm
I walked into this girl named Lucky Charm
For some reason we walked in the rain
She had a four-leaf clover with a big gold chain
She had a salary that was full of calories, for real
And I was in the mood for a homecooked meal
So we went to be alone
But we had to be quiet, cause her Corn Pops was home
Kissed her neck, kissed her back, kissed her arms
I said, ""Forget it, let me see your Lucky Charms""
When we began her hairstyle was neat
But when I left the next morning it looked like Shredded Wheat
Talked about marriage, I said, ""That's risky
Besides, it's such a waste of Rice Krispies""
She had a robe with the velours material
Her pops woke up, I said, ""Hello Mr. Cereal
I came this morning to deliver the paper""
He said, ""Stop frontin', I know you caught the vapors
That's my daughter, so save your croonin
You better find another bowl of cereal to stick your spoon in""

Milky cereal
(Baby)

Yeah, check this out here:

Then there was Pebbles, times was rough
She was turnin' tricks to get her ""coo-coo puff!""
Her mind was gone, but she turned me on, in fact
She was wearin' an Apple Jack hat
With a full-link fox and some pink bobby-socks
Her father had a greedy disease, fried chicken pox
We called him Hungry Jack
He talked like pops, and then he dressed like The Mack
He invited me out to lunch
With a old army buddy of his, Captain Crunch
The waiter said, ""Jack, what would you like today?""
He said, ""I don't know, just make it Special, 'K?""
He said, ""Cool,"" came back with the order
That's when I said, ""Hey yo, Jack, I like your daughter""
He said, ""Pebbles? Boy, are you crazy?""
I said, ""Nah, I wanna ride in a Mercedes""
She could sing while I'm swingin' my thing
Cause her burgers taste better than Burger King""
He said, ""Go party? Do some minglin'?
You and my daughter? Your brain must be jinglin!""
I said, ""It's smooth, no disrespect
She'll sign a pre-nup, so she don't get half of my week check""
Then we walked down the aisle
Our honeymoon was milky - cereal style
You know what I'm sayin'?

I Need a Beat,Radio,1985,"I need a beat (I need a beat, I need a beat)
(I need a beat, I need a beat)

If it's a malleable beat, subject of discussion
You're motivated with the aid of percussion
There's no category for this story
It will rock in any territory
I syncopate it and design it well
The beat elevates, the scratch excels
All techniques are a combination
Of skills that I have for narration

I need a beat

Lacking a melody, but still complete
Providing musical energy for the street
Lyrics are smooth for maximum effect
Drum track patterns are pre-set
Tom-toms, snare, hats, bass, and cymbal
Like that of a cat on the mic, I'm nimble
Basic patterns, groups and chains
Sequence frequent, seek and gain

Break
Break two

I'm in the center of a musical scorcher
To some citizens, it's a form of torture
They hear me, they fear me, my funky poetry
I'm improvin' the conditions of the rap industry
The beat expands to many foreign lands
Germany, Italy, France and Japan
It'll give you a lift, no need to sniff
No buts, no hows, no whys, or ifs
It's you I defeated, they'll say you retreated
Pick up your favorite magazine and read it
Rap firepower, a musical shower
A picture of me on the Eiffel Tower

I need a beat

During this journey, I'm your escort
You're bein' protected by a musical fort
I'm infiltrating your eardrums
Increasing their rate of vibration
I wanna rock ya, that's all you need to know
""I Need a Beat"" is the title of the show
Providing you with pleasure of the musical measures
All arranged to alleviate pressure
I'm your vocalist, your party therapist
Beat programmer and lyricist
Ladies Love Cool J, studio user
A million or more screamin' people abuser
I predict this jam will hit
The highest plateau in the world of music
Paparazzi, wealth and fame
The total propulsion of my name

I need a beat

Computerize, then the engineer's eyes
Have to be very acute, education level high
The product is mine, beat under rhyme
The control board's part of the studio design
Track after track, culminating on wax
The tape has slack, rewind spins back
Expensive but useful, the music is the fuel
A perfect place for MCs to duel (duel, duel, duel)

I need a beat
Farmer's Boulevard
Hot as Queens

Hip Hop,Mr. Smith,1995.0,"Word up! Ya know what I'm sayin'?
I gotta globe in the world in the mail today
NahI'msayin? Heh, word up!
Uhh, kid told me ""Yo, the world is yours kid, put it in ya pocket""
Nahmean?
Make a brother feel good, word up!
Brother feel energized
I wanna dedicate this one to the game that put me on the map
Y'nahI'msayin?

I know you love it, the game is so irresistible to touch
You should see me when fiendin' for microphones that I can clutch
Droppin' bombs, combinin' the club attracts
Like the old Sugarhill Gang, King Tim and Fatback
There's no question the suggestion was made
The foundation was laid when the Furious played
Grandmaster Flash slayed competition that was wishin'
They could serve the technician with the number one position
Ugh, the real deal, 
Fearless Four
 scored
Bambaataa was hotter, Spoonie was givin' em nata
An' I was all up in my headzone, melody and' all
Cosign and The Movement sayin', ""Yes, yes y'all""
It's just the love affair that never ended
I recommended that I take microphones and blow 'em up
Ain't that splendid?
This one goes out to all the hip-hop do-or-diers
A song is dedicated to the music I admire

Whenever and ever
We want you, I need you (I need hip-hop)
Whenever and ever
We want you, do you feel the same way too? (I need hip-hop)

Kane's era was terror, he warmed it up
Parrish and Erick, cat lyrics that'll make ya turn it up
And I was in the cut, chillin' in my drop-top Benz with friends, Loungin' with my mens, laughin' 'bout all the ends that I spends
Making snaps, pumping Kool G Rap and Biz
Dapper Dan,
 Dookie wrotes I'm about to show what time it is
At the rooftop, I was with Doug E.Fresh and Slick Rick
""La Di Da Di, who likes to party?"" was the fat shit
I mean, I saw this hip-hop thing on every level
Chuck D, P.E., yes, the rhythm and the rebel
I can reminisce the black fist, Uzi, Terminators
Terrordome techniques that terrorize the lighter shade-a
It's all about the game that we play every day
Eric B & Rakim flow to such a different way
I'm lovin' hip-hop cos it help brothers escape
Let's celebrate our music people before it's too late

Whenever and ever
We want you, I need you (I need hip-hop)
Whenever and ever
We want you, do you feel the same way too? (I need hip-hop)

Survival Of The Fittest, Mobb Deep
, 
and Lost Boyz
Lickin' shots got the game hot
, 
they even flipped on 2Pac
Snoop Doggy Dogg put the West Coast in gear
Dr Dre, NWA, Eazy E's in here
I wanna tell the world they just don't understand
My man Nas Escobar, Wu-Tang Clan
Keith Murray to the Redman, 
down south Da Brat
My people are you with me where you at? Ya peep that?
I'm on a mission to rejuvenate the funk
Bring the game back and give the do-or-diers what they want
When you hear Craig Mack, Notorious B.I.G
Latifah, Heavy D, you should reminisce of me
Some say it's Naughty By Nature, ""Hip-hop in all its glory""
A fleet of battleships floatin' in different categories
My love affair with hip-hop'll never fade away
Sincerely yours, LL Cool J

Hip-hop's the game, helped a lot of brothers escape
Take it to another level, know I'm sayin'?

Kanday,Bigger and Deffer,1987.0,"I met this new girl with big juicy lips
And nice round hips, I mean her body's a trip
And when I go over her house, you know what I like?
The way she tells me ""take it off"" and never says ""syke""
Yo, I'm never in need, she's feedin my greed
She never waits for me to ask, she takes the lead
Her tongue is sticky, and hickeys are her specialty
E wants her, but she saves the good stuff for me
Her name is Kanday, she's dandier than Dandy Don
You're mad and I'm happy that she put me on
I'll never leave her for nothin, only a crazy man would
That's why I had to tell ya that

(I feel good) about Kanday

Now and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
Brothers beg for the leg, she's on the cheerleading team
It feels wicked, everytime I stick it, that's right
When we're alone she never ever acts polite
Hey yo, she blows me kisses, she does my dishes
I wished I bust two and she grants my wishes
She's clever in bed, she uses her head
She's the kinda girl that keeps a fat man well fed
Left to right all night, the chick's outta sight
I broke my lamp shade in half because I don't use a light
Man, she's juicy like a berry, chocolate with the cherry
Ask me if it's good and I'll have to say very
Wouldn't leave her for nothin, only a crazy man would
That's why I had to tell ya that

(I feel good) about Kanday

I'm feelin gooder than good, if you wouldn't I would
If you could, I know you could, she's kickin back in the hood
When she starts to get off she can knock off a cough
I know 'cough' don't rhyme with 'boss', but she made me her boss
She's the talk of my room whenever I'm in my room
My little brother loves her more than his favorite cartoon
Her body's bad, the girl's built, skin like silk
Wet, steamy and warm just like a hot cup of milk
She's all the way live, keeps me satisfied
I don't go outside, I like to stay inside
Her ways are like an angel, with bright white wings
And I'm crazy 'bout the way Kanday shakes her thing
Wouldn't leave her for nothin, only a crazy man would
That's why I had to tell ya that

(I feel good) about Kanday

Ooh, you couldn't imagine, I'm lickin my lips
If she was tea I'd take a sip, when I'm in gym I do flips
I'm in love with the pizznoot, it's proper as hell
I'm hittin harder than hard, always makin her yell
She's cooler than an iceberg, word to the mother
In the house, down the steps and under the covers
Right away, no sation, or frontin, or playin
Or delayin, I'm never steppin off, I'm always stayin
Her mother knows me well, father hates my guts
He don't know when we're alone she's always feelin on my niggy-niggy-nuts
For a snack, cornflakes, crackerjacks
Day after day I try to break that back
And man, oh man, damn, you can't and I can
Last time I saw her ex-man, I had to shake homeboys' hand
I said ""what up"", he said ""what up"", ""I took your girl, so what up?""
Gotta walk on the ground with a hole to fill up
All the boys laugh about her, Darryl and Dewayne
Bobcat and Earl, but they must be insane
Michael Spelling's on my side, and big Chuck agrees
She's my private freaky deak, my own personal skeez
Wouldn't leave her for nothin, only a crazy man would
That's why I had to tell ya that (I - feel - good)

Back Where I Belong,G.O.A.T. (Greatest of All Time),2000.0,"Yo, yeah, aight after this particular practice run
I'ma practice both verses, after this, I want you to find a spot
That's close to when the beat drops to the rewind point, locate point
You ain't gotta be on that all night, this the soundtrack
Yo, yeah, check it
Okay, alright, huh okay

The other night I was up at Farmers, politicking with some Bloods
They told me, ""Yo L, in the streets you ain't getting no love
And ever since the X's and the Jiggas came out
My niggas ain't trying to the hear that smooth shit you talk about
What's up with that cat Canibus? Son played you out
Why you didn't answer back correctly, fuck was that about?""
As I sip on some Henny, and try to explain some things
About the life of a legend, and all the drama it brings
Been gone a long time, had a lot of shit on my mind
I decided I don't want to reach my goal if it means losing my shine
Streets is hip-hop and I'm hip-hop, so the streets is mine
Balling as long as you been living, that's a long time
Hard to stay hungry when your pockets are so fat
You hit a hot one in every city on the map
And niggas keep sleeping and you keep coming back
You know better than the gat, but niggas still wanna clap

It feels so good to be back where I belong
The streets is where I belong
They had me locked down much too long
Hey hey
It feels so good to be back where I belong
The streets is where I belong
They had me locked down much too long
Hey

Some say, ""L that's cool, but see times have changed""
Niggas got red bandanas, and the grill in the range
That gold shit is dead, niggas rock platinum chains
Trade O.E. for Henny, Colt 45 for champagne
Hustling niggas found they way into the game
Extorting all these so-called ballers with big names
And you gotta have a squad, 'cause running from Def ain't safe
I know you living good, but ain't no smile up on our face
I'm like a villain, I'm representing on my lyrics
And force feed the world, even if they don't want to hear it
As far as Canibus go, my man is hitting his ex-broad
I'm getting head from his new piece
While 20 gang-bangers applaud, you came up with that bullshit
Some heads sucked it up, 
then you dropped that garbage album
And totally fucked it up
, I coulda told ya I knew your moms
From the after-hours spot, when I used to be up in Canada
With the dreads on a black block, 
before you dick rode Lost Boyz
For a ticket our to Jersey, but being the man I am
I tried to show ya mercy, I coulda told the World
The way ya label hates your guts
And how me and Wyclef, got together to set you up
And how he gave me half your budget, don't believe me look it up
Your A&R promotion niggas, they helped me hook it up
I hate to be responsible, for destroying your career
A one-hit wonder, huh
No wonder you disappeared,
 I coulda told the world
You get your lyrics from the internet
Then spit 'em word for word
Like you really a rap vet, how you take metaphors from books
And put 'em in your rhyme, and how you really from Canada
And you been fronting all this time
I heard your second album, that shit is garbage too
LL Cool J and I did this to you
On that note he said
""Yo L, you the man"", I said peace, one love
And drove off in the Lex Land

It feels so good to be back where I belong
The streets is where I belong
They had me locked down much too long
Hey hey
It feels so good to be back where I belong
The streets is where I belong
They had me locked down much too long
Hey

Yea nigga, the jig is up, nigga, huh ha
You know what I'm saying? All that bullshit you was talking
Don't mean shit, you finish now
I'm still the man, nigga
The vanguard award is in my motherfucking living room
You know what I mean? come get that shit, fuck, what
MIC still on my arm, nigga, word up
Both arms, I'ma get another one nigga
You know what I'm saying, this LL you know how I get down
You should of known, when you did it
He probably did it to get some fame
But is this really what you want? Hahahahahahahaha",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-back-where-i-belong-lyrics

And if you know her good enough she won't make you stand on line
She'll let you inside, make you pay for the ride
Take off her pants and then it smells like somebody died
You say ""What the heck"", because you already paid
Not knowin' that the guy that went before you had AIDS
Bang bang boogie, she was so amusin'
Next week you're at the clinic gettin' blood transfusions
At the...

You and Me,G.O.A.T. (Greatest of All Time),2000.0,"Yeah, uhh, uhh
Word up
And you say New York City
A-ha-ha, word up (Take me away, baby)
Uhh, uhh, uhh.. uhh

Damn, you and your man had beef
So he left you Uptown, teary-eyed, on the back streets
For me to scoop up in the Bentley drop
Long as God hold me down you know I had to stop
What the deal ma?  You wanna use my cell?
You runnin' solo?  This block foul as hell
You said my ex be beatin' on me
He mad jealous even though he be cheatin' on me
Mmm, I said miss, let me tell you somethin'
'Bout who's makin' major moves and who's frontin'
Huh, who's talkin' loud but ain't sayin' nothin'
And those who get the one they want but keep frontin
He don't appreciate the well 'til it run dry
Love is blind, it's hard to say goodbye {goodbye}
But smart birds choose to fly
'Cause we livin' in the hood girlfriend, it's do or die
Here's my definition, of love everlasting
I would trade all my cash in, for passion
Tiffany jewels and designer fashions
To hear happiness is mine for the askin'
Every day on my knees I pray
That I would run into someone that make me feel this way
What you think, you wanna ride with L?
Some things are meant to be baby, you never can tell
(I wanna ride, with you baby)

Every night, every day
I just sit and dream about you
You and me, you and me
Hold me tight, ecstasy
Makin love 'til ever after
Baby, you and me, yeah, you and me

Now we dippin' on the FDR
It's one of them lucky nights when you can peep out the stars
We speak without talkin' and the world is ours
When I glance over at ya I can feel your power
You schemin', L want a one-night stand
I'm schemin', she probably in love with her man
But we keep on rollin', hopin' there's somethin' more
Dreamin' about tomorrow and what life got in store
Livin, no drama, we can chill, relax
Sex all night in the morn' count stacks
Sip Grand Marnier and maybe puff a dime sack
But only in moderation, we ain't livin' like that, y'know?
We jetted up the tavern on the green
To talk about love cause the game's extreme
Domestic abuse and everything in between
'Cause I want you to think of me
When you need a shoulder to lean on
I'm from Queens, I'ma rep to the fullest
But I'd rather chill with you, 'stead of dodgin' bullets
Glock in the stash I don't really wanna pull it
On some so-called thug cat, that's faker than acrylics
He said your fam be ridin' your nerves
And you hate him for never given you the life you deserve
Remember, the one who hold a grudge is foul
And everything you ever wanted is in front of you now
Whassup?

Every night, every day
I just sit and dream about you
You and me, you and me
Hold me tight, ecstasy
Makin love 'til ever after
Baby, you and me, yeah, you and me

I promise you, dreams do come true
There's trials and tribulations that we all go through
When your heart's bleedin', how could the sky seem blue?
But listen up shorty, this is what I wanna do
Be there for you, baby care for you
When my dogs stare at you never sharin' you
And to my ex-girlfriend, never comparin' you
And do the things that your ex never dared to do
Time to bounce baby, I'm takin' you home
Look at the moonlight sparkle on the 20 inch chrome
The rocks on my hand got a life of they own
Plus the blend tape's bumpin' and it's settin' the tone
Should I jet to the hotel, is now the right time
Or should I be patient and explore your mind?
You said you grew up in the ghetto and it hurt your heart
Tried to live smart but your dreams fell apart
You dated hustlers and brought 'em customers
They totally destroyed whatever trust there was
Now you hate men and everything they stand for
'Cause you wanna be treated like a queen, not a whore
Close your eyes, don't be afraid to dream
Open your heart to this cat from Queens
Whatever you wanna do, however you wanna do it
Back to back baby, we can get each other through it

Every night, every day
I just sit and dream about you
You and me, you and me
Hold me tight, ecstasy
Makin love 'til ever after
Baby, you and me, yeah, you and me
Every night, every day
I just sit and dream about you
You and me, you and me
Hold me tight, ecstasy
Makin love 'til ever after
Baby, you and me, yeah, you and me
Every night, every day
I just sit and dream about you
You and me, you and me
Hold me tight, ecstasy
Makin love 'til ever after
Baby, you and me, yeah, you and me

Knahmean?  Word up
Yeah, yeah
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon
Yeah, I just want you to think about that, y'knahmsayin?
Late at night when you layin there
And you feel like the whole world is fallin' around you
Remember these words that I said
There's somebody out there for you baby
Might be me, you never know, ahahah
Word up, stay strong shorty
Keep your eyes up to the sky, knahmsayin'?
Don't let nobody tell you you can't make it
And don't let nobody around you tell you
That it ain't possible to make your dreams come true

I wanna get hype man, I wanna do this, yaknahmsayin?
Just gon' chill, check it out

Slick as Vasoline
, smell good as cologne
I'm like a muscle man in jail -- they leave me alone
I rhyme like Superman, you rap like Jimmy Olson
I'll break you like a bottle of green Golden Molson
You ain't a real rhymer, you look like a actress
How you gon' sleep on me, holmes? Do I look like a mattress?
Am I that old? Do I walk like Grady?
I'm 150 proof, Smirnoff is only 80
Don't you EVER try to rock my house
I'm a real cool cat, know what I'm sayin Mickey Mouse?
The poetry specialist, so take a dose of this
Now think about it -- can you really come close to this?
You soft as powder, 
weak as a cabin cooler
Ugly as work shoes, messin with the Ruler:
The ultimate writer, reciter and def entertainer
I work myself harder than a boxer's trainer

Clap your hands everybody (aiyyo)
And everybody just clap your hands (aiyyo)
Clap your hands everybody (aiyyo)
And everybody just clap your hands (aiyyo)
I said, clap your hands everybody (aiyyo)
And everybody just clap your hands (aiyyo)
Clap your hands everybody (aiyyo)
And everybody just clap your hands (aiyyo)

You'll end up underneath my sneaker
You're dog doo-doo, I'm watchin you get weaker
You can't believe, the skill and dexterity
LL Cool J, and the J is for Jeremy
So buff me, 
James Todd the earthquaker
That's right my brother, you're goin out like Sega
Screwed and chewed, so whassup dude?
One of my ballads'll get your girlies in the mood
Sucker MC's really make me sick
I'm so bad, I can suck my own dick
If you go to your girl's house and I'm there already
Don't go Crazy cause my name ain't Eddie
Rhymes so rough, it's like a course in trigonometry
When Einstein was talkin, he was talkin about me
The Prince of the Earth, and I'ma give birth
To a rhyme so hard 
you'll look soft as a Smurf
Gigglin and wigglin
, so how we goin out?
LOVELY, and that's without a doubt!

Clap your hands everybody (aiyyo)
And everybody just clap your hands (aiyyo)
Clap your hands everybody (aiyyo)
And everybody just clap your hands (aiyyo)
Clap your hands everybody (aiyyo)
And everybody just clap your hands (aiyyo)

Rappers are my servants, they serve me like an emperor
When I'm through, you'll need a nurse to take your temperature
And cool you down, cause you're cold as leftovers
Not the ones on the table, I'm talkin about RUFF rovers
You can't get over, what's my name, Goofy?
You smoke I'm no joke, so my brother break out the looseys
And take a pull, cause the buck stops here
I get swift as a magician, wreck shit and dissapear
Don't cross me, or lose your loyalty
To the Prince of the Rap Court, I'm royalty
And it ain't no puzzle, it's a shame how rappers guzzle
Paragraphs I put together so I carry a muzzle
To shut em up and cut em up and make em be quiet
I'm a one man RIOT, so don't even TRY IT
The Prince of special tactics, plus I'm athletic
Before you play your hand you better do some calisthenics
Jumpin jacks, squats, push-ups, the whole nine
Speak your piece, then I'mma go for mine
And I guarantee you, I'm gonna strike again
I recommend my friend you drop the pen and give in
Cop out to one rhyme cause you're facin ten
I ain't Sidney Poitier but we can ""Do This Again""
I'm nice wit mines, and I gotta admit it
You don't really wanna battle, why don'tcha just forget it!

Clap your hands everybody (aiyyo)
And everybody just clap your hands (aiyyo)
Clap your hands everybody (aiyyo)
And everybody just clap your hands (aiyyo)

But if you're hard-headed and you still don't understand
Here's a little sample - ahem, my man
*BRRRRRRRING* ""Hello?""
{*cut n scratch ""Cool J""*}
"".. takes everything you've got""
{*cut n scratch 
""pushin a broom""
*}
"".. sure would help a lot""
Check my stats, how we livin, I thought so
I'm fresh, oh yes. But can they flow? Hell no
My rhymes are up to date, excellent, on point
I'm tellin you, they're the serious joint
I eat my steak fast, I drink my brew slow
My voice is milky with a nice clear flow
I eat like a fat man, and walk like a gigolo
I'm not a ballplayer, so now Y'KNOW!

Clap your hands everybody (aiyyo)
And everybody just clap your hands (aiyyo)
Cuz I'm in the house, everybody (aiyyo)
And everybody just clap your hands (aiyyo)

KnowhatI'msayin?
And I'mma be straight til the year 3000
That's word to 'muvva', yaknahmsayin?
And I say 'muvva' with a V cuz the V is for Victory, yaknahmsayin?
Cuz I'm the victor in this game, word up, knahmsayin?

Gonna ROCK (What?) ROCK, ROCK around the clock
Three years ago in 
St. Albans, Queens
I was rockin at a park called one eighteen
Little kids stood and watched as I rocked the spot
Didn't know years later I'll be standin on top
Live in Farmers Boulevard I was born in Bayshore
Stopped the rich and shaked hands with the poor
And this is a story about a brother I know
Cut Creator on the fader, now watch him go

Go, go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go, go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go

Way back in the days before I clocked some dough
I used to go to the show and sit in the front row
Hopin' and prayin' one day I'll get on the road
So I'd have Fila in the summer and a mink when it snowed
Not fearin a thought, cockstrong like a horse
No man’s runnin’ my posse, cause each man is a boss
When he’s home, he can’t wait to pull a jam out the crate
One time for your mind
Check out the guitar break

Go, go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go, go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go

This jam is wild enough for Jimi Hendrix to sing
If you need lessons of the mix 
he'll take you under his wing
Straight from the heart cause it ain't money that we came here for
Ain't enforcin’ no rules, ain't breakin no laws
We ain’t a rock 'n' roll band, in pinstripe and plaid
Just my posse learned to work with what little we had
It's all about us three: E, Phil & Jay
You heard Cut Creator cut, now check it out we can play

Go, go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go, go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go

Rock, rock y'all check out the funky cut
It's like travellin' through time to the ""Stray Cat Strut""
Cuts are slicker than grease
, needles sharper than knives
We'll be do doin' the do for the rest of the lines
Wanna piece of the action, it's time to party, get up
Not a subway bummy singer puttin' change in a cup
Wanna see you boogie, oogie jumpin' up and down
Bite your lip and hold your breath until we come to your town

Bring on the mo's and ho's
Don't snooze or doze
'Cause I'm rippin' up shows
Hold your nose, dead bodies are around
I leave scratch marks under the tears of a clown
I write rhymes that shine like lipstick
So much material, but not materialistic
Imperial styles I use
When the mic is lifted the crowd is amused
Come with it, if you feel you're full-fledged
Or yell ""Geronimo!"" and jump off the edge
Your e-n-d is near when I appear
The stage is yours, but wait until the smoke clears
Rhyme sayer, and I'm here to lay a load
So watch a player when he's playin' in player mode
Uncle L's bad, and you're soon to say
'Cause I rip the mic until the toon decay

You're not complete, I'm battlin' a fragment
So creative and witty and outstandin'
And I be demandin' that you're abandoned
In the desert or a wild west town
While I'm at your crib on a cherry-go-round
Where will she stop? No one knows
Like I said before, bring on the mo's and ho's
I know my abc's and my p's and q's
Just chill and listen to the rhyme cruise
All aboard, the cod is a reward
Some were ignored when they toured for they bored
The crowd was aloud, lyrics weren't endowed
Took a crack of the 40 and went to show 'em how
You like me now, but you didn't before

It's so visual the way I'm throwin' down
Visualize MC's goin' down
In a barrage of bullets combinated with rhymes
The moral of the story is: I'ma get mines
I saw the cord-less, boy, I'm gonna house that
Your rhymes are cheesy, you found 'em in a mouse trap
Don't try to front while the freestyle's droppin'
He wants to battle, he must be needle-poppin'
You better notify your next of kin
'Cause when I begin it's like a needle to the skin
If you wasn't prepared then you ought to be scared
But even if you was you're aware what the rhyme does
I remember when you was an amateur
Writin' your rhymes, starin' at my signature
Bought the album, analyzed the style
Tisk-tisk (Hatchew!) God bless you, child
I'm unique when I speak to a beat
Another rapper'll fall when the mission's complete
I daze and amaze, my display's a faze
Every phrase is a maze as Uncle L slays
The competition that's lost in a freestyle
'Cause on the mic I'm the golden child
With the magical wand that they're callin' a mic
And when MC's approach it turns into a spike

My Rhyme Ain’t Done,Bigger and Deffer,1987.0,"The President woke and he called the Pope
The Pope climbed to heaven on a golden rope
He asked the Lord to raise Michaelangelo from the dead
So he can make a fresh painting of my head
Then I hung out with a king and a queen
And the queen put me down with her polo team
The way I scored points all around the clock
I had her daughter, the princess ridin my jock
I knocked the freak off like a crazy retard
Then I took a little trip into a deck of cards
The diamond jack joker and the ace of spades
Was amazed at greater Cut Creator on the fade
Then I played cards with the queen of clubs
The queen of hearts with me cold fell in love
As for the queen of diamonds, she don't like men
Because you know that a diamond is a girl's best friend
The double-trouble spade was named the deuce
And the joker acted stupid, so we gave him the noose
There was 52 cards, and I met every one
That story is over, but my rhyme ain't done

Then I took a trip to the center of the earth
I was kinda scared, so E-Love went first
I met these funny little people, they called em skeezers
So I held on to my wallet like Ebeneezer
Tight leather pants that'll make you grunt
Two nice soft things right up front
The center of the earth ain't got no crime
Just people bodyrockin to the L.L. rhyme
If you're kinda confused to what a skeezer is
It's just a girl who's on my jock cause I'm in showbiz
There was a whole lotta skeezers, I dogged every one
That story is over, but my rhyme ain't done

Woke up late one afternoon
Realized I was in the world of cartoons
He-Man told me he'd beat me up
Because he thought that I looked like Donald Duck
Then I hung out with Spiderman
He told me he was gonna start a comic strip band
The Incredible Hulk was gonna play the drums
Charlie Brown grabbed the guitar and started to strum
Snoopy tried to rock on the microphone
But Tom & Jerry both said he should leave it alone
Then I hung out with Mickey Mouse
He had two freaks, so we went to his house
Mickey's freak was ugly, but mine was def
So I knocked it off until there wasn't none left
They were cartoon characters, I met every one
That story is over, but my rhyme ain't done

Since I'm a good friend of father time
I'm not gettin older as I say this rhyme
I was warmin the stove at the Alamo
Before Booth shot Lincoln I stole the show
I was down with George at the Delaware
But I wore a Kangol, not the fake white hair
Me and E-Love met Sitting Bull
We made a peace pipe, then we took a pull
Then he brought more leaves from a golden chest
You thought it was tabacco - the shit was cess
There was a lotta great men, and I met every one
That story is over, but my rhyme ain't done

11:33, I swear it's no sooner
I went inside my TV, I met The Honeymooners
Ralph wanted me to bust a couple of rhymes
But I had my eyes on Alice's behind
Norton came down right about that time
Lookin in the fridge, so he could swine and dine
Then I said to myself, I should give em a taste
So I pulled the microphone out my black briefcase
Said, it ain't Bob Hope or Barry Manilow
Then I borrowed Norton's hat, cause I forgot my Kangol
Ralph said, ""I got a scheme, let me get to it""
""Norton, my pal,"" I said, ""Yo, don't even do it""
They were all Honeymooners, and I met every one
That story is over, but my rhyme ain't done

Cause my tongue cuts sharp, I hit a note like a harp
Or a harmonica, Veronica, I do my part
In a bedroom with leg room I'm strong like a monsoon
Chilled in Maui-Waui and I carry a harpoon
Stopped at the isle that's Mali, cause we got ill
Wrote my name on a rock at the top of the hill
I searched for other ways, made love in caves
And I kicked the ill beats that make the natives raise
Now I'm gonna tell you what all this means
From Farmers Boulevard in St. Albans, Queens
There's a lyrical technician who came to play
Number one b-boy L.L. COOL J
All of this is just a story that I made up
Def lines I say on time with Cut Creator's cuts
Some of it's fiction, and some of it's fact
Not another common rap with a heavy drum track
A whole lotta rhymes, and I wrote every one
That story is over, and my rhyme IS DONE

The Do Wop,Bigger and Deffer,1987.0,"L.L. Cool J
Servin em well
And as you all know..
I AM - HARD - AS HELL
Woke up at 9:30 on a Saturday morn'
Hemmed my remote control, turned my stereo on
Then I reached for a brush since I don't use the picks
And the floor was kinda cold, so I put on my kicks
Walked to the kitchen and ate some cornflakes
As I bop to a tape of Cut Creator's breaks
With hardcore - heavyweight - b-boy blast
Connoisseur of hardcore, and Cut Creator's fast
Jumped in the shower, it was boiling hot
So I stayed there a hour, cause I like it a lot
Jumped out, dried off, put on the Devin cologne
Then I called up Earl on the telephone
He told me 'bout a jam that I could do later on
10 g's plus a limo for one strong song
So I said, yeah, I was with it, hung up and got geared
Got a magnfying glass, then I brushed my beard
Rewound some tapes of some Def Jam tunes
As I waited for this freak to ring my bell at noon
12 o'clock came, left the door crack
The freak walked in, a mink on her back
Put her coat on the rack, threw my  on
Then I threw in a tape of the quiet storm
We drank Round Hill Cabernet Sauvignon
She said, ""L.L., when you're gonna let me taste your tongue?""
My skin got pale, I wam-bammed the tail
Did it so hard I shoulda went to jail
She left, Earl came over and we went outside
Jumped in the BM to bust a joyride
Went up to 
A.J.
, in my fresh black wheel
I'm not a sucker on the corner tryin to scrape up a meal
The girlies want sex, the fellas try to plex
But those who flex end up with broke necks
Signed some autographs for a posse of freaks
Said, ""It's L, baby, I ain't down with Chic""
Conversated with the skeezers for 10 minutes more
Then I jumped in my ride and the freaks slammed the door
Due cause I'm a gangster people think I do crimes
They don't know I'm just a connoisseur of hip-hop rhymes
Some smile, try to call L.L. a hoodlum at times
But he don't know my autograph's on his wife's behind
L.L. has iced all the washed up slobs
Vigilante of rap, so to hell with the mob
Don't run from the cops, makin suckers jock
And I'm only 18 makin more than your pops
Tormentor of toys and boyscout boys
And I dare any critic to call it noise
Peeped at the clock, it said 6:03
Said 'later' to Creator and broke out with E
Went up to White Castle for a chocolate shake
Thinkin 'bout a 100,000 that I'd soon make
Finished up the snack, jumped up, out my seat
E-Love hit the table and he made up a beat
Kicked a few lines, stepped out the door
Said ""Tonight is a bore, I'm in the mood for more""
We jumped in my ride, I took a peek at the time
It was almost 7:30 and the show was at nine
L.L. Cool J will soon stand at a jam
With thousands of people screamin, ""Touch my hand!""
But since I had a hour plus a half attached
I was searchin for the cutie who's my perfect match
Her name was Renee, her face was okay
But she had the kinda body that made Jay wanna play
I said, ""No need to rehearse,"" then I made my approach
Said, ""You got a good team, girl, but you need a new coach""
Said, ""My name's L.L. - Cool, if I may introduce
But I'm not here for conversation, I'm here to seduce
Wanna mix it up, baby, wanna feel you grind
Cause it ain't 5th grade, and these ain't nursery rhymes
And I know that you adore my sure side hardcore
Check out the real L.L. behind closed doors
So tell your buddies you're busy, tell your boyfriend beat it
Forget the silk dress,cause you ain't gonna need it
Unplug your clock, do away with the light
After five minutes or more you hear me say, 'That's right!'
Your body is bad and I heard you got a Caddy
When we make love you can call me daddy
I'm L.L. Cool J, say hey, Renee
I'm not a toyboy, but I still wanna play
Promise you I'm not wack when I'm in the sack
After that I leave you starvin for me to come back
But in the meantime, put your digits down
And the next time I see ya I'm goin to town""
Stepped away from the freak, it was a quarter to nine
When I rolled to the jam I saw the crew on line
Took a trip around the side, so I could get backstage
If you call me a tiger, then the stage is my cage
I rip, stomp and crush, heavy metal bands rust
Them flaky knuckleheads I crumble up like crust
Walked in my dressing room, and then I heard four knocks
They said, ""L.L., you're runnin late and it'is time to rock""
Told Cut Creator what the order would be
Then I said ""Lord have mercy"" and slapped hands with E
Went onstage, I heard the girlies scream
And that's the very moment I woke up from the dream
Aahh!",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-the-do-wop-lyrics
Murdergram,Mama Said Knock You Out,1990.0,"The big showdown, the display of skill
I'm that type of guy so put your girl on the pill
Take a family snapshot and kiss your wife
'Cause I'm like a knife, I cause grief and strife
And I'll take your life, and choke you like a python
I'mma do you wrong
Any emcee, who you wanna name?
I'm one panther that can't be tamed
Talking about guns, punk it don't alarm me
Got enough cash to make a whole damn army
I can't hold back the way that I feel
'Cause when I bust a rhyme it's like you're slipping on banana peels
You're like fruit cake and fruit cocktails
First your title now I'm takin' your female
All of a sudden you're so proud of black
A baseball hat, but you ain't saying jack
The ripper is back and you can't escape
'Cause one of my records'll sell more than your whole tape
I want beef, bring on the rookies
I got more than just Cool J cookies
Rip, rock, crush, stomp the comp, I'm poison come and take a chomp
I bet you your teeth'll end up around the corner kid
Don't ask me why I did
Uncivilized damage to a nobody
And I'm carrying a gun if I'm rhymin' at the party
New York, Chicago, Detroit, LA
I'll slay wherever you play
D.C. or Philly, or Baltimore
I murder the rich and maim the poor
Perpetratin' in your video, here's the real schoolin'
Country accents, who you think you're foolin'?
I play Russian Roulette not Craps
You're only known 'cause of Yo MTV raps
And Rap City and B.E.T
And Channel 31, but now here I come
To save the day and now you're getting done
Like a hooker, don't drop the soap, crumb
The first sign of the battle you little fink
Is you see blood coming out your kitchen sink
Your mic's a baby bottle son
Some say they ain't but I am the one
To slice and dice and fry and boil, to bake and serve a nerd
I heard a word occurred to him that he could move and wouldn't get
Moved on, like a shotgun blast
Big mouth emcees I'll bet you none last
'Cause they ain't stable or able
And I boost the party like jumper cables
So plug me in and put me on
Arsenio Hall so I can battle 'em all
From coast to coast, blind, crippled and crazy
You use a dictionary but you still don't phase me
Listen and weep, you sound cheap
Preach about blackness but you represent wackness
You're knocking on the castle door but when you fall in the moat
I won't see you no more
Let's get together and diss LL
Use his name and your records might sell
I can't believe your band of dead maggots
Crawling all over my name I won't have it
You better look in the mirror and re-think your plan
Why walk in quicksand?
When you can stand on your own two feet
I'm rippin' emcees from Funky Drummer to Big Beat
Name the date and the arena
You three year old ballerina
I can't believe that suckers try to throw down
Whether you're new or older than Motown
Just kick back, I don't slack attack a wacker slapper rap
They can't handle the format
Whether you're suave or smooth
Rough or rugged all I need is a groove
I display a way to slay, punk play to pay
Mr Morris has entered the buffet
Some of y'all are sitting in bowls
Plates of the hot buttered rolls
Beat you with baloney, stab you with salami
'Cause when I get hot I get hot like pastrami
Then I make you wonder
Why you don't hear bass, but you feel the thunder
You get cute, I'll knock out your tooth
We'll be fighting from the lobby to the roof
You annoy me like a roach at dinner time
Yo Marley (What's up?) It's Miller Time
(Nah man, just kick a little more)
Pass the brass knuckles let me break his jaw
When I'm on the microphone I want silence
Let KRS-One stop the violence
Ain't no rivals, ain't no competition
Punk, I'm beatin' you into submission
I'm gettin' busier than ever before
Never more will I slack I'mma keep it real raw
Eat you up like a pack-jam
Video's more popular than Batman
Rippin' you to shreds, tap you in the head
Then leave the battle lookin' happy as a newlywed
Give me a Tec-9 to spray
Save the beef and put it on lay-away
I'm in command your man abandons on the table fans will understand
Then you weep about the murdergram",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-murdergram-lyrics
Hollis to Hollywood,Mr. Smith,1995.0,"Yeah, you know it be buggin' me out, yknahmsayin in rap
How everybody like is usin' metaphors and all that
It seems like everybody's like a.. like some kind of metaphor freak
Some kind of metaphorical freak or somethin' man
Yknahmsayin, word up, so, yknowhatI'msayin
You know brother's wanna make a movie and all that
Yknahmean? So I figured yknowhatI'msayin
I'd just make a little movie, witcha chick involved
Hehe, y'dig? Check it

If you saw the movie Wall Street I guess you know
The way I stack chips and regulate wild dough
But ain't no G-Funk and far from my era
Tales in the hood your boys'll feel terror
MCs contaminating tracks with feces
You think I'm pussy until I flip like Species
High-tech, yep, my pen got velocity
Jumping out the SSL like Virtuosity
And never question what I'm doing to your girl
She let me dive deep like her panties is Waterworld
But are metaphors the only thing in rap?
You brothers need to stop with that
I'm going from

Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good?
(See how it sounds? A little unrational)
(Broken down to his very last compound)

Check it
I'll make the speed like I'm Keanu Reeves
But too many true lies can make a honey bleed
She said, I know you want this, ghetto Pocahontas
I got higher learning and banging gets monotonous
Her ass was classic, cheeks was Jurassic
Serving her justice, poetic the way I lasted
I touch ground real windy with my lyrics
Make her talk in tongue and feelash to swing
When I do my thing my balls is ha the Holy Spirit
Hear it, pull it like strings, got mad ciry like The Lion King
I'm in the jungle laying down my mack
You brothers need to chill with that
I'm going from

Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good?

(Take me away) Uhh, you think I can't boo?
(Take me away) Uhh, you think I won't boo?
(Take me away) Uhh, you think I can't boo?
It's kinda like miniature satellites floating in closets
Spying in pockets
Jumping out of a helicopter into a football stadium filled with cotton candy
Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!
Yknahmean? Worrrrd up!

So your man got a good job loving you so much
Boss on his back coming home like, ""What the fuck?""
But you be on his side through the thick and all the thin
That's when LL come in
Blast her ass like 
Apollo 13
, sugar dipped in cream
Popping Dom in every direction, what a scene
He can't understand your best friend's plan
Running game while you chill with the demolition man
Good love, mad fun, tight hugs and flowers
I have your girl running off to fake baby showers
Better get down for your crown at home
I got her standing on the bed, getting closer to the drop zone
Some brothers won't appreciate that
Ain't it scary when you meet a real mack? Let's run it back
See the flavor's in my lifestyle, chill don't even lie to me
Balls are lethal weapons
, 
dick a menace to society
You ain't a player hater kid you took her off restriction
I make her tell lies and knock the pulp out of fiction
Kid you know I'm game tight
When you hit it tonight I hope she scream my name right
That's word is bond kid, you know why?
I'm going from

It’s Time for War,Exit 13,2008.0,"Welcome to Exit 13
I am your host
LL Cool J

You said I was finished
And Father Time was the blame
You disrespected my legacy
And threw dirt on my name
Told DJs he's over
He ain't spittin' the same
What he says is irrelevant
Hip-Hop culture has changed
When I walk in the room
Young boys look at me strange
As if I am a relic
From some long forgotten game
It makes my blood boil
Turns my eyes to flames
I built an empire
They tried to kick me out in the rain
So I called on an inner power
It's hard to explain
It's like a holy spirit
Utilizing Hip-Hop slang
I'm beyond the gold grills
And logos on chains
You see I changed rap forever
I elevated the game
Launched the greatest label
In the history of rap
And for 24 years
I carried it on my back
I've always shined brighter
When I'm under attack
I might be down for a moment
But I always come back

It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war (Uh, yeah)
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war (Check it)
It's time for war

This is a resurrection
I'm back from the dead
They told me quit a long time ago
But I conquered instead
I had dreams and visions
Swirling around in my head
I had this hunger deep inside of me
That has to be fed
Hip-Hop will respect
All the blood that I shed
I have a covenant with God
I have swallowed the bread
Hip-Hop my co-defendant
With this mic I thee wed
I made an entire generation
Obey what we said
I'm talkin' France to Germany
From Italy to Japan
From London to Belgium
To Afghanistan
From Farmers Boulevard
Smokin' a blunt with my man
To writin' rhymes on a ironing board
To build Def Jam
You see, I'm the undisputed
King of all Hip-Hop
Everything after is my legacy
Like it or not
And I will keep making history
I can't stop
LL Cool J
Eternally hot

It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war

Look at how easily I flipped it
And switched the style around
Competition losin' their footing
I see them falling down
They will plot against me
It kills them because I'm ballin' now
Some of y'all didn't pick up the phone
But I got you callin' now
This is a job that must get done
Even if I become public enemy number one
If I had to pick up an Uzi
That weighs over a ton
I will attack Hip-Hop
Until competition is none
Nobody on God's earth wants it with L
You end up tortured
And trapped in psychological hell
And this is the beginning
Of a new era in rap
LL Cool J, feel the impact
It's okay if you call it a comeback
And let them know
I'm ready for combat
Tell those dumb motherfuckers to fall back
The crown looks wrong on your head
I want that

It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war

Imagine That,G.O.A.T. (Greatest of All Time),2000.0,"I just want you to fantasize with imagination
Know what I'm saying, uh yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah I like that
Give me some more, some more of my vocals
You know sex 'em up a little bit
You know what I mean?

You're the honey that I see when I'm riding by
The one giving me a feeling that I can't deny
You got the Prada boots on suede hitting your thigh
Acting like my chrome twenties ain't catching your eye
Sometimes I slow down catch the ass in the mirror
Turn the fog lights on to see the legs more clearer
You're turning me on, keep me standing up
I wish that I could prove to you that I'm man enough
I come up to your job and handcuff your boss
Throw that nigga in the closet and turn the lights off
Then sit you up on the copy machine
Make copies of your kitten with my chin in between
Then I'll take you to the window so the world can see
Baby I'm down on my knees let your world be free
Pearl tongue, come get up on this desk with me
Multiple orgasms is your destiny
Wet dream, ride like you're going to Queens
Like I just gave you fifty thou and ya just turned 18
To hell with your boss
Let that nigga hear you scream
Sounding like that screech on the fax machine
Then we can take it to the ladies bathroom
Make your mascara run till you look like a racoon
Touch yourself baby tell me it's wet
Squeeze tight so I'll never forget, here we go

I'ma get you for your paper
Make you leave you girl
(Imagine that)
Make you trick on me around the world
(Imagine that)
Have you calling me your ultimate thrill
(Imagine that)
I got you whipped tell your niggas to chill
I'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide
(Imagine that)
Me and my fold got my broads collide
(Imagine that)
Knocking girls off two at a time
(Imagine that)
Disrespect you and still make you mine (Uh-uh)

Uh, imagine I'm your teacher and you stayed after school
You've been a bad girl you broke all the rules
Forgot your homework, chewed gum in class
And the only way to fix it is to give me some ass
I got a three piece suit on sitting at my desk
I kinda need a shave but my body smell fresh
You're wearing a plad skirt and long white socks
The vibe is thick baby, we both red hot
I kiss your neck unbutton your blouse
Let my fingers make circles on the edge of your mouth
Your apple's so ripe I'm your tutor for life
Got your beggin' me to put you on detention tonight
You could read the Iliad and the whole Odyssey
But no Trojan soldier scold you like me
Match the calculus then measure my frequency
But when you blast on my lap that's the highest degree
Put your hands on the chalkboard scratch it with ya nails
Give me goose pimples when ya put yo tounge on my dimples
Baby feel me now you got yo ass suspended
Got a letter for your parents but I didn't wanna send it
I stopped by the crib you invited me in
You convinced me somehow to sip some juice and gin
Then you take me to your parent's room and laid me on my back
You twisting, kissing ya fist like that
Rubber meets the road till the tire goes flat
I filled it up with air again baby hold that
You a bad girl look you got your sheets all wet
Squeeze tight so i never forget the teacher's pet

I'ma get you for your paper
Make you leave you girl
(Imagine that)
Make you trick on me around the world
(Imagine that)
Have you calling me your ultimate thrill
(Imagine that)
I got you whipped tell your niggas to chill
I'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide
(Imagine that)
Me and my fold got my broads collide
(Imagine that)
Knocking girls off two at a time
(Imagine that)
Disrespect you and still make you mine (Uh-uh)

You was laughing with your girlfriends, sipping a drink
When I came up from behind you and wrapped you with my mink
Guided you to the dance floor and held you tight
We in the Tunnel in the back with the dim red lights
I'm rocking the tank top baby nothing but ice
You rocking the baby tee and mini skirts and spikes
The club is so black we can't see our own hands
I know you feel that bulge through them Fubu pants
You bold huh, wanna feel it in your hands
Rub your ass all up on it cause you know that I want it
God gave you beauty and you love to flaunt it
Life is a song, you were born to perform it
Drink the Cristal at the same time
Get intoxicated till we lose are minds
The crowd seperated as we start to shine
I lift you in the air your skirt starts to climb
We tongue kiss deep in front of the whole crowd
The lights start to flash the music is too loud
We hit the back door and jump in the limousine
You pull up your skirt I put some ice in between
You're tired from the dancing so I kiss your feet
Even though we outside I hear the bass from the beat
Funkmaster Flex chop it up for the freaks
DJ Enuff make the mommies wanna creep
No problem uh mi spouse no aqui
Tu muy caliente tu vamos con mi
Si mami I'm the chaffer make it whip
Take a ride bet you never forget, here we go

I'ma get you for your paper
Make you leave you girl

Make you trick on me around the world

Father,Phenomenon,1998.0,"I swear to tell the truth and nothin but the truth...
So help me God
I just felt like tellin the story of my life
Felt like, maybe somebody could be inspired, you know?
We all feel pain, we all go through things
But it's time to overcome all that

If your plane crashed in the water and everybody died
Would you drown on purpose or try to survive?
I was born handicapped my arm wouldn't move
They called me a cripple pops caught an attitude
Beat my moms smoked lye drove trucks
My moms had a miscarriage, he didn't give a fuck
He sniffed some coke, come home
Beat up on my moms cause she's talkin on the phone
Come on

(all I ever wanted)
All I ever wanted
(all I ever needed)
All I ever needed
(was a father)
Was a father
(that's all)
That's all!
(all I ever wanted)
All I ever wanted
(all I ever needed)
All I ever needed... was a father
(was a father)

Moms got tired of the beatings said, ""Yo, we got to go""
Packed up her bags we bounced out the do'
She said, ""I ain't takin these whippin's no mo'
I wanna live to see my little Todd grow""
I remember tear drops on my pops face
Lookin down at me standin on the staircase
Handsome brother with a smooth goatee
Makes me wonder why he act so ugly, you feelin me?

All I ever needed... was a father
(was a father)

My pops got drunk when me and my moms bounced
Swigged some Jack Dan', sniffed up a ounce
Grabbed the shotty left Long Isle for Queens
Possesed by a demon... a devil it seemed
I was too young to understand the risk
When your moms come home off the midnight shift
She turned around heard the shotgun click
My pops said, ""You think that you could leave me {bitch}?""
He blasted my moms in the back
She fell down screamin I can't forget that
My grandfather tried to close the do'
He got shot ten times in the stomach yo, for real

That's all!

All I ever wanted

All I ever needed... was a father
(was a father)

My head was spinnin, I had never seen blood
Four years old, this don't feel like love
Anyway, pops dissapeared
Grandpops and moms healed up over the years
This therapist got up in her head
Led her to believe without him she'd be dead
You know, they fell in love with one another
Everything seemed right that's word to mother
Until I started gettin beatings everday
Sometimes for going outside to play
Late at night on my knees I'd pray
A young child, wishin the pain would go away
Dad where was you when he made me strip
Beat with belts like a slave with a whip
Kicked me down steps outside in the snow
Punched me in the chest stomped me out on the flo'
That's just the tip of the iceberg look
It's too long for a song but perfect for a book
Word is bond, that's real baby

All I ever needed

The Breakthrough,Bigger and Deffer,1987.0,"Knuckleheads spreadin' gossip all over town
Every time I drive by you're just standin' around
Hundred-bottles in your pocket, forty-dog in your hand
Don't you know you're just a worker and your boss is my man?
L.L. this, L.L. that, soon as I walk in the place
I wanna take my gun and shoot you in your muthafuckin' face
You're playin' me too close with the schemin' and games
I guess the beef and the bullshit is the price of fame
Movies, records, goin' on tour
Twenty-thousand people hip-hoppin' on the floor
Whole parties body-rockin', and everything's chill
Get back to New York, and the suckers act ill
See I fought with the devil, made a promise to God
I have experience in goin' all the way to the top
It's harder harder than hard
All the suckers are barred
You used to try to talk down now your ego is scarred
See the problem is you want what another man has
His car, his wife, or his razzamatazz
But that's weak, you gotta do work on your own
Cuz when you're rich you got friends
But when you're poor you're alone
So get your own on your own, it'll strengthen your soul
Stop livin' off your parents like you're three years old
Instead of walkin' like you're limp and talkin' yang about me
Why don't you take your monkey-ass and get a college degree?
Or write a rhyme and ride a bike and try to live carefree
Hope my message reaches you before you're seventy-three
A old man, when people ask you what you did with your life
You'll say ""I hated L.L. and I carried a big knife""
Every day is a chase, every day is a race
And every day you're being overpowered by my bass
Too much juice to be a deuce, I had to be a ace
It's like the fire's in my eyes and the gun's in my face
I'm stompin' stupid knuckleheads until they bleed
I'm the leader of the show, so it's up to me to lead
I'mma lead you away from drugs and petty crime
Lead you away from wack beats and rhyme
Lead you to that ticket line
So you can come in my show and watch the stars shine
Get busy, not dizzy, wanna teach the young
The last man who didn't listen ended up gettin' hung
Not that I killed him, it's just
He didn't wanna trust
The words of a master that's why you must
Take heed to the speech, it's gonna reach your ear
Don't try to say you can't hear cuz the words are clear
Throwin' flurries, punks scurry and I bury the rest
You better hurry up and rock a rhyme and give it your best
Cuz tonight's the night we gonna see the big fight
Twelve-gauge on the stage in case it don't go right
E-Love drives a tank, he's strong like a truck
If you're cryin' while you're dyin' we ain't givin' a fuck
L.L. Cool J is on the microphone
Tellin' all you punk ducks ""Leave me the hell alone""
Cuz I'm rated X, born to snap necks
Straight up and down, no special effects
I'm the professor, the teacher, the hip-hop dean
If Russia bombed the U.S., they'd be scared to touch Queens
Cuz that's where I live, and this is what I give
Turnin' top-notch crews into fugitives
They run, they frightened, they hide from King Titan
Like a sniper when he's shootin' or a viper when he's bitin'
Here I am, tellin' the truth
And I'm spreadin' the word to my fellow youth
It goes man-to-man and jam-to-jam
I got hip-hop, rock, and love song fans
All you petty MC's in the state of New York
Gettin' a thousand for a show but you still wanna squawk
Can't get a decent contract, your beats ain't workin'
Dogged-out Pumas plus you're manager's jerkin'
Your mic sounds weak, remember that skeezer
I'm badder than Napoleon, Hitler or Caesar
I'm a hitman, but I'm not for hire
Fly girl's desire, the man you admire
Not only on the stage, I rock in the park
And I'm a killer in the daytime, and worse after dark
So don't never ever mess with the king of the sound

Give Me Love,Authentic,2013.0,"Give me love
I swear all I need is your heart (your heart)
Uh baby
Give me love
Tell me where you need me to stop
I swear all I need is your love

Honestly, I'm afraid to give love
Deep down I'm afraid to be judged
That's why I pull back, don't speak no rap
Put on the beat, man every time we hug
It's deep, I'm afraid of heartbreak so much
The thought alone feels like my soul got cut
My heart's wide open, baby show me mercy
Life is a desert and for love I'm thirsty
You lead me to the water, I'm afraid to drink
You hand me a glass, still don't know what to think
Your love is terrifying, I'm standing on the brink
I'm floating in your eyes then I start to sink
Girl, I never knew that I could feel so weak
Flying on a cloud in-between these sheets
I'm one with myself, why do I retreat?
It's a battle just to try to go to sleep

Give me love
I swear all I need is your heart (that's alright)
Uh baby
Give me love
Tell me when you need me to stop
I swear all I need is your love

Give it to me baby
I swear all I need is your love

Everybody knows that falling in love's easy, timing out's hard
So the only one who really knows my thoughts is God
It's crazy, I hold you in the highest regard
But us having true love? What's the odds?
That's scary, what if I get hit that hard
So hard I can't get up, heart got lit up
Too weak to move, can't eat, won't sit up
Mommy used to say – don't worry, it's just a hiccup
But even she can't help
When your heart's on fire and about to melt
So everything I really feel, I keep it to myself
So I don't end up hurt like everybody else
Took love off the bat, burn I put it on the shelf
With the books I never read about pain I never felt
Love is a problem, baby I need help
My card's on the table and my heart's breaking me up

Give me love
I swear all I need is your heart (I swear)
Uh baby
Give me love
Tell me when you need me to stop
I swear all I need is your love

Give it to me baby (you baby)
Give it to me baby (from you baby)
Give it to me baby (yea)
Give it to me
Just give me your heart
Give it to me baby
Uh baby
Give it to me baby
Uh girl
Give it to me baby
I swear all I need is your love

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
When the last chapter's done, I hope you're mine
Yea

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
When the last chapter's done, I hope you're mine
But until that try

Give me love

Ba-ha-ha-ha...
Yes, yes, y'all
 Ah, ah
That's funky
 Yeah
Hey yo, Marley, man
 Yo, what's up, man?
 Hey yo, man
You know
We was gettin' busy on the album everyday
We been gettin' funky, but
I wanna take this jam back to Farmers
Knowmsayin?
 Yo, let's go back on Farmers
And get some of them early MC's
You used to be kickin' it with back in the day?
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 Yo, let's do a jam with them
 Aight, bet
But first I gotta like introduce it
Youknowmsayin?
 Aight, kick it...
(Farmers Boulevard)

Back in the days, before I was Cool J
I used to hang up on the corner, pumpin' ""Games People Play""
Sittin' on a garbage can, rhymin' to my man
Talkin' 'bout big money and future plans
I always told the brothers, if I got a contract
When the money started flowin', I'd be back
To do a jam, against all odds
Introducing rapper 1 from Farmers Boulevard

Hey yo, B-o-m-b, bomb explosion
Attack like a cat when I'm trapped and I'm closed in
Sharp-ass claws, and I break all laws
In a while all jaws, 'cause I'm perfect, no flaws
Now I'm back to Farmers on some new improved
(Sh...) I'm makin' moves, not fakin' moves
So don't you never come around here, talkin' that talk
Or walkin' that walk, you'll get played like a sport
Football, soccer, whatever you savor
You're a tramp and a pussycat, ready for labor
Ha! L'll have you breaking locks
I'll have you cooking fried rice in a big steel wok
The type of skills that I got reigned for years
No worry or cares, your crew'll shed tears
'Hip-hip-hooray, he's back!' Yo, save the cheers
Suckers, I'm drinkin' forties of beers
On the Boulevard
 Funky, funky, funky rhymes bein' said here
 Hey yo, hey yo
Hey yo Uncle L, let's go...
 Yeah man, I wanna check out my man Big Money Grip
Yo, what's up, man
Kick a little somethin'

Kick out the can and slam
Summertime, C.I.A. step into the jam
Reach for the mic, and the punks start to fold up
And the brothers start fleein' like it's a hold-up
Some step aside, but a few play me close
Never worry, 'cause the brother who cross me's gettin buried
And the fool who wants to deal with another dose
I see to it in a hour that the mutha...'s comatose
Farmers Boulevard, the place
Handin' me a mic is like givin' a chainsaw to Leatherface
Smokin' MC's in an instant
At my side bustin' caps is T-Boogie, my assistant
Throw that speaker in the trash
Why's that? 'Cause Gangster Boogie gave the woofer a gash
Big Money Grip makin' you get up
Farmers Crew's in effect, we never heard of a head-up
 Yo, yo, yo
It's kinda funky out here on the boulevard, yo
 
Yeah, we livin' Chinese people in a Turkish bath, baby
 Hi C over there, man
 Yo, what's up Hi C...

Hi C on the scene, at last to bust a funky rhyme
More than a line on time, because I'm gettin' mine
Never underestimate the skill of a great one
The Boulevard Lord, shorts, never take none
Another funky rapper from around the way
Leavin' bodies at a party, 'cause somebody gotta pay
Boy, you been told, put your lips on hold
All you remember is a barrel and a mouth full of gold
Spreadin' terror on the street like they was in the past
Any punks on the block, yo, never could last
And I never feel sorry for a sucker I gained on
Any slick talker, yo, he's bound to get rained on
At any Farmers party at my side is a Mag
(One time a sucker got ill and went out in a bodybag)
Fear will erupt through the heart of another
The Farmers Crew will never fall, that's word to the mother
 Yo, yo
It's kinda funky out here
Yo, yo, yo, Hi C
Yo man, y'all kinda funky out here, yo
I was -
Yo, what's up?
 ...9 years ago, man
Youknowmsayin?
 
Farmers Boulevard, baby
 Yo, I was kinda -
I was kinda stagnant to sleep on it
But yo, L
Won't you - won't you sum it all up for the people, aight?
 Aight, let me sum this up

Now you heard the brothers speakin' 'bout the street that we're from
Rhymes hittin', beats kickin', you can't get none
F-A-R-M-E-R-S passin' the test
Marley Marl in the background doin' the rest
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, do-ti-la-so-fa-mi-re-do, Kato
Get up out my face before I play you like Play-Doh
I did a jam against all odds
And it was dedicated to Farmers Boulevard

The Power of God,Mama Said Knock You Out,1990.0,"Somethin real smooth
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
We'll get into the groove
Power of God move
Somethin real smooth
Somethin you need to take heed to

A basehead cleaned up his act
He stopped smokin crack and took his soul back
Decided, he could find a much better way to live
You know the way - positive
Without all the negative chemicals and drugs
Without all the hangin with the envious thugs
Never before was a man so far behind
And came back to rule for a long time
Positive will explode when you light me
My enemies lurked, and they held the dagger tightly
Wanted to taste my blood, but they got scarred
When they felt the power of God

Wickedness got crushed when the Lord came
Down with the King, cause he's evil and vain
He doesn't understand the power of a ???
Doesn't realize I'm rollin with a team
Avengin angels will come and burn
All those who saw, but refused to learn
He has no color, no shape, and no form
And like I told you before, I'm just gettin warm
Get up, get down, get on it, it ain't that hard
You can feel the power of God

Money is small and the soul stands tall
All those who don't realize this fall
The mind of a drunken fool is a useless tool
And it's cool to be in school
And overcome and overpower, but still uplift
Your mind is a gift
You're somebody, whether you know it or not
Outside the weather is hot
People walk around with their minds in a daze
Never take the time to stop and give praise
You're lucky to live in this world
Even the starvin boys and girls
Cause life is a gift in itself
And only certain people are blessed with good health
I'm Uncle L, but you can call me Todd
I can feel the power of God

Y’know what i’m sayin’
And G is the seventh letter made
Yeah
G is the seventh letter made
The power of God
Yeah

The babies, we gotta teach em, and hold em
Send em to school, so we can teach em, and mold em
Shape em, and make em take form
Cause their mind is like a ball of clay when it's wet and warm
Harmless and innocent
Until they're taught to be violent, and militant
This mentality gotta be erased by faith
The 12th hour is comin', we're close to the 8th
Get a chapter, and gain some knowledge
If not from the Bible or Koran, get a book from college
It's not about bein black or white
It's about everybody bein a right
I pulled out my mic, and the devil got hit hard
He felt the power of God

And G is the seventh letter made
Power of god
G is the seventh letter made

That was just a word to the wise
Uprise
Cause we definitely gotta unify
And we need unity in times like these
We got to stick together
Cause we as a people
All people
Gotta make it to the promised land

Go L.L., go L.L., go L.L

Get down, hard like 
Haystacks Calhoun
Callin me a sucker boy you're pushin a broom
If you try to pull a ace you'll get a punch in the face
All eyes are on my posse when we walk in the place
Not the Cunningham family from Happy Days
Not the boys who play the bench for the Oakland A's

Cut Creator cut the record so they don't forget

Got a can full of jams pullin off the lid
Competition in New York can't do what I did
No Cinderella story, I paid my dues
I rocked at house parties I was down with crews
Now I'll never be caught I'm on my P's and Q's
And for the rest of your life you wanna be in my shoes
I'm strong like stone, hard like cement
And I rocked every jam that I ever went
Cause I got a better reppin than any emcee has

The only man you should call on when the party is packed
From Paris to L.A they say I'm sharp as a pin
When it's a Cool J party you gotta get in
So I can make you kick steps like Gladys Knight and the Pips
One rhyme, you're on my tip, soon as it leaves my lips
Up the block kids are talkin and spreadin the news
About the new grandmaster the one you'll choose
Cause I'm treacherous, I wanna stomp the rest
What I'm kickin' couldn't bore, it can only impress
I'm not a Hula-Hoop, this ain't no passin' phase
Hard work pays, I'm gettin straight-up A's

Brace yourself, I'm the ace with grace
I'm a win the race and make you feel disgrace
In any case, yo, I'm movin like a steeplechase
MC soldiers: about face
Now step off, I need room for my takeoff
My custom made lyrics slay, yours are soft
I think you better tape this, yo, you can't escape this
Yo, I planned it out just like a landscapist
Whipper-snapper back up for comin' crap up
I plan to trap a MC and kidnap a phony
So skip the baloney
You and your cronies need to jump on a pony
And roll, cause you're just a rookie
When it was time for rap school, you must have played hooky
I'm the show-stopper, your rhymes are improper
I'ma teach you like the master taught the grasshopper
Just gettin warmer, I'm a transform a
Regular rhyme into a barnstormer
Try to jump, I'll pump you, chump, my job is thorough
Any MC, state, city or borough will get ragged
I drop like a sandbag
Serious as the mob, I don't play tag
Best of the batch, no man can catch up
Holes can't be patched, our battle's a mismatch
I flip lyrics like a acrobat
And avoid combat like a diplomat
But when it's time for back-crack, or Jack to kill
It's a thrill to drill, a run-of-the-mill bill
With my skill, I'm the lord of rhymes
And I be writing at a rapid pace way past my bedtime
I rock the mic unlike some brothers I know
I guess they flow, PSYCH!

I'm droppin 'em
Droppin 'em
Yo, you're all in, stiff as a mannequin
I'm sharp as a pin, and I'ma teach discipline
I get busy like it's two of me
Evidently, I'm hated by a few MCs
But so what? I just max like I'm playing the sax
And take the crowd to the climax
Yo, Cool J, I never go astray
I'm funky, you can hear me at the Milky Way
You're weak, wet grass, I'm cool as jazz
Got razamatazz, ask my man Shabazz
I know you're afraid because I'm self-made
I invade, and blow up like a hand grenade
MCs are terrorstruck, I'ma run amok
Cause your rhymes suck, you made a record on potluck
Just a toyboy, can't stop my convoy
Rhymes I said last year were just decoys
I'm like a fox, you annoy me like chicken pox
I'm back with a style that's unorthodox
You must've had a teaspoon full of bull
I'm like The Hulk, with more bulk, I'm powerful
They try to get with this, to me that's an insult
Boys shouldn't mess with an adult, that's too difficult
I enter like a giant saying ""fee fi foe fum""
Then rock the auditorium until there's pandemonium

I'm droppin 'em
Droppin 'em
Don't sleep, cause I'ma go deeper
All you sleepers, I'm the Grim Reaper
My rhymes are rising, the angle's getting steeper
I hated Mussolini, Martini so I'ma sweep a
Emcee, like he's one of the two
Break him into fragments right in front of you
Mic check, one, two, is too fundamental
My rhymes are monumental over an instrumental
In the center, I had to enter
Tormentor mentor experimenter and inventor
Of lyrics, so all you nonbelievers
It'll echo in your dreams at night when you receive a
Rude awakening, you can't do anything
You enter my kingdom and you cry as men bring
Gifts to the prince of excellence and magnificence
Alarm clock rings, you wake up, and you're convinced
That the crew invader, soloist exterminator
Greater evader of ducks, concert crusader
Is bad, my nickname's the circuit breaker
Eating up the world, acre by acre

I'm droppin 'em, word to motha
Droppin 'em

Pressure bus fights, relax, you’ll be fine
Ll got the remedy intervention divine
I gave you the gift for missing me

For your loving, (i put it all on the line)

Let me love you babe, I won’t make you wait
Can you take it, (take it), take it, (take it), take it?

Ignore the clock, it’s time to make the bed rock
This hood, we don’t even hear the sirens or gun shots
I’m stroking you’re floating and what not
Skin sticky but no hickies, better knock
The tensions tie, i’m outside the box
I pin on your balloon without making it pop
It feels like new year’s but 2 balls drop
Almost at the top, now you begging me to stop


Take a ride, look down in my eyes
Flooded like my chain I can drown in your thighs
A little bit of pain brings joy to your life
Lay your head back, relax and get right
Souls unified beneath the moonlight
It’s only you and i, no other invites
I wanna see you naked, watch you take it

Rollin' with Rush it don't get no rougher
I'll snuff a huffer and puffer, a brother'll suffer
I was holding back the man superior, right?
You wanna take my title, yo, you'll be alright
You stand below the plateau I stand on
You want perfection? Then put the man on
I shake and bake and break the laws of gravity
And if you chew on, you'll get a cavity
Cause I'm a giant, and you're a peewee
And all that LL shit, you can't see me
You're cheap and weak, incomplete and off-beat
Ehem! Cause it gets no rougher
It gets no rougher
Yo man, you know how to take out all the ABC emcee's youknowhatI'msayin'?
Your cuttin' ain't no joke, yo L, release the juice on 'em
(LL Cool J)
I release the juice smack dab in your face
Do damage, I'm picking up the pace
My mic's like a torch when I'm walking at nighttime
Straight to the dome, it's like a pipeline
High speed, stronger than Thai-Weed
Before you pick up the mic to get fly you need
All the dope tactics that you can feature
So I can serve you, you know the procedure
Listen to the man intellectualize, visualize
Your whole posse getting paralyzed
I don't wanna hear no alibis, don't apologize
Eh-ehem, I'll put the highs in your eyes
The bass in your face, like a District Attorney, I'm on the case
With rhymes that'll hit ya, will get ya and sit ya down
The competition is booty, get the picture now?
Skip the rigamarole, to give me-a-go
I'm figuring yo, nigga you know
I won't allow, not now, no way, no how
Any form of disrespect, you better bow
Comp gets romped and swamped, I do it prompt
In between my jaws adversaries got chomped
The cordless mic's my only utensil
Lyrics you be running, I break 'em like a pencil
Cause I'm massive, and you're a small fry
You're all in, a stunt, a fall guy
Out of order, I slaughter wax and make you suffer
Cause it gets no rougher, it gets no rougher
Shut up, Now got attention to get
And drop these L dope lyrics on you, the beat is pumpin', youknowI'msayin'?
Tell 'em
(LL Cool J)
Let me ask you ask a question...
Who could take the game of rap and rule it alone
Demonstrate many styles on the microphone
Build an empire like an African King
I had to show and prove Jack the Ripper could swing
I'm a rapper's nightmare, I crush my opponents
There's only one title: I own it
Emcees flip-flop, I bust out the workshop
They try to eavesdrop the way the man rock
Aerodynamically, it's all automatically
The way I articulate, full of originality
Chase, chop 'em and stop 'em like a cheetah and an antelope
Then I cut 'em like a cantalope - on the table
They ain't able, I'm a legend, not a fable, gotta keep it stable
Crack your back bone, hotter than brimstone
Doing you justice overseeing like a chaperone
Huh, on the hip-hop scene, I got shit sewn up like a sewing machine
Eat a rapper like a sandwich, leave 'em in a bandage
Crack the stage and leave the audience damaged
(Interlude: LL Cool J)
Yeah, get funky on that cut, get funky on it
(Yo, L, them lyrics is dope man youknowI'msayin'?
You been raw sick for years..) this how we do it dogg
(...Pump that good man, let's cut us some real, real somethin')
Yo, bust this
(LL Cool J)
I'm kinda like a soldier, see I told ya
When I pick up the mic I'mma hold ya
Captive, I'm active, I make sure the track give
Hell to speakers, sell the sneakers, your backs' getting weaker
I freak the beat and get shieker
Move over King, you're too over-eager
To try to make a move for
I'mma prove you're
Ridiculous I think he was jealous and in the mood for
An ass-kicking when you mess with
The man with the plan
Mic in his hand and a fresh skit
R-O-U-G-H-E-R, rougher, so here we are
Face to face, mic to mic, man to man
While your battleship's sinking in quicksand
Dropping to the bottom like a two-ton anchor
And I break, pull a rank, point blank, I'mma spank a
Rapper like a brat, step on 'em like a mat
My DJ Cut Creator scratch a record like a cat
E at my side with pride we got a bigger rep
Sfff... smoke the mic like a cigarette
Every puff is rough, a pull could kill a bull
One toke, joke crews will choke
I run through rappers like water through rubber hoses
Nigga, I'm comin' up roses
Step back, I got the title
Bear witness to a dope recital
I've killed many men my friend
And I'mma do it again and again and again
Cause it gets no rougher
(Outro: LL Cool J)
You know what I'm saying? I'm ruling this game
It don't get no rougher, peace, LL Cool J",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-it-gets-no-rougher-lyrics

New York Gangsters,UnKnown,UnKnown,"* cut from retail release of ""Exit 13""

Once I live a life of a millionaire
Still do!
Spending my money, honey ohh I didn't care
Still don't!

I'ma floss 'til I die, ball never fall
Cop 'til I drop, motherfuck 'em all
Count paper schemin, leanin on the wall
Money comin fast, niggas ridin balls
I been to hell and back, I seen what you saw
6 in the mornin, D's at the door
I was a shorty on a bike, hangin with 
Alpo
I was a shorty uptown with 
Rich Porter
I was a shorty up on 1, 3, 2
My man 
AZ
 he really schooled me
My man Big Chuck, he took me to Mt. V
I messed up the count, Kev winked at me
What I learned is niggas need paper to burn
And you gotta spread love when cats is fucked up
You can't be lazy, for niggas that's bad fuck
Sometimes you move quiet and lay upin the cut (whattup)


I learned if you talk to much you get that ass shot up
Follow your dreams, and watch the cash pile up
I used to be in Queens with my man 
Black Just
Before he got killed, now that nigga was real
He took me to the crib, showed me how gangsters live
Took me to hot blocks, showed me big knots
Him and Richard Porter used to tease me and what not
You ain't movin pies, so your car can be fly
Used to run to Big Kev before he got knocked
When niggas was stuntin and wouldn't let me on the block
125th in the Beemer with AZ
He gave a bum 50 dollars that really taught me
That being a gangster don't mean you're all bad
And niggas respect you when they know you got cash
Remember Big dave had the dust on smash
I was amazed the lifestyle was so fast


I remember Remy showed my his first 8th ki'
That was before Queens had blood in the street
Stretch from BK had the pretty gold Benz
He took me out to Brooklyn where he was gettin some ends
Let me state this again, I ain't gotta pretend
They was playing the money game and I wanted in
I was just a young boy with dangerous friends
If it wasn't for rap, who knows where I would've been
I took a hustlas heart to make the top of the charts
Big Chuck when to jail when i was ready to start
I guess i was destin, God pulled us apart
But I admit, getting that street money is a art
I was so many players I knew back in the D
Like Cuban Alberto from Mi-ami
'86 that nigga's Benz had TV's
Only God knows what these niggas mean to me

Shut ’Em Down,G.O.A.T. (Greatest of All Time),2000.0,"I can shut a nigga down so quick my sounds so sick
My talents spread around while I'm holdin' my dick
Ridiculous shit flip immaculate
Evolutionary flows y'all want more dough
Bang with the best, get a vest, all the rest, should've blessed
Rip a nigga from the East to the West
Just a lyrical maze, lyrical days
God works in mysterious ways
I'm the warlord of war relieve the raw dog
Niggas ain't even comin' close to my low score
Niggas fleein' when I'm rippin' on the hardcore beat
That's slammin' through your jeep like a .44 MAC to your back
Nigga L never got ripped by a track
I don't fuck around, always come back
For the lyrical miracle day one platinum plaque right off the bat
Looked at every nigga with the mic on my arm
A time-bomb blowin' up ring the alarm
Cool double O flow well to the LL
I'm leave the world looking hard as hell

I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)

I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)

To the next plateau niggas bet my flow
Betta bet I role with more control
Gotta bring the heat that eliminate who can't compete
Spit razors to rip the beat
Relentless endless friendless when it comes to the lyrical mack
Now off my back stack 'em drag 'em now feds waggin'
Hear you fasten place on the blood of my veins without passion
Mashin take a little time to think the rhyme out
How to find out
Bump and grind out
Pump the lines out
I'ma show what the microphone is all about without doubt
C to the double O bounce in the bubble eye limo
No I ain't checkin' for you bull shit demo
Every time you hear me in a battle I'm lethal
Nigga too sweet 'n low you ain't equal

I shut 'em down
I shut 'em down
I shut 'em down

I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)

I can take you to the level if I let my phantom
Nigga bout to rule the world with one anthem
Kidnapped rap for a handsome ransom
Smoke a little Branson on the side of the mansion
Keep it thugged out even when a nigga dancing
Branson make that trans and keep it dancing
I'ma murder every nigga in the game
Can't stand the rain
Fuck a maintain
Gotta leave the world in flames
Nigga wanna live life stay out of my lanes
Tryin' to read my name
Here's a murderous combo with you on your pain
Sideways stimulator bringin' the flames
Niggas wanna feel me spit the whole clips
Sing along it will split your lip
.45 with a name on the grip
Niggas said you wanna battle
Nigga now talk shit

Yo what am I, an animal?
'Cause I bagged your's too
One bad mooley, nigga you can't school me
I'm the G.O.A.T., what I wrote cause fire and smoke
To think I started on the choir singin' solo for the pope
Tell your mama please, get up off her knees
You can't wear yellow spandex with a ass like cottage cheese
Open toed shoes, feet smell like collard greens
Toes Kriss Krossed like she on J. Dupri's team
Bunyon you're sittin' up like beach balls in the sand plus
A mouth full of rotten teeth with a dildo in her hand
Who the fuck let you in, all my assistants are fired
Now I'm lookin' for some washed up rapper that I can hire
You know some old school nigga with a bit of attitude
Pay him $1500 to fuck a girl in an interlude
You say I'm souped up, well, soup is good food
So what I scratch my nuts, HOW THE FUCK IS THAT RUDE?
For soul glowin, afro pickin'
S-curl hatin', Jamaican rum sippin'
Kid I'll burp on your girl buttcheeks
'Cause honey had my nuts like two red beets
I'm bananas, out of my fuckin mind they won't let me back in
'Cause I was down before the hype like Dusty Rhodes and Bob Backlund
Bruno Samartino, Stan Staziak

Jack you for the cheeseburgers and chicken wings, and Daytons too
See my boys down the ride crack patience too
Bricks, walk around, snorkel down
Macaroni and cheese Timbs broke out the orphan house
Transportin out, the poison in 'em
Box 'em up in the aisle with the frozen dinners
And them niggas that ran...
My goal's to get 'em
With the heat seekin' flow with, fo' antennas
Doc's Da Name, that's why y'all fuck with me
I'm pocket change, the bums don't fuck with D
Objective in 'em, Carlo inspection sticka

That's right y'all this is the LL Cool J party
Move it, move it, move it, get on the floor baby
That's right, don't try to front like your fly
GET OUT THERE!
(LL Cool J)
To rappers I'm a nightmare on Elm Street
Hellafied hotter than heat, guess why the other's can't eat?
Cause I'm a carnivore and I can eat much more
Than a fat man after a pack-a-jam
L.L.'s thicker than butter, well-known throat cutter
When I'm involved all the amateurs stutter
They're scared and can't believe that their whole crew
Ain't a rapper alive that can fill my shoes
I'm dope on a rope, virgins wanna elope
I do the hustle and the shuffle and the rope-a-dope
Cause I'm the hardest hard rock in the hard rock town
I gotta .357 and I break it on down
(LL Cool J)
Three hundred and fifty seven reasons
Why you gotta get your butt on the floor right now
We ain't playin, we came here to get ill
Iller than ill, LL youknowI'msayin?
(LL Cool J)
Just like Ali Baba and the 40 thevz
So nasty you don't know whether to stay or leave
More feared, than even Blue Beard, I serve Primrose
A picture of me, is like one of Michelangelo's
I don't play the banjo will you ever understand yo
Servin I mean the matter how old I go Rambo
Cock-strong, half a block long
Illy ill fire starter hittin harder than King Kong
Not a battle-axe, not run-of-the-mill
Not easily knocked out or easily killed
Cause I'm the hardest hard rock in the hard rock town
I gotta .357 and I break it on down

A hundred and ninety five pounds, punk
More bounce to the ounce and I say what counts
KnowI'msayin?
Now get yourself on the floor
Stop actin like a sissy
(LL Cool J)
Boy, I'm better than better is, badder than badder is
I won't scare em or dare em I'll just splatter his
Guts kick his butt while Bob is rockin the cuts
Wanna step in the ring with me, you must be nuts
Not Isis in a crisis, or Freddy when he's ready, or Jason when he's chasin'
My silhouette, a scene I mean I'm icin' and acin'
Amateurs who lack it, can't hack it, I attack it, that's why I wanna crack it
They're sellin' the soul of little kids who can't roll
I told em, scold em, teach em and mold em
Get paid ten knots at a time and then I fold em
I remember the blood and I remember what told em
I can, can't cause I'm down with E yet you have the audacity
To try and mess with M-E
Hypersonic is weak and Supersonic is wack
Sneak around after midnight, like a Siamese cat
Pellum (1, 2, 3)
 
catch twenty-two
 I'm H-A-R-D
I'm the hardest hard rock in the hard rock town
I gotta .357 and I break it on down
(LL Cool J)
A beatdown can be arranged
Yo baby you look fine spread em
Yo homeboy get up against the wall, what's this in your pocket
What is this?
Move it, move it, move it

I'm a nappy, sappy crappy imitator of who
If I ever imitated it wouldn't be you, ooooh
You don't know so many have died when the LL growl was amplified
Get back better yet step back get dat
Like Shaft and The Mack, cause I'm mad and I'm black
I'm the perfect blend, a good boyfriend
I'm the reason rap rules the country, I'm Cool
J-A-M-E-S; fresh as a cliche, but soul is my forte
Disco is out, rhythm and blues is old news
P's and Q's keep me in new shoes
And you're dissin me because I'm young and I'm strong
And I'm capable of making a platinum LP
Wrong you was, you assumed I was all in
But boy is for ballin they'll never say I'm fallin
Callin all cars for the brother in black
L-E-L the Mack back bone of this track
The force full of force to put you on your back
Makin' hit after hit, while you search for a contract
Hotter than hot now watch how hot I can get
Leavin' rappers freeze-dried and skimmer's dimmer's wet
Cause I'm the hardest hard rock in the hard rock town
I gotta .357 and I break it on down
(LL Cool J)
Now the LL posse is now handin out speed knots
To all those who don't want to get busy
That's right baby get your body on the floor
Move it, move it

Big Mama (Unconditional Love),10,2002,"Yeah, this one's dedicated, to my grandmother, and your grandmother
It's all love, let's not forget who raised us, word up

Big Mama, my grandmother, my main girl
I love you much more than the scandalous world
As a young boy you gave me whoopings to save my life
Cursed me out, to keep me out the streets at night
Cause my momma had me when she was young
So you took on the responsbility to raise your grandson
You taught me if a task is once begun, Todd
Never leave it 'til it's done, Todd
Be thy labor great or small Todd
Do it well or not at all, God
Big Mama, my blood is your blood
When the whole world's against me, I know I got your love
If I was in a cell for the rest of my life
I know I'd hear your prayers in the middle of the night
Used to sit me on your lap and teach me mother wit
Early Sunday morning for them salmon and grits
I love you baby, you the one and only, that's a fact
'Til death do us part, I'ma always have your back
You beefed cause you heard that I was cursin in my raps
Eighty-six, still you wanna run and get the straps
I love you, I promise you I care for you deep
Cause when I had bronchitis you would rock me to sleep
Rub me down with green alcohol
Little brown-skinned lady bout five feet tall, Big Mama
 + (LL)
Early one Sunday morning
Breakfast was on the table (you gave me unconditional love)
There was no time to eat, she said to me
Boy hurry to Sunday school (you gave me unconditional love)

I remember when you told me certain friends wasn't real
I didn't wanna listen, I swore I knew the deal
Come to find out, everything you said was true
Who I end up goin to for advice?  You
I love you, that's why you got nurses and maids
Ever since I got paid, you ain't never been afraid
That's granddaddy wife, she taught me how to think
How to navigate through life, you made the sacrifice
You kept on livin, cause when my granddaddy died
It took all your might, but you ain't quit on life
We took trips down South, biscuits and chicken
Me you granddad and Alison, trippin
Remember, you used to pick me up from junior high
And classmates laughed when the Buick rolled by
Remember, I pulled my privates out in class
And from Farmers to Dunkirk you straight whooped my (woo!!)
The best cookin a man could ever taste
It's written in my heart, it can never be erased
Thank you so much, you taught me well
How to not get souped up, because I'm LL
How to walk the street, and hold my head real high
How to live with Christ and not be afraid to die
We sipped daquiris, but you never told moms
We even shared beers, Big Mama my dear
A toast to a woman that raised a man
In popular demand all across the land
You're my lawyer, my teacher, my doctor, my friend
My mother, my father, you with me 'til the end
I love you, I mean that from the bottom of my heart
That's the reason why my record's #1 on the charts
I'ma tell it like it is, I love you forever
Dead or alive, we'll always be together
Big Mama I love you


I dedicate this to the Big Mama's everywhere
The ones who raised us - when nobody else was there
The ones who held us and told us it'll be alright
When gunshots was goin off every night
Taught us how to lock the door and check the peephole
And how to swallow Vicks when we had a chest cold
How to stay proud, and represent hard
Eat plenty baby, but first say grace for God
Big Mama, I'ma miss you
When one of us leave this earth
But baby for what it's worth, I love you since the date of my birth
And if it wasn't for my children, I would wanna go first
You're the reason I'm the man I am today
The inspiration, for me to be LL Cool J
When you told me ""Knock 'Em Out,"" I brought you home a Grammy
I learned to be tough from Big Mama and Aunt Cammy
A black man that was raised by black women
On tour, sippin your special honey and lemon
You told me, gargle with vinegar water and salt
The concert was hot, thanks to your support
Girl - you're the one I love
Whether right here with me or smilin from up above
Trouble or no trouble, you always had my back
So I had to let you know your son appreciates that, Big Mama

Old School New School,Exit 13,2008.0,"Classic, uh, uh, uh
I'd like to welcome ya'll to Exit 13
My name is LL Cool J
AKA the GOAT
R. Leslie on the track, uh, uh, uh

I told ya'll that I would make a killing
I told ya'll I blow like Mount St. Helen's
I told ya'll I'm the truth, they paint me like a villain
Sick on paper, the inch to penicillin
I told ya'll the real, they started catching feelings
Muthafuck 'em all, throw ya L's to the ceiling
Cool J, still hotter than a helicopter crashing in lava
Still sweeter to the ladies than a box of Godiva
Music industry is like a game of cops and robbers
Too many Indians, no chiefs to follow
What I'm sowing today, I be reaping tomorrow
So here's some joyful bars, to replace your sorrow
I'm beyond a legend, I'm iconic
Fall off, rebuild, your man's bionic
Put your trust in me, I never let you down
I always come up with a way to checkmate these clowns
I effeminate these clowns, trynna take me down
Ask Puffy and Nas, who '
hates me now
'
The Phenomenon, ladies love the don
I give 'em an ear-gasm, they can't keep calm
(Chorus: LL Cool J)
Old school, new school, need to learn though
I burn baby burn like disco inferno
Old school, new school, need to learn though
I burn baby burn like disco inferno

I told ya'll that I was coming back
I told ya'll I ain't going out like that
I told ya'll I was the greatest to ever rap
And I built Def Jam and took a piss on the map
I told ya'll, I wasn't like the other cats
I'm fresh like a Wii, them niggas playing jacks
They all a bunch of a rats, they copying off 2Pac's stats
Wearing tuxedos to hide they tight speedo
Chains is tucked in, I'm incognito
Fuck with your ego, and touch your girl's labito
There will never be one flyer, LL Cool J
Taking you higher and higher
The wire, the GOAT, the grand sire
Who good are 24's if you on flat tires
Telling your soul and then performing with a choir
People, please, don't listen to these liars
Ladies and gentlemen, these, niggas is selling you up
Bunch of irrelevant shit, it's not intelligent, is it?
My shit's exquisite, don't follow the yellow brick road
Them niggas faking like the Wizard
(Chorus)

Is it really possible I'm this hot?
LL Cool J, still on top?
24 years, I ain't forget the block
You can ask my Jay in the shop
Linden Boulevard, little Coupe, big rocks
Real estate only, I ain't fucking with the stocks
Why not, so our grandkids could feed they grandkids
And they grandkids, can feed they damn kids
And Collin Park throw ya hands in the air
Jump before I turn 'em in a Cool J affair
My word is my bond, every summer I'm there
Ya'll can jump double dutch while I'm laying in the cut
I told ya'll I wasn't giving up
I told ya'll, I can jump on tracks and switch the rhythm up
Do work, treat rap like a ripped skirt
Sow it up, rep your hood, nigga, throw it up
You'd been standing by my side for years
Sold out concerts, screams and cheers
Front row T-Shirt, L, we here
I bought every album, too many to count 'em
Watch your movies, your the only good thing about 'em
Todd Smith jeans, I can't live without 'em
And the only thing I want from you
Is for you to keep doing that shit you do

You Can’t Dance,Radio,1985.0,"He man, I've seen ya, think ya rockin' it on the floor...
You look like a moron! Who let you in the door?
To put the question bluntly: maybe your feet's deformed
They should slap you in the teeth when you put your dancing shoes on
You can't dance!
Why don't you just nail your feet to the floor?
Homeboy, what's the use?
Anytime you wanna step inside a party
First think of an excuse
You dance like a fat old lady
Not sayin' that fat old ladies ain't nice
But every time you try to get one move right
The old lady done did it twice
You can't dance!
You big no dancin', disco disaster
The worst I ever saw
They should drop kick you in the neck
And drag you off the floor
In every discotheque, I see you there
In the middle of the crowd
Looking like you got eight or nine left feet dragging all around
You can't dance!
Take my advice, don't move!
You'll never get the knack
If I danced like you I'd sneak out the party
And wouldn't be coming back
On the floor you're a dinosaur, yeah boy, that's how you move
You look like Ralph Kramden
 
or a Donald Duck cartoon
You can't dance!
You wanna come to my party?
I wouldn't give you a chance
You tried to take breakdance lessons
Ended up in an ambulance
Wouldn't it be funny if they put you on 
Solid Gold
?
You dance like you got arthritis already
What'll happen when you get old?
You can't dance!
Why are you so stiff?
Is it something that your mother did?
Maybe you grew up around ""can't dance"" people
When you were a ""can't dance"" kid
You live in a ""can't dance"" house
Went out in a ""can't dance"" car
Your doofy ""can't dance"" father
Got drunk in a ""can't dance"" bar
You take a ""can't dance"" bath
Put on your ""can't dance"" cologne
Go out to a ""can't dance"" party
So you wouldn't have to ""can't dance"" all alone
You can't dance!
Homeboy, will you please get off the floor, you moron?",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-you-cant-dance-lyrics
No Airplay,Mr. Smith,1995.0,"Y'all wanna put it on tape and do all the real shit?
Ya just wanna go straight to DAT? Aight
You don't wanna mix it or nothin'? Aight let's do it
You want me to do the hook part too?
Check it out uhh, check it out uhh
Yeah it's that Uncle L shit, you know, word up
Ain't no doubt about this, I'm settin' this shit right in here
Yeah yeah yeah, I'm gonna sex this up, yeah go like this here
Check it out

I'm beatin' niggas  the fuck up out their boots
Flame throwin' their troops, they can't recoup from drinkin' acid soup
Spectacular, benacular, miraculous raw shit
Scooped off the concrete to make a hit
Tearin' niggas out the hinges, competition cringes
In the trenches, killin' for mere inches
Word to mama, I tongue kiss a piranha
Electricute a barricuda for tryin to bring the drama
I get more ass than a toilet seat
So put your ballerina shoes on and tiptoe down my meat
Your motherfucking death wish will be soloist
R-double O-K-I-E you ain't stylish
It's motherfucking arson from here to Parsons
You're fuckin' dawson, it's murder, when I step in the door run
For your motherfuckin' life, get ghost
Or taste the toast and get your nuts hung on a goalpost
Startin at'cha neck to check ya for respect
Ya back get snapped, your lower spine gets wet
Hips get ripped and then your thighs start to slide
I'm up through your asshole and fuckin' up your inside

And don't be gettin' no airplay
A jam that'cha love, a jam that'cha love
It's a jam that'cha love that don't be gettin' no airplay
A jam that'cha love, a jam that'cha love

Yeah, the rugged ass style I possess
They got the niggas goin' from Bel Air to baggin' up sess
Shit, motherfuckin' right niggas in his corn
You shoulda never put me on this mic, you was warned
I got niggas chasin' behind my path for garbage bags
Hopin' and prayin' I throw an old rhyme to one of the fags
Huh, I'm on my motherfuckin' game like that
I put it in your chest and make your heart go flat
All the motherfuckin' tracks in the world can't save ya
When I drop these chains on ya brain and enslave ya
Once you was on a pedestal now ya gettin' ridiculed
Shit is critical, we're fightin' at the pinnacle
I'm burnin' niggas like a cracker do a cross
Ain't no three-in-a-row tic tac toe, this is a real flow boss
Makin' niggas understand my language
Then they rap and vanish and camouflage the damage

To whom it may concern, youknowhutI'msayin?
We're gonna do this right here, word is bond, huh huh
'Cause it's a jam that you love that don't be gettin' no airplay
(A jam that'cha love that don't be gettin' no airplay)
I wanna do that one right yo

To whom it may concern on this motherfuckin' test
I got the zest to clip ya through ya vest
Little shorties with big 40's talkin' loud, actin' proud
BLAOW! Now ya chokin' off a black cloud
Rollin El's 'til your brain swells
Inhale deep sleep and dust me off them old ass Rock The Bells
You motherfuckin', you fruitcakes, you fakin' jacks
You niggas don't want it, I'm burnin' up the wax
I'm a trailblazin', gun totin', renegade
Black ass New York niggas choppin' like a blade
Bullshinanigans, country ass mannequins
Motherfuckin' frontin' and I bet you ain't no slam again
Yeah what? I said it and niggas sweat it
What? You catch a heat-seekin missile in ya gut

Ha ha, word is bond yo

You’ll Rock,Radio,1985.0,"The momentum of this party can only increase
The design of this rhyme is a masterpiece
You'll wanna kick steps to the musical feast
And witness the force I'm about to release
You'll rock!!

I'm a professional producer of hip-hop songs
In case you're unaware my beats are always strong
I'll exterminate your crew if I don't like you
With one rhyme I subdue my adversaries are through
I'm the best, fascinatin' my names' Cool J
I'm the royalty of rap, what else can I say
Experience, rhymin' skill, plus my voice is on wax
Funky fresh party rocker, so let's face facts
I'll dust a rapper off if I require practice
Vocal cords so rough that I can eat cactus
Choreographer of rhymes, best of all times
Composition technican with a b-boy's mind
Terrorizin MCs, destructions' in my path
Make your girlfriend ask me for my autograph
I'm the mic dominater, best of all times
And you ain't heard nothin' till you heard J rhyme
You'll rock!!

Now I'm a tell you the name behind the scratchin' sound
He's Cut Creator, Philly-Phil, he has the DJ crown
Me and him are imitatin' but never underated
My rhymes and his cuts have been consolidated
My mission ain't complete without the use of his hands
He makes my rhymes sound fresher, my beat expand
So I'd like you to meet him, but don't attempt to beat him
A five man crew, me and him'll defeat 'em
He'll scratch...and wipe out all foes
Turntable terrorizer and I think you should know
That we're - high calibered and my names' J
And for all you sucker crews it's Judgment Day
During this encounter, I'm your rhyme sayer
I hate to say it girls, but yes, I'm a player
Material royal, dominating all
Light-brown with dimples and I'm six feet tall
And promoter of recordings that I call my own
And I'll love to take one of you ladies home
I'll complete and clear, infiltratin' your ears
My litera-ture is above Shakespeare
MC assassinator, and I just won't stop
I'm the author and the designer of the jam you'll rock
I'm a lyrical flame on the heels of fame
And the world will be glad that Cool J came
You'll rock!!

Now I'm a dedicate this rhyme to my favorite street
You think about it every time that you hear this beat
Any other jam you hear just dis-regard
This is the National Anthem of the Boulevard
See I'm loyal to the Boule cause it taught me the deal
Certainly the place to be and that's how I feel
Farmers Boulevard, E-Love and me Cool J
In the center of it all is the Q-3-A
42nd will surrender, Delancey's in fear
Queens Boulevard is soft, they don't come around here
With gazelles on my face, I will hold my space
Entertain, stimulate, and conduct the bass
You'll rock!!

Now I'ma kick it for the beat, check complete my mission
Subtractin' emcee's like a mathematician
Chairman of the board at the rappin' commission
Soul inventor of this composition
I disintegrate rappers I can and I could
The great Edgar Allen Poe couldn't write this good
I'm the warlord of rap with my own army
Japans' whole military couldn't disarm me
Super bad, cold crush, number one b-boy
Like a paintin' from Picasso, I'm the real McCoy
Crown Prince of rappin', godfather of beats
MC's that I meet, I mutilate and defeat
You'll rock!!

YouknowI'msayin'? Break!!
YouknowI'msayin'? Break!! Break!! Break two!!",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-youll-rock-lyrics
I Can Give You More,Radio,1985.0,"I seen this girl, walkin' down the block
I said, ""WAIT!""
""Yo baby, you wanna come to my crib?""
""Have some donuts and milk?""
""Listen to a pop tune maybe?""

Please be his ex and be my bride
Don't blame it on yourself, sweet thing, you tried
Love you claimed to share, just wasn't there
You're too good for that, and it wasn't fair
Love's taken its toll, your heart he stole
You was fooled by the face of a phoney role
But I'll take up the slack, support you, baby
Now the knight in shiny armor can only be me
I cry out your name as you hold his hand
If you're not mine soon, girl, my soul is damned
I'm lookin' out the window at the stormy rain
And the rush of the water makes my eyes drain
All alone in the room, and it's makin' me sad
Fantasize of the love we could have had
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more

I pour wine for two, even though it's just me
I tried to reach you, but blind men don't see
Your man, is the devil, but he gave you a ring
So you believe you saw an innocent angel sing
You're the type that ignores the destiny of two
It's not Romeo and Juliet, it's me and you
You're bein' handicapped by a Don Juan rap
You can hope I disappear, girl, but I'll be back
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more
Yes girl, I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more

The time has come, the decision's yours
This super love story ain't workin' no more
Can't you understand, that my love spans
Higher and further than any man's
You're lookin' a gift horse right in the mouth
This time hear me out, I don't care if you pout
You're my only desire, I fight to the death
And I'ma scream your name when I breathe my last breath
Ain't gettin' on my knees, but I'm oh so close
To our love I toast, all he does is boast
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more

A knock on the door and a tap on the glass
Tells me you see it my way at last
You used to reject me, now you wanna kiss me
He called you up and said, ""Yo baby, why you diss me?""
Meanwhile made romance on the sea shore
You want more of what you used to ignore
During this love affair, girl, it gets steamy
Three nights in a row, and you still wanna see me
Make love at night, coffee in the morn'
I be the only blanket that's keepin' you warm
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more

I hoot in the morning to the crack of sunlight
But my agony continues till it reaches night
Sweet image of your face appears on the wall
And the scene is so eerie I run through the hall
I look at the sky, then I search for the moon
Realize it's 3 o'clock in the afternoon
So I dress to impress, exit the house
Go up to the school and watch the kids come out
In the middle of the court yard there you stand
With the man who's deceiving ya, holding your hand
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more

You're the goddess of light, the queen of seduction
You won't get used if you follow my instructions
Just grab my hand, feel the sweat on my palm
Make love to a man and not a cheap Don Juan
And that'll be eroticism, highs die down
You will find your best friend finally is found
I caress ya at night, like a virgin in white
'Cause the new world I found is oh so tight
And tender and young, soft and wet
It's hotter than any fantasy could get
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-i-can-give-you-more-lyrics

When I heard of a jux that'll ease the pain
I'm the shittiest nigga, I cut the prettiest nigga
From his ear to his chin, I don't care if you his friends
Yeah, I did it back then, and I'll do it again

Queens home of the gulliest goons fuzzy the goon
With fifty calibre gun smoke, mac 1 and 1 toast
Back when I slung dope, sling a batch
Stainless gat packed it back to the D.O.C. and the Run crew
Played the P.E. logo, put in front of the gun scope

Dangerous,Radio,1985.0,"His realm is a new horizon of cuts
They expand from his hand as he conducts
A melodical project, not photography
Cut-Creator, Philly-Phil's biography
The lyrical virtuoso makes his return
All adversaries should be concerned
LL Cool J is back again
Allow me to introduce you to my friend, Cut Creator
He circumcises DJ's while he's on the airwaves
Till the missions' complete, you're a musical slave
In his division, he'll endure any collision
Like a surgeon with a scalpel, he'll make an incision
As for me I'll annihilate, exile, 
ex-communicate
You from rappin'
 and my lyrics are the best
Slow down the rap but not the subject matter
All you sucker DJ's will scatter
Cut-Crea-tor will employ techniques that will absorb toy boy
Choreographer of cuts, Cut Creator is his name
The boy's so nice, my vocals will strain
You could re-arrange but you don't have the brains
To arrange scratch patterns full of audio change
Not trigonometry, or fundamental geometry
Just Cool J, that's me, I'm dangerous
(*""I Need A Beat"" - cut and scratched*)
Yeah I made it, don't look astonished
I had to remind you of what I accomplished
My scenario for your stereo
Us being beat, zero is the ratio
Cut Creator, LL Cool J
Say ""Olé"" to what we display
Battles, we don't evade, instead we invade
And all competitors will be slayed
Any comment is a compliment
No group's talent could be the equivalent
Of mine and his combined
Total harmony between the cuts and the rhyme
Turmoil is erased by the depth of the bass
Takin' out every sucker DJ in the place
A performance underrated, is now narrated
So Cut Creator's social status can be elevated
He's dangerous
Demolishin' DJ's in under a second
I'll quote an old phrase from my last record
The beat elevates, the scratch excels
Except I came here to raise some hell
Servin up slices and cuts like a blade
He could squeeze a dry sponge and make Kool-Aid
Acute and steady, the record turns steady
Instead of a needle, he uses a machete
His cuts evolve to get you involved
As the record revolves, DJ's dissolve
Musically, physically, mentally, he's an innovator, greater
Cut Creator is on the crossfader
So try to digest what I invent
On Farmer's Boulevard is where I rest
I'm numero uno, amigo with an ego
Je pan de la francais, and Italiano
From my projects and I'll inject
Into your ears, a new concept
Conceived in silence, to be unveiled
To the Cool J phenomena, all must hail
I'm dangerous",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-dangerous-lyrics
Candy,Phenomenon,1998.0,"When you was seventeen and I was nineteen
We feel deep in love growing up in Queens
We didn't know a thing about love
We was innocent sneakin' on the doorstep to hug
Held you tightly and promised you the world
You gave me hickys and said you was my girl
When I think about it now makes me smile
Cause I ain't felt these butterflies in a while
Funny how you grow up and innocence fades
We used to live for love but now we're afraid (of what?)
Of the darkness and bitter memories
Lovers who crushed us through infidelity
I promised you I'd love you to the end
Always and forever since way back when
You're like candy the world's sweetest friend
You taste better now than you did back then

You will always be my candy
One day we will start a family
You will always be my candy girl
(you'll be my candy girl forever)
You will always be my candy
Want your love girl understand me
You will always be my candy girl

While you sucked caramel apple lolly pops
Rain sleet or snow I'm troopin' up the murdock
We used to walk down the block hold hands
I would get you after school cause I was your man
And any guys that wanna socalize
Just know that I'm a flip on any cat that trys
My peeps used to say I was whipped
All your girls said since you got with him you flipped
But uh they couldn't feel the feelings we felt
Mirrors on the ceiling we melt
I would look up at ya I remember
The afternoon you surrendered
We made love the tempature was high as could be
You said Todd promise you ain't liein' to me
And as we went our seperate ways you turned back
Smiled I remember all that

You will always be my candy
One day we will start a family
You will always be my candy girl
(you'll be my candy girl forever)
You will always be my candy
Want your love girl understand me
You will always be my candy girl

Candy girl
You are my world
Look so sweet
You're a special treat
Candy girl
All I want to say
I need your love
Each and every day

When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my memories call
Of days when love was true I slept and held you
Taste the brown sugar let your climax melt yo
Candy you're occupying all of my thoughts
Turned my soul upside down with lessons you taught
I can feel you even when you're far away you're right here wit' me
Sweet love strictly
And I'm a bend over backwards to keep you on my side
Take you for a mental and emotional ride
Make love to your soul your heart and your mind
In your hour of need girl I'll be there every time
And as long as you support my dreams
Stayin' right beside me as a part of my team
I'll take you where the average man can only dream of
Cause in a world so sour I got the sweetest love

You will always be my candy
One day we will start a family
You will always be my candy girl
(you'll be my candy girl forever)
You will always be my candy
Want your love girl understand me
You will always be my candy girl

Candy girl
You are my world
Look so sweet
You're a special treat
(you'll be my candy girl forever)
Candy girl
All I want to say
(word is bond sweetheart)
I need your love
(I swear I'm down for whatever)
Candy girl
(sometimes you gotta go back home)
Look so sweet
(I love you)

James Todd Smith when nine years old
When 'Sugarhill' was in control
I'm listenin' to cold-crushed tapes to get sold
I set my demo in a Silvia treated me cold
Time flew cause I was gettin' my shit off
Sixteen now, it's about the time to set my first hit off
'I Need A Beat', it was a smash on the DL
But every time I did a show my name was misspelled
'Can't Live Without My Radio' drops
I'm kickin' down the door-crushed cool box
'Rockin' the bells' like a madman dissin' me
Event-flippin' the script-but then I made my first 50 grand
All I wanted was a pencil, a little gold
A little money in my pocket and a Phillie to roll
I'm makin' records, now alla the girls are on my tip
I'm sleepin' late, no money damn, I'm late for school, shit
Todd, get upstairs and take out that garbage
And it's the funkadelic relic, yeah

And it's the funkadelic relic, yeah
(Bring in the funk baby, bring in the funk)
It's the funkadelic relic, yeah
(Bring in the funk baby, bring it in, bring it)
I wasn't tryin' to hear it cause I'm bad
When I'm alone in my room, I pick up a pen and start to get mad
I need love, that means I need a girl to love me down
I dropped the pretty style cause rap was gettin' ugly
I waited a year for the results, I'm triple platinum
We know the presidents are flowin' by who's sackin' 'em
I'm that type of guy when poppa wasn't happy with it
Tripplin' 'em up, that was my style, but everybody bit it
Yo Marley, hit the remix, make it fresh with flavor
Another power move, I'll switch my hat, the shit is major
Puttin' out till da break of dawn', tell me what sucker?
Cops harass me illegal search motherfucker
I'm just a brother makin' jams now I got a name
I still remember chillin' with my pistol on the train
I'm sayin' two to this I'm representin' hip hop
Admit that I'm the man, it's time for me to get my props
Yeah, and it's the funkadelic relic

Come on man
Mama said to knock 'em out' I knocked 'em out the box
I got a rhyme to wake, you're sloppin' up and down the blocks
There never was a time when I was down to meetin' by myself
When all the punks on top of everybody else, but
In '92 and '93 I'm makin' history
The largest motherfuckin' street, that ain't no mystery
The baddest rapper ever born, you think I'm crazy?
I heard your albums' kinda warm, that shit don't phase me
I'm too rough, too rugged, now that doesn't sound so easy does it
Thought I was going back to Cali' where I knew I wasn't
I sent a 'Murder Gram', solo in a black van
I'm claimin' knuckle game, stomp you with my Timberland
'Mr. Goodbar' lickin' all the rough stuff
I'm kickin' down your door with condoms in a rudder-put
You wanna find me come to Farmers Boulevard
And you can hear me, eat 'em up, just ask for Todd

And even if I'm twice as expensive as the rest
When I go for dolo, you ain't checkin' for nothin' less
My strategy is splittin' brain cavity's
It's ya majesty bringin' you a tragedy
Yeah, on the butcher block slice her like a ox
When it's time to get down, nigga I jam like a Glock
I bust through all types of red tape and sue papes
Niggas come old but they always wanna infiltrate
I'm cuttin' snakes through the belly witta icepick
And scoopin' hotties, a strong aisle of flip trips
It's the rebirth of murkin' niggas once again
I drain with ink and put your blood in my pen
I'm breakin' ribs 'til somethin' gives

Bring your heroes down to ground zero
Shotty grippin' ya grill like Pesci and DeNiro

Scoopedin' New Jacks and kick 'em in the fire pit
Tell them ole Jap niggas they need to go and stick it
Cos when it comes to this rap shit I'm mad wicked
The grand sire bringin' flavor to the whole game
Mr Smith is my motherfuckin' name

I'm about to blow the spot up with that divine touch
I got the magnetic energetic lyrical calasthetic
Ya better call a medic cos ya look pathetic
Guan boy it's the champion Mr Smith
Your niggas couldn't raise up with a forklift
Cocked the hammer, peep out the grammar
It's hard like Bacardi and hot like a house party
All your so-called flavor niggas is deaded
Your next step is where ya headed so don't forget it
Your rhymes is beat, your steelo's scarred to scrape
When you scream you sound muddy like a bled teeth
I get'cha open like f-lay, 'tack you when I spray
Lethal compositions around your way
I'm the maniacal murderous Mr James Smith
Rippin' ya ass out the frame with my verbal gift

Boom bash, wake up, I set it off right
Look around and turn your wet dream to fright night
You can call me R&B, that's only if it stands for Rough Brother
Word to my grandmother
I buck you in the head just to let ya know
Stick you for ya dough, spit on the flo'
Drag it out of ya, bring it on
I smack him back down, yo dope word is bond
I know you want a piece of the champ
But you roll too weak, you couldn't make it in my camp
You thought I went for the flip
But I'm bustin' off hip-hop clip after clip
I kept you out there, ripped you for your wear
Jump inside your video, bust you with a chair
Smack slap smack slap smack slap smack
Just to make it worse and hurt your pride I'll run it back
Smack slap smack slap smack slap smack
Click click boom, stop dead in your tracks
Stick the steel in your mouth
Buck buck buck buck buck, lights out

The album that I'm comin' with is rough, the flavor's mean
(ooooh) kickin' you for real in the guillotine
Fourteen shots to your dome kid
I'm doin' time in the game like a bid
Movin' rhymes like a package
So stigetty step up and get your nostrils damaged
Shootin', lickin', bustin', sprayin', all of that
And then some, dead dead dead, one by one
Never step to a real man
Cause your rhymes only work on a playground program
They impress your little friends, bring you a little ends
But you still you gotta ride in your man's Benz
Word to hip-hop, I'm a blast ya
Gotta set you on fire cause I gassed ya
Boom, blow, Batman, bang, pow
Unh (what) unh (what), that's the way it's goin' down
My new album ain't no joke
You wanna take me out, how many bunch ya smoke?
I'll never slack again, I'm off the job like the mob
Hey, no prob', many solved, on the knob, make his heartthrob
What you gotta deal with is real, made of steel
You can feel it comin', burnin', buildin', flowin' like an eel
Movin', killin', breakin', servin' you just like a meal
Take off your clothes and taste the steel

Rockabye baby on the rooftop
Open up your mouth and taste my Glock
When your jaw breaks your gold teeth will fall
Down will come the monkey, banana clip and all
Splat (buck buck buck) it's all over wit'
Another plan O.D.'ed over my war hit
The way I'm workin' and jerkin' and hurtin' brothers converted
Non-believers get murdered, that’s how I preferred it
Get your face out the bill, catch the thrill
Carry a nine put your hoochies on the bill
The thought of you gettin' scarred turns me on
Like my first television with my backup tip hard
So where's your mouth kid? Where's your heart shorty?
It's all over, cash your chips in, crack a forty
You look thirsty, you ain't gettin' no mercy mercy
And ain't no way that you can rehearse for me
Murder I wrote, murder I wrote, is what I figure
It's in my tote, it's in my tote, so I pull the trigger
Put up your women, your crib, your speakers
Your dog, your cat, your crate, your speakers
Your sister, your aunt, your crew, your Knicks
Got 'em booin' all you other rappers who think that's too tough
Bam bam, here's a hit you wish you had
A hit that makes you mad, a hit that makes you slap your dad
Dead dead dead, kill dead, kill dead
Try to battle me I gots to buck you in your head
I pull your file, click
I know you're good to style, blaow
Livin' wild, when it comes to this I never smile
What did you learn from the lesson I just gave ya?
Obey your mama, be on your best behavior
It's never endin' and I am recommendin'
You put your name as Brendan

I Want You,Radio,1985.0,"(Intro: LL Cool J)
Look girl, I'm not gonna sing
Cause I just don't do that
(LL Cool J)
I see you in between class and my mind skips a task
One glimpse of your eyes and my heart beats fast
A mysterious fantasy, lovely young queen
You’re pose so subtle, just like a magazine
Come and visit my sister, sit in the livin' room
Eat doughnuts and milk, listen to a pop tune
Used to be my babysitter, I want you for my woman
Without you girl, my life is bitter like a lemon
I want you
(LL Cool J)
I day dream love scenes, girl, when you pass by
I wonder what the future holds for you and I
I tell my friends fairy tales about me and you
My total devotion for you is true
See you on the bus, I trip as I get on
My body gets warm but my mind is torn
I admit you’re the queen of elegance
Maybe I’m just another puppy love nuisance
I will tell you straight up, not cologne on a letter
Opportunity knocks, I feel I just better
Disappear outta sight, rejection is my fright
To me you’re like a drug, boy, a hazy red light
I want you
(LL Cool J)
Too weak, I can’t speak, I’m messin' up in school
Just to hear your name girl, it makes me drool
As you sing falsetto on the college choir
My temperature level grows much higher
Spend the night over my house with my sister and friends
I wish you wouldn’t treat my like I’m your cousin
Your high school yearbook under my pillow
You walk by my window, I see your silhouette
Candle light is want I desire
But all I get to do is fix your flat tire
When you ring my bell purfume I smell
The aroma pierces through my heart’s shell
I tell you that my sister isn’t here today
You go away, but I wish you’d stay
Yes, girl, I’m twisted around your finger
When you leave your purfume lingers
I want you
(LL Cool J)
The clock tick-tocks as I lay in my bed
It’s visions of you circlin' through my head
I sip lemon ice tea, read a magazine
Wish we were involved in a steamy love scene
Saturday night, it’s time to party y'all
But an unseen force has my back on the wall
All eyes hit the door, red dress shines loud
The moment has come, my fantasy’s here now
You sip Gin and Tonic with the double hole straw
Finally I get the nerve to buy you one more
The bartender smirks, I whisper “He’s a jerk”
I’m wearin' leather pants and a thirty dollar shirt
Offer you some Double-Mints, sit back, crack a smile
Try to act like I’m relaxed and not a child
You see I’m sixteen and you’re in college
Lovely sweet thing please give me the knowledge
I want you
(LL Cool J)
It’s easy to detect a line that’s preset
What you don’t know is you’re the woman I’ve wanted to get
For years and now I’m here sweet dear
Cool as the snow under a polar bear
I light your cigarette with the Raphael lighter
Your dress seems like its gettin' tighter and tighter
The ice cubes melt, the heat is felt
The card’s on the table and my deal is dealt
I want you
(LL Cool J)
I had to search through  my soul, cowardice kept a hold on me
As the key was analysin' my role
As a man to instigate romance
Not break down and cry when you ask for a dance
Some fellas talk to her and she walks by
She can only say no its not do or die like Bed-Stuy
It’s Nature’s way
A sweet love story from LL Cool J

Release the bass in your face like a large Vega speaker
Li-li-lis-listen to my rhyme
Here to satisfy the listeners who stood on line
Bought tickets to see me kick it and wasn't late
The love every little bit of the cuts he creates
First not last, leader of the class, see
From London, Long Beach, and down to Tallahassee
Ladies are pleased, I'm not wearin Lee's

Make it hot... then we drop it
(oooooooh!) Uh, yeah
(oooooooh!) Uptown, you know how we do it
Yeah you know
Make it hot
LL Cool J: It's our first time together and I'm feeling kinda horny
Conventional methods of making love kinda bore me
I wanna knock your block off, get my rocks off
Blow your socks off make sure your G spots soft
LeShaun: I'm gonna call you big daddy and scream your name
Matter fact I can't wait for your candy rain
J: So watcha sayin', I get my swerve on, bring it live
Make it last forever, damn the kitty cat's tight
L: Mmm... Daddy slow down your flow
Put it on me like a G baby nice and slow
I need a rough neck nigga mandingo in a sec
Who ain't afraid to pull my hair and spank me from the back
J: No doubt, I'm the player that you're talkin' about
L: Mmm...But do you really think that you can work it out?
J: I guarantee you shorty it's real, baby stick it out
Here comes the man of steel
Chorus X2:
L: Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
J: I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn
I'm in the mix now, searching for the right spot
To hit now, get down
L: Damn my lover dig down
You use a rubber?
J: Damn right
L: You are my lover?
J: All night
L: The putty good to you? Word to motha?
J: Man tight
The only thing left to do is climax
Let's make it last
L: Word we ain't goin' out like that
All this time you've been telling me that you was a Don
J: I tried to warn you girl you wouldn't listen
Now let's get it on
L: Mmm make me wild.. don't do that
Chill wait a minute baby let me please you back
J: You talk good one shorty love you're makin' me sweat
How a live nigga like it girl?
L: Nice and wet
We get it on to the break of dawn, damn your large
How a big girl like it daddy?
J: Nice and hard
Safe sexin' it, flexin' it, gettin' mad affectionate
Chewin' it, doin' it, all while we're doin' it
Chorus X2
J: Baby, I wanna hit it in the worst way
L: Make it hot
J: Scheming on the ass since the first day
L: Don't stop
Damn I love it when you talk like that
Make it bounce sugar
J: Long as you can bounce me back
More flesh than the greek fest
L: Roll up the sess
J: Pass the Hennessee
L: Put my body to the test
Way way back many niggas ago
I was a young girl listening to how you flow
Now's my chance to hit you off daddy I'm grown
From the back, from the side
J: Right, I'm in the zone
One of a kind when it's time to do mine
Camcorder and the whole shit
L: Press rewind
Let it flow on the screen while we puffs the L
Layin' back in the cut while we're under the spell
J: Word life, I like the way the ep went down
Go to sleep, tomorrow I'll take you back downtown
We'll be

Yo.. ""Hello 1-900-LL Cool J?""
Yeah whassup? ""Can you please bust a funky rhyme for me?""
Yeah I can do that, check this one out honey
I motivate, accelerate
Devastate, and dominate
I don't smoke crack so I won't lose weight
Give me the {pussy} and the money and the mic and I'm straight
Go to a restaurant, give me steak
Then cook my chicken with Shake'n'Bake
I leave all the preachin to Reverand Flake
How much money can one black man make? Huh
I'm what's known as a true dynamiter
I write rhymes fast without a typewriter
Go with the flow, but no, I'm not a biter
Can't compare a cock-a-roach and a spider
Hell, you might as well get a glass of punch
Cause you're bitin my lyrics like a Nestle Crunch, huh
And bitin my rhymes ain't slick
I got your gold teeth marks all over my dick
Complications and aggravation
An unnecessary-sation
I'm like Sunkist, good vibrations
Your al-blum, sounds like a compilation
Cool out, grab a seat and listen..
Cause I'mma start dismissin
Sucker MC's who's out there frontin
Talkin all that yang, yo you smokin somethin
Shoulda treated me royal, yo he wasn't loyal
Now it's all about chaos and turmoil
Gimme that microphone
I'mma show you the real meaning of the danger zone
{*phone rings*}
Yo.. ""Hello is this 1-900-LL Cool J?""
Yeah whassup? ""Can you tell me what you do when you're coolin out?""
Yo check this out
Now when I'm coolin out, no time for a granny
Just a fly girl in t-shirt and panties
""Can LL screw?"" Man, can he!
I tell you what, give up the fanny
Cause on a bedroom tune, J's swift
Not too big, but nothin to play with
In addition, you on a mission
You need to audition for another position
Doin damage is a crew tradition
Name your next al-blum intermission
You're full of preservatives -- plus
You're too conservative
I'm full of flair, savoir faire, debonairre
There's no competition for this here
So don't waste your time and breath
I'm givin you all a big F
MC's I envelop
As the song goes on, the rhyme develops
I'm asiatic, acrobatic, charismatic
You don't want no static
Anyway, I ain't havin it
When I see the microphone -- I'm grabbin it
Plug it in and take charge
LL XL, Xtra-Large
KnowhatI'msayin? Peace

Hello?
Hello whassup girl?
How you doin girl? I been tryin to call you all day

Two Different Worlds,Walking with a Panther,1989.0,"(Intro: LL Cool J & Cydne Monet)
You know I don't understand why you treat me like this
It's almost like you feel like you're from two different worlds
(Well, we are Todd) I don't think so
You should have a listen to me right now
(LL Cool J)
I can feel it now baby I can feel it now, I can feel that
Even though you're a queen and I'm only a prince
I felt the magical between us ever since
The first time that I laid eyes on you
I want you to be my girl, so I can hold you
Caress you and let you know that I love you
And day by day my love grows
Heres' where I stand, I gotta be your man
I don't care if we're from two different worlds
But we're from...
(Cydne Monet)
Two different, two different, we're from two different worlds
Two different, two different worlds...
I don't understand the way you feel
But it's just a dream and it could never be real
So face to face I can't love you
We're from two, different worlds
Two different, two different, we're from two different worlds
Two different, two different worlds...
(LL Cool J)
Many things are different, birds and bees
Flowers and trees, you and me
But it really doesn't matter, it makes us stronger
There's more to talk about, we'll be together longer
Trustin' me, have faith in my love
It goes so deep, girl you're so sweet
As a matter of fact, I want you for my wife
Please be a part of my life
(Cydne Monet)
I can't believe you won't give up
Your love is strong but boy, so what (so what)
You can't love me, I can't love you
We're from two, different worlds... (it doesn't matter)
Two different, (two different) two different
We're from two different worlds (I don't care)
Two different (so what), two different worlds...
(LL Cool J & Cydne Monet)
It could never make a difference in my heart
(It could never make a difference)
Never could keep us apart (Whoooo... yeah)
Hold on (hold on) who cares what the world is sayin'?
(I do) My love goes so deep, (mmmm, baby), hold on
I know baby, let's take it to the climax
Two different, (two different) two different (so different)
We're from two different worlds (I don't care)
Two different (so what), two different worlds...
(LL Cool J)
So what's it gonna be, you wanna be with me?
I wanna be wit'chu, my love is true
All you gotta do is get into love
It's like a blessin' in disguise, sent from up above
This is your last chance, real not fate
Give me a break, don't make a mistake
Cause I'm for real, I want you for my girl
I don't care if we're from different worlds, but we're from
(Cydne Mone & LL Cool J)
Two different, (two different) two different (so different)
We're from two different worlds (uh, I don't care)
Two different, two different worlds... (who cares baby
You gotta understand, you gotta understand, just take my hand, come on baby)
Two different (have a heart honey), two different worlds... (I want you, I need you)
We're from two different worlds (take my hand honey)
Two different, (don't fool with the mood baby) two, different worlds (take me by hand)
You don't seem to understand (I understand baby, we're two, we can work it out)
(We can find a way), we're from, (self will change baby...)
We're from two different worlds
(We're the perfect match, I love you), two different
(trust me, have faith in your heart, baby) worlds
I'll treat you right baby, I'll treat you right baby, I'll promise you)
Two different (you never meant as much to me till tonight), two different
(I'll always love you), we're from two different worlds (I'll never forget you)
Two, two, two, different (trust me, hold my hand, have faith in me baby
Understand me sweet-heart, I love you...)",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-two-different-worlds-lyrics
Down the Aisle,Todd Smith,2006.0,"Yeah, uh-huh
I can't believe it

Finally I'm walking down that aisle
No need for the coping now
I found the perfect partner waiting for me at the altar
Made a vow before God to love me
And finally I'm walking down that aisle
I will never second guess us how
When we're laughing together, and we're crying together
Having kids together, my life begins right now

Finally the day has arrived
I'm standing at the altar, you're walking down the aisle
My heart skips a beat, emotions run wild
Half of me is crying, the other half smiles
I can feel my stomach turnin and tossin and goin through it
I just can't believe it, I'm really 'bout to do it
Take the vow to be together forever
Plus promise I'ma be there, whenever, wherever
Through the ups and downs, through the darkest clouds
Side by side in the rain 'til the sun comes out
I was blind to love, God showed me you
Now I'm standin here shakin 'bout to say ""I do""
And I do


Butterflies, my palms are sweaty
It's a lifetime commitment, I pray that I'm ready
But your eyes tell me not to worry, you're sincere
Can't turn back now, destiny's why I'm here
Our friends laugh as I take you by the hand
But they single and this a feeling that they don't understand
You're my partner for life, I'ma treat you right
Our honeymoon's forever, not just tonight
Knew the time was right, to be husband and wife
Us both dressed alike in the purest white
Such a beautiful gown, friends and family around
Ignore the cold feet now, time to take these vows


It's a beautiful and heavenly day
As the pastor asks, ""Who gives this woman away?""
Your father says ""I do"" and gives me a hand
Plus the tough guy, and I completely understand
He losin a diamond and now you're mine and
He don't have to worry, I'ma keep you shinin
I'ma build us a future, I'ma keep on climbin
With our family on my back, cause that's my assignment
I'ma work overtime, make sure y'all live
But still find time for you and homework with the kids
Took a long time to learn, I was so hardheaded
But you stuck with me and you won't regret it, ""I do""

 + (LL)
And I do (I do)
Baby I do (I do)
Baby I doooooooooooooooooooo
We made a vow baby
I do (I do)
Baby I do (I do)
Baby I doooooooooooooooooooo
Find that perfect partner, yeah yeah (I do)
Waiting for me at the altar
And I make a vow before God to love you
Finally I'm walking down that aisle
I'll, never second guess you {*fading out*}",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-down-the-aisle-lyrics
Ratchet,UnKnown,UnKnown,"She’s so ratchet, she’s so ratchet
But she’s so bad we could throw cash at it
First I’m gonna smash it, then I’m gonna leave it
You ain’t gonna do me like you did him either
I’mma get mine (Can I have some cash?)
It’s time to get rid of yo ratchet ass
I’mma get mine (Can I have a little money for gas?)
I should’ve never been with your ratchet ass

She gave up the dreams, lady coming with the games
Standing in the mirror, trying on my chains
Smiling, baby you want some champagne?
You need a towel, you going out the train
If so, can I drop the Range?
Pick up Melissa, Jennifer and Lorraine?
Hah man, here we go
The last dude you was with must’ve been slow
Ever since your girlfriend made the intro
Tinted, you’re all packed up in the rental
You gave me a look that made it real simple
We could get it in, you know, video
But I ain’t ray jay you ain't kim k
Cancel the cameras, we could fuck all day
Make a pit stop, hit it in the hallway
Apartment upstairs is bumping Cool J
Tell me this later, holding my hand
Got your head up on my chest like I’m really your man
I’m thinkin’ to myself, is this part of the plan?
Where you going with this? Don’t understand


Hunger Games begun
Sitting on the side of my bed, count my ones
Talking about you and me would make a cool son
Convincing me, you ain’t really seeing no one
I love spending time with you, it’s so fun
But thinkin’ to myself ""bitch please, I’m done""
Your shit’s unreal
I guess I should blame it on them damn high heels
The way your skin look when your silk gloss peel
That damn D'Angelo and his how does it feel
You went from jump off to G4 jets
Poor type of baller saying I got necks
I should’ve ignored you when you sent that text
No, I couldn’t afford you when we first had sex
Had to do it anyway
And I would do this shit all over any day
Cause you a nasty thing
Drive me up the walls with the skills you bring
But I hope you’re okay with a little Burger King
Cause the bills be whoppers when you fine dining


My pockets feel light
Woke up this morning and something wasn’t right
The numbers are all off
You got your hair done and it looks all soft
Can't find my not no place
You giving me the innocent poker face
I feel weird when we embrace
You treat my house like it’s our place
And you go hard in the bed
Am I doing that much or do you need meds?
I mean I believe what you said
But you was screaming as you was giving me head
Aggressive shoppin' and credit card droppin'
Relax baby, ain’t none of that poppin'
Once that starts ain’t no stopping
Cause my meat got real good cotton",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-ratchet-lyrics
Luv You Better,Now That’s What I Call Music! 12 [US],UnKnown,"This is for my number one
This is for my number one
This is for my number one
True baby for I adore
This is hard to say
I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
'cause lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don't feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you're hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, ""You make me sick""
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart's hair-broken and that's hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
'cause I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else
It's a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up
I can't let us self-destruct
Baby smile today
'cause I been imaginin' more ways
I'm gon' love you better
When your friends'll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I'm gon' love you better
When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin' all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL's, baguettes and rings
Instead I walk around like I'm a king
And having you ain't nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin' you the lovin' was good
Too busy frontin' in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don't ever let go
I'ma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
One more chance baby and don't say no
'cause I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow
Well it's time for the pain to go, you know
Baby smile today
'cause I been imaginin' more ways
I'm gon' love you better
When your friends'll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I'm gon' love you better
Do you think I meant to hurt you?

Do you think I meant to hurt you?

It's a brand new me, a brand new you
A brand new day, sky so blue
Hold my hand while I walk with you
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you
No more games callin' you foul names
Actin' like females is all the same
I'm gon' love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward I'll never be the same
I'm a rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you, lemme show you what I mean
Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
A toast to the queen, you're back in my life
But this time I'm a do it right
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart
Nothin' is gonna tear us apart, promise
Baby smile today

Miscellaneous
Dear Mallika
Feat. LL Cool J, Kathy Megestro & Heike Thurjung
Dear Mallika
I've been missing you in my soul
Haven't seen you in what seems like centuries
I'm so cold
And although I know you're safe in paradise
Still I can't help but worry
For your safety I pay any price
I'm sorry I didn't recognize your fathers struggle
But its hard to be understanding with the amounts of task I juggle
When I think of paradise
And the natural spring flowing
I get jealous of your father
Fearing your love for him might be growing
**Dôme épais, le jasmin a la rose s´assemble
Rive en fleurs, frais matin, nous appellent ensemble
Sous le dôme épais, oû le blanc jasmin a la rose s´assemble
Sur la rive en fleurs, riant au matin
Viens, descendous ensemble**
Dear Mallika
When I held you in my arms
Your skin was like a rose slightly caressed by the sun
I chose you before anyone
Walked through the garden barefoot
Tasting mangoes in the forest
My feelings can't be captured by an artist
It was beautiful in every heavenly way imagined
You're my hero
For you Id slay any dragon
Dig tunnels to the depths of my own weakness
I miss all your grandeur your splendor your sweetness
Your eloquence fine raiment's sensitivity
In a land of thousand paradises
You're the epitome
And I'm missing you
For love intensifies from yearmin
I have a smoke filled aura
For my insides are burning
My love is in your shadows
My prayers are always near
And although I live oppressed Mallika
I have no fear
For I know that destiny will cause our paths to cross
And I shall process once more
The love I almost lost
Yes, yes
**Chorus**
Dear Mallika, sweet Mallika
As for me sweet Mallika, my country's in upheaval
Menus hearts have darkened
Seduced by silent evil
They oppress me for colour, class, even religion
Vacuums filled with narcissism sucking up the living
Colonial mentality
Conquerors of peaceful tribes
I suffocate and grow weary trying to stand in the tide
But just knowing that one day Ill have Mallika by my side
Helps me live on through the storm
And pull the thorns from my side
**Chorus**
Dear Mallika
Sweet sweet sweet sweet Mallika
For an eternity, I shall love you eternally
Wherever you go, my heart goes with you
Ill always love you
We will always be one",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-dear-mallika-lyrics

New York,Exit 13,2008.0," (Broadway sample & LL Cool J ad-libs)
It's up to you! New York!
Neeew Yoooooork!
New Yoooooooooooork!
It ain't a movie
Ayo Suits!
Probably gon' want some pasta after this one ya'meen?
Not to Spicy

New Yoooork!, New Yoooork!
The Cityyyy that doesn't sleep, New Yoooork!
New Yoooork!, New Yoooork!
The Cityyyy that doesn't sleep, New Yoooork!
(Cause sleep is the cousin of death)

Let me tell you what's up with all these New York cats
They got too rich and lost they grip on rap
They let the country boys take over the soundtrack
And blow the Superman kid straight off they back
Now everybody know where all the flavor is at
And if theres any drama, I'll be handlin' that
I gotta switch to singles and walk to fall back
Late-night conference calls and all that
Not the next Denzel, I'm the first LL
I remember where I came from, hot since day one
Queens in the building, I spank these children
For not seeing that I switch styles like chameleon
A lot of wanna-be kings but I'm the real one
All these cats playing dumb, they know the deal son
Use rap like caps, I will peal one
And ya reign is over nigga, here it come

New Yoooork!, New Yoooork!
The Cityyyy that doesn't sleep, New Yoooork!
(Cause sleep is the cousin of death)

Listen party people now here's the situation
All these cats is lyin' they have huge imaginations
Ain't freestyling, them niggas is free-basing
It's like a epidemic the beats they keep wasting
Feels like the 80's again, back to basics
Hit 'em with the raw shit, niggas is gon' chase it
And get addicted to how I spit it
I treat my beat like a blunt, lick and split it
My shit's wicked, fiends can't forget it
Take it in ya lungs, ya done, ya get lifted
Too many debates about what Mister Smith did
What can I say nigga? God's god I'm gifted
But I won't hit you with the same old money rap
Cause most of the money rappers need to give you ya money back
I'm just ya man next door, sharp hood cat
I want the crown back boy, ya don't deserve that!

New Yoooork!, New Yoooork!
The Cityyyy that doesn't sleep, New Yoooork!
(Cause sleep is the cousin of death)

Just when ya thought that I was calmin' down
I pulled a George Bush and I bombed the town
I got 'em runnin' for cover, ducking, running around
Like L's on the radio, ""wow how does it sound?""
Never been afraid to set it off on these clowns
Especially with all the hyped up trash they puttin' out
This is for the cats that consistently hold me down
Arguing in barbershops from Queens to Up-Town
I went to Hollywood and let 'em borrow the crown
But they got too cocky, I'm back to check these clowns
I dare one of yall to disrespect me now
And I'll die before that happens so inject me now
And I'm the best period, fuck pound-for-pound
When shit gets serious, I rock the crown
Matter of fact, where my real niggas at?
I got you, New York is on my back
Lets Go!

New Yoooork!, New Yoooork!
The Cityyyy that doesn't sleep, New Yoooork!

Rainin on niggas so bad they think it's drizzlin
Ground zero funk track it's mega
Doin wild damage to your arm, legga legga
Who's that? The bawla, the player, the mister with the techniques
Pumpin blends, creepin up the backstreets
Throw your rocks up high and let em gleam
It's the Uncle what? Uncle L makes a wild scene
And I be blowin all the rookies out the frame
And they be knowin Uncle's flowin in the game
Queens to uptown I'm gettin down for my crown
When you see me comin thru just gimme a pound
And say....

Yeah
I'm bout to wet it up, get it up
Take a track, drape it in jewels and set it up
I'm so nasty with mines, I warm it up like raw liquor
Dime pieces throw it at me like a free picker
I'm open, I let the funk soak in
I taste like an eighth, ya freeze and start chokin
Yeah son I'm all up in ya mix
Ya callin in your clique, I'm bawlin wit'cha trick
Golden rocks fallin off my neck and wrists
When I breeze by, you be groovin in the midst
Of my cycle, every move I make is vital
Crucial, official, brothers sayin ""L we miss you""
Much love to all the shooby doobies and cliques
While you're bawlin in the coupe you know I had to get the six
Get your swerve on boo, chill wit me
Get me, I want the CREAM, baby hit me
Now take it to the bridge

Beatin niggas all in their heads, so what you tellin me?
Get your drink on, throw you mink on
Let your head nod, stick it out, that's what I'm talkin bout
I got ya deep deep down inside my mixture
Swervin curbs, servin as I fixed ya
Formulated and combinated, the people congregated
You frontin for nothin, your crew is overrated
And I'ma take it on down to the AM
Keep the drama flowin til the party cave in
Uhh, I get you open, baby come and get a fix
Yo, that's word to mother I be droppin mad shit
Let's organise, bounce together for real son
Trick a little though, sip a little Moe, peace one

Mr. President,Exit 13,2008.0,"Dear Mr. President, with all due respect
Wish we could have a conversation
I would take a trip down to your residence
And we would talk about the state of the nation
Mr. President, I would ask you about the war
Really and truly, what is it for?
When a I.E.D. make a soldier fall
Is he dying for something above us all?
Is it all about him at the end of the day
Is a pledge of allegiance just something to say
I hope not, cuz I love the U.S.A
Despite of all the drama we have today
Mr. President are you aware?
Our flesh and blood is dying over there
When the coffins come back, do you care?
When only the poor kids die, is it fair?

If I could talk to the President
Would he pay attention, really listen?
If I could talk real intelligent
Would he beware and then change his position?
Now is time, time, time
For me to speak my mind, mind, mind

Don't get me wrong, I respect the flag
But it hurt to see a kid in a body bag
He fought for his country with all he had
Now he have a family without a dad
With a mama crying, the kids is scared
9/11, why were we unprepared?
Mr. President, are you aware?
Unless you rich you have poor health care
Makes you scream and wanna pull out your hair
Discharged from hospitals as soon as you get there
Mr. President, truth or dare
Terrorists are hiding, and you know where
Illegal immigrants are everywhere
Is it really their fault, they wanted to come here
I respect you, please be clear
But talk with me, show the people you care


What am I to do, have you wiggle any you
Tell me something that I just make sense
You sent us off to war, please be honest what it's for
Does it matter if it's life or death?

I'm not Republican or Democrat
I'm independent and I want the facts
When are the soldiers coming back?
Are we prepared for a terror attack?
Late at night I watch CNN
It gets so bad, I might stop breathing
The Middle East hates us, what's the reason?
Mr. President, my heart is bleeding
Tuck my kids in every evening
Try to teach them to keep believing
Hoping my government won't deceive them
Tell 'em, touch your goals, you could achieve them
Mr. President, I have to know
If I die for you, what will I have to show
Will it really and truly help our country go?
I'm waiting for your answer, let me know",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-mr-president-lyrics
After School,10,2002.0,"{P. Diddy and LL ad lib for 19 seconds}

I know a honey named Millie, raised out in Philly
Body so illy she make a grown man silly
A brainiac really she pretend she dilly
Like, ""Why you always look at me like that, you feel me?""

There's a girl named Wendy, love black Bentleys
Nails in her mouth, stay tryin to tempt me
She rolls with her sister and they both real friendly
It wasn't like that when my pockets was empty

Shorty named Suzie, not quite a floozy
Let's just say she has a problem bein choosy
Scarf on her doobie when she in the jacuzzi
On the celly with her man, ""Love you - I'm at the movies""

Bird named Chyna (baby where you find her)
Uptown, she wrote a map down with eyeliner
Hotness, two or three girlfriends behind her
(On Amsterdam, lay in the lane, dippin despite her)

So after school, I take a dip in the pool
Which is really, on the wall
I got a color TV, so I can see, the Knicks play basketball
And we talkin bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money
Than a sucker, could ever spend
But I couldn't give a what about them cats you with
Get your friends baby, jump in the Benz

I got a judge named Donna, I call her Your Honor
Whylin out with the gavel and the silk pajamas (let's go)

And then there's Tamika, the seargeant gets deeper
She turned the bass way up and wind on the speaker
Girl named Kelly, rhinestones in her belly
Curly red hair, crackin jokes in the telly
Game concealed, a female Machiavelli
Hopin and prayin that I ain't ready for the jelly

What about Asia (major flavor)
Can you feel it? Nothin can save ya
Once again I got 'em catchin the vapors

Mr. Smith bout to get this paper
Paparazzi, pleaase give me a minute
You're pushin me to the limit, I know that I represent it
Be easy!

Tammy, down in Miami
Fa'scheezy baby uhh, I see you at the Grammy's


Everybody go - I wanna rock right now
LL and Diddy, we came to get down
Yes we're internationally known
For making movies and the microphone
Cause we get crazy, I mean outrageous
You rollin with us? You rollin with flavor
Ask Penny, I call her Good'n'Plenty (why?)
Cause after the show, there's nuttin open but Denny's (oh yeah)
Maybe the waffle house, down South there's many
She fix me a T-bone and take it to the Bentley

Little Shaniqua, from Massapequa
Went and bought a beeper so I could reach her - anyway

When you talk about Diddy and L
You talk about careers that's hard to kill
The whole entire globe recognize the grill
Walkin down the red carpet we're chilly chill!


Everybody go - I wanna rock right now
LL and Diddy, we came to get down
Yes we're internationally known

You’re My Heart,Walking with a Panther,1989.0,"Do you remember, the first time you fell in love
The way it felt, the way it feels
Bein able to say, from the bottom of your heart
{*smooch*} I love you for real
Your eyes, meet; you feel your heartbeat
Palms are sweaty you can't keep still
And when you finally touch 'em, and hug 'em and kiss 'em
.. OOOOOOH what a thrill!
You was always searchin, and finally your dream came true
They came strollin along
And you promised 'em, straight up and down sweetheart
I swear - I'll never do you wrong
Hand in hand, heart to heart
Nothin in the world could seperate the two
And even though you've only known that person for a short time
You tell 'em I love you -- you're my heart
You argue witcha parents, and they argue BACK
You're too young to be so serious
You tell 'em that's not true, I'll go on without you
And walk away aggravated and furious
You want 'em to approve, but then again it don't matter
The relationship's yours
You feel you're maturin, and hey..
You can fight your own battles and wars
You discuss it with your love and it's the same for them
So the two of you decide we're gonna weather the storm
Life is sweet, kissin caressin and huggin
And keepin each other warm
But now comes the serious part, cause love
Believe me, it ain't a easy task
We'd have one argument too many
And you'd have to ask -- am I still your heart?
Am I still your HEART or is somethin, pullin us apart
Cause baby if it is, please let me know what
You run out the door, I tell you come back
I love you - you shout out, so what?
How could you hurt me? How could you treat me
Like you never loved me, were you playing a game?
And if so, I only have one request: sit down and explain
To me, the person who treated you right, did you right
And held you tight, every night
Is there another lover in your life, that has you uptight?
Cause if it is, aww, baby, please.. don't do this to me
I'm tryin to reach you, tryin to talk to you
It's killin me -- cause you're my heart
That's right I admit it
You're my heart I refuse, to let you go
I struggle and fight for you against all odds
Get down on my knees, and pray to God
That our love is in the cards
Cause I know you're right for me
And I know I'm right for you
There's no way in the world I'll let you slip out of my hands
People say forget about it, move on
.. but see they don't understand
You're nothin to them, but you're so much to me
So much in fact that I'd give my life
To stare into your eyes and caress your face
As the priest, announces us man and wife
We'd live happily, ever after
White picket fence and the whole nine yards
And anything that anybody said
I'd disregard -- if I was still your heart
So make up your mind, cause I've made up my mind
I'm beggin you baby please come back home
I'll be tossin and turnin, as I lay in my bed
Sorrow surrounds me I can feel it in my bones
This can't be true, I'm losin you
Oh Lord have mercy, please make it alright
All I wanna do in this whole wide world.. is hold you tight
I've ripped open my heart, shed tears and cried
Now it's up to you baby, please understand
I forgive you for everything, and give you anything
Just let me take ya by the hand
And lead ya, baby I got ya
Protect you like a mother, protects a child
Now it's up to you.. I'mma call you in a little while
You're my heart",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-youre-my-heart-lyrics
Hot Hot Hot,Phenomenon,1998.0,"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah yeah yeah
Uh, uh, uh

I was swervin' through Queens, fully growin' Benz
Searchin' for the butters through my Cartier lenses system
Banging out nothing but the blends on the digital startec
Rappin' to my mens
Then spotted the most exotic, cheekiness, half Rachel, half Holly
My  is
The slow-mo, crept up nice and slow
Breathin' on my ice, so it shine real nice
Crease my scar piece, laid back in my seat
Right near Bazely projects, on the back streets
Her name was Keisha, full of street knowledge
Pumped a little trees, but she planned to go to college
Staring at my ice, smellin' my cologne
She lived on the southside, so bring things on
Honey got flavour, and it just don't stop
Does she want me for me, or me for my rocks

Your car make me hot hot hot
You just make me just hot hot hot
Like you're rocks rocks rocks
They make me hot hot hot
Baby boy, don't stop stop stop
You keep me hot hot hot
I'm a take you for all you've got

She slid up my whip, like the queen of New York
We jetted to city island to eat shrimp and talk
Sourced up my keys to the valet cat
I glanced at the fatty, I'm a see about that
We blazed in the spizza like Bonnie and Clyde
Scooby dooby hizza
I'm feeling the vibe, cop the blue for some video type shit
Knowing all along how hot these kind of nights get, uh
I've got her right where I want her
Reality about to creep up on her
Stroke her softly, gently with my G
While the light reflects off my icp
Waiter, ice the crystal, let it simmer
Lights too bright, here's a grand make them dimmer
I kept fronting and I just couldn't stop
I don't mind spending paper when it's looking that hot

Your car makes me hot hot hot
You just make me just hot hot hot
I Iike you're rocks rocks rocks
They make me hot hot hot
Baby boy, just don't stop stop stop
You keep me hot hot hot
I'll take you for all you've got
Baby girl, just stop stop stop
Check yourself, uh

You burst out of semi-
She pulled down the straps to her dress
Reached in the  sparked up sess
Banging some Wu-Tang, feeling the 
She said, ""Now would you wanna sell your soul for chips
And give up girl to push whips?""
Never miss some spiritual down to my bone
Why you takin' jumbo in that zone?
She said, ""I would do anything for 
Give deep  to  man coats
Take off my , drop to my knees""
Talking in my face, breath smelling like cheese
I asked her, ""Shorty you degrade yourself
Just to throw a little bit of ice on the shelf""
You turnin' me off, I can't lie, Keisha said, ""Why?""
I said, ""Yo, how can a man respect that
Knowin' if he paid, then he correct that""
Ice is the price for an overnight wife
A true shark caller don't want that in his life
So all you ladies that are selling you're souls
You need to put you hooker vibes on hold
Ask for Keisha, she working on the stroll
Dead ass broke, but her pimp the man grow

Your car makes me hot hot hot

Pure raw
We sold out
You bought more

It was meant to be
Hip hop died, reincarnated through me
Now the promoters gotta double my fee
‘Cause these pop melodies ain’t fucking with me
Get back on your tour bus roll some broccoli
I'll leave your crew twisted and your hoes knock kneed
Hell through (time) and the game in my speed
‘Cause water down hip hop we do not need
Yes sir, I got the real recipe
A little bit of 
old E
 and bon bon Z
I guess by now you can tell you miss me
The baddest motherfucker in rap history
One to the temple put you out your misery
That’s not an album , that’s a frisbee
Tangle with LL boy that’s risky
Them boys is backwash, we want whiskey

(Jump on it! jump on it!)
When the chips is down you gotta fight for the crown
(Jump on it! jump on it!)
Tell them boys over there get down or lay down
(Jump on it! jump on it!)
I got the house of pain for your little pop clown
(Jump on it! jump on it!)
Don’t get it criss cross we’re taking over the town

Roll up on your set pull out the 4 pound
Who’s pitching out here blast them off the mound
The game got us bored, no rebounce
Claims he’s hardcore how he sound
My radio’s a bunch of noise in the background
For a factory manufacturing pop clowns
That’s what happens when LL ain’t around
The pop stars flooding and the hip hop drowns
DJ suffer while sarada goes round
You screaming? got the real creaming
Welcome to hip hop, we’re out here fiending
Watch a program directed in the bin and
Went from cruss group to a boy band screaming
When it come under the car I ain’t leaning
I wish I could bump the brim creaming
I tell you what, play my stupid — call it even


What y’all want, no cut!
What y’all need, pure raw
What we do, we sold out
All because.. you bought more!
No affects on my voice, that’s my choice
Hard raw beat make a soft voice moist
Get the dinero bring the heat like Jon Voight
Timbaland music, rolls royce
Hit you in the head like a fat joint
Back to the S’s big meat in Detroit
L so perceptive shrud in the droit
Bad motherfucker, now you get the point?

It'll make your bitch nipples as hard as rocks
Givin' head to the Glock, pretend it's hard cock
Splashin' niggas, I came slow through the block
I, the original, visual, individual
Ten times platinum, your career's lookin' critical
Rich from this, motherfuck bein' a criminal
Look in your bitch eyes, the vibe is subliminal
You wanna freestyle? Fuck that
I need at least seven figures to even touch that
But since everybody was underestimatin' my format
I dropped 
Ill Bomb
 and now niggas want more of that
Ain't a rapper dead or alive fuckin' with me
Ask the last bitch that tried to come and get me
Talk about paper, I can talk about broads
I can talk about movies
, I can talk about awards
Fuck the fantasies, yo I got all four
And 2001 will be mine, by law
Why'd I name it 'Greatest Of All Times?'
Because for fifteen years I kept y'all standin' in line
Lovin' the way I shine and my lyrics combine
With the ruggedest, illest beats that Def Jam can find
Fuck them other niggas with their 9 or 10 hits
My hits run deep as the emotions of your bitch
Back in the days it was the M-5 stick
But now the Bentley Azure get more whores on the dick
This one's for Clue and my Rikers Island niggas
That remember when I came through
The bing O B C C H D M 2 C 74

That's the joint you gotta listen to, y'knahmean?

I got the key that fits the lock of a real dog's mind B
The answer to the question chicks ask most the time see
Why my man cheat and give some bitch my heat?
Slap me one day then Sunday he's so sweet?
To me and mine, this nigga's hard to define
'Cause he beefin' when he broke but he arrogant when he shine
It fucks you up, you wonder if you wastin' time
Mention marriage, he lit a Dutch and peeped out the blinds
What different niggas feels in they hearts is scary
I used to say shit like
""C'mon baby, you should be honored to share me""
She used to throw the cakes up, plus the burger was hairy
I used to have to think of shit to keep 'em comin', you niggas feel me?
Baby or no baby, I wasn't loyal or nothin'
Just me and my niggas on tour, frontin' and hittin' somethin'
Red lipstick prints all over my drawers
Oh you wanna be an actress huh?  Well my movie's hardcore
Like Dungeons & Dragons; gettin' brains in a Benz wagon
Step out, jeans saggin', crew laughin'
Gettin' blazed by the fiend for ten bones a piece
Nothin' but the dog in me needin' to be released
This is us

You know that I do, the best that I can
But you don't seem to love me no more, no more
I try to please you, and be your man
But you don't seem to love me no more, no more

The flipside of the coin, what team you wanna join?
You in The Tunnel every Sunday exposin' your tenderloins
In every rap cat's face, with some ol' flirty shit to say
Need to go home, wash your kids up, and put your tits away
Me and my clique in motion, champagne and Alize
Got your mind bubblin crazy, wanna flip Cool J
Spend your last on your hairdo, but you ain't save a dime
To put your child through college baby, now have you?
Go get a job interview, your bad-ass kids a curfew
And skip that ""Bills Bills"" shit broads is goin' through
I know this prostitute who said that life ain't cute
Child born with a destiny only God can dispute
Players giggle and laugh, flashin' gats and cash
My dogs don't care about you Boo, they like your ass
Told me if I call and your man answer, ask for L
So he can say, ""No L live here,"" our code is ill
Tell him you about to catch a flick with Sherell
Plottin' and schemin' in the shower, masturbatin' on the cell
The neighborhood hustler, that cat we all know
That nigga we grew up with, son from next do'
My dream was to flow and escape the hell below
But the demons in my life set fire to my dough
I thought about murder, I vowed my revenge
Like the devil's pumpin' hate through my heart with a syringe
This is us

You know that I do, the best that I can
But you don't seem to love me no more, no more
I try to please you, and be your man
But you don't seem to love me no more, no more

They say a man gon' be a man, but that's only half the scenario
You nag a cat, you givin' him a license to fuck a hoe
When a man come home late, he want his girl to say hello
Not hear all that bullshit, bout, ""Nigga where you go?""
Fried chicken ready, t-shirt and panties at the stove
Messages written down, blunt rolled ready to go
Give me a hug, not too long, give me space
When a cat got issues don't need you all up in his face
Rub your breasts, kick back, smile a little
If it's rainin' outside, chill, listen to the drizzle
Now kiss my chest, call me Superman
Pull down my boxers by the Calvin Klein band
 wash it, enjoy the flavor, I return the favor
This behavior, should save ya
From me all night freakin', with a nineteen-year-old
Half naked Puerto Rican, creamy ass leakin
Every man will agree, when she nag it's killin' me
I don't always wanna talk about how the world is shittin' on me
I sip some Alize and meditate the pain away
And get in my own zone where I wanna be alone for solo
Reminisce with photos
And missed opportunities to make some dough flow, you know?
Chill, relax baby, support me from the background
Believe in my dreams, instead, you and your girls sat 'round
Complain about, who's tradin' ass for cash
If there ain't no trust then just us can't last
This is us, I know you feelin' that
Think about that shit, word up

Your man, your man, your man
Everything we've been through yeah
All the places we've been yeah
Just don't know if I'll be the same again, ha
Ever since you walked all all over me, ha
And even if we bring this back together, ha
You know it won't be the same, no no no no
No no no no no, ha
Oh I, I, baby I, tried to be your man
Woah, oh, yeah
Hooo hooo hooo
Can't you hear me?  Can't you hear me?

Not Leaving You Tonight,Authentic,2013.0,"Farmer's Boulevard

I'll be by your side when the chips are down
I know you had some problems but I'm here now
You'll never be alone long as I'm around
Good hearts don't belong in the lost and found
So, I pick up the pieces, erase your frown
And I show my true colors when we paint the town
I hate to hear you cry; I don't like the sound
So my love is turned up; sheets get turned down
I know it hurts now; the drama's the worst now
It's fourth and a hundred, but love's a first down
A quarterback to come back right now
When a Hail Mary works, the world is like, ""Wow!""
You down for the count? I ain't having it, baby
They can all go to hell, I know they calling me crazy
But you're my sunshine when the world gets shady
A toast to the first lady

You shouldn't be (You shouldn't be alone) alone (Nah)
I'm not leaving you tonight
Love, you know, I'm right here
I'm not leaving you tonight
(Fitz and the Tantrums, huh?)
Go away, baby (That's right)
I'm not leaving you tonight
Go away, baby (Uh, uh)
I'm not leaving you, not leaving you tonight
(Farmer's Boulevard)

Turn your back on it, and the sun still shines
Grapes get old, and they turn into wine
The deeper the roots, the stronger the vines
These lines on my face just a sign of the times
You could cry on my shoulder if you're so inclined
I used to be a Casanova in the lunch room line
Now there's more important things occupying my mind
Like being there for you, breathing the air for you
Do trust falls and truth or dare for you
The weight of the world, I'm prepared to bear for you
The haters get cynical and call you spoiled
Not knowing about the drama in which you embroiled
The numerous pit falls, the tussle and the toil
But farmers taught me to put seeds in the soil
And here comes the harvest; this part's the hardest
I'm still here regardless

You shouldn't be (I'm still here, baby) alone
I'm not leaving you tonight (And you shouldn't be alone)
Love, you know, (Uh, uh) I'm right here
I'm not leaving you tonight (Nah, nah)
Go away, (Yeah) baby
I'm not leaving you tonight (Uh)
Go away, baby
I'm not leaving you, not leaving you tonight

(When I'm alone in my room, sometimes, I stare at the wall)
(And, in the back of my mind, I hear my conscience call)
(When I'm alone in my room, sometimes, I stare at the wall)
(And, in the back of my mind, I hear my conscience call)

You shouldn't be (I'm still here, baby) alone
I'm not leaving you tonight (And you shouldn't be alone)
Love, you know, (Uh, uh) I'm right here
I'm not leaving you tonight (Nah, nah)
Go away, (Yeah) baby

Truth,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Uh yeah
See, this is what these mixtapes is all about
Knah'msayin KaySlay?
Talk to the people, with no interruptions and interference
Put that mic down, admire the technique and tight tight sounds
Of a Renagade, never been afraid, the time is right now
Before I take my bow and finally allow
My love affair with rap to fade, I'll sink into the page
Pleasure and the pain that came from rulin' the game
And the half Dominican that gave me brains in the fast lane
A seventeen-year reign, simple and plain
When I ruled the rap game and all my peers sold cocaine
One-three-two Uptown, when Rich Porter told me
""See you can push a new car, it's different for a rap star""
And AZ was givin' 50s to the homeless
They never bragged about it ? ""L, we don't condone this""
On the back of the bike with Alpo
Doin' a buck down one-two-five, hopin' to stay alive
Favorite spot rooftop
Me and Big chuckle up when he was hittin' up ""Juicy"" and whatnot
Damn, when Dapper Dan got shot up
Before they made drops when we had to cut the top up
Some cats neglected the fact that L was hot
Cause they warm and electin' me hot when I stepped in the spot
Lyrically reppin' the block on Farmers to rock
But my sex symbol status made me, corny to cop
The microphone strategist ripped the apparatus
Left competition embarrassed but I never held malice
Kinda saw street literature
Used to lose battles on purpose so these cats can dream more
I want to see y'all shine without the use of a nine
You might see a nigga, I see a black Einstein
A diamond in the rough, he's remidin' me as tough
Young girls takin' X, she's blinded by the stuff
Oh my God, where did we go wrong?
Are you doin' what you're doin 'cause I ruined you with songs?
God forgive me, I never knew my power to devour the demons
Y'all know the Devil be schemin'
It's a manifestation of the pain of a nation
That makes materialism the only thing we're chasin'
The real gangstas never talked to me tough
Never told me they was hard, or claimed to be my God
When I first found the courage to bounce up outta Queens
And saw Big Dave comin' up out the store with money machines
My only dream was to rock mics in the spotlight
Joint bumpin' on Marley Show all night
Whoever thought that I would be a movie star?
A rap icon, chokin' the game like a python
Russell turned the hype on, exploded like a pipe bomb
Just because a young boy, turned the mic on
Still admire skills and cats that are ill
With lyri-kills, nowadays the chorus is payin' the bill
The black man found a way outta the hood
Now it's slaves to mayor's not all good
Don't let 'em take our music and plagiarize the game
Then you call up and request it and pretend it's really flames?
The tip of the iceberg, I'll hold my piece
In the meantime, live smart, watch out for the beast
Lyrical Picasso flow masterpiece
Like Michaelangelo or Rembrant, you know?
Si palare poco Italiano
LL bravisimo, grazie, prego!
Más mejor siempre mi amigo
Pero, music is muy muy duro
Tú sabe, que tú quieres es no problema
Te quiero mucho, yo comprendo your dilemma
Sumer's comin', it won't always be winter
I pray to God He forgives me, I'm a sinner
That's a little message
All the brothers and sisters out there
Y'all be strong
Keep your dreams flowin' baby
KaySlay I'm out for presidents to represent me
But I want to get 'em the right way, y'know?",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-truth-lyrics
We Came To Party,Authentic,2013.0,"I just wanna make sweet love to you, baby, you know what I’m saying?
I just wanna touch you all over… aw, please!

We came to party, we came to party
We came to party, we came to party
We came to party, we came to party
Hey look, I've got my hands all on your body

Ain’t no problem, I’m on it – oldest man in the club
Also one of the richest, a hundred bottles of bub
It’s just me and the Russians, we get all of the love
They was aware of the image, they wanna see what he does
TMZ in my face, Oprah all on my couch
Now I’m hosting the Grammys, what is this all about?
International baller, I must admit I had doubts
If they wasn’t callin’ me back, they was callin’ me out
Game moved to the South, I just closed my mouth
Intellect like Belichick when he be switching the routes
I’m too old for the games, no time for the lames
Next challenge? Get this generation screaming my name
Who could do what I did? Boy, I must be the shit
Waved 106 & Park to play date with the kids
People texting my wife, tryna ruin my night
So I help ‘em mind they business with some bottles on ice


Destruction in the club

Oh, no… Big Snoop Dogg
Ice so cold you can see it through the fog
To walk in my shoes it’ll be a little jog
And if you step by the pockets, you gon’ be up in the morgue
The peoples is peepin’, peepin’
The bitches is dippin’, dippin’
So this is the mission, listen, I turn this shit up
It’s the party-rocking, nonstopping, four-hopping, rip and rock
Drippin’ in this motherfucker, burn up, now turn up!

We ain’t flirtin’, we talkin’ – we ain’t dancin’, we walkin’
Teenagers is pointin’, couple cougars are hawkin’
I don’t come here that often, but it’s totally awesome
When you livin’ for real, I don’t consider it flossin’
Panty lines are crossin’, I’m proceedin’ with caution
I don’t shit where I eat, gotta manage your portions
LL Cool J, I’m like the old-school orphan
Representing alone, sittin’ on factory chrome
Shades on, in the zone – Kool Aid smile on my face
My security’s strapped, ain’t no beef, just in case
Me and my man Rich Whites, we in Vegas tonight
Claudine on the celly, make sure that money is right
Red carpet and tuxes, always where the bucks is
Paparazzi are snapping, I can’t believe this is happening
Frustrating the haters, they’re so sick of me rapping
I’m enjoying your blog, I’ve got the same type of passion


Fatman Scoop, Maserati Cool J
They ain’t think I can do it, that’s why I had to debut it
And let the critics review it, that way I spit and it’s Buicks
Since the beginning, I knew it – rollin’ an L in the Buick
Had the guts to pursue it, that’s how a legend should do it",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-we-came-to-party-lyrics

Uh, pimp shit
Yeah, turn my shit up a little bit
My vocals, uh, uh
I hypnotize ya eyez and then you recognize
That the sparkles of my chrome shoes paralyze
Gettin' money like this, people want my vibe
Full of jealousy and pride, hate the way I ride
Sometimes ya speak, sometimes ya don't
Figure this nigga souped up, cause he couped up
Guaranteed to rip shit, soon as its louped up
Ya niggas slept, swear your girl's panties wasn't wet
I'm a star, double the dick, the double R
Never score hard to leave the bubble scarred
Not the car, it's the man, daddy cool put it down
No comparin' me to ya'll, nigga is circus clowns
L. ain't worth paper, ask Russell Simmons who put 'em up in that skyscraper
Ask my dogs up at Fubu, who made them major
LL nigga, now who's next that need a favor
Drop a bomb on 'em
Remain calm on 'em
Peirce the nipples, throw the LL charm on 'em
Keep gangsta shit pumpin through my system
When my strobe lights flash you can't miss' em
Listen
Call my name, ooh
Call my name, uhh
Call my name, aw yeah
Call my name
59th street bridge up a roadway, do about a buck
Pumpin Mobb up in the Cadillac truck, don't give a fuck
Gold tint, goldiggen broads getting bent
We can fuck, but you ain't getting 10 cent, Who want it?
Lay the facts out until the cats out
Set 'cha back out, sweat 'cha tracks out, blow out your weed
You wake up in the mornin to a note, ""Nigga had to leave.""
Be easy, you shoulda teased me, instead of bein sleazy
I wouldn't do you greezy,
 come across more floss than gold teeth
I learned you can't eat, if ya hold beef, with niggas underneath
Still I'm a lyrically hold it down
L back in town, 'case the bell sound for second round
Some of these old ctas is funny, fuck who's legendary
I'm tryin to get this money
Drop a bomb on 'em, and 
pour dom
 on 'em
As soon as the track come on, I transform on 'em
Keep gangsta shit pumpin through my system
Strobe lights flashin can't miss' em
Listen
Call my name, ooh
Call my name, uhh
Call my name, aw yeah
Call my name
Rappers don't reall want it, they might claim they do
They know I'm catchin bodies, go 'head name a few
After I blaze you, I get a doughnut
Don't want no blood up on my chrome shoes
Lord have mercy, this rookies got it confused
You thought you caught me slippin, I was falsely accused
Sleepin with my eyez wide shut, like Tom Cruise
They wishin an impossible mission to see me lose
Lay up time to choose, all I hate is on the left
You hopin and prayin you get to hear me take my last breath
Lyrically, but I gang bang the track, chop sling like Cracker
Hundred keys a month, you fuckin up G backs nigga
Invincible, unstoppable ya'll niggas ain't ill your illogicale
This is L, the pigeon thriller, dream fulfiller
A little somethin for ya ice guerillas\
Drop a bomb on 'em
When its time to attack Quiet Storm on 'em
Hold ya nuts and keep ya palms on 'em

Can't explain it
My love when we're together
You're the greatest, nobody does it better
When you hold me
I wish that I could be your, one and only
Nobody does it better

I understand you want canaries on your hand
Masterpiece Rollie, gold tri-color band
Cute wedding pictures sittin' on the nightstand
You don't wanna make it happen unless it's the right man
I know you won't touch me unless you trust me
You kiss me and hug me but still won't crush me
I'm kissin' on your neck real tender
Gentle as can be, but you still won't surrender
Let me kiss your eyes
Let the smell of the incense enhance the vibe
I pull back to stare at your eyes
Sittin' there quiet like I'm hypnotized
We kiss a little more, laugh and smile
Might even share a lollipop, you know my style
Kick your Charles Davids off, relax for a while
Let's pretend that we're walkin' down the aisle
I can't explain it

Can't explain it
My love when we're together
You're the greatest, nobody does it better
When you hold me
I wish that I could be your, one and only
Nobody does it better

Straight up, you beautiful B
I don't think you understand what you doin to me
On the couch witcha legs crossed, watchin' TV
Shoe hangin' off the tip of your foot, you killin me
Uhh.. then we kiss for real
I'm fully prepared, I'm already steel
You go to the bathroom for a second
I understand baby, I know what you checkin' (a-heh-heh)
That's when you come back and walk to me slow
That's when you change up and let it all flow
I'm kissin' on your belly ring nice and slow
I love to take my time, love to give you a show
Get the warm chocolate syrup to travel below
Use my ears like handlebars, take control
Ain't no sense in stayin' calm and playin' the role
Baby relax, let me touch your soul
I can't explain it

Can't explain it
My love when we're together
You're the greatest, nobody does it better
When you hold me
I wish that I could be your, one and only
Nobody does it better

My turn to get rocked, lifted out my socks
With sound effects and whatnot (mmm)
A little perfume above the right spot, just a touch
Never too much, I lick it like a Dutch
Two of my favorite numbers, you know what I mean
Add 'em up and they equal fifteen
You the 6... I needed you like a fix
I can see it my mind, I knew we was gon' click
I pick up the pace
You feel the stubble from my beard on your face
I look at your lips and take a taste
Switch it up I got my hands on your waist
We whylin' out, we all over the place
I'm holdin' on with a strong embrace
You holdin' on and tryin to keep the faith
Together we blast to outer space, I can't explain it

Can't explain it

You're the greatest, nobody does it better

And try a couple things we ain't never did before
Maybe you can be a freak for me at the door

Girl, take it down low, make it clap real slow
I never had so much fun without spending dough
Baby, you the star of the big boy show
I love you even more now that you unpredictable
Once we in the bedroom, ain't no telling what we'll do
So what you wanna do?


You like it when your clothes are invisible (uh)
This condition is critical (yeah)
Off to the bedroom, here we go (uh)
You alot better than my new girl's underworld (uh-huh)

To the highest extent, bloody clothes doin' battle
Til the death of my foes, it's my show

Homicide,G.O.A.T. (Greatest of All Time),2000.0,"This for my man yo... word up
""I got a 187 on the corner of Farmers Boulevard in Linden.""
""Uh, drug related?""
""The usual.""

I don't mean this in a disrespectful way
But Columbine happens in the ghetto every day
When the shit goes down y'all ain't got nothing to say

He kicked the old lady's door in, threw her on the floor
Choked her to death so she don't scream no more
He need some white chocolate, he feel it in his bones
He heard she refinanced and got a bank loan
He used to mow the lawn, take the garbage out
Now she in the closet wit a sock in her mouth
Copped a chain, copped some crills
Crack pipe in his windpipe, twistin' like a drill
Run around frontin', buyin' his mens kicks
Gassed a broad up so she can help her rent a whip
The other killer peeped him out flashin' a knot
A well-known murderer, check the ill plot
Call up Corey Buns, get him on the block
Niggas gotta eat, plus he front a lot
He came through, straight strip search
He said I'm comin' back, and I'ma put in work
Niggas told him, ayo leave that shit alone
But pride mixed with crack, had him in a zone
Prepared for more shit than Depends
Eyes bloodshot through a Cardier lens
Niggas said Buns came through lookin' strange
Yeah, Buns won't stay in his lane
Aight, Buns want ghetto fame
And caught two in the Ukraine at point blank range

It's a, homicide, just a homicide

When the shit goes down y'all ain't got nothing to say

Jamaican cat, real treacherous
Used to smuggle burners up from Texas
Had the ill crib out in Rosedale
Took the money from the trunk and copped the fish scale
Chinese, Jamaican, real pretty nigga
Love puffin' blunts, throwin' bodies in the river
One of the illest niggas that the world ever saw
Used to take loaded nines and throw 'em on the floor
He was from Brooklyn, and I don't know the block
I met him at the flicks he commented on my rocks
We rolled back to back, while I was slingin' raps
He was slingin' crack, I was seventeen fascinated by the stacks
Runnin' with dangerous niggas and packin' gats
Uh, the shit thrill me, lookin' so clean, and livin' so filthy
I heard his right-hand man disappeared
They found his bike in the street somewhere
Conspiracy theories, niggas talkin' shit
Small world, I was close to his right-hand man's chick
She kept beepin' him he never called back
When they found him in the trunk his body was jet black
Pretty Jamaican kept doin' his thing
Him and his older brother got caught up in a sting
Out on bail, pressure by the Feds, he caught seven in the head
What goes around, comes back around
Nigga rest in peace when they lay ya down

""Uh, central, your assistance is requested we have a major crisis here
Mrs. Winthrop's cat is stuck in a tree""
""Roger, a squad car is on the way""

It's a, homicide, just a homicide
It's a, homicide, just a homicide
It's a, homicide, just a homicide
It's a, homicide, just a homicide
I don't mean this in a disrespectful way
But Columbine happens in the ghetto every day
When this shit goes down y'all ain't got nothing to say
""Central, the cat has been rescued""

In the ghetto black men are dyin' at alarmin' rates
Walkin' the street is like entering a sweepstakes
You never know if you gon win or lose
We walk around feelin' confused and totally abused
Can't front, I'ma millionaire livin' like a king
Still feenin' for that shrimp, fried rice and chicken wings
Still feenin' for the vibe, only the ghetto bring
Pumpin' songs of pain only real niggas sing
Queens finest, but there's one minus
The bodies on the battlefield that got left behind us
I'm sick and tired of going to wakes
'Cause niggas never look the same in the casket
It's bugged out, they skin look like plastic
I shed tears, but use shades to mask it
""Mr. Media"", where was you at when my man died
When it was classified a drug related homicide
It's like until the killer hit the suburbs
I ain't hear nothing, not a word
""Mr. Media"", help us shed light on these homicides
Not just Columbine, but all the time

It's a, homicide, just a homicide
It's a, homicide, just a homicide

Nitro,Walking with a Panther,1989.0,"Check this
I excel, they fell, I said - well, hell
L can yell or make em melt like gel
I signed the contracts that bills'll stack
Play the wall or fall I stand tall you're small in fact
Step aside, you might get fried
By the super technique that the rapper applied
As a matter of fact, the impact will distract
Your attention away, from the rest who say
They can mess with Cool J the best of today
You fess
 cause the rhymes are so funky fresh
I'mma attack smack and make em stand back
Black strong as Cognac I got the knack
To rhyme to the rhythm of this, and give em a gift
That's swift, other rappers are stiff and don't riff with
Mr. Smith
, cause that ain't safe
I get you wide open like an uncut eighth
I write to fight, don't bite, to reach heights
The mic makes right, give me the spotlight
So I can prove the pen is mightier than the sword
LL hard as hell
, the lyrical lord
The counterfeit misfits that rap had to admit that
My rhymes are so dangerous, I need a permit to rap
Solo, on the microphone
MC's -- don't let me catch you alone
I'm nitro!
Yo, I got the kick of a kettle drum, guaranteed to overcome
You're just a minimum, messin with the maximum
And when I swung my tongue among the high strung
Young MC's, they all got done by the legend
Every second I'm wreckin
Not a mistake you'll find, but you can keep checkin
Out the sound you'll find that it's genuine
Bet that you'll rewind this a thousand times
You can taste the bass like it's filet-of-sole
I leave the microphone full of bullet holes
I drop the bomb like I'm in 'Nam and go beyond
The normal boundaries of too much harm
To MC's, but as they say please I freeze
Rhymes like these kill like a disease
Tried to fill my shoes, and caught the blues
Because they get bruised by the rhymes I choose
I kill rappers at random, I don't understand em
The ones I didn't get, are on a memorandum
Lines I recite are spontaneous
The nursery rhymes you write, are miscellaneous
So pass the crown, bow down and give in
I'm the Prince of Rap, that's how we livin
Settin milestones on the microphone
Empires are overthrown, and I ain't even baritone
No joke I spoke then God stroke
As Job tried to sweat the style and got soaked
Conquered and killed on the microphone
MC's -- don't let me catch you alone
LL's nitro!
Nitro!
Yo, flammable -- like gasoline
Threatening -- like a guillotine
It's like a bad dream when you battle my team
I go to every extreme to make MC's scream
I'm clever, I last forever, we can do whatever
With whoever, whenever, I never
Ever got rocked, stopped or dropped
They got popped, by the hip-hop rock that I concoct
I'm so nice yo, flowin with the maestro
Murderin and hurtin MC's because I'm nitro
The earthquakes'll kill snakes and fakes
You can't flake, you made a mistake, give me a break, thanks
Now that we're straight and that's clear
Watch all the big mouths - dissapear
Disintergrate, deteriorate, fall
I demonstrate, and devastate you all
There's no doubt about the fact I turn it out, the wack
Be on the lookout, LL made a comeback
Full of power, I'mma devour
I stand tall as a tower, I won't allow a
MC to C-O-M-E, C-L-O-S-E
Play me long D-I-S-T-A-N-C-E, M-C's
On the microphone, I'm nitro!
Nitro!
Yo (funky)
I daze amaze faze blaze and beat em down
Nowadays they crave and praise, the funky sound I pound
Rhymes I write em in, recite em and then slide em in
Order to slaughter comp and stomp soon as I begin
Total domination, across the nation
Devestation, cut sensation, it's the invasion
Of L the Terrible, devastating rhymin wiz
I cut through through do and chew, you know what time it is
Slick, I kill for kicks, vic you quick
Hard as bricks, rock ya sick over the mix
The L, L, C, O, O -- L J Period now you know bro!

Why Do You Think They Call it Dope?,Walking with a Panther,1989.0,"Warning, MC's stand back
You better take a chill and observe the skill
Of the man who can, so understand god damn
I got a masterpiece a master plan and a brand new
Way to attack the wack cut 'em down to size
To realize LL's back
Don't sleep I'm too sweet to repeat a beat
A lyric or rhyme I wouldn't waste your time
With weak words, that's for nerds, you never heard a rhyme
So you deserve a line rougher than rough enough is enough
I'm, gonna slaughter choke ya smoke ya like a sauna
You don't really wanna
But if you wanna battle on here's a lesson: stop 'fessin
I'm a lethal weapon, you better get to steppin
Off the stage, and outta my face
You're too light *in the asshole* save the bass
Why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you why do you think they call it dope?
It seems like people'll never understand
On the microphone I'm not your average man
I cool out sometimes, I save my best rhymes
And then the toy boy thinks that he can come and get mine
Let your friends gas him up, talk trash and make bets
Then gets played like those kids who tried to rob Goetz
You don't know what I'm sayin? Yo check it
Give me any microphone and god damnit I'll wreck it!
I'm coldblooded I'm about to mutilate
Last year before I left I told you to wait
But you couldn't stay loyal started goin astray
Thinkin Tom, Dick, and Harry can mess with Cool J
Is you crazy? I'm boomin, got the talent of two men
The stamina and skill in battle to kill a few men
The heart of a lion, the loyalty of a soldier
I wreck your whole mob then tell ya I told ya!
Why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you why do you think they call it dope?
Cause I don't jab around you, I come inside
Bob and weave, deceive until you get tongue tied
Brawl for all give a lyrical display
And next time you know better than to get in my way
""Yo whassup wit LL?
Will he ever make another 'Rock the Bells'?""
Yo brothers is comin up, ""I think he's fallin off
I don't think he's still 'hard as hell'""
See, this is the attitude, of ignorant ones
Cause they don't know, all them MCs'll get done
One or two might say, ""Yo L'll be back""
But the rest they be suckin on Sugar Smacks
Talkin that crap about who's better than me
You think so? Just let a MC
Make me mad enough, to really wanna battle
I put a L on his ass like he was cattle!
Why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you why do you think they call it dope?
Just cause I make a love song, or say a simple rhyme
""Boom, move over L, it's Miller Time""
I don't know whether to laugh, get ill or get wild
Cause brothers don't realize, I got so many styles
Like triplin up the words, confusin all the nerds
Heard put my sights on mics and ?? flippin above the
Word to the mother, no other MC brother
Can mess with Ladies Lover
I'm original, I'm bright under color
And when I get on the mic, yo I burn rubber
Can't stand criticism, give 'em extra jism
Been rockin for years, now I have wisdom
The way I'm kickin the lines you can hear my tongue twist
And it'll have your neck spinnin like you're spineless
I'm pickin 'em up, throwin 'em down
Hypin 'em up and slowin 'em down
All of these words with only one tongue
Shakin 'em up and then bakin 'em up
Smash boom bash scrapin 'em up
Now you thought that was hard, I just begun
Cause I'm a roll on the microphone
And take control just like Al Capone
I'm notorious, you're foolish if you sleep on me
Cause I'm too slick to let a rapper get sweet on me
Try to make a move for my heavyweight belt
You get played like the Wizard of Oz witch, you melt
Yo I'm crazy dope, with super hype lines
And a lot of hype lines make one dope rhyme
Why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you why do you think they call it dope?
Cause that's what it is
Why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you think they call it dope?

LL Cool J - NCIS (No Crew Is Superior),UnKnown,UnKnown,"The bags under my eyes have my family stressed
My minds full of drama
Each thoughts a screen test
I'm the challenger
Dodgin' in my kevlar vest
Sig Sauer in my lapse
It's the angel of death
Heard you were prayin for my downfall
Cigar on your desk
But this is war
It doesn't matter who's right
It's who's left
I have simple tastes
I'm only satisfied with the best
And Oscar said it best
Nothing succeeds like excess
So I do foolish things
With the noblest motives
Play golf in the sand trap
Filled with explosives
That's music to my ears
But to you it's corrosive
Like tryin to be patient
When you're really impulsive
The fat lady sung
I interrupted the song
Aimed my silencer at those who were singin along
Got creative
Get the hardrive
Find me a break as
Hard as exoskeleton titanium plates
I want it when I want it
Why would I wanna wait
I push the envelope
There's no seal on my fate
Dreams don't have deadlines
It's never to late
Even a broken clocks right
Twice a day and straight
Teamwork makes the dream work
While your awake
I stay under the radar
On my way outta space
When you stand firm
Be sure your feet are in the right place
Forgive your enemies
But take advantage of their mistakes
They watchin
They plottin
They be prayin for my downfall
I'm still
Risin
To the top and

The only easy day was yesterday
Remember the party
That isn't pain
That's weakness leavin' ya body
Adapt or perish
You'll either lead or be elite
And if I'm in a fair fight
I didn't plan it properly
Every promise made comes with a price tag G
And a mouse traps the only place where lunch is free
So overweight
Your bodies buried
I will lose it in sleep
Cause when doin what's necessary
Not many succeed
I swear I coulda been a engineer at Lockheed and Martin
But I was rockin' the garden
When math class was startin
I may come off like a gangster
But I'm beggin ya pardon
Ya see I never liked cuffs
They make ya lifestyle rotten
All I wanted
Was to be what I became
A rocketman
See my atmosphere was full of game
Im something like Muhammed in his prime
I'm snuffin my enemies at the primetime
They watchin
They plottin
They be prayin for my downfall

You don't appreciate how right it is til it's wrong
If love is blind then you better put some glasses on
I'm not young enough to know everything
But in the land of the blind
A man with one eye is king
And the question that I really want answered is this
Why is seekin revenge so hard for me to resist?
I know it's better to be feared than it is to be loved
And if your thoughts are your fists
Than your actions are gloves
I ain't no shakespeare
And I'm far from a poet
I don't wanna preserve the status quo
I wanna overthrow it
Know they're plannin my downfall to take them wages
But to do anything great you gotta face some danger
See how I blend with the background
The perfect stranger
I didn't do this alone
I'm not the lone ranger
You can feel it in your spirit
Deep down in your chest
There is no escapin

Uhh, uhh, and you don't stop (here go another one)
(Feel me baby, it's on)
Uhh, I was launched off the block, straight to the top
To yachts with helicopters, I'm so hot
Paparazzi, blinded by the rocks
My limousine roll up, the whole world shocked cause
You steppin out with an entrepeneur
I copped you more than what you bargained for
Roll the red carpet, enjoy the profits
First, let's make love in the walk-in closet
Daddy just made a nine digit deposit
Believe me sweetie, it's not luck it's logic
I'm the captain of my destiny
Used to dream of the things I was blessed to see
The jewels and the papers, sports cars and such
There's nothing in the world LL can't touch
You stood by my side and pushed me so much
That's why you got them 10 karats, you know what?

It's so amazing, amazing, amazing
Life's given my baby, my baby, my baby
Maybe some day you'll feel, how I feel, it's crazy
To see my baby.. is so amazing
 Sing it baby

I've got riches wall to wall
Up the stairs and, down the hall of
All the things that we have done
You got more ideas for us to
Live our lives.. and explore..
There is no topping you, you're untoppable


So what you sayin? Uh-huh
Hehehe, I appreciate it

It's so amazing, your love, to me
It's so amazing, amazing, to me
It's so amazing, your love, to me
It's so amazing, amazing, to me
It's alright..
Sometimes you work late at night (I know baby)
(I miss you too)
Just as long, as you don't defy my love
Then it's on (I promise you baby)
(I'll always love you)

Uh, uh, slide out to Venice, my game's in order
Would chip in to vent, but the city's on water
Searchlights and fireworks bling the sky
A vowel on the end of everything we buy
Yellow ice in both ears, I loosen up the tie
I'm lovin this lifestyle, baby I can't lie
It feels so good it make a grown man cry
Cause I made it out the hood and a lot of my crew died
I guess I had determination
And baby girl kept me in the congregation
Now it's private jets and deep conversation
Hundred G's a month to show appreciation
All eyes on us, the cameras flash
In God We Trust, I don't love this cash
But you was definitely - by my side when my world collapsed
Now I'm, rich for life and I'm payin you back
{*Amerie ad libs*}


This is like this for life baby
This gon' always be like this
God is my witness
Hold you tight for the rest of my life

"Smokin’, Dopin’",Walking with a Panther,1989.0,"Yeah
Smokin', dopin', keep your ears open
Put me on the flier and I'm guaranteed to rope in
Twenty-thousand people to the place that I play at
And have em even sayin', ""How could someone say that?
They're as good as the man who just saw
{*scratched ""Cool J""*}
 Please give me some more
Of those hoopin', scoopin', rhymes you be troopin'""
If you don't know the new dance, Patty Duke 'n
Clap your hands, stomp your feet, snap your fingers
I'm snatchin' airplay 
from all you AIDS catchin' singers
It's a special delivery on your front step
My picture's on the cover and the rhymes are in effect
Cause, I love to lay down joints for the playground
And have you O.D.ing saying, ""Y'know, J sound righteous
The brother did what he had to""
I didn't talk about this, so I had you
Sleepin', breathin' sayin', ""Yo, he ain't keepin'
His promise to astonish, from weekend to weekend""
But here it is, the jam of all jams
And from this day forth, MC's are gettin' slammed
With the

Uhh, aww yeah, uhh - ahh
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh - ahh
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh - ahh
Uhh, aww yeah!

I'm the wise wizard of the microphone swinging it
Here's a mean joint, all the hip-hoppers are singing it
Doin a dance in tight bike pants
So get up on it (HO!) you'll only get one chance
To work out the soreness in your muscles
Do your own thing, even the hustle
MC's I'ma torture, that's already known
But while I'm torturing them, I'ma leave you alone
So you can bump, grind, and rub up against your partner
And look wild like you're trying to get a part in a
Dirty movie on the hip-hop tip
Now tell me (tell you what?) that brother L ain't trying to flip
With the

Uhh, aww yeah, uhh - ahh
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh - ahh
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh - ahh
Uhh, aww yeah!

Movin, groovin', admit that you've been
Shocked and rocked and I'm on top and it's been proven
I'm self-reliant, on stage I'm defiant
All those rumors are small things to a giant
I'm not a cool, calm, collected type of brother
I'm kind of hype that's why I'm a good lover
In bed I'm energetic, kind of like a freight train
Going so crazy I have the girlies saying, ""Wait James!""
I do damage - use the beef to build a sandwich
And when I'm done, she'll be saying, ""How did you manage
To make me feel pleasure from my toes to my head?
On top of that, you ran laps around the bed""
So bust out the pumped up funk that I'm revealing
And listen to it, while you're in your car wheeling
Or on your Walkman as you're starin' at the ceiling
Or when you and your love is sex-appealing
To the

Uhh, aww yeah, uhh - ahh
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh - ahh
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh - ahh
Uhh, aww yeah!

It's like a smooth joint, you know what I mean?
Real mellow, on the love tip, check it out

When Def Jam signed me
They hit the lottery
It wasn't free but don't call it a robbery
They underestimated me quite possibly
It's like that when you a godfather B
I'm the greatest of all time
You heard that before
But now when I say it
It means so much more
'Cause It's so true
No hype man, No crew
No reason for ghost writers
Every year I get tighter
Mothers and daughters agree I'm on fire
Check ya T-Mobile it's all over the wire
Cross ya legs baby hide ya desire
You think I'm hot
You preaching to the choir
Smiling and giggling
Thirsting like Gilligan
More flavor than cinnamon
They rush with adrenaline
I make 'em nervous
I do it on purpose
I come back hotter
Every time I resurface
Drop to ya knees baby
Praise the king
Now ask Russell Simmons
Who built the west wing
I ain't gotta be cocky
I do the damn thing
Paint ya girl with strawberry frosting
Internationally known and respected
You talk slick I'm too large to be affected
You crank call my cells disconnected
You keep slipping but my games perfected

Hollywood love me in the streets I'm gravy
Born with a gift to inspire the hood
You wanna out do me and I wish you would
I'm the master separate from all these cats
I'm laughin in '86 I balled like that
Honey catching feeling from sittin in Maybachs
Cause her project hall is smelling like Ajax
That's understandable but everybody relax
Hate when folk get money and don't know how to act
I'm a multi millionaire homey that's a fact
But it's not the ice that makes ya wife react
Been had an entourage and platinum cards
Been getting swedish massage in Boca Raton
What you think all them years I ain't pop no Don
Spend a night in Trump Towers with a blue eyed blonde
I been did it all my Benzes was kitted
When you talk like a baller you tickle me with it
But yeah there's money out there come on lets get it
But I'm a get it in such a way you never forget it
Let's go twenty platinum albums in a row
Sixty thousand fans a three hour show

When security clear out the V.I.P
If honey wanna lounge we gone see ID
Ain't no negotiating you gone pay my fee
I'm the boss I call the shots to keep it hot
I don't have competition I'm bigger than the slot
While you waste advances on grey market rocks
I cop municipal bonds and Wal Mart stocks
A family man but hard as a rock
And I die for my kids so stay off my block
They might be impressed with you but I'm not
After all these years I still walk with a bop
Still keep the ink hot
Still scheme like a fox
Still ready to battle
You don't want your career stopped
Industry shocked cause I mapped out a plot
And ran around humble with my joint on cock

We’re The Greatest,Authentic,2013.0,"Never jealous cause once we're gone
Never leave here til it's done
Be really the greatest of all
Do it well but not enough

Oh oh oh, mama we made it, aye
Oh oh oh, we're finally the greatest of the world
Oh oh oh, I told you we'd make it
Oh oh oh, we're finally the greatest of the world

Knock knock – who's there?
The one, remember me?
I'm lookin kinda different these days, don't you agree?
Your boy's going big these days, didn't even see?
The hell with the devil, there's no sympathy
The wishes in my past are still ridin me
All I can do is laugh as they lie to me
You can't take my God from inside of me
Crosses up, light up the sky with me
I got a lot of crazy crazy on my mind
Like what's the real reason that the pope resigned?
I got Van Halen, I don't need a bassline
I knew we can do it, it was just a matter of time
Put the axels back on the street and break on the vine
I came back to take back everything that was mine
If I live to be 1-0-9 I'm still in my prime
If I don't then I don't, I'll live on in your mind


I'm on a hacksaw tour, Eddie got a Frankenstein aimed at your door
Speakers under the stage, lift you off of the floor
Why? This music is the end to the war
We endure, cameras everywhere, everyone is keeping score
Everybody talkin bout what's up bout the tour
The world is a steak, I'm a chew it up raw
We're back in heavy metal like we above the law
London, Japan, Germany and France
Lisbon to New York, we're live up in Netherlands
Jump up on some shoulders baby, you never dance
You only live once, come on, here's your chance
You could be reborn, half star, half man
If you rise up and grab my hand
If I live to be 1-0-9 I'm still in my prime
If I don't then I don't, I'll live on in your mind

Still can't believe you're my property
The sound of you ploppin on top of me
The feelin of, hittin the lottery
Or passin ""Go"" twice in Mono-poly
Doesn't, dare to compare to what you got for me
The taste of the puddin is so chocolatey
Hope to seein it, so I'm seein it
Still got my sneakers and my chain on lean in it
Moonlight hit it right it start gleamin
Mean faces, for what was the meanin?
Pop it a little bit and, drop it a little bit
It's, hard to read you I feel like I'm illiterate
But I'm ready for the graduation
Yeah, right there, repeat that rotation

Give me all you got baby tonight (tonight)
Now's the perfect time; come blow my mind
It's cold out here please let me come inside (let me come inside)
Oooh so warm at night; you blow my mind - hey yeahhh

Yeah baby go ahead and talk greasy
Tell me how you never had it this deeply
I'mma whisper slick, you respond sweetly
Extra freaky, I trick and you treat me
I'll give, you take, but don't hesitate
When you feel it girl, throw it right back
Just let me hold ya by your shoulders
Damn, you can take it like that?
I knew you was a champ girl
You got your leg on the dresser kickin the lamp girl
Run the shower let's head in the bathroom girl
Cause the temperature's hotter than high noon girl
I crack that do', let the steam blow
Ain't nobody here but me and you, let it go
You never had it this good, you already know
Give me all you got tonight, really though

 Take it to the bridge

You're the sexiest woman I've ever known
Baby my mind is blown
It's simply beautiful, how you do it to me (OW!)
You're showin me things I'd never do
A whole 'nother side of you (side of you)
Just keep doin what you do, it feels like ooh wee!

You can go and have the wild climax
Ain't no way I'm 'bout to let you relax
Let me see if you can hold me on your back
Let me see you wind your body to the track
Pop it a little bit and, drop it a little bit

Radio killer
Yeh
Y'all think they can handle this one man
Alright
Call the radio and tell 'em this your song (this your song, this your song, this your song, this your song)
Girl come on (girl come on, girl come on,)
Cuz I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby
Im your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby
Met this little girl, she was off the hook
I got cold chills when her body shook
Hot sex on the platter no need to cook
I let her steal my heart like a horny crook
Had her grinding and winding against my leg
She messin with my head, wanna play in the bed
Sexy pumps on, toenails red
Your body's a gun baby, pump me full of lead
It hard to hold you when you movin' vulgar
Peace sign on your eyes like John Travolta
My pulp ain't fiction, it's an addiction
To see your booty clap on the floor in the kitchen
Nasty girl, taught me all the lingo
While mama play bingo, she ride mandingo
She don't give a damn if I'm married or single
She makes me tingle
Shawty im your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby
She likes Hip-Hop and R&B
Her life time goal is to be on TV
She looking for a man that could give her a break
Like Usher or Justin Timberlake
I'm really not sure if her breasts are fake
Cuz wit whipped cream on em, they taste just like cake
We drink some beer, inside of daddy's '64
She shot me in the back with cupids arrow
We finish the 6-pac, she push the seat back
Pulled up her dress n she let me peep that
I'm Drunk as a skunk, feeling all dirty
Truck stop bathroom at 7:30
Bought her some dessert, give a damn if its early
Head spinnin around like roller derby
Everything about her says you don't deserve me
I hope I'm worthy
Cuz shawty I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby
(Cuz im your baby)
You need somethin' like me? (Good luck)
Cuz he ain't nothin' like me (no)
You can search but you never gone find
A love thats quite like mine (no)
Need a man that can love you good
And treat you like he should
With me shawty you the shit
He might be good but he ain't like this
Cuz im your baby
In the back of the pickup, clothes the rip up
She see my chrome wheels, it gets more real
Running and laughing, music blasting
Side over the road, bent over crashing
Mouth all dry, can feel the urge
If you see my mama, don't say a word
The cops wanna know im a word are slurred
Don't ask me officer ask her
Wanna another drink baby she like sure
Wanna hit the club she like I don't curr
She all in the rearview doin her hurr
Hairspray and lip gloss everywhurr
This all happens on an average day
Your life is a trip girl, I'm here to stay
Never had a girl make me feel this way
Even tho I had to pay
Cuz shawty I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby

Six figure interest on the cheddar
From music, fashion, film and televison
Poppin amaretto, so what'chu got a vendetta?
I never felt better

I'm a champ, you a peon
Kiss the ring, begone

And be on, stand there, get your md on

Waited three years to see if L still had it

I Make My Own Rules,Private Parts: The Album,1997.0,"You know the rules of the game, baby
We can handle this like gentlemen
Or we can get into some gangsta shit
This is big time rock'n'roll, baby
Nobody can tell me what to do!
I'm the rebel, with a cause, breakin the curfew
An international threat to the power structure
Scream when your eardrums rupture
Anarchy, primal terror!
My God!.. It's a brand new era!
The world revolves on an economic axis
And if it slips, everybody drips
Black and white in a fight for green
While the yellow and red get caught between
Wannabe gangstas livin a lie
Gettin rich while they glorify genocide
Homicide, suicide, politicians tounge-tied
Westside, Eastside
What's the difference? If you ride, you ride
If you live, you live but if you die, you die
And I...
(Back on up!) I make my own rules!
(Back on up!) I'm my own man, I make my own rules!

Uh! Gimme mine, give it up
Give it back, I can't let it slide like that (Nah!)
Everybody want a free ride
And most of my fake-ass friends got snake eyes
Ready for a fight to the death
Protect the innocent, 'til it ain't none left
Homeboy - guilty, homegirl - guilty
Who are you to play judge and jury?
Filled with fury, the wrath of a tyrant
Who's to blame when the young get violent? (Uh!)
When the Glock cocks, it pops, many drop
And if his momma get him help, will he stop?
Dangerous, walkin' on the edge
No aim to us, stop blamin' us!
For the rules that you made, games that you played
Seems you got it made, why are you so afraid?!

Generation X, live and direct
The Constitution, execution
Emancipation, annihilation
Inferior rights for all stereotypes

One Shot at Love,Walking with a Panther,1989.0,"One shot
Oh lord
You know, it's gonna be a lot of negative things surroundin you
Tryin to pull you down
But what you have to remember is
It's up to you - it's your choice
You only get one shot in life
And you only get one shot at love
Did you ever notice - everytime you fall in love
And it seems like you finally met the perfect match
Everything is perfect, it seems divine
But for some strange reason, there's always a catch
It's a one-way relationship, it hurts inside
One person smirks while the other one cries
Butterflies in the stomach of the one whose in love
It cuts like a knife, the truth mixed with lies
One shot (one shot at love..)
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..)
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..)
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..)
That's all you get
Physical and mental, those are two different loves
Physical's a moment, mental is forever
If the physical fades and gets weak, all of a sudden
Remember, it's the mental love that keeps you together
You gotta be strong and endure the hard times
Cause af-ter hard times, good times, always follow
And when you're kissin and huggin and makin love
Treat that person like there's no tomorrow
One shot (one shot at love..)
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..)
That's all you get baby; one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..)
One shot at love, one.. shot.. (one shot at love..)
That's all you get {*sniff*}
Jealousy - don't let it interfere
Don't let it come in between
The love you two share, cause jealousy's a hateful God
So merciless and mean
And it's only job in life, is to ruin relationships
And pit two people against, one another
And because of this God, the one you love so much
Will no longer be your lover
One shot (one shot at love..)
Aww baby, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..)
That's all we get, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..)
I mean this baby, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..)
That's all..
I hope you understand what I just said
All I'm sayin is that you only get one shot at love in life
And you have to hold on to that shot, take advantage of it
Cause when you lose it, it's gonna hurt real bad
Take it from me
You only get one shot, and I mean that
One shot
You only get you only get you only get one (2X)
One shot at love..
You only get you only get you only get one (2X)
One shot at love..
You only get you only get you only get one (2X)
One shot at love..

Oooh baby, I love you so (I know)

I'm gon' be, your lollipop

Lolli-lolli-pop-pop, boppin down the block-block
I've been lovin you since junior high, ma you got
Everything I need, everything I want
You're the type of dime a real player wanna flaunt
Lovin them lips and the shape of them hips
When I see you in that whack brother's whip, I FLIP
I hate your boyfriend, that cat is corny
I kick it to you and I dare that clown to run up on me
When nights are stormy I be thinkin about your pretty smile, gritty style
But duke got you locked down like Riker's Isle
I wanna break your man off, I can't control it, I'm a hater
Especially, when your perfume lingers inside the elevator
You're the one, the only one
That I would beg, to give me some
Playerism's for life, eternal flossin, proceed with caution
Baby toss him, divorce him, let the boss in

So ballalistic, mystic, twisted
In my dreams I kissed it, never missed it, I frisked it
Searched it, worked it, lollipopped it and jerked it
You followed, swallowed, scratch my back, baby burped it
Red Passion, high fashion
Nobody got to know I'm smashin, I'm sayin shorty
Rock, Miss Thang, playin childish games
Standin on the corner knowin damn well I wanna blaze
Sweet get to it anywhere you like
On the rooftop, at midnight
The project stairs, I'll be there
Runnin my fingers through your hair
Anyway, the untouchable, magnetic
Kissable loveable huggable energetic, call a medic
Your man'll regret it, when I hit it I'm athletic
Energize your thighs you'll recognize the size
It's epidemic..

When y'all alone in the Brooklyn brownstone
Starin at the high ceiling, what a feeling
Clothes peeling, finally you're double dealing
I'm walkin, he's wheeling, it's unreal when
You got the dime of your fantasies
My lollipop ecstasy's on top of me
Just like I thought, it's a small world after all
I don't care if your neighbors hear us down the hall
Make 'em jealous, what they gon' tell us?
If you don't tell your girls baby, I won't tell the fellas
If you don't plea, I orchestrated icebergisms
Visions of my lollipop's thick risen, for my wisdom
Plop plop fizzdom, what I give them
Make - yea baby, right there - my new anthem
I love you baby, take it deep deep deep
Deep deep deep, now go to sleep

Stand By Your Man,14 Shots to the Dome,1993.0,"Yeah this one goes out to all the ladies in the house
(""For alla y'all"")

I need you to stand by me when the chips are down and
Stick around while I defend my crown and
No sellout, the trip is too rough and
Although your skin is soft, I need your mind to be tough
And I might seem rough but life is much rougher
To see success sometimes you gotta suffer
I need a woman that's stronger than material needs
And isn't motivated by greed
Dry my tear-drops and feelin' my pain and
Watchin' my back while I strive to maintain and
Makin' love like a medicine doctor
I knew that she was bad from the day that I clocked her

Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your man

My enemies come and my fake friends talk but
You recognize game, roll your eyes and walkin'
Baby ain't no way I'll let the vultures attack you
So I'll teach you the game and tell you how to react to
The conversation, sexy vibration
Visual stimulation, slick persuasion
Times is hard, I need a woman that rolls with God
And the only man she loves is Todd
But will you be around when the raindrops fallin'
Or could it be you never loved me at all and
I need a trooper, a soldier, a agent
I need someone who can roll with my arrangement
The reproducer factor and
The Queen of the Universe, not an actor and
Standin' by her man 'til the end
Not only as a lover but a friend

Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby (yeah)
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your man

Then, when things get better
We can look back at the whole aerators
Remember the times when they said I couldn't do it
But I was rougher than rough and baby you knew it and
You held back when your Love Jones called in
You had faith when they said that I'd fall and
You understood that what we had was good
You stood by your man like a real queen should
That's why now I got you livin' your dream as
A beautiful wisdom, a part of my team and
As long as I live on this earth
Anything you want is what your loyalty's worth

Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby
(I wanna send this one out to all the ladies in the house)
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your man
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby (stand by your man, word)
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your man (peace)
You got to stand by your baby
You got to stand by your man
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby

Three quarter black mink; shades, canaries in both ears
Knahmsayin?  Black Phantom, triple black, with the oak wood
Gucci shoes, that's how I play

Hold up, I don't gamble, I don't play no craps
I was taught early on don't jeapordize the stacks
Before I open my mouth, I get all the facts
I could never fall off, it's too many hot tracks
I'm affiliated with too many hot cats
To end up, crawlin out of a hole in Iraq
Try to topple my regime
You end up in need of a scalpel to your spleen
Is there a medic on the scene?
Easy children, Queens is in the buildin
That blank look on your grill'll get filled in
Slow down baby, you actin like a clown homes
You get your fronts remodeled like a brownstone
You hear my heat rock comin through your sheetrock
It means you're OD'n homeboy, here come the detox
I get my swagger on, proud as a peacock
Bars is hot, beats is pumpin like a {*edit*} box

Shake it baby shake it
If you a real O.G. put your hands in the air with me, c'mon
Shake it baby shake it
Young ladies in the spot, if you came up in the place to rock, c'mon
Shake it baby shake it
Divided we fall, stay together and forever we ball, c'mon
Shake it baby shake it
You do it for the gangsters
I do it for the ladies, but it's all money baby

They pay me so much it's hard for them to swallow
When you got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds follow
Pay yourself first, that's one of my main mottos
Picture Bill Gates on the block dodgin hollows
I can't see it player that's beneath my vision
I'm beyond focused, every decision is made with precision
It seems like greed's the world religion
But L want cake, save the crumbs for the pidgeons
Black man, get the flies outcha eyes
You can't cause where you born but you affect where you die
Until that day, health and welfare, cheers
And after my wake, the hood'll talk, man listen here
He kept a mink and canaries in his ears
Like the Enterprise rollin over stars for years
Spit bars for years, kept hot cars for years
The dice was loaded but he beat the odds for years, uh-huh!


To be or not to be the man, that's the question
Got a vision in my mind, I can see that I'm destined
To lean up in the backseat, givin directions
Sweep the block clean as November elections
On the Blackberry readin cash flow quadrant
Brim to the side, my gorillas is bonded
CLS Vision, four Hummers behind it
You forgot I'm from Queens?  You can get reminded
I'm a man's man, when you chumps gon' learn
If you play with fire you get poured in a urn
You must have been puffin on blunts of sherm
All my albums is platinum, it's been confirmed
I'm more than a symbol of sex, I get respect
For livin in the hills but still keepin it mad real
Stay on course, the boss crush obstacles
You burnin me, two words: im-possible


Like I said
Yellow canary tennis on the neck
Three quarter black mink
Gucci hat to the side, shades
Gucci shoes, baggy jeans
Black Phantom, oak wood

Lay back on this one (yeah, you know how I do baby)

You only a customer
When you walkin' in the presence of hust-lers
Uhh, I'm laid back in the cinnamon Range
Two decades and ain't a damn thing changed
Keep my girl, in strawberry swirls
You can taste it, my instict's basic
Lord have mercy, sweet like Hershey
Kisses, diamonds for the misses, ices on the wrist-es
All different colors of the spectrum
The smallest flaw and I reject 'em
Believe me I'm a conniseur when I inspect 'em
I baguettes them, invisibly sets them
They call me big L-ly Wonka from Compton to Yonkers
Them Chi-Town steppers and them A-Town stompers
These young rookies, fail to understand
Every summer I return like the ice cream man
Drop what you doin, get-it get-it while you can
By the eighth, by the ounce, when it's gone I'ma bounce
It's the F-L-A-V, no if's or maybe's
You know what I do, drive your tastebuds crazy

Like lemondrops with chocolate kisses
Every bite is more delicious

Like caramel on vanilla sundae
Have a scoop you'll want some day
'Cause you're my favorite flavor

Smooth but hard like woodgrain on the wheel
Recline your seat baby, enjoy how it feel
Why you crossin' your legs, them high heels of eel?
Kick off your shoes, run your toes on the dash
Now peel off your stockings, c'mon let's get it poppin'
I'm in the mood for cotton, candy and I'm plottin'
To see you in somethin' silky and see-through
Me too! Man you know how we do
Camcorder main feature, damn a preview
I love how the bottom on your body's EQ
Low but thick though like the base in a six-fo'
So here we go (here we go) we bunny hoppin'
I hit the switches baby, you keep it droppin'
It feels marvelous, you in charge of this
I hope you ain't heartless but my guard's down regardless

Like lemondrops with chocolate kisses
Every bite is more delicious
My favorite flavor
(Mix me and you and we can't go wrong)
Like caramel on vanilla sundae
Have a scoop you'll want some day
'Cause you're my favorite flavor
(C'mon, baby baby c'mon) c'mon

(Uhh) All I wanna do
Is eat you up 'cause you look so good
(Think I look alright huh?)
(I look better on you, what'chu really wanna do?)
All I wanna do
Is show you boy that I taste good too
(I know you taste good ma)
(What'chu sayin', want a sprinkle of the hood ha? Ha?)

We had it out
Now tell your girls the truth when they ask what I'm about
The cookies and the cream and the peaches 'n praline
Butter pecan themes in your daydreams
All real sugar, no sacca-rhine
Low calorie, leave no cavities
Guaranteed no place you'd rather be
Than here with me, mix chocolate in the factory

Like lemondrops with chocolate kisses
Every bite is more delicious
My favorite flavor
(Mix me and you and we can't go wrong)
Like caramel on vanilla sundae
Have a scoop you'll want some day
'Cause you're my favorite flavor
(C'mon, baby baby c'mon) c'mon

Can’t Think,G.O.A.T. (Greatest of All Time),2000.0,"You ever get to the point where you so frustrated
You ready to give up?
You ready to end it all?
Don't do it dog, word up
I don't care if you black, white, Latin, Asian, whatever
We all go through pain
When you can't think, use your soul baby

Preliminary discussions is over with, the verdict is in
I took the rap throne back
I reigned like krills in '87, my name is on the map
It feels like a razor down the middle of my back
They slept on my lyrical ability to blow
Gave another nigga credit for inventing my flow
I'm a child of God, witness the rising son
From the cradle to the grave, I remain number one
This thing of ours, got competition taking red showers
Grieving mothers calling 1-800-Flowers
My repertoire burn your ashes in the urn
Is it God or money that really make the world turn?
Grab your gun, separate the ones from the real funds
Inhale deep and hold it in your lungs
The streets was requesting some original LL
A soundtrack for niggas that was raised in {hell}
They looking for a leader that can guide 'em through the maze
Smoke filled rooms, breathing in purple haze
Po' nigga's on the bricks his whole life
He ain't got nothin' to live for, so fucking living right
But if you stay in the rain like hurricane
Gold melts down but it don't fear flames
Toxic, lethal, psychologically evil
Genocide was committed on the black people
And the ghetto is a trap with glass walls
Should I sell drugs, be a rap thug, or play ball?
We end up in the grave anyway
The average cat and LL Cool J
It's a never-ending cycle, life and death
Until then may my mic stay blessed, to the death

I can't think, why do I feel I'm losing my mind?
I can't think, could it be the ill beats and rhymes?
I can't think, even though I'm a one of a kind
I can't think, I want the paper, that's just the bottom line
I can't think, mo' murder every day around the way
I can't think, I'd rather get paid and parlay
I can't think, it's all about survival God
You know the epilogue by James Todd

Put your life on the line, you running out of time
The coroner's calling, she know she on a nigga mind
Amongst the dogs, real cats is hard to find
Even a nigga moms hate it when he start to shine
Get the money and run, dodge the devil and his sons
Spit powerful parables like a sermon has begun
Fuck the turntables up, leave the DJ awestruck
Attitude is what, keep the razor blade tucked
Too much flossing'll get your reputation touched
Too much rapping'll get your big mouth shut
Protect your neck nigga, you'll get it in the gut
You wearing a vest? What if you get your throat cut
Sold your soul for a dollar, now you having bad luck
Used to keep a bad bitch in the crib baggin' up
Player here, player there, nigga turned you out
But never told you beware
Never told you that black love supposed to be shared
And you never judge a woman by the texture of her hair
Fancy cars and gold teeth, G-strings and things
The almighty dollar replace the wedding ring
The Ark of the Covenant was held by a king
I ain't trading my soul in for skins and chrome rims

I can't think, why do I feel I'm losing my mind?
I can't think, could it be the ill beats and rhymes?
I can't think, even though I'm a one of a kind
I can't think, I want the paper, that's just the bottom line
I can't think, mo' murder every day around the way
I can't think, I'd rather get paid and parlay
I can't think, it's all about survival God
You know the epilogue by James Todd

Think about it yo, think about it
Think about it yo, think about it
Think about it yo, think about it
Think about it yo, think about it!

The dawn, of a new millennium, came to pass
The world revolves around sex or cash
The black man's motto, ""Kiss my ass!""
Shorties in kindergarten are strapped, ready to blast
All I ever seen was killers and dope fiends
From FEDS Magazine to the heart of killer Queens
Bronx and Brooklyn and everything up in between
No matter what, you always got a Judas on your team
Giving it to the world and I'm telling it like it is
Tossing lyrical daggers and sending 'em in your wig
Know where the body's buried, I ain't saying where it is
Raised inside the ghetto, but dammit I wanna live
The legendary master of lyrical combat
But ain't no competition, ain't nobody to go at
So I'ma take the time and spit a universal verse
Hit the streets with a blessing and erase the curse

I can't think, why do I feel I'm losing my mind?
I can't think, could it be the ill beats and rhymes?
I can't think, even though I'm a one of a kind
I can't think, I want the paper, that's just the bottom line

I’m About to Get Her,The DEFinition,2004.0," (R. Kelly)
Woo, and you say New York City, ah uh
Back by popular demand (ah yayaya yaya yaya)
You been waitin' in the baby for so long baby
We had 'em starvin', ay yo E, the big homey

Star studded, my ear lobes is flooded
DJ's wanna rub it, bootleggers wanna dub it
Easy does it, ladies love it, cats with big budgets
BB Jay, two jets and Tar Smith luggage
Clowns talkin' rubbish and pretending they thuggish
But I'm a young living legend like Pee Wee at the ruckus
I was raised out of Queens but rap kept me off it
Cover of Feds Magazine, put me in the Gulf stream
Ya man done it, push the E-X one hundred
And you don't want it, I got the whole rap game cornered
Watch me flaunt it, damn right I'm iconic
Soon as next find a icey track, I slide on it

I know there's gotta be a fine honey with her hands up in this club for me
I'm about to get her
And I know there's gotta be some kinda chick up off in here that's got the hots for me
I'm about to get her
See I know there's gotta be one sexy little freak that wanna leave with me
I'm about to get her
I know it's gotta be a girl that wants to come to V.I.P. and drink with me
I'm about to get her

The beach front estate, mega yacht by the lake
The safe in the floor with a lifetime of cake
Wifey email and make my side vibrate
Cats still can't believe I'm hot, I got 'em irate
The hip-hop boss of the empire state
Cats never front on me, they know I drive weight
It's the best that ever did it, they call me Cool J
Been platinum so long, my skin's turning grey
Ok, they don't know how to act
And my BDS was miles ago to Cali and back
Minimum, private jets in the millennium
Plenty of Benjamins, hot ladies and gentlemen

I know there's gotta be a fine honey with her hands up in this club for me
I'm about to get her
And I know there's gotta be some kinda chick up off in here that's got the hots for me
I'm about to get her
See I know there's gotta be one sexy little freak that wanna leave with me
I'm about to get her
I know it's gotta be a girl that wants to come to V.I.P. and drink with me

Girls, they girls, they got much body
Girls, they girls, they showin' bellies
You're the girl in my fantasy

Girls, they girls, they girls, so sexy
Girls, they girls, they got much body
Girls, they girls, they showin' bellies
You're the girl in my fantasy

I know that it's ridiculous for y'all to picture this
The way I keep rein' up, servin' and flippin' this
Dot the I's, cross the T's, meticulous
The coldest Winter ever and I'm so icicle-ish
The movement is flavor, full bags of licorice
The drop, the rock, the watch, the necklace
There's no forgettin' this, the way I'm reppin' this
My bodyguard's big but do that make me rebellish
I'm in the Hamptons, game stronger than Sampson
That's why I'm still a teen pop idol like Hanson
Young, black and handsome, movin' with the cheddar
Bring honey to the V.I.P., I'm about to get her, let's go

I know there's gotta be a fine honey with her hands up in this club for me
I'm about to get her
And I know there's gotta be some kinda chick up off in here that's got the hots for me

American Girl,Exit 13,2008.0,"March... {*4X*}
Boomdizzle baby
Way back in 1776
Who would have thought we would have these chicks
Some kind of slim and some extra thick
They make me feel so patriotic
Man, American girls are somethin to see
I bet Thomas Jefferson would love BET
This is a celebration all across the land
Light the fireworks, bring out the marchin band
Uncle L, I love the heartland
South Carolina, they're lookin so tan
Out in Kansas, they're so outlandish
Up in Nebraska, I know what'cha after
Bubble baths and Budweiser, joy and laughter
A good ol' boy that's not tryin to gas ya
American girl, no doubt who the best are
I get harder faster than a car from NASCAR
Make Paul Revere wanna ride again
The red coats are comin, fuck it, let 'em in
The King of England woulda left us alone
If he saw Jessica Simpson eat an ice cream cone
Teeny bikini, red white and blue
A-merican girl, I salute you
From Massachusetts to Albuquerque
Back to the midwest, as sweet as dessert be

I see you out there dancin; looks like you need romancin
You're my American girl, A-merican girl
You know I wanna hold you; here's somethin you can roll to
You're my American girl, A-merican girl (march ladies!)
Left, left, left-right-left (march ladies!)
Right, right, right-left-right (march ladies!)
Left, left, left-right-left (march ladies!
Right, right, right-left-right (march ladies~!)

I'm so glad that French helped us out
Now you free to walk around and let your cleavage bounce
The Founding Fathers would've been hot and bothered
Watch boomdizzle, you know what I'm talkin about
From Philadelphia to Illinois
St. Louis, Alabama, country grammar
Queens, New York, Detroit to Montana
Today's your day girl, let's raise the banner
Benjamin Franklin, I so wanna thank him
Take a look at these girls, they the best in the world
Blonds and brunettes, redheads with curls
March with me girl and let your baton twirl
Champagne corks were burstin in the air
Gave prove through the night, my girls were still there
I'm a drum major, leadin you to the flavor
Go ahead and shake what'cha momma gave ya
Oh, oh, say can you see
By the dawn's early light
Par-ty with me every night
Let down your hands, alright
Whatever you do, don't lose this all fast
I'mma have to fly my flag at half mast
You go girl, you make me wanna holla
I'd take George off and put your boobs on the dollar


I'm the master of the ceremony go 'head yell
Put your hands in the air ring the Liberty Bell
I give you the John Hancock if you don't tell
Let's have the Boston Tea party, what the hell!
Celebrate the day Crispus Attucks fell
So we could use our parts and rock to LL
36 double D's never troubled me
Thank God that Columbus made that discovery
The Queen of Spain spent some change
Now Paris Hilton, is pushin the Range
Stars ride by while the chauffeurs drive
But all you girls with 9-to-5's dance with pride
This is the USA, great to be alive
Great watch the video with them big ol' thighs
Brown and blue, green and hazel eyes
All directed straight towards the prize
Any shape or size, all different types of vibes
Around the way girls, ready to ride
Farmer's daughter on the John Deere with pride
Conservative blue bloods, intelligent minds
With them Girls Next Door, they put me under a spell
I'm on top of the world, I'mma screamin to tell
I love the USA girls
Almost as much as when the Giants beat Green Bay, girl",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-american-girl-lyrics

You better check your broad her nips get hard when they play this
Just like a can of peaches in her draws whan I say this
I got the recipe I'll leave your bird marinatin
Now you want beef cause her onion just keep shakin
My six pack alone cause grief, cats hatin
But I'm still in the Oldsmobile sittin on Dayton's
Still keep the fiber optic trunk vibratin
Packed in the club like sardines the youg things is faintin
Fillin the dancefloor like a carpenter
That's why I keep greener thumbs than a gardener
Serious with my pimpin I'm a monster bruh
When I spit they kneel down like larsengers
Now mama after my show you wanna guzzle twurve oh in the Range Rove
Skins is like rims you gotta spin 'em on the low hit the big bumps slow
And most of the time they ain't worth the dough

Hey! You love it when it sounds like this
That's why the club crowded better find you a bitch
She heard my name and she shouted this is me and my fifth
And we both bout it bout it in a brand new six, with a smoke cloud around it
Near the square anywhere, no sneakers on the rug
And my system knockin, like the speakers in the club
Look ma, drop the lame and spend a weekend with a thug
I'll have you back at the cuzzi geekin of the bud
When I come through I come through sparklin
Six car garage in you in the apartment, and starvin
I walk and talk, like I was raised around macks
New York native, there's a razor in the hat
Smooth as Fillmore Slim with gators on the track
I hit 'em, quit 'em, and dish 'em off like that
I'm a bring her all of the jewelry cause I don't play the back
And give less to spray now or later on the lac

Splashin niggas I came slow through the block

Ten times platinum your career's lookin critical
Reach for this, motherfuck being a criminal
Look in your bitch eyes, the vibe is subliminal
You wanna freestyle fuck that
I need at least seven figures to even touch that
But since everybody was underestimatin my format
I dropped Ill Bomb and now niggas want more of that
Ain't a rapper dead or alive fuckin wit me
Ask the last bitch that tried to come and get me
Talk about paper, I can talk about broads
I can talk about movies, I can talk about awards
Fuck the fantasies, yo I got all four
And 2001'll be mine, by law
Why name me Greatest Of All Times?
Because for fifteen years I kept y'all standin in line
Lovin the way I shine and my lyrics combine
With the ruggedest, illest beats that Def Jam can find
Fuck them other niggas with their 9 or 10 hits
My hits run deep as the emotions of your bitch
Back in the days it was the M fast stick
But now the Bentley is all get more whores on the dick
This ones for  and my Riker's Island niggas
That remember when I came through

You're the honey that I see when I'm ridin by
The one givin me a feeling that I can't deny
You got the Prada boots on, suede hittin your thigh
Actin like my chrome twenties ain't catchin' your eye
Sometimes I slow down, catch the ass in the mirror
Turn the fog lights on, to see the legs more clearer
You turn me on, keep me standin up
I wish that I could prove to you that I'm man enough
I come up to your job and handcuff your boss
Throw that nigga in the closet and turn the lights off
Then sit you up on the copy machine
Make copies of your kitten with my chin in between
Then I take you to the window so the world can see
Baby I'm down on my knees, let your world be free
Curl tongue come get up on this desk with me
Multiple orgasms is your destiny

Yo, I'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide
Imagine That
It ain't my fault that my broads collide
Imagine That
Knock your girls off two at a time
Imagine That
Disrespect you and still make you mine

Fuck these record labels til the legend's gettin paid
The war zone, I'ma pierce to your bone

If you could match a third of my success you blessed

Let me bust my milk on your back, watch you start illing

Funky! Uh

Yo, let me tell you bout a girl named Peg
A D.C. haircut and stewardess legs
Dressed to kill, her physique is ill
Her face belongs on a dollar bill
Her boyfriend's down with the M-O-B
Drivin around in a 300e
Trunk jewelry and all that
Talkin bout, ""My man can't fall, black!""
Sippin on cham', diamonds on her hand
Takin cash, carryin drugs for her man
Drivin around in a kitted up Jetta
Under the seat a automatic beretta
You know, the whole blasé blah of rap
Tellin brothers they need to get off the brastrap
That's the type of girl she is
Word to Miz, she got the
Full length blue fox, knock you out the box
Big rocks, this girl is hype, pops
The type of girl that cold did son wrong
She got the face that you wanna spend money on
Her man be smackin her up
Yeah, backin her up to the wall
""Get undressed, where you goin?
You ain't playin me out with that hoein
Look in the mirror, check the jewels
Silly rabbit, you know the rules""
But he had to leave on another deal
So she's out there with sex appeal
It's the weekend, time for freakin, she's sneakin
Outside, tellin her homegirls, ""We can
Do the do, with whoever we want to
Cause we're the fly girl crew""
Not knowin her man messed up the money
Ridin around, thinkin everything's funny
Went in a disco, came outside
Somebody pushed her in a beat up ride
She had to pay for her man's mistakes

Crossroads,14 Shots to the Dome,1993.0,"The wind is howlin'
The rain pours down
Eyes are blood-shot
Heartbeat pounds
Lights go out
The whole world's in darkness
The ground is tremblin'
Dogs are barkless
In the sky there appears a great light
Burnin' all the flesh off the creatures of the night
AAAHHHH!  Cryin' in a childish tone
Terrified of dyin' a painful death alone
Don't smile unless your innocent child
The power of God is gonna get you through your tao
Thrown like a hit from the best
Take it in a slump
Haha
Feel it in your chest
Conquerin' the world with the words
Leadin' the children like herds
I can feel it buildin'
I'm about to explode
I'm walkin' on the crossroad

People livin' in a shack, at the crossroads
Little kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads
Now they stab you in the back, at the crossroads
Everybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads
People livin' in a shack, at the crossroads
Little kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads
Now they stab you in the back, at the crossroads
Everybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads

Violins and trumpets play
25 thousand people in a golden sleigh
On their way to the promised land
Deliverance
But yet some don't understand
Rough on a late night drill
After midnight
Kill or be killed
Soldiers, warriors, mercenaries
Rush at each other
On the combat zone
Supreme power on the throne
Lighting strikes in every home
Terrified men run down the street
So many dead bodies
It's hard to eat
But we gotta rise
Above the wall
To see what no man has seen before
Blindin' light
To guide you through the night
God is on your side
You got to fight!

People livin' in a shack, at the crossroads
Little kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads
Now they stab you in the back, at the crossroads
Everybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads

Little kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads
Now they stab you in the back, at the crossroads

Homicide
Suicide
Death
BOOM!
Ain't nobody left
Ooooh! It's startin' to take effect
You're on your knees
You're scared to death
Tornadoes with a thousand people spinnin'
A fight at the cross
And now god is winnin'
The whole Earth cracks in half
The sea turns red from the bloodbath
Abandoned buildings burned into a maze
Terrified, you feel the fire blaze
The ground can't hold your weight
You reach out to grab the pearly gates
Whole continents floatin' out in space
Never again will you see the human race
19 angels lead the devil straight to hell!
Torment!
Pain!
What you see and hear
You can't explain
All your life
So many played the game
Never realizing there's a flame

You are my life
I have to go on
Havin' me any way you want me baby
Just love me til the tension's gone
And don't you come too soon
I'm patient I never come too soon
When I kissed you you said it was the same old tune
But I missed you my life was filled with gloom
I was hopeless sittin' in an empty room
When you re-appeared I was back in the mix
I put the key up in the lock cause true love fixed
All the drama got to stop baby no more tricks
My broken heart was addicted but now it's fixed
And I cherish you forever believe me you
You's a priceless treasure from my point of veiw
It took time to change I'll admit that
My back in the days love I had to get back

You are my starship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late
You are my starship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late
And don't you come too soon (never that)

I never thought that I would ever lay beside you again
Tastin' every inch plus being your friend
Romantic nights with shootin' stars and full moons
Kiss the rose better til it come full bloom
Can you feel it passions overflows in waves
Keep it steady providin' everything you crave
Now you ready I like that my love you save
I love it when a bad girl agrees to behave
It's the motion that makes your love affair complete
But devotion makes it all twice as sweet
Back together reunited bonded once more
Before I was hesitant but now I'm sure

You are my starship
Come take me up tonight

Come take me up tonight

These world wide webs they weave, we caught in 'em
Old folks is dyin and CEO's skimmin
The bat's in your hand and this is the 9th inning
Keep your eyes on the ball when you swingin
Don't be confused, don't be fooled by the wind-up
Start switchin your position, make your mind up
Pull your bootstraps tight, get your grind up
Get your life lined up before time's up
Yo, yo, you know what?
Take ten percent of that, dough you tryin to stack
Send it up to God, I guarantee he send it back
Multiply it by a hundred times, y'all remember that

You get mad puff-lie all day
Make plans with your crime family
Get money money, take money money
Get money money, take money money

By age 19 Tyheim is turned out
He ain't talking much, keep a dutch in his mouth
Cop the aberrettes
Orange and Blue
Laced the Gore-tex, stepped with his crew
Black superstar, Jesus piece
Who he prayin' to? God or the Beast
Some bust blocks, feared on the block
Traded in the trucks for a silver drop top
Drug money flowin'
Jealousy is growin'
Paranoia got him second guessin'
D-T's on his back got him stressin'
He was at the light blazin' up traum
Around the corner came a tinted out Yukon
Ten slugs in the door made him fall
Guess he should of never hustled at all

You wanna get paid? You wanna get laid?
Pimp Yearlings in 360 ways
Live your life in an ill real way
Got 6 rides in your little drive-way
You get mad puff-lie all day
Make plans with your crime family
Get money money, take money money
Get money money, take money money

My man Tay-Kwan like the chicks a lot
Even when he hustled he kept them in his spot
He liked to fuck a lot and make the rubber pop
5 baby mothers
1 live on my block
Shinin' in the club
Chickens showin' love
Cash bubblin' from pimpin' and drugs
He a real pretty cat
He get from his moms
Back in the seventies, she was the bomb
His games top notch, and he don't stop
He hit a reverend's daughter in a church parkin' lot
Tay-Kwan is sick, heartless with chicks
He liked to beat 'em up, make 'em suck dick
Met a little shorty, brought her back to Queens
Honey got the virus, you know the routine
Not only did he walk away with the HIV
Her man's jealous, jooked him ridiculously

You wanna get paid? You wanna get laid?
Pimp Yearlings in 360 ways
Live your life in an ill real way
Got 6 rides in your little drive-way
You get mad puff-lie all day
Make plans with your crime family
Get money money, take money money
Get money money, take money money

UH UH UH UH UH UH UH UH
Yolanda's alway's got a scheme
Credit cards in ATM machines
Used to make coats, holdin' work got arrest
Honey made sons pockets bleed to death
She a vet, yet she look innocent and sweet
When she wet, ain't no controllin' the heat
For baguettes she give love to ill thugs
Age of 15 she learned to pump drugs
Then she got pregnant, abandoned the kid
Met this drug kid, set him up and slid
Now she 23 full blown in the mix
Sizin' up wits than more cliques is gettin' chips
She down for whatever, as long as it pays
She tipped off the kids and got Tyheim blazed
She was in the same Yukon, laughin' with the thug
He said thanks for settin' Tyheim up
Take a slug

You wanna get paid? You wanna get laid?
Pimp Yearlings in 360 ways
Live your life in an ill real way
Got 6 rides in your little drive-way
You get mad puff-lie all day
Make plans with your crime family
Get money money, take money money
Get money money, take money money

Special shout-out, keepin' on
Check it out y'all, my man in the house...

Conquerer, absolute killer of all
Taker of blood, bouncin' heads like balls
Murderer of suckers, mutilater of the meek
I get ill, so blood spills, every time I speak
Droppin bombs to amputate your ego
Suckers all weak, so let the best go, me go
They talk and talk, I invade and take over
Forget Maaco, you gonna need a make-over
I'm ferocious, animalistic, an animal
On the mic - I'm a cannibal
I eat livers, hearts, legs and arms
They crown me the King of doin' nothin' but harm
I'm in tune with the Universe and I'ma make you the first vic I kill quick, so you went from crew to hearse
I'ma Titan, keepin' you frightened
I went to the Motherland, so now I'm enlightened
There's a...

Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland
It's a Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland

From Côte d'Ivoire to Senegal to Egypt
Cool J I'm slay and I'm fully equipped
To decapitate, amputate and take titles
The legend in leather, I'ma real live idol
And Ima take souls, condemn weak men
And make microphones bend again and again
Cause, I'm bloodthirsty, why'd you try to curse me
You'll lose the battle even if you out-rehearse me
I'ma rip holes watch heads roll, like a mole
When I'm strollin' with a neck full of gold
My battles' like a blackout, you can't back out
Only difference, no time to feel a track out
It's a...

Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland
It's a Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland

So come forward, admit you're guilty
Admit that your thoughts some New Jack killed me
Admit you were sleepin' on the skills of L
Now know that I handle mine, very well
I burn buildings, eat emcee's
Smack DJ's and tell conceited girls please
They try to ban hard, but I'm a vanguard
And they could never get a piece of the man Todd
King Posse ruler and high roller
You losin' it son, your games' gettin' colder
It's a...

Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland

It's a Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland

I'm a Monarch, the Warlord of light
The eliminator, and I'ma score tonight
Somethin' like Merlin, but it goes much deeper
Not just another rapper with a chain and a beeper
One sample is ample for emcees'll get trampled
Bein' as you forgot, I'ma give you a sample
My vocabulary's legendary. My brother, you're temporary
So put your name in the obituary
Step back the conquerer spreads his wings
Kindergarten rappers, I'm back to change things
I rock the clearest, one hell of a lyricist
I can't miss and I'm kinda like a chemist
When I put a potion together it's clever and fatal
You can never make a move on me you're still prenatal
Grip the mic tight sometimes I get callouses
And when I'm through, you face paralysis
I'm gettin' thinner, watch me eat dinner
I'm down to skin a beginner to be a winner
It's a...

It's a Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland

Who gets the roughest, you know the answer
You're a dandelion, I'm a panther
When I pick up the mic, it's bravissimo
King of braggadocio, I'm magnifico
When I rock hard, stroll long, and walk bad
Cause I know it's makes the fake sucker ducks mad
I came back to smack wacks and pull cards
Introducin' the original Todd
Just like a bloodhound but I gotcha spellbound
Your rhymes are snowbound and I can throwdown
I'm like a thundercloud, I drop heavy
Hold steady, get ready, you're petty confetti
Techniques and styles - they ain't ready
Ah, ah, yeah - full of horsepower and I'ma devour
Steam-clean when I scream you're soft as cauliflower
I set the trap and caught you like a brown mouse
Then flip and do a Bruce Lee roundhouse
No threat exist, no man can stand
Say mic check and expect to take command

Leanin dipped in rocks, pump the joint on the block
Behind the Dolce Gabbana shades, peepin the spots
Frostbit and I'm turnin blue, that's why I'm so hot
Put the hustle down majorly and never get knocked
Who can grind for this? Momma taught me to swerve
Rent the presidential suite out, snatch ya bird
My motto is dough or die, peace sign in the sky
In the brand new 'lectric blue Bentley ridin by
Hurt these clowns, anybody that want it
Let you borrow my crown, tell me why would you flaunt it?
Don't you know you can get it, have your wig-piece splitted
Meth asked me to spit it, see my coupes is kitted
And my minks is fitted, lyrically I'm sid-dick
Honey frontin when you around, I always hit it
The boss is home, regulatin on chrome
Tell Russell it's line one, LL's on the phone

Get off my niggy niggy nuts!

Chains might be gold, the joints always platinum
(And rims) always chrome (jeans) always pressed
(Loot) always right (cut) always fresh
(Gear) always dipped (honey) always bangin
(You hot?) Always, my niggy nuts always hangin
Hold it down, rocks by the pound
The new 2002 b-boy sound
Hoes stand back, I'm shakin up the game
You shoulda never tried, to SLIDE in my lane
Guaranteed-to-blow-the-block-up
When-I-ease-this milky white drop up
Wanna bang ya, that's all you need to know
50 deep in Summer Jam, I closed the show
 w/ variations

Nuts, y'all, baby - stay flowin!
Hit Big B, tell him bring the Mo' in (bring it in)
Uhh - we rockin to the rhythm (all night baby)
Uncut raw, what we give 'em
Hell yes - bounce to the music! (bounce)
When the joint come on, everybody lose it
(This year) leave the bar, hit the floor
Represent, let these clowns know who you are
When it's bangin like this, why stop? (Why stop?)
Ask me why I pop Cris', why not? (Why not?)
The flow of the century
Got your Belve splashin to the melody, what you tellin me?
This is fresh - 'til the day I die
Leavin momma with a tear in her eye
You was frontin for a minute, now what?
You snapped when the joint dropped

I break a nigga down ugly like Coke, up on the scale
Next step throw a stack up on the third rail
The undisputed, I'm never ever diluted or polluted
You could fuse it, if ya choose it cos it's deep rooted
I make ya maggot ass crawl out tha gutter
For underestimatin' as I'm creatin' the butter
Cliques get clipped like heavy bricks when I'm droppin'
I'm wreckin' nigga whole shit plus I make a profit
Wicked with this shout, bodies are fished out
I'm wreckin' niggas one-by-one but then I miscount
Mispronounced, how do LL bounce
And get ya shit bust? I turn ya faggots into mush
Ya slippin', I'm grippin' microphones real tight
Then I crack up the speakers in ya Ac all night
Deliver messages, the prophecy's in me
His Royal Highness, you minus what you claim to be
(Say what?)

Uh, I get da drop on you niggas
I blow it, I make it hot for my niggas
Uh, I get da drop on you niggas
I blow it, I make it hot for my niggas
Uh, I get da drop on you niggas
I blow it, I make it hot for my niggas

I blow 'em, KABOOM, but fuck sound effects
Niggas was sleeping like I was off on a Star Trek
Select my dialect, inspect all my cheques
He claim he gettin' money but L cast the cheque
You sell blunt weed, Glock block, horizons
Niggas in the projects find ya hypnotising
You clowns know when I bring forth the heat
Hardcore niggas be wearin' panties, lookin' sweet
I'm on a journey through the land of frontin' niggas
Nervous motherfuckers with tha hands on dirty triggers
I lay back, niggas beef or let my nuts live
I take my blade, insert it until ya guts give
Execution, the destroyer of ya suspect bunch
You motherfucking cream puffs can't punch
What? Drama! You can't believe how I deliver bomb shit
Ya brains split, the pain hits ya little dick

Uh, I get da drop on you niggas
I blow it, I make it hot for my niggas
Uh, I get da drop on you niggas
I blow it, I make it hot for my niggas
Uh, I get da drop on you niggas
I blow it, I make it hot for my niggas

You fallin' backwards, leanin' like a dope addict
Rope niggas claim me, packin' automatics
Found his ol' Earth's burner underneath the mattress
Go outside, the bitch up just like a actress
I take ya motherfuckers one-by-one and show ya how it's done
And dick ya down in front of everyone
Bitch niggas ain't got no type of reason
To say a bullshit rhyme in LL season
I'm freezin', ya bleedin' heavily up out'cha rectum
Black and blue, tryin ta hide up in the spectrum
I got ya raw ass bustin straight flat
Head up on the place mat, ready to waste that
Operatin' incorporates stimulatin' designs
Lay that motherfucker's shit down, nigga resign
Don't lose ya mind, concentratin' on how I shine
You never hear a nigga like me, never in time
I blaze it quick, amaze cliques when I flip
I can't believe you niggas forgot who rip shit
It's '96 and niggas like to hold they dicks
I'm breakin' shit aside ya doctor's can't fix

With the blues light my fuse, allow me
To show ya crab ass fake niggas how it be
My technique's superb when I'm pissin' on these herbs
Crystal clear so you can hear every word
Fuck the goodie-goodie or your moms might hear it

Rasta Imposter,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Intro:
What you got to do with it? What the fuck you talkin about?
What the fuck you got to do with it? You stupid nigga? You stupid?
Did you see that video, nigga? Fuck wrong with you? Like you don't
You don't know what you go to do with it. Like your fuckin insane or
Something. (You fuckin wack ass nigga)
(laughing in background)

Y'all faggots is weak, y'all starstruck niggas think shit is sweet
That busy signal bullshit is dead up in the street
Heard that garbage dough jam, made me reminisce
On when heard your man's wack shit and went to take up his
Jealous faggot man cause I'm richer than y'all
When I load my desertees, I'm picturin y'all
On the streets of Queens where I was raised and born, hardcore
And stood on every corner like a liquor store
Clips full of hollowtips, follow loose lips
Aimin at your clique and make em cough up my chips
Bitch, ya niggas wanna see if I'm ill?
Wanna see how many rappers can be killed, how much blood can spill?
When I inject this lyrical drill, if I can't do it, the dumb-dumbs will
Tell that nigga to tell his man to tell that nigga
I send the wolves to kill that nigga
If you wanna know why, its cause I'm still that nigga
Michael Jordan of all this rap shit, pullin the trigger
What the fuck? You on a mission to self-destruct
And have the nerve to let the chickenhead model cluck
Your swervin nigga, better follow the white lines
Your up on the sidewalk, off course, read the sign
I'm so ill, y'all niggas is so wack
Your whole crew is such, y'all lack the hard impact
Far as your man go, I got young niggas that wanna get him
Treat him like a Philly, wet'im and split'im
Chorus
L.L. don't lose niggas, we can do it however you choose nigga
One on one or round up the crews nigga
But Can-I-Blast you out your shoes nigga
You know the rules nigga!
*repeat*

Queens shit, give me cream so I can grab my dick
Sew that shit, what the fuck y'all niggas workin with?
Backwards, ass-jerk, jumpin up out the woodwork
Ridin my meat, tryin to critique my physique
A real nigga wouldn't even mention my lips
Can't believe you went there, no I know you a bitch
Sugar-coated nigga, deep-throated nigga
Young guns take a pull before they quote a nigga
Yeah, I wrote it nigga for all my real live devoted niggas
I'm a true and livin lyrically ill poet nigga
So what you talkin bout? That shits supposed to be hot?
Y'all niggas on the warpath, y'all takin over my block?
I think not, matter of fact your not aloud to rap no more
And if you hear this in the club sneak out the backdoor
And if you bumpin in your ride make sure your windows is up
And your tint's passed the limit
So they don't know a faggot's in it!
I'm L.L. and I did this to you
Teflon waitin for every nigga runnin with you
Rhymes hit you, lace you up again and split you
Niggas ain't official thats why Mom Dukes miss you
Tell your man bring it on, I'm only gettin warm
Never die, never quit, and my money's long
Punk ass crab nigga, talkin bout his lips
Constantly involvin my name with that bullshit!
Why I diss you? You stepped up in the ring
Ice jinglin in the video like you the next Don King
And tell your man I know he got some lyrics in the stash
But I'm the best that ever did it, now get this motheruckin ass
Mic's too hot to hold, leave it in the sand
So I can describe the picture with both hands
You must not understand who's in command
I got all the flavor, but y'all niggas is mad bland
Chorus

I'll cut your fuckin head off and leave it on your mom's dresser
Then pay the pope a hundred thou to go and bless her
You wanna test a lyrical teacher and professor?
I bet y'all niggas fall off now that your under pressure
I don't stress ya, yet still I must check ya
Extort niggas for gettin fucked up, stop and inspect ya
Fuck wrong with you nigga? You can't do nothin to me
If I put a slug in you on the low, you'd probably try to sue me
Your girl blew me, I said ""Now!"" She said ""Do me""
Bust a nut in her face on tape to let the crew see
Can't put dirt roll, nigga poppin shit
Underestimantin what Queens niggas'll do for chips
I originated all this shit
The ice, the champagne, the bitches on the dick
That really don't apply to you crabs in a barrel
Mic's my staff sendin you a message like Pharaoh
Leave it alone or get swallowed in the sea
The King of Hiphop is something you could never be
My crown you'll never see, I'll rule forever, G
I'll be goin platinum when you just a memory
I'm the double L, capital C, double O
With the seven upside down jakes slayin the clown
What the fuck wrong wit y'all niggas? You out your mind nigga?
You better try to go beg Lauryn to come back or something
Fuck wrong with you?

I Need Love (Full Length version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove
For the first time in my life I see I need love
There I was, giggling about the games
That I had played with many hearts and I'm not saying no-names
Then the thought occurred, tear drops made my eyes burn
As I said to myself ""Look what you've done to her""
I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels
All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal
Playing make believe pretending that I'm true
Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you
Sayin' amour kissing you on the ear
Whispering I love you and I'll always be here
Although I often reminisce I can't believe that I found
A desire for true love floating around
Inside my soul because my soul is cold
One half of me deserve to be this way 'til I'm old
But the other half needs affection and joy
And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy
I need love
Romance, sheer delight how sweet
I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete
You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle
I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle
I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat
Kiss you on the cheek and say ""Ooh girl, you're so sweet""
It's deja vu whenever I'm with you
I could go on forever tellin' you what I do
But where you at, you're neither here nor there
I swear I can't find you anywhere
Sure you ain't in my closet or under my rug
This love search is really making me bug
And if you know who you are why don't you make yourself seen
Take a chance with my love you'll find out what I mean
Fantasies can run, but they can't hide
When I find you I'm a pour all my love inside
I need love
I wanna kiss you, hold you, never scold you, just love you
Suck on your neck, caress you and rub you
Grind moan and never be alone
If you're not standing next to me You're on the phone
Can't you hear it in my voice? I need love bad
I got money, but love is something I never had
I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all
I love you more than a man who's ten feet tall
I'd watch the sunrise in your eyes
We're so in love when we hug, we become paralyzed
Our bodies explode in ectasy unreal
You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel
It's like a dream-land I can't lie, I've never been there
Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share
Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet
I swear to you this is something I'll never forget
I need love
See what I mean I've changed I'm no longer
A playboy on the run I need something that's stronger
Friendship, trust, honor, respect, admiration
This whole experience has been such a revelation
It taught me love and how to be a real man
To always be considerate and do all I can
Protect you, you're my lady and you mean so much
My body tingles all over from the slightest touch
Of your hand and understand I'll be frozen in time
'till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine
If I find you girl, I swear I'll be a good man
I'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands
I can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive
I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive
I'll search the whole world for that special girl
When I finally found you, watch our love unfurl
I need love
LL Talking:
Girl, listen to me
When I be sitting in my room all alone
Staring at the wall
Fantasies, they go through my mind and I've come to realize
That I need true love and if you wanna give it to me girl
Make yourself seen I'll be waiting
I love you",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-i-need-love-full-length-version-lyrics

Ain't nobody as hot as us

On a dirty south track from the N.Y. though
I be on it, I be on it, ya'll cats don't really want it
Ya'll don't want it, ya'll just fronting, homeboy, then back up off me
I'm a young fly soldier, thought I told ya, wack cats is gon' be over
I'm a supernova, controller, anything that I get I hold up
I'm a supernova, controller, anything that I get I hold up
Take it back up to the N.Y., show 'em how we do, what we do and why
Keep ballin' in our ride, driving show, I pass 'em by
You see our paper, haters hating but it's still all good
And if you looking for me, you can catch me in my hood
Just doing my thing, got the ring bling, don't get it misunderstood
Nicolette, LL, on the same track, bring it back, tell me what you
Think about that
Boys trynna holla, but I ain't having that
You better have game, you better come correct
Ya Girl Nicolette, don't like lame cats
Tell me what you think about that, let's go

Love that you made money, really don't matter
If I see her from a far, this what I yell at her
Hey, over there, over there
Ho, get over here, get over here
In your club with your girls, I'm in here with my mans
Won't your girls meet my boys, we can all be friends
Hey, over there, over there
Ho, get over here, get over here

Got to get it popping, the track is knocking, the Bentley's rocking
Overdose I'm suppose to roast 'em, with every bar I'm dropping
Every time I drop they copping, every single line I lay is locking
You a hater, boy, stop your plotting, it'll be your blood we mopping
Talk about that major flavor, keyed up, cut like a razor
Lyrically I stake and bake ya, you can see I get that paper
Wear jet black like Darth Vader, hopping out on playa haters
It's in my n-n-nature, never been a smoother operator
Switch it up, hit it up, get it up, let it up
Your girl from the back, like giddy up
How come I run, you like my son, I blow the whole god damn city up
Inside that long white milky Bentley like I just picked Diddy up
Think about that while you doubt that, you a fake mac, you can't count that
Hop all off then I bounce back, got 'em looking a wolf pack outback
I'm from where them GOAT GOAT, shout that
Ask Master P, I'm bout that
Everybody know I'm holding, in the party, pocket swollen
Rock and rolling, competition catching coals in they colon
(Chorus)

What up ya'll, ya'll know us
Know the party ain't ill til we show up
Once we hit the scene, the chicks go nuts
Sorry if I intervene, ma, but so what
Pour more cups of the drink, cups of the guz stop
Til I'm all drunk in the place, burn the kush to the face
Making the dudes wanna hate, cuz we them new dudes in the state

Yeah, we in the club just chilling, B, yeah, baby feeling me
Feel like a barbecue, shorty keep grilling me up
In the club doing stacks where a ceiling be
Do it well, ask LL dog feeling me
Dudes not feeling me, because we walked in the door
Looking flyer than airplanes, it's not touching the floor

The body move to the tune, yessir

Come to your hood, we be rocking your town
Go to the show we rocking the crowd, get gwop by the thou', wow

Come on and roll wit the kid, back to the crib
Car real fast, bed real big
Just like that, I'mma get them stacks
Got 'em screaming out, my neck, my back
Work it all night, this ain't no tease
You gonna be scarred, I'mma sweat that weave
Now you can't drive, it's too much speed
Just sit back and enjoy that breeze
In the whip today, but not tomorrow
That's the life of a superstar
Wanna be involved, better be aware
Ticky Diamondz got women everywhere
Do it on the floor, stairs to the chair
Do it on the beat, please, hands to stare
Got you on the beach, you out somewhere
Got your girl screaming that it ain't that fair
Baby come true, got enough bread
Switch to the truck, nothing more said
Kid don't play, just do clean
That's what it is, when I come from Queens
Do my lean, big black truck
Coming through like I'm moving that stuff
I just get checks, just get neck
Girls I'm afraid, running round butt nake
Gotta go, back to the grind
Back to the tracks, back to the rhymes
Burn a little haze, I let my rhyme ---

Crime Stories,Walking with a Panther,1989.0,"{*Judge talking*}

Twent-five years in the state penitentary
Tried to pull off the biggest crime of the century
Pulled out the ten-side nine milimeter
Went out to rob, sticking up sweeter
Never had a job you gonna work for ya
Major escape but a basehead saw ya
You got it under control, you rock and roll
Crime is in your soul, you go on for the goal
Comin' home late with your trigger finger aching
Got in the beef for some buckwilds (?) they making
Drivin' fast, I can lay in the lane
Caught with a kilo, now explain!

Don't do the crime, if you can't do the time
(Crime Stories!)
Don't do the crime, if you can't do the time
Don't do the crime, if you can't do the time
Don't do the crime, if you can't do the time
Don't do it!

Uzi's, nines, forty-fives and Macks
Cocaine on the brain, gold chains and jacks
Hitman for hire, big contracts
In fact he got macked cause the eye-contact
Bought a .38 so now he's a wanna-be master
Come on, baby, I eat steak and lobster
I got a Mercedes-Benz, I be as double-(?) as your friends
But what about the hidden camera lens?
Cortex-style, but you're countin' that money
Then the brothers who diss think they sooo funny
They took yours - you thought you was nice
But now pay the price - they put you on ice!

{*Judge talking*}

Guilty! You get paid for crime
I get paid to rhyme on time and in my mind
I see I might have to find a even harder groove
I got a smarter move
No crime no time, now that's smooth
Who wants to play a cell and waste time as well
I'd much rather be L than in hell
Cause I might never go and stick up sell
And end up like them with dry pistol smell
I'd much rather earn mines and get mines
Make up stacks and cracks and write def rhymes
He cuts so quick and I'm sharp as a knife
I got sentenced to rock, 25 to life!


Cut-throat killer, proud of the fact he kills
He got in the beef, he said stand back to chill
Pulled out the gun, the crowd started to run
BOOM! (?) boy is done!
Went around braggin', yeah boy I dit it, I admit it
The description of the killer - I fit it
If the cops wanna catch me, they better come with it
I shot the bullet and homeboy bit it
Like a (?), I put a pounder
I'm fond o' kill or be killed, long as my pockets get rounder
I'm on my own, I'm alone, and I roll for me

I'm mad cause they said I wasn't bad
No recognition cause they said I'm from the ghetto
Carryin' nine millimeters and stiletto's
I guess I need a TV show to get mine
But I don't feel like kissin' no director's behind

And don't know a damn thing about a block party mic-cord
They see LL, they know the brothers' real
But the flies can tell you exactly how they feel
When I come in the door it's like I'm made of dynamite
I gotta blow up more and more
Shakin' the rafters from here on after
Puttin' an end to all the laughter
There ain't no way they can win
With the band all in, plus the turntable spin
Strip-searchin' competition, you can call 'em competition
But there ain't no competition cause I'm on a mission
I'ma rip this game, I want the soul train families and anybody with a name
Superstars step aside this year
And all you other little crumbs that wanna try and come near

I started in the basement of my grandmother's house
My rap got gashed, your whole body's' gettin' doubts
Burnt to a crisp, lead from the mist
Third degree and Gods' my only witness
When I shocked the world, hold the prince hostage
For the diamonds and pearls
Maker-Mike will remember the time
Tellin' Madonna black love ain't a crime

I feel like Reg in the bush with Kincaid
Never seen a girl in the world
That moves her body, like you do
Have to party, invitin you

Before your eyes, I know you're sick
Of all the lies and alibis
From other guys, when I'm watchin you
I get energized, I realize
We need surprise, variety
Is the spice of life, so I eat you up
Like apple pie, I like your flow
You're the star, this is your show
Speed it up, take it slow
Push it out, take it low
That helps a love like this to grow
If you're feelin me girl let me know
I know that you are respectable

Jealousy - I wanna kill him and shoot him
He's a sucker - I'd like to execute him
Recruit him - put him in my school and school him
I said somethin simple, and I knew that I'd fool him
He's only mediocre, jealousy can't get with me
Hang up your clothes, cause jealousy ain't spent to me
He's just a monkey, ridin my back
In fact I kidnap, ramsack, hijack and backslap the fool..

I bring the bacon home so jealousy go home
Or play the wall and pout about the way the prince is rollin
So when they give it up, stand back and start foldin
All your jealous show clothes, I think you need to grab a
Half-pint of Cisco and hang out with Backstabber
Cause I'mma break down all walls Jealousy built
And then walk tall, like I'm standin on stilts yeah
Jealousy the jam is mean you'll have to rewind it
If you didn't know about him, you must have been blinded
Ask him if I'm right, he'll tell you he sure is
Excuse me for a moment, fellas sing a smooth chorus

Thank you fellas, the way you sung the chorus was swift
But now it's time to pump lyrics, and shoot the gift
His name is Jealousy fellas see what I mean now turn it out
Without a doubt and if it hits you in the heart don't pout
Cause I'mma hit Jealousy and his posse where it hurts a lot
Him and his boys have a habit, they always smirk a lot
And make mean faces, I see em in many places
Scared to face us, they wish they could erase us
Or outdo us, can't do damage and never will

Papi way too pimply to live this fast life simply
Please squeeze at them twin armored Bentleys, I love envy
Evidently, the pesos made 'em resent me
Cause I clown on 'em, pull they broad gently, leave the bar empty
I pimp Benzoes, you smell cherry air freshener
Leather and indo, I cruise slow spit slick lingo
You might mingle with more stars than Ringo
On the beach in Santo Domingo lightin trees with singles
But I'm a mandingo I make your guts tingle
'til your doorknockers jingle, stack chips like Pringles
Ball like the Bengals, spread love like Kris Kringle
Get paid off the single, let them dollars co-mingle
Baby, baby, deep dish is chrome, navy
Gray interior you feel inferior, it's crazy
It's over baby your vision's hazy they plantin daisies
You tried to play me but couldn't fade me that's why they pay me
 w/ minor variations

Since I dropped ""I'm Bad"" I've been in Jags with nickle bags
Hoes I had give better blows than Felix Trinidad
One I had flew her Benz in from Baghdad
With personalized tags, chrome mags and Prada bags
I refused to stab, now she cryin in the rehab
Wishin while reminiscin about all the sessions we had
You knew all the positions to keep me on a mission
Put the Playstation 2 in your Limited Expedition
You're the mami I kept dipped, slept wit, crept wit
Once you got needy and greedy sweetie I flipped like a brick
Sharin my oochie spendin my chips
Like I'm up in the Bricks politickin for new flicks
On the FreakNik tip, grabbin your phattie on the 6
I ain't faded by them hips
I split, just like Xzibit from Tha Liks (X)
I got major bread to break
Recipes for cake, keys to V's and estates, I'm straight

This is Ring Tone M...,Exit 13,2008.0,"Clap ya hands and to the beat, ya'll
Because the heat'll make you, clap ya hands and say
You go the one for the cash, two for the safe
(This is ring tone murder) Let's dog the place

My bars are like a bullet, blow your head right off
Hate on the trigger, pull it, give your mouth a night off
Give your sound man a c-note to cut your mic off
The promoters need me, nigga, you just a write-off
After that, hit the dress room, turn the lights off
Score on the fourth broad, let her break my pipe off
I used the word 'off' seven times in a rhyme
You dumb enough to think I got a limited mind
But before you start tweaking, critiquing, pressing rewind
Einstein understand, that your third eye's blind
You lack creativity, that's why you don't sign
They calling me a genius, it's about time
I'm like the tattoos on your mama's behind
I bounce up and down, and at the end I'mma sign
And I will humiliate anybody that want it
I'm back on stop, it hurts little homey, don't it?


It's obvious these clowns don't know who I am
Most who didn't get the message, nigga, check the spam
Get your facts right, take your dick out your hand
No homo, but you probably on the low-low, damn
They call Uncle L, I'm from the north side of Queens
Now you looking at me, like what does that mean
It means I crush you and every coward in between
For sounding like girls with them sweet sixteens
And I don't give a fuck about who's old or young
From what I hear, the graveyard got room for everyone
Test Big Ellie, come and get your head sprung
Which coffin you want, the blue or the red one?
I ain't gang banging, that ain't the muthafuckin' point
The point is, I spark these niggas like dust joints
The point is you gon' pay me what you owe me plus points
Listen to the sound of revenge, it's my voice


Run around talking bout I'm twice ya age
But I was rich at 17, you got some shit to explain
Rap game's like a movie, niggas playing the role
But your poker game's too weak, you're forced to fold
All this hating and debating shit, made me cold
Ready to blast, separate ya body from your soul
Conniving ass cowards get dropped in a hole
These niggas is shook like Pinky's ass on the pole
I'm the bridge over troubled water, pay my toll
I'm the rules to the game, you obey my code
I'm the center of the bomb, I'm the part that explodes
You are not hip hop, nigga, go write for Vogue
You are not a king nor prince, you just a toad
You ain't a G, you a hoe, you sweeter than Rocky Road
Battle anybody, who want it? Let me know
I just had another birthday, nigga, more dough",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-this-is-ring-tone-m-lyrics

Just sit back and relax, Bentley seats in the back
Lil' momma we rollin (WE ROLLIN, WE ROLLIN)
Candy paint on the 'llac, shoes bigger than Shaq
Chrome beamin we rollin (WE ROLLIN, WE ROLLIN)
Picture a scene from The Mack, picture me on it like that
Quick get in, we rollin (WE ROLLIN, WE ROLLIN)
Yeah I rap and I act, God could be where I'm at
Lil' momma we rollin (WE ROLLIN, WE ROLLIN)

The cars are sick B, the bars is milky
He hard to kill G, the God is real deep
The Coupe Deville leanin, pinky ring freezin
Creep with no ceiling, keep the chrome beamin
Cold with no feelings, rollin, dough pealin
Cruise the track, candy paint on the 'llac
Shoes bigger than Shaq, lil' momma relax
What he wearin on his back, is never off the rack
Todd Smith custom, all the ladies lust him
They with him, he crush them, we talkin 'bout a mack
A purebred dog, not one of them alley cats
Thorough to the max, Q-boro matter fact
Ice so sharp it slice through your cataracts
Hard from the wars, he tough as a battleaxe
Don't hate him cause he hot, God put him where he at
Fo' sho'!


Truly got the bottles on chill, the models lookin ill
V.I.P. locked down, crackin them hundred dollar bills
Yankee hat low, Todd Smith the rhinestones
Your chick chose him, let him bygones be bygones
All these, amateur macks with they eyeballs watery
Choosin honies over money that's how the order be
Meanwhile he gets his statements quarterly
Your starvin on the corner actin drunk and disorderly
Relax in the Maybach, gettin your booze on
Seats is like a couch, get your Tom Cruise on
French pedicure with the Jimmy Chu's on
He wanna see more he throw somethin smooth on
The modern day Goldie, game better than Kobe
Style dope than codeine, playin for his own team
When he walk up in the spot, he lookin so clean
Rubbin money in your face like cold cream

Trashy
Brother from way back
We're blowin mics since the days of 8-track
Certified
Bonified
Pull out the weapon
Rusted
Your ho's gets busted
Run your jewels!
Shootin up ya damn fools
Leavin' your loser lazy lyricist
In bloody pools
Went away
Came back
Your still wack
Now your slobbin Marly's mob
For a dope track
Comin off like a bra
And its the witness
No click-click
A fru (?) business
Don't care about no money
Got props in it
Flippin scripts
With every letter in the alphabet
Wanna jump. JUMP!
And jingle your rump. RUMP!
Here to pump punks
With real hot lead chunks
Full-grown
I ain't no baby with these rhymes kid
Put the mic down
My peoples know where ya live
I chop you little brittle riddle
Right up the middle
And have the police playin the fiddle
In the hospital
Somebody said, ""He couldn't rip with the roughness.""
Rhymes kick your teeth
But end up frontless
Soul survivor of a thousand beats
Sendin funeral wreathes
To all ya use-to-be chiefs
Is a raw
To a bearlin in the woods (?)
Brothers tapes ain't jack
Their best tracks is wack
I heard you think you got a chance to win
But my Glock is stopped off
To murder the top ten
Rough and rugged and raw
I'm like a callous
The underground can say
""ain't no Fra-zontin in my palace.""

Well can I be the flavor of the month?
I got the flavor
Plus I can bump a chump
I got the funk
Straight from my underground hide-out
I freak it in the house
And let the hits just
Ooz out
Bust on the scene
To let ya know I wasn't frontin
Got ya screamin for my album
So I had to do somethin
Write tonight
To take a bit
Not a bite
And watch the do-it-all
Freak you with
All my might
Like ""Here I am to save the day!""
I stop the tracks
With the mic
So I say ""To chay""
And ""On Gaurd""
When I'm swingin for your brow
Cause in the house of hits
Ain't no frontin allowed

Just when you thought
That it was safe
To try and chop me
Run for ya life
Now here somes Mr. Funky
And I'm pissed
So watch how many heads
I'll be the takeout
Boy ya better look out
I work ya like a cook-out
So get the flavor
The original Mr. Funky
(?)
And you watch me do my thing
Because I hit ya with the funk
Of the fly-talker
And make your girl
""Bump-bump! Get it, Get it!""
Like Luke Skywalker
I can't front
I love rappin with a passion
Crash your head front
Into the funk
You think I'm slam dancin
See when you front
You make mad
The alter weight (?)
Freak this:
""funky twin powers activate!""
Sheik on the mic
With the cape and muscles
Crushin MC's
While their girls do the hustle
See other rappers
Try to dis the lords
But yo, your dead wrong
Damnit, can't we all just get along?
We'll see
There simply ain't no frontin allowed
Yo, I'm out
Like the Cosby show
Peace to the Funky Child

Punchin your god-damn eyebrows off
Roughin it up north
Lookin' like your laugh off (?)
It's a blash smash
And crash from my stash
Be watchin your back kid
Your girl and the phat path
Talkin bout your macks and tax
What's with that?
Your gettin wet like
Sloooow sex
Rippin on that old school kid
Leavin sliced as a slit
Says I wet your crib
No question
Testin the west
And the east and
Once the ammo was released and
I'll make your girl come and getcha
Hope you get the picture
Boy your better off
If a pit bit ya!
What's its like
In the illest fight
Believe the hype
I'm givin crowds more nose jobs than Mike
Fight sight alright
They bite
Spot light tonight
Is hype
Trigger happy tripe
Don't hit bite
My owner's right
And ya know it's comin off
So don't ask it
Snatchin the vocal
And hotties on the rap tip
Mackin ya boys up
Bringin the noise up
And now ya need stitches
Because my voice cuts

Every Sip,The DEFinition,2004.0,"(Sip somethin')
Uhh, sip somethin'
(Sip somethin')
I wouldn't drink that, if I was you

With every sip of my drink (uhh)
I get a little bit closer (uh-huh)
And when I'm tryin' to re-think (yeah)
I can't really get focused (uh, uh)
I wasn't tryin' to be mean
I can see that it's hopeless (uhh)
'Cause your persistence overpowers me
I know you rollin' out with me

I was stayin' at the Shore Club, leanin' in the red room
Seen this tan mami, she was fresh off the sand dunes
Big bottles and models and poom-pooms
Surroundin' my table, watchin' me like cable
My Dolce hat was low, Versace shades
Had the Prada shoes on 'cause the world is a stage
Lah-lah in the air, it's a sky bar affair
The glamorous life, I had my glass in the air
When my eyes connected with somethin' real real nice
Like she finished her drink and started chewin' on my ice
Her smile was bananas, teeth was pearly white
That's when I realized it'll be a long night
The vibe was right, she was laced in all white
Her French manicure traced the crown on my mic
You ever try to focus, resist with all your might
But every sip you take pulls you deeper in the hype

With every sip of my drink (uhh)
I get a little bit closer (uh-huh)
And when I'm tryin' to re-think (yeah)
I can't really get focused (uh, uh)
I wasn't tryin' to be mean
I can see that it's hopeless (uhh)
'Cause your persistence overpowers me
I know you rollin' out with me

I'm talkin' tan lines, belly rings and things
DJ rubbin' my thing, makin' my head swing
All the honies was schemin'..
'Cause the rocks in my ears was gleamin'
Oh God I must be dreamin'
My vision was blurry, the party was rockin'
The tools was knockin', honey wanna get it poppin'
Try my best to chill, she was fresh out of Brazil
People was walkin' by makin' our drinks filled
What would you do, if you was a Don
In a position to wild out with a Brazilian blonde?
Or maybe you a honey and it's hard to keep calm
'Cause you sippin' on somethin' and homeboy's the bomb
You dancin' in your seat, and singin' along
And every sip makes you feel like you need to perform
The party is packed, it's just a little too warm
But you take another sip to prove that you strong

With every sip of my drink (uhh)
I get a little bit closer (uh-huh)
And when I'm tryin' to re-think (yeah)
I can't really get focused (uh, uh)
I wasn't tryin' to be mean
I can see that it's hopeless (uhh)
'Cause your persistence overpowers me
I know you rollin' out with me

I can't call it, I can't tell
Honestly, I'm drunk as hell (uh-huh)
And me, I can not believeeeee (lay back baby)
This night out is windin' down (uhh)
You keep buyin' all these rounds for meeeeee (aww man)
I know what you want from me (yeah)

Here we go - another funky style
Peace to my brothers on ""
Rikers' Isle

Introducin' the crew, that's goin' a mile
So get behind the ropes, stop actin' wild
This here part is like section one
So you can bugaloo and set fire to your buns
Early mornin' light is yet to come
And when it come, we can boogy in the sun
Females, let your hair down
Cause this is how we do it when we go uptown
With the funky sound, the razzamatazz
You give me to the ""sploshers"", you can get your-a blast
Enter at your own risk - some brothers got weapons
Yet you're still steppin', the beats' so funkafied
And answer to the bone, people'll be dancin' alone
Leanin' on the wall next to grandma's mop
With the funky, funky groove that's far from pop
Dosey-do
 your partner all night long
And all you mothers, bring your kids along

Ain't no mountain high enough
 to overcome this
Funky-like type of stuff
The feds are ridiculous, they call my bluff
But my wrists are too skinny to hold me with cuffs
I got the sure-shot guaranteed mover
Suck it like a hoover and do ya whole maneuver
Don't stop till you get it on
With ya head beboppin' like a bouncy ball
They do it in the park, they do it in the mall
But when I do it, yeah, I'm doin' it for y'all
Asiatic, automatic, your funky fanatic without no static
Flippin' on the freak like I'm acrobatic
You were searchin' for the funk and I had it
Here we go, hand over the cash yo
What chime? Aiyyo, pass the Tobasco
Work your body like a dime, oh no
Do the freaky-deaky - the whole girls' cargo
Females on the side - we gotta win 'em, yeah
The back pockets are stuck with nothin' in 'em, yeah
Except my beeper number, rubbin' all my lumber so I cannot slumber
Makes me sick like a earthquake
So do the baddy-too-true, we got cash to make
Able body, ready to party, all the ladies in the house
Must be eatin' hardy
And provin' and movin', groovin', so soothin'
Good for ya and clinically proven (Damn!)
Every little bit of the tip makes ya taste flip, like sugar on Ritz
Get on down, to the sure-shot sound
Cause all five burrows are rockin' uptown

Pump up the nasty, nasty, nasty sound
Kick back and let it please ya like a rub down
Put ya body in the lost and found
(Kick that L) I love the way its goin' down
What you see is what you get
In other words, who's next to be the teachers pet?
Down-home monkey - corn fed, original
And what you do is up to you, the individual
This is the place to be for all ya underage brothers
With the rebel mentality
Sweet young freaks sayin ""Rock me Amadeus""
Skin so smooth lookin' all (cadme-ish??)
Video to video, tape to tape
Walkin' through the jam in search of a playmate
Party is packed like a rich man's fridge
Too many people in the crib
The situation is sweaty and crazy like Eddy
And yes we are ready to funk it up steady
Ain't nothin' here petty
Strip down to your lingerie - I'm ready!!
Hold your horse, and baby feel the force
And get yours off - no matter what the cost
Come out your clothes, get hot like a stove
Early in the mornin', we're dancin' in robes
To a funkified sweaty, greazy groove
Another Marley remix to make you move
(Chorus: LL Cool J)
(Yo Uncle) whassup, whassup?
(Yo Uncle) yeah, I do a little somethin'

Preserve the Sexy,Todd Smith,2006.0,"LL, uhh, Teairra Mari

You seem like the type that wanna do a couple things
When I look in your eyes I can tell you ready to swing

Slow down baby, I'm way more than a fling
And I'm up on the game that you O.G.'s brings
 + (T.M.)
Damn it's like that, chronological attacks?
You talkin real greasy, easy, that's a trap
(You need to fall back) What'chu sayin, I'ma rap?
(Yeah right I ain't no trick, I ain't with all that)
Now see, you talkin real bold, your vibes is real cold
You better smarten up, slide on in the Rolls

I'm not the next chick, you can hit the exit
Everything you sayin is just what I expected

Hearts I've rejected many more than you've collected
Life is a movie I'm just tryin to direct it
You know like I know, you would wanna stay connected
Hip you to the rules of the game, shorty check it
 + (Teairra Mari)
The chain on my neck (preserve the sexy)
The O's in the check (preserve the sexy)
The crib and the whips (preserve the sexy)
Cash, the chips (preserve the sexy)
The honey on my arm (preserve the sexy)
The ice in my charm (preserve the sexy)
Teairra Mari (preserve the sexy)
It's your man L on this beat (preserve the sexy)
 + (Teairra Mari)
You really should let me, keep you in Giuseppi's
Frankie V's, H. Findel, Chanel, this is L
(You doin a lot of frontin) But that ain't hard to tell
(You tryin to flip me) Nah B (this I see)
Uh-huh, we'll see, spend a little time with me
By the time I make my move you be sayin finally
(Ain't no moves to be made) Too many games get played
(Too many chickens gettin laid and watch they reputations fade)
Where you from? (Detroit) What that mean? (I'm on point)
Relax, we talkin, don't get your drawers out of joint
I wanna see you smile, elevate your lifestyle
Cop a yacht, hit the South of France (not a chance)
Keep your little advance, this one's on me
And the chef's on board, you can eat for free

Slow down sweetie, my waist is 24
I'm far from greedy (you're gonna love it, believe me)


Cats sippin venom and spillin it on my linen
My baby smooth leather is softer than most women
Everything is crisp from my cuff to my trimming
Words can't describe all the garments that I been in

I been had Cartier, switch whips every play
My little Jack Rusell know how to hustle
I stay with canaries on, platinum on every song
Hate it or love it, then respect how I does it
 + (Teairra Mari)
Uhh, well I'm not dem, that's how I got gems
Cost a quarter million dollars for them like shiny rims
Understand me slim, this how the game begin
If he was me then he'd do the same to him
But L's the real deal, so tell me what you feel
Tell me one of your secrets, I'll keep my lips sealed
(That's for me to know and you to find out)
Long as we both know what we talkin 'bout, cool

Say What,Deep Blue Sea: Music From The Motion Picture,1999,"Most thugs front when they get the chance (say what?)
Some thugs hit the blunt when they get the chance (say what?)
Live thugs stack chedder, then they make plans (say what?)
I, Cool J, NY2K
Rule milleniums with my compadres
They tounges sway with really nothing to say
They pack guns, but I stack funds
I'm second to none
My hot streak's just begun
You wanna bring beef? You got to serve it well-done
You ran the wrong way, now you livin' on the run
Not some, each one's a bum, every one
Coughed up a lung, became my son
Flames I brung, platinumn weighs a ton
Heavy on the chest, I pitty all the rest
I put 'em to the test
I spit it like I'm blessed
I testify
I have no need to lie
I buried many, still many wanna die
I zone out crazy, starin' don't faze me
Got ya whole strategy shook
It's too daisy

Clack, relaod, clack, reload
Got ya pictures sittin' in my lap
He explode
Duck when you hear the rat-tat-tat
'Cause once you cross over baby, ain't no comin' back
Beleive that
I flows when I hit that
Strive till I get that
Never mind a set-back
No time to wet that
A lyrical hi-jack, you don't wanna try that
Creep wit' my CD, don't let 'em know you buy that
One in the snips, one in the whip with the low jack
Call a 911 to get the LL back
Original bells, LL
Rocked them till they fell
Competition bailed
Looked like mince green when mic had 'em swelled
Wrote all them rhymes and never gonna sell
Meanwhile, I'm countin' prezzies in the the 'tel
And in the meanwhile, I throw my baby in Chanelle

Unh, I'm lyrically hot tonight, come on
Unh, I'm lyrically hot tonight, come on
Layin' low to catch you on stage so I can run on
Matter fact, you not on my level, I throw my son on
Mission is complete, technique is unique
Defeat the rhyme weak and mine ya knee-deep
Rewind a rip beats and give jeeps the heat
Even if you walkin', wit' ya walkman in the street
Actin' gassed up, but you really on need
How you countin' your paper kid, without a GED?
Slow down, let me do my thing now, hold up
Maybe that's the reason you stressed, quick to roll up
Put the L down, picked the other LL up
Maybe we can straighten this out before it's toe-up
Watch me closely, boom! I'm a blow-up
And spend the whole rest of my life stackin' dough up

Whoo, Vinnie Biggs, you hot with this one, dawg
Roundtree
Rock The Bells
Unh, Brian Daughtery
Unh, all my peeps, my peeps, my peeps across the land
Know what I mean? we gonna keep gettin' paper
This is real
This is real, right here
Rock The Bells
It's deeper than the deepest blue sea, dawg
Know what I'm sayin'?

They like this boy rotten
I'm like I better pick ? then pick cotton
And sometimes gotta see cats to blow
I was blessed with that 20/20 vision fa sho
See its 20 mil a year 20 years in a row
First 20 mil came when I was 20 years old
I average right around 20% on my dough
Fast farward 20 years then compare my flow
Difference is I own mine and you still owe
Slackin in your mackin can't save a ho
Spekulatin at the bar over mohetoe
Like I betchya fall off, oh no he won't
So I so spit better, oh no he don't
Under 20 ass 50 if you feelin to go
Over 30 ass Rakim I ain't no joke
I'm dirty his jaws drop off wicked and went

From New York to Richmond, my shine is sickenin'
Ice drips, frost bits, or forfeit shit
I got to rewrite this mackin' game, baby
Layin' in the barber shop, knowin' haters is shady
Maybe, they sex young chicks and whips
But I got lesbo combos ridin' stick-shifts
For no chips, I'm seein' 4 to 8 lips

Ah man
It's LL season, let's ride!
Hands up, hands up
Hands up, slip into the bath salt
(Push it) never 'cus I have to
(Push it) it's because I'm a bastard
(Push it) and I got the game mastered
(Push it) ear drums, dealing with harassment
(Push it) we back to the basement
Hand on my nuts, that's product placement
The game lost it's flavor, I wonder where the taste went
(Push it) I said I wonder where the taste went
(Push it) slip into the bath salt
(Push it) slip into the bath salt
(Push it) slip into the bath salt
Push it real good
Uh, boss of all bosses
Face in the car, make a young girl noxious
Yea, this beat salad when I toss this
Never go against me, you lack resources
What? I skywalk with the forces
Back in the 80's I was playin in Porsches
Money ain't a problem, I toll my losses
Maserati coup, take galloping horses
Nah, there's never been one like me
They're looking for a new me as if there might be
Even with a love song, that's unlikely
If L ain't the dope, may lightning strike me
Uh, killin Queens all day
I got what you want, what you willin to pay?
Your boy ladies love sound, clean on the track
Slip into the bath salt, wash my back, come on

(Push it) slip into the bath salt
(Push it) slip into the bath salt
Push it real good
Honestly I was scared to come back
It was ugly not knowing how the game would react
Said my old gym teacher, he supposed to rap
But now I teach class, put back Tony
You see it in my eyes, transparent like glass
Giving all for my soul to have another smash
Yea, LL Cool J
30 years later, be me for a day
Same day, just a daddy, she love me anyway
So I told er what to read and I showed er how to pray
Cats on my team, got NBA
But it's my black, from the web we stay
I don't whack my suicides, I act my age
Never try to sound like a rapper I raised
Roared as a tiger, can't grow no brains
But the money's coming in in 360 ways

(Push it) it's because I'm a bastard

You get your dome splattered, cause homey will not have it
Your ashes get scattered across the Atlantic
For actin like you a teenage chick with her bra padded
You might laugh at it, but if you do the knowledge
It's really a tad tragic how they runnin through they cabbage
You know my track record, L battle like a savage
I think and grow rich, that gives me the advantage
Uncle LL, I got product for sale
So I can bail Al Sharpton out of jail
Somebody gotta do it, somebody in the black community
Gotta get this money while y'all march for unity
So march on, I'ma get my Bentley park on
Then get my dogs a platform to bark on
The realest brother, you Nicole Kidman, one of 'The Others'
Children shiverin under the covers
The man in black, the tilted Fedora hat
I'm bringin it raw, you never want your money back
I'm focused baby, livin like a quarterback
Playin in the wishbone, L keep options black
Systematically, burn you like calories
Watch your mouth, go earn your lil' salary
I'm a classic like Nike Airs and Wallabees
You could catch it like the flu, homey follow me

It's one in the mornin - flash the dough
It's one in the mornin - crack the Mo'
It's one in the mornin - get on the flo'
It's one in the mornin - who wanna go?

That's right Sleeping Beauty, wake up see the light
That Tylenol PM got you caught for your BM
Everybody can see I'm the king of rippin coliseums
C'mon, youse a male groupie beggin for per diem
A fruitcake laid out in the masoleum
I'm the richest man in Babylon, nobody could see him
Money's my slave, it do what I say
It cry for me, like Denzel in ""Glory""
But I broke the cycle, no more poverty
I wonder if you hatin on the low - probably!
But cats know I'm real, I keep 'em on they heels
Damn!  Look at my body, coulda been a Navy Seal
But you lack the discipline to do what I do
Reinvention, I'm in the 11th dimension
I'm a value stock pop, get it while it's hot
Cause once I blow, I'ma split and that's it

Aiyyo E it's one o'clock
Time to get one and bounce baby
It's time to get one and bounce, you know what time it is
Your honor, last week he punched me in my face
I want twenty million, you know he liftin weights
Last week, me and the President was takin flicks
Last week, my video dropped and you was sick
Last week, I copped my lil' shorty some kicks
That cost 29 hundred, homey you don't want it
My ears stay flooded like your man stay blunted
My American Express is Black, I'm at the Summit
The Benjamin Grier of Def Jam, y'all know
My po'tfolio was sicker than polio
For real God is good, he took me out the hood
Got me livin in a mansion like a big boy should
And I never do Cribs, I ain't gonna have y'all fruitcakes
Knowin how I live, bed extra big
You sit around, run your mouth, POTbelly on the couch
Claimin you hot but honey what you wove out
When she alone, pump L, I make her bounce
You on the corner riskin your life to sell a ounce
Wish you was Pablo, lay in the carbo
With a chick named Margo who flew from Chicago
But no, in real life cats catch it

Sweet street pusher, give me that gusher
Nasty stuff - look up - I took her
Ran out of liquor (time to re-up!)

Rap fame and plat' thangs they can't hang
I mack dames and pack thangs and act strange
Jang-a-ling dang-a-ling oh no they can't stop
Take it to the floor back up and then drop
Effervescent.. time time's of the essence
Make 'em undress in less than three seconds
So whores keep steppin whores keep slobbin
Sex as a weapon, clothes that I slept in
Streets keep mobbin, thieves keep robbin
Get two in yoor butt, three to your noggin
Creepin and crawlin, I'm incogneg'
Can't catch the balls then you in the wrong league
Let a dog breathe, watch a pimp walk
Shut yo' ass up when you hear a pimp talk
Friskier dreams, Krispier Kremes
You lookin mighty fine in them jeans

All you brothers want a, fatty girl, fatty girl
Fatty girl - who me?

Havin young ladies bustin like 380's
Lubricated silencers, crushin all challengers
Gats that be claimin they Glocks but really Dillingers
Get it? Glock Dillinger, I'm big you small
More nuts on your face than graffiti on the wall
Hair like Brillo, cuttin up my pillow
Got 'em sayin (hello!) naked in a tub of a Jello
Still no competition, still flow nigga listen

Amen! It's like a scene out of Player's magazine
Let them other cats holla, L'll make you scream


Aiyyo welcome home Murray!
Yo, this is in thought of those broads who got the goods
To the chicks who don't - ehhhh it's still all good
Some broads got an automatic thickness for eight
You'll soon get it, just stay workin hard at it
Goodness gracious, good God almighty
You got a badoonka donk, girl don't hurt nobody!
Toes all painted, feet all out
It's an aphrodisiac for the mall without a doubt
Juicy chunky stanky funky
Gut slappin ball slappin cater to your every fantasy
You got your tongue clitoris tits and belly pierced (all that?)
Necklace around yo' waist toe rings - girl do yo' thang!
I mean, in them jeans yo shape is BEAUTIFUL!
And I'm ""For You, By You"" like FUBU (bitch you know the name)
Whoo-wee Jesus JoJo K-Ci and Mary
Girl you don't know what you do to me (lord have mercy!)
Ain't no doubt about it, when she walk by
Tongues hang out, eyes pop out the socket (BING!)
Cats cringe and point like pssh
Ummph you can see that thang from the front
We gas those up like, full service
And, keep 'em drunk like Kathie Lee Curtis
And when you shake it, you rock my world
I done died and went to heaven, you got a fatty girl!

Dear Hip Hop,Exit 13,2008.0,"""You better stop foolin if you want to get along with me""
True
""We grew up on the block, and we know about poverty""
Do you?
Dear hip-hop, I apologize for how you've been treated
I should've fought for my culture, instead I retreated
The game is wounded, I stood and watched while they beat it
My culture starved, I refused to feed it
They sold you for a dollar like slaves in iron collars
A*R's chase you with bloodhounds and rottweilers
You went to the highest bidder, you was pissed on like kitty litter
But far from a quitter, but there's somethin to consider
Nah, after much deliberation
I decided I'm the hottest cat to ever receive rotation
I'm the foundation, one of the chief architects
Of this dream we're all chasin, I had to speak up
Too much time was wastin WHOA~! So here we go
I'm tired of the money talk and the, bitches and hoes
Everybody's always, soundin the same
I have to walk on water I can't, drown in the game

""Hip-Hop, was set out in the dark"" {*3X*}
""They used to do it out in the park""

I remember your bar mitzvah, that burgundy label
Me and Jam Master had the battle of the big cables
Before the Serratos, real vinyls, real tables
Skills was the motto, no hype, no fables
You seemed so happy, you loved me so much
You popped off and went platinum, at my slightest touch
Oversized hoodies, Yukon trucks
20 years later, it's like lightning struck
They're worshipin the money, they're prayin to the bank
They danced on slaveship, slept as it sank
The devil made 'em do it, but only God do I thank
Because we aren't done yet, there's still gas in the tank
You look in a man's eyes, that's how you really tell his rank
Not the size of his account, check him, he might bounce
It's all on the line, this time it really counts
I'll bleed for this one, on down to the last ounce


They rent a crib they're frontin, they rent a car they're stuntin
They rent a chain they're bluffin, that's why the culture's sufferin
And even if you're a millionaire that don't mean nothin
Unless you build your community and encourage some unity
Too much ego... too much posin
If he's so hot then, why's the culture frozen?
It's time for a change, the order needs to be rearranged
And this song was pre-ordained
After 2 long decades, LL still remains
And you can blame it on my spirit, not on my brains
Time to put on my armor, go to war for the game
Cause it's on its last leg, and that's more than a shame
This is a lifestyle homey, it's more than champagne
But I will make a toast to Flash reachin the Hall of Fame
I end it with a line, from the book of King James
Let there be light when I write graffiti on the train


Let us proclaim the mystery and fame
I pray the Lord my culture be saved
If hip-hop dies before I awake
May Jam Master Jay cut a LL break",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-dear-hip-hop-lyrics
I’ve Changed,Todd Smith,2006.0,"Just starin at these four walls closin
In on me, feelin like time's frozen
Fadin in and out, noddin and dozin
Guilt tearin up my brain like erosion
What I did to you was wrong I admit it
I regret that I did it like a junkie when he's jonzin
All alone in what used to be a home
But you packed up our joy in that bag you put your clothes in
The voicemail that you left me was scoldin
Hot enough to burn a hole in a cauldron
Cause it was all true, that's why we all through
Now your girl's pickin up the cell when I call you
Talkin slick like she ain't here
She don't want you no more, punk disappear - click
I need to hit her with a brick
But that'll only lead me to a worse predicament
I hope your girlfriend ain't got you on a liquor binge
With her bitter attitude just cause she's sick of men
But I'ma keep on callin, fightin 'til the end
On my knees 'til they bleed, to prove my love again

I sit in front of yo' crib in the pourin rain
Whylin out screamin yo' name
And keepin ringin yo' bell 'til you mad as hell
And call the po'-po', I ain't afraid (yeah, yeah)
You can get yo' folks and yo' cousins and them
And try to run me off yo' blocka (uh-huh)
But I ain't scared, I ain't goin nowhere
And I ain't stoppin 'til I gotcha
To show you I changed shawty

I seen you at the movies with some tall cat
So I bust his headlights with a ball bat
When I was with you he would give me dap and all that
Now you in his arms in the mall, what you call that?
That's what I get for creepin and crawlin
Every other weekend gone until the mornin
Sneakin out to my dirt, dead wrong
Comin back past dawn with the guilty mask on
And I never counted the cost, took heed to warnings
Try to hurt a rose you get pricked by a thorn
And it don't feel nice, when you wake up nights
Shakin in cold sweats and your whole life's a wreck
That was the old me, the one I still regret
The one you couldn't respect, the one you should forget
But I'ma keep on callin, fightin 'til the end
On my knees 'til they bleed, to prove my love again

I really did change shawty (I'M TELLIN YOU I'VE CHANGED)
I wanna show you I changed shawty

I don't care if the cops got me surrounded
SWAT teams whatever, tell 'em to send the hounds in
My mind's in an altered state
Like I'm headed for a wall, top speed, foot off the brake
I make a fool of myself, girl whatever it takes
I already played the fool when I let you escape
You're as, good as it gets, your friendship your sex
Everything about you and yours connects
From your, beautiful smile to the scent of your skin
The sheets smell different, this is not livin
It feels like dyin, God knows I'm tryin
Ain't no sight sadder than a grown man cryin
Please find it in your heart to forgive me
Realize only God can convict me
We all make mistakes, so have you
If God show mercy on me, then you should too

You know, oh, how love goes, say it again
When I cry, baby, you cry
We cry, baby, it's like
You know, oh, how love goes, just how love goes

However it go, I'm going out for you, girl
I'mma stick up kid, I'm pulling out for you, girl
If I was hustling, I pump coke for you, girl
I I was a dread, then I smoke for you, girl
I play captain, rock the boat for you, girl
I play Martin and bring hope to you, girl
When I was away, look how I wrote to you, girl
Wasn't I polite, when I spoke to you, girl
Tripped on you, copped that coat for you, girl
I do anything but go broke for you, girl
Since I'm a rapper I wrote a song for you, girl
If I'm a gun clapper I keep 'em warm for you, girl
Lift some weights and keep it hard for you, girl
Sunday morning pray to God for you, girl
If that don't work catch a charge for you, girl
I flips them bars, become a star for you, girl

If I was a pastor I'd preach for you, girl
If I was a hand, then I'd reach for you, girl
Grab a broom and sweep the streets for you, girl
Become the president and get impeached for you, girl
I keep having these visions in my mind
Now sense no reason no rhyme
Schizophrenia, it's hard to define
Life's a mountain for you I'm ready to climb
Become the sun, for you I shine
Much more than all your other guys combined
So you can tell 'em all to wait in line
Cause a crime of passions still a crime
Life ain't a movie, girl, you can't rewind
But I play any role, just to make you mine
Even in your mirror you a one of a kind
And I don't need, nobody else to co-sign
(Chorus)

There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
I cook and clean when it come to you
I, keep it locked, don't ever fear
When it comes to my man I'mma be right here
He would hustle when his times were tough
And never left me stranded, it was all about us
You can't tell me wrong, you kept money strong
The drops just what you need to be like by

Life is good when it's me and you together
And when there's drama then I'mma do whatever
Keep it warm in a stormy cold weather
Leave you broken and lonely, oh never
Every word that I say is so clever
When you feel it in your heart it gets you much wetter
I am the original go getter
I don't waste time fronting, I go get her
Stare at the devil and won't blink for you, girl
Change the way that I think for you, girl
Put it on paper, waste the ink for you, girl
Walk through the desert without a drink for you, girl
Central booking, rock pink for you, girl
Step in quicksand and sink for you, girl
Whatever the obstacle, I'mma leap for you, girl

Strictly Business,Strictly Business (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),1991.0,"Verse 1:
Back in the days I made up my mind
That I would be a king, you know, genuine
Reign supreme at the top of the heap
And like working all day, no time to sleep
Destined to rise, in front of your eyes
So we surmise, it's time for the prize
The time has come, we gotta be number one
The world is full of power and we got to get some
No more beggin and useless teardrops
So I'm trading these teardrops for props
Goin' all the way and with my powerful team
Conquering the world and I'ma rise like cream
All out, putting heads to bed
Cause I'm a grown man and I hate to get spoon-fed
Wisdom, son, I rose in the east
Till we reach the top, won't be no peace, cause it's
Chorus:
Strictly business, strictly business
Ain't no way I'm gonna stop
Strictly business, ain't no time to get more
Gotta make it to the top
Verse 2:
Everything we do, gotta be brand new
The moves we make, gotta make the earth shake
Sitting at my desk, cause I manifest to my team
Big plans that'll make us the best
Cause we can rule this game we all play
Pop champagne and make everyday a holiday
Smooth as a rose but hard like steel
From now on, I'ma make my dreams real
On a mission, gotta get there
If you wanna rule, you gotta be in there
Our masterplan is the best
And ain't a man alive that'll beat us to a conquest
Cause this is the reason we was born
To rock on and on and on and on
Look at my eyes, it's hypnotizing
Word is bond, we gotta keep on rising
Chorus
Strictly business, life is hard to handle
Ain't no way I'm gonna stop
Strictly business, ain't no time to get more
Gotta make it to the top
Verse 3:
I'ma be a legend in all the books and mags
Stuffin' the cash inside garbage bags
Ain't no time to waste, we gotta motivate
Pass anybody that stops to get gas
Forever and a day, my destiny's set
No sweat, I make it rougher than rougher gets
Hold on tight, if not, get blown away
Pick up the pieces 'cause we're known to say
Radical things to get a champion's ring
Give it up, punk, don't make me swing
We planned ahead to get the butter and the bread
Dressed in black and I'm stayin' out the red
So when it comes to like taking charge
Get props for where they do and stop frontin' on tar
Gotta go for what you know to be the cream of the crop
With the power of God, I'ma rise to the top, it's
Chorus
Strictly business, life is hard to handle
Ain't no way I'm gonna stop

I was in Madrid yo
Had this hot club shootin my video
They was burnin up the floor to that reggaeton
Estaba bailando soon as they put the record on
I was sweatin like a bullfighting matador
It was the sexiest scene that I ever saw
(La fiesta, tu mi a fuego)
But I was still cool in my light blue Kangol
I met this girl, she was off the chain yo
Cooley head model from San Diego
Father was from Trinidad, Tobago
Mother was from Rio, de Janeiro
She said please don't think I'm crazy
But I've been in love with you since the 80's
{?} cansando baby
Have you ever been with a latin lady?

Uhh, she said there's one thing you should know
(Just here to find to numero uno)
Uh-huh (and I'll do anything to prove it)
(If I can get wit'cha)
Uhh, she said there's one thing you should know
(Just here to find to numero uno)
Uh-huh (and there's so much I would do if)
(If I can get wit'cha)

She said I wanna get wit'cha
I'm talkin more than an autograph and picture
(Tu quiere, benita mi casa)
I mumbled to myself, she's a monster
She said (yo no se lo que no habla)
Don't worry 'bout it lil' mama nada
The chemistry and energy was gettin hotter
This ain't like me but I feel like I gotta
She started movin near me
Whispered in my ear so I could hear more clearly
Said grab my waist and look in the mirror
Then started windin it like Shakira
All that shakin and belly dancin
I was goin under, I ain't stand a chance man
If I do this, will I love it or regret it
Tempted and I don't know where this is headed


(Wit'cha, wit'cha) Uhh (uhh)
Yeah (si papi, uhh)
(If I can get wit'cha)
(Si papi, si) Uh-huh
(Papi) If I can't get wit'cha
Then she kept beggin sayin let's go
Pullin on my arm, wouldn't let go
Rubbin my face, kissin my neck slow
Muy dulce, hanblando con carino
She said (ooh papi te quiero mucho)

Fall back under my wing
Let go of my mind, let it swing
Let em wait
Body language is how we communicate
I know it felt good, let it marinate
Multiple O's, increase your heart rate
So relax
I put my lips on every inch of your back
Lookin good, I got plans for that
It's my pleasure to fall into your trap

Massaging your ears, you like that
I bite your bottom lip, you bite back
I know it's good, I don't need you to tell me that
Kiss yo neck
Ignore the main spot getting wet
Pressure's built up high as it can get
So we flows like the pilot, press the jet
Let it stretch
For all the times you seduced me in the tracks
All the chasin I did so you can catch
Now all I do is shine and move back

Kissing with your fingers in my mouth
I'm taking all different routes
Discovering the ins and the outs
You slide to the couch
I wanna see what that love seat is about
Work it til it looks like a pout
Too many climaxes to count
Love your world baby, yea it was born lately
Did a 1-80, crazy
There's something about the way you do
The things you do
And when you do, oh tell me
I don't wanna go outside

I just wanna lay here with my arms around you night and day

Baby, no need to ask questions
'Cause you already know the answer
Keep it between these sheets
These sheets, these sheets
Ah ah yea

I won't tell nobody baby, you can trust me
You swearin that it's good, I'm thinkin it must be
I'm kissin on your thighs, relax, don't rush me
Let me take my time, make your pretty face ugly
Hands by your side, stop tryin to touch me
Let me soak it in, breathe, you smellin lovely
Kiss yo belly button, and fill it with bubbly
Take a taste, let it drip down your waste
Have it all over my face, outer body experience like you're floating out of space
Come back down gently
Grind your hips on me, you set with the melody
And let the words that I say live on in your memory

I'm a tell you a lil secret

Baby, no need to ask questions

Eye contact, kiss me, I kiss back
Right there, I miss that, I can't resist that
And I'll be climbing up over walls and ignoring all of my calls
Stuff all the things, pause, 'cause you're giving me your all
But I never had a lover make me feel this real
Hold it up in the room, all night, all day
All week I'm strung out like a freak
Got me tapping on my arm for a fix

Work you out to this beat, it's just you and me in the suite
My tongue is all on your feet, sheets covering me
I'm kissing all that I see, exactly how it should be

When he texts 911 don't hit him back
She's getting her box packed, she's not calling black
Like how you worry, you call that
Rock my T shirt, doggy style for dessert
L Cool TSA, rubbing on your skirt
Herm that Berkin, I'm your job – baby go to work
Poppin a old school tape with Red Alert
Let me do what I do, be a trooper, let it hurt

Baby your man's through, he don't understand you
Treat you like a dirty van dude, that he ran through
Never ever romantic, no incense or candles
Basically you're too much for him to handle
That's when I came through, baby my aim's too
Make you feel like every dream you ever had came true
Sometimes you know that sometimes you're an angel
Hand up and down, making sounds with your paingrells
You know my style, hitting from all angles
Staring at your arches while your flip flop stable
Nagging me, reminding me to remain true
I ain't going outside, I gotta stay in you

Chanel's my standard, no bitch you'll never outlast me
Free to be a bad girl even though you classy
Get behind closed doors, sweaty, be trashy
Scream all night til yo wind pipes rasby
You need a leading man, I'm a movie, cast me
Your ex gives me dirty looks when he pass me
See, that's what happens when you swagging on that

For Old Timers, do you remember the names?
Like Bronco Nagurski and Nightrain Lane
Bulldog Turner, my man Sam Huff
In the snow and mud, they were still real tough
Crazylegs Hirsch and remember Raymond Berry?
Ask me if they hit hard and I’ll say “Very!”
Paul Christian, Buddy Young, Lenny Moore
It’s them I adore, they seem to always score
Ed Sprinkle, defensive end for those years
Gene “Big Daddy” Lipscomb was the man to fear
You had Steven Van Buren and Otto Graham
Johnny Unitas had the arm of a Superman
We had Charley Trippi and Gino Marchetti
If you’re searching for a champion, they’re your best bet!
Wish I could quarterback like Johnny Lujack
Or even Sid Luckman as a matter of fact
Do you remember Red Grange, the Galloping Ghost
He could do a ninety-five running coast-to-coast
You had Norm Van Brocklin, a real great player
So swift with his moves that he could be mayor
Y.A. Tittle, Ollie Matson, Hey!
I remember all those guys, from back in the day

Brought a family, and dough woulda been so happily
I'll beat the Laker off of a clown and chop him down to size

A sunny beach, video hoes within reach
Farmers Boulevard - liberty and forty is gone

Don't call it a comeback!
Call it anything, don't call it a comeback!
Don't call it a comeback!
Don't call it a comeback!

Don't call it a comeback, I been here for years
Rocking my peers and putting suckas in fear
Making the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosion, overpowering
Over the competition, I'm towering
Wrecking shop, when I drop
These lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare, you better move
Don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's paying the price

I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)


Don't you call this a regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty bitty world by storm
And I'm just getting warm
Just like Muhummad Ali they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
Cause you know I had beef wit
Why do you riff with me, the maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready cause it might go
BLAAAAW, how ya like me now?
The ripper will not allow
You to get with, Mr. Smith, don't riff
Listen to my gear shift
I'm blasting, outlasting
Kinda like Shaft, so you could say I'm shafting
Olde English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme

Keep it going now, keep it going now
One more time, word
There's too much of a groove, check it out
Clap your hands
As we go into it like this here
Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio HUUUH!!!
I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw?
But now I got a new tour
I'm going insane, starting the hurricane, releasing pain
Letting you know that you can't gain, I maintain
Unless ya say my name
Ripping, killing
Digging and drilling a hole
Pass the Ol' Gold

Shotgun blasts are heard
When I rip and kill, at will
The man of the hour, tower of power, I'll devour
I'm gonna tie you up and let you understand
That I'm not your average man
When I got a jammy in my hand
DAAAAAM!!!!! Oooooohh!!
Listen to the way I slaaaaay, your crew
Damage UHH damage UHH damage UHH damage
Destruction, terror, and mayhem
Pass me a sissy so suckas I'll slay him
Farmers (What?!) Farmers (What?!)
I'm ready (We're ready!!)
I think I'm gonna bomb a town (Get down!!)
Don't you never, ever, pull my lever
Cause I explode
And my nine is easy to load
I gotta thank God
'Cause he gave me the strength to rock
Hard! Knock you out, mama said knock you out
(Repeat chorus)
Breakdown!
Word up, God bless
Now I want everyone to  like this here
This is a private affair, it's a private party
It's real close and intimate, we all in here together
Come on, say ""Leave that crack alone""
Leave that crack alone
Come on, everybody say ""Leave that crack alone""
Leave that crack alone

After the afterparty we'll be gettin it in
Pause for a drink then we cuttin again

Let it ride, no hands, then touch it again

Rotatin bed, watchin it spin

I'mma touch your little button, I'mma flip the switch (ay!)
I'mma turn you on like a ra-d-io
Turn the lights out, plug me in
Come and turn me on like a ra-d-io

I request her at night, she's my favorite song
I'm the station, and the only one she cum on
Heavy rotation, all night long
Rap to me baby, turn my mic on
I kill it like Summer Jam when I perform
Treat your body like a stage, jump right on
I got your spot packed, tight as my song
Hands in the air, spotlight on

Nobody hot as me, no, way
I keep heat for y'all, all, day

You was hatin on the bars but you lovin 'em down
You assumed I was soft - I'm thuggin it, WOW~!

All We Got Left is the Beat,14 Shots to the Dome,1993.0,"Ey, ey, check it out homie
Man, you need to get up out of this spot man
And get a job man before you get smoked man
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah son...)
I know you don't wanna hear it man
But, ey, man, wait, hold up loc. you got company man
(where's my guns?)

When I'm ridin' on the street I hear gunshots (rare shots)
(swear) crack niggas cause they moms missed flips
So black man really care about politics
In the ninety's, our governments so slick
I watch CNN sometimes and I realize
They're playin' tricks on my mind
They want a man to work with his hands
Too young to die, and they don't give a damn
Rare-momma got down on her knees
But not no more, god damn it, I make cheese
I'm on the move and I'ma show and prove
You might cry to my political groove
Rest in peace, Sauce Brothers underneath
I love you to death while my beats' like a reef
In the middle of the night on the city streets
The only thing we got left is the beat

All we got left is the beat, is the beat, yo
All we got left is the beat, huh, give it to me
All we got left is the beat, the beat, yo
All we got left is the beat, uh

Who brings guns into the USA?
And then makes sure that they come around the way
Gain the points until the whole race traps
And teach up my woman that she should call up the cops
The projects are hell, wait a, minute
There's nothin' we do but ride on top of an elevator
Say the clubs, I can't get a job
Mouth to feed, somebody's gettin' robbed
I ain't worked, but I ain't workin' for crumbs
You ever seen a man-shelter?
Check out the bombs!!!
Brother of pain, their whole lives are over
They spent every dime tryin' not to be sober
And all the ladies got bags of clothes
They'll be your long lost momma, one never knows
The streets are like a nightmare
While the presidents secretary is chillin' in his leather chair

All we got left is the beat, is the beat, yo
All we got left is the beat, give it to me
All we got left is the beat, the beat, yo
All we got left is the beat, uh

Lemon to a lime, lime to a lemon
When you need a toga-black, hire black linen
Your rippers' man applause when he can't get a job
He gets up all of his family and feels like a slob
The black women don't understand
Cause they don't realize what it is to be a black man
In the mornin', a brother feels like a jerk
Seein' black women and white men go to work
So all women fear, the brothers ain't real
Cause they won't give us no jobs, that's the real deal
Hold my hand while I get it all together
They don't deserve me at times of bad weather
Cause I'ma make it out the concrete walls
And there's another way besides basketball
Let me go, let me do what I do
I'm red, black and green, then red, white and blue

All we got left is the beat, is the beat, yo
All we got left is the beat, give it to me
All we got left is the beat, is the beat, yo
All we got left is the beat, uh, give it to me

Ridin' in the street you can feel the city heat
A little bit of grass and a whole lot of concrete
Creepin' - I'm standin' on the corner
And you can get robbed if you wanna
Paybacks a mother on the street
You're seein' gold teeth, ya hearin' funky beats
Brothers ride by real slow
You get leary when they got tinted windows
Sittin' on the steps with a blunt
I'm drinkin' Valentine, I wasn't raised up front
My Aunt Ellie always talked about God
Tell me you never cried cause its so hard
Government got a hell of a plan
But word is born they ain't destroyin' this black man

All we got left is the beat, is the beat, yo
All we got left is the beat, give it to me
All we got left is the beat, is the beat, yo
All we got left is the beat, uh, give it to me
All we got left is the beat, is the beat, yo

Speedin’ on Da Highway/Exit 13,Exit 13,2008.0,"Speedin on the highway
Starin at the white lines we rollin, we rollin (white lines)

High speed baby!
It's two o'clock in the mornin, I'm stompin down on the pedal
Look at my ring on the steering wheel and my ice on the bezel
I made a promise to God that I would run from the devil
When the engine is gunnin I'm on a whole other level
White lines connected, I'm livin life like a rebel
My competition is chokin inside my dust when it settle
Baby look at me now, I'm just a kid from the ghetto
But I'm on top of my hustle, I move the bass and the treble
And I go at your generation, I'm runnin this era
Ain't no lookin behind me, my system shakin the mirror
Top speed in the Beamer, my head boppin to ""Ether""
I'm on I-95, clutch burnin the reefer
Everybody that rides with me becomes a believer
Cause I come from the hood, but I think like a Caesar
Went from 0 to 60, four deep in the Bentley
Hell yeah I be speedin, that's why niggas resent me; ugh~!


Yeah, uhh
I said to hell with the past, it's time to live for the future
Make the muffler backfire and pop like a Ruger
Don't have the slightest idea 'bout who you ridin with do ya?
Just keep your eye on the white lines, feel 'em goin through ya
Between the lines my mind works like a normal computer
My adrenaline's rushin like I've been dodgin the shooter
I get surgical on the road every line is a suture
And you must be a operator if niggas dispute ya
Peelin off in a hurry, there ain't no reason to worry
Anybody that challenges me is gonna get buried
12 cylinders gunnin the whole world has become a
Grill low to the ground, like a bull when it's runnin
My Lamborghini is hummin, it sings a tune to your woman
So if you make me slow down, I'm peelin off wit'cha onion
You need to stop all the frontin under your hood there ain't nothin
You know the Exit is 13, come see if I'm bluffin


Uhh!

Exactly! When we in the car we 22'd up
When we in the big truck we 24'd up, y'knahmean?
When you see me ridin, real fast, your job, is to stay back
Pre-bumper - behind the bumper fam! Alright?
Do not race in front of me
I should not be able to see, your license plate
That means there's somethin wrong here

This is the biggest decision I ever made in my life
You do a hundred miles an hour on the highway at night
You go to fasten your seatbelt and make sure that it's tight
Because I'm rippin the paws just like I'm rippin the mic
Baby I'm pushin the limits as if I'm racin a bike
Tell the highway patrol no need to chase me tonight
The way I'm doin my thang it's like I'm up in a plane
I hit the stick in the rain, I guess I'm sick in the brain
Rocks hittin the frame, you think the shit is a game
But I'm ready for anybody that steps in my lane
And I know you afraid, no reason to be ashamed
Nobody's crashin my party I'm mashin out on these lames
I devoured the cowards and there is no doubt about it
All these niggas are too gassed, they can't run without it
Tried to give me a flat tire, I wouldn't allow it
I left y'all in the dust nigga, I'm too high-powered!


Exactly! When you see us, fast lane middle lane slow lane
It's all the same thing y'knahmean? We go fast
We got a lot of big wheels on our cars, it's what we do
Aight? When you see us, you salute the kingpins, the generals
That's us, y'knahmean?
And matter of fact, we gon' jump off the Bridge right now
When you see L, THIS JOINT'S IN FUCKIN EFFECT!!!!
I've been DYIN to say that~!
I've been DYIN to say that, eighty-six nigga!
You know what it is man, first album
Ten million, no fuckin video, yo LL was THERE!
I WARN YOU! You gotta STOP!
There's too many questions and not enough answers
Too many questions, mind your business knahmean?
This is grown shit right here, aight?
When you see us, we do this for a living
I've been doin this for a fuckin minute!!!
Yo I've been dyin to talk crazy on a L record

You was reminiscin and wishin
For L to deliver what the game's been missin
Beast that knock rhymes that lock with precision
Hot like when Pac first popped out of prison
Two schools of thought headed for a collision
Did it big for a minute then you lost yo vision
Skinny jeans, a wedgy and a dance rendition
Tycoons wouldn't choose that mission
These cats is all hyped, that's why I don't listen
I'm too tank fittin right, I see ya'll slippin
Ain't no hate love, nah I ain't trippin
Still love jewelry and champagne sippin
Bank roll healthy, ice is still sickening
Couldn't get fresh if you broke up, get slicking
We Diddy bop, ya'll out here skippin
Baby just ignore these fools, they trippin

Models in the backseat burnin

I had the same girl that I have today
And that's not something most of these cats could say
Your whole hand's different than you're payin, a mistake
Now some of ya'll gonna feel some kind of weight
That's yo prop in which you, you know how we play
Grown, we're the bad, grinding all day
Fool, you got a edge when you take that away baby
The moment of truth and the jacuzz on
Like that news, play some rhythm and blues
Worry bout the water baby, leave on your shoes
Toast to the gold, my heart don't lose
Give it up

Couldn't give a damn if a young boy's my fan
Long as his mama 2 step to my jam
While she cleanin up her house, mop in her hand
It's how I changed the game, now you understand?
I got that old money, weak rubber bands
Cats playin themselves, getting out of hand
Show two features to chase teenage fans
Well I got it right, I cram to understand
How you trendy shorty, L's a brand
Raised on hip-hop, the grownup fans
Hands in the air, rocking in a stance
I've been made, ain't no making of the bands
Save the techno and glow sticks for Disneyland
I'm sayin 5 features on every other jam
You like them? Listen to em, we don't give a damn

When the whips come out, you know just what I'm 'bout

You should get you some - when you walkin in the presence of hustlers

Been teachin 'em how to ball since Mike went ""Off the Wall""

Have them candles and flowers by that bodega store
Life's about choices so choose homeboy

Don’t Take it Personal,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Girl)
Hey nigga what yo hood like?
(Guy)
Money come, money go, but it's alright
In the club, stay crunk right
Drama pop, you pop the truck, get them pumped right?
(Repeat)

I am the most incredible
I ain't disrespectin, just spittin my track record
Way before 'Pac and B.I.G., I did it big
Way before Hova, LL was a casanova
Way before Nas, I had my first menage
Way before T.I., I taught him how to be fly
Way before Nelly, I was up in the telly
Before J.D., I was 'Jingling Baby'
Before Lil' Jon, I put the south on
Before Ludacris, Ya boy was doin this
Before Snoop Dogg, I put rappers in the morgue
Before Dr. Dre, I was hot in L.A
Before 50 Cent, I was sittin on ends
A young buck ridin in a 560 Benz


I been doin this a long time man, I'm tired of gettin money
On second thought...
Before Master P, I was bout it bout it B
Before Cash Money, I already stashed money
Before DMX, I was wild on the set
Momma said knock 'em out, I lay 'em on the deck
Before Wu Tang, I was the new thang
I whispered on shorty ear before Ying Yang
Before Mobb Deep, I had 'em shook over the beat
Years before Busta, I had my first customer
I was little L before Big L
Before E-40, my name, shit was naughty
Before Diddy, all my whips was pretty
Lil' wild nigga from Queens runnin through the city


But I can't talk too greasy
Gotta keep it real, ya know
Grandmaster was flashin way before I cashed in
Ya man Bambaata made the park jams hotter
Ya man Elle El couldn't go outside
When ya boy Melle Mel had the pimped out ride
Way before me, Kurtis Blow stacked dough
He ruled the world, I was in the front row
Run-D.M.C. showed me what I wanna be
I got kicked out the studio by Kool Moe Dee
The Cold Crush Four and the Treacherous Three
Ain't give a damn about a snotty nose kid like me
Houdhini, The Fat Boys and all that
I hit 'em on the jack, them niggas never called back",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-dont-take-it-personal-lyrics

While your brother come and erve, can't get em bag of chips
No clear necessary when Im leaning in the risk
Thou remaining the fold building baby is fighting over kicks
And find em in this frizzy, that why you talk slick
Every time you try to ball its like the world sets some ?
I see the pain in your eyes, when you alone you cry
Buff south and drink liquor for the once that die
I use to be just like you
Doffing back with the watchful
When the projects on my way to see a chick
Thats on the Bible
Grand mama pray for me, my mama slave for me
I work to become a master as cool as Jay Sourly

But my man got knock
He was divide intervention when the blows got back
Wasn't no loyal on my street
Wasn't no doctors on my block
Sometime I couldn't sleep thinking bout how got shot
I will hit gun shots, house I crack spots
Catch diam and getting main for gold chain
And get yourself a ring
No legend Stevie, I wander why your visions blurry
Fast lean to pain, want the meds and the hurry
One is the knowledge, two is the wisdom
Three the understand and four to catch your ? hope you God listen
Probably quality, godless build
Destroy before you born like analogy in this side for kills
Every day like hit rappers getting in plane
Is hard on the brick, say no more fucking holidays
Pow your head sownty

I got the school all locked I got the hit full on block
And I just told my brother, he ain't gotta sell no rack
Remember rocks in the sap, pay the block with the glop
I just try to get a mil, I will be on top
They told me hustles dont sleep
Too busy chasing that guap
So I ain't gonna sleep, I go chasing that guap
And I ain't stop until hit the top
And I came from nothing, I gotta get to the money
Cuz my family hungry
Can't wait to show that world that Imma be on that stage
Imma make it just to put a smile on my mamma face
And this struggle got me stressing
Need a mil plan from the city where nigga shutting case ery day

Remember Me,Authentic,2013.0,"Eh yo L! L! Check this out
I know you doing out all thinin' thing, right?
But I was talkin' to Suga Daddy
He said ""Why don't you do somethin' for the culture?""
""Why don't you ring it back to the Bentleys""
""That old school club, not the car.""
By the way, can I hold your show?
Got applause for the liquors that ain't here
We said some when the people caught up to the struggle
Yeah. Bottom to the top
But we ain't forget you
Let's ride
I've been tryna find my way
Not with all this hurt and pain
I try to bread in that and all the high...
Machines

This one for those who feel ignored
My man, Rockstarr getting hit at the board
People boostin' the stores that they can't afford
For my grandmother tellin' me to ""Remember the lord""
For all my gangsta that died by the sword
We use to smoke blunt to the back of Encore
Drive up town, I like ten cars or more
Tryin' to see some that we never seen before
For them kids in new town, and new gun laws
That would easily pass if that kid was yours
These are the side effects, what's the cause?
At a minimum, we got to put the shit on pause

Whoa! Every grounds
Remember me!
Do you remember me, Do you remember me
Do you remember me, Do you remember me
Do you remember me, Do you remember me

Now his baby has a baby and he still ain't home
He cryin' in his cell when he all alone
Wishin he can call up god on the phone
Enough turn a good man his heart is stone
Make his baby mama drank patron
Hipnotic Hustlers ride in chrome
Motherfuckers read like Donna Boy's Poem
For 9/11 for the building's fall
For the misguided minds thats burning in hell
For the cats at the corner got hopes to sell
But never hit the number it never could post bail

Happy, you know what I am sayin'

It's like a milestone in my career, it's just
An opportunity to just show the world
That you can do anything you put your mind to
Because I mean, you know
It just kind of makes me think about when I first signed to

Can't really murder with slang to swerve lane to lane

Healy ""Bang bang"", hail to the motherfuckin' cows
Come home an' city slicker dough
In italiano bravissimo
You know I come back like the crow
""Blink Blink"" that's the sound of the man who came to murder shit
For three thirds of this
You the mad peasant
As I sing ya' to the essence
And use a flame thrower to transmit the message
Tight I will recite from day to night
Hard shit like fuckin' up a father with a pipe
Crazy all my life swazy with ya wife
Tony Montana with my fingers in your dyke
Like my platinum triple
My honeys quadruple
A room full of dangerous minds with no scruple
Watch them subliminal transfliction to criminals
Better show respect! You keep your game original
Fuck face! You ignorant idiot

Never underestimate my greediness
Quick to murder shit is switched to a alias

Ich hör' nur RaRa und BlahBlah
Komm gar nicht klar - klar
Das is'n Drama, dass jeder redet und voll keinen Plan hat
NaDa - das is nicht mein Ding muss euch was beibringen
Der Schein stinkt, bin kein Feigling is' nicht mein Karma
Ich 'spit' 'Raps' auf 'Tracks' wie auf's Plattenbiz
Und meine Scheiße trifft im Rampenlicht und auch da, wo Schatten ist
Die Welt ist 'Talkshow-Shit', für mich voll Horrortrip
Und manchmal weiß ich nicht wohin, warum, womit
Aber es ist so 'for real'
Jeder kann's spüren und fühlen
Dass wir nur misstrauen, nicht träumen und uns nichts mehr berührt
Ich schieb schon Paras, bei den Psychos vor meiner Tür
Hör' den Taxifahrer nebenan mit Waffen trainieren
'ClickClack'
Bleib' auf Distanz aus Angst
Weil diese Welt aus Geldgier mit dem Teufel tanzt
Hab' mich in meinem Hirn verschanzt und schieß' zurück
Meine Munition ist meine Meinung, die euch tief bedrückt
Habe Argusaugen, die alles beäugen da draußen
Die alles sehen und mitnehmen, doch nicht alles glauben
Ich halte Sachen am Laufen bewegen zum Überleben
Weil das Fadenkreuz das Ziel nicht erfasst
Geht jeder Schuss daneben
Mörder gibt's überall, Zerstörer gibt's überall
Klone und Kopien machen Alarm, getarnt als Original
Wir kochen alle mit Wasser und atmen die gleiche Luft
Der Unterschied ist nur, der eine macht, der andere versucht

""Gotta stay on some strong shit""
""You don't like it so I guess we gotta conflict""

"Rock the Bells (12"" version)",UnKnown,UnKnown,"L.L. Cool J. is hard as hell
Battle anybody I don't care who you tell
I excel, they all fail
I'm gonna crack shells, Double-L must rock the bells
You've been waitin' and debatin' for oh so long
Just starvin' like Marvin for a Cool J. song
If you cried and thought I died, you definitely was wrong
It took a thought, plus I brought Cut Creator along
Evened up with E-Love down with the Cool J. force
Symbolizin' in the rhymin' for the record of course
I'm a tower full of power with rain and hail
Cut Creator scratch the record with his fingernail
Rock the bells
The king of crowd rockers finally is back
My voice is your choice as the hottest wax
True as a wizard, just a blizzard, who ain't taken no crap
I'm rhymin' and designin' with your girl in my lap
The bass is kickin' always stickin' cause you like it that way
You take a step because it's def and plus it's by Cool J
Cut Creator on the fader, my right-hand man
We rock the bells so very well cause that's the name of this jam
Rock the bells
Some girl's will like this jam and some girls won't
Cause I make a lot of money and your boyfriend don't
L.L. went to hell, gonna rock the bells
All you washed up rappers wanna do this well
Rock the bells
Now I'm world-wide known, whether you like it or not
My one man band is Cut Creator a.k.a. Philpot
He'll never skip it, only rip it when he's on the fader
What's my d.j.'s name, Cut Creator
Now you know the episode who's on the wheels
He'll drive the cross fader like a cut mobile
So precise with a slice that you know he's greater
What's my d.j.'s name, Cut Creator
Now you know, what do you know, Earl roles the weed
I go to the store and get Old Gold
So all you crabby lookin' nappy headed girls get back
Cause there's a ten to one chance that you might get smacked
Rock the bells
The bells are circulatin' like the blood in your veins
Why are girlies on the tip, L.L.'s your name
Cut Creator's good, Cool J. is good-good
You bring the wood pecker, I'll bring the wood
The bells are wippin' and rippin' at your body and soul
Why do you like Cool J., we like rock and roll
Cause it ain't the glory days with Bruce Springsteen
I'm not a virgin so I know I'll make Madonna scream
You hated Michael and Prince all the way, ever since
If their beats were made of meat, then they would have to be minced
Rock the bells
So listen to the lines of rhyme, I rhyme on time
He'll cut the record in a second, make your d.j. look blind
So all you jerry-curl suckers wearin' high-heel boots
Like ballerinas, what I mean is you're a fruit-loop troop
All you gonna-bes, wanna-bes, when will you learn
Wanna be like Cool J., you gotta wait your turn
Some suckers don't like me, but I'm not concerned
Six-g's for twenty minutes is the pay I earn
I'm growin' and glowin' like a forest blaze
Do you like Michael Jackson, we like Cool J
That's right, I'm on the mic with the help of the bells
There's no delayin' what I'm sayin' as I'm rockin' you well

Yessssss, he willlllll
Ohhh, I do believe that we will make it
Yeahhh, yeahhh, yeahhh, yeahhhh

Uhh uhh
I was at rock bottom, my whole life was mo' problems
Reincarnation of a slave pickin cotton
Stress beamin down like the sun I felt rotten
To the core, was at war, cause the enemy is plottin
I hear him knockin, sayin that we got him
Hot like solar, he wanna burn my soul up
World on my shoulders but I roll back ya boulders
Words have a funny way of comin back to scold ya
Watch what come out of your mouth, you crack a molar
I tried to told ya, hehehe
Enemies gunnin, true believers ain't runnin
Or duckin, we ain't scared of nuttin, ya feel me?
They wanna test me and press my buttons, oh really?
Allow Uncle L to hip y'all to somethin, uhh, uhh
Yeah, uhh, check it out
There's a living power, make a man out a coward
Rebuild your strength like the new Trade Towers
I thought that I was over, my life got devoured
Now I'm on top and I pray for all the doubters
Time to shout it, sing it louder

Yeahhhhh, we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it (we're gonna make it)
Thank God we made it (yeahhhhhhhhhhh)
And I mean it, yeah yeah, oh yeah

I was feelin like my whole world was spinnin and spillin
On the ground and that God wasn't willin
It seemed like the only ones ballin was the villains
Dollar signs in they eyes, lyin to our chill'un
I wanna kill 'em, I'd rather God hit 'em
They sellin venom and we buyin it like denim
These world wide webs they weave, we caught in 'em
Old folks is dyin and CEO's skimmin
The bat's in your hand and this is the 9th inning
Keep your eyes on the ball when you swingin
Don't be confused, don't be fooled by the wind-up
Start switchin your position, make your mind up
Pull your bootstraps tight, get your grind up
Get your life lined up before time's up
Yo, yo, you know what?
Take ten percent of that, dough you tryin to stack
Send it up to God, I guarantee he send it back
Multiply it by a hundred times, y'all remember that
That's just a little jewel to get the monkey off your back
Uhh, yeah, sing it out now
 w/ ad libs
In the darkest valley, through the loneliest alley
Never give up, press on through the storm
Weepin man fall, for the night seem long
But if you stand strong joy come within the morn'
And it goes, on and on and on and on and on and-ah
I know it feels like your back's to the wall
Who's sittin in the crib, and you don't know who to call
(Jesus!) Hangin on a tight rope, fingers slippin off
But you ain't by yourself dawg, we all been lost
Stay on your course, carry your cross
Ain't no stoppin, got to keep it poppin
You want it, you can get it, believe me the king did it
Nothin gonna hold you back, there's no limits
I'm sent to bring truth to rap, not gimmicks
And I'm not finished, man listen
Here's the moral to the thesis, y'all cats need Jesus
He put your life back together, pick up the pieces
Word to the masses, I heard God asked us
For less fake rappers, and more real pastors
Uh-huh, uh-huh, so hereafter

We made it, we made it
Through the storm and rain, yeahhhhhhh
You can make it, yes you can
You can make it, you got me
I know you can, I know you can
I know you can, yessssss, yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I do believe we'll make it (Hallelujah!)

You’re in My Heart,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Do you remember, the first time you fell in love
The way it felt, the way it feels
Bein able to say, from the bottom of your heart
 I love you for real
Your eyes, meet; you feel your heartbeat
Palms are sweaty you can't keep still
And when you finally touch 'em, and hug 'em and kiss 'em
.. OOOOOOH what a thrill!
You was always searchin, and finally your dream came true
They came strollin along
And you promised 'em, straight up and down sweetheart
I swear - I'll never do you wrong
Hand in hand, heart to heart
Nothin in the world could seperate the two
And even though you've only known that person for a short time
You tell 'em I love you -- you're my heart
You argue witcha parents, and they argue BACK
You're too young to be so serious
You tell 'em that's not true, I'll go on without you
And walk away aggravated and furious
You want 'em to approve, but then again it don't matter
The relationship's yours
You feel you're maturin, and hey..
You can fight your own battles and wars
You discuss it with your love and it's the same for them
So the two of you decide we're gonna weather the storm
Life is sweet, kissin caressin and huggin
And keepin each other warm
But now comes the serious part, cause love
Believe me, it ain't a easy task
We'd have one argument too many
And you'd have to ask -- am I still your heart?
Am I still your HEART or is somethin, pullin us apart
Cause baby if it is, please let me know what
You run out the door, I tell you come back
I love you - you shout out, so what?
How could you hurt me? How could you treat me
Like you never loved me, were you playing a game?
And if so, I only have one request: sit down and explain
To me, the person who treated you right, did you right
And held you tight, every night
Is there another lover in your life, that has you uptight?
Cause if it is, aww, baby, please.. don't do this to me
I'm tryin to reach you, tryin to talk to you
It's killin me -- cause you're my heart
That's right I admit it
You're my heart I refuse, to let you go
I struggle and fight for you against all odds
Get down on my knees, and pray to God
That our love is in the cards
Cause I know you're right for me
And I know I'm right for you
There's no way in the world I'll let you slip out of my hands
People say forget about it, move on
.. but see they don't understand
You're nothin to them, but you're so much to me
So much in fact that I'd give my life
To stare into your eyes and caress your face
As the priest, announces us man and wife
We'd live happily, ever after
White picket fence and the whole nine yards
And anything that anybody said
I'd disregard -- if I was still your heart
So make up your mind, cause I've made up my mind
I'm beggin you baby please come back home
I'll be tossin and turnin, as I lay in my bed
Sorrow surrounds me I can feel it in my bones
This can't be true, I'm losin you
Oh Lord have mercy, please make it alright
All I wanna do in this whole wide world.. is hold you tight
I've ripped open my heart, shed tears and cried
Now it's up to you baby, please understand
I forgive you for everything, and give you anything
Just let me take ya by the hand
And lead ya, baby I got ya
Protect you like a mother, protects a child
Now it's up to you.. I'ma call you in a little while
You're my heart",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-youre-in-my-heart-lyrics

Simon,UnKnown,2016.0,"You're the fruit and I'm the Vine
Thoughts confusing every time
See the devil in the lies
Let the healer free your mind
Don't be deceived
I couldn't love you any less
I couldn't love you any less
(Simon)
I couldn't love you any less
(Simon)
I couldn't love you any less..
First time I heard it was you
Your voice cut the flesh, right through
And I wept
Amazed at the view
The curtain was cut into two
Sunlight to heal all of the pain
Every time that I was afraid
You came and you
Stepped in and made a way
You're the fruit and I'm the Vine
Thoughts confusing every time
See the devil in the lies
Let the healer free your mind
Don't be deceived
I couldn't love you any less
I couldn't love you any less",https://genius.com/Ll-cool-j-simon-lyrics

Got an anaconda snake for them lips tonight
Baby hit the lights
That's why I can't explain the way I just keep on dropin' heat
Laughin' at competition because they can't compete

Hard to be humble when I be gunnin' from the back
My life is a movie, that's why I decided to act (Yeah)
Packin' this poetry in your ears like wax
Blowin' my celly, rollin' ya philly relax
I hit it and quit that's why they call me ""Be Back""
Cuz I might be back, might not be back
Love 'em and leave 'em lyin', deceivin' and cheatin'
And when you catch 'em you peekin' and for the knowledge you're reachin'
A painful lesson you're teachin', a sugar daddy you're seekin'
You fall in love for the weekend, just like the Garden of Eden even
You better ask Swizz how it is we do this

From the gutter to the top of the world look at my wrists

Make 'em cope the unorthodox
Cat's prayin' that I drop like a halter-top
Scatter the whole spot like I bust a shot
Half a mil in big bills baby rust a lot (Mmmmmmm)
Used to cuss a lot, when I crushed the box
The drop get more head than a barber shop
Even old people stop when L park on the block (Doodoodoodoo)
Pictures and autographs ""WE LOVE YOU"", thanks a lot
A grown ass man, got skills and what not
Anywhere I touch you girl, becomes a G-Spot

Six months ago I was cold, now I'm hot
Six months ago you was platinum, now you flopped

The club was far from empty
It was crowded at the entry
I slide right through like how I do
This girl began to tempt me
She said her name Shayeeda
I could tell her mama feed her (Yeah!)
When they tight and thick them jeans don't fit
I'm L, nice to meet ya (Uh-oh!)
I could feel my body yearning
The room just started turning
Didn't want to go out on the floor
But this girl was so determined (Uh-huh!)
My brain began to sizzle
I'm sweatin' just a little
On the dance floor in the middle
She turned around and giggled

You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man

Temptation is a mother
How we lust for one another (Yeah)
We barely know each other
Yet we're wilding like we're lovers
The air is full of passion
The strobe lights are flashin'
The hustlers throw cashin'
The bartender keeps splashin'
Her moves were so erotic (Come on)
Her gaze was so hypnotic (Come on)
I begged this girl to stop it
But she continued to pop it (Woah)
You know I know you like it
Let me hit you on your Sidekick
Because the after party is at my body
Meet me you're invited

You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got

Oh, oh, oh

She licked, off, her lip, gloss
Her hips, tossed, back, and forth (Uh-huh)
Side, to side, and up, and down (Ayy, haha)
She touched, the ground, it turned, me out
I'm battling desire (Uh-huh)
Lord help me douse this fire (Uh-huh)
This internal inferno
Hotter than a shot of Cuervo (Come on)
Her top was short and purple
Belly dancing in a circle
When I feel like this I can't resist
Stop it don't make me hurt you

You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
