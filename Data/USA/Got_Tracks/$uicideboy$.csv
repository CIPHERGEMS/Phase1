It's that marble martyr, fucking daughters
Rocking Starter, going farther
Sauce ain't tarter, bitch, it's barbecue
Bitch, I be that breadcrumb-covered motherfucker
Bitch, I'm fucking southern fried
Lyin' to all you look-alikes just to further you from the truth
Sippin' white wine, then committed $uicide
Now I'm sippin' red wine in the booth
Blowin' on a blunt, puffin' up, me and $lick go poof
Goku on the beat
Steady getting money like a toll booth—nah, I'm just playin'
Bitch, I'm broke, $loth broke too
Ridin' in that drop-top with the whole crew, no proof
White pearls wit' one gold tooth, uh

Let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Let me get the keys to the Rover truck

Ride 'till the sun up, old trucks with the top up
Yet these bitches still stutter
Yung Christ, and I'm smokin' on butter, just another
White creep with no respect
Everyday I hold my breath, tryna meet death
No check, no balance, and no debt
No money, no cars, but I'm on flex
See you motherfuckers don't get, that I could give a fuck about this rap shit
Born with a dope flow and an accent
808s with the slap got ya' back bent
So here's a big ""fuck you"" to you motherfuckers
Buncha clones, $uicide not like the others
So if you wanna meet that devil shit I got in me
Keep talking, lil' bitch

Let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Let me get the keys to the Rover truck

Grab the knife, and cut me twice, and let me die slowly

Slice me wide open, because I'm too fuckin' impatient

But the truth is, I make this fucking music
And I can't even get my friends to listen to it
I wanna say screw it, but I know improvement will prove it, fuck it
It's evident, they need the evidence
Thinkin' I'm heaven sent, but really I'm crawling outta hell
$uicide for life, G*59 count the spells
And just think, I'm only beginnin' to crawl out of my shell
Weed and bullets on the coffee table
I'm the son of the snake, I'm both Cain and Abel
Smoke and death is the smell that dwells around my humble abode
This is just a story, no fable, no moral code
It ends with me rich, sad, and alone

Grind nonstop, I gotta stay paid
Keep it chill with my bae, smoke good getting laid
The lane that I made is where Supa finna stay
The game that we play, we still play it til this day
Half these cat’s lames, they jus wanna peel away
Keep them fools far away then everything will be okay
Take a shot to the head like a AK might spray

Oddy Nuff da $now Leopard, $crim

""Slightly overrated"" mean I'm over being rated by cops, critics
Cynical assholes that ain't creative
My styles jagged, but my attitude seems jaded
Like a diamond that shine has really faded
From sitting on some chick's finger too long
I'm in the basement huffing paintings of animals in cages, uh
You ready? I've been waiting
Oddy Nuff will leave your body shaking, probably aching
Man, fuck a vacation
My narration of your duration ends in mutation with starvation and salvation
Now, what's the translation?
I'm the motherfucking rapping Patrick Bateman
Freddy and Jason, spitting campfire
Michael Myers, Leatherface with an army of vampires
I'm so tired of whack rappers thinking they're fresh
When I'm so flyer than a gnat's nest resting in sweat
I bet you get the threat
Take a deeper breath, and don't forget to motherfuckin' catch it
I'll bite a chunk out your neck, take your head and detach it
And that's it

Ain't smoked my weed today
Got some hoes and lemonade

Busting gars, blowing dank

It's that junkie that you heard of
Snort some dope, then maybe slap a bitch
Not talking females, just them rappers on that bag of shit
Pimp macking shit
Hoe's on that X, and they chewing
Used to have that work, just ask any junkie who using
Cadillac cruising
Abusing some dope
That heroin, so soothing
With a black bitch who claim Cuban
Hail Mary

No nose ring, just tats, and two Glocks

Drop some acid to laugh, while I decapitate you

Here's a little story that I gots to tell
Couple grams of weed that I tried to sell
Girly hit me up, said she wants an eighth
I told her, ""give me ten—and I'd be right at your place""
Pulled up at the condo, gave a knock on the door
What I seen next, it had me on the floor
She then replied, ""Hey, $crim! Surprise!""
Took my hands, and I rubbed my eyes
She said she's out of money, got something for me
Opened her legs and showed me her pussy
I said, ""Hold up, honey, I need my paper!""
Following that will be a blowjob later
Boujee ass girl, pulled out three twenties
Told her don't ever, ever play with my money
Hit the front door like a fire exit
Then dirt scooped me up in the four-door Lexus
Went to the store, copped a few Phillies
Blew a few blunts, said, ""Thank you, Miss Lilly""
Headed to the city where the good die young

Take too much of this shit, and you'll be saying, ""I don't want this no more!""
I just want to go home
Smoke dope and fucking zone
Airplane mode on my mobile phone
Copped a zone on a homegrown clones
Buy my bud from super hippies
Take some L and get super trippy

Big body, candy paint, but I'm sitting shotty
Woke up in a Honda, ain't woke up in no Bugatti
I was chilling with a bitch, smoking, playing an Atari
She said she was an angel and her daddy name was Charlie
I'm just pimping on these bitches, I'm just pimping on these bitches
Oddy licking on a Swisher,
 cooking dope in the kitchen
Y'all just listen, pay attention, all this shit that I be talking
Ain't no fronting, homie, what? Bitch, you see how I be walking
Roll that blunt, smoke it up, put that codeine in my ice
You joke as fuck, you love to stunt, no RiFF RAFF, I got that rice

Tryna stack my G's, got the MAC, no cheese
See these cigarette burns on the passenger seat
That's what caused me to crash my whip
(
Better pay attention when you drive

I got a hundred thousand miles on that bitch, uh
You see, my mama told me it's what's on the inside that counts

Thanks, mom

That's why I'm always looking clean when I'm riding 'round town
Pushing pounds, that's what we call it when yo car break down

Like the bone in your back, get the fuck up off my wave
Let me drown in peace, bitch
Bring a gun to the beach, bitch
Blow my brains away

Some people wanna call me a bitch
Some people wanna tell me that it ain't that bad

Put the gun up to my head
Fuck this shit, I shot the lead and now I'm dead
Descendin' through hell, nothing but burnin' flesh smells
I scream, and scream, and scream
And hear the others yell as well
Oh well, just my luck
Devil opens up to devour me, that was my old life
Antichrist, he has empowered me

Shotty blast
Put that Tommy back and grab the Gucci
Uzi spraying through me

Tape her confession, take off her dress and watch her fucking faint
Pretty girl sacrifice
Ugly hoe in the back on ice
Lit a match cause the gas was asking twice
Slash and slice I'm passing lice
Snatching ice and casting dice

Stuffing with straw until I choke and I clog

Existence is overrated anyway

Six billion people living as civilians, and I hated them all
I should have been a vermillion reptilian living in a swamp

Not fucking with bitches, if I know I don't trust 'em

Full of them kids that be rollin' with chops

The water smothers me patiently, and it waits to feel my body on the ocean floor
I am the captain
I stand on my ship, never leaving its side, for tonight I sleep in a shark's stomach
The tears and rain both hit my face, as I lay on the deck and wait to drown

Rip off my wings, and I take off my halo

So I slept with the devil, I sold my soul quick
I was fucking and then-then I made it my bitch
Murder suicidal, grippin' the rifle, hand on the Bible
Believe in false idols you living in dreams, but I'm stuck in reality thinking of schemes
Loss in the darkness where I become heartless

Poison me with lead, inject it into my fucking head

Pressure, pressure
How do I dear deal with all this pressure?
In my way
It’s in my lungs
It’s in my thoughts
It’s in my brain
A guilty conscience some might say, I’m paranoid and locked away
A withering weed in the garden that God wasn't supposed to save
Locked up in an open grave
Reading King James' Bible
With a couple quotes erased, but kept the ones that made me smile
Do I really see everything for what it is?
Or is it that I can’t see anything with such a bad case of denial
When I die, then put my body in a boat
And light it on fire, push me out to sea
And let the wind do what I might-a

Up in gangster's paradise, could give a fuck about your life
Every time I roll the dice, sixes popping up twice
Bitches tryna sacrifice their pussy, but I am not enticed
Good try, hoe
I do this shit for Dirt, so I ain't got the time, hoe
Don't like nobody, and I think that's all you need to know
Walkin' on water while I'm surrounded by some crows
And when I hit the other side, I'm blowing on some dope, hoe",https://genius.com/Uicideboy-i-miss-my-dead-friends-lyrics

(I!) see the reaper creepin' as my blood is seeping
Sleeping deeper through the night, so I can face my demons
(My!) weakness seems to be that I cannot stop breathing
Death keeps cheating on my life, but on my soul, it's feeding
(It goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on)
Leading to the fleeting of an endless dream
Screaming and needing, yelling and pleading
That things ain't as they seem
In the cut, sneaking and tweakin'
Because I can't stop seeking this pain, this torture of horror
That I'm always conceding

Eternal rest, the bloody mess
Keepin' the motherfucking devil hot
Satanic mentality, happily makin' the bodies drop
I'm on the block, circling cops
Ready for their demise
Screams resonate through the night, so I can't close my eyes
Hard to swallow when the hollows enter through your throat
Lately, I wallow in my sorrow 'cause I cannot cope
The dope, the coke, the drank, the lean
The pills, the X, the smoke
The rope to choke the pain away, I'm broken til' I croak
Ho

Baby, let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Baby, let me get the weed, there's more for us

Yeah, here's a couple bucks
Bitch, I'm Oddy Nuff, creepin' out the cut
Blood seepin' out my cut
With the shotty, 'cause you might escape the Tommy gun
Because I'm busy puffin' blunts
But soon enough you'll come back round
You screamin', ""Lock me up—please, box me up!""
I got you, sucker

Now I'm seein' all this shit, brain glowing
Everything is bending in the same motion
Roll the blunt, I'll take a hit
Start staring at the smoke, as it twists and disappears
Peer pressure don't affect me, bitch, I take drugs on my own
Pop a perc' and snort some coke
It feel like my heart is broke because I get fucked up when I feel alone
I'm choking on this forty of OE, I'm hopin' that I don't breathe

i got hoes that burn their wrist with the blunt they rolled for me. now i'm always stoned, always home alone. in the back of the benz, i got my squad, i know. but i only see them on the road, and the rest i know just want to use you.

they always wanna use you
snakes in my face, yeah, i think i'm medusa. polo pyjamas with the pockets ripped, the red, white, and blue ones. that's why i'm always losing money, but don't let that confuse you because now i got a mouth full of gold, but baby i'm still a loser.",https://genius.com/Uicideboy-i-no-longer-fear-the-razor-guarding-my-heel-iii-official-lyric-book-annotated

Ocean flat,
 often I lay in this coffin, sleep on my back, toss a couple of 'em back
My liver really startin' to slack, and I can feel myself decayin' from the cigarette packs
I haven't thought of $UICIDE since I was livin' in the back of Blackout's pad, my heart torn in half
Now I've got everything I ever wanted, but now I don't want it
It feels like I'm haunted, it feels like I'm cursed, hopefully soon I'll return to the dirt
A material world with a virtual nerve,
 
yeah, I'll see what it's worth, throw me out on the curb
Leave me behind,
 walk a straight line to hell, as y'all swerve away, lost in the choice not to sell
Roll me up a blunt, ayy, I need to get lost, ayy
All y'all talkin' 'bout sauce, I'm wipin' frozen cuts with frost
I'm slicin' open guts, and tossin' frauds off to the side, half of $uicide
A couple million, now we're ready to fucking die

Two cups and a bad bitch, then I pop me a Xanax, quick
Call Shake when I need that fix,
 
call Nick when I need that itch
Call Krez just to pop on 'phetamine,
 
Max Beck in the back; pop seventeen
Yung Kurt Cobain with the heroin, $lick love drugs over everything
Shoot the stars up in my veins, woah,
 
but look at your bankroll
So? Just spend it on more dope, more woes, fuck you care for?
But lately, I feel guilty, I feel so badly
They say I made it, and that should be satisfactory
Lately, I feel like I have nobody
All alone in an empty hotel lobby

4 AM, praying; can I get some rest?
Dreams of $uicide and the need for death

Still on that killa' klan
Creep up behind shit

I feel you’re owed for slugs
Come play a thug
Automatic to his chest, have him coughin' up a lung
Catch a blast
May flood the cash

Think fast for that four fifth
Lay ya' in the grass
One-shot, turned into ash
So quick and fast, no joke

Stay out my path, nigga

All of these bitches ain't fucking me, no
Can't hold a conversation with no one but my cousin
He tell me, ""Don't worry, the money is comin'
These bitches is coming""
Yeah
The only question I got now, will I see it before I end up dug in the ground?
Lay low at the bottom of a tulip bed
They know Ruby got a lot of useless thread
Cut me open, let me rest, there ain't nothin' in my chest
A hollow cage that caused my death
I'm hauled away, just pause my breath

Woke up dope sick with a cut wrist
Lil' bad bitch saying, ""here's a plot twist""
When you cut it, you weren't even a little pissed
Just a grin on your face, saying, ""watch this!""
Now I'm sittin' back thinkin' how sick am I?
But that went away the moment I got high
I'm saying now, ""what it do, who are you?
Get the fuck out my living room
Get the fuck out my mental too
What, bitch? You can't hear when I talk to you?""
Now I'm back to square one, with my hand on the gun
Mama screaming, ""Son, don't do it—I love you, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it""

One day, I'll become the same: a pile of ashes forgotten in a vase
Wrap my chain around the base, and then put it on display
Flashing lights, they shine so brightly
'Till there's blackouts every night
See shattered glass rain from the sky
Beware my drip (ayy), that shit so blinding!
White gold blade, on a bright gold chain
Ruby da Cherry been hated, so why the fuck would I not stay the same?
Every step that Ruby take is like he walking on a plank

Roll up in the tank, fuck the fame

Movin' fast, smokin' gawdy with a touch of hash

Six-six-six, wrists glisten 'cause of slits
Heads missing, so I split
Driven apathy, actually traffic
No tragic car accidents happen

We built our smoked out, loced out in the fucking Chevrolet

Ruby steady swervin' down this muddy road
Whip got like a hunnid spokes
My gas tank needle doesn't show how much gas I'm about to blow
Told $lick, ""don't roll down the windows!""
We'll probably drown just for your info
He rolled the bitch down and let in the minnows
The velvet seats ruined, they used to be pimp though
Swam out the whip, hold my breath, count to ten
Guess this it, so we left
Got to swim to the surface before we start breathin' in water
Looked up and saw the sun fade—I'm a goner
Bitch, lay me down along the bottom of the lake
Forever hauntin' Pontchartrain, until I rise up out my grave

There's no survivors, just the blood scattered up all over the place
We built our smoked out, loced out in the fucking Chevrolet
There's no survivors, just the blood scattered up all over the place

Lurkin' back out the cut
Creepin' with Mutt, ridin' down St. Bernard
Xanax bars, Chevy cars
Plenty broads, curve 'em all
Was born to fall
On a good day, I crawl
That cocaína, drippin' out my nose
Pour my fours in Aquafina
It ain't no secret, everybody know that I'm a fiend-a
That weapon keepin', always sleepin' with my loaded Nina
Yung Emphysema always smokin' on that Hiroshima

Two strikes, turn that pussy to a sacrifice
Slash and gut the gar, ash the blunt and park
Roll the window down, and ask the price

Snag the cash in spite the fact I smashed your bitch for asking nice
I'm passin' pipes and glass and spikes, I bag the ice
Ignite the rags in gasoline, one strike of the match

Dead bodies all around, hunnid rounds out
Smell it in the air everytime I'm fucking 'round town
Lay 'em down, one by one, I pick 'em off without sound
Cock the hammer back, brains splat, hauled off on a bloody mat
Chain snatched, I like the way it shines when I'm back in black
Blood diamonds glisten, hear the victims yell (why?!)
Got the choir singing all the songs of fucking hell
As I hear the voices swell, I know the demons wish me well
Bath salts in the nose, feel like eatin' a fucker's face
Now I'm speeding in the Bronco like it's 1998
Take away the cameras, motherfucker, now it's war time
Behind enemy lines, PTSD just means I'm high
Bring me life, bring me life so I can end it on my own time
Meeting the reaper, all day tryna take me off the frontlines
I just want some peace of mind, sick and tired of feeling tired

I declare war, Armageddon, let us swarm
I'll bring the fucking storm, bury me in uniform
Units form under the rising sun
G*59, the tide has come
Wash the blood, 
unite as scum
Fill the air with tyrant dust
Tonight we die, grey flags, wave 'em high
Point your guns up at the sky, yelling, ""We know God has died!""
Palm trees drip with fucking fire, smoke and ash all in my eyes
It's war time, all the fucking time
Now who wanna die?
Follow me, we can see the other side
And if anyone's in the way, rip out their spine
Leave 'em behind and repeat 'till we die
Grey*59 army, we bleed 'till we dry
Enemies, nothin' but enemies
Kill 'em all, burn it all down, no new friends
We'll piss on their graves, and then claim it's our legacy
We were all doomed, written in our destiny
Peace? It will never be
At least 'till I am deceased, underneath the ground
Shoot off a round, watch me bleed
Got the lead separatin' my head, tag my feet
Bury me in the sea,
 
and try not to forget me

Gotta light up the blunt just to choke, 'bout time I feel something
Climbing out of my funk, then I jump back in
Punching a hole in the wall, let me in
Bloody knuckles, unbuckle the belt, got a devilish grin
Unfuckable, melt me away with my sins
I'm in trouble, the bubbles should give you a hint
Bitch, I'm sinking again in the bottomless pit
Bitch, I'm rotten from all of the toxins I'm poppin'
I'm poppin' from all of the toxins I'm copping

Crucify ghosts in a frozen abyss, ocean of planets in total eclipse
Nowhere I wander, wherever I drift, usin' a razor to open my wrists
Crucify ghosts in a frozen abyss, ocean of planets in total eclipse
Nowhere I wander, wherever I drift, usin' a razor to open my wrists
Crucify ghosts in a frozen abyss, ocean of planets in total eclipse
Nowhere I wander, wherever I drift, usin' a razor to open my wrists",https://genius.com/Uicideboy-whoa-im-woeful-lyrics

Blanket protection, sweatin'
Heaven left me on the steps, and now I can't stop stressing
Who is Ruby da Cherry? Let the internet keep guessing
That's always the fucking lesson
The less you grab, the more you getting
$UICIDE, G*59, I'm guessing all the blogs slept in
Back then, they didn't want me, now I'm hot, hoes all on me
Back then, straight from the swamp
We climbed up out, no moss on me
I'm clean as fuck, but keep it dirty, like I'm from the dirty
Ridin' dirty in a dirty ride, might stay alive until I'm thirty

Hot boy, keep the block hot
Shot cop, got popped
Run up with the block-ah
Drop top, house shot
Fuck the cops, fuck you, and motherfuck the population
All these goof motherfuckers just some fucking imitations
Smoke me a motherfuckin' L to the head
Grey fucking *59, hoe, you know what I rep
Sleepwalk with the dead, put a slug in your head
We them Southshore playas that don't fuck with pretend

You’re Now Tuning in to 66.6 FM with DJ Rapture (The Hottest Hour of the Evening),KILL YOURSELF Sagas: XI - XV,2017.0,"Sink back in that fucking spine, second-guessing crime
7th Ward where I snort a slug and cross the fucking line
West Bank/Northside 'till the coffin ride
Who am I? I am God; I am Basquiat

Trap-a-holics mixtapes
Man, drop this shit for these fuck niggas

Grey*59 signed
Rough diamonds, tryna shine
Christ and I, $ui-$uicide
You know, you know, you know I'm
Diving head first when crucified
Lucifer cried when I told him I'm choosing to die
Noose and a knife, but I ain't use the knife
To loosen the noose, keep it tight
Abusing the truth, that's a lie
Fuckboy with a ski mask think he gon' rob me blind?
Fuckboy better think fast when he cock the nine
Fuckboy better—
Fuckboy better, sink back in that fucking spine, second-guessin' crime
7th Ward where I snort a slug and cross the fucking line
Yet another line inside the cup, another line you should look up
Another line that shook you up, I signed the line for Lucifer

Damn son, where'd you find this?
Real trap shit!

*59 'till I'm dead, ayy, yuh
Bitch, I'm grey 'till the death, yeah, uh
Never gave a fuck 'bout dyin', no, uh
Even when I was a jit, woe
Pop a jig, load the rig with that motherfucking China white
Fuck it if I die tonight, I'm gamblin' with my fucking life
West Bank/Northside 'till the coffin ride
Who am I? I am God; I am Basquiat
Yung Kurt Cobain with the scarred veins
Mentally deranged, hear the crows say my name (""$carecrow!"")
I'm just wastin' my time, I'm just wastin' my breath
Why can't I just die? Why can't I go next?
Why we get no respect? Why I love holding TEC's?
Xanax bar on my neck, I pop 'em, pop 'em 'till death
This ain't no motherfuckin' trend, every day feel like the end
Feed me, feed me medicine, so I can't feel my sins",https://genius.com/Uicideboy-youre-now-tuning-in-to-666-fm-with-dj-rapture-the-hottest-hour-of-the-evening-lyrics
