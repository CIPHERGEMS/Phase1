The Choice is Yours (Revisited),A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing,1991,"Here they come yo, here they come
Here they come yo, here they come
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?

Who's the black sheep, what's the black sheep?
Know not who I am, or when I'm coming, so you sleep
Wasn't in my realm, or wasn't in your sphere
Knew not who I was, but listen here
Dres, D-R-E-S, yes I guess I can start
If it's all right with you, I'll rip this here joint apart
Back, middle, to the front, don't front
Wanna a good time, gonna give you what you want
Can I hear a hey? (hey)
Can I get a yo? (yo)
You got a 'hat? (huh)
It's for the hoes (oh)
The styling is creative, black sheep of the Native
Can't be violated, or even decepticated
I got brothers in the Jungle, cousins on the quest
Dead departed uncles, in pea porridge, may they rest
Guess, which way, what, when, how
Mista Lawnge, Dres, Black Sheep slam... Now
Know you've heard the others, phonies to the lovers
Then of course, the choice is yours

You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is kinda phat

Where's the black sheep, here's the black sheep
Even if we wanted to, the flock could not be weak
Watch me swing like this, why should I swing it like that
Because in fact, on me it might not attract
Therefore I ignore, do as I feel inside
I live with me, I've got my back tonight
Ya know what I'm saying
Yo Black, I'm not playing
Need to go with this, or go with this with no delay and
See, in actuality, wonder can it be
I made it look easy, because it is to me
Any time capacity was filled, tried to rock it
Any time a honey gave us play, tried to knock it
Never was a fool, so we finished school
Never see us sweat, and you'll never see us drool
Out to rock the globe while it's still here to rock
Don't punch girls, and we don't punch a clock
Gotta go, gotta go, see you later by the cat
And you can't beat that with a bat

You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is kinda phat

Engine, engine, number nine
On the New York transit line
If my train goes off the track
Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up!

Back on the scene, crispy n' clean
You can try, but then why, 'cause you can't intervene
We be the outcast, down for the settle
Won't play the rock, won't play the pebble
Open the door, you best believe, we're sliding through it ... sssswiftly
Niftily, we can make it hip to be what we are
Cause what we be, be the epitome, doo, dah, dipitty
So now I dwell just to say you're plainer
Hold your cup, cause I got the container
Pass a plate or, cross the fader
Black Sheep get play like the Sony Innovator
Never the traitor, party inflater
And you can get a scoop ... later

You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is kinda phat
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
(Where it's at, where it's at, where it's at, where it's at)

Flavor of the Month,A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing,1991,"Van Damme!
Let me see what kind of flavor I want
Hmmm. Do I want, vanilla?
Or do I want a taste of chocolate?
Nah. I want something different, I want something slamming!
What's the slammingest flavor out this month?
Let's see...
Yo black!
(Hmmmmm?)
What flavor are you?
(Listen...)

For a second, I reckon, I got ya double checking
Then again when to your needs did I beckon?
Hold me only if you wanna get naked
Play me for the crowd only if you wanna wreck it
The name is Dres, like silk I get slick
Drop rhymes like a basehead Bic flicks
Constantly, yes it's me
D-R-E-S
So yes, I guess, unless ya fess
You can get down to serious business, with this
I never boned a honey that I didn't like
I never saw a mile that I couldn't hike
I never had a spliff to make me choke
I never had a pocket that was broke
Hate no one but love only a few
Franklin, Grant and yeah mom duke
I run buckwild for self or with the crew
But then again, huh I thought you knew
Now I hear a voice, is it what you want?
I hope it is kid you're the flavor of the month

I heard you got the fever for the flavor 
Somebody said you got it going on
I heard you got the fever for the flavor 
Hurry up and get a scoop before it's gone

So you got the fever for the flavor of the other
Chocolate, sasspirilla, or is it you like another
Flavor in my socks, to the curly locks
Black Sheep rolling hard and knocking peons out the box
Never have I ever never ever felt much better
Did the whole nine, on the tenth I was no wetter
Ready and I'm eager, eager as a beaver
On the radio and good to go says your receiver
Not to be the boldest or the oldest nor the wackest
Neither am I needest or the newest or the blackest
Just a brown fellow who's not afraid of Jello
To the people of the world I would like to say G'day
Had to wait a while but the while has been waited
Never gave up hope in myself nor debated
Didn't shed a tear when I wasn't picked
Cause I got a cone now, want a lick?


Now I catch a number when before I caught a glare
Now I give a pound when before I gave a stare
Now I guess I kinda got it going on
I get a wake-up call on the norm
I used to try and push a demo now I have a Coupe
That's a bit more than a little, but then not quite a few
Funny how they find you when they told you get lost
Tell me why you're gritting when you have no dental floss
Wasn't my loss, thought you were the boss?
You never knew how much the Sherbet cost
Forget it, I never sweat it
Your girl will give me play I'll wet it
It only happens yes because you let it
Now everybody wants to play my phone
I see em with a spoon, I see em with a cone
You never knew I knew it but I knew you would pursue it
Hurry up and get a scoop before it's gone",https://genius.com/Black-sheep-flavor-of-the-month-lyrics
U Mean I’m Not,A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing,1991,"Yo motherfucker!
What the fuck you lookin' at?
Yo, get out my motherfuckin' face right now
Yo man, trip this
I was out on ave man
This nigga was lookin' at me wrong
So I pulled out my motherfuckin' nine
And I SMOKED HIS ASS!

Woke up, didn't choke up
Saw my AK, it was broke up
Put it together like a jigsaw
Got my nine and my Rambo knife off the floor
Went to the bathroom, and beat the rush
Yo, who the fuck used my toothbrush?
Went to my sister's room, yo bitch, wake up
You stupid ass, dirty ass, nasty ass slut
Shot her in the leg, shot her in the thigh
Kicked her in the pussy and punched her in the eye
Slapped her in the head, stepped on her corns
Don't fuck with mine bitch, word is bond
Went downstairs to eat wit' my folks
Ma, you broke my fuckin' egg yolk!
Punched her in the chest, cut on her cheek
Then I did a sweep, knocked the bitch off her feet
Knee to the pussy, kick to the skull
AK y'all, shot that bitch in the temple
Pop got mad 'cause mom got licked
I didn't give a fuck so I shot him in the dick
Hungry as fuck, said my grace
Pop kept screamin' so I shot him in the face
Ate my food, found my coat
Mailman came so I cut his motherfuckin' throat
Waitin' for the motherfuckin' school bus!!

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo Dres, yo Dres
Wake up man, wake up
What's wrong with you man?
Yo, I had a mother, fuckin' dream man
What the fuck was the dream about G?
I dreamed that I was...hard",https://genius.com/Black-sheep-u-mean-im-not-lyrics
La Menage,A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing,1991,"Listen, hon, I mean, ah, as slamming as you are and all that good stuff, it ain't doing me no good out here because...
You have too many clothes on
So why don't we just take this cab and uh, slide on uptown and uh, slip outta all of this uncomfortableness of the world around us
Do you know what, you know what I am saying babes?
Matter of fact, uhhhhh...

Listen to me honey
Ah, honey listen here please
If sexy were a virus
Then you'd have a disease
Slamming is your styling
Let me speak for a while and
Tell you all about the grand slamming
(Why you smiling?)
Let's do the uptown slide
Don't need a transfer or auto ride
We only need a cab with us inside
Finally finally we got uptown
And when we got uptown
Honey's drawers came down
Did the audio visual
She had the residuals
Bah bah Dres, now tell me have U.N.E. Pull
I said honey, uhhh, again I said it slow
Coming out the boxers and my joint will surely grow
Then she started feeling
Yes, it was appealing
I thought of slamming girlfriend from the floor to the ceiling
We started five play
She said that she would come
I said it wasn't four play
Because I used my thumb
Nibbled on her neck
Oh, what the heck
She said, 'One two, one two' and went down for a mike check
Her mike sounds nice check one
Her mike sounds nice check two
She did this 'til it was all gone
I told her to slow down
But she kept on

And on, and on, and on, she kept on
And on, and on, and on, she kept on
(You gotta do something about those wisdom teeth baby)
And on, and on, and on, she kept on
Though you're sounding as good as a CD

Everything was Dolby, or rather all's OK
She was playing Frito and I play the Lay
Then I heard a knock only to hear a voice say...
Yo, you can't have a show without the DJ
I entered in my drawers
To show that I was live
The ho didn't believe that I was nine point five
She said, 'Let me see it Lawnge, may I see it please?'
I said, 'Yeah, get a good look. Drop to your knees.'
I was erectified. I gave her the proof
And then I suggested a little woof woof
She was uptight, I said, 'Hon, there's nothing wrong
I'm the sugar dick daddy Mista Lawnge
Don't get offended by the position I recommended
Doggy style is my shit
The bottom is what I hit""
I didn't eat her
Or Rita, just beat her
Bonita, Bonita, Bonita
Uhhhhhhh!

Tip and Sugar Dick, blazing trails of evil
Lawnge, you got the felts 'cause I sure 'nough got the needle
Now put them on the arm that protrudes like a stick
And live up to your label Mista Lawnge Sugar Dick
As the dookie hits the fan, in comes the horny man
To finish up the task, so I'm scopin' out that ass
Lawnge, she wants it
Her hands spreads the butt cheeks
Tip plus Lawnge plus the ho equals wet sheets

God damn
Yo, somebody give me
A horny time
Somebody give me a hole
Spread the ass
Just give me a hole
No man
Somebody give me a hole
I'm gonna come in your face
Somebody give me a hole
I'm coming, in your face
Somebody give me a hole
I'm gonna come in your face
Somebody give me a hole
Bitch just let me pee on you
Let me pee on you
Let me pee on you
Somebody give me a hole
I've got the anal tongue darts
I've got the anal tongue darts
Let me pee on you
Somebody give me a hole
Ahhhhhhhh
I can't hold it no more

And on, and on, and on, she kept on (Repeat until fade)",https://genius.com/Black-sheep-la-menage-lyrics
Pass the 40,A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing,1991,"Nigga, come off. Check this out. Check this out
Listen all this shit y'all talking ain't got no frills
We'll pass the 40 around and we'll see who's got some skills, I mean
If you got 'em you got 'em and if you don't
(I got skins. I got skins.)
...you're over. So Mista Lawnge, listen, I give this brew to you
I'm gonna pour some out for my man pee-wee. (Pee-Wee!)
And do what you gotta do, all right black. Bust it

I'm the sugar dick daddy
Fuck what you think
Pass the 40 right by me
Cause you know I don't drink
I remain sober when I drop a hit
But I put gum in my ass cause I like to pop shit
When it comes to pullin' gums I might do it
But put your guard up Black
And Ima run right through it
Don't sleep on the size
Thinkin' I'm easy to beat
Cause I'll be up in that ass like a bike seat
And when it comes to boning I'm Mr. Erecticy
Hoes come by the crib for a free hysterectomy
I've got a dick that I brag about
I put it in fast then I drag it out
Girls, I'll be the special friend see
Cause your man suffers from pseudo-penis envy
I do damage (oh, uhm)
The Sugar Dick is guaranteed to make you cum
Now I pass the 40 cause you heard from me
So, go get a forklift Chi-Ali

Well I'm too young for 40s, and too young for blunts
The only thing I'm not too young for is the stunts
The girlies, the ladies, I love them with a passion
But back to the mic cause I'm always down for action
Many M.C.'s fall to the dust
Some will rust cause I bust and I crush
You can't touch
I'm the child of the wild, the flavor of the Nile
I gave you plenty of chances, still ya fuck with this style
Now that you know, Chi-Ali can't be tooken
Pass the 40 cause my mother's not looking

Yo give me that, kid. You pah will put you in the mourge
Listen to hot diggity dog
Bibb bow wow wow wow wow
Yipity yie yo, yipity yo yie yeah
Diggity dog is rocking and
Yes, I'm definitely here to stay
Pass me 40. Pass me 40, pass it if you may
Because my jimmy is hard and yes I have a ho to slay
And when I'm funking the bitches they go huhhhhhh
When I'm funkin' the bitches they go huhhhhhh
Y'all drink the 40, I drink a Guinness Stout
And when I see you home, I'm out
Yo Baby Chris, pass me the keys to the car
I'm runnin late for my menage-a-trois

Pass it, tap it, and then crack it
Take a small swig
Or down it like a pig
You're too tippy to operate this rig
I'm a mike, You suckers I strike in flight
Here's a DWI for drivin' drunk with the mic
From Chi to Lawnge and all those in this fight
Loosen your grip 'cause you're holding it too tight
It'll take a body count, I know my body count is right
Five drunk niggas from my left to my right
And maybe a ho that I'm with tonight
But it's all right, yo! It's all right
So Dave my grip is getting weak
Grab the 40 so I can hear you speak

I live large, caviar and limos
Spent most of my time refusing bullshit demos
Can you understand, do you understand
Well let me explain I'm the A and R man
Dave Gossett. Yes I rock it
I rip the mike and I stuff pockets
Don't believe me? Ask the Sheep, see
They got the money, think it's funny
Always scooping all the honey
Oops, I meant to say hoes
Broke my own rhyme
What'cha didn't know, ut oh
I see a stroblelite ho, I gotta go, I gotta go
Yo Dres, it's your turn
Act like gonorrhea and burn baby burn

Step into the booth
And give em proof
That Black Sheep don't need jack to get loose
And rip a roof, loosen a tooth
You're in my fuckin way so move
And let a nigga get smooth
Honies play me close cause my goods are on display
So, I play em like vitamins and take a ho a day
I pull em like a dentist
MoId em like a teacher
Knock em like a bowler
Fleece em like a preacher
Step, get 'em man, go to school, join a band
It makes no difference whether
Dres is that type of brother
That will hit that ass forever
Cause I'm clever, ever
Never ever, have I lost my sight
Or said might or went a boneless night
Not talkin bout chicken
But if she's finger-lickin'
I will let it be known
Don't bite the bone
Microphones I like em cause they let me amplify
So don't reach for the sky, you know you can't fly
But still you reach up higher, a Black Sheep-type desire
Then you look up at me cause I'm a frequent flyer
So now you got beef chief
Grief will be your claim
I sport a full metal jacket
Give your beef some lo mein
Cause I'm swingin like a swinger
Singing like a singer
I'm lookin for your 
Or your ho so did you bring her
Ah I'm just bullshittin
Almost time for quittin
There's money to be made
And booty to be hittin
Look and you will see
Dres that's who I be
A divine incline of mine is studio time",https://genius.com/Black-sheep-pass-the-40-lyrics
Similak Child,A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing,1991,"When I first saw ya, I thought that I knew ya
Now I know I don't, just wish that I did
Honey made a right, stepped off, took flight
Upstairs, up more, made a left, and hid
Looked down at my shoes and the cuff in my slacks
Hand inside my pocket, came out with somethin stickin
Doublemint goes in my mouth, jaws are breakin North and South
Look around to see who's lookin, figure that my breath was kickin so
In the bathroom I go
And fixing his 'fro...you guessed it, the Lawnge one
'What's up Black?' goes the hand smack
I get the feeling that it's time for some Black Sheep fun
The club is on the bourgeois, urinal holding a cigar
Then you never know, probably a Phillie
Lawnge cracks a smile, oh no, here it comes, then says
""Yo Dres, honey made you look silly""
Step back in the joint, and yeah it's kinda funky
My breath no longer kickin so now it has pep
Strobelite ho that I don't know
Walks up, asks Lawnge's sign, we quickly do the step
Where you at, hon? Where you at?
Where you at, hon? Where you at?
Where you at, hon? Where you at?

Then I change my style
Movin through the crowd, the smoke has got me chokin
Funny that I'm chokin, could it be that I am smokin
Pounds are goin round, but this is nothing new
Hoping that eloping with a dip is what I'll do
System's kinda boomin like a drive-in called the Sonic
Find the bar kid, my state of mind would like a tonic
There she goes, ""Where?"" Take my thoughts out of the dumps
Lawnge, over there, over there, look at bumps
From the time that she was born, she was raised to be all that
Gave her no food (what?) Strictly Similak
Felt like a punk on Dick Street, a coupon in the ghetto
I said, 'Hon, whacha drinkin?' She said, 'Milk and amaretto'
I took a seat beside her, I would not be denied
I ordered L.I.I.T. and fill 'er up, she's got a rider
She showed her dental work, and said I looked familiar
I touched her on the hand, I had to feel her!

Similak child, drivin me wild
Simi-limi-lak child - you're definitely winnin
Similak child, drivin me wild
Simi-limi-lak child - you're the woman

I said, 'Hey', she said, 'Hi'
I said, 'Us', she said, 'Try'
'And if you're thinkin strictly boots then I'll say baby, bye bye'
She said, 'I know you got at least a dozen that you're seeing
You think you own the world, at least New York because you're G'ing
You claim to be the man. you want me for a lover
So you can do my girlfriends and my sister and my mother'
I said, 'You're very blunt, with quickness to the cue
So whassup with your mother does she look as good as you?
I'm playin, but let me not delay in what I'm sayin
Initially attraction found your way before the weigh-in
I'm single so I've got at least a dozen on my door step
Doesn't boost my ego, it doesn't mean we've slept
I'm in the public eye, so I try to be an eyeful
Do not own the world, but yes I have some pull'
My chorus rose a brow, she's curious of me
'Please give me more iced tea, and her vitamin D'
She said, 'Me?' Yes. 'Why?' Guess
Sweetheart you've got ten cushions, besides I like your dress
I'm playin but let me not be weak and let me speak
Your mind is brighter than your booty, it’s the carton that I seek
Similak child, drivin me wild
Simi-limi-lak child - you're definitely winning
Similak child, drivin me wild
Simi-limi-lak child - you're the woman",https://genius.com/Black-sheep-similak-child-lyrics
Strobelite Honey,A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing,1991,"I skipped the line
, I paid my dime
I hung my coat, and now it's time
To move to the forefront make my rounds
Say peace and give a pound have a drink, get down
I'm on the floor, besides the door
The sound is rich, and I ain't poor
I'm looking for Susie or Wendy or Judy
But look at her (but look at her)
But look at her
(Who me?)
Yes, you sweetie, although it's hard to see thee
I see your silhouette and what I see has got me needy
I need you for a second of your time
But then I reckon that a second is too short let me try

But anyway, I'd like to say
I'm Dres of the Black Sheep givin' you play

Listen it's uh, seven six five, four three two one

One, 
nine-hundred

Listen here dear, step to the rear
Find yourself a seat, buy yourself a beer
Eat some pretzels, go play some videos
Thank you for your time honey but ho I gotta go
I think I lost my coat, and plus I'm double parked
I thought you was my girl, you see I can't see in the dark
Anyway I'm out, out is what I be
I've got to step

When you see a honey by the strobe light
Black I hope you got good sight

Black With N.V,A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing,1991,"Now, I was told to never bite off more then I could chew
But then you better bite enough for if you don't, my boy, you're blue
Now I wonder, can others see the system my eyes see
Or do they see and say they don't and blame it on society
The days I’ve spent on Earth come to over just eight thousand
And as I live I learn because there's always someone mouthing
Speaking on an issue, praise you or they diss you
Long as I come strong the words fly by me like Scott tissue
My people: from 'nigga' to 'negro' to 'man of color'
Killed my father and my brother so that you could rape my mother
Now you wonder, why is it through instinct you fear
Wouldn't dare me to stare, run for self, you're out of here
Not to worry, to harm you, not intention of my creed
But to stop your greed and give me what I need
Opportunity, for a life for me
And generations to come within tranquility
Now harmony is a total love of things
For those who are inclined or better yet like to sing
But peace of mind, it is my right therefore the spark will ignite
'Till I can catch a cab at Midtown at midnight
'Till I can be myself and not be thought of as worse
'Till I can buy a slice from Howard Beach to the 'Hurst
'Till I can get to play without fear of eject
And occupations which I seek I can have if I select
Now if I so select and reach out to make touch
How can you say that I ask for too much?

Don't speak to me if good times are granted 'till I be
Don't tell me of the countries or the islands that you seek
Don't tell me to keep trying, you know I won't agree
Double negative means positively black with envy

As a player of the game, of the lifetime game I'm playing
I bet you nod, mm-hmm, and shake your head to what I'm saying
It's keeping me bent but those of men color of skin could even begin to wonder
What is it to ponder to let another bother
Listen, stay open not dismissive
Lack of vision makes division, product: no ambition
Wishes which you wish upon, you wish were more than wishes
If I wish not to work hard and study not, then I wash dishes
Wish while I wash, the water hot gets colder
Black I'm saying that in fact the dish gets clean and I get older
Seemingly so, the dishes will grow to dishes well beyond me
Lost my wish and broke a dish so now I'm wishy-washy
Understand foundation, create my own creation
If dumb and pumping jumb I then get no ovation
But only restriction, bullpen means lots of friction
I then wash a dish without pay? Boom! N.W.A
Think I'm lying? Black, I'm crying salt, a tear would turn to crystal
Crystals forming on my dishes so I wash until dismissal
Wash until my prints are wrinkled, then they let me go
I know not where I'm going so I know not where I go
My people give me money but the money much too low
For me to meet the match of present day so I still need more dough
Conjure up a suit, I wish that it were cute
Borrow a token and a smoking I begin a wish less hope
Interview and application leads me on into frustration
And duration of my time is spent in lack of occupation
Time to go for what I know, I know not of a wish
But of soap and a towel and some water and a dish


But lay okay cause you can get the play
I peep your style, your smile shine bright about a mile away
But anyway, another day, in the land of shove
Just living in the life of who:
A black man on a green land with a blue skyline
Don't tell me I'm color blind
I'm seeing system, it's hard to believe in
Underneath the underside of underachieving
Bust my ass in school, to be a certified fool
Now intellect of curb is my only tool
But street game is so uncouth
I took the SATs and that's the sad-ass truth
I'm not gliding but I'm striving
Hanging on by a thread and it's called surviving
Hang on, hang on, hang on, y'all
Walk the street and keep your head so tall
For time is short, no time is bought
You're only in the wrong if you get caught
So kick in doors, bang on walls, shout in halls
But get yours, y'all, get yours, get yours, y'all, get yours
Get yours, y'all, get yours, get yours, y'all, get yours",https://genius.com/Black-sheep-black-with-nv-lyrics
Butt in the Meantime,A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing,1991,"It's times like this that I've gotta crack a smile
If it's about anything, then it's gotta be style
What happens now?
A better man can hold the mic and do the proving
Dres of the Black Sheep Yo, let's
Get the Sheep moving
I'd like to pay a tribute, to what?
To knocking boots
I'm single and I mingle if ya jingle I play roots
But there's another, the other
The brother on the cover
Brought along, I brought along
I brought along, Lawnge
A duo not a trio move your bootie cause I say so
Be outlasting or not busting Black Sheep not your average Joe
Now I hold a microphone, but this is what I wanted
A pocket full of punani
Better me than those that front it
Dropping bombs, lovely, make 'em jet without their Jetta
Keep fronting if you're wanting but I bet ya the Beretta
Punctuates and exclamates, the lingo I let go
Not that it's my style cause I, let go my ego
Be it just us, just you or just me or just who
Never am I full, gotta to get residuals
Pronto, Tonto
Was engine number nine
I'm out to get the nickels, quarters, pennies and the dimes

But in the meantime, I try to hawk one
I try to hawk one, in the meantime
Now in the meantime, I try to hawk one
I try to hawk one in the meantime

At last, Black Sheep on wax
And finally, it's for himself that Mista Lawnge is laying tracks
Now I won't dally your fiddle
Give ya more than bits and kibble
Or is it kibbles and bits that became hits?
Now there's a riddle
Believe me, cause you see, I do understand
Heard a jam that was flam
Bought the album, Van Damme, it's weak
But for the moment, I won't speak
Upon this, I mean that, I mean those, I mean them
I mean there, I mean here, damn
(Yo, whatcha trying say Dres?)
Yo let me try this again
Ya see, this is rather funky, the style that I'm displaying
Somewhat bona fide, on the side of okay and
Finally, your hunger for dopeness is full
Hmmm, please excuse me, Yo, turn it up a decibel
For
I am
About to rip a style
That
Will make heads bop awhile
So please step to the right, if ya suck
Should I do 'em Violators (Ahh, what the fuck?)
Moving, yes I'm moving, am I moving? (Goony gu-gu)
Say la say la what, say la say la say la (pu-pu)
Say it in a second, after Dres is finished wrecking
As I'm wrecking, gotcha checking
Step to this and Dres will deck

But in the meantime, I try to hawk one
I try to hawk one, in the meantime
Now in the meantime, I try to hawk one
I try to hawk one in the meantime

Surprising you, I'm rising
Dresmerizing and subliminalizing
Black Sheep are here, we're breaking all ties
And making songs that are prolific
Specific as terrific
Move a body in the city to both sides of the Pacific
I'm Dres and you are not
You're cold, I'm hot which means I'm soon to boil bootie
Your bootie, your bootie, the butt, but still you think you're royal
Are you mad? Are you jealous
Overjoyed or over zealous?
Hold your glass and sip
For when you held the mike you couldn't rip
Before your mike went hush
Keep sipping stupid lush
I know I'll be all right tonight
I took my time, I didn't rush
I didn't blush, I didn't frown
Got up to get down
Henceforth, I'm getting down and dirty, G
You thought that I would not be
Stupid, Cupid, or elupid
I sting ya like a bumble
Where's the bee, here I be
Can'tcha see, can'tcha peep?
If you're sleeping then wake up
If you're stinking then wash up
If you're creeping, then catch up
You're rolling with the Black Sheep

But in the meantime, I try to hawk one
I try to hawk one, in the meantime
Now in the meantime, I try to hawk one
I try to hawk one in the meantime

Now in the meantime, I try to hawk one
I try to hawk one, in the meantime
Said in the meantime, I try to hawk one

And you like the way it sounds
I'm dissing rap music
And rap music on the grounds
You say I'm full of sheep
And for that I give a pound
The Sugar Dick Daddy
Mista Lawnge to break it down
Ladies, step to me for a real neat treat
And if you don't wanna call me Lawnge
You can call me sweet meat
I wear protection, you won't catch claps here
Come over later, but first go get a pap smear
Nine point five okay dear?
And don't forget clean underwear
Cause I don't want 
the funk to flow
And after I nut, yo ya gotta go
'Don't you know
 ho, don-tcha know ho'
Okay enough is enough, time to get that off my bladder
And dig deep into subject matter
You know what?
You know what?
I'm sick and tired of rappers not real
And suckers makin' it with a pop feel
Labels signin acts for 'nuff bills
Tax write off, cause you have no skills
You go make a demo
Get a deal and start to sprout
Gold, platinum, and then start sellin out
You get a Benz and trash the Nova
Double platinum, and start crossin over
Then you get fall, I won't give examples
HINT HINT, they use the same old samples
But not the Sheep
For we are sleek and unique
Top of the peak and others are weak
Follow the words I speak
The situation is bleak
But this is the fly shit that you seek
When the style is dope
Mista Lawnge'sa participator
If you wanna battle, later

And claim to have brains
Take the funky drummer and give him back to James
I'm dope, I'm dope
Heh, I can't cope
Keep your cordless, because you bore this
You say you're sure, yeah
But I'm the surest
That, Black Sheep are unique
Funky clever brothers that will
Make a church girl freak
Out, without a doubt
You have no wins in a '91 bout
So shout, pout, do what you want
But you're out the picture
And I'mma get you sucka
Cause youse a dumb mothafucka
Better off as a tractor trail trucker
But movin right along to the Woodstock
Stop, remember when the band was on rock
Negro music, heh, separated
It blew up and became rap
And you hated it
That's of course till you see
A motherfucker that, could be in your family
Drop lyrics then you hear it
With glee, then only thing it tells me
Is that you know a good thing
When you see it
You run to get a tan
Cause you cannot be it
So, off the top off my head
I guess I keep it rollin
Till aaaaaaah... the rap gets stolen

Hoes We Knows,A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing,1991,"This is Dres
The Suga Dick Daddy Mistah Lawnge and myself make up
This crew called Black Sheep
Now uh, I knows a lot of hoes
And being that I knows a lot of hoes I get asked a lot of times
Dres, whats up with you and all those hoes?
Well check it
Let me put you down, up on a riddle
I'm the type of brother that is swinging with a fiddle
Out to get a lot because I never like a little
Which is why I ban 
a dip that claims she's in the middle
Met a honey riding on the trolly
Looking kinda Dolby said that I could call her Molly
Said she had a lover that went by the name of Polly
As she kicked it, I thought that I should dolly
She said Polly want a cracker but the dip is not desired
Cracker got a honey though she's about to be fired
He wants to get Anna better yet he wants to bone her
Anna's got a man though and I don't think he would loan her
I said honey honey I said it slow
Coming is my stop and I really have to go
Not to cut you short or to interrupt your flow but uh
Whats up with the mojo?
She gave a big grin, I knew that she was with it
We stepped off and 
we Niked (huh?) We just did it
Boots were kind of fly yeah I like the way they fitted
Honey was the woman and to her I did admit it
Lathered up the nuts and I changed my shoes
Took off the browns and put on the blues
Sweetie I'm the paper called the Daily News
And today's headline reads: here you can't snooze
After she was dressed we both broke out
Said she had to go and see a brother with clout
She said I'm hungry, hungry no doubt
Uh lemme get a hot dog with extra sauerkraut
She stepped to the left I stepped hard to the right
""Can you spare a quarter?"" Yo black go fly a kite
Gave a little bark but he wouldn't dare bite
For that would be the end of his night
Walk the city streets wonder who I'll see
There goes Mistah Lawnge and my man Peewee
Look upon their faces coincides with glee
What's up Dres yo what's up P
What's up with the skins said I just got deep
Did it cost a lot, naw the boots were cheap
Costed me some time and a little bit of sleep
A fresh jimmy hat and some kosher meat
Guess I got their goose to their toes they rose
My man Peewee broke out but Lawnge stood in a pose
Lookin at some kids going by in afros
Then pulled out a book entitled ""Hoes I Knows""
Dres: Listen, Mistah Lawnge
Lawnge: What's up
Ders: Being that a brother such as yourself knows so
Many hoes
Why don't you tell me
Whats your particular favorite ho?
Lawnge: Well I like 
sexual chocolate hoes
Milky hoes
, 
goya hoes
, 
pork fried rice hoes
Red dot
Special hoes
And my favorite? Mmmm triple H hoes

Love a black sheep ho cause she's down to swing
Goya hoes are fly but they wear anything
Triple H is silky but it seems to me
That a milky ho believes she's invented - (poonani)
Similak hoes bring an instant erection
And them red dot special hoes hold the fly complexion
Sexual chocolate hoes are like a game of bridge
And pork fried hoes, don't even speak the language
All in all I love them when the time is right
Only ho I hate is ho a la strobelight
Then again I know when it's late at night
I never say never cause I know I just might
Certain kind of heads that my dip can't see
Baby Chris, Pause, 
Red, Tip
 and 
Big Ali
Afrikaa, Lawnge and soon a kid named 
Chi
How do my hoes look? 
(Just call me choosy)
Honeys hear that word and they say van damn
Not to cause offense even though I know I am
Take it in stride, you survived the Son of Sam
It's a Black Sheep thing who gives a fuck if you don't understand
-Sexual chocolate hoes (You knows about sexual
Chocolate hoes?) I knows about sexual chocolate hoes, I knows
-Milky
-Milky hoes
-Do you know about pork fried rice hoes?
-Oh, damn gimme some
-What about mothafuckin goya hoes?
-Wooh!
-You heard about them red dot (red red red) red dot special hoes
-Red what the, what the fuck is that boy?
-You seen the dot I seen the dot, I seen it a lot
-They only get that dot once a month though, right?
-Once a month
-What about motherfuckin triple H
-Triple H? (triple H) Them half and half hoes?
-Half and half hoes!
-Van damn I know them hoes (big asses)
-Damn (I know them I know them)
-What about motherfuckin ah, what we got here
-Black sheep hoes
-What the fuck is a black sheep ho?

Yes,A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing,1991,"Yo! The Black Sheep has arisen here, oh dear
The cat's out the bag and it's the end of your career
Don't spit it out, let it persevere
I like to see my dick snot disappear
I got inch out the edge, Lawnge Don can't compare
So, ho, come here!
Now some say they get live but the Sugar Dick is live-er
In and out of any situation like MacGuyver
If it's not Boopie's then it's Lady Godiva's
When it comes to hitting ass I'm a striver
I'll use my dick to fight a war so there won't be no survivor
Call me the Nine Point Fiver!
Cause I'm the sugar dick, the Sugar Dick Daddy Mr Lawnge
Of the Black Sheep here to point out what's wrong
With emcees like these popping that bullshit, please!?
Hang it up, black
If it's a God-given talent then take that shit back
Analyse the style, go home and re-write
I know you wanna be down, I know you wanna be like
ME! The Sugar Dick Daddy Lawnge
If you think that you can play me, nah, you're dead wrong
Cause I write lines and wreck minds
Being that I'm the DJ I can flip at any time
I'll diss you on the rhyme, diss you on the cut
Have you on the dick so much there's no room for my nuts
Forget rapping, you nerds are herbs
Just get a job and ride my dick to work
Respect the Lawnge one cause fly shit I mail out
Yo, you got the wrong one if you think I'll sell out
Used to have a ho and I'm damn glad we fell out
I would keep on rapping but it's time to break the hell out

Yo bust it, I be a fly nigga as far as niggas go
I be a choice brother but only a brother would know
Chilling Eskimo as the general rule
If you can't say Dres, you can call me cool
Styles unlimited, you can't get with it
But you can get this if you straddled and it fitted
I wondered and I pondered if your family were Roman
Cause you're snuggly and you're cuddly, play me closely like a Trojan
Ah-ah, it busted, aww shit, don't act dumb
You opened your mouth, black, so yo here I come
It's a catastrophic state but let it begin
If my dick's on your minds then my balls are on your chin
Now here it's kind rough, so kids stay on your toes
If my balls or on your chin then pubic hair is up your nose
If pubic hair is up your nose then I suppose
I'm the nigga that gets and you're the nigga that blows
My style is immeasurable so put away your ruler
Think of the coolest kid you know, Dres is cooler
Smoother, slicker, quicker roll-flicker
Honey came bloody so I hit her in the shitter
Went to a first stone caster cum a master blaster
Tell you cause I know, black, get off the slim faster
I know you wanna emcee and be down with the rest
But stay on the head now cause that's what you do best
Your duck down sound compound no interest
Get down with the flock, motherfucker, invest
In the rhyming you're designing, I can see your shit climbing
To the bottom from the mid where it hid, bad timing?
What do you wanna know, I still gotta go
You're a tic out of tac but I'm busy getting doe
Move over just a bit for the sight taking flight
Still eager as the Beaver and I'm leading with my right
I'll coin one more then step, daggonit
Our dicks are the planet and where are you?",https://genius.com/Black-sheep-yes-lyrics

So I could just fly through the air no one could ever stop me
Or, or like Mike Tyson
So I could just knock people's heads off
Naaw, more like Prince
So I could pull all the honeys
Well a brother like Chi Ali is pulling all the honeys anyway
But still, it would be nice

What's going on kid?
It's time for Dres to begin
I see you grinning I'm beginning to think that we're friends
And if we are friends, then we are far from fools
So I will then kiss and
Let you into my sphere, cool?
Now listen I'm known as a Black Sheep
And if you try to pull the cover
And attempt to sleep
You won't get rest nah
You can not sleep on this
For I make noise...see?
But anyway, a life inside a day
Is where I live and though I wish
Therefore I pray with hay
I live on nonetheless
Through progress and regress
I've got my body and my intellect
I'm buddha blessed
Now my ""chalant-ness""
Or rather lack of this
You call a spade a spade
Well I will call a spade a kiss
Butt in the meantime
You try to fresh on that
And if the source is yours of course
I get a verbal bat
Until I get through
That we are rich with wealth
Can you understand that you should be yourself?

Oh no that's kind of trip
But gee I gotta go
You see it's not the style of me
So I'm not mending
And I won't pull your leg
Nor start pretending
To be a fair weather
With a plea to cop
'Cause you never let me hold your skelly top
You see it's like this I'll start explaining
Dres is down with self maintaining
Don't say I can't, I know that I can
Black Sheep rule, me and my man

Away from Flipper
I'd rather shoot you with the joint
Inside my zipper
But not to be fresh
For then I lose the groove
I'd rather see you smile
And move your booty smooth

Got things to show ya
Is there the chance
Of me getting over
And over and over and over and over again?
Now tell me
Are you gonna let me in?
For it's getting hot
What I have have not
Give me a second though
I have a mansion and a yacht
A caddy for my daddy

I give introduction
Of Dres and Mista Lawnge
A newfound baby sound production
I'm not out to  you
To strip or evict you
But merely do the things you wanted to but weren't able
Like move a party side to side
Sway for sway
And stride for stride
First fine tune
Then hit volume
Aw sheep, hit the bass and got the boom
So move to a rhythm that's quite uplifting
Just when you thought that nothing would rise, I'm drifting
Higher (higher)
Yeah, higher
I'm not a king, a prince, a ruler or a squire
I'm not a prophet and I'm not a messiah
I'm not a wolf or another flat tire...
Listen
I'm the Black Sheep man, oh yeah, I'm here
And even if you turn, I bet your girlfriend stares at me
And with me
You step, she just might come get me
Not slow but with a bounding leap
She'll be pulling my wool... (and what else?)
Count Black Sheep


It's a Black Sheep ""La Cosa Nostra"", or ""Thing Of Ours""
A family affair that overflows the reservoir
Of dollar short and daily sports who don't know what to do
Because I'm rocking you, rocking you, rocking you
Now listen because in a unit or family
A poppa, a momma
And brothers or sisters, see
An atmosphere of love in the air
Can give a clue or hunch
To the way we all became black Brady Bunch (okay)
To continue
There's a sister who is bright
A brother who's a wiz
Another that's not right
Stays out all damn night
You wake him up too early, cursing ready to fight
You say left and he says right-o
You want to see E.T. but brother there puts on porno
Love the family pet, I bet you even feed him Rave
Brother cooks your tabby in the microwave (meow)
He'd probably swipe your wallet if the light got dim
Now you have your doubts
But you never put it past him
And in the end, on that one you never sleep (never sleep)
Cause he's a Black Sheep


What's up party people
Party people, how ya doing
Black Sheep coming through
And then I guess that we're pursuing
A bit of your time
We'll skip over my sign
And get into a beat and a bass line
Stepping to the fellas
Fellas, peace and how you be
Keep the party orderly
We all can get booty
So before you rift, go play the bar again
Chill, count to ten
And bring me back a Heineken
Cuties, cuties, cuties, where's the hoes?
I knows and you knows and I know you know
No jam complete without a flock of bo peeps
Am I right?
Am I, am I, am I right?
Quite
Focus that I see tonight be
The epitome of sexy
Then again, it's just me
Honey next to you might look like doodoo
But don't nap, a cutie might be in her crew
In any event
I see the movement
And wonder where it is that the time went
But I'm out
See ya when the sun goes down
And the Black Sheep are in your town
Throwing down
Be there in a second so don't sleep
And if you do

Over to the mirror, yeah we look okay
Dial tone 2-1-2-A-O-J-O-J-O-J
It's a daily thing for Black Sheep, my friend
Yo driver, pull over, I need my midday Heineken
About to pout, no doubt your wish
Clockin' from a corner while you're eating a knish
Maybe another lifetime, G
I hope to see that you're as fly as we
Are not stars, but super as a sinner
You know you wanna
Come on, gimme the finga

I know you wanna, you know you wanna
I know you wanna, you know you wanna
I know you wanna, you know you wanna
Gimme the finga
I know you wanna, you know you wanna
I know you wanna, you know you wanna
I know you wanna, you know you wanna
Please

Got an accountant named Mel, a lawyer named Jay
My engineer Lyle who lives in Studio A
My manager Chris keeps my pockets well-fed
Got a honey for each box spring coil in my bed
My crib's all that without introduction
Do I read books? Nah, I read instructions too
Things you see when you window wish
Sippin' on a soda to help wash the knish
I do what I want and I answer to who?
No one, heh, I thought you knew
My favorite meal is anything with meat
My favorite quote, ""Can I have a receipt?""
My favorite show is Who's the Boss
And my favorite ho is yours of course
And everyday is Saturday, my friend
Go to sleep, wake up
Yo, it's Saturday again
It's fly, gettin' paid to do what you want
Don't believe me?
*Burp* See?

I know you wanna, you know you wanna
I know you wanna, you know you wanna
I know you wanna, you know you wanna
Gimme the finga
I know you wanna, you know you wanna
I know you wanna, you know you wanna
I know you wanna, you know you wanna
Please

Not that I like talking of the things that I possess
I know that some have more, although most do have less
It's just that I wanna say, I live a life in the day
Didn't have to wait 'til I was gloomy, old, or gray
I simply put my foot forward in a direction
That's called a step, then I follow with the next one
Kept on steppin', no matter what happened
Kept my eyes open, and kept hands clappin'
Did what I had to do when I had to do it
Didn't wanna say ""Huh?"" when I should've knew it
So, I persevered from the beginning
Now that I'm in Black Sheep, out to win
So when you see me, stick it up, G
No, it's not a diss, it's makin' me happy
Lettin' me know that you did what you heard
Darin' to say that society's absurd
Let it be known that you gotta go for the gusto
Be a head of house to the head ho
Don't let nobody tell you what you cannot be
Don't let nobody tell you what you cannot do
Enough of the tours, it's time to get yours
Otherwise, I guess I'll have to give the finga to you

I know you wanna, you know you wanna
I know you wanna, you know you wanna
I know you wanna, you know you wanna
Gimme the finga
I know you wanna, you know you wanna
I know you wanna, you know you wanna
I know you wanna, you know you wanna
Please",https://genius.com/Black-sheep-gimme-the-finga-lyrics

Ya gotta bag of buddha we'll smoke cess
I'm the type of brother that the girls always select
It's not because they're out to come
It's cause they're out to come correct
I talk about a ho, because a ho I know
And if you knew the honies too
Then I guess too you would talk so
Play me not, if my phone book is bigger
Don't get hot cause I clock the fat figure
Told ya I'm a swinga got my finga on the trigga
'Cause everybody hates the fly nigga
Play me not close if your chin is made of plaster
If your best is made it down
Then you should walk faster
Don't give me a pound if your heart's not in your hand
Play me out never 'cause I came to understand
Do it to, for me
I do for me too
Push me up and I'll pull myself through
Watch my back and I'll watch my front
Got what I want
See ya, hate to be ya
Got a nine, got a shottie, got a catch-22
I'm damned if I don't and I'm damned if I do
Fightin' overseas how they're fighting on my block
Over there is liberation over here is for a rock
No, not cop rock,
 
no, not pop rock

Without a Doubt,Non-Fiction,1994,"Verse One:
Dres --
Black Sheep, in your house, party people you remember
The two that served your whole crew like the bartender
It's dynamic D, don't you panic cause we won't stop
Until hip-hop, is all it could be, now
You can't checks it when I flex it yo I wreck shhhh
You're turning me off like a naked anorexic
I gets, jazzy baby if you're blastin maybe you can
See me and Mista Lawnge to drop the flavor loops like Toucan
Lawnge --
It's the genuine, nine and then some
Rolling with the Sheep but yo we all can't come
Because the part be on that old strict clientele
Dissing more people at the door than Jessica and Miguel
Now if you're peeps of the Sheep then we'll let you in
But if you didn't buy my album then you're not my friend
I recommend you step back to the end
And watch me catch wreck like fat people breakin wind
Dres --
Black Sheep, we're mighty like Isis
My man, I slam nice, yes more fly than Shazam I am
Dres, D-R-E-S, roar without a floor
I pound clowns who walk on sound for encores
Me and my man sicne eighty-three, makin this fast buck
Act up and get broken when I'm open like a Mack truck
Slammin ya on camera like Gamera it's iller
Cause you never knew the Sheep could catch wreck like Godzilla
Chrous: Dres, Lawnge (repeat 2X)
Yo I can do it 
Ain't nuttin to it 
Yeah I can do it 
Yo we can turn this party out 
Verse Two:
Lawnge --
Black Sheep, the definition, by now you should've known
It means wherever we rock the spot gets blown
So when you see is on a flyer, it should be your desire
To witness more wreck than a West coast fire
So be prepared to bounce jump around and all that
You don't have to ask Jack, you know where the party's at
It's uptown in the Boogie Down so don't sleep
On that Non Fiction hit by Black Sheep
Dres --
Be the B-B, L-L-L, L-A-C-K
S-H, double-E-P, and comin your way with A
Dope styles B you can't compare
C-D, come move your ass like you're sittin in my chair
We glow like incense intense like suspense
Commence to rip the party people love nonsense, I
Put the art in party with my padre, word to madre
I love deeper than that lady Sade
Lawnge --
Black Sheep, rips and represents, believe we do
Have more crews than in the days of L.Q
Now let me tell you, what other suckers failed to
We open more doors than a carpenter puts nails through
I wish your style was copywritten, to have fake suckers quittin
Because the Sheep style you're not gettin
Ya see we know, yo, we gotta stay original
Keep the Black Sheep flow and party til it's time to go

Outro:

Me and My Brother,Non-Fiction,1994,"Yo, yo, yo, yo the Sheep are back, black
On the attack that fattens your format
And suckers have to backtrack, regroup, resign
As me and mine recline in shade
Cause now we're getting paid like crime
Krill, with the skill to kill while I'm on your will
Ill, with the feel for what's real in my appeal
Why play me chummy if you really think I'm crummy
I caught your words and prep so long ago it isn't funny
Now I'm ready to riot until the state is in gas
If I wanted to dis you I'd play your shit and laugh
Huh, first mistake, choice when we gave it
Now put your plea on a deposit slip and save it
Second was the mic checking that you couldn't do
We step through just to get respect from your crew
Third, I heard you're tense with the gat
All I got to say to that is, umm, it's FAT
Be the fourth parallel to your ism
Know the diff of disrespect and criticism
Five, I plead the fifth, I'm just plain live
I won't riff with the jive that the Sheep'll take a dive
We've arrived just in time and you'll discover
Only my mother, sister and son
Could come between me and my brother

Me and my brother, my brother and me
Don't look on the surface cause if you do you'll never see
Me and my brother, my brother and I
Cause you'll fly sky-high when you try

Hey, yo
It took a long time although niggas thought we came out of the blue
A lot of punks slept but we always knew
That's why you pursue the two-man crew
To do the motherfucking job that you know a boy can't do
Like every aspect we cover: beats, rhymes and other
Nobody else down, yo, it's just me and my brother
Sheeit, back when the shit began, before there was a fan
We had the skills so we ran with my man Stan
I had to pay my dues running with other crews
Black Sheep is here but bitch ass niggas still snooze
It doesn't matter, Boo! I'll make you scatter
Don't flatter cause I don't want your bitch nigga chit-chatter
I got stacks and stacks of fat tracks and wax
But you played yourself so don't even ask
And I won't remind you of the stupid shit you did and said
Out the side of your head when you were sleeping dead
And now I'm charging like a bull and you're red
That's why I'm pulling fucking files like a fed
Checking pros, doing shows wherever they goes
Getting hoes and foes but don't sleep on those bros
Come legit, you need to quit with that ego shit
Because you're only as large as your last hit
We intimidate, niggas try to retaliate
Go on, guess your fate, cause it's your fucking guts I hate
I'll put on my Tims and kick 'em
Grab my shank and brrrr, stick 'em, ha-haha, stick 'em
Bitch! Now the Sheep are rolling deep with One Love
Fuck around and be a victim of, who?


Baby pah, you're best to learn that we yearned
And long earned, keep your concern, Black Sheep for the term
Forget status, we go for gold, who be creamy?
Cleaner no picture, clearly the victor, nigga, you seen me
With my man, no other mother could pull my brother
No way is it gay when I say we love one another
Uh huh, run for cover cause you're coming on the block
We're the best in the flock, was you born a fucking cock?!
Fuck your grade, our record play, man, it's like Jordan
Rock it better than NASA or lock it tighter than the warden
Huh, according to some emcees, hating and to end all their jel
We selling now, fuck like 'Mister Wendal'
Bendable plates, expendable tapes we ain't
Whitewash the Sheep when you're wack, save your paint
No haps, chaps, you might as well shut your traps
The gap's too big, dig, dapple over the maps
Doing curls with girls and blowing like Reg
Peep the slim slick, no Hammer, smack 'em sledge
Grammar, hot damn, I rip the rhythm up
And rock cuts like sluts with big butts do nuts for ducs
I split shit, you better see another
Down over a decade, this weight could never cover
Shucks, we hit fucks like nuts be touching Roscoe's
Pick up the old school flavour like you're name was Barro Pasco (???)
Asshole, my whole ass is all on me that's booty
My job's to clean up after my son cause that's my duty
Why bug, g? Could it be that you can't see
D, motherucker, D, motherfucker! D-
R-E-S, yes, with Lawnge since Sanford
Knowing we were destined to blow like Branford

Freak Y’All,Non-Fiction,1994,"Once again
The Black Sheep are coming back at cha
And I am the fabulous Chi
And we gonna do it, uh
Some real freestyle stuff
For all the ladies and gents
So check it out, y'all
Kick it

It's time, time, time for the freaker
To kick it through your speaker
For the b-boys and jameekahs
Contrary to popular, Sheep won't play the pop
And, uh, if it comes to we, we won't tell it to stop
Cause see, that's what we do and I know for sure
That I'm a razor sharp-witted black entrepreneur
Me, y'all, nicer than your mother on your birthday
Getting mad attention like the planet does on Earth Day
Er-hm, speaking of which, ain't it a bitch of a lesson
When they say you'll miss your youth
Because I know you feel the stress when
Chaos, chaos, chaos! is the headline
That means we're near our deadline
So take your mind out of the fucking fed time
Listen to the brother Dres, I says if only our records sold in Brazil
Still, I sell all types of formats
A sound around that you heeded, when it's completed
You can't beat it, it's what you needed: hip-hop
Hip-hop, it's the cool type of sound that says the niggas won't stop
The noise, cause sometimes can spawn so much confusion
I wish my people had the heart to start a revolution
Instead of picking on lil' ol' we
Put your mind where your nine's at and shoot to be free
B, I'm like smooth soarer with the music out beyond me
And make moves with more strategal than the army

(Freak freak, y'all, and it don't stop)
It's Black Sheep on the street with sure shots
(Freak freak, y'all, and it don't quit)
We make moves to the grooves with smooth shit
(Freak freak, y'all, said it don't stop)
It's Black Sheep on the street with sure shots
(Freak freak, y'all, yo it's def sounds)
Black Sheep blowing up like a hooker laying down

I'm all about peace, peace, peace in this nation
But if she played me in the womb I give my mother complications
The nigga named Dres I raps like a gangsta bitch bandanna
Peep the grammar, I appeal like banana pudding
I couldn't come if I couldn't get it done
I might dine and dash, I don't rhyme and run
I make it better than mo', my style is wetter than hoes
Than blasting H2O in the Fifties on negroes
Still, brothers of today are out to get it done
Don't call us Bigger Thomas, we packs a bigger gun
The updated version of the Glamorous Life
Sees me, the Nineties negro that's got a black wife
Believe me, clenching on a bag and acting cheesy?
Me settle with Edith, I'd rather chill with Weezy
Check it, I wreck it like a drunk driving wino
On a barbecue I'm getting crazy light like an albino
So follow the ceiling to the floor of the Apollo
Now swallow, with Franklins I'm catching lightning in a bottle
A phenomenon, whenever bombing I'm causing hysteria
I pick up the mic like the stage was the baggage claim area
Ticket, I kick it wickedly, I be Tiki tocking
Clocking, ripping all around your block
You're jocking the brother named Tiki
Better be known I freak it every time I speak
On CD, vinyls, cassettes and, um, that's the technique
I use, choose your choice and check it
I rips it on record, I wreck it when I rip it
The Sheep will resurrect it for all neglected
We had to intervene, Black Sheep back on the scene


I, I gotta work, y'all, gotta work real damn hard
Catch wreck and bust my ass so you won't pull my card
Still so many try, I have to wonder why they
Play with two fly brothers that they can't slay
I'm eager, anxious and I'm hungry to rip dubs like shrubs
Stressing every scrub in clubs across the country
Dres, I handle trauma like the plates in the vest
Drop a rhyme like a load shoots across a hooker's chest
Best believe I be no stranger to static
Word to Reby, my centipede be automatic
So don't do it cause, baby, hamburger won't help ya
If Dres gets ghetto-life like wool blankets found in a shelter
Where niggas hairy like Chuck Norris, I gargle with Lavoris
Make it clear on the chorus like I was Edgar Morris
Yeah, I stomp for reason not for feeling
Cause one man's floor is another man's ceiling
Now when I was a child I did things as a child
But now that I'm a man I bust your ass and get wild
My style from jump, nowhere near fear
Yeah, y'all talked this to that, I held my head and persevered
Cause now the live wire empire expands
With grands of fans, Black Sheep by popular demand
So throw your hands in the air and let 'em free fall
And just freak freak, y'all

Freak freak, y'all",https://genius.com/Black-sheep-freak-yall-lyrics

Fuck the red, white & blue, I'm with the black-black-black
You diss the brother Show, it makes me wonder
You put him to the test and watch the brother molest the SP-1200
Used to rhyme on calls and acapella
Now I'm doin shows forever, but I was always a 'goodfella'
You feel the wrath of the seven and a half
In that ass if you don't pass the microphone quick fast
Brothers been tryin to diss for years
As long as I'm respected by my peers
And get cheers - who the fuck cares?
Yeah, I'm weeded, but I'm undefeated
Niggas is heated because I'm makin a buck, yup, I succeeded
And ain't no time for no ego-trippin
Me and my homies are all for one, one for all, so let's see who's flippin
And I'm still with the brother Show

Peace to the Niggas,Non-Fiction,1994,"Now, if you got it going on make some noise
Peace to all the real grimy ghetto girls and boys
In my neighbourhood, whether black or hispanic
Yo, this is some positive shit but please don't panic
You can still rock to it so flock to it
Just open your mind, unwind, recline and lock to it
Come and rock with us, all night like Michael Jackson
Leave your guns and knives at home, black, that's all I'm asking
I'd like to go to jams and not see bullet sparks
So we can do some hip hop shows in public parks
A lot of devoters and promoters are scared of rap
But we can all come together clever and say bullcrap
Gotta get up, get up, gotta get over
I gotta wake niggas up like I'm down with Jehovah
Knock on a few heads and beg for some common sense
As I commence to convince, yo, I'm kind of tense
Cause niggas still wanna buckwild and profile
They're fronting hard but ain't go no style
Steadily teaching my younger brothers to kill each other
I hate to have to break out my Glock and teach another
Young soul about a bullet hole
For trying to play me and sway me, acting hard like the videos
Now, To all the shorties in the world
Listen up, That shit is just TV
Far from reality
And half the niggas you see on TV
Are fronting, They ain't saying nothing
So take your little ass, Somewhere
And watch Barney or something

Peace to the niggas in my neighbourhood
(Where?) In my neighbourhood
(Where?) In my neighbourhood
I said peace to the niggas in my neighbourhood
Cuase you're not dead so that means you're doing good

Yo, one time ripping it quick it's the clever brown boy
Joy to the world, girls and boys, there comes a choice
To advocate bad ass, bet I did it before
My POs name is Jord, he let me go on tour
Where I'm from, yo, you might see a finger in the gutter
In the ghetto with toast, best believe my shit is butter
Got to have it long before this rap shit, get back, bitch
If I'm stuck up much like a bandit I crank shit
Niggas get reprimanded, remanded and then branded
I delve into myself to draw the strength to overstand it
So ill as I roll up on the block theory yot (??)
Keeping it real with ShowB-I, yeah, we build a lot
Yo, move your b-u-t, the B/QE gets strong on the low
Giving a pound to Shorty Long, hop in the ride I gotta go
Gotta hit Queens, flying American, yo, Sammy, where's Troy?
Cleaning up on the streets, I goes there with my motherfucking boys
Shit's wrecked like grands in no time Astoria expands
Peace Russ, Jock, Tonto, but let me not forget Shamgod
My man since Holland Cove, making moves like Rucker
Live since one-oh-five, yo, it's Tiki motherfuckers
Jets to 'jects, I flex them cheques, my fam in the plan
And kick it to my cousins with some weed in my hand
Original bumrush was getting money on the hush, B
Keeping it real forever with my peoples working OT
Back in the seven, pick up the celly now I'm dialling F in
Put the volume up on BringIt, Legion getting in a session
From there to a Brucie tape, I'm almost on the fifth
An Uzi for my birthday, you know I shoot the gift
To a chickadee talking about she's wanting to get with me
Hey, I look up the block and see Lord kicking it with E
Hon's like ""I want you"", better believe me, baby's gonna got checked
I said ""My memory's bad, honey, I just fucking forget
Plus I've found my one love now, hon, I'm going to jet
And if we ain't playing Shaka we're catching power wrecks

B.B.S.,Non-Fiction,1994,"(feat. Emage)
(Dres)
Crumbs to the floor, bums off the wall
Stage landing, assured
I hit you all like a red ball
One to the two, 'D' to the 'R'
'E' to 'S' ­ me, baby pah
Doing my thing with my peeps
Don't sleep
(Verse One)
I bounce around the city like I was a personal cheque, see
I'm only running with niggas catching dayroom wreck, B
Keeping it real with appeal, I gets filthy like I'm dirty
Straight up and down, you'll say that ""them's the niggas, seven-thirty""
What now, bumba claat bwai like you got to say?
Me nah want no back chat, me nah come to play
So move it away, I say, before you can't move it away
Black Sheep, aight? Black Sheep, ayyyy!
Iiiii! Ohhh! Who? You, so
I'm rocking it on the regular, I pick it up like a 'fro
And your radio's fly when the Sheep's on the dial
We flaunt it, freak it and flip it freely with style
On top of the pile, funky laundry for Ron G
Crazy shout out to Poppi-pop and Conji
Keeping it tight, making a right since I left
Though it was never wrong, don't hate me cause I'm def
I'm just
(Chorus: Emage)
Bubbling brown sugar, let me tell you what it's all about
Bubbling brown sugar, make you want to dance and shout
Bubbling brown sugar, with a little jazzy beat
Bubbling brown sugar, Dres and Lawnge of Black Sheep
(Verse Two)
Plop-plop, fizz, fizz; oh, what a relief it is
To be the epitome of an emcee, getting biz ­ 'E'
After 'R', 'R' after 'D'
'S' at the end, yes y'all it's me
No need to doubt it, New York's got my loyalty
Boogie Down, astounding sound, representing royalty
Oops-a-daisy, maybe, oops-a-daisy
Boots upside the head of niggas who played D
Embalming like fluid, I'm keeping bullets like you threw it
Tip-top hip-hop, Black Sheep, new shit
The brown bubbling down to rip it on the double and
It's been three joints, everybody thinks we're smuggling
Ahem ahem, yeah, well you know me
I put dope inside your vinyl, cassettes and CDs
A shoo-in when I kick it in the Bronx like Benny Blanco
My flows dodge trucks when I pickup like a Bronco
(Chorus)
(Verse Three)
I save the drama for my llama, karma for your comedy
With a condom for your momma when she's up on top of me
I call it jealousy and you can call me hoe
Cause I was hitting Barbizons that you're never gonna know
All's well that ends well, here's to welfare
And friends that confront and lovers that care
I get down uptown from dawn to dusk, b
Taking to walking streets like I was Billy McCluskie
Fuck retro! Nineties in Harlem? You'll get wet, bro
Get low or you might need assistance from your head ho
Dolo, wreaking havoc on your phono, the igniter
I'm smoking cheeba, sonny, I run with street fighters
And I'm not hearing your noise, fearing your boys playing with toys
I'm crashing with a passion, trashing and smashing decoys
Bright lights and action, y'alls, you'll beg my pardon
But you can't be a Harlem player unless you play in Harlem
(Chorus)",https://genius.com/Black-sheep-bbs-lyrics
Autobiographical,Non-Fiction,1994,"It's the brown child, better version of the story
Sees Conji, a sister, mother played by Tori
In Astoria, kid named Tiki took the cake
The greens and the steak and the potatoes and the plate
Never a dummy, rejections are funny
Cuz, the first years of my life I thought that food stamps were money
So by ten I was the mess, got a men and then I had friend
So now I'm snatching pocket books with Sean Wilkinson
'Get that money, lil nigga' that's what they told me
I never sweated props cause like my pops they couldn't hold me
Until he found shorty's got it going on, rolling on
Damn, Who told? bendecion..
The Bland man, and my pop don't give a damn
The day I played with matches, took the stove to my hand
Hot temperature! He told me the players' version
The ego in submersion for the end of week excursion
Until I'm back, back on the scene
Like a ball on the green, giving strokes with my team
Cuz, despite the commentary pop told me, I'm lowly
And moms change-bank can't hold me, so
She don't scold me, she just grabs the belt
Knuckle the buckle, tells me all about the pain she felt
At the precinct when a pre-teen was spotted at the scene
Came up with the green, not a cop could intervene
(Mother)
Listen here, you little motherfucker
You ain't going to fuck with me
Got me coming to this damn precinct
Dammit, I'm a kick your motherfucking ass
Shit! You ain't going to drive me crazy
Now, dig it, Tori met Tom not too long ago
He was a nigga, yo, he said he had the flow though
He loved a bro, I know I didn't see you grow
To a TV show cause the nigga said we all could go
So I'm up and out of the ghetto, son of a gold miner
City-slicking Carolinian standing out like Ming china
A golden bull at heart though I moved around
The balls bounced to the bottom, settled at a small town
'Hey, boy! What's your name?!' First day, first fight
I'm out of New York and ""boy"" it don't sit right if you're white
Light were my steps from there
Did my dirt on the low, a Southern town nightmare
Cause the next year it was me and ""F"" on the furlough
We were the only Queens kids but there were other boroughs
With Rockwell, D-Ski, Ron Duke and Freddie
New York was represented like we danced for Rock Steady
Stan had tables and mics, every brother nice
Not only could we rip and rhyme but backspin and slice
With Paris and Foxy and Christina P's bust
You know them loud, raunchy, trouble-making niggas? That was us
A menace yet still I played tennis, ain't that cruddy
Advanced with the Reeboks, they called them 'cut buddies'
I hung with one, only one younger brother
Shorty Doo-Wop could cut and scratch up any other
Bigger than his size, was barely five feet
In '83 broke beats that today rock streets
With no one to grade it, still never debated
Some saw and hated but they never contemplated
Yeah! It was the foul child with wild styles, pal but not foul
A dis was never okay unless it came before corral
Pals of mine, peoples though were down
I graduate next week and, yo, next week I'm NY bound
Seven days from that one I'm leaving love that weighs a ton
I'm going to miss you niggas, yo, that rapping shit was crazy fun
But I'm leaving on the next bus
I've got your numbers and we'll keep in touch, I trust
Gliding, riding back to my domain
For love and money, fuck fame, my life will never be the same
As the next man's words, can you dig it?
I say I got a scheme, a-yo, I gots you figured
(Corner)
Yo, wassup, wassup. Is money out here?
Yo, I just got a call from that nigga Tiki
Remember that nigga Tiki?
He on his way from down South
My real pops was a pusher, when we left he had a section
So I keep it in the family, or at least I make connections
With the prime figures for affiliated support
In my purchase of cargo in the import and export
Flushing, Queens: back when junkies was the fiends
My childhood friends held buddha, had babies in dreams
I took pops off my shit list cause he had the fitness
To help Tiki get his, what the fuck, pop? Jehovah witness
What the fuck, pop? What's with the fizz-plop
I'm like, I can't put him down but the shit don't stop
Worked at a law firm, for lack of fear
I wrote a resume, spending words like a millionaire
From there to the bank, see the bank's down the block
So now I'm close to home, I clock, I plot
With Popote, he's my cousin and a wily one
Though the kid was younger, quick like thunder
With the heart to put you under
Props even, the shit can't fail
I saw Reese, bagged with Pote and made a sale
(Co-Dee)
Go ahead, get that money
Get that money!
I ain't going to let nobody see you
I got your back, baby, I got your back
You want five? You only got two
On one late night, I had made a nice amount
More than two weeks pay, playing with the new accounts
So I rose like a petal, fuck pops, I run with thugs
Levis, Tims, hoodie, coat, skully, drugs
Fatigues before they were the fashion
Pockets with work and others with cash in
Thought I was cool with tools and mad trap
My pops was like ""read this"" but I was like fuck that
So I jingle-jangled, clocked at every angle
Tiki's getting paid and his crew's star-spangled
And everyday, all day/night, yo, whatever
Niggas on the strip in sub-zero weather
Back before the first generation of fiends
My team was sheer cream, keeping dollar bills green
Fashion, Calvin cooler, playing Rick the Ruler
And I won't front on nobody cause I pulled on a woolah
Back in '86 ­ first, foremost and final
Rhyming on the corner, all I want to be's on vinyl
I bum rush and boom bash, not even for merit
Bounce out to see Reg and Joe down on Merrick
But mostly it's the strip that I played like a cock
On the block until the day I got knocked
(Police sirens to fade)",https://genius.com/Black-sheep-autobiographical-lyrics
We Boys,Non-Fiction,1994,"Ahh, shit! Get ready for the lyrical beat down
Go for your gat, nigga, you can catch a smack, clown
You think you get props, nope, you're in the wrong biz
Because the Sugar Dick Daddy Mr Lawnge is
Far from diesel but running shit like Eagle Beagle
I swing fast and kick ass like I was Steven Seagal
Sometimes I carry a Glock and other times an eagle
And my dick's so damn big that shit should be illegal
Went from a fade to a 'fro to my bald cut
I run with real niggas now and the rest are butt
Your reign is over and you feel it deep within your gut
Now is the boogie down Bronx in the house or what?
When I strike I strike hard and you won't like that
And if I strike out my empire strikes back
My niggas who knock you, so I won't dock 'em, yo
I run deep as if my name was Jacque Cousteau
You're a petty punk, pussy nigga from PC
I'll pull your file, I'm buckwild like I'm from DC
You wanted a sequel not equal so here it comes
Now sit back as we run a train on your eardrums

We boys! x3
We like here, yeah

If it ain't rough it ain't nothing
Big man Cules raise up and then I start thumping
A nigga always into something, now back in the days
I used to sell the woolie-whoos when I was pumping
But now I'm bending mic stands and gripping mics
On some physical type of shit, the type of shit I like
The type of shit I like is this shit that my peoples' on
Molecules, Cee-Low, Smash, Dres and my nigga Lawnge
Now I kick the titles Black Sheep, the Legion
Yeah, you bitch ass niggas, we're coming to your precinct
I'm from the Bronx, I'm a gangster from the projects
Is where I live, peace to AG and Showbiz
Bounce around with G, Show, Dres and Lawnge
And the seven-thirty-five Is, yeah, we got it going on
We grown men, we're not fucking with toys
Like I said before, yo, we boys

Down with the Sheep, roll out the black carpet as we spark it
One, two, check it out, uh, right on target
Aim for the heart, yo, get ill cause we're real
(THE LEGION'S IN THE HOUSE!) You know the deal
You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't
No matter what you want, you better not front
Cause I'm the nigga that's chilling, I seem kind of quiet
And if you even try it then get ready for a riot
One love, one land, how you win?
I owe you nothing because I'm down to the end
The Bronx is the borough, niggas crazy thorough
I'm looking at the Sheep and it's like looking in the mirror
Reflection, twenty-four/seven, representing
Hardcore connection, now listen, now listen
Chucky, I feel lucky, got shit caught in the smash
Peace to Barkley, Pinell and Boombash, aight?
Posse with the thickness as we kick this
Can I get a witness, down with Showbiz-ness
Whatever, take it the way it should be taken
Faking backs breaking, but makes no mistake


Round up, round up, round up, 1,2,3
On the down low it's only C double E
L-O, I flow, I flow, I'll let you know
When it's time to catch wreck I catch wreck like an old pro
You might have seen me in a video, heard it on the radio
Rolling with the Sheep, now here we go
One of us bigger, the other small, we never fall
A zigga-zigga, like I said before I love them all
Family affair, by the Legion I swear
To rip up mic stands and tracks to shreds and show no fear
One love with the bang, riding with the zootie
Watch your cutie cause I rap just like a doobie
You know the time and you don't need a watch
Just take a view so we can rock it on your block
It's shocking and tick-tocking all around with my flock
Even if the beat drops me and my crew will never stop
You don't know you better just come on and get with it
Hanging with my boys and we're kicking it

With no tricks the fix comes with dope fiend precision
I exercise and extinguish an emcee exhibition
I explode and expose, extreme my extent
I exist to expand, not excess but excellent
Strength to be the solo representative for the scene
I be the booming bashing, clocking crazy cash yet come from Queens
Fly like Marvel, addictive like Genesis
And if it was a comic, kid, I'd be your arch-nemesis
Blowing up the spot every time that I show up
Grow up before you get toe from the flo' up
Old skool like elementary, Watson
I rocks on, I mocks none and you can't take my spot, son
The one hands above all the shit stains
So hit yourself in the ass, bitch, and give yourself some brains
Here for the record, for the log, for the scope
You can keep your props cause I don't want 'em no mo'
You can't kill my flow, now you know, no denying
That nigga Dres is def, ah hell, he's death-defying
No lying, been dummy since I well a fed me goya
Yo, I'm just nice like Just Ice rocked Latoya
Here to drop a hammer, make you hop to hip grammar
Hot damn, I rock a rugged rhyme from the corner of the slammer
Black Sheep, fab where fam be
Cause I love you and you love me, yeah",https://genius.com/Black-sheep-we-boys-lyrics
Let’s Get Cozy,Non-Fiction,1994,"(Slick Rick sample)
It's cool .. that we create .. our mission
(Mista Lawnge)
Now, relax your body, your soul, let your mind be free
You know Mr Lawnge is hanging so come swing with me
Honey, I'll take you for a ride or better yet ride you
I love to be inside you, so peep the shit that I do
First I'll lick you from your pimples to your corns
Cause ain't no hoe perfect, that's only in the porns
Come with me and then watch me come
My tip's the only thing that'll make you say humm
Seven, six, five, four, three, twenty-one
Come on, big pussy, come and get some
Without haste, your time I won't waste
But if you want a taste bring your neck brace
I'm extremely long ­ slow down, you'll choke fast
Tip so big the Heimlich manoeuvre couldn't save your ass
Not to be bragging, your tonsils I'll be tagging
Yes, I'm going to use a bag and guaranteed to keep you gagging
So what's up, honey? No, you don't get no money
But I can tempt your tummy with the taste of nut and honey
The Sugar Dick Daddy can
If you do for me I'll do for you, a one-night stand
I'll hit you off, baby, shit I'm not selfish
But I brought a can of FDS in case I smell fish
With a flick of the tongue I can trim your hedge
I lick so much clit you'd think my name was Big Reg
Of course, I'll take you out and wine and dine you first
But, hold up! No drinks, I want to quench your thirst
Now why you blushing, baby, I see you coughing
Itching and scratching at your neck so very often
Tell Mr Lawnge your every need and I'll devote
No, you don't need a Luden or a Halls, I'll coat your throat
You can't deny so don't try to get fly
Or I'll just say bye-bye, you know why?
(Chorus x3: Slick Rick sample)
Cause it's cool when ya cause a cosy condition
That we create, cause that's our mission
(Dres)
Aww shit, girl, don't get me starting
I'll put you on your knees and grab your ears like you was Martin
Wet from Moet, she played the piper like a pal
What a great gal with a mouthful of Cristal
Cause honey saw me romping with the Legion
She wants to feel the pressure on her lower pelvic region
I'll do the things you wouldn't believe, I won't leave you falling
Like niggas that 'get it and come' like their mother's calling
Check it, I'll knee it, I'll feel it, I'll give it crazy joy
Cause I've been fantasising 'bout you since Ola Ray was in Playboy
No shit, I'm serious and I want to get physical
And leave you making noises like the sound of a busy call
On the phone, I'm nasty, be sure you wash your hands
Live, I'm playing condoms like it was a rubber band
Inside you, me, inside the plastic
You'll like it when I finish and your legs is acting spastic
Slow down, babes, I'll get a towel for a clean scene
And your uniform ­ honey, you made the team
Hip hip hooray to you, and all the same
Exercise and maintain for our next home game
Here's to all the bona fide with style
With lipstick on my boxers, I just think of you and smile
You buck wild child, thanks for the love, it's on
The sweaty steam roll, and thanks for not trying to touch my butthole
Now tell your girls I want them to meet my 'lil fren'
Nah, I'm playing, (kiss), until I see you again",https://genius.com/Black-sheep-lets-get-cozy-lyrics
Gotta Get Up,Non-Fiction,1994,"(Dres)
Black Sheep, ready to nova, I gotta get up and get over
Yo, Lisle, Lisle put a, put a little
Little bit of, bit of delay on my voice, please?
Lawnge, what's up, we gonna do these drops or what
Yeah, and it goes a little something like..
(Dres)
The freelance designer, yo, yo come on let's get this shit going
Dres, the impeccable nigga's on the mic and flowing
For those who made the purchase or came out on the streets
Black Sheep, bow your heads cause we're about to break beats
City lights shining with the ill timing
My glare everywhere, don't stare cause my shit's blinding
I think, I think niggas best not blink
Cause they stink and I'm looking at 'em pretty in pink
With a passion, I want to put a gash in your ego
Your flavour's artificial, a goddamn placebo
Black, you can't believe it, you gotta dry heave it
Fake niggas can't achieve it, fake bitches can't be-weave it
From the streets of New York to where I be on the ladder
Fatter, got your bitch saying ""Baby, what's the matter?""
As a matter of fact, it's Dres the knuckle-dragger
With a fresh manicure so I got my cloak and dagger
I roam with the grifters, my game's ever true
My style's old skool like the new school review
I gets biz, on and on for days
And amaze with plays for non-gays, queens
Nah, fuck that! Queens, I ain't hushing
I'm crushing mafucks with a bumrush from Flushing
A member me, getting busy with GMC
Back when Rick was fresh and slick the nigga Doug E
Yeah, Tiki doing the freak, B
Backtrack a bit before the baby beat me
Got more peoples than any seen in the video clip
And we was getting life's desires from a strip
Hand-to-handler, and the gambler
Give me the eggs, black, I'm the scrambler
You too, a mafucking lyric in a song
Helping that philly blunt shit catch on
Popote light the bat, pass the shit to AZ
Pass the shit to Lord, yo, Lord give the shit to me
Yo, Wild pass the shit to Skip, Skip roll another
The brother light's about to flip
It's buckwild Bland with the horrifying team:
Homicide, Cess, Doctor Sharjean
My nigga Black Ron, Steve O, Val, Amar, JR, Reese
Popo ­ peace!
Born to KE and all my peoples that be
But foremost, the whole fucking Vargas family
We wrote the scripts and the times were fit
Original New York, New Jack City type shit
Now we still we make moves only to different grooves, black
Sheep, in fact get back, it's simple as that this
(Chorus: Black Sheep)
Gotta get up, get up, gotta get over
I gotta get mine, yo, it's time to prevail
Gotta get up, get up, gotta get over
I paid my respect, the cheque's in the mail
Gotta get up, get up, gotta get over
I gotta come krill, yo, my skills won't fail
Gotta get up, get up, gotta get over
Been holding my breath, yo, it's time to exhale
(Mr Lawnge)
Back in the days of bullshit when I was a small guy
Taking the train home as I roamed but still I
Never had a clue of what I was going to do
To you, to you, and you, and you, and you too
Make the world jump, the girls hump, collect a lump
And make your speakers pump 'back on the scene
Crispy and clean' Yo, the rap title's redeemed
So you can save it for your next dream
Black Sheep is taking rap to the extreme
We got you coming back for more like a crack fiend
But now I stick with nothing but my own clique
I'm getting paid for what? Talking about my dick
It's my prerogative, sucker
Now you can tell your father that I'm the motherfucker
On the TV, no, you can't see me
Cause I'm on the DL, hiding from the industry
Niggas that be getting on my nerves
Trying to find the fucking beats that we preserve
See, I've been digging in the crates for a minute
Even my grandma's, believe I was up in it
Taking it, breaking it, trying it, flying it
I didn't have the money so, shit, I wasn't buying it
I had to take what I could get and be happy with
Not only records but clothes and food and shit
Niggas trying to get over on, niggas trying to get over on
Niggas trying to get over
That's why I stay refined, and never think about the other kind
Fake niggas trying to get mine
I had to hold my head despite what was being said
I used to wish that I had some lead
That I could buck off, but then I got my luck off
Away from Carolina, yo, I had to step the fuck off

Summa Tha Time,Non-Fiction,1994,"We like blowing up the spot
(Summa the time)
We're known for fronting, not
(Summa the time)
We give our shows all we got
Wreck the stage and lots play us
Like the sun because we're hot, hot

It's Black Sheep, beep-beep, everybody on your feet
Catch the beat, sweet sweet, got you bopping down the street
Shorts to short-sets, shorties for short sex
Forties, my forte: butterfill and four Becks
That defines Dres, d-r-e-s, no further ado
I charcoal, broil and foil more than any barbecue
In the breeze like Lenin, listen when I'm beginning
In Nueva York, better known as kings' dominion
We're back again, smacking beats across your head and back
And when you front I'l make you stand out like a fat African
Peace to all down South, I know it's hot as Hades
Love to all the fam-a-lam I scrambled in the Eighties
Now we're in the Nineties, as months go where the hour went
I stack mint and think of what? Black empowerment
I think wife, and black child to raise together
I think about the winter knowing nothing last forever
In this world things happen at the drop of a dime
Some things never happen at all, and yes y'all

(Summa the time)
I'm hitting your face like the breeze
(Summa the time)
It's like I rip the mic to so many degrees
Huh, I'm docking it in your port
I'm slamming it in your court
Me taking the shorts?
I'm holding the for'ps, child please

Some of the time I'm with my crew, some of the time I'm not
Bouncing down the block, blowing up the spot
But only when it's hot do I see nuff niggas looking at me
Displaying signs of jealousy, it means they're still 
Black With NV
I go by the name of the Sugar Dick Daddy Lawnge, ripping the song
Suckers see me, wanna be me, but I'm creamy and they're dead wrong
To whom it may concern
: yo, don't even try, kid
Because you couldn't see me even if I was your eyelid
When I rhyme for the summertime, believe I can
Bring more relief from grief than the Icy man
Be it your front yard, your stoop or porch
Like the Kackalackan sun, I'm guaranteed to scorch
I know it was about time we dropped the now, oh gosh
We got more niggas rolling up than even at the car wash
Yeah, we're here to tan that ass like the summer sun
For the nigga that tried to dis us, we know he's the dumber one
When you hear the Sheep are rocking be on the lookout
Cause we gather more hungry crowds than a cookout

(Summa the time)
I like to tour around the world
(Summa the time)
I'm chilling hard with my girl
I like to wake late
For summer heat's sake
Listen to the fat beats we make
And chill on a summer break

It's the summer blitz, dips with pretty lips
Bros with or without doe flip for hits
Yo, microphone check one, be no other heap-topping
I rock a flock and mock, Sheep-Sheep rocking
Sonny, can you feel me? Honey, I be fly
Money making, really there's a ribbon in the sky
For One Love, I'm kicking my diction less the fiction
Non-believers thought me hiking and fishing
Now I spike them like a Viking
Wildstyle, like summer in Astoria
Way back my peoples made 
Ajax join the Warriors
Back when park jams found me trying to see the band
Until parties in the centre saw DJs as the man
A bird, a plane, feel the breeze changing lanes
I put a chill in your veins, even on a crowded train
I'm cool, more cool than Morris dropping Time
-Less legit hits for some ones in ninety-nine
Since a long time ago, I'm getting mine
Put the 'genuine' in genuine, son, I shine

(Summa the time)
I'm taking respect, do you copy?
(Summa the time)
I'm whyling with my baby boy Papi
I'm with the Lawnge one
Running, ripping up tracks un-
'Til the summer skill that we flex
Says it's time to chill

Yeah
And they keeping it real, you know what I'm sayin?
And now they gonna do they thing once again
Cause it's been a while
So yo God, what's up?
Yo do your thing paw

Kids rave and rant, yo they chant for the phantom
And some say handsome, they weed out, your ransom
Ask one, they'll tell one, I do my thing well son
My name's ringing bells come
To break your half nelsons
Immaculate Queens General child
Headed for Federal wild, ahead of schedule
I jostle for revenue while
He was sound, I found my father was my rich figure
He used to hustle with the father of his bitch nigga
I'll squeeze the trigger, like you dissed my little sister mister
Twist a blunt with my wrist, and spark it up in front of this 'ter
Sometimes, I hit Astoria, where niggas still play Corridors of Death
Before I go, I drop that one at the door of 2F
Whoever's there, like I was, could probably use it
We couldn't do shit but catch vics, and if the shoe fits, remove it
Tony Hands-high, Tom and Jerry, Scam squad
Yo my man was  Sham God, growing up with J Cobb
Now in time, we grew apart
With the weight you inherit at birth, and the larcen in our hearts
Yo why do we laugh? tell me, why do we frown?
Why does Stevie wonder? yo why is James brown?
Some things are unexplainable, and some things just win
Yo, everything's attainable, that's why I do my thing

You can see my skin got scarred

Wildin' on the boulevard
Making crazy noise with the boys, down to pull a niggas card
(Do your thing paw)
My projects gets devotion
(Do your thing paw)
Back my Mama did the Coco-motion
(Do your thing paw)
The buckwild kids, flipping pages on a notion
When you see Jaws, and now we're 'noid of the ocean

Before This Or That could ever commence in my mind
I made the moon shine, like Capone committed crime
Was in my enzymes to rock it for times
And brothers that made G's
Without a basketball or rhymes, please
I lock blocks, without a lead, I leave Cop hops
My brown flock, smoking green crops, selling black tops
Summer of '85, Prince and Rosie is the best
The blessed, justify with a pro, couldn't fess
We never play brain, cause then you're waiting for rain
Like a vet, I light a cigarette when I want the train
You can't afford what I paid
With Sha-Gene, Born and Lord
And word to little rich kids about to get floored
By the pocket-picking, Philly licking, vic'ing individual
O.G. and that be, the god that's original
Think about it baby, you know me
I tried to play low-key, but everybody knows
Where the toke be
Under your nose, I blow foes up like mortar
Cause, my crew make waves where you don't even see water
I'd slaughter, long before you ever play me for a porter
And tell you to your face, you're out of order

(Do your thing paw)
Hand to hand, the money in stacks
(Do your thing paw)
Snatching pocket-books to Russian mink hats
It's a live show, gotta focus 5-O's on the low
And it don't stop, Jack, until you stop being black
(Do your thing paw)
I never wanna be, any broker
(Do your thing paw)
I'm a first generation blunt smoker
Skill, the cypher gettin money, we'd build
When the spliff went around, right after English was spilled

Now-a-day I lay like heroin was in my vein
I get nice, and think twice about the high price of fame
We don't care, beware, if it moves, black attack it
My man Peewee bought a bullet, with his Red Alert jacket
Some of my peeps left wills, and others are owning buildings
It's hard coming home, when there's nothing that you're skilled in
I, nowaday, put away rhyme and reasons
Cause some drive by, but in New York they lay and leave 'em
Nobody confronts, we hide behind guns and blunts
Now the powers that be happy getting everything they want
Cause now there's a deficit, for lack of slave labour, por favor?
Somebody my peoples need a saviour
Peace to understanding my brother, understanding my brother
Every day the sun shines, love from your mother
God bless, the child that's got his chrome
Yo nowaday, keep your problems kid, cause I got my own
The timezones, I jones for my sanity, I told yer's
I, woke up this morning and the world was on my shoulders
They say, I'm destined to repeat, we'll see how fall that rise
So when you look up to my son, I bet you see me in his eyes

(Do your thing paw)
Sometimes, it makes your wanna holla
(Do your thing paw)
I do or die daily for a dollar
(Do your thing paw)
Kids dash, up out the Dollar hall without a pass
I gets cash, and plus I'm more creative than the class
(Do your thing paw)
I got the sound, you need not shove
(Do your thing paw)
Yo, there'll never be another love
Fuck it in a bucket, cause my skill's too big to tuck it
And the niggas at my back, would feel so cheated if I snuck it

Yeah, unh!
As we do, as we do, as we do
What we muthafuckin' want to
Check it out, shouting out to my peoples
Wherever you be
Yo Big Val, Big Popote, AZ and Sess
Yo what's up Vianca?
My man Jacque, my baby Nina, Bullock
Peace to  Sayquan and Nanos
My man Steve O, and J. R
Yo Quran, what's happening?
Michelle Stewart, and Shaka Zu
Yo Laurelton and Lafayette you know exactly how we do

Who’s Next?,Non-Fiction,1994,"(feat. Sweet T)
(Chorus x4)
I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
(KRS-ONE: Oh! It seems that you're a ho)
I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
I don't want you no mo'
(Mr Lawnge)
Really doe, really doe, you's a really silly ho
To think that you could fuck with me then step to my bro
No, I don't think so, nor do I drink, so
That seems to me to be the reaction of a stank ho
How could you play yourself when I thought so much about you?
So now the Sugar Dick Daddy's got to do without you
I guess I'll proceed to the next
I'm going to miss your eyes, your smile and, of course, the sex
From the very first day I met you I didn't think I'd get you
That's why I didn't sweat you
I knew there was another because I saw you with him
Still you turned around, winked your eye and gave me rhythm
I said ""Oh shit, it's time to get with it""
Pulled out my blade and your man's neck split
I grabbed you by the hand, he didn't understand
But I stepped off the scene just knowing I was the man
We enjoyed the date, also the night
Then I said to myself ""Self, something ain't right""
Excuse me, miss, can you tell me what's the twist
It seems to be you're too promiscuous
She was wookin pa nub in all the wrong faces
Wookin pa nub in all the wrong places
Man, I didn't know what to think of you
When I found out you ran through my whole damn crew
Molecules, Cee-Low and Chucky Smash
Showbiz, AG and the whole Boombash
You hit them all off, it wasn't just me
And then I heard you boned Chi-Ali, damn!
I said ""Oh no, ho, you gots to go
But take my number though cause, yo, you never know""
See the way Mr Lawnge likes to play them
I only like to lay them around five AM
(Chorus x4)
(Dres)
Now, when I first saw ya I tried to ignore ya
Cause niggas was playing you closer than rice and goya
Face like Halle, ass like Angina
Feet like Pebbles and cook like Aunt Jemima
Plus I hear that she's quick to bring a nigga to the brink
Beaver? Nah, believe her shit's all mink
She played the party scene like she had a death wish
And niggas crazy sweated her like she wrote the guest list
Out of sight, me and my peeps are getting solar
She walked by, I reached out and said ""Yo, Nola""
""That's not my name"", I said ""I know, but anyway
Honey, take this number you can call me any day""
Quicksand! I didn't understand that she's a fan
Rather that honey wants more props than a kickstand
She'd told her friends what I told mine here:
""I'mma knock that ass in due time, hear?""
She called the next day and I'm like ""What's your occupation?""
The method in my madness was the same of operation
She was a po' ho, a hobo, a part-time boho so
Yo, for the ring, she's giving low blows
Schematic peeped, she came by to let me hammer her
She's looking right, damn, I should've hid the camera
She hit me off but, yo, it's my word
She got dropped by the first, picked up by the third
I lay down sleepy, that shit was crazy creepy
Rrring! I pick it up, this nigga's like ""Somebody beep me?""
I'm feeling cheated, the shit shall never be repeated
Before I get defeated, yo, I'll beat it
Cause I use steel-plated latex lately
And when they say 'downtown', yo, I stop at 42nd Street
Cause to get laid many prices are paid
And I'm so 'noid I don't want a band-aid
I try to stay aware of the drama, it's crazy
Plus, see I got to tell your mama that I'm swayze
(Chorus x4)
(Sweet T)
Cheers, to the gigolos and the hoes
About to open up your nose cause that's the way my love flows
To every man that said he'll never get up in it
If I said that you could win it you'd be at my house in five minutes
The sugar's so sweet and if I let you get me in between the sheets
It's ­ my - beat
I'm telling you again and again
I don't get nasty with the men like I get nasty with the pen
People like to call girls that like men with money trash
But you's an ass if you don't like a nigga with cash
I don't really care, I like the big bucks
So if I gotta be trash, yo, fucking call a garbage truck
Love don't have a price but you gotta know the deal
I'm a tell it like it is cause I like to keep it real
When a man's broke he's got his hand on the trigger
But if his pockets got figures he ain't sweating the next nigga
I like a nigga that rolls strong, when I'm in the studio
Making songs, he's out making the pockets long
So peace to the niggas with wealth, niggas that go for self
Cause I ain't fucking with nothing else",https://genius.com/Black-sheep-whos-next-lyrics
Shorty,8wm / Novakane,2006,"Intro:(shorty...shorty...shorty)
She caught me off guard
Love is a gamble, life is a lesson
By golly when I met you, you made a good impression on me
She caught me off guard, now bring it to me
Love is a gamble, life is a lesson
By golly when I met you (when I met you, when I met you)...
Now I'm not tryin' to be rude, I know you hear it everyday
But if I didn't say hello to you, then I would be gay
And if I didn't tell you what I see it wouldn't be wise
'Cause everynight I see myself with you at every sunrise
Hypnotized, I'm in a daze (I'm in a daze)
And I'm so confused cause you just might walk away
Like you got somethin to lose
But I beg to differ, if I may be so blunt to say
That the heat of a hundred-and-one suns can't equate
To the warmth you generate and give to me with a smile
All I'm asking for is opportunity, lady I'll show you
That we could grow to do what only a few ever share
As a love affair, no one is true, if only you knew
I find myself just hitting foul balls
And I'd give anything just for a number to call
Make you glad that I came, I know this world is insane
'Cause here I am in love with you and I don't even know your name, I'm sayin'(what?) I said I'm sayin'
Like a hit of ectasy, what's the recipe?
I pass here everyday, same time, just to see
Hear my literature, can I sit with ya?
You embellish my thoughts, how can I get with ya?
Were ya heaven sent? Elegant, benevolent
Please excuse me when I say that he's irrelevant
You're my ritual, loving you habitual
You're this drug in my vein that I'm addicted to
N-N-Now
Now I don't mean to be crass I know you hear it all the time
But if I didn't try to talk to you, I'd be out my mind
So 'til ya be outta time you're undivided is mine
I said I find ya defined and I just wanna intertwine
You probably think I got spine, and I just wanna bone ya
Looking for a 'Good Time' like JJ, Penny, Willona
Know plus she a gain, natural, face of a flower
Smelling like Chanel comes out the faucet of your shower
Yo I guess even a rose next to you in that dress
Would close envious, you could leave men penny-less
No question, eyes could give a priest an erection
And God had to be horny how he blessed the section
Of your torso
More so, you got your thing together
Lookin' like your feelin' like butta-soft leather
And it's no game, in a world that's so insane
I could fall in love with you without me knowing your name
I'm saying
Like a hit of ectasy, what's the recipe?
I pass here everyday, same time, just to see
Hear my literature, can I sit with ya?
You embellish my thoughts, how can I get with ya?
Were ya heaven sent? Elegant, Benevolent
Please excuse me when I say that he's irrelevant
You're my ritual, loving you habitual
You're this drug in my vein that I'm addicted to
I know I sound kinda slick and I'm not tryin' to pull the wool
But what you do everyday besides just lookin' beautiful
Gotta be crime related, you stand out like a clue
Caught up in ya orbit my thoughts revolve around
Who but you could make me choke? And I don't even get high
It's my word that ghetto love is the law that I live by
If I don't get it right, I got it bad, and what I'm sayin
Is a life full of all you got ??
What you want girl?
Ectasy ain't sex to me, you can leave the rest to me
I'm a do what keeps you next to me
Let me open up the door and make you familiar with foreign
The object of my affection will live forever, never boring
Not your average missionary, Drez the roller coaster
I'd park a Testarosa and walk just to get closer and talk
Love and pain, I know it's sounding like game
'Cause here I am in love with you and I don't even know your name, I'm sayin'(what?) I said I'm sayin
Like a hit of ectasy, what's the recipe?
I pass here everyday, same time, just to see
Hear my literature, can I sit with ya?
You embellish my thoughts, how can I get with ya?
Were ya heaven sent? Elegant, Benevolent
Please excuse me when I say that he's irrelevant
You're my ritual, loving you habitual
You're this drug in my vein that I'm addicted to

Novakane,8wm / Novakane,2007,"They say what is, is what was
But what was could never be
Ain't nothing new under the sun
Y'all ain't doing nothing but some shit I already did
Let me tell you where you're going
Yo

Said I'm not gonna say ""you"", y'all
I'm gonna say ""we""
Sometimes I sit and think about it
Yo, how numb could we be
How could it go so far, how'd it get so funky
That we could walk a mile in the footsteps of a porch monkey
That we could break a barrier without one key
Then turn around and try to imitate a mob flunky
We're not together, y'all
And most of us have forgotten
Those at the top don't want nothing to do with those at the bottom
And that's bad when you put a pricetag on sad
Had aspirations of a kingdom but the plans gone bad
And every man's gone mad
I'm feelin so defeated
Wasted so much time chasing what I never needed
'Til I heard it echo, ""Let go""
""You'll be richer when you stop chasing crumbs 'cause the cake's the bigger picture""
Got too many pennies in our hands to hold the dollars
Got too many problems in the world to kill the scholars

Said I'm so numb
I really couldn't care in the end
That I'm so dumb
I plied against myself never depended
On no one
Sometimes I need to pray I find way but I'm
So numb, and I'm so dumb
And I'm so lost
I never thought to put it on a scale
What my soul cost
The crime, I got no money for my bail
Suffered no cause
Sometimes I need to pray I find way but I'm
So numb, and I'm so dumb

Sometimes I'm sitting at the window
And the world that I see
Makes me ask myself the question
""Yo, how numb can we be?""
We're all descendants of the people
That they chose, made slaves
Nowadays, they pay my people money not to make waves
Now that's a house nigga
So glad we're not in the field
We're glorified instead trying to destroy and rebuild
How many hopes have we killed by doing nothing at all
Or planting seeds to succeed by either drugs or basketball
Or worse, that a rapper laying your life on the top
I listen to the radio and yo, that ain't hip hop
So numb to make it big is the way that I chose
So I could rip off all the children for my sneakers and clothes
I thought we'd lower the prices not give companies the license
To divide and conquer us with the modern day devices
We take what's priceless with hope for personal wealth
Turn a life into a struggle for life itself (can you feel me?)

Said I'm so numb
I really couldn't care in the end
That I'm so dumb
I plied against myself never depended
On no one
Sometimes I need to pray I find way but I'm
So numb, and I'm so dumb
And I'm so lost
I never thought to put it on a scale
What my soul cost
The crime, I got no money for my bail
Suffered no cause
Sometimes I need to pray I find way but I'm
So numb, and I'm so dumb

Said it's so hard
I wonder if the world can feel my pain
We've been so scarred
We close our eyes and breathe the novacaine
I get so numb, and wonder where this road is taking me
Has the world mistaken me, and has God forsaken me?
Said it's deep down
It's out of me, I know we can prevail
This sweet sound, though most I mind wind up dead or in jail
'Cause we don't do what we could
'Cause we can't do what we should
We been hoodwinked, I guess that's why we repping the hood
Although we don't rep us, it lets us die without a care in the hood
Your only thought is to get the fuck outta there
And show your children a change, sometimes you give it your all
To lose your way the day you say that, ""I'll be better than y'all""
'Til we're numb of all the power we possess, unified
Eyes closed, like the problems of the world blew inside
'Til we're numb from all the ice pushing a newer ride
And the artery we cut, we die, suicide

Said I'm so numb
I really couldn't care in the end
That I'm so dumb
I plied against myself never depended
On no one
Sometimes I need to pray I find way but I'm
So numb, and I'm so dumb
And I'm so lost
I never thought to put it on a scale
What my soul cost

There is no use for any guns
It’s time to prove that you’re my friend

Have to stop it is too much
I don’t wanna sing
There’s no word I can touch

I’m lying on the ground of the sea
Where they can’t get me
I’m deaf - I’m dumb, I’m blind, my mind -
Don’t wanna hear what’s coming out
I’m sinking - down to the ground -
Too deep to see solutions
No time the revolution comes
A new beginning is absurd
Too many nerves have been destroyed
The neutrons gone, they left the core

Don’t touch the screen

Trust In Me,Not Part of the Deal,2009,"One day I gave up my hope
No one was on my side
I was not strong enough
I was on no one’s mind
Bleeding from all of you
No one noticed me
Meaningless for everyone
I just wanted to
Shout
Out
Loud
Out of my mind
To trust in me is everything
I can ever do, I can ever do
So please, oh please
Don’t break the trust in me
You want me to be like you
Nothing else counts
I was not strong enough
I was on no one’s mind
Bleeding from all of you
No one noticed me

Yo, I'm only trying to party tonight, I can't play
My shorty will be up in the morn', I can't stay
The party's rocking lovely indeed, yo DJ!
Turn it up, you know it's nothing but love on replay
I'm only trying to party tonight, I can't rock
Although they breaking day from the Bay to Bangkok
They talking 'bout the Sheep on the block
The band's hot
I guess we all addicted to fun, can't stop
Tonight, I'm trying to take it beyond a two-step
My chicks hype, body type be, acoustic
With friends, from a fantasy night, never ends
So you know it don't stop when the party descends, still
I'm only trying to party tonight, you ain't know?
I got to catch a flight to a yacht, I can't go
No bueno, got some people to see, see?
I'm only trying to party tonight yo, that's me

(I've never been a fan of the one night stand)
I'm only trying to party tonight

I'm only trying to party tonight, cause I can
Ain't tripping if they're slipping or riffing with my man
I am, be the chick who be stepping it all night
Sipping on a fifth before jetting, I'm alright
I work too hard to not party the same
Do not pardon my frame when I bother your dame
With lock-popping my arms
Sorry I'm a hard damm dancer
In the middle of the floor
(She's the bomb, can't stand her), I know
I shake it like the bartender making my, drink
I'm a lady though, think before you play me close
Party-on further than Wayne Garth
Harder than Richards Keith on his main dose
High! It's Jean switching her hips, not Shakira Something terrible, hear me, I'm incredible, yes!
Please Dres leave her some tips, 'cause at the bar
I'm treating her, we leaving here with, so let's get down

Yo, I'm only trying to party tonight, I ain't sprung
Elated, I'm a product that be Native to the Tongue
Related, I'm the object that equated to the sun
Just trying to teach the words to the songs you ain't sung
Like, I'm only trying to party tonight, so let's go
The world is waiting for us, there's a purpose to the flow
So bro's give a pound and sis get besos
'Cause love is all around, we mixing pesos
I'm only trying to party tonight, yo get fixed
We chilling, chicks are chunky, getting blissed off the licks
Take her to the dancefloor, get her hips in the mix
And if you, ain't 'bout a good time, then kick bricks
I'm only trying to party tonight, yo please trust
If shorty rub up on me with that booty, I'mma bust

Got a special guest
See, see-
This is true stuff
It's too real
Suave the Performer coming up:
Listen up

I always told that we ain't never had the money
So I never asked for things
And I was always being told that I would not amount to nothing
So I pushed away my dreams
And then I went into The Pin
And got depressed because of stress
But then I looked within myself
And knew that somehow I was thinking very different from the rest
So I found myself a pen
And then I wrote away my issues
Had an issue after issue
Momma please put down the tissues
Don't you know how much I miss you?
I been fighting for my breath
Cuz I been strangled with this test
Trying to walk a better path
But you know sometimes I need rest
Trying to make it through the bar
But walking straight is kinda hard
There's too much on my mind
And I been playing different cards
Trying to rise into a king
And spread my heart along the way
But I been fearing that I'll end up being caught up in the fame. Dang

But you ain't doing any better
And she ain't doing any better
Yeah, he could do a little better
But you ain't doing any better
And they ain't doing any better
Yeah, they could do a little better
Yeah, we could do a little-
More, I suppose

I'm serious, I'm serious
Emotions delirious
This world is so mysterious
How can you not be so curious
Man I'm just so furious
Thinking how we started at the bottom
Now we trying to climb on top of pyramids
Thank you Lord for the experience
I used to feel like a lab rat in an experiment
Now all the bull, I'm not hearing it
Obstacle course, I'm clearing it
Just hear me vent, please
I'm down on my knees
Asking to God please
Show my people mercy
We been down for centuries
But like a Phoenix, we rise from the ashes
All the hate, soon backlashes
All the wars we've had too tragic
Man our graveyards getting too massive
And we blind to fact need glasses
Why people can't show compassion
Tell me how did all of this happen?
I don't know how, I don't know how
But I know now
I started from the bottom from the ground
Now it's time to be the king of this town
Making sure we afloat and never drown
Keep your head up and never look down...And never back down

But you ain't doing any better
(you could do a little better)x2
And she ain't doing any better
(she could do a little more)x2
Yeah, he could do a little better
(he could do a little better)
But you ain't doing any better
(you could do a little better)x2
And they ain't doing any better
(yeah they could do a little better)x2
Yeah, they could do a little better
(come on)x2
Yeah, we could do a little-
Less...

On the Wall,Trespass: Music From the Motion Picture,UnKnown,"Verse One:
Black-Sheep
Spell it to the letter
I'm not a forgetter
Some could tell my story
But who could tell it better
Nobody slimmer
Thinkin he's a winner
Pullin on the wool-er
Finger on the trigger
Scramb-a-lin, ramb-a-lin
Thinks he la right gamb-a-lin
Ambul-ance head crack
Cause he took a chance
That you didn't rip, the one he didn't think a flip
But if I'm shakin ya down, believe you're losing your grip
Money I'm rollin I'm rollin I'm rollin I'm rollin again
Honeys I know
That wanna know me adapt
Let me tell a joke
Cause a funny'll get
Slept onna step I'm gettin money again
Yo flim to the flam to the D to the poise
Seperate the men from the boys, those are the toys
Negroes'll front, that's if they got what you want
But yo they freeze on a stunt
I'm feelin more than a blunt
Never was a gangster even at a street pix
But swingin on a swinger you'll be strollin with a limp
So get up easy cause it's simple as this
Give us a shot how could you think that I miss
Yesterday's a memo, the demo sold a bundle
No I'm not conceited though for you I won't be humble
Been around the block and it ain't our first day out
Crazy with a stick and yo I throws a blow a-way out
Kids who use to stay out till I roll needed the gray out
Hobbies we attackin now we're skelly and knockin clay out
Papas on the hurough, in every borough
Nobody could front, ya see my family's crazy thorough
Two quince sure
And yo the others are done
No fables at the table
We'llerit the no that's in my blood
So I, stand tall
And lay for the call
To counter-react
Because we're real I tell ya who's gonna pack
Chorus
Verse Two:
Yo it's not easy at the top
Which is why we play the back
Not to say that we don't strive
In fact, to be exact
It's a one-sided coin
Gotta know how to flip it
And 
I'll say ""lucky in the fifth""
If you ask me for a tip
Now we're back on
Word to the life build receipt
Me thinks this things are broken
Lings how can we be complete
Heads always collided
With the brain we could be glidin
While we stab him in the back
When I see Isrob beside him
So Lawnge/long (huh), we waited
So Lawnge/long (what), we hated
Play it to this day it doesn't have to be debated
If I played it as an ego
With a final life and group ins
On Lawnge (Never party poopin
Scoopin while my loopin went in
Rhymin I'm climbin check it out
It's like this all the time)
And I know (and I know)
And I know (and I know)
Black Sheep freak sweet styles
Just like we're supposed ta
Cause Dres will pull the wool
Cause before Black Sheep made a poster
Always liftin skirts
Fore we ever made a t-shirt
And we been leapin obstacles
Before the game of Q*bert
Take this or that, both of that
Lookin past the cat
If she was playin possum
Then they pull a rabbit from the hat
Chorus
Verse Three:
Now rich man, poor man
Beggar-man, thief
If I were an engine
I wouldn't be the chief
You can play the chief
But we be tipper tee-pees
Cause money he don't owe me
And honey she don't see me
Chuckle at your belt buckle
Whether or not I'm on the DL
Expedition with permission
If the mission were impossible
Wouldn't be here dear
Black Sheep droppin songs
That last as long as Frigidaires
Call me un-Dres Dres go Dre go
Not to run it in the ground
I gave the recipe to Prego
Have to sell a million pounds
The ya-yo, from Play-Doh
Party the we started
Runnin charted some
Where? Over the rainbow
Guess I suffer from C-R-S
Cause I forgot 'em
Lyrics I got em you need em you need em I got em
Can't stand the fall
The beef out of reach
I mean the stakes are too high
So I got to get each
And every single solitary
Ligit digit on my leg
You're buggin cause we did ya
You come and we get ya
Clearin my eyes
Me and a tear in the corner
Layin on ya I'm gonna I'm gonna lay it on ya

Still in the Ghetto,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Artist: Black Sheep
Album:  Similak Child 12""
Song:   Still in the Ghetto
I guess I gotta give em
Headaches over headbanging beat breaks
Lyrics know the moment cause you rode 'em to my scrotum
Hoping makes a pretty penny, if any, one of many, we're coming through
Smacking ya wits I've always seen in Street Fighter II
Big D's like a Honda, bite like Blancka, or flip Ms. Chun Li best be easy baby
You'll get the fair fist from the figure only get O sopranos
Get dismantle, too hot to handle, I am
Grunt fiddle hawk when I talk
Then I speak in half Puerto Rican brother from New York
Boy I'll smack you wit a ?corlota coat hero?
You didn't figure nigga I'll smoke ya
Sharp duck, I'm running amuck
I jock it for the mic to prove I give less than a fuck
Peep it, I'll freak it then sneak it across the border
Not troublemakers and we're not taking your order
The water, don't wanna be deceived
I'm bucking some change, now I feel fucking naive
Cause I'm living my day beat in the city of scum
I'm in a different one daily and it's yours, that's the one
That got drop, crooked cop shoot sure shots
Putting technically emphatically people in plots
Now that I go pass go, I don't know, yo, bro
I feel like I'm still in the ghetto
(Hook)
Put me in a house on the hill (still in the ghetto)
Hit me till my tanks on filled (still in the ghetto)
Get me a job so I don't have to rob, why do I wanna kill (still in the ghetto)
Now bust it, sit back, I'm bout to rip it
Trust it, the styles like lusted
And wicked, loosely, who me I'm groovy
I saw Fritz the cat when it was in the fucking movies
Cause I go back like pitching pennies on a project step
One of five when the boulevard live
When a rebel pulled a card, steady yard
I ride around and rip the niggy get dope, it's just too hard
Why brothers kill one another like coppers get undercovers
When all we really got is one another
A brother could feed me but if it needs me
If I'm greedy, then what of myself do I discovered
Say what I know, see what I saw
Do what I did so kid, I'm sliding through the door
Ticket get wit the shorty wit his eye on the tech
Kick it with the chick with the wick on the check
Kick it to the crew that's not all safe sex
Even kick it wit the man wit a plate pig neck juice
Kid, I get loose like a ferret
Why front? I've been rocking suits since the Parrot
Le bourgeoisie negro, kid I'm crazy ghetto
Yeah, yo, tiptoe through your road wit amigos
Ready or not, here come the Sheep to relieve
Pull it off the kuff while we're wearing short sleeves
Get it, got it, good
Put it in your stereo and blast it in your hood
(Hook)
Now if it's checkers, chess, or soul survivor
I'm gonna catch wreck like I was a drunk driver
But how's your hand-o in the ghetto?
Only thing you got is what you had from the get (ready) go
Yo, you can't trust even if you're tight
Cause they hug with the left, stab you with the right
Love you Astoria and blan by Corona
I'm still the same, I still got game like Barcelona
Don't think I forgot where I've been when you see me in a crowd
Come in, no one's allowed, I hope I make you proud
And as for those that never liked me
You can go to hell and sight see
The past is an ash, gone like spent cash
Peace, boom bash, I won't dash
I'm rollin through your region with the Legion, reason
Thought it was a rabbit, kid, it's duck season
Don't think up I'm letting selling out, don't forget and
Don't think I won't represent man
Take a brother out and where he was is in him
Drop 'em then I'm wearing silk, corduroy, or denim
Make your mom's momma or make your kids do the jerk
Comments couldn't faze me if they came from Captain Kirk
On the ground I can do, in the sand I can do 'em
Throw a rhyme beat like my name were Warren Moon
Hold back, wild black, I never turn blue
I'm chilling with Candy Innocent, we're both bound to
Get ready for the new, yo, we'll show it
Call the record week and it'll be here before you know it
So on the real, don't sweat, where's my bed's at
No matter where it goes, I know where my heads at

H.A.A. (Here’s Another Asshole),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yo! This is a crazy shout out to that nigga MC Hammer
We all know he went out and got a new style
So we went out and got him a new asshole, you know what I'm saying?
Cause we making examples out of bitch niggas for '94
Word up, Black Sheep ain't hearing it no more

Now listen Hammer, I could slam ya with grammar you bama
Diss you on camera, but then again goddamn I'd be
Committing a crime and also wasting my time
Yo that shit would be worse than trying to battle rhyme a pantomime
You can't say shit but dance and look like a dick
Save it for your hair cause your rhymes ain't slick, bitch
Come on now clown, you ain't down
If we were having sex in a circle, you still couldn't fuck around
You got some shit on your chest, what are you, nuts?
Or could it be that you've been eating too many chicken butts?
You popcorn ass rapper, oh, exqueeze me
You admitted you couldn't rhyme when you dropped the MC
Off your name, I laughed at your fame the minute you came
And now you're like your racehorse, dead last, you're mad lame
But now I got you like Wanda, I rock your world
And have you pulling on my nuts like a fucking squirrel
Begging me please, Lawnge stop tandering
But it's too late, goddamn I can't stand you man
That's why I'm up in your ass like a parasite
For me to battle you, that's like you in the Tyson fight
No wins, you know you have no friends
Because the mic separates the boys from the mens, Hammer
Have arrangements made, man eject respect
I put your name down, fuck card, I pulled your deck
Like Wu-Tang said, you'd best protect your neck
Or get wrecked, and you can bet your endorsement check
So reneg nigga, you'd better repent
And yo you couldn't look hard if Karl Kani gave you cement
Instead of his clothes to rock in your videos
Nigga you couldn't beat your dick as far as beef goes
Hammer, you say you're coming from Oaktown and that's fine
So nigga take your ass back like your hairline
In any battle you don't want to get stuck with me
If I was your dick you still couldn't fuck with me, bitch

No Stanley, no Stanley
I don't give a fuck who you are or who your man be
Huh, I'll snatch your capital without a 357, dig
No class nigga, I'll kick your ass for two bit
What are you stupid, troopid, couldn't be you if this was Balley
Nigga, I'll park you quick and faster than your valet
Hurt me, Stanley? You'd better hope for better days
Chasing my balls like I was the fucking Oakland A's
Nigga quit like your staff or feel the wrath
Your punk ass couldn't bust a bubble in a bath
Huh, I get this right, now you's a racketeer?
But nigga you've been ??? you ain't a mackateer
Ha, ho, no flow, so nigga won't you quit
Shoot heroin on the toilet and still not drop dope shit
Huh, it's all deception, I got your number mister
You bought helicopters for the cops and tried to play my sister
Ass out, your style is about as fly as Piedmont
And yo stop claiming Oakland when you're stroking 'em from Friedmont
In the dictionary under ""sellout"" that's where you'll be
So roll with Audi for a fucking catastrophe
You teenie weenie wearing geanie to bikini
Couldn't see me if gazelles came in motherfucking 3-D
This is for the Hammer, you bama
I'll bust your ass in Alabama, Savanna, Montana, Havana
Goddamn, my often Lifestyles fuck you
I bust you keep the pistol cause no one would fucking miss you
You suck! I don't give a fuck who does or writes the track
Whoever cameos, it's Hammer, it's all wack",https://genius.com/Black-sheep-haa-heres-another-asshole-lyrics
Black With N.V. (No Vision),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Verse 1)
Now, I was told to never bite off more then I could chew
But then you better bite enough for if you don't, my boy, you're blue
Now I wonder, can others see the system that I see
Or do they see and say they blame it on society?
The days of smart enough come to over, just say thousands
And as I live and learn because there's always someone mouthing
Speaking on an issue, praise you or they diss you
Lawnge as strong, they fly by me like Scott tissue
My people, from nigga to negro to man or color
Killed my father and my brother so that you could rape my mother
Now you wonder, why is it through instinct you fear
Wouldn't dare me to stare, one for yourself, you're out of here
Not to worry, to harm your intention of my creed
But to stop your greed and give me what I need
Opportunity, for a life of me
And generations to come with in tranquility
Now harmony, is a total love of things
For those who are inclined or better yet like to sing
But piece of mind it is my right for the spark will ignite
'Till I can catch a cab at the town at midnight
'Till I can be myself and not be thought as worse
'Till I can buy a slice from Howard Beach to the Hearse
'Till I can get the pill without fear of eject
And occupations which I seek I can have if I select
Now if I so select and reach out to make touch
How can you say that I ask for too much?
(Chorus)
Don't speak to me if good times are granted 'till I be
Don't tell me of the countries or the hours that you seek
Don't tell me to keep trying, you know I won't agree
Double negative means positively black with N.V
(Verse 2)
As a player of the game, of the lifetime game I am playing
I bet you're nodding, shake your head to what I am saying
It's keep then but those of men color of skin could even begin to wonder
What is it to ponder to let another bother
Listen, stay open not dismissing
Lack of vision makes division product no ambition
Wishes which you wish upon which for more you wishes
If I wish not to record steady now then I wash dishes
Wish while I wash, the water hot gets colder
Black I'm saying that in fact the dish gets clean and I get older
Seemly so, the dishes will grow to dishes far beyond me
Lost my wish and broke a dish so now I'm wishy washy
Understand foundation, create my own creation
If dumb and pumping jump, then get no ovation
But only restriction, boom penes a lot of friction
I then wash a dish with out pay. Boom! N.W.A
Think I'm lying? Black I'm crying, so the tear would turn to crystal
Crystals forming on my dishes so I wash until dismissal
Wash until my prints are wrinkled then they let me go
I know not where I'm going so I know not where I go
My people give me money, but the money much too low
For me to meet the match of present day so I still need some dough
Conjure up a suit, I wish that it were cute
Borrow a token and a smoking I begin a wish less hope
Intervening, application leads me on onto frustration
And duration of my time is spent with lack of occupation
Time to go for what I know. I know not of what I wish
But of soap and a towel and some water and a dish
(Chorus)
(Verse 3)
But lay o.k. 'cause you can get the play
I pick your style, your smile shown bright about a mile away
But anyway, another day, in the land of shove
Just living in the life of who?
A black man on a green land with a blue skyline
Don't tell me I'm color blind
I'm seeing system is hard to believe in
Underneath the underside I'm underachieving
Bust my ass in school, to be a certified fool
Now intellect of curb is my only tool
But street game is so uncouth
I took the SAT's and that's the sad-ass truth
I'm not gliding but I'm striving hanging on by a thread and it's called surviving
Hang on, hang on, hang you'all
Walk the street and keep you head so tall
For time is short, no time is bought
You're only in the wrong if you get caught
So kick in doors, bang on walls, shout in halls
Get yours. Get yours

Not knowin' who I am it's DLB rippin deep
I wasn't in your realm but I'm in your sphere
You still don't know the click so just listen here
Trik Turner on the one's DBX on the two's
3's for them off beat crews like you's
Back middle to the front don't front
You want a good time were gonna give you what
You want, can I get a hey, can I get a what
Can I get a buck buck you know that's what I want
The styling is creative, Trik Turner is the natives
We can be violated or ever duplicated I got
Nuhs from catch wreck and cousins of the
Wize you know its no surprise that this shit
Flies hi, yes which way, what, when, how, Mr
Otto D. flip the track right now, I know you've
Heard the others wanna be dust covered but
Then again the choice is yours
Where's the trick at here's the trik
And even if you wanted to you can't sound as sick
Watch us swing like this why should we
Swing it like that because in fact what yours
Might hold us back - therefore, I ignore
I do as I feel as I trust in ""D"" He's got my
Back tonight you know what I'm sayin' yo'
Trik I ain't play'n it's easy to roll
With this than to roll with that
With no delay and see an actuality to one
It can not be, I made it look easy because
It is to me, anytime capacity was filled, tried
To rock it, anytime a honey gave us play, tried
To knock it, never was a fool so I finished
School never seen us sweat, and you never
Seen us schooled, out to rock the world
Right here from my block, don't punch girls
And we don't punch a clock, gotta go gotta
Go see you later by the cat and you can't
Beat that with a bat

You can get with this or you can get with that
You can get with this or you can get with that
You should get with this cause this is where its at-
Engine engine number nine on that world wide
Transit line if my train goes off the track
Pick it up pick it up pick it up
Back on the scene, crispy and clean
You can try but don't lie because you can't get with me
We be the outcast, can outlast, and outblast
Let this shit rip and feel the rush, crushed
Open your doors you best believe we're sliding thru
Quickly, niftily we can make it hip to be
Down with this mess with two MC's
Fuck what you heard we on some T.O.P
I'm still DLB
So now I turn triks cause I'm the true player
Hold your coat cause I got the container
Pass the plate across the fader
Trik Turner gets played like a Sony innovator

State Of Yo,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I'm in a state of yo
So if I go to the spliff that I passed
Mix it back with the slack from my man
With a tan sitting by the fan
In a heavy, heavy band
The beat, huh, feels warm, and cool
Won't fall
Just groove, soothe it, shmooth it
Ahhh, shit and I won't quit
Keep on, and on and on
Filling up the gap from eve to dawn
Gotta be the Sheep
Under your nose, above your head
Honey said '69', I thought of boots
And gave her pro-Keds
D for action, just like Jackson
Cause the jacksons are not imagined
I don't really wanna give a foot, you know
I'm in a state of yo, so what if I go..
Yo, days go by, we just get flyer
Swinging harder cause we got desire
Extra effort because we're tryers
Got more heat than a dollar in the dryer
Got more flavour than Fruity Pebbles
Check the format and clock the levels
Yo ­ do what you gotta do..
Cause I got more style than store that's dapper
Got more sweet than a candy wrapper
Got more, balls than a pimp who slaps
And got heart like a thug that maps
Make more sense than childhood freaks
Got more support than high-top kicks
So what's happens in the mix
I'm weak yet pure like a heroin fix
So, yo, don't you know that the flow
That I just move on, just like so
It's got me in a, state of ..
Yo, no aggre-ssion
Let your mind make connec-tion
Ain't no need for correc-tion
Yo, huh? Oh, on with the session
Heavies got some weight, you can't debate
Elate the fate, cause the style is great
For life is hectic and all that there
People, you care but, yo, beware
For one knows not what gets one shot
I think I used to know but I forgot
Cause it ain't nothing, nothing at all
I'm telling you it's a small..
Without the faith for things that work
To spite my life is to spite your birth
We share the earth, yo, but who was first, yo?
So, who's here now, yo? Well, where's my hearse, yo
But I gotta go, I gotta go
To where I don't, I don't, I don't know
I guess I'll just hang out in a state of yo",https://genius.com/Black-sheep-state-of-yo-lyrics
Bring Us Back,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Waiting for you on this monday morning
That is all I can do since your good bye kiss
I never wanted to disappoint you
But I should have known that it would end like this
Everything they have told me - I believed it
But what they said was a barefaced lie
How could I think this affair was true?
I thought you’ve destroyed our love
But so did I…
Bring us back, bring us back
Where we started yesterday
Let me hear, all the things
That you wouldn’t say today
I destroyed what we had
Now you’re pushing me away
Please forget what I’ve done
And skip back to yesterday
Just a stupid mistake
I regret it today
It’s no use to excuse
And you’re pushing me away
Waiting for you, will you give us a second chance?
It’s Monday night and I’m going mad
I want to call you and say that I’m sorry
I should have known I could trust
In what you said…
Bring us back...",https://genius.com/Black-sheep-bring-us-back-lyrics
I can fly,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Intro.                                                                                                               Oh I can fly x8                                                                                         Verse 1.                                                                                             Everybody knows I got what it takes , Insomnia paints. Instead of heavens clouds I hope papa awake.  These Politics fake. they wanna murder us while Every resource & option they take .                                                                                     Look forward into my tomorrow so look through me as the binoculars break.                                                                                          My conscious creates promising faith .                                      Absorbed in my past but I’m aware that god gives today .                                                                       So no more excuses take my old self away from the operating table .                                              Paralyzed from depression still I gotta embrace when these problems are painful .                                                                                Can you relate to these demons, escape when I breath in, Verbally ima Picasso that paints hope.                                                                             In mayhem there’s meaning greatness where dreams live . It’s not only the nasdaq stocks that will pay gold .                                                     music has always been a home with double the instillation that’s well padded .                                                                                     Through daydreams I fell fast in . Through this Hyrogliohic ink I spell sadness .                                                                                              Seduced by what my heart finds. Moonwalking on mars I’m . Observing how the  stars shine .                                                       Inspire through the dark times . Just an angel chained to the bottom of Hell writing lyrics in between his scar lines .                                                                     I see the Prison bars hide the pain that is yours but also is part mine                                                       Constantly comparing how we exist But I’m here to remind you that this is our life’s                                                                                               So live fearlessly Because  are comfort zones is where we die again .                                                              Taking sewing needles to the wings you cut off of yourself & learn how to fly again.                                                                                                 .Hook 1.
