Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Greatest Hits,1992.0,"Now this is a story all about how
My life got flipped turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said ""You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air""
I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put my Walkman on and said ""I might as well kick it""
First class, yo, this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm, this might be all right
But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that
Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?
I don't think so, I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the Prince of Bel-Air

Well, uh
The plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude, looked like a cop, standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought ""Nah, forget it, yo, Holmes, to Bel-Air!""

I pulled
Up to a house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabbie ""Yo', Holmes, smell ya later""
Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-and-the-fresh-prince-fresh-prince-of-bel-air-lyrics
Summertime,Homebase ,1991.0,"Drums Please!

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the bass and let the Alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back 'cause this is summertime

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
But back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to 
summer madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressin' less
And checkin' out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your Jeep or your Benzos
Or in your Nissan sittin' on Lorenzos
Back in Philly we be out in the park
A place called the Plateau is where everybody goes
Guys out huntin' and girls doin' likewise
Honkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beepin' at
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hip you and to get you equipped for the summertime

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more
Cause you're invited to a barbecue that's startin' at 4
Sittin' with your friends cause y'all reminisce
About the days growin' up and the first person you kiss
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playin' out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinnin' a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wipin' your car down
It's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout
It looks like a car show
Everybody come lookin' real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin' to the side but you can't speed through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new definition of summer madness

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-and-the-fresh-prince-summertime-lyrics
Parents Just Don’t Understand,"He’s the DJ, I’m the Rapper",1988.0,"You know parents are the same no matter time nor place
They don't understand that us kids are gonna make some mistakes
So to you other kids all across the land
There's no need to argue, parents just don't understand

I remember one year
My mom took me school shopping
It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister
All hopped in the car
We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall
My mom started bugging with the clothes she chose
I didn't say nothing at first
I just turned up my nose
She said, “What's wrong? This shirt cost $20”
I said, “Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!”
The next half hour was the same old thing
My mother buying me clothes from 1963
And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!
I said, “Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep”
She said, “You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet”
I said, “Mom, let's put these clothes back, please”
She said “No, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show”
I said, “This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer
Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers
But if you don't want to I can live with that but
You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks”
She wasn't moved - everything stayed the same
Inevitably the first day of school came
I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick
But my mom said, “No, no way, uh-uh, forget it”
There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax
I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts
And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought
The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought
And those who weren't laughing still had a ball
Because they were pointing and whispering
As I walked down the hall
I got home and told my Mom how my day went
She said, “If they were laughing you don't need them
'Cause they're not good friends”
For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom
That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times
So to you all the kids all across the land
There's no need to argue
Parents just don't understand

Oh-kay, here's the situation
My parents went away on a week's vacation and
They left the keys to the brand new Porsche
Would they mind?
Umm, well, of course not
I'll just take it for a little spin
And maybe show it off to a couple of friends
I'll just cruise it around the neighborhood
Well, maybe I shouldn't...
Yeah, of course, I should
Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot
I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block
That's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking
I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking
You should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions
I honked my horn just to get her attention
She said, “Was that for me?”
I said, “Yeah”
She said, “Why?”
I said, “Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy”
She said, “How do I know you're not sick?
You could be some deranged lunatic”
I said, “C'mon, toots, my name is the Prince
Besides, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?
”
She agreed and we were on our way
She was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word
We hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive
We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes
She kicked her shoes off onto the floor
She said, “Drive fast, speed turns me on”
She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas
We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast
The sunroof was open, the music was high
And this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh
She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far
I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car
We're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche
And to make this long story short - short
When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell
I said, “I don't have a license but I drive very well, officer”
I almost had a heart attack that day
Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway
I was arrested, the car was impounded
There was no way for me to avoid being grounded
My parents had to come off from vacation to get me
I'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me
My parents walked in
I got my grip, I said, “Ah, Mom, Dad... how was your trip?”
They didn't speak - I said, “I want to plead my case”
But my father just shoved me in the car by my face
That was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived
They took turns - one would beat me while the other was driving
I can't believe it, I just made a mistake
Well parents are the same no matter time nor place
So to you other kids all across the land
Take it from me, parents just don't understand",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-and-the-fresh-prince-parents-just-dont-understand-lyrics

A Nightmare on My Street,"He’s the DJ, I’m the Rapper",1988.0,"Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy you all know him, he had me scared as hell!
He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred!
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot outside he wears it anyway!
He's gone when I'm awake but he shows up when I'm sleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare; on my street!

It was a Saturday evening, if I remember it right
And we had just gotten back off tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and bum rush the movies
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life
That was all right though 'cause the lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theater set to ill
We saw Elm Street and man it was def
And everything seemed all right when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare, but on my street!

It was burning in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, man, I was buggin'
I checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted, it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
I went downstairs to grab some juice or a Coke
Flipped the TV off, and then I almost choked
When I heard this awful voice comin' from behind
It said, ""You turned off David Letterman, now you must die!""
Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was
Broke outside in my drawers and screamed, ""So long, cuz!""
Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screamin'
Then thought, ""Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin""
I strolled back home with a grin on my grill
I figured since this is a dream I might as well get ill
I walked in the house, the Big Bad Fresh Prince
But Freddy killed all that noise real quick
He grabbed me by my neck and said
""Here's what we'll do, we got a lot of work here, me and you
The souls of your friends you and I will claim
You've got the body, and I've got the brain""
I said, ""Yo Fred, I think you've got me all wrong
I ain't partners with nobody with nails that long!
Look, I'll be honest, man, this team won't work
The girls won't be on you, Fred your face is all burnt!""
I pat him on the shoulder said, ""Thanks for stopping by.""
Then I opened up the door and said, ""Take care guy!""
He got mad, drew back his arm, and slashed my shirt
I laughed at first, then thought, ""Hold up, that hurt!""
It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real
I said, ""Freddy, uh, pal, there's been an awful mistake here.""
No further words and then I darted upstairs
Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
Pulled the covers up over my head
And said, ""Oh please do somethin' with Fred!""
He jumped on my bed, ripped through the covers with his claws
Tried to get me, but my alarm went off
And then silence! It was a whole new day
I thought, ""Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway.""
Until I noticed those rips in my sheets
And that was proof that there had been a nightmare, on my street

Oh man, I gotta call Jeff, I gotta call Jeff
Come on, come on
Come on Jeff, answer
Come on, man
Hello?
Jeff, this is Prince, man
Jeff, wake up
Jeff, wake up
What do you want?
Jeff, wake up, man
Listen to me, Jeff
It's three o'clock in the mornin', what do you want?
Jeff, Jeff, would you listen to me?
Listen, whatever you do, don't fall asleep
Man!
Jeff, listen to me, don't go to sleep, Jeff
Look, look, I'll talk to you tomorrow, I'm going to bed
RRAHHHH!
Ahhhhhh!
Jeff! Jeff!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, haaaa!
Ahhhhhh!
Jeff!
RRAHHHH!
Jeff! Answer me, Jeff!
I'm your D.J. now, Princey!

Girls Ain’t Nothing But Trouble,Rock the House,1987,"Listen homeboys, don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

Just last week when I was walking down the street
I observed this lovely lady that I wanted to meet
I walked up to her I said hello
She said: ""Hey, you're kind of cute"" I said: ""Yes, I know, but...
By the way, sweetheart, what's your name?""
She said: ""My friends like to call me Exotic Elaine""
I said: ""My name is the Prince"" and she said: ""Why?""
I said: ""Well, I don't know, I'm just a hell of a guy!
But enough about me, yo, let's talk about you
And all the wonderful things that you and I can do""
I popped some trash and in a little bit of time
I showed some cash and the girl was mine
I took her over town, I wined her and dined her
She asked me 'did I like her?' I said: ""Well... kinda""
All of a sudden, she jumped out her seat
Snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street
She started grabbin all over me, kissin' and huggin'
So I shoved her away, I said: ""You better stop buggin'!""
She got mad, looked me dead in my face
Threw her hands in the air and yelled out: ""Rape!""
I got scared when she started to yell
So I handed her my wallet and ran like hell
I was duckin' through alleys right and left
But when the cops caught up, they almost beat me to death
I was arrested, charged with aggravated assault
(Hey, yo Clancy, we got him!) But it wasn't my fault!

Nevertheless, don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

I was in a bar one Friday night
Coolin', watchin' a Mike Tyson fight
I was maxin' and relaxin', sippin' on tequila
When this girl walked up, she said: ""Hi, my name is Sheila""
I responded by saying hello
She paid for my drink and then said: ""Let's go""
20 minutes later, things were starting to cook
As we pulled up into her house, I said: ""I'm with you, toots""
The music was soft and there was wine in the glasses
She started winking and making little passes
At me, she grabbed me close and that's when she got bold
She started feeling up my back, I said: ""Oh, your hands are cold!""
We went into her bedroom thinking of one thing
Took the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring
I carresed her body and I kissed her cheek
And that's when I observed those satin bed sheets
I felt that it was time for me to make my move
I thought I better hurry up before I busted the groove
I leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue
A door slammed and a voice said: ""Baby, where are you?""
Her boyfriend busted in, he grinned an evil grin
And said: ""Boy, I'mma tear your butt limb from limb!""
I was scared as hell, where was I supposed to go?
I just yelled: ""Geronimo!"" and jumped out the window
Just my luck we were in a snow storm
And all I had was my underwear on to keep my warm
And to top the night off, I had to break in my place
Because my keys were in my pants back on Sheila's book case
I was done, sneezin' and coughin'... (Aaa-choo!)
I hope this doesn't happen too often, but

Nevertheless, don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

 Yo man, you think they see your point?
 I don't know, I don't think they really get it, man...
 I think you should give 'em another example!
 Aight, give me a scratch, let's make it funky right here...

I got a ring on my phone, May 5th last year
It was my girlfriend Betty, I said: ""Hello dear!
I was just about to call you
I got a couple tickets to the Run-D.M.C. concert"" (I'm wit' it)
""It's six o'clock now, at eight will you be ready?"" (Yeah)
""Aight, fine, see you then, Betty""
I combed my hair, washed, and brushed my teeth
Got funky fresh dressed in my Le Coq Sportif
Got to Betty's at eight, I was ready to jet
Until Betty's mom said: ""Betty's not ready yet!""
I sat there for at least an hour
It was ten after nine before she got in the shower
9:35, she comes downstairs
And said: ""I need a little longer to finish my hair""
At ten o'clock, we had been missed the show
She comes downstairs and says 'let's go'!?
""Go where? Go to sleep, I'm gone!""
I was steamin' like a demon as I drove home

But it just goes to show not trying to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme
Just remember my rhymes
Take heed to my rhymes and get the hell away!

 
Man, first your parents just don't understand...
 I know, right, man...
 
Then you have these crazy nightmares...
 Look, why me? Why me?...
 What's next?
 Not these girls man, but... 
you know how it is... can't live wit' 'em...
 
...can't live without 'em",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-and-the-fresh-prince-girls-aint-nothing-but-trouble-lyrics
You Saw My Blinker,Homebase ,1991.0,"This is a story I'll never forget
About the day my new car got hit
It caught me off guard cause it happened so quick
When I heard the crash I got mad as hell
Cruising down the highway, fast, not slow
Ninety miles an hour in my 5.0
People waving at me cause they know who I am
Alpine stereo blasting a jam
Put the top down said my girlfriend
Then my damn hat blew off in the wind
I got kinda mad cause it's the hat I just bought
I shoulda put her out it was all her fault
Day was Friday date was ten
My girl was looking good on a strem
She smacked my hand when I put it on her rear
Said hit me again and I'll break your wrist
That day I dressed all in white
Takin' my girl to Palm Springs for the night
I was hoping I could find a short cut
I was tired plus I had a rash on my butt
There was this lady in a Pinto coupe
'bout 90 years old I could tell by the droop
Driving off fast borderline insane
Glass so thick couldn't stay in her lane
I swerved left then I swerved right
She was still tailgating me too damn tight
To the left lane I tried to switch
Then you saw my blinker bitch
We both pulled off on the side of the road
I was hot ready to explode
The only thing stopping me from breaking her nose
Is I was 21 and she was 90 years old
Then the police came turn the lights off
The lady started cryin' and the cop got soft
The cop said ah it'll be ok
Wrinkled old bag lookin' like a shar pei
I said wait what's going on cap'
Her car's fine my car is wrecked
Then I saw what happened in the crash
Her dentures came out her mouth and got stuck in the dash
You hit me I didn't hit you
Stop holding your neck lady you can't sue
It's your fault you caused all this
You saw my blinker bitch
Wednesday October the fourth
That's when we got our day in court
That lady destroyed my case
She came in a wheelchair and a neck brace
I jumped up I said you must be jokin'
Come on judge her neck ain't broken
Well I'll be damned
Wrinkled old bag started cryin' on the stand
The bailiff grabbed me slammed me on the ground
Judge said boy you'd better calm down
Aren't you one of them damn rap singers
Yeah then I gave him the finger
Judge held me in contempt of court
For givin' him the finger and things of that sort
Anything to say before you're dismissed
Just one you saw my blinker bitch",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-and-the-fresh-prince-you-saw-my-blinker-lyrics
Brand New Funk,"He’s the DJ, I’m the Rapper",1987.0,"It's new.  It's out of the ordinary
It's rather extrordinary, so yo bust this commentary
A literary genius and a superior beat creator
Have come together and we made a
Musical composition which we think is a remedy
To cure all the dance floors that's empty
You wanna dance? We got what you want
Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince bustin out with the brand new funk
It was kind of an accident, the way that it happened
One day I was rappin, and on the beat, Jeff was backin me up
And all of a sudden, he brought in a cut
And I dropped my microphone and said, ""What the...?
Hold up, Jeff, wait a minute, play it""
He just smiled and said, ""Yeah def ain't it?""
It was {funky} it made wanna {get, get down!}
And we knew almost at once it was the {brand new funk}
So we continued to listen to it
And we knew it was def when I started rappin to it
So I gave a hi-five to Jeff
And without hesitation popped in my cassette
I took it home that night, and analyzed it
Rewound the tape over and over, and memorized it
That Friday, we went to the club
And out and out cold tore it up!
You shoulda seen the people dancin and shakin and movin and jumpin
And spinnin and clappin, while the beatbox was groovin
And screamin and yellin while on the microphone I was flowin
Fresh rhymes I was showin, the people say, ""Yo keep goin""
So I continued to rock, while Jeff was on the beatbox
Special assistance from my homeboy Ready Rock
People fought just to get up front
To get a bird's eye view of what we call the brand new funk

But we have done it, so now we can breathe

OK it's clear?  It's good?  OK everybody's got it?
One.. two..
One, two, and..
My rhymes have been written, not to be bitten
But as it seems, some suckers keep forgettin
The rules about rappin, but that's alright
Cause in the next five minutes I'ma have them all uptight
Stronger than a dinosaur, better known than sin
I mean the battles I battle, I usually win em
In less than a minute, but it all depends
On how long -- it takes you rappers to realize
That tryin to defend yourself, is ridiculous
Didn't you get my message it's out of the question
Cause you're toys boys, I'm the Real McCoy
I'm really gonna enjoy seeing you destroyed
If I was Fred Flintstone, I'd probably own all of Bedrock
If I was a criminal I'd probably own a cell block
If I was in the Navy I would own the sea
But I'm a poet so I own the whole rap industry
I'm like a lion my man, and the streets are my den
It's either kill or be killed, so I kill
I kill again and again and again
Some ? the time, rappers I'll slaughter them
I tie em up and throw them in the water
Then I'll just walk away like nothin ever happened
Until somebody else starts rappin
That's when I snap and I'll attack and go mad like Rambo
Or maybe like Commando, or like Lando
Calrissian, cause you know he was down with the Force
Fresh Prince is the source I feel no pain or remorse
Think that you can beat me rappin man you must be silly
Man I really really really really really really
Hate when people, doubt my ability
And I have to prove superiority
If rap was basketball, I would be in luck
Cause every time I freestyled it would be a slam dunk
MAN, I'm the engineer, and you're the passangers
Takin on a voyage, a hip-hop massacre
The Jason of rap, Freddy Kruger of rhymin
And I'm sure that you'll see in due time man
People will run, to Philadelphia Pennsylvania
To all join in, to this Fresh Prince mania
My face in magazines, on your radio or stereo
Everywhere you go, audio and video
A hip-hop terrorist, war like vocalist
Other rappers say, ""Yo Prince why don't you show me this
Style now,"" you must be trippin
It ain't no way in hell I'ma let you put your lip in
My rhyme cause it's a timebomb, I'm not kiddin
My rhyme explodes the second it gets bitten
I'm quick and nimble, a status symbol
I shop at Macy's now but I used to shop at Gimble's
I'll, drop kick a hurricane, bodyslam a tidal wave
Walk through a tornado, or a volcano
But I'll be okay though
And here's some more info that you rappers should know
You are the bombs and I will defuse you
I am the lawyer and I'm goin to accuse you
Of the ultimate rhyme crime, and you will be guilty
There's no way that you'll ever ever defeat beat me
Rappin any time of day
Pop so much trash, man I can't wait
To be face to face, and hear Jeff say, ""Sick 'em""
Man you're gonna be my victim
You better duck, and pray for good luck Chuck, cause you're stuck
You're like a Thanksgiving turkey and it's time to be plucked
I see you're nervous purpose that's how I now you're soft
You're runnin round like a chicken with your head cut off
But just relax my power to the max
And I'm cuttin no slack on this rap track, Jack
So back up, as if you got good sense
OR FEEL THE FURY.. of the Prince!
And ya don't stop
Yo Jazzy, why don't you rock up the spots
Yo Jazzy, hey Jeff I'm psyched, I'm psyched
Give em a cut Jeff
{Jeff scratches}
Ooooooh-weeeeeee!  Check out my disc-jockey!
Ay Jeffrey Jeffrey Jeffrey, a fast one

I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson,And in This Corner...,1989.0,"[Intro: Prince and 
Jeff
 imitate two old black men]
Hey...hey Leroy...Leroy
Yeah
Did you hear about that boy Mike Tyson?
Mike...Mike Tyson he's the boy
That played football from Montreal ain't he?
No no you old coot, he a...he a boxer man
Yeah
Let me tell ya I went to his fight a couple months ago
I seen him hit this boy, and he hit the boy so hard
His head flew off into the eigtheenth row
(laughing) They had to get his head out of the eighteenth row
[Verse One: Prince & 
Jeff
]
I was in Jeff's crib one night about eight
And we were watchin' a couple of Mike Tyson fight tapes
Jeff was like...
Man, you see how hard Mike's punchin'?
Come on Jeff the other guy was just lungin'
Left, right, left, right, another K.O
If that was me I'd a been okay though
The very next day I gave Russell a ring
With J.L. and Lyor we all called Don King
I said ""Yeah, Don I got a problem
Tell 'em Prince
Yeah what's up? what you sayin? You tryin' to solve 'em?
Forget the small talk, let's get to the nitty gritty'
Me and Mike, two months, Trump, Atlantic City.""
Yo, you got this you gonna bust dude up
Yeah, you can be my trainer
Word up?
I'm rough like a freight train smooth like ice
And yo Jeff, straight up, I think I can beat Mike Tyson

Man, you can beat him, you can beat him
Yo man, word up
You know I put on a couple pounds man we can do this, man
You can do it

Extra, extra read all about it. Get this...
Fresh Prince challenges 'Iron Mike' Tyson to a fight
 He's crazy

Ain't that the boy who knocked the guy's head in the fifteenth row?
Hey Leroy, you read the paper?
That boy done lost his mind
[Verse Two: Fresh Prince & 
Lawrence the Barber
]
There was press conference to see what trainin' I was doing
Before then I had never heard reporters booing
Cameras flashing, I was in the middle
I didn't wanna look dumb so I exaggerated a little
I said, ""Uh, I been trainin' twenty hours a day
Liftin' big old cars and big bales of hay
(That's what you're doing)
And I jog 10,000 miles every morning
Thinkin' about Mike and my moment of glory
(Tell 'em more)
I drink water, 20 gallons a pop
And I can throw a Volkswagen a whole half block
(He can do it too)
And 4 million sit ups... in a minute...
I ain't lyin' I did it!""
The general public thought I was a fool
I was gettin' dissed but I guess that was cool
Well gettin' dissed is never good
But I was even gettin' dissed in my old neighborhood
I was at the corner at the top of my block
There was a couple of people standing outside of the barber shop
It was Lawrence, my barber and friend
And he yelled out:
Hey, Prince, you can win!
I said 'really?' and I stopped to chat
You could beat him man, if you hit him with a bat
Ha ha...you gon' get wrecked
But can I have your shoes when he break your neck?
Everybody was laughin' out loud
I thought at least my own Grandma would be proud
I went to her house and snuck in to surprise her
I heard her on the phone
""A thousand bucks on Tyson!""

Hey, Leroy, i thought that boy was joking,  he really gon' get in the ring!
Man, i don't think that boy can beat that big football player
Man, i keep tellin', ya, he ain't no football player, he a boxer
Hey, Leroy, we gotta do something, that boy gon' kill himself!
[Verse Three: Prince, 
Ring Announcer
]
It's fight day and man am I hyped
Woah, I can't wait to see Mike
Boy I'm hyped, ready to do my thing
Trump Castle Casino 
In this corner, weighing a mere 165 pounds
The Lightin' Rodent, the Fresh Prince! (crowd boos)
And in this corner
The heavyweight champion of the world
'Iron Mike' Tyson!
 (crowd cheers)
I came out hustling, slidin' and grabbing
Slippin' and dippin' hustlin' and jabbin'
For a second I looked good out there (yep)
But then Mike brought to reality (look out) my worst nightmare
One punch, that's all it took (oooh)
He hit me in my ribs and my insides shook
Now how can I say this and be a little discreet?
Let's just say that my bowels released
I called timeout and went back to my corner
Said to my coach, ""Ain't no way I'm goin'
The hell back out there, man you can forget it
My body's like a punching bag and Mike is gonna (Hit it)""
They tried to make me go meet my doom
But I sucker punched my coach and hauled to my dressin' room
The next day the headline in the town
""Fresh Prince breaks camp, Tyson wins, first round""
Some fool asked why I ran away
I said, ""A good run is better than a bad stand any day""
My career is over as far as fightin'
But I don't know what made me think I can beat Mike Tyson
[Outro: Prince and 
Jeff
 as old men]
Hey Leroy!
Yeah
Did you see the fight? did you see the fight?
The..the..the football player?
No the boxer, come on man
I was at the fight last night
I paid four hundred and seventy fo' thousand dollars
For my ticket right...
Ah, you weren't at no fight
I seen you around here last night
..and the boy..the boy ran out the ring
You always lying
I ain't lying...
You lie to your grandkids..
..I seen it...
...you been lyin' ever since you was a little kid
...Mike Tyson punched the boy in his ribs, and his leg fell off
His leg fell off and it fell over...
...you always lying
...and it knocked the HBO camerman's camera fell out his hand
I said, god damn, I couldn't believe it Leroy
You shoulda been there...you definetly shoulda been there
...I was right next to you playin' checkers",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-and-the-fresh-prince-i-think-i-can-beat-mike-tyson-lyrics
Girls Ain’t Nothing But Trouble (Original 1986 version),UnKnown,1986.0,"Uhh, man! Uh, my eye, my eye... (What's up? What's up man?)
Man, this guy just walked to me and punched me in my eye, man
So I'm, I was just trying to talk to his girl
I don't even know her, man! (Aw, man, that's dead)
Yep! Man, Jeff, get me some ice, man, I can't believe this, man!

Listen homeboys don't mean to burst your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

Just last week when I was walking down the street
I observed this lovely lady that I wanted to meet
I walked up to her I said hello
She said: ""Hey! You're kind of cute"" I said: ""Yes, I know, but...
By the way, sweetheart, what's your name?""
She said: ""My friends like to call me exotic Elaine""
I said: ""My name is the Prince"" and she said: ""Why?""
I said: ""Well... I don't know, I'm just a hell of a guy!
But enough about me, let's talk about you
And all the wonderful things that you and I can do""
I popped some trash and in a little bit of time
I showed some cash and the girl was mine
I took her over town, I wined her and dined her
She ask me 'was I horny?' I said: ""Well... kinda""
All of a sudden she jumped out her seat
Snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street
She started grabbin all over me kissing and hugging
So I punched her in her chin, I said: ""You better stop buggin'!""
She got mad looked me dead in my face
Threw her hands in the air and yelled out: ""Rape!""
I got scared when she started to yell
So I hit her with a trash can and ran like hell
I was duckin through alleys right and left
But when the cops caught up they almost beat me to death
Now I'm in prison, charged with aggravated assault
But I didn't do nothing, it was that dumb broad's fault!

Nevertheless don't mean to burst your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhymes and get the hell away

I was in a bar one Friday night
Chilling out watching the Sugar Ray fight
I was kinda laying back, sipping on tequila
When this girl walked up she said: ""Hi, my name is Sheila""
I responded by saying hello
She paid for my drink and then said: ""Let's go""
She bought my drink, I thought that that was polite
So I walked out with her, I said ""What's up for tonight?""
She said ""Just get in the car"" so I obliged
About 20 minutes later we pulled up in her garage
She parked the car, gave me some sexy looks
She started walkin' in the house, I said ""I'm with you toots!""
Soft music and wine in the glasses
And then she started to make little passes at me
She said ""Sweetheart, today's your lucky day
Cause when I'm finished with you you're gonna yell 'Oh lay!'""
She stood up so I stood up with her
She puckered up so I started to kiss her
She grabbed me close then she got bold
She started feelin' up my back I said ""Ooh your hands are cold!""
We went into her bedroom thinkin' of one thing
Took the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring
Pulled down the shades then we dimmed the lights
Then we took a tasty sip of Riunite, on ice
I chewed a stick of doublemint to freshen my breath
I gave her half of that stick, it was the last one left
I caressed her bod, then I kissed her cheek
That's when I observed those Gucci bed sheets
I felt that it was time for me to make my move
I thought I'd better hurry up before I busted the groove
I was kind of uptight and I knew she could soothe me
I tapped her on the shoulder and said ""Ah-ehm, excuse me""
She touched my lips and asked me not to speak
Got undressed and pulled back those Gucci bed sheets
Sat down on the bed, laid back her pretty head
Kicked her feet up on the pillows and that's when she said that
She wanted me to be her one and only
She said ""Lay down, baby doll, I'm getting lonely""
All of a sudden, out of the blue
A door slammed and a voice said ""Baby, where are you!?""
Distinctfully I panicked, my heart full of fear
She said ""That's my boyfriend, babe, you better get out of here!""
Her boyfriend busted in, he grinned and evil grin
He said: ""Boy, I'mma tear your butt limb from limb!""
I was scared as hell, where was I supposed to go?
I just yelled: ""Geronimo!"" and jumped out the window
Just my luck we were in a snow storm
I didn't even have my underwear on to keep my warm
And to top the night off I had to break in my place
Because my keys were in my pants back on Sheila's book case
I was done, sneezing and coughing...
I hope this doesn't happen too often, but

Nevertheless don't mean to burst your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme
Just remember my rhyme
Take heed to my rhyme and get the hell away

Man, girls ain't nothing but trouble, man... (Yeah, I hear that, I dig it)
Yeah, well... can't live wit 'em...
 ...can't live without 'em
(Better take care of that eye)
Yeah man. Alright, y'all stay cool, man
(Alright, chill Prince)

Charlie Mack (The First Out the Limo),"He’s the DJ, I’m the Rapper",1988.0,"Everywhere we go, downtown or to a show
We have two necessities, Charlie Mack and our limo
He's feared by suckers yet he's loved by kids
Pay attention and let me tell you who Charlie Mack is
He is our homeboy from around the block
He's regarded through the city as the hip-hop cop
Height about 6'6"", weight about 290
Everywhere I go, Charlie Mack is right behind me
He never laughs, never smiles nor sweats
He doesn't breaks arms or legs, only spines or necks
He once KILLED a man cause he would not let go of his Eggo
Apollo Creed is a SUCKER, Charlie Mack could beat Drago
He could bench about three-hundred pounds
The cops all take a vacation when Charlie's in town
He's the toughest around, so everywhere that I go he goes
He's Charlie Mack and he's the first out the limo

I guess you're wonderin why he's the first out
The limo, yo, let me give you this bit of info
So you'll know the things that Charlie can do
And you'll know every single reason why he's down with the crew
The limo picks up about a half past six
With the radio blastin our latest hit
It's me, Jeff, Ready Rock, Omar and J.L
Charlie Mack is up front as we depart the hotel
First we cause chaos throughout the city streets
Then maybe stop at Burger King for a bite to eat
And if somebody gets stupid while we're in the place
Charlie cancels his order and bites off their face
He's not a troublemaker, in fact, he's a troublebreaker
And if somebody gets dumb, well it'll only take a
Second or two, after some fools snaps
Law and order is restored by my hero Charlie Mack
Wheel off into the limo, and head for the jam
Charlie cracks all the knuckles on both of his hands
And when we pull up to the show, the routine is unrehearsed
It's just natural that we let Charlie hop out first
He clears the crowd without sayin a word
Man, that's the loudest silence I've ever heard
A lot of times guys test him by tryin to bug
He just leaves ring imprints all over their mugs
He's a terminator, a Hercules of sorts
Man to hell with chess, he likes physical sports
You may not have known before but now you know
The reason why Charlie Mack is the first out the limo

We'd like to apologize to all of our fans
But please don't touch us when we're at our jams
Cause Charlie don't like folks around us when we're doin a show
And if he punches you, uh-oh, better get Maaco!
Still you weak rap dudes tempers are hot
Just because I've got somethin that YOU AIN'T GOT
If you want to get physical, rowdy or try to bomb me
I won't get excited, I'll just say, ""Yo Charlie!""
You shoulda been kind, you shouldn't have snapped
Charlie only hit you once and now you're takin a nap
And when he leaves you decaptitated, crushed in the dust
You'll look up and see your girl in the limo with us
You may think that that's enough homeboy but I think not
Charlie kick his face again I think you missed a spot
I roll down the limo window and yell, ""Bon voyage""
You'll see your girl buck naked givin Charlie a message
I'm serious. I'm not jokin. No doubt
You know how many doubters bones have been broken?
You may not have known before but now you know
The reason why Charlie Mack is the first out the limo

Charlie Mack.. the first out the limo
He's Charlie Mack.. the first out the limo
In closing, we'd like to say this to you bustaz
If you're skeptical you'll probably get beat up, plus get
Embarassed and laughed at by all of your friends
And if you cross Charlie Mack it's the beginning of the end
Of life as you know it. You might not die, sir
But if you're not dead, you'll wish you were
But if you still wanna bug out, homeboy let's go
You can bug with Charlie Mack cause he's the first out the limo
He's Charlie Mack
And he's the first out the limo",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-and-the-fresh-prince-charlie-mack-the-first-out-the-limo-lyrics
Nightmare on My Street (Single Version),"He’s the DJ, I’m the Rapper",1988.0,"* has extra lyrics not on ""He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper""

Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy you all know him, he had me scared as hell!
He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred!
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot, outside he wears it anyway!
He's gone when I'm awake but he shows up when I'm asleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare - on my street!

It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right
And we had just gotten back off tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and dumb rush the movies
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life
That was all right though 'cause the lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theater set to ill
Buggin! Cold havin' a ball
And somethin' 'bout Elm Street was the movie we saw
The way it started was decent, ya know, nothing real fancy
Bout this guy named Fred and this girl named Nancy
But word, when it was over, I said, ""Yo! That was def!""
And everything seemed all right when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare - on my street!

It was burning in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, and man, I was buggin'
I checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted, it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
I wanted something cool, to quench my thirst
I thought to myself, ""Yo, this heat is the worst!""
But when I got downstairs, I noticed something was wrong
I was home all alone but the TV was on!
I thought nothin' of it as I grabbed the remote
I pushed the power button, and then I almost choked
When I heard this awful voice comin' from behind
It said, ""You turned off David Letterman and now you must die!""
Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was
Broke outside in my drawers and screamed, ""So long, cuz!""
Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screamin'
Then thought, ""Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin""
I strolled back home with a grin on my grill
I figured since this is a dream I might as well get ill
I walked in the house, the Big Bad Fresh Prince
But Freddy killed all that noise real quick
He grabbed me by my neck and said, ""Here's what we'll do
We got a lotta work here, me and you
The souls of your friends you and I will claim
You've got the body, and I've got the brain.""
I said, ""Yo Fred, I think you've got me all wrong
I ain't partners with NOBODY with nails that long!
Look, I'll be honest man, this team won't work
The girls won't be on you, Fred your face is all burnt!""
Fred got mad and his head started steamin'
But I thought, what the hell, I'm only dreamin'
I said, ""Please leave Fred, so I can get some sleep;
Or gimme a call, and maybe we'll hang out next week.""
I patted him on the shoulder said, ""Thanks for stopping by.""
Then I opened up the door and said, ""Take care guy!""
He got mad, drew back his arm, and slashed my shirt
I laughed at first, then thought, ""Hold up, that hurt!""
It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real
I said, ""Freddy, uh, pal, there's been an awful mistake here.""
No further words and then I darted upstairs
Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
Pulled the covers up over my head
And said, ""Oh please do somethin' with Fred!""
He jumped on my bed, ripped through the covers with his claws
Tried to get me, but my alarm went off
And then silence! It was a whole new day
I thought, ""Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway.""
Until I noticed those rips in my sheets
And that was proof that there had been a nightmare on my street

Just One of Those Days,Rock the House,1987.0,"Have you ever in your life experienced a day
Where nothing at all seems to go your way
No matter how hard you try to get out of the rut
You just could not break the string of bad luck
A day where Murphy's law takes over your life
And you just can't seem to do a darn thing right
And when the day was over you just had to say
You said man it's just one of those days

My day started off kind of cool
I brushed my teeth I combed my hair and I got dressed and went to school
I stopped at the store for a breakfast snack
A tasty cake and orange juice and a bubble yum pack
About that point I proceeded to class
I spoke to all the pretty girls that I passed
I went to my room which was on the first floor
I had no idea what I was in for
I sat in my desk and minded my own business
Someone knocked on the door the teacher said who is it
This girl walked in my imagination ran wild
She stole my heart just by the way that she smiled
I couldn't resist so I grabbed her butt
She said what's wrong with you fool are you some kind of nut
The teacher turned around while my arm was extended
She looked me in the face and said Prince you're suspended
I said your tripping it's just a bad habit
She put it in my face she must've wanted me to grab it
I pleaded my case but she wrote the pink slip
Then I just shoke my head I said I don't beleive this
She sent me to the head of the discipline staff
I tried to play it off so I started to laugh
I said ha ha this story is great
It's a big misunderstanding one big mistake
He didn't think that it was funny he didn't even smile
He said mmm mmm mmm you're an unlucky child
I stopped laughing and I said why is that
He said just get out my school and don't you ever come back
I said wait this is my school and you're telling me to leave it
He handed me my books and said yep you'd best believe it
As I walked out the school back at the wall I did gaze
And said man it's just one of those days

I woke up around a quarter to eight
I wiped the sleep from out my eyes and I was feeling great
I flipped my radio on and to my utter surprise
I thought that it was eight o'clock but it was half past nine
I hopped up and put my feet on the floor
Ran to the bathroom then I (ow) hit my foot on the door
The pain was immense as it started to throb
I said to hell with broken toes I was losing my job
So I combed my hair then I brushed my teeth
Threw on my Fila suit and my Fila sneaks
Threw on my Fila underwear and my
Fila hat
Then I ran downstairs and kicked the fila cat
I grabbed my jacket then I grabbed my keys
Then I prayed out loud car start please
The car started but what good was that
I couldn't drive it anyway because the tires were flat
I did the hundred yard dash to the top of my block
Then I grabbed a dollar bill from my left sweat sock
The bus pulled up I was late and kind of nervous
I got real mad because the sign said out of service
I started hiking it I wasn't liking it
I saw a little kid I stole his bike and started biking it
I thought I got away but when I ducked around the corner
There was twelve cop cars I said I'm a goner
Slamed on the flat I did 180 turn
Peddled the bike so fast I heard the rubble burn
With the cops in hot pursuit I started feeling like a jerk
I thought man all of this cause I was trying to get to work
I could've got away I almost had 'em shook
Til this girl walked by something said not to look
But I thought what the heck a little peek can't hurt
But she made me miss the sign that said men at work
I screamed out loud as I crashed through the baracade
I saw my whole life flash before my face
I felt kind of dizzy all I saw was stars
I put my hands over my eyes and settled on the handle bars
That was stupid I got off track
Cause about that point everything went black
The next thing I remember is a head ache nagging
I woke up face down in the back of a paddy wagon
I pinched myself to make sure I wasn't dead
A big Flinstone lump on the side of my head
They took my picture and my finger prints
I said wait you can't arrest me I'm the Fresh Prince
I demand that you release me you incompetent fool
You can't arrest me I'm the Prince you know the rules
You got five seconds 'fore I punch out your lights
But then the cop pulled out his gun I said ha ha psyche
I had a call so I called my boss
I figured I might as well what else could be lost
Boss I'm sorry that I couldn't make it today
He said what are you talking about you're off today is Saturday
Stuck in a cell scared as hell
I'm a hungry kind of tired and I hate this awful smell
Maybe one day I'll get smart and change my ways
But for now it's just one of those days

It's just one of those days",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-and-the-fresh-prince-just-one-of-those-days-lyrics
I’m All That,Homebase ,1991.0,"Spill the beans on the table I always say...
Huuuuuuuh...
Yeah buddy
Extra! Extra! Read All About It!
 Fresh Prince is back
You wonder how'd it happen; I wasn't rappin' for a long time
But now I'm back with a strong rhyme
Look here, the camera, snap my picture
I'll sign my name on it, then I get wit' ya
Like LL said; ""don't call it a comeback""
And face the fact, Jack - I'm all that
(I know ya gonna dig this)
Here I am in the flesh (Who is) I'm the funky, funky, funky fresh
Rhyme authority, rhythm connoisseur
Hip-hop liaison, rap Ambassador
Duke of daring, the king of the cut
The prince of poetry and all that stuff
Sexy, sexy, making the honeies yell
Girlies passing out? Ah, well
Back from the dead, like Jason
People thought I was over, they were erasin'
Me and Jeff's names out of the hit list
But ah, ah, ah, not so quick
Coming back at ya, can't no bad catcher
Catch this fastball I'm throwing at y'all
Wake up and smell the coffee, I'm back now
Thanks for keeping my throne warm for me, pal
The man with the cape, the crown and the scepter
Out for a while, but wisely kept a
Pen and pad by, so when I had my
Opportunity to rap, man I
Set my goals and then I shot for
What I do best: funny, to hell with hardcore
Voice on radio, 
face on TV
Spanking new funky rhymes on a CD
Out to attack the wack, full contact
It's gonna be a long night go get a knapsack
I got a gat to make ya face the fact
That I'm the best rapper on wax - I'm all that
(All that, you know what I'm saying)
(Get wicked)
Get up, get down, get funky, get loose
I'm the best show and I got proof
In the past there were those that could doubt it
But now I'm back and there's no doubt about it
The writing is on the wall (Come on)
Gimme ya mic and a stage and I'm a live it-ive it up y'all
Cause I can flow
Is there another rapper in the world like me? Hell no!
No one's like me, others try to bite me
There thebere thebere there might be
Someone like me somewhere
They're just not here; where the hell they at? Who cares?
Cause y'all got the ace in the hole
The super lover brother, numero uno, the rapper with soul
Coming out a little on the new tip
For those of y'all that thought I couldn't do this
Yo, well consider it done
It's the same got the parents
Just don't understand
 the same one
People said that I couldn't rap
Ha ha ha, you can stop that
Cause I'm a rapper and a half
And in the past I chose to make people laugh
And I was criticized for that
Some called me soft, some called me wack
I gotta admit it y'all I felt bad (Who'd ya call)
So as usual I called my Dad
He's sort of a fifty-one year old Casanova
He said son, ""Yo, come on over.""
He sat me down and he told me this
Son when your all that, you're gonna get dissed
He put his arm around me and he said ""Son
I was all that when I was young""
So from that point on I set my sights on
Making a record that people thought was the hype joint
Philly, born and raised, I've been gone for days
I can't wait to get back with my new track
Rhyme like lava, voice like a volcano
My rhyme through your radio works like Drano
A Porsche 911 and I don't stall, Jack (Yo, we all that)",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-and-the-fresh-prince-im-all-that-lyrics
Let’s Get Busy Baby,"He’s the DJ, I’m the Rapper",1988.0,"Mmm! Say baby, you got some fries to go with that shake?
Ay what are you man? Yo man, that is NO way to talk to a woman man
Man! I =BEEN= talkin to girls, man what are you talkin about?
That girl looks =GOOD=
Man look, you just, you buggin man, you know what you said?
Okay, okay, alright, =YOU= show me how to talk to a lady

Aight, bet, uhh sweetheart?
Listen up toots I like your looks
I used to see girls like you in them girlie books
I'm losin my mind, but it's not lost yet
I'd pay a thousand dollars just to see your silhouette
Red is a rose's color, blue is a violet's
Here's my number baby, when you get home, dial it up
I'll be your man and you can be my lady
And YOU can come to my house and we can get busy baby
Girl.. for..get about your boyfriend, he's nothin but a hassle
You can come with me and cold chill in my castle
Oh what a wonderful time it would be, imagine --
-- you and me, in my jacuzzi
Or horseback ridin or we can play tennis
But, the most intimate part will be when it's
Time to eat dinner, we'll go get dressed
And then we'll give a call to Antonie, my private chef
First we'll eat crablegs, by candlelight
Then sip wine by the fire for the rest of the night
And if the time is right, I'll ask you to be my lady
And we can dip right upstairs and get busy baby
You know since I first met you
I wanted to let you know how I felt, so I could get you
To treat me like a phone and take me off hold
And make your ear a cup so I can pour my heart and soul
I can't help but dream about the ultimate life
Two kids, a dog, a goldfish - and you as my wife
We'd have a rosebush, with a white picket fence
And all the neighborhood kids would call me Mr. Prince
And on the lazy Saturday afternoons
Right after me and the kids get finished watching cartoons
We could send them both outside to go play
And we could spend some time upstairs, get what I'm sayin?
The only problem, that we would have
Is whether or not to drive the Porsche, the Benz, or the Jag
And every night before bed, flip the radio on
And sip Dom Perignon to the quiet storm
Gucci, Louis Vuitton, you want more?
Gloria Vanderbilt or Liz Claiborne
Or Christian Dior from head to foot
The world is yours if you'll be my toots
Ohhh I know what your problem is
Look those other chicks are just good friends
I'll give up my harem if you'll be my lady
C'mon whaddya say, huh? Let's get busy baby
Look, be honest, c'mon, don't lie
Tell the truth - I'm a hell of a guy, right?
Pretty smile, light brown eyes
I've got miles on them other guys, face it
You could search America, Russia or Germany
But never will you find another man equivalent to me
But let's discuss it, perhaps over lunch
About how I'll be your poopsie, and you will be my hunybunch
""Now isn't that special?"" Why ain't you widdit?
You'll be my only girl, yeah, that's the ticket
Life's a risky business, babe you know the deal
Sometimes you just gotta say what the hell
Now is that time, roll for the money
Life is a gamble but I'm a sure thing honey
Girl, you know you're drivin me crazy
So how bout it, come on, let's get busy baby",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-and-the-fresh-prince-lets-get-busy-baby-lyrics
The Magnificent Jazzy Jeff,Rock the House,1987.0,"Some deejays are (good) some deejays are (fresh)
Some deejays are even (def)
But here's a little somethin 'bout my deejay
(The magnificient) Jazzy Jeff
So bust this beat
(Disc) (jock)
Yo Jazzy

Well, it's true that I'm the reigning king of the throne
But with all my strength, I couldn't do it alone
I need a deejay like (Jazzy) to back me up
So when I'm rockin on the mic he's on the crossfade cut
Scratchin and mixin, mixin and scratchin
Second after second it's the record
He's catchin
His hands are so fast that it's a medical riddle
With the turntable split and the mixer in the middle
Back and forth his hands fly
With the speed of a cheetah that'll puzzle your
Eye
Record after record, he has no mercy
Cuts left, cuts right, then he cuts vice versa
I'm not exaggerating, I said it and I meant it
I resent it if you say that his cuts are precedented
He's a lean, mea,n wreckin machine
He gets respected like a king when he's on the scene
So bust a move, cause you know he's def
He's my deejay (the magnificient) Jazzy Jeff

People often ask me everytime I emcee
Why do I brag so much about my disc jockey?
Well, the reason that I brag and I boast the most
Is cause my deejay is the most from coast to coast
(The magnificient) Jazzy Jeff, wack destroyer
Cuttin up records like a samurai warrior
If you deejays don't know who I'm talkin to
(I'm talkin to you) so (come on)
Cause in a battle you cannot win
Cause my deejay will (tear yo butt limb from limb!)
He's like a runaway tank, a hip-hop rebel
And if you wanna battle, you best bring a shovel
My man, so you can dig your grave
Cause there's no way that you could ever be saved
Because (the deejay cuts the record) to create the sound
(The deejay cuts the record) he's the best around
(The deejay cuts the record) you know he's down
His name is Jazzy Jeff a/k/a Jeff Townes
Commandin the cut he's always on track
He's DJ Jazzy Jeff and he's a cut maniac
So for your personal safety you should be told
That my DJ Jazzy Jeff is (out of control)
(Oh my God)
(Out of control)
(My goodness)
Alright Jazzy
We gon' do somethin a little different right now
This is what I want you to do for me
I want you to tell all these people your name
Jazzy, tell em your name
(He's Jazzy)
(His name is Jeff)
Yo Jazzy, I want you to tell all these people
How many of those deejays out there can get with you
(None)
(None of them)
How many?
(None of them)
Tell the truth
(None)
(None of them)
(None of them)
Now make the record burp
( *Jazzy Jeff produces burping sounds with the record* )
Say excuse me
( *Jazzy Jeff makes the scratch sound like an 'excuse me'* )
Now make it sound like a bird
( *Jazzy Jeff makes the record sound like a bird singing* )
Now make it chirp
( *the sound changes from singing to chirping *)

Now here's a story that should not be forgot
About the day my deejay turned into an autobot
He got struck by lightning in an electrical storm
He got on the wheels of steel and began to transform
( *Jazzy Jeff transforms* )
His name is Jeff, and he's as swift as a swiff
The type of guy that other deejays don't want to have to reckon with
He's by my side as I rock the mic
All of his vigorous cuts are sure to excite you
They'll delight you, you know that that's right, if you
Were a stick of dynamite, his cuts would ignite you
The deejay on the weels can't be matched
So (check out Jazzy Jeff with a cold cut scratch)
(Good)
(Jazzy)
(The magnificient)
(Jazzy Jeff)

Rock the House,Rock the House,1987.0,"Ladies and gentlemen
Fly girls and fly guys
My name is the Fresh Prince
And I've come here to introduce someone to you
His name is the Human LinnDrum Ready Rock C
And we came to tell everyone that...
( *Ready Rock C starts beatboxing* )
When we rock the house there is no doubt (is no doubt)
That me and Ready C will turn it out (turn it out)
We're down with the DJ Jazzy Jeff (Jazzy Jeff)
And you know that we are def (that we're def)
And you should not settle for less
Than the undisputed best

That's right, we are the best

Everywhere we (go), everytime we do a (show)
Everybody wants to (know) how we make em say (ho)
The way we do is not a magical trick
It's a lotta def rhymes (and beats like this)
( *Ready Rock C breaks into a new beat* )

Somebody yell 'hooo-o'

Hooo-o

Say 'ho, ho'

Ho, ho

Now I'm the Fresh Prince, hello, how do you do?
I just have a little fun with the rest of my crew
So take a chill and just relax
Yo Ready C, pretend that you're a dj and scratch
( *Ready Rock C imitates scratching* )

Go Ready Rock, go Ready Rock...

Alright now, bust a move
And get the hell out if you're tryin to bust the groove
Cause we came to (party) all through the night
And we're excommunicating those who don't act (right)
This is a (party), so grab some(body)
Drink some Ba(cardi) and dance (with everybody)
The feeling's good, some people think it's great
Get on the dancefloor and let your body girate
In cadence with the beat, just move your feet
While the Prince is on the rhyme (Ready C is on the beat)

My.. beatbox rocks everywhere we go
Gettin utterly respected at every show
No other can (beat me), no girl can out-(freak me)
(Man, I'm gettin tired) Ready C, give me a beat, please
He does a lot that others cannot do
Ready C and the Prince, the toughest two man crew
We're comin out rockin and we're takin what's ours
Ready C is the man and the suckers he devours
Beat after beat he gains respect
Ready C is the man that's keepin others in check
I like to rock with him, side by side
Me and Ready cold chillin with the utmost pride
So if you're not down by law to rock the spot
Then get the hell out, cause we're never gonna stop
My beatbox
We been rockin kinda hard ever since we begun
Yo Ready C, man, play Stanford and Son
( *Ready Rock C intonates theme from 'Stanford and Son'* )
Now play it under water
( *same routine sounding like it's done under water* )
How 'bout a fresh beat
A fresh beat
Ready C, how 'bout a fresh beat
A fresh beat
Bust it
( *Ready Rock C switches to another beat* )
Well, his name is Ready C, and I'm tellin you
He can play a beat forwards and backwards too
( *Ready Rock C makes the beat sounding like it's being spun backwards on a turntable* )
Play it backwards

Go Ready Rock, go Ready Rock...
Bust it
Backwards

Do you know where you're goin to
And do you like the things that Ready C is showin you?
(Showin you) where you're goin to (goin to)
Do you know that we are down by law
We want you all to know that we're primal of all
And when we rock the house there is no doubt
That me and Ready C will turn it out
Do you know where you're goin to
And do you like the things that Ready C is showin you?

As We Go,"He’s the DJ, I’m the Rapper",1988.0," ""As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!""

Now let's get this party started off the right way
Oww and HOE I think the crowd might say
When we're on stage you know you can't resist
{""As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!""}
I'm the ultimate and that's all I can say
I sat down for about eight hours today
Tryin to figure out the proper description of ME
And I came to the decision that
There's no one syllable or phrase
That can adequately describe this new craze
But I'll sum it up in one sentence, let's see
OK, I've got it, ""All praise me!""
Yup -- that's about the size of it
I know it sounds kinda strange, doesn't it?
But when we're on the stage you know you can't resist
{""As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!""}
 ""As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!""

It was a Friday afternoon if I remember it correctly
But I can't quite recall the time exactly
But it was somewhere around, two or three or four
Oh forget it, let's just go on
Anyway I stepped out of school
Sneaks were Gucci shirt was Polo and my pockets were full
Blew some kisses to the girlies cause I like to tease
They started chantin my name, I said, ""Ladies.. please!""
I grabbed my friends and hopped in my Benz
Grabbed a Martini and Rossi passed out to my posse
Things were lookin good. I had plans for later on
Plans for Donna Michelle, plans for Stacy LeShaun
Word! I was ready, I wonder if Jeff's home
Let me give him a call, on my car phone
Yo Jeff, what's shakin?
 Coolin, whassup?
 Girlies
 I'm with it, come pick me up!!!
 I caught up with Ready on the way to Jeff's
A whole carload of girlies and they ALL was def
We walked into Jeff's and said, ""Girls, you can't resist""
{""As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!""}
 ""As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!""
 Yo Jeff man, are you with me?
{Jeff scratches.. ""Hit it!""}
 I didn't hear you man, are you with me?
{Jeff scratches.. ""Hit it!""}
 I'm with it to GET BUSY!
 ""As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!""

Ready Rock C, give Jeff a hand!
{Ready Rock beatboxes while Jeff scratches the same sample}
 ""As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!""

Throw away them chairs, cause you don't need em anymore
Cause this hip-hop hit, is gonna keep you on the floor
If you dance everyday or if you never danced before
It doesn't matter if it's {""somethin like this""}
Time is essential, so let's make the best of it
Today we don't have a lot of time, so let's not throw it all away
Let's use this time in a very special way
Let's use it, {""somethin like this""}
I went outside at about 12:30
I saw a couple girlies, and they were lookin pretty good!
.. if you know what I mean
So I freshened my breath and stepped on the scene
I walked over to em, stepped in between them
One stepped to the other, ""I think that I've seen him
Somewhere before."" I said, ""Sweetheart, you might have""
She said, ""Oh yeah, it was last night
At that party."" I said, ""Yeah I tried to talk to you there
But you were acting as if you were scared.""
She said, ""I'm not scared now."" I said, ""Bet, well let's go then.""
She said, ""But hold up, what about my friend?""
I said, ""I got a friend!"" So the three of us left
Went back to my crib and gave a call to Jeff
Five minutes later Jeff walked in
And I thought to myself, ""Yeah, now the fun begins!""
But the girls started buggin, and they said, ""Now we want
Dinner in the best restaurant in town
We want caviar and lobster tails, both by candlelight
And Dom Perignon."" I said, ""Yeah right!""
Y'all must be crazy, and Jeff said
 ""Y'know?
I really think it's time for these ladies to go.""
 We walked em to the door and told em they were dismissed
And it went a little {""somethin like this""} *door slams*
But that was okay, that was alright
Cause we still had fun that night -- yaknowit!
The moral of the story is plain and visible
We always watch out for those kind of women
But the past is the past and the present is the present
And we feel that everyone should be sitting down
{""so you all don't miss""}
{""As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!""}

{""As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!""}

{""As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!""}

Listen homegirls let me talk to you
Girls may be trouble but guys are trouble too
Next time a guy try to give you a play
Just turn your head and diss him and walk away
Excuse me Ice Cream Tee
Hello how do you do
Quite fine my darling and how are you
Well I'm doing quite fine but I'm kind of upset
Because I heard a little something I could not forget
What's that?
 I heard you say that girls are nothing but trouble
And now I'm taking this time to bust your bubble
Your arrogant conceited your stuck on yourself
And bragging nearly every time you open your mouth
You think you'll gets the women success will turn your head
Well I'm sorry to inform you that stuff is dead
Wait a minute let me talk to you
I think I should inform you who you're talking too

Before we have you arrested what's the meaning of this
You say girls are full of trouble I must play this to you
Girls may be trouble but guys are trouble too
You're a compulsive liar you mind is full of dirt
All you do is worry about what's up a girls skirt
You can't hurt these people because you got a big mouth
You go run and tell your boys how you made out
I think ruthfully your sick you need to be kicked
See I'm getting my loaded weapon you get on my nerve I go click
Guys think they own their girlfriends
Females aren't possessions we are humans
We like to be wined and dined by candle light
Not being couped up in the house trying to be held up tight
So Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Princedon't mean to bust your bubble
But guys of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So homegirls next time a guy tries to give you the play
Just turn your head and cold diss him and walk away

This amazing hot day I went to see Barney from work
My briefcase in my hand sitting down on my skirt
The undergounds of the surface was the scene of my walk
I got approached from the rear he said 
Baby can we talk
I looked him in the eyes with this fabulous smile
He said 
I just got paid lets hang out for a while
I said first would be my pleasure to know who you are
And do I have to use my tokens or do you have a car
Well my name is the Prince and I'm a great rap star
You don't have to use your tokens I've got a Jaguar
I knew there was no doubt I'd jump on this mission
I proceeded to tell him my name with police suspicion
I said Ice Cream Tee was the title I was given
SWP the name of the hood I live in
So we jumped in the ride hit the 95
We turned into his block pulled up in his drive
First step in the house I saw a mouse
I said ninety in the wrong trips and then with the ow
He came running to my rescue he was a little late
My hair was broke my briefcase was in a totally different place
He said 
I'm sorry take a sip of this bacardi
And excuse me while I go freshen up for the party
I got a little confused I said party what's up with dude
He didn't even tell me I thought that was quite rude
Suddenly through the door was three men in suits
They said hey sweet mama who are you
I said I'm Ice Cream Tee and who may you be
I'm brother Charles, brother Rick and he's brother Ali
Are you here to see the Prince
Prince no Prince works for me im running the show
Work for me and at 12 o'clock midnight you'll be working 42nd street
Oh my god I was totally stunned
He yanked me up slapped my cheek and put his hands on my buns
I said ha you better watch it sucker
I said to myself I got to go get my geurney
He put me in this locker called me a b e and h
Looked around noticed that there was no escape
Left the room went behind closed doors
I pulled down got my briefcase that was on the floor
Flipped the latch lift the lid pulled out my Smith-n-Wesson
Yes my shiny black loaded 357
Stepped out of the room dressed in shoot of the load
And said they all lay me down and hit me with this tune
When they see my Smith-n-Wesson their eyes got bigger
I relaxed latch off chilled back and pulled the trigger
Picked up the briefcase broke out on the double
These guys of the world are full of trouble

I love you so is what you'll be sayin, while this record's playin
You reminscin and kissin your girl
Relax, lay back, unwind, because now it's time to chill
Setting the mood, by the use of this groove
Is an ingenious, perceptive, brilliant, a very clever move
Because the bass line, combined with the fresh rhyme
At a slow tempo entices passion to grow
But if it's not passion for which you search
Then use the song as a massage after a hard day's work
And if it's true that music calms the savage beast
Play this cut in the jungle and put the lions to sleep
Take a deep breath, stretch, kick off your footwear
Put on the tape of this record, but beware
Caution, warning, it's your decision
There's nothin stronger that you can buy, without prescription
It's soothing, somewhat hypnotic
A rhythmic anesthetic it's practically a narcotic
You want it?  We got it -- come get it we're widdit
Because it's all at the push of a button, yo Jeff, hit it!
The objective, of this musical extravaganza
Is to enlighten you, stanza by stanza
Verse after verse, have been precisely arranged
Rearranged and then changed until the best remained
The result being, this incredible song
So for at least eight hours a day, you'll have this record on
In the morning and at night in your room
And all through the afternoon, you will be
Listening, mentally wrapped up in the cut
Some people will sit down and some will choose to get up
But whatever you choose, just keep your ear to the wax
Because we got somethin def that other rappers lack
We haven't been able to put our fingers on what it is
But it's different and it's def and it appeals to kids
And teens and adults and senior citizens too
And I'd be willing to bet, that it appeals to you, too!
So if you're not into rap, give us a chance
To change your mind, and to make you dance
To this lyrical miracle, this musical discovery
But yo I wanna chill for a second, yo Jeff, cover me
It's like paradise, this music is nice
It makes you hot if you want it too, or twice as cold as ice
It brings love to the heart of a criminal
With this subliminal power, all the women'll
Flock while all the guys rock, when it's on your box
It gained us a much bigger reputation than the White Sox
You may ask yourself are we that famous?
Bust this, the Queen of Spain knows what my real name is
Our time is runnin short so I'll bid you farewell
You know this cut is so def, that you have been overwhelmed
Be cool, be chill, relax, have no fear..

Here We Go Again,"He’s the DJ, I’m the Rapper",1988.0,"Loyal fans and newfound followers
Whats up y'all Hello how are you doin out there
You're chillin, I'm winnin
Oh, by the way, the album's out, go get it
We went to the studio and then we made a video
We didn't make a movie though, maybe the next year or so
Yo, I got a message for my fans and friends
The last album was def y'all, and here we go again!
No applause, no applause, thank you, thank you
We're back again, and we're plannin on rockin you
Ten times harder than any other crew can
Jeff is like Conan, I'm like Tarzan
In other words, wherever we go
Haha We're runnin the show
, but no seriously
It's been a while since we dropped one
But it's out now, go buy the album
If you bought the last one you know it was krush
But if you didn't man, you must not
Know what you're missin friend
The last album was dope y'all, and here we go again
A lot of people may not have bought the last album
But yo Jeff, straight up, we can't allow them to go out like that, our music is too def
We produce hit records right and left
Daytime, night time, def beat, def rhyme
Chorus line, bass drum, snare drum, bassline
All of this makes our records rock til the party's end
Here we go again!
When we first came out, we had a smash hit song
Then people started askin what's takin so long for y'all to put another record out for the airwaves
I said hold up let me explain when you hear a record on your radio station
It's probably getting played all throughout the nation
But we got lucky, ours was played in Germany
France, Japan, Sweden London Italy
So therefore, we had to go on tour
City after city encore encore bravo bravo
Sorry we gotta go
We got another show tomorrow night in Rio
The point I'm tryin to make is to let you all know
It takes a long time to travel the globe
But now we gotta start this whole process all over again
The last album was def and here we go again
Special thanks to everyone that helped us
Without you we would not have been able to sell as many records we went top ten
And god willin we'll do it again
It was a long hard road believe me
People tryin to steal from me and deceive me
But that's cool, you live and learn my friends
We did it before and we'll do it again",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-and-the-fresh-prince-here-we-go-again-lyrics
Ring My Bell,Homebase ,1991.0,"Yo, baby, you know what's up
Girl, you can call me up
And you an' I can talk for hours and hours at a time
This as an invitation
To a conversation
So when things get bad you know I'll be there to soothe your mind
Just call me up on the telephone
When you're all alone
And I'll give you a verbal massage
Until your man gets home
Or if you want to you know what you could do, well
You could always hop in your car and you could come and ring my bell

Come and ring my bell, ring my bell
(my bell, ding-dong, ding-dong)
Come and ring my bell, ring my bell
(my bell, ring-a-ling-a-ling)

Girl the way he treats you it's a crying shame
Like you're a toy and like your life is just some silly game
How long you gonna live in a situation like this
Cause you're a princess baby and you deserve a prince
Why can't you see it, it's plain as day right here before your eyes
I'm telling the truth while your man insists on telling you lies
He stays out all night but I'd be home by 8
And oh and about loving, hmm it's grrrrrrreat
I don't mean to insult your man up
But I'm trying to plan the
Rest of our lives together forever and ever
But first you got to stand up
Pick yourself up on your own two
Cause girl don't nobody own you
You don't feel well and I can tell
But I'll be here so ring my bell

BREAK!
You can ring my bell, you can ring my bell
Ding dong ding, hey-hey, ring it
You can ring my bell, anytime, anyplace
Ring it (you)
Ring it (you)
Ring it, ring it Ahhh

Open up your mind and you can see that I'm
Just trying to make you happy
And like I said a 1000 times
If you didn't love me you wouldn't be calling me up every night
To wipe your tears 'cause you and your man just had another fight
Who loves ya baby, I do
You know he doesn't care about you, let him go
Where's he at now, you don't know
Laying up under some hooo-ld up, wait, just let me chill
No need for me to get ill
'cause every time your heart gets knocked over
You know I'll wipe the spill
I know this sounds like a fairy tale
But this ain't no children's book
I'm here, for you to take me dear
Just open your eyes and look
At what the future holds for you and
If you _ then you might ruin something great
Don't make a big mistake
Pay attention to what you're doing
Life is full of pitfalls, ups and down
It's sort of a mission
Now you're on a rocky road
But you can get off
Just make that decision
That you want someone to love you, adore you and hold you and treat you well
So when you're ready to be treated that way, baby you can ring my bell

Pump Up the Bass,"He’s the DJ, I’m the Rapper",1988.0,"In the place to be
DJ Jazzy Jeff and yours truly, the Fresh Prince
Ay Jeff, do me a favor, give em just a little TOUCH of the bass
Not a lot, just a little touch Jeff
Word, word
Ay Jeff do me a favor man, Jazz it up
Now bring it all back
Yo man, now break it down and let me go for mine
When we first started out, Jeff used to come to my house
Just as soon as school let out. He used to
Come to my crib, and you know what we did?
We bugged out like two little kids, word
Jeff on the wheels, and me on the M-I-C
A better combination there could never be
So let's go back, for old time's sake
Yo Jeff! (WHAT?) Pump up the bass!
I . like . my . music . loud!
The volume, pumpin, the kickdrum thumpin
The people jumpin, up out there seats
When this record comes on, you think something's wrong
The bass is too strong
You don't have to check your record, it's not defective
It's just the way we wanted it, pumpin! Get it?
We like it loud, strong like a magnum force
I am the lyricist, Jeff is the rhythm source
This combination is virtually omnipotent
That means invincible, you know, dominant
So don't you cross our path, just stay out our face
Or we'll knock you down, pump up the bass!
Yo Jeff man, how bout a funky scratch
Now get funky with it
Now bring in the snare
Now break it down and bring it all back to me
Now pump up the bass!
I'm hyped -- psyched up
And I'm flowin, so come on let's go in
To the next segment, of this hip-hop fantasy
You say this can't be happening, why can't it be?
It's an equation, mathematically correct
It's Jeff + Prince equals hit records
It sounds too easy? Word, I know it does
You wanna know why? Well yo it's cause
Me and Jeff, oh, Jeff and I, excuse me
Blend like Kool-Aid, and flow like an uzi
That's why we can't be taken or broken or braken, whatever
And if you think we can, you're mistaken, we're clever
Cause what we did to make this record a hit
Was turn down the treble, pump up the bass kick
At the same time the volume was increased
Adding more strength, to this masterpiece
Of poetry, by now you know it's me
All our creativity, pushin to our destiny
I am on the M-I-C, Jeffery is the Disc Jockey
And to keep us company, the human beat box Ready C
Backed up by a family, and that is all we need
So that we can be successful as we want to be
The future is in front of me so here is a taste
Of the future of hip-hop. Jeff, pump up the bass!
Yo Jeff one more scratch man
Ready Rock C man, give Jeff a hand",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-and-the-fresh-prince-pump-up-the-bass-lyrics
Then She Bit Me,And in This Corner...,1989.0,"Ladies and Gentlemen
You are about the enter the Twilight Zone
They're here...
I was in a club one Friday
A lovely lady comes walking my way
She walked up and she said hello
I said, ""Hi. My name's Joe.""
I was lyin', so was she
She said her name was Donnie
But her shirt said Marie
She said, ""You get to know me
You'll never forget me.""
I said, ""Why?"" Then she bit me
Ouch!
That didn't hurt
Kinda kinky
But she ripped my shirt
She poisoned me (and) I went to sleep
I woke up at her house
In the back of a Jeep
A Blazer, '89
Tinted windows
I wish it was mine
Oh, it is
But where are my keys?
There they are...in the ignition
I'm at her house
It's a Teepee
No, it's a cabin
No, a sky scrapper
No, it's an igloo
... a shack
Forget it. I'll go around back
It's a castle with a moat
How I get across...boat
(Twilight Zone noise)
Shooo...I hate that sound
I went inside
Looked right, looked left
There she is
Oh, no that's Jeff
He's invisible
I went downstairs
It's a loft
No, it's a dungeon!
There she is, doing aerobics
No, yoga
No, that's karate
*You killed my teacher!*
But what a body!
No, he wasn't there
I'm telling you I saw 'em
No, really I saw 'em
He was playing checkers
No, Nintendo
Ok, I'm lying
There she is
Watching T.V
All My Children
No, that's Cosby
No, Speed Racer
... 
Shaft
No, that's Kimba
My fault...the T.V.'s off
There she is, what a doll
No, that's Chucky from Child's Play!
I kissed her
And she told me this was home
I entered a dimension called The Twilight Zone
Where anything can happen
I'm rough like sandpaper
Hard like algebra
You should be glad that I was nice
And I allowed ya to
Step on stage
To kick your rhymes off
I tried to be nice
But you mistook that for softness
Now it's over, to hell with your opinion!
What I say goes from now on
This is my dominion!
I dare any rapper to step on stage
Cause if you do you'll feel the force of my rage
I'm on a rampage!
Psych just kiddin'
Jeff wanted to do that
But I didn't
I thought that it would make the record dumb
I guess I wasn't wrong
Mary had a little lamb
Her fleece was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went
So did Humpty Dumpty
Jack and Jill went up the hill
To fetch a pail of water
Jack fell down
And broke his crown
Hickory, dickory, dock
Got to use the bathroom now

You Got It (Donut),And in This Corner...,1989.0,"Hello?
Yeah, I talked to him
Whoa, whoa..
Nah, you ain't got to explain nothin to me
See, you tried to play my man and end up playin yourself
Later for you
Nah, matter of fact later for you
And your golddiggin girlfriend you put me down with

(Thought I was a donut
Thought I was a donut
Thought I was a donut
Tried to glaze me
Thought I was a donut
Thought I was a donut
Thought I was a donut
Thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me)

This story that I'm about to tell ya
Is all about this girl named Daliah
5'7"", a Gucci queen
With gold all over that flowed like a stream
I met her in a club on a Saturday night
The girl's jeans were tight and I got hype
I thought about talkin to this little miss
But I kept seen guy after guy gettin dissed
Every guy that cracked got flagged
But somethin kept sayin (you) (you) (you bad)
I walked up and asked her to take a ride
I whispered in her ear, said, ""My car's outside""
At first she laughed and said, ""Nah, not yet""
Then I told her it's a 'Vette and she said ""bet""
""Under one condition: you gotta let me drive it""
She kissed me on the lips and I said (you got it)
(You got it)

Oh what sweet music she and I made
Only I was gettin dissed while she was gettin paid
Everything that I owned, she took it
All the way down to my foodstamp booklets
I was contemplatin her bein my wife and
All she was tryin to do was siphon
Every single dime that she could extort
She was Jane the Ripper, and she couldn't be caught
My friends tried to tell me but I stood behind her
(The girl ain't nothin but a 49er)
They tried to tell me but I couldn't be told
Because her beauty was a shovel that was diggin for gold
Diamonds and furs, I spent all I had
And took her shoppin every day at Saks Fifth Ave
Visa, Mastercard and even Discover
She told me this is the way that I can show her I love her
My friends tried talkin to me, they tried stoppin me
(If she had a gun they'd arrest her for robbery!)
I knew she was playin me for every dime
But I loved when people said (Holmes, your girl is fine)
But then one day, yo, I got wise
I found out she was messin with a couple of guys
She told me that she loved me but I guess she forgot it
Oh, you wanna play hardball, huh? (You got it)
(You got it)

The final night that I caught this girlie
I was out of town and I came home early
I caught her in a club kissin some guy Fred
Stormed up right behind her, grabbed her and I said
""Yo Daliah! What's up, baby?
Come on, you got to be crazy
That's your cousin? You think I'm a nut?
What kinda cousin would you let put his hand on your butt?
Nah girl, you done got out of hand
And it's about to seem like I'm the repo man
You vacumed all of my funds like a rug
But you stretched the cord too far, you pulled the plug
Let's what? Come on, it's too late to talk
It's like monopoly and I bought Cedar Boardwalk
But tomorrow you'll wake up and talke a look
And think the stockmarket crashed on your pocketbook
But it's over, now I want everything
All the way from Louis Vuiton bags to earrings
Especially the solid gold earring noodles
And the diamond watch, the whole kitten kaboodle
Don't tell me I'm trippin
Oh, you got amnesia now, you're forgettin
Who did what for who, I gave my all to you
I can't seem to see why you did wrong to me
I finally figured out what you're about
But it's the bottom of the night, two strikes and two outs
You can go make a sucker of another fellow
It's 12:01, let's give it up, Cinderella
I ain't goin for it, stop cryin
Like Ms. Melodie said: I ain't buyin it
Game over, girl, you finished clockin
You wanted your walking papers? (You got it)

The crowd goin loco, kick drum poundin
People surroundin us checkin the concept
Cuttin up a storm that's why the crowd is all wet
Other DJ's standin around Jeff
Tryin not to give up props to the worlds best
Shakin his hands tryin to say that he can't flow
Cause Jeff is a horse though that they all turn to
A mellow kinda fellow but in the past he
Been known to get a attitude and get right nasty
Snatch the wax, it's a fact not a figment
To get real and rip wheels its downright ignant
And when he step off, toss the confetti
He burn more wheels that Mario Andretti
Jeff is there anythin left you wanna say to the crowd

From the dark age into the renaissance
The rap obsession caused the regression
But one man stood up, and that man’s me
To show you what it takes to be a real MC
You need  riggy-riggy rhymes and stiggy-stiggy style
And if you fliggy-flow you get wiggy-wiggy-wild
You need to tiggy-tiggy take your take ya time to pursue it
Till your riggy-riggy rhymes fliggy-flow like fluid

Or standin around, clown, when I'm gettin down

Where's the jam? I search like a hunter
Find the party kick it like a punter
Back in the day they used to judge a MC (On what?)
By how amped and loud the whole crowd would be
I go 'uh', they go 'uh'
If I go 'yeah', they go 'yeah'
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)
It's like a drug and I can't stand it

	Ready Rock, Ready Rock, Ready Rock, Ready Rock C
	Ooh that was nice Ready
	Ready Rock, rrrrrrrrrrrrr
Ready Rock
	Hey man, hold up man
I think I wanna tell em a little about this man
Aight break it down Ready, break it down

Please pay attention, to my rhyme
So I can tell you all about this pal of mine
He's my buddy, my best friend
When it's a beat I need it's a beat he'll lend
I wanna take time-out, to talk about him
Cause frankly I don't know what I would do without him
We work together like a medical crew
When I'm backin Ready up {I'm backin Prince up too}
Tryin to beat us, that doesn't make any sense
He's Ready Rock C, and I'm the Fresh Prince
In the rap industry we're ranked as first
Ain't a better combination in the whole UNIVERSE
So if you wanna battle your future looks muddy
Cause you just can't beat my buddy
Word, break it down break it down Ready
We've won so many battles, people think it's a trick
That when the crowd gets to judge it's US that they'll pick
They see Ready's face and then they hear my voice
To choose us as the winners is the natural choice
Because battle after battle we remain on top
Cause it's not the way we look, it's the way that we rock
So if you thought you wanted to battle, bust this rhyme
Just keep it and I'm sure that I can change your mind
There was ten whack dudes tryin to play high post
One crew got bold and they began to boast
I said, ""Y'all SHUT UP and get back in line""
But they refused {what happened now?}  So now there's nine
Nine whack crews tryin to rock like this
They were bitin my rhymes, they just couldn't resist
I said please stop bitin, please don't imitate
But they kept on bitin, so there's now there's eight
Eight whack crews poppin big time trash
Tellin us that in a battle we can't last
The battle started at 10:30 and by quarter of eleven
Was no longer eight crews (how many was there?) There was seven
Seven whack crews in a football huddle
Tryin to figure out their next rebuttal
They came out strong, you'd think they are the ultimate
But we just dissed em and dismissed em, so now there's six
Six whack crews, tryin to be tough
Who the hell told em they could rock the mic like us?
We got straight down to business didn't pop no jive
We just {Whoosh} blew em out, so now there's five
Five whack crews lined up in the hallway
All perpetratin like they're read to play
My secretary walked out, she asked for one more
They got scared, and left, so now there's four
Four whack crews outside playin around
I said I'll take you all on, now how does that sound?
Not one had heart enough to pick up that mic
I said, ""OK, I'll let you go, PSYCH!""
That's the moral, of this story
Never try to take me and Ready Rock's glory
Cause if you do, your future looks muddy
Cause you just can't beat me and my buddy
Hahah, word, uhh
Yeah, ay Ready Rock, hold up hold up hold up
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
What man what?
C'mon man, man, I wonder, can, can I just interrupt the record for a second?",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-and-the-fresh-prince-my-buddy-lyrics

Loving you is all I want to do
 (Christopher Williams)
10 o'clock my flight lands
Can't wait to hold the palm of your hand
Been 7 long days, since the last that I saw you
And every free moment I get, I got to call you
Takin' every chance, to glance at your cute face
And lookin' at your 8 by 10 in my suitcase
Ain't been with my honey in a long while
And when I get a hold of you, mmm child (oh, yeah)
No tellin' what I might do
Cause I would be like a kid that got a toy and it's brand new
Can't wait to hold you, can't wait to see you
Can't wait to treat you, can't wait to be with you (oh, yeah)

Loving you is all I want to do

Bein' in love is like an amusement ride, G (woo)
I feel like it's a party inside me
Smile on my face, and there's a twinkle in my eye
Time to go to work, but it's so hard to say goodbye (oh, oh)
And as I think of you, it's like I had a drink or two
I feel dizzy, damn where is she?
Pick up the phone and call you about three (Female voice: hello)
Yeah baby it's me, just to hear your voice, just the thought of you
Got me trippin', it's why I just bought a new
Cellular phone, so I don't have to postpone
When my beeper goes off, no more runnin' to a pay phone
Your astoundin', it's why I'm expondin'
So vivacious, and baby your face is
That of a goddess, it's makin' me feel numb
A fe fi fo fum, yo baby come and get some
Of the man, the myth, so debonair
What said while fair, is a pair
We extraordinary, me and you as a team, it's kinda swell ain't it
Love is hole and I tripped, then I feel in it (oh, that's why)
From the mountain, to the valley, to the deep blue sea
All I can do is hope and pray, you want to be with me
I'm sayin' this from my heart, that's how you know that it's true
Yo, I can't wait to be with you

Yeah, presto chango I wish I was a magacian
Snap my fingers or tap my heels and then
Abra cadabra, righ there beside you
But it's seemin' and dreamin', that's all I can do
I'm in an airport, an hour until flight time
Can't wait to have you direct in my sight line
Got a warm feelin' in my chest, thinkin' of your soft caress
I miss you so much and it ain't enough to just reach out and touch
I want to hold your hand, in my hand
And walk and talk barefoot in the sand
(And I can't wait) to just see your smile
(And I can't wait) to be alone for a while

The Things That U Do,Homebase ,1991,"(Intro/Chorus)
(It's just the things that you do (5x)
The way you do the things you do)
(Verse 1)
8:05, the alarm clock sound
I grab my shoe and turn the damn thing down
But now it's 9 o'clock I still ain't up up yet
Work on time, yeah I admire the concept
You got me yearnin' and I'm anticipating
Seeing you I can't wait its hard to concentrate
My mind is blind from all the time, thinking of you
And the way you do things you do
(Chorus)
(Verse 2)
I walk in the park or a midnight rendevous
A slow dance, romance, my motive is see through
I wanna be with you
But I ain't hiding
A wave of love and I'm gliding and ridening
Things like that when you hear me
Sayin' sort of sounds like that same old cliché
Climb the highest mountain swimming the deepest sea
But I can't front, I want you to be want me
Cause baby when you grab me tightly
You send chills and tend to excite me
When you caress and fondle me lightly
Oh girl watch up cause she might be
Settin' yourself up the way that you tease me
Sooner or later you might have to please me
It's just something about you
The way you do things you do
(Chorus)
(Verse 3)
Now why oh why would an incredibly fly guy like me
Be chasing one lady
It's just something about you
The way you carry yourself when you're out you
Seem to have a sort of captivative style, I've parked the feelin'
But your whip is appealing
Since this is a subject that I brought up
I just mind as well admit that I'm caught up
It ain't the clothes you're wearin'
Your perfume or the style that that your hair's in
It ain't your body, how slim your waist is
Your new jeans and how pretty your face is
But I feel funny when it close proximity
Making me wonder what's gettin' in to me
It's just something about you
The way you do the things you do
(Chorus)
(Bridge)
It's nothing that you do (2x)
The way you do the things you do
(Verse 4)
The mysteries of this world I ponder
Just sittin' back let my mind wonder
What the, why the, who the, how the hell is this young lady
Drive me so crazy
Deeply in thought pose like the thinker
I blow you a kiss or a wink
Or a smile just to show you
It's something about you
(feeling kinda odd)
The way you do the things you do
Come here, come here
Come on out, don't worry
You want me to chase you don't you?
Just come here, I've got you now
Sss
The way you do the things you
(Chorus)
It's just the things that you do

The way (repeated several times)",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-and-the-fresh-prince-the-things-that-u-do-lyrics

I'm Not A
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
Come on y'all I ain't no
Yes you are
Up above the clouds so high
No not me I'm just a regular guy
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
Come on y'all I ain't no
Yes you are
Up above the clouds so high
No not me I'm just a regular guy
---Chorus---
Star light star so bright
First star that I see tonight
I wish that I may, wish that I might
Riff the rhyme just right
Now you all know how the old story goes
He went from rags to riches and he changed as he rose
To me that scenario doesn't apply my friend
Cause I'm the same guy I've always been
J-J F-P 1-9-9-3
M-O-V-I-E TV and CD
Me and Jeff, brand new on the radio
Step on the scene and the crowd screams, ""There they go""
What? a star hats quite in analogy
I don't think you and I should be described astrologically
Don't judge me by my car
And don't treat me any differently
---Chorus---
Lets take a trip down memory lane
You know back before everybody knew my name
Before all the glory, the fame and the cheers
When I was just the kid with the big old ears (check it)
West Philadelphia born and raised
Now that's the phrase you hear on Mondays
But let's get a little bit deeper than that
Back when Jeff was on the scratch
Back when I was on the rap
I used to buy records at this audio store
I barely had a dime when I walked out the door
I tried to get a break but they could never seem to cut me
Bot now that I got the money and they wanna give me stuff free
That's somethin that I'll never understand
Yo I can afford it give the break to the next man
You say I'm a star cause I'm large in the land
But excuse me what I do doesn't define who I am
 (ooh) 
It's folks you look up to
Um who is a star
(Buzzer) Sorry no score
People be flippin when they see me around
But yo don't trip just give me a pound
Step up and say hi it don't matter who you are
Come on what you all scared for?
---Chorus---
Out to see a movie
Chilling with my Lily
Acting kind of silly
In downtown Philly
She wanna see a new flick I wanna see a classic
So we flip a coin and we settle on Jurassic
Park the only thing that counts is me to be with her
Got some popcorn for the theater
Everything going just fine
Then this girl from behind recognized me in the line
I turned around and I smiled and she laughed
She said, ""How you doin can I please have your autograph?""
I said, ""ya"", and as she reached for her pen
Her boyfriend said, ""He ain't nobody. F him.""
""F me yo what did i do?
Watch your mouth man I don't even know you
I'm a peaceful man real easy""
I said, ""Look you got a problem with me, B?""
He said, ""Ya I don't like the way you act
Cars and jewelry and waving like you all that
I ain't sweating you no matter who you are""
I ain't asked you to, homie

Ain’t No Place Like Home,Code Red,1993,"I'm feeling sad (yeah)
I'm feeling sad (yeah)
I'm feeling sad (yeah)
I'm feeling sad (yeah)
I'm feeling sad (yeah)

Sitting in a hotel room
A thousand miles away from nowhere
Sloped over a chair as I stare
Out the window I sigh as I'm thinking
I take a sip of the juice I been drinking
I'm trapped inside of me
Lost in the memory
Of how things used to be
I think somebody better call a doctor quick
Oh never mind I'm just a little homesick
Thinking of my mum and my dad
And when I was young good damn I was a bad boy
I remember playing catch a girl, kiss a girl
Like a sucker getting slapped every time I pucker
But I kept on chasin
Kept on running kept coming like Jason
Much nostalgia keeps bouncing through

There's no place like home (yeah)
I'm feeling sad
I'm feeling sad
I'm feeling sad
There's no place like home
I'm feeling sad
I'm feeling sad
There's no place like home

Yo there ain't no place like home
And I'm itching for the hood when I cross the states I roam
On tour getting the crowds going wild and
Stacking the honeys in a pile and putting em on file
XL a paragon on the scene
Fancy hotels and getting chauffeured in a limousine
Travel the world but yet my heart is achin
I be yearning and burning for my mums eggs and bacon
Yo, there ain't no place like home, place like home
Ain't no place like home
Uh, I get a feel like Dorothy so I tries it
Kicks my heels but my Jordans wouldn't 'ize it
So back to reality
Back to Philly, get back to my family
It's fun to see strange places
But sometimes I wanna see familiar faces
Like charlie mack, bam, nut and wood
Names kinda funny but as friends go real good
Ain't no place like home for true
And that's why


Sitting in an airport my mouth watering
It's thanks giving day I'm just putting my order in
I call my mum on the phone kind a demanding
Don't stop cooking mum at seven I'm landing
She just laughed and said I don't intend to
My grandma picked up and then she ran the menu
There was turkey and stuffed corn and macaroni and cheese
And sweet potato pies ooh grandma please
On the plane now my mind drifting
Thinking of the way it used to be on Christmas
My mum used to put us to bed about nine
Saying it's, ""o f t baby, ol' folks time""
That'd be down stairs laughing and jamming
But then (boo) raise ya seats back for landing
I walked in the house I felt the love
And my grandma saw me and screamed
Now here come all the hugging
I got such a feeling of emotion and love
Because can't nobody can hug you the way your grandma does
Give me a shovel and put some food on my plate
My father said grace right before we all ate
And after he was finished I put a p.s. on
I said: ""Yo, there ain't no place like home
And I thank God to be here with all of you""
Cause I was feeling


On behalf of DJ Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince
We'd like to take this opportunity to wish y'all a (There's no place like home)
Happy Thanksgiving and a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
And all that sumthin sumthin (There's no place like home)
But we'd also like to encourage you
To take this opportunity to pause (There's no place like home)
Just take a minute and stop and look around at your family
And thank God for them (There's no place like home)
Because they not always be here with you
Peace

Jeff Waz on the Beat Box,And in This Corner...,1989.0,"(I continued to rock while
Jeff was on the beat box)
 (Hip-hop)

There was a party the other day, around my way
They asked if me and Jeff would play, we said okay
We dipped out to get the hip-hop apparatus
Came back with the posse in full effect status
While Jeff set up I said ""Check 1-2, y'all
Everybody clap, let's begin to ball""
I was rappin acapella, but I had to stop
Cause chaos broke cause Jeff was on the beatbox

(I continued to rock while
Jeff was on the beat box)
Now cut it up, Jeff
 (Hip-hop)

Did you know that...
Parties were all the same when we came up
We had to rearrange and make a change
I remember how it was, people standing still
The music was wack, so they chose to get ill
People started breaking and fights would start to break out
This is the reason why some people make out
Hip-hop to be bad, because of this behavior
Then like a miracle, two musical saviors
One with a microphone, the other with tables
Both of 'em ready, both willing and able
Bust on the scene like TNT
People said, ""Who can it be?""
Can't you see, it's Jeff and me
We are praised as musical scholars
Fast admiration, manifestin' dollars
Couple of kids with a bright idea
Didn't want a 9 to 5, made rap career
People tried to dis and make the egos shrink
But we believe in ourselves, so to hell what they think
Moving like a freight train, can't be stopped
Especially when I'm on the microphone and Jeff is on the beat box

(I continued to rock while
Jeff was on the beat box)
Now cut it up, Jeff
(Hip-hop)

I know I talk about Jeff a whole hell of a lot
But straight up, man, you gotta give him his props
There's not many people that can do what he does
Marley Marl, Teddy Riley and Hurby Luvbug
But other than that there's not many around
That can take that box and make it sound
Like anything that you could possibly want
Now here's a rhyme that sums it up
Jeff is diggy-diggy-di-dope and
You DJ's out there keep hopin'
His beat boxes will be broken
But you might as well just keep hopin'
He ciri-can't be tizzaken
You think he can, you're mistaken
All records he is brizzeakin'
(Come on, man, you can make it)
Grammy winning musicians
His beat box is a-kizzickin'
And all my rhymes are hizzittin'
The album's out, so go get it
There ain't no way we stizzopping
We keep the parties rizzockin'
We got the crowd a-hip-hoppin'
When Jeff is on the beat box

(I continued to rock while
Jeff was on the beat box)
One more time, scratch, Jeff
(Hip-hop)

Mh - let's see what's next on the agenda
That's right, oh yeah, I've got it, I remember
I was discussin; how when Jeff's on stage
He makes your hands clap, your feet tap, your eardrums pulsate
Your body will move as you flow with the groove
And you smile as he profiles his new rap tune
When he's on the stage he can't be stopped
'specially when I'm on the microphone and Jeff is on the beat box

Numero Uno,And in This Corner...,1989.0,"We're number
We're numero
Court is now in session

Here ye here ye, all listen close
To the man, the myth, the Fresh, the Prince, the utmost
I got a brain like a cup, and rhymes I pour 'em
Spectrum to the Astrodome and Forum
All the way to Wembley, fans are in a frenzy
Doing what I gotta do to make people remember me
Fast like Flo Jo
Crazy like Cujo
Both I know and you know
That I'm numero uno
My crew is numero

Order in the court prepare to cop the plea, sucker
Judge, jury, bailiff: they're all me
Your on trial but you can't win
Cause I wrote the script whereas you die in the end
So throw in the towel sign off just give it up
You tried to beat me in a game that I made up
And by the time you learned the rules and tried to change your fate
It's too little too late, sorry chump checkmate
I'm in the room to do my thing
You wanna battle, let's go, just get your butt in the ring
Ten seconds and its over, I yell out who's next
I got you off guard with the lyrical suplex
I flex my lyrics so that you can't jinx
The ship that won't sink more popular than the Sphinx
I'm a cardo will strong just like a dinosaur
You want more your not scared then what your running for
Cause I'm incredible, I do the impossible
I'm known to destroy you and your crew if you follow the rules
I'm number one, I'm the Prince, I'm the lyrical gun
What you're dissing me? Yo cut that out, son
Cause I'm a weapon, you heard what I said
And I should have a danger sign on my forehead
Cause I'm lethal, fatal, unstable
I'm nitro, standing in front of a mic cable
Waiting to blow if there's a flicker of static
To ignite the fuse in the room, you feel the doom
You tried to break but there is no escape
From the jaws of death you took the bait
Wait and if I say so you may go
It's like Mother May I
May you though? Hell no!
Go ahead and play me if you think I'm a joke
Just keep a brace around for when your neck gets broken
Cause you're gambling
Just like craps at Trump
Go ahead roll
Snake eyes, you lost, chump
That's the way its gonna be every time
You try to go rhyme for rhyme
Your rhymes against my rhymes are dope
Your rhyming is weak, your rhyming is wack
Wherever you got it from I suggest that you take it back
Hold up Hobbes, you say you made it up
Then cut your head off, because your brain sucks
You should a stayed back
You should a laid back
You Should a prayed that
I didn't come back
But I came back
Remember way back
You used to say that
I wrote wack raps
Now your screaming out somebody tame that
Lyrical cyclops
Yo Prince, please stop
Somebody call the cops, go get you some eye drops
Now here;s a word for the wise, don't go into the light
That's how I get ya cause I'm a poetic poltergeist
Now in ya mind is a vision
That's driven by my decision
To become an imaginational figment
Which gives me the freedom to explore
And roam the realm of your mind
And disappear when you look behind
You know I'm a gladiator
And I really realy hate a
Sucker stepping to me that's a p-p-p-perpetrator
Really I'm the invader, t-t-t-terminator
That's like setting up do-dat-dat-n-detonator
You know what that was
You know that I'm def cause
I just transformed it
Like Jeff does
Fast like Flo Jo
Crazy like Cujo
Both I and you know
That I'm numero uno
My crew is numero
Grand number
My crew is numero",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-and-the-fresh-prince-numero-uno-lyrics
Human Video Game,"He’s the DJ, I’m the Rapper",1988.0,"*Ready Rock does the intro to Donkey Kong*

Ever since I was younger, I was into video games
Tron or whatever, it didn't matter the name
Thousands of my dollars, have been poured
Into all types of games, tryin' to get the high score
But now I think I have a favorite
It's me against an ape, he's got my girl, I've got to save her!
Oh no, I feel an attack comin' on
Yo Ready Rock C I wanna play a game of Donkey Kong!
*Ready Rock does the entire intro and starts beatboxing after*

It used to be a problem this addiction I have
I would feel the urge, then I'd go stark ravin' mad!
Break into the arcade, screamin' and hollerin'
Anticipatin' puttin' twenty-five dollars in
Any machine, I was out of control!
I didn't need quarters I brought, ten dollar bank rolls
Bags of quarters, I was insane
People thought that I worked there, and asked me for change
But I would get defensive and yell, ""Leave me alone!
These are my quarters stupid, go get your own!""
Dude walked away with this look in his eyes like
""Yo man, I wonder what's wrong with that guy?""
I was addicted, a video burn-out
And I would crazy when the guy would have to turn out
The lights at midnight, I'd fall on my knees and say
""Have a heart pal, one more game please?""
Some nights I might sleep on the subway
Or outside of the arcade 'til it opened up the next day
And when it opened at a quarter to ten
It was the same old thing all over again
I was doin' bad, my future was bleak
I'd rather play games than eat or sleep
Until one day, this guy came along
He didn't have a radio but he was playin' a song
I got curious, so I said, ""Yo!
What's that noise?""  ""What noise?  I don't know!
""No fool, that noise you was makin there!""
""What this?!""  *starts beatboxing*  ""Yeahhhh!
That was def man, where'd you learn to do that?""
""Man, I don't know, I guess I always knew that
I had this talent deep down inside
You wanna hear some more man?""  ""Yeah!"" ""Come on let's take a ride""
He made sounds like I never heard before
And he still had more!
Then he got me hyped when he played this incredible song
And I lost my mind when Ready C played Donkey Kong

*Ready Rock does the intro, Kong shaking the beams
The ""How High Can You Go?"" music, and the actual game sounds*
Yo Ready, get funky with it!
*Ready gets busy on the beatbox*
Yo Jeff man what you doin'?  Give Ready a hand
*Jazzy Jeff throws on another beat*

Now my life is wonderful and I feel great
I haven't been in an arcade since '78
Thanks to Ready C I'm on an upward trail
Because he's always by my side, he never fails me
Whenever I have a video attack
He's right there by my back, keepin' me on track
So if I bug out, and act like a lunatic
He does Donkey Kong, and as soon as it
Gets to my eardrums, from his vocal chords
I get hyped up!
No matter how bored I am, he always comes through
Oh my fault, hold up, wait, let me tell you who
Ready Rock C is, here's a brief description
Of the things that he can do in his musical position
Ready Rock C makes sounds with his mouth
Yo Ready give an example of what I'm talkin' about
*Ready Rock beatboxes and then does Pac Man's death sound*

Game over!
Yo, Scram man, why you still standin' there?
The game is over, ha ha ha ha ha, sucker!",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-and-the-fresh-prince-human-video-game-lyrics
Trapped on the Dancefloor,Homebase ,1991.0,"You're trapped on the dance floor
It's locked there's no escape
There's no eat no drink can't take a break
No seat to sit down you gotta stand up
The record on the wheel reacts like a handcuff
You're in a cage and this groove will bound you
People in the club like bars around you
The doors open up and the people are pulled in
Here are the prisoners the DJ is a warden
Your mind is useless instinct takes control
Jam to techno groove to soul to soul
You been arrested, now you're being tested
The beat is a sex fiend, you're being molested
Snare drum kicks like pistol in spinal
You gotta dance and get rammed like a rhino
The DJ cuts with a knife like a surgery
Sayin that the slice ain't nice that's perjury
The music infiltrates you and takes you
Grabs you holds you molds you and makes you
Do things you wouldn't have otherwise done
Like shake rattle roll pump twist and then some
Ain't no law here you can't protest this
Stop looking around, there ain't no exits
You can't leave till the man pulls the needle
Take that as a warning, take heed or I'll
Quicken the pitch and make you dance faster
The drum is the whip, bass line is the master
Temperature's hotter and yet you still want more
You're a slave and you're trapped on the dance floor

Oh oh I'm trapped like a fool I'm in a cage
I can't get out
Can't you see I'm trapped
Can't you see I'm so confused
I can't get out
Now you're wandering lost in a jungle
You came in hyped up but now you're humble
Bringing out sweat in your silky wet clothes
You scream for help, blend in with the ""ow""s and ""ho""s
You try to sit but there ain't no spaces
The floor is a desert, a body oasis
I know you're on the tip for the rhyme I just did
But here's a little taste of my homeboy, El Sid

Ay a prince it's the El Sid's version
I'm a raid on the track, I'm a hip-hop surgeon
The floor is jam packed get away from the bar scene
The strum of the drum has you trapped like a sardine
You try to move no form of escape
The heat brings on sweat, stick on like tape
Party's like a pimp
Girls slim and trim on the floor
Don't try to shoot for the door
This ain't the gym
The party goers every night had a scene
They might try to be fly but still trapped like Venus
Ain't a spiff or a spoof
Boy you better not goof
You about to cave in although you ain't on a roof
The rhythm track from offside's to angles
Playing the wimp fight resist ... strangle
You can't escape until the DJ's banger's up
So play like a phone or coat and just hang it up
The speakers pumping out sounds and hip words
Lines between the rhythm designed to equip nerds
You better jam we don't care if you hardcore
Cause we got you trapped on the dance floor

Me and Prince got together just to kick our lines
No trouble at the party cause we're strapped with nines
Dance floor secure, don't bother trying to get out
You looking for the late AM this man won't let out
Nobody cause killing is mean
Got ya dancing in the dark and dressed like Springsteen
Razzamatazz a pizazz about to rip the flesh is my man Jazz Fresh

Soon as I worked through the door
I got trapped on the dance floor
See this girlie that I never saw
She was looking raw
Came a little closer
Then I approached her
Then I drop the fox trot so hot that I roast her
Break the floor into flames it's the damn shame
Hard to explain
I did it up like I was straight out of Soul Train
Listen as I discuss this yo bust this
Like Hammer in front of a camera, you can't touch this
Trapped on the floor like a vulture
Part of my culture
You might even thought I would drive to falter
Get live like the Jackson Five, Tito and Jermaine
Add a little Mike and Janet you can't understand it
Cause ham and Mike??? thought I was from another planet
Way I'm whipping and dipping
And sliding and slowly guiding to what I'm providing
Other dancers go and hide
Like Charles Manson
I'm prancin'
I keep you dancin' all night until
The party's over the party's over
Like a cowboy at a rodeo
Commence to make you do-si-do
Around the dance floor
Step to the new hardcore
I'm Jazz Fresh and I'm trapped

Next up to step up
Just to keep this rep up
The time that he possesses the best in a contest
Def with his right and left like Jazz Fresh
No other than the brother the lover Jazzy Jeff

I'm the one dance floor at the station
??? time around quarter to ten
Time served hard
The customers scarred
Your tickets to freedom
Yo you ain't gonna need 'em
Your sentence is 25 years to life
A bed and a pillow is your husband and wife
Trapped behind the steel
The steel of the wheels
Don't come to the party if you don't wanna know how prison feels
I walk strong carry a big stick
Sell myself all packed in thick
When they sound the drum you know its time to roll
Might as well have fun there's no parole
I set a trap and caught you like a mouse
For times ahead no chance for a halfway house
Pump the bass in all sections
Prince, Sid, and Jazz my officers of correction
Can't escape the floor cut the crime out
Fortified wall ain't no use trying to climb out
Cause I'm running this show and it's live in here
You try to escape another five years
I got you trapped and I'm your savior
You dance real hard you might get out on good behavior
But if you don't I give you more
Cause DJ Jazzy Jeff got you trapped on the dance floor",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-and-the-fresh-prince-trapped-on-the-dancefloor-lyrics
Summertime ’98,Greatest Hits,1992,"Intro/Chorus: *sung*
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind
Verse One: Fresh Prince
Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the base and let the alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back cause this is summertime
Chorus
Verse Two: Fresh Prince
School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
But back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to summer madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressing less
And checking out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Ridin around in your jeep or your benzos
Or in your nissan stting on lorenzos
Back in Philly we be ou in the park
A place called the plateau is where everybody go
Guys out hunting and girls doing likewise
Honking at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beeping at
It's like the summers a natural afrodesiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hit you and get you equipped for the summer time
Chorus
Verse Three: Fresh Prince
It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more
Cause you're invited to a barbeque that's starting at 4
Sitting with your friends cause y'all remincise
About the days growing up and the first person you kissed
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playing out front
Little boys messin round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinning a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wiping your car down
It's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout
It looks like a car show
Everybody come lookin real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin and maxin
Chillin in the car they spent all day waxin
Leanin to the side but you can't speed through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new defintion of summer madness
Chorus",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-and-the-fresh-prince-summertime-98-lyrics
Who Stole My Car?,And in This Corner...,1989.0,"Prince: Yo, Jeff what's up homes?
Jeff: Yo, what's up Prince?
Prince: What's up, man? Hey, where's my car at?
Jeff: Where's your car?  Why you askin' me?
Prince: Nah, I ... I parked my car right here.  You're standing here. I ... Where's my car?
Jeff: I been here for about an hour and a half.  I ain't seen it
Prince: 'Cmon man, stop playin' Jeff.  Where's my car at?
Jeff: No, I'm serious man.  It's not in my pocket.  I haven't seen you car
Prince: Jeff, where's my car?  I parked my car right here, man!
Jef: I don't know!
Now a joke is a joke and fun and games are chill
But this isn't funny y'all this is straight up ill
Now there's a limit to humor and this has gone too far
I ain't laughin no more y'all now who stole my car?
Now I don't know if you ever had a car stolen before
But it's a real crazy feeling when you walk out the door
And you don't need a map or any kinda chart
To know you're standin in the spot your car used to be parked
Now you know you parked your car there but yet you keep lookin
Cause your mind didn't accept yet that somebody took it
So you're scratching your head and tryin to get things clear
And there's always some idiot saying (you're sure you parked here)
To call the police would be the move that is smart
But instead you keep lookin where you know you didn't park
Searchin for reasons like maybe tickets you owed
Something to justify that - maybe it got towed
But not stolen n-never forget it
But then you ask yourself well, ""Where the hell is it?""
If there was a prize you'd win dummy of the year
Cause you're lookin somewhere else when you know you parked it here
So through never-neverland you find yourself strollin
Then when you finally accept that it's stolen
You call the police and they come and say
(That's the 437th car stolen today)
As if that's somethin that he really needed to mention
Then they start askin you real dumb questions
Like (well when's the last time that you saw it)
You idiot, right before they stole it
Now you're mad this cop is talkin to you
And somebody in your car headed to Kalamazoo
Officer Fool or whoever you are
Would you please get off your butt and find who stole my car?
I remember my first car, never forget it
A candy apple red IROC
, windows deep tinted
Talk about fast like a rocket to drive
Went from zero to 60 in like 5.5
And matchin red rims but that wasn't enough
It had a car phone for when I wanted to reach out and touch
An Alpine stereo the straight up rock
With 12"" woofers you could hear for blocks
The first day I got it I was frontin real hard
I could hear people sayin (damn, look at that car)
I was hyped and I wanted my friends to check it out
So I went to the spot where they're usually hangin out
Just my luck nobody's standin outside
And I didn't really feel like parkin my ride
So I honked my horn and nobody was comin
I thougth what the heck, I went inside and left it runnin
I was inside for 20 seconds that's all
I found my friends, I said, ""You gotta check this out, y'all""
But when we came back out the car wasn't there
(Man you ain't buy nothin) I did, I swear!
My friends went inside, I was mad they didn't believe me
Now I'm standin outside the spot my car used to be
It's hard to figure out what to do all alone
But then I got it: call the car phone
(Fresh Prince's car?)
Yo thief, bring my car back now
Before I bust your (hold up wait a minute pal)
(Seems like you forgot who's got the keys)
I thought: he's right, ""Well, bring it back, please""
Hello Mr. Thief, don't hang up
Aw then luckily Jeff pulled up
I told him what had happened someone stole my car
I said, ""Come on Jeff, let's get him, he can't be far""
We rode around for about 20 minutes
And we were just about to say forget it
When I spotted him, I said, ""Jeff, go get it!""
We pulled up behind him and man dude jetted
He was drivin all wild and fast
Like he was gettin points for the stuff that he crashed
I called him on the car phone again and I said
""Of course you realize when I catch you you're dead""
All through Philly was a high speed chase and
Dude was playin around like he thought we was racin
100 miles an hour and he lost control
And slammed my car into a telephone pole
I ran to the car said man you're okay
He said yeah so I punched him in the face
The cops came up as if it was my fault
They saw me punch dude and charged me with assault
If his neck was closer I probably woulda grabbed it
He told the cops that I said he could have it
I calmed down and they got things straight
I saw half my car at 7th street the other half at 8th
I wanted to just jump in the ocean
My car looked like it was a Lego explosion
Why does life have to be so hard?
Don't laugh, next time it could be your car",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-and-the-fresh-prince-who-stole-my-car-lyrics
The Girlie Had a Mustache,And in This Corner...,1989.0,"(Get down)

I was.. cruisin down the avenue, early one Friday
When I saw what I thought was a lady walkin my way
I turned my back to use my Binaca Blast
And I said, ""Hm-hm, excuse me,"" and she walked past
She was about 5'6"", or maybe six and a half
With a body like a goddess, man, this girl was bad!
Tight leather pants that fit like a drum
And two big - yeah well, she had some
Anyway from behind she was fine
But when she turned around, her mustache was bigger than mine
At first I laughed, cause yo, to me that was funny
But the laughter ceased when she said: ""Hey honey!""
At first I was confused, I was somewhat spell-bound
My mouth wide open and my chin on the ground
And then it hit me, like a bolt from the sky
I thought: hold up - wait - this girl is a guy?!
I tried to get away, I said, ""Well, never mind
Maybe I'll see you some other time""
But then he grabbed me by my arm and told me I couldn't leave
And said, ""Hey boy, you look mighty cute in them jeans!""
This had to be the most embarrassing thing in the world
My whole neighborhood was watchin me get beat up by a girl
And when my homeboys came, they didn't let me explain
They said, ""Prince, you're a sucker, you should be ashamed""
My pride was busted right along with my eye
Cause my homeboys didn't realize that this girl was a guy
And in retrospect I had to laugh
I can't believe I didn't notice that this girlie had a mustache

I remember last year, the day was October 5th
And my family went away on a weekend ski trip
And they left $100 and a note by the phone
That said: 'Don't have any company till we get home'
No company? I'm 18! They must be jokin!
And by 10 my crib was smokin
All of my friends with their hands in the air
Screamin (PARTY OVER HERE, PARTY OVER THERE!)
The party was jammin till at least about 5
And as my friends were leaving, they were like ""Homes, it was live!""
I thought the party was over, but really was just beginnin
I turned around I thought I was dreamin, I saw four women
Dressed in red leather, tight to their booties
I gestured with my index finger: come here, cuties
I tried to be chill, I didn't wanna scare em
I said, ""Hi, my name's the Prince,"" they said, ""Hi Prince, we're your harem""
I didn't waste time, I started shootin the gift
I said, ""Y'all the type of girls I'd like to spend some time with""
I walked upstairs, my adrenaline was pumpin
Till one hit me in the head with a lamp or somethin
The next thing I remember is wakin up nearly dead
With another Fred Flintstone lump on my head
Of course I was mad, this type of thing can burn at you
They tied me up and they were stealin my furniture
I said, ""Yo sweetheart, what's wrong with you?
What kind of stuff is this for a nice girl like you to do?""
She turned around and smiled and laughed
And that's the way that I noticed that the girlie had a mustache
Not four girls, four guys!
They were in disguise, it was a set up all the time
I made a complete fool of myself that day
My parents were pullin up just as the u-haul truck was pullin away
They walked in, looked like they seen a ghost
There I was, gagged and bound and tied to the bed post
My pop walked in and asked a brilliant question
""Son, where's the furniture and why is your room so messy?""
Obviously Sherlock Holmes had been arrived
I said, ""What do you think, dad, maybe we were robbed?!""
""I'm tied up, nothing's in one piece
Let's discuss the facts later, mom, please call the police""
I wanted to have a party, I thought I was clever
My pop told me I was on punishment forever!
And in retrospect I had to laugh
I can't believe I didn't notice that the girlie had a mustache",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-and-the-fresh-prince-the-girlie-had-a-mustache-lyrics
Dumb Dancin’,Homebase ,1991.0,"We gonna do a song
Me and my crew like to play around
We like to laugh and joke and have fun while we going down
Born and raised in Philly
We go jam and jam and jam actin' silly
We got a dance we do at a party
That we'd like to introduce to everybody
It ain't the Humpty nor the Lambada
More party pump than a damn piniata
You may have seen it on my TV show
Yeah I know I dance like a pro
Cause I get busy and I get loose G
On the dance floor can't another brother juice me
Cause I'm smooth and I move loosely
With a spin or a kick like Bruce Lee
Come on get on the floor and take the chance
Everybody it's time to dumb dance
Now what's a dumb dance you might ask
Well let me take you to my dumb dancin' class
Its called dumb dance 101
It's where we teach smart people how to be dumb
Here's the background and here's what's up
Back in Philly where we grew up
We used to party all the time
Just playing around and make a Soul Train line
This old train line the concept changed
To put it in joint got flipped and rearranged
The line turned into a contest yo
To see who could dance not the worst but the best though
So in Philly the dance caught on fast
People starting challenging me to dance
So I got busy quick as the music was played up
How you gonna beat me at a dance I made up
Now you know that I can throw that
Body of mine fine so I'm about to show that
Guy who thinks he can do it a bit better
I'm the creator, originator so go and get a seat to sit down
So I can demonstrate a dance that's easy to do
And you don't have to contemplate a move at all
Just take a bit of a chance
Its time to dumb dance
Everybody in the house just (Clap your hands)
Come on just (Clap your hands everybody)
Just (Clap your hands)
Come on just (Clap your hands everybody)
Say (Clap your hands) Say (Clap your hands)
Say (Now we come to the real thing) Ha
Well there it is y'all the dumb dance concept
But let me break it down for those of you who haven't got it yet
It's the new craze coming across America
And I really really really don't care if you do it with a partner
Or do it alone
If you do it at a club or you do it at home
If you really can't dance then here's ya chance
Go for your's on the dance floor everybody dumb dance
(What does it all mean) (I don't know)
(What does it all mean) (I don't know)
(What does it all mean) (I don't know)
(What does it all mean) (I don't know) Ha what?
(What does it all mean) (I don't know)
(What does it all mean) (I don't know)
(What does it all mean) (I don't know)
(Now then let us have some fun)

Uh!
Aight

Here's a little story 'bout a Friday night
Buckwild, cause yo, that's kind of my style, check it
On the town with a girl named Kay
Being a 
bow-wow-wow yippie-yo yippie
 any way
I was straight out illin
Why do I say so?  Cause yo, my girl was home chillin
Fancy resteraunt me and Kay frontin
It was called Le....um, Chéz...um, somethin
I was ready to attack her, unh
Giving the sexy look like Dracula
A little bit of soft music playin
And Dom Perignon, it was on, know what I'm sayin?
Every thing was lovely, but then
What the damn, my girlfriend walked in!
Oh my goodness, danger, trouble, dread
Oh I'm dead, mayday, code red!

My, oh my, what am I to do?
Gotta get away, cause my girlfriend's coming through
Um Kay, I gotta... um, well, see...
There's... well, this, um... excuse me
To the back with the mucho-quickness
My girl's gonna kill me and leave no witnesses
I'm in the bathroom hiding like a punk
But there's bars on the windows, I can't jump
Exit stage left, quickly plan B
Gotta find a way that my girl won't see me
Crawling on the floor, I'm feeling sick
Like this some old Charlie Chaplin flick
Heart poundin around a mile-a-minute
This time I really done did it
Down on my hands and knees on the floor
I'm looking at the front door
Ready, set, make the dash
Her back is turned, maybe I can get past
I almost made it, but then, damn, she turned her head!
Code red!
Alright... got a little problem here... need assistance
Mayday...
Break it on down!
(Get down!...)

All was perfect, the ship was sailin
But now it's sinking, so yo, I'm bailin
I kept on runnin, even though she saw me
And I sat and waited at home for baby to call me
I watched a little TV
Phone started ringing 'bout 12:23
I picked it up real slow, and said:
""Mmmmm..hello?""
She wasn't having it, she snapped, went bezerk
Girl made my head hurt
I tried to be as cool as I could be
I said ""Hey, wasn't me""
But she wasn't having that melody
Needless to say, she left me
Another brother just couldn't control his head, (the other one)

Don’t Even Try It,Rock the House,1987.0,"Yo Jeff, what's shakin, man?

What's up, dude?

Hey man, you remember that girl I knew
I walking to school, man
The one who used to diss me every day?

Yeah

When the record came out she called me two days ago, man

Man, my phone is ringin off the hook
With people askin me for tapes and free records
I - man, I ain't with it

Word man
Bust this

This rap is for you people in the past who were against me
Who snatched up every opportunity to dis me
Put me down like I was nothin, treated me like a jerk
Now I'm seein the pay-off of all my hard work
Cause now that it's MY records on the wheels
Somehow all of a sudden it's a whole new deal
So for those in the past who dissed me, don't deny it
What, you're sorry? Huh - don't even try it!

Word man

Man, people are a trip, man

Put everybody down about what's up with that

Yo word, man
I gotta let em know
I gotta

Bust this

I used to know this girl by the name of Theresa
I did all I could to make her release her
Emotions to me, but she just wouldn't do it
She built up a wall and I couldn't break through it
I used to walk to school every day of the week
Watchin Theresa walk on the other side of the street
One day I finally got my heart up to speak
But she dissed me and dismissed me with a smack on my cheek
So I bought six bottles of new fancy cologne
But all I got from Theresa was (Leave me alone!)
I bought new clothes to wear everyplace
But all Theresa would say was (Get out of my face!)
So I gave up this quest for Theresa
But then on the day my record was released, a
Strange thing happened when it came on the radio
Theresa broke her neck just to say (Hello..)
I looked at her, I said, ""You must be foolish
Why did you ignore me on the way to school if
You were interested?"" She said (Oh, I apologize)
I looked deep into her dark brown eyes
I said, ""You ignored me for months on and
Now all of a sudden you wanna be my friend?
You didn't talk before, so don't talk now, be quiet
What, you really like me? Huh - don't even try it!""

Man - she had a lotta nerve, man

Word man
Hey man, but she ain't had half as much nerve as that old record producer, man
Remember when he dissed us, man?

What - what up?

When I first started rappin I had one idea
And it was set in my mind very vivid and clear
I knew that I wanted to be a rap artist
I would give my all and work my hardest
But when I took my song to a record producer
He told me that I better go drink some rap juice, or
Something, cause my song was really absurd
He said that it was the worst trash that he'd ever heard
You know my ego was shattered, he busted my groove
I could hear him crackin up as I left the booth (Ha-haaa!)
I thought my song was good but he busted my bubble
The title was 'Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble'
Luckily I found someone who had faith
He lifted my ego back up into place
His name was Dana Goodman and he thought my song was on track
So two weeks later it was out on wax
It busted up the charts like a hydrogene bomb
Up, up, up, up it clim-clim-climbed
I made people eat the words that said I couldn't achieve
Now they had no choice but to believe
In me, then no sooner than my record came out
That same old producer started callin my house
One night he called me 'bout at half past 12
He said, ""I've got some cash if you wanna sell""
I said, ""You big, stupid, half-wit idiot
I told you before that my record was a hit
But you just laughed like I was some kind of kid
Now don't you regret what you did?
I wish you'd get off my tip, yes, that's my request
You see, he who laughs last, always laughs best
Okay, I'll be reasonable - You wanna buy it?
Okay, I'll sell it - psych - don't even try it!""

Ha-ha
That's how you gotta put it to him

Word man, that's how you gotta..

You know what?
Let me tell you something
I got dissed so hard, man
Bust this
I'ma tell YOU what's up

Yo Prince - do you remember when we first started out
How we used to go to all the parties just to rock the house?
(Word man, I remember those good days well)
Why chill out, man, cause I got a story to tell
About five years ago I began my quest
To be the best deejay in the whole U.S
There was a lot of deejays strivin for my spot
They would put me down every chance they got
Never cut me a break on any given night
They used to all look at me and say (Pfsss.. Jeff's aight)
(But when your 'Magnficient Cuts' were released
All of that laughter ceased)
Word
(When you and I used to do our shows
All the crowd would say was 'HO, HO, HO')
Yeah, time after time we were tearin it up
While you rocked the mic and I rocked the cut
But now that I'm makin a name for myself
All those deejays are like (Yo Jeff, what's up?)
But all that stuff is dead, no, I ain't with it
They approach me on the street and say (Yo Jeff, how 'bout a ticket
Man, to your very next show?)
But I say no and I tell em where they can go
I can't believe that they had the nerve
To hop on my tip now! (Yeah man, word)
Just the other day homebody approached me on the street
And said (Yo Jeff, how 'bout a record for free?)
I said, Man, the way you dissed me, you better go buy it!
(But Jeff - we're friends) For real? Don't even try it!

Hey man, I'm tellin you
Straight up
You know how it is, man

Man people
People are a trip, man

Maybe they'll know next time not to dis people
Knawmsayin?

We told em
We let em know

Cause I ain't with it, man
That stuff is dead

Dig it

Everything that Glitters (Ain’t Always Gold),And in This Corner...,1989.0,"( *trumpet playing off-key notes* )
Aw man!
Put that ol' dumb horn down
Hey, Jazzy
Jazzy
Show this boy what some real music 'posed to sound like
He-he-ha!
( *drums and horns set in* )
1-2-3-4
( *Jazzy Jeff starts scratching* )
(Don't stop the rock)
Now that's a record!
Now that's a record!
Go Jazzy, go Jazzy, go
I want to be remembered for the songs that I sing
Not only for the humor, but for the knowledge I bring
To broaden the horizons of others is why I rap this
Enlightening minds with my lyrical tactics
In life everything ain't always what it seems
But people are enchanted by things that gleam
You know, bright fancy cars, big yachts and mansions
On the beaches of Aruba with a girlie romancin
Now I'm about to tell you a very interesting fable
More fun than when you first got cable
The moral to be learned from this story to be told
Is that everything that glitters ain't always gold
On July 11th I was sittin at home
Talkin to my girlfriend Gina on the telephone
Flippin through the newspaper checkin the news
When I saw an advertisement for a Carribean cruise
It said, 'Sunny skies and romantic nights
On an incredible ship' - and I got hype
It said it's like the _Love Boat_, baskin in the sun
Promisin fun for you and for everyone
I said, ""That's dope! Baby, you're down?""
She said, ""Yeah, we could leave right now!""
The very next day I put the check in the mail
And one week later we were ready to sail
The brochure said that the boat was large
But it was nothin but a  broken-down barnacle barge!
And if it wasn't for my girlfriend, I wouldn'ta went
Because the captain was a cross-eyed hunchback with a limp
The cruise was paid for and the food was free
So I said what the hell and set out to sea
It didn't take long to notice something was wrong
The ship was a mess and we were the only ones on it
I didn't wanna panic, so I chilled for a while
Till the captain pulled up to what we thought was a deserted isle
We looked on to the beach and almost went bezerk
We saw 300 natives with spears and grass skirts!
The said, ""Hung-a-dung-a-digi-dung-da-doa""
I said, ""Hey baby, I guess that means get off the boat""
Their chief said they needed a human sacrifice
I said, ""Well, just take my girl - he-he - psyche""
I was jokin, but things got serious
Their leader came out and he was curious
He got in my face and his breath was the worst
I said, ""Hey baby, you got some mints in your purse?""
His breath was stinkin with filthy brown teeth
And two big crusty ashy hairy feet
The worst thing, he had no toenails on his toes
And a big Pterodactyl bird bone in his nose
I tried to reason with him, he wasn't with it
He said, ""Tenga-shanko,"" that meant 'forget it'
He said, ""Gunga-shang-tang-da-bong-da-boo""
That meant 'tonight we're having Fresh Prince stew'
Then I saw it - no, it's not
The big Indiana Jones people cooking pot!
I wanted to fight em, but there was no way to beat em
I thought to myself, 'Where's Tarzan when you need him?'
Just as they were contemplatin cookin us up
We had a major struck of luck, a Navy ship pulled up
The troops came off and they got us out of the pot
And I said to the chief, ""Yo, I get witcha, hops!""
The guy that rescued us said, ""I hate to tell you
The captain of your ship, he had just escaped from Bellevue
We've been following him and finally we caught him
We're sorry, there's no way that you can possibly get a refund""
A thousand dollars and a weekend down the drain
But a lesson well learned, so let me explain
There's a very important message that needs to be told
It's that everything that glitters ain't always gold",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-and-the-fresh-prince-everything-that-glitters-aint-always-gold-lyrics
Lovely Daze,Greatest Hits,1992,"It's ten a.m. and I just woke up
Walked to the window and opened the shades up
Sun so bright that I can hardly see
But I'm a black man, so I pass on a tan
Dip to the bathroom take me a shower
But first called up my girl told her be ready in an hour
I was still a bit tired man I'm laggin'
Grabbed the toothbrush to kill the dragon
Lord have mercy great day in the morning
Turn on the water and I'm stretchin and yawnin
Tryin to get a blender to hot with the cold
Man I'm young but why I feel so old
Get it just right then step to the mirror
Rubbin my eyes to make my vision get clearer
Everything looks a-o.k
And today is gonna be a lovely day
Chous:
(a lovely day)
Lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day
So I jet out the crib and hop in the benzo
Today is my girl's day can all of my friends go
Just me and her top down on the highway
If you're gonna do it then why not do it the fly way
First a car wash next the barber shop
Then off to my girl's crib that's my next stop
A dozen roses a card and candy
I'm a true mackadocious Mr. Romanty
She hopped in and she asked where we're goin'
Yo we like a twig in the nile we just flowin'
Maybe to the beach or maybe hook up a picnic
But yo it doesn't matter cause today we just kickin' it
I threw in my homemade slow tape
And off to the beach for some beautiful landscape
Man this is a bonafide lovers delight
Got the ocean on the left the mountains on the right
I said yeah cause that's the way I was feelin'
Free as a bird got the clouds for a ceiling
I wish that I could press the gas and fly away
Today has been a lovely day
Chorus
It's dark outside now and it's gettin' kinda late
The date was great but here comes the moment that I hate
It's too bad a lovely day has gotta end up like this
A wave goodbye with a hug and good night kiss
Mmmm I said good night my lovely
I said mmmm good night my lovely
She said what you gonna leave me all alone
Oh I forgot to tell you there ain't nobody home
Now y'all know me I'm a real cool guy
But inside things was kinda like the fourth of July
We walked inside I said, ""Hello there miss""
Then she gave me a kiss oh you want some of this?
Unh passion building mentally bondin
Slowly I caress her and she's respondin
Close your eyes and keep thinkin of me
Here I come girl

(Every time you talk)
You ain't nothin but a dog
(Is a dog, is a dog, is a dog)

Now I don't know what it is
But I've had this problem since I was a little kid
Girls were drawn to me
You might be askin yourself ""how big a problem could that be?""
Check this out and peep this here y'all
Bein this f-l-y got pitfalls
Cause I got it rough
Cause one girl for me ain't never been enough
And it seems that women can't handle when
Your paintbrush is for more than one canvas
But I gotta keep paintin' on
Like Picasso goin till the break of dawn
Now the way I play
The things I say
Never been a lie cause I ain't that type of guy
And that's why I get totally appalled
When females say I ain't nothin but a dog

Back in high school this girl named Tracy
Used to do her best to disgrace me
She tried to destroy F.P
She told all her friends I was a d-o-g
But yo I swear it was a misunderstanding
But she seemed to think that I planned it
She had this friend named Yvette
Who wanted to double date, cause she was likin' Jeff
But I showed up all alone
I told her that Jeff was sick back at home
I said ""I tried to call you
But we can still double date, me plus y'all two""
She didn't get what the joke was all about
And she slapped the taste out my mouth
And with a huff and a puff walked off
And then Tracy said ""he ain't nothin but a dog""

Dammit I ain't no dog
And thats one of the names I refuse to be called
Cause that label just ain't fair yo
Look I'm a prince I'm supposed to have a harem
Well of course I like you
But I like her and I like that other girl too
What do you mean I'm just like those other singers
Look I don't see no rings on these fingers
I ain't ready to settle down quite yet
I wanna call my name on the night set
I want a shoe box wit hundreds of love notes
I want my phone to ring till its broke
I wanna dance in France and Italy
And girls in Egypt thinkin just of me
I wanna be in the mix thats all
But I guess to you I ain't nothin but a dog
Chorus
Yo baby, can I rap to you for a second?
I just want to talk to you
Now, I want to know why I gotta be a dog
Why d-o-g gotta refer to me
Look, baby, I'm 21 years old
You know, I'm makin a little bit of money
I'm just tryin to see the world, have some fun, you know?
And yes, okay, look, I do have a lot of ""friends""
Well, uh, associates, I like to think of them as creative date associates
I mean, Yvette is my associate, Donna's my associate
I mean, I'm just tryin to enjoy myself, but you keep callin' me a dog
Oh, I'm a dog? (DOG)
I'm a dog, right? oh, okay well um, RUFF (RUFF)

This Boy is Smooth,Homebase ,1991.0,"Well I was cool and sitting by the phone and waiting for
A ring with a female voice or a date or
An invitation to a nightclub for some minglin'
But ahh, my phone started jinglin'
Picked it up I checked the Rolex first
I call one of my regulars worst come to worst
I said hello, but the voice sounded nervous
Baby relax FP at your service
The girl spoke up and her voice sounded very nice
I met you last week at that club called the Paradise
I said yeah babe I'd like to go their again
So get dressed and you better be fly, see you at ten
Hung up the phone and checked the mirror
Sort of like ESP I could hear her
Heart beating encaged with the groove
And all I could say to myself was damn this boy is smooth

So I pulled up to the club at the gate where they let celebs in
Entre booted a Porsche 9-11 then
Girls took a look at me and started to break
Ladies calm down, I've already got a date
Cruised up front and I was happy to find her
Tantalizing tasty tune named Tanya
I said hey yo babe let's not go in the place yet
Come on hop in I got Luther in the tape deck
I kicked the gift and the girl was like silly putty
She said let's go some place and chill, I said really honey
We went to the beach to take a little walk
I found out I was smoother than I thought
My hands like Maverick started to wander
Left and right then wound up behind her
Face to face and chest to chest and ohh like a spindle of silk
Yo this boy is smooth

Here it is verse tres
Back at my place
The scene was set because I set it before I left
Girl I'm like a tool, grab me and use me
Where do you want me by the fireplace or the jacuzzi
I never slipped yo I got my grip like a handle
Turn down the lights and lit up a candle
A bottle of chilled champagne right beside me
Radio booming pumpin' the Isley's
Maybe I'll grab her and give her a kiss
Or kick her a line on the smooth Billy Dee tip
Or maybe I'll take her outside where the pool's at
Smack it up flip it nah I'm too cool for that
Ahh I know what I'll do
Hold her tightly and caress for a little while
Make it gentle and slow not faster
Pause for the cause and heres a word from the master
Yo I'm the J-A double D Jazzy
Smooth as self smooth than I have to be
Knowing acknowledged recognized that that's the king of the groove
And I'm the man that blessed FP is smooth

Jazzy’s Groove,And in This Corner...,1989.0,"(This is how it goes)
Give me your attention, stop what you're doing and listen up
Because my partner in rhyme is about to tear it up
Jeff, if someone said that your beats don't excite
And that your cuts were wack, what would you say? (Yeah, right!)
Jeff's about to give an incredible display
And unequivocally prove that he's the best deejay
His name is Jazzy Jeff and he's preparing to shake and make you move
To this long and strong theme song, Jazzy's Groove
And it'll (make em clap to this)

And it'll (make em clap to this)

You know, a lot of deejays, they're just show pieces or statues
My deejay's swift and exciting and coming at you
To other deejays Jeff is just too much
He doesn't use the line switch as a transform crutch
Never missing beats, always on time with the rhyme
You know the scratches are fine when intertwined with a bass line
Live in concert, Jeff is never Memorex
You don't believe he's def? Check the flex

(Don't stop to the rhythm, cause I..)
I could talk forever, but still never explain
Why deejays flee when they hear Jeff's name
Jeff is number one, even though he just begun
Ruling hip-hop as if he was Attila the Hun
We make records, it all adds up a kaleidoscope
We work hard, so people can't deny that it's dope
Some music makes you shake, some makes you move

Music has a tendency, a way of making you feel it
It's been a secret and Jeff is about to reveal it
He'll get you hype, no deejay is def as Jeff is
He makes you smile and bow while he's flexin
He's a magician of sorts, it's kind of a sport
Jeff houses the wheels like Michael Jordan the courts
Ask who's the best and people'll say that Jeffrey is
Here's a math lesson, so you can all see how def he is
(1) plus (1) is (2)
(Once again back is the incredible)
And (2) plus (1) is (3)

Look, it's simple, just admit it
Jeff is the deffest, you wanted a battle, forget it
You're a fool, you're slippin, you're looney, you're crazy
No ifs, no ands if he tests your butt, baby
The music is dope, don't fight it, just give in
Hey yo Jeff, man, tell 'em why you did it

Shadow Dreams,Code Red,1993,"(Shadow dreams
Dreams of a shadow)

The analogy of a shadow dream
Dreams are to shadows as your shadows are to your dreams
In the deepest of the darkness it seams as though they're gone
In the light they are visible
Yet intangible and illusive
Your shadow is the true validation of the fact that you exist
Hence shadow dreams
And here we go

Shadow dreams they seem so distant
But the light is strong and no you can't resist it
Keep on pushing, hold out your hand
The light is your friend go on in Carol Anne
Its always darkest before the light
Nothing's worth having if it's not worth a fight
No love without labor, no labor no love
Draw on the strength bestowed from above
What can go wrong will go wrong
But if you fall off a horse just get back on
""I have a dream"" the man stated
A shadow dream that he chased to his grave
Just because a dream is lurking in the shadows
Doesn't mean that you should just forget it
I mean, you work and you push and you sweat
And you toil and you strive and drive till you get it: shadow dreams

Shadow Dreams
Dreams of a shadow (Shadow dreams)
Shadow Dreams
Dreams of a shadow

Every dark cloud is hiding a silver lining
But don't get demoralized, keep on climbing
Do all you can to keep your shadow alive
Because you're not far behind if your shadow dies
Make sure you stop and you check tonight
That your shadow is behind you when you walk through the light
Cause a man without a shadow ain't a man at all
I mean, I take it just for granted that my homies on the wall
Kids see the shadows and they wanna play
But sometimes they're stolen, taken away
Adults are the thieves, the kids get robbed
Throw away that shadow boy go and get a job
Just because the dream is lurking in the shadows
Doesn't mean that you should just forget it
I mean, you work and you push and you sweat
And you toil and you strive and drive till you get it: shadow dreams

Shadow Dreams
Dreams of a shadow (Shadow dreams)
Shadow Dreams
Dreams of a shadow

Fourteen years old I used to want a Bimmer
I guess you could say I was what you'd call a shadow dreamer
I told my father that I didn't think I'd ever get it
I said: ""I might as well just forget it""
My father said: ""Son, don't be talking so dumb
Hard work and education makes anything come
And plus a shadow dream ain't as far as it seems son
You used to be a shadow dream""
Life is a mystery but let's check history
And see how many peoples shadow dreams came true
And if the other peoples shadow dreams were equal
Then why can't the next shadow dreamer be you?
That's the philosophy I live my life by
When things get hard through the stress and strife I
Keep on pushing with a full head of steam

From Da South,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Right here, right
(Yep)
When I was a young boy growing in Philly, I
Was sort of easy going, I
Was really a silly I
I used to mess around
I was kind of the class clown
I hate to see you frown
I hate to see people down
Â€˜Cause I like it when fun flows like a faucet (uh)
But sometimes, some guys mistake it for softness
But I ain't no silly sappy singin softy
When push comes to shove, ya better back up off me
Â€˜Cause I am 6'2 and I ain't no little guy
200 pounds and homie I can make the heads fly
My father told me never hit nobody first
But if they hit you son (Yeah), take them to a hearse
So throughout my life those are the rules that I've lived by
A sucker put his hands on me homie I'll give a guy
A jab, jab, jab, uppercut, jab
Get â€˜em a steaks slab
And put â€˜em in a cab (Uh)
Now I ain't the type of brother to go out and pick a fight
But man, man I really, really, hate to hear stuff like
Michael Jackson said, ""this sorta thing silly manâ€¦""
A lover not a fighter, better stay out a Philly man
Put up your dukes, so you better start boogen
A sick upper punch when you lunchin' and ain't lookin'
An mx uppercut, aim for the mouth
Not from the north, or the east, or the west, it's comin'
From da south
And I'm throwing it hard
From da south
Right up under your guard
From da south
An uppercut with all I got
(Watch them drop!)
Put up you dukes; it's time to get loose troop
101, with me and you, and me and you're whole crew
You heard about the uppercut is that's what's wrong fellas
You're all chickens and for doers getting jealous
Fail one bang â€˜em
Rumble and all buggin'
All different names but all the same buggin'
Maybe you can take me out, yeah maybe not
Â€˜Cause fly into the uppercut (Here they come) and hear you're body shout
Boom shakala laka Boom shaka laka Boom!
Look out
It's coming at you like a Kodak zoom
No, my name ain't Roberta, don't be giving me flak
And if you step off track, Jack
You're taking a turn, nap
A muscle bound sucker, mean jack to Will
When I walk on by better be glad I chill
But if y'all forfeit and I feel friction
The landlord is givin' ya teeth dental piction
X's over eyes and birds around ya heads, flyin'
Limp all back
Look like I hit you with a bat
Eyes so black (diggy, diggy)
Look like ya must a got em painted
Damn!
That uppercut's a mother ain't it
Step in the ring
With the king
And you take a chance
Â€˜Cause 20 seconds later y'all be out in a ambulance
Lookin pathetic
As you wrestle paramedic
What's up?
Felt like a truck
But it was only an uppercut
Jus last week some fool got careless (Yeah)
So I got triflin'
Went right for the bare fist
After the punch the young man didn't want a fight
I missed his face
But I busted the stoplight
So put up you're dukes, so you better start bookin'
A sick upperpunch
When you munchin'
And ain't lookin'
An mx uppercut aim for your mouth
Not from the north, or the east, or the west, it's comin'
From da south
And I'm throwin' it hard
From da south
Right up under you're guard
From da south
And uppercut with all I got
(Watch them drop!)
Yeah

(There you go)
Come, come come onâ€¦",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-and-the-fresh-prince-from-da-south-lyrics
Who Stole the DJ,Homebase ,1991.0,"Let, Let, Let's Go

Calling all cars, calling all cars
Be on the lookout someone has stolen the D.J
Agent F.P. get on the case immediately

Lets, Lets Go

I Got the call about eleven fifteen
Twelve o'clock arrived on the scene
Looked around and things were ill
The party was at a dead stand still
People sittin' around no music
The situation was somewhat confusing
But I'm a detective I knew right away what happened
Somebody stole the D.J
Who or why I had no clue
But I knew what I had to do
No eat no sleep, just work
Then walked past this fly mini-skirt
I had to dis her quick before she greeted
Come on baby I'm working, beat it
Come on I'm busy, just go away
Gotta find out who stole the D.J

Let's, Let's Go

This mystery needed to quickly be solved
Cause there were kids involved
Friday and Saturday nights had no songs
Why, because the D.J. was gone
Smiles you used to dance and sing around
Now were replaced by frowns
And it was up to me to solve the mystery
And get back the disc jockey
I found an eye witness
But his breath wreaked of chitlins
All I know is his breath did pound
Buddy forget it, just write it down
No fingerprints no clues
The only witness was the bad breath dude
It was up to me to save the day
And find who stole the D.J

Lets, Lets Go

Through the door this dame walked in
I swear to James Bond a perfect ten
I thought to myself I'm working just forget it
Then I thought well maybe I've got a minute
So I took her down to the station
To the back room for some interrogation
Captain doesn't like it, but I must confess
I interrogate best when I'm undressed
We were in there for hours drained
To see who would break first, me or the dame
Then she broke, and her mind was my possession
(Prince I love you)
That wasn't the question
I only wanna know one thing
I've gotta make the kids dance and sing
So tell me now cause crime don't pay baby
Who stole the D.J

I scoured the city but still no clue
Lost like a cause, what should I do
Then like a bolt of lightning it hit me
Ah, the worst villain in the city
I wasn't prepared for what was in store
He had stolen the D.J. before
You all know this ruthless foe
To his hideout
(let, lets go)
Tip toed up the steps
Slowly and ever so quietly I crept
But out of nowhere I was attacked
Just like in the movies, clubbed from the back
I felt like a fool
(man, you need to go back to private eye school)
I was the dunce of the day
There I was tied up with the D.J

Let's Go

There we were both tied to a pole
I told the D.J. relax its under control
(Relax man, we both goin' down you can't even keep yourself untied)
Do you want to be free or not
I'm gonna get us out of this tight spot
I planned this all along cap
There a knife in my swiss army hat
With the blade I cut the rope
(Man your secret services spy hats dope)
I radio'd for back up cars
So we could put this crook behind bars
Another criminal off the streets
Another D.J. back to his beats
I walked in the club and I was happy to say
Ladies and gentlemen, here's your D.J

Let's Go

Calling all cars, calling all cars
Be on the lookout, (let, lets go)
Someone has stolen another D.J
Calling private eye Fresh Prince
Be on the lookout (let, lets go)
Someone has stolen another D.J
Get on the case immediately

In the middle (In love)
Caught (In life)
In the middle (In love)
Caught (In life)
In the middle (In love)
Caught (In life)
In the middle (In love)

Love and life a mysterious combo
Sit back relax cause now its time to go
Back in my past my personal strife for being
Caught in the middle of love and life
Love is a fairytale earthly bond
But life is true reality chimes
When life brings on love is kind of hard for you to give up
The satisfaction you started for
This is a metaphor sort of a riddle
If your confused chill and I'm sure it'll
Clear up for you in a little bit
Love and life and I'm caught in the middle of it

Caught (in life)
In the middle  (in love)
Caught (in life)
In the middle (in love)

Who or why your love ain't always right
Especially when you cross the pass of life
The wrath of life is hard
Cause your taught to dream on
But when your out in the world realities on
You found somebody to be with
You pour your lovin in and it seems as if
You're pouring your love into a bottomless pit
You love each other but it just ain't workin
You're not meant to be together it seems like
Well just think maybe its things like
She work 9 to 5 you work 5 to 9
Never together two separate lives
Love versus life see what I mean
You like the movies she like the club scene
Nobody's wrong and nobody's right
Just caught in the middle of love and life


Everybody wants to capture the rapture
Love and live happily ever after
Walking around barefoot sniffing daisies
Laying around all day long making babies
Go to France and dancin eatin in Sweden
Gambling in Rio
Winning cause you're cheating
These are situations you can have some fun in
But open your eyes and real life comes running in
Dreaming again a plateau to come down off
Back to the world and see your love life sounds off
Start the day right call your girlfriend
But love and life start at it again
She says baby I need to send you
You say babe I got work to tend to
Love tells you to go be with her
But life says boy get your butt to work
Think of love and life as a rock and a hard place
Exhilarating like a high speed car chase
Heart ache heart break cuts like a knife

Just Rockin’,Rock the House,1987.0,"Each and every day when I come home from school
Like clockwork I go up into my bedroom
I secure the door and it's the moment of truth
I flip on my sound system and let the bass loose
The earthquake bass makes the walls all tremble
A discotheque is what my room resembles
How loud it gets to me it does not matter
I open up the windows so the glass don't shatter
The blast falls off my neighbour's wall
My phone rings of the hook with complaint phone calls
But I just let it ring and I don't go near it
I turn the volume up so that I can't hear it ring
My ear drums rumble my lungs vibrate
I'm in my own world and this realm is great
We rock this power at my command
The decibels exceed the limits human ears can stand
The lower frequency better known as bass
Sitting nice with the treble at a jazzy pace
My neighbours complain they say they can't endure
They form a congregation outside my front door
Mothers who yell saying its too loud
Start banging on my door to turn it down
My response to my mother when she starts knockin
Is come on mum I'm just rockin


This style that's mine is rarely heard
Suddenly there is an opportunity to observe
People gots my rhyme the super computer
The literary genius rhyme ruler of the future
I'm the fresh prince slaying all emcee
So hold the red cup when we take to your knees
Pay home submit you can't defuse my scheme
Cause I'm the fresh prince and this is my regime
To all other rappers you're being subdued
I don't mean to be rude but this is my prelude
This introductory performance has just one plot
A sample jeff and about me and my DJ rocks
I'm not listening to reason so don't try to talk
Do yourself a favour and take a walk
Or I'll amputate your mic and repossess your core
I'm the man salute to the prince the power lord
My friends I'll mangle you if we tangle put my arms in your asophogus and
I'll strangle you
I'm the messiah or rhymes the verbal gladiator
I'm like a bomb and my turbo is the detonator
The crown chief of the poetry industry
Vocabulary that to others is a fantasy
Highly respected by the public at large
The prince will rock is taking charge
I'm like a tiger in a battle field I'm invincible
You want a battle me man be sensible
I'll never submit to any other emcee
Be a duel to the death either him or me
And as I verbalise to my DJ's cut
If we kill a wack crew or two so what
We just rock it
We just rock it
DJ Jeff
Break 2
On each occasion that I perform
The force captures my body like a magical storm
Suddenly I'm rendered helpless in a state of shock
But it is rather abrupt when I start to rock
Adrenalin rushes my ego swells
And the yells of the crowd make my hype excel
My metabolism quickens my body gets sense
That's when I metamorphosise into the royal fresh prince
And as I display all my lyrical beauty
You become a slave as your hype increases
And as I vocalise I can see it in your eyes
You stand up as your enthusiasm levels rise higher and higher beyond the
Mark of red
You scream oh my to what the prince just said
As my energy is drained from being so crushed
All of a sudden I get another adrenalin rush
It happens each and everytime that my dj spins
More commonly known as my second wind
The spotlights are beaming
You are screaming
From my body all the sweat is streaming
Commanding the stage
And perpetually frayed
Giving my all to the pulse of
One hundred percent everytime I rhyme
When I step off the stage that's when the stop
And that has been the account of the evenings events
Reporting to you live by me the fresh prince
I'm the latest that you heard so you may seem shockin
(what does it all mean)
I'm just rockin
Rockin rockin rockin

The Reverend,And in This Corner...,1989.0,"Now brothers and sisters
There comes a time in your life, you've got to get up and get busy
Can I get a witness?
(Yes, brother, yes!)
Now I don't know if you're prepared to embark upon this journey
But the time is running out
Brother Jazzy, break it down

Liggedy-ladies and gentlemen, hello, and how are you doin all?
Now there's a problem that we really have got to solve
In our society there's a big mess
People are having entirely too much stress
And me and Jeff, yo, we've been workin' on
A way to ease your everyday burdens of
Work and school, because we thought that we should
Make a record that makes people feel good
This is a remedy, simple and basic
You work too hard, come on, face it
You gotta treat yourself, you deserve it
Dance like a wild person, come on, you earned it
Young and old and old and young
Relax, come on, cool out, come and get some
You've got to let yourself go get loose
It's cool
Dance to the music

T.G.I.F, this beat is def
Can I get a witness, Jeff? (Yes)
Are you ready to start things off yet?
 All right, bet
Clap your hands and dance, come on, let's do this
Here is a hip-hop track with a new twist
Designed to ignite your subliminal dance fuse
And even if you can't dance, you can't lose
It's for everybody, you included
We hooked up a beat and a rhyme and EQ'd it
We put it on a tape and took it to wax
And then we-- yo Jeff, where's my beat at?
Oh, there it is, back to the storyline
The music and rhyme are designed to make you have a 
At the party, or wherever you hear it pumpin'
Get up and twist or breakdance or shake somethin'
Yo man, this groove is all o'that
And it's different from anything we've done, in fact
I might even go as far as to say
This cut shines bright on the darkest day
And sometimes you really need some light
Like when your teacher or boss ain't actin' right
This will quench your thirst to chill, it hits the spot
Give em a taste, yo Jeff, let the beat rock

Now Brother Jazzy
Please enlighten us with a bassline
( *Jazzy Jeff lets the bassline play* )
And for all the people assembled before us
Brother Jazzy, scratch
( *Jazzy Jeff cuts* )

We're at the top, not the bottom or the middle
We're the freshest, the deffest, the best
Jeff, cut it up a little
(Oh, I getcha, you wanna dance!)

Ahhhh... The time is now to get up and dance and move
And clap and jump and jam and feel the groove
I want you wigglin' and jigglin' and stompin' and shakin'
And showin' your approval for the records me and Jeff are makin'
We got a brand new album out
And dancin' and shakin' and movin' is what it's all about
We want everybody to get busy
You're not down with rap? Then get with it
This is a new age, history turned a new page
They said that we would decay and I say who do they
Think they're dealing with, a couple of amateurs?
I'm willin' to bet
You'll hear this jam at your job
And at your school dance and also on the radio
Winter inside the house, summer on the patio
Let me get out of here before I lose it
But remember the motto, y'all: dance to the music

Now now, ladies and gentlemen of the congregation
We realize you may not be in a position to get up and dance right now
So we'd like to ask of you, if you're in your car, honk your horn
Honk your horn to the rhythm
We'd like to ask, if you're behind a desk at your job
We'd like you to tap your pen and pencil to the rhythm
If you're walkin' down the street
You can be a little discreet
And snap your fingers to the beat
But if you are in a position
To get up and dance
We'd like to ask you to wiggle and jiggle everything you got
And get involved with it

The Men of Your Dreams,And in This Corner...,1989.0,"Hello?
Yeah, this is Prince, who's this?
Yo, what's up baby, how you doin?
Oh, I'm tryin to see you on a personal tip
You know that, right?
Heh
Ah come on
You been tellin me that for years
You're a little bit older than me, you know?
You're 30 years old and I'm 20
Age ain't nothin but a number, baby
Hey look, I'm young but I'm real strong
Heh
Hey look, I know that, I know, I know
I can't sport you around in my Benzito
And take you out to dinner and be seen
You know
That's cool, though
I tell you what
I tell you what
Got a remedy for this problem
This is what I want you to do
I want you to get a globe, right?
I want you to spin the globe, spin it hard baby
Pick anywhere in the world
And I'll take you there
We'll be together, alright?
You with that?

Greek mythological gods are inferior
Studs and playboys, come on, I'm superior
Any man can look and see where the curves are
It takes a real man to find where the nerves are
Women like huggin, kissin and carressin
And eh - ssssslooowww undressin
Calm down, chill out, take your time, dude
Don't be all rough and fast like a monsoon
Women are soft and fragile, you know delicate
It's really not appealin to then when the fella gets
All worked up and rushes to the pinnacle
You might think so, but yo, they ain't with it though
Candlelight dinner, just you and her in a
Nice restaurant is always a winner
Then ah - if she is first rate and on the first date
She says no, be patient, don't push her, just wait
Because a woman is a gift to a man
They like you +real+ hard but with a gentle hand
So get your act together cause if you're trippin up
If you're slippin up, then F.P. is pickin up
All of y'all slack men, cause what you're lackin
I fill up, so ain't no need to come back, man
Everything ain't always the way that it seems
I'm the Fresh Prince, baby doll, and I'm the man of your dreams

Yo, what's up
Yeah, this Jeff
Yeah, I heard you talked to Prince today, huh?
Yeah
Let me guess
He's 'young but strong'
Yeah
I kinda figured that
Let me ask you a question
Did he kick the 'globe' line on you?
Yeah, I thought so
I heard that before too
Look, I'm not into geography
So I'm not gonna ask you to spin no globe and point to where you wanna go
Or spend no dollars or even do back-semis when I come in the room
Because I'm not into that
You know, all I'm askin for is 60 minutes of your time
And I can set the whole record straight
You know what I'm sayin?

I'm not tryin to say nothin that's hard or complex
Or get you psyched with a pose or body flex
I win your lovin with a paid vacation
You know, I'm more into a intellectual stimulation
I make your mind feel good, your body follows it
I pour lovin in, your mind swallows it
I'm not dissin Prince, cause he's my friend
But boys'll be boys and men'll be men
Ladies, your battery's unstable?
Jazzy Jeff got the world's best jumping cables
14'000 volts of pure intimacy
That's enticin to you? Yeah, it was meant to be
Don't debate the great flow of fate
Let he who's Jazzy have you concentrate
Think of me and you makin love as a team
I'm Jazzy Jeff, baby doll, and I'm the man of your dreams

Yo Jeff, what up, hop?

What's up, man?

Hey, I heard that you was tryin to talk to my girl
Man, what's up with that?

What, your girl?

Yeah, my girl, I heard you heard you was tryin to talk to my girl
What's up

Nah, it ain't even like that, you know
If you was kickin stronger game
She wouldn't have to call me

Stronger game?
Yo, you was tryin +push up+ on my girl
I wanna know what's up with that

Once again - your girl?

Yeah

I think you better get the record straight, man

Ah
You said my girl was pushin up on you
Ain't too much to be pushin up on!

I mean that's true, you know
But you know you kickin that 'spin the globe' and all of that crazy stuff
She ain't with that

Aight, aight, aight
We ain't even gotta go into this
Hey, I'm confident in myself
I'm sure you're confident in yourself
We'll let her decide

Yeah, you know
We can let her decide over a nice candlelight dinner at my spot
Cause that's where she gon' be tonight

Oh heh - dinner
You better hope she can +make+ it to dinner after she had lunch with me

Oh yeah?

Yeah, word up

You lead it off, I end it off

Yeah alright, homie
You better check yourself 'fore you wreck yourself

Taking It to the Top,Rock the House,1987.0,"Now I'm the Fresh Prince, and if you got good sense
You'll keep your distance, because my sole intent
Is to rock and shock the spot and give my all, which is a lot
And no, I'm not about to stop because I'm takin it to the top

A whole lot of people rap, but what good is that
If the rap that they're rappin is way off track?
I don't mean to attack you, but I'm cuttin no slack
To those people that I hear saying meaningless raps
In actuality, I mean in reality
The words that you use are a mere formality
Vocabulary is not what it's about
The point that you're tryin to get across is what counts
Cause when a lot of rappers rap, they try to use big words
But that's the most absurd thing I've ever heard of
They think that that's impressive, but when will they learn their lesson
That it's not the words that count, it's the message
They get a lot of big words out of some magazine
And nine times out of ten they don't even know what they mean
They stand up on the stage, huffin and puffin
Rappin for nearly an hour, but they're not sayin nothin
Really but a lot of jibberish
And I know that they all wish
They had access to fresh rhymes like this
I came to rock and shock and give my all, which is a lot
And no, I'm not about to stop because I'm takin it to the top

Fresh rhymes and a razzamatazz
Smooth power and grace and mucho pizzazz
Good looks and charm and personality
You punch it in your calculator, and it adds up to me
I know the same goes for the rest of my crew
My deejay Jazzy Jeff and Ready Rock C too
The ultimate combination of strenght and prestige
My crew holds the key to fun and everything you need
To party all night, yes, it's you we will excite
The time is right, so don't fight it
Suckers, please don't bite it
We came to rock and shock and give our all, which is a lot
And no, we're not about to stop because we're takin it to the top

I really hate to brag about him
But when people doubt him
I have to stand up and tell the whole world all about him
'United we stand, divided we fall'
Is the moto of our crew and it's honored by all
Of us, we pledge allegiance to the work we rehearse
And it enables us always to come out first
We came to rock and shock and give our all, which is a lot
Yo Jeff, man, why don't you take it to the top?

We succeed everytime we attempt
To rock the house, you've got to dance cause no one is exempt
From the rules set forth by us, of course you know
Stay out our way or behold the brute force of
Me Jeff and Ready Rock C
We're a trio, oh, you didn't know? That means
That there's three of us, one for all and all for one
And we're takin it to the top before we get done
I'm inclined to rhyme, anytime you'll find
It ain't a rapper with a mind as impressive as mine
I insist on a rise and I despise a decline
On the day I descend, that's the day I resign
I'm creatin my trends and innovatin my rap
Why is that? I don't know, I guess I got it like that!
My personality extends beyond the realm of mediocre
My advice for life is, if you want somethin, go for it
Cause there's nothin that's beyond your grasp
Just set your mind to it, work hard, and you can have
Anything that you want, the sky is the limit
Stop lunchin around, get up and go get it
Cause I came a long way from the past till today

To introduce the Too Damn type posse to you

The undisputed, the greatest alive, my friend and my DJ, he's Jazzy Jeff
On a motorcycle is next 
He's my personal manager, he's the Hammer J.L
And when I got flack, you know he got my back
He punched a hole in the wall all the while he broke a mirror, he's Charlie Mack
Down by law at each and every show
Nicknamed ?Al Diesel? but for short Aldo
And when something goes wrong this is where we go
His favorite line is 'Excuse me, hops', he's  Polo
You met the crew and you know where we live
You met Omar, Money and my man Wiz

Higher Baby,Barcelona Gold,UnKnown,"On your mark get set and now go
A worldwide show
Now here's the intro
The torch is lit and now the gun is pointed
Prepare for the world's best to be anointed
On the field of dreams hopes and passion
Some will manifest while some get smashed in
To smithereens now who's the best team
POW!
There goes the gun now run
Out the blocks now who's the perpetrators
Time to zip through to the real gladiators
Your soul's possessed by Hercules
Barcelona's now ancient Rome
And there ain't no stopping no turning back
No giving up and no cutting slack
The spirit of Zeus is loose
Feel the fire
Taking us higher higher
Higher baby get up a little higher
Push a little harder a little bit faster
-Repeat-
Boom
In your face now take that
Get on track or ya best step back
Don't come here trying to moan and groan
If you ain't stone well then ya best go home
Oops watch out look out here comes another one
Bang
He wasn't quite ready son
Coming hard is a must
Cause you come soft you get crushed
This ain't no time nor place for the weak
Certain defeat meets the mob of a meet
A colosseum in streets it's the same
A battle to see who wears the gold chain
Win or lose it's how you play it they tell me
But you ask me I want the G-O-L-D
Three winners but my desire
Is to do a little lower and I'll be the one that's
Higher baby get up a little higher
Push a little harder a little bit faster
Michael Jordan
Get up a little higher
Scottie Pippen
Get up a little higher

Just Kickin’ It,Code Red,1993,"The F-L-Y guy
About to toss some action

Here I come again with a groove to move you
Somethin' kinda smooth, you can bop your head to
Chill it, the feel, you can play it anytime
It's smooth, is the groove, play it back behind the rhyme
So please, put a freeze, on hooving and hollering
Fans deserve more, for their hip-hop dollar, man
And I'm just the rapper to deliver
The rapper that can give a
Funky rhyme, flowing like a river
Silky, silky, kind to the ear
Diction perfect, rhymes all clear
Tempo moderate, this ain't no marathon
Step back, new jack's, observe the paragon
Uh? Who? What? Why? When?
Don't be looking around clown, that's right, I'm back again
With the dopeness, you're head is bopping isn't it?
Yeah I thought so. Yo, I'm just kickin' it

(Yeah...)
(Just kickin' it)
Yeah, Yeah
I'm just kickin' it!
(Just kickin' it)
Just watch me, y'all
I'm jus kickin it
(Just kickin' it)
Uh, yeah, yo, I'm just kickin it

Prepare for a voyage, just close your eyes
Who ain't ready, holler out; I
Well ain't nobody hollering, ‘cause all is perfect
The groove is a wave, and my rhyme's a surfing
The track design with a rhyme in mind
Bidi budup up up, the charts we'll climb
Every other rapper trying to get you to jump
But when you're all done jumpin', I'mma get you what you really want
Track by track displaying my ability
The man, FP, showing true dexterity
On the mic, no rules, I'm lawless
Wicked when I kick it and my rhymes are flawless
So sit back, relax and allow me to rock ya
With a hit that you're gonna get mentally locked to
A hip hop solid, an all pro flower
I throw stuff together better than Noah
A cut, to kick it to, kind to the ear drum
All true poetry, from me you'll be hearin' some
So extra, extra, read all about it
I'm slapping the hell out of those that doubt it
I'm rippin' every city I been in
Coast to coast, not to boast, but I'm winning
My fans are powerful, and that's the way I'm living
All without effort y'all
Yo, I'm just kickin' it!

Uh (Just kickin' it)
Yeah, yeah, I'm just kickin' it
(Just kickin' it)
Come on! Come on, I'm just kickin' it
(Just kickin' it)
Yo, I'm just kickin it'
(Just kickin' it)

Let's take a trip, mellow out while I'm rappin'
Your mind is the boat and my rhyme's the captain
So hoist a sail, and it's time to flow
To a place that other rap boats don't go
Welcome, welcome, into my territory
Everybody get on up, and get busy for me
Heads are boppin hard and fast
And now I'm getting' sued ‘cause my groove caused whiplash
Every time I rhyme I try to
Say something smooth, that'll move inside you
The way that you should feel when you hear a real rap
Is trapped in the rhyme and your climbing to the climax
A lyrical painter, the Fresh Prince
And y'all in awe of my Picasso essence
Musical passion, lovely isn't?
But it ain't nothing to it
Yo, I'm just kickin it

(Just kickin' it)
Just check me, check me, just kickin it
(Just kickin' it)
Like Pronto y'all, I'm just kickin' it
(Just kickin' it)
Uh, uh, I'm just kickin' it
(Just kickin' it)
Yo, I'm out

Brothers always screaming about keeping it real
Don't get no realer than the mic with your boy on the wheels
True dat yall can run but you can't escape he like a
Man with a super S on his cape

Based on chemistry
No need for sensing me
Your hennisee
Top dogs from the hood
Popping back to the hood
I hate to brag but damn I'm good
Yo Jeff it's been a minute since me and you ripped
But some of the ol diehards might have thinked that you flipped

Dance Or Die,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Hit man)
Yeah
Let's take a trip try to grip the fantasy
And I'm a get you hip to how dangerous dance can be
Seem kind a crazy when I check it in hindsight
I went crazy berserk kind a jeckyl and hyde like
Two years ago I went on a rampage
I slipped lost grip started ripping the dance stage
People around me my head kind a wizzing
What a dilemma and underground wizard (hit man)
Heard the sound of music and I opened my eyes up
Theirs people all around me so yo I better rise up
A couple of guys grabbed me and he said to me lets go
You're the new wardon of the wall flower death row
New row a what do who do wo dippide oop da da hoop who the hell are you
They told me who they were buttold me what my new job was
I thought for a second and said yea that's kind a fly cuz
So to you people that just holding the walls up
You're messing up the party and when I'm getting called up
You better get your butt to the floor with the quickness
Or let the crowd bear witness
(you are dead) (hit man)
Now I came doing my thing in the underground
I wear all black I'm sort of like a vampire now
I don't eat or sleep and I don't like light
I just hunt wall flowers I'm a man of the night
I walk through the club with a gun and a blackjack
My cap around backwards party hats on my back pack
I always try to keep a look out for the party sleeper
And when I peep a sleeper then I'm the grim reaper
In to the bottomless pit they keep plungin
Down with the other clowns deep in my dungeon
And homie if I harm ya its for your behaviour
No knight in shining armour is coming to save ya
You can't get away but yo you try to run son
You doing the electric boogaloo with my stun gun
Then you go to solitary lonely and tied up
And plus from the stun gun your arm all fried up
Somebody said my power went to my head a bit
I wish that I could find the brother sucker that said the
I wanna torch em up punish them through the night
Put em in the dungeon with a tape of vanilla ice
I'm in control like Janet
Ya can't stand it
I'm figgida like a fire don't fan it
The mind of a mad man seen through the windows of my eyes
Dance or die
(you are)
(dead)
(hit man)
You don't wanna dance you just wanna cool out cat
Well come into the club and it's a straight up death trap
Cause I'm a mad scientist chillins a no no
Psycho socio straight up loco
Taking the life of any sucker that stand around
I spot em in the corner chillin then I'm a lay em down
So call the ambulance to come and just take em away
Ah forget get a hearse we d o a
An eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth
A buckshot for a booty than ain't getting loose
A straight up outlaw a cold blooded villain
A point blank killin for suckers thats chillin
Cause I don't stand for chillin on my dancefloor
If you ain't dancin then I'm Charles Manson
Coming with the death squad to through your behind out
If you ain't movin jumpin or grrovin I'm pulling my nine out
Right up in the club I'll put you to death
And while the guns still smokin I'm a dance on your chest
The prince of the party pushing with the power
Dance till nine or death till the wallflower
Louder and louder the crowd keep chantin
Pointing at the booty caught who ain't dancin
So like the terminator now it's up to me
Asta la vista baby

Keeps going and going it ain't funny going and going just like an energiser bunny
Faster faster who's the master

Mirror mirror on the wall now who is the top choice of them all
Well I know that its me I just thought id ask
Cause if you said it wasn't me then you can kiss my behind
Ride em cowboy
Mic like a bronco but I won't let go
Heads are boppin knees are flying
Arms are swingin ears are ringin
That's what a real house party should be like 2 turntables a mic and a blue light
One fan blowing windows open
Crowd feels high cause the rhymes are dope an
But I don't stop though
They riding my jock so hard
I'm thinking my nads getting scarred
You walk through the door
Get right to the floor
Cause that's what you came here for
Come on check it
Get hyped get hyped to the groove it goes on

When to Stand Up,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(scratched) (3X):
""No...you hear me! You go to hell"" -> Mr. Garrison

Yo
At birth I was born with the biggest middle finger on earth
The first time I went to stick it up the shit hurt
Mom couldn't take me, the bitch still hates me
Shit, one day she said, ""Go rake leaves,"" I said, ""Make me!""
I'm proud to announce I'm probably the first kid
Who was kicked out of his house for making fart sounds with his mouth
Arguing with me and mom was on-going
She called the law enforcement when I broke the lawn mower
The slut gave me a truck when I turned sixteen
I went to start it and it screamed, ""Please fix me!""
Back then, when Will Smith was still the Fresh Prince
And him and Jeff were still best friends, I guess then's
When I decided to cut class to rap full time
And get the fuck outta this fake ass school and rhyme
So anybody who thinks this fuckin attitude is a gimmick
Come and see me, see if I don't live up to this image
You fucking prick!
(scratched) (4X):
""No...you hear me! You go to hell!""

Yo, y'all rappers have never learned
That's why I'm fuckin wit y'all
Run around telling niggas they can fuck wit Parl
I bring it to your high school, smoke the prom
Put your brother in a headlock, choke your mom
Cause any horror like a play off loss in game seven
Walk around ripping on niggas madder than James Evans
My left hand's sharp it moves freestyle ultra
Slap my dick like Kool Keith
Fuck like you stole from me, and rules the streets
I don't wanna have to fuck you up, so cool cease
Parl Yams be the chosen thug
What I spit be cold juice like a frozen hug
Run the streets while you're stuck at home
My temper like Bushwick Bill, bitch leave me the fuck alone
I've been jealous since niggas was windmillin'
These cats just started to rhyme, my pen's spillin'
Your moms just told me to act, I've been wheelin'
So boy just slow your deck, i've been stealin'
I wet rappers cause it's me and Em
I guess I just ain't give a fuck like Eminem
Burglarize take busts with the slugs
Come in your window like Bruh Man and bustin' your club
Put the heat up I teach them niggas what to suck
And my young lords, when to stand up and light the Dutch
(scratched) (4X):
""No...you hear me! You go to hell!""

I came to my last show on a horse swingin' a lasso
Drunk with the asshole ripped out of an old bathrobe
Cause I don't give a fuck, you better understand that
Two Xanax, and I give a fuck what I SoundScan at
Fuck Billboard, drugs is what I kill for
I'm Happy Gilmore, just slip me anything in pill form
I may mingle but I plan to stay single
Play bingo and drink, get old and watch my face wrinkle
Sike, I'm 24 Thursday; six more birthdays
And I'm blowin my brains out when I'm thirty
As long as my heart beats I'mma keep tryin to see
How much speed I can eat before I fall the fuck asleep
So ""I'm the Rapper, He's the DJ""
I'm the one that's got your six year old nephew screaming ""F-U-C-K""
So Jeff, give me a scratch (scratched: ""No!"")
The rest of y'all can kiss my ass 'til your lips stick to my pants

All I Know,The Return of the Magnificent,UnKnown,"I make it move like I wanna move with them horns
Let 'em play with them strings
While I spit the life of kings
Put a could in it
Stood with it, we at it
Dudes that was meant to have it
Fans wanna reach out and grab it
I'm just an ordinary man
With an un-ordinary lifestyle
Seen early, I would live as a child
I was conceived a mistake
But through God was really all it take for me to be born
And make the earth shake
This was raised from the bottom
So before them plain cones got 'em
Soak up the four square miles to pop 'em
It's me in the flesh
Here to put the rumours to rest
And let you celebrate hip hop's best
From the womb to the tomb
Hit the game real soon
With a tune that's gonn' take sun
Straight to the moon
Taddau
See it's my turn now
All competitors bow
All you sayin' is ""WOW""

All I know
It's the way it gotta go
And everything you take to hold me down
All I see
It's the way it gotta be
If you came to see me hit the town
This is my vibe
The way I survive
And peoples can't play me out of bounds
Here's my point
On the Jazzy Jeff joint
That's why C.L. can wear the crown

When you think about the pedigree
I own the whole catalog
All I'm sayin' is
Don't sleep on me dawg
I really waked them streets there
Schooled them young wolves
C.L. will slay anything in his way
Okay it's all about the aura I project
That ultimate connect
And how you see me as a man of respect, right
So it's like a mutual agreement
All your feed is in the seamon
Learn the rules
Let you earn your pay sure
Knows of when you think of what it cost me
And how the world forced me to kill 'em softly baby
How the music sound from the basement
And how the world blessed me
Who let you see the fame don't impress me, dig it
Why it's cut from a different cloth
Blood it, set it off
Keep a real nice piece of the love easy
Anytime you can hold ya head
Then you can hold some bread
And relate to what C.L. said
Yes....


It's Jazzy Jeff on the turntables
C.L. on the M-I-C
Philly on up to the N.Y.C
And breakdances, God
Tags in the trainyard
Wild style fat laced
Thugs locked up
From a 1980's case
Goons with them grown kids
Used to them long bids
Meet you on the dance floor
Slash the visit then
A lot from the rep to
And seein' it all makes sense
If I'm the king
Then that should make you the fresh prince
Send for the driver
You lookin' at the real soul survivor
Like my man J. Period
Mix tape
The man on fire
Featuring the guested Jeff host
You marvel at the up close and personal
Meetin' other minds
You should read the signs
This is what reclines
The thoughts in my lazy boy
Fit like a hand and glove

Practice,The Return of the Magnificent,UnKnown,"We just talkin' about practice...
We sittin' here, I'se supposed to be the franchise player
And we in here talkin' about practice...
I mean, listen, we talkin' about practice...
Not a game, not a game, not a game; we talkin' about practice!
Not a game, not a, not, not the game that I go out there and die for...

Yo
I heard those who can't, teach, well fuck it
I guess class dismissed, I can't teach you shit
I've been doin this for years, man, my rep is legit
It's like a mic is a cancer-stick, I can't quit
But I can kick that measuring stick to
Let you know real quick whether you can or can't spit
And from the sound of it, you on a stage
Is like a square in a triangle hole: it don't fit
I mean, the whole way you tryin to hold the mic
I ain't tryin to be a smart aleck, but you sound like a dick
It shouldn't be so phallic, you wanna be hard
But you can't come correct, I would've show you how it's done
If you showed some respect, instead what you doin is
Showin you're new in this; why you pursuin this
Skill trade and tryin to get paid and laid?
Before the groupies and the guap, man, the fact is
It takes practice


I heard it's better to be lucky than good
Well, in my case I guess I'm lucky I'm good
I heard if not for bad luck, J would have no luck at all
To which my reply is, ""Fuck all of y'all""
I've been passed up, gassed up, bounced around, man
Thrown off the glass just to see what sticks
I have yet to score big like Allen Iverson
Maybe someday J could endorse a pair of kicks
But for now long as I can afford a pair of kicks
And a closet to put em in, Ima put em on
And walk these dogs, get my hustle on
Break bread for my younguns so they grow up strong
That's why the flow grow after each and every show
And year after year bring song after song
I heard amateurs keep doin it til they get it right
But pros do it so much, we can't get a bone


I heard some old colloquialism
Statin that if you love what you do for a livin
You never work a day in your life—yeah right
But I know what they mean, some jobs'll trap you like prison
But if you hatin me, cuz all you do is process and foul
Jealous cuz I get to make beats, spin and freestyle
As if I haven't had to work in a while
Like I ain't sheddin blood, sweat, tears, stomach acid and bile
Like my workload isn't unbelievable:
CEO, COO, accounts payable
And receivable; chief marketeer and manager
Sales rep, tour van driver, baggage handler
Shiiit, like I ain't tryin to outsource and delegate
How else you think I'll ever upgrade and elevate?
But at this point in time, I got two options:
Get it done right myself or get relegated
Back to a spot where I do it for fun
In my spare time—on but wait, I won't have none
So don't come at me bout that get a real jobby job
We gonna have a problem, see, this ain't a hobby
This is practice",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-practice-lyrics
Foe Da Love of Da Game,The Magnificent,2002,"{*scratchin': Represent for hip hop not for rap*}

I got love for the game that's why I'm rhyming always stay in the booth
Never lying to the people always telling the truth
I feel the bass in my chest give power to songs
Girl ripping when I'm home about the hours I'm gone
I can't help it the studio where paul be at
Tried to walk away from it but it called me back
Forget my pride shit I even quit my job
For the one that I love to work music
Recognised by my art that I spill in my game
Pour my heart on the track and have you feeling my pain
Seen a lot of hard times on the way to success
When I'm mad writing a rhyme is my way to express
Lay back and fall deep in a verse
If I was out in the street yo I probably lay a sleep in a hearse
There's nothing like when you on a mic tearing a track
Then you come from out the booth and start hearing it back
Everybody their love the sound that's why they give you hugs and pounds
Now you know you was spittin it
You got the whole run vibing the same
You ain't doing this for dollars and chains
You got love for the game

Love what you do
And do what you Love (for the game)
*Represent for hip hop not for rap yo*
Love what you do
And do what you Love (for the game)
*Represent for hip hop not for rap*

Yo I'm feeling you yams do the same thing yo
For the love of the game
I only deal with dollars and change
Switch places from big faces one in the same
With Snares and kicks prepared to mix
In the both till I'm dead
No roof on my head
Even tools in the shed
Got a place to stay
But a place to lay?
That's what I deal with on a day to day
Phone off heat off loan sharks spaghetti no meat balls
At least yall can eat y'all
Feel my strain on a cloudy feel my rain
No food no drink just hunger pains
Thinkin everyday who this chrome 'gone kill
Smile in women face for a home cooked meal
Right now I hate my life
But love the way I write
For real I think I seen my death
Think I like bumming cheese from Jeff?
Pockets of my jeans on e and they seems on f
I'm a hard working all nighter ASCAP SESAC
Song writer worldwide weedhead bong lighta (lp version)
Feel my blood and tears
But my love is the drug that got me loved and revered from thugs for years
It's the game yo

Love what you do
And do what you Love (for the game)
*Represent for hip hop and not for rap yo*
Love what you do
And do what you Love (for the game)
*Represent for hip hop and not for rap*

Yo blak it seem like we both feeling the same
Remember when I walked away and you were still in the game? (uh ha)
That shit was hot I'm still feeling the flame
Plus you never forgot every other verse spilling my name

Chilling with dames to will they range killin their brain with game
If not cousin I be still on the train
Like you said we ain't willing to change
I'm feeling you maing
Damn see family and we...

...Stick together
Shows overseas spit together
No doubt for the love of the game
We gonna keep staying the same
When you not around laying your dame
Getting paper from a play in a lane
Keep heat for any hater wanna test the rap
And even more on the wax so sat jeff is phat

I attest to that
Still walk with dressroom back
Same ghetto
Same whip
Still stressed on wack
Just wanna back yall nothin less than that
Just want some cash cars and them records with blak
It's just a game yo
But whether or not
I still got love for hip hop
It's the game

Rock with you
Amazed to find someone so fine
Up in here I'm gonna feel I'm 'bout to lose my mind
Just gonna spend the evening with my crew
Had no idea I'd run into the likes of you
The dance floor is so t-t-tight
Somewhat like the way my hands grip on your theighs tonight
Only one to turn a thing around
Girl I like the way that sound

But if it does I wanna know when can it start again

On the field of dreams hopes and passion
Some will manifest while some get smashed in
To smitherines now who's the best team

Oops watch out look out here comes another one

Coming hard is a must

Certain defeat meets the mob of a meet
A coliseum or in streets it's the same
A battle to see who wears the gold chain

Verse 1 (Eshon Burgundy)
South Philly some time in the late 80's
Really but not really driving the hood crazy
Bangin' my music loud when my momma not around
No consideration for the neighbors, I ain't turn it down
Only thing I turned down was the job from my cousin when asked me if I wanna slang ‘caine
Nothing could make me do that although some feel like they have to, I ain't mad at you for what you believe
But me, I could never kill my own folks
My own heads told that there was no future in dealin' dope
If it is 
Texas like Houston on our phones
Let us know if it is if it ain't, leave it alone
Take that rubber off the wheels of steel we see that cone
Same thing when that gun is revealed you see that chrome
Mother fear of the son that get killed she be alone
So she keep praying for him and hoping they bring him home for those..
CHORUS:
Verse 2 (Black Ice)
Aye Jeff remember that track?
The one that had that clap?
Similar to the sound of the gat
Busted after the party
Everybody running, ducking from the melee
Studio west fresh fest you was the Dj?
You seen it all go down from behind the turntables
The grind and coke fables and niggas snatchin' cables
To chicks that just wanted to be down with the music man
Play the music man Jeff you the magnificent
Infinite in the hood before coke was top stock
Saturday cut the streets off Jeff about to rock the block
Give us all what we been fiending for
A meaning for life a little break from this constant strife we living in
Let it spin homie I present the one and only
Transformers scratch top contender of the phonograph
Sometimes I wanna' laugh at how long you've been in it
And never waiting for murder to go and wreck it just spin it
CHORUS:
Verse 3 (Eshon Burgundy & Black Ice)
Yeah we Philly boys
We grew up in the streets
Comrades blew trees like Illinois
We may be brocheech just to fill a void
Listenin' to Jeff and Fresh P when they called it noise
The streets called it a Voice
The industry called it a Grammy
We call it a choice
Now call it the way we've been doin' it from that day
Now it's not 1 MC but 2 and a DJ
And I live for my people
And I die for my people
I got a pair of top 10's and a P-Coat
And I'm from Philly no doubt I rep the East Coast
And I live for my people
And I die for my people
I got a pair of top 10's and a P-Coat

And the host is the brother with the groovin' sound
Is you down with that?
I hope you down with that
Now is you down with that?
I hope you down with that
Now is you down with that?
I hope you down with that
Now is you down with that?

For Da Love of Da Game,The Magnificent,2002,"I got love for the game
That's why i'm rhyming and always stay in the booth
Never lying to the people, always telling the truth
I feel the bass in my chest
It gives power to songs
Girl rippin' when i'm home about the hours i'm gone
I can't help it
The studio where Paul be at
I tried to walk away from it but it called me back
I give out pride, shit i even quit my job
For the one that i love to work
Music
Recognized by my heart as the skill of the game
Pour my heart on a track and have you feeling my pain
I've seen alot of hard times on the way to success
When i'm mad, writing a rhyme is my way to express
Lay back and fall deep in a verse
If i was out in the sreet (yo), i'd probably lay sleep in a hearse
There's nothing like when you on the mic tearin' a track
And you come from out the booth and start hearing it back
Everybody there loves the sound (lovin' it)
That's why they give you hugs and pounds
Now you know you were spittin' this
You got the whole room vybing the same
You ain't doing the for watches and chains
You got love for the game
Love what you do and do what you love
Love what you do and do what you love
For the love of the game
I only deal with dollars and change
Switch places from big faces one in the same
With Snares and kicks prepared to mix
In the both till I'm dead
No roof on my head
Even tools in the shed
Got a place to stay
But a place to lay?
That's what I deal with on a day to day
Phone off heat off loan sharks spaghetti no meat balls
At least yall can eat y'all
Feel my strain on a cloudy feel my rain
No food no drink just hunger pains
Thinkin everyday who this chrome 'gone kill
Smile in women face for a home cooked meal
Right now I hate my life
But love the way I write
For real I think I seen my death
Think I like bumming cheese from Jeff?
Pockets of my jeans on e and they seems on f
I'm a hard working all nighter ASCAP sesac song writer worldwide weedhead bong lighta (lp version)
Feel my blood and tears
But my love is the drug that got me loved and revered from thugs for years
It's the game yo
Last verse © Baby Blak
Love what you do and do what you love
Love what you do and do what you love
Yo Blak it seems like we both feeling the same
Remember when i walked away and you were still in the game? (uh huh)
That shit was hot, i'm still feeling the flames
Plus you never forgot
Every other verse spillin' my name
Chillin' with dames to will they range killing their brain with game
If not cousin i be still in the train
Like you said, we ain't willing to change
I'm feeling you man
Yams see family and we
Stick together
Shows overseas spit together
No doubt for the love of the game
We gonna keep staying the same
When you're not around laying your dame
Getting paper from a play in the lane
Keep heat for any hater that wanna test the rap
And even more on the wax so that Jeff could scratch
I atest to that
Still walk on (?) on back
Same ghetto, same whip, still stressed on crack
Just wanna back y'all
Nothin' less than that
Just want some cash cars and some records with Blak
It's just a game yo
And whether or not
I still got love for hip-hop
It's the game yo
Love what you do and do what you love
Love what you do and do what you love",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-for-da-love-of-da-game-lyrics
Shake It Off,The Magnificent,2002,"When I got a lot of stress I wanna shake it off
It get too tight I wanna shake it off
When I get stress I need to shake it off
I wanna couple (?) so I could shake it off
Go to the strip club and let them shake it off
Get some chicken and get it shaken all off
Shake it off
Party people grab your chains (c'mon)
We 'bout to move to it
Shackles on your feet got you front and cool to it
Loosen up do your thing ain't no rules to it
Just do it
Needle and the groove to it
Nothin' to prove to it
Stress to lose to it
You know how we do it representing Touch of Jazz
Put your backfield in motion
Shake it fast all out full speed like a hundred yard dash
Blow some steam off
Get your scream off
Turn your depressed and your stress and your mean off
Dry hump and get your thing off
Don't just stand there look and make sure it seems lost
Turn the machine off report to the cockpit
Start the countdown we bout to blast off like a rocket
It's the show shock
8 ball corner pocket
Wop it, pop it, lock it but don't stop it
Monkey on your back (shake it off)
Stress and problems in life (shake 'em off)
Beef with husband or wife (shake it off)
Bad karma (shake it off)
C'mon (shake-shake-shake it off)
Bills and debts (shake 'em off)
Somebody pissed you off (shake it off)
If your clothes too tight (shake 'em off)
If only fun tonight (shake-shake-shake it off)
The momentum can't be stopped once the show done dropped
This will make the crowd move like we bust a shot
Like you in the water and we yell ""shark""
Jumpin' like you barefoot and the dance floor hot
We don't want problems
We want physical activity
Don't pretend to be dumb dance no penalty
No anal retemptive tendencies
Like half dead in penatintury
Fuckin' up chemistry
Peaceful  assembly be knocking like 5.0
Got my engine revved up like a motorcycle
Ohhhh
And grab my nuts like (Michael)
Chef Word trigger man Cam'ron got the nitro
C'mon revv the Tyco
Get your ticket
All aboard
All party people get that ass on the floor
I wanna hear you scream like your team just scored
Or like your getting beat with an extension cord
Monkey on your back (shake it off)
Stress and problems in life (shake 'em off)
Beef with husband or wife (shake it off)
Bad karma (shake it off)
C'mon (shake-shake-shake it off)
Bills and debts (shake 'em off)
Somebody pissed you off (shake it off)
If your clothes too tight (shake 'em off)
If only fun tonight (shake-shake-shake it off)
Let's get it crackin' like chapped lips
All the ladies say ""oooowww"" like you bumpin' in the cactus
Act like you know cause you're an actress
Back that thing up like you know what the attraction is
Go and be freaky with it
Make 'em wanna get it
Make 'em wanna hit it
Ah you done did it
Now you gonna get it
Get you home alone with it
Know that you like your meat with the bone in it
Fellas get Romey Rome with it
Break it down hookers
Drop it like it's hot bounce it off the ground
Jump up cross your legs come down spin around
Slide to the left and the right like James Brown
Ahh we cookin' now
Chef Word in the kitchen now
Time to dance
So quit bitchin' now
Girls dancin' with girls switch hittin' now
East coast west coast midwest dirty south
Monkey on your back (shake it off)
Stress and problems in life (shake 'em off)
Beef with husband or wife (shake it off)
Bad karma (shake it off)
C'mon (shake-shake-shake it off)
Bills and debts (shake 'em off)
Somebody pissed you off (shake it off)
If your clothes too tight (shake 'em off)
If only fun tonight (shake-shake-shake it off)

Go See The Doctor 2K7,The Return of the Magnificent,UnKnown," 
Hello Doc? Yeah, I don't mean me...I go this friend...and um, I'm callin' on his behalf cause he was kinda embarrassed like, what would he do if he went to use the bathroom and he felt like, a burning sensation? Naah, I'm not talkin' about me...I'm callin' for him. Aiight you got me...

I got a secret, I'mma let you in
It's cool you might laugh, I'mma let you grin
I'mma let you say what you say, at the end of the day
I learned from it so I'm okay (okay!)
I had a date with Lisa dawg
And this girl was sushi cause she was raw
And when that ass passed all you could say was ""aaaah""
She was a good girl too, can do no wrong
Till one day we was sippin' an island long
Tequila in it so you know what I was on
My eyes was on
Her ass and thong
Like osteoporosis I'm tryin' to bone
I'm like, ""Hey good lookin', what you got cookin'?""
Got on hard and stuck my dook in
Round one, round two like boxer's cuz
Except I wasn't wearing no boxin' gloves
It feel good, so far though
She was Lucy and I was Ricky Ricardo
It felt great when penetratin'
Three days later I felt this sensation like

It wasn't worth it to me, now it hurts when I pee
When I pee ""I'm burn- I'm burnin' up""
Man I ain't lyin' shit, it feel like I shoot fire from my dick
""I'm burn- I'm burnin' up""
It's so hot (hot, hot, hot)
""I'm burn- I'm burnin' up
Man that girl was proper, man I had to pop her
Three days later, go see the doctor

Shit, I ain't the only one, y'all know too
Crazy situations we all go through
My nigga T.P. call him ""Pretty Ricky""
He was just tellin' me he crushed some cold thing, man
He didn't give me all the details
?? so deep with it it even had sea shells
I'm like ""Whoa for real?""
That girl must've dove for real
He said just last night
He swears that he waxed that ass right
Said that the sex so good it could give the blind sight
Make the deaf hear, make my mind speak
I'm like, ""That's deep, she a bonified freak.""
He said, ""Yeah I put it on her, you know me dawg
I took a win for the team she's a trophy dawg.""
Dawg, he party with her like he's in Vegas
Got a call from him three days later when he's said...


Havin' sex is like a hustle on the corner
One day you might be a goner
Mess up your life you can't get a loner
So you can play Russian Roulette if you wanna
But you grown, you gon' do what you gonna
Do anyway, I'm just tryin' to warn ya
Before sex, put protection on ya
Or get fired up, burnin' hot like a sauna",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-go-see-the-doctor-2k7-lyrics
Mystery Man,The Magnificent,2002,"Bounce wit me y'all (LE)
Bounce wit em y'all
Now check it
Who get it live when the party dies down
Mysterious man showing up in your town
Lyrics like lightning, vocals like thunder
Neighborhood success or the overnight wonder
Uh, precise on mics but nice with the toe-to-toe
A roll big flow, shows out in Kosovo
Between flows and chasing them hoes
I make the crowd get down like its supposed to go
Get down year round glad to see y'all came
In the summertime banging at the b-ball came
In the wintertime kickin rhymes up at my block
With an L in one hand and a cup of hot chocolate
A man for all seasons damn I'm raw even
We set the bar high everybody start reaching, cause....
(chorus)
Who said I couldn't get it down like this
Some tried to get it but they got it like this
Put you in a mix, get your body the twist
Its the mystery man, that the fans can't resist
Six sold M-K-T playin the corner
Ice cold Colt 45, not Corona
Get down see me on the prowl now I'm gonna
Holla at this fine young girl named Sherona
See, morons stalk, I walk right up on her
And make her heart race like the Dodge Daytona
Tired of the neighborhood guys ""hey hold up""
How's she get that good lovin feeling when I show up
Down and ride wit me, don't forget me when you blow up
How you gonna walk away from this, sis slow up
The head games is over ma I'm for real
Your ain't Oprah and I'm not Dr.Phil
Despite your size and them serious thighs
The long eyelashes and mysterious eyes
It don't pay to stay away from mysterious guys
That get the girls on the floor and keep the party alive, cause yo.....
Chorus (x2)
Now if I wanted I could pump it in every club this week
But I pass cause it only adds to my mystique
If ya think that I'm weak then catch me out in the street
It ain't nothing to show me homie man we got this heat
That nigga that got all y'all waitin
To get off the wall and get the bar room shakin
I came to but the party under a rest
And if they like it in the hood, let it pump in the jets
Mystery man, never take my mask off
But when it comes to the raps I can act y'all
Non-stop flow that might flood the dance hall
Peace I'm out, be easy I get at y'all

Yo, Jeff
Where the Fresh at?

(Verse 1)
Who is it?
That black nigga that they call Fess
With the city on the back and the world on my chest
You girls know my nest, this the best of the best
Motherfuckers can't breathe when I'm standin' on they neck
Niggas can't get paid, I got my hands on they check
When down south is right, then I wanna go (Left)
I ain't talkin' bout them dope boys or niggas in trap
Outkast and T.I. cause 'em dudes can rap (Ay, ay, ay)
But the hood that had enough
See my niggas in cuffs
Take to XXL and step your rap game up
I realize that the words that I say
Can build cowards
And you down, buttin' around, so your momma raised a coward
This the last hour
After (???) shower
Radio to pass out, drunk off of they own power, like
Hitler, Saddam, George Bush and Caesar
But if you don't care to fuck it, I don't either
Uh
Any track I moved on, get bruised on
Fuck a pepperoni, what you want on your Tombstone
You powerless
Like a werewolf when the moon's on
It's like havin' a high power with no iTunes song
You empty
Please don't tempt me
I feel no symphy
I'm so hot, missiles can sense me
Niggas diein' everyday, it don't make sense, G
Droppin' off of poverty
Jealousy, envy
Rhyme and Jeff
East coast, midwest
And look
It's Fess and Jeff

(Verse 2)
Now I suggest, you take a rest, 'fore I put one in your chest
It would move you and lose you
Don't need to think about
Taking me lightly
Your girlfriend licked and liked me
(???) callin' on wifey
A conscious rapper, I just might be
I don't smoke
Or drink or find hoes, this my Miami Vice, G
Niggas in the Bay, calling me hyphy
Philly cats say I'm a (???), my (???) was sheisty
People eyes is shifty, they smile so nicely
Niggas walk behind my back and shake my hand politely (Hey)
Man, you almost made me think that you liked me
I turned around
You did the wrong thing, I'm like, ""God damn, Spike Lee!""
And even though my neck ain't icey
You dudes in my hair is Pisces
The jewels at my labels, they like me
Chicago know that I'm tight, G
West coast support Fess, down south hype me
Niggas in New York
You can set yourself on fire
They be like, ""Ah, son, he alright, B""
I think they mean they like me
Oh I Think They Like Me
Oh I, oh I, Oh I Think They Like Me
See
Jeff's the DJ
I'm the emcee
I grab the mic, he punch the MPC
It's like '88
I'll play Will
He's The DJ, I'm The Rapper, look
I got skills

2006, the year of the real rapper

All right, stop
Think for a moment, okay
That the shit ain't fun, no radio play
You need to sell
A hundred thousand, make a million, hit the road and be straight
Or bet your money in some overlous state
And we can get this tape
Cut this green
Roll up in a cutlass clean
This must be green, I must be seen
Next time that I step on the set, just know
Who is it

Get my glass you can fill it to the rim with the realest and
I'm talkin back when Biggie Smalls was the illest
And the boys from Cypress Hill said how I could just kill a man

Already knowin how we go, Let's get at your people
I'm flowin these streets know, I hold it down
And for the channel, The G code Jeff
Just let the peeps know I'm reppin the east coast, So hold it now

Until my niggas get room enough to breath
I'mma break down the leaf, My brotha crush the weed
Not Puff Daddy, No boy I puff the trees
In a room full of crackers I might cut the cheese
They called me Mr., I got what you need
And a bag of sour dezz, You ain't gotta pluck the seeds naw
So hit the peddle, I'll bring you up to speed
Nearly smashed up to beamer, No more cognac for me
See I'm in my backyard still cleanin
All the fiends still fiendin, Better deal with the demons and
I'm just bein rash, I'm like what's the meanin
Cause as far as MCin I ain't likin what I'm seein man
Nah, So M-E-F's on some other shit
Feel it like that first piece of pussy, Fell in love with it

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Listen this is not a game
No balls foul
It took me a lifetime just to hunt you down
Your beautiful smile
And the way you keep me around
Has got me changin' how I do to
What can I do now?
It's your option
Picked like Malone and Stockton
Don't stop it
Everything you do is love
It's like everytime you move it's bugged
I got somethin' that'll change your life if you choose this love

'Cause girl I like your style
The way you move and the way you smile
Had to sit you down so we could talk a while
To see what's on your mind
But before I let you in
I'll take you places you never been
The type of shit you go back and tell your friends
I had to check your profile
That's how I do

(?) not smooth with it
I'm diggin' you but I'm tryin' to stay cool with it
Miss you too cute with it
Attitude rude with it
You get it
There's somethin' 'bout the way you move in it
Lookin' like you need love
And I'm feelin' like doin' you a favor
The pleasure is mine
You leave them other lanes behind
I'll give you some time
Let you make up your mind
It's your move now
Take a minute I'm a cool out
It's nothin' but a thing say the word we cruise out (c'mon)
You and me
Yo we can do things
You outta state pack your bags we could move things
I'm talkin' 'bout movin' more than just a few things
The car the crib
Baby you can choose things
You with my last name real nice cute rings
I ain't Shawn baby love this is how we do things
This is how (how I do)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

The Garden,The Return of the Magnificent,UnKnown,"You ain't lookin in the mouth of maddness
Kid your facin it
Put your game face on and start embracin it
I'm from the streets that first started all
That hatin shit
And n***az used to spell ghetto with the ""h"" in it
You see the innocent children, from 10 in the building
Get that menacin feelin, but when it's revealed
A 16's just an enterprise you pretend to ride
It seems it's been applied, it's a snoop genocide
N****z ain't showin that they skills is there
N****z ain't tryna build careers
When them guns start to bust and you ain't real prepared
Now your rhymes just a souvenir, from a killed career
Understand I do a lot of renovating myself
Kane ain't never been known for limits breaking my ""self""
Club, shootin thug shit, innovatin myself
But you'll never catch the God incriminating my ""self""

Chorus:
Unto God and to Hip Hop yo we stay true
And always remember just what a snake do
Watch those around you cuz they'll be fake too
And never let the game make you
Most of all
Unto God and to Hip Hop stay in circle
There's a lot to see beneath where the dirt is
Dig a little deeper and scratch the surface
Maybe then you'll understand your purpose
Now reflecting on the game kid
I have to say
Much love to the one Jam Master Jay
A loss that hit the world of hip hop like John Lennon
Chapter out of life that prevailed the wrong inning
Still from the Notorious, hearts are shooken
Streets started lookin like we missed a part of Brooklynn
A disappointing flavor that we taste before
But a spots been secured for the late Shakur
The pain was severe when we lost the lid
We try to get by, then turn around and lost Left Eye
We even see how fatal diseases be
Snatchin playaz like Eazy-E, easily
Respect to Freaky Tah, Big L and Big Pun
The big one, who left the Terror Squad forever scarred
Your lifestyle and your musical gift, in the hearts of many
You will truly be missed

I never claimed to be the kid slangin rocks for Ex
Never claimed to be the kid that be poppin the teks
But if you look its like my name got stock in the jets
That ain't my style though, I simply not wish to flex
But if you want we can sit and talk dollars and checks
And good investments, and what follows it next
You sittin there lookin product and vexed
Tryna screwface, dudes Im tryna face
Go the opposite sex
Take a glass of the Remy, start with the Ex
I never had patron but shit I'll take a shot of it next",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-the-garden-lyrics
My People,The Magnificent,2002,"I've seen streets we're youth are forced to take the long way home
And I've seen mothers mourn the loss of there only born
Still I believe we are given nothin more than we can beg
A vision is only blurred when life seems unfair
Who am I to judge the man with the needle in his veins
When hes just chasing freedom to escape the pain
Of the worlds fastpaced pipedreams and shortcomings
Hes just trying to make do and find a way out of nothing
Its like we damned if we do and damned if we don't
And it's a very thin line between respect and being broke
And being one red button away from world war three
Always called the minority
And always always pulled over
Facing police brutality
Why is every street a living hell
Probably cause they want us to fail
Yeah three strikes and surely back to jail
Like the slave ships when they sail
Years and years of civil rights chasing to pass that bill
But ask yourself people have we changed or are we standing still
Down and out struggling
In this concrete jungle
One check away from starvation, poverty
But they say being free is about speaking your mind
Prophesise too much and that's where they draw the line
A line as thin as the line between war and peace
A line as thin as the line between west and east
One button away from world war III
Being called a minority
And being pulled always being pulled over and subject to brutality
Why is every street like a living hell
Probably cause they all just want us to fail
And three strikes and surely back to jail
Like the slaves ship when they sail but they don't know that
My people whose pains are cornered
My peoples all shapes and colours
My peoples got more peoples with ills
That's more peoples more sistas and brothas
My people stay strong as an ox
My peoples will never fail
My peoples will always remain
Remain with a story to tell
My peoples was paints on the door
My peoples all shapes and colours
My peoples got more peoples with ills
That's more people more sistaz and brothaz
My people stay strong as an ox
My peoples will never fail
My peoples will always remain
Remain with a story to tell
My peoples was paints on the door
My peoples all shapes and colours
My peoples got more peoples in jail
That's more people than sistaz and brothaz
My people stay strong as an ox
My peoples will never fail
My peoples will always remain
Remain with a story to tell
My peoples was paints on the door

My peoples got more peoples with ills

Reach out and feel this
Check it out

Rockin is a state of mind for niggas who really do it
Leavin suckaz behind and can't pull through it
You cut a throat to do better than niggas doing better
But you can't cut the neck of the second letter
U MP knucks rappers get swung like chucks
Niggas swearing that he nice when he really suck
And yo Ruk why do rappers say they thugs and gangstas
When they halloween dressin up nigga panty hose
Acting like he hard with them new edition candy girl flow
Im funky like George Sir Nose
I'm real like tax time you try to escape
I clamp down on your real estate and your fake estate
That means everything rented borrowed stolen
And anything you might be holdin
I Come like ?? it us
Under pressure bussin..
Philly soul reaching
Bumpy heart touching
Jazzy like jeff nigga I'm not a giraffe
Im bumpy abdu jamal I clap you fast
And be dead centre chest like the gold medallion
That hangs around a neck on a old italian

Scram kid your new to me you bother (that's right its bumpy knuckles)
Cause I know you niggas really ain't thugs
You trying to be hardcore but you really not
I'll write your eulogy you bother me(that's right)
It'll be no help from family or friends
Nobody can really help you now

Here I am the real emcee
Writing off sucka emcees like I'm dmc
Little killers in the bm 3
Follow Bumpy in the black 600 with the 1 2 V
I meant V12 but wherever I dwell
They'll bust for me in heaven they bust for me from hell
Cause I'm still hot any rapper I fear not
I give it to you raw like my pops was gil scott
Mama was jill scott
Humming melodies
My head on her chest feeling the bass in her breast
Time nor space exists for the man
That knows the eternal
Don't make me return you
You can pull it out
Wave it no doubt
But before you bust it off
Heres one to think about
Come to bumpy get your heart tested
If you pass you'll be passing out
I'm blasting in and I'm blasting out

Scram kid your new to me you bother me (that's right)
Cause I know yall niggas really ain't thugs
You trying to be hardcore but you're not (your not)
I'll write your eulogy you bother me
It'll be no help from family or friends
Nobody can really help you now (come on)

I'm more convinced now than on a part on my life
That I'm a die with rhyming kids and a rhyming wife
I'm a body every nigga that ever did me trife
That's word to great grand grandma indian and her carving knife
I'm power in its finest hour ask queen latifah
Whose the hardest rap gansgta that she'll ever speak ta
You better check my record
Matter fact check my album industry shook down
Niggas is shook now
Its time for revolution
Cause I see booty its wax prostitution
'Im the chairmen of busting niggas with chairs
Cracking niggas heads open with heineken beers
Most people see my shadow black and wide
But can't see my heart black with pride
Cause you got a devil inside
Plotting for the spot where the late great biggie reside
I be a father like big chuck
Raising my son and keep the enemy close
And bust their gun
I step to a few niggas and made em all one
With a 16 shot beretta that I call fun
Music must reflect the time time reflect the music
The shorty come correct if you next to use it
From lil bow wow to lil zane
I told this to kane's brother little daddy shane
I always spit a nigga name
And hope to god he answer then I get all in his body
Like a nasty cancer
I take honour and pride in the mic and I fight for it
Like it was a civil rights baby

Scram kid your new to me you bother (bumpy knuckles)
Cause I know yall niggas really ain't thugs
You trying to be hardcore but you really not (not baby)
I'll write your eulogy you bother me
It'll be no help from family or friends nobody can really help you now
Scram kid your new to me you bother
Cause I know you niggas really ain't thugs
You trying to be hardcore but you really not (your not)
I'll write your eulogy you bother me
It'll be no help from family or friends nobody can really help you now

I live a charmed life
We going back in the years
Imagining if my whole world what
Where you coming from
Brooklyn, New York to wherever you at
This is autobiographical taking you back
I live a charmed life
We going back in the years
Imagine if my whole world
I been around the sun twenty-five times
And I still find new ways to recognize shine
Its like light gets better with age
The way a song sounds better on stage
And rhyme books get better with each page
What before the first bar was written
A first verse was spittin
Before label execs was bullshittin
Way back when Aunty Leann Aunt Mimi and Aunt Jackie was babysitting
Before food was bitten, consumed through a nipple
I'm talking about when times were simple
To make a long story short it goes
Port-au-Prince Knoxville Anvan love and the city that never sleeps
From thought to finish I was born just a couple of weeks late
Stayed home longer just to make sure everything was on straight
All systems go cut the umbilical cord
From old earth to new earth Manhattan to turf
For what its worth my mum held me down one deep
Pops was absentee but minds you don't sleep
It took her feelings to raise me lean taught me how to read
By the time I went to school I was in high speed
Ready willing and able jackie taught me how to add with
Dried up black eyed peas on the kitchen table
And coming home to a mothers love and good care
Never wanted it was always enough
But when it came to education its like she had one rule
Theres no such thing as too much school
Not to mention lean taught me how to play the piano and then
Every summer I was out in south ben
Grandpops a bartender at a country club
Me and my cousins from grand rapid was living it up
Me and granny watching ??? football golden blue
She said you can't beat the team and them b's too
Some say I got my sense of humour from her
And I learned patience from making models in the basement
Brookyn, new york to wherever you at
This is autobiographical taking you back
With no time for refrains I barely got enough time to explain
How hip hop captivated my brain
My mama raised me on soul and beethoven
Sports clubs from private school put me up on soft rock
That was cool but I left Z100 and WGLJ
To find bliss with real s and kiss
Video music rocks showed my what time it is
Wrote my first rhymes as corey but j-live was sparked
Making pause mix demos with my main man mark
Playing ball in the park, there was other heads too
I was the herb of the crew, then I learned what to do
Got my way from school started battling fools
G nice my friendly rival at the lunch table
He started spark at a dark with damian and I date
I was down for a bit but that was just a DJ
Starting spinning in the PJs with satcho and them
Back and forth from the tables to the pad and the pen
Then I had to do a bit upstate but wait
I wasn't incarcerated but college educated
As soon the albany I was a full time student part time emcee
At the time raw shack was the place to be
Living on judge clark
Started building with gods
16 man squad
By the time knowledge was 120 we was just 5 deep
I went from mekka to albany a student and landed in medina as a teacher
I had this rhyme reacher
We recognised what whats happening
I'm making records and I'm winning
But that's another story and it's only the beginning
Brooklyn, New York to wherever you at
This is autobiographical taking you back
Not my whole entire life but just a slice of the pie

If you wanna borrow it you can borrow it anytime you want
Thanks
That could come in handy
I mean for school work and notes in class
Yeah its kinda tricky so you better be careful
See this button that's what you press when you wanna record
And this button is what you press when you wanna listen to what you recorded
But don't press that button cause I already got some stuff on it
Hear that he's just dying for us to listen to what hes recorded
Should we listen?
Sure that's what he wants

Whats your name?

Cause I flapjack tracks hot bottle bubblin
From the surface to the underground
Making people wonder how
Former labels blunded ow
Wishing they could stop me now
Sorry did I strike a nerve?
Oh well hit the curb (get the third)
If you wonder which one pick one
I been the one since the last time the Knicks won

Half these cats don't even know what you saying
And most the other half don't care)
Alright fine

You'd rather have me break it down like this
Jazzy Jeff
{Scratching}

Hey yo I transfer thoughts to tracks
To transcend translation
But you call it the kings English
Close but no Cubans
Unless you consider the correct kingdom
Cause empires extinguished
(Wait they trying to hard to get it
They looking like they listenin to the full band radio edit
You gave them too much credit thinking they could understand
Flip that old rhyme you kicked in 96 with Skam)
Okay I'm the man of the hour 24 times a day
The man of the day 365 out the year
That bullshit you say, Live is not trying to hear
I don't care if it I paused ya would be rap career (sorry)
In a man of the year contest I run a  in a decade
I have the next three locked down
(Wait you lost 'em again I think I made a wrong turn at the bend
Break it down in reverse my friend)
Okay
I'm the man of the year 10 times in a decade
12 months out the year
4 weeks out the month

If the week is still days in amaze
I don't know what the fuck else they want
Oh yeah
24 in a day that was hourly uh
Sixty hourly minutes that is
If you need simple lyrics you can call Mother Goose
I make Dr Dre sound like Dr Seuss
You can think up some dope beats that's what you can do
You can think about red you can think blue
You can think about chronic and think about drink
You can think of 6 4s all the thinks you can think
(Wait wait now they insulted yo they think that you snabbed em)
I ain't playing nobody son that wasn't a diss
I'm just saying if you can't handle real emcees

In Time,The Magnificent,2002,"Masters at work
Touch of jazz, collabo
Take time to make time
For all things work out so perfectly
There is a place I often
Close my eyes and drift off to
Where time stands still and it feels
As if I'm floating on a cloud now
In this place there are no burdens
Of the world to trouble me no
I become one with the rhythm
Caught by the spirit in love
With the beat, yeah, yeah
I start dancing to the rhythm of my own drum
Sweating away all my urban blues
And in that instant moment
The fast things of the rat race are left behind
And right now it could be sweeter I'm just passing time
I'm telling you we should
Take time to make time
All things work out perfectly
I'm telling you about
Take time to make time
All things work eventually
Take time, so relax your mind
Everything works out
When things don't seem to go your way

You have to be patient humble you must stay
I know that you might not want to wait
But don't give up, no
(Don't be afraid)
Find the energy inside to stand up

Adversity over come your fears with faith
And you will see you can stand up
On your own two feet
If you just be free, just be free
Hold on and make sure that we

Skaters Paradise,M3,2018.0,"Jazz fest in Montreux
Riding up mountains that make your mind blow
Real fine girl with a real nice convo
Run away moon baby where the time go
Work out nazi, yoga, tai-chi
Laila Ali I let her box me
Lying cougar, girl you foxy
Indonesia we head to Bali
Witness sun rise it looks so ?Cali?
Back in Chi-town I could not see
So much danger, Blackstone Rangers
Politicians is causing anger
All my hangups had to hang up
How can I fly when the wing is banged up?
Who had 36 in the chamber?
Only got one but I'm a real good aimer
I gots to escape some way, some how
I feel so trapped inside this town
Got a open road and a list of goals
Passport unfolds, we headed to Moscow
Vegas ain't far enough away
Hey, you're not gon find love in LA
And Miami is the place we go to play
Went to Cuba now I finally connect with Che
Motocycle ride out then fly out
Partying in Perth is the perfect hideout
Wish I could bring that back to my house
Then I could get my cousin off of my couch
Show him what it's like on the beach in Phuket
Feet in the sand, don't get your shoes wet
Ireland, Thailand shorts and crew necks
Maui lounge in salmon crew caps
Oh, there's sushi in Tok-y-o
Shot of the sake 'fore we go
South Korea they got Seoul
South Korea they got soul
With the fellas up in the favellas
Just like Compton gotta watch your colours
Street vendors is always trying to sell us
Cop one from one, the other get jealous
Got two for one, that's a hell of a deal
Went to Milan and had a helluva meal
Met a helluva girl in hot yellow heels
She was hella hot but she popped hella pills
Chill, I could bring you back to the Illadelph
Oh, you don't wanna go? Do you hear yourself?
Are you arrogant? Do you feel yourself?
Are you scared of the world? Do you fear yourself?
I'm flying out to Mount Zion
?K's in Ghana?, God I'll start crying
They can't chain me down, I'm defiant
Been around the world and now I know who I am
Yeah, I've been on the road so much this year
I ain't have time to cut my hair
Living out a bag, the same old gear
But I got to get out and clear my head
Space, time and place
You could have it all with the time it takes
14 hours to leave the States
Eating steaks on nice estates
Holy Batman, bathing apes!
Naples wine had the finest grapes
Main course meals on designer plates
Look, say something nigga I'll slap your face
I'm a travelling man, I'm a travelling man
You could do it too for a couple of grand
Instead of spending racks on a stripper to dance
You could spend a rack on a trip to Japan
Shit, that's all I'm saying
I'm just in the world doing all I can
Even though I ain't Mexican
I still wear the sombrero and the salsa pants
It's a party in here, it's a girl out there
If you in here, it's a World. Out. There

We Are,The Magnificent,2002,"Yo, just feeling the way that I do
Hope lives on, if not through me through song
I'm getting the long, take deep breaths and hold on
I write like I realize I could be gone
I'm here, is the true meaning of love clear?
If love is pain, is love really fair?
Is the meaning of life just to breed?
Is death losing all of your precious things?
Some think men don't cry, well, here's tears
Been told all these lives for these years
It's unclear why truth is untold
But hold fast and truth will unfold
I know but it's kinda hard to believe
That a whole generation will die over greed
And that most of our young will die overseas
But it all remains to go unseen
We are living for today not the past, trying to hold on
'Cause the trouble won't last
We are showing that the roots run deep
And the hope won't cease 'cause everyday we believe
We will, hold on and hold out, put it together
And make it work somehow
This is, this for Malcolm and music
My story, my movement, never forgetting the children
Keep your head to the sky
The only way that you fail is if you never ever try
Where I come from, I'm there for you, care for you
You don't have to worry I'm gonna always be there for you
Doing what, laying the foundation 'cause we gonna make it
But it's gonna take dedication
And what and hope and love and peace
I hope one day you'll see and then you can join us
Listen if you love me say the words to me
I'm surrounded by so many things that hurt to me
You know you'll always come first to me
This is music, it ain't nothing but a verse to me
Remember after the pain there's sunshine
It's not in vain we all feel it sometimes
Stay strong, hold on, we gonna make good

My story, my movement, never forgetting the children
This is for the mothers single handed
For all the ghettos way to dammit
Hey, the world, don't you panic
Let courage lead you right
Darkness is temporary
Even though the future's looking scary, yeah it is
The most I don't make mistakes
When your chosen us the light
I know we're a long way from home
On this land that they stole, took it all
Gave us drugs after gold
Incarceration to a fold
To raise the murder toll
What else, to divide communities
Do away with unity
Where the strength is human beings
We are living for today not the past, trying to hold on
'Cause the trouble won't last
We are showing that the roots run deep
And the hope won't cease 'cause everyday we believe
We will, hold on and hold out, put it together
And make it work somehow

My Peoples,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Whole Song voiced by Raheem - Background Vocals by Raheem & Valvin Roane)

I've seen streets we're youth are forced to take the long way home
And I've seen mothers mourn the loss of there only born
Still I believe we are given nothin more than we can beg
A vision is only blurred when life seems unfair
Who am I to judge the man with the needle in his veins
When hes just chasing freedom to escape the pain
Of the worlds fastpaced pipedreams and shortcomings
Hes just trying to make do and find a way out of nothing
Its like we damned if we do and damned if we don't
And it's a very thin line between respect and being broke

And being one red button away from world war three
Always called the minority
And always always pulled over
Facing police brutality
Why is every street a living hell
Probably cause they want us to fail
Yeah three strikes and surely back to jail
Like the slave ships when they sail

Years and years of civil rights chasing to pass that bill
But ask yourself people have we changed or are we standing still
Down and out struggling
In this concrete jungle
One check away from starvation, poverty
But they say being free is about speaking your mind
Prophesise too much and that's where they draw the line
A line as thin as the line between war and peace
A line as thin as the line between west and east

One button away from world war III
Being called a minority
And being pulled always being pulled over and subject to brutality
Why is every street like a living hell
Probably cause they all just want us to fail
And three strikes and surely back to jail
Like the slaves ship when they sail but they don't know that
My people whose pains are cornered
My peoples all shapes and colours
My peoples got more peoples with ills
That's more peoples more sistas and brothas
My people stay strong as an ox
My peoples will never fail
My peoples will always remain
Remain with a story to tell
My peoples was paints on the door
My peoples all shapes and colours
My peoples got more peoples with ills
That's more people more sistaz and brothaz
My people stay strong as an ox
My peoples will never fail
My peoples will always remain
Remain with a story to tell
My peoples was paints on the door
My peoples all shapes and colours
My peoples got more peoples in jail
That's more people than sistaz and brothaz
My people stay strong as an ox
My peoples will never fail
My peoples will always remain
Remain with a story to tell
My peoples was paints on the door
My peoples all shapes and colours
My peoples got more peoples with ills
More people more sistaz and brothers
My people stay strong as an ox

My peoples will always remain

So won't you mind your business. Don't be a f***in' hater
""P Crakk. I need that."" You got the remedy
You look surprised, ma. I got to refreshen your memory
Que tu quiere mujere? Tell me what you want
But before I could blow a line, baby lit up the Brand New Funk

Now, now, now, if you bump me by accident, you know what's gonna happen
I'm a tell Charlie Mack and he gon' smack your *** halfway across
Broad and Allegheny. No Alize and Henney
Just Don P. and strawberries for the hottest ladies
You gotta a body baby. Yo Jazzy Jeff, how you ridin' baby?
Yo Jeff, you think she got it? ""Yeah, she got it, Peedi.""
Whoa, she make me wanna ""get get down""
But before this party get started, let your boy hit the Brand New Funk
P. Crakk, Philly, who wanna rumble wit' me?
But so what Young Buck ain't nothing to me
I got fullys, semi-auty's it's on homey
I brought armor for drama. You ain't got nothin' for me
Go in my zone when I write, it's not surprising
You hear my flow and wanna bite. My only option's
To dust the dirt off my shoulders - it's Rocafella
I hope you know by now I ride with Hov. n****s is jealous
When they see me in a Bentley, Pirellis sittin in suspension
On 26's, *** blowing me kisses. My forces is crooked
The Cris is just as cold as my wristes
Stockin' cork for the *** that continue to keep on sippin'
It's the prince of the Roc. Jazzy Jeff got the beat locked
I learned the switch from Will Smith. I need not
To explain why I gotta front. It's not a game
Grab a Philly Blunt and fill it up wit' the Brand New Funk
(CHORUS and Jazzy Jeff doing the *** thang)
First the original, then here come some North Philly chemical
With Peedi the imperial prince through your stereo
Stupid. I get paid for conversation
It's easy, but I see you're having complicatons
Get it together. You ain't never gon' be better
Got it sewn like a sweater, make you ruffle up your feathers
Keep pulling a publicity stunt, I'm slap your *** silly

Throw lead (?) coated

With the pen in my hand
The dough that I get I choose to spend it on fam
Flow that you spit is like the fit of my pants
Wearing my shoes, washing my clothes, and cooking the food
Dependent
I'm independent
Nice is ain't no chrisis
For intervention I write this
Solfur lighters and (?) twisted
You off the bat and then I'm pinch hittin'
Put that ass on the bench like you Mich Richmond
Keep the pitch switchin'
Fast and slow the classic flow
Good riddance

My flow jet ski on S.P
The M.P. 6 O's

Spittin' rounds like a missle since down to the gristle

Four fifth in the coat liner
Haters strollin' done
Till I play Tiger Woods and put a hole in one (put a hole in one)

Ends tight like Chad Lewis

I caught two haters out there and there's one more left
You about to be number three like Grand Auto Theft
We underground with it
With enough (?) to lock it
Baby Blak will hold your hands while I shoot your pockets

Who could stop it?

As long as my crew can profit
I'm gonna put you to the test whenever used to top it

Who the underground DJ even dirty to echo
With more years in the cut game then Freddy Pachecko
It's JJ (nice with it till he DOA)
It's JJ (not from Good Times but TOJ)
Was born with it (what?)
You know you can't regroup cool
Jeff scratch like a hustler that can't shoot pool
Even if the needle jump no problem he's still scratching it
Double beatin, transforming and back scratching it
The underdog made his mark
Inflated on him
You said it couldn't be done, straight hated on him
It's all good Jeff is easily good
Never claimed to be the best but he easily could
Longevity back when you was riding your gas hinder (vroom)
Below the bikers and the bright yellow Pathfinder
You talking wheels he be on top of the heat
1200's in the club 6 out in the street
It's the magnificent (magnificent)

Magnificent sensational style
Jeff play it for a while
Whether AM or FM I'm spraying cassettes in
Same as when Jeff's in the DJ booth
He play truth
In and out of town overseas on the 3 day loop
Fly around on the plane and playin' EA Hoops and 2K Live
I'm the rapper watch the DJ rise
Jazzy Jeff look in they're DJ eyes
You could see in they're set
See it in they're step
You could see it in they're juggle
See it when they sweat
Soundin' mo fo
Fuck around and Jeff Townes will cut you
Jump on the stage in a crowd and duck you
So if you're last name ain't Townes then fuck you
The west cat the love cat
Soul searchin' (?) stacks spokesperson
So certain that he'll reign on new marks and leave 'em overworkin'
Blow circuits and lower curtains
J-A-double Z  J-E-double F
Straight out of double V
Pete (?) the heat for streets in the stations
Beat Generation heat for the nation

Know Ur Hood,The Magnificent,2002,"Bounce wit me y'all (LE)
Bounce wit em y'all
Now check it
Who get it live when the party dies down
Mysterious man showing up in your town
Lyrics like lightning, vocals like thunder
Neighborhood success or the overnight wonder
Uh, precise on mics but nice with the toe-to-toe
A roll big flow, shows out in Kosovo
Between flows and chasing them hoes
I make the crowd get down like its supposed to go
Get down year round glad to see y'all came
In the summertime banging at the b-ball came
In the wintertime kickin rhymes up at my block
With an L in one hand and a cup of hot chocolate
A man for all seasons damn I'm raw even
We set the bar high everybody start reaching, cause…
(chorus)
Who said I couldn't get it down like this
Some tried to get it but they got it like this
Put you in a mix, get your body the twist
Its the mystery man, that the fans can't resist
Six sold M-K-T playin the corner
Ice cold Colt 45, not Corona
Get down see me on the prowl now I'm gonna
Holla at this fine young girl named Sherona
See, morons stalk, I walk right up on her
And make her heart race like the Dodge Daytona
Tired of the neighborhood guys ""hey hold up""
How's she get that good lovin feeling when I show up
Down and ride wit me, don't forget me when you blow up
How you gonna walk away from this, sis slow up
The head games is over ma I'm for real
Your ain't Oprah and I'm not Dr.Phil
Despite your size and them serious thighs
The long eyelashes and mysterious eyes
It don't pay to stay away from mysterious guys
That get the girls on the floor and keep the party alive, cause yo…..
Chorus (x2)
Now if I wanted I could pump it in every club this week
But I pass cause it only adds to my mystique
If ya think that I'm weak then catch me out in the street
It ain't nothing to show me homie man we got this heat
That nigga that got all y'all waitin
To get off the wall and get the bar room shakin
I came to but the party under a rest
And if they like it in the hood, let it pump in the jets
Mystery man, never take my mask off
But when it comes to the raps I can act y'all
Non-stop flow that might flood the dance hall
Peace I'm out, be easy I get at y'all

Love Saviour,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah, Flo Brown
Yeah, tell me what you need, baby
Tell me what you need, baby
He asked what he had, he had to have me
Thought about a d, it took a few seconds
To think about the often asked questions
What it take to bring me back to heaven
Where we came from before we changed dun
The non relationin' aggravations
Simple conversations, arguments and beats
Focused by the mini and studied by the sheep
But I don't play those games and entertain
Physical before the mental
Lust before you enter
What makes me laugh and makes me cry
With very simple things that open up my mind
Put a tingle to my spine, make my eyes shine
Bright and wow, open like a child
Elegant with style that real mystique
That speak very little but say the greatest things
That's what I need, that is what it takes
That is what I give you all
You ain't got to need it
It is what it is, baby
That is what you need
Something that don't lie
That is what I need
You know what I'm saying
I often wonder why you can't see love
It's colorless with no smell but plenty of buzz
It take you to the threshold and hold you there
Straight to your flesh mode and scold you fair
Out of your wits with out of control fits
Emotional shit like this I'm speaking it
How it can happen
The force can start you clapping
Make you walk on air, fall on stairs
Call on prayers to free you back
Loosen up your grips and lessen up your straps
But you can have that water of the earth
Woman that can burst, I'm honey for your thirst
I'm talking about the greatest gift that's known to man
I'm speaking on the strongest ban just understand
Understand within your span what you can have
Take my hand as you imagine
That is what you need, that is what it takes
That is what I give you, baby
You ain't got to need it, it is what it is
That is what you need
Something like a love saviour
That is what I need
I paint a type of picture of an everlasting mixture
A man and woman sensual depictions
Times I gotta say it, I saw it in his eyes
He looked into my soul and took me by surprise
Had me walking around all rise, learn from the wise
A king that's comprised
Love for me that knows self
And never underestimate the power of my wealth
The pull of the ocean when he in it inner stealth
The fuel of the devotion when he crying out for help
I don't ask him much but give me everything
Give me what you ring, feed me what you sing
Said you was a king, so lead me to the spring
Summer then the fall I back walls y'all
That speak then don't live that wreak, that bullshit
Be grown now, show me strength and keep me tense
Love is what you need, love is what it takes
Love is what I give you, baby
You ain't gotta need it, love is what it is
Love is what you need
Something of a love saviour
Love is what you need, love is what it takes
Love is what I give you, baby
You ain't gotta need it, love is what it is, baby
Love is what you need
Something of a love saviour
Don't say love saviour
Love saviour, love saviour
Love saviour, love saviour
Love saviour
Just wanna save you, baby",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-love-saviour-lyrics
Da Rebirth,The Magnificent EP,UnKnown,"A one two, a one two
A one two, a one two
I'd like to introduce myself..
Many people think this style is terrific
It is kinda different, but lets be specific
Let's pay respects, dig it
Peace to KRS-ONE & Scott La Rock for the way that they did it
Peace to N.Y., not forgettin'
Rakim and Kane the list is too long to mention, all of yall
But since we here, put your hands up and enjoy yourselves
Cuz we just feelin it on the mic
And I'mma live hiphop for the rest of my life
And I'mma represent for the rest of my life
This is the life back when limits was ice
And niggas would bust, bust with the lyrics on mics
And you could start a house party just by killin the lights
DJ's was the life of the party
Back when everybody's favorite song was la di da di
That was love, perfect climax in the club
Then they pump LL cuz they needed the love
Pumas and Nikes, fat laces and shell toes
MC Lyte's voice alone used to steal the show
Everybody used to build and flow
We took turns with the beat box and watched the cypher grow
Words was dope and fly clothes was fresh
Plus everybody paid respect to Jazzy Jeff
That was dope
NOT ectasy
NOT coke
NOT killin' young kids for coats
NOT teachin' young girls how to sell their souls
NOT runnin' in homes or car jackers
NOT leavin' your own
I wanna go back to flows
Back to beats, breakers and shows
Back to sweats and (?)
Start re-buildin', let me know if you feel it
And I know all yall gon' feel it
And I know it hurts, but I swear you got to hear it
It's been a long time so you probably fear it
Any misconceptions killed it
Anytime my mics turned on and I'm anywhere near it
Ohhhh
Yes yes yall, you don't stop
Right about now we got DJ Jazzy Jeff on the wheels of steeeel",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-da-rebirth-lyrics
Play Dat!,UnKnown,2014.0,"Yeah
Dayne, Jordan

They got it backwards, these rappers
Got you confused by that wackness
They be kicking, my flows keep flipping I'm acrobatic
It came from the mattresses
Our neighbours used to put out in trash
We took and imagined it was a part of a gym
Now I'm conditioned to think, like I ain't got a pot to piss in
Do my push-ups drink water and learn to listen
Mic school pimping
But I see a lot of people are lost, they feel tripping
When they hear good music they don't know it
So I owe it to myself as a poet
To make sure my music is potent
I see a lot of people dancing to records that they don't even feel
They turn up, but they don't know where the soul is
I don't wanna hear it's that old shit
This that young boy, sit yo' ass down, you don't know shit
This how it used to sound in Philly at a block party
Let it knock 'til they call the cops on us

This ain't old music
Listen here this is dope music
You don't even know how to feel this old music
You ain't a DJ homie you don't know music
We ain't taking no requests we control music
So play dat! (play dat!)
You just play dat! (play dat!)
You just play dat! (play dat!)
We ain't taking no requests
We don't play dat (play dat!)
We don't play dat (play dat!)
We don't play dat (play dat!)
We ain't taking no requests

Ahhh
Youngun' brought the feeling back
I ain't really into that
Tryna' make a record everybody like
Just to get on radio, I'm buzzing on the internet
Internationally in places I ain't been to yet
Niggas say I'm conscious, this is far from the  rap
This is what my grandad
Used to rock to, in his cadillac
With his gat strapped
And a pocket full of paper numbers written on a pad
Working for the mafia
The only black thing in sight, with the whites, like a hockey buff
Grandmama, and mummy, and uncle, and auntie
Grew up on this type of music, so it's already inside of me
I got it honestly, but honestly
It wasn't playing in the crib I was living in
It wasn't until I got with Jeff and started digging where I discovered the classics
I'm trying to leave the same mark that there",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-play-dat-lyrics
I’m Looking For The One (To Be With Me),UnKnown,UnKnown,"I am looking for the one to be with me now
Are you looking for the one to be with you, now?
I am looking for the one to be with me, now
Are you looking for the...do you feel the same way too?
Come on, clap your hands, wind it up if you're feelin' alright
Clap your hands, wind it up, if you're feelin' the vibe
Nod your head from side to side, as you ride the vibe
Cause it's a party all night
You can't fight the feelin' you feelin'
Cause you're feelin' fine wit' nothing really on your mind
It doesn't matter if you're wit' your crew
Because (they can feel the same way too)
I came to get down (you came to get down?)
You came to get down? (we came to get down)
I like that sound
Cause it's a party over here, party over there
Party right here (hey)
Few over there (hooo)
Keep it goin', keep it goin', keep it goin' now
Keep it flowin', keep it flowin', keep it flowin' now
Keep it going, 'cause this is for you
So (you can feel the same way too)

You know the puck don't stop here
Fuck, the puck started here
That's why I gotta put my heart in here
To give you that old funky-funky-funky-funky-junky funk
That I know you want
So get your boom box so we can boom blocks
Or shake it up somethin' pride for life
'Cause we rockin', right?
It ain't a question 'bout bein' true
Because (you can feel the same way too)
A little somethin' for the radio (hooo)
A little somethin' for the video (hooo)
A little somethin' for the jeeps (ride-ride)
A little somethin' for the streets (hey, hey)
A little somethin' for the homies on the block
A little somethin' for the honies in the flocks
A little somethin' from me to you
So (you can feel the same way too)

Nine Trey, everybody wanna be a gangsta
Buck-buck-buck-buck, but no more, thanks to me
You got somethin' you can flip on the other tip
As you get lost in the smooth rhymes I rip
Years and years my peers misunderstood
That I made cuts from my guts to make you feel good
And if you get it, this is for you
So (you can feel the same way too)
Put your hands in the air, come on now
Put your hands in the air, come on, yeah
Feel the vibe, Jazzy Jazz in the place, right
The upper-ground sound and pound to knock you outta your hide
Feelin' a'ight? You feelin' a'ight? (yeah)
You feelin' a'ight? You feelin' a'ight? (yeah)
Well next time bring a friend wit' you
So (they can feel the same way too)",https://genius.com/Dj-jazzy-jeff-im-looking-for-the-one-to-be-with-me-lyrics
