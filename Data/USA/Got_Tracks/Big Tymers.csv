Broads,How You Luv That? Vol. 1,1998,"See these broads, I like em and shit
Wish I could give all these hoes a picture-of-my dick
See I like em and psyche em, then I get in the win
I might just need you and leave you at a quarter past ten, but
I ain't gonna lie, your pussy was good
But your mouth is better so I wish you would
Work your way down to the diznick
It feels so good when you do the liznick
You got me doing push-ups and I'm taking ginseng
(Let's get ready to rumble!) In the middle of the ring
You got my dick hard like a '57 Chevy
Rocked up, ya cocked up, cause I'm ready
To go up in ya, let that other nigga send ya
Cards and shit while you suckin my dick
I like you a little bit more than I'm diggin my shirt
Ya little pretty ass dick suckin expert, beeyoch!

See I love these broads but I toss em up quick
Every trick that I get, they get flipped through the clique

These broads, nigga, I wish that I could love em all
These broads, nigga, I wish that I could fuck em all
These broads, I let these hoes just drive my car
But these hoes know one thing: that I'm a superstar
These hoes get out of line, I'mma show 'em I'm a hog
And now that I'm rich, I show these hoes that they ain't shit
And every ho I fuck with, I make suck my dick
It ain't no secret, I know these hoes about my money, shit
But I tell a ho quick, that she ain't shit
My main ho Clare, I don't make her suck my dick
I might just get loose and wanna kiss my bitch
But now that I got a daughter, I'm supposed to be light on a bitch
But I'm gonne be hard on these hoes for life, shit
I'm a true U-P-T player for life, shit
But I'mma say it again, I don't love no bitches
I about my money, nigga, and fucking these bitches


Now I dunn been here for 25 years
I understand one thing: that life is a bitch
I dunn lost my ma and my pa, my brother and my sister all up in one year
I understand one thing, I gotta ball til I fall
And show these hoes that money ain't no thang, dawg
See, I tell a bitch that she ain't shit
And at the same time ask that ho to suck my dick
See, I don't take money and mix with no bitch
Cause one thing, these hoes would lose they mind and get lost quick
It ain't no secret, I make these hoes think I'll pay their shit
But I keep it real and I pay my nigga's shit
I say, ""fuck a ho,"" and make these hoes back up
I keep it real and fuck with niggas who'll act up
And kick in your front door, your ho told my nigga where your dope
Now you stuck out like a ho!
And my niggas dunn hit a lick from your bitch
And all you hoes mad cause we dunn hit your shit

Birdman: Now that was beautiful 
Baby
. How you love that? Wassup wassup, me, with these bitches
I like gettin my dick sucked, that's the only way I can get it. What's happenin
Lil Wayne: Dawg...I like to get full of that enema and Kool-Aid...go all night
Birdman: Yea...I get full of the Crystal, that shit get a nigga hot. Bitch know one thing: she fucking with Baby, she gonna scuff her knees up, it's just like that. On the other hand, Lil One, what's happenin, what you workin with, what's in your pockets foo?
Lil Wayne: (mutters) I'm playing with about...15
Birdman: Well...if he got 15 then you know I got 45. Wassup. Cadillac wassup boy? Uptown for life. Drivin nothing but new cars and fuckin these broads. We pimp with our nose closed now boy! We about to have big thangs! Pretty broads! Nothing but new cars! It's all gravy, baby, believe that. Hot Boyz...it don't stop till the casket drop.

Millionaire Dream,How You Luv That? Vol. 1,1998,"Whazzup
This the life nigga
Check

I got ten round my neck, twenty on my wrist
Million dollar luck ah, million dollar kiss
Pull up in my Lexus, sippin on Dom P
Call me lil' baby Pacino of CMB
I floss everyday whoady
Knowin to shine like a crushed wined face Roley
What the deal on the real it's all about scrill
Pretty grills, pretty broads, and plenty mills ah
Ridin to myself up in my baby benz
Playin tens, goin shoppin with my lady friends
Flyin to Nashville, me and bob splittin eighty
Then I chill on Washatona with Slim and Baby
See the $ on my back symbolize my click
See the $ around my neck symbolize we rich
Always wonderful, but Baby gotta see it to believe it
All this ice and rich heights man it's off the heezy
Fifteen and I'm workin wit a hundred and better
And you can put that on my diamond Gucci bezel
What

I got ten around my neck (mm mm)
And baguettes on my wrist (*Bling*)
See we ball till we fall (la la)
Livin a millionaires dream (wootay)

Since I done hit me a lick, I done got some shit
That most niggas out chere can't fuck wit
Sixty- Five on rims to get they mind right
Then took the Cash Money piece and put twenty all night
Now I'mma ball till I fall if it kills a bitch
Check the crown of the Roley from the flick to the wrist
Six figures ain't enough for this game that I'm in
If I can make a hundred G's then I can make a million
Rice and Baby in a loader fuckin around with them hoes
Me and Slim was parlaying makin deals in the rose
Wayne and Manny in a hummer spit 'n game to a bitch
B.G. and Juvi in a benz bumpin hot boys this
Big Tymers oh it's nothing nice I ain't sellin for shit
If it's a Bentley that I want, it's a Bentley I get
Drop-top, CD changer, come equipped with the phone
Cash Money Big Tymers and we ride on chrome
Playa Haters want to picture me fallin'
If you could picture 'Pac rollin, then you can picture me ballin
Living good, lookin good, playin cards with the ???
CMR Hot Boys Big Tymers for life, nigga
Yeah we drinkin diamonds and gold
For the nine scrilla, biatch (echo)


Nigga I got million stashed so I can buy these buildings
And duck these killings
And tipping these niggas tryina have billions
I just wanna raise my two children
Going to these white folks and demandin millions
Havin 'em saying Cash Money worth figures
And tippin 'em just like Suge Knight did 'em
And I done did my dirt in the process tryna' make millions
See I done did a lot of shit in my lifetime
Like, makin money, committing these stupid crimes
But I still got my ghetto stripes
When I'm pimp in the game
Cuz, I love to hustle all through the night
Cuz, when I hit my block it's like the Pope done stopped
I have them lil' children sayin, ""Baby please don't stop""
Worth six figures and I'm rich and these hoes and right
Hustlin all night so Lil' Bryan can eat right
I'm going holla at my people in Melph to make sure shit right
??? so I'mma cruise to the next life
Me and Bryan got to bitches we goin fuck tonight
If they don't give up the pussy hotel they get left tonight
That's how it be worth some G's
Man you can play them hoes like they ain't worth shit
You dig
(Baby Talking)
[Chorus)

Young niggas wearin cracka gators
All my life eatin steak and potatoes
Valet please get the beige Mercedes
It's beautiful, la la, don't hate us
Back up for the most spectacular, cake stackular
Performance like Acura, got these stayin like Dracula
Vroom, how you like that diamond bezel
Blindin everything up in this bitch when I hit the shiny pedal
It's marvelous, the life I live
Smile pretty child got plenty Crystal to give
Rolex's for everyday of the week
Blowin gars in all kinds of cars will my brother Keith
Steaks and fetuccini, lil' girls in bikinis
Maybe Baby might let me use his beige Lamborghini
Givin all these project hoes the weenie
On radios and videos y'all hoes seen me

"Cutlass, Monte Carlo’s, & Regals",How You Luv That? Vol. 1,1998,"Started with....

Cutlass, Monte Carlo's, & Regals, man
To Surburbans, Expeditions, with the T.V.'s playin
Cutlass, Monte Carlo's, & Regals, man
To Surburbans, Expeditions, with the T.V.'s playin

In 1988, when my grandfather passed
He left me a Monte Carlo and a large amount of cash
It was, bubble gum blue with the leather plush seats
And I just can't thank you enough for all the stuff that you done, G
See my grandmother told me take care of the ride
And always do your best to keep it clean inside
So I just past the go and get the candy paint
Leather white, outta sight, that made the girls faint
See my partner, Eric, he got stereos
And my partner, Steve got true and bolds
And my dog, Black got european fronts
And this nigga named Duke hook up all the humps
I had a illegal Regal and it was so tight
And if ya touch it then a whole 7th ward was gon' ride
So I just count my blessings and I thank the lord
For ghetto cars and these broads when times was so hard
My grandfather lookin' and I'm ridin' straight
Man, I got the Suburban swervin' with the 4 T.V.'s playin'

Cutlass, Monte Carlo's, & Regals, man
To Surburbans, Expeditions, with the T.V.'s playin
Cutlass, Monte Carlo's, & Regals, man
To Surburbans, Expeditions, with the T.V.'s playin

Lil baby, Corleone in a Kompressor
20 inch cyl-inders on the Lexus
Hummer got sound that'll blow your eardrums
Lotus with 4 pipes  nigga, listen
I ride Q5 on factory
It don't matter, your ol' lady still after me
My name gon' rang all over, dawg
Cause I got 6 tires on the Range Rover, dawg
My nigga Baby,  Live on chrome
My nigga Baby, he get his shine on
But, hold up, when I pass in the stretch
They  gotta catch they breath
Fresh law, girl, weed hotter than a kitchen
In a big burban, VCR's, television
El Camino's, twistin' on bees
'87 Regals, Impala's, Cherokee's
Expeditions, Benzes, Navigator, Humvee's
What dawg? Cut dawg, on 17's
Wood grain, 15 double o
Me and Rabbit on momos, lord, bless his soul
Now we ridin' up the block, the Caravan
Expeditions and Surburbans with the T.V.'s playin'

Cutlass, Monte Carlo's, & Regals, man
To Surburbans, Expeditions, with the T.V.'s playin
Cutlass, Monte Carlo's, & Regals, man
To Surburbans, Expeditions, with the T.V.'s playin

Fuckin' right, I used to play in MCT's
Nowadays, Playboys ridin' Benzes
Back in '87, Mannie had mixtapes
Soniac Park, everyday, Super Sunday
My homeboy Fresh, done changed the rims
He gotta satellite on top to talk to out of state friends
'88 was my year, 14 with 12 G's
Monte Carlo's ridin' on 18's
It's '98 and I done flipped the script
Thangs that changed, Baby gotta lotta shit

I ain't gotta lie, nigga like me was ridin' the bus
Up until I got with CMR-a
A nigga was catchin' the cut
Them bitches didn't wan holla
Them niggas didn't wan holla
Got all the empower from people I get showered
The woman on the porch sayin', ""Ain't that Lil Wayne boy?
That boy be on T.V. too, ain't that the same boy?""

And fifteen figures with fifteen niggers
And fifteen hummers with triggers

Tear It Up,How You Luv That? Vol. 1,1998,"Baby gangsta got an A.K
With 50 shots for that ass
We play it raw on V.L
If you lame you can't last
No hesitation in my trigger finger to blast
Any false move will leave a nigga on their back
Wodie I'm young but strictly bout my cash
Fuck petty check I want it in thousand dollar stacks
I'm a nigga that's on the grind for six figures
I'm a chilla but bring me out my bad I'm always splita
You kill me it really don't matter to Lil B. Geezy
It's cool whoa I'm waitin' to see my nigga L.Teezy
No bullshittin' I fuck bitches by the pack
Hoes be wishin' to watch t.v's in the Expedition
Me and Lil Wayne keep it real like we supposed to
It's a few niggas in Carrollton that I get close to
Any other I put a slug above their shoulder
It ain't no secret I represent uptown soldiers

Now I be gettin' down and dirty from the U.P.T
Nigga try to test-bless his soul, he rest in peace
You mess with me and you will see how messy it be
Lil Wayne hat tipped Dickies fall to my feet
I done wet a lot of places
The same nigga that be jumpin' out suitcases
Yes I pull up in my Compresser (Mmm-hmm)
You seen me earlier in the Lexus
That's how we do it
What, got something against me and my cash money brothers
Yeah I floss but niggas know that I'm a young head buster
I come to tear this mother...Don't say that

2 bitches in the room 2 bitches in the lobby
Baby what!? Tear this motherfucker up

Knock a bitch out, then wake a bitch up
Then knock a bitch out again
Y'all pick the bitch up

Bad ass mad ass captain bitch beater (MMMM)
What's the difference between me and your pipes

Do you know what this ballin is, I'm talking bout marble floors
Tricks in private jets, hoes behind Rover doors
You talked about me bad but what you doin
Nothin but walkin round tha projects shoo-shooing
Get mad when I flash tha karats don't want to see me have it
I guess tomorrow I'll be smokin a 'gar in Paris
My cellular ring, ok let's pick up this change
Beeper blowin up, I'm lookin down at tha game
I'm steady changin cars so tha feds won't mess wit me
Park tha Q 4-5 and hop in tha Cherokee
At about 8:30 I'll be rollin in a millennium
Sippin on condact on my way to my condominium
Been rollin livin lavish, eatin in commanders palace
Bitches attracted to tha savage
Where niggas is chillin, sleepin in tha Royal Senesta
My girlfriend is my berretta, I never left her
What you know about them Beamers and Moe-Moe's
Them Lexus 4-doors and them '97 Volvos
Hell I might as well buy me a castle instead
And get fed some grace by Miss USA

How can I make a million?
Without tha feds investigating my building
I know niggas gone try me, I'ma have to kill them
But I'ma keep on makin money up until then
(Baby)
Golds and hoes, niggas doin videos
My everyday wear is Reeboks and Girbauds
Young nigga look I'm smarter than Russell Simmons
And I got more money than tha average nigga
I done sold coke nigga, I done hit blocks
I done sold rocks, tha cheap shit had to stop
I had to be tha biggest nigga on VL block
So I bust open me a quarter ki spot
Two G's a Q-P, now my block is hot
A hundred G's a week nigga, so I couldn't stop
Now I done stole me a few ki's
I'm tha only young nigga Uptown frontin Q-P's
You don't believe me ask Joe Casey
My background coke history speak for me
Diamonds and gold all across tha T-O-P
And all these hoes wanna ride in my Lexus Jeep
If it ain't cheddar or cheese it ain't gravy
And these car stealin hoes stay up off tha street
And these playa hatin niggas need to stop passin through tha UPT
And all my new hoes gone ride in my Hummer
But I got a top of tha line bitch beside me
And if a nigga fuck up my hoe gone ride for me
See I'll put change on my own brain
Bitch I spent 50 G's bullet proofin my Hummer man
25 G's on Fresh's Suburban nigga
We all pack vests nigga, I know you heard me nigga
Big Rufus got a Tec and a Lex and he flexin
And if a nigga disrespect God gone have to bless em
And let his mom dress em cause it's all good
It's all gravy, bitch nigga stop playa hatin

(Mannie Fresh)
I done did more hoes than Michael Jackson done shows
I done made more money than Tommy sale clothes
I don't think that you can umout shine me man
You need to um stand behind me man
Come through this bitch lit up like December
Givin all these pretty hoes something to remember
I'ma nigga wit some endangered specie boots
Spillin crystal on tha floor oppps
Picture me and yo old' lady butt naked and shit
She drunker than a muthafucka, suckin my dick

Niggas wearing Rolexes
Spendin 50 or better till coming back from Texas
Bustin' keys in the leather
Got a hummer full of bricks
Cuz I know I'm the shit, you can believe that nigga
Got diamonds and golds so I can blind these hoes
I'ma ball till fall, spend 10 g's at the mall
& have a big ballin party, inviting all y'all
10 G's around my neck, 50 g's on my rolex
100 G's on my Benz, 10 G's on my rims
500 G's laying on the floor
My partner hit the doe give 'em 20 G's off the floe
The old man never seen that much cash before
700 G's stashed away for my son
I done hit a  hard girl and gave her gold cum
Now i'm sittin' on 2 mil-lion just in case I die
Baby name ain't gonna die
Little BCW gonna ball till he die
Now Playboy, tell me how you luv that?

I got so many cars I don't know what to do
I got so many hoes I'll give one to you
Lexus laying wit the TV playin, that my CO
Projects swallow me, cuz I'm negro
The cornrolls don't got a hummer man
The broads too I keep the hurricane
Nigga raw street, thats the bubblied Benz
Nigga raw folks, wit the Batman Benz, come on
Put your eyes on this nigga Baby
Papa, I got a diamond ring for you maybe
I slam cadillac bowls me and Baby gram
Out of state hoes wit diamond rings
7 nigga teens
Look at the fuckin karats on your triple beam
How you luv that?
Lexus wit the blue stripe
Can you take that Apollo with the white ass pipes
100's, 1000's, millions, damn
Like from 6 till noon, I buy a whole building man

Bitch we top of the line
Never fuck wit niggas that drop a dime
Thinking we ballin I'll fuck if you mine
Your talks is too high. there's some diamonds bout to be blind
Stop some time, then you can possibly climb
I got Cash Money to prove it
Walking and talking like I'm all cute and
Refreshen and reuse it
With cars you can't purchase
While you strugglin for 2 g's at churches
Nobody searchin, they just find and drop the bitch
Probably looking for the boy, so we can get out this bitch
Now the drink is on us, for the fights no fuck
I'm visiting a whore, hoes only got butts, get naked
And show cunts
I need fucking sucking ass blowing
Now just back up and show us your butt
Blow up when you see us
Go down the beach and get some Reeses
If don't believe it, ask Jesus
Bitch we ballin",https://genius.com/Big-tymers-ballin-lyrics

These haters be packin' they nine
But look nigga, I'm down for mine
Tryin' to catch me at the red light gettin' my shine
But I use my niner to protect me at all time
I just bought that new Lexus
1998 the bubble eye nigga with them 19 inches
See I'mma talk about my Hummer at the end of my rhyme
I just bought that new Range Rover with them 6 new ties
And every ho I know, I done fucked at least one time
Now playboy, tell me, how you luv that?

Last night I got a call on my phone
Ike Turner wanna make a ""gangsta-slap-a-bitch-pimp"" song
He said, ""I called you man, cause you the realest
Bitches runnin' round town sayin' how they love Willis""
Have hoes to suck toes and wash clothes
Niggas tryin' to fit ya like a pair of Girbauds
Bitches in the morn' to brush my teeth
Lil' girls with curls love to wipe my feet
BLING! Diamonds glistenin' everywhere
It's alright for that girl to look at me, y'all let her stare
Baby, I know I'm gorgeous, cause I'm the largest
Jet skis and M3's in my garag-es

I bought a Hummer that's sittin' on 32's
Fuck stun'n, we givin' these hoes the blues
Fresh got a Bourbon that's sittin' on 20's, fool
Wood grain, T.V.'s and it's all cool 5x

Now nigga, tell me how you can beat this
A million dollar worth of cars all on chrome, can you defeat this?
With all new homes, 8 of them
The Hot Boy$ new album, Get It How You Live!!, done jumped off strong
I spent 2 million buildin' my own home
With a million dollar worth of furniture all on wood grain, homey
See nigga, I ain't gotta stunt cause I can bag'em up, Believe this
Ask the police at Eastover, ""Has he seen this?""
Nigga with diamonds and gold, all across the T-O-P
And every ho in my path done seen that I done fucked for free
The pussy, I like to fuck it until it bleed
Cause I aim to succeed to be a top rank in this industry
And my Humvee
Playboy, I got so much wood in that motherfucker it need ot be a coffin seat
For 4 brand new T.V.'s with VCR
The Big Tymer, it come on tomorrow
Ridin' on 32's and you cain't miss these G's
All on chrome from the motherfuckin' U-P-T
When I get my big baller party
Player, I'mma let all my dicksuckers get in free
You can believe that


Do you remember that day on the lake?
Hummer came throught like a motherfuckin' earthquake
Niggas tellin' bitches, ""What the fuck is that?""
Bitches tellin' niggas, ""I told ya they be back.""
In '98, I bought the Viper white,red, and stripe-ah
20 inch rims with the chrome dual piper
15 on my wrist, the lord can kiss
Where the diamonds don't shine, niggas make hips
Wildlife gator fits, now that's the shit
Bourbon and Suburban with the wood grain kits
See ya bitch, I'mma stick her, Mike couldn't dick her
The way I'mma do her, screw her, then I'm gon' flip her

Two livin legend paper chasers from uptown
Bout money and bitches, puttin haters in ditches
We roll in trucks like Hummers and Expeditions
Our relationship like Moses and Jesus
Ask one of our hoes, ain't no comin between us
Two black young kingpins, that's how they treat us
Steaks and fettucini is what they feed us
Nigga ridin shinin, me and my nigga be sippin
The finest wine and spendin G's, makin trips
Back and forth to Texas, we flyin; tryin to make a mill' y'all
Cause we roll with the motto, ""Ball til we fall""

Fuck wit me G you bringin Baby all the way out there
Since ninety-two ninety-three our love been there
We never spend to a pussy, Cash Money niggas share
I'm a Big Tymer, that's a fact
Suga Slim just signed a, million dollar contract
Lil' (?) Capone thuggin quick to bust yo' head
Watch your tone in that mansion is where we lay our head at
We play high gold floss rocks and drive drop-tops
Way I bust it look like Suge and 'Pac

Baby and B.G. comin through like assault rifle machine guns
Worth more money than these niggas could wonder
You better thank quick nigga we hit blocks like thunder
Comin through a dark tunnel a black on black Hummer
It ain't no secret we showed our ass last summer
We both got three or fo' bitches we bank at first
Embassy playboy to hide our riches
Me and this young nigga we tighter than stitches
He the motherfuckin rapper and I'm the game spitter
And if you you fuck wit him
I'll clear my bank account on one of you bitches
And I'll put that on my Ma and my Pa and they both restin in peace
It ain't nuttin in this industry gon' fuck
Wit Baby and little B.G., wit Mannie Fresh beats
Wit Suga Slim's brains behind all this heat
And my Hot Boyz strapped ridin right beside me
Nigga I'll bet a million dolars to yo' light bill
I'll bet my Rolex wit my bezel nigga to yo' cable bill
It ain't nuttin in this industry could fuck wit Cash Money
Cause we keep it real nigga, believe that

B.G. and Baby, livin good pah
We just determined to hustle and get out the hood dog
Fuck wit me and my boy, I wish you would dog
We ridin dirty and I'll put that on the hood dog

Now what make these hoes thank that I ain't rich?
What make these niggas think the diamonds on my Rolex ain't the shit?
My brotha Prime taught me how to wear two Rolexes at one time
Nigga I'm gon' shine til I die
Me and this nigga been together since he was twelve
Hangin out at club, Rolexes daybreak watchin my beeper ring bells
Now I knew this young nigga would end up swell
I used my mind to keep him writin rhymes
Cause I knew he'a be major at one time
Now I done rolled in the flyest cars

Drivin in a Benz, burban Lexus
Coming through this motherfucker, turning motherfuckin necks
Going back in a superstretch
Just to see how many shy bitches I can catch
When I ride motherfucker you gon know
20s on the skinnies hanging out the window
Leather in-terior wood grain
18 inches woofers bought me so much pain
I'mma mac like Roley the one and only
Puff like daddy and im pretty like Tony
See the ho, bitch, shit
Its gotsta stop calico on the flo when aruba state cop
For the niggas in the night that call jack
With the tool imma fool, automatics click clack
I wanna fuck and how to fuck you bigger
Mama gonna dress ya and lord gon bless ya nigga
In the middle of the night it's hot
Call toll take a Frank mean yall to the spot
Cash Money rules everything around
If you represent U.P.T. or downtown

Bitch I thought ya knew they call me Baby
Hoes I drive them crazy
Money is a must, coats slanging
Plus I never duck when niggas bust in cars
I love many Benz, expeditions , hummers
They so pretty, and I fuck these hoes
Got a grill with a mouth full of golds
And Bitches know, that im rich and dont take no shit
Notice lamborgini niggas that isnt shit
And I love these hoes that suck dick
Big Tymers for life it’s the shit
50 g's on my rolex From acorn
Sugar slim got the brains behind it homie
And It's so real nice with the ice
They call me Baby These bitches know my game is tight

Who can file for most of the squash
Blast through the door and get your ass tossed
Every nigga on the map on acasion lose every nigga in them hallways
Nuthin but truth is behind the peace treaty is the best decision
Cuz you don't want them to hit cha bitcha
Me in the coop, ya'll in the hall
Ya'll on the crawl so I gots to ball
I'm in the yearbook
When I was at booker t party of the year 1993
My satisfaction is, I've never been a problem
See my advirsaries were suspended and I hide em
When I'm stuck in the club niggas will let you know
On the door start looking for sure
And if you want to start something
With my kliq it's cool cuz chop off all your dicks
Uptown baby the Big Tymers know where I live
The third door from the hum drums
Your dumb if want some rowdy boy we'll some
You won't see us in the tinted old car
Won'tcha ass be all fallin behind
But you got luck thats why you got behind
Time is running out for you fools
Chickens I was at your girls house with the lights out
And slash your fuckin leather
Get a seperate shit better, whether
Win, lose, or draw, still losing my clip
Cuz uptown for life is the motherfuckin shit

I'm the little one with the skrilla thats off the rilla
Cuz killas get punked on the start of pilas
Nigga it's me Hot Boy show
Head tilted to the right, I'll be right next store
Nigga you know me from the true store
I die slow cuz the bullets, are old
Niggas fall to the floor, ain't a slug to touch
Too bad little nigga say what
Your pants sagin and your head busts like a skittle
I'm on fire so they tried to chill it
Tell em dogg, ain't nothin gonna shake
Creep like a slave and take all the bait
Like a tape, I still rock the mack 10
110 bullets twirl like a whirlwind
I tie up your boy and rape your girlfriend
Come off the sex with the choppers twirlin in the wind
Better watch your children, are they all in?
I shoot twice, your crawling and I get disgusting
The beef get ugly, start busting going uhhh, up in
Jesus please come see us in the speeder
I jump out with gun in the freezer
Plus your boys won't go
They must of heard of Big Tymers, act like you know

Brought me to uptown second line
Met meatball, nair, anglin mets
Want you do a D.J. in the jets
Bought two Triggermans and Brown beats
Now you can pop that pussy in the middle of the street
Best believe next week I'mma be downtown
Point court St. Bernard bitch throwin' down
Then I'm mosy on down cross the kanel
Put up the mic cuz I got a fuckin' story ta tell
Teresa
Baby: Yous a Ca$h Money bitch say what you still a Ca$h Money bitch
Manny: I say lil Lisa
Baby: You still a Ca$h Money bitch say what you still a Ca$h Money bitch
Manny: My nigga Baby ya wit me

Manny: Now bring it to the McMelph Caliope

Niggas livin for the Sunday
On the lake bakin cake watchin niggas ridin round with they honey
(Drinkin Daquiri) Hoes packin, white folks actin
Givin tickets nigga for the jackin
Niggas feudin, game losin
Lil' told me ta watch these hoes tryin to abuse me
Joe Casey, goin crazy
My homeboy told me to watch these motherfuckin feds
Chilly Chilly actin silly, but cha name killa
Told me he gon' kill him a nigga
Suga Slim, all in, game tight
And we just about to start this all night flight",https://genius.com/Big-tymers-big-ballin-lyrics

Shhhhh, nigga drinkin don pie, and crystal (Huh Bra?)
All that in the ass, fuckin these hoes, ballin till we fallin
Drankin too much, but its all good (all good)
Its all gravey dog watchin they dogs come out
(Baby)
Thugged out, when I met the president
Reeboks and Girbuads, when he came into my residents
Vest up cuz I ain't trust the hoes who we fuckin wit
Three years in 86 and the mayor supportin mah shit
Wasn't pickin no cotton for no redneck, Bitch!
And I wouldn't fuck foxy with another nigga dick
Been slick doin this shit since 86
Scarred wit mah neck and my tattoes on mah wrist
And my motto is I'll fuck a bitch
Cash checks quick and I done payed my dues to this rap shit
Competition catchin' the blues 'cause we comin' with that raw shit
That brown layed down shit
Stack your cheese wit a tape that's fire slick
And bees like butter fresh got 'em runnin' to the store quick
And it cost half a key to see my in the club slick
And sure 'nuff I dont wanna see no blood slick
And it cost a whole key to see me in the stadium, Bitch!
And ill put that on the bezzle if you dont belive that shit
(Juvenile)
I ain't givin up shit, everything I got I earned
Nuthin for free, up in this world is what I learned
Backdown for what, I know them playas up in that cut
And they tapin us, my shot they can't wait to bust
So all you niggas slow down, you drawin more heat
I read it in the paper already , they say they gonna sweep
A brother doin 10-9, im fuckin with you clownz
Nigga done take his charge, so mah people went down
Get some were you ain't got nuthin to do?
Im ballin now, I dont time to be fuckin witch you
Me and chilly ride hod , ready to ball like a dog
Get full of that hen and that dro' until we fall
Dont answer the phone , cuase they got us under survalliance
Look in the real b , You dont know them people tralin?
(Chorus)
Drop, Drop, Drop it like its hot
Watch out ,watch out drop it like its hot
Whoa, whoa drop it like its hot
Watch out ,watch out drop it like its hot

Who the only nigga you know that'll hassle a bitch
Who the only nigga you know that'll Harass a bitch
Fresh miggity, Big Dickity, do the liggity
Then you my baby boo, Fo shiggity
You done seen me, got the super weeny
Ridin with a bitch in the blue Lambourgini
Muggin while she between me
Eatin Hizucks, Beatin Dizucks
Suckin till she catch the Hizucks
When I shoot the rizzucks, I like 'em I love and I smash
I hit 'em qiuck in a mash, till the kat K Robbin,Weebon and Bobbin
Big lip Slobbin on the telephone poles (Whoa)
The pickle has no heart, in the middle of the dark
If u can't finish this shit you shouldt have start, with a big-dick birdie man
23 year old dirty man, pull of yer skirt and then grab your hand
And let you insert, Da Man
(Chorus)
(Cadillac)
Baby im'a ctach my cut from saratoga unravelin
Tryin to twist 'em with the shit, with brite gangsta unravelin
Runnin of on mah shit, Tryin to take what was mine
But im'a gip with mah shit from 6 figures to the last dime
Cieze my bank account and I still got my drug bout
If I was runnin with them niggas then i'd be crossed up
Im'a ball till I fall, What you think I was playin?
I like cars and broads, but im real with this rap thing
I still got mah buildins, still gonna make a million
Im'a slang these rocks, from all the way up, They killin 'em
Take it how you want it, I ain't got shit for the doubt
Till im finished with the life, asked slim its a mougt

Got the brand new Mo-Moes, twenty inch shoes
Every city I go, these hoes know
Dick slingin contest after the show
Shootin off like a cannon, nuts landin
Right up in va-gana, dick still standin
Hard like a mack test, mega mess
I love it when you walk around showin ya breast
Load music got us shinin, drinkin wine
Bustin out rubbers like it's 1999
Diamonds like street lights, racin bikes
Candy paint, chromed out, dual pipes
I wish I could love every broad the same
Have kids all over with my last name
Ya'll niggas don't think I'm serious, huh
Ya'll think it's a game
But I'm bout the money, the bitches, the cars, and the fame

Ball like a dawg (I'm on top of da world)

Lamborgini's bullet proof, nigga you can't kill me
Vacationin at Las Vegas casinoes
Wit about 100 G's worth of c-notes
Lookin at all these pretty hoes
Gettin beeps from my niggas 'bout some cash flow
I gotta head back to the motherfuckin N.O
And clique up wit my motherfuckin negroes
And tell Stank get the Lexus cruise 4 doors
And beep the clique, tell 'em strap we 'bout to roll
Go and eat fetticini with the main hoes
And where trillionaire earrings how the game go
Billionaire status from this fuckin rap flow
Tattoed and I'm dealin with them white folks


I got a brand new rubber
Tell ya bitch I love her
Meet me at the hotel so I could shove a
Big ass  in her back
How you luv that?
Big dick down in the drawers is what I pack
Gold Roleys full of gems
Twenty inch rims
Big screen TV showin porno films
Rover, Jag, and a boat
Dinosaur boots wit the motherfuckin matchin coat
I'm dynamite like J.J

Damn, Damn, Damn is what the bitches say

I visit my mama grave 3 days a week
I ride Jag drop tops so she can see me
She shouts son be all that you can be
Stay on ya feet and keep duckin these white sheets
And play a different broad 7 days out the week
And I'll be watchin when you be on your all-night creep
Or rollin wit ya Rolex bezel on the city streets
Or when ya clubbin and ya huntin for a new freak
Ridin everyday on chrome and ya packin heat
Mama, I know you lookin down on me
But I'ma ball 'til I fall, fuck the industry
And cash million dollar checks wit my real peeps
And I'ma sag Uptown on this battlefield
And ain't gon' let no nigga take no food out my grill
And we gon' ball 'til we fall as we keep it real
Wit gold choppers, nigga you know the deal

Cause all I wan' do is play with hoes tonight
And my Rollies with my bezel speak through the ice
Let my Jag drop top speak through the gold headlights
Man, I'm on an all-night flight
Worth about a millie on a silly night
On the really, I'm worth about a hundred millie on a rainy night
Playboy and my game be tight
I wanna holla at my little brother L, he restin' in peace
My daddy Johnny, playa he restin' in peace
Or my momma Gladys or my sister Noreese
Man half of my family already deceased
But this baller life don't mean nothin' to me
Playa if I can't share it with my muthafuckin' family
I'ma roll with my heat and ride with my H.B.'s
And make all my hoes say the love me
Fitted hats, stayin' strap, Ree's on my feet
Ask 'Lac playboy if you don't believe me

When this nigga 'cross the street start talkin' shit
Tellin' all his jive niggas that my music don't hit
See I payed it no matter
Every album gets hotter, than the last one, partner
What's ya real reason nigga, for hatin' me, man?
Cause the bitch that ya wit', was datin' me, man?
You 'bout hoe shit
Keep it on the down low shit
Hoe broke and lonely, don't know shit
Usually Captain Kirk a bitch

'Til she say, ""I had enough shit""
I know ya bumpin' Cash Money, ya like Manny tracks
Got ya Sony CD pumped up to the max
You should be on Jerry Springer, cause nigga you the king of
Hatin' on niggas that's keepin' it real

Or duckin' these haters tryin' to visit me
Or the feds, want me to face 4 to 40 for conspiracy
Playboy this life is real to me
I'm rollin' Uptown wit' automatic artillery
All I can say is Fresh kept it real wit' me
But I know my lil B.G. could feel me
That's why I'm hollerin' Chopper City in my song nigga
And you wearin' earrings with bezels cause I bought 'em nigga
But you the reason why I keep it real with niggas
Juvenile came and formed this Hot Boy Clique
And Lil' Weezy I know you planted the seed
And when it comes I know you gon' name it after me
I owe it all to the Lord and to Suga Slim for savin' me
From these guns, round the white
And puttin' that iron on another nigga son
And tellin' me that I can be all gravy
And tellin' me that I could save this nigga Baby
And if you don't believe me playa I put it on that '99 big body Benz
And the Lord and My friends cause Cash Money out to win

How Should I Ride,How You Luv That? Vol. 2,1998,"Manny Fresh:
Everything on me, my skills pay the bills
Buy my momma a house and buy my daddy some hot wheels
I'm the number one pepper star, look at y'all
Hat to the back, make my way to the bar
When I'm in your town, bling, I'm gon' shine
Gimme the best bottle of your best (glub, glub, glub) wine
Can I have your attention, couple of things I'd like to mention
I stay in a big ass house wit' a big gold fence and
Wit' the Beemer, Benz, and a Trooper
Living room Supa-Dupa
Size, Suprose
This a big ass diamond, y'all go ahead and cover y'all eyes
Look out here I come, stunt man number one
I'm makin' airplanes outta fifties just for fun
The boat, the plane, the Viper man
The 4 TV's in the black Range
A black boy havin' all these thangs
Now how should I ride man
Baby:
Captin stunter, I ride with a Mack 11
Cause I'm a Uptown hunter, a big dope fronter
And 10 a ki still a number
I ride Rolls Royce Canisus
I took my main hoe out a Yukon and put her in a drop top Benzie
I got these bitches trailin' me nigga, cause I got a little money
Got these hoes wanna give me pussy cause I got a little money
But I got 10 hoes, all with golds
Wiot' my name tatooed on the back of they assholes
Wit' 20 inch rims, that's how I ride nigga
If you ridin' 16's don't ride beside me nigga
I'll give to my niggas, before I give to these broads
My block on fire, my niggas in heat
We clockin' a hundred G's a week
I boat the yacht, and a screen TV
And put my face on the hood of the muthafuckin' Humvee
So you niggas could see me
I'm bout to do somethin' dangerous
I took the steerin' wheel from the left to right so I could look famous
I wear 2 pair of drawers, wit' 2 Rolex watches
Wit' 22 bitches on my log nigga
I guess that's the thug in me
I lie to these bitches 7 days a week
I put that on my lil brother LD restin' in peace
B.G.:
They wan' know how I ride
Still get high
Wan' know how I cross and front the feds, still floss
I'm the B.G., in ya car, shit rangin'
I'm playin' cheddar cheese, Hot Boy$ ain't fakin'
Wanna hang wit' B and Slim gotta have 10 G's
Cause them niggas spend money like it grow on trees
We ballin' got cars from every company
Expedition, Rams, even a Humvee
Ain't that somethin' none of us over 25
Daog you think they really rapped and got Q thangs for 5
Now lil daddy you got a nigga fucked up
You could live for 'Burbs but nothin' but speakers on that truck
Ah hah, we floss all week man
Every night I got a different bitch under my sheet man
They see me in the drop Jag and get out the way
They know who it is when they see me in the Rover the next day
Cadillac:
Call it ghetto wrist nigga, wear filled with bagettes
Crushed out on my neck with the matchin' bracelet
Uh, cocked to the side in my 98 bubble eye
Put on your shades cause you can't stand it with the naked eye
Why, cause I'm a shinda
I got diamonds and golds that'll blind ya, blind ya
Get out my way cause I'm comin' through
Man that' 'lac in the Jag, yeah and I'm sittin' on 20's too
Livin' my life like I'm a millionaire
How many young black niggas you know wit' Rollies and Carliare
Wrist wear, niggafilled with jew-els
Now everybody wanna shine like CMR Cartel
Uh, Wodie, Put on your 'boks and your 'bauds
Uh, and put some 20's on your Benz so you can shine when you roll
We got the finest cars and the finest broads
Buyin' mansions on Washingtoners we take our garage

An they suck everything out of it then they catch it and swallow it

See me, I squeeze in between it, and then I leave it so greasy
When I come through in a Rolls Royce, leave them with no choice
But to hop up in it an just let me make they throat moist
Ruby red and vodka it just carry a nigga

Cause she was suckin a nigga dick so good keepin it hard
Lettin a nigga cum all over her chest and tongue
She was still-un, I spared her because her chil-drun
She was a ho she gave me head behind a building
Ain't sellin records but her mouth could sell a million
If you wanna take it there we can break it off
Cause yall pussy ain't gotta nigga tweakin at all

Nigga I don't give a fuck
When it's on, it's on
We got Baby, Lac and Stone
In this bitch
I'm a neighborhood superstar
I'll cook anything from a ki of coke
To a gram of that boyd
Niggas scoring Glocks
Like brand new Hot Boy Reeboks
On my blocks stepping 'em up
With grams and rocks
If anything been scoring from me
It was ten a ki
I let my l'il round hustle
As long as they score for me

Look if I pull up on the block
Knowing the set was mine
No more hand-to-hand contact
I'm known for supplying
Since I opened up this set 'chea
This how it's gon' be
Ain't nobody selling shit nigga
Unless it's for me

All I know is crack slanging and block hanging
On the corner  front the store
Doing my thang
These niggas know my game
How I do my thang
Water whip I can't do
But whole thangs I slang

Now I'mma pay all my foot soldiers
And tell 'em stay focused
And front all the street hustlers
And keeping 'em posted
That white and that blue car
We call 'em the law
And the dirt that my niggas do
Is done in the dark

Got l'il whodie running water
And we 'bout to cook these quarters
The twenty under the seat
For my son and my daughter
The water hot enough
Start cooking these quarters
These niggas want it hard
And I understand

If I pull up dressed in all black
With a boot in my mouth
Cause a nigga didn't pay 'Lac
And I know that he sold out
Put something in my street sweeper
And run in his house
Knock a hole up out his pa chest
And a tongue out his ma mouth

A ki stashed up
And I'm gettin' 'em all
I got a stash put up
For the drought in the fall

Hot Boys vacating the pop
Talk can back shit up
The Feds call my 'hood a Payday
Cuz it's packed with nuts
Ghetto rich money stashed
In the mansions bruh
I got them kis
Ten a ki from Fresh and Atrice bruh

I know niggas think bad
Cause the people ride fast
I got 5 strikes
I'm going out with a blast
Cash in your life nigga
When you playing with me
I'll give you work
Break ya off ya face B.G

Cadillac's the name I run with
So call me Seville
Push a platinum Escalade truck
With 20 inch wheels
Now the Jag you saw me driving
That's for everyday stuntin'
Loud pipes, big rims
So you can see when I'm coming

I don't give a fuck nigga
Ain't no rules in the streets
You know money come first
The other bullshit weak
I don't wanna hear no stories
About my cheese
You violate nigga
Your family gon' grieve

Headbuster Alva Stone
Ya heard me dog
And everytime ya heard my name
It was a murder involved
I just rap to clear my name
And smuggle bundles of that raw
Always rap so what you lames
Suburb and that car

Saratoga and I ride
I represent to the fullest
Ain't nobody pulling strangs here
Unless that I pull it
If a nigga put a hit out
Believe that I took it
In the cost Bible murders
Was ODing and bullets

All i know is gun slanging and head banging
Too many disrespected
And lived to sang it
Drop change like a motherfucker
Fuck them niggas
If a nigga outta line
Motherfuck that nigga

Type of nigga who'll bat a bitch
And then wait on her pa
Type of nigga who'll do a snitch
Broad day in the park
I'm one of them niggas that don't bring it
Still buy up the bulk
Like Rob Deniero, Rob Banks
And bang out with the law

Look here I come from the projects
And the ghetto streets
I'm cooking up whole thangs
'Till they hard like concrete
I fronted the O.G.s
A bag of that OZs
For niggas that don't know
I got something whodie

The same ol' nigga
Just a different game
Fuck bitches, tote heat
Things never gon' change
I'm the number one stunna
Nigga, Baby's the name
I like cooking crack
And watch how quick it come back

I rock a oyster-faced Roley
With the crust out bang
Ice cover the wrist whodie
Like I sprung my hand
I sport Prowlers, whips
With the T.V.s playing
Iceberg, Prada dick
Like here come the man

I'll pull up at Washington  Six
In a six
I'll slide out quick
Bet I could fuck any bitch

I push a lavender Porsche Carerra
Seat sprayed leather
The top goes off and on
To floss with the rainy weather
The seats they ain't customized
They made by Ricarro
A ruby red CL5
I'll cop by tomorrow

For catching me on the interstate drunk
Running the law
With a bitch in my lap
Tasting my balls
I don't like when they too much
Act like they stuck up
Leave Atrice nut up
I'll bat that bitch up

The king of the Nolia
I crowd both the wrists
Lock down slanging towns
Took the top off the six
In the club I be thugged
With ten topless chicks
T-shirt, Girbauds, Reeboks
In it

Killa, ain't no stopping it

Off top, can't pop this bitch
You know what I'm saying
Baller Blockin' you understand

Let Us Stunt,Baller Blockin’ OST,2000,"I got that work
(For sure)
I got that work, nigga
Hustle - death if you hustle with us
(I'll front ya, boy)
Cause I'ma put that work on your life, lil' one
({​too low to hear}​ if you're shined out with a nigga)
It ain't no secret

I'm that nigga, Baby
But my niggas, they call me Atrice
Every bitch I fuck gotta be above average
On another level, nigga - millionaire status
Just bought two mansions: one in Florida, one in Dallas
I'm a boss nigga
Buy whatever, don't give a fuck 'bout the cost, nigga
I like to floss, nigga
It ain't no secret: I'm the number-one stuntman
You come at me wrong, you'll be in the trunk, man
I'm a O.G. shot caller - Big Tymer
Cadillac, Hummer, Jaguar, Benz driver
Thirty-six-ounces-in-the-glove-compartment hider

Don't test the water - look, believe B.'ll ride

Nigga, I'm a millionaire
Tote two guns cause I've been there
Lil' wodie, you don't wanna go there
I'm fuckin' all these hoes

Y'all better believe!

And I'm tellin' the next rappin' bitch what's up my sleeve, wodie

Bitches say we stunt too much (much)
It's okay cause we can back it up (up)
Know you gon' let us do what we do (do)
Rock our Rolie, ride drop-tops, too (too)

(Look, look, it's a- it's a- a checkmate, checkmate)
Ain't it a bitch how I be stun'n - I know, but I can do that
I pull up, top down on a Prowler, they be like, ""Who that?""
Common sense should tell 'em it gotta be a H.B
Cause don't nobody stunt like them niggas from CMB
Baby had me reppin' since I was in the sixth grade
Cause niggas wonder how I'm eighteen and already made
I done been through it - from bustin' heads to doin' time
Now I'm on that level to where I got the right to shine
Me and my clique hit the scene - Ree's, jeans, and T's
Wrist, neck, and ears just shoutin' *bling*bling*
We be thuggin' to the fullest - stay handlin' hoes
Cause all of 'em the same: straight scandalous hoes
I ain't trippin' - they can ride in the whip with a nigga
But put your head down and donate your lips to a nigga
Tossin' bitches is a hobby cause me and my niggas share
Gotta respect that's the life for this Cash Money Millionaire


(What, what, what)
I know y'all sayin', ""Look here - what the fuck is that?""
A Space Shuttle, lil' daddy - made by Cadillac
Take that other shit out, and put Corinthian leather
Put a sun-roof top for sun-roof weather
They go, ""Whooooo!"", when I fly by they shit
They go, ""Oooooh!"", you diggity? Just don't quit
I like 'em one short, one tall, one a doll
I like 'em on their head in the bed against the wall
Turbo-charged dick slinger...
...pussy banger
...pain-bringer
Nasty in-and-out finger
See that girl that you're with - I did that shit
Any girl that you get, I'ma hit that bitch
Last year: helicopter playa - hello
This year: plushed-out, pimped-out Space Shuttle
You like gorgeous Lovely, I know you do
And if you're a real hot girl you'll let me fuck your crew
For real, though


Let us do what we do, let us do what we do
Let us do what we do, let us do what we do
Let us do what we do, let us do what we do

I've been blessed I thank the Lord everyday
For gettin' me from 'round these devils in these dark hallways
How the fuck you gonna help me when I don't care?
Niggas see me front it all - they just look and stare
And talk about how it should be and how it could be
Bentley in my basement - ain't nobody understood me
Take care of your people like you take care of your kids
'Cause money ain't shit when you don't know how to live
And niggas gon' pretend to be your friend when they ain't
You expect 'em to be there until the end, but they can't
Now, how many of you can say you're a real nigga?
Play the Prowler, but scared to go in the field with ya
You gon' know your nigga - he gon' be there, still with ya
Whether if it's talkin' or slingin' the steal with ya

You wonder why the cops keep circling, niggas murdering
I ain't never saw 'em before, tonight we twurkin' 'em

Niggas got on tank tops and a pair of Reebok classics
Pants to my knees cause the Glock make it slouch

And if a nigga whisper, pistols eat him up for dinner

Project bitches that tote gats
Niggas kicking the dope, but the crack done smack back

While other niggas playin' ball made a court in the driveway
Things ain't the same where I use to play
It's guns and broads
New cars, neighborhood superstars, and hoes smoking cigars
Lil' ones sitting on the car
Watchin' the bus hollering ""Them people comin!"" when that blue car pull up
I'm tired of catchin' cuts, and bendin' corners
I got that work got youngsters on all four corners
You got the quarters, and you got them halves
I got the quarter ki's, and Fresh got the slabs
Ten a ki is the price if you want a brick
And if you don't know that, nigga, tax the bitch


It's the return of the click-clackin' downtown pistol packin'
Y'all remember me from back in
The '89 era when killers use to wear mascara
And run through the court causin' terror
Random riot gunshots, government-issued Glocks
That's bakin' soda added with that odor now you got clatch pots
Niggas went from (?) to frozen cups
To catchin' cuts, to big ole nuts
Shorty, I been on missions
Jackin' niggas for Balley competitions
Stickin' guns in bustas' backs
Everybody, come out your Polos and your Zodiacs
But that was back in the days
See, niggas done changed they ways
Went from snug-nose-38's to hand grenades
Now it's a must that niggas bust back when they get cussed at
Or fussed at
Nine-millimeters, Glocks, pumps, riot guns, niggas can trust that


Y'all got to understand
We got this shit on lock, wodie
If you ain't makin' money you ain't doin' what you suppose to
I understand niggas kickin' in doors for 20-inch momo's
Whatever it take, lil' daddy
And it don't matter
If I get caught up in a struggle, I got to take mines
If you get caught up, you better believe it

I've got a medallion for my dick
Cause my dick bling bling
I heard you suck a beach ball
Through a hose pipe
I heard you also eat nuts
Till the early light
I heard you like to be tossed
Flossed threw down and kicked
Well you fuckin with the right nigga
Ol' bougie-ass bitch

I know you wish you could find a
Nigga with a dick like an Anaconda -Conda
I know you wish you could know a
Nigga with a dick like a big Cobra -Cobra
I know you wish you could go home
To a nigga with a dick like a Python -Python
I know you wish you could get a date
With a nigga with a dick like a Rattlesnake -Rattlesnake

I got this bitch in the back of my ride
I ask this ho when she want my suprise
A big dick like a cucumber in the eye
You know that ho still took that ride
I asked her had she been fucked inside of a Hummer
She say no...but I suck dick like a plummer
Draino swallowin everything I can fool
I like rockin ice and playin with these hoes
But sometimes these hoes will make punch um in they nose
Squirt um on they shirt cause she wouldn't swallow what I
Burst Curst the bitch out her teeth were in the way
Stupid bitch that bullshit hurts
I've been treatin' these hoes this way since the first
Slap on they ass
Hit um from the back where it hurts
Putting in work I done done my dirt
Im a dogg ass nigga
Never put these hoes first


See I like these hoes
Like these hoes then I leave them
Then let some old bitch made ass nigga retrieve um
I could turn a dike bitch back straight
Then worry these hoes till they lose hair, money, and weight
Say lil' Daddy
I'm comin to a neighborhood look near you
Y'all niggas lock up ya bitches, broads, and boos
Youngsters gonna suck my pickle till I'm old and wrinkled
I'm a go all till a a whole a ain't nothin' but a tinkle tinkle

Now some of these hoes like to be fucked in the ass
Some of these hoes won't let you touch they ass
Some of these hoes like to be fucked fast
Some of these hoes know they need to be treated bad
Some of these hoes need to be kicked in they ass
Some of these hoes been gettin they old man stash
Some I play bad
Fuck other nigga hoes fast
And if yo bitch holla Beatrice
I put that dick in her ass
Nine times out of ten
She suck my dick when I blast
All because these hoes know I gotta gold and black Jag",https://genius.com/Big-tymers-snake-lyrics

Leave a scar on your ho from the side of my shoe
Bitches gotten fucked up - I ain't never been cheap
All I know is bricks, money, pussy, and streets
Niggas hatin' cause my teeth lookin' like they piece
I done spent about a-hundred-fifty grand at least
Boy, don't make me smile cause I'll blind a bitch
Hoes shout when I pass - that's a Tymer, bitch
Don't pop up at the house, you might find your bitch
On my video tape - man, rewind that shit
And if my main ho flip, she get one for that
If she takin' private trips, her lip hung for that

Got a freak that I love down in Acetown
Can't remember how she look cause she keep her face down
One in L.A., two in New York
One in Chicago, stay in Hyde Park
Three from China
One in Carolina
Ten in my city
Six of 'em pretty
Lil' momma from Tennessee: drunk off Hennessy
I should've stuck her a long time ago, but she killin' me

I love this lifestyle cause I'm real with this shit
Been runnin' 'round uptown with the baddest bitches
Took a flight to Chicago to holler at my clique
Rollers, hustlers, and niggas who pimp bitches
My main man, Johnson, Big Man, and Shorty
I got to be here for my son and my daughter
Now five a ki if you're transportin'
My nigga hit a lick and bought a Range Rover
My ho went to the beef, but I don't know why, wodie

Turn it up
Turn it up
(Hook2x )
Ten ways to a G
Three situations - pay attention to me
 Yeah, yeah
 Ten!
 First, ya gotta go get the chips
Scope out the section, tell 'em, ""Go get the bricks.""
 Nine!
 Then ya gotta find a place to meet
You better bring your heat cause them villains ain't sweet
 Eight!
 Ya better let your chick drop to get 'em
And follow that broad to make sure them people not with 'em
 Seven!
 Don't bring (?) around your house
Cause you don't want that heat pepper nowhere round your house
 Six!
 See how it come back before you start
And if it come short bring back everything you bought
 Five!
 Wait, if lil' daddy on the street
Cut the cake, hit the hood the next day about eight
 Four!
 And if you can't move it all, call your dog
Jam him up, and tell him, ""Fool, me and you about to ball.""
 Three!
 Split it up - four quarters-a-piece
And if y'all do that everyday, that's fifty-six-a-week
 Two!
 When the money start comin', keep sellin'
Don't buy nothin' special unless you got good credit
 One!
 Make sure you put some money aside
And in a month call the man and tell him, ""Bring a extra five.""
(Hook2x )
Ten ways to a G
Two situations - pay attention to me
 Ten!
 Gotta floss everyday of my life
Forget the price - get the ice, hit the club every night
 Nine!
 Buy the ball, let 'em know you a star
When everybody come outside to see the dubs on your car
 Eight!
 They gon' hate - so keep that tool
Scratch off and holler out the window, ""Boy, I'm a fool!""
 Seven!
 When ya meet, take a broad to plug
And make sure that chic was the baddest broad in the club
 Six!
 Lay it down when you're comin' around - bumpin' the sound
Got the truck touchin' the ground
 Five!
 2000 Range Rover, you see
Leather, wood, television all over it, B
 Four!
 Watch bracelet - wodie, shop daily
Everything them wannabe's got, I played it
 Three!
 Two dice on the block - keep it real
Bet the house that's about two-point-five-mill
 Two!
 Keep cheddar - what you got, I can match it
Ride everything chrome, rock everything platinum
 One!
 Keep shinin' 'til it burn me out
But never ever let the money, baby, turn me out
(Hook2x )
Ten ways to a G
One situation - pay attention to me
 Ten!
 Tell a broad, ""Everything for free
You can shop 'til you drop, shorty, all on me.""
 Nine!
 Number ten ain't nothin' but a lie
Don't buy the broad nothin', and I'm 'bout to tell you why
 Eight!
 Sell the skank a dream bigger than life
And she gon' stick around for the shoppin' spree, alright
 Seven!
 Tell your broad you know me, and we jam tight
And you like what I like, and you gon' be alright tonight
 Six!
 Nine times outta ten I went out with the broad you with
But that shouldn't stop you from doin' what you do, slick
 Five!
 Then turn to her - tell her you love her, and don't laugh
And if I had a penny, baby, then you got half
 Four!
 What's yours is mine, and what's mine is yurn
And you got it right now -
And that'll leave a-thousand dollars to my tax return
 Three!
 At this point, if you love me
You'll make my fantasies come true
And if she say, ""What it is?"" -
To sleep with your sister and you
 Two!
 Don't love these dumb hoes - love yourself
And if you pay attention to this you'll have plenty of wealth
 One!
 I'm done, and I ain't got nothin' else to say
Cause I can't think of nothin' to rhyme with this shh..
Y'all have a nice day
 Ten ways to a G
 Good night, everybody
 Ten ways to a G
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 Ten ways to a G

What?
What?
Now looky here

Ten ways to a G

I gave you three situations
And ten ways to deal with it
You see what I'm sayin'
If you apply that to your everyday-life
Whether you slingin', you dig
Ballin'
Or playin' on broads
You, too, can be scraped
I said scraped - that's right - scraped
See what I'm sayin'
And these (?)
I mean, we gotta get together - marry yourself, man
Cause ain't nobody gon' care 'bout yourself but yourself
Know what I'm sayin'
Go marry yourself, go on a honeymoon - treat yourself
I mean, cause can't nobody cheat on theyself
You gon' be with yourself, but you can't cheat on yourself
You know what I'm sayin'
Man, that's ballerrific

But I bought myself a Hummer, my brother a Jag (For sure)
I'm takin' all the hoes, and I'm makin' you mad (Yeah)
You violate my household, I'm bustin' your ass
Is you listenin'?
Do you see my ice when it's glistenin'?
Cause if you're with that baller blockin', niggas comin' up missin' then

I need a (?) to get right up in my new Prowler
And put her lips tight on this pipe to suck out the problems
Need a Rolex with princess cuts all at the bottom
Need a kit with twenty-inches on the car that I'm drivin'
Went from dimes to quakes, to money like Bill Gates
Doin' a-hundred on interstates
In Hummers on thirty-eight's

Wherever it's poppin' - we stoppin'
But if it ain't hot then - we not then
Wherever it's twurkin' - we workin'
She got to be slurpin' - for certain

Project and hood rat bitch is who I like
A bitch that's 'bout ridin', and goin' on flights

I met this bitch in Cabrini Green - a nasty ho
Liked that dick from the back
And you could {​​low cough}​​ in her throat

A bitch that's 'bout hustlin' and smugglin' work
Head bustin' and thuggin' just like Turk

A wild bitch off Grave Street doin' her thing
Big ass, big tits, and she loved eatin' ding-a-ling

I need a black ho (black ho) - one with the braids in her head
Workin' with some ass that could give good head

Can't forget about this bitch up in Philly on Richard Allen
Freak-nasty bitch that's always swallowin'

Stickin' to the G-Code, Ree's, and Girbauds
Got hands and 'bout strappin', quick to beat a ho

Oops, almost forgot about Tasha up in the watts
A hot girl for sure that stayed drop-me-like-it's-hot


Bitch, I'mma be stun'n until the day I go (What?)
Bentley's and Hummers, and drop Di-a-blos (What?)
Runnin' with niggas that don't love no ho (What?)

Hey
Now, you know it's Lil' Wheezy off the heezy
Believe me - whoa
Hot like pepper, slidin' out the Kompressor slow
Me and your wife - slut, don't slam my door
Cut on the lights - look how the damn watch glow

Hold up, Wayne (What)
You know what, Wayne (Whoa)
I'mma get in this bitch and do donuts, man

Now wait, Bubble
You gon' make me go buy a Grape Hummer
And put my name in diamonds on the license plate, cousin

Went from cussin and bustin
Hustle from day to dark
Turned nothin to somethin
Introduced to stunnin
In my life In my life
I done caused some hurt
And I done did some good
Said I can't even when I could
I was stopped and tested fingerprinted and arrested
In my life In my life
Just say no when I really meant yes
I'm gon smoke all night til it hurt my chest
Slim told me over the years that shit gon tear up careers
In yo life In yo life
What'chu gon do when snakes come to yo crew
I'm a get on my knees and ask the Lord please
Separate good from fake and the love and the hate
In my life In my life

I mean fuck I done had a rough life you know what I'm sayin
B.G. lived that thug life
I done done it all in my life
I done done time
I done lived in group homes
I been on the third floor of hospitals
I mean it's just been a stuggle for me
But now I'm on top you know what I'm sayin
And it ain't to turnin back
And I take chances in whatever I do
Cuz if I don't take chances I don't see the life after all

The night in the Rover
When the niggas came over
You went out like a soldier
And I still can't get over
What fake bitches done done
Got me clutchin my gun
In this life In this life
I used to wonder why
All the good niggas die
Why some soldier gotta suffer
And mothers gotta cry
Why my daddie gotta lie
Cuz he don't even try to be
In my life In my life
Take care of your crib
Where you lay down and live
Forget and forgive cuz you done put it through some shit
Had yo daughter and yo son
Been down since day one
In yo life In yo life
What the fuck is wrong you don't understand this song
Tell yo momma you love her before she dead and gone
Nigga that don't quit that's some real ass shit
In this life In this life

Man I mean me Juvenile drugs tore my family up
I'm from the projects so you know I just realized
What it means to be successful
Cuz I been through all kinds of shit man bullshit
And I live through Baby, Slim and the Lord to help me
And I came to them as a real nigga
And I said look dog I'm tired of livin like this man

I had pounds of coke
I had money to blow
I had a felony charge
I had to fight in the court
I had warrant reports
Shot up cars before
In my life My life
I got kids to feed
I got niggas to watch
I need a hundred mil
I need to get off the block
Wear soldier Rees
In the gamblin spot
In my life My life
I could cook it and cut it
I could bag it and move it
I could toat in the budget
Got money to prove it
I done flood the public

'll do it

Ain't a bitch that I know that can say that I love her

Bikes, Lexus Trucks - everyday I be switchin'

Come 'round the corner once, leave, switch up, come back around
You know how it go down on a Sunday uptown
Wrist hangin' out the window of the Jag with the top down
Later on that evenin', corner pocket off the chain

I'm the number-one when it come down to the stun'n

Crocodile and mink suede
I touch y'all niggas' arms with candy-coated choppers
I fed these hoes fettuccini while you was feedin' 'em whoppers
I could take the ugliest bitch and turn her into somethin'
And take a whack-ass track and have that bitch bumpin'

I got one diamond, and one ring bigger than your whole future, G
Shorty, you ain't heard the news? I'm ridin' on twenty-twos
I take the groom bride and give that ho the blues
My neck on another level
My life on another level
Alright, you got a Benz - and, nigga, I'm pushin' the space shuttle
Bitch, please

It's a fresh package I got - why not move it
Keepin' it in the house 'll have the Feds locked to it
Business as usual is goin' on in the slums
We want the whole cake, nigga - we don't want no crums
Stupid shit - we avoid it
Dope - we exploit it
Had our shit tight bitches done destroyed it
Now niggas gettin' out lookin' for employers
Made a deal with the D.A. and the lawyer
Swearin' he would never tell - put it on his daughter
Sayin' he was outta town - nigga crossed the border
Should've bust his head, but I don't need the heat
I'll send another nigga out to handle beef for me
It's a test cause I've been given him a ki a week
Let me see what they gon' do up on the streets for me
And if he hand me his business, I'mma make sure he's straight
The only nigga out the project Magnolia with weight

Get our grind on in the project hallway
Nigga try to hit a hustle, they get burnt with a K
Hot Boys and Big Tymers - they surely don't play

Started out with a seven-gram quarter, flipped to half-a-ounce
Tryin' to keep clothes on my daughter and food in her mouth
It don't stop from sun-up to sun-down - I'm on the grind
In two weeks I was workin' a 16-25
Tryin' to get it - only thing in my vision is ballin'
Jumpin' out a 500-S class on brodders
So you only had a nickel like me hustlin' hard
'Fore I knew I was workin' four ounces and two quarters
Not a taker I'm scarred from (? ?)
Swore he was gon' front just bringin' his shit
Now I got a quarter ki - broke it down to six and two quarters
It's cooked already - I got these niggas runnin' like water
Slowly, I'm comin' up - scorin' a ounce since fronted nine
Had this nigga - only said what they workin', the block is mine
Got hustlin' skills in my blood - come from my pa
That's how I know the game cause at a young age I was taught

We hustle hustle everyday, all day

Brother, you my hustler, and K.C. my killer
Michael, (?), Curl, y'all lay back and peep these niggas
Dubbed all and wide open (whatever) whatever, my nigga
Big (?) grab the Glock out to shoot, my nigga
Then if it go down, I know you're ridin', nigga
But it's cool - I lost some hot boys, my nigga
But I'm a fool untamed by the children in this game
Tre, go grab them things, we gon' get paid, man
Joe Casey know a nigga wan' buy some things
I start in the hood, I keep it real with my goods
Lac, hurry up back, I know a nigga wan' buy some crack
Smack a whole brick on that bitch when it come back
Stone, you play the cuts and watch my back
Magnolia Shorty,
 take these stacks and meet me at the shack
I'm 'bout to go to a car lot on veterans, black
And buy that new black-on-black 2G Cadillac

Remember when shit was a easy task
Back in the days that passed
When bitches use to cut class
Just to let a dumb nigga hit that ass
Now everything fucked up
Sure virgin pussy gon' cost you a-hundred bucks
Nigga, that use to be the man shit outta luck
Young niggas walkin' 'round with that duck
Some say, ""Play with your nose.""
Some say, ""Fuck them hoes.""
Some say, ""You're fat. Work out and get a six-pack.""
I say, ""Fuck all that, I'd rather have six facts.""
Young niggas done drove me to pack a heater
Fuck drawin' up the meat beaters
They tryin' to defeat us
Move us out and delete us
Erase us niggas from the face of the earth
Put your dick in the dirt
No how, no way, daddy, it won't work
I refuse to be a statistic
DNA ballistic
With a closed casket
Cause some young nigga blasted my brains on the side

Oh 20 dub deuces that's how we do that there yo
If you ride with an ugly chick than trade that bitch in
Get you a dime that's how you do the damn thing friend
If your diamonds ain't shining that put that shit up
1-800-Iceman - ice yourself up
Cutlass to the Benz, Monte Carlo, and Prowler
DVD to the TV that mean you can HOLLA!

I say this on 22's that cost a half-a-mill
When me and Baby be coming through like ya'll rappers for real?
Now I be slinging blocks, totting two twin Glocks
Pushing a 600 Benz, rims spin when I stop
Jock, it's alright you see the watch ya'll like
Like I just copped a porsche box three tint with the frog lights
Than it's alright kit it with a chrome small pipe
With killer Stone on the left and Hot Boys on right

Nigga I ridin in some Z71 type shit
Limo tinted cause I'm creeping with a fine bright bitch
Aston Martin got a new thang that I just might get
And if Puffy give a party he invite my click
We gone pop that shit, say wodie where the bottles at?
Hello, who this is? Im with stunna bitch holla back
Princess and baguettes to out shine you cock suckers
Riding on some Ferris wheel's - Bigger than a mother fucker!

Rims - 22, chick - 22, dick about 22
Playboy, now who the fuck are you?
I'm mister two-door coupes
Is that the cracker-gator boots?
With the two piece Gucci suits
2-way hanging off the loops
Zazigga-zan, Zazigga-zigga-zigga-zan
Give me the watch, the bracelet and the chain
Fuck your Bentley - too slow ya heard?
Lamborghini in first ""clock, clock unnn unn skkkkiiirrrrrt!""

You know Mikkey play the Air Ones - loosely laced
So I might lose a shoe when the groupies chase
The coup be straight - but truth be I prefer the range
The sex be feelin great but I prefer the brains
We got dollars by the billions
Choppers by the buildings
Chances of falling off is ""Slim"" like ""Ronald Williams"" Holla
You can find me changing lanes in the Aston
Leaning back with your dame laughing come on (haha)

And I'mma dra-a-ank (I'ma drank)
Until I can't (until I can't) oh oh

Smokin hydro-phonic and I'm high as a kite
Sippin on some crissy on a Saturday night
Mind on my money and my money on my mind and I got
Freaks at the teley ready to, do a nigga all day all night

Drinkin on a bottle of that seriousness
Tell that bitch that you wit to mind her bizz-a-ness
Cause she'll be under the spreads
Givin me head in a Holiday Inn
Under the cover

We gon' drink, we gon' smoke, we gon' make us a porn

Now tell the TRUTH, ABSOLUT make ya wanna have SEX

Sunny Day,Hood Rich,2002,"Just like a sunny day, I'm gon' shine
You betta cover yo face, or you'll be blind
Oh big shiny blades, that's how I ride
Just like a sunny day, watch me shine

Hey, eh, uhn-uhn-ah, uhn-uhn-ah hold on, ro, huh
You see them chrome on dem whodi?
Oooh-wee, bad mother fucker, chrome pipes, and chromed out mufflers
Paint my cars, and dip these rods
Re-do the inside, cuz stunna gon' ball
Shine my teets, when I hit these streets
Call hot boy Elvin, to slide me a piece
Slipped it girl, fed her some gas
I buh-a burn, I buh-a, buh-a burn ya ass
Brawlers, bars, and marble's garage
Minks on the floor, with them platinum toys
Its 500 degrees, its hot as fuck (uh uh-a, uh uh-a)
Believe me boy, my shit diced up
I stay one way, I play every day
Its February 15th, stunna holiday

Now if you believe, like I believe
We can get to the mountain top
We can achieve what Martin was talkin bout
Whats all the barkin bout?
I'm a man playa, on my two feet, thats how I'm walking out
Alot of these chumps niggas say I just bling too much
But alot of yall ain't doing nothing, y'all just dream too much
And all of y'all niggas ain't coming up to nuttin but a big ole zero
And in case you didn't know nigga, I'm the hood hero

Just like a sunny day, I'm gon' shine
You betta cover yo face, or you'll be blind
Oh big shiny blades, that's how I ride
Just like a sunny day, watch me shine

Its like a sunny day, plus I'm getting money today
With no funny play, cuz I got the gun at my waist
And like stunna say, feeling like a hunter today
Million, mommy fine, but she got bumps in her face
But  it ain't nothing but a G thang baby
So I'ma hit it in the back of my Mercedes
We on dubs, its all love, this shit crazy
And Cash Money is the label that made me

Mikkey take em church, its on you what you take from this verse
We like a cedar, we just straight from the dirt
So its in us, we stuck, like its in us to
Cock that thing back and dump
Please, you don't want it wit us
Now they say money makes the world go round
But for the right price
Stunna said yo girl done with the opposite of up
More than music this is rap hustlin
This is money mackin and publishin
Death before struggling, thats shine daddy

Just like a sunny day, I'm gon' shine
You betta cover yo face, or you'll be blind
Oh big shiny blades, that's how I ride
Just like a sunny day, watch me shine",https://genius.com/Big-tymers-sunny-day-lyrics

Pimpin’,Hood Rich,2002,"(Hook)
	Pimpin is a alive, these niggas just jive
	I've been stackin and mackin since '75
	When I come thru in the Benz hoes tell they friends that
	Thats my daddy, daddy
	Pimpin is a alive, these niggas just jive
	I've been stackin and mackin since '75
	When I come thru in the Benz hoes tell they friends that
	Thats my daddy daddy

I don't ride white walls its vogues I'm mashing
But I'm +Hood Rich+ nigga tell ya bitch to ask me
Swang yo bend in that brand new Caddy
Seville four door slammed back lil' daddy
Throwing bricks in the cut like a nigga give a fuck
I spunt what you niggas spunt when I was coming up
Its the bling bling king worth mils with nuts
Scored that brand new Benz loud pipes 'em up
Got that Avalanche truck alligator in the trunk
Got the snake in the floor of a Bentley ""HEADS UP!""
Them white folks coming lil' dady ""HOLD UP!""
Shift it up the block for a nigga can pop
I'm a born hustler but a pimp pimp player
2-G and 2 its Big Tymer year
Doing donuts in the drop top with Cartiers
And I ain't met no nigga with more cars than this player

You don't wanna get it on
You'll get shitted on or spitted on
Reptile boots and suits thats fitted on
Got the bar up in the car with the dranks so I can sit it on
Peanut butter and wood, its still understood
That Im'a P-I-M-P
The M to the A, double N-I-E
Now put yo' feet up on that mank
Take a pull of the stank
And we can do it how it should be done
I treat a bitch like a ho, a ho like a slut
A slut like a nut cuz I really don't give a fuck
Now with a dick up in yo' throat can you still sing a note?
Well if you can say I'm the man with the superfly trim
Woah move away young dude you're ruining my mood
Straight mackin to the stackin money bitches and food
Caddilac Buritz big booties and tits
Got twenty bad bitches with the matching outfits
(Hook)

I was the man in kindergarden and a pimp in first
A mack in second grade by third it was worse
A made man in the fourth a don in the fifth
Had the teacher sellin ass when I touched the sixth
Seven eight and nine whatever they had was mine
From tenth to twelfth bling bling ya blind
Now I'm the money foldin phone holdin
Two way checkin home wreckin
Rent collectin weenie weckin, big pimpin
Love a lotta women, walk with a limp an'
(Talking)
""I'll have the snow crabs a bottle of uh um cristal
Some fettacinni and some um let me see what else
Oh and some shrimp..""

I'm a bird on crew in that Lexus coupe
I left the roof at home let the rain come thru
Don't cry now ma you know how it go
But since ya hair got wet lets smoke some 'dro
Get it right ma and put that Fresh mink on
Them CMC boots with the platinum thongs
I wear enough ice to sit on the throne
And if a nigga come close Im'a go back home

Lil Mamma,Hood Rich,2002,"Lil mamma you in third, you should be in first
Do your daddy and your mamma know the way that you curse?
Your lying bout' your age and giving up fast
They need to put you back in first you're moving too fast
When you shake it, shake it, shake it - you need to quit
When drop it, drop it, drop it - that ain't the tip
When you twerk it, twerk it, twerk it- that ain't the lick
When you pop it, pop it, pop it- that ain't the shit

See the story take place in the back of the club
About this shorty that I know and we gone call her ""Young Love""
See lil one like pa, he was the neighbor hood baller
Gucci and Lucci drove a candy Impala
One more thing I forgot to tell
Young one sixteen bro and she burning like hell
Yo my fault, Pa was 26
Now back to the story bout' the little lost chick
Your man got lil one in the V.I.P
With his hands in her pants going ""You're so sexy""
Your not dumb but your young, you'll believe what your hearing
You gone sex off the X and your hormones cheering
What's even sadder you don't even know what you're doing
Hey young world your whole life's ruined
But what you don't know gonna hurt you tonight
You didn't use a rubber and Paul ain't right

Lil mamma you in third, you should be in first
Do your daddy and your mamma know the way that you curse?
Your lying bout' your age and giving up fast
They need to put you back in first you're moving too fast
When you shake it, shake it, shake it - you need to quit
When drop it, drop it, drop it - that ain't the tip
When you twerk it, twerk it, twerk it- that ain't the lick
When you pop it, pop it, pop it- that ain't the shit (Poppa)

Man chill in Miami lil head in the projects
On the passenger side with Tammy in the drop Lexus
Me and Fresh at the light in S500 on dub deuces
Bumping some old Cash Money
Got 10 round my neck, 20 on my wrist
Million dollar nut, million dollar kiss
Pull up in the Lexus, sipping on Don P
Hold on Fresh let me get back to this story
Heard Sheila freak dealers that only drive Benz
Her mamma said ""My daughters gonna end up in the pen""
But wodie sheila fuck for ends and clothing
She thought she made more money from tricking and hoing
But when her nigga scored the dope she held the stacks
And when that nigga hit the club they be full of that yak
She a hard headed, with a diamond in her tongue
And a tattoo on her ass saying ""come get some""

Lil mamma you in third, you should be in first
Do your daddy and your mamma know the way that you curse?
Your lying bout' your age and giving up fast
They need to put you back in first you're moving too fast
When you shake it, shake it, shake it - you need to quit
When drop it, drop it, drop it - that ain't the tip
When you twerk it, twerk it, twerk it- that ain't the lick
When you pop it, pop it, pop it- that ain't the shit

Now Stone told me ""Stunna, Kisha wasn't right
After the Hot Boys had her I fucked the same night""
Now Kisha from Miami ran with Lisa and Candy
Met her at Coco's on the hot strip dancing
Now Trick Daddy told me bout' mom's new clique
But my lil partner Damian wanted to raw-dog the bitch
I'm a three stunna blinder, pop X with the chick
I'm full of the white trying to down this bitch

Slow it down, hold it up, get back to your class
Act your age lil mamma stop shaking your ass
Big wheels, X pills, whatcha know bout' that?
Got the old nigga name tattooed on your back
Bet your mamma don't know that you're fucking and shit
And ever since yay high you've been getting a dick
But it's your life and it's your biz
Four different baby-daddies, get how you live

Lil mamma you in third, you should be in first
Do your daddy and your mamma know the way that you curse?
Your lying bout' your age and giving up fast
They need to put you back in first you're moving too fast
When you shake it, shake it, shake it - you need to quit
When drop it, drop it, drop it - that ain't the tip
When you twerk it, twerk it, twerk it- that ain't the lick

But why can't you just get a new
Are you gon give me some?

What's wrong? what happened? You told me it was crackin'
I got my prophylactics, and why you trippin' on me?
I'm tired of playing games, its been a couple weeks
Hey ma I'm feeling you, you say you feeling me
I just can't understand why we can't get our love on
Girl I want it and quit, I want you to groan
Lets go to the Mo tonight, and lets sip a little mo' tonight
Girl don't say no tonight, you need to give me some

So why don't you be a nice girl and (Put it in yo mouth!)
Now things don changed, why you actin' strange?

Life is like a movie baby, stick to the script

I ain't tryin to take your man place, hes alright
I'm just trying to stick it to you baby just one night
Well I gotta buy something just for you to try something?
Yeah I'll let you get something just to let me hit something
Now I know your alone when he don't come home
Pick up the phone, now I give you the bone
When the kids asleep, then we can creep
I've been waiting to see you naked baby, one whole week
Time for you to give it up, let a nigga hit it up
Take in on or spill it up, swallow, don't spit it up

Oh when, oh when, oh when are you gon give me some?
Hey ma, hey ma, hey ma, when are you gon stop acting dumb?
Oh when, oh when, oh when are you gon give me some?

I think you just scared cuz you don't want me to leave (Thats what it is)
Are you gon give me some?

Now I've been fucking with you for far too long
And if I don't hit tonight, I know something is wrong
You've been duggin' and divin', just running scared
Like you committed a crime, and I'm the fed
Calm motherfucker over the phone
But a scary motherfucker when its time to get it on
You be saying freaky shit, really turning me on
Like you swallow n' spit all over the dick
And you be bragging about how them niggas is strong
But the word is out, I'm seriously hung
Right now I'm ready, cuz I'm full of that juice
I'm ready to get you in the bed, and knock something loose
And after that, the balls in your court
We can leave it alone, or we can go back and forth
But first things first, Ima admit
Ima tear your ass up when you let me hit

W,B,I,T,E,C,H, ain't that a bitch radio
Yo check, thats the new jam of the day
The Big Tymers featuring Wolf
Yo Wolf don went from the the keyboards to the mic booth
Wolf rappin now
And thats why you got your ass back in child support court too
Yeah she want some more money now boy, you gotta give it up
You can't go to court with no punk defendant
Why you need Johnny Cochran, you rolling with them Cash Money Millionaires
Now
Hey, big shouts out to Greg Green
This of uhh cases that concentrated titty milk
And big shouts out to all them ladies
Gettin ready for amateur night at the Flame
Yo check, if you not ready, stay your ass out the club",https://genius.com/Big-tymers-gimme-some-lyrics

It's the birdman daddy stick the gag in ya mouth
It's the, Boss Hog, known Big Dawg
The boss of the ghetto and I ball like a Dawg
You see that, four pound, ga-round, and round
Round banana clip and I shut your hood down
See I floss like Jewelry (stay broke like Woodie)
It's the number 1 daddy, look for carpet and pully
See I shine like feet, 23's for me
24's on the truck and leave on dub streets
See I wipe a bitch down
Then dribble on the ho
And touch her from her head, from her waist to her toe
Now buckle up Ma it's time to ride out
G-waggin' daddy , I keeps it down south
Escalade truck, in the back, and it's nasty
Cut it on the side, switch it out, and it's a Caddy
Chorus(2x)
Verse 2: (Baby)
Let me holla at these niggas that went out bad
They jumped in the magazine and showed they ass
But it ain't nothin' but stunna to bust a nigga ass
When I jumped off the porch, y'all were still on the grass (Biotch)
Nigga gave me a shot and gave me a gun
Fresh loaded the gun and told me have some fun
But A,A- the B-I the I-I
You motherfucka! (Fucka)
Suck a d-iock

The Fendi, the Louie, the Gucci, the berry
The swine, the mink, let's get it together
The prowler, the swade, the jacket, the leather
Headliner, rebot, tailor made sweaters
The guns, the pistol, automatic niggas

Chorus
Verse 3: (Baby)
I went from, teach to streets, to solvin' this beef
Nigga gave me my shot,  November the nuts ski

It's me Lac and Stone and all my kids
Ridin' round town in that brand new Jig (Woooooo Weeeee!)

See I'm world wide grindin' and I'm tryin' to live
You know how it is when you  got the kids

My People,Hood Rich,2002,"(Hook)
To all my peoples, to all my peoples
To all my peoples, yeeeaaahhh
Together we stand and divided we fall
If niggas get together then we all can ball
Live as one in the project and bump the sound
And eat chicken til the motherfuckin sun come down
We be lickin to the motherfuckin sun go down
Keep stickin to the motherfuckin sun go down
Get dough, and never go down
Never go down, never go down
 (First line overlaps hook)
Look look look
I say niggas stroke crosses to knock these bosses
We can ball together make money take loses
You know the game you gotta pay these cost-es
You win some lose some nigga regardless
Hang on the corner sell crack with straps
Or we can go to the club like pimps and macks
Or we can unite for stripes or just say fuck it
You get down bad bust raps for life
It don't matter to me daddy, you do what you do
I'd 'ave took pennitentary ?transit? to get this fool
See Im'a flip this money take it to the mall
And open up something and get more money
Like the beauty shop, keeps macs when Im thuggin
Hanging on the block watching for undercovers
Clean a little money, then clean a little money
The rap game ain't for everybody but try something
Hook 2x
 (First line overlaps hook)
See see see, check it out
My people need to get it right
We can either get together or we can straight up fight
We can shake hands or we can go to the gun
Divided we fall or we can live as one
You can fuck wit' it or you can leave it alone
And if you don't want piece bring ya jive ass home
And I heard the fake shit that you said in ya song
And I still love the nigga eventhough he was wrong
See, XXL will let you have the cover
If you say some fake shit about ya brother
Thats a petty-ass, spagetti-ass, fake-ass niggas
You don't know whats going on snake-ass niggas
But I'm.. not.. stoppin for y'all
Four 15's keep it knockin for y'all
If that don't work then nigga move on
Get the fuck good luck and I'm glad that you gone

Da Man,Hood Rich,2002,"All I ever wanted to do was be da man
Get out the ghetto and feed my whole fam
But the dirty streets in the city won't let me go (let me go, let me go)
All I ever wanted to do was be da man
Get out the ghetto and feed my whole fam
But quarter ki's make G's that's all i know (all i know, all i know)

A hit of crack frock could get ya fucked up
A ki of coke could get you rich
But too much of this shit can get you stuck up
That's why it's best to deal wit a nigga that you know and chill wit
Case he flip the script, you know where he live at
Plus, the game don' came a long way
Yeah we don' lost a lot of niggas that was speedin down the wrong way
See these days these niggas squeeze triggas quicker than yo boys
Cuz they got guns bigger than yours
Plus ain't not more coppin out
You either ridin or tellin, if you ride then you ride forever
Born the son of a straight killa
Raised by a strong woman, I'll ride for my homies
So, can a nigga get a boooonnnd
Or do another nigga have to come along and raise my daughter......son
Your Honor, answer this question and be honest
If you lock me up for the summer will you support my momma?


Ay ay, move on over (wooooo)
I sit and took over
2 clips, the AK holder
Brick taped to my bitch
Strapped on her shoulder
Raw grams in the trunk of a jag
Hard ounces stashed in my cadillac dash
It's drought season daddy, we huntin for riches
We fly like birds go divin for fishes
A known deep boy, the #1 Stunna
Got a hundred brick stash in the back of the Hummer
But on my block, a old tymer got shot
I didn't wanna do it but he was holdin my spot
I'm shittin on niggas, grandma got grams
She gave me a revolver, automatics get jammed
I'm *Hood Rich* nigga one feet in the sand
I'm one of a few niggas that beat the man


See, check it out, the dope game is a mother fucker, young man
I bet you yo lil ass ain't even got a gun man
You in the game now you know what you don' done man?
""Yeah, bruh but i gotta feed my son man""
A cutlass supreme, still a young nigga's dream
A solid lil bitch with a whole lot of cream
Well lil one looky here, who you scorin from?
Look, this some shit that'll leave a nigga body numb
Take that, the comeback is incredible
Get caught, then nigga it's federal
By the way, don't say no mother fuckin names
You listenin to me? Don't play no mother fuckin games
You know the rules of this shit
Fuck around and be one dead bitch
It's money and the power
Every second every hour
From sco' to the flo'
Bakin soda to the flour

This how we do it, where I'm from
I'm thuggin' in the club, until I see the sun

To let the ni-ine, sing out, it can ring out

Got one more minute, 
hold that call
Two drunk players leaning on the wall
Three crazy niggas screamin, ""alcohol""
Four more niggas claimin' that they ball
Five bartenders and they all want leave
Six ugly bitches with some fucked up weaves
Seven dyked broads and they all look rough
Eight niggas hollerin', ""don't fuck wit us""
Nine bitches runnin' off at the mouth
Ten bitches trying to hear what they talkin' about
Eleven cute shorties in the whole damn club
Twelve wannabe, gonna be, nothin' but scrubs
Thirteen fights, niggas, bitches and dykes
Fourteen police reading niggas they rights
Fifteen minutes on interstate-10

Jump out the whip, and we blaze in the shade
Cause I gotta get straight, got an ounce of that haze
Early birds don't play, makin' drops in the spots
We struggle, but we hustle, man we hustle 'round the clock
Goin' to the club, where the bottles gon' pop
We VIP nigga, so them bitches gon' jock
Laid Back on them 23s
Escalade all green, Cadillac lean, who that be nigga? (Hello)

One eye, big guy, hear that sound?
Slurp, slurp, take that spit (music stops)
Turn everything off bruh
Check out my outfit (music resumes)

I'm in the club smokin' buds with my thugs
Hoes show me love, and I never been a scrub
I'm walkin' out, thought lil' one had a grudge
She the one he love, so I hit 'em with a dub

I'm in an Escalade faded, waistline crazy
The yellow-gold stealth, faded
Got the chrome, nigga, plated

You can catch me in the club with a gangsta girl
When I ride, I'm gonna ride with a gangsta girl
When I smoke, I'm gonna smoke with a gangsta girl
When I freak, I'm gonna freak me a gangsta ...

I'm lookin for them gangsta girls
Not them fake ass +Wanksta+ girls
Just them ghetto fabulous girls, gotta keep 'em in my world
Mama makin gangsta moves, rollin with this gangsta dudes
Sittin on, spinnin 24's, openin my Bentley doors
Drunk at the party, hands up in the air but still she sexy when she shake her body
That type of chick that says ""hey girl, let's go to the after party""
After that we go to my room for the after, after party
Y'all know what happens next
Hypnotiq and a rated X, got her singin the greatest sex
Now on dubs, rollin up, into the club, raisin 'em up
Now we in the back, blazin 'em up (*inhale*), dice in hand, shakin 'em up
I need a chick like that to come and share my gangsta world (woo)
And if you in the club with hands up, you be gangsta girl

Oh yeah
I see ya
Oh yeah
Yeah


Ok, mami your so gangsta cause she fuck with nothin but gangsta (gangsta)
Type a nigga that a stank a gangsta
Drink Hypnotiq and she roll big body
And she got a body, that is gangsta hottie
And she fuck with nothin but gangstas that is old O.G.'s (O.G.)
24's on that brand new jeep
At a gangsta party, she'll be drinkin Bacardi
And she pops her body, don't you hurt nobody
Got my killers in here, they'll squirt somebody
But that Benz so fast, it'll jerk your body
And we smokin that Cali dro, totin that calico
Bird man and Kelly mami, let your body roll
No one will never know, what happen behind the door
I like it fast or slow, a freaky bitch fo sho
Street life is all I know, hustlin and stackin dough
I file to keep it gangsta, until my casket closed


Once upon a time in this place called hood
Where the gangsta girls shake it and they all smell good
Lived this legendary pimp (pimp) by the name of Fresh
Fix hair, fix nails, fix toes, fix breast
But one chick super sick, make every nigga grab his dick
Heart pound up and down, when she goin round and round
Do the +Snake+, stop and shake, ass like an earthquake
I can't wait to meet her uh, undress her, beat her up
Now we leavin from the club, and she let me cop a rub
Can't believe she choose me, +Feelin On Her Booty+
I'm about to cut like knives, strokin mami with some ice
Takin me to paradise, I nut once, she nut twice
Sex in cities, rubbin titties, that's how I get it
One more 'gain, with her friend, playa that's how I hit it
Now we grippin, grabbin, pullin, stabbin (what is your name?)
It's Hypnotiq how I got it, but I'ma glad that you came


Slim Teresa, and Lakeisha (they some gangsta girls)
Tanya, Wanda, and Laneisha (they some gangsta girls)
My fifty Kims all in Tims (gangsta girls)
A hundred shorties, all at parties (gangsta girls)
Full of drama, baby mama (she's a gangsta girl)
When they freakin on the weekend (they some gangsta girls)

Against the Wall,Big Money Heavyweight,2003,"Hey Fresh!
We back at it baby

Here baby doll, up against the wall
And through the sound, he broke it down
Only one more Hypnotic, and that's when he shot it
I'm not lookin' for love, up in the club
But I wanna go home with you, girl

(Manny Fresh)
I'm not your man I'm a pimp, baby please understand
But you hot, and they not, so we can hold hands
In a long truck, Cadillac
Surround sound, front to back
""Forever?  Forever, ever?""
Forever, ever black
Ridin' in the sunshine, crankin' up the Alpine
Rubbin' down shorty's spine, she is fine!
Love 'um, leave 'um, go back and retrieve 'um
If their hair is bad, then I will weave 'um
(Baby)
Kick back in the Phantom, two clips and a hammer
Cruisin' through the hood on them Deion Sanders
Nothin' but red whips and all them candy
Two chicks, two chickens that flew from Atlanta, aye
Laid back in a Maebach, countin' stacks
Got work, go to work, nigga count that
Summer shine, summer time, and we on the grind
Birdman got them chickens and they ain't flyin'

Here baby doll, up against the wall
And through the sound, he broke it down
Only one more Hypnotic, and that's when he shot it
I'm not lookin' for love, up in the club
But I wanna go home with you, girl

(Manny Fresh)
I'm cool, I'm hip, I'm fresh, I'm good
I'm diamonds up against the wood, richest nigga from the hood
Four amplifiers, four 24 tires
Fuck professional liars, fo' show enter our fire
In a big black Chevy, starch real heavy
Peanut butter reclinin', with the Steve Harvey line in
Look at me!
(Baby)
Let me slide and ride and get inside
And take you to my hood where it's do or die
Where the whips is clean, we hustle for nickels and dimes
Chips, green, the liquior was hard as a crime
Custom machine and 'dro be on my mind
Lace my team with life and bricks for dimes
Ghetto soldier and you can't stop my shine
Fresh, Stunna, bitch respect my mind

Here baby doll, up against the wall
And through the sound, he broke it down
Only one more Hypnotic, and that's when he shot it
I'm not lookin' for love, up in the club
But I wanna go home with you, girl

(Manny Fresh)
Sean Paul on the wall, break it down, do it girl
Lift it up, let it flow, shake it fast, there it go
Make it wobble, make it jiggle, put the pickle in the middle
Push it back, make it clap, in and out, that's a wrap
Good bye, so long, I got to go, I'm goin' home
But you my favorite friend, let's bump and grind next weekend
(Baby)
See you fuckin' with your boy, remember who gunna ride?
When trouble hit the hood nigga, who gunna die?
When shit get ugly nigga, who gunna fly?
But when shit get bubbly everybody wanna ride me
Benz, Lexus, the coupe, the jets
Nigga holla at the boy, baby pimpin' the flesh
Like in Stalled Evoy, third world is the set
I'm a worldwide shiner bitch, I drove the best

Here baby doll, up against the wall
And through the sound, he broke it down
Only one more Hypnotic, and that's when he shot it

I'm drink everything, I'm get drunk
Watch the shoes, I'm show you dudes, I'm bout to pop the trunk
I'm be captivator, I'm be calm
Hat to the shirt, to the pants playa WOAH
I'm play Polo, I'm stay rich
I'm bout to bust the southside in this bitch
I'm stay with Sprint mutha fuck Nextel
(Can you hear me now, I don't love no gal)
I'm eat chicken playa I'm sip lak
And push the old school Caddy with the Diamond in the Back
I'm get the candy paint just because I know you can't
Pussy, pussy, pussy your life is blank
I'm get the new J's smoke all the purple haze
I'm stick with game spittin', game spittin' in your face
 2x
Cause Im a mutha fuckin' southern boy
Coming down so clean, and with rhymes so mean
Heavy starch in my jeans
I want Criss, want hard, fuck a nigga, fuck a broad
You can't stop my southern flow
Cause I'm a mutha fuckin' southern boy

Look I ride the biggest truck
20 inches don't give a fuck
When I roll nigga know I'm plush
Coming round and I'm high as fuck
Green truck, lift up, spinnin' blades is a must
Wood grain, suede and leather, feelin' good with this Cali weather
I can go in any hood get a nigga they know I could
Coming round and I'm iced up too
Nigga know bout me and my crew
Laying low, being cool
Smoking weed is what we do
Moving ki's bought that coupe
Stacking G's is what we do
Nigga know that I'm slanging that iron
Fuck around trying to take my shine
Nigga know that I'm bout gettin' mine
Hustlin, flippin' when I'm on that grind
Nigga know we got work uptown
Fuck around and we shut you down
Pussy, pussy, pussy, you pussy pussy bitch
 2x

I'm pimping through the south holding my nuts
I'm in my candy apple red cadillac car rolling them dutch
White cuts with that stitch and tuck, lookin' for a bitch to fuck
Find a slut lil fifty buck, look like you need this dick to suck
I'm truck turner pimping, with Issac Hayes roll on
Just another pimp gettin' his stroll on bitch hold on
You staring at a pimp, tryin' to look him in his eyes
When you prctice southballin', if you get broke don't be surprised
Tell no lies about this mackin', some win and some be losin'
If you fuckin' with my paper, you cruisin' for a bruisin'
So let there be no confusion, pimping ain't no illusion
Don't believe me ask (?), she shorted my lil brother
She mutha fuckin' paged chose a pimp like no other
We all about that dollar bitch so when you see a pimp don't try to holla
Wipe me down and pop my collar

Big Money Heavyweight
Ay Fresh, We back at it daddy
Big Tymers, 03 Summertime boy
See it's summertime homie and we born to shine
Cadillac dipped grille with the nine on-line
Keep the ice on pack
With the big mac stacks
Rims dipped the same color of the new Cadillac
See we lace our ho's
We smoke our 'dro
When we go to the club we go through the back door
With the nine on my waistline (waistline)
Any nigga act up and get that nine to his fucking mind
Homies still doing time
Sending stacks through his mom
We get it through the pipeline
Flicks, so you see how we shine
Everybody know Stunna so you know I'm doing mine
Just a vision of dreams, and Cadillacs machines
Get loot, knock ho's if you know what I mean
Gotta hustle and grind
Keep the money on your mind
Summertime all hoods should blow up and shine
Hook - 2x (Tateeze) 
(Got everything they ever built)
(Everything they ever made)

(And all my cars gotta have spinnin blades)


Six years ago
A friend of mine
Said it's gon' rain before the sun shines
Some gon' lead, some gon' follow
Some gon' spit, some gon' swallow
Now where you going?
And where you been?
And what's your angle?
And how you fit in?
So this time I made up my mind
Fuck being broke, it's time to shine
Kiss my momma, tell my daddy I'm gone
Baby boy on his way to make a song
From a quarter, to a dollar, to a five, to a ten
You are witnessing
The rise of a young black entrepreneur
Spread my wings I'm about to soar
Two million, three million nigga I did it
Two billion, three billion nigga let's get it
Hook - 2x

See I'm the neighborhood baller
With the Beamers and Sprawlers
Then broads keep callin'
'Cause baby I'm ballin'
Hood rich chicks with these ghettos and bricks
Stunna back at it ma in that brand new Six
Stunna got that Caddy with the bubble-eyed lips
Fully equipped whips, the custom made shit
Now everything is wet and everything is slick
And everything is paid
And Mannie make the hits

Pimp if you scared get the new Escalade
The long mothafucker
Get the headline of suede
This is shining at it's best
Nigga wear your vest
Southern ass nigga with his shirts and jeans pressed
I like 'em starched heavy
Big block Chevy
Head till I'm dead from my old girl Debbie
Don't try it, buy it
If it's factory, amplify it
Might go Nitro, ignite it

I’ll Take You There,Big Money Heavyweight,2003,"Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there
Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there

Tell the sister like blood, little brother a thug
And how to survive the cracks in the middle of the mud
I'm the OG gangsta VL in the truth
Every nigga, in my city know how to tussle and shoot
My lil' homey got killed over a key and a pound
So when I pump, pump blood I'm a hold it down
His sister and his moms when I come around
Showin' love to the family when ya' lose your ground
Wassup lil' man had to write you a rap
Just to let you know this nigga, still got yo' back
Ain't too much change still doin' my shows
Stayin' away from fake niggas, and busta ass hoes
But enough about me and everything in my world
Congrats lil' dad heard you had a lil' girl
If theres anything they need and they ever in a jam
Don't hesitate to ask y'all call ya' Fam
Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there


But can you see life roomin' with no crack and pipe
And no weed to smoke no Gs in sight
And no cris to bust no wheels on bikes
And no pussy to fuck nobody to like
But can you see life roomin' with no money and goods
Big money heavy weights with nobody to cook
Nobody to book nobody to look
Tryin' to get back what motherfuckers they took
All you see is that platinum shit
A ghetto nigga, on stage grabbin' his dick
But you don't know what I have seen
From the bitches to the riches, to the triple beams
The project bricks the old school kicks
The early mornin' capers and the late night flicks
But since I moved on things ain't the same
I chose rap you chose the game


Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there
See your mom still strugglin' you up in the pen
But mom just wonderin when the end gon end
When the guns gon stop from spinnin' the bin
Or when the hood gon block the dope in the pen
Or when the light shot out you up in the park
The white trunk out your homey got marked
Or every nigga, that talk or rat in his heart
Or every nigga, that talk should die in the dark
I never forgot you and what we did
And how we came up and where we lived
I'm seven forever turn coke to never
Hard head 'til I'm dead until I'm 'bout my cheddar
Gotta get my ends wanna push a Benz
Eat steak live great and raise my twins
I can't believe I'm talkin' to ya' now that ya' gone
I luv ya' bruh and this is my song",https://genius.com/Big-tymers-ill-take-you-there-lyrics

Bringin back the era of the criminal

Got killas so basically I'm doin my own thing

It's kinda hot outside niggas done shot blue eyes
That's fucked up cuz my connect dropped me 5

I eat at Benihana's like five times a day
And if you don't do the same you just must be broke and lame
I'm gone brag on all my money and all the chicks I got

Fake ice in the watch I can't tell the time that's passed
I got more belts in me closet than a Kung Fu class (Waah)

And you can see me diamonds when I got me mouth closed (Bling)
Time flies when you ballin' so everywhere I'm late

Drag him from the river dump his body in the yard (Amen)
Note around his neck saying get right with the Lord (Amen)
Note around his neck saying get right with the Lord (Amen)
Get right with the Lord, get right with the Lord

Hundred, thousand, in a briefcase
Orange Lamborghini Urus with the dealer plates
Told these, hoes, I'll be right back
Another hundred thousand spilling out the backpack
I, do the, whole, dash
Sideways on these bitches bout to act an ass
Bricks, pounds, pills, weed
Went to Hiroshima came back speaking Japanese
Sushi, uchi, nigga dressed in Gucci
Xany pills got me feeling like I'm super 
Send him, back, to his, momma
A hundred bullet holes, first 48 dropped him
This that real project shit that these niggas wanna hear from me
Real trill bitch do a pull-down, hit a lick for me
Clearing out your block fuck yall 9mm

Hundred G's get a hundred hoes in your lap
Lamborghini with the red blood on the floors
Suicide, suicide want some mo
Cash, money, big, mansion
Nigga, hate, holla smack em
Third ward told me fame came with the drama
Top floor seat so I put it on my mama
Rest, in, peace to my daddy
Seven three billion streams nigga had to have it

You Can’t Break Me,Hardball (Music From The Motion Picture),UnKnown,"Ahhhhh
True Story
Fo shoeezy

Who rock shit that you neva seen befo?
The charge goes to me, then Mike, then the store
Two way beepers with built in speakers
Three inch woofers one inch tweezers
The one and only
Mac like roni
Sharp like my bitch and pretty like Tony
Trucks big leather room table beds
(cat meowing)Siberian tiger spreads
The call me Emmit cuz I only ride twenty two's
Emmit Smith numba twenty two get it dude
Smoke so much body smell like... WEED!
Get cut Cristal is whut I.... bleed
Got money then bitch come early
Got a Benz that come out in 2030
Cardel frames that make me look nerdy
Now who's the baller now WHARDIE!

Go on hate me
You can't break me
Usta ride new shit but not none lately
Wassup nigga? still ride old schools?
84 cutlass with the European light fools

Give me a dove and watch how I flip the bitch
One, two, three, four, five slick
Uno, dose
Bentleys and Rovers
Jags, Hummers, Rags its over
Put the kit up nigga lets break it down
Hit the curb bust the tires Im fucked up now
Whip my wheel twenty inches
Catch my thrills I've been pimpin
Look ice my life
Fuck what's right
Twenty on the four wheel will fit it tight

Usta ride new shit but not none lately
Wassup nigga? still ride old schools?
84 cutlass with the European light fools

Look

Steering wheel on the right
Bubble eye eggshell with the extra pipes
Rich nigga I got money to buy an extra life
Now I'm gonna mind hell tryin to live trife
So its my life to life with three strikes on me
With a four five on my six to get the lights off me
Like I'm a seven figga nigga drinkin ice on me
And for eight to nine years ten been the price for a key

I got some shit
Why not stunt?
This is much bigger then broke niggas with gold fronts
Big rocks in my watch like 'Montz got
Quarters on my trucks and a Hatch full of punch
Got a Bentley and a Jag nigga
With some twenty inch Mag nigga
License plate says bad nigga
Got a new bike chromed and stretched
Got a 50 for my son that I love to death

Go on hate me

Good Friday,Next Friday (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) ,UnKnown,"Hoo Bangin' and Cash Money Hustlin' every Frday

Got a package on Wednesday, Thursday I broke it up
Now Friday done came, today we cookin' up
Ain't gettin' loaded nigga, no time for fuckin' up
I'm breakin' niggas of with bricks from hust-a-lers
The hood done changed cause niggas is comin' up
Ya short me, I'mma have to blow your hood up
The feds on my ass but I need my change
So I could ride Hummers, Jags and Bentleys man

It's that day, phat day Kidnappin' and gun play
I need my riches from you bitches and I can't stay
Now that the flavor that I savor neighbor, 20 inch thangs
Rag on my head, white T-shirt and bagette chains
Mac like roni the one and only
Nigga Puff like Daddy and I'm pretty like Tony
Friday, lie day, tell the lil nigga I'll pay 'em
And when he come up with the product, ya'll niggas spray 'em
Now why they Had to do me on Friday
Chorus: B.G. (2x)
It's Friday, nigga on the block straight shinin'
Runnin' a bitch down, tryin' to get it I'm grindin'
Sellin' 2 for 1's what ever nigga I got it
Them checks came out so the set straight poppin'

Listen, listen, listen, la
Weezy-We, movin' 20 ki's a week
On a good friday it's like easy street
Breakin' down whole chickens, to quarters and halves
You gould get it harded than slabs or softer than sand
If you come around my court nigga
Ask for the short nigga
Not on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I be duckin' the law nigga
You know I got that raw nigga, bags to bricks
Whole things goin' for 10 and ounces for 6
Look it's iceberg nigga expect the worst
Friday done fell on the first and I got that work
And if I fron the whole thing, I'mma ask for 11
If I front a half a thing, I'm taxin' ya 7
Cause I gotta ride dubs nigga when and where ever
A CMR standard nigga got a flosser Kompressor
I got a extra 223, and my pockets to spend
And on the next Friday, I'mma do it again
Wha


Man first it was a hard night
And that was good Friday, I got to duck 'til I'm special on the hard white
I'm ridin' 20 inches, flossin', stay shinin'
I'm the boss, I get chickens at cost and stay grindin'
Don't make me put on the bass and so I'm bout to start hoopin'
I'll remake 2 out a 1 so I can get hootin' and recoopin'
My game gettin' strong and my profit gettin' long
I bust the whole chick down and sell it all in zones
Try to beat me or cheat me and get your shirt stained up
And run for pop those hollows towards the door and freeze your brain up
All hustlin' hit the stores and turn the flame up
Left the water bubblin' and rocked the caine up
So Baby, you Wayne and Fresh y'all get the machetes
Put it in B.G. cook it and y'all chop it when it's ready
And when you come to my hood and you lookin' for them thangs
Mack 10 is the name on the Caddy door now what

Why they

You can do big thangs when you're a Big Tymer
And even if you ain't nigga just keep grindin' nigga
You really ain't got to have golf balls you can have pebbles
Ya know? Just have your game on

Lac: If your riding on 16's than put that bitch up
Mannie: Oh 20 dub deuces is how we do that there yo
Lac: If you ride with an ugly chick than trade that bitch in
Mannie: Get you a dime that's how you do the damn thing friend
Lac: If your diamonds ain't shining up than put that shit up
Mannie: 1-800-Iceman - ice yourself up
Lac: Cutlass to the Benz, Monte Carlo, and Prowler
Mannie: DVD to the TV that mean you can HOLLA!
(???????) the house and somethin'
Bought a green diamond - 30 carrots for stuntin'
I'm the boss of your ghetto, black crow of this game
Slide me 200 G's and I'll do anything
I've done a little bit of it all
Mom how your son is known to ball
I put 22's on everything I call
The Jag, the Bentley, Rolls-Royce, the house wall
Hung out with Bobby, ate breakfast with Whitney
Made it official New York is my city nigga
Got a trophy from the game ya'll know my name
Baby - Number one stunna, car showing my thang
Got a house on the lake I built from cake
Cooking pies and hustling for rubian flakes
I put dub deuces on the Avalanche truck
I break rules cause I don't give a fuck

I say this on 22's that cost a half-a-mill
When me and Baby be coming through like ya'll rappers for real?
Now I be slinging blocks, totting two twin Glocks
Pushing a 600 Benz, rims spin when I stop
Jock, it's alright you see the watch ya'll like
Like I just copped a porsche box three tint with the fog lights
Than it's alright kit it with a chrome small pipe
With killer Stone on the left and Hot Boys on right
Nigga I ridin in some Z71 type shit
Limo tinted cause I'm creeping with a fine bright bitch
Aston Martin got a new thang that I just might get
And if Puffy give a party he invite my click
We gone pop that shit, say wodie where the bottles at?
Hello, who this is? Im with stunna bitch holla back
Princess and baguettes to out shine you cock suckers
Riding on some Ferris wheel's - Bigger than a mother fucker!

Rims - 22, chick - 22, dick about 22
Playboy, now who the fuck are you?
I'm mister two-door coupes
Is that the cracker-gator boots?
With the two piece Gucci suits
2-way hanging off the loops
Zazigga-zan, Zazigga-zigga-zigga-zan
Give me the watch, the bracelet and the chain
Fuck your Bentley - too slow ya heard?
Lamborghini in first ""clock, clock unnn unn skkkkiiirrrrrt!""
You know Mikkey play the And Ones - loosely laced
So I might lose a shoe when the groupies chase
The coup be straight - but truth be I prefer the range
The sex be feelin great but I prefer the brains
We got dollars by the billions
Choppers by the buildings
Chances of falling off is ""Slim"" like ""Ronald Williams"" Holla
You can find me changing lanes in the Aston
Leaning back with your dame laughing come on (haha)

Tryin 2 Make A Million,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Do you know what this ballin is, I'm talking bout marble floors
Tricks in private jets, hoes behind Rover doors
You talked about me bad but what you doin
Nothin but walkin round tha projects shoo-shooing
Get mad when I flash tha karats don't want to see me have it
I guess tomorrow I'll be smokin a 'gar in Paris
My cellular ring, ok let's pick up this change
Beeper blowin up, I'm lookin down at tha game
I'm steady changin cars so tha feds won't mess wit me
Park tha Q 4-5 and hop in tha Cherokee
At about 8:30 I'll be rollin in a millennium
Sippin on condact on my way to my condominium
Been rollin livin lavish, eatin in commanders palace
Bitches attracted to tha savage
Where niggas is chillin, sleepin in tha Royce and tha Getta
My girlfriend is my berretta, I never left her
What you know about them Beamers and Moe-Moe's
Them Lexus 4-doors and them '97 Volvos
Hell I might as well buy me a castle instead
And get fed some grace by Miss USA

How can I make a million?
Without tha feds investigating my building
I know niggas gone try me, I'ma have to kill them
But I'ma keep on makin money up until then

Golds and hoes, niggas doin videos
My everyday wear is Reeboks and Girbauds
Young nigga look I'm smarter than Russell Simmons
And I got more money than tha average nigga
I done sold coke nigga, I done hit blocks
I done sold rocks, tha cheap shit had to stop
I had to be tha biggest nigga on VL block
So I bust open me a quarter ki spot
Two G's a Q-P, now my block is hot
A hundred G's a week nigga, so I couldn't stop
Now I done stole me a few ki's
I'm tha only young nigga Uptown frontin Q-P's
You don't believe me ask Joe Casey
My background coke history speak for me
Diamonds and gold all across tha T-O-P
And all these hoes wanna ride in my Lexus Jeep
If it ain't cheddar or cheese it ain't gravy
And these car stealin hoes stay up off tha street
And these playa hatin niggas need to stop passin through tha UPT
And all my new hoes gone ride in my Hummer
But I got a top of tha line bitch beside me
And if a nigga fuck up my ho gone ride for me
See I'll put change on my own brain
Bitch I spent 50 G's bullet proofin my Hummer man
25 G's on Fresh's Suburban nigga
We all pack vests nigga, I know you heard me nigga
Big Rufus got a Tec and a Lex and he flexin
And if a nigga disrespect God gone have to bless em
And let his mom dress em cause it's all good
It's all gravy, bitch nigga stop playa hatin


I done did more hoes than Michael Jackson done shows
I done made more money than Tommy sale clothes
I don't think that you can umout shine me man
You need to um stand behind me man
Come through this bitch lit up like December
Givin all these pretty hoes something to remember
I'ma nigga wit some endangered specie boots
Spillin crystal on tha floor oppps
Picture me and yo old' lady butt naked and shit
She drunker than a muthafucka, suckin my dick
I just gave yo ho a hundred for her trouble
And I'm telling her we can bade in Moet bubbles
Separate my money, and then
