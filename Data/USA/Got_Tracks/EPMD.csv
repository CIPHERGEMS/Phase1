Da Joint,Back In Business,1997.0,"I make a million...bucks
Every six months and y'all
Hating my game, saying my name, they call
Me the E, wrong things
Knowing I'm fly without wings
While some of y'all have to pull strings
In this era, I maintain the freak upon the beat
Master basslines of Raphael Saadiq
Lyrical mastermind, a genius so don't snooze
No mission's impossible, ask Tom Cruise
I keep a joint lit
When I have to spit
A rough paragraph
Laugh, when I'm bustin' your ass
Who want it?
Come and see me, like 112
And I'll rock that bell with Fox and L
E-Dub, Mr Excitement, right
The poltergeist of rap so come to the light
Yes, the recipient of this award goes to moi
The best qualified superstar

It's the joint
Stay on point
Plus I'm feelin' it
Niggas killin' shit tryin' to duplicate the manuscripts
That's impossible, pray like the gospel
Overcoming setbacks, and jumping over obstacles
Like Evel Knievel
On point like a needle
EPMD's like the Beatles, back with another sequel
To hip-hop, check one two and you don't stop
Rap with mainstream R&B and pop
Now the world's shocked
The E-double's back with Mic-Doc
Like it or not
We ’bout to turn it up another notch
Mach speed
Put it down for my seeds
Raw breeds
Acres with the deeds
It's the joint

I got a Benz too, and it's black like that
I got millions of chips, and they stack like that
A five year spread, and now we back like that
How dare they, niggas sittin' in they room with Brandy
Way pissed off thinkin' how the can't stand me
He robbed Sean for his Penn, talkin'
Not lookin', shooken, a dead man walkin'

You know me, from rippin' flows with my homie
The one and only, Ginuwine like Pony
You wanna ride? Call me up when you're lonely
I'm Parrish Smith, the shit—great like Tony
I'm hittin'-hittin' (Where from?)
From Brentwood to San Quentin
I'ma keep rhymin', still representin'
(For who?)
For my niggas up north and in the courts
And for the MCs takin' no shorts, in this blood sport

You Gots to Chill,Strictly Business,1988.0,"You gots to chill
DJ K La Boss cuts 
""Jungle boogie""

Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
And get down to the sounds of EPMD
Well you should keep quiet while the MC rap
But if you tired, then go take a nap!
Or stay awake and watch the show I take
Because right now - I'm 'bout to 
shake and bake
The E-R-I-C-K is my name, I spell
Thanks to the clientele, yo I rock well
I'm not an MC who talkin' all that junk
About who can beat who, soundin' like a punk
I just get down and I go for mine
Say ""check one-two"" and run down the line

To the average MC I'm known as The Terminator
Funky beat maker, 
new jack exterminator
Destroying a ploy, when your rhymes are not void
Never sweatin' your girl (Why P?) 'Cause she's a skeezoid
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot
I grab the steel with the crown on top
In the beginnin', I like to let my rhymes flow
And at twelve I press cruise control
Sit back and relax, let my rhymes tax
Maintain MC's while the Double E macks
Always calm under pressure, no need to act ill
Listen when I tell you boy

You gots to chill
DJ K La Boss cuts 
""Jungle boogie""

I be the personal computer information on rap
Like the B-I-Z Markie says, I'll make your toes tap
I format the rhymes, step by step
Make em sound def to maintain my rep
Prepared to come off, in case of a diss
Not worried about a thing, 'cause we can do this
I can turn the party out just by standin' still
Make the ladies scream and shout while the brothers act ill
Take total control of your body and soul
Pack a nine in my pants for when it's time to roll

I'm the P double-E M-D-E-E
And one thing I hate, is a bitin' MC
When I enter the party suckers always form a line
Then they ease their way up, and try to bite my lines
I did thousands of shows, dissed many faces
And deal with new jacks on a one-to-one basis
But every now and then a sucker MC gets courageous
And like an epidemic it becomes contagious
But never the least they all R.I.P
For all those unaware it means Rest In Peace
'Cause M.D. -- stands for Microphone Doctor
And the capital P (capital P) capital M (capital M)
Capital D-E-E's no doubt the chief rocker
Don't like to get ill, but if I have to I kill
So believe me boy

You gots to chill
DJ K La Boss cuts 
""Jungle boogie!""

Catch every word I'm sayin', no there's no delayin'
Don't hesitate to motivate the crowd I'm not playin'
Seein' is believin', you catch my drift?
Don't try to adapt because I'm just too swift
(How swift?) I'm so swift and that's an actual fact
I'm like Zorro, I mark a E on your back
I don't swing on no ropes or no iron cords
The only weapon is my rappin' sword

Intimidate MCs with the tone of my vocal throne
When I'm pushin' on the microphone
'Cause I'm the funky rhyme maker, MC undertaker
The one who likes to max and relax
And when it's time, issue dig-em-smacks
I keep their hands clappin', fingers snappin', feet tappin'
When it's time to roll Uzi patrol is packin'
The PMD, the mic's my only friend
And through the course of the party, I kill again and again
So if you're thinkin' bout battlin' you better come prepared
Come with your shield and your armor geared

Strictly Business,Strictly Business,1988.0,"I shot the sheriff
(""Don't get too close because you might get shot"")
I shot the sheriff

Try to answer to the master or the MC rap God is no joke
On the lyric - it's hard to be modest
I knew I was the man with the master plan
To make you wiggle and jiggle, like gelatin
Just think while I sink, into the brain structure
(Don't sleep on the E) You see, somethin' might rupture
It don't take time for me to blow your mind
Take a second to wreck it because you're dumb and blind
So just lounge.. cause you're a MC clown
Go join the circus.. EPMD's in town

Total chaos -- no mass confusion
Rhymes so hypnotizin' known to cause an illusion
Like a magician.. who pulls a rabbit out a hat, son
I pull them all like a .44 Magnum
MC freeze stop look and listen, and try to imagine
It's travellin' the speed of light, but everything's motion
Is frightening.. plus the thought you alone
You now enter dimension, called the Twilight Zone
You're terrified.. plus you can't bear the thought
You and I one-on-one, 
in the Land of the Lost
You start to shiver.. but then you scream, my friend
Yo, wake up Muttley, because you're dreamin' again
But next time I'm on the scene, do not try to diss us
Keep your mouth shut sucker duck, because I'm Strictly Business

I shot the sheriff

This is the rap season.. where the E starts pleasin'
Girls around the world no need to be skeezin'
When I roll I stroll, cool always pack a tool
Just in case.. a brother acts a fool
I've got the energy, to put the girls in the frenzy
Put it in shock when I rock, give it up I'm not stingy
Make sure I don't bore when I'm on the dance floor..
(Get busy, boy) Like you never saw before
Rhyme flow.. good to go.. after the show.. I'll pull your ho, boy
Rhyme flow.. good to go.. after the show.. I'll pull your ho, boy
Rhyme flow.. good to go.. after the show.. I'll pull your ho, boy
Rhyme flow.. good to go.. after the show.. I'll pull your ho, boy
(Yo, you sniff blow?) .. Hell no!
I got my whole life ahead of me, no time to be sniffin'
And my parents find out, then they start riffin'
So I stay, a-okay, cause I'm the E.. the R-I-C-K

MC's look me in my face, then their eyes get weak
Pulse rate descends.. heart rate increases
It's like beam me up, Scotty, I control your body
I'm as deadly as AIDS when it's time to rock a party
And all due respect, when I say mic check
Let a sucker slide once -- then I break his neck
So when I say jump, you reply, ""How high?""
Because I'm takin' no prisoners, so don't play hero and die
You're just a soldier.. and I'm a Green Beret
I do not think twice about the MC's I slay
So if you want to battle, I highly recommend this:
Bring your dog, mom, and dad.. because I'm Strictly Business

I shot the sheriff

Yo yo, you're still pickin' on that four-leaf clover?
Bring in the Sandman, sucker.. because it's over
My name is Erick Sermon and I'm back again
I see the heads still turnin' and my so-called friends
They smile in my face -- behind my back they talk trash
Mad and stuff -- because they don't have cash
Like the E-Double.. or the PMD
He drives a Corvette, I drive a Samurai Suzuki
I'm a locksmith.. with the key to fame
Never high on myself -- always stay the same
Play a lot because I'm hot, like a horse I trot
Around the track and back -- fatigued? No, I'm not

Well I'm the mellow, the fellow, the one who likes to say hello
To a fly girl that is good to go
With the slow tempo, and the off-beat rhyme flow
Cause when I am in action, there is no time for maxin'
Or relaxin' -- just reactin' and subtractin'
On a sucker MC who mouth keeps on yappin' and flappin'
I lose my cool, then I'll start slappin' and smackin'
You wanna roll? Then Albee start jackin' and cappin'
No time to lounge, I'm packin' and strappin'
At my point of attack I soar at you like an eagle
I'm the sheriff, and bitin' is illegal
So next time in town, I highly recommend this
You gots to chill, because I'm Strictly Business",https://genius.com/Epmd-strictly-business-lyrics
You’re a Customer,Strictly Business,1988.0,"Knick knack patty whack give a dog a bone
Yo, don't give him nothing but a microphone
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
You said I'm not the E, you wanna make a bet?
Remember this: Lounge, you in the danger zone
I figured you would, now leave me alone
You pick and you wish on a four-leaf clover
To be the E double E over and over
You're intrigued by the way I do my thing
(Do what?) Pick up the mic high and make it swing

I have the capability to rap and chill
Cold wax and tax MCs who tend to act ill
It's like a Dig'em Smack
You smack me and I'll smack you back
I get goosebumps when the bassline thumps
A sucker MC arrives, now it's time for lunch
When I'm cooling on the scene, I notice one thing
I'm not Bounce, so sucker MCs cling
I consider myself better than average
Yo, I rock the mic like a wild beast savage

I'm in the bottling state, I can't concentrate
I make a move like chess, then I yell ""checkmate""
You know why I get zanier and zanier?
Because of EPMD mania
When I walk through the crowd I can see heads turning
I hear voices saying ""That's Erick Sermon""
Not only from the women, but from the men
You know what? It feels good, my friend

I'm the P double E, the Thrilla of Manila
Better known as the MC cold killer
PMD's goal is to keep the place jumping
And if not we feel we owe you something
It's like lotto, you have to be in it to win it
But if the beat is fresh then Diamond J will spin it
If J spin it, then it has to be def
To make you dance until there's no one left
'Cause you a customer

Praying like a prey when the fox in action
I smell blood, no time for maxin'
Camouflage in the green, my back is arced
Plus you in trouble 'cause it's after dark
My eyes close like Steve Austin, I got you in the square
I would let you run, nah, that ain't fair
So I clear my visions so I can spot him
Snatch him by the neck and say ""Hmmm I got him""

My neighbor MCs, you're in over your head
My rhymes are hungry plus they haven't been fed
The process of elimination is quite simple
Let you grow like a blackhead and pop you like a pimple
Slice you like lettuce, toss you like a salad
Revoke your MC license if your rhyme's invalid
As we go on, sucker MCs sound wacker
Like a parrot says ""Polly want a cracker""

Well it was a regular test, nothing we can't handle
At our house they have the mics on the mantel
Looked at the DJ and said ""May I?""
Lit it up like the Fourth of July
Because I float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
No, I'm the E of EPMD
I have a strong point of view on the way things run
Just shut up and listen and learn my son

Absorb that ass like Bounty, the quicker picker upper
To tell you up front, you're nothing but a sucker
The style we're using, no doubt copastetic
You try to bite and yet sound pathetic
'Cause I'mma rhyme like a tailor, flow like a sailor
As the beat gets stronger, MCs get staler
Not bragging or protagging, surely not fagging
MCs surrender, raise the flags and
Give up the titles 'cause the signs are vital
I keep a voice tuned at a slow and swift idle
And you a customer

I need a man meal sandwich, yes I need Manwich
I feel good, now it's time to do damage
I feel like battling, you know what I mean?
When I rhyme one time to release the steam
When I grab the mic I get dramatic like an actor
You know why I get over? I'm the master
I do a show, pack it in 'til it's clamming up
Look for the microphone then I jam it up

You said you see me jamming at New York Tech
You got one right fella, you deserve a check
How did you know? You must have been jocking
How would you know the places I be rocking?
Don't follow me fella, every move that I make
I'm hostile now so I'll give you a break
Research upon me but don't go past the limit
Here's my card and on the back is my fan club digits

There's two things to check out in the words that I'm saying
Plus listen to the guitar playing
The bro is bad, the strings he's plucking
Fire rhyme after rhyme, watch MCs duckin'

MCs, it's the final countdown
You look tired, can you go the round?
If you can, I'll slap your hand and give you credit
And if not, I'll turn around and say ""Forget it""

People, they say that I'm a party pooper
That’s not true, I’m a Long Island trooper
You a customer",https://genius.com/Epmd-youre-a-customer-lyrics
So Wat Cha Sayin’,Unfinished Business,1988.0,"The employees of the year, yeah, we're back to work
I took time off, while other rappers got jerked
Due to the fact they wack in their track
Have to go back and stack 'cause they lack
The ingredients EPMD and scratch for that...
*DJ Scratch cuts and scratches*
Yo, I'm the hip-hopper, plus the show shocker
Down with MD, yes, the microphone doctor
One wrecks, the other destroys
And if you think that you're ready to mess (Kill the noise)
We don't play when it's time to slay
I get a cut from my homey, yo, then I lay
Back and mack and all the rhymes I pack
And wait for a sucker to jump and then attack

Well, I'm known to be the master in the MC field
No respect in '87, '88, you kneel
Cause I produce and get loose, when it's time to perform
Wax a sucker like Mop & Glo (That's word bond)
Smacked a second time, but on a different assignment
And do a sucker new jack who needs a rappin' alignment
'Cause I'm the cream of the crop when it's time to do a show
Girlies on my jock for my dope intro
As I glance at E-Double, king microphone wrecker
Turn on my cordless, sayin' mic checka
To the ladies ... and all party goers
Some call me P, and others slow flower
Brothers on my jock, for the way I hold a piece of steel
So what you sayin'?
So what you sayin'?

Puttin' heads to bed, straight out the box
MCs are jumpin' out shoes and socks
I'm not playin', understand what I'm sayin'
Catch a sucker in my way, and I'm slayin'
Takin' no shorts, showin' vital sign
You can tell by my lines that I'm gettin' mines
In '89, because I'm fine as wine
Sit back and recline, watch the sun shine
Take a stroll, listen to rock and roll
Catch a flick at the movies, dance or bowl
What I choose I refuse to slack while I'm back
I take a chance jack, so I must attack
With knick knack paddywack so I won't lack
Oh, my style is def, and as deadly as crack

While I'm slayin' music's playin', a sucker is delayin'
Battle in the trenches where the funky beat playin'
'Cause with a partner like E Double don't come a dime a dozen
Not kin or blood-related, but you can call us cousins
'Cause as we climb the charts, better known as statistics
Brothers on my jock while I'm kickin' ballistics
Droppin' hits like 'I'm Housin,' 'You Gots To Chill,' and more
The proof is in the pudding (Yo, check the Billboard)
People round town talkin' this and that
Of how we sound like the R, and our music was wack
Dropped the album Strictly Business and you thought we would fold
Thirty days later, the LP went gold
So what you sayin'?
So what you sayin'?

Now party people it's time for the exquisite
No knock knock who that over there or who is it
It's the E-R-I-C-K, yes, the Boy Wonder
No foulups, no bleeps, no bloops or no blunders
So hot, so you can say I'm blazin'
Or Luther Vandross says, yo I am
""Sooooooo amazing, and I've been waiting""
For a sucker to attack yo me the E-Double
'Cause me and PMD is like the funky fresh couple

I fight fire with fire, that's why most retired
And when we needed a piss boy, you was hired
'Cause you was mesmerized, for that style that we was bringin'
In an all-out battle, P comes out swingin'
'Cause I'm just the type of brother that's out to get mines
And if the odds against me, I still drop lines
And get mines on time, that's why most resign
Sit in my La-Z-Boy chair, relax my head and recline
Sip a Pepsi or Coke, with a twist of lime
Or crack a forty-oh, and then I go for mine
So what you sayin'?
So what you sayin'?",https://genius.com/Epmd-so-wat-cha-sayin-lyrics

So simple, when I rock wit the instrumental
Who am I (E-D the Green Eyed Bandit)
Control my career so I can never get stranded
But the rest are gettin' Brand Nubian
Changed up they style, from jeans to suits and
Thinking about a pop record, somethin' made for the station
For a whole new relation-
Ship of a new type of scene
To go platinum and clock mad green
AKA, a sellout, the rap definition
Get off that boy, change your mission
Come back around the block

I'm strictly hip-hop, I'll stick to Kid Capri
Funk mode, yeah, kid, that's how the Squad rolls
I know your head is bobbin' cuz the neck knows

Yea right, that's what the company kicks
Forget the black crowds, you're wack now
In a zoot suit, frontin' black lookin' mad foul
I speak for the hardcore (rough, rugged and raw)
I'm outta here, catch me chillin' on my next tour
From the US to the white cliffs of Dover
Strictly underground funk, keep the crossover

Outta here, gone, peace, nice to know ya (see ya)
What a way to go out, no clout is what the fans will shout
Cause you got gassed and took the wrong route
Came on the scene, chillin', freakin' a funky dope line
But when they finish wit you (beep) flatline
Some say, ""There's no business like show business,""
But if that's the truth, please explain why is this:

I'm sinking mad deep no shorts and no sleep
I'm bugged like a tapped phone, hard like concrete
So get a GRIP and don't SLIP or catch a CLIP
From the infrared aimed at your head as I blast my TARGET
The Bozack, I rip up flows that
Make an MC stop and chill and say HE'S ALL THAT
Hardcore no R&B singer
Roll with the Hit Squad... down with the head banger


SURPRISE, you wonder where I've been, I've been workin'
But sounds makin' danger, and black birds chirpin'
A real Damien, Omen possessed by the devil
You dig the rhythm, and I'll play the RUNNIN REBEL
Changed my style, so I can freak the funk
Yo pass the Philly, HIT SQUAD spark the blunt
I got the power, to ransack a stadium
WUBBA WUBBA, even Julie Brown at the Palladium
Yo, I'm from the Boondocks so I knows the flavor (yeah, yeah)
Sometimes I curse but now, I show behavior
EPMD, YO, is in this to win this
A brand new LP SO MIND YOUR BUSINESS
No jokin', I'm gettin' paid fully
You wanna buy the cassette? Stop by Sam Goody
YO WHERE'S MY HOODIE? I wanna be hard and cause some ruckus
Talk with the b-boy slang and blast some suckers
Walk like an Egyptian
, but packin' my steel
Plus I'm goin' to court, make my own appeal
As taught as a kid or told, NEVER TALK TO A STRANGER
Cause I could be a head banger


I'm the original rap criminal (yeahhhhh)
My shots, spell spray (hoo-ahhhh) duck means my trigger finger DIGITAL
My gun’ll make men admit, they should dip when I get mad
And pissed cause I can make him my TARGET
Braggin' em taggin' em draggin' em mad hollow-point rhymes in my mic
Choose Smith or assault over Magnum (huh)
So back up off me, here's a clip
For uzis and guns, and then you faggots gonna OFF ME
I'm sure you know the deal that my nine can box
I knock punks out quick like Evander Holyfield
More rhymes than music's, my solution
Subscribers of my style here's a contribution
Let's say you want a shovel layer parkin MC's like cars
And drivin' MC's away
Tanks gon be full, to rappers wanna tempt me
I break this gear shift and leave em EMPTY
'Cause they can't go, so I'mma call a ho tow truck
To come tow truck your weak SIDE SHOW
Back on the scene is the incredible one man team
When I get mad I turn GREEN
The Fugitive's gone peace, I'm outta here later
And here's a finger, to all you non-movin' spectators


SURPRISE NIGGAZ! The original P-Funk funks you up
I take a hit from a spliff then I get biz with the NEW CUT
Because I can Jam like Teddy if you let me
A good fella but still rugged like Joe PESCI
My style is mad funka-to-the-delic with the irrelevant
Shit that I kick backflip semi-full bitch (yeah)
Deduct and I dip then I SWITCH
To an incredible nigga with a *fuckin'* nine on the hip
I always got played by a honeyDIP
But now I'm on the money TIP so now I call the honeydip honey BITCH
And swing hardcore because that's where I come from (yeah)
I Rock ya like Chubb,
 and burn scrubs like a dum-dum
Remember Redman, last album I was Hardcore
Now I'm back to tear the frame out your assCRACK
'Cause I get wreck, with the tec, with the blunt or Moet
And what you see is what you get and what you're gettin' is your
ASS KICKED, nigga, hit you with the funkdafied figure
Like A plus funk, funk times stuffed in your back trunk PUNK
Yes the Redman that's what they call me
Wicked with the style you think I have cerebral palsy

Tried to play my man but you couldn't touch me
You faggot, no comp' rapper on a quest
To get your head flown boy, you must be loc' on sess
Cause many often wonder is M.D. paid
You're God damn right punk, stay outta my way
Cause I clock G's while you clock Z's
And I don't smoke crack - I smoke MC's
So pick up a pen, cop a squat, and take note
A rapper suffered from bleedin, sprains and slit throats
Cause my style, deadly psychopath schizophrenic
A rapper choke like a carburetor, freeze up and panic
Cause I clock pesos,
 
don't sell llello
'Nother word for cocaine mi amigo
That's Spanish, terminology for friend
Now sit back and ride my bozack as I send
Bass funk, with beats that thump
For speakers and amps, cold lined up in my trunk
My system's crankin my headlights are blinkin
Brothers ridin my tip L, at the same time thinkin DAMN
How could a brother be so nice?
Cause I'm the capital, P-E twice, M-D-E twice
I choose to squeeze, some choose to fight
I like to write but then again some bite

I was bangin Snow White - P!

The Ripper, the master, the overlordian
Playing MC's like a old accordion
I get the inspiration from unnecessary station
Them sayin' I was vacationin'
You can't quote with your weaker throat
Tryin to sneak a peek at how I freak the notes
Major MC's become minor B-flats
So retire the mic, get your chains and your bats
Here's your chance to advance, get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants
Pure entertainment, tonight's your arraignment
You're guilty - face down on the pavement!
No holds barred, it's time to get scarred
You and your squad better praise the real God
The undertaker, droppin thunder on fakers
When it comes to lyrics 
I'm as freaky as Seka
So lay the mic down slow and careful
Cause mine is fully loaded and I got another handful
A clip to slip in and start rippin
Divin and dippin and givin punks a whippin (aww shit)
Just in case you wanna go a few rounds or so
I'm down so that you clowns'll know
Me gettin burnt or hurt won't be tolerated
I got rhymes up the huh - forget it I'm constipated - L!


Slow down baby
Uhh yeah - slow down baby
Yeah - slow down baby
{​E Double in the house!}​ Yeah

When I come around homeboy, watch your nuggets
A master on the beatdown, my style's rugged
When I attack the microphone, close the zone
Rap sees danger, can't roam
Security's packed and wall to wall can't fall
A rap tank is full so I can't stall
My microphone is filled with premium
Any whack MC that flexes, I'm creamin him
Not with lotion, bust the motion
Flotation when I rock on the mic, I'm like coastin
I'm unique, fatigued at my peak you still seek
A style cause yours extra weak
New method, to rip the stage at my age
And get loose and kick, like Bruce in a rage

I’m Housin’,Strictly Business,1988.0,"Coolin' on the scene like a horse in a stable
A brother got ill and tried to snatch a fat cable
I stepped back, like it wasn't no thing
Punched him in the jaw with the fat gold ring
I had an ace in the hole when it came to that
(Yo P you was packin'?) You know I'm strapped
Posse kept rollin' it was hard to get with 'em
So I stepped back, and unbuttoned my Lee denim
They kept coming, just like I figured
So I stepped back, and started sprayin' niggas

What a way to go out, out like a sucker
But I'm on track, like a Long Island train conductor
That can head on a mission, suckers who be dissing
Always on my jock like a snake always hissing
Grabbing and tapping me like Luther Vandross
Take me to the bar for the drink and make a toast
Givin' best wishes to the best MC
The E the D-O-U-B-L-E
Because I'm housin'

Coolin at a party, no better yet disco
Head feelin mellow from a bottle of Cisco
Move
To crush and fry a sucker MC like crisco
Every chance I get, I try to kill
That's one less sucker new jack, who tried to act ill
I keep the place jumpin' 'til the party's through
Whether it's disco, hardcore, or rhythm and blues
Take off your coat, won't you stay a while
Check out the voice that is smooth and mild
It's like 
Wheel of Fortune
, go on for big money
Come cold rock the party, and leave with your honey

Gimme the cue, check one two
Don't try to come off on me, because you doo-doo
Treatin me the E Doubl-E, like a stepchild
Well let me tell you homeboy you're livin' foul
MCs, you know who you are
(On the bandwagon) Why P? (Cause you a star)
This is the year that when the joker's are wild
When a fag can't hack it and try to bite the style
I get hip to the scheme, before it happens
If it gets wild, then I start cappin'
But for now, since everything's calm
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
As I proceed to rock, the girls are clockin'
Some brothers act hard but the rest are jockin'
Because I'm housin'

I come on strong, like a bodybuilder
Cast a spell upon a sucker, like witch Matilda
Deliver a rhyme like Federal Express
My intention's not to dis, but impress
For ladies and gents, who money was spent
To see the E-P-Double-E-M-D (yes the main event)
In concert... not worried bout oohs and boos (because we do work)
To make your body jerk
(To make your girl want to leave her man and start to flirt
With the P) Double-E MD Double E'n
I'm not skeezing, but pleasing
All party goers, also behind show-ers
Who like the not, fast slow flow of rhymes that form in my dome
Out the mouth, to the microphone
Because I'm housin'",https://genius.com/Epmd-im-housin-lyrics

EPMD Millineum Ducats
, DefCon 9, 2 G's
Uh-huh, yeah
Yeah it's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
Ay E-Dub check it out
MCs out there, you better stand clear
EPMD is a world premier
From New York straight talk, America's best
Cold wild Long Island, is where we rest

Style of the rap, makes your hands clap
Take care of myself because the lines are strapped
Day mean business, no time for play
If you bite a line, we'll roll your way
The more you bite, your body gets hot
Don't get too close, because you might get shot
Gnawin' at my rhyme like a poisonous rat
Don't play dumb, boy, you're smarter than that

It's my thing

The rhythmatic style, keeps the rhyme flowin'
Good friends already bitin', without you knowin'
Can't understand, why your body's gettin' weaker
Then you realize it's the voice from the speaker
The mind become delirious, situation serious
Don't get ill, go and get curious

'Nuff about that, let's get on to somethin' better
And if gets warm, take off the hot sweater
And if you want some water, I'll get you a cup
And if you don't want it then burn the hell up
I'm tellin' you now boy you ain't jack
Talkin' much junk like Mr. T has your back
But he's not, so don't act cute
'Cause if you do you in hot pursuits

It's my thing

As the song goes on you will notice a change
The way I throw down, the way I say my name
The mic that I'm packin' is flame resistant
So MC be cool, and keep your distance
When I walk into the party girls are screamin' at me
I park my mic in my holst', and then I yell freeze...
Music please

Ah, where was I? Oh yes
Say a def rhyme then I plumb the rest
Everytime I rock a rhyme I can tell that you like it
Emotion is strong like the mind of a psychic
The mind is weary, floatin' like a dove
Sweatin' a thing like if you was makin' love
Control the crowd, so they can accept it
Total concentration is the perfect method

It's my thing

The wack I subtract, the strong I attack
The ones who grab the mic and freeze, I throw it back
I perfect and eject, make MCs sweat
Take 'em off on the mic then I tell 'em step
Not waiting or debating, 'cause MCs keep hating
Play me too close like two dogs mating

Now let's get on with the rest of the lesson
Don't really like it when suckers start messin'
Tryin' to make a scene, talkin' very loud
Talkin' much junk to attract a crowd
You say you wanna battle, your first mistake
You get quiet and stuff like you was at a wake
In the beginnin', you knew you wasn't winnin'
Now you feel ashamed, your head starts bendin'
Kinda upset boy -- I understand
You lost again -- I won, god damn

It's my thing

My funky fresh lyrics put you in the spirit
I speak a little louder for you suckers can't hear it
The rhymes I designed are right on time
And at the crowd on my mic flash a danger sign
'Cause 
I'm the Thriller of Manila, MC cold killer
Drink Budweiser, cannot stand Miller
MCs cold clockin' 'til the party's through
Then they tap me on my shoulder and say ""This Bud's for you""

To be a real MC you can't be obedient
To be smooth is the main ingredient
You have to be silky like a Milky Way
To be able to make it work you rest and play
I control the pace of the rate the rhymes goin'
Hydraulically jacked is the way they're flowin'
Slow yes, just like they're awed
The comparison is wave like the motion of water, smooth

While the record is spinnin', got your fly girlie grinnin'
MD is on the mic, you know I'm only beginnin'
Rhymes fresher than fresh, never heard me fess
Scored 110 on my MC test
My rhymes are strong than Tyson, hold a MC license
When I grab the mic MCs get frightened

I'm dangerous, I need a cross and bones
Lounge homeboy you in the danger zone
What I mean by lounge I don't mean bitin', huh
You mess around, and we'll be fightin'
It's alright if you bite, but don't recite
Because the rhymes are mine, and that ain't right
But until just chill to the next episode
Donald J, yo, release the code

It's my thing

Knick Knack Patty Wack,Unfinished Business,1989.0,"Yo, and special guests on my show
Is the K

To the S to the O-L-O

And me, the capital D, the O to C
The a.k.a., the P the M the D

And me, the E to the D to the O
To the U to the B to the L to the E

It's time P

To rip the M the I to C

So knick knack paddy wack give a dog a bone
K-Solo (yo) I pass P the microphone

Nah black (why P?) to each his own
So knick knack paddy wack give the dog a bone
Aiyyo, I pass E the microphone

It's me, yes the MC Grand Royal
Who loves rappin, and to it I stay loyal
I can't tell, you ain't caught up in my spell
You dwell on the other crab MC's that fell
Apart from the start, that didn't know the art
Of rappin, to keep the people's hands clappin
But it's me, I know the way it should be
The
 flow slow, like me and PMD
And that black, will make you real fat
A real swinger, and a real cool cat
Like a jazz player, or someone on the accordion
Producing crazy hits like, if I was Barry Gordy and
Here's a tip, to show you how to rip
A crab in half, and watch his posse flip
So me, the E, I come equipped
Heavy ammunition, so I don't have to dip
So listen, to this funky fresh lesson
The way I drop it, and the way that I was flexin
So knick knack paddy wack give a dog a bone
PMD (yo) I pass Solo the microphone

Yo I pass (why Solo?) to each his own
Yo knick knack paddy wack give a dog a bone
Yo, I pass P the microphone

As I take the stage, with the fresh dipped gear
I start to show off, with throw your hands in the air
Because the older I get, the harder I kick
Usin my rap-fu style from a rap-fu flick
Of my Bic oh shit another MC's lit
Like a Jack-o-Lantern, on the Halloween tip
Cause as the bass thumps, 
VU meters peaks
All pens and pads are drawn, as the teacher speaks
Because a naughty rapper, tried to steal the flow
But the buck stops here, cause I'mma let you know
No swingin, or knuckles, strictly ammo
Cause as I dust bust, crush, and then rush
A sucker new jack, with no if's and's or but's
You roll with the good times, we like to roll with Rush
I drive a 'Ratti (I drives a Benz) you ride the bus
So get out the mustard, crab, because it's time to catch-up
And in the act of war, P refuse to let up
On a gonna-be, wanna-be, soon-to-be, whatever's clever
In any type of weather, cause two birds of a feather
Always flock together
So knick knack paddy wack give the dog a bone
K-Solo, I pass E the microphone

I pass (why E? To each his own)
So knick knack paddy wack give a dog a bone
Aiyyo, I pass Solo the microphone

Yo, my style's aggressive, like a pit bull terrier
Harder it sounds on wax, the more the merrier
Maestro though, releases beats for me
So I can rig up a hit and get paid easily
People, gather round listen to my flow
Yo, so I can prove, that I'm the true Solo
Too many suckers, have bit my name in vain
Punk rappers thought I was sleepin, but Solo came
To so many places, other rappers faces
That called theirself Solo, I made em erase it
I'm Solo, no name lender or pretender
Yo, I am the Solo the on-ly solo contender
Duck MC's, grab my name and bit it boldly
Put it behind they name and ate this up like ravioli
I heard on KISS, with Red Alert and Chuck
A rapper said he went Solo, I said, ""What the FUCK??!""
My man came over, and said, ""Yo, I thought we heard you""
Joke's on you you heard a bitin ass crew
They bit my name, I want it back, and it's a fact
Yo PMD tell em (damn you shouldn'ta did that)
Now for the record, what do I stand for
One lonely rapper on the stage, who gets one, single applause
Give me a break my brother
My name stands for Kevin Self, Organization Left Others
My name's no game for those who claim to use my name
In vain cause their name sounds plain
I remain the same, my flow of style won't change yo
The name of the game is for the real Solo to explain
I don't know was where you ran or came
I know your vein I hate your name
You're ashamed, playin the game that drove you insane
That walk around puddles, snow and the rain
With a cane, nothin to gain but shame
And my momentum of the fast flow of rhyme'll get em tamed
The pain of no fame, no title again, nobody but the real
K-S-O-L-O to blame
When I S-P-E, L-L, very W-E, L-L
People all out there can T-E-L-L
Rhymes that I got, or write will S-E-L-L
For those who don't believe me, can go to H-E-L-L
I'm from C-I, L-I, F-L-Y
Like a B-R-I-D, in the S-K-Y
Don't even T-O-Y to be dat's why
L-I-N-E's belong to M-I-N-E
I'm makin veche, some rappers imitate
Yo f*ck it, Solo here's to make parties sway
People, I won't take any kind of losses

When I turn the party out, all hands is in the air
Some say it's chill, New York throw chairs
It's the punk funk sound to make a sane man flip
Girls rush the stage, faggots cold dip
Low, to avoid the caps and blows
By the gangbangers, at the b-boy shows
Where the cops, try to control the crowd
But they can't, system's cranked, ""So Wat Cha Sayin""'s pumpin loud
Blows are thrown, heads are flown like Pan-Am
Brothers lickin off like the Son of Sam and
The bass, continues to thump
Some brothers hit the parkin lot, to go pop trunks
Hoes are slapped, jewels are snatched
Brothers are caught in the crossfire without no caps
And on my way out, I heard a sucker scream and shout
{​​AHHH! NIGGAZ!}​​ ""Niggas,"" yeah cold turn the party out

""Hardcore.. to make the brothers act fools""
""Hardcore.. to make the brothers act fools""

Rap combat is where it's at and I attack
Any crab MC, that's down with the wack
And I wreck, and if I can I snap a neck
Throw a knockout blow, and look for a tech
I'm terror, new edition to rap era
I can't be beat, I'm too sweet plus clever
I'm smart, yes, I'm a so called genius
I'm equipped with the thinkin cap they call keenness
And yo, with that, I can break fool
Especially when the posse is thick and got tools
Makes me feel good cause they got steel
No blasters or cap guns son, the real deal
K-A, microphone wrecker E-D
The O, the U, the B, the L to the E
Rockin on, word is bond, so abandon ship
My name is Erick Sermon not Wilson but I flip
I'm far from a chump, I'm hardcore like Brooklyn
Mess with me, and get your manhood took-en

I got it goin on, since I'm up next to flex
You bet I drop heavy so girls grab your Kotex
I catch fits when I blitz a rhyme grit
And my lip gets to the point, to rip some mo' fly shit
Redman ready to rock rough rhymes
Renegade rapper, rip when it's rhyme time
Punk push a pen and pencil when I'm pissed
Pack pistol posse, flow some more pro shit
Fee-Fi-Foe-Fum, funky to floor, ay
Fuck ya freak words for foreplay
Quickly, quiet is kept, never quack
On the Q-Tip I quote, I throw lines like a quarterback
A monster, murder motherfucks like Manson
A madman ,who mutilize men with 9-M-M
Bullets blow bad, brother back to back I slam
Bread and butter, break beats to Bam Bam
Jump off the jim before I jack my johnson
I jam like Janet, chew MC's like Swansons
Dennis stamp dummy, I'm diggin a dungeon
Can you dig that I dig deep, to destroy dumb-dumbs?
Yes, I yam what I yam when I jam, bro
My afro's in the house (YO YO YO!)
Long as I live large, life will be luxury
Ladies in Lamborghinis, love is like luck to me
Nasty nigga, competition is none
From Newark, New Jersey, knock heads like Mike Nunn
Shit, grab the steel when I'm strokin
Smoke with shotguns but the sign said no smokin
Cool it kiddo, I control from sea to sea
Cut like Chuckie, plus style is cock-D
Superman Lover, cool from the new school
Hold your breath, while I walk holdin my jewels

Yo, what's up PMD?
Ayo coolin man, done with this album, about to take it up to Leon Wills, see what they say
Hold up man, we ain't bringing nothing up until I diss this girl, man
Aw, you ain't going to go into that Jane thing again?
You know I had to diss her! I told her don't mess with me, you know?
But why you gotta be bothering with that skeezer? That was way back in 1986!
Let me tell you how it went anyway
Hanging out late drinking a couple of brews
Turn on the radio put the shit on snooze
So when it's time to get up, the radio comes on
Blasting in my ear with the hip-hop song
Five minutes later I hear someone knocking
Yo outside yo, my stereo's rocking
Saying in my mind ""Who can it be?""
It was me, the P double E M D
I said yo
I said yo
What's up trooper? I have a girl and she wants me to duke her
Why didn't you?
I woulda have been, only thing she brung along a friend
So PMD (Yo?) Why don't you do me a favor?
Chill with the bitch and I'll hook you up later
She's fly, haircut like Anita Baker
Looked up and down and said ""Hmm, I'll take her""
She came in, I said ""Hi my name is P""
She said ""Hello my name is J-A-N-E""
I said ""Jane, oh, what a nice name""
It reminds me of a high school flame
She came behind me and then she rubbed my back
She started moaning and said ""Yo, let's hit the sack""
Went to my room because she was kinda bossy
Girl broke buckwild
And started playing horsey
She showed pain but inside she felt joy
Ayo she broke wild and said ""Ride em cowboy!""
Three o'clock on the dot
Tired of busting her
Woke up in the morning to my record ""You're a Customer""
She left me a note, she called me the master
Said next time you have to be better
Bigger
Stronger and much faster
And you don't quit, EPMD rock double

This is the year for the barbaric and the cats with skills
Underground with the hoodie, fuck keepin it real
While you was pissin in your bed, we was makin a mill'
Got up, with Erick Sermon, dropped ""You Gots 2 Chill""
Then niggas bugged, turned hardcore b-boy, slash thug
Givin fake love, with fake hugs, to fake thugs
With fake mugs, runnin they mouth with the place bugged
And caught a slug, and no one see nothin but mask and gloves

Aiyyo likewise I come in strong with no disguise, ruthless
It's me, transformed I'm Eazy-E
Past the point of rockin the joint
I'm blowin the spot, wreckin the scene with my team
NFL: Niggas For Life, so feel that
I see a few clowns, so where's the steel at
Me and my boys are ready, aim that and hold it steady
For those who dream, believe I'm Freddie
Now yo, if you got more dollars in your pocket
Put a peace sign in the air if you from the South Bronx
And let me hear you say
Hell yeah HELL YEAH
Say hell yeah HELL YEAH

Aiyyo, I grab the mic and strike, explode and ignite
Off the head, reminscin about some shit last night
No dough, in the pocket but that shit's alright
And these faggots, always stress me so I keep my shit tight
Who am I? The cat to put that ass on standby
Fuck your sister, then chill with you, then tell her man hi
Then start stalkin, three point shot like Hershey Hawkins
Takin it back to the Seventy-Sixers like Johnny Dawkins

Yo I come through camouflaged with the Squadron entourage
Lookin like ghetto superstars
EPMD's the name, there's no mistaken
I rob you for all you got, and keep takin
The blah-blah buck off like a wild Jamaican

Everybody say make money money, make money money money
MAKE MONEY MONEY, MAKE MONEY MONEY MONEY

Yo, who grabs the mic and spit flows while you swing low
I'm high off the indo, but straight up, you gets no wins though
I like to ill, pop corks and watch the Mo' spill
Hundred dollar bills dippin po-nine while my niggas chill

Yo yoyoyoyoyoyoyoyo P chill chill chill
Niggas is in here fightin B

K.I.M.,Back In Business,1997,"Nah nah, check this out, yo
I grab my dick, spit, hit the blinkers, split
The Dutch Coronas, tokin irons without permits
Repetoire long-faced murderer's the shit
Black Bruce Willis mix tape arsonist
Esquire, for hire, with total rapid fire
Supplier to any Tom Dick Jerry Maguire
You chose the right man to get the plan executed
I get the situation happening before you shoot it
Flow direct-or, surprise you like guess what?
The hotter I spit I'm trippin off smoke detectors
Who next up to get dressed up, I don't pop
Corks I pop New York with a Doc teleport
The art then the craft, will split you in half
I'm a Hurricane you a Miller Genuine Draft
While you push a S-Class I'm riding on a giraffe
Uptown, naked, smoking a bag with hash, check it
Shut your windows and lock your doors
Whores scream louder than Barrymore when I pour
And when me and my crew walk we walk on all fours
Atomic Dogs, packed in a black Yukon

K.I.M
Keep It Movin'

John Blaze, I keep y'all niggas rockin for days
Boriquas, to eses, around the ways
My own Mix Tape DJ, I Flex
You don't have a clue when I'm doin ya who is he I gets busy, word up
Poker player look in my eyes you think I'm bluffin
A five year span turned nuttin into somethin
And don't get familiar, your whole entourage don't be
Feelin ya, behind your back they straight killin ya
(Who am I?) The Ex-Headbanger bad motherfucker
High on Friday with Chris Tucker
I be a Headbanger to my very last breath
Even Jermaine Dupri think I'm So So Def
K.A., Shawn Mims, I come from a long line of Geechies
Who didn't care, blow Camp Lo Luchinis
I transform like Spawn, takes no time
For me to get on, to the break of dawn, word
Chorus

PMD, the Purple Heart admiral
Blow your spot and left shrapnel
Then escaped in the Benz capsule
Harder than a NFL tackle, back to bite the Big Apple
Southpaw, raw since I was a Sophomore
Before I met Jane in the corridor
The mentor, rapper slash entrepeneur
With more action than Roger Moore
Turn your cabbage into coleslaw, with the four four
Spray Windex on your glass jaw
Shatter it, fuckin with P, is hazardous
Iced out Lazarus started and manufactured this
My Squad's wild like the Manimals on Geographic
Smash you bastards on some crab shit
EPMD's the group the Squadron is the click
Transmit, lyrical grit, time to shift cause I'm
Chorus

Keith Murray, the holder of the boulder
Lyrical analyst mental roller coaster flower
Money folder, track blower, MC overthrower
I flow witcha two at a time, like Noah
I doze off to the beat, on the edge of reality
And kick rhymes in my sleep, and battle Mortality
Finally, every dimension know Keith
Y'all egotistical simple-minded niggas is pitiful and weak
I'll give you a G a week for life, if you can defeat me
I kick poetry at a high rate of mortality
Aesthetic, lyrical Kraftmatic, smokin
Barkin like a dog, breathin like an asthmatic
Lyrical sculpture create fly rap sculpture
Ninety-eight Headbanger boy, yeah I told ya
Total chaos, helter skelter, run for shelter
Here comes the lyrical brain melter
I be maxin and relaxin, attractin action
Flippin more big ol words than Jesse Jackson
My shit knock don't it, drive you crazy if you loan it
Man I feel for my opponents

Get the Bozack,Unfinished Business,1989.0,"Ah, yeah, vacation's over, suckers still pickin' on a four-leaf clover
As I say mic check, EPMD's in effect
Snappin' necks and cashin' large checks
As I flex then wrecks, so E was next

Shazam, let me tell you who I am
The E-R-I-C-K, S-E-R-M-O-N
Call me a lumberjack or a midland warrior
Doin' damage to the world worse than Hurricane Gloria
I'm serious -- you can say I'm furious
You're sayin' in your mind, ""Who is he?"" because you're curious
A rare rap style, not heard by the usual
You bite you get damaged, so my brothers stay mutual

While I'm makin' and takin', emcees shakin' and flakin'
Pre-heat my oven to three hundred degrees and start bakin'
Emcees like potatoes, beats kickin' like Kato
Gettin' philosophical like the Greek man Plato (who?)
The Greek man Plato (who?) The Greek man Plato
But I'm the A.K.A to flow, bro
As you all well know, I do a show
Pick up the dough and ho, break to the limo
Money in the pocket, Albee's hands on the ammo
Crack the Olde Gold as we roll and stroll
Don't play bold sucker, 'cause you was told
Your spot in the box in eighty-eight was sold
So quit the singin', come swingin' 'cause of the beat that I'm bringin'
Tryin' to wax EPMD, you be U.G.-in
On a heavy narcotic, such as speed or crack
Because your rhyme's mediocre but your tracks are wack
Not fiction but fact black, believe that
Then put away your demo 'cause the brother is back
And get the bozack... E...

Yo, as I sing and do my thing I might sing
Jane or the whole shabang
But if I snap during the course of the rap
P tap me on the back, throw the crowd a flap
Just to distract 'til I'm intact
Get my Fisherman hat, so I can mack
Groove to the rhythm of a funky track
Like (""Yo, you smack me and I'll smack you back"")
I come correct with the context and then next
Then flex and throw a hex on your whole complex
Then check for a second, yo, then sayyy
(R-E-S-P-E-C-T) Respect!
For me the E Double, or the emcee rap goddess
ĄCause me and PMD we get ours regardless
So get the bozack... P...

Yo, time to get funky-raw
Stomp mudholes and posses (like who?) like Gigantor
ĄCause when we roll we come fully equipped
Mic in the hand, tooly, and spare clips
Like a detenator with no ticks I then trick or slip
Or maybe flip while my DJ's on the mix
Never lost a battle and if I did it was fixed
You must be sick all on mz dilznick like a jim hat
Your shit ain't pumpin' and your rhymes are wack
Cąause you're a nickel dime sucka who hangs with Tommy Tucker
Like KRS-One says, you a part time sucka
Who works O.T. to be like me
The Capital P, the M, I'm like D
To slay an emcee on the S-P-O-T
Leave without a motive or a C-L-U-E
So get the bozack... E...

Yo, the MC Grand Royal on the microphone
Terrorist, mafioso, a.k. E Capone
I'm no joke on the stroke, I broke so don't choke
No hopes folks, I quote note for note
You mind float on the rhyme on I wrote (what?)
And does the wild thing, like my boy Tone Loc
It's equipped with the kit that bit the whole shit
Don't catch a nitfit, because my style's legit
Brand new from the crew for you, no voodoo
A trick from the flicks master Wu Kung-Fu
Equipped with the posse and the time I need
Cock diesel like Rocky and Apollo Creed
So get the bozack... P...

Yo, mic checkin', checkin' and checkin' and checkin'
Scan the crowd then start wreckin'
Either kill or be killed in the field of hip-hop
'Cause if you're slow you blow, you get popped, mopped and dropped
If you snooze, you lose, here come the oohs and boos
I pop a No-Doz, relax my lips and cruise
Past a pooh putt'n sucka who's all about schemin'
Waxin' the P twice, you must be dreamin'
'Cause as you moan and groan, from the mouth you foam
Sayin' deep down inside, I should've left P alone
'Cause it's a fact, black, that when I'm loopin' the track
To lounge in the Danger Zone, because I'm back
In fact, Jack, before I launch my attack
Premeditate my assassination and come strapped
Playin' rough and tough but when I called your bluff
You tried to post on a microphone doctor and got snuffed
So get the bozack
So, get the bozack
You get the bozack (knahmean?)
Get the bozack
Know what I'm sayin' E man?
 the bozack
 MCs like this, yo
Get the bozack
Get the bozack
Get the bo-, the bo-, the bo- bozack

Let the Funk Flow,Strictly Business,1988.0,"Relax while I tax, or you can just max
It really doesn't matter, just stay the hell back
Poppin much junk, now the time has arose-n
I pick your card and your name has been chosen
Not all about ?line-opin? or the stick up scene
""Let it flow!"", you know what I mean
I'm the PMD, in the place to be
Clock rhymin and I lock ya, around the tick-tocker
Suckers steady clockin at the same time jockin
So a brother like MD takes a chill and lay low
Hypnotize your girl, while the funk flow

I got my girls to keep me pumpin, just like Getty
Use the same fuel as Mario Andretti
Kickin butt in the beginning all the way to the end
He drives, I rhyme no matter what we win
I come fully equipped, with the mic on my hip
So if you real, it's no time to slip
Cause when it's time for some action, check on the Mic-hael Jackson
Do a spin grab my nuts, and start taxin
Let the MC's know that I shock like lightning
They mess with the E-Double-E, I sounds frightening
 So let the funk flow
""Let it flow!""

Blastoff, and off you go
We usually take off fast, but now we take up slow
I would say Bon Voyage, but I'm not leavin
I don't wanna go, but the girlies keep screamin
So I will stay, if that's fine wit you
But I won't leave, until the party is through
So while I'm here, let me get funky
Fiendin for the rhyme (like a four-deuce junkie)
Put the pep in your step, the stride in your glide
EPMD them goin nationwide

While the bass is steady pumpin and the beat be like thumpin
You lose your cool, then you start jumpin
You're out of control, and I'm right on track
In seconds later I work the bone out your back
To mess with the two is to mess with hot water
We like to hang, torture then slaughter
All sucker MC's, who proceed to intrude
E said (let em slide), say what but I'm in the mood
For dishin and dismissin, all those who don't listen
Reel the ones whose in, as if we was fishin
So in eighty-eight, no wait I think it's too late
Cause in eighty-seven, you bit on the old bait
 So let the funk flow
""Let it flow!""

Lounge homeboy you in the danger zone
When the brother PMD is on the microphone
The slow momentum of my rhymes are divine and combined
To go off beat, and come back on time
To maintain and explain, but never sound the same
And when it comes to do this, very few remain
People on my jock for the rhymes I invent
Dip in a phone booth just like Clark Kent
Step out dressed to impress, with no intention to fess
Chillin HARD, with the P on my chest
Rhymin on the mic, while the beat rocks steady
Throw a funky fresh rhyme and MC's fetch it like Freddy

Listen to heavy metal, hardcore rock n roll
Drink a six-pack, maybe Miller or Stroh
That's not the move, it's about hip-hop
The loud guitar playing and screaming has to stop
Let's get it straight for nineteen eighty-eight
For it can sound fine for nineteen eighty-nine
I hear the girls out there sayin E is hot
That only shows you what juice I got
And if you don't like me, and you yellin boo
There's nothin wrong wit me, it's somethin wrong with you
So let the funk flow
""Let it flow!""
 So let the funk flow
""Let it flow!""
 Yo, this beat is sort of funky
 Man, I ain't worried about it, I know it's funky

 Peace to Chuck
 Chuck D
 Yeah, uhh
You're not tellin em huh? Yeah

They go ohh and ahh when I jump in my car
People treat me like Kareem Abdul Jabbar
When I'm supreme rap star, they all know me
E.D., when I flash the greens on TV
MC's be robbin me, of my technique
The way I speak, the way I get down, the way I sound
And if you axe/ask me, they must be on the jock
Of the innovator (one two), rock roll bounce to skater

OK fuck it, enough with the tight shit, grab the mic quick
Hollywood niggas, put it down spit some hype shit
EPMD Erick and Parrish, Makin Dollars
With the rap scholars keep the show packed like funeral parlors
Deadly, murderous I know you heard of us
Holdin shit down on the block, nobody servin us (yeah son)
The E Double and Mic Doc, Boondox
Def Jam's off the meter yo, this shit is hot
Chorus: EPMD
 Never seen before, or heard before
The uncut raw
 I'm Erick Sermon
 and I'm Parrish Smith
(repeat 2X)

Check it, now I'm back with the flyest material
Mic Doc and E Dub the Grand Imperial
My mic's deadly, so I scratched off the serial
And stashed it, until I have to kill at will
Keep it movin, yes it's me in the flesh
It's no illusion, fuck around and catch minor contusions
Whatever, I'm Smokin Joe when it comes to rap
I'm a pro-fessional, Tiger Woods I'm good

Time to black out, no doubt, people wanna know about
The inside scoop with the group, and are they comin out
Damn skippy I'm tipsy, 
high like a hippie
Don't take drinks from strangers cause niggas slip mickies
That's why I stay on Q/cue, like Omar Epps in J-U
I-C-E
 so chill and bust the debut
In rare form the false alarm's the Mic Don's
Back in effect, snap that neck, the P's gone
Chorus
 Never say never
 What? EPMD's back together
 And if it gets warm take off the hot sweater
 Flip the ill slick flow (flow)
 Watch us throw (throw)
 down with the other brothers toe to toe
 And if ya slow ya blow
 That's why we comin with the ammo
 Yo ten year veterans
 A thousand rap sessions
 Yeah the hard rockers
 The crowd shockers
 The head knockers
 Yeah EPMD's off the rockers

Gold Digger,Business As Usual,1990.0,"Brothers, things done got too far gone (Tell 'em 'bout it)
We got ta let the girls know what they gotta do for us!

Oh, what the heck, let's get married and have a son named Erick
No big deal, no sweat
Hmmm, I was in for a big surprise
And when I saw the judge hammer pass my green eyes
Brainlocked, my whole damn head was malfunctional
'Cause I forgot to co-sign a prenuptial, agreement
Now her case is hard like cement
I have no files on all the money she spent
She has a car, nineteen ninety brand new Jaguar
Fly kit with chrome rims that's five star
That she bought, when I was away on tour
Hittin' my bank account, gettin' more and more money
She got paid, it wasn't funny
Talkin to myself—oh, you big, big dummy
Just my luck that I'm stuck with a marriage
And a baby who lays in a gold carriage
Now I can't leave, if I do she gets half (Not the cash)
Oh, yes, the whole damn bash of money
So I chill and act so sweet
Kiss her feet, can't picture bein' in the street
So I give a fake smile, and a fake laugh
Fake everything so I can keep all my cash
Fake talk, like, ""I love you so much""
But wishin' she gets hit by a Mack truck
Next time, if there's one, I'll know
That most women strictly out for the dough
They're called gold diggers

'Cause she's a gold digger
'Cause she's a gold digger
'Cause she's a gold digger
'Cause she's a gold digger

The P had a close call, quiet as kept I dated this
""Fly girl""
Yeah, and almost got vicked
She had green eyes, thunder thighs, and a def body (so what cha sayin'?)
Top it off, she drove a black Maserati
Chrome kit, with a smile I couldn't resist
I tapped E on the shoulder and said, ""Yeah I gots to get this""
(P, cool—she couldn't be a gold digger)
Not with that smile and that stupid boomin' figure
Til one day, she spent the crazy dough
Ten Gs on Levi's, cold went Rambo
But then she smiled, gave me a back massage
Gassed my head up, and said (Oh, P, you're so large)
Like a jerk, I went for the line like a fish
But she was far from dream girl, and more like a death wish
She likes to sit back, lamp, walk on plush rugs
Whip my five-sixty, sip Moet and bug (So did you flip?)
Tried to but she cut me off
And said, ""Guess what?"" (What?)
""I'm pregnant"" (Pregnant? Damn)
Yeah, and the child is yours
So to fellas who wanna keep they cash
Or beware of the jack hammer and the helmet that glows
'Cause she's a gold digger

'Cause she's a gold digger
She's a gold digger
She's a gold digger
She's a gold digger

That's why, men in the 90s must watch themselves
'Cause ladies of the 80s got hip and went for self
With the new divorce laws, which entitles them half
That means the house goes,—
—The car,—
—You, and half your cash
What a price to pay, but if you play you pay
'Cause women of the world they got smart today
They flash a smile and profile,—
—A pucker with a strut,—
—Try to move in—
—Knock the boots
And got stuck, with alimony payments
Time to meet Judge Wapner
You try to flip and cut, but she smiles 'cause she gotcha
You get a flashback to wedding, when you vowed the vow
Said the two deadly words—
—""I do""
But look now; you lost the house,—
—The car
Eatin' TV dinners in a one bedroom apartment
Boy, you picked a winner
But what goes around, comes around
That's why she wheels the Benz
And you ride Greyhound
Oh, just your luck, they on strike
Take off the wedding band, put out the thumb, time to hitch-hike
And the more you walk the pain from your corns get bigger
(Now you know)
Not to mess with a gold digger

'Cause she's a gold digger
'Cause she's a gold digger
'Cause she's a gold digger
'Cause she's a gold digger

Yeah, EPMD's in effect, DJ Scratch runs flex, boy
Hit Squad in effect in the house
Large!!
Yeah, she get half",https://genius.com/Epmd-gold-digger-lyrics

My life story I tell straight from the heart
When suckers tried to crash my shit straight from start
A young black kid, destined for success
No Olde Gold, no cocaine, or buddha sess
Straight up hard work, no sleep and no shorts
Brainstormin with the skills that Pop Duke taught
To keep swingin', yeah and not to quit
Now I ride the Benz, you ride the dick
With your punk friends, straight up pussy from Punk City
My attitude's fucked up, and real shitty
From the backstabbers, yeah my so-called friends
Who swim in my pool, when it's time flex the Benz
Around town, windows down as the sound pounds
Cool J tape or K-Solo's ""Spellbound""
With fly girlies tippin', brothers grippin' and sippin'
Olde Gold, 
Red Bull
, hands on my dick and
I'm just lampin with my EK shades
Truck jewels, obviously the man's paid
But of course not, brother can't get his props
Like for instance, when I cruise up the block
In my 560
 lampin' on my Metro phone
Chrome kit beamin' all off your dome
And like a sucker, yeah you looked the other way
That's when I know you're on my dick kid; but it's okay
It's normal - relax, your whole head's busted
Caught in the rap skit, and couldn't be trusted
Cause my sounds pound from here to Okinaw-yy

We move wax like kilos {*DJ Scratch break*}

Yeah, to them cats out there hustlin' them demos
Keep the faith, keep hustlin', knahmean E?
 Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
 I'mma lace em like this, check it

I was coolin' in my car one day you see
Clockin' a double nickel
 
on the L-I E
When it dawned on us that it was, ten o'clock
Turned on the tunes to hear the DJ rock
The hands got to clappin', the fingers start to snappin'
E now was coolin', Brooklyn spirits we was snappin'
Comin' in and out of fantasies on how large we can get
Coolin' in rocks and Benzes with the ground effect kits
I wanted black, E was on the two-tone
Stupid boomin' system with the hand-free phone
The dream gets better and I would like to go on
But I was brought back to reality by a toot of a horn
Smoke everywhere, oh just what we needed
A meeting at twelve, and the car overheated
Feelin' real low, low enough to die
Holdin' up traffic, on the FDR drive
We had to play ourselves, in the fresh dipped gear
E Double had to push while MD steered
There went our dreams, to cool with golden limos
And alls we kept sayin' was please listen to my demo
(listen to my demo)
Please listen to my demo (3X)
Please-please-please-ple-please listen to my demo

In the year eighty-seven when we first took off
Then I jumped on P-6-8 and broke North
Walked the big city streets of Manhattan
Buildings, the whole nine yards, so enchantin'
Thinkin' if we got a chance, we could rock it
Funky fresh demo tape in my pocket
We was walkin', and got dissed twice today
Then we stopped at 1974 Broadway
We walked in with grins on our chins
And P had juice with Mr. Virgil Simms
He played the tape and we started to laugh
Played it for Will Soc' and the Sleeping Bag staff
People start to smile, inside we buckwhylin'
Sayin' this all started back from freestylin'
They liked it, and they was very kind
But me and P was like, ""Yo G, where do we sign?""
Went in the backroom, things was lovey-dovey
Met Ron Resnick, and 
his partner Juggy
Things was cool, as I remembered
We signed the dotted line, now we

 Tried to mess with The Squadron

 Nut-ting, nut-ting

 Yeah we got these cats
 We get down like that
 Straight underground like that

Open Sesame, and let down the main gate
Before you scream EPMD, you should wait
I roll with a posse, can you try to stop me
Also yo, your brothers tried to pop me
On the sneak tip, without me knowin
So I keep goin, and my rhymes keep flowin
On and on, and I don't quit
I get pushed to the limit, and yo that's it
Step by step, I put an end to your fun
Cause I'm the chosen one, yes me my son
A young kid from the ghetto, a kiddie from the city
I don't feel sorrow, and I have no pity
To run up on you, and wax plus tax
Your gold, your money, and from your eyes your contacts
Then flex over, a hop skip and a jump
To the next town, to go punk a chump
MC's try to diss me, and try to bust caps
I'm not havin it, and that means no haps Jack
So get the bozack, and lay off the crack, cause that's wack
This is the big payback
(""Big payback"")

As I go and flow, to a different type of tempo
(Why MD?) C'mon E, cause P keep it simple
Plus I'm strikin like lightnin, throwin blows like Tyson
Slayin MC's on the Q-T, sorta like a sniper
So if a sucker don't like me, the feelin is mutual
I tune my rhyme to a low RPM, then shift to neutral
And crack a 40 (what kind) of Olde E
To slay an MC (how) on the Q-T
(So what's your name boy?) C'mon E, you know it's M.D
Now while I'm wreckin he's checkin, all the bodies that's left and
A pile behind the stage, the P is like steppin
Off from the scenes, I see lights and si-rens
Witness everywhere, but no one seen a thing
When cops ask questions, my description is vague
No answers at all, just bodies behind the stage
One witness yells out, that he was dressed in black
Stupid dookie link, with a Fisherman hat
When five-ohs ask how he fleed from the spot?
""In a black sports car, I think it was an Iroc
But the windows were tinted, and we couldn't get a look""
(Why?) There was smoke from the rubber he cooked
The big payback
..

No Rome-et-oh, or Juliette romance story
Just EPMD, the fame and the glory
The rappin technique, somethin like fencin
Dangerous, it keep you in suspense
And you have to be cool, and plus have stamina
Cause if you don't, I'm gonna end up stabbin ya
In your guts, from the razor cuts
And I'mma stick and pick, until your mind goes nuts
It might sound gross, or make your stomach bubble
But don't ever ever ever, mess with E Double
I'm like Jumpin Jack Flash, a Spy with an Eye
I do no stunts, and I'm not The Fall Guy
I'm just the E, the R-I-C-K, that's all
Say some check one-twos, and some yes yes y'alls
I'm the man of the hour, too sweet to be sour
(So what you sayin E?) I got ""Soul power!""
So dig it, as I kick it, keep your eyes open
Cause a brother like me, is always scopin
In fact, you should pack, because I cut no slack
It's like that.. this is the big payback
..

If rappin was a tribe I'd be the chief commanche
Hat, fat link, chunky rings, nothing fancy
So saddle up MC's, and off we go
It's not a rodeo, but I carry a lasso
Cause I'm back from vacation, cause sucker kept slippin
Rappin off-beat, plus they tune wasn't hittin
Don't wanna claim a style on the M-I-C
But I can go state to state, cold rippin shows with E
Cause whether maxin or relaxin, waxin or taxin
Never step to a show without packin
My partners, Mr. Smith and Mr. Wesson
So nothin moves funny, at the rappin session
I'm Strictly Biz and knuckles, no time for laugh or chuckles
I drop clear lyrics, while your bass sound muffled
(You sniff blow?) Hell no, and still flow and say dough
More or less do a show.. nahhh
The only high I get, is when my fans yell HOE
So get the bo-zack, cause we're back to hack
Here to let you know that it's the big payback",https://genius.com/Epmd-the-big-payback-lyrics
The Steve Martin,Strictly Business,1988.0,"Sick em champ...
Well I have a new dance, that you all must learn
You may have seen the Pee-Wee Herman but it's had it's turn
Now this brand new dance, I know you not with it
You might break your neck, to really try to get it
If you seen the clumsy movie it was called The Jerk
You had to check out Steve Martin as he started to work
He was doin freaky moves with his feet and head
With his blue farmer suit and his big Pro-Keds
Now if you wanna learn it, it really takes time
That's why I'm here now tellin you this rhyme
And if you never seen it, then I'll be startin
My brand new funky dance, called the Steve Martin
Like this... get em Steve, get em
Get em Steve, get em Steve, get em
Get em...
Like this...

Well the dance is def, and it's gonna last
I don't really think any other dance will pass
All the dancers out there tryin to freak on the floor
When they see me do the Martin they try to ignore
When they see my dance, they came to a surprise
I caught the suckers ducks speakin eye to eye
While they bitin my stuff, like I wasn't there
But they didn't have the right so, I didn't care
Sway your arms around your back, then across your chest
Do the crazy leg sweep from right to left
It's the Steve...

Like this...
Get em Steve, get em Steve, get em...
Get em Steve, get em Steve, get em...
Get em...
Well it's back to the man on the mic you see
Because I'm stuck to my dance like a dog on a flea
Now I know my dance is the funky dance comin
Pee-Wee Herman (BizMarkie) was pumpin (but mines is jumpin)
It's the Steve...
Like this, sick em champ
(Steve Martin's in full effect!)
Sick em champ
(Yo Steve's a weasel! Show em how your Steve Martin go)
Get em Steve, get em Steve, get em (repeat 4X)
(Ahh yeah, Steve Martin in full effect)
EPMD, strikin once again, funky fresh in the flesh
(True, yo, PMD! Oww, yeah...)
I be the P double E-M-D in the place
(Yeah check this out P, I think this is the last record of the album...
Awww we made it!)
Yo yo what time is it?

Nineteen eighty-eight is so great, and eighty-nine even better
And don't forget, to take off that hot sweater...
Yeah check this out y'all!
We got this funky track, ahh, yo yo yo
Check this out homeboys
Because we dope, the dope-di-dope-di-dope-di-dope
The dope-di-dope-nope-we-ain't-no-joke
No-joke-no-joke, so PMD!! Yo!!
We ain't no joke, no-joke-no-joke-no-joke-the-dope
(On the Columbo tip!)
I'm the real deal homeboy, for real
(On the strength!)
Because we in there, yes we in there
And we're outta here, like last year
(We lost the bandwagon, because I'm housin...)
We goin straight for the kill because you're loungin

Strictly Snappin’ Necks,Unfinished Business,1989.0,"Just when you thought it was safe to make records
The rap duo is back, it's time to start wreckin'
E Double swingin' high *scratch* I'm swingin' low
Washin' wannabees down, with some H20
As I go blow to blow, toe to toe, flow for flow
(Any has PMD?) Hell no!
I'm blowin' rappers off course, like the S.S. Minnow
That's not your rhyme sonny, so please let go my Eggo
""I hear voices sayin' that's Erick Sermon""

Straight up, right now, I'm on a mission
Front face the center and face your competition
As I rock, you jock, and in shock
And have fear -- when the E is on the spot
(You pulled the mic handle: Joker, Joker, Joker)
Yeah boy, you hit the jackpot
So chill as I flex my skill and rap talent
Smooth hardcore, no time for love ballads
I'm not kickin' the slow jams that's cool
But now the hardcore that make the brothers a act fool
That's the way I would want stuff lookin'
The crowd yellin', and buckwhylin' like Brooklyn boy
""EPMD is in town""
 No words at all boy
""Strictly snappin' necks!""
""EPMD is in town""
 No words at all boy
""Strictly snappin' necks!""

Welcome... and all aboard
Crab tried to diss, now it's time to score
People, tripped and flipped, when we splurged our gift
To get paid off what we made, and also uplift
A new way to sway, or should I say flow
To keep the ladies screamin' 'OW', the brothers yellin' 'ho'
Now hold the O, and give me an intro
A kick and a snare, now the green light to go
I flex a rhyme on a rapper then proceed to wreck
By break this mic in half, then put him in the yolk and snap his neck
When five-oh roll, they say what's the M.O
Another rapper was hit, by Mister Slow Flow
'Cause on my second return, I had to come correct
Takin' nuttin but bodies, on the Unfinished Business tip
I make the music, that makes a posse ill
In they Jeeps or playin' ball, or ready to chill
Or maybe at the spot where you hang where it's hot
Drinkin' quarts of Old Gold, in the parkin' lot
But mainly at a concert where the place is packed
Brothers yellin 'ho', girlies on the bozack
The system boomin', smoke everywhere
People swayin' side to side with they hands in the air
A posse digs the music so they want to roll
So they troop through the venue, scopin' everyone's gold
But whether you in New York, Detroit, L.A. or Miami
Approach with caution, 'cause brothers pack jammies
In they coat pocketbooks, and even they jock
You on the wrong brother, and you bound to get popped
""I hear voices sayin' that's Erick Sermon""

Hurry hurry and step right up
The best show on earth, EPMD yea word up
And featuring the man on the cut
He who don't believe can get the (macadamia) NUTS
So whassup homeboy, there's any static?
Do we have to ?? and get dramatic?
Or can we cool and be jolly old chaps
Or break loose, pull out guns and bust caps?
Nah, I don't think you want that
So I cool, and instead I bust raps
Like check one two, and you don't quit
And match a funky dope rhyme that fits
I say a rhyme and change the whole subject
And still flow, and freak the whole public
It can't be done, especially by a crab MC
Who came out the crack rehab
You must be mad, in fact, kind of rad
You not a smooth criminal, you soft and I'm bad
Don't mean to brag, I'm just makin a point
Some say I'm def, the old school say I'm the joint
Fencin, no half-steppin, straight up and down
I gets mine, so you should cool and lounge when
""EPMD is in town""
 No words at all boy

 No words at all boy

Get Off the Bandwagon,Strictly Business,1988.0,"Ayo, what's up E Double?

Yo, whole thing man, got a lot of customers out there man, trying to get paid off what we made

Ayo, rapping ain't your field, you took the wrong trade. So you'd better get a grip on them lips, and get off the...
 Ayo, yo, yo, I be the P-twice E-M-D
 I be the E-double E in the place to be
 Ayo what up E man, we in there man?
 You know we in there, trying to get paid, you know what I'm saying?
 Yo, we gotta step out hard this year
 P check this out, this is how it's going down

There was a Hardy Boy mystery you're trying to solve
Can't understand why you got involved
And here's the clue – try the ghetto master blaster
Now think who causes disaster
Clue number two, you give up?
I figured, it was K La Boss on the cut
He had help, sucka duck and now that's clue number three
You wrong, 'cause it was EPMD

MCs, get off the bandwagon
I'm not bragging, but tagging
And snagging the biter that tries to imitate
Time to go on strike and demonstrate
On the foe, that does not N-O
That if he pulls my card, I'm good to flow
Toe to toe, blow to blow, without no H2O
Ayo, you want to battle? I'm good to G-O
Get off the bandwagon (sucka)
Get off the bandwagon

This ain't a blast from the past, it's a boomer from the future
Feel free to scream ""Ho"" or ""Yo"" if it suits you
While the bass is booming and your face is glooming
Saying the E-double E is def, you're not assuming
They're only one of many that think a jealous fellow
Say ""yep"" and then step because I'm cooler

Hmm... now you're through, your ho not boo
Or I be on that butt like Krazy Glue
I roll into the party as if I was Five-O
Book investigate the biter like Columbo
Pushing rap for some info in exchange for a jumbo
And when I find a sucka it's time to play Rambo
Or Commando, you know?
I knew it was the sucka with the new Jackson 5 afro
We rock rhymes then we we run 'em a while
Sucka MCs catch on, then they bite our style
They get confused, dazed, and amused
Sweating and thing because our rhymes they used
Seen us in the crowd, now they're thrown off course
They run around like a chicken with their heads cut off
Get off the bandwagon
Ayo, man listen when I tell you sucka, get off!
Get off the bandwagon

While my body was swaying, you was saying
""Who is that brother?"" while the record was playing
I felt kinda happy like an ego trip
I had to lounge 'cause my image is hip
My tradition is dissing in this position
And right about now I'm in perfect condition
So don't get mad, and don't stop hissing
Don't say nothing homeboy just listen

No time for playing, sucka MCs I be slaying
Get off the bandwagon, you know what I'm saying?
I devastate the hip-hop scene
Keep the feet moving like a dancing machine
E got my back (yeah) La Boss is on scratch
Meanwhile I'm in groove with the beat on wax
I'm in my own world, no room for distraction
Controlling MCs while La Boss keeps scratching

 Yo, yo hold up wait a minute guys man
 You guys mind if I go witchu to this club man?
 Ahah aiyyo man E I don't know about that man
 Last time we took somebody with us man

 The whole nine yars, yaknowhatI'msayin man?
 Nah man, that's not me man, I can handle my liquor man
 I just go to have a good time and DANCE man
 Drinkin is no problem to me, stuff tastes like fruit punch
 Are you sure man?
 Positive man -- positively positive
 Aight man, l-let's take him then
 We went out that night
 To a club downtown
 That was very high class
 And had boomin sounds
 We went in
 And we were dressed to impress
 Fly women and girlies
 Lookin their very best
 We took a seat at the bar
 Feelin brand new
 Frank ordered drinks, no liquor
 Just plain old brew
 He finished it
 Then he ordered one more
 And another
 And another
 And that made four
 He seen this fly girlie
 Suave and deboinaire
 Light skinned complexion
 With long black hair
 But this girl was ug-ly
 I mean her body was through
 But after four drinks or more
 She looked like Paula Abdul

You know what baby?  You startin to look good
You startin to look REAL good
You startin to remind me of that superstar - Paula Abdul
 The party was over
 It was time to go
 You insisted on drivin
 When we said no

Nah guys, y'know?  I can drive myself home man
That ain't gonna be no problem
I drive better when I feel nice (P: Are you sure man?)
Are you kidding me man?
That stuff in there, that stuff in there taste like fruit punch
I could drink that all night
 So you got in your car
 Swervin on the road
 There was a cop in the bushes
 On radar patrol
 The light turned green
 And you decided to stop
 It turned red
 You took off
 And got pulled over by a cop
Chorus: repeat 4X
 You overdid it homes
 You had too much to drink
	* police siren sound *

Ah excuse me, can I see your license and registration please?
I don't have my license registration right NOW
But if you give me a chance, I can go home and get it
Oh what are you a wiseguy son?
No I don't mean to be a wiseguy officer
The honest truth, what really happened is
I just came from a plane from Dominican Republic
By the time I got to Motor Vehicle, Motor Vehicle was closed
Oh it was closed?
Yeah it was closed
Oh what's your name son?
My name is Frankie Nato, but my friends, they call me Frank B
How bout you officer - whatchu call yourself?
Oh this guy's a real wiseguy
Who's the young lady in the passenger seat?
You don't know who that is?  That's a superstar
Paula Abdul, say hi Paula
Oh yeah that's Paula Abdul?
Have you been drinkin son?
Oh no I don't drink man, the only thing I drink is fruit punch
OK son you wanna turn your car off
And leave the keys in the ignition and come with me please?
Where we goin officer?
I want you to come sit in the backseat
And blow in this tube for me please
Wait a minute, I ain't no faggot
I never blow anything in my life, and don't plan to
How bout you officer - you blowin anything?
Just blow into the tube son
Okay okay man * blows into the tube *
	Oh what's this man?  Two point oh?
Oh Guns'n'Roses dude!
You might as well get ?
Cause you goin downtown sonny, you're drunk!
So whatchu tryin to tell me officer?
You tryin to tell me that that machine, tell me I'm drunk man?
Somethin wrong with that machine
That machine need a good fixin man
That's what I think officer
No you know what I think son?
I think you need a good lawyer
Let me tell you officer, I have a lawyer
My lawyer is so good, SO SO good
And by the time he's finished witchu, you gonna be workin in Alaska
So dress warm, as a matter of fact
I suggest you go out and buy yourself a sheepdog
Cause it gets BITTERLY cold out there
Chorus
 Have you ever been coolin
 On a Friday night
 Wit your friends gettin wasted
 Just feelin nice
 You continued to drink
 When you know you should stop
 The next thing you know
 You're behind is caught
 Your body gets numb
 So you slow up the pace
 Your mouth gets watery
 And you can't feel your face
 You finally make it home
 And the fun begins
 You try to pass out
 But here comes the spins
 So you turn and toss
 Then you toss and turn
 Your head gets light
 And your chest starts to burn
 So you lay on your stomach
 And you tuck in your chin
 Pail by your bedside
 Now the breathing begins

Oh, oh God, just let me get through this last one
If you let me make it
If you let me make it through the night God
I promise I'll never have another drink again
I'll never drink again, as long as I live
* pukes several times *
Chorus

You overdid it
Hey yo this is EPMD tellin you not to drink and drive
Cause ain't nuttin cool about chillin in a coffin six feet under
YouknowwhatI'msayin?

Yo, this is Frank B
And learn from others mistakes homes!

And don't let peer pressure get to you
Cause it costs you, or your life, or somebody else's life
In the long run

And it's like that
And if you don't believe you can get the bozack

See-ya!

Who’s Booty,Unfinished Business,1989.0,"Yo, at a hip-hop club was a girl I met
She was hot you can bet, her body dripped with sweat
I kicked it to her, and her name was Kim
She said let's jet because she was ready for the Jim
Browski I doubt thee E would front
So like a real stunt, I rolled the Blunt
She was ready, I could see it in her face
She said ""let's jet"" we went back to her place
It was fat, she had a dope crib
She offered food, like some barbucue ribs
I said ""No thank you, not now honey
How about some drink,"" ""yes some Gin Rummy""
""After that, come here and sit down""
We put on tender Roni by Mister Bobbi Brown
We waste no time, it was time to do it
Put on some James Brown so we can get into it
No kinky stuff, like ropes or handcuffs
But when you love me please don't be rough
I said ""listen, I'LL BE GENTLE, I'LL BE VERY GENTLE
WHEN I'm LOVING YOOOOUUU
WHEN I'm LOVING YOOOOUUU
...So I dipped, I abandoned ship
Threw in the anchor like on the boat tip
That's what I get for trying to be a lover
But never judge a book, by its damn cover
I'm not dissing, but I don't like fishing
And next time, I want to know who I'm kissing
You can call me gay or a tutti-frutti
But I won't touch it until I know who's Booty

Well I was maxin' one day just minding my own
Talking to E-Double on my car cellular phone
When I seen this fly girl clocking her looks were temptating
The look in her eye was the look of infatuation
So I put my car in park, turned my system down
I said ""Excuse me, are you new in town""
She said ""it's funny you asked I just got here today""
I said ""Yo, you need a lift because I'm going that way""
She said ""My mother always told me not to ride with strangers
And if I did, than my life would be in danger""
I said ""Yeah that's true, but I'm not you're everyday swinger
To tell you the truth, I'm a well known singer""
Plus I was cold coolin', 40 dawn in lap
Wings on my fingers from my fisherman hat
She got in and said ""Yo I never done this before""
I had to play my cards right to get my foot in the door
I said ""Yeah, my name is Parrish but they call me MD
For the way I hold the mic and slay MCs""
She was lost and replied, ""You a medical doctor?""
I said ""close but no cigar, I'm the microphone doctor
Who performs open surgery, on MCs who are willing
Except to try and save them, I try to kill 'em""
She said ""Ooh that sounds exciting, please tell me more""
You mean how we pack the heinz and clock the G's or more
We got to her house and her moms wasn't home
As we went to the room I sparked up the homegrown
I was with it, felling nice from Old E
Ready to get busy, and wax a cold booty
We got to her room it was time to max
Pulled out the Jimhat and strapped the Bozak
I hit the lights, and next was the sack
We started doing it, it was hard to produce
Because the booty was cold kickin like They Call Me Bruce
I had to cover my nose, not to ruin the mood
Because I knew I wasn't fishing but I smelled seafood
Smelled like shrimp or lobster, or tuna of the sea
And it wasn't worth catching the A to I to D to the S oh yes
The S is for safe sex
And as I glanced through the door, yo that move was next
But then she pulled me close, and said ""Let's get loose""
When out of nowhere I yelled ""Baby did you do...""
She said no P, cause I'm not a swinger
I couldn't buy that as I smelled my forefinger
I was playing myself plus my style was cramped
I grabbed my keys and coat, and MD broke camp
And as I walked to the door, the girl got moody
I looked her eye to eye and said.. ""WHO'S BOOTY""",https://genius.com/Epmd-whos-booty-lyrics

Uh-huh
Yeah, aww yeah, uhh ""Richter Scale""
It goes lights, camera, action I'm on
One more time to kill em, my rap flow is fulfilling
I scream with the Beastie Boys -- What time is it?
It's two o'clock, you gettin knocked out the box
Then kicked off the block, Def Squad Hit Squad
No we won't stop, fuck it call the cops (uh-huh)
I be the invincible, in the school of hard knocks
I'm the principal, Fatman Joe y'know

As you suffer the repercussions, comin through the blaze
Bust the crime scene, cause some drama, niggas duckin
When we come through, throwin the jab, in the one-two
Layin MC's out to trap, when we run through (like what?)
Like the marathon, flooded with the diamonds on
Get my rhymin on, PMD fuckin shinin on
Back to Biz, new address with the fat crib
My shit in the Wiz, poli'-in with the big wigs

Off the meter, and everytime we reach the
Tip-top and ya don't stop, uhh!
In the field of rap, we pull rank no question
We top the ""Richter Scale""

Bust the techniques, E.D. fantastic
Unreal GangStarr shit, Mass Appeal
Rap's top dawg, I'm the one you call on
To get Sic'-Wid-It, E don't forget it
I'm six, two and a half, heavyset, chocolate brown
Hell of a jab, gift to gab
I'm the elite, keep it underground like street level
I rock a Rolex watch, with a diamond bezel

Rap terror terror, EPMD, a new era
Off the richter scale, blowin hotter than ever
With the Squadron, beg your pardon, got the heads noddin
Lost your mind and said, ""Shit!!"" when we barged in
The front door door, rugged, keeps our shit raw raw
Make hits for the fans, plus the world tour
Believe that, peep that E and P's back
Wreckin heads daily, so chill and Get the Bozack

Yo Royal Flush-in, all my cats be bustin
Servin you Customers and those fake hustlers
Whassup? Step to me, I smack you silly
I'm the Kid, but no comparison to Billy
I ain't scared of you motherfuckers -- can't you tell?
Girls lose to me when they groove to Maxwell, uhh
I got one life to live so I'm livin
Got girls to be hittin more cars to be drivin

We stripped too many beats to make too many niggas to break
No moves are fake, no warnin shots fired blastin on crews like corrupt Jakes
The Black Viper, scream on MC's and rhyme cyphers
More Dangerous Mind than, Michelle Pfeiffer
So skedaddle-daddle, you get rattled don't wanna battle-battle
Put one to your rhyme saddle, stompin through, like wild cattle
We flow beef so dead that, let that shit cease
I'm quick with the hands, plus accurate with the two-piece

Boy-ar-dee's niggas nice, and plus I'm def
Tiggedy take your life asthma
The jibbedy jibber jabber ruff rapper
I wreck it then I step like a ladder
So add a, niggedy nother page into my rap book
I strike like, the weapon or a mother at the crack book
I giggedy give a fender, figgedy bender, to a tender, roni
Like umm, Chachi, then Joni
She'll stagger, 
when I move my lips like Mick Jagger
She'll go goo-goo, gah-gah, they call me Ali Baba
The jibbedy jibber jabber, the jibbedy jibber jabber, jaw
Riggedy wreck it quick and get, raw
I'm thiggedy throwin the slang, like a boomer-rang
Kill the rumor, bang, 
I steal the show like I used to steal Puma's
Then I dropkick, a topic from the sewer or the trash can
I'm niggedy not the video game, but 
I'm like Pac Man
I'm slick right, I got more Dick than Van Dyke
Liggedy let the nines clap, cause I'm back to the Manpike",https://genius.com/Epmd-cummin-at-cha-lyrics
"It Wasn’t Me, It Was the Fame",Unfinished Business,1989.0,"As the wind sets the mood, it's time to let off
A sucker tried to play me, the E I'm not soft
I'm very hardcore, droppin' bombs like Warsaw
It reminds me, back in 1984
When I went to a party with the master plan
To step up, and put the mic in my hand
Everybody was there, from junior high to high schools
Dyin' to get busy, because I knew I had the tools
Then I got the heart and went by the set
I said, ""Yo, I wanna rock the set"" ""Yeah no sweat""
Kickin' rhymes in the place, people couldn't take it
The style I flowed, the way I shaked and baked it
Later on I made a record, and got recognition
Everybody's jockin', now nobody's dissin'
Written and produced by the new rap duo
Yes EPMD, now I'm known in school
I see the backstabbers, and the elderly creature features
That used to diss me, when I was tryin' to reach the
Tip tip-top and I won't stop
To be the master, in the field of hip-hop
I did that, and got a name for myself
The image of E, and all of my wealth
I see my fake friends, but things ain't the same
Oh what a shame, I diss 'em
Who to blame? It wasn't me it was the .. ""Fame!""
 It wasn't me it was the .. ""Fame!""

Before I cut records I had dreams of livin large
Earnin' crazy cash flow, the whole nine yards
But when I told my college friends they kicked back and laughed
Said, ""You better grab your books and take your behind to class""
They said, ""You couldn't make a record and expect to get paid
'Cause there's too many def rappers in the world today""
I said, ""Yo, my name is M.D. and my style is def""
They said, ""Your name is Parrish son, you're like all the rest
Frontin' you gettin' a contract, but then you 'fess""
But when you heard my record playin', your mouth was wide open
Your head was tilted back that you was almost chokin'
But I just lounge, and cool with the fellas
Like my roomie D-Wade, Top Notch, and James Ellis
I never hung with girls, only one and she was mellow
First name was Terry, last name Romanello
My records started sellin' then P withdrew
From the college Southern Con, known as SCSU
But when I often go and visit they say, ""P bust a rhyme""
I shake my head and then chuckle, and throw up the peace sign
They wanna feel my gold and sport my Rolex
But P reply it's really nothin', and don't like to flex
And when I step up on the scene I always hear them whisper
""Yo P's not the same, did you see him diss you?""
I go deep into my thoughts, then I questioned my brain
It wasn't me, the money, or the fortune, it was the .. ""Fame!""
 It wasn't me it was the .. ""Fame!""

Oh!
Now you wanna know me, before you wasn't speakin'
Now you watch Yo! MTV Raps every weekend
Just to see me, the E, and the P
Coolin' out on the scene, with Fab 5 Freddy
Back then you didn't know, that I was determined
To be a def rapper with the name Erick Sermon
To be a crowd mover, someone that cause trouble
Then I thought, and came up with E Double
I can't forget, how they used to diss
Sayin' he can't rap, because he talks with a lisp
But I got paid, now you feel stupid
Amazed by the style the sound and how we looped it
Now I clock G's, trunk jewels, and star trims
Cool around town, and flex my black Benz
Definitely hooked up, with the system that cranks
Living well off, with dinero in the bank
EPMD, is Erick Parrish Making Dollars
Always on tour, so you can call us  scholars
You saw me in eighty-seven, where have you been because we miss you
I dismissed you, it wasn't me who dissed you, it was the .. ""Fame!""
 It wasn't me it was the .. ""Fame!""

As I freak a funky style, to a funky fresh rhythm
I use my crazy def talent, that God has given
Me to flow slow, and still live large
To drop a def LP, and catch MC's off guard
Because my friends started buggin', we used to cool at the mall
But on the S.T., the Sneak Tip, they prayed for my downfall
I used to cruise by in my rock and always hear them mumble
""They got lucky on Strictly Biz but watch the next one crumble""
My father always told me to wisen up son
'Cause if you hung with nine broke friends, you're bound to be the tenth one
So I cut my friends off, and P went for self
Me and Erick Sermon, and no one else
Strictly writin' def lyrics to my best ability
With the crazy imagination as my only utility
'Cause MC's around my way brag how def they are
But now they workin' full time, and sharin' their mom's cars
Always frontin' to the girls, how hard you can rock
But you leave out how you carpool to go punch the clock
Yeah we came hittin' hard, so all the talkin' had to halt
But don't blame us, blame God, it's his fault
For assistin' us on the mission of a point of no return
To do a crab MC, who did not learn
Now when you're hot you're hot, and when you're not you're not
And when it comes to funky music, the two rock the spot
So next time you see me coolin', bite your lip and respect
Between me and you sonny, straight up, I'm like death
I cooled on the Run tour, with Flavor and Chuck
Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince but I guess that was luck
I did shows in crazy countries, like Europe and France
Copenhagen, Denmark, and Amsterdam
I even been to our country, that they call Africa
Keep your eyes on your girl, 'cause P'll be watchin' around the
Tick tick'n, yo check out P rippin'
A new way to sway, 'cause brothers keep vickin'
Flows and echoes, that sound exact
But you're rhymin' in circles, and you ain't sayin' jack
So take it in stride, by the way I'm still the same
First name is still Parrish, Sue's my girl, nuttin' changed
You insist I act funny, but who's to blame?
It wasn't Yo! MTV Raps, the money, or Soul Train
It was the .. ""Fame!""
 It wasn't me it was the .. ""Fame!""

Hold me down (Hold me down), uh, yo

I grab the mic and grip it hard like it's my last time to shine
I want the chrome and the cream so I put it down for mine
Ill cat, slick talk, slang New York
To break it down to straight English, what the fuck you want?
Remember me, you punk faggot crab emcee?
Get your shit broke in half for fuckin' around with P
Ayo, strike two, my style Brooklyn like the Zoo
Hey you (Look, nigga), one more strike you through
Word is bi-dond, rock Esco, FUBU, and Phat Fi-darm
Every time I get my spit on, no doubt, I spark the gridiron
Step up and bless the track and spit a jewel
We keeps cool, no need for static, I strap tools

Next up, yo I believe that's me
Yo, get on the mic and rock the symphony (Yo, P)

Time to rock, the sound I got, it rings hot
Make your neck snap back like a slingshot
E hustle, I muscle my way in
Then tussle for days in, on my own with guns blazin'
Not for the fun of it, just for those who want me to run it
Then leave them like, ""Who done it?""
Sucka duck, I do what I feel right now
When I spit the illest shit, cats be like, ""Wow!""
Yo, I get looks when I'm in the place
That's that nigga, makin' you smile with Scarface
Uh, it ain't my fault that my style slick enough to shock ya
Hit you with the fifth, block-a block-a
If I get caught you can bet I'll blow trial
Be downtown swingin' M.O.P. style

Next up, yo, I believe that's me
Yo (Danze) get on the mic and rock the Symphony

Say hello to the devil's advocate, whenever tragic hit
It's E, M.O.-PMD blastin' shit
Put in work in this cold game
Soldier (Soldier), I use work as code name
Told ya, line 'em up like it's Soul Train (Brrah)
And I give em the whole thing
My family has been trained to swat 'em if they plastic
Hit 'em and make 'em do a semi-backflip
(Bad shit) I'm donatin' a casket
We have raised hell in midtown and got down in traffic
(Tell 'em what you sayin)
Get the bozack before I tear your maggot ass flat

Next up, yo I believe that's me (Fame)
Get on the mic for the Symphony

Presentin' the real, straight from B'Ville
Motherfuckers don't like Fame 'cause I'm not cream filled
I feel what I speak so I speak what I feel
Sleep and I will creep and I kill
Motherfuck (Who know?) Jump out a Yugo
Open up your back with a MAC-uno-uno
Ghetto-bound nigga, I break all laws
Drink brews, curse out bitches and piss on walls
This rap game is a street game now, the game switched
Rappers are gettin' killed now with the same shit
I ain't no motherfuckin' role model
Kids don't follow 'cause I'ma hit this bitch full throttle
The type to write ""Fuck 5-0"" in your lobby
Rap is my religion, gear bikes is a hobby
Show love when you meet us, it's love when you greet us
Or the First Family will come see you with the heaters

So whatcha sayin'?

I go wild as I sip from a cold Löwenbräu
Set up rhymes like fire to gunpowder
Boom, did the bassline crank
From being rated R, from being top rank
I'm hard like an erection
Phrases might get too tough to break down in sections
So I grab a pen and pad, I'm back
To make a killer, similar to a backstab
Don't arrest me, arrest my brain, it's insane
If I'm booty, then I've been framed
By an MC, who can't be the R-E-D
Fuck with me, you'll get slapped up and capped up easy
By me and a tre-eight, pistol, so vacate the premises
Or ask Mayday, Mayday
For H-E-L-P, brothers tell me
I'm electrifyin', similar to rail three
I don't brag and boast but smash and roast
MC's wit degrees from here to the West Coast
I'm miracle, with no abrakadaba
Piece of membranes will smash like crackers
Were they Ritz, Saltine, or Town House
None of the above get caught with the roundhouse
Kick, blackflip, semifull
My vocal chord prove my pull ain't bull
I'm down with the Squad, no more than four to five brothers
Six or more, you seen got smothered

Cold wreck the nigga with the help of E-D
Aggravation, don't need it, so get off my dick
Master of disaster, no time for flicks
Straight up b-boy, Real McCoy like Bruce Leroy
Strap the bozack when I'm stabbin' a skeezoid
Gangsta rap, it's Daddy Mack with a bozack
Roy the funk punk pumps skunk like a smokestack
So swing low and lick up balls
I'm like Schwarzenegger, correcting shit in Total Re-
Call
 up E-D and the posse that's ten deep
To wax a sucker nigga booty rappin' MC
So step off, 'cause you gets no props
So stick the fork in him, Redman, (why?), 'cause he's done

I'm E-D, I belong wit the A-Team
A one man wreckin' machine, by all means
Necessary, I destroyed on contact
No fear, of gettin' killed 'cause I'm strapped
The Hit Squad's deep, makin' it sweet
To creep, on my crew so you don't sleep
My mic is caffeine, similar to Maxwell
Making it smooth for me, yes, to wax well
And you might get scared and spark a stove
'Cause I pack steel but Hold On like En Vogue
My swiftness, I got a gift not for Christmas
God bless, mmm-hmm, can I get a witness?

No toy, I'm a hardcore b-boy

Jane 3,Business As Usual,1990.0,"Parrish Smith:
One hot summer day back around the way
A new kid moved onto the block and his name was Jay
Jay was cool, he trucked jewels, packed a nine mil
Yeahhh, and kept his Smitty's on his tool
Erick Sermon:
Anyway Jay portrayed to be like gard
So we took him in, and put him down with the Hit Squad
His house was phat, full court in the back
Jacuzzi in his bedroom, a welcome on the doormat
P - Plus AZT, full house alarm system
One rottweiler, one pitbull, no one could vic him
E - Something strange about the crib, I had to think
Why the whole god damn house was dressed in hot pink
P - Yo Jay, where's your bathroom, bust a move I gotta piss
E - Three doors on the left homeboy, ya can't miss
P - My head was busted
E - Disgusted
P - I said, ""What's goin on?""
I seen a douche bag, and Safety maxi-pad tampons
E - Left the bathroom, went back where I was
P - Tapped Jay on the shoulder and said
E - ""Eiyyyooo cuz""
P - ""I thought you lived alone""
E - ""I do""
Parrish Smith:
""Are you certain?
There's bras and leotards, hangin on the curtain
Yo Jay what's your problem, homeboy you look stunned
What are you doin?  Put down that knife... where's my gun?""
Shit's thick, I reached for my tool I wasn't strapped
Left the nine in the car, right next to the jim hat
It's my ass, I better think fast real quick
I got a flashback *AHH* from a Bruce Lee flick
Got in my stance
E - Don't lie
P - Kay I broke for the door
Tripped on some bullshit in the living room floor
Jay rushed me, I grabbed him, scooped him up in the yoke
E - Ahh Shit
P - Kicked him in the nuts
E - That's ALL she wrote
P - It was like Rapunzel
E - Rapunzel?
P - Down came his hair
E - Titties popped out
P - And there was ass everywhere
E - Jay a transvestite?
P - Not quite he was more like
*J to the A to the N to the E*
E - Yo P, don't tell me, you went out like a sucker
P - Chill, took off that mustache, grabbed that ass and I fucked her
Peace, I'm Audi 5000 *laughing*
E - Audi 5000
P - Ahh shit!
All of that real shit, you know what I'm saying?
E - Jane?  Haircut, haircut like Anita Baker?
P - The whole shit.  Yo E, the whole shit, you know what I'm saying?
Nah you can't man, I ran right up in her like Bruce Jenner
E - But better
P - Right in there man, I didn't even care, are you crazy?

E - This is me... is this the doctor M.D.?
Yo P it's kinda early, who's there Laverner and Shirley?
Is it Kate and Allie, or some other girlie?
Well anyway, yo P you know I'm lazy
Callin me this time of hour you must be crazy
P - Excuse me, but I'm sorry E Double
It's a terrible situation and it might cause trouble
Put  on your coat jump in your Benz and come over
E - Why P?
P - Yo, I think Jane is on my sofa
E - What?
P - Last night I was all alone
Cold watch the boob tube, because my fuse was blown
Picked up the bat phone, to drop a line to you
Maybe 10:15, or maybe 10:22
E - Where was I?
P - I don't know, you wasn't there
Threw on the link Rolex watch and fresh gear
I grabbed my key, along with the cash flow
Shifted out the door to the local disco
E - Where'd you go, not to that ran down pub
P - Hell no... I was coolin at a club
It was Spanish night, so I was drinkin Molta
Threw on a little tango, plus a little salsa
Seen a fly girl, standin next to me
So I slid over to her very non-chalantly
She was DEF, body perfectly fit
She was packin, a 300-E with the kit
I said, ""Kitten, how ya doin miss?""
I said, ""Hello my name is Parrish""
E - ""Hi, my name is Cris""
P - ""Can I buy you a drink?""
E - ""Yes""
P - ""What will it be?""
E - ""A Martini and Rossi, Asti Spumante
By the way is that your Cadillac Allante
Parked outside right next to my Monte
Carlo?  You can call it, my ex-husband bought it.""
P - POOF! My ego appeared and said it's time to go for it
""This place is a drag, grab your coat and bag
We'll have drinks on the house, back at my pad.""
We got to my house we walked through the door
Threw on ""Night and Day"" by
E - Al B. Sure
P - She grabbed me, gave me kiss on the lips
So I grabbed the cold booty and caressed the hips
I got ahead of myself, because I wanted to flirt
Took off the G-strings and the V-neck skirt
POOF! my ego appeared
E - Yeah it's time to do work
P - I felt the movement below so it's time to react
I went in my Bat utility belt and pulled out a jim hat
I bust a move... when it came to that
But then she freaked it, and grabbed the bozack
Started doin it, then she called me the master
E - You got bigger, better, stronger and much faster
P - At first I laughed, as if it was a joke
But then my heart skipped a beat, and I lost a stroke
I said to myself, oh no it couldn't be
The J to the A to the N to the E
E - Yo P don't tell me it was Jane you were douchin
With the Anita Baker haircut
P - Nah more like Whitney Houston
E - While the record's still playing to Al B. Sure's ""Effect Mode""

Never sweating no click (Why P?) 'Cause I'm a b-boy
When we on the scene, we always rock the spot
The Green-Eyed Bandit, Scratch and Mic Doc
In the beginning we had to let the world know
Now, EPMD is clocking all the dough
Sit back and relax, of course the biz phat
TV with the phone in the back
Always calm under pressure, no need to act ill
Listen when I tell you boy, You Gots to Chill
{""Jungle Boogie""}

I be the fly rhyme maker, female heartbreaker
The dude want to play me and my crew, that's rude
I'm dope, when I get down to the beat
I'm raw, I keep it hardcore for the streets
My track's a miracle drug for thugs in the clubs
(Yo E, I remember when they used to be scrubs, what up?)
I'm the big bear and some of y'all are baby cubs
Talking large money when I seen your bank stubs
I take control of your body and soul
Pack heat in my pants when it's time to roll
Well it's P, Double-E, M-D-E-E
Here to bless the track and flip the flow with E
When we touch the microphone, no doubt we always shine
Jewels and rhymes, setting traps and land mines
Did thousand of shows, laced many places
EPMDs back and yo, throw the tape in
'Cause when we come around, we always come with the flavor
Underground hardcore funk, that's what we gave you
Or give you, aiyo what's next on the menu
Business to tend to, stadiums and venues
With E and I'm the microphone doc
And the capital E, capital P, capital M, D
There's no doubt, the world shocker
Hit Squad and Def Squad, yeah we both get ill
So believe me when I tell you boy, You Gots to Chill
{""Jungle Boogie""}

Yo, I'm in the house now
Dudes with ice grills raise they eyebrow, amazed like, ""Wow!""
E and P return like D
Last Dragon to show MCs just what's happening
I get biz and that's an natural fact
I'm like Zorro, I mark an E on your back
Worse than that, I crown those wannabe gangsters
Say something to 'em and run right through 'em
I'm making crazy G's politicking on my mobile phone
The E-Double about the microphone
'Cause we're the funky rhyme maker, puffing Garcia Vegas
The one who rocks the fisherman hat
I grab the mic and make the crowd react
We keep the money stacking, fingers snapping toes tapping
When it's time to roll, uzi patrol, we're still packing
EPMD, the mic's our only friend
Took a break for a while and now we back again
So if you think about gambling, you better come prepared
EPMD's taking all the shares, You Gots to Chill",https://genius.com/Epmd-you-gots-to-chill-97-lyrics
It’s My Thang ’99,Out of Business,1998.0," (DJ Clue)
Yeah, what up, yo it's Mr. Keith Murray
The Lyrical Lexicon, the matador metaphor (NEW SHIT)
Wit my niggas Redman and the EPMD, the Squadron (It's My Thing '99)
Nawsayin? One time for DJ Clue, check it out (STUPID)
Aiyyo, we got these hoes spreaded out like mustard
The Squad go to war like General Custer
I just lost my a-alike, and I'm takin it hard
And havin bad dreams of spooky voices and graveyards

First of all, I'm the E of EPMD
Rockin the Player Way like Eightball & MJG
Squadron, my click be fully armed
I got dough, my account be fat and formed

Drinkin a Beck's, all day I think about sex
Got the gaze to knock the ""A"" off your 'Virex
Who am I? D-O, my M-O is fuck P-O
Luv ta Fuck Ya, fuck ya, fuck ya, fuck ya

Aiyyo I detonate on impact
So niggas better get back
The playahaters stay off the dick, P ain't wit that
The blunt, I split that, bust a four wit the kick back
No need to stress that chickenhead nigga, already hit that

I put the pow in the wow like gun to the powder
Give the hardcore niggas something they could be proud of
I get out of hand like I lost my arm
Decipher the head of c-cipher like Voltron

Who got wins? those that be hard pretend
You got skills? come here, let me tap that chin
Bing, 
my style ropa-dope around the ring
I'm well promoted, and don't even know Don King

Call me the 
Sam Cassell
, shots two minute on the clock
Cops know the SL handle well
Can tell by the nails you frail
We can battle till your girl big ass feet out them Chanels

Aiyyo my brain attack this hip hop shit aggressively
My recipe, mixed wit stress and niggas testin me
Consecutively, five golds so technically
You niggas got a long way to go to catch the PMD

Aiyyo we put you to the test, put it through your chest
Make a mothafucker catch a cardiac arrest
Live out the Fresh Fest, one of the best
I asked my nigga Red Alert, he said ""YEESSSSS""

I intimidate MC's from the throwing of my vocal tone
It don't work, I show em the chrome and flash the greens
Coincide wit the red beam, and hear about it all day on Street Scene

I Welcome niggas like Kotter to the night marauder
Pull out my gat, you'll be like ""AAAGH!!"" like Godfather
I hang small, but when I'm hard I'm gigantic
In fact, my big-ass dick sunk the Titanic

An MC massacre, got a click and crew ready to blast at ya
(Why these niggas mad, P?) cuz we the masters (CLUE!!)
We catch you niggas wit glass, and who you gon askin
Like you gaspin, backin up while P's blastin

I'll be like ""ROOF!!"" Get At Me Dog like DMX
Keith Murray pack a black tech
And I don't give a fuck, I can't be touched
Females jump in my flow like double-dutch

My technique, knock niggas off they feet (why)
I'm Ultimate, like the fuckin break beat
It's My Thing, back wit the sequel
Hold my Squad down wit the chrome desert eagle

Yo, I go back like straps, puttin Lee patch where your knee at
Puff wit mi-das, and no Civics wit the ski racks
Shut niggas down that be tryin to win
I'll be like "" Wha What What!"" like I'm from CNN

So peep the Thriller of Manilla, wreck shit like Godzilla
Drink Old English, can not stand Miller
MC's cold rockin till the party's through
Then they tap me on the shoulder and say ""This Bud's for you""

...
""Now that I got your attention again I want to""
 Party.. party.. party.. party
* echoes left to right *

Get up, shake your butts, feel the rhythm of the cuts
Walk around and strut, then a brother push up
And start talkin, girls and boys are hawkin
EPMD is live from New York and
Now I'm bout to rip house, straight up and jump
Move your body, as the bass pumps and thumps
This jam, is a crowd mover
For the girl and the boy with the funky dope maneuver
Or for a so-called dancing machine
Cause this record, is strictly for the club scene
Get Off the Wall, this ain't Michael Jackson
It's eighty-nine, it's time for some action
Like dips and dope backflips
While the girlies are movin, and groovin they hips
Enough booty, you could be waxin
Instead you in the corner, maxin and relaxin
Get up, and move your body
Cause party people

It's time to party (4X)
 Yo P break it down
 Yeah
""Uno, dos, tres, cuatro""
...

It's time to party (2X)
 Yo P break it down

Yeah..
It's Friday night, no work til Monday
To top it off you just got paid
So you step to the club, boys and girls are GQ
Before you go in, you drink a brew or two
Strobelight spinnin, people grinnin
You're coolin at the bar, drinkin vodka and gin and
Your body gets warm, your adrenaline is flowin
People on the dancefloor sweatin and yellin ho and
You see this fly cutie...
With crazy hips, plus a nice fine booty
Your mind gets to scheamin, you start dreamin
The liquor starts talkin, you get more self esteem and
You step to this lady, ""May I have this dance?""
Then she takes you in your arms and she grabs your hands
And while the disc jockey's yelling GET UP, GET UP
GET UP, GET UP, and on the dancefloor
The ladies are freakin moves, you never seen before
Cut up shirts, miniskirts, the whole works
Squeakin moves that make you squint and say
""Damn that must hurt"" -- stomachs are showin, aces blowin
And while you're havin fun, spendin your dough and
You reach into your pockets, you reach deeper
And off goes your money beeper
Which means you're runnin low on the dough
So you cool with the drinks and you limit your hoes
You grab a seat in the corner, and play low key
Askin yourself over and over how you spent a G
Don't worry now, worry on Monday
And get back on the dancefloor..

It’s Going Down,Business Never Personal,1992.0,"* - originally appeared on the Juice soundtrack
Owww!
Get on down (repeat 3X)
Verse One: Erick Sermon
Well, it's the E wit the juice, I'm down to get loose
Strapped in black wit the nine by the boots
Hardcore funk that make ya wanna pump a chump
My posse's thick, so I will never get jumped
The slayer, a beast from the east, I'm psycho
If I had a glove, I would be Bad as Michael
Some say, yo, I sound rugged
Pack wit the ultimate rap wit the Power like Snap
A.K.A. the Mic Wrecker
A rap star wit the boomin style, black as tar
Smokin, the E's no jokin, so don't trip or flip
And make a hit, so bust it
Some ain't feel the way I do when I get wreck
No half steppin, I kick back like a weapon
On the microphone, I delight
And groovy, a California quake couldn't move me
Get on down (repeat 4X)
It's going down (2X)
Verse Two: PMD
No lights, no camera, but lots of action
No moonwalkin backwards, kid, like Michael Jackson
Strictly funk flows and steel toed Timb boots to troop
State to state, stage to stage, as I clock loot
Black Asiatic, rapper fanatic, automatic
Black nine mil is what I pack so kill the static
EPMD quench the sound of thumps underground
Ya stupid boy, no props here, you catch a beatdown
The Squad still in effect, no record skippin
Ya stupid boy, keep the track, still bullshittin
Down wit the rap pack, still grabbin my bozack
Here's a ticket kid to ride the Jim like Amtrak
Got mad skills, hi-tech, been known to snap necks
From eighty-seven to ninety-two, fourth cassette
But now I'm Swayze, ghost, the rap host
Who rip shows, from coast to coast
Get on down (repeat 4X)
It's going down (2X)
Verse Three: Erick Sermon, PMD
Yea, back to the picture, the scene
It's me Erick Sermon, my M-16
Just in case, ya know, a fight broke out
I can just chill, pull out the smoke out
One, no grill, no charcoal, no fluid
Act like Bo Jackson, Nike, and Just Do It
If there's a problem, the Hit Squad rolls mad deep
So I can rest my head and get some sleep
While the E-Double, takes a nap, no time to slack
It's my turn to guard the fort, ready for combat
Guns and violence, that we don't promote
Just takin what's ours kid, chill or smell the gunsmoke
As I pull out, squeezin like Mr. Charmin
Destroyin posses of demo tapes like Agent Orange
So chill kid and act like you know

Total Kaos,Unfinished Business,1989.0,"Yo, whassup moneygrip, it's the E on the trip
Not to Georgia, but Gladys Knight and the Pips
It's a one way ticket, to the highest plateau
For a smooth rapper, and for those that flow
So blow like the wind my friend and take flight
And ""Fly, Like An Eagle"" -- yeah right
You can't rock a party and make hands clap-a
'Cause you an N.R.er (that means a Non-Rapper)
So give it up, sucka duck emcee; you're not ready
To flex yet, or better yet rock steady
With the E Double, number one on the planet
Take it for granted, I'm ""In Control"" like Janet
I'm in command, plus full of fun
But don't play me, cause if you do you gettin' done
And that, my son, comes to one conclusion
Total chaos...no mass confusion

Knock knock (aiyyo, who is it?)
The one who storms on rappers just like a snow blizzard
Yes the microphone doctor's back makin housecalls
To crab emcees, who claim to have the balls
To flex with the man, with the rep for snappin' necks
I'm not the one son, so don't pose or make threats
The PMD, yeah Paid and Makin' Dollars
Stranglin emcees with the microphone cord and make em holler
I'm like, Quick Draw McGraw when I blast past
An emcee's ass, then trash crash to smash his ass
And play his ego, while I sip a forty-oh
And count my cashflow, because I'm on the go
And aiyyo I don't joke, and that you can bet
I flex a rhyme on a rapper, play his posse and step
Like I said in ""Strictly Biz"" I'm known to cause an illusion
To create total chaos.. no mass confusion

No magic tricks, Houdini, or I Dream of Jeannie
Or dissapearing acts from here to Tahiti
It's a one two three count, and I'm knockin out
Without a doubt (Why E?)  I got clout!
Homeboy you should know, I'm de commando of rap
Carry emcees no trees, across my bare back
I use measures, and yes all are drastic
For me the E Double, cause I'm fantastic
So, I let you know, money I don't play
Step back and you won't get smacked, hear what I say?
Lay low Afro, or take a nightcap
And if you tired (yo, then go take a nap)
Or close your eyes and chank em like a Jap
Then lounge, as I rock across the map
Yo watch me go, flame dust in seconds
Me and PMD and the sound from our records
Check out the beat and the style I'm usin
It's total chaos.. no mass confusion

Last rhyme was for E, this one's for the Gipper
Give me room...'cause I'm about to rip a
Emcee's head off as I release my steam
The method of decapitation, is the guillotine
So check out the tempo, and let your body go
'Cause a brother like MD's about to go Rambo
A Microphone Doctor, an emcee physician
An all around scholar, a rapper technician
So put up or shut up, cause MD is like fed up
You, your wack crew, your whole damn set up
Suckas still slippin, you better get a grip and
Change your wack style while the clock still tickin
'Cause pursuin' and doin' a brotha, is second nature
Can you feel it, E Double?  (Yeah, somethin like ?)
To the Microphone Doctor, all rappers are obsolete
You lack style and composure, plus your rhymes are weak
I gave you all due respect, when I said ""mic check""
You're still slippin Duke, it's time to snap that neck
Like I said in ""Strictly Biz"" I'm known to cause an illusion
To create total chaos...no mass confusion",https://genius.com/Epmd-total-kaos-lyrics

Fuckin coolo make you quit rap and go sing with Menudo
Underground's where we live and that's where we'll be when you leave
Overachieve, I'd rather be rockin Apollo Creed
Time to speak up, faggot niggas droppin these weak cuts
We're the b-boys, hows about some hardcore in the speakers
For the Mic Dons, ??
??, PMD shinin with my stripes on
In the saddle, fuck around, get your shit rattled
No paddles up shit's creek when time to battle
Same place, same bat time, so fuck a bat channel
This nigga, object of game, get your pockets bigger
Biggie, Pac, and Eaze - one love, them still my fuckin niggas

We don't need no gat, just cock me fuckin back
And watch me spitfire my ?volerical? fact
It's a sign of a miracle that, my iron spittin
Ain't peelin your cap, me and the devil had a spiritual chat
Cause I'm eviler with lyrical rap
Than a black cat, on a black night, and I'm black
In the moonshinin, I'm sippin Starsky and Hutch
While my rims blindin, while P rollin the Dutch
Cause I'm too much for ma's and grandpa's to solve
Roll the windows to your cars, when out at large
Who the fuck's in charge?  Charles Laston Sauls
I got his mom suckin my balls like a fresh pack of Halls
Right hand to Allah, I'm the roughest of the raw
Nobody's ever seen what they seen and never saw
When I jump in my car, they go ooh and ahh
EPMD, 215, and 8-Off Agallah

Yo 215, who the FUCK was them cats up in the car?
One of them got a gat, the other one wanna spar
Jumpin out the car, pop a trunk, swingin crowbars
Stick up my seeds in my fiends for the G's
People low self-esteem rockin the gleam, hotter than steam
When I blow off the top I got this cream like Bill Rothstein
And when I rob unique excitement is, why you scream
So put your hands together, get your mans together
Here's the plan together here's the gun together let's run together
Soldier mind crime nigga, bitch-down live nigga
8-Off's gonna hit em like, five niggas, suprise niggas

Aiyyo you hit em like that
I bust em from the back, to the extreme
Hit em up, make em scream like a bitch
And switch up, for the mix up, and dig a ditch up
And bounce, then for luck, I throw a six up
And hook off like Prince Naseem a head
Duck yo' head, or go inside instead
Step to me bourgeoise?  Fancy as Dandy?
You get killed, like you was Jon-Benet Ramsey
And some of y'all just plain civilians
Talkin shit, and never even seen a million
Actin like y'all Sicilians, when y'all niggas
With small figures, and chasin gold diggers
(Motherfuckers) Don't even come up to me yappin
Or you'll Die Hard with Bruce and Sam Jackson
Right now, you wanna duel, you fool
I'm a Dogg 4 Life like my nigga Ja Rule
Who wanna flex, with the influential
With mad credentials on instrumentals we're too essential

Give the people what they want
Ladies and Gentlemen
(repeat 2X)

When I came out with my first rap jam
I had no idea that the record would slam
It did real good without radio play
Maybe at night but no airplay in the day
I couldn't understand why to be exact
Our music was good and I was far from wack
Then came the answer, commercial was the key
To get airplay and a spot on TV
Like Ed Lover and Doctor Dre from Yo! MTV Raps
A show, mainly for the black
And still we can't ill, cause to them that's wrong
Cause like P.E. said, we're too black and too strong
But hey, what can I say
(Brothers and sisters) that's a price a rapper must pay
Chorus

As airwaves collapse rap shows at a standstill
Some racial circuits the frequencies can't handle
The funk tracks produced by EPMD
But it's a fat jam, that will never win a grammy
Unless we sellout and kill the black movement dead
Which means swallow our pride and become flunkies instead
And stop the rap about freedom, thoughts of a black president
And rap about a black crack, the mayor in our residence
Give me a break brothers, it's time to take a stand
And kill that no sir, yes sir, and thank you ma'am
Cuz the word is a luxury a black man can't afford
That's why poverty's on the rise and we still ignored
And it's a setback and yet the clock still ticks
And if we let it, rap would be run by politics
I read it somewhere that every man's created equal
But not in this day and age, maybe in the sequel
Which means next time, so observe these rhymes
And take a stand and go for yours cause I'm going for mine
That's why I
Chorus

Why is that when wrong is done by the black
It's blown out of proportion and immediately attacked
By the press and yes, conflict is caused
By the kids at concerts who bumrush the doors
One child gets hurt, the press gets pesty
But what about the Beatles, G, and Elvis Presley
Same stuff was rough, rap does not cause violence
So (Fight the Power) and make them understand
But too much power and you might get banned
So if you want airplay
You can't be too black and hey, watch what you say, but ayo",https://genius.com/Epmd-give-the-people-lyrics
Underground,Business As Usual,1990.0,"Comin straight from the underground {*echoes*}

As I pump up a brand new funk swing
And bring back the chill or thrill from B.B. King
Old-fashioned, is the way that I be waxin
A MC - I bust a grill, and the reaction
I check, inspect, make sure the head's wrecked
{*CRUNCH*} Snap a neck for some live effects
A machine, malfunctioning, that's mean
I ""Stay Together"" my man like Al Green
I'm a slayer, the E-R-I-C-K and I'm back
To attack a punk chump, that ain't sayin jack
Boom, I'm buckwild when I'm stoned
I close, only one eye like a cyclone
So I throw on my black shades that's rhinestone
Jump into my Benz that's outlined in chrome
I'm the grand, royal MC I'm no joke
I hit like a Phillie, Blunt when it's toked
I smoke, an MC well done, he gets done
I'm knockin out whack MC's like Michael Nunn
Full power, one punch crunch, I'm throwin bolos
I'm strapped heavy, my handguns that's solo
I'm packed when it's time to get down
Cause Erick Sermon's comin straight from the underground


Okie dokie; my mind gets slow-pokey when I toke the pull
From a Phillie Blunt and I hope the
Olde Gold is cold when I pop the cap
Take a sip and then blitz, then crack a back with a rhyme sack
Cause I'm too smooth, paid my dues and can't lose
I'm ""Top Gun,"" pullin bitches like Tom Cruise
And my main man, D-Wade, still gets paid
And in the off-season, we vacate in the shade
So all hail the Mary, crack the Moet
Blast the boombox, then act like George and Jet-son
Cause my style, similar to Tae Kwon Do
But aiyyo, I don't kick or throw stars this brother flows
To the funk track, with 808 drops for props
No type of druggin or thuggin, DT's or cops
I say, no to blow, yes to sess, and I suggest
You put a buck on lotto, and if you win you should invest
On the new grill +Bill+ cause I rock +Nunn+ until
The fat lady sings, or Brooklyn starts to ill
But there's a fat chance, with the brother bistro
Cause I'm the master of the quadraverb and the echo
There's no time to stop, so P keep on steppin
On the edge of the frame of the mind, the nine is the weapon
That I choose to squeeze when a brother bucks wild
One slug to the head, mafioso style
You catch a universal beat down with sounds that pound
Watch yourself son, I'm comin straight from the underground

I'm comin straight from the underground {*2X*}
Straight from the underground

Can’t Hear Nothing But the Music,Business Never Personal,1992.0,"(PMD)
It's a fact, I'm mad hard like a jail yard
I'm sick, slow, call me a retard
Can't hear nothing but the music, I'm slippin
Dark as hell, hear water drippin
Parrish Smith, mentally sick
Serial rap killer like Dave Berkowitz
Yes, the son of Sam and I'll be godamn
So take the force and get the balls and watch me slam, man
The exquisite rap wizard from the boon dox
My tune knock watts, been known to cause brain lock
Wit no riff raff, smooth like Shaft
Breaking bones in the rap zone, chill or get smoked mad fast
Can't stop us from buggin because we're trippin
Can't hear nothing but the music, I'm slippin
(Chorus)
Can't hear nothing but the music, I'm slippin(4x)
(Erick Sermon)
Breaker 1, 9, breaker, 1, 9, mayday
Call for backup, it's Erick Sermon's payday
No illusion, just mass confusion
Dull raps, I dutch them, from the funk production
I, the Afro American, black citizen
To make you scream loud as hell like Sam Kinison
No one can stop me
Dun na na na na na, like Rocky
The combination, the jab, the uppercut
Mad footwork from the rappin' expert
Bust a move, I'm worth about a million cash bucks
Say what, damn right, shut the hell up
I fought MC's word up and watch em grown up
Play em like Dunkin, then pass out doughnuts
Then I freak the funky style and I use it
MD and hear nothing but the music
Chorus
(PMD)
What's this, another funky hit from the Squad, kid
I get mad props like Sonny Crockett
You know it's the smooth rap flow that clocks the P doe
Can't stop now (why) cuz I'm diesel
EPMD back in effect on your rap set
Fourth cassette, more deadly than a bomb threat
Can't stop us from buggin because we're trippin
Can't hear nothing but the music, I'm slippin
(Erick Sermon)
Slate take two, action, the main attraction
(Who's Bad) I'm bad like Michael Jackson
Got more tricks than any Kung Fu flick
Understand, I'm ruff and tuff like Jackie Chan
My technique, the drunken mic, grasp it right
I'm teaching (P-S-Y-C-H-E) psyche
I'm slammin, the dopest nigga from the underground
Out the basement, now world renown
Rocking systems, cuss and jock a victim
If we catch flack from a punk and then we diss him
Then I freak a funky style and I use it
Kid, and hear nothing but the music

P - Cop grabbed me by my neck pushed me towards the damn door
See my homies, locked down on the same floor

P - Didn't respond, just chilled to play his ego
Stepped in the men's room, still filthy from the ill broom
E - Hurry up and take a piss and stop stallin you damn goon

Not glacial time, but the black nine
Gotta clear my name, been framed for the death of Jane
Must make my move now or it's ball and chain

Manslaughter,Business As Usual,1990.0," Manslaughter (repeat 4X)
Verse One: Erick Sermon
Code name E-D, check on the one two three
Black male hard MC
Rap record slave, a brother on the scene
With a machine gun and one magazine
Wanted, a half a million for the body alone
Two million for the microphone
If you see him, dial 5 dash slayer
A hotline to the governor and mayor
He's armed wit ammo, a weapon that's mine
All black in rap, strap tech nine
Silencer clipped, check the rip on the sneak tip
The boy's about ta flip

Verse Two: PMD
Code name MD, rappin fanatic
No short taken, black Asiatic
Hit man, keeps my belt unbuckled
Book a look on my grill with no signs of a chuckle
Or laughter, cause my name ain't Casper
The Friendly Ghost, but I smoke an MC if I have to
Quick fast like Alakazoo, Alakazam
And I'll be damned, cuz my rhymes slam like Bam-Bam
Rubble, partner code name is E-Double
It's those hazel green eyes that keep my man in trouble
Girls ride the tip, brothers on his sac
I had to change my name to Bruce Wayne, also known as Bat-
Man, and grab the bozack wit this hand
As I slay ya manslaughter

Verse Three: Erick Sermon
Mad man fully strapped and I quote
Don't flex, last chump who did, he got smoked
Undercover, not D-T but E-D
And wonder why you're spinning my records on thirty-three
I'm the original, never did crime, I'm no criminal
No static, pack a forty-five automatic
Black cat strapped in rap, holding my Johnson
Walking the streets, a vigilante Charles Bronson
As the beat kick, face his plate on the M1 done
Style's sharper than the blade in Shogun
First suckers disrupt the brain of a sucker MC
That can't count one two three
I manage to damage, I roast the whole membrane
Insane, like a basehead doing cocaine
I kill a farmer, plus his daughter
Cause I'm the E-Double, and this is manslaughter
They call us manslaughter
They call it manslaughter

Verse Four: PMD
As I stare deep into the mirror, I could only resort
To a hardcore gangsta, penile train of thought
You're stomped out, you're beat down, you go big top shit
Run your trunk jewels or get, pistol whipped
Cause I'm too swift to slip or miss a stitch on my rap hit
Sleep on a sucker and you still can't get with
Me bro, wit this flow and I don't know Judo
Gunflow is my style, say this so that you know
There's no time to dance or romance with a nuisance
Play ya like a puppet to put some lead in ya pants
Then off you go to the rap rat pack
Be stripped of your mic, punk on your head we stamped bozack
That's what the doctor ordered
Take two of these, dead, manslaughter
They call it manslaughter

Nobody's safe chump, so keep your doors locked(4x)

Droids of funk, produce a song to make my fans sing
Singing, swinging, hum along, thump my rap song
I bet I get wreck on a

Poof, no phonebooth, cape, or tight suit
Dress in all black, black skullcap, black down goose
To hide the mossberg, word, wit the pistol grip
Squeeze em quick, so use caution wit the loose lip
Cuz loose lips sink ships, don't be the ship to catch a nine clip

Yes, a fact, a black nine mil is what I pack
In the front of my waist, right next to my bozack
A safety, for the suckers that hate me
I haven't had to bust a couple of rounds lately
I hope not, it's no fun getting shot
Cause when I cock, I aim straight for the knot
I don't miss, I have a scope, no jokin
You should hope, that disco appearance like broke
Mass destruction when I start crushin and bustin
Duck MC's, I'm bumrushin
Swift wit the trig, there's nuff foes equipped
Real deal, of course, I pack steel, shit's thick
I'm not dumb, to walk the streets, they kept us swinging by

By the hour, I push power like Hiroshima
Got dropped on by USA and like cleaned her
I manage to damage people without a sequel

To whine while I dine, sounds genuine
You walked in wrong camp, punk, stepped on a landmine
Boom bang, bust the slang that I bring
From Brentwood, Long Island, all the way to Sing-Sing
Yes the penile, peace to brothers on trial
For some *bullshit* charge, mugshot on file
For hard time, thump beats like an Alpine
No Sam Suey sole shoe shoot joints, back a tech nine
Yes the brother's back wit no knife or ax
Just a microphone, sucker, it limits that pack
Def blows and flows, quadraverbs and echoes
Sounds the pound hard to make an MC petrol
My nine mil, kitted wit the infrared beam
Something similar to a Roger Moore scene
That's James Bond, 007, wit guillotine
To keep the Hit Squad hype to fly heads like the A-Team

I tote 3 50's, 7's with the wooden handle
In case of a scandle, or a so called vandal
And if I let off and he gets hit
And if you miss him, go home and light a candle

Yo with cyphers our tradition, then I'm a spill when I'm spittin'
This vocal ammunition (X2)

Yo I spit ferocious, here's another dosage
I'll capture your mind like hypnosis, so you should focus
On what hip hop mean to you, whether physical or in your spiritual
Form, liver than your black college dorm
Indecisive niggas swarm lets git it on
You know my motto, drinkin' cold on some Colorado
Tall bottles until my legs wobble, blow your spot
Drink lots like Freddie Foxxx, shits fully locked
It's hotter than lava rocks
A grand entrance like when LL said ""Box""
In Krush Groove, I freak the ill power move
Kid I'm on fire, flippin' on MC's like David Banner
Changing his black tire, admire, rewarding the cordless
Cats is played out like Diadoras, nothing for this
Hold you scoreless, Jersey reppin', flowin' with the legends
Using mics for weapons, studying all my lessons
So prepare for this paper run, I hit your cypher
Had your crew sayin' ""We should of taped son""
Maverick, Top Gun, shootin' missiles
I prefer 40's over Cristal, hit the path out the turn style
Nocturnal's tactics is to wild out like a T-Rex, at Jurassic Park
Making music with my mouth like Biz Mark
Rougher than Timb's and Carhartt, check my street smarts
Plus credentials, microphones as utensils
Like spoons and forks, celebrating popping corks
Off the Moey if you felt me now you know me
EPMD and Nocturnal in your fucking code be


Yeah yeah Nocturnal son. Nocturnal, EPMD, you know what's up, you know
What's up. You know what I'm saying. This is how we do. Reppin' for the
Crew. Jersey fuckin' too. Hell yeah, hell yeah",https://genius.com/Epmd-dungeon-master-lyrics
Draw,Out of Business,1999,"* old Western for first 40 seconds *

Anybody around here seen Two-Gun Billy?
I said, did anybody around here seen Two-Gun Billy?
(Ain't no Two-Gun Billy 'round here
Who the hell you think you are, comin up in here ya damn yankee?)
*a gun is heard*
(You just pull a gun out on me?)
Now you know you done fucked up right? * five gunshots *
Now, if any one of y'all see him
Tell him that, EPMD was in town..

Draw, cock it back, squeezin metaphors
Spurs on my Timb's, when I start blazin, hit the floor
Cowards duckin, I'm emptyin chambers when I'm bustin
Quick with mine, smokin up heaters, when I'm crushin
Nice with the weapontry, you ain't shootin me
You shot the deputy (ahhhhh) what you hearin when you step with the
Black dragon, puffin L's in the truck wagon
Drinkin moonshine, writin rhymes with the pants saggin
And hit the saloon, causin the guns in my holster to make room
Like Josie Wale and Clint Eastwood at High Noon
So amigo, take ten paces, move your feet slow
Turn around and wave goodbye, to your people
Time to draw, I'm aimin for your dome and jaw
Fastest nigga in the wild West or East you ever saw
An outlaw, my horse drinkin water from the resevoir
Time to ride again until next time to draw

Hah
Those dudes quick fast to grab the mic
Flee the scene, or see the infrared beam
On the mic I dismantle, leave an impression
And ruin you, like I'm the Bill Clinton scandal
Impeach em, then I Erick can B. President
Pass a law, hardcore in the residence
Act fool, turn shit out, no doubt
The hard route, and watch all the b-boys sprout
Air the room out, take a picture, get the zoom out
And focus, or go into hypnosis
I wasn't here when I wrote this (where was you?)
Up the top with the street team hangin out, hangin Squadron posters
Me and my dogs homey reppin
In case some punks roll up, yo P, flash the weapon
Forty-four caliber chrome, read it
Can't count ten paces, I'm already heated it
P and Erick Sermon is like a Ruger German
Put one up in your sternum, gun em down and burn em
Any superhero we lettin em know from door
Come correct when it's time to draw",https://genius.com/Epmd-draw-lyrics

Check this out
I was hangin out late, creepin a quarter to two
Polly with cats, sippin on a 40 of brew
Pulled out the Dutch Master cause it's time to get on
Turned on the truck system to pump a hip-hop song
Five minutes later I see these other kids clockin
Meanwhile my niggas chalmed out with system rockin
Sayin in my mind -- who could it be?
As he got closer, I peeped, it was the E-Double E
I said, ""Whattup Duke?""
	Yo, whassup Sundullah?
I have a girl and she wants me to duke her
	Yo, why didn't you?
	Yo, I woulda hit the skins
	That's when I chilled, and peeped the two heads in the Benz
Gave my crew dap, and hopped the right the fuck on in
E-Double set it
	Yo P, this is Sandy and Lynn, Duke

I said yo, what's the deally yo?  She said, ""Sex, you wanna feely yo?""

Shorter than short and petite, blazin ass body and physique
Five-doggin it, pumpin Jay-Z and Memphis Bleek

Burnin somethin, purple chronic, orange or thai
On the expressway, 4-9-5 L.I

Straight rollin, nice from the Henny before
Shorty wanted to pull over and get a Dutch from the store

We parked the Benz, the girls got out and walked right in
Copped a 40 and a Dutch, and hopped right back in

Tried to pull off, that's when a squad car cut us off
Five-oh pulled out and said, ""Chill, cause it's the law""

Aiyyo they caught us on a techno (techno)
Girls started shakin, gettin petrol
Pulled the burner 540, one shot, sunscreen's essential

Straight dumpin, no love for the badge and the gun
Straight accomplices, now our ass is on the run

Now shit's drastic, dodgin and dippin traffic
Bitches started regulatin on some flash and blast shit
She's out the Benz with the quickness, that's when the shit got real
Bitches flipped, hit PMD with the steel

And asked him how it feel, jumped right back in grabbed the wheel
Told the cats to relax and yo, peep the deal

Remember Tommy Twotime, who used to move moonshine?
Now he's a bitch nigga, frontin for cats, droppin dimes

Yo time to see him, he be hangin at the coliseum
Down on 48th and Lex, near the black museum

He owe me somethin, when I see him, I'm straight dumpin
Catch him four times in the legs, get close and ask him somethin

YO WHATTUP GOD?  'Member J, from the schoolyard?
Try to floss when I was chillin, HOLD THIS BABY PAH!

I looked at E like, ""Yo, this bitch is talkin like a dude""
Seen the cat across the street, she said, ""It's time to move""

Ran up on him, he looked like he saw a ghost
Tried to run, but J pulled out and flashed the toast

Toast told him to bend over, and then the girl lift her dress
Pulled out a dick, laced him in the ass, and asked him
How he liked it -- kid was cryin in pain
'Member you raped me in the park?  Peep _The Crying Game_

Eh te eh te eh, hold me down
Word to, everybody that, hold me down
Huh?  Ah-huh, yo, what?
Aiyyo P back me up now, hold me down
While I go around this town, snatchin crowns
From those supposed, wannabe rap vocalists
If you nice get your rope and dosey-do in this
Let me know somethin - you wanna fight?  Let's go somethin
If not, close your mouth and say nothing
Y'all imitations, fuckin up the whole situation
With sucker MC infiltration

Aiyyo straight up, you light MC's better get your weight up
I'm benchin three hundred and change, starvin cats get ate up
Ain't that ill?  How I can just stare, and watch the blood spill
From an unknown rapper, but now the rapper's no thrill
Now how real is that?  Burnin gats, knifes and bats
Hot rhyme, status, with the hot wax
Mixed with the street slang, is where it's at
Perhaps, you should close your mouth kid and slide back

And millions to back it, keep it rugged never wack kid
This ain't just rhymin, God's on the way, and he's askin
Who's been followin the rules, two noided, so we strap tools
And can't cool, this go out to the cats in school
It's not the norm, word bond, so get ready for the rainstorm
Too hot, fuck lukewarm, when we swarm

Yeah we swarm MC's with the bee effect, zzzzz, sting em
Like Muhammad, set the scene I'm bombin on
CEO's, A&R's, street team to a manager
For the cream, we damage ya
On light-skinned, dark-skinned, albino
From a crackhead, dopefiend, or wino
Bring the Ultra-ment, stick you with the Magnetic
Give a shout, to them sweet cats, rap diabetics

Dodgin po-nine and marks, with the high beams

Catchin bodies, E Double holdin shit down with the sawed off shotty
What you thought?  We takin more than nickels and shorts?
Get the fuck out of here, nothin sweet here, you get your shit torched

I spit flames at Oklahoma
When done, you can smell the Sermon aroma
In a coma, burned to death, man listen
Did he deserve, the kicked to the curb, ass whippin?
Believe you me, it was his destiny
For the child to end for fuckin with men
P and I got somethin for all y'all
Who stand tall, and dose dat like to ball
So we ball like Spalding, in the time of need
Who you calling when your career is falling?
Ssshh, way down, you've been hit, lay down
Hit the ground, don't get up, stay down

Jane 5,Back In Business,1997.0,"Haircut, like Anita Baker
""Murder?/Yeah murder one son, for the death of Jane"" (repeat 4X)
Aiyyo they came to my jail cell, and let me go on technicalities
The girl that got merked it wasn't Jane it was fuckin Valerie
The prostitute from downtown, we checked the dental records
Found her butt naked, and on the side EPMD record
Two hours later on Greyhound, on my way now
Peeped the shorty up front, starin wants to play now
Set gets laid out, she black, draws the gat
Screamin 'lay flat' then bust a cap as she walk back
Remain cool, I want the money quality jewels
And anybody breakin these rules they get two's
This is a jack, pass the money back, no eye contact
Relax, and keep quiet and pass the bag back
To my accomplice, havin no nonsense
That's when another girl pushed up, white girl on some calm shit
Thinkin quick that's when the hammer went click
An off-duty P.O., licked off and touched first bitch, she fell
Hit the floor, she was leakin
My partner cock back, blast, one woman started screamin
Who's next?  Who wanna flex?  Cop in the seat wet
Licked another shot off, hit the driver then the bus tipped
Shit's thick, that's when she grabbed me took me hostage
Told me 'snatch the bags and don't fuck with my props kid'
Pistol still smokin, she kicked the fuckin door open
Bus on it's side wheels spinnin, with the engine smokin
Runnin on the shoulders, she put the gat in the holster
Played it cool, and never lost my composure
As screamin soldier got closer, I followed her to the
Drop point, she took the leads off a Range Rover
And passed me the keys, proceeded to roll trees
Shorty gained her silence, guess what was in the CD
And as I did the knowledge the Jeep raised from the hydraulic
I'm thinkin, ""Could this be Jane as my co-pilot?""
Time to activate, JANE on the license plate
Pushin ninety-five with no headlights, on the interstate

Put On,Back In Business,1997.0,"Put them on, put on
Shiesty motherfuckers
Recognize that, check it

Yo we build and destroy, black Benz's and the convoy
Use a different nines of alloy, metal, money caught it in his velcro
Another shell split his elbow, a good fellow
Like Jimmy Two-Times, he tote two nines, two dimes
Caught the guard block and at the shoe shine
Yeah he just got word about his man James Dean from Queens
Hit a bank and shot a guard in the spleen
With Bill Blast, he made a dash smash the cash
Ran two blocks pulled off the ski mask
But then started flippin', forced in the phat whip and
People started talkin', po-po started sniffin', plus
He never hit James Dean with the cream
So James put a hit to catch him on the scene
The police got a tip from a girl he use to run with
Sell guns with, trees and mack clips, yeah
She was nice, drove a 5-0 twice, on the cell all night
With more hoes than Heidi Fleiss
And the girl drove a black Infinity, moving keys to Kennedy
Different name everyday fake identity
They made a deal and copped a plea and turned state
So at the house the police wait but James caught him in his 8
50 that's how the streets be moving shifty
Found Billy and he slipped and paid quickly
Different day but the same song, life goes on
So watch the street kid, cause it's a put on

That's how it goes down, down on the under (x2)

I seen Will on the corner, Flatbush and Park Slope
Shippin' two pounds of coke with 2 O.G.'s in his bear coat
Chrome neena, rollin' with this bitch named Catrena
Undercover queena that pack a street sweeper
5 years for doin' Fed time for extortion
And a jail up in Boston for major jewel flossin'
Hits safes quickly can hear a black Jamie Summers
Pick the right numbers and have mad runners
Or Hardcore Lil' Kim, Queen Bee Bitch
Who never snitch, played the game and never rode the bench
Will swear up and down this bitch will kill at will
For her family, no fantasy, a James Colamity
Time for the score, from Hammerton to Marine Park
Gotta get there, before it get dark, we arrive
She reload the black 45, concealed by the waist line
And now's the time, she jumped out the car
In front was a Hummer, two new comers, I never seen before
I approached tall Joey ""Who's those guys lookin' wise?
Had my black ass surprised.""
A-yo yo yo it's a set up, where's the dough, uh
Where's the loot, give it to me and don't get cute
Catrina pulled the weapon, shot Joey
The other two guys pulled out and aimed, explain
Yo, she hid the two kids with Joey, she didn't know
Cause she paid more dough for 'em
Will screamed ""You bitch!"" ""Sorry"" she said
Then boow! Will got lit
That's how it goes down, down on the under

I'm lethal, take it back to EPMD third album
And do it _For My People_

I jump out the plane and hanglide
Hit the ice and slip-slide
Niggas don't get it, EPMD status, correct me if I'm
Mistaken, currently record breakin and still bakin

Aiyo the rhymes I recite, airtight like a submarine
Hip-Hop fiends like a Jones for nicotine
Of tobacco so I can't slack yo
Got the knack though, bring it live and that's a fact yo
Niggas bugging out, asking when we coming out
Samples running out, need new shit to talk about
How you doing? (Where you been?) In the biz
Sitting on chrome, back to set trends
Well it's the rapping Lex Luthor, step to me I'll do ya
Send you Back to the Future–He for real man? Hell yeah!
I don't care, I gets it on anywhere
In the streets of East New York to the streets of Bel Air
First things first, I come to work with mad equipment
To do y'all in the U-Haul and the side biscuit
My persona
Got suburban kids banging their heads up in the gym like Nirvana

Let's get up, let's get down
Roll with the hardcore funk, the hardcore sound
Let's get wit this, mackadocious funk material
{""It's been a long time, we shouldn't have left you""}

Back to take mine like Jordan going baseline
Create rhymes, break spines when it's showtime
Niggas wanna doubt me, talk about P
No slouch B 'cause off the meter's how my clout be
Indeed, I'm amazing when I unfold
Got the crowd doing shit by remote control
Coming high powered, what's the discrepancy coward?
Dunk on your head like Juwan Howard

Let's get up, let's get down
Roll with the hardcore funk, the hardcore sound

I wanna rock wit you like Michael Jackson

You're not Seal, so why you actin Crazy
I wanna be your man, the whole nine sounds cute
Us buggin out, and us knockin boots
But you, you wanna go out and start cheatin
Hangin Tough like the New Kids every damn weekend
Thinkin I'm stupid, girl, you must be buggin
The boy you messin wit is my cousin
Tryin to play the E-Double wit the old weak flim flam
Don't play me and reach out for the next man

Don't play me, play the next man (4X)

I was wonderin why you went to work everyday
OK, yea, maybe to get extra pay
But when you stepped out, you was dressed to impress
(How fresh) so fresh, that you walked wit finesse
Word is bond, I could've sworn you was minglin
The way you was movin, the way your earrings was jinglin
Of course, you was messin wit the Boss
Not Bruce Springsteen, your boss drove a Porsche
Remember, you went to work one night
While me and D-Wade was home watchin the Mike Tyson fight
You said goodbye, gave me a couple of kisses
I peep the coat I didn't buy you for Christmas
You went out to a fancy restaurant
Came in actin all nonchalant
Asked you a question, shook up like Elvis Presley
Your makeup smudged, your hair messy
Shh, quiet, I caught cha
Tell him my name is Parrish Smith, I used to mess wit his daughter
Yes the Mic Doc and I'll be damned
Don't play me, play the next man

G boys, I bring it back to a dooky rope, dope
I sport like I if I spit the commandments
So inspired, now who the hell your man wit?
And he's gangsta right?
He belong in a dimwit type
You picked the wrong night
I'mma Las Vegas fight Don King in the ring
Does my thing from father spring, thats all year
I can feel in a wannbe rapper turned actor
He wanna act tough it hit him with the clapper
Def-con actor, see I ain't playing kid
He screamed and I'mma just saying he did
EPMD I'm scared for us
Cause someone might bite the dust
Before rush hour
The power I got is snappin necks
So I suggest ya show respect
We own that

Now put your hand in the air
Keep 'em there
Run your jewels, run it
Run your jewels, run it
Run your jewels, motherfucker
You heard what we said man, we ain't playin

Step through the door, hot body and lick off the ground

Faces is wrecked like wild
There goes EMP with the fisherman hat
Four back, get hit with the gun pow
Respect the gods, excuse me, I beg your pa
Can't hear you, you got to grade up, cause the beats too hard


I bring the heat quick
I do it, kill Ramone in Beat Street
I get the club rockin on some seasick shit
I ain't gotta tell you I'm hood man, you can see I'm it
My rhyme hits, I don't preach 'bout cash
Cause most of yall know cash like E-Zpass
You came in talkin bout you gon beat me
Then you left out talkin bout ""just give me two more CDs""
You're young so you need to be gangsters
While real G's wanna sit home and read the paper
Courtside view with the LA Lakers
But its always some youngin you got to send to his maker

I be pulsatin dominatin, up above
Run-D.M.C. style, stop and show love
E-Dub, I can't fall off, it's no way, I'm down low
I stay in the cut with O.J
The fact is, some things got to change
With eight or more rappers that sound the same
With the, same game, like they all in the same gang
And claim the same fame
Suicide victims, quick to jump off and scream I
Have to die, I'm livin a lie
Fake MC's no heart, get torn apart
Messin with us?  In ninety-nine, get smart
I be the last one you wanna play with
Rap committees call me, just to okay shit
Focus on me, I grab the mic and drop gems
On a ill rhyme, more flashier than rims
Step in in tan Timb's, a pocket full of ends with a
Couple of friends and a couple of hens
Never boring, keep shit rocking til morning
With the bird, until the hawks start hawking
Bounce with me, me and my man keep things hittin
Hop in the Benz 2000 Benz with the CD skippin
EPMD, who's fuckin with it
Outta control like 2Pac in _Juice_, character Bishop
Who's inferior?  My Squad be Def
And we ain't hearin ya, lounge in the black interior

HAH!  Yes.. ha, rap is outta control!
Ha, hey hey rap is outta control! (for sure dude)
Yo, aiy, rap is outta control! (for sure dude)
Aiyyo, ey, rap is outta control!

Yo, they took our music and our beat and tried to make it street
Then got in the magazine and tried to sound all sweet
When it came to EPMD no one said a word
So I called up Erick Sermon and said, ""This shit's absurd!""
Now we flip the bird, back-breakin MC's down like herbs
Redlinin, bendin my chrome rims up on curbs
So can you make a bill and chill and survive in the rap field?
Flip deals, and cock back burners when the caps peel?
I don't think so, then come next the car repo
No mo' contract, just strictly handyman in Home Depot
So don't front for me or the E, cause you know our steez
EPMD, blazin shit, Def 2G's
Cause we make tape and break MC's who wannabeez
And gonna-beez, burn em down to third degrees
You heard of me, ain't no one checkin or servin me
I'll turn your 411 into the 911 emergency

Hah.. hah, rap is outta control!
Hey, hey rap, rap .. wait, what wait (for sure dude)
Hey, rap is outta control!  Hold on
Wait wait, rap rap is outta control!

Ha hah, your rhymes stall when you bust caps
Make sure they krytonite caps
I'm made of steel, I swat bullets like gnats
I'm like, (*singing*) Superman... fly high...
.. way up in the sky ..
And if you try to shoot me down clown I won't die
I cremate

I hate, let's exterminate
Wait for a second E, time to debate
As we take our Fisherman hat off, there's no time to max
On the crab MC, who's all on the bozack
Who knows that, 2000 Benz to shows that

Ask any cat in the streets and he'll point right here (Uhu)
Shine everywhere I go without droppin shit for years
Niggas know this nigga, _Crossover_ to _Golddigger_
Come with the broken language like Smoothe da Hustler and Trigga (Uhu)
My bombs are bigger, can't touch a harmless figure
Cause is stay razor sharp like my name was RZA
PMD built a dynasty like Jigga

Yeah, P my nigga, time to cock back pull the trigger
He a bigger nigga with figures but I'm a bigger nigga
Duh, I'm a snub nose, I'm way above those
I got beef and I sit 'til the club closed
Lights come on, I'm bombin
Viet-Nam-em, Napalm-em, AK I calm them
Mom like ""Who harmed them?""
 I don't know, but they put em in the news and Saddam'd 'em
 And nobody warned 'em

Like Norman Bates pullin back the shower curtains (Uhu)
Or like in _Headbanger_ black birds chirpin
This is what it sounds like when you puttin work in
Mausberg heavy (Check, puttin work in)
Tec-9's steady (Check, puttin work in)
Shotgun heavy (Check, puttin work in)
Machine gun's ready (Check, puttin work in)

We from the era of the red white and green sweater
Cream getter, gleam better
You know what? the team is clever
Fuck niggas up get drunk pull out a bigger pump
Sell crack, all day rep, rock the meanest leather
Flip you all day chump, mad make you pay
No doubt, gun in his mouth, he leanin on Broadway
HipHop gangsters for real, check the archives
Four Fives, knives, catch you in the sunrise
Powerful impact, boom, from the canon
This is not slain to take mine, take this ammo with it
Big boys, pretty boys, shottin pretty toys
Pull out the new joints and lower the noise
The records that we make straight classics
Built for Benzes, Astons, high powered assassins
Put that major work in, holler, blash the collar

Sheik, the beats make em freak
A unique technique, with flavors like Black Sheep
You know my style's mad rugged, you love it
You never heard the funk before the E was discovered
I'm bad, renegade wrangler, mic strangler
Funk arranger, E.D's danger
We make the sounds that make you *owwwww!*
Make you wanna scream like James Brown so I can rock a town
I'm real swift, I bring light to a skip
I rock the party all night, the crowd chant my shit
I leave at sundown, walk away chillin'
Cool, and Keep Mental like Mike Bivins
Then I find the Hit Squad, and stop buckwhylin'
Chump, cause I'ma...

Peace to the posse, yeah OK you got me
Another rap chumpie about to O.D
Beat fanatic fiend from the hard scene
You know the kid in the Benz s-O with the fog beam
Skins cool I mingle girls are simple
'I'll be gentle, I'll be very gentle'
Don't bug on my rap skill boy, because it's mental
Squaad is mad truck, quick to snuff a duck
No bluff, your neck'll get snapped so kill the ruff stuff
Brentwood's my town home of beatdowns
Dress code is don't care so take a chill clown
Smallest place on the map we're bustin' big caps
Where girlies troop Tim boots and baseball caps
That's where I'm from chump, still buckwhylin'
Bust it Hobbes, cause I'ma

Now it's time for me the E to rock it loco
No need to guess homeboy, you know my vocals
Gimme a break to stay focused on my tape
I'm more than great, I got the key to my state
I'm rough like brillo, I bust like a pistol
The b-boy form is nine mil or is til
The underground sound be pumped for the new jacks
Who loves you baby?  I'm not Bo Jackson, get the bozack
Yeah, bo-e-oh-e-o-zack, check the format
Hardcore underground, just like Amtrak
Word to herb got more steel than Pittsburgh
So easy with the smart comments, or boy you get served

Something has to be said
Uh
Somebody tell me something
Whats up?

That it's on right now and we about to let off
And that the industry is sleepin and HipHop is soft
EPMD is the boss like Rick Ross
We don't knock or ring or else we kick down the door with force
Bust you down, leave a sign on you that say you lost
Game over, no more quaters, plus the machine is broke
Money don't really remember nothing, all he has seen is smoke
No witness, no statement, no case
Incorporate you eat cheese, then you get a raise
Rubbed out return to the earth
Six feet deep in the dirt
With the snakes and maggots cause you got murked

Yeah, and they keep telling me that
You're only as good as your last record
And if I was to do something now they wouldn't second
Hardcore respect it and that is enough
You got more props then call your bluff
Same thing happend to Marry and Mariah
They both came back with fire, fuck retiring
I got belts around my waist
You keep holding your pants up
Homeboy male up!
That's your opinion, cause you're not feeling it
How you know they're hot the fans not hearing it
The record pins steering it in one direction
You, there is some music in the real niggas section

That EPMD is a corporation it's not its the group
And that they always stack paper so put up your loot
Ghetto celebs that's why niggas salute
Orange juice and grey goose
We dramatic backwards now that P is loose
Me and E is back for the kill, no troops
That's why we spit the real in the vocal booth

Yeah so called gangster and you ain't even hard
So called boxer and you ain't even sport
When them ribber hit you got punked in the yard
You said you got shot and you ain't even scarred
But they belive this and you keep betraying them
You are a bitch and I'm not the only one saying it

Now he from the BX but he really soft
And he from BK but his guns don't go off
He from cop killer Queens but he still getting robbed
And he from money making but he ain't on his job
Now he from LA but he's scared to bang
And he from Texas but he will do the damn thing
He'd stay in VA but he is scared of the streets
And he's from Chi-a but he's sweet as a peach
I can tell you 'bout the dope fiends and all of that
But I let them tell it cause they sell their moms crack
And that ain't gangsta that is wanksta
Went to jail and the homo shanked ya
Don't get caught between my city and the moon
You'll be screaming at night, you loose your life at me to doom
I really hung with BIG, squared off with Pac
Shook hands in the House of Blues before the shit popped
First fought niggas in the industry and kept it cool
You ain't see me running my mouth in no interviews
And you fools on them DVD's waving tools

The big dawg of rap and the E Great Dane
My name is Hall of Fame, the game owe me some change
+The Collector+, Denzel director, go tell

Yeah mock bird with six shells, leave a smoky smell
Have you up in the hospital ringin the nurse's bell

Like ding I got hit (uh-huh) by two of rap's, most dangerous
E and P and they both had stainless

Biggie Smalls and 2Pac - left for dead
Innocent bystanders - left for dead
Big L, Jam Master Jay - left for dead
The whole hip-hop culture - left for dead (oh, my, God)

Okay fun's up (say what?) The reign son's up
Hoes down, G's up, yo let your guns bust
For the soldiers that fell, for the soldiers in jail
For the cats that ain't makin it, dudes with no bail
Stand or die, yo I tell no lie
You get caught not tellin the truth they make sure you fry

Uh-huh, we won't fry, cause we don't lie
We ain't change funk flow still same
Beats still knockin, we still rockin
Cats on the bozack, they ain't poppin
Lil' things stoppin, and that means you
Cause we shuttin you down, for the underground

Run cats out of town like P.E. we ""Shut 'Em Down""
Bustin live rounds, straight gunnin now

Shhh, out in the open, rubber grip shit with red scope an'
Beware when you approachin


Yeah, call me S-K-Y, Z-O-O
They say the first line is probably the best line
I call it the set line it's sort of the fetch line
But then the next line that follows the first line
Will body the first line and make it the worst line
So what it means is, whatever procedes this
Is above the previous, stepping stong weak shit
24 leak shit, grind with a pen
And try to line up with the pen but it's up where the nosebleeds is
S-K, the forechosen to cut 'cross
The last rapper for everyone you grew up on
I'm past better, my past letters is past headers
I'm a product of student money and black leathers
7-1-8 shit, no better replacement
Started writin backwards, young'un letters is basic
Huh, different with a given goal the way I'm pitchin with it

The dark skin packs a mack-10 who gets busy?
I stay tight, keep the vibe right
I could pull a Rampage and Wild For Da Night
I'm lethal, I still do it for my people
I break it down for em, it's hard to ignore em

The time is right, and tonight's the night, we in the hype
We got my game type shorties excited, I'm feelin nice
We roll the dice, shot of vodka and ice
People on the dancefloor, doin it right

Strictly Business (Original Recording),Strictly Business,1988.0,"I Shot the Sheriff
(""Don't get too close because you might get shot"")
I Shot the Sheriff

Try to answer to the master or the MC rap God is no joke
On the lyric - it's hard to be modest
I knew I was the man with the master plan
To make you wiggle and jiggle, like gelatin
Just think while I sink, into the brain structure
(Don't sleep on the E) You see, somethin might rupture
It don't take time for me to blow your mind
Take a second to wreck it because you're dumb and blind
So just lounge.. cause you're a MC clown
Go join the circus.. EPMD's in town

Total chaos -- no mass confusion
Rhymes so hypnotizin known to cause an illusion
Like a magician.. who pulls a rabbit out a hat, son
I pull them all like a .44 Magnum
MC freeze stop look and listen, and try to imagine
It's travellin the speed of light, but everything's motion
Is frightening.. plus the thought you alone
You now enter dimension, called the Twilight Zone
You're terrified.. plus you can't bear the thought
You and I one-on-one, in the Land of the Lost
You start to shiver.. but then you scream, my friend
Yo, wake up Muttley, because you're dreamin' again
But next time I'm on the scene, do not try to diss us
Keep your mouth shut sucker duck, because I'm Strictly Business

I shot the sheriff...

This is the rap season.. where the E starts pleasin
Girls around the world no need to be skeezin
When I roll I stroll, cool always pack a tool
Just in case.. a brother acts a fool
I've got the energy, to put the girls in the frenzy
Put it in shock when I rock, give it up I'm not stingy
Make sure I don't bore when I'm on the dancefloor..
(Get busy, boy) Like you never saw before
Rhyme flow.. good to go.. after the show.. I'll pull your ho, boy
Rhyme flow.. good to go.. after the show.. I'll pull your ho, boy
Rhyme flow.. good to go.. after the show.. I'll pull your ho, boy
Rhyme flow.. good to go.. after the show.. I'll pull your ho, boy
(Yo, you sniff blow?) .. Hell no!
I got my whole life ahead of me, no time to be sniffin
And my parents find out, then they start riffin
So I stay, a-okay, cause I'm the E.. the R-I-C-K

MC's look me in my face, then their eyes get weak
Pulse rate descends.. heart rate increases
It's like beam me up, Scotty, I control your body
I'm as deadly as AIDS when it's time to rock a party
And all due respect, when I say mic check
Let a sucker slide once -- then I break his neck
So when I say jump, you reply, ""How high?""
Because I'm takin no prisoners, so don't play hero and die
Cause you're a soldier.. and I'm a Green Beret
I do not think twice about the MC's I slay
So if you want to battle, I highly recommend this:
Bring your dog, mom, and dad.. because I'm Strictly Business

I shot the sheriff...

Yo yo, you're still pickin on that four-leaf clover?
Bring in the Sandman, sucker.. because it's over
My name is Erick Sermon and I'm back again
I see the heads still turnin and my so-called friends
They smile in my face -- behind my back they talk trash
Mad and stuff -- because they don't have cash
Like the E-Double.. or the PMD
He drives a Corvette, I drive a Samurai Suzuki
I'm a locksmith.. with the key to fame
Never high on myself -- always stay the same
Play a lot because I'm hot, like a horse I trot
Around the track and back -- fatigued? No, I'm not

Well I'm the mellow, the fellow, the one who likes to say hello
To a fly girl that is good to go
With the slow tempo, and the off-beat rhyme flow
Cause when I am in action, there is no time for maxin
Or relaxin -- just subtractin and reactin
On a sucker MC who mouth keeps on yappin and flappin
I lose my cool, then I'll start slappin and smackin
You wanna roll? Then Albee start jackin and cappin
No time to lounge, I'm packin and strappin
At my point of attack I soar at you like an eagle
I'm the sheriff, and bitin is illegal
So when I'm in town, I highly recommend this
You gots to chill, because I´m stricly business
(Eric Sermon)
Lounge, be the E-Double, E-Double, E
In the place to be and with PMD
Know what I mean? My homeboy, Bernard on the scene
Know what I’m sayin', Mixmaster John Giudice",https://genius.com/Epmd-strictly-business-original-recording-lyrics

Dirty South bouncin, cause it did snow
Even Mississippi get ten feet or more
It's the doctor, these other rappers might follow you
Me, I'm underground, I'm bound to strike for you
Right outa Belleview, PMD the nutcase
Raps stick to you like I just ate duct tape
I'm like a CNN update
You're tuned into a Rapnophobia on dub plates
At night or up late, work in the market
Black out like the one I pulled in August
It wasn't nothing like hip-hop music
Before Pro Tools took over two inch
Mic Doc, 20 years on the stage
Still _Housin_, still _Mad_, still on a _Rampage_

When I hang out in Brooklyn, them niggas like Yo!
When I'm in the Bronx, them niggas like Yo!
When I'm in Manhattan, them niggas like Yo!
When I'm up in Queens, them niggas like... (Clown)
But Bricks is in the house tonight

Don't matter if you're black or you're white
Just roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it

Dog, I'm hanging out my car, yellin out Yo!
Who got the haze for me to twist Yo!
Redman, the boss-a, rap like a pro
While your home tip toein to Al Jarreau
I'm in the cut bleedin
Tryin to stop my niggas from sellin dope to pumpin weed and leavin this
Fuck the stage, I'm in your hood
Posted with more chains that Junebug Spade
Yeah I'm the pimp of the year
Now sucker MCs can take the window or the stairs
This is Gilla, Powfanalia
Injected it got more power than Zelda

Brick city on overload load load
And if your bitch start actin up
She wanna run up with the dog dog
I say stuck up bitches (Oh no)
Punk ass niggas (Oh no)

Erick you're the reason why them dudes slow flow
Yo! You the reason why them cats got dough
You opened the door, and some of them owe
Yo! DJ, I hustle and flow
Duckin us this type like Russell Ingall
Any beat should occur, cock the four, for real
Last deal, I come out for the dumb out
Talk 'til my shells run out, then crop it
Like a movie scene and walk away clean
I'm mean when it comes to hardcore deception
Pokerface swag, all in, I bet this
I done rock shit to present MCing
When I'm in the place its graced like I'm preachin
Everybodys ears are open when I'm speakin
Nigga, look how many fans I'm reachin

When I'm in Virginia, them niggas like Yo!
Baltimore, D.C., them niggas like Yo!
When I'm up in Philly, them niggas like Yo!

And jail cats get rep to it

You know what it is, yeah
Uhh, you ain't foolin nobody

Yo, aiyyo you learn from mistakes made
You're never free until your karma debt's fully paid
That's why you stay on the path that your parents laid
Cause you never know who could be friend or foe
Even got some fam hatin, yeah a brother know
They say who'd you put on and cold slam the door
In your face like they never seen you before
Like you ain't totally down to take 'em on tour
Now everyone got a business on the top floor
They say what goes around comes around quick
Me and E see it yeah we just laugh at it
We got past our problems in the past and moved on
That's why mics are gettin wrecked and we gettin strong
Cause the past don't matter so kill the chit-chatter
EPMD reappear like abracadabra
Spot the devil real quick then rebuke that future backstabber

""What they do?"" Now I can pick 'em all the time (backstabbers)
""What they do?"" They always get you from behind (backstabbers)
They know, and I know ""What they do?"" (backstabbers)
And then they wanna ""smile in your face""

Yo P you can't trust nobody, not even family
Mad you got a Benz and they pushin a Camry
Walk around all day, steam like Stanley
Like he makin me sick, ain't that some shit?
But things change, after you break off some change
They whole madface get rearranged
Ain't that funny, how things are when it comes down to money?
Clouds turn to sunny
I'm always bummy, scared to put somethin on fly
Cause they might want somethin from me
See me on TV? That means I'm gettin it
See me with a chick, they think I'm hittin it
Well maybe that~! But that don't give you right
To count my cash, or judge my past
That's my garbage pail inside, that's my trash
That's my safe, that's my stash, backstabbers


Aiyyo - they smile in my face, behind my back they talk trash
Mad and stuff because they don't have cash

Like the E Double (or the PMD)
Yeah someone's happy to see the E not talkin to P
(Or the P not talkin to E)
But no one's stronger than God cause this here's chemistry

And you can plainly see that gold LP

Actin’ Up,We Mean Business,2008,"When one-two starts actin up
Homey duck, homey duck, homey duck, homey duck
BLAOW! Somebody shoulda told that dude
BLAOW! Somebody shoulda told that dude

""One, two, three, four, five""
Oh-six through oh-eight, this is oh-nine live
And for the new year I pack a chrome fo'-five
And keep it straight raw like Shady fo'-five
It's I, youngest in charge, a.k.a. so fly
Act up, I'm your neck like a fuckin bowtie
Back up, show respect to the newest multi-
-million sold, and that's only in the N.Y. - OH!
Get low when that kickback blow
I put a X on you squares, call it tic-tac-toe
{*click clack BLOW*} Put a lil' tag on his toe
I call it yeast infection faggot how I get that dough
So who want beef, and I'mma shoot it 'til my shooter come through
Hop out the Cougar put a hole in your medullah
It's mo' back at it I'm stoned like crack addicts
Hocus pocus sayonara I'm gone - black magic

 + (Parrish Smith)
That EPMD we a hip-hop phenom'
This style I birthed it, I am the mom
The illest (Slow Flow) and the one-two
(Without D.M.C. I'm who they Run to)
Who they come to, to get their swag
(I've been that little boy with the duffel bag)
Ain't anything changed, keep cash bags with me
(I'm a threat, so I keep trash bags with me)
Okay! Dem lay, and if dey dumpin
Double pumpin shotgun action, who's askin?
YOUUUUUUUUUUUU~! (Can't be for real)
(You eatin, but you ain't finish your meal)
Uhh, I'm the blueprint for those who can't lose
(I wrote them checks so I paid them dues)
Yeah Sermon, who walked in my shoes?
You better be Bigfoot (if not stay put)


So I'm the future of this music, bet your life on that
Since construction paper and Crayolas I've been writin raps
So don't confuse me with these bamas that, ain't got no talent
And just all of a sudden up and decide to rap
Ain't no disguisin that bullshit, they ride to that bullshit
Who bought 'em that bullshit? Your mom and them?
She probably mad, 'bout to whup your ass for not again
But don't feel bad, you just tryin to win
Talkin 'bout designers and your diamonds what you drivin in
And you ain't even behind the wheel, go to the passenger side of it
Tell me - why is that niggas do that? That nigga ain't do that
He lyin, he ain't never lived through that
Even people that know you hear you and be like ""Who dat?""
That nigga ain't do that (uh-uh, I don't believe him)
I been knew that, been seen through that
Hear you yappin 'bout some weight you never sold
People you ain't never shoot at
Take it down, let's see whatever fairy tales you bring back
(You do got a good imagination though, I can tell you that)
This force is all boss, to fakers of all fakers
Just face it, you all talk and it's PHONY BABY",https://genius.com/Epmd-actin-up-lyrics
Danger Zone,Danger Zone! / The Truth,2004.0,"Don't stop y'all
Ye aha
Yo ha yo
Epmd what
Hit squad what yea

Ayo I'm late eighties hip hop baby
The first new born to ever rock a mercedes
Rap by living
The grand wizard
Rime that squeeze it
I'm in the house come visit
Yo, i come with a sound that's ultra
That makes niggas warm
When i flow like vultures
E-dub i'm the hiphop sculpture
Cats watch me like chicks watch Ophra
Broadcasting live from newyork off the chain
A dog that broke loose and 
The mic be the simbol
I run like a fugitive
Richy Kimball when it's time to get into
(your what) your system
And become tight like god and christians
Y'all so listen
I'm the owner of my style
Tight like speedolls
With more fans the beatles

Lounge, homeboy, you in the danger zone
When a brother like E is on the microphone
I keep the crowd  till they break your dome
I rock on and on and don't stop

To the end of time like pac
Red and yo we running the spot
Don't look shocked epmd back on the block
E and mic doc
The squad that coming straight from the 
Two or what epmd start cutting it up
Legends in the game keeping rugged and rough
From day one to  on the stage  in one
The mcs will smith jeff on the twos ones
And the album trippin business and billboards number one
In god we trust
Chrome  trucks
Nigga that bust
Straight up bring a shit nuts
You ain't tough
Staying your lane
Nigga what
My pops  from  green
Don't have to try hustle in my bloods and jeans
Big pimpin break the cat
Straight getting that green
 who sleep with the mask
Hit the po, grab that mic, bust that ass

Lounge, homeboy, you in the danger zone
When a brother like P is on the microphone
I keep the crowd  till they break your dome
I rock on and on and don't stop

Third verse i advise b-boy to lock on
To 12-12-12-def.com
EP X man style like storm
Blow cats away whenever we perform
Hiphop it's war, rap's vietnam
Flows and techniques be like napalm
So why drop bombs
You epm bound to stop ya
Don't act to erick shot ya
Another lonely niggas
Counting dough and shit in the game
With this small change
Ride  dick on this nigga name
Stop that
So strictly biz, we drop da hot track
Jewels house and cars, come on
Already cop that
Rap, real to me real to E
I can  a OG b-boy MC
Spit on the mics my word
Who wanna fuck around and get hurt

Lounge, homeboy, you in the danger zone
When a brother like P is on the microphone
I keep the crowd  till they break your dome
I rock on and on and don't stop",https://genius.com/Epmd-danger-zone-lyrics
Get the Bozack (1999 Version),Out of Business,1999,"Yeah, vacation's over
As I say mic check, in eighty-nine, time to wreck
Tellin' all the sucker crab MCs to step
EPMD's in effect
Snappin' necks and cashin' large checks, you know what I'm sayin'?
And we gonna do it somethin' like this

Shazam, let me tell you who I am
The E-R-I-C-K, S-E-R-M-O-N
Call me a lumberjack or a midland warrior
Doin' damage to the world worse than the Hurricane Gloria
I'm serious -- you can say I'm furious
You're sayin' in your mind, ""Who is he?"" because you're curious
A rare rap style, not heard by the usual
You bite you get damaged, so my brothers stay mutual

While I'm makin' and takin', emcees shakin' and flakin'
Pre-heat my oven to three hundred degrees and start bakin'
Emcees like potatoes, beats kickin' like Kato
Gettin' philosophical like the Greek man Plato (who?)
The Greek man Plato (who?) The Greek man Plato
But I'm the A.K.A to flow, bro
As you all well know, I do a show
Pick up the dough and ho, break to the limo
Money in the pocket, Albee's hands on the ammo
Crack the Olde Gold as we roll and stroll
Don't play bold sucker, 'cause you was told
Your spot in the box in eighty-eight was sold
So quit the singin', come swingin' 'cause of the beat that I'm bringin'
Tryin' to wax EPMD, you be U.G.-in
On a heavy narcotic, such as speed or crack
'Cause your rhymes are mediocre but your tracks are wack
Not fiction but fact black, believe that
Then put away your demo 'cause the brother is back
And get the bozack... E...

As I sing and do my thing I might sing
Jane or the whole shabang
But if I snap during the course of the rap
P tap me on the back, throw the crowd a slap
Just to distract, 'til I'm intact
Get my Fisherman hat, so I can mack
Groove to the rhythm of a funky track
Like (""Yo, you slap me and I'll slap you back"")
I come correct with the context... flex...
Just to distract, 'til I'm intact
Get my Fisherman hat, so I can mack
Groove to the rhythm of a funky track
Like (""Yo, you slap me and I'll slap you back"")
I come correct with the context and then vex
And then flex and throw a hex on your whole complex
And then check for a second, yo, then say
(R-E-S-P-E-C-T) Respect!
For me the E Double, or the emcee rap 
'Cause me and PMD we get ours regardless
So get the bozack... P...

Yo, time to get funky-raw
Stompin' out posses (like who?) like Gigantor
'Cause when I roll I come fully equipped
Mic in the hand, tooly, and spare clips
Like a detenator with no ticks I then trick or slip
Or maybe flip while my DJ's on the mix
Never lost a battle, if I did it was fixed
You must be sick all on the dilznick like a jim hat
Your shit ain't pumpin' and your rhymes are wack
C'ause you're a nickel dime sucka who hangs with Tommy Tucker
Like KRS-One says, you a part time sucka
Who works O.T. to be like me
The Capital P, the M, I'm like D
To slay an emcee, on the S-P-O-T
Leave without a motive or a C-L-U-E
So get the bozack... E...

The MC Grand Royal on the microphone
Terrorist, mafioso, a.k. E Capone
I'm no joke on the stroke, I broke so don't choke
No hopes folks, I quote note for note
You mind float on the rhyme on I wrote (what?)
And does the wild thing like my boy Tone Loc
It's equipped with the kit that bit the whole shit
Don't catch a nitfit, because my style's legit
Brand new from the crew for you, no voodoo
A trick from the flicks master Wu Kung-Fu
Equipped with the posse and the time I need
Cock diesel like Rocky and Apollo Creed
So get the bozack... P...

Yo, mic checkin', checkin' and checkin' and checkin'
Scan the crowd then start wreckin'
Either kill or be killed in the field of hip-hop
'Cause if you're slow you blow, you get popped, mopped and dropped
If you snooze, you lose, here come the oohs and boos
I pop a No-Doz, relax my lips and cruise
Past a pooh putt'n sucka who's all about schemin'
Wax the P twice, you must be dreamin'
'Cause as you moan and groan, from the mouth you foam
Sayin' deep down inside, I should've left P alone
'Cause it's a fact, black, that when I'm loopin' the track
To lounge in the Danger Zone, because I'm back
In fact, Jack, before I launch my attack
Premeditate my assassination and come strapped
'Cause your words are uttered, your wack style is cluttered
Try to step to the E and the P and got snuffed
You get the bozack
Yo, get the bozack
Yeah, get the bozack (know what I mean?)
Yeah, get the bozack

Uh-huh, yeah

The B, the O, the Z
Get the bozack

Hahhh, yeah

Get the bozack, get the bozack
Get the booooooeoeooooeeohzack
Get the bozack, get the bozack
Get the booooooeoeooooeeohzack

Get the bozack
The bozack punk, word up

Yo, I don't play",https://genius.com/Epmd-get-the-bozack-1999-version-lyrics
A 40Oz or a Can,DJ Drank’s Greatest Malt Liquor Hits,UnKnown,"It's the E and I'm smokin'
A.K.A. Slayer, yes, the one
Sharp as a blade, call me Shogun
I must talk about the beer with the bigger figure
St. Ides premium malt liquor
I drink the ultimate, not with the Warrior, my man
A 40 ounce or a can
So on the S-T K.A. sneak tip
Get the bozack while I take a sip

Everybody's buggin' (Why?), a new brew is on the shelf
Time to ditch that old beer, kid, and go for self
Next time you're in the store, I suggest you stop halt
Grab the black and gray can with the red lightning bolt
Or zig-zag for the brothers' pants who sag
Down to their Timb boots as the 40's passed
But you must be cool when sippin' the St. Ides brew
It comes in small cans, a 40 for the crew
It really don't matter, we drink it cold or hot
Back in Brentwood, Long Island 'cause St. Ides hits the spot
But for now I'm outee, 'cause I'm runnin' low on fuel
Not petroleum, kid, but the St. Ides brew",https://genius.com/Epmd-a-40oz-or-a-can-lyrics
