We Got More,Future Rhythm,1996,"Grammy's, Emmy's that means nothin' to me
But when they rock us in the streets we say ""Ooo-we""
You see the freak in the beat, she do me
I hit that Mitty-bitties wit the sticky ooey-gooey
I got more funk in my left in my left pinky toe
I got more soul in my style
Then they will ever know
I got more rhythm than I'll ever need to show
We got them groceries, bro
Yo, Luniz, let go

I got the flow so let the Luni man take over
Get deep into my hold
If ya lost, then picture gold
I heard styles that others stole
But it's no original flow
Like the Luniz and the man wit the nose

Notice my flows kick like a loaded Mac-11
Ghetto heaven, could climb wit mo 'Good Times' than James Evans
Glock wars
Media criticize 2Pac for
Homies in the hood, be strapped with goods and we've got more

Didn't ya know
Our brothas got more
So check the new flow
Cuz here we go-e-o-we-oh
Look how we throw
A lil sumpthin to roll to
Hold you, from the O-we-O-we-O

Got that voodoo runnin through my veins
Quiz: oppressed? Yes
Crazy? No, not insane
I smooth you through the menu then I make my order
I got that dominate gene
So if ya 'noid hide yo daughter
The love ya givin is based on what I do for you
For the right amount of money you probably let me boofoo you
I like to glide up in it, but I got my pride
Ain't no whore
Don't second guess yo man cuz he got more


Studio gangstas wanna battle, well let's battle
I blasted
They plastic ass get put underground wit the Fraggles

Snaggle tooth rhymers wit no flavor
Save a gang a neighbors
Then move away so they won't be called haters

Captain Save-A-Ho
Wop wop an away ya go
The ""O"" is too unfadeable

But don't trip, get a grip
Make ya own skit, be sure
Before you slide through the door
Cuz ""We Got More""
 2x
Didn't ya know
Our brothas got more
So check the new flow
Cuz here we go-e-o-we-oh
Look how we throw
A lil sumpthin to roll to
Bump hoes to
From the O-we-O-we-O",https://genius.com/Digital-underground-we-got-more-lyrics
Want it All,Future Rhythm,1996,"I wanna go up downtown get around town
Out of town for about a month overnight
While the sun's shining bright
In the middle of the warm cold freezing hot night, that's all

I wanna put it in out through over and under
Shake and bake, first take kick the boots and blunders
I'm ready to feel the ninth wonder
I'm ready for it all

When I'm way up high
I walk the edge I'm on the verge
I get the urge to jump
I wanna fly can't do it suicide
But I wonder what it's like to fall, cause I want it all

Lemme get a fruit juice lemon drop soda pop
Popcorn candy bar chocolate ice cream and Hennessy
I want it aalll, yeah, I want it aaallll!
Yo, I want Anita, Laquita, Shakiyla, Lolita
Diana, Hannah, Rosanna, dookie-braid wearing Kelly
Shelly the redhead the big booty Emily, I want em all

Yo, I wanna smoke about an ounce and bounce
To your local discount ride spot picking up large amounts
I wanna pound extra thick quit and ask no questions
Nuff fire for the session
I want it all
I WANT IT ALL! 

I wanna have a tight body
Meet a physically fit girl named Holly
Who likes to ride the bikes exercise and go running
But I also wanna lay around the rest and get blunted

I want a fat crib and a car and boat and a good business
And a dope biznitch to share the fantasy with me
And live virtually responsibility free, I want it all g

I goes for mine all the time I'm first in line
You better get behind me, you're no friend of mine see
I want it all
I like to kick the knowledge and do good
But I still wanna be that pimp nigga in the hood
Yes, I want it all
I wanna lay back like a mack while you do me
I wanna get did but then again I wanna do you
I wanna please you, I wanna doo woo you
Do you want it all?

We gotta be safe but I wanna be nasty
We gotta bust quick but then again
I wanna try to make it last, you see
Do you want it all?

Check it out
I wanna stack and be the fat rat
Get a map flat on the hill drive a Lac
Still I wanna be back down in the hood
So I can chill with the brothers that's from there
You know we're in there
I want it all

I wanna clown with my homies
I wanna do 360's in a '69 Camaro
I wanna drop my clutch tyres scream
Bust a cloud of smoke wreck the scene
And then jet like an arrow
But then again I gotta please the ladies
(Yo, I like the ladies)
So I need a clean six-four and a drop-top Mercedes
I want it all
I wanna be as fly as the others
(Fly as the others)
I wanna freak my brothers
(I wanna freak the brothers)
With the underground street thing
But then again I wanna make my mother proud
With the Grammy nominee thing
I wanna pleeeaase all my sisters, let me give you the world!
But I can't get Japanese girls out of my system
And I wanna do a grey girl
I wanna live righteous so I might just
Follow Malcolm and kick it like Farrakhan
But then when the lights are gone
I'm out in the street acting crazy
It's great to be alive, I wonder what it's like to die
I wanna live drug free and I wanna be sober
But I wanna get HIGH until the world is over

I wanna be a real humanitarian
Eat fish and become a vegetarian
But after the party's over at 2 a.m
Then I wanna get a fat burger

Can't be bought but I'm up for sale
I'm going to heaven I'm going to hell
I like the day I like the night
I like the dark I like to bite

I wanna jack a rasta for his car keys get some dee
A kilo and gets some hoes get my stack on attack
And smoke a fool who try to take mine, I also wanna stop crime
I want it all

I wanna stay inside, I wanna get out and kick it
I like to mingle, I wanna get married wanna stay single
(Married?! Hell no!)
I wanna be this, I wanna be that
I don't know where I'm going
I don't know where I'm coming from
But I know where I'm going
Everything is everything nothing is nothing

I want fancy cars and diamond rings
I wanna do that ghetto thing
I want a wife and kids and nice big home
And next week I wanna be all alone
I want everything!
I WANT IT ALL! ",https://genius.com/Digital-underground-want-it-all-lyrics
Oregano Flow,Future Rhythm,1996,"A little high belongs to you
- Yeah, getting high off the soup, (drink it up)
A little high belongs to me
- Top Ramen's how we're coming with the loop, (sip it down)
A little high belongs to you
- A dab of this, dab of that, not too heavy on the garlic, (take it easy)
A little high belongs to me
- With just a touch of oregano
Now everybody's funking but they don't know how
They wasn't down back when the bull funked the cow
But the chest of the cow was vestless
So the stank from the D-thang bang left them breathless
Oregano flow
Don't waste your time sticking out your chest, for no
Reason: its the season for the lovely flow:
The 'D', we're sick enough of stress, let it go
Now follow as I slip into the butter melody
This is the part I take your heart and leave your vision blurry
So try to focus on my dope
And I suggest you invest in a telescope;
As I come with hella rhythm, move closer to your television
Catch a look just like a hooker catch j-izm
Even with bifocals for your ears, you still couldn't see me though
As I flavour up this vide' like oregano:
Slinging them nouns and verbs
You couldn't hear me with binoculars
I guess I'm kind of different cause I do love them hoes
Only not the same way that I love my niggaroes
Cause I love it when they say something fly
The ill caps make me laugh till I cry
Some fries and some freaks and it's on, all night long
I love to see my homies living strong
But that cook with the cloudy cookbook
Rained salt on another brother's sunny day
I wonderin' if we're really happy here
With this lonely G game we play
A little high belongs to you
- Yeah, getting high off the soup, (drink it up)
A little high belongs to me
- Top Ramen's how we're coming with the loops, (sip it down)
A little high belongs to you
- A dab of this, dab of that, not too heavy on the garlic, (take it easy)
A little high belongs to me
- With just a touch of oregano
Now everybody's looking but they cannot see
The 'D' because we're future and we're too slippery
You know we're coming with oregano flow
Don't waste your time sticking out your chest, for no
Reason it's the season for the lovely flow:
The 'D', we're sipping off the stress, let it go, let it go
Top Ramen's how we're coming with the loops
Oregano, baby, oregano
A little high belongs to you
- Yeah, my soup'll get you high, (sip it down)
A little high belongs to me
- Top rhyming's how we're coming, bye-bye
A little high belongs to you

Food Fight,Future Rhythm,1996,"Game 11
This is a federal food fight
(You better know it)
That means we're callin' out all you kooks and crooks
(What? We're about to rip this shit)
Oh, me? My name is Humpty Hump
(There's a party in here, baby)
I'm the original big-nosed rapper, baby
(You better get down with this, baby)
We're about to sling hot food all over this piece
(Just nothing but a food fight)
Here we go, back in the house for the 9-whatever
(Food fight)
With the bacon and egg sandwich
You ain't bringing groceries, G, your groove is getting rude over records
But can you sling the food like this?
You better bite this, if you wanna make the people move like this
Chez wa, Allah, cheese burger
Flame broil base, my pickle make ya wiggle
You're busted, my mustard will wax your whole plate
By itself, not including all my funky condiments
Nod your head to this and duck down
As I commence to lock and load a fresh cantaloupe
Yo, I'm illin', I'm slingin' melons like the felons are slangin' dope sacks
So max but I wouldn't stand so close up in the light
Either bring it or hide 'cause it's about to be a food fight
(You need something for the food fight)
We hit you in the neck with a cheeseburger
(Gotta bring food to the food fight)
Yeah, bruh, we hit you in the neck with a cheeseburger
It's classic, slapping brothers with some lettuce from jurasstic
I counteract it with the Shock with ham hocks
From brothers who might 2Pac
Fifty-seven black too hard but lots of flows
Fat like hippopotamus, still caught 'em though
In the face with excrements, peep my testaments
I bring the seasoning paprika
Eureka for the weaker, and smoke the reefer
Dribble up the funk in the beaker and, yes, about to say, ""Speaker""
It leaks in your ears and years ahead
I went to Japan and they was throwing pork balls
But I'm calling protocol, stop
(You need something for the food fight)
We banked you in the neck with the cheeseburger, come on
(Gotta bring food to the food fight)
Yes, we're slugging the chicken nugget to your grill
(You need something for the food fight)
Get ready, we're coming fetti with the groceries
(Gotta bring food to the food fight)
Someone shoulda told ya, it ain't over till it's over
Now if I am what I eat I hope I ain't a big couchie
Gotta substitute the 'Ouch' for the 'Ooch'
If so, I hate to see my man Donnie O, he'd be a butt hell
Substitute the 'Ell' for the 'Ole'
Actually, factually hella fools I know would be toe up
If you was what you ate, no fakin'
My man Nate would be a plate of bacon
My brother Shock popcorn, and my cat would be a rat
My girlfriend would be some super sperm and things
My rich nigga Pac would be a lobster with hot wings
It's quite simple, if true that my temple is wrecked
I'd be some mushrooms and cognac
I'd be a pinto bean gravy smothered neck bone
Scrilla taker, vanilla wafer, baker, filler
So come on with your food slingin' 'cause I'm ready
Bring it shut up nigga, sing it
(You need something for the food fight)
We banked you in the neck with the cheeseburger
(Gotta bring food to the food fight)
Yes, we're slugging the chicken nugget to your grill
(You need something for the food fight)
Get ready, we're coming fetti with the groceries
(Gotta bring food to the food fight)
Someone shoulda told ya, it ain't over till it's over
Bring the groceries

Fool Get a Clue,Future Rhythm,1996,"Yo wake up it's the D crew up in here with the Black Spooks
And we bout to drop it on y'all...y'all best get a clue
Fool get a clue, get a clue, get a clue
Now everybody wanna tell everybody who to be with
Really doesn't matter to me long as I miss that H-I-V shit
And AIDS ain't the end of the world girls and us do kinky stuff
And theres way to muff without the fluids touchin
Never hide the truth if my body and hair is sacred
Then why we can't be naked in public
It's totally natural like sex is but this is
A law that had to be made by men with itty bitty penises
The streets of this world they are my playground I explore them
Meet somebody I don't like and I ignore them I don't destroy them
They way that you know who be he want me to hate like he hate
But I got too much m poopoo doo with me
Chorus:
Fool get a clue it's a new game
Can't be trippin on you I go my own way
Players gonna play with who they wanna play with
People gonna always lay with who they wanna lay with
Well it's the B-L-A-C-K to the S-P double O-K
It don't matter what another man say
I'm gone still do it all my way
Cause I'm slick like C-Bo's quick
I don't wanna be down with yo gross click
I just wanna snap photo flicks
With a freaky little trick puffin dodo sticks
I can live foul as dirt road hicks
I can make three plus two make six
Cut with verbal scrapes and nicks
I'm as ill as chicks with dicks
Scuff my kicks I'm bustin licks
Openin somebody up like Vicks
Purchase ism by the bricks
Plus I brick city hoes I picks
All in yo mix as I ease betwixt
Like sitcom vix be greasin dicks
I be skeezin chicks when the season switch
I be makin tricks itch like fleas and ticks
I swoop low and prey on tricks
Large I've got my own prefix
I'll stop twitchin wheres my fixer
I gonna break shit up like Twix
Chorus
Fool get a clue it's a new game
Can't be trippin on you I go my own way
Players gonna play with who they wanna play with
People gonna always lay with who they wanna lay with
You want me to want what you want

You want me to be like you be
(I go my own way)
You want me to trip like you be trippin
(I go my own way)
Gotta go my own way
(I go my own way)
Maybe it ain't your flava but I'm gettin wit it
Maybe you wouldn't be seen wit it yo but I'm splittin wit it
Maybe it ain't your style or your shape but I'm hittin it
You want me to hate what you hate
But quit it forget it
Cause I ain't wit it
This country tis of thee
Taught me how to bring the groceries
Now I'm crazy just like I'm supposed to be
Smokin mothafuckas my mentality
Sex, money, and drugs mean the most to me
Murderin mothafuckas ain't a thang to me
And I'ma keep slanging G

You gotta keep holdin on
You gotta keep on fightin",https://genius.com/Digital-underground-fool-get-a-clue-lyrics

To keep the people sleep deep on the streets
Strung up! It keeps you lifted longer

Hold on, I think I got 2 new females in my e-mail

They told me unity was not at home
But they lied
I seen them with my TV screen phone

Find time to program a freak the way I program the beats
Tweak the eats, ni son chi
Now ladies speak your speech
Hella sweet but kinda salty your balls

Got me this hard, dry swollen, out of control
Bow to the audience
Collect your chips and switch your clips
And leave the scene with the green
We give them future rhythm

Moses knows this so he flows
Prophesy for the future
They're making microchips for your toes

And the Nose knows those that goes
Against the flow of Mother Nature
You're breaking up the show

Louie Louie, yes we received your fax
It said to have each others' backs

(In the future) No imitation Gs flexing tecs in the hood
Bravery turned sweetery, 150 turns on their streetery
Warriors who blast passed what they can't do
It's how we're hitting em in the future rhythm
(In the future) We'll still be getting lifted
The gifted will rise, no lies from the higher-ups
Power shifted, wine and  ain't gon be the pride
Of brown town, less stress and desperation in our eyes

Walk Real Kool,Future Rhythm,1996,"Welcome
Select player green or blue
And proceed

We’re just some fools
And we’re rollin’
It takes some fool
Who knows?where?we’re goin’?
We roll?real smooth
(Can we go for a?ride?)
And even when we’re strollin’
(How y’all walk?)
We walk real cool
Will?tell?me?where we’re goin?

Now?let me me?say, “Hello”
Let me put the melody in my flow, cause yo
I’m gonna reach deep in my soul
And flip the story that we all know, but we seldom show
A break from the usual
Silly games and the hoe show, cause bro
It’s gonna bring the truth in this video
Spit game like an old pro, girls flow

Now if you got the new BMW and the Rolex, baby don’t flex
What’s that got to do with you
When your breath smell like brew and you can’t figure 9 times 2
No, you can’t help anybody
So yo, don’t even go there
Cause I read ya
(Cause I read ya)
It’s who you are inside
And as a friend will you be there when I need ya?

Fools in the town mackin’ and slinging
Jacking old folks, so relentless
It’s hard enough being down
But then we got our own folks
Up against us makes us

Just some fools
(Just some fools)
And we’re rollin’
It takes some fool
(It takes some fool)
Who knows where we’re goin’?
We roll real smooth
And even when we’re strollin’
(How y’all walk?)
We walk real cool
Will tell me where we’re goin?

Now if I was to go
And get witchu just because you’re rollin’, in dough
Soon it will show
And that will make me nothing more than a hoe
Baby, don’t you know
Real love is bringing out the best in us, for sure
But greedy people are messing up the funk for the rest of us, solo

I can’t believe they got us living solo
Make me think my mind is going loco
Better catch eachother cause we’re fallin’
I can hear the rubber room is callin’
Who’s got the biggest rings, the most gold or the longest hair
Yo, I do not care
I want the freak with the clean teeth (Clean teeth)
An open mind and that treats me kind
So I can rest my mind
The way that everything is going down
It always got me thinkin’ always sinkin’
We gotta hang on, gotta live long
Gotta be strong, gotta move on
Can’t keep on being

Just some fools
(Just some fools, y’all)
And we’re rollin’
It takes some fool
(Fools take a guess)
Who knows where we’re goin’?
(How y’all roll, how y’all roll?)
We roll real smooth
But even when we’re strollin’
(How y’all walk?)
We walk real cool
Will tell me where we’re goin?

Release your mind and let your instincts flow
Release your mind and let the funk flow
Let go of your fears, let your instincts flow
Open up your ears, it’s the D-Flo

We’re just some fools and we’re rollin’
It takes some fool who knows where we’re goin’
(Who knows where we’re going)
We roll real smooth even when we’re strollin’

We walk real cool, will tell me where we’re goin?

Used 2B a Sperm,Hit Pack,2011,"I used to be a sperm
Was it fun?
No, it was hurry up run

Many years ago I was a sperm in a ball
In a really great nation a hundred million strong
And everybody's waiting for the big day
When they open up the main gate and let us go play
It only happens once in a lifetime
A chance to go to heaven
And in ball land, heaven means the egg
Then out of a hundred million of us
Only one gets to dip in
Can you imagine the competition?
An all-out bloody war to the finish line
My man Al, he was swimming in a squiggly line
I said, hey cap, why you zig-zagging like that?
He said, I was raised Baptist, and this is what we practice
I'm trying to go to heaven
Look at page seventy-seven
It says a zig-zag line is divine
I'm like, a'ight, chill, whatever, it's clever
Me, I got a different plan
I'm swimming in a straight line, fast as I can
Peace!
After that, I seen my girl Reese, fine as fuck
But she was swimming in a circle like she's stuck
I'm like, Reese, what up with it, why you not running?
She said, I'm a Christian and running is a sin
I said, what about the egg,  baby, what about survival?
She said, you better slow it down, Greg, have you read the Bible?
Yeah, and the Koran, and The Color Purple
But I strongly suggest you swim straight, not in a circle
She said I'm a heathen, and I'm having too much fun
But I left her standing there 'cause I gotta keep running!

I used to be a sperm
Was it fun?
No, it was hurry up run

Then I run into this brother named Ben
Said suicide and holy war is how you get in
Reminded me of Al a little bit except without the perm
I got away from Ben, he was killing other sperms
Germs! I noticed on my left, but I kept racing
They had a flag said Gonorrhea Nation
Expressions on they face was ugly, plus they smelled bad
I was glad when I seen my man Brad
I'm like, Brad, what up with it, why you not running?
I just become a Mormon, won't be doing any running anymore
Oh no, another bro bites the dust
He said, have you met Jesus yet?
I said, I gotta go, I'm in a rush!
You won't find the egg like that
Originally it was a curse if you're black
Oooh!
I should have slapped that cap or dropped that cap
But I ain't got time to stop like that
How could he be so lost like that?
Back to the race
I get to the main gate first but I pause
'Cause I heard about them nations that were lost
To a titty or an ass fuck
Imagine it
Joke was on them
They were swimming around in shit
Another hundred million of us was dead when they found them
Died from the spermicide up inside a condom
Cats is on my heels
I gotta think fast
I guess it looks safe
Left the shaft of my world
Went out in pink space
And there it was, as beautiful as all God
The mighty egg
Woo!
Glad it wasn't no blow job

I used to be a sperm

The Humpty Dance,Sex Packets (Cassette) ,1990,"All right! Stop whatcha doin', 'cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that ya used to
I look funny—but yo I'm making money, see
So yo world I hope you're ready for me
Now gather round, I'm the new fool in town
And my sound's laid down by the Underground
I drink up all the Hennessy ya got on ya shelf
So just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a ""umpty""
Yo ladies, oh how I like to funk thee
And all the rappers in the top ten--please allow me to bump thee
I'm steppin' tall, y'all, and just like Humpty Dumpty
You're gonna fall when the stereos pump me
I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky
I'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
But sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
Hey yo fat girl, c'mere--are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat; look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from getting busy
I'm a freak, I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy, allow me to amaze thee
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me
I'm still getting in the girls' pants
And I even got my own dance

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

People say ""Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'""
That's all right cause I get things cookin'
Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me
But ya can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B
All the girls they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really being sincere
Cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still getting paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge
Both how I'm living and my nose is large
I get stupid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid
I use a word that don't mean nothing, like looptid
I sang on ""Doowutchalike"", and if ya missed it
I'm the one who said, ""Just grab 'im in the biscuits""
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write
All ya had to do was give Humpty a chance
And now I'm gonna do my dance

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Oh, yeah, that's the break, y'all
Let me hear a little bit of that bass groove right here
Oh, yeah!
Now that I told ya a little bit about myself
Let me tell ya a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do--check it out

First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shaking and twitching kinda like I was smoking
Crazy wack funky
People say 'ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty'
That's all right cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain
Humping, funking, jumping
Jig around, shaking ya rump
And when a doo-doo chump punk points a finger like a stump
Tell him step off, I'm doing the Hump

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Black people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
White people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Puerto Ricans, do the Humpty Hump, just keep on doing the hump
Samoans, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Let's get stoopid!

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Oh, yeah, come on and break it down

Once again, the Underground is in the house
I'd like to send a shout out to the whole world
Keep on doing the Humpty Dance
And to the ladies
Peace, and Humptiness forever",https://genius.com/Digital-underground-the-humpty-dance-lyrics

I see guys and girls dancing
, ooh, ooh


Now as the record spins around, you recognize this sound
Well, it's the Underground
You know that we're down with what you like
Yeah, with what you like, yeah

And though we're usually on the serious tip, check it out:
Tonight we're gonna flip and trip and let it all hang out tonight
We're gonna say what we like

Cause, yo, yo, we wanna know how many people in the flow
Would like to just let yourselves go
And do what you like
Yeah, well tonight's your night
 Just eat food, try not to be crude or rude
Kill the attitude, chill the serious mood
And do what you like
Yeah, and doowutchyalike
Everybody doowutchyalike

 I mean rich, poor, high, low, or upper-middle class
Let's all get together and have a few laughs
And do what we like
Yeah, and do what we like, yeah, and do what we like
And since you came here you gotta show and prove
And do that dance, until it don't move
Do what you like
Sometimes I bite
 Now if you're hungry, get yourself something to eat
And if you're dirty, then go take a bath
Messed up the line?
Nope, sometimes I don't rhyme
Help yourself to a cracker, with a spread of cheddar cheese
Have a neck bone, you don't have to say please
Eat what you like, yo, smell how you like
Everybody doowutchyalike

 Just act a fool, it's okay if you drool
Cause everybody's gonna strip, and jump in the pool
And do what we like, yeah, and do what we like
 
Homegirls, for once, forget you got class
See a guy you like: just grab 'im in the biscuits!
And do what you like
 Now, red, white, black, tan, yellow, or brown
It really doesn't matter, we can all get down
And do what we like, yeah, and do what we like
From a pink-skinned Yankee
, to a blue-black Southerner
Ditch digger or a governor
Just do what you like
Look how you like
 Now don't you know we're getting busy, it can't be corrected
Shake it, had to be def
I say what I like
Like I said, sometimes we bite
Even though you don't think it's right
Yo, I like to bite
Just have fun y'all, and if you think that it's wrong
You got to admit, it's a new type of song
Doowutchyalike

 Alright, here we go, y'all:
Do what you like
Talk how you like
Drink what you like
Grab who you like
Feel what you like
Eat what you like
Scratch where you like
Itch if you like
 Daddy, can I go outside?
 Ha, go where you like, kid!

Now if you wear corrective shoes and you got big bunions
Toenails smell and look like onions
Don't doowutchyalike--
Go see a foot doctor tonight!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, everybody doowutchyalike

 Straight hair, curled, casual or glamor
 A shy girl, or loud like a bama
 From Connecticut, or from Louisiana
 Bad table etiquette, too much chatter
 Very well spoken or real bad grammar
 A minority token, a brother in the slammer
 A free civilian with a house in Santa Ana
 If you got a million and living in Atlanta
 If you got a weak bladder or can't climb a ladder
 What we're saying is, it really doesn't matter
 I need a word that sounds like ""Ana""
 Slipped on a peel of banana
Doowutchyalike
 Yeah, cold getting stupid
 Once again, you got the sound of the Underground
Baby Dope is in the house
 Boyyy!!
 Are we puttin' things in check, Baby D?
 Too stupid check
 I'm wit' it. Yo Dave, let's show 'em some old school
It makes no sense just standing around
Come on everybody, let's all...
Yeah, and do what we like
 From a lime to a lemon, a lemon to a lime
Come on, young ladies, let's have 

 And do what we like
 
Now I can sing, I can dance, I'm the king of romance
Are you sweet young ladies gonna give me a chance
To do what you like
 And get that thing packed tonight?
 
Vanessa Williams, ooh, you're so divine
Just wanted to put your name in my rhyme
And doowutchyalike
Yeah, everybody doowutchyalike

End the record how we like!",https://genius.com/Digital-underground-doowutchyalike-lyrics
Freaks of the Industry,Sex Packets (Cassette) ,1990,"Well, we're the freaks of the industry
My man, Money B, Oh my mellow, Shock G
The freaks of the industry
And when you see us back stage, be prepared to G
Well they say that birds do it, bees do it. 
Time to freak, Money B gets to it
Not a heavyweight, but I go twelve rounds
With a jab and a stick, I'm goin' lick for lick, so
Give me the helmet, I'll be the stunt man
Just relax, and I won't front
Like Anita, I'm givin' you the best that I've got
And I'll be takin' it slow, never missin' a spot
Yes, caressing your back we're chest to chest she's kissing on my freckles
I nibbled around your ears before I suck upon your neck
'Oh Money B,' yeah, that's what you'll be screamin' and creamin'
But it's not a wet dream, it's the real
The freaky dog, dark nasty, never lettin' a kitty-cat get past me
Without picking it up, pettin' it, teasin' it
Takin' it on home and pleasin' it
Cause we're the freaks of the industry
You's a freak Money B. You got that Shock G
The freaks of the industry
And when you see us back stage, be prepared to G
Say you're G'in' 
Nobody else is seein'
And the freak that you're wit' is in front of you
Bendin' over naked, and she's leanin' on the dresser 
You're lookin' at her from the rear 
She looks just like Vanessa 
Uh uh, not Vanessa with the singer career
But the X-rated video queen
Know what I mean?  A'ight, here's the scene:
You're lying on you're back with your head on the edge of the bed
The booty's two feet from your head:
Should you: A, take the time to find a condom
B, you walk right over and you pound 'em
C, tell her that you want her love
Well the answer is D, , all of the above
So you're freakin' , the furniture's squeakin' 
She's tweakin', sayin' that she's weak in the knees
Cheek to cheek, and pound for pound
You're taxin' it and waxin' it and workin' it around
'Til the booty starts makin' that clappin' sound
Which is cool, but your friends are chillin' in the other room
The clappin's getting louder, you don't want them to clown you
In this situation, what do you do: 
A, you, plain and simply, back up off her
B, you hit it just a little bit softer
C, you take it out and put it in het butt
Well, D is what I do, so, yo, listen up:
I put a towel on the floor by the two inch gap under the door
Now they can't see me any more
Check the locks so they can't clock, but they can listen
There'll be no bargin' in and there'll be no dissin' 
Gettin' back to my mission, break out the whipped cream and the cherries
Then I go through all the fly positions:
My head under her leg under my arm under her toe
She says, 'I like it when you scream, baby let yourself go.'
I hit it and split it, lick it and quit it
After the ride, put my clothes on and walk outside
And before anybody gets a chance to speak
I say, 'Yo, don't say nuttin', I guess I'm just a freak!'
Cause we're the freaks of the industry
Aw, you's a freak, G. Yo, you worse Money B
The freaks of the industry
And when you see us backstage, be prepared to G
[You know what man, you's a freak
I seen you with that girl at the hotel after
That show last week
And what about that time out there in the park?
Shhh, don't tell nobody]
It's like this:
Now if there's a cure for this
We don't want it, we'll run from it
And if there's a remedy
We don't need it, we just eat it
[This is to the ladies: I'm a freak
Hey, yo, piano man: take us out of here, man]",https://genius.com/Digital-underground-freaks-of-the-industry-lyrics
Hip Hop Doll,Sex Packets (Cassette) ,1990,"*	this song is on the cassette but not the CD
Pump pump, de pump, pump it up y'all, we're talkin
Bout a hip hop doll

Babe when you feel me, ooh, how you thrill me
You are my hip hop doll
Yes, baby, would you go with me once and for all
And then when you squeeze me, ooh how you please me
You are my hip hop doll
Yeah, baby, if you married me we'd have a ball
Kick the beat, y'all
[Verse 1: Shock G, 
Kenny K
]
She was an east coast dame, she knew she was pretty
The place: a hotel lounge in the town of Atlantic City
The girl was down, you know what I'm sayin
There wasn't much room to groom
People talking and tickin' clock stopped, when she walked into the room
Kick it, K
Her beauty was shocking: pretty mouth, pretty nose
A pair of black fishnet stockings: pretty feet, pretty toes
I made a last minute play to the men's room, to get myself into groove
Turned to my homeboy, asked him how I looked, my boy Earl said, ""schmoove""
Got out the mirror, and went to work, my forty dollar hat was hittin
I bit down on a wintergreen certs, I stepped up and started spittin
I set my pace: I said, ""Excuse me, but I scored that a nine point nine""
But her face looked confused she said, ""come again,""
I said, ""You know the way you fell inside of the place, you got style""
She smiled, said ""You're working real hard for some satisfaction""
She grabbed the dice, and told me ""go on""
I said, ""Oh my God, she's givin' me action.""
As we was kicki it live, i threw a four and a five, my point was a nine
She told the maitre'd, ""Bring your best bottle of wine,""
And then she tipped him a dime
The wine arrived, we made a toast
Let's try to keep it all in the midst, click
I downed a swallow of wine and threw my point: a three and a six
Know what I'm sayin?

Pump pump, de pump, pump it up y'all, I'm talkin bout my hip hop doll
Pump pump, de pump, pump it up y'all, we're talkin bout a hip hop doll
Pump pump, de pump, pump it up y'all, we're talkin bout a hip hop doll
Pump pump, de pump, pump it up y'all, we're talkin bout a hip hop doll

Bust it:
Just lookin at this girl was dope
She made me nervous
(You know, like a Jewish man feels when he meets the Pope)
So I said to myself, ""think fast, game, but don't insult her.""
I had to be cool because the girl had class, I can tell she was cultured
I made my spill: tickets to the symphony, music by Sebastian Bach
But her reply, ""Well son don't be ill
You see I don't listen to nothin but HIP-HOP!""
I said, ""damn,"" I let her throw me a curve
I don't know what came over me
Cause all I had to do was stay down, you know what I'm sayin
But check out my recovery:
I said, ""Yo, you really like hip hop? Well, you're lookin' at an MC
And to you I dedicate this rhyme, young lady, so put your arms around me.""
She said, ""Baby, I've heard all the lines
I pioneered this, I'm housin, I ain't no joke
I get raw, how you like me now? You're a customer, et cetera""
But then she started to choke on her wine
I said, ""Easy baby not so fast,""
I took the wine glass out of her hand
She said, ""No no no, you don't seem to understand, my man
Look at the tables, you hit ten grand!""
I said, ""Yeah!""
Picked up my chips, turned around, extended my arm
And then I screamed, ""I'm kickin it!""
Took her by the hand, ""Let's go, you're my good luck charm""

Pump pump, de pump, pump it up y'all, I'm talkin bout my hip hop doll
Pump pump, de pump, pump it up y'all, we're talkin bout a hip hop doll
Pump pump, de pump, pump it up y'all, we're talkin bout a hip hop doll
Pump pump, de pump, pump it up y'all, we're talkin bout a hip hop doll
Cut it up, fellas

Babe when you feel me, ooh, how you thrill me
You are my hip hop doll
Yes, baby, would you go with me once and for all
And then when you squeeze me, ooh how you please me
You are my hip hop doll

""Yo man, what's up with the Underground, man?
You guys old school, new school, R&B or hip-hop?""
What should I tell em?
Now this is not your average everyday rap song
We won't be rockin bells that go a ding and a dong
The bass drum will hit but won't be lingering on
Check out the way we kick it on the microphone
The funky beat is playin and we're swingin along
The Underground is rockin with the hip-hop song
The drums are ringin with the serious tone
Ah clock this y'all, we're on the microphone
Ah emcees, you like the way we swing
Well listen close and make sure you don't miss a thing
Don't you know that we're the microphone masters
Known to emcees as the raw-dog bastards
We bust rhymes, and write everyday
So listen close, to the things that we say
Triple-slippin emcees will get verbally raped
We'll send you home with that look on your face
And just rock this, you can't stop this
Ah just rock this, try and clock this (try and clock this)

See we don't play for other hip-hop crews, it's not about you
We do the things that we wanna do
We're emcees to please the loyal followers
But you you're just a sucker hip-hop borrower
Your real name is probably Bradworth or Bennett
Your verbal baggage ain't got nuthin in it
You think that you're rockin but you're not hip-hoppin
So you best stop jockin at the masters

Yeah, cause America, likes the way we swing
Emcees, you like the way we swing (you like the way we swing)

Cause America, likes the way we swing
 You're triple-slippin you're triple-slippin
You're triple-slippin (yo man) you rhyme like a school teacher
About convincing as a preacher, who smokes reefer
Why don't you give it up just put the mic down
Get out of town with that noise, this is the underground
Not your average everyday rap crew
You can tell by the things we say the things that we do
The funky beat is playin and we're swing along

Right, and if you're married, it's no big deal
You're not cheating at all, you're just poppin a pill
And if your wife's got a headache and wants to hit the sack
It's cool, take a packet fool
Biochemically compacted sexual affection
Now here, take a look at my selection
Yeah he's the packet man
Yeah he's the packet man

Sure, I got guy packets Cool, give me some of em
Now let me tell you how to take it:
Either sit or lie down, and you really should be naked
Otherwise you're gonna mess up your clothes, know what I mean?
This is more than just a dream
It's very realistic and it's gonna blow your mind
So be careful: only take one at a time
And never take one behind the wheel
You'll black out and hit a pole Cool, let's make the deal
These are 40, these are 80, and this one here is 10
Just give me a hundred dollars, I'll call it even
But don't pull your money out yet, see

Over here, Yeah, this looks kinda cool
20, 40, 60, 80 a hundred, shmoove
Here's my number, in case you need to reach me again
And remember, you need to be as safe as you can
There's only one thing safer then using your hand
Dial that beeper number, and call the packet man
Yeah he's the packet man
Yeah he's the packet man
Yeah he's the packet man
Yeah he's the packet man",https://genius.com/Digital-underground-packet-man-lyrics
A Tribute to the Early Days,Sex Packets (Cassette) ,1990,"Yo, we gonna do this like this, aight?
I say, it’s one is for the Buddha, it’s two is for the sess (uh-huh)
Three is for the coke and don’t forget the Buddha-bless
Yes, yes, y’all, and you don’t stop
Ah keep on, ‘til the break of dawn
Ah keep on, ‘til the early morn’

A Technic, Gemini, amplifiers, too
Don’t you know, Kenny K, it’s o-on you
Check it out, you don’t stop
‘cause it’s on, ‘cause it’s on
And the beat don’t stop ‘til the break of dawn
The beat don’t stop ‘til you all get home
Know what I’m sayin’? And you don’t stop
Doc P  – my mellow, my man
Just get on the mic and turn out the land

Ah Yes, yes y’all
Ah yes, yes y’all
Ah yes-yes ah yes ah yes-yes y’all
Well I was walkin’ down the street real late one night
Looked – up ahead I saw a big, bright light
I got the temptation and I couldn’t resist
So I walked on over and took the big risk
I walked a little closer, and what did I see?
Seen a big spaceship, just land as could be
The doors opened up and to my surprise
This short, grey dude had walked outside
He had some blue and white Adidas and some fresh white Lee’s
He even had a nameplate that said, “E.T.”
He walked on over and he said to me:
“I don’t come from Pluto, Venus, or Mars
I came from a planet beyond the stars
See it’s not very far from here you see
It’s just a couple light-years, maybe two or three
Without – wastin’ time I want to get to the point
I came to Earth to rock the joint
‘Cause I can do the ‘lectric boogie so nice and that’s me
One night or seven days a week,”
So Shock-G, my mellow, my nigga
Get on the mic and don’t pull the trigga

A while ago, I wanted you to know just who you been listenin’ to
Well I’m the baddest in production of the Digital Underground crew
I’m just six-feet half a bow-legged ass that you ever would want to see
Ah that’s right y’all, that’s what I said, ‘cause I’m talkin’ ‘bout little old me
‘Cause I can sing, I can dance, I’m the King of Romance
You sweet young ladies, won’t you give me a chance?
To prove to you that I’m the best
So I want your telephone number and your add-ress
Yeah, your name, telephone, address, and all
I might want to see you, I might want to call
Ah keep on, you don’t stop
Keep on, you don’t stop kickin’ it!
Ah yeah ah yeah! (don’t stop)
Kenny K!
In the place to be

Check it out, y’all
I seen this freak, the freak was on
I turned around, the freak was gone
I went on home and stuck my key in the door
The some ol’ freak was lyin’ on the floor
The freak went down into my pants
I figured that she want to do the freak-dance
But I didn’t try to stop her, ‘cause that would’ve been on the whack
She said, “You’ve got a dick like a Whopper, but it tastes just like a Big Mac.”
I’m Shock-G y’all, and I’m in your town
I’m Shock-G y’all, I’ll make you all get down!",https://genius.com/Digital-underground-a-tribute-to-the-early-days-lyrics

Some more food, some more good music...
How's it going, guys, you guys come to Gutfest every year, or what?
Oh yeah, Gutfest is the best thing to happen to California since 1968
So, uh, where are you guys from?
San Diego..]
Gutfest, Gutfest
It's a show, not like you've ever seen befo'
In the park, from noon 'til after dark
There will be blondes, and also girls of bronze
And girls who come from other contries 'round the world
Now, you will see a big display of ladies in a cage
Butt naked, and they're showing off their curves and sexy ways
So pack a bag, and come on down, if you can find the time
We just would like to say welcome to Gutfest '89
Crazy guts, crazy guts, it's Gutfest '89
Crazy guts, crazy guts, it's Gutfest '89
Crazy guts, crazy guts, it's Gutfest '89
The festival is on the lake, the hotel's up the block
It's clean, they've got good rates and they've got lots of rooms in stock
Tell them you're here for Gutfest, you'll get ten bucks off per night
Bring your camera and your condoms, cause we're going to do this right
More girls then you have ever seen are on display right now
Girls with breasts that go va-voom and booties that go pow!
Black girls, white girls, candy stripe girls, girls with lots of back fat
It's safe to say more healthy guts then you can shake a stick at
I trooped in, now let the Gutfest begin
It seems like sin, my head's startin' to spin
Thinkin' what I'm about to clock, all stops are being yanked out
I'm knockin' stank out the box, every chance I get
Because I waited and waited, to make this trip
Yeah, one big stupid butt nest
And I'm'a get mine at this Gutfest

Crazy guts, crazy guts, it's Gutfest '89
Crazy guts, crazy guts, it's Gutfest '89
You'll see tourists and you'll meet people from all around the world
At last year's fest I kicked it with a real cute Chinese girl
Sometimes after the shows at night, or in the afternoon
Some guts come up and give you skull right in your hotel room
Most nice girls do not give good brain, for others it's a racket
Some guys leave Gutfest out of luck and 
go home with a packet
Heavy, slim, big, large, girls with lots of gook
Cover girls and model types, girls who've got the look
Young butterfly, tulip petal, mahogany devine
A thick bitch with big legs, yeah, it's Gutfest '89
Gutfest, Gutfest
Gutfest '89, Gutfest, Gutfest
Gutfest '89 y'all, crazy guts, crazy guts

It's just Gutfest '89 G-f-G-f-G-f-G-f crazy guts
I got this plan, see, and it involves whipped cream, bananas
One girl stands behind me, the other in front...
Well, I never tried this stunt before, but I'll tell you what
We'll bust the cherries, then we'll sprinkle some nuts on top
Then we'll do the splits.  Now what have we got?
G-f-G-f-G-f-G-f crazy guts
Heavy, slim, big, large, girls with lots of gook
Cover girls and model types, girls who've got the look
A red bone with good muscle tone, a young cocoa delight

The Danger Zone,Sex Packets (Cassette) ,1990,"(Listen while they're comin man hurry up with the party dog shh be quiet)

Enter a new dimension
Can't you feel the tension
Ever heard the word prevention
Well you really need to pay attention
You only need a little bit
So you want another hit?
Call emergency on the telephone
You're in the danger zone
(""Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"" -- Erick Sermon) 4X
Verse One: Shock G
You're in the zone, when you need another upper (another upper)
You took a slip and goin out like a sucker (like a sucker)
Matter of fact, you're more than just slippin
You're way beyond control, you're on a mission (on a mission)
You walk right through a wall
To get a twenty, a forty or an Eight Ball
And once you enter this area
There ain't nothin scarier, and all I wanna say to ya
Is just back the hell up (back the hell up)
You need to go where they let you do your thing in a cup (thing in a cup)
And you take a diagnosis
You see your boy Shock G wrote this (wrote this)
To open up your mind
Do you know who I am, deliverer of the rhyme
My job is to verbally slay suckers
Like an uzi spray motherfuckers (spray motherfuckers)
The Underground is gonna get ya
Now pay attention you're about to enter
Into a new dimension
Can't you feel the tension
I'm sure you heard the word prevention
So like I said pay attention
You only need a little bit
Ya still want another hit?
Even if it's home-grown
Yo, you're in the danger zone
(""Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"" -- Erick Sermon) 8X
Verse Two: Kenny K
On the corner, I see cocaine addicts (cocaine addicts)
Givin static and about to go at it (bout to go at it)
And then you hear somebody holler
(Who was it K?)  It was Dopefiend Carla
She was waitin on a winner (on a winner)
That HOE, every night she has crack for dinner (crack for dinner)
But everybody's basin'
Even the suckers who are runnin this nation
YES, I'm pullin no punches
The government gets drugs in bunches
Shock G, get the nine
But don't shoot until I finish my rhyme
This zone, makes suckers stop breathin (stop breathin)
Sweat bullets drop down to their knees and
Start beggin for your pipe cause you're all in
Sometimes you can feel yourself fallin
Into a new dimension
Can't you feel the tension?
Don't let me forget to mention
The Underground is puttin their two cents in
What's the matter, feelin blue?
Does this record bother you??
If so, you need to leave it alone
You're in the danger zone
(""Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"" -- Erick Sermon) 8X
Verse Three: Shock G
Caught a red light downtown (downtown)
Freak was on the tip, cause my window was down
Stuck her head in the car, it was Dopefiend Carla
She said ""Can you spare five dollars?""  I said ""hell no""
She said ""I'm not asking for much""
I said ""bitch, I'd rather give a crippled crab a crutch (crab a crutch)""
She said ""Why you wanna clown me""
I said ""It's simple, I don't like fiends hangin round me
Can't you see, that you got a disease?
You weight sixty-six pounds, down from a hundred and three""
The light turned green and I was gone
She was livin in the danger zone
It's a new dimension
Can't you feel the tension
You recognize this sound
Go on, just put the pipe down
What's the matter, feelin blue?
Does this record bother you??
If so you need to leave it alone
Punk, you're in the danger zone

Rhymin’ on the Funk,Sex Packets (Cassette) ,1990,"S-H-I-N-I-N on the funk
And listen to the emcees rhymin on the funk
We solemnly swear to never bust a style that's bunk
So listen to the way that we're rhyming on the funk

Now we would like to ask you
Have you ever heard this style befo'
You gotta say no
Cause there ain't no denying
And if you say yes you're lying
People are always wondering
What's up with the Underground
Are they down?
Or is just another new sound
We're saying things
And when we use a beat we use it right
Cause we're not just playing things
Spitting rhymes
Like a Tommy gun spraying things
So when you see us onstage
Don't just stare us down
Or compare our sound
To any other crew ya like
Yo, judge how ya like


Riding this like a roller coaster
Hugging the curves and dipping
Like I'm supposed to do
For the Underground troupe
Cause I know I'm the poop
Steaming hot
Stinking up the dance floor
Gonna do it freelance
For the funk, my friends
And all the others in the industry
They want to get with me
(Shock: Why is that, Mon?)
Maybe it's my smooth flow
They know this guy is dope
So they get hip to the style I'm using
It's called Raw Fusion
Ain't no time for ego-tripping
Let it be known
There'll be no slipping on mine
Cause all I want
Is a chunk of this Underground funk


Yo, Money-B

What's up cold Shock G?

Check it out, would you tell the people what we mean

What do you mean what we mean?

You know what I mean
Tell 'em what we mean
When we're R-H-Y-M-I-N on the funk
Let 'em know that we got spunk

We got it

And when I count to three
Go on and hit some of that humpty-hump
One, two, three

Well, I'm humpty-humping
You know that I'm saying something
The funk's in your face
Gonna keep the place jumping
As the beat keeps pumping
I'm tick-tocking 'em
Dope rhymes, I'm dropping 'em
On the twenty-four track
And there ain't no stopping 'em
It's too late to put the tape on pause
Because we're


Tell me if you think the beat is nasty
Well get ready, we're going to get sweaty
Just in case I hope you brought a towel in
I'm on the prowl when I hear the bass growling

Growling like a big bass monster
On a rampage, it's like we were onstage
Shock G speaking from the Underground

Do they understand?

I really don't give a damn
Cause we're",https://genius.com/Digital-underground-rhymin-on-the-funk-lyrics
Underwater Rimes,Sex Packets (Cassette) ,1988,"We'd like to ask now that all passengers please hold your breath
As we take you through an underwater hip hop extravaganza
We're now desending, we're two hundred fathoms and now deep
We're four hundred fathoms, we have arrived
Now last night, underwater, I saw a French mermaid
Treated her to caviar and wine over shrimp brain
In the raw, on the ocean floor, need I say more?
You never heard nobody kick it like this before
Pink champagne, octopus brains
Saw your DJ underwater through the window pane
That sucker tried to hit a mix, but the mix didn't happen
Records kept floatin' all the fish kept laughin'
A blowfish blew my mind and started to rhyme
As the octopus cut nine records at a time
Your boy said, ""Show me how to keep my records down""
But the shark ate his amp, your boy got clowned
The rhymes he say have no particular order
The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter
Go 'head bite his rhymes if you think that you oughtta
Hold your breath, M C's, my rime's underwater
Underwater rimes
Underwater rimes
Underwater rimes
Underwater rimes
I tried to mix a cut from a TV blooper
Got pulled by a deep sea state trooper
Told me that I didn't have the right to bite
I said, ""Your wife looks just like a fat blue grouper""
Sittin' in my aqua blue jail cell, didn't have my bail
I had to break out with the rhyme
Shrimp scatter on a platter, I rock like a mobster
Told an MC, ""Yo, you look like a lobster""
Qualified to wreck your mind, I get busy one time
Like fish on a dish, you getting served with the rhyme
Kick the jam in the crowd if you need a fo' instance
Watch the people stop, they don't want to miss this
I'm tweakin' your speakers and I'm makin' no sense
'Cause on your turns, this record burns like incense
The rhymes he say have no particular order
The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter
Go 'head bite his rhymes if you think that you oughtta
Hold your breath, M C's, my rhyme's underwater
Underwater rimes
Underwater rimes
Underwater rimes
Underwater rimes
Underwater rimes
Underwater rimes
Uh, 1, 2, 1, 2, check , 1, 2, 1, 2, they call me MC blowfish
We're gonna do a little something like this
Well I'm a deep sea gangster, underwater prankster
Kissin' all the girl fish, dissin' all the sangsters
Because I blew your mind and started to rhyme
Doesn't mean that we're cool, 'cause you'll be back next time
With a hook and a line, so you can hear that fryin' sound
I'm tellin' you I'm down
I'll spin your boat around, leave suckers lost in the bay
You wanna play? I'll hook your line to a stingray
Get out of here with that boat and a stick
Get out of line, I'll call my homey Moby Dick
I'm not thinkin' 'bout dyin', fool, stop tryin' to test me
People fishin' don't catch me
And when you get home, sad 'cause you missed
Just remember MC blowfish
And you don't stop, oh yeah
Uh oh, here comes that stupid shark again
I guess I better blow up",https://genius.com/Digital-underground-underwater-rimes-lyrics
Your Life’s a Cartoon,Sex Packets (Cassette) ,1990,"I said your life's a cartoon

You woke up, threw on a striped yellow tie
Threw down a cup of coffee, kissed the wifey goodbye
Leave the office each day around eleven o'clock
Then you drive, stop, park, walk about three blocks
To a peep-show booth and meet a girl named Ruth
Wasn't sweating the shame, didn't use your real name
Booked a hotel room, suite paid until June
Get home and tell wifey that you're not in the mood
But then the game got stale and your face grew pale
When you came home early that day feeling ill
Stepped through the door, dropped your brief and your beeper
Your wife is getting down with all your housekeepers
You was mesmerised, how could you be surprised?
Only gave it to her Christmas and the fourth of July
Oh, you had it going on, with ease you really worked it
Let's review the scene just to see if it was worth it:
Okay, last fall's when you started it all
October to when you caught your wife bending over
Broke up your home now you're on your own
You lost your dignity; your self-respect is gone
I got to laugh though, cuz, cause you thought you was slick
At least she got it free, but you? Youse a big trick
You helped the pimps get paid, took a shot at catching AIDS
And got your wife turned out by the butler and the maid

Your life's a cartoon

Try to take a nod on the bus, put your ear in a blob
Left by a moisturiser overdoing slob
Nice and wet down your neck with the jheri curl drip
Couldn't see out the window cause the drip was so thick
Walking through the mall with the house shoe lag
Greasy doorag, sour jheri curl bag
Loud talking and walking jerking your neck
It's the first of the month, you got your welfare check
Storekeeper johns, they're rubbing their palms
Cause they know you never read the words in the Koran
Where it tells you don't be jealous 'bout what you don't have
Support the brother who opens up a shop on the Ave
You want slack cause you're black but if it ain't dirt cheap
You're quick to say 
And that's another thing, man, the way you're talking is played
You got to know the language if you wanna get paid
Oh, you got a few ends, you might be driving a Benz
But it's the credit man who wins out in the end
He's got your car loan, interest on your mother's home
He's got your daddy paying off shit he don't even own
That's what I'm talking 'bout, man, what's the deal
But just listen, I ain't dissing, this shit is for real
Get yourself a nose job, yeah that's down
Trying to look like a white man, you brainwashed clown
You're up on European fashion and Japanese cars
But if Wong pulled his market off the block you'd starve

No Nose Job,Sons of the P,1991,"Ruth, send in the next patient

Dodio-doe, there'll be no nose job
Said dodio-doe, no nose job (smarter than that)

People say, yo Humpty now that your records is sellin
Ain't it about time for you to be bailin out
Of the race and community you come from
Yo, your face has gotta change, Hump!
Ice Cube says you're making more than Donald Trump
So yo, go on and get your nose fixed, Hump
Dr Cook: Sit down
Humpty: Wait a minute, uh-uh
Dr Cook: Get in the chair

Listen, now the black girl wants to get her lip tucked
She says Doc, I want my slim hips so I'm a slim figure
The white girl says my hips are not big enough
And yo, Doc, inject the collagen and make my lips bigger
All of these so-called celebrities
Selling millions of records and claiming no responsibilities
A young girl sees you on a TV show
She's only six, says ""Mama, I don't like my nose!""
Why'd you have to go and mess up the child's head
So you can get another gold waterbed?!
You fakehaircontactwearingliposuction carnival exhibit
Listen to my rhyme, you need to hear it


Uh, and you don't stop, check it
I smell the message from the TV
Does my Humpty nose deceive me?
Smells like the blacker the wacker
Polly wants to be a cracker, if you let her
But see for me, the bigger the nose the better
They say the lighter the righter
Oh yeah?! Well, that's tough
Sometimes I feel I'm not black enough
I'm high yellow, my nose is brown to perfection
And if I was to change it'd be further in that direction
So catch me on the beach, I'll be getting a tan
Make sure there's no mistake that
Humpty-Hump is from the motherland
Laying in the sun, string bikini
Between the buns of two cuties
Still macking, there'll be no nose job


Come on, Humpty, let's get out of here
Dr: Hi, Humpty. My name is Dr. Cook, I'll be handling your surgery today
HH: Uh, surgery?! Ain't no surgery, said I don't want none ­
Dr: Yeah, but you're gonna be a big star
HH: ""Star""..? Look I'm already a star ­
Dr: A huge star, kid
HH: Y'all don't understand, man ­
Dr: Big, really big!
HH: So what, I don't wanna ­
Dr: Yeah, get his legs
HH: Put me down, put me down!
Dr: Come on, Humpty, don't worry about a thing, don't worry about it
HH: No, no!
Dr: Calm down, you're going to be fine..
HH: Hey!
Dr: Come on, sedative
Nurse: Sedative
Dr: Scalpel
Nurse: Scalpel
HH: ""Sedative""!? ""Scalpel""?!

Good Thing We’re Rappin,Sons of the P,1991,"Alright parents, go head tuck the kids in, PG time is over
This goes out to all the macks in the industry
Huh, alright roll the tape
(You ain't no pimp; You a rest-haven for hoes.)
It's a good thing that we're rappin'
'Cause if it wasn't for the rappin' we'd be mackin'
It's a good thing that we're rappin'
'Cause if it wasn't for the rappin' we'd be mackin'
It's a good thing that we're rappin'

There was a time when they called me Smooth Eddie
Playing the hoes and shook the red card steady
It was Mike to those that knows
Matter of fact, Icy Mike 'cause he was cold on them hoes
We was East Coast niggas heading west
I was rolling shotgun, cooling with my man Fresh Wes
The royal blue Brougham was a drop top rag
You could tell we was pimps from the Las Vegas tags (On the Caddie)
'Cause that's how we flipped it
Hit a lick, paid cash, said nothin', pimp shit
All of this was around spring '81
I was in the life and had a good three year run
Anyway, one Friday on the side of the highway in L.A
My man Wes says ""Hey, I got a bitch in San Diego""
""Cool"", I said, ""I'll see ya in a couple of days
I'm gonna stay and play some L.A. hoes""
He said, ""Alright playa, yo, I'll see you soon""
Yeah that's how real players kick it, see there ain't no rules
We roll from city to city, like kids playing hookie
Later that night I knocked a bitch named Cookie
She says, ""I love you and I want to make you rich""
I says, ""Oh yeah?"", I swear I worked the shit out this bitch
She was fine, niggas couldn't tell me nothin'
Had brains too, did more stealin' than fucking
A real thoroughbred, played con like a pro
Man I'm trying to say I had a money making ho
But the Sunset track got stale, Cookie went to jail
Had to sling a little yale to make bail
She said, ""I'm hot baby, I can't work in this town
The vice pick me up just as soon as you put me down""
I said, ""Shut the hell up ho
Who asked you to run your mouth?""
She was right though
It was time to take a trip down south
And to this very day, when I think of how
I was living back then I got to say that

It's a good thing that I'm rappin'
'Cause if it wasn't for the rappin' I'd be mackin'
Good thing we got music
If not I'd be stuck with findin' a way to get ahead
And then we got to use it
It's a good thing that I'm rappin'
'Cause if it wasn't for the rappin' I'd be mackin'
Good thing we got music
If not I'd be stuck with findin' a way to get ahead
And then we got to use it

They call it ""ho po'"" when you're leakin
So you know that ho po' is when yo po', cause you got no ho
I was po' but I wasn't ho po', cause I had one ho
But we was leakin cause the money was slow
""Cop and blow"" means you're going up and down
I went from Cadillacs in Vegas to the back of GreyHounds
In San Diego, off Broadway, there used to be a spot
I think E Street and 5th where all the players flocked
One night I was cooling outside
Saw my man Wes said, ""Ah shit yeah, it's gonna be live""
I was working a double-breast silk weave suit
With my five hundred dollar brown knee-high Ballys
Wes said, ""it's pimpish how you wear 'em outside ya pants
And by the way my ham sandwich in the alley""
'Ham sandwich' meant Brougham Cadillac
Quarter inch whites with the chrome wheel kit on the back
It was snotty nose, that means the extra chrome plate on the grill
For sunroof we say it had the brains blown
I said, ""there's bitches inside, you ready to attack?""
Wes looked at me said, ""Mack..Mack..Mack..Mack..Mack""
My man's pimp stroll was cold gangsta limpin'
We stepped inside, both of us screamed, ""it's pimpin'!""
I was drinking cognac, Wes was drinkin' gin
Wasn't there twenty minutes 'fore my people walked in
I said, ""what's up Cookie? how'd you do?""
She said, ""cool, reach under the bar, so I can give you these few""
We always did it like that, in case the vice squad was peeping
This time they wasn't, but this nigga who was leaking
Walked up and said, ""y'all gonna sell?""
Wes said, ""nigga don't ya recognize the 'P' when you see it?""
He said, ""oh, yo I didn't know, I thought she's doin' business""
I said, ""yeah, well it's true that she's a ho""
He said, ""she with you, playa? cause I'd really like to buck her""
Looked at her, said, ""baby, I'm a raw motherfucker""
I said, ""yeah, that might be true, but she don't need another nucka""
Ain't no choosin', jump on off slick, this one here's my shnucka""
He said, ""whatchu mean by shnucka?""
""It ain't too hard to figure
You call your nigga nucka, shnucka means she-nigga
And figure this too, the bitch is down for my dirty drawers
Find another ho to go for yours""
He said, ""but, I like her""
I said, ""you must be a rookie
Now figure this three"", he cut me off and stepped to Cookie
He said, ""how do you feel about this, my dear?""
I said, ""nigga you don't check my bitch like I ain't standin' here!
Now I told you that this woman sells pussy for me
You and her ain't the two, and we ain't the three
And most of all nigga, I ain't the one
Now back the fuck up off me son""
He said, ""to block another man's game is a shame""
I said, ""leakin' ass nigga, game recognize game
Now I told you that's my people and I gave you a chance""
Reached down and started pullin' out my tool from my pants
Shoulda capped his ass, but instead
I look up and Wes done wrapped a pool stick 'round this nigga's head
So I put my shit away, we beat him down cowboy style
Cookie runs up and says, ""baby you okay?""
I says, ""yo, all of this excitement got you dizzy
What you standin' 'round watchin? bitch get busy!
Go back outside and finish gettin' my money!""
The bartender laughed, said, ""you pimp niggas funny""
And I'll tell you once again
It blows my mind, when I think how I was living back then
Cause yo

It's a good thing that I'm rappin'
'Cause if it wasn't for the rappin' I'd be mackin'
Good thing we got music
If not I'd be stuck with findin' a way to get ahead
And then we got to use it
It's a good thing that I'm rappin'
'Cause if it wasn't for the rappin' I'd be mackin'
Good thing we got music
If not I'd be stuck with findin' a way to get ahead
And then we got to use it
And you don't stop
Humpty Hump in the house
And yo I go, I go

Give my propas while I watch the soap operas

Pat your feet on the concrete and go get my money woman!",https://genius.com/Digital-underground-good-thing-were-rappin-lyrics
The D-Flo Shuttle,Sons of the P,1991,"Yes, people it's time to take the train
To another place of positive elevated experience
And existence, for this is a journey
To a place where only the dolio-flow can take you

Now I hope it don't be too long
Waiting on a train come to take me home
So I'll sing another funky song
Just until another one comes along
But I hope it don't be too long
Cause I know I'm gon' do something wrong
If tunnel don't glow and the shuttle don't show
Dolio-flow, come take me home

Around, around, around, around the sons of the flow we goin
Around the underground to spread the sound about the d-flo
Let me give your ears a baptismal
Dip into the pool and let me chisel
Chunks of ignorance out your brain system
As I implant wisdom in the name of d-flo
Here we go with this, let me flow with this
Holy glory, how the dolio flow in this
Wanna serve em' natural learning
Shooting it like sperm to the egg in your head
D-flo is my bread and the body in my cup
Just like it says in the scrolls and
Just as sure as Moses used to write on a rock
I'm glowing cause I'm knowing that the d-flo'll stop
Swing low and take me home riding on a breeze of air
There ain't no fare, the only fee is just believe and it'll drop
Pee is a believer so I'm waiting in the zone
For d-flo, d-flo to take me home

Now I hope it don't be too long
Waiting on a train come to take me home
So I'll sing another funky song
Just until another one comes along
But I hope it don't be too long
Cause I know I'm gon' do something wrong
If tunnel don't glow and the shuttle don't show
Dolio-flow, come take me home

Now I don't want to be a dope man, listen
I didn't have a dime, a nickel, penny, a pot to piss in
See all my clothes had holes and they fit tight
Pray to God cause it's hard trying to live right
Waiting on the train can't hang with the street gangs
Making me insane, putting rain on my whole brain
But the train means change to better thangs
Can't live with the negative and ghetto pains
Can't be late, can't wait to get to where we're going
Almost ten to four and I'm sure that the train is showing
But I ain't sure where it goes, I don't really know it
But I got faith, that's all it takes to get to where we're going

Now I hope it don't be too long
Waiting on a train come to take me home
So I'll sing another funky song
Just until another one comes along
But I hope it don't be too long
Cause I know I'm gon' do something wrong
If tunnel don't glow and the shuttle don't show
Dolio-flow, come take me home

Now I'm dreaming about a trip to paradise though
I don't know where it is I really want to go tonight, so
I can move on and find a place that's right fo'
Me to be me and my eyes to see the light though
We've been waiting for something real
And we just can't wait no longer
We need something that we can feel
We need something that's much much stronger
But how long do we gotta keep waiting
How many years of anticipation
I can't stand the rain, the racism, all the pain and the aching
So I'm dreaming of escaping..
Yo, my man, you know how to get to the shuttle?
I'm trying to find the Underground
Yeah man, it's right over there
Right over where?
Is you deaf or something? Can't you hear it?!
Look, you ain't telling me nothing!
Just go ahead and get on the train

Now I hope it don't be too long
Waiting on a train come to take me home
So I'll sing another funky song
Just until another one comes along
But I hope it don't be too long
Cause I know I'm gon' do something wrong
If tunnel don't glow and the shuttle don't show
Dolio-flow, come take me home
Now I hope it don't be too long
Waiting on a train come to take me home
So I'll sing another funky song
Just until another one comes along
But I hope it don't be too long
Cause I know I'm gon' do something wrong
If tunnel don't glow and the shuttle don't show
Dolio-flow, come take me home
I said I hope it don't be too long
Waiting on a train come to take me home
So I'll sing another funky song
Just until another one comes along
But I hope it don't be too long
Cause I know I'm gon' do something wrong
If tunnel don't glow and the shuttle don't show
Dolio-flow, come take me home

Heartbeat Props,Sons of the P,1991,"People, get ready for the heartbeat props
(Heartbeat props!)
Everybody, get ready for the heartbeat props
(Heartbeat props!)
We're gonna make it funky with the heartbeat props, y'all
(Heartbeat props!)
It's time to get busy with the heartbeat props
(We're giving heartbeat props)
I give my man props cause he's living
(Why wait until the heartbeat stops)
Check it out, y'all, proper respect is what we're giving
(We're giving heartbeat props)
Uh, I give my man props cause he's living
(Why wait until the heartbeat stops)
Don't you know that proper respect is what we're giving
(We're giving heartbeats props)

Seems like you wondered each day if the Underground
Is going to stay down with the funky beats
Even if you know that I'm a junkie for a bump that's funky
And a fool for the loop, see, a groupie for the old one-twoiee
A bass freak would say ""Oohwee
Peace to DU cause I like the way you do me""
I love to go on about the funk, matter of fact
I'd love to be another funk front runner
But first we gotta deal with the fronters
So I can't go on, it's time to drop a few bombs
Get busy, G, go on and take 'em to school
Yeah, it's time spread the jewels
I ask you about Malcolm and you tell me that he's wicked
Farrakhan comes you can't seem to buy a ticket
And check what my man has got to say
Right or wrong, don't you think that he deserves a play?
Cause he's living for you and you and you and you
The brother X tried but he died trying to get through
So why wait until the heartbeat stops
Yo,  go on and give my man his props
If you're really that down then act what you say
KRS and Chuck need support today
I see you posing with the Dr King hanging on your wall
Only difference is Chuck might give you that call
To march on Friday, yeah, it's kind of frightening
Let me move so I don't get hit by the bolt of lightning
Striking you down cause you're fronting
A dead leader can't tax your mind
Therefore he's not a threat to your personal time
All the lagging and the dragging
(Yo, I got something to do that day)
Yeah, you sound like an old bitch nagging
Fuck that fronting (Fuck that fronting!) We're pumping up the brothers
Cause the brothers keep it pumping
You got it all wrong
When you wait for the TV to tell you what's going on
I thought you're hype on the mic
Yeah, they never get it right
That's why you see we gotta thank God, y'all
For niggas like Ice Cube
Cause they'll tell the record straight
Yo, my man's a prophet too
Yo, god, you think he ain't?
So do the right thing, it's not a black or a white thing
We're here to let you know it's just a human being thing
We're pulling out all stops
Cause it's time give heartbeat props


I'm the type of guy that's sly like a fox
An honor roll student in the school of hard knocks
There was a different type of brother that I used to look up to
But I'm still giving props where the props are due
But let me start with a fool I don't give a fuck about
I wanted to give a ""Fuck You"" out
To the nigga who went out on a whim
He was a roody-poo for shooting Huey Newton
But I'm thanking God for niggas like Iceberg Slim
And the chick the honky's ran to see
She was the honky-tonk's fantasy
Tina Turner, the living legacy
And she's still got you tripping off the legs you see
Another chick they used to beg to see
Was Josephine Baker, she had them hooked
They loved the way she shook her money-maker
But why did it take them so many decades
To give a little praise to who they ran rave to see

With a dark complexion she was sex symbol befo' Marilyn Monroe
But her heart stopped before they gave props to the old pro

It took a great man to mould those
So I want to give props to my pops because he told those
But there's a time to break necks and throw bolos
Be a cold bro and throw low blows
When you want to close the shows of your foes
Cause foes are those that you got to break like windows
Check it, when respect goes it's time to break a nose
But give respect before the soul goes

Well, I suppose respect is what respect'll get ya
So I'm giving them gifts before they're stiff like the pose
In the pictures of Vogue and flashy fashion magazines
You be thumbing in 'em, props to Beverly Johnson
She was the first black woman in 'em

Pee, drop the bomb and end the pressure with the menace
Smith & Wesson clear the lesson that your mama gave

Mama gave PeeWee the same threats, she used drastic measures
Told me to give her the full respect or get my ass kicked
It was my intention to relent just till the last kick
When she goes she'll roll over in a solid gold casket
When I was young Muhammad Ali had me sprung
Cause he was the champion, as the champion he was my idol
Yo, they took his title when he wouldn't take the gun
And fight in Vietnam the only way he felt, then he won the belt again
Now they want me in the army but they can't harm me
Cause I ain't no punk, I ain't  man to Uncle Tommy
Props to Islam, it's getting brothers together before the big bomb
Blast out, before we're all assed-out
We need to see that we got to start giving the props to the living


Yeah, Spike Lee, Alex Haley, Brand Nubian, sister Whoopi Goldberg
Dick Gregory, X-Clan, sister Isis, BDP, Muhammad Ali, Stevie Wonder
Poor Righteous Teachers, Andrew Jackson, Denzel Washington
Sister Shahrazad Ali, Public Enemy, Stokley Carmichael
Sister Oprah Winfrey, yeah, Jesse Jackson, nuff respect, Paris
Gangstarr, Gil Scott Heron, George the fuck Clinton, Louis Farrakhan
Sister Queen Latifah, Bill Cosby, sister Angela Davis
The entire Nation of Islam, nucka, know what I'm saying?
Afrika Bambaataa, Miles motherfucking Davis, sister Assata Shakur
Once known as Joanne Chesimard, Robert Townsend, Nelson Mandela
Kareem Adul-Jabbar, the Black Panther Party, James Earl Jones
The FOIs, nucka, Howard E. Rollins, sister Naomi, yeah, nuff respect!",https://genius.com/Digital-underground-heartbeat-props-lyrics

Tales of the Funky,Sons of the P,1991,"Funk is my mother, George is my father
Obsessed with creating another author
Now I remember back when everything was On the One
(Nah, they couldn't get none)
Let me take you back a little further than that
The Mothership Connection and the rest of the pack
But think back, when Bootsy's Rubber Band hit the stage
With the star-shaped bass, he'd send the crowd into a rage
Stop, look up, and what do you see?
The Mothership landing in DC
So, yo, thank God for Parliament
Everybody funky knows that they was heaven sent
There's Michael Hampton at one end of the stage
Banging out Maggot Brain with Eddie Hazel
Yo, I remember that and you do too
He would always call the Mothership down for you
Ga-ga goo-ga, ga-ga goo-ga, ga-ga goo-ga
Yeah, you can do it, Humpty, don't be shy
But Shock G, come and reminisce with Shorty B
You know that I was born one of the Funkentelechy
Humpty-Hump and the Horny Horns why don't you blow for me

Tales of the F-U-N-K-Y, tales of the funky
She said, I know the drummer can you let me in?
Tell the guitar player that I brought my friends
She was fine, sweet with a touch of class
No Head, No Backstage Pass
Funk used to be a bad word to you
I couldn't stop myself writing a funky rap or two
So Free Your dull-ass Mind your funky Ass Will Follow
Your funk is watered down, in other words it's kinda shallow
Get Up to Get Down, I said I'd Rather Be With You
George and Bootsy, what a hell of a crew
But since you've been lost, yo, I've been so lost too
So Flash your Lights in the air
And don't forget that the funk Mob is everywhere
Don't be Standing On the Verge of Gettin It On
And George'll be the first to tell you when the funk's gone
There's funk in everything you do so don't be stupid
You might imagine me funky though like Cupid
What is this? This is a tribute to the Mob
D'void of funk so my set don't Slop
I'm kind of Cosmic like Vernon
I rap around the mic like Fuzzy
And like Starchild and Grady
I grab the funk by the neck and let it take me
To the Aquaboogie, with a giggle and squirm
And if you ain't funky you will learn
I confess you've got to clean your chest
And don't forget that Everything is On the One

So would you, could you funk, do you wanna
And if I ask to funk are you gonna
Get stopped, cream always rises to the top
See pop ain't where I'm coming from
So haul to the left and don't forget to bring your Bop Gun
Do that stuff like you knew (Shorty B)
And if you're down with the funk, that's me and you
And now that I just took you back to the future
It's time to wake you up so I begin to suture
Stitch you up, and then I mend your wounds
But Red Hot Mama's got the Loose Booty
My lyrics amaze the vital juices, wanna do me
Like Too Short, too many funky words sooth me
(Yo, I'm tripping) Trojan on my tip and won't trip
About the articulation from my lips
So here we go, I'm about to show
All the homies in the hood that I can flow
With the Underground, with the P-funk in the sound
And if it ain't gots the P it ain't down
I'm like Al Capone on the microphone
I'm blasting lyrics through your dome, all through your home
But like Ice Cube said, ""Once again it's on""
I won't bite though just to write a funky rhyme
I go platinum, for the very first time
I wrote my rhyme in the park, but not Paisley
And if Prince is on my tip it don't phase me
I'm from the old school of funk
Yo, I got Knee-Deep bumping in my trunk
This is not a trivia or a quiz
I just put the funk back in showbiz, y'all

Ain't nothing but a party, y'all, haha
Haha, once again, 1991, Shorty B
Hitting you off with mfstbc (??)
Still kicking it for the Acorn posse
Yeah, Jerry Hodge is in the booth kicking it
Yeah, wanna send a shout out to Shock G
Cause without him there would be no me
And that's M-E, and I'm O-U-T",https://genius.com/Digital-underground-tales-of-the-funky-lyrics
Flowin’ on the D-line,Sons of the P,1991,"Now this trip's to let you know the Underground can flow
We'll go toe-to-toe with any bro that wants to go
But those who go need to know that we're an elite fleet
Of very unique MC's and as a treat 
Jeremy programmed a beat
That I could flow on, I'm a go on, the D-Train's about to roll on
The day I pulled out my fat marker and I wrote on
The windows of the train, wrote my name, bout to do the walls
Had to pause, cause: two police
Officers get on, they barely fit on, the train was packed
We're standing back-to-back cause there was nothing left to sit on
I'm looking around to see who's down, realize I'm all alone
Mostly people coming home from work, a couple of sisters and a fag
Yes, this would have been a drag
But I'm chilling with my tall can in my brown bag
And I'm sipping, your boy Shock was cold dipping
Sipping real slow and dipping real low so 5-O don't be tripping
Check it though, a minute or two later
I finished my brew with nothing to do, broke out cold made a
Pimp move to the next car looking for trouble
Rub the stubble under my chin and squeezed in between
A pair of big, bubble butt freaks:
Two Russet-potato-&-bacon eating sisters
One had too much make-up on but, yo, I didn't diss her
Cause she was kind of cool though
Both of them was cool enough to do you know
We picked more people up at Broadway Station
Being down I had to clown and make use of a situation
So I'm rubbing the girl's booty behind me
Right near the bottom where the booty and thigh meet
My middle finger's riding down the line of the seam of her jeans
But she don't seem to mind me
But then she shocked me, almost clocked me
Tried to slap me, caught her hand and said
""You better be glad my name is Shock G
Cause if my name was Dre, from N.W.A
I'd cold slap your ass and tell you have a nice day.""
She said, ""Wait a minute, Shock G! I know that name
I seen you on Arsenio, what you doing on the train?""
I said ""I'm trying to stay normal."" She said ""Really? That's a winner
I'm studying law, don't live too far, would love to cook you dinner.""
I said ""Cool. Bring your friend, I like the both of youse two.""
I knocked the boots, the sneakers and the house-shoes
It's like that baby, ya don't stop
Cause my name is Shock you know that I like to rock
One time
Yeah, you got the sound of the Underground
Doing it to you in your ear orifice
(Yeah, don't you know
The Underground's doin it to ya flowin on the D-Line)
Yo, 2Pac is in the house. Got a big grin on his face

Aight

Yo, 2pac! Fuck's up?!

What’s up, Treach, nigga

What's up, there's a whole BUNCH?of?y’all just like?the Flavour Unit, what's up with?that?

Word, we all kinda deep, right

Yo, you should tell Shock to do a song with everybody, putting everybody down, you know

Shock would never do that..!

People want to know about the Underground
And how the hip-hop rivers keep flowing
They want to know where we've been and where we're going
Straight dropping style after style
Let's take a look through the emcee file
Hmm, we've got the K down in Tampa Bay
We've got Mone in Oaktown, we've got Blocko in L.A
The list goes from Africa to down in Miami
Yeah (boy) time to introduce the family

What do you know, our reunion, the family’s back
We went our own different ways, was broke, and now we’re living fat
A different journey and a path we took
Some strayed the wrong way but hey, that's okay
Blocko! The one to break up all the chitchat
Sit back, relax and max as we attack this wax
But it’s like that, that's the way we're living
A Puerto Rican brother with the gift for giving

Well, it's the ‘M’, the ‘A', the ‘C', the dash, the ‘M'
The ‘O', the ‘N', the ‘E', that's me and him
The two, the three, the four, the five, the six
The ‘I', the ‘A', the ‘M', the, hmm, the shit
The one you waited and waited, debated for
To rush and bust and crush and slam the door
To rip and kick and spit a funky rhyme
But I'm ‘O', the ‘U', the ‘T', the ‘O-F' time

Hiphop sound from the underground, family
Gather round, Zulu baby with the boots and crown
Slip in to give us a listen of what you're missing
Able and gifted enough to speak in geez while we're kicking
So listen, it ain't where you're from, it ain't where you're at
It's where you're going, if you didn't know before now you're knowing
The Underground family runs the show
We wrote a song about it, you want to hear it? Here it go

It's a family affair (yeah!)
It's a family affair (family)
It's a family affair (yeah!)
It's a family affair (family)

Yeah, Big Stretch with the motherfucking Underground
Check the sound, it's a family ting running you down
And no question, wrecking from back in the days
With Shock G getting money in criminal ways
But now we're gold and microphone rolling
Sucker duck stolen, leaving the hoes cold drooling
Digital Underground with the Squad
Fuck around and get scarred, it's a family affair

Stepping to the mic as I recite a little line
You don't know who I am? I am the Master, the Mind
Sitting back relaxing as I tell a little story
Like in Wallalaley and Glory!
Met the homeboy December, yo, I do remember
The lyrics I spit make him high and dismembered
A tip of my lip is a hit so beware
I'm down with the ‘Ground, and it's a family affair

It's a family affair (yeah!)
It's a family affair (yeah!)
It's a family affair (yeah!)
It's a family affair (family)

Feel the fire, Shassiah is running live kick it
Like a luxury line with the tube of precision
The way we flow the rhythm hits the party from top
We got the sunshine rhyme so hype air drops
Coming straight from the bridge and going beyond
With the capital ‘P' and the magical wand
Inch one in effect, St. Ides forty beers
Shassiah and I'm out of here, ‘cause it's a family affair

Through audio, video and even in stereo
Walking down the street while niggas try to peep
Our style, I'm telling you it's wild
Brothers looking out for one another
Writing and reciting our poetry
Chilling while you're illing, making cash money
But step to one hass if you dare
And then you know it's a family affair

And here comes P.B.C., O.B., Rakiem

And D-Love

And don't forget my man T.F.E
Cause we're wrecking ‘em

Wrecking ‘em

Wrecking ‘em, adversaries to none
All parts of the body

Don't step to them

We swing this ep for the kleptos
Step while you sweat

Here comes the rep in control
Of the freaky dope concept
That's the time to rhyme

Another Jackson hit

A funky skit?

Yeah, G, we're taxing it

We roam from the Bronx

And then we jet from Queens

And then we talk in Long Island
Where the family seems

If you get big for your pride

We'll take the heart of your block

You get snatched for what you get if you half-step, hops

G-Allah, Earl Wynne, Kid Cush, Shock G
My brother Jean

My man Dave

Fly Jazz and OG
The 85s is the gods, peace for eternity

A tribe? Knowledge-Ciper, THAT'S A FAMILY!

Wussup wit' the love, wussup wit' the love?

Now, men want racism, black folks in prison, me bar
What's goin' on with the luh-uh-ove?
Boo-ya-kaw is the sound, brothers goin' down in the worst way
I got my son a gun for his birthday

Now we've had enough, everybody wants to be tough
But I give the props to brothers on my level instead of tryin' to be above
Cause I see nothin' feminine about givin' your brother some love

Look deeply in each other's eyes (look in each other eyes): you know we are the ones (know we are the ones)
Racism is a cloud (racism is a cloud) that blocks us from the sun (that blocks us from the sun)
One brother speaks in African (one brother speaks in African), one sings Jamaican songs (one sing Jamaican song)
Both of them are black men (both of em are black men), but they still can't get along (they still can't get along)

Yo, I know this brother named Tony, he beat up his own mom, man (Nah, man).  Straight up.  Him and his two brothers, they all live in the same house with his mom, right.  (Right).  They all in their twenties
She the only one working.  Anyway, one night she needed to get some sleep, she told him to turn his music down, and he just straight flipped l on her, slapped her all up against the wall, cursed her out

Mommy and Daddy they got married, they make love every night
But Momma's gettin' tired, and Poppa is the pipe
At night I see 'em kissin' wishin' I got the props that Pops, I mean the rocks, got
I hope she hugs me, guess she never dug me
I figure still I hustle, tussled with the fool at school
The one that Momma sold my sneakers, thought he says he's freakin' her
Had to doubt until I caught 'em, then I fought him, then she slapped me
Hollered at me talkin' 'bout I messed up her ten dollars

God damn!  Drug dealers dealin' to the kiddies
Livin' in the city ain't no pity on the itty-bitty
We try to cry, but still they all die
I try to speak to the youth, and the truth is they all high
What can I say but watch your back, youngster
As I sit and wonder, my other brother's steadily goin' under
It's like a curse, and it hurts cause it's worse
Momma's crazy cause her baby's in a hearse
Wussup wit' the love?

Yo, my homey was joggin in this upper-class white neighborhood, he had his headphones on, right, you know, just joggin'
This old lady called the police.  Just cause he was black, they stomped my homey
He couldn't hear 'em though cause he had his headphones on.  They ain't chase him, they didn't shine their lights on him.  They just shot him
(dead!)

This land once owned by Indians, who then would learn to burn
A tragedy, because from them there was so much to learn
You will find the key to life is checkin' for you friends
Everything's gonna be alright
I got to let you know that I'm in love with you
(Dope fiends sellin' their babies)
I'm so in love with you
(I know man, you can't even say 'what's up' to a brother no more)
People, I'm in love with you
(Fool talkin' about 'what's up', fool don't know me man)
Yes I'm in love with you
(I put one in him!  Hey, yo, you got your thang?)
(Yeah, man, I'm strapped)

It blows my mind to see (it blows my mind) so many people sufferin' (so many people)
It blows my mind to see so many people down (Everybody's down)
And I just can't understand, why there must be such fightin'
(Everybody's actin' crazy)
It blows my mind to see the pain that's all around

Shake and bake
Once again we're taking over
The d-flow pimp rovers
The one who bent your summer lover over
The cool that's never sober
But never hung over
With me the Rapanova
The big noser
Poking around under your girlfriend's clothes
That's where the Humpty nose goes when the doors close
I never love her slow though
I flow like I'm on No-Doz
You don't belive me but your ho knows
A fly knocker when she sees one
I'm the one humping
Pumping out the premium
Super octane fat crack big kilos
Listen how the d flows
Rarrr rarrr like a dungeon dragon nigga aaaaaghhh
Like Monster Zero
Nah I'm just bugging y'all Buster is my hero
I clowned anyway, It's me though, yo
We got flavor and we like to flex it (ungh)

A second to reckon and shake and bake, come on
Shake and bake, etc
Don't try to get away cuz baby this is it (it)
My freaky deaky membership is legit
I got a sex club gold card veteran certificate (what?)
You try to run I'll put my nose on your clit
Cuz I'm a master of the French kiss (kiss)
Nasty hoes know this (what?)
I'm a nut bust specialist (ungh)
A thriller of the lady killer whether chocolate or vanilla (bitch)
The butt filler
The nut spiller
I got a PhD in nasty
And baby when you walk past me
I'm gonna smell the flavor of that ass, G 
Smells like a freak to me
Cuz I'm a hardcore triple X rater
Ho fader
Sick new position creator
The mayor
The double up bubble butt slayer (ah ha)
Rock fat brown pipe layer
The joker
The butt poker
The ass cheek checker
The throat choking tight cooch stretcher
The bust a nut double decker booty gettin heckler
The kinky ho closet freak sphincter muscle wrecker
You say you want to blow me
Yo baby you really don't know me
Cuz like a DJ's hand on the crossfader
The Humpty nose up in your booty shake-and-bakes like a vibrator
Shake and bake, etc
Your beats are tired, your rhyming is fake
You keep on looping up them same old done breaks
Your buck teeth hang out of your face like a rake

One, two
Buckle my shoe
Scooby-Doo
Humpty what you gonna do?
Lick lick, let me lick
Smell, let me smell the flavor
And taste the behavior
The way you
Been kicking it while the Humpster was lamping
Fishing and camping
Out renting boats in the Hamptons
Eating good, working out, and giving charity
Working on my vocal cord clarity
Hell, no, I can't front, I been at the crib G-ing
Slapping poontang trying to be the mack pappy
40-dog and pina colada pudding
Making my rounds to keep the Humpty girls happy
If you missed me I was laying in the cut
Wrecking big butts
And scratching my knees
Cuz my homegirl's cat got fleas
That's how it goes
The beat flow-flows
Yo peep the new color of my nose
Representing how we been living
That's how it is
I'm not the biz
But if I was to pick a boogah
It'd be a big fat gooey gold plated loogie
But I was born a yankee so I use my hanky
The way I wear my clothes freaks the hoes cuz I'm lanky
Speaking of hankies, I like hanky-panky
Especially when the hanky-panky's 
spanky
Of course ain't gonna be too much 
spanking
Cuz then my duty would be to give the booty a spanking
I like biscuits and grits on the sausage
And so you know it's me, I wrote some nonsense
Hova glova nivlan blizman glaze niull
The return of the crazy one (you think I ain't?)
Psycho alpha, that means the crazy one
Gold nose lazy one
Skill to kill
I never worked I never will
I'm the 
original high yellow rich rigger bum
Hookers getting mad cuz they can't make me come
Around their way
Addicted to the way that I play
I like to chew bubblegum
Make them laugh when I'm loving them
I blew a bubble and some Bubble-Yum
Got caught up in the booty
I thought it was the end of her
Gabriella needed an enema
So I put away the broom
And we broke out the vacuum
Sort of like spring cleaning
Humpty Hump's leaning
Into the groove from the fat beat
The pimp slap beat
The yo my head is nodding cuz I'm hooked like crack beat
Hiva-humping
Rip-riva-rumping
Biva-biva-butt-pumping
Rump-riva-rump-pumping
And it just ain't releasing me
The beat's obesity
So fat that it makes me shout
Ah ha this beat's got gout
Not from the worms, from the pork
That you eat with a fork
But it weighs about a ton when it plays
Back to the honeys
The play-booty-bunnies
You know what's real funny to me
When they get up for the downstroke
The look on their face when they almost choke
On the lean butter bean brown hamhock
I got the joke in the chamber and the gun's cocked
It's time to pull out my funny bone and get ready for the fun
The return of the crazy one
Five, six
Humpty's sick
Seven, eight
Just too late

Do Ya Like it Dirty?,The Body-Hat Syndrome,1993,"If you're into S & M, baby, you can hurt me
If you like going down, do me like a Slurpee
Do you like it dirty? Baby, come and serve me

Do you like it dirty?!
Some like it dirty and some like it clean

Don't throw me no soap
Cause it would just defeat me
Some like it dirty like this beat, see
Rapping off-kilter
Sometimes I hit the cigarette without no filter
I like it when it's lag-time
Let-my-pants-sag time
Let go and let my drawers show
And let them get so low
That I can let my funk fling out
I'm talking about when the nuns get naughty
When father hits the forty
(Shhh, now let's not get too sporty, son)
When the collard green juice gets the bread wet
When you're up so close that you can smell the sweat
Off a black, funky Tennessee butt
Like a bite into a salty Tampa Bay boiled peanut
(I hit a jet black ass in the back seat of a Nova)
Oh yeah? Well a hoe five-oh pulled me over
I swear, doing about a buck thirty
Instead of jail she took home and got flirty
The deal was a $1000 fine and a ticket:
""Or you can stick it.""
""You're pretty but I haven't had a shower today""
She said ""Come here, it's better that way
Tie me up and do anything you want
But don't hurt me""
So I..


A lot of people like rice better when it's brown
Like having sex on the ground
Instead of in a bed, instead of receiving head
A lot of people like going down
I side-stepped the line for a fresh cut
And instead, I keep my nappy curls in my head
I like to hear brothers spit game using dirty words
I like things colourfully stated
Everyday speech sounds dated
I like the freaks in the jeans
When the booty part's faded
Like my homegirl Rita
I used to chill on her sofa with my feet up
By the heater with my toes getting toasted
One day she came naked out the kitchen
With a bag full of groceries
She said ""Like a blunt I want to toake you
And with this bottle of wine I'm going to soak you
May I Cherry-Banana Float you?""
I said ""Is this a joke, boo?""
She said ""I love you, my baby
And I wouldn't do nothing that would hurt you""
She took my clothes off
Started pulling food out the bag
And said ""Yo, I'm 'bout to work you""
Yeah, I let her get the best of me
She was sitting next to me
Then baby started sexing me
Poked me with the peanut butter
Rubbed me with the jelly
She spread cottage cheese on my belly!
I said ""Woah, baby, what you got in mind?""
She said ""Relax""
Popped the top on a bottle of wine
Then she poured the wine down my back
It prickled and tickled when it reached my crack
I said ""Oooh, I feel real freaky, my butt's real squeaky!""
She said ""Cool"" and then proceeded to eat me
Ate me up till my body was squeaky clean
Must have been a sex fiend
Like the freaks in the magazines
Poked out her lips, made her mouth like a funnel
Spun a brother round, went down on the tunnel
I said ""Oh! There she goes""
She got live and let the tongue slide
On the black hole
And, yo, this was it
Baby was on some freshfruitfreakyfoodshit!
Honey on the side, jelly on the head
Peanut butter on the bedspread
Baby said ""Do you like it dirty?!""

Do you like it dirty? Hoe, you don't deserve me
Do you like it dirty? I fucked a hoe in Berkeley",https://genius.com/Digital-underground-do-ya-like-it-dirty-lyrics

But I got no love for anybody trying to keep me down
I got a lot of love for all the ones who got my back
But not the monkey that's riding on it
They ride to hear a brother say 'shaggalackfragganack'
You know what I mean ... nothing
But like an 
FOI I can't tell a lie
I get too much juice when you turn me loose
And like fruit from a tree's got vitamin C
I'm from the Darkside and I'm fortified
I got the kind of vitamins to creep beneath your skin
That's why you're so afraid to let me in
I'll take you to a whole 'nother level
You know I got the Main Ingredient
So just keep on fronting
Gotta, gotta, gotta keep on fronting - keep on, keep on
Keep on running your mouth and pumping the lies
So I'm punking you out
Invest in all the young, funky minds of today
Infesting all the young, funky minds with the FADES:
Falsely Acquired Diluted Education Syndrome
That's why I need a Bodyhat
To block all the ooey-gooey brainwashed nuts with the bag
Make them drip back up the shaft of the system
Uh-huh, I just dissed them

You make me out to be the devil
Afraid that I'm a take you to a whole 'nother level
You know that I'm a creep beneath your skin


Well, what do we have here
Sheer bliss, Saafir hears this so
We getting our grind on
Put a little tuning and your grooming
They want us to zoomer-zoom, we already zooming
Putting on my mask, gotta think fast
I'm a light sleeper so I wake last
I'm drinking out the glass but the water ain't pure
And they wonder why I don't want to do you
First of all, you're scandalous
And I'm too real so you can't handle this
Then you'll throw a fit and tell me I ain't shit
Go fatten up your lips
Or better yet go put some rhythm in your hips
I'll flip, never will I slip
On a front took her bust up
So now what? I'll tell you what:
Why don't you get a clue from within, mark
Otherwise I'm gonna creep beneath your skin


A wing-ding ding-a-ling, listen to me sing
I like chicken wings
All living things get treated like a brother
Cause I'm a planet Earth lover
And I'm surviving, I keep striving
Alive in my blood's the God from up above-uh
I gain strength from my mother
I'm potent cause soul is what I'm toting
Style runs deep in my family tree
Yeah, that's me
See, it's gonna feel good when I run right through you
So let me do you
Open up and take a bite of me, chew me up
Try to swallow my blackness. Go on, taste it
Face it, it's fact that you're attracted to my style
But still you lie to me
You see, being afraid is the same as being shallow
So why follow the masses?
We're in the Nineties
Try to release your mind and be deep

Jerkit Circus,The Body-Hat Syndrome,1993,"Well ain't but two kind
Them that do and them that do
Yo
They got tigers, lions, and monkeys
But I give my most attention to my donkey
Pay no mind to the sign that said: don't feed it
Even hold it when it's time to get funky
Always tired after two rounds of action
But you got to bust three like Paxon
So you go off and you join the Jerkit Circus
Work it like you knock a bag, that's satisfaction
So let's talk about this
And that
I'm a freaky deak player but I'm scared that it might be wack (wack)
It might hurt my sack (sack)
And if it ain't cool then I'm not gonna kiss that cat (cat)
Cuz I don't know where it's been at
Sometimes it ain't cool even when you wear a hat
But yo I hit it anyway (unngh)
Cuz a diesel butt female wanted to play
And three days later got an itch
And now I really wanna kill that (HO!)
Who did it
I shouldn't have been with it
I really shouldn't have hit it (did it)
But I slipped and I admit it ('mit it)
I did it (hit it)
But it didn't have to be done
Next time I'm gonna run run run to the
Jerkit Circus
Lay it in your palm and you don't need a condom
Jerkit Circus
Gonna get mine and have a nutty nutty time at the
Jerkit Circus
Fly girl kinkies work those pinkies at the
Jerkit Circus baby
Hey yo it's time to milk the cow
Mary goes up and Mary goes down
Mary goes Mary goes round and round
She rolled on a horse that was wearing a hat
POP went the ball sack
Mary goes up and Mary goes down
Mary goes Mary goes round and round
But this time the horse wasn't wearing no hat
DEAD went the ball sack
How did you get strong when she looked at you
(And that's how she hooked at you)
Sitting in the back when you knew you wasn't strapped
And that's how the microwave cooked you
You ROCKED and SHOCKED it
Knocked up the booty real good when you knew you should have
STOPPED and BLOCKED it
With a hat
I stay strapped cuz I'm smarter than that
So let's work
Let's work this
And let's go to the circus
Tonight he's gonna rock it with a whole new plan
He's got a date with his left hand
At the
Jerkit Circus
Lay it in your palm and you don't need a condom
Jerkit Circus
Gonna get mine and have a nutty nutty time at the
Jerkit Circus
Fly girl swingers let me use a finger at the
Jerkit Circus
No more sticking time that we choke that chicken
Mary goes up and Mary goes down
Mary goes Mary goes round and round
She rolled on a horse that was wearing a hat
POP went the ball sack
Called your girl
Tried to get your rocks off
Made you wait
Your hard rock got soft (aakh!)
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
I don't know I wish I knew a better way
Cuz back in the day
You step to a lot a girls and they say back off a lot
You get mad wanting tail, jack off a lot
But hey it's not such a bad idea considering
Don't have to waste a lot a time trying to get her in
The mood
AND YOU NEED NO PROTECTION
Word to the dick what else it's got is no affection
The sex was great and you didn't have to ball her
And hear her nagging asking you if you was gonna call her
So now I'm going out like a strangler
Get a grip and choke your fadangler
To the girls that use sex to try to work us:
Took my destiny into my own hand
And joined the
Jerkit Circus
Lay it in your palm and you don't need a condom
Jerkit Circus
Yeah gonna get mine and have a nutty nutty time at the
Jerkit Circus

Bran Nu Swetta,The Body-Hat Syndrome,1993,"It's not the weather, to wear no sweater..

Sometimes she changed like the weather
But no one loved me better
I'll never ever forget her
My brand new sweater
Nobody got her wetter
She told me in her letter
I bought her food and fed her
My brand new sweater
[Shock-G}
Baby said, ""Ooh baby shoo-be-dooh
Let's hook up again cause the loving is cool""
I said ""Yo, I gotta go, I got a show""
She said ""I know, after the show let me cook for you
If you're hungry, you never know
You might need help with your laundry
Don't hesitate to call upon me
Before you go, would you meet my mother
She lives right around the corner
It's not a bother, meet my mother!""
I said ""Woah, woah, woah, baby slow it down
I said I gotta go, I ain't say I'm leaving town
I got your number, stop tripping
Why're you flipping? Had a great time
Let me get my jacket, I'm dipping.""
Hate, hate, hate the way I felt like I dissed her
""Wait, wait, wait"" cried the pretty, young sister
She said, ""Shock, while I got this chance
I've got let you know that if you rip your pants
I'll beee there, to sew the hole for your butt
Want a nut? Call me up, I'll pick you up in my jetta
No one's got me wetter
Shock, I never got freaked better!""
She said ""Here, yo, it's all in my letter""
See, I just met baby last night
We g'd
While I was sleeping she was up
Creeping around writing letters to me
Man, I hate somebody all up in my face when I'm sleep
But I ain't sweating it
""Look, I'll hook-up with you next week""
She said ""Wait, let me walk you to the street, baby
Sweet thang, don't forget to ready my letter!""
Somebody please help me:
I'm stuck wearing a sweater
It upsets meee, when she sweats me..

Pee Wee? He went down to Montgomery Wards
Howzabouta Money-B? He went down to K-Mart
Yo, Humpty! I challenge you to a game of dominoes
A game of dominoooess

I've been sporting sweaters ever since I was a child
But nowadays sweaters kind of cramp my style
Cause up around the collar they be getting me hot
Believe it or not, my sweater used to the shot
The freak of my nature, my sweet, stick thing
But like George of the Jungle she had trouble with the swing

Yeah, brah, she couldn't hack it
Started cock-blocking like a full metal jacket
Fingers did the walking, calling, tying up my phone
Boo had me under heavy surveillance at my home
Word to Mac Mone, suffocated my bone
Pulling on my hoodie in a nagging little tone
Where you going? Where you been? Who's Kim? Who's Felicia?
But I don't see no ring, I never met the preacher
I got to play you out, I mean the loving was phat
But you're a sweater, riding so heavy on my back

She wore a lot of leather
Baby, drove a jetta
I never used to sweat her
Yeah, but that upset her
No-one got her wetter
She told me in her letter
I'll never ever forget her
My brand new sweater

I got a brand new sweater
But I didn't get it from Mervyn's
Her friends be pulling wool but
My syringe pulls bull from the lens
Even then, I'll send you back for a refund
Plus she sport a good hat-terin (?)
That'd have been the end
If I let the sweater lay upon my skin
Great Scott, time for a rebate sale
We make mail, more than you think
As long as they're strong
And the cotton don't shrink
We can spend doe on a jane doe
Cause ho got to have clothes, so
I buy the thread and let them weave
Leave it alone if you don't want to get worn out
I've got legions of sweaters for the seasons
I got blue when I'm sad, red when I'm mad
Pink cause I'm ticklish
When I'm being laid in green
When I'm getting paid
I don't have a problem if you wanna jock me
See cause, gs is what you're gonna clock me
Go ahead, knock me if you think I'm not shit
But when it comes to sweaters?
Saafir's a perfect fit

She was real go-getter
Her cheese smelt like cheddar
She let me use the credit
Yeah, but just forget it
She cried when I upset her
I should've treated her better
Maybe one day I'll go back and get my sweater",https://genius.com/Digital-underground-bran-nu-swetta-lyrics
Wheee!,The Body-Hat Syndrome,1993,"Ridin' in a drop top 'Vette doing ninety
Front seat fresh ho, no five, oh, behind me
I know it is a fat house party, so yo bust the def left
Rich baby's parents went away for the weekend
Oh, there's plenty of freaks left
And there's gonna be freakin', the house party's peakin'
So I'm sneakin' upstairs with a fresh stunt
Grabbed the rump, pushed the stunt in the closet
Sparked the blunt, humped the rump
Puffed the blunt, bust a nut, aah ooh wee
Boss says, it's cool to come to work when you can make it
Halle Berry lyin' in your bed butt-stankin' naked
The deck is on me, here's some more condoms I think I wanna gee
She said, my friend, it makes me wanna sing me, me, me, me, me
Boss says, it's cool to come to work when you can make it
Halle Berry sittin', in your bed butt-stankin' naked

That's the way I feel, you wanna know the scoop?
When you're getting up, you're on your way to school
And then you find out, that it's a holiday
Tank is on full, the sun is in the sky
So you drop the top, it's time get out
Kind of how it is when you kick eight bars
And not rhyme once and still sound fly
Wheee! Peekin' at the Smith girl, sneakin' out the back door
Leapin' in the neighbor's pool naked
Story uhm, ahh, err, I scream, I
Join in skinny dip swimming, shakin' when the wind blows

Whoopsy daisy, as she busts my eyes close
Excuse the pitch if I slip and my rhyme's slow

I'm sittin' underground but my head is to the ceiling
Ooh, I got a freak on the way
She wants to come I'mma make her stay
Wheee! 'Cause the girl love's to gee
Especially when it comes to Clee
And when I bust a nut I'll say, whee, hee hee
Um, yeah, Smooth's havin' fun 'cause he's got his flow on
Call me a freak jack-in-the-box, yeah, I'll go on
A tight skirt and a tail makin' crazy mail
In living color, gumbo from my mother
Roller coaster, toast, jam
Martin Lawrence skins when I slam
Spill a fat drink like a gobstopper
When you see me in a club, you know I'll holla
In comes three times when I nut
Put my dick in her butt, walked on her cunt
I sneeze, made her jump, let me tell it
Put my finger in her ass, let her smell it
Close the door, pretend I'm takin' a shit
But I really got my toes pointed, hand on my dick
I'm sick, I got the flu, but I'll still kiss you till you smell like
Doodoo, my ass is soggy
My drawers are wet, they're kinda foggy
I can't see a thing, I feel like a big fat
Bing, bong, ding, dong, I got camel humps on my back
I got bald head butt corduroy calluses all on my hand
I smell like, uh, the Bee Gees band
Damn, that shit was wack
I'm snugglin' in the arms of a fresh stunt
Bosoms in my grill, peepin' Benny Hill with a fat blunt
John Madden, football, a fat hit off the beadie
Doggystyle behind the bed and still can see the TV
Silly cartoons is getting watched like Juju
(Si, inspector)
I think I see the blootch
Boom, my mistake, it was 'de boom'
Bust in on my man in the next room
Wheee! Fuck you, Johnny
The spoon-fed Apple Jacks in bed room
Fresh freak with the ice cubes and a lot of headroom 
A dope ho strip show with all the girls we know
I won't kiss the feet if the girlie's got cheese toes
Clee won't leave me alone, I'm five gees, gone

Maybe cause the chick is brainwashed

Who'd a thought you need hats for your eyes

 around my eyes when I'm rhyming
The government says you've got to have a glow
And I swing a tail like Haley's Comet
No comment? I didn't think so
I thought flow and there it was

It's just a freestills, meanwills keep the vills kills in
Sweat drills in, girlies in the wheels eatin chills and
You say you're ready to go? Oh no
You gotta wait for the Nose to go!

Don't wanna throw a hot booty seven and lose
So what is the move to keep livin?
Swimmin in the big balloon, I don't think so
I ran a body-hat option on the ho

She said lately it just ain't been the same
So would you kinda just rub me down?

Cause the onion was big and round

What a wonder ho 
Why she wanna ho?
What a wonderful, what a wonder ho
Why she wanna ho? (I'll tell you why)
What a wonderful way to go out, ho

I know a girl named Holly, I'm tellin she's sinkin
Thinkin about sellin that body
Contemplatin rollin up the stroll like a trolley
Wants fast money like Three-Card Molly
Oh look now, here comes Holly
Look at that smile, look at that body
Look at those eyes, Holly's real fly
Holly's real smart, Holly's real pretty
Holly got flavour but she's got no pride
Holly wants to hide in the corner of the city
Holly ain't sick, Holly ain't crazy
Ain't got it bad, the ho's just lazy
Now she's lookin into hookin
Quick money on her back so the ho can live fat
Holly thinks that's where it's at
But curiosity is gonna kill that cat
Born with a gift, think she'll ever use it?
Hell no, cause Holly wants to ho

If that ho don't stop, it that ho don't stop

Holly likes to ho and use dildoes as long as my bills grow
I'm not trippin, she be dippin in wallets, all it's
Gonna get is me rich, I tried to dis the bitch
But she slits her wrists every time, she said:
'I wanna grind and make scratch with my snatch'
Cool, latch onto my belt buckle
One time she came short all she felt were the knuckles
Beating her down I saw her on Geraldo
After the show MAD calls for the ho
You can save all the chit-chatter and all the bitchin
By this time next year you'll be fuckin politicians
Every one in a while I catch her home she be callin
Bawlin, but I'm only sensitive when I bust a nut
After I bless you with the dick you've got to cut
And make my bucks, giddy-up giddy-up, giddy-up!

In comes the cream from under the spleen
So I scream, I dream (what a nut), ooohwee

Has it been coloured
By the way you've been treated
In a situation that comes to mind
I hope it ain't, and make sure that the paint
That you use to paint me with has got funk in it

"Know Me, Feel Me",The Lost Files,1999,"You know how to dodio, put me in your video
Can't be your hoe-deo, put me in your video (x2)
You got a natural thing for that swing
If everything is lovey-dovey when we gonna get together? (x4)

You could see the fear in her eyes on the night she arrived
Ugly was the atmosphere, terror was the vibe
I was a fool cause I really thought I owned her
Every night I boned her, I even loaned her
Out like a hat, to the others
She got spanked if she acted up as if I was her mother

And when she tried to run away I put the dogs on her
Kept her locked down from the fall to the summer

Eventually I had to let her go cause people said
I'm evil and they started coming down on me
But she never made it out the doe, she said
'Hoeing's all I know and I'm cut off from my family
There's nowhere I can go and you owe me
But I'll forgive you if you start fresh and you show me
That you're worthy of my love and if you can't love a whore
Then teach me how to be the type of woman you adore'

I wasn't really down but I said 'Deal'
Just to shut her up and to hide what I feel
But the eyes never lie, she read right through me
And what she said next got to me:

Are you ever gonna know me, love me
Feel me, ever gonna give it a try?
Maybe I'm not what you're used to
But it's cool cause I'm pretty inside

So we're both still living in the same crib
But I hardly ever see her cause I'm never there
I can't face all the bad things I did
So I hide and I lie and deny that I care
Reckless, ruthless, evil like a devil
And now she wanna take me to that real level
I gave her nothing but stress and strain

But she believes in me and says that people can change
You know I do not understand how she still stands by me
On the down low I think she's fly, see
But I front on account of the way that I acted

I'm paranoid that she might get me back and
I couldn't be the fat, greedy rat that I've been
I had the power living in sin
But I still can't get her words out of my head
She messed me up with the way she said:


Are you ever going to understand
I do not have a history of showing people love
Just because I put you on the TV
Doesn't mean I'm looking out for you or ya moms
I dogged you! I dogged you, you don't care!
A slave to the rhythm, a fiend for abuse
You got your act together, things are looking better
BUT YOU'LL ALWAYS BE A ROACH TO THEM!

She said 'I'd like to thank ya cause you put me in your video
Take me all alone somewhere so no one else can see me hoe
Then you'll know that I'm wide o', your flow's got the power over me
Are you ever gonna know me, love me
Feel me, ever gonna give it a try?
The key is the 'I', is the 'she', is the 'we'
And the I is he
You got a natural thing for that swing
If everything is lovey-dovey when we gonna get together? (x4)

Red magic satin playing near, too

Rainbows and?waterfalls run through my mind
In the garden, I see
West purple shower, bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins dressed in green (Dressed in green)
Pretty music, I hear
So happy and loud
Blue flowers echo from the cherry cloud
Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh
If you try to ask, ""Is it cool? Is it cool?”
And if you arrive and don't see me
That’s cause I'm gonna be with my baby though

Yeah, and I am free
I’m flying in her arms
Over the sea

Stained window, yellow candy screen
See speakers of kite
With velvet roses diggin' freedom flight
A present from you

The music plays
And I sit in for a few

Mind Bubble,The Lost Files,1999,"You blew my mind
I mean you came out of nowhere
And you blew my mind

You blew?up?my mind like?a bubble
From day one I knew?you was trouble

Another brother given birth
Welcome to the other Earth
In?honesty?you?ain’t no joke?you down
But I?was first, see, I see you lookin’
You had your eyes on the prize
But you’se a petty crime, tryna shine like a felony
Wasn’t quite sure what you had
But glad cause you knew you had something
And was coming up tenaciously
But I’m no sucka, I stepped aside graciously
And let the young flower blossom
The game came full circle
Now the student has become the teacher
Stayin’ humble but sometimes is hard to reach ya
You earned everything it brought ya
And I learned from you, bruh
(Everything)

You blew up my mind like a bubble
From day one I knew you was trouble
I schooled ya, I brought you up
I turned you on and then
I turned you out and you was born again
I thought I hit my limit but you took me higher
You flipped me over like clothes in the dryer
I flipped you like a pancake
I let you peep
I pulled your cap back when you was asleep

Back when you was snoring
And straight ignoring life
I breathed air on your flame
Spit kerosene game on your fire
You was hungry, you was filled with desire
Eager to be seen
A pool table green like a Christmas tree
But you was lucky like an 8 ball
You never let me fall
If I did you picked me up
It’s funny how you never really knew how much you had my back
But you did
You never really knew that I was grateful
But I am, so blam
Here it is back
Consider yourself strapped
Use me, cause I’m a bullet in your Uzi

You blew up my mind like a bubble
From day one I knew you was trouble
You schooled me, you brought me up
You turned me on and then
You turned me out and I was born again
I thought I hit my limit but you took me higher
You flipped me over like clothes in a dryer
You flipped me like a pancake
You let me peep
You pulled my cap back when I was asleep

I laid it down for ya
I molded ya
I showed ya, I told ya
I laid it down for ya
I molded ya
I showed ya, I told ya

You blew up my mind like a bubble
From day one I knew you was trouble
You pulled me up
You dropped game on me
You pulled my coat and fed food to my brain homie
Thought I hit my limit but you took me higher
You flipped me over like clothes in the dryer
You flipped me like a pancake
You let me peep
You pulled my cat back when I was asleep
But yo, you came to me
And opened up my eyes so I can see
No, I really thought I hit my limit but you took me higher
You flipped me over like clothes in the dryer
You flipped my like a pancake
You flipped my like a pancake",https://genius.com/Digital-underground-mind-bubble-lyrics
Same Song,This is an E.P. Release,1990,"Been all around the world
Been all around the world
All around the world same song
All, all around the world same song
(Yo, we've been all around the world)
All around the world same song
All, all around the world same song

I came for the party to get naughty, get my rocks on
Eat popcorn
, watch you move your body to the pop song
That I'm singin', dinga-lingin', funky beats ringin'
Everybody's swingin' in the place
As I kick the J-A-Z-Z-Y style
R&B mixin' it with the Hip Hop swing beat
Champagne in my hand, it won't be long 'til I'm gone
It's just the same old song

It's just a freestyle, meanwhile, we keep the beat kickin'
Sweat drippin', girlies in the limo eatin' chicken
Oops, don't get the grease on your pantyhose
I love ya Rover, move over, I gotta blow my nose
Sneezin', but still I'm pleasin' to all the slimmies
Pull out my Jimmy, time to get busy with a Jenny
If it's good and plenty, don't you know
There I go, there I go, there I go
But I don't go nowhere without my Jim hat (Jim hat)
When I'm rappin', and if she's clappin'
Then I'm strappin' 'cause I'm smarter than that
Then girlie maybe we can get along
Cutie after cutie, it's just the same old song

All around the world same song
(It's the same old song y'all)
All, all around the world same song
(Uh, it's just the same old song)
All around the world same song
(It's the same song)
All, all around the world same song

Money B, the freaky deaky, the squeaky meaky up and down
Well as a matter of fact, I'll be right back, I gotta take a leaky
So while I'm drainin', entertainin', but I got fame
And the bases I touch, too much for me to try to be namin'
Ayo, you saw me on cable and grinned
I busted in and I was Gone With The Wind
Like Clark Gable, back in Oakland it's the same old song
For Sporty Shorty, same freckles and hat
Drinkin' the same 40's

Hypothetical, political, lyrical, Miracle Whip
Just like butter, my rhymes are legit
'Cause I'm a Humpty. not Humpty Dumpty, but Humpty Hump
Here a Hump, there a Hump, everywhere a Humpty Hump

Ah, shut up and just listen
Not dissin', don't get me wrong
But to me it's just the same old song
So just watch, 'cause my name is Shock, I like to rock
And you can't stop this
2Pac, go ahead and rock this

Now I clown around when I hang around with the Underground
Girls who used to frown, say ""I'm down"" when I come around
Gas me and when they pass me they used to diss me
Harass me, but now they ask me if they can kiss me
Get some fame, people change, wanna live their life high
Same song, can't go wrong, if I play the nice guy
(Claimin' fame, must have changed, now that we became strong)
I remain still the same (why, Tu'?) 'cause it's the same song

All around the world same song
(It's the same old song y'all)
All, all around the world same song
(Ya know, ya know, check heads, ya know)
All around the world same song
(Ya don't stop; it's the same song)
All, all around the world same song
(Hibby-dibby, ya don't quit)
All around the world same song
(Ah yeah, Humpty Hump in the house y'all)
All, all around the world same song
(You know what? It's the same old song)

Uhh, kick it y'all
Ahh yeah

Heheheheheh
Yo Hump, gonna do a lil somethin like this
Lots of little knots that need to be tied
A pair of knuckleheads walkin side by side
Down the altar, you say to yourself, ""I will not falter""
But you're thinkin it -- how did I get myself in this predicament?
Saw the def cutie that made your heart sing
You hop to the shop to get a ring (a big diamond)
You hop to the shop to buy a ring (a BIG DIAMOND!)
You hopped to the shop and got a ring...
Felt left out cause all your friends are hooked
But now you're at the altar, your goose is cooked
You say a prayer, ""Lord please give me strength to make it through""
Opened up your nervous mouth, slipped and said, ""I do""
I don't, IdoIdoIdo, I don't I don't, IdoIdo, I don't, I don't
Look you do son, now hurry up and kiss the brizide
Peace said the father, cause now the knot is tied
 Tie the knot, tie tie the knot
 Yeah it's time to make the move
 Tiffi tiffi tie the knot
 Uhh
 Tie the knot, tie tie the knot
 Yo it's time to make the move
 Tiffi tiffi tie the knot

Yeahhh, well we're back with another one
Comin hard and got suckers on the run
You say, ""You guys are known for havin' fun""
Yeah well we'll do what has to be done for us to be number one
And you ain't never heard nuthin this funky son
You ain't never heard nuthin this funky ever, it's too clever
Rhyme goes through your mind like a guillotine severs
The head, my friend
And you will never hear nobody rap like this again

You ain't heard nuttin this funky brother, it's like no other
You feel the bass bouncin off the walls like rub-bah
The real McCoy this ain't no toy or another
How do we do it?  (Shock G: Yo go ask your mother)
The freak needers, the beat leaders
Let me tell you somethin, you ain't heard nuttin this funky Peter
So listen up as we begin
Aiyyo Fuze rub the record in
 cause you ain't heard nuttin this funky (4X)

The definition of a rhyme breeder, beat needer
We're the cold party heaters, comin through the woofers and the tweeters
Funky dope MC leaders
Rhyme hungry hip-hop listener feeders

The definition of a rhyme sayer, beat layer
Mothersucker perpetrator slayer
Layin down the law like the Mayor
You're out of luck, Hucklebuck, I'll suck you up like a Now or Later
You say that you're a trooper, then I'm Darth Vader
You're a Cowboy, then I'm a Raider

You can't compete cause you're incomplete and need to be completed
You're style is weak you're obsolete and need to be deleted
Short on the things that you needed
So what you got a top ten song, cause you cheated

If you worked in a kitchen, it'd be sweeter
From the rappin that I hear, you'd make a better egg beater
A teeter totter, or should I say, totter teeter
You're through, you're a quart and we're liters
We got the style you admire, the rhymes you desire
Well you ain't heard nuttin this slick you trick
Cause you're a flick from a Bic and we're a bonfire
 cause you ain't heard nuttin this funky (4X)
*some scratching by DJ Fuze*

Cause I roll up fast, like a cheetah, get out the two-seater
Walk up on a girl named Anita, or Rita
Ask her for change to put money in the meter
Didn't really need it just a smooth way to meet her
Or a fly way to treat her
She said, ""I'm hungry"" so I took her out to feed her
She was a pocket feeder chicken, fajita pita eater
I said, ""Yo, eat how ya like"" then took her home and G'd her

The definition of a funky rhyme master
Clevely put together but not necessarily sayin it faster
Ya see, that style isn't hard at all
The object of the game is to have a ball y'all
And to see who can come the funkiest
Lot of MC's think it's just a speed contest
They wanna brag about the neighborhood, oh you wanna boast?
We come from different cities and we're coast to coast ya see
But right now we're based in Oakland (Odis: Oakland)
Everywhere we go we leave the microphone smokin
Yo bro I'm not jokin
Leave MC's standin still with their mouths hangin open
Walk offstage and leave the next act scratchin his head like a monkey (Odis: word!)
Cause you ain't heard nuttin this funky
    Cause you ain't heard nuttin this funky (2X)
 Leave a sucker standin still confused
Cause he never heard nuttin this funky
   You ain't heard nuttin this funky
  Ahh yeah
    Why don't you tell em Hump
   Cause you ain't heard nuttin this funky
  Whassup y'all, Humpty Hump in the house
   Cause you ain't HEARD nuttin this funky
    Yeah
  You know what?
   You ain't heard nuttin this funky
  Let me bust a rhyme, c'mon
    Get in

You ain't heard nuttin this funky son, we're number one
Humpty Hump in the house, gonna show you how it's done
With professional rhymes, I gotta question for your mind
Have you ever heard anything this funky son?
(Yeah man, I was out on the street
These guys came on by in this, tch, car man playin some beat...)
You ain't heard nuttin this funky nigga, how ya figure?
My mouth's on the mic like a finger on a trigger nigga
And when I squeeze I'mma getcha
You never heard nuthin this funky now didja!
And if you're large, we're bigger
You bust a weak ass rhyme and then expect me to dig ya
Humpty Hump's in the house with the locals
Yo Schmoove kick the vocals

Arguin’ on the Funk,This is an E.P. Release,1990,"S-H-I-N-I-N on the funk
And listen to the MCs rhyming on the funk
We solemnly swear; to never bust a style that's bunk
So listen to the way that we're rhyming on the funk

Yeah! Yo, shock, it's a funky groove, man, it's kind of funky

You think so? I appreciate that, Hump

But yo player, how come you and Money B decided to call it?
Why did y'all name it 'Rhyming on the Funk', You know what I'm saying? (Well)
I mean, like, alright, if the beat is funk, and y'all was rapping over it
So obviously you're rhyming on the funk, you know what I'm saying?

Yeah, that's what I'm saying

So why would you even name a song like that?
It's obviously rhyming on the funk, it's like you're not trying to be creative

Yo Humpty man, if you want me to answer your question;
You gotta cool out and listen, alright? (Uh-huh)
Yo, I just named it ""Rhyming on the Funk"" we kind of..
We decided to call it that, because we know the beat's funky and everything
But it's, it goes.. (Ooh, dig it!) Listen! Just listen! it goes beyond that
The beat's funky but we wanted to let people know where the real funk came from
We didn't mean funk as in funky beats
We meant funk as in the Funk Mob, you know what I'm saying?

Oh! Funk Mob? (Yeah)
What the hell is the Funk Mob, bunch a brothers don't take a bath? Ha, ha ha

No, no, Humpty, listen, man
Sometimes you act real dumb, you know what I'm saying?
(Oh, come on!) Funk Mob is like, you know;
All the new def producers who's doing the fly beats now
Like the Lynch Mob, the Bomb Squad (Yeah!) PMD, Dr. Dre (Oh! yeah)
They dropping all the hype new stuff, the Hip-Hop stuff
The Funk Mob was the old production crew man, you know what I'm saying?
The Funk Mob is Parliament, Funkadelic, Brides of Funkenstein
Freddie Wesley and the Horny Horns, George Clinton
And Bootsy Collins, you know what I'm saying?
Those kind of people..

Yo, I know those, I know all of them brothers, man

They laid the groundwork Humpty, you gotta give it up, man

Man, I know all of them brothers, man, I know... I heard Bootsy and George Clinton and them
But what I'm trying to say, is that it ain't really like that a new thing, man
The new stuff, the DJs and samplers and things, you got people like me saying
(They laid the groundwork) Stop what you're doing, you know what I'm saying?
(Nah!) it's just, it's a new phase
It ain't nothing like you trying to back there, it ain't

Humpty, be quiet, man, listen (Pffft.. be quiet)
You're not hearing what I'm saying
All the Hip-Hop stuff we doing now is BASED on what these brothers did
James Brown, all of these people (I know that, Shock)
You got to give credit where credit is due, you know what I'm saying?

I know this, man, yo, yo, yo, I'm giving credit, man
I'm giving credit, all I'm trying to say (No! You're not though)
See, you're making me upset, man! (You're not giving credit though!)
All I'm trying to say is; that it's cool but it ain't like the newer
Just I'm not from that time period (So What?)
And I don't understand all of that (You don't have to be)
And it ain't all that

Yo, you don't have to be from that time period to understand it
You know what I'm saying? (It's some of that!) NO-uh, it's all of that
(Psssh, aw, man) Not 'Just Knee Deep' Humpty!

Oh, uh, I didn't know the Funk Mob made 'Not Just Knee Deep' Oh! man!

Well, that's what it is! (Oh, shut up, man, shut up)
You ain't even up on nothing (Alright)
You ain't up on nothing! why don't you just.. (It's MOST of that!)
Huh? I'm not stupid; I heard you, you said it's Most of that
Cool, man, you finally gave it up, though!

Boo-ya-kaw is the sound, brothers goin' down in the worst way
I got my son a gun for his birthday
Now we've had enough, everybody wants to be tough
But I give the props to brothers on my level
Instead of trying to be above
'Cause I see nothin' feminine about givin' your brother some love
Look deeply in each other's eyes, you know we are the ones
Racism is a cloud that blocks us from the sun
One brother speaks in African, one sings Jamaican songs
Both of them are black men, but they still can't get along

But Momma's gettin' tired, and Poppa hits the pipe at night
I see 'em kissin' wishin' I got the props that Pops, I mean the rocks, got
I hope she hugs me, 'cause she never dug me
I figure still I hustle, tussle with the fool at school
The one that Momma sold my sneakers, thought she says he's freakin' her
Had the doubt until I caught 'em, then I fought 'em, then she slapped me
Hollered at me talkin' 'bout I messed up her ten dollars
Goddamn! Drug dealers dealin' to the kiddies
Livin' in the city ain't no pity on the itty-bitty
We try to cry, but still they all die
I try to speak to the youth, and the truth is they all high
What can I say but watch your back, youngster
As I sit and wonder, my other brother's steadily goin' under
It's like a curse, and it hurts 'cause it's worse
Momma's crazy 'cause her baby's in a hearse

This land once owned by Indians, who then would learn to burn
A tragedy, because from them there was so much to learn

Everywhere I look I see other chicks
And everyone I see is too close to me
And I'm living to die for you
If I was chick..
Because of you I'd be so sick
How could I be born into a life like this?
Cuz I'm living to die for you
Living to die for you
Why's the world so crowded?
No space to move my ass
Can't do my thing. Uh unh
Why's the sky so cloudy
I spend my whole life locked inside your cage
Uh unh
But I'm not your chick
So don't make me live in someone else's shit
Don't take my egg, don't take my chick
Don't take me now, this can't be it!
I'm not ready to die for you
Uh unh
Murder Murder Murder Murder
Murder Murder Murder
Too much beef in peoples' guts
Too much tweakin, time to giva' fuck
Momma Earth's freakin out
She's pissed at me and you and you
And hate has had it's run
We can't eat these guns
A new game has begun
We will not kill our sons
Love and light has won
Oh oh oh oh oh oh!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh!
And it's all about you

Wind Me Up,Who Got the Gravy?,1998,"(Humpty Hump)
Welcome to the Blue Diamond, Y'all
Ladies and gentlemen
I'll be your host, Edward Ellington 'Humpty Hump' Humphreys III
And we going to get it started up in here
Billy 'Big Thump' Brown on bass, Thump Brown
Brooklyn, Gibson piano
And on guitar we got Big Mama Dottie Taylor in the house
Com'on mang, drop it like, mang (x4)
(Shock G)
It's been a long time D.U. shouldn't have left you
Without a heated beat you could step to
Ever since the days when 'the Humpty Dance' left you
Open, I feel you're hopin' that we could pull through
Ninety-five was a long one
They said no one digs your music but you, kid
You need a strong one
But they provoked the wrong one
Because the kids' in rare form tonight
Hey yo we on one!
(Hump)
Let me put my nose back on
Notice how it flows when it goes back on
Banging! Freakin' the P-Funk, punk like a bag (?)
I got my man Esenchill E right beside me
(Natural E)
Yo Hump, look, I brought my rhyme book
Cool E, get ready to kick it after the hook
But before you e-mail 'em let me finish nailin'
This groove like a train derailin' (Like a train)
You better hold on, this song is for the strong
Ladies come on and get your flirt on
(Ladies)
When you coming with another one, Humpty?!
Everytime you ask that you pump me, love
Wind me up
Com'on
Wind me up
You wound us up so now we bound to bomb ya
Wind me up
Everybody
Wind me up
You wound us up so now we putting it on ya

(Natural E)
E, Shock and Hump, we got the bump
You wish for, Hump's back so pump that
It's supposed to lift your
Body up, we got enough
And prob'ly bust the floor up
Shock, you know what?
(Shock G)
Whats up, E?
I think this track's about to blow up!
(Hump)
Y'all thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
I'm drinkin' what you drinkin'!
So break it up with a crowded thrust (?)
With the bottles up, everybody sink in
To witness the fitness
State to state, don't miss this
Kisses to the misses
Mad pounds to all my bloodhounds
We plug sounds throughout the nation
True power chasin' blue ha hoo-rasin' (?)
DU, and E too, y'all 'bout to shout
We 'bout to place it
High rank, drop stop and bank
This spots about to get hectic, expect it
We got the drank so we got to drank
It won't be neglected, accept it
(chorus)
(Hump, singing)
If it ain't deep it ain't me, bay-bay
Do you take it through a fantasy, bay-bay
The smooth-cool faker is a live wire baby
Sons of the P is packing mad hi-fi figures
And we're in the mood to play (play)
We're going to do away with he-say she-say
(Shock)
Nas, you can have the world I want the universe
Not for myself but put all others first
(Hump, singing)
It's time, I'm ready to shine
I'm ready to see if I can walk through my mind, Like AMG
I'm not so high, not even lifted yet, only strengthed from the gift that
You give
(chorus)
(Hump)
Puttin' it on ya, boning your ear drums
Dum-dums, forgot that we can come-come
Yum-yum, we bring it different
You bring it humdrum
You're too cool, you can't risk it
I'm bis-quik
I bubble when you turn the heat up
I'm trouble around the honies cos I eat up
DRAWERS
Tasty, like bean dip
Frisky like catnip
Wind me up, FAT HIP
The big nose, back with the big bouncy track
We got the bass bouncing back
They got me started, so I'm a bomb it like who farted
Take the red sea and part it
Let my dog take a spill on it
Never phoney on it, yeah I still want it
But those shmoes knows how it goes so yo let me flaunt it
I boo-boo on it, take it any way you want it
Glazed, extra mayonnaise with no balogna on it
Poopty scoops and Humpty clumps of lean cuts
Deez nuts get busted clean, whut
I'ma tell ya what's been missing from the rap game...
This type of shit! Sang!

Ask around the world and they'll t-tell you the same

Yo what the deal Shock?  (Love yo)
You know me, keepin they heels cocked
Still round cause I'm down, 400 lbs of steel cock
You feel hot I warn you, what?  I never call you slut
Or diss you that's why my initials is on your butt
I get it up when you need it, promise I'll never beat it
Satisfaction guaranteed it, twice as hard if you eat it
My style's comedic, but in the bed ain't nuttin funny

Whateva, what you got, let's bounce, it's twelve o'clock

Stressed all week, scheduled sheets, rhymes and beats
Hit the streets find a club and then bag the freaks
Whateva throw the keys to valet, let's make our way
To the club entrance (Yo there go Pun with like ten chicks!)
The line's sexy, but we gon' get in this bitch
Let me light a clip, look for the shorties with the nicest hips

We had to bend a piece like the Max casual slacks
Ordered the Cognac, laid back, planned our attack
Straight off the back I'd approach, 'fore we took off our coats
She got close, threw me the signal like a third base coach
	Yo Whateva what's the deal?
	Yo ain't no time to speak
	Where you at?
	What you think, about to find that freak
The night's just beginning, strobe lights and nice women
Get in where you fit in, it's just The Mission

Physically blubber bound, but I crush a hundred rounds
Eat every bit of you my tongue is Digital Underground
Fuck around and catch the tongue twister
Big Pun'll make you come til you cough up a lung sister

Blind Mice,Who Got the Gravy?,1998,"All that's cool but, yo, what's up with me and you?

See the blind mice? We the blind mice
Trying to get in where we fit in
Doing anything to be down
Two hundred million blind mice
Running through this town

Patty Cake, Patty Cake I heard your man
Wears a gold Rolex and put a diamond on your hand

The Itsy-Bitsy Spider was a whoridah
Said he met the judge's daughter and went up inside her

House, there's a Mouse who Runs Around the Clock snitching
Who he hitting, I think he hit it raw cause he be itching

Shimmy, Shimmy Cocoa Pop, the Glock went pop
Tell me, tell me who shooting and who got shot

Ring Around the Rosie, a pocket full of blow
Everybody know the hop got you moving slow

Pinocchio says ignore my nose, you can trust him
I saw Bill in the back of Capitol Hill with Lil' Miss Muffin

Little Boys in Blue and Red Riding in the Hood
Heard the Big Bad Wolf said he never used the n-word
He huffs and puffs, he'll snuff you in an alley
But the Three Little Pigs scurry back to Simi Valley

Goldilocks went to cop some little boy brown
Should've stuck with the snow cause the brown cut her down

The Itsy-Bitsy Spider at the National Enquirer
Said the mayor told Niola to bend over or he'll fire her

The freaky Old Lady In The Shoe downtown
Is a brown sugar mommy, wants to pay to lick me down

The Big Bad lady Wolf said that she knew me
She huffed and she puffed and she .. mmmmm!

Three grinding mice
Trying to make a life called three strikes
The rat got three to five, two got life
Those Three Blind Mice

Now, Tom Thumb jumped up and said ""I got one
David Duke and Farrakhan riding side-by-side on the top gun""

Hickory Dickory Dock, each day I hear a new shock
The Cat in the Hat told me he be seeing 2Pac

Cinderella told me you was paid, if it's all true
Simon Says you can grab the hat, sink and fall through

""Somebody's sleeping in my bed, getting my head
Now his broad is on the stroll getting my bread""

And Humpty Dumpty leaning against the wall
Couldn't figure out the meaning of it all..
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life

Little Bo Peep is weeping, I hate to see you cry
Sometimes guys lie when your thighs are above you
Mother May I say you denied the evidence
The frog was only a prince when he loved you

Virgin Mary Poppins popping game, said she never had sex
Now she's popping X, talking about ""who's next?""

Scooby went to scoop another scooby sack from Shaggy
Scooby will do anything: hops, weed or cavi

Old Mother Hubbard's got a cupboard full of lotto tickets
A fat stack from way back cause she's pack rat

Mother Goose hit me on the cell phone, said granny
Got her healthcare pulled, had to move to Miami

Poppa Bear got no time for Baby Bear
Can't stop to feel the breeze in the race for the cheese

Peter Pan's in the White House dealing
Keeping the money out my hands, making me out to be the villain

Humpty Dumpty looking at the moon, leaning on the wall
Still couldn't figure out the meaning of it all..


Patty Cake, Patty Cake, can I be your man?
My cash flow's low but bro's got the master plan

Patty Cake, Patty Cake, can I be your lover
I'm wealthy in the mind and I'm healthy under covers

Papa Bear, Papa Bear, to put it modestly
I like diamonds & pearls but I'll settle for some honesty

Let the wet sensuality embrace your reality

Continuously we be gettin' freaky
Rose petals cham-pag-nee come and see me
Positions run fluid honey ribbons create a quiver shivers  delivers
Ooh wee sweet haromony synchronicity the simplicity
Seven day kisses slide in you and me me me 
You messin' up my mind in the right way I'm ready to play and lay with you
Been savin' all my love for a lotta days I'm ready to spend what I saved on you

I wanna do it outside 
I wanna do it in the rain 
I wanna do it outside 
I wanna do it in the rain 
Don't know if rain drops or lust swellin' in my eyes
Want to stroke you and soak you but not just between your thighs
Your hips plus the way roll grips gets me swervin'
Job site visit exquisite lunch time excursions
Kitty cats purrin' wet lips get near then...
Skin parts start disappearin'
Earlobes get chewed up Hennessy poured in two cups
Downtown is looking delicious audio schooled up
Let's heat the mood up say what's on your mind
When bones grind, lips to ??? sippin on wine
Rhythmic tussles but not the struggle
Ever juggle raindrops strawberry snuggles?
Do what you want to
Let's take it outdoors with out your
There's no one without beds without floors
Together explore, makin' the stormy breeze
Plays our body softly like piano keys
I wanna do it outside 
I wanna do it in the rain 
I wanna do it outside
I wanna do it in the rain
Erotic beads of rolling water tricklin'
And ticklin' swarms of moonlight kisses
Hips and thighs aligned in perfect nines and soft wet sixes
Wine and candy rain drop hor's devoures
To be dined from deep within your curves
We merge devinely on liquid missions
Climbing grinding finding climax with each position
Naked skin chills hair filled with rain
Caressing erect body tips next to me
It's ectasy when we play
Easing winds bring mounds of lust whisper three words we love to say
Dripping black laces, hidden places
Manicured hands around joysticks of passion
Splashing seeds of new beginning swimming on naked skin
Or trapped within thin lambskin walls
Windchimes and bells, erotic smells
Breath becomes deep, desire swells, desire swells
You messin' up my mind in the right way I wanna play and lay with you
Been savin' all my love for right one, I wanna spend it on you
I wanna do it outside 
I wanna do it in the rain 
I wanna do it outside. 
I wanna do it in the rain

Then a lap dance will have to do
If you can't take me home with you
Then a lap dance will have to do
If you can't take me home with you
Anybody got change for twenty?
Mmm, shake it up, shake it up
Yeah, I know it's rough out here, love
But we got your back
Give it up cause she's a man's girl
She's bubbling in a man's world
Give it up cause she's a man's girl
She's struggling in a man's world
Give it up cause she's a man's girl
She's bubbling in a man's world
Give it up cause she's a man's girl
She's struggling in a man's world
Now tell me, can you tell the difference
Between a fast-tracking, skank-gaming tramp
And a man's girl
Kind of seems the same with just one glance
See, both of them cause erections from afar
But upon closer inspection it becomes clear
Money B gonna get you in there
See, a clever girl knows
Not just hoes work them skirts that's mini
Prostitutes that dress this way
Try to imitate most of the uptown bitties
Now we don't really want to speak upon
Those girls who act real slutty
But we will talk about those man's girls
Those are the one we're studying
She's real secure, pretty toes pedicured
Baby got her own money
She thinks brothers who floss are funny
Ain't afraid to lick that honey off my body
Feminist party issues she don't care about
Understands men well and knows the power of long hair
I doubt
If she'll fall for the type whose pants are tight on
His pookie
Likes her sex fresh and fruity with the light on
That booty
Give it up cause she's a man's girl
She's bubbling in a man's world
Give it up cause she's a man's girl
She's struggling in a man's world
Oohwee, she popping! Gotta be, got me jocking
Even Nike and Reebok, the girl I'm talking about be rocking
Them pumps with the toes out ,super saucy when we go out
Or with her patnas, she can blow clout
'Cause she's the shit, no doubt
She's so about her scrill, that gives it all the more thrill
Can't lie, a little high
Couldn't get a better ride out of an automobile
Never make it hard to go chill
Let me do my thing, let a brother breathe
But she make it so convenient when she around
I don't ever want to leave
She's never stressing who
What I'm gon' do, how I've been riding with my crew
She says play on, ain't nothing wrong
As long as eventually I come home
When a brother finally do
The joke's on me 'cause she's gone
Taking care of she instead of worrying about me
For sheezy, she pleases me
Knowing that I got her back with what's important
Knowing that I'm down and when I clown with my homies
It's a necessity, she gets to me, yes, I confess it
Secure with her intellect
Never afraid of flexing them hoe-ish dresses
Sex appeal drapes her whole vicinity
I'm worked on, those girls that wanna get they lurk on
They get into me
Fingernails long
(Tummy showing)
Where you going, love
(Can I be down?)
Can I be around?
When you gonna freak with the freaks of the industry?
Come on, now
Get up on the table, baby, get on the table
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about
Can I hit that puna? Punana, punana
Give it up cause she's a man's girl
She's bubbling in a man's world
Give it up cause she's a man's girl
She's struggling in a man's world
Give it up cause she's a man's girl
She's bubbling in a man's world
Give it up cause she's a man's girl
She's struggling in a man's world
And I appreciate it too, love
I love them shoes, love that dress
I love the whole program
I know you can't keep it up everyday
But when you do I'm loving it, just like that
Now take 'em off
You deserve a foot massage
And I'm about to give it you
Can I get that puna? Punana, punana
Somebody give me change for a twenty
And get up on the table
Oh no, I ain't giving you more than a dollar
No, don't stop that sexy groove
'Cause we like the way she move
No, don't stop that sexy groove
'Cause we like the way she move
No, don't stop that sexy groove
'Cause we like the way she move
No, don't stop that sexy groove
'Cause we like the way she move
No, don't stop that sexy groove
'Cause we like the way she move
No, don't stop that sexy groove
'Cause we like the way she move
No, don't stop that sexy groove
'Cause we like the way she move
No, don't stop that sexy groove

Cyber Teeth Tigers,Who Got the Gravy?,1998,"[Intro: Shock G & 
Krs-One
]
Yeah, ayo Kris, tell em what's up, though
Yo.. yo, yo!  One two!
Coming atcha live and direct!
 (That's right)
Digital Underground kid, you know what's up, hah!

Ayo, Kris is chillin, Shock G's chillin
What more can we say about the villains?
The real killers chillin in the White, I mean the
Not Right House, want me to be they lab white mouse
The smile of seedy greedies, deprivin the needy, breakin treaties
Overseas, whylin while they profilin on the TV's
Some of 'em cool though, see I like that nigga Bill
Hittin everything in town, and he got that smile down
Now, let's break down the meaning of a smile
Is it happiness and blissfulness?  Well, let's go down the list
You got the ""Real Deal For Real Real"" smile
You got the ""Phony, They Don't Know Me, Let Me Have My Feel"" smile
The ""Dumb Embarrased"" smile
The ""Ooh, She Look Delicious, Sure That Girl Is Lavish"" smile
Then you got the ""Shake Your Head, Nah, Black
That Shit Was Wack"" smile
The ""Across The Bar, Yeah, It's Cool
We Can Hit The Sack"" smile
The ""Crack"" smile, the ""Caught In The Act"" smile
The ""Over My Shoulder, Caught You Schemin' On Me
Delayed React"" smile
The smile you're really glad to see, when it comes round
The spot's hot, they got you boxed in, it's bout to go down
You glance back, your man who packs that, once in a while
Gives you the ""Oh, I'm Strapped, Do Your Thing, Baby, I Got Your Back"" smile

Smi-ling fa-ces, some-times (Come on)
Pre-tend, to be your friend (Yeah, uh)
Smi-ling fa-ces, show no tra-ces (Smiling faces, yeah)
Of the evil, that lurks within, hah!

What do you think I joke? (Nope)
What do you think I sniff coke? (Dope)
Me a Wild T'ing, like Tone Loc, you'd better be go
When the sound clash erupt, rev up
Step up to the cut, ""Wassup?""
I show up to blow up and leave the spot towed up
You know what? I'ma go nut
And you know what? Yeah, so what?
It's the regular, when you check for the
One that perfected the
Smiling face people posing as your equal
Knowin' they wanna beat you, defeat you and eat you
But they greet you with peace and love
Not with the beast, but the dove
Not beneath, but above
Now, the cheek, give a hug, snug
No grudge, 'til you turn your back and learn the facts
It's called learn the truth
The tree is only known by its fruits
These smiling faces, in many places, sometimes they racist
Sometimes they sexist, sometimes they want your Lexus
Sometimes, they be your family members remember:
""Oh no, not my lady, oh no, not my fellow""
With them, you thought you'd never ever sever
But they was two-faced and headless
With a whole 'nother agenda but clever to say: ""Whatever""
Forever, let me make this relationship better
If you're real, stay real, be real
The truth, we got to treasure, not these

Smi-ling fa-ces, some-times (Smiling faces, yeah, yeah)
Pre-tend, to be your friend (They know they're phony)
Smi-ling fa-ces, show no tra-ces (Smiling faces)
Of the evil, that lurks within, hah! (They may be lurkin)

Holla Holiday,Who Got the Gravy?,1998,"All you got to do is follow the music
And listen for the rhythm..listen for the rhythm

Now here we go (HERE WE GO!)
Come on (COME ON!)

BOTTLES UP! It's a holla holiday
PUT 'EM DOWN! Break me off some love

Now bottles up, fall in line
It's about that time to take your coat off
Let's have a toast, coast-to-coast
Show to show

So, holla at me
A brand new holiday for players of all kinds
Rich, poor, blind
Yellow and red, wake up the dead!

Shine the lights, this is Harlem Nights
True, Digital U and Papa Hump's
Bringing that slump you can bump to, boo

Don't be sleeping
Here's the opportunity to let that dove out

We looped up Public Enemy in the drums
To make you bug out

Lace me!
We's about to do what they don't
Housing!
Ready to hit the year 2010

I work that brown nose
Hoes usually laugh
We cruise all through shows
With us, the Underground will blast you

Out of the frame
Can your brain stand a taut sack of deez nuts

WE WANT SHOCK-GEESUS!

Yo, I want you back

Fat tracks I've heard
But them words got me debating
All them dumb songs, cloned
Got that tone, you've been waiting


Well, next up in line to toast ya
Clee and my man John Doe-ja
We got that bump that'll shake you up
It'll wake you up like Folger's
Coffee, back up off me
Cause we be super-saucy
I'm with my doggs and
Them dum-dum moves gonna prove to be costly

My doggs be, always with me like I'm Rabbit Hut
And four-deep in a jeep in the street
Plus with the Zapp, super-slumping

Bumping, hella drunken
But we always into something
From doing donuts, making hoes go nuts
Our names should be Dunkin

It ain't no function
We chose today to holla and spread love, folks
We talk to each other like we was brothers
We have more pull than tugboats

But like them cutthroats
That cash flows up and down like a teeter-totter
Instead of their doggs
They check for their Lexus and their Movados

I don't know why cause
Who they checking for ain't even ridahs
We keep our doggs beside us
That's why we the survivors

BOTTLES UP!

Toss up your Hennessy, Mo'-mo' and Alize
Ain't no player hating this way
It's a holla holiday

Move on, move, move on


So go on, na!
Doggonit, everybody get your love on
Everybody be getting they hug on
Forgetting to put they doggs on

Ladi-dadi, nothing but a party
Toast this up, let's make it happen
Holla if you need me, pass me the beadie
We through rapping
Holla at me, holla at your doggs
Take me high, lace me
Make love to my intellect
Sprinkle me, mayne, sprinkle me
Cause the people over the stairs
They ain't sweating me
Move on, move on, move on",https://genius.com/Digital-underground-holla-holiday-lyrics

Humpty Hump
]
Mhm
Yeah, D.U
Truck Turner
BDP
Why?
Yeah
Humpty Humpty bout to put his thing thing down
BDP in tha house, wassup?
Truck?T?in tha house

Oh,?yeah, here we go again
Instant paper?to the pen
Yeah, to bring the lines then
Begin, I’ve already?begun
Skyy?Vodka?on my tongue
Bottles?up while daddy’s?about to come
And cough up the lyrical loogie
You’d think I was a break booth the way these niggas salute me
It’s prime rhyme time I gets mine baby paw
I leave you in a state of awe
I rips it on the first bra
Crackabis with that cigar
Tuning like a guitar, so far
These workie rappers, your flows do amaze me
You all deserve the bubble yo
But some is having trouble so
Knock on my door, bring a cup
I’ll hook you up, baby, fix you up
A proper cup of Humpty gravy
I put new niggas on y’all
Cause I fall, they’d be savin’ me
Holler at me, don’t be pagin’ me
You can’t, I never owned one, that’s on my mother
I hate the little annoying ass battery having fuckers
Ask anybody lay low
A track without the gravy is like dried mashed potatoes
Peace to 
BDP
 they hooked me up heavy
Everybody else form a line and get your cups ready

Who got the gravy?
We got the gravy
Pour it on baby, pour it on baby
Yeah
Who got the gravy?
Humpty got the gravy
Pour it on baby baby, pour it on
Yeah
Who got the gravy?
We got the gravy
Pour it on baby, pour it on baby
Yeah
Who got the gravy?
Truck T got the gravy
Pour it on baby baby, pour it on

Punks tried to duplicate my flavour, Hump
So they could spread the gravy thick
But always ended up relapsed, don’t front
I know we got your tastebuds 
My style is offendin’ but I got loose from the begining
No ending, that cup run it over with the gravy
I pour some for my homies, and then I serve the ladies
Baby, but don’t get greedy
Some kids just restart my funky sound so I donate to the needy
But don’t be a  this flow is mad fattenin’
The Steelo took the scales when he’s laughin’
Then into calories is like a million
Had to put my flow on a diet just to fit up in the buildin’
So when somebody asks
Who got the gravy and the stash?
You’d better say Hump’ll kick the foot up in that ass
And when somebody else asks
Who got the gravy and the stash
If you don’t say Truck, you’d better get set for the blast

Who got the gravy?
We got the gravy
Pour it on baby, pour it on baby
Yeah
Who got the gravy?
Humpty got the gravy
Pour it on baby baby, pour it on
Yeah
Who got the gravy?
We got the gravy
Pour it on baby, pour it on baby
Yeah
Who got the gravy?
Truck T got the gravy
Pour it on baby baby, pour it on
[Verse 3: Humpty Hump, 
Truck Turner
]
A lot of people wanna know the recipe for the gravy
Not Chef Boyardee but cook it all live for you, baby
Damn, the lyrical flow you can’t get out of a can
Stricly homemade to keep a brother paid
This hint can’t be took out of a cookbook
Here’s what you got to do for gravy lyrics in your stew
Add one part skills, two parts flavour
 should get the life I have  behaviour
Styles upon styles that’s the secret ingredient
Put the top on and let it simmer in experience
Let it marinate, in the slum that’s how we do it
Serve it up, live the facts of life of that I grew with
Sometimes I let the honeys lick the butta out the bowl, funk patrol
Make it sure is hot, don’t serve it cold
We boogie oogie oogie with the track on boil, Humpty!
What?
Spice us!
Look out the cookin’ hole
(Who?)

Who got the gravy?
We got the gravy
Pour it on baby, pour it on baby
Yeah
(Who?)
Who got the gravy?
Humpty got the gravy
Pour it on baby baby, pour it on

Who got the gravy?
We got the gravy
Pour it on baby, pour it on baby
