They Want EFX,Dead Serious,1992.0,"Bum stiggedy bum stiggedy bum, hon, I got the old pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
But I can fe-fi or fo, diddly-bum, here I come
So Peter Piper, I'm hyper than Pinocchio's nose
'Cause I'm the supercalafragilistic tic-tac pro
I gave my oopsy, daisy, now you've got the Crazy
Drazy with the books, Googley-goo where's the gravy
So one two, um, buckle my, um shoe
Yabba Doo, hippity-hoo, crack a brew
So trick or treat, smell my feet, yup I drippedy-dropped a hit
So books get on your mark and spark that old censorship
Drats and double drats, I smiggedy-smacked some whiz kids
The boogedy-woogedly Brooklyn boy's about to get his, dig
My waist bone's connected to my hip bone
My hip bone's connected to my thigh bone
My thigh bone's connected to my knee bone
My knee bone's connected to my hardy-har-har-har
The jibbedy-jabber jaw ja-jabbing at your funny bone, um
Skip the Ovaltine, I'd rather have my honeycomb
Or preferably the sinsemilla, Let's spiggedy-spark the blunts, um
Dun dun dun dun dun, dun dun

They want EFX, some live EFX
They want EFX, some live EFX

Snap a neck for some live EFX

Well I'll be darned, shiver me timbers yo, head for the hills!
I picked a weeping willow, and a daffodil
So back up bucko or I'll pulverize McGruff
'Cause, this little piggy gets, busy and stuff
Arrivederci, heavens to mercy, honky tonk I get swift
I caught a Snuffleupagus and smoked a boogaloo spliff
I got the nooks, the crannies, the nitty gritty 40 doe
So all aboard, castaway, hey where's my boogaloo?
Oh-h-h-h-h-h-hhh I'm steamin, a-go-ny!
Why's everybody always pickin on me?
They call me Puddin' Tane, and rap's my game
You ask me again and I'll t-tell you the same
Since I'm the vocal vegemintarian, stick 'em up freeze
So no Parks sausages, mom, please
A-Blitz shoots the breeze, twiddly-dee shoots his lip
Crazy Drayzie shot the sheriff yup, and I shot the gift
And that's PRET-TY SNEA-KY SIS, oh yo
I got my socks off, my rocks off, my Nestle's cup of cocoa
Holly Hobbie tried to slob me, tried to rob me silly stunt
Diggedy-dun dun dun dun dun, DUN DUN!

So here Fido boy, fetch, boy, fetch
I got the rope-a-dope a slippery choker, look at me get raw
And I'm the hickory-dickory top of morning boogoloo big jaw
With the yippedy zippedy Winnie the Pooh bad boy blue
Yo crazy got the gusto, what up, I swing that too
So nincompoop give a hoot and stomp a troop without a strain
Like Rosco P. Coltrane
I spiggedy-spark a spiff and give a twist like Chubby Checker
I take my Froot Loops with two scoops, make it double decker
Oh Finster Baby come to Papa Duke
A babaloo, ooh, a babaloo boogedy boo
I went from Gucci to Stussy, to fliggedy-flam a groupie
To Zsa Zsa, to yibbedy-yabba dabba hoochie koochie
Tally ho I-I'll take my Stove Top instead of my Tater, so
Maybe I'll shoot 'em now, nope maybe I'll shoot 'em later, yep

Dread, yo come and hit these niggas in the head

People people people people)

Shippity bop, well hot diggity, where's the iggity? The bum siggity
Niggas wanna know but check the flow my little chickadee
I'm comin with the Books and kid it looks like it's a winner
Ya better get'cha plate because I'm servin raps for dinner
See I freak it from the sewer plus I'm quick to do ya posse
I swoop in on the loop just like I was a kamikaze
See they thought I lost my spot so they went and got real comfy
So now I gotta hit 'em hard and Bogart, like Humphrey
Ya hypocrite, I'm rippin' it because I'm flyer
You're phony, full of bologna like Oscar Mayer
See I attack a pack of rappers just for practice
I bust my tactics, I'm sharper than a fucking cactus
(Set it off!) One two (Set it off!)
Yo it's the Books in reverse, the next kid up sendin a big-up to my borough
I'm thorough, bred-ed in the ghetto from a teenie bop
Takin' lessons, sweatin' niggas on graffiti rock
And now the slang bringer bring a thing of interpretations
My nerves is achin', see I'm sick of niggas perpetratin'
But can't see this, I'm screamin' on their records like Beavis
Or Butthead, I bust heads like Amy
Fisher, it's a, pisser, hit you like an accident
And if I'm in your town you might peep me at the Radisson
Or splatterin', batterin' crews for lip chatterin'
It ain't nothing new, that's how we do, my crew is back again

Back in effect, how's that?
(People people people people)

(and yo I still wanna rap)
Well here I go again, so check the flow again, try not to bite
I'll fake a nigga with my left and then I sting him with my right
I'm outta sight, look how I do it, ya blew it if you dissed a
Nigga on the microphone cause I can bone your sister
Word is bond, I'm on some new shit, do shit like this
Grab the piece of steel and shoot the gift like Kris
Kringle, bust my jingle, don't it make ya shiver?
Give a nigga what he needs so he can bleed when I deliver
A microphone check, what the heck?
I threw that in because I used to catch wreck
Wit it, that's the time I ""hack-thoo"" spit it
For Christ's sakes I meant it, hit the brakes and you skidded
You shitted, my style you bit it, but y'all can keep that
Cause now I'm on some other type of flow and best believe that
Yeah and all that, small cat, my format's deranged
Honey I'm back to run things cause some things just never change, punk!
So if you're drunk, I'll freak the funk until you're sober
But still be gettin' chills when niggas play ""The Bridge is Over""
Kickin the flam yo it's the man, tick tock, I jam like gridlock
My style is fender-bendin', sendin' rappers to the pit stop
Good Lord have mercy, hit reverse, G, if you missed it
And bust my gift of speech cause like the priest, baby I'm twisted
Kid I swing a dome-buster like Bonecrusher Smith
Bust up your lips then puff up a spliff
So yo, who be dat that wanna do me back, just to get
Booby trapped, jack, cause my crew be strapped fat like that

Bust a flavor
Word up uh, yeah, uh, yeah

(*The hardcore rap act is back!*)
(*Ha ha, ha ha, now who's rhymin?*) HARDCORE!!!
(*The hardcore rap act is back!*)
(*No I, no I ain't smilin*)
Verse 1: Dray
Yo, yo
I said it first with the verse to make these niggas wanna act up
Smackin up the wack and Solid Scheme they hook the track up
So back up or swing or you'll get stung by my stinger
Heard that I was rich and now your bitch is on my dinger
Then I swing the jungle shit so fuck the humble shit
Kid I crumble shit, motherfuckers know I never fumble shit
So bring your weapon or keep it steppin or hit the deck-in
Cos in a second I'mma pull a fuckin Tek-in
Start rejectin em, affect em when I kick
Y'all niggas think you're slick but y'all can suck my fuckin dick
Y'all see me gettin busy wit my man and my DJ
Strictly kickin facts and then we max like TJ
Cos we play for keeps, my peeps they don't be flakin
And if you wanna test well yes your bones is gettin breakin
Or broken, no jokin, I shoot them *?in them rise?*
Fuckin with Das you wind up in hoes-
-pital, so bust my riddle when I reveal it
If niggas wanna play around then stay around and feel it
Cos yo...
Hook (x2)
Verse 2: Skoob, Dray
Now to my style there is no equal, boy I'm lethal like some tumours
My crew be strokin bitches like I used to stroke my pumas
Wit my toothbrush, see I do just what I wanna
I got that from my pops and from some niggas on the corner
So you never catch me rappin about no shit like the Government
But I be snappin on MC's like your bitch snap on double mega of a shotty
And a burner and I keeps the 2 ready
To hit you in your chest like Steve Young do Jerry
Rice, be nice and stock slice by umbilical
Knew that I would be the ill-form freaker of the syllables
And son is rugged, you're gonna love it in an instant
See I smoke blunts but yo my pops smokes Winstons
Well it's the D-A-S, I can't forget the E-a
F-a to the X so when I flex y'know I bein
A fatter wrecker nigga on the mic with my strategy
Kids is mad at me cos they ain't as fuck as bad as me
I takes the best of them so fuck the rest of them
I couldn't care less for them, I'm too fresh for them
I just be wreckin shop and gettin busy, nigga check it
Never actin broke cos yo I sold a fuckin record
I'm too slick for dat, suck my big dick for that
Don't try to trap my rap cos yo I'm too quick for that
I got the recipe and yes it's me with my crewin
So if you didn't know, well nigga this is how we do it
Uhh
Hook (x2)
Verse 3: Skoob
Abara-cadabara, return of the punk MC batterer

Yo it's the rootin-tootin-nig'-shoot-to-give nigga with the superdest
Flow, son you'll get no wins cos I been
Lurkin in the murky waters of my starvin shark style
Ever since the days of the Clarks and the Argyles
Quick I rip shit to bits like piranha
When I blow up the spot wit more watts than Rolanda
And when I come thru I'm hittin you up with the 1-2
Teks, flex raps like Bruce Lee flex the kung-fu
Look at my tongue, do it what it feel like, get ill-like
That fat nigga my game is all-skirt tight
Used to fuck with shorty's wit the jelly playin celly
Now my name is on your flyers and my tyres ain't Pirrelli
Wit the chrome dip, so don't flip cos shit's gon' get heated up
I'm weeded up, yo Dice I need a cut

Jungle,How We Do,2003.0,"How I keep from going under, nah mean?
It's wild out here
They wonder why niggas smoke so much weed
Drink so much Henny (How I keep from going under)
It's crazy. Getting crazy, nah mean?

Yo, I'm from where the days are short and the nights are long
And when I'm stressed out, I'll write a song
And analyze the right from wrong, 
I speak for half a million
That fight like Israelis and Palestinians
You dark enough? Watch the trees you barking up
Dunn, they even locked Sharpton up, now that's some other shit
The government is scandalous and try to cover shit
I'm on some CNB, ""keep on, my brother"" shit
There's a lot of pain in this grain that we go against
Life's a dirty game, you either play a ho or pimp
We the crack cats switching up the product
And every week or two, another school getting shot up
Little niggas turning killer at an early age
Sending other little niggas to an early grave
They always say that the good die young, specially in the hood I'm from
Feel me

It's like a Jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
How I keep from going under
(Ooh, child things are gonna get easier)
It's like a Jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under

How I keep from going under

(Child, things gon' get brighter)

Yo, I don't know where to start, so I will where I am
Sometimes in this world, I don't know where I stand
I'm just trying to make bread and share with the fam
And do what I gotta do take care of my fam, look
One minute yo, getting ready for tour
Next minute yo, out here getting ready for war
The news be giving me the blues like 
BB King
The thrill is gone, man, 
this life ain't no easy thing
If it ain't one struggle, it's a-motherfucking-nother
Everyday my sister having beef with mother
Sometimes I say, ""Fuck it, Dray, why even bother?""
I'm still trying to work this shit out with my father
My old lady say I stress too much
A lot of shit be on the brain, I don't rest too much
I guess, living in the Jungle got me uptight
Trying to figure out a plan that got me up nights, man

It's like a Jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
How I keep from going under
(Ooh, child things are gonna get easier)
It's like a Jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
How I keep from going under
(Child, things gon' get brighter)
It's like a Jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under

It's like a Jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under

Yo, biggidi bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife, when I'm not home (dah)
I swear to God, these times is hard but I ain't giving in
I'm trying to get to Heaven and out this Hell I'm living in
And can't no man stop me, why, it's obvious
They even gon' lock me up or pop me up
We smoke weed and spill Henny
They killed (?), but they ain't gon' kill Timmy

Diggity McVeigh, I giggity gas stay
Was trying to say, ""Fuck my people,"" in direct-ly
I say, ""Fuck you,"" you can get touched too
Cuz niggas in the hood, they gon' do what they must do
We hustle
, we just trying to get by
Every day, yo, we talk shit and get high
Understand, Life's A Bitch then you die
But real niggas never die, only multiply
Feel me

Look forward, son
It's gonna get brighter",https://genius.com/Das-efx-jungle-lyrics

I kick raps for sport, plus I'm short like Barney Rubble
Check the slang, boogity-bang, um, I goes berserk
When I flex like Popeye I fight like Cap Kirk
So bozo, I'm knockin 'em out the box by the pair-em
High strung, my tongue got moves like Fred Astaire
Tallywhacker, I'm dapper, the rootin' tootin' rapper
I diggity-drops the funk so you can call me yippity-yapper
The slippery slick sister, stiggity-start the grammar
I'm comin like the Red Coats to toast an MC Hammer
So jumpin Jehosophat, yesiree
The Books in reverse kicks a verse

Like a BBD, I whips it, I smacks it, I flips it
With slick {shit}, when {shit} hits the fan, man, I slaps lips like lipstick
I'm harder than a hard-on, never tender like vittles
I bust fronts for kicks, 
eat a Twix and some Skittles
Then I'll giggle, hehehe...he...ha!
Higgity-hallelujah, toots, a dab a day'll do ya
I'm the baddest, got more fans than Randy Travis, makes a cowboy
Hop, skip, flip back to Dallas
He's the Don, 
have you seen my grey poupon?
Bust this, 
we roll more spliffs than Cheech and Chong
We can do this, I ciggity-can't lose like 
Parker Lewis
Get the picture? I'd rock a bar mitzvah if I was Jewish
Goddamn, 
I'm sittin on the bay by the dock
Smokin', strokin' on my big fat cocker spaniel
Breaker 1-9, what's ya handle?
'Cause now I got the siggity-sock soup like Campbell's
And now

I was strong from the get go, I'm not 
Lou Ferringo
I never caught the cooties from a floozy or a bimbo
Like Chico, I'm the man, yes indeed, I got the smart, so
When I take a stand, just take a seat like Rosa Parks
Some tomato, tomahto, baloney, bologna

Now who you fuckin with is Diggey Das EFX
And we flexin, cause kid we got this rhyming to perfection

Aiyyo I figgety flow I rocket blow a nigga out the socket
Getting product, keeping

It's the rhyme fiend about a second from the crime scene
The boogie banger twisted off the lime green
Fuck a dime we, strictly fifty, the BDP and Hit Squad committee
King of my city, ask my cousin Smitty, yo
Got to get the dough, got to blow the spot
Diggity Das KRS East coast on lock


To corny niggas y'all get ate, my shit'll make you faint
So much 
platinum on my walls
 that I can hardly see the fuckin paint
You think it ain't but for a year I stopped recordin
Now look we comin' back and runnin' shit like fuckin Michael Jordan
Accordin, to my niggas in the sewer
Yo you a, corny nigga so we gots ta do ya

This for my niggas on the block, 
handlin' rock like Kenny Anderson
I'm brandishin, stiggedy styles to keep MC's vanishing
Scattering, fuck it, styles don't be mattering
My pattern's amazing son 
Blazing like a Saddle
 and
Battling's a no-no, got more Fame than Coco
I'm paid and still jux you with a blade from my logo
So take your, style and 
Go-Go like D.C. niggas
Y'all know the haps we movin strapped on the East nigga

Yo, yo, well miggedy mayday, mayday, it's Krazy Drayz's payday
I riggedy wreck it eryday, kick shit like fuckin Pelé
But wait a, minute, cause we get in it for the masses
For classes, yo KRS come get up in they asses

What... I say, follow me follow me
With my syllable syllable lyrical criminal
MC threats are minimal to my physical they just
Whittle and whittle away, with little and little to say
As they piddle and paddle away, they say OK
But I chop that ass up anyway
What's your handle I got mad MC heads upon a mantle
I got genuine MC skin sandals
I light the mic up like a candle, watch it melt
Cause when I belt lyrics females are screamin for help
When you hear it, you can't bear it, you can't even wear it
You oughts to just cheer it, go get in the spirit!!
Of the la-la-la-la-la, I'm comin with that rara
Rockin mics when you was googoo gaga to your momma
You wanted to battle KRS when you was young you told your poppa
He slapped you in your head and said UHH-UHH
But you didn't heed the warning
Now I'm in the place, now I'm in your face
Lookin at your crew but they all broke out

I comes to get biz so bust the jam
I might not be the man but y'all I still proceed to slam, I cram
To understand why these rappers try to faze me
They must be crazy messin with the Books and Drayzie
Big-up to Jersey and my people's out in L.I
Well-a hell, I can never catch a sweller
Cause you can tell I gets biz like Markie
No matter what the weather son you never wanna spark me
I'm kickin rhymes and gettin mines on the regular
See me in the black Benz just blowin up the cellular
We high as shit, the sky is hit
You know the sewer style yo is fly as shit
So grip (what?), you're cheap and buried cause you're never comin near it
So fear it when you hear it, cheer it but don't compare it
I still be schoolin, foolin em when I'm speakin
Kids be peepin, they love the way that we be freakin
My sewer style it cause disaster so when I ask ya
You better answer who's the microphone master

Miggity microphone master, super rhyme maker (x4)

Well yo, here's the humdinger, I'm briggity bringin a new style of lingo
It's a rap singer with the fat flow, so lo and behold
I higgity hold this mic piece for ransom
It's all about expansion, stocks of skunk, props and my pops get a mansion
By the age of 16, had dreams of big screens
Mad rubbers to keep my dick clean
Chrome tools in rent
And I only go downtown to buy jewels and tints
Jaboll, Guess, ol' Gold and sess
I check the mic 2-1 and chew gum to ease the breath
My style is wild like the Cats of Villanova
The heat on the street'll keep my 40's spillin over
So the skunk and thai keep me high when I'm smokin
And I don't sleep, just take naps with one eye open
See I believe the beaded weed in me is feedin me
The inspiration to riggity rock the nation
From white folk to Haitian, Boriqua Jamaican
Burn MC's like degrees of Mason because you're fakin
I'm on point, exclamation with the caper
The flavor misbehaver from the super duper rhyme maker


I got to give a shiggity shout to my mans, my fans at the shows
Friends, foes, stiggity stunts and hoes
Drats! I'm freakin it rather fat, ooh shit!
My crew is shake, rattle and roll thick
Thicker than your blunt cause yo I be's the Brooklyn trooper
And I got more spunk than that punk from Punky Brewster
Bust the lingo Ringo stiggity Starr bingo
I run shit like Kunta, breaks bones like Mandingo
I'm starstruck like starbuck, the bad bro is mad though
I'm all that small cat like Tonka or Hasbro
I have no figgity fear yeah, it's me and mines
Masters of the microphone, makers of the super rhymes

Yo, well yo the shit sound clever, I'm down for whatever like nuttin nice
Big-up to DJ Dice wreckin shop when he cut 'n' slice
These 20 MC's, please! I never heard of some
We need to murder some like Colin Ferguson
But now ya heard us from the under so feel the thunder
Ya best ta come clean like Jeru and Felix Unger
I'm buggin like gristle, see I should dis you
Dismiss you, my style's official and that's the issue
I show the flow I go until it's time to leave
Believe I'm packin more rhymes up my sleeve

Yo yo

Gotta switch again because we back up in this bitch again (No doubt)
We roll like Michelin, the rappers know the pedigree
Flowin steadily, yo Boogie Banger, is you ready G?
I'm miggity made of snakes-n-snails and Rottweiler tails
Jiggity joined by the balls in case all else fails
Higgity hails from the land of gunslinging and I tell ya one thing
Diggity Das EFX we run things, hunting
Down hardcore clowns and love singers
And I got more styles than Brooklyn got drug slingers (word up!)
Police oppress me, MC's wanna stiggity stress me

You faggot MC's marked for death

Verse 2: Dray, Books
I line up rappers then I drop em like they dominos (No diggedy!)

And ain't no diggedy, I flow until infinity, you must be kiddin me
Ain't niggity nuttin gettin rid of me
Big up to PMD, forever gettin blunted
Flooded in the triple black Benz 500
I riggity rap like Saran from here to Pakistan
Me and my man came to kick styles out the can
Fridge you with the flow, yo it's the big chill
Ship all pounds plus stack my grants in a hill
You better settle back, bruh, or ya head'll splat
I smiggity smoked the pot that called the kettle black
Provoke and get your jiggity jaw broke
B-K-L-Y-N we no joke!

So I got eyes behind my back and I biggity black the 80

Remember you was schoolin me when you was only a seed
Now it's time to school you cos see I'm a nigga that's true
If we ain't see it in the streets, my crew, we heard it from you
A few couldn't understand cos you was raised in the street
To each his own, whiggity where you layed your hat was your home
None see the shining sea, you been the star on TV
See I only knew you by face til I met my nigga P
Piggity put me on to you, tiggity told me to shine
So when you had the time, iggity I had the rhyme
Started runnin with them kids and keepin up with them trends
I never took it as a diss cos me and you was just friends
But now your man's got you on some other garbage
C. Deloris Tucker got you thinkin murder charges
Plus them same cats flipped on you, dissin you
Cos you're sample says ""You ain't original"", I wanted to get rid of you
But who would figure you would try to play both sides?
You honey rides, you look at your reflection through my eyes, no lies

I'm ready on the set, check it
You're wonderin where the heck I've been
Chillin stupid, cos it ain't no trooper who got wrecker than
The boogie banger, it could be danger to battle us
Cos we guys make niggas wanna revise their rap books
What up kid? I can serve it rugged with the hip-hoppin
Throw it, like the semen from my nuts up to my dick top

Me one of the, two niggas from the
Sewer, my shit is milk without the magnesia

I suggest MC's proceed with some caution
I tip, dip, grip and trip because there ain't no
Way you're gonna live when I erupt like a volcano
I'm acid, my crew is massive, you're soft like jello
I'm gettin props, dagnabbit, like Abbott & Costello
When I flaunt this, niggas want this, style I be usin
A switch it when I pitch it, cos bitch I bring confusion
Comin to get'cha it's the dingbat
So nigga think back to the way I bring this
Or brung that, I swung that, now look at the way I'm swingin this
Just like my name was Joe DiMaggio
And hell Dray! My 12 gauge spits shells like pistachios
We can get it on and, word is born and, fuck who you be G
Your crew is easy just like Sunday mornin when I'm yawnin so
It's no sense in you losin what you got kid
Cos G I be doin the mic like Mr. Chi be doin the chopsticks
Ya gets done, black, no matter where ya from, jack
For fun, I'm nailin rappers like a thumb tack

I keeps it on lock but son I gots to come correct (what?)
The shit that I be smokin get'cha open like a Tek
Check the glaze in my eyes, no disguise
And I smoke so much boom that I should win a fuckin Heisman
I wise like the wise men
I buys ten bags for dolo (and yo)
Sick of niggas askin ""Yo what up with K Solo?""
Well I'ma fuckin bastard when it comes to gettin blasted
If it's the hashish then fuck that ole two-in-passion
Cos oh my God, I hog the blunt like a boss
Baby sip the 'orty til the 'orty get me source
Get the quart, force it down with no shorts and no loss
When it's down to the spit like T La Rock said, it's yours
Just take a hit everytime a wack rap singer slips
So peep the cracks in my lips to the black fingertips
Nigga cos I crack you up like the Riddler (word up)
Plus I come to get higher than Hitler
Lay sessions with the skunk, keep my tape stretchin
From every section to niggas on lock in State Correction
So when I'm in your town at a club near you (aiyo)
If you got the bomb. motherfuckers bring it thru
How we do

(Gotta story to tell you all)
(Here's a little story I gots to tell)

Uh
Well say hello to the bad guy or am I or  cause I'm ya
Local slinger swinger, quick ta bring the drama
Plus not the kid to sweat but test me if ya wanna
I'm baggin kids up like they bagged that chick Tawana
Brawley, some ignore me, others I bother
For the props and top dollar, G I'm doin what I gotta, see
I puts the fear in ya heart kid, I start  for nuttin
And no this ain't the dope that catch ya cuttin, plus
Now's the time to make my move cause I'm out to do tha
Kid that tried to stiff me for some Buddha, sleep (word up)
I peeped every spot his boys be, I got crew
But what am I do is get somebody new to do it for me
I'm catchin wreck to prove a point, time is loot
And I ain't spinnin it in the joint but better yet
These days I'm all professional, some new  I got
I check this nigga that I used to snatch jewels wit
Back in the day but nevertheless the kid's ass' slingin gas
To pay bills to 'ford some pills that kill stress (I hear ya kid)
Now as for me G let's just say I learnt the rules
I paid my dues and now I cruise in my Lexus
No better time than the present to make him an offer
He can't refuse but might regret it, so I'mma set it


Well, umm, take this job and shove it
Punk  it, another day at work and
My boss is on my back and I'm about to go berserk and
Catch a fit money grip cause pumpin gas is a bitch way
Niggas be ridin by my job and frontin like they rich and
I wanna bust with disgust 'cause I'm sour (aha)
Takin all the  and only gettin four dollars a hour
There go some bitches swearin that they better
Givin' a cold shoulder as they roll by in the  Jetta
I gets no play though 'cause they know they cuter
Can't wait to take a  break so I can go and puff this buddha
I'm bustin my ass but my cash just ain't stockin
Now who's this creepin up the  block-in?
Clockin, lookin like he really wanna test this
Just another dick, I oughta stick him for that Lexus
The  is killin me, why this kid grillin me?
Actin like he wanna bust caps and start fillin me
Up wit some hot , I spot , I'm buggin
I fuckin know this nigga because he used to be a thug in
My area, cause hysteria, I guess he chillin
We used ta rob niggas back in the day when I was illin
Like jaw-tappin niggas just for yappin
He claim he got some loot that I can make, I give him dappin'
Umm, let him kick it cause now I'm tryin to sink in
I need to make this dough so now ya know he got me thinkin

{Interlude: Dray & Scoob conversing}
Yo what up kid? I know that was you B, yo what up?
(Yo what up kid? Yo, I'm just out here doin my thing man
I'm tryin ta make this loot man, what up to you?)
Yo what's up? Put me on kid, ya see what I'm doin??
(I'm sayin man, what you doin man?)
Word up, I get off in a few B
(Aight! Yo I'm tryin ta see ya, word is bond!)
Yo yo, I ain't frontin kid, word is bond!
(Yo I'mma see ya aight)

Bringin it back cause now I'm wit it
I'm lookin ta make this loot so now I figure
I hooked up with this nigga
Because he bound to make my pocket's bigger
I'm lookin to do this just gimme the cue and I'm willin
He scooped up, suit me up
Boost me ups so now I guess we're chillin

I'm guessin we're like on some back-in-the-day 
I need you to do me this
Justice, some bustas keep on playin me on some stupid 
Crab nigga, up on the block he's just a tad bigger
Time to earn the cash so here's the burner and the mask nigga

Yeah yeah yeah that sound cool so gimme the tool because I'm on it
I leave em layin stiff and if that's how ya really want it
I'm buggin when I pull it, watch the bullet leave em leakin
Yo, hold up, cops! Yo I think them cops is peepin

Oh , where they at? Stash the gat, toss the herb cause

Rippin up the rappin
Look at the way I kick it, I'm wicked
, it happen
One night in Manhattan, chillin, buggin
Me and some of the crew went around to this club and
Peeped it, scoped it, hoped the (ishh) was rockin
Stunts by the bunch had a hunch they was clockin
Stepped up, dressed up, the young got some weed back
Honey got done then begun talkin to me, Jack
I kicked slang to her, all my niggas knew her
I wanted to gas ahead and take her back to the sewer
To do her, screw her
I knew I had to hush
When I felt my belly drop on the spot, turned to mush
Um, shush shush, I needed me a bush
I felt loosey bubblin, trouble in my tush
Then the gush came gushin, rushin, splat!
The juice hit my BVDs quick like that
Smack, I biggity-broke my (ishh) from behind
Tried ta shake it, fake it
But yo I couldn't hide from...


Well, do-si-do your partner as I start the intro
Cos nobody does it better, correctamundo
Back in '86 I was thick with the skills
Playin ball in the gym with my niggas from the Ville
I was runnin it like the trooper, had no time to play the small cat
I had it goin on, word to mother I was all that, black
So one day, believe it or not, I'm chillin
I was playin against these niggas from The Bronx for some chitlins
So bust it, I'm indy with my Coogis, gimme the rock, G
I float like a butterfly and kick like karate
I scored 26, I caught a fake and now I'm outty
I'm takin it to the hoop and then this kid tried to foul me
(BLAAOW!) Boom to the gutter, I hit the floor, I wanted to flip
I couldn't, damn, all of a sudden I had to (ishh)
So I dipped to the sewer, I couldn't control the (ishh) because it
Slipped past my hip, drip drip like a faucet
Down past my shorts and hit the court and all of a sudden
Girls were gettin sick, all my niggas they was buggin
I made it to the bowl leavin behind a trail of dookie
My drawers are soakin wet and I'll never forget the day I met....",https://genius.com/Das-efx-looseys-lyrics

Ha, let you know how I do

Holy smokes, cheerio chap, I'll make your toe tap,
 so watch the birdie
Now check how I'mma wreck it like a demolition derby
Wit the Books, oops toots, I used to live on Bedford
But now I rocks the microphone and chill like Robert Redford
So bring it cos I can swing it, kid, like Reggie Jackson
I got the bats 'n' balls but now I needs some action
Ayo you can call me Prego because my style is in there
And I'll dig in that anus, man, as if my name was 'swimwear'
See I rock a hoodie sweater, 
more wood than Woody Pecker
I twist it like an ankle, G, or maybe Chubby Checker
In LA I hit the chronic, I'm super like the Sonics
I'll jab you with the left and swing a hook without the phonics
Okey dokey, hocus pocus, I make the dopest MC call a timeout
Cos yo I rip the shit up when it's time to throw my rhyme out
I'm twisted, my flow will make you dizzy like Gillespie
If ya test me, I'll rip ya, flip ya, strip ya, then I jet see
Yo I be flippin like I get busy at gymnastics with my rap skits
I slams a punk like Jordan slams a dunk with a basket
Ball, see, 
I got ya all three tempa-cheerin

Fuck what you heard, you need to get with what you're hearin yo

Ayo, my crew is top notch, I stomp like sasquatch, that's why I rip shop
My crew be on the hustle plus we tighter than a zip lock
I freaks it vice-versa or maybe versa-vice-a
It really doesn't matter, kid, you see, because I'm nicer
Ayo it's from a lime to a lemon to break inside your car
See when I be on the block I'm like that nigga H&R
Cause when I talk, niggas listen, I rip til I jism
Perhaps that, I make you wanna clap to the rhythm
Well yo, I'm wicked, not Jiminy Cricket or Davy Crockett
Some niggas wanna rock it when they think that I'mma block it
With my grammar, cause yo I am a, sewer flow-er
Ya best ta back the hell up when I swell up like a boa
Constrictor, cause yo I rip tha, mic in half, G
Even if I slowed up you couldn't pass me
Well hello there momma, you better be bringin the drama to a pause
Like a comma or I'mma have to drop you like some drawers
So hey hey hey, you thought it was just another 
fad like JJ
Cause I be usin a, style that's stupider, than 
Sheneneh
So bust the way I flip it like a double-headed coin, kid
I rolled two spliffs, so now I guess I'm double jointed


I be the devious, mischiev-ious, kid believe me, it's
Not the move to riff cause in a jiff I freaks the sleaziest
Rappa-type funk, punk I be rippin
Niggas know my name I got more game than Scottie Pippen
Yo I be kickin it to the optic lens, flippin when I'm knockin skins
A nigga who be clockin ends, so next I guess I'll rock a Benz
But now a BM, niggas be like ""Yo, did ya see him?""
I'm creepy, I'm kooky, and plus I'll make you scre-am
See I don't understand why niggas be wantin to do me
You don't arouse me kid, you're softer than that Cosby kid Rudy

Tick tock about this chick around the block?
She was high host, to the most hostess, no boastin
Back in '85, she was live, yo no jokin
A real go-getter, didn't try and sweat her
Fifteen years old and she was pushin a Jetta
She had loot, moms and pops dukes had the bank 'n'
She walked around school and the stunt would act stankin
This young miss only dated older fellas
My slang couldn't hang, no thang, I wasn't jealous of her


Oh yeah, where was I? Bustin, now I'm ready
Now it's '87 and Miss Thing is goin steady
She was schoolin, chillin 'cause her man was makin papers
Tellin all her friends that these niggas caught the vapors
He found a, phone-uh, then yo he boned her
Soon came a smack then he act like he owned her
He used her, 'bused her, fractured her wrist
Then her tummy got fat, behind her back, gettin dissed
I was buggin, nuff on the stuff that I was seein
But that's how it goes for the hoes when they're being...(dumb)


Aiyo mirror, mirror, mirror, mirror, mirror on my dresser
Remember that chick Loretta, back in the days I used to sweat her?
I wanted to smoke the boots, true, it didn't matter
She was kickin it to my man, Stan who's livin phatter
Than me, hops, chillin in my hoodie and my Reebok's
Now she's in a jam 'cause, Stan was slangin rocks, but
Look at me now, honey, 'cause it's the morning after
I'm dapper, a nappy-headed undaground rapper
Word to mom dukes, she was zoot so I took her to my show
Just to show my niggas that the hooker was... (dumb)


Ah the show was phat, now it's back to the room, G
Yo mirror, this is where Loretta tried to do me
My neck was on her tongue, eps was gettin swung
Krayz was gettin biz with the friend that she brung
Then she took it upon herself to let me know she's in the mood-uh
Then she lit the buddha, oh shoot-uh, I screwed her
I showed her, I rode her, from here to North Dakota
I gangbanged the boots like a Brooklyn troop oughta
I stuck it in her (butt), bust a nut, she was starvin
So I pushed in the bush til those lips started partin, but she was... (Dumb)",https://genius.com/Das-efx-dum-dums-lyrics

If niggas got some beef then good grief boy they'd better speak up
Cos I'm rippin this, my style's ridiculous, look how I word it
These niggas couldn't tell us they were jealous but I heard it
When they came and tried to tease, please they must be jokin
They tried to diss the kid, they got they  bodies broken
For that rap  cos black I smack  from here to Chile
I swallow up your crew 
then crack a brew and spark a Philly
Cos you're bluffin like you're rougher, enough of that crap
Just meet me on the stage and let's see who can really rap
Cos if you really wanna battle, well that'll be the spot
So now I pass the mic so that my nigga Books can rock
Three cheers, ayo where's the mic guy? Groovy!
If you step then watch that first one cause that first one is a doozy
Then I'm up next to squeeze, I got nuff expertise
For the roughnecks and G's, I'm swingin somethin, bust the function

Do your  vest son, just to make a mess, umm

Hey sweet lookin, you need to peep what I got cookin

So you can stay real, kid, but I'mma stay rich
Aight, I kicks my style from Brooklyn and some MCs wanna test this
So I'm sendin em to the showers by the powers that are invested in
The nutcracker, black, I wear these gloves to smack a phony
Ass backwards, like Kraft cheese and macaroni
Good grief, some tried to rock it, G, they need to knock it it-off
They must be eatin Gerber's cos that  they dropped was sit-oft
For worse or better, kid, I never let another serve me
I'll get flyer than that 23 on Mr. Jordan's jersey
Crews be talkin rough but they can cough it up just like they spit up
The night that they was  lookin for some skins to hit up
Now I wait for Solid Scheme to bring the beat back

Well comin to school ya it's the hooligan

I'm out to do these rappers just like Popeye did Brutus
The super dooper, trooper, oops I'm no beginner
So watch me get loose and run shit like Bruce Jenner
I formulate my raps, perhaps you wanna kick it
These niggas know my status, I'm the baddest when I wreck it
See I'm nicer than the rest, I guess I gots ta prove it
Ya cruisin for a bruisin if ya bite it when I use it
See I'm quick to shoot the gift, and if ya tryin ta stop it
I got mad skills like loose change in my pocket
I drop it from the East, at least I'm gettin mine in
Some niggas gettin jealous cause of the way that I be rhymin
Oh, hello there, how the hell are ya? Sorry to keep you waitin
It's like nuttin when I'm flowin, somethin rougher than menstruation
Cramps, I'm followed by your camp like John Cougar
Mellen, tell them punks I put a swell in, where the Lord split ya
I kick tails that tip scales on the Richter
I dip-dip-dive wit more drive than the Harlem River
Oh what the hell, I'll smoke a half a el then stub it
Pick up my grip then spark the clip and get rugged, see
It's back to basics if you're wack then niggas hate it
Got the knack to freak a track like I was sprintin in some Asics
Boy, I'm slicker than soap-on-a-rope
I'm madder than the Mad Hatter and Yabber Dabber Dope and you can quote...

Attackin ya, back in ya, fuckin face it
Terrorizing MCs as if my name was Jason
I crash em, trash em, monster mash em til they seckle
I'm quick to switch up and kick ass like Dr. Jekyll
I'll bring it from the guts, my DJ got the cuts
Shit that I be bringin got'cha swingin on my nuts
I'm not the typical lyrical, gotta be a miracle
Drop the type of shit that make ya flip and get hysterical
I'm nasty with the verbs, kid, I'll serve ya, rip ya, bust it
My raps they never collapse cause on the tracks, see I be bustin like
Fireworks, I'll fly your jerk skull and then I'll step
I'm back from hibernation and I'm waitin to give it a rest
Give it a rest fool, great balls of fire, boy I'm flyer than a cockpit
Hops, I rock shit and knock niggas out the box wit
Uncontrollable lyrical motions from my larynx
So, slick, watch your chick because my clique might slam her next
Like BOOYAA, ready or not, troop, don't mean to lose ya
Kickin a style for '96, thinking back to the future
Puff some buddha for the brain and drain a 40 for the belly
I'm aimin for the top just like this was a game of skully
Plus I'm sinkin ships, doin whatever makes the blow rock
My crew is good for nothin, stuffin chicks without the Stove Top

And niggas out there know just what I mean
I ride the beat like a jockey
Short and stocky
I'm never sloppy
The honeys wanna clock and knock me
It don't shock me
I see it all the time
Get a little fame and now a nigga look as fine as wine
I know the game 'cause I study
Me and my buddy
Ain't nuttin funny niggas know the sewer style is nutty
Give me the money cuz I'm tryin to make a million
Rollin with my clique and yo we dick like a Sicilian
I bring the drama for the masses
Whippin niggas asses
So get ya glasses time for classes
I take my chances, I gots to go for broke
So knocka don't provoke, just chill and roll a smoke
It ain't no joke I know you recognize the sound
It's diggety Das EFX and this is how we gettin down
(chorus) x4
Yeah, here it is
Do it like this
Comin' from the sewer yeah you know we never miss..

Dollar dollar dollar place your bets across the table
One mo' time cuz its show time without the cable
Holdin down the spot and any wack penetrators
Is fallin to the flames of my rap incinerators
I'm afraid I got some bad news for crews
By the twos, son, it's hard like booze so don't snooze
I'm throwin jabs, hooks and uppercuts to your face, G
Hittin you with the perfect combination like Stacy Lattisaw
I be the jibber jabber jaw
I'm gettin devilish
The skunk derelict ghetto lyrical specialist
And yes its thick
The restless clique
From PMD to Boo with the Lexus whip
Now true indeed a few MC's they just don't know what they doin
Cuz when I smoke the blunt witcha, ya had the blunt canoein'
So yo, now I gotta dis cause niggas piss me off
The way that y'all be rhymin if you want it, step up like Doggie Diamond

Yeah, here it is
Do it like this
Comin' from the sewer yeah you know we never miss..


Krazy Drayz, holding down the block

You bitin rappaz better exit cause when I flex it
You won't neglect it cuz when you fucking least expect it
Kid I wreck shit
Bring it from the sewer
Miggedy mic check can't forget the one two-a
The incredible man of the season
Here's the reason its the rhymes I'm releasing
It ain't no thing that's how we do it nowadays
Bring it from the sewer wreck shit and then we swayze

Another day another buck-fuck
What nigga please
I'm overdue wit these flows, niggas I'm bustin at ya toes
So get to dancin
Son I even got my crew makin hits like Charles Manson
Kids nappin, can't forget the ransom
I'm not so handsome
So when I pick up my pen, my temper tantrum overcome it like voodoo
And I'm rougher than bruise you
Sharp like cold crystal, yo my niggas tote 'istols
I don't eat the beef, pork or the goat tissue
Black I blast a missile penetratin through ya radar
Hey star ya style's horrible like fuckin Hägar
Hip hip hooray-K
A the eye swella
The one who be hittin the bitches blue black to high yella
It's the boogie banga
Better yet the banger of the boogie
A black Champion like my hoodie

Can’t Have Nuttin’,Hold It Down,1995.0,"Niggas just can't have nothing (repeatedly)

Well yo, they used to say that Dray was a motherfuckin bum
Cos when it came to profit, son I really wasn't gettin none
The wildest motherfucker that you ever saw
They used to call me Petey Wheezthrow, the devil's son-in-law
Got into shit like a fly, I was buggin
From robbin to stealin to dealin, yo, and even muggin
Sellin cocaine in the high school halls
Playin it slick I kept the vials up in some tennis balls
I used to run across the bridge with my peeps
I packed a tre-8, in them days I was playin for keeps
I used to roll around Manhattan all day
Lookin for a prey that we could rob on Broadway
Stickin niggas for their jewels if they're worthy
Made a couple of hits and then we jetted back to Jersey
'86 and '87 was the year
Had the Gucci hat, rock the raccoon fur coat gear
Keep em in the sky and nigga don't ya blink
See every Saturday, we robbed another nigga at the rink
The beast was always showin up at my rest
Asking ""Does a certain Drayz live at this address? Yes?""
The spot was hotter than the sun, without a doubt
I had the choice to go to school and get the fuck out!
I hit the South just like a bandit cos I was stranded
Virginia State in '88, you know that's where I landed
I couldn't stand it, shit was feelin strange
I made it outta range but yo, my shit was just about to change


Yo bust a move, peep the flav
Cos I'ma take you back to the days of brown envelope trays
Twenty-something years ago as I proceed to recollect
A newborn shorty headed for the decks of Bushwick
Bless the day, Pops shot the gift off the vodka fifth
Damn, fam got the shift
From the tenth floor down four flights to the sixth
This was around the time smokin reefer was the shit
But now the crib a little bigger
I was the first man in the fam so it's plans for a nigga
Had my clan from my building and my man from 8-11
Wit me when we hit the jams behind 2-57
Mom's babysittin, Pop's on the hustle
54 block was on lock, bust a knuckle
Game grip, some niggas slipped and got greedy
Believe me, another ""rest in peace"" in graffitti
But I couldn't resist a few fights and petty heists
Cos now I'm 'cross town in the Heights
My nights are a little quieter but still amongst the schemes for the fun
Where sons run guns and blow slums with the dumbs
And motherfuckers don't care
I love the street game so I stashed the green leaf by the air
You couldn't tell me shit either, was more eager than a beaver
Kept it fresh, double-parked in the Caesar
But I got to cease with this behaviour-type flavor
And do Moms a favour, go to school and get this fucking paper
So bust the caper, cos now I'm all in
At Virginia State, now let the bullshit begin


(Dray)
The year was '89 and yo, I'm staying out of fights
I'm running with this nigga named Books from Crown Heights
Gettin tore up from the flow-up, we're drinking til we throw up
We're thinkin we can blow up so to class we wouldn't show up
(Books)
Well nigga so what? Yo fuck the holdup, I'm with whatever
The butter leathers, son I got to get my shit together
Getting drunk, and flunking classes was the function
Smokin blunts in, son we need to stop frontin
(Dray)
We're goin huntin, Virginia didn't have shit for us
That's why we broke out with Dice and Blitz in the blue Taurus
Gettin busy, flippin rhymes on the weekend
The deal we was seekin from styles we was freakin
(Books)
But yo, now it's '91 and me and son we got to scramble
(Dray)
Aiyo it was a rap contest, nuttin we couldn't handle
(Books)
And yo, something got to happen or I'ma get to clappin
Son, we got the blueprints to this new style of rappin
(Dray)
Packin skills from the sewer, I knew we had a shot
Gotta go and blow the spot and show them niggas how we rock, what?
EPMD is judgin it, yeah they cruisin through
Makin all that money on that Business As Usual tip, we flip the tongue and started wildin
They hit us with the digits to the cribs in Long Island
So we packed it in, me and my men we got Swayze

My advice is you better learn a trade
Before you kick a rhyme and end up fuckin gettin sprayed
I keep you open like you're fuckin sesame
You're just a pest of me, you'll never get the best of me

I bring it from the sewer, here my nigga come again

The Books In Reverse kicks a verse
I'm takin it to ya face, I'm iggity on the case I pursuit
To stomp an MC like grapes and then scrape 'em with the boot
I bring swing to the ring like Lou Duva
Giggity-got land like a cruiser, Pop Duke, he whip a cougar
For pages I kick it raw til my jaw caves in
Amazin and plus off-beat like caucasians
Me get done? Never son, 
I hold it down for 718
Where niggas fuck around and where niggas lay
Ain't nuttin slim, I got game like 
Tim Hardaway
Fouls like the proudest so 
I'm louder than RCA
Aw shit, I got you buggin, flippin that shit that you lovin
Plus I got another back in the oven
Some heard the style and did construction on it
But they just touching on it, bitch ass niggas ain't got nuttin for it
Come up off my blocks or I'll blow ya spot
I rock like that bald-headed nigga on Fox
(So how we do?) No shorts from niggas or they fuckin girl and (what you got?)
More styles than

From subject to predicate, my rhetoric is spank
It's no competition when I'm flixin with my diction
Oops flexin to the beat y'all, yes yes yes

Wait, I'm great, ya'll niggas know who sent this

Challenge any one wit balls nothing, rock the hardest
Racoons rap wit your soloists and various artists
Puttin it down on the J-9000 SSL wit stories to tell

Guns with banana clips, two Rolex's to master whips

Bitches twist the vine, I'm high and the moon's mine
We're out to get mines, on a regular
On the south, probably took the dreaded predator's pirate treasure
In the crib I bought the leather, plus a movie screen

Bank accounts wit fat paper, a major player cos....

Niggas still tripping off the shit I said last year

You got to have style, and learn to be original

Look what we created, and we made it for fun

Bronx...
And every sucker MC had a response

The Memories Remain,How We Do,2003,"Yeah, lets go deep, nah mean
Feel me on this one right here
Yo
Here we go, yo, follow me close

Yo, if you take a look deep at my soul you see a fire burning
A higher learning, part the sea dog and I'm emerging
There was a time my life was all about a hot ride
Until my pops died turned my life lopside
If there was a way to bring you back nobody showed me one
You was my only pops, I'm still your only son
Disagreed a lot but kept love ahead of pride
Damn I wish I coulda said goodbye
So what I did was I asked the Lord to hold you down
Cause for the family dog imma hold you down
All in the same breath I thank the Lord for what I have
To y'all it might not be a lot but it's what I have
Indeed, I got mouths to feed without (a seed?)
A few hungry niggas thats down to bleed for me
See liggidy-life ain't always what it seems to be
But I'm focused now I'm right where I need to be

Say when mi look up ina mi life its plain to see
Yo its never gonna be the same
Take another step on towards my destiny
But the memories still remain
Deep ina mi brain inna mi soul I hold the key
Yo it's never gonna be the same
Throughout all life and beyond all eternity
Yo I keep burnin up the flame

Yo, yo
I miggidy-move in the frame of a calm cat
Mortal Kombat Yin and Yang one step beyond rap
I learned, things don't always go according to plan
So all in all for what it's worth I'm now a stronger man
I see life a lot clearer, still wish you was a lot nearer
I look at myself see visions of my pops in the mirror
It's wild, sometimes it hurts when I breathe
Like it hurt to know you never see the birth of my seed
You was there for my birth in the ps and to ya last breath
And made sure I had food and kept a address
Plus you knew I had a mind of my own
You taught me game and left the rest for me to find one my own
Now that I'm grown I envy you, one son two daughters
As long as I'm underneath the sun above the blue waters
Imma continue to move forwards and I'm not done
Til the world know exactly why I'm my pop's son


Keep burning uppa the flame
The flame, never gonna ever be the same
The same, keep burning uppa the flame
The flame, got memories will now remain
Remain, keep burning uppa the flame
The flame, never gonna ever be the same
The same, keep burning uppa the flame
The flame, till jah jah link we again",https://genius.com/Das-efx-the-memories-remain-lyrics

Here we go, riggity-raw as I ever was
Diggy Das blow the spot, shine fo'eva cuz
Same chrome (what?), never rock with the same flow
My chain glow like lines up in the rainbow
Aiyo, Boogie Bang what the deal, son? (Yo)
For real, son, break it down, how you feel, dun?
Yo, when my record company fail, I'm gonna need bail (why?)
Flippin on coats like Latrell Sprewell
My cat's gone broke off blowin weed sales
Can't see mine, dickhead, you're gonna need braille
Like females, cats is fake, I snap and break
Your biggity-back and neck and crack the safe
Snatch the cake, get in the truck, divvy it up
Not givin a what, just give me a cut
We're livin it up, my crew get buck in berry singers
Shows get wild like Jerry Springer, ice on all fingers
Cross beared, me and my dogs fair
New York shittin, politicking, but yo kick it

In your face, kid, you don't need a telescope
Smellin smoke, break the mic, make sure it's broke
Ain't no joke, you can quote every word I wrote
My antidote, stiggity-straight from the subway
The thug way, miggity-Monday to Sunday
Lyrical dum-dums, watch the stray shots
Stay hot (word) like them chicks from Baywatch (kid)

Ghetto star, play the bar wit tha Heineken
Find a friend, hit her off with the fly talk
The sly talk, riggity-right off the sidewalk

You're lickin this like a lollipop, sick wit dis
Miggity-makin moves on a regular, wack MC's I'm testin ya (pow!)
Smack you with a chair like a wrestler

Run the streets of Brooklyn, properties on an island
A pen and a pad, you know my steez when I'm weeded
Bring rhymes together like cleavage
So love it or leave it, I got to eat, kid, plus got mouths to feed
Hip-hop crowds to please, bullshit trials to beat
Dreams are blastin' at my team, blast back
Matter fact, my game is tight and that's that

Skirts wanna do me, pursue me, ooohwee

And boom bang em, I gets paid for droppin slang
I'm the, rap veteran, it's time to take your medicine
I cam to catch wreck (wreck), kid, what you expect? (expect)

Now everywhere we go it's on the radio
But yo, I'm not a show off, I come to drop the flow off
And make sure the top blow off, it's how I go off
Chorus (x2)
Verse Two: Redman
Aiyo, it's the rap scholar, hot around the collar
Pack a blaka-blaka, since I was a toddler
Drama, the nine-seven nigga Madonna
Reptile texture be the blood of an iguana
Sick, dick about nine inch thick
I make a fo'-twenty Benz-o look like a six
First of the month I got the bundles for the wick
My hands big as a catcher's mitt when I brick
Sucker MC's who did not learn
If you don't this time
, from coast to coast I'm
The Dark Ranger, call me Don Punanna
So hot, my chewing gum flavor's enchiladas

Deliver the cold to the place that shiver the a-richter
Fuck you and the ship you came on
While you sit around bitchin I get my bangs on
Chorus (x2)
Verse Three: Dray, Skoob
I'm back with my rap forte, okay, no way
Tryin to get away with murder like OJ
Rappers better throw their rhymes in the garbage like trash
You come around here you get mashed
Like potatoes, because I hate those, oh lord yes
Shorty in a dress lookin like she tryin to get blessed
What's this? Tapped ya on the left breast
I guess I need a rest to giggity-go and handle my biz, yes
Yeah, yo, yo
I'm feelin tipsy off the potion, slow-motion coastin
Roastin in the corner just postin
Up, drinkin liquor out the cup
That's when I struck my luck and saw shorty with the strut
But, she look scandalous, maybe from Los Angeles
I knew that I could handle this no matter what the challenge is

Aiyo mirror, mirror, mirror, mirror, mirror on my dresser
Remember that chick Loretta, back in the days I used ta sweat her
I wanted to smoke the boots, troop, it didn't matter
She was kickin' it to my man Stan who's livin' phatter
Than me, hops, chillin' in my hoodie and my Reebok's
Now she's in a jam 'cos, Stan was slangin' rocks, but
Look at me now, honey, 'cos this the morning after
I'm yapper, a nappy-headed undaground rappa
Word to mom dukes, she was suits so I took her to my show
Just to show my niggas that the hooker was
Dum dum dilly dee dum dum
(Diddy diddy dum dum)
Dum dum dilly dee dum dum
(Diddy diddy dum dum)
Dum dum dilly dee dum dum
(Diddy diddy dum dum)
Dum dum dilly dee dum dum
(Dum dum)
Ah the show was phat, now it's back to the room, G
Yo mirror, this is where Loretta tried to do me
My neck was on her tongue, Ep's was gettin' swung
Krayz was gettin' biz with the friend that she brung
Then she took it upon herself to let me know she's in the mood-a
Then she licked her boot-a, oh shoot-a, I screwed her
I showed her, I rolled her, from here to North Dakota
I gangbanged the boots like a Brooklyn troop oughta
I stuck it in her backwards, bust a nut, she was starvin'
So I pushed in the bush 'til those lips started partin', but she was

For the world
Yo, check it out

Now all my hardcore niggas make noise (hooooo!!)
And all the honeys gettin money make noise (no doubt!!)
And if you're down with hip-hop make noise (make noise!!)
And ya don't stop
I be, boogity woogity brooklyn boy, the nigga that you could never be
Forget it kid, your style is limited like a Cherokee
Kiggity calm and deadly, I play the low like R. Kelly
Kiggity killer top up in this hip-hop game, its the
Diggity das, we biggity back with the formula
So kid, I'm warnin ya, were figgity fed and bout to corner y'all
Kiggity krazy drayzie, no doubt, I brought the poisons
Its me and my boys, son, were biggity back to bring the noise

Yo, biggity back to rock your knot (no diggedy)
I do it til infinity (so make some noise if you're feelin' me)
Hip-hop'll never stall or fall cos ima carry it (yeah, yo, yo)
And marry it and keep it (up on) slap and heavier?
Cmon, higgity hey-high, fuck the ho
Buffalo soldier, I told ya, I be the
Jibbity jibber jabber, biggity bigger, badder
Quickity quick to crack the skulls of punk commercialized rappers
A tasket, a tisket, I riggity rip shit
Smoke the books in re-verse when I flips shit
So hip-hip, hooray, new style, niggity new day
A shiggity shooby dooby, yo piggity pass it to me
So I can wriggity rap, catch wreck and let it off
Get it off, biggity blow mad spots and set it off
Riggity represent the east, no peace, its hard times
Hard crimes, thats why we get down wit hard rhymes",https://genius.com/Das-efx-make-noize-lyrics

""One wrecks, the other destroys""
""One wrecks, the other destroys""
Oahh-kay, oahh-kay; as we go and do it, do it like this
It's like this and you don't stop
Word is bond when we kick
So I'ma get on, and swing it somethin like this
You punk niggas gel up, when I swell up, spark the el up
By the way troop -- oops, I feel a new style developing
So safety stellar, I'm not the Baby Bubba on the level
I crush shins, the roughest hardrocks to Fruity Pebbles
Well nigga, boo hops, you know my crew rocks, who wanna test me?
I'm next G, heavens to Betsy, I sting like Pepsi
Or Coca, Cola-swola, niggas higher
When I fly up these niggas bitch-ups, but y'all can dry up
I be the jibber-jabber, quick to make a nigga stagger
Like some rocka, Blanka, I bake that ass like Betty Crocker, momma
You need to stop in-filling your pockets off that pop *shit*
Ai yi yi my dreads, I think I'm toxic
Well yo I'm cuckoo but not for Cocoa, some say I'm loco
Fuck around and catch a cap like Mary Buttafuoco
So you know, that I'ma follow you wit the drama
Slice em, dice em, and ice that ass like Jeffrey Dahmer

Tick tock, can I slide that cock up in your tummy dear?
I drop a ounce and then I bounce just like a Gummy Bear
Be kickin it like the rapper kicks the bucket dig it
Uh, ah shit, now whatta I have to do to prove I'm rugged?
I wear my hair crazy like them niggas Red and Grady
Punks just serve up, clever like Alice, serve the Brady Bunch
I makes em wheeze up, cause when I ease up, I eat MC's up
I leave em on their backs layin' flat with they knees up
Eureka, musta speak uhh, re-aversin' person
No rehearsin' I can flip it in reverse and
Change em, rearrange em, supa-dupa
Faze em, daze em and blast that ass with diff'rent days-in

Well blow, me down, great Scott, I'm wilder than the rock
In the winter, man my 40 Timberlands hit the spot
His pops name is Alvin, my sister's name is Kitty
My rap was for fools like some silicon titties
HIYA, I kicked it and there it goes my *?an?* abuse
My style is a child like now it's fatter than Roseanne's
Well check how I'ma wreck it when I'm, droppin, this rhyme
Don't let me have to transform like Op-ti-mus Prime
Cause then I'ma have to flip the script and get dready
Run laps around your *faggot* crew like Mario Andretti
When I expand like spandex, my jam wrecks the Ampex
You better be on the way before I'm doin' you and ya man next",https://genius.com/Das-efx-gimme-dat-micraphone-lyrics

Verse 1: books
Uh

Local slinger swinger, quick ta bring the drama
Plus not takin the sweat but test me if ya wanna

Kid that tried to slip for some buda, sleep (word up)
I peeped every spot his boys be, I got crew
But what am I do is get somebody new to do it for me
I'm catchin wreck to prove a point, time is loot
And I ain't spinnin it in the joint but better yet
These days I'm all professional, some new (shit) I got
I check this nigga that I used to snatch jewels wit
Back in the day but nevertheless the kid's ass' slingin gas
To pay bills to 'ford some pills that kill stress (I hear ya kid)
Now as for me g let's just say I learnt the rules
I paid my dues and now I cruise in my lexus
No better time than the present to make him an offer
He can't refuse but might regret it, so i'ma set it
Hook
Verse 2: dray
Well, umm, take this job and shove it
Punk (f**k) it, another day of workin

Catch a fit money grip cos pumpin gas is a bitch way
Niggas be ridin by my job and frontin like they bitchin
I wanna bust wit disgust cos I'm sour (aha)

Clockin, lookin like he really wanna test this

My area, causes hysteria, I guess he chillin
We used ta rob niggas back in the day when I was illin
