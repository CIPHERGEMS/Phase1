Moment of Truth,Moment of Truth,1998.0,"No matter what we face
We must face the moment of truth, baby

They say it's lonely at the top in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
Nobody's invincible, no plan is foolproof
We all must meet our moment of truth

The same sheisty cats that you hang with and do your thang with Could set you up and wet you up nigga, peep the language
It's universal, you play with fire it may hurt you
Or burn you, lessons are blessings you should learn through
Let's face facts, although emcees lace tracks
It doesn't mean behind the scenes there ain't no dirt to trace back
That goes for all of us, there ain't nobody to trust
It's like sabotage, it's got me ready to bust
But I can't jeopardize what I have done up to this point
So I'ma get more guys to help me run the whole joint
Cultivate, multiply, motivate or else we'll die
You know I be the master of the who, what, where and why
See when you're shinin', some chumps'll wanna dull ya
Always selfish jealous punks will wanna pull ya
Down, just like some shellfish in a bucket
'Cause they love it to see your ass squirm like a worm
But just as you'll receive what is comin' to you
Everybody else is gonna get theirs too
I ain't no saint, therefore I cannot dispute
That everyone must meet their moment of truth

Actions have reactions, don't be quick to judge
You may not know the hardships people don't speak of
It's best to step back, and observe with couth
For we all must meet our moment of truth

Sometimes you gotta dig deep when problems come near
Don't fear, things get severe for everybody everywhere
Why do bad things happen to good people?
Seems that life is just a constant war between good and evil
The situation that I'm facin' is mad amazin'
To think such problems can arise from minor confrontations
Now I'm contemplatin' in my bedroom pacin'
Dark clouds over my head, my heart's racin'
Suicide? Nah, I'm not a foolish guy
Don't even feel like drinkin' or even gettin' high
'Cause all that's gonna do really is accelerate
The anxieties that I wish I could alleviate
But wait, I've been through a whole lot of other shit before
So I oughta be able to withstand some more
But I'm sweatin' though, my eyes are turnin' red and yo
I'm ready to lose my mind, but instead I use my mind
I put down the knife and take the bullets out my 9
My only crime was that I'm too damn kind
And now some scandalous motherfuckers wanna take what's mine
But they can't take the respect that I've earned in my lifetime
And you know they'll never stop the furious force of my rhymes
So like they say, every dog has its day
And like they say, God works in a mysterious way
So I pray, rememberin' the days of my youth
As I prepare to meet my moment of truth
""You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free!""

Yo, I got one lyric pointed at your head for start
Another one is pointed at your weak-ass heart
Now if I pull the trigger on these fully-loaded lines
You're gonna wish I would've pulled a black 9
I mack dimes, crack the spines of the fake gangsters
Yeah the bitin' triflin' niggas and the studio pranksters
Yo, lookin' at the situation plainly: will you remain, G?
Or will you be looked upon strangely?
I reign as the articulator with the greater data
Revolvin' on the TASCAM much doper than my last jam
While others struggle to juggle tricky metaphors
I explore more to expose the core
A lot of emcees act stupid to me
And we have yet to see if they can match our longevity
But anyway, it's just another day
Another fake jack I slay with my spectac' rap display
Style's smooth but rugged, you can't push or shove it
You dig it and you dug it 'cause like money you love it
The king of monotone, with my own throne
Righteously violent prone, my words bring winds like cyclones
Stormin' your hideout, blockin' out your sunlight
Your image and your business were truly not done right
Throw up your He Allah Now Divine Saviours
You got no hand skills, there's no security to save ya
No pager, no celly, no drop top Benz-y
I came to bring your phony hip-hop to an ending
My art of war will leave you sore from the abuse
'Cause you must meet your moment of truth

They say it's lonely at the top in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
No one is untouchable, no man is bulletproof
We all must meet our moment of truth",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-moment-of-truth-lyrics
Above the Clouds,Moment of Truth,1998.0,"""It has come to our attention
That a mysterious force is loose somewhere in outer space""
""The mysteries of creation are there""
""Up in the sky?"" ""Up in the sky""
""The moon and the planets are there
And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there
And therefore, as we set sail, we ask God's blessing
On the most hazardous and dangerous
And greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked""
""Prepared for lift off""

I Self Lord and Master shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters shall be captured by Kings
Through the storms of days after
Unto the Earth from the Sun through triple darkness to blast ya
With a force that can't be compared
To any firepower, for it's mind power shared
The brainwave causes vessels to circulate
Like constellations reflect at night off the lake
Word to the Father and Mother Earth
Seekin' everlastin' life through this Hell for what it's worth
Look, listen and observe
And watch another C-Cipher pullin' my peeps to the curb
Heed the words, it's like ghetto style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell, turnin' a desert to a well
Experience the best teacher
Thoughts will spray like street sweepers
Little Daddy street preacher
Illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck, plus the DJ you respect
The seven and a half combined, over the front line
The ten-percenters promotin' slander in the airtime
Bear in mind, jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp blades, heavenly praise and dues are paid

Above the crowds, above the clouds
Where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual
Above the clouds, rainin' down, holdin' it down

Yeah, I leave scientists mentally scarred, triple extra large
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars
Poison bars from the Gods bust holes in your mirage
And catch a charge, shake 'em down like the riot squad
Invade your zone, ruin like Ancient Rome
I span the universe and return to Earth to claim my throne
The maker, owner, plus soul controller
Ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
Stand like Colossus, regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts on my life, so who to trust?
Who but us to supply ya with the fire?
The burnin' truth, 150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notified families, we shed tears and mourn
But our hands are on the ammo 'cause the battle still on
Sound the horn, we come rumblin' through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch somethin'
When we die hard, they'll build a monument to honor us with
Humongous effect in the world, we could've conquered it

Above the crowds, above the clouds
Where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual
Above the clouds, rainin' down, holdin' it down",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-above-the-clouds-lyrics

Like a freshly cut diamond

[Chorus: Guru & 
MC Lyte

Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty
Or real rap songs like ""C.R.E.A.M."" or ""My Melody""
Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought
Like respect in the hood that can't be bought
Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty
Or real rap songs like ""C.R.E.A.M."" or ""My Melody""
Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought
Like respect in the hood that can't be bought
Word up, diamonds
Like a freshly cut diamond
[Verse 1: Guru & 
Dres
]
Diamonds are forever like friends that'll kill for you
Went up in a jewelry store, burglary, steal for you
Build with you, split the diamond into ice blue
Thrice he tried to disrespect our kinship, I don't like you
And now you axed out the fam'
But I'm cashin' checks with Premier on this jam
Robin Leach, interviews on the beach
When we shake hands, nothin' but ice on the reach, and I teach
Like the Rap Reverend Ike without the perm', I preach
There's more you need to learn, I return for my streets
Gainin' my wealth, trainin' myself
For corny confrontation with haters who be playin' themselves
Diamonds are like my world of rap
Your rhymin', huh, it's like a world of crap
And a diamond is like a fly-ass girl that's strapped
And you can't beat that with a bat

Word up, diamonds

Diamonds (Diamonds), diamonds (Diamonds), yeah
Pick up the pen, write down the sins, cleanse
Lay that shit down, play it for friends
Make a few M's, then do it again
J. Cole, who'd have thought you woulda been rhymin' with ghosts
Guru flows forever like a diamond
The most could never afford the precious jewels
That's precisely why I'm blessin' you with clear-cut messages
I'm destined to invest in urban sections where depression rules
I hope to heal the destitute before I leave this vestibule
Between the heavens and the seven circles
Where some dead homies maybe rest, I plan to resurrect a few
I press the truth against the neck of devils
Look at the youth just like a precious pebble
Meant to be protected, mentally we let this
Poison of Western philosophy make us sloppy
We forgot we are the chosen
From hip-hop to astronomy, they copy what we showed 'em
Niggas be talkin' slick, but only try me over modems
In person they starstruck, they hearts flutter
I'm like the realest one you ever met
If you don't feel this one, give it a sec
Go live a little, let the years pass
Experience pain, watch the tears crash on to the floor
Hurt brings wisdom
Wisdom brings a whole 'nother sort of understandin'
Diamonds only worth what we demandin', uh, uh
And niggas payin' top-dollar
Once upon a time I paid a 100 for mine, now I'm a lot smarter

Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty
Or real rap songs like ""C.R.E.A.M."" or ""My Melody""
Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought
Like respect in the hood that can't be bought
Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty
Or real rap songs like ""C.R.E.A.M."" or ""My Melody""
Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought
Like respect in the hood that can't be bought

I rock diamonds that cut glass out of window panes
Baldhead Slick blazing tracks when the indo's flame
Rocks that bling, rocks that make them jock my team
Rocks that shine, rocks that keep my hand on my nine
Rocks that blind, make the High Rocks drop down
One of a kind, niggas best jet from the spot when I cock mine
Diamonds are like your man you always call fam
Diamonds are like your grandma you always call ma'am
Diamonds are like having the whole world in your hand
Diamonds are like the shows I ripped with no band
Rockin' your knot, stoppin' your plot
It's me, Baldhead Slick Duke, coppin' your block
For you it's only pain, for me it's only gain
Diamonds are like loyalty, iced out like royalty
Diamonds are like my wifey, so sweet the way she spoils me
(
So good
)
[Chorus: Guru & 
MC Lyte

Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty
Or real rap songs like ""C.R.E.A.M."" or ""My Melody""

Do you wanna mess with this
I'm one of the best yet
We got it
You can feel the realness
In this business of rap
Go ahead

Fresh out the gate again, time to raise the stakes again
Fatten my plate again, y'all cats know we always play to win
G-A-N-G to the Starr, son
Haters took this shit too far, son
So that's all for you, I'm wipin' out your whole team
I'll splatter your dreams with lyrics to shatter your schemes
The badder you seem, the more lies you tell
The more lies you sell, and by surprise, you fell
Into my deathtrap, right into my clutches
Stupid, you know the God must bless
Every single mic he touches
I've suffered, just so I could return harder
Wanna be the shit starter, fuck around, make you a martyr
I make you famous, turn around, then make you nameless
‘Cause you never understood how vital to me this rap game is
Save it and hold that, you catch a hot one
Rhymes chase a fake nigga down soon as I spot one

Full clip, do you wanna mess with this?
Gang Starr, I'm one of the best yet
I'm nice like that
It's all good in this business of rep
Full clip, do you wanna mess with this?
Gang Starr, I'm one of the best yet
I'm nice like that
It's all good, so I suggest you take a rest

So if you stand in my way, I'ma have to spray
Learn that if you come against me, son, you're gonna have to pray
Since back in the day I held the weight and kept my head up
They wanna see the god catch an L, it's all a set-up
I give no man or thing power over me
Why these niggas so jealous and looking sour over me?
I'm bolder, G, I'm like impossible to stop
I'm like that nigga in the ring with you impossible to drop
I'm like two magazines fully-loaded to your one
Plus, I ain't gonna quit spittin' 'til you're done
Plus, more than ever I got my whole shit together
More than a decade of hits that'll live forever
Catchin' rep off my name, you're bound to fry
Know how many niggas that I know is down to die?
We never fail, and we ain't never been frail
You niggas talk crime, but you scared of jail

Full clip, do you wanna mess with this?
Gang Starr, I'm one of the best yet
I'm nice like that
It's all good in this business of rep
Full clip, do you wanna mess with this?
Gang Starr, I'm one of the best yet
I'm nice like that
It's all good
So I suggest you take a rest

Attackin' like a slick Apache, lyrics are trigger-happy
Blowing back your wig piece
Just for the way you're looking at me
Cock back, blaow, I hit you up right now
I don't know why so many of y'all wanna be thugs anyhow
Face the consequence of your childish nonsense
I could make your head explode just by my lyrical content
Get you in my scope and metaphorically snipe ya
I never liked ya, I gas that ass and then ignite ya
The flamethrower, make your peeps afraid to know ya
How many times I told ya? Play your position, small soldier!
My heart is colder, makes me wanna resort to violence
Stop beating me in the head, son, nah, I'm not buyin' it
I'm ready to blast, ready to surpass and harass
I'm ready to flip, yeah, I'm ready to dip with all the cash
I hold my chrome steady with a tight grip
So watch your dome already, 'cause this one might hit

Full clip, do you wanna mess with this?
Gang Starr, I'm one of the best yet
I'm nice like that
It's all good in this business of rap
Full clip, do you wanna mess with this?
Gang Starr, I'm one of the best yet (The-the-the best yet)
I'm nice like that

Work,Moment of Truth,1998.0,"Aiyo, I'm gonna be on ti-dop, that's all my eyes can see
Victory is mine, yeah surprisingly
I've been laying, waiting for your next mistake
I put in work and watch my status escalate

Now, I'm gon' start collecting props, connecting plots
Networking like a conference ‘cause the nonsense is yet to stop
Jakes shake me down, haters wanna take me down
Break me down, CLAP! – all they heard was a sound
Yo, I scoped it out, I took your weak dream and choked it out
Your bitch don't really got no ass, she just poked it out
On the D-low, I'm saying you versus me though?
We can do this shit right here in front of your people
See, time is money, kid and BS walks
And to me it's funny, kid when you meatheads talk
I see feds stalk, they wanna dig up the dirt, son
Is it me they hawk? ‘Cause I be putting in work, son

Aiyo, I'm gonna be on ti-dop, that's all my eyes can see
Victory is mine, yeah surprisingly
I've been laying, waiting for your next mistake
I put in work and watch my status escalate

You cornballs get stonewalled, blackballed, I own y'all
The veteran, running my plan, I'm the better man
Crazy raw, doing my job like the mob
Blazing y'all and disappearing in the fog
Or a mist and chicks can't resist what I kick
They be begging for attention or some more of the dillznick
Word up, baby, someone may have to get hurt up, baby
Shit is mad shady, but I got to get the gravy
Platinum respect like the force of a TEC
Keep you hitting the deck, feeling heat in your chest
Banging your thoughts with the hot onslaught
A kid got shot on the spot for going where he should not
Viciously, I make history instantly
Those other lame-ass loser-ass niggas, they can't fuck with me
I'm doing my thing now to lamp later on
Paid in the shade with some fly gators on
But now I'm grimy as they get, mud on my pants and shirt
I bet you niggas out here know, I be putting in work

Aiyo, I'm gonna be on ti-dop, that's all my eyes can see
Victory is mine, yeah surprisingly
I've been laying, waiting for your next mistake
I put in work and watch my status escalate",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-work-lyrics
DWYCK,Hard to Earn,1994,"Aww yeah, it’s another Gang Starr sure shot, uh!
Featuring the one and only, handl’it handl’it, Roy, Nice & Smooth
Hey, Gang Starr has gots to be the sure shot
Nice & Smooth has gots to be the sure shot
Gang Starr has gots to be the sure shot
Nice & Smooth has gots to be the sure shot

Greg Nice! Greg N-I-C-E
Dame un beso,
 ah oui oui
Rock for a fee, not for free
Maybe I'll do it for charity
Now my employer or my employee
Is making Greg N-I-C-E very M-A-D
Don't ever ever think of jerking me
I work too hard for my royalty
Put lead in your ass and drink a cup of tea
Peace to Red Alert and Kid Capri
Ooohh la la, ah oui oui
I say Muhammad Ali, you say Classius Clay
I say butter, you say Parkay
It's alright if you wanna make a sway
I'm away uptown, took the deuce to the tre
I originate, they duplicate
I praise the Lord and keep the faith
It's alright, keep biting at the bait
'92, uh! One year later
Peace out, Premier, take me out with the fader

I chant 'eeny, meeny, miny, moe'
I wreck the mic like a pimp pimps hoes
Here's how it goes: I am a genius, I mean this
I shape this, you'll tape this, I'm kinda fiendish
You wish that you could come into my neighborhood
Meaning my mental state, still I'm 5-foot-8
Crazy as I wanna be, ‘cause I make it orderly
You could say I'm sorta the boss so get lost
The brother who will make you change opinions
Dominions, I'm in them when it's time to kick shit from
The heart, plus I get a piece of the action
Feeling satisfaction from the street crowd reaction
Chumps pull guns when they feel afraid
Too late, when they dip in the kick, they get sprayed
Lemonade was a popular drink and it still is
I get more props and stunts than Bruce Willis
A poet like Langston Hughes
And can't lose when I cruise out on the expressway
Leaving the bodega I say ""suave""
Premier's got more beats than barns got hay
Clips are inserted into my gun
So I can take the money, never have to run

Yo Keithy E, I left my Phillie at home, do you have another?
I wanna get blunted, my brother
Now, may I make a mark then make a spark
Over this phat track – or should I say dope beat?
Subtract, delete
All of the wick wack that wanna be abstract
But they lack the new knack that's coming from way way back
Hey yo, Premier, please pass that buddha sack
You heard we quit? No way, bullshit!
I told you before we come back with more hits
I provide bright flavor, so you can sketch me
Do me a favor, don't try to catch me
Slightly ahead of the game, I'm not a lame
Ask him, he'll tell you the same he knows my name
Smooth, I drop jewels like paraphernalia
I'm infallible, not into failure
Like a rhinoceros, my speed is prosperous
And pure knowledge expands from my esophagus
I write in the night to bring truth to the light
My dialogue is my own, ‘cause Smooth B will never bite

After the tour quits, I come back with more hits
After the tour quits, I come back with more hits
After the tour quits, I come back with more hits",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-dwyck-lyrics

""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""

No way, you'll never make it
Come with the weak shit, I'll break it
Step into my zone, mad rhymes will stifle ya
Lines like rifles go blast when I kick some ass
A lot of rappers be like one-time wonders
Couldn't say a fly rhyme if there was one right under, their noses
I hate those motherfuckin' posers
But I'm so real, to them it's scary
And with my unique skills, nah, you can't compare me
And no, we don't make wack tracks
And all the suckers get pushed back when I'm kickin' real facts
I represent, set up shit like a tent, boy
You're paranoid 'cause you're a son like Elroy
And you'd be happy as hell to get a record deal
Maybe your soul you'd sell to have mass appeal

""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""

Oh yes, I'm greater than all MC's when I breeze
Give me room, please
I be like fascinatin' when I be updatin'
Cuttin' off wack kids, pullin' their trump cards
I thump hard, and make 'em say that I'm God
Niggas be pretendin' they're hardcore
Never know the meanin' of (raw)
But I get props like a slogan
And no man could ever try to diss when I kicks my jam
Lyrically def and connectin', complete mic-wreckin'
No double-checkin', vocals kill like weapons
But if I have to, I go all out with no mic
Yeah, that's right, cause I survived mad fights
And for my peeps I truly care
Cause without some of them I wouldn't be here
And they all know how I feel
'Cause suckers be like playin' themselves to have mass appeal

""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""

I know I'm dope, but don't wet that
I've suffered setbacks, but now I'm makin' greenbacks
Just like baggy slacks, I'm crazy hip-hop
Check one two and you don't stop
Your head'll bop when I drop my crop of pure bomb
Just like the seashore, I'm calm
But wild, with my monotone style
Because I don't need gimmicks
Gimme a fly beat and I'm all in it
Word is bond, I go on and on
For you it's tragic, I got magic like wands
So I'ma end this lecture and I bet ya
Those who kick dirt, in due time I'm gonna get ya
'Cause I be kickin' the real
While they be losin' the race tryin' to chase mass appeal

You Know My Steez,Moment of Truth,1997.0,"That makes me know that what we're doing
We had the right idea in the beginning
And and we just need to maintain our focus and elevate
We what we do we update our formulas
We have certain formulas but we update em (oh right)
With the times and everything y'know
So y'know the rhyme style is elevated
The style of beats is elevated but it's still Guru and Premier
And it's always a message involved

The real (The real)
Hip-hop (Hip-hop)
MCing(MCing), and
DJing (DJing), from your own mind (from your own mind,)
You know? (you know?)
I, I guess right now we should start the show

Who's the suspicious character
Strapped with the sounds profound
Similar to rounds spit by Derringers
You're in the Terrordome, like my man Chuck D said
It's time to dethrone you clones and all you knuckleheads
‘Cause MC's have used up extended warranties
While real MC's and DJ's are a minority
But right about now, I use my authority
‘Cause I'm like the Wizard, and you look lost like Dorothy
The horror be when I return for my real people
Words that split wigs hitting like some double Desert Eagles
Sporting caps pulled low, and baggy slacks
Subtracting all the rappers who lack over Premier's tracks
Severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
So as I have in the past, I whoop ass
Dropping lyrics that be hotter than sex and candlewax
And one-dimensional MC's can't handle that
While the world's revolving, on its axis
I come with mad love and plus the illest warlike tactics
The wilderness is filled with this
So many people searching for false bliss
I'm here with the skills you've missed
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
Sort of like the master builder when I make my way home
You know my steez

You know my steez
Let 'em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live, Keep it live)
To the beat y'all

The beat is sinister, Primo makes you relax
I'm like the minister, when I be lacing the wax
I be bringing salvation through the way that I rap
And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that
Work through worldly problems, I got the healing power
When the mic's within my reach, I'm feeling more power
Stealing at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
It's often easier for one to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines take flight
The apparatus gets blessed
And suckers get put to rest
No more of the unpure, I got the cure for this mess
The wackness is spreading like the plague
MC's lucked up and got paid
But still can't make the fucking grade
How many times are wannabe's gonna lie?
Yo, they must wanna fry
They can't touch the knowledge I personify
I travel through the darkness, carrying my torch
The illest soldier, when I'm holding down the fort
You know my steez
(You know my steez)

Let em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
The mic

On the microphone, you know that I'm one of the best yet
Some punks ain't paid all of their debts yet
Trying to be fly, riding high on the jet-set
With juvenile rhymes, making fake-ass death threats
Big deal, like En Vogue, here's something you can feel
Styles more tangible, and image more real
For some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts
When it's time to go all out you be like, ""Damn, he flipped!""
Now I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit
Got the lyrical full clip, giving you a verbal asswhip
Don't trip, it's the gifted prolific one
Known as Bald Head Slick  why is the press all on my di-dick?
My style be wilder than a kamikaze pilot
Don't try it, I'm about to start more than a frigging riot
Styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas
Yo, them motherfuckers are harrassable
For I be speaking from my parables and carry you beyond
The mic's either a magic wand
Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
Then I grab your palm, no pulse, you're gone
And if you thought we'd lose our niche
In this rap shit, you way wrong
I stay up, I stay on, shine bright, like neon
Your song's pathetic, synthetic, like Rayon
Fat beats, they play on, want dope rhymes, put me on

Scandalous, money greed and lust
In this trife life, there ain't nobody you can trust
Plus there's no justice, it's just us
In fact, watchin' yo back it be must
And each and everyday around the way gats bust
And jealous so-called friends'll try to set you up
It's called betrayal

Check the horror scene
The kid was like twelve or thirteen
Never had the chance like other kids to follow dreams
Watched his father catch two in the dome and to the spleen
Nothin' but blood everywhere, these streets are mean
They spared his life, but killed his moms and his sister Jean
Of course over some drug shit
His pops was on some ill-out, spill your guts, on some thug shit
Didn't know his boys was on some shady ass no love shit
His pops got played out though, with silencers they laid him out yo
Took his stash and all the cash and left 'em, tied up on the couch yo
With tape over his mouth, so he couldn't cry out
Cause his dad was the nigga with clout
Survival of the fittest so they split his wig no doubt
Despite the stocking caps he noticed the same cat, who used to give him dough
And taught him, to use the same gat
Supposed to be an Uncle, fam and all that
He could tell that it was him cause he had on the same slacks, he wore when
He took him to Meadowlands racetrack
Why did he flip and go out like that?
It's called betrayal

Scandalous, money greed and lust
In this trife life, there ain't nobody you can trust
Plus there's no justice, it's just us
In fact, watchin' yo back it be must
And each and everyday around the way gats bust
And jealous so-called friends'll try to set you up
It's called betrayal

A betrayal
Punk ass niggas
It's called betrayal
He on a mission to become a ball player
Flip big Benz's, flossin' all gators
Had it all mapped out, a 6-8 12th grader
Fresh outta school and finna go make paper
He had a brother who was hustlin', collectin' his change
Never let his baby brother stick his neck in the game
Told him all he had to do is just enjoy the ride
And he ain't have to worry about money cause that's in time
So now he's pacin' as the time moves slowly
Can't wait to face Shaquille in the paint and school Kobe
Kept his grades and stayed up under neighborhood functions
And then a group of knuckleheads came through dumping
So now he's sittin' on the sidewalk bleeding
Fell into a puddle of his own blood and stopped breathin'
And everybody in the neighborhood still grievin'
But destiny caught up with his ass and he got even
And all the cryin' in the world ain't goin' to bring him back
His brother, sittin' at the wake wipin' tears from his mother's eyes
Why'd the game have to go and take the young boys life
Only the wicked live shife, payin' the price
While he's starin' at the shell his brother's soul once held
The trigger man made bail
And you, wouldn't pay the boy his mail, and sacrificed your fuckin' family
That's betrayal
Betrayal (echoes)

JFK 2 LAX,Moment of Truth,1998.0,"Yo
Yo Premier?
Yeah whassup G?
That trip to L.A., may be delayed
Why whassup I'm on my way to the airport now
Yeah well your boy Guru got knocked
WHAT?!
I don't know what this is about, sounds crazy man
Something about a gun
""The court calls Keith Elam to the stand
Please approach the bench.""

Yo they got me handcuffed, I'm down in central booking
Things are fucked up, the way my future's looking
But I'm too fly, I'mma change this scenario
Make some power moves and tighten up my bankroll
Chumps are leary though, they see me as a threat
I'm like the black Dutch Schultz when you get me upset
5-0 makes me wanna flip, Larry Davis style
Got a nigga depressed, while he's awaiting trial
It's OK though, cause from grey skies comes blue
Through darkness comes light and I be known as the Guru
And this I certify we all should be alerted by
The traps within the system, our youth is getting murdered by
The D.A. says they got me on a felony
I'm trying to live my life, so what the fuck is you telling me?
The streets are war, that's what brothers carry weapons for
And I take the weight as I did before
The next thing you know, they got me on the radio
A rapper arrested, suckers showing me on video
Of course I know, that I'm a role model
But yo this rap life is real life sometimes it's full throttle
Right now I gotta think about me fuck the industry
You gets no love, except those who support me
What's the story, what happened when I went to L.A.?
Mixing shit up, no not there I got family
Nothing happened, mind your business yo step
You know we connect, JFK 2 LAX

They wanna lock us all up, and throw away the key
Don't wanna see us come up, don't wanna see us making G's
Long as we know this is the key to our destruction
Let's make moves no discussion

Peace to my man Hass
, an Orange Man paying the cost
All the twenty-five to lifers all my brothers getting tossed
Into the system, supposed to rehabilitate
It's why you gotta regulate your own mindstate
Read, study lessons and build your inner power
The next level, doesn't tolerate cowards
For example, I know this rich Nigerian
Powerful American that's proud to be an African
He asked me why do all us brothers be getting trapped
I told him I'd explain it, broke it down in a rap
Whether you got naps, braids waves or no hair
Without esteem for yourself nigga, you going nowhere
And you can swagger like you rude as Josey Wales
Unorganized revolt almost always mostly fails
Give up the savage ways, be effective soldiers
To elevate the mental is to be poor no more
There's war in the streets, prepared men know best
I rhyme as live as it gets, JFK 2 LAX
They're always making trouble yo, against the righteous
Killing us in cold blood, those beasts, those vipers
And as I sit feeling the pain in my wrist
I vow to myself that I'mma change this shit
Or at least I gotta try or part of me will die
And only by action will any ideas solidify
So I inhale, exhale as I ponder
This grown man will make mistakes no longer
I've been there, I've seen how they make us fall victim
To their tricknowledgy, with no apology I diss em
And so I rip facts to dope tracks I caress
You're gonna hear about it, from JFK 2 LAX",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-jfk-2-lax-lyrics

One of the meanest and the cleanest
And still I'm kind of fiendish when I'm at this
Been doin' this for eons, peons best to catch this
Vision of excellence precise rappin' ability
'Bout to make some dead presidents, mackin' a million, G
The money though, it's got people acting funny yo
As soon as some niggas get some light, they be like dummies yo
Products and puppets and pawns, gettin' played out
When authentic niggas step up, respect be layed out
Major effect to your sector, I'm the corrector
Live and direct, wavin' my mic like a sceptor
Supreme exalted, universal leader
Descendent of the kings and queens, the overseer
The overlord, cream of the crop, crème de la crème
Spent years building with cats in the streets so they my men
Again, Gang Starr has done it
Remember too much jewels back in the days? You'd have to run it
Check it, the ground be hot under our feet
So we be listenin' to beats to keep the cypher complete
Whether you kids be holdin' on the block all day
Or you be puffin' lye out in the back hallway
Or whether you bein' schooled or in the library
Wherever you are, Baby Pah, realize that your essence
Is divine, son, and let it shine, son, as we refine, son
Ayo, this shit'll blow your mind, son, we're royalty

Wherever I go, I want to take nothin' less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I have to stand out from all the rest
Whatever I do, wherever I go
I want to take nothin' less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I just wanna stand out from all the rest

And all the girls they want to spoil me
My honey anoints me with oils, G
After work she greets me and treats me like royalty
Works with me, givin' herself by my side
She don't sweat me for loot, my fame or my ride
A lot of ladies out there be lookin' lovely
But they don't got no control of their life, inside they're ugly
Word to Bugsy, and to Red Alert
Sway and Tech, and Funkmaster Flex to make your head jerk
Chicks go beserk when they see us in the spot
K-Ci, JoJo and Primo, creepin' to the top
And to the sweethearts out there breakin' hearts
While we're takin' part of this hip-hop art
Listen yo, the best way, it ain't always the fast way
And yes, the best way, it ain't always to act nasty
I'll open up the door always before you pass me
Baby Doll, because you're royalty

Wherever I go, I want to take nothin' less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I have to stand out from all the rest
Whatever I do, wherever I go
I want to take nothin' less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I just wanna stand out from all the rest

To whom it may concern
This goes out to anybody who’s doing the bullshit, straight up
Yo, everybody’s calling me, my lawyer, everybody on this, ‘yo did you scratch such n such name?
Or this, that, and the third on the record for a hook?’
Y’all keep calling me on that shit and y’all supposed to be hip hoppers and all that, and letting the industry control the rules of the hip hop world that we made?
Y’all need to knock that shit off, that’s some greedy-ass, fake bullshit!
Knock that shit off for real!
Y'know'm sayin'?
And when that shit come and slap you in the face, that greed, I’ma be right there laughing at y’all…
And one other thing… What’s the deal with you break-record cats putting out all the original records that we sample from and snitching by puttin us on the back of it sayin we used stuff?
You *know* how that go!
Stop doing that, y’all are violatin', straight up and down!
Word up, man, I’m sick of this shit
Y’all muthafuckas really don’t know what this hip hop is all about
So while you keep on faking the funk, we gonna keep on walkin' through the darkness, carryin' our torches
Underground will live forever, baby
We just like roaches, never dyin', always livin'…
And on that note, let's get back to the program…",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-royalty-lyrics
The Militia,Moment of Truth,1998.0,"""Here's a bulletin from state police, Princeton Junction.""
""The militia...
Certain individuals of unidentified nature
Is now under complete control""
""
Hip-hop is not, what it is today..
""
""It's the real *echoes*... it's the (militia)""

If heads only knew how I felt about the rap game
They'd relocate, and change their fuckin' name
I eradicate move fakers, roll with coat shakers
Give dap to mad money makers
Shared cells with life takers, have sex with rump shakers
I make moves so I'mma earthquaker
I've been known to instill fear
Although the world may be round, we still trapped in the square
City light, got me buggin' and trife
Some die by the gun, some die by the knife
It's all right, like a game of spades I'm trump tight
Premier hit me with music to ensure that it thump right
And my flight, will be taken solely at 
night
'Cause that's when the freaks come out
, no doubt
And in the dark hours is when I will shower
With the knowledge of my trade to get paid
Still I make moves like a snake in the grass, roundabout
I be dickin it down while you be assed out
Puff mad L's but never passed out
And if I'm caught up in a jam I blast my way out
There'll be no lettin' up, just straight shuttin' up
Or we'll start the wettin' up
Lyrical infrared sceptor never miss you
Big Shug, Guru, Freddie Foxxx, The Militia, militia

Everybody's spittin' it, the rhyme is hot
'Cause it's Big Shug, Guru, and Freddie the Foxxx
When Premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop
It's The Militia
Everybody's spittin' it, the rhyme is hot
'Cause it's Big Shug, Guru, and Freddie the Foxxx
When Premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop
It's The Militia

Yo; I ain't one to succumb to no man, but to command
And scoop up the troops when it's time to take a stand
Emphatically, deep strategies leave casualties
I creep gradually, 'til everybody knows
That I got more flows than Rosebud got hoes
The anger inside had me trapped
Til I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
For big stacks, watch your back when I send em in
Caught you tremblin', my name and face you're rememberin'
Several attempts, but nah bitch, you'll never win
Rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs we'll be severin'
Take you to the mat, peep that, you should keep back
My ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
That I walk on, I meditate while you talk on
And gossip, so I drop my hot shit; fully loaded Glock clips
So get the fuck out my block, kid
As nights turn to days, days go back to nights, we be speaking it right
And keeping it tight up in the street life
I meet life, head on, no holds barred
Born with a heart of gold, now mostly cold and scarred
En guard, choose your weapon, or get to steppin'
Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before, and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare
We cleverly stalked ya, your fam'll miss ya
The war's on, that's why we formed The Militia

Everybody's spittin' it, the rhyme is hot
'Cause it's Big Shug, Guru, and Freddie the Foxxx
When Premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop
It's The Militia

You niggas owe me for my rhymes, I come to collect
For you dope fiend niggas in rap, I here to inject, check
My style is butter baby, spread it around
But when you niggas don't flow it right and fuck up my sound
I get down; 
in '89 I spit a ""buck"" in the face
Of every MC that came in the place, a scar you'll never erase
MC's are only recognized for their flows
I'm worldwide for the bitches, that I turned into hoes
You heard me spit it on Jew-elz, that's how it goes
For all them faking ass niggas and how I bust up their nose
And while your, nose is drippin', and drainin' blood
I'll be standing over you screamin', ""Nigga, WHAT, WHAT?! Nigga WHAT?!""
Niggas feel my presence, like I'm right in their palm
'Cause a stormy day is coming, when you see me so calm, it's on
No more twin Glocks, they jam up my plays
Now its twin .40 calibre Walther PPK's
I'm in the control of my game, you must respect me like The Ref
Uh-huh, you disrespect *gun clicks* you get the tech
I turn you fake niggas on and off, like I'm the clapper
I rob so many niggas, they should call me Jack the Rapper
I'll the illest nigga doing this, dead or alive
Gloria Gaynor on you motherfuckers, I Will Survive
You can try to come at me, but do you want the kick back?
You step inside the cage of a pit, and you get bit back, huh
My war is so tight, my drama so ill
Beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
I push these lyrics through any MC, and make it burn
So the niggas who be rhyming next, will miss a turn
When you speak of who's the dopest MC, I don't come up
But when you speak of who's the livest MC, I stay one up, what's up?
I got stripes like you got strikes and bogus mikes
Do what bitch niggas do best - bite
Y'all niggas can't make up a law that I don't overrule, overthrow
Preem' brought Bumpy this track so I'ma let you know
Before I slide I'mma leave you this jewel
Even mechanics walk around with they tools

Robbin Hood Theory,Moment of Truth,1998.0,"Guru: Peace Brother Elijah
Elijah Shabazz: Hey peace Guru, how you doing?
Guru: I'm maintaining, just been thinking though man
About the situation for today's youth man, the seeds man
What's your opinion on that?
Elijah Shabazz: Mmm that's strange I was thinkin the same thing
Something I read in the holy Qur'an how it says
""Has thou seen him who belies religion?
That is one who is rough, to the orphan.""
And no matter what we say our religion is
Whether it's Islam, Christianity, Juddaism, Buddha-ism, Old School-ism or New School-ism
If we're not schooling the youth WITH wisdom
Then the sins of the father will visit the children
And that's not keepin it real...
That's keeping it - *WRONG*

Now that we're getting somewhere, you know we got to give back
For the youth is the future no doubt that's right and exact
Squeeze the juice out, of all the suckers with power
And pour some back out, so as to water the flowers
This world is ours, that's why the demons are leery
It's our inheritance; this is my Robin Hood Theory... Robin Hood Theory

I seek Sun, deceive none, for each one must teach one
At least one must flow and show the structure, of freedom
It's me Dunn, cause petty things we don't need 'em
Let's focus to create somethin great, for all that sees them
They innocent, they know not what they face
While politicians save face genius minds lay to waste
If I wasn't kickin rhymes I'd be kickin down doors
Creatin social change and defendin the poor
The God's always been militant, and ready for war
We're gonna snatch up the ringleaders send em home in they drawers
But first where's the safe at? Let's make em show us
And tell em hurry up, give up the loot that they owe us
We bringin it back, around the way to our peeps
Cause times are way too deep, we know the Code of the Streets
Meet your defeat; this is my Robin Hood Theory... my Robin Hood Theory

I floss my rhymes like dentals, my mental's presidential
From the wild ghetto districts to the plush residential
Essential, would be the message that I send you
I meant to, elevate at every venue
Pops told me to pursue what is true, and nothing other
And nowadays I pave the way for troops of my young brothers
Necessary by all means, sort of like Malcolm
Before it's too late; I create, the best outcome
So I take this opportunity, yes to ruin the
Devilish forces fucking up my black community
And we ain't doing no more interviews
Til we get paid out the frame, like motherfucking Donahue
We're taking over radio, and wack media
Cause systematically they getting greedier and greedier
Conquering turfs with my ill organization
Takin out the man while we scan the information
You wanna rhyme you best await son
You can't even come near, if you ain't got our share
You front on us this year, consider yourself blown out of here
Yeah... by my Robin Hood Theory

Squeeze the juice out, of all the suckers with power
And pour some back out, so as to water the flowers
This world is ours, that's why the demons are leery
It's our inheritance; this is my Robin Hood Theory

God is Universal, he is the Ruler Universal
For those who can't follow that spells GURU when in my circle
I see all sides of my culture...
Design my thoughts like a sculpture
And chumps they wanna get with me cause I'm another entity
I'm sent to be, leadin the army of the century
Mention me, and snakes will retreat, eventually...
... due to my Robin Hood Theory

Now that we're getting somewhere, you know we got to give back
For the youth is the future no doubt that's right and exact

And pour some back out, so as to water the flowers

Remind you of a corner bodega and that Olde E behavior
On play, but I ain't trying to scuffle with chumps
My long joints got the culture power plus the double pump
Troublesome to anyone who stands in the way
I'll stand and I'll spray, fuck if your man's in the way
Your girl want me ‘cause I do it better than you

I don't want to talk and I ain't trying to fight with your man
Trying to get it over quick, leave you right where you stand

You just mad, you will never be as nice as I am
D-Block, Gang Starr, leave you right where you stand, what

All my money into haze and into dope?
‘Cause right now, I'm currently a slave for Interscope
Respect first, then money – basic shit
If you got niggas under pressure, you could take they shit
Listen, I'ma leave you right where you stand
Have the ambulance
Pass your Timberlands off right to your man

Just mad ‘cause you'll never be as nice as I am

I see you got the fear of God in you
We'll tear your heart in two
Too bad you didn't know what you got into

My name carry weight, decapitate most vipers

Flow is angry like I'm in your face with heaters
Chasin' beavers? Nah, I don't ever have to do that
P.I. till I die, and then I laugh at you cats
You happy perhaps ‘cause you got dough and bitches
But no love in the streets, only from 'mos and snitches
Only from the meat-lappin', suckers won't see it happen
Cross that line, then it's time for the heat-clappin'
I do my thing like the whole planet depends on me
I got game to make Janet wanna spend on me

So let's get a car, you know, a fly whip
Get a dent puller, screwdriver and be off quick
With a dope ride, yeah, and a rowdy crew
We can bag us a Benz and an Audi, too
Even a jeep or a van, goddamn, we're getting ours, yo
Take a trip up the strip, and be like stars so
It doesn't matter if the cops be scoping
They can't do jack, that's why a young brother's hopin'
To do anything, anywhere, anyplace
Buckwild in another court case
It's the code of the streets

They might say we're a menace to society
But at the same time I say ""Why is it me?""
Am I the target, for destruction?
What about the system, and total corruption?
I can't work at no fast-food joint
I got some talent, so don't you get my point?
I'll organize some brothers and get some crazy loot
Selling D-R-U-G-S and clocking dollars, troop
Cause the phat dough, yo, that suits me fine
I gotta have it so I can leave behind
The mad poverty, never having always needing
If a sucker steps up, then I leave him bleeding
I gotta get mine, I can't take no shorts
And while I'm selling, here's a flash report
Organized crime, they get theirs on the down low
Here's the ticket, wanna bet on a horse show?
You gotta be a pro, do what you know
When you're dealing with the code of the streets

Nine times out of ten I win, with the skills I be wielding
Got the tenth one kneeling, let me express my feelings
Guru has never been one to play a big shot
It's just the styles I got that keep my mic hot
And fuck turning my back to the street scene
It gives me energy, so I'mma keep fiends
Coming, just to get what I'm selling
Maybe criminal or felon dropping gems on your melon
So keep abreast to the Gang Starr conquest
Underground ruffnecks, pounds of respect
I've never been afraid to let loose my speech
My brothers know I kick the code of the streets",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-code-of-the-streets-lyrics

Yo.. just because I want to it don't mean I will
And just because I'm angry it don't mean I'd kill
And just because she looks good it don't mean I'd hit it
And just because I'm horny, it don't mean I'm widdit
Just because I make records, don't mean that I'm gassed
And just because I'm rappin, don't mean I chase ass
Just because I'm whylin don't mean I can't stop
I got discipline baby, and I use it a lot
People, here's somethin that you should be considerin
Things could turn bitter when, you don't use discipline
You might wake up the next day, upset and in fear
Buggin out, yappin bout, ""How the fuck did I get here?
Who the hell is this stranger, starin all in my face?""
Now you wishin you hadn't positioned yourself, in that place
Think just in case you shoulda took more precaution
A good time can become a nightmare so often
Like this nigga I know, that met these chicks on tour
They rocked him to sleep, robbed his ass for cash galore
Skated off in the night, without a trace or a hint
Scheamin tantalizin him, dressed up in lace and shit
Caught that kid out there, all high and dumbfounded
Made him think he was gettin some pussy
He just knew he was gonna pound it
Situations like this, will make you think twice
That's why instead of preachin death in my songs, I breathe life

Baby won't you take the time (take the time)
Let me know what's on your mind (your mind)
Just because I'm yours don't make it right
(don't make it right)
Baby won't you take the time (bay-bee..)
Let me know what's on your mind (I'm waiting..)
Slow down baby now let's make it right (on your love..)
(I like you..)

Tycoon thug, he made a ten thousand dollar investment
Now he's not to be messed with, makes the girls get undressed quick
He's on some big muscled chest shit, posted by the exit
That's my man, he's the owner, yeah he be on some next shit
Said we'll make a few million by the next millenium
Told me to keep droppin jewels like a triggerman, puttin lead in him
Like Flavor said, I tell these hoes to, kill the noise
You know your Pops told you, watch them New York boys
All night, the ladies be like up in my mug
Tranquilin and trance dancin up in my drug
Fly honies, they hold me down like always
The same cat that used to get blunted down in the hallways
I love the cutie pies, never the doodie pies
I got discipline, I want the crew to rise
Situations like this'll make you think twice
Instead of preachin death in my songs, I breathe life

Baby won't you take the time (uh-huh)
Let me know what's on your mind (your mind)
Just because I'm yours don't make it right
(don't make it right)
Baby won't you take the time (bay-bee..)
Let me know what's on your mind (I'm waiting..)
Slow down baby now let's make it right (on your love..)
(I like you..)

Ladies, here's somethin that we should be considerin
Things could get bitter when, you don't use discipline
Imaginin yourself livin lavish and plush
Hangin with the cat who be spendin cabbage and buyin stuff
However, don't be too clever with your endeavor
And don't let too many men, receive your treasure
Most cats, be thinkin with they bozack
I admit in the past I was tryin to break these hoes backs
Escape, without givin up a dime
You know them fly ladies had a good fuckin time
Coppin me some Timberland with a jacket to match it
Girls nowadays wanna pigeon for chickenscratch
And I ain't givin up nathan
Long as my game expands, it's my discipline to hate 'em
Situations like this, will make you think twice
That's why instead of preachin death in my songs, I breathe life
And just because I want to it don't mean I will
And just because I'm angry it don't mean I'd kill
And just because she looks good, it don't mean I'd hit it

Just because I make records, don't mean that I'm gassed
And just because I'm rappin, don't mean I chase ass
And just because I'm whylin, don't mean I can't stop
I got discipline baby whether you do or not

Baby won't you take the time (the time)
Let me know what's on your mind (your mind)
Just because I'm yours don't make it right

""Yo, man, how much money you got?""

I used to guzzle 40's and own a beat up Caddy
Since the hood still love me, I'll turn the heat up, Daddy
I went from mackin' fly honeys on the train
To straight relaxin' on the beach, countin' money, gettin' brain
Soon as you rappers get a chance you wanna floss a lot
You buy a iced out watch because it cost a lot
Then you in the club, stylin' with dough
Profilin' with hoes that we boned a while ago
You rookies haven't done enough laps around the track
You had one hot single, but then your album sounds wack
Son, you bore me with your war stories
You ain't even do that shit, so that's just more stories
How you expect us to take you seriously?
The look in my eye, punk, has got you scared of me
I'm blastin' your sons, I'm snatchin' your funds
You catch a royal ass-whoopin', you've been askin' for one

Bitch, you don't even know the half about me
I bring it straight to your chest, ask your staff about me
I'm just a little bit older, plus a whole lot wiser
I might advise ya, or I might pulverize ya
I can visit any city, get respect in the street
While you alone in your room, shook to death of the streets
I'll take a second to speak, I keep my weapon in reach
I ain't talkin' romance, but you'll get swept off your feet
I keeps a ghetto chick that loves to blast and she peddle shit
Groupies fake moves, I get her to settle shit
You can't compare to the status right here
Legendary worldwide, we can battle right here
Listen, Junior, I'ma tear back your wig
This ain't TV, but I'll show you what a ""fear factor"" is
Stop grillin' me, and all that frontin' is killin' me
You leave me no choice but to hurt your feelings, G

Ex Girl to Next Girl,Daily Operation,1992.0,"You know I used to be a player, fly girl layer and a heartbreaker
Lovemaker, backbreaker but then I made a
Mistake yes I fell in love with this ill chick
Sweatin' me for money, my name and the dilsnick
My homeboys told me drop her cuz it would be to my benefit
She used to say I'd better quit hanging with those derelicts
Romancing is my thing but I can't swing with no scheming hoes
Wherever my Beemer goes you know that I'm driving
Surviving in the 90's is a must so I trust
That everyone listen up as my vocals give thrust
I bust my rhymes first never chasing a skirt
Do much work while other suckas need more time to rehearse
Now back to the ex-girls, ex-lovers, ex-friends
It made me mad to find that she was only after my ends
She phones me and goes on about her new life now
I wish she knew right now
I think she's busted let's discuss it
When I was with her no trust, just fights
Just the he-say-she-say and the neighborhood highlights
Now I got my new girl or as I say my baby doll
But I'm still gettin' crazy calls, my ex-girl's got balls
Don't wanna play the field cuz I get lovin' at home base
Don't gimme no long face just exit with grace
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, much respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl cuz I'm on with the next girl

(Sample x6) Cuz girls look so good
Next x5

She had much loot, liked to buy me fresh-dipped gear
Liked to have me near cuz of my savoir faire
The time we shared was brief cuz I needed relief
From her high-classed antics and all her conceit
Now she's crying wolf and I like don't wanna hear that
I told her the bear facts when things started out
She whines and she pouts about how I did her bad, yo
But she tried to buy me
Even tempt me with the hiney
I fell for a sec cuz the clothes were real fly
I could almost feel I
Would give into her whims
Her thoughts were erratic, sporadic, crazy in nature
I told her hey look yo, I can no longer date ya
Tried to pimp with bank and fell short, your ship sank
Many thanks for the time and the watch and the link
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, nuff respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl cuz I'm straight with the next girl

(Sample x4) Cuz girls look so good
Next x3

You saw my moms in the supermarket and gave her your number
You asked her how's my sister then asked her how's my brother
Didn't ask about my father cuz you know he ain't like ya
Every time I left for your crib he'd really get hyper
The advice he used to give me makes much sense now
I can't believe I used to let you break my confidence down
You used to ask me why the hell did I wanna live in Brooklyn?
You messed up my flow although you were good-lookin'
Yes darling was fly and this was the problem
Cuz back in the day she had me scheming and robbin'
To get her things to wear so when she went to the club
All eyes were on her and who, me? I just bugged
Caught in between feeling proud and feeling more like a sucker
Had to go undercover, get away, and find another
Been in Brooklyn 9 years and been around the world, too
I've seen so many fly girls and I knew just what to do
I went from ex- to next took my time with each one
And you know they still love me so stop jellin' me hon
I went home to see moms and I saw you at the bus stop
Must I stop? Nah, I think not
You and I are the past c'est la vie, much respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl & I'm out with the next girl

You were the illest man alive now I'm reading your eulogy
Eyes so serious, you told me hold my head
Pursue this rap shit and go forward never backwards
While you gripped TECs tight, and ran niggas out of town
I ripped up mics, showin wack niggas how to sound
Still your essence, was callin
By two gunshots, at close range, your frame had fallen
Now like a angel you've risen

So many hookers on your schedule
Slammin Cadillac doors and mackin whores on the regular
You used to boost, the slickest of suits
Climbin through the back windows on the bus, you was ill Dukes
Until that chick you vicked, for the Cutlass

To all my brothers doin time, whether or not you did the crime
You know the system is devised to keep you deaf, dumb and blind

In order for things to change we must all play a part
It's easy for us to blame society
But now it's way too late, and we must take responsibility
To all my brothers in the streets
I know you feel you gotta hustle cause your peeps gotta eat
Makin moves right and exact
Don't wanna see you layin flat, don't wanna see ya catch a bullet black
If we don't build we'll be destroyed
That's the challenge we face in this race of poor and unemployed
Freud, a philosopher, but I'm a realist
So philosophize this, without love we won't exist
To those who passed out there, in the deserts and the jungles
With pain on their shoulders, and heavy bundles
I pray each one will ascend to new heights and new enlightenment

My Advice 2 You,Moment of Truth,1998.0,"Yo yo Gu-rizzi, yo
Yo whassup son?
Yo man, youknowhatImean? I need this money man
Get up out in these, in these streets man
Yo, so what's the deal God?
I'm sayin, what you need though?
Yo let me have like, two or three, three G's man
I'm sayin, I'm sayin son man
You know what happened last time though
I gotta do what I gotta do man, I gotta eat man
Whassup man? Oh your baby momma stressin you?
Way past the days of the deuce me and you stays a crew
Only a few percent knew what me and you went through
We've been sent to dominate, these corny come-lates
And set this crooked rap shit straight from Crenshaw to Castlegate
Like Pete and CL, I reminisce over days
From the streets of Boston to New York and all the ways
For certain niggas to blow up, and crime paid
But my praise goes to the most high
Cause some nights I got so wild yo, I almost died
Some stuff I got into, really scarred my mental
Pops wasn't tryin to hear it, cause of what he been through
Still, like my nigga Havoc said, sometimes you gotta
Hit your crew off, so they can make some bread
Cause no matter the weather, niggas be needin cheddar
And things in this world are more fucked up than ever
So let's make this bond to keep this hip-hop strong
You a man Baby Pop you know right from wrong
So stay out of trouble, and that goes for me too
That's what we need to do, that's my advice to you...
You remember what happened last time, when you got knocked
Doin your thing, sewin shit up on the block
You need to stop, fore you get caught again
Or you get shot and I lose another friend
""Any man with the plan is precise with his life""
""Think twice""
My advice to you, cut down on champagne and booze
For a nigga like me, most time that shit's bad news
It's like lightin a fuse whether it's sneakers or shoes
Cause somebody always wanna step up to start a feud
It's like Set-tin It Off but not the movie
Plus let's get some real women forget floozies and the groupies
Cause they spell mad problems from Watts to Harlem
And the bullshit won't stop long as the world's revolvin
And I recall when niggas knew my pops had clout
But they didn't know my sorry ass was gettin kicked out
And they was seein if I wanted to come bubble with them
And make my ends triple and double with them
And get in trouble with them, now memories of them
I wear em in my heart like a emblem
I doubt we'd ever be bigtime sellin dope coke or dust
It's killin us, let's take our people and make a exodus
Annhilation, inhalation through the lungs
Or extermination, by the use of dirty guns
Triple beam dreams and drug schemes of mad cream
Could be a sad scene when you go to that extreme
""Any man with the plan is precise with his life""
""Think twice""
""My advice is to you...""",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-my-advice-2-you-lyrics
What I’m Here 4,Moment of Truth,1998.0,"""Tell the people what you're here for""

It's the message in the song that makes you rock on
Some people go to places where they don't belong
Whether wrong or right, a lot of people fight
But I'm here to bless this mic, aight?

I take action the minute that the crowd gets hype
I'm type crashin, down like a meteorite
I'm Bogart-ing, mics and whole stages
Destroying MC's dreams, from words to whole pages
Their rapbooks, look more like scrapbooks
With their fictional fairytales and frail ass hooks
A lot of shit has happened, since I started rappin
There's been enough beef, and enough gat clappin
There's been mad signs, for this brother to heed
And while some choose greed, I choose to plant seeds
For your mental, spirit and physical temple
Bob your head to it, there's the water you've been lead to it
Bathe in it, a long time you've been cravin it
Prance to it, use your third eye and glance through it
Your state of being, becoming advanced through it
While others rhyme with no reason I be breezin
Their mics I seize them, then I try em for treason
I used to always like to hang out
Now I lounge in the rest writin bombs while tracks bang out
I know you peeped me in the club then
But now I'm in your speaker, with the voice that you're lovin

It's the message in the song that makes you rock on
Some people go to places where they don't belong
Whether wrong or right, a lot of people fight
But I'm here to bless this mic, aight?

Peace to the young ladies, who wanna bone me much
And peace to my nigga Premier, with the golden touch
I never fall off point, like DeNiro in Casino
Peace to Black Gambinos and all my peoples
Dig the steelo, I'm fightin' wars you know
As in the Jihad, most humble, most merciful
That's because I be God, I trog through fogs, puffing logs
MC's muttering menial madness, they get marred
Scarred and barred, and then, banished from my fuckin' kingdom
You got a fly one bring one, or else I come to fling some
Exquisite exotic exciting type shit
Enough to make the real heads wake up and get hype quick
I'm type slick, known as the God Universal
Kick rhymes without rehearsal, I cross the burnin sands
Now I stand here with virtue, of course I could hurt you
Simply with my point of view, and I knew
That many would come, that's why I've chosen
To cut off pathways and there's no runways or doorways open
For the jokers who ain't focused
And all the fake mercenaries get buried by the tongue of terrifying fury
Nothing's blurry, fuck it I got no worries
Hearts and minds shine bright light with insight
Yeah since my birthright to set up cyphers with power
'Cause mad shit ain't right, like punks in the spotlight
Who can't freestyle, sometimes I make my peeps smile
By sayin somethin crazy wild
Like some shit off my dome that be soundin'
Better than the next man's whole album...",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-what-im-here-4-lyrics
Just to Get a Rep,Step in the Arena,1991.0,"Stick up kids is out to tax
And this is how the story goes

Brothers are amused by others brother's reps
But the thing they know best is where the gun is kept
'Cause in the night you'll feel fright
And at the sight of a 
four-fifth
, I guess you just might
Wanna do a dance or two
'Cause they could maybe bust you for self or with a crew
No matter if you or your brother's a star
He could pop you and jet without a getaway car
And some might say that he's a dummy
But he's sticking you and taking all of your money
It's a daily operation
He might be loose in the park or lurking at the train station
Mad brothers know his name
So he thinks he got a little fame from the stick-up game
And while we're blaming society
He's at a party with his man
They got their eye on the gold chain that the next man's wearing
It looks big but they ain't staring
Just thinking of a way and when to get the brother
They'll be long gone before the kid recovers
And back around the way he'll have the chain on his neck
Claiming respect, just to get a rep


Ten brothers in a circle had the kid trapped
The one with the hoodie said, ""We'll hurt you""
If you don't run all your jewels and pay
Give up the Rolex watch or you won't see another day
See they were on the attack
And one said, ""Yo, you wanna make this to a homicide rap?
Make it fast so we can be on our way
Kick in the rings and everything, ok?""
The kid was nervous and flinching
And little shorty with the .38, yo, he was inching
Closer and closer, put the gun to his head
Shorty was down to catch a body instead
Money was scared so he panicked
Took off his link and his rings, and ran frantic
But shorty said, ""Nah"" pulled the trigger and stepped
It was nothing, he did it just to get a rep


The rep grows bigger, now he's known for his trigger finger
Rolling with troops of his sons like a gangster figure
He's near the peak of his crazy career
His posse's a nightmare, macking jewels and crazy gear
But as we know, the things we do come back
And Shorty's not peeping, others are scheming to counteract
'Cause the kid that got shot didn't perish, so
He pulls up in a jeep with tinted windows
Too late, Shorty was caught in the midst
His time ran out, his number came up, and that's it
You know the rest, so don't front, the plan has been upset
Some brothers gotta go out just to get a rep",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-just-to-get-a-rep-lyrics

Call me Guru that's my man Premier
Now many attempts have been made to hold us back
Slander the name and withhold facts
But I'm the type of brother with much more game

So now, now it is my duty to
Eliminate and subtract all of the booty crews
And suckers should vacate, before I get irate
And I'll kick your can from here to Japan
With force you can't withstand 'cause I'm the motherfucking man

Yo right now I got my man Lil Dap from the Group Home
Yo step up to the mic and tell them why you're the man

So much anger, built inside
So don't stop to say hi, motherfucker just die
My shit holds a mouthful, so I guess you know what's up
Why punks get killed, at the end of the month
Styles and styles I flip, Lil Dap remains sick
Yes the Group Home is thick so all you punks hear this
Every time you riff the more fame that we get
Motherfuckers act hard, thinkin' that they are God
Niggas just don't understand, let me be my own man
Did everything on my own, 'cause every place wasn't home
Anywhere that I rest, had to dress with a vest
I guess you get the routine, but with a lot of stress
Frustration on my mind, brothers doing mad time
Rhymes are organized like crime as they're ripped in a line
Brothers just don't know, how shit got to go
'Cause I was told, to never give my back to the street
As I walk through the ghetto, dead souls I greet
See my man give him pound, then I walk with a frown
Another minute, another brother's gunned down
Shit is getting too close, that's why the Group Home is thick
So every time you riff, the more fame that we get
My father always said don't watch the one across the street
Watch the one right next, because he's easy to flex
Took heed to what he said, yeah that deep ass nigga
While brothers hang around, tryin' to get down
Niggas just don't understand, I'm the motherfuckin' man

And also on the set from Dirty Rotten Scoundrels
We got my man Jeru the Damaja
Yo tell them why you're the man

I'll tap your, jaw, you probably heard it before
Step to the bedlamite, I'll prove my word is law
Drugstore worth more, dope rhyme vendor
Not partial to beef, a chief ambassador
Niggas get mad 'cause they, can't score
Like a wild west flick they wish to shoot up my door
But I incite a riot, don't even try it
Bust up chumps so crab kids keep quiet
Like I said before I tap jaws, snatch whores
Kill suckers in wars, vic a style you said was yours
Money grip wanna flip but you're fish
House the mic like your hooker and did tricks on the bitch
Dirty Rotten Scoundrel and my name is Jeru
Utilizing my tools in '92
MC's step up in mobs to defeat us 
when
We rock knots
 
and got props like Norm Peterson
Lots of friends, lots of fun, lots of beers
Got the skills, greeno so I always get cheers
Troop on like a trooper, no tears for fears
I'ma, get mines 'cause the crew will get theirs
Cut you up like Edward Scissorhands

She Knowz What She Wants,Moment of Truth,1998.0,"This jam is dedicated
To that woman that knows what she wants
And just how to get it, word up

She knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
Yo, she knows what she wants
She knows what she wants and just how to get it
She knows what she wants
Yeah, she knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
She knows what she wants and just how to get it

She knows what she wants, she's bold so she flaunts
Her hourglass jewels to mad clientele
Rejected oh well, she ain't goin to no hotel
Not the frantic freak type, but if you speak right
You get to take her out and dig her out on a weeknight
Weekends, she wants to spend your ends
Her shopping spree is colossal, attitude semi-hostile
Mack diva senorita, no reefer, no pizza, just
Shrimp and lobsters, champagne and mobsters
Suckin up the cream like a vac to a carpet
Strictly black market now you're her next target
Watch out... cause yo she knows what she wants

She knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
Yo, she knows what she wants
She knows what she wants and just how to get it

Spotted her in the club, with her crew nearby
Her looks are a lullaby, to pass us by, she's too fly
Never gunshy, hair is blown dry
She craves a wiseguy to help her gain amplify
So when you say, ""Yo baby,"" she ain't gotta say hi to ya
Cause prior to this, he put rocks on her neck and wrist
Plus a fat joint on her finger
You best to have a batch of scratch and treats to bring her
And if you happen to luck up and get in
You'll find yourself another jealous trick-ass boyfriend
And furthermore the mink she's donning is stunning
Blinding your senses Dunn, never put the two
Before the one son...
""It's the lesson well learned"" ""It's going down!""
*scratched* ""It's the lesson well learned"" ""It's going down!""

She knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
Yo, she knows what she wants
Yeah, she knows what she wants and just how to get it

Never fall victim to a chicken you was stickin
Even if you think the punanny might be finger-lickin
Never fall victim to a wicked woman's ways
""Why son?"" She's trying to get paid, check it
One: She said she wanted to give me a son
Two: She said she didn't like my crew
Three: She never ever cooked for me
Four: She was 
my cherie amour
 -- YEAH RIGHT
It was all hype, I needed more insight
In retrospect, I know I slept from the first night
She did a split and that was it
Gave up my pimp license, and flipped my whole friggin script
But now I'm back like the Isley's moving wisely
Sizing up the situation, keeping honies waiting
Cause I got more to do, than to be sucked dry
This tough guy, will get by, while the chickens wonder why
I don't be callin cause it's like 
Ex to Next

Make Em Pay,Moment of Truth,1998.0,"Yeah, you know them
They accuse the righteous people of crimes and claim that we're wicked
Stirring up controversy, making us fight each other
All the fake rappers make it worse, they gotta pay

First and foremost, some rappers are sweet like fructose
When I cock back these lyrics, y'all punks best be ghost
I be the seven twenty-one, eighteen twenty-one
The illest one, I'm almost doper than anyone
Straight out the late nights of Bed-Stuy
Stepping up, y'all put your weapons up, I make heads fly
You're artificial like saccharin
You're crazy fake, it's more than skills you be lacking in
Concepts you bite, cause your identity ain't tight
Trying to be something you're not, like pulling a knife at a gunfight
I'm trooping on night air like flight number 106
And getting all up in your fucking mix
You get me upset, and I got you uptight
Cause my committee's in your city tonight, aight?
We got seventeen million of us plus, two million Indians
That makes 19 mil, lighting shit up like Wild Bill
I be the, supreme father plus the ill kid, with drama
My karma, creates the Teflon to pierce your body armor
And make sure you check the shit before you walk to me, or talk to me
Stepping to me improperly, you just may catch the weaponry
My specialty is tearing tracks out the frame
You know my fucking name, I rule all game
I'm universal on all planes, what's your claim?

Yo, I be your highness, in slickness, you chumps bear witness
Tremendous trooper, verbal nigga with the fitness
Drop you for your spot with the blazer then I blast you
Slice precise like Benihana's when I come to bring the dramas
Styles so swift, that you can't peep the god
As your lyrics get buried, six feet deep in my backyard
I laugh hard, while your mental I run through mazes
Dark stages of terror to shatter your dressing room mirror
Your whole error gets crushed, your whole show gets bumrushed
Too many dumb punks, want to enter this rap scene
Kicking Willie Bobo, but need to be slapped clean
Into oblivion, the true champion always rises
I bring surprises to the chief plus their advisers
Size me up, and you will find nothing's larger
Catch more wreck on your dome, than a deranged fucking barber
So what you made some dough, you best keep on scrambling
All your vanity, is instantly crushed, when I start handling
Demanding that you pay, for your weak rhyme display
Coast to coast, I break the fakes everyday

I see myself as the black rap messiah
Colossal spreading my gospel through electrical wires
Spit fire through speech, so I can reach each and every
Tom dick and jerry slippin like petroleum jelly
Too busy in the limelight, can't rhyme tight
I got divine right to bring y'all to light
Something ain't right, to be an MC, you gotta thug
Or to thug you gotta be an MC, this shit is bugged
Show love but few; deal with crew and crew only
And think universal like Sony
Phony pounds and fake hugs is usually avoided
Give a fuck like Pizza Hut I got to stay noyd-ed
Cause that same nigga you trust, could be that same cat
Behind that gat that bust, quiet ya, with the silencer
Keep it hush, ashes to dust, then dust to ashes
Nowadays it's who pull out the fastest, imagine this
Rap shit without this gat shit, or the phony cat
In black talking bout how much his mac spit
But this year, Gang Starr got changes being made
No wack shit being played no fake macks getting paid
No Versace mc's, with a mouth full of mo'
Soundin' like a ho spittin' at a fashion show flow
I bombshell that pastel Chanel rap through a maxwell
Ever since young Krumb, was taught to rap well
Going deep, process of thought, when my eyes closes
Awaken with turban, robe and sandals like Moses
Travelling high sands and eastern lands for the answers
Ignorance is spreading through the streets like it was cancer
Too many drinking not thinking, when behind that trigger
A .38 escalate the murder rate, for us niggas
It's like, microphone roulette cause nowadays MCs is getting wet
Over someone else's fake gangsta rep",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-make-em-pay-lyrics
Take It Personal,Daily Operation,1992.0,"Take it personal
Take it personal
Take it personal

I never thought that you would crab me
Undermine me, and backstab me
But I can see clearly now the rain is gone
The pain is gone but what you did was still wrong
There was a few times I needed your support
But you tried to play me like an indoor sport
Like racquetball, tennis, pool, whatever
All I know is that you attempted to be clever
Nevertheless, cleverness can't impress
'Cause now you've been exposed like a person undressed
And I could see through you, 'cause I'm the Guru
And what you gonna do when I start to step to you?
'Cause when I pay you back, I'll be hurting you
And this ain't no threat so take it personal

Take it personal
Take it personal
Take it personal

Rap is an art, you can't own no loops
It's how you hook 'em up and the rhyme style, troop
So don't even think you could say someone bit
Off of your weak beat, come on, you need to quit
I flip lines and rhymes that never sound like yours
There ought to be laws against you yapping your jaws
Originality overflows in me
And the truth is, that you wish you could live the
Life I live and kick the lyrics I kick
But bear in mind that you can't think this quick
So Premier drops beats for me to say verses to
And if I sound doper, then take it personal

Take it personal
Take it personal
Take it personal
Take it personal
Take it personal
Take it personal

Don't be mad 'cause I don't come around the way
Like I used to, I don't have time these days
I'm keeping busy making power moves
And don't try to say I don't remember you
You shouldn't let your jealousy show like that
I stopped coming by 'cause of the way you act
Telling my business to kids I don't even know
You're like a daytime talk show, and that's low
So you can tell everyone, that I'm jerking you
And if you don't like it, kid, take it personal

Take it personal
Take it personal
Take it personal

Who’s Gonna Take the Weight?,Step in the Arena,1991.0,"Knowledge is power, and knowledge can be the difference between life or death
You should know the truth and the truth shall set you free

I was raised like a Muslim, prayin' to the East
Nature of my life relates rhymes I release like a cannon
'Cause I been plannin' to be rammin' what I wrote
Straight on a plate down your throat
So digest as I suggest, we take a good look
At who's who while I'm readin' from my good book
And let's dig into every nook and every cranny
Set your mind free as I slam these thoughts
And just like a jammy goes bow
You're gonna see what I'm sayin' now
You can't be sleepin', 'cause things are gettin' crazy
You better stop being lazy
There's many people frontin', and many brothers droppin'
All because of dumb things, let me tell you somethin'
I've been through so much that I'm such
A maniac, but I still act out of faith
That we can get the shit together so I break
On fools with no rhymes skills messin' up the flow
And people with no sense who be movin' much too slow
And so, you will know the meaning of the Gang Starr
Guru with the mic and Premier raise the anchor
Swiftly, as we embark on a journey
I had to get an attorney
I needed someone to defend my position
Decisions I made, 'cause now it's time to get paid
And ladies, these rhymes are like the keys to a dope car
Maybe a Lexus or a Jaguar
Still, all of that is just material
So won't you dig the scenario
And just imagine if each one is teachin' one
We'll come together so that we become
A strong force, then we can stay on course
Find your direction through introspection
And for my people out there I got a question
Can we be the sole controllers of our fate?
Now who's gonna take the weight?

You can't handle the whole weight

The weight of the world is heavy on my mind
So as my feelings unwind I find
That some try to be down just 'cause it's trendy
Others fall victim to envy
But I'll take the road less traveled
So I can see all my hopes and my dreams unravel
Relievin' your stress, expressin' my interest
In the situation that you're facin'
That's why I'm down with the Nation
Spirituality supports reality
We gotta fight with the right mentality
So we can gain what is rightfully ours
This is the meaning of the chain and the star
Land is power, so gimme forty acres
Let's see how far I can take ya
Original invincible, that's how I'm lookin' at it
I use my rhymes like a Glock automatic
Any means necessary, I'm goin' all out
Before the rains bring the nuclear fallout
So let me ask you, is it too late?
Ayo, who's gonna take the weight?

So called MC's, wannabe rappers and all that, whatever
You get your knot rocked kid, yo

You thought you brought your best lines, but they couldn't touch mine
I rocked you in your knot hope you have better luck next time
You thought you brought your best lines, but they couldn't touch mine
I rocked you in your knot hope you have better luck next time

So just perhaps, you wanna challenge my style of rap
Talkin bout you bust caps, we know that's just a pile of crap
The underground is where I dwell at
It's where I find my heaven, and where you find your hell at
You're in my clutches now, you get slit up and lit up
Just like some Dutches now, see I'm hard to define
My mind travels far, from ghettoes to galaxies
Representin GangStarr -- The street life
The reason why my mic ignites, I bring more ruckus
Than a nightclub fight, or bar brawl
I'm swingin lyrics like broken glass palm to skull y'all
Hold your head, cause all that weak shit is dead
See the times are changin, and me and my peeps is gettin crazy fed
So remember when you writing your rhymes
Stop fantasizing, and bring some real shit next time
Yeah, bring some real shit, yo

You thought you brought your best lines, but they couldn't touch mine
I rocked you in your knot hope you have better luck next time
You thought you brought your best lines, but they couldn't touch mine
I rocked you in your knot hope you have better luck next time

Yo, I do what I have to do to master you and capture you
Until you recognize, what my rapture can do
You thought I wouldn't step up, to keep my rep up?
I ain't them other kids, I don't need to play no catch-up
I got too much pride for this, I know some niggas
That'll ride for this, with me it's do or die for this
Street knowledge, intellect and spirituality
My survival package, as I deal with reality
I'm like Fishburne in Hoodlum when I come to do em
Chew em up, spit em out, the most respected no doubt
You seen me in action so act you been knowin
The G-U-R-U, of the Gang, I've been flowing
Just like the river Niger all the way to the Hudson
Had so many lyrics stashed, and I couldn't wait to bust some
Lately, I've watched this game evolve and elevate
So now I push my music like drug dealers push weight
Straight like that, straight out the gate
Cause it's never too late, to set this fuckin record straight
But it is too late, for you and your crew son
You had the audacity to come against me, the gifted one?
And Primo with the tracks, to inspire my next line
You've got no wins here, so better luck next time

You thought you brought your best lines, but they couldn't touch mine
I rocked you in your knot hope you have better luck next time
You thought you brought your best lines, but they couldn't touch mine
I rocked you in your knot...

Yeah yeah
Better luck next time

The Rep Growz Bigga,Moment of Truth,1998.0,"The rep grows bigga (stay large)
Keep my workers under pressure
Try to get the dough all
Never make mistakes, always come correct
Stepped up to get your rep up
The rep grows bigga (stay large)
Keep my workers under pressure
Try to get the dough all
Never make mistakes, always come correct
You can say I'm sort of the boss so get lost

You do your first bit of dirt to get your name known
You never talk too much to get your spot blown
Now you're no longer just a face in the crowd
You're gettin so much respect that niggas might as well bow
And movin up with your hustle like you planned it
Rakin' dough like the world's greatest bandit
Always got one eye open, for the stick-up kids postin
So much cream chumps they can't understand it
Ladies flock to your jock like it's golden
Curious, to test the weight you be holdin
But you ain't got no time, to be chasin felines
If she's the chick that you pick then she gets chosen
People treat you like you're ghetto royalty
And all your staff shows you utmost loyalty
You paid your dues, refuse to lose in this scenario
The rep grows bigga, you're a legend and a hero


Your fame has gotten larger than your life
You've got a harem of bitches and killer niggas that's hype
They got your back, but you so fly you don't need em
You shit where you're eatin so you don't peep the proceedings
They start scheming, feeling that you're too swollen
And that's the reason why your cash and stash gets stolen
You start perspiring, because you're paranoid
Still another confrontation that you couldn't avoid
Prepare for drama, as if you were a stunt man
Back in the days you was a forty and a blunt man
Today you're a Willie, now the weather's too chilly
New York City ain't the place to be frontin
Over your shoulders day and night's where you look
Your so-called fam ran a scam, and you got shook
Go back to square one, better go talk to your son
See reps grow bigga in the life of a crook


Years ago, we were new jacks to this scene
Showed some effort, made fat records, but still saw no green
Know what I mean? They tried to stifle us
Nigga you could not believe how really ill and trife it was
Fed up so we headed on a serious mission
Wishin, that we could better our position
Two businessmen, Guru and Preme, we enterprised
Too strong to be stepped on, creatively wise
The dedicated ministers of underground sound
When we're doin our thing, you know we don't fuck around
No matter how bizarre and different you think you are
Your team wouldn't dream of competeing with GangStarr
Premier in the rear with the beats and cuts
And Guru with the mic ready to tear shit up
Take us out the game nigga? How you figure?

Once you step in the arena, cheater; you're gonna be a-
Mazed when you gaze at the armor on this leader
Fully clad and glad to fight a cause, I won't pause
Fear is a joke, slowpoke, I'm like claws
That'll rip 'cause your gift is merely flesh
Superficial and I wish you would give it a rest
But if you don't, I'll unsheath my Excalibur
Like a noble knight, so meet your challenger
A true hero, while you're a true zero
Gettin' beat to a pulp so that you can't run for help
I heard a gulp in your throat 'cause you hope that I'll be merciful
But coo-cluck, I made you strut as I rehearse a few
Battle drills, and watch your bladder spill
Yellow fluid, check how I mellowly do it
Face defeat to this beat, you can tell I'm into it
As I'm pullin' out my lance to kill you and advance to
The winner's throne; 'cause I own you once you step in the arena

Step up

In the arena... or rather coliseum
There's people gatherin' by multitudes to see one
Perpretrator fall to the dust after the other
Quickly disposed of at the hand of a known brother
Born with the art in his heart that is Spartacus
And one-to-one combat Jack, just a thought of this
Match-up makes Gang Starr wanna snatch up
One or two phrases from the new book with new pages
Of rhymes that are built like a chariot
Dope vocals carry it to the battle set
If a beat was a princess, I would marry it
But now I must bow to the crowd as I stand proud
Victorius, glorious, understand now
'Cause battles and wars and much fights I have been through
One MC got beheaded, and you can too
Forget it, 'cause you'd rather be just a spectator
An onlooker, afraid you may get slayed
Or struck by a blow from a mic gladiator
I betcha that later you might be sad that you played yourself
'Cause you stepped up, chest puffed out
And in just one lyric, you got snuffed out
'Cause rhymin' is serious, I'm strong, I'm like Hercules
You'll get hurt with these lines, close the curtains please
And suckers can jet 'cause I wreck once you step in the arena

Step inside my arena

In the arena or forum, weak MCs, I will floor 'em
Causin' mayhem, I'll slay them, and the blood'll be pourin'
Furthermore I implore that as a soldier of war
I go in only to win and be the holder of more
Trophies, titles, and triumphs 'cause I dump all the sly chumps
Never choosin' to lose my spot, not once
For the mere idea of an opponent that I'd fear
Is foolish utterly, I mean, what nut'd be
Tryin' to toy with a destroyer of many
You shitted your pants 'cause you can't think of any
Foe that could step to this concept so
You better sit again, citizen; weak MC's, I get rid of them
Watch the way they get distraught when they get caught
In the worst positions 'cause they didn't listen
And tried goin' up against a hungry killer who's itchin'
To maim and murder, those who claimed that they were the
Toughest ones, they get done once they step in the arena

Cats be buyin' up SoundScans to beef up sales
Niggas wanna crossover, wanna be upscale
Fuck that, that ain't hip-hop, that's somethin' else
You're better off back on the ave doin' somethin' else
All you suckers claimin' that you are, thug or gangsta
You disrespect the game by dry-snitchin' you prankster
I thank y'all for makin' more room for us, uhh
Ashes to dust you wonder who's to trust
My sense of self, and my mental health
Is much more powerful, than any hint of wealth
A lot of niggas get cash, and collect Mercedes
But neglect their ladies, and forget their babies
Then the chicks turn and act like dudes
'Cause they reflect our light, so yo act right fool
And this is just a piece of my mind, a thesis of mine
I'mma make moves and I'mma leave you behind
At times I feel like my back's against the wall
And if y'all ain't with me, then it's me against y'all
I stand my ground, that's what I was taught
While others stand around, I hold it down like a fort
In the midst of war, I find peace within
Run, lock your doors, don't let the beast get in
The mind is a terrible thing to waste
I show love 'cause it's a terrible thing to hate

B.Y.S.,Daily Operation,1992.0,"I'm like a sniper, rhymes'll strike ya when I'm rockin
Mad chicks be jockin' when the G Starr's talking
And that's because my word is bond
I get much fan mail and I always respond
So tell your hon to write me too
Make sure she puts attention Mr. Guru
Brothers know the flow is unique
I got 100 wild styles in my black valise
MC's wanna be me so they keep askin
For me to teach 'em methods both slow and fast
And others wanna act as if they're better
But they only got one style which ain't all that clever
I'm cooler than wind, harder than cold steel
I get the ladies with more than just sex appeal
A mystic psychic scanning all your thoughts
I'll touch your soul and make your brain feel caught
When my rapture traps ya and makes you mine
You'll submit to the gift and to the lyrical lines
So suckers realize that the size is too large
When I come through I'm pullin' whole crews cards
I be wreckin' correct and on the gangster tip
MC's who front: I'm gonna bust your shit

Bust your shit
Ok, party people in the house...

I wonder do you love it enough
I'm steppin' rugged and tough, never to front or to bluff
I got the fresh cut baldy, the brothers call me
Guru the man yes with all the
J-A-Z-Z-Y type essence
, street type lessons manifesting
The one who make the fly ladies feel pleasant
Never forgettin' that to myself I'm true
Do what you want to but watch yourself though ""duke""
I don't wanna hear all of that loud mouthing
Try to pull yours out when nothing comes out
Then you'll see why you can't compete with me
The notorious Guru of the Gang you see
Starr stands for power like I said before
I'm like the doctors cure 
slicker than Roger Moore
I slide up to a crab MC like this
Tap 'em in the head with my mic like this
I'll be revealing that you're weak to the world if you wish
And I insist that if you persist
Then you get creamed, cuz I'ma get real steamed
So don't you try to flex and try to look all mean
Heyo check it that's dead that's it
'Cause all you phony ass rappers I'ma bust your shit

Bust your shit

Now when you see me on the set you know I may unleash
A lyric like a mad dog barking through the speaker
Step off unless you wanna get torn up
Your raps worn out burned out fucked up
You lucked up or maybe you lucked out
'Cause at the battle last time you snuck out
But now I'm rolling over you full blast
I'm here to let you know no longer will the bull last

The new millennium, Hiram Abiff
Gotta watch what I say to you niggas so I code my 'sation
'Cause the shit ain't really pass the statute of limitations
The streets still holler about how strong I am
Niggas I hurt still holler about how wrong I am
As a little nigga broke, baking soda and coke
Had me amazed how my steady hand kept it afloat
Let it sit, cool and harden, hit the set cool and heartless
In front of the store projects, as long as I made a profit
I see you eyeing me, your fire escape diary
Filled with pages of episodes of shying me
Nonbeliever, my hammer for hire
Hit your ass so close that your coat will catch fire
Dog, the stakes are dire, I'm no liar
Holdin' court in the street, B, 'cause I got priors

Same team no games, these chicks that blow brains
Rather watch Soul Train than corners rocking cocaine
Got no shame, trying to build these figures

Not in the physical, through us he live
I can see him with Big L, Pun, Pac and BIG
Watching over the kid like ""Yeah, Shigg, the wait's over""
Inhale that Ether, blow out and Takeover

Pull them cannons on you while them cameras on you
How you love that?
Don't wanna bump with Stax
So go ahead, dumb up, make me call Krumb up
""It's the Militia""

Me and Benz blazing, Rave got the gauge raising
Sick of talking about it, niggas ain’t on my wavelength

United we stand together, down for whatever
Divided we get at you from all angles
Gang Starr forbid, NYG'z, same team no game
Love is love, fam, one in the same
Funny style niggas act strange, going against the grain
Don't want to see us on top of our thing? We adapt to change
Fame, fortune and material game, flow natural unrestrained
Let me explain, niggas don't get it 'til you set it aflame
Subject them to pain, make them respect the name
The set you rep, connect you play stay ready to bang
Steps ahead of competitors, they'll test your aim
H. Staxx shoot back, splat, dead your brain
My foundation bust gats, splat, dead your brain
Fuck with mine, splat, not take the blame
Playin' for keeps, we came to win

Yo, I'm the Jerry Rice to this, much too nice to quit
And just so you know, we never liked you, kid
'Cause you ain't wanna let niggas eat
So I'mma convene with my team before we gotta let the trigger speak
'Cause nowadays, y'all rappers are carbon copies
Your bars are sloppy, still it's hard to stop me
Especially when I connect with my man, rep with my fam
We taking back the rest of our land
And we don't really care if they say you're the shit
They playing your hits, we about to make our way in this bitch
And let's see if your gimmick last until the next season
In a flash, take your stupid ass out, give me the next reason

B.I. vs. Friendship,Moment of Truth,1998.0,"*Gang Starr's ""Who's Gonna Take the Weight?"" plays in the background*

It's like, a friendship, and a business partnership
And, we have to always be concious of the difference
Between em; because y'know, some things can happen
That'll ruin one or the other, so
We alwa-we always stay concious of those things
Those obstacles that can, y'know trip us up
Because we ain't trying to go out like that

""friends"" ""business"" (repeat 3X)
AhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHRAHHAHHH!!!
C'mon! Motherfucker! Yeah! ...
GangStarr! GangStarr! 
M.O.P
Ghetto people!

Son you're supposed to be my man, but you ain't wise enough to realize
This is B.I., see I wanna taste the whole cake
Some things in this industry, shit be so fake
Make no mistake, if you're my man you'd understand
About the plan, to stack hundreds of grands (That's right!)
And how to stand, on much more acres of land
And to expand from the days of goin hand to hand
So like I was CEO I do my thing son
And turn this underground rap thing to my kingdom
Release a fistful, of rhymes for the fiscal year
MC's are wishful fuckin with this here
They stuck with the tear, for fear they foresake a brother's love
It's clear -- I'd have to be the better man I'm thinkin
The 7th Letter Man ain't got no time for petty speakin (uhh)
So we go our seperate ways I see the fork in the road
I know I blessed you with a portion of gold
And some good fortune to hold, so KEEP THAT
While I keep it movin, just like truckloads
Of interstate cargo, taxin niggas like U.S. embargoes
You my man like I said so all the best
You shoulda known we do shit differently than all of the rest
Can't afford to let a link be, loose in the chain
It's time for us to get mad more, juice in the game
You're buggin son (that's right) that's word to Billy and Fame
So I'mma state again, that we play to win (Yeah!)
So I don't care what you say to her or say to him
The object son, is to excel and lead
And niggas be bluffin', fallin' for nothin but greed

 If it's animosity
 Let me know
 If you plottin to stop my dough
 Time to go!
 GangStarr, M.O.P. nigga
 Tryin to blow!
 If you my man you could understand!
*repeat 2X*

I'm true to myself y'all, and I'm a down ass nigga!
So don't fool yourself, clown ass nigga!
I always been the type of cat that'll put it on ya
Since back in the days when Laze snatched me off the corner
And every since then, the whole game changed
Everybody's against, Lil' ass Fame
They wanna see me stretched out with my back smokin
Left for dead in the street with my back opened
So I don't keep friends I just roll with
Niggas I was RAISED WITH, went out in a BLAZE WITH
In the penile, to B-Ville, down to Grayson
And we stick together, in these last days kid
So I don't have what you call friends
Cause when it's on then they gone in the end!
But I'mma handle my business indeed
Cause niggas be bluffin', fallin' for nothin but greed!

 If it's animosity
 Let me know
 If you plottin to stop my dough
 Time to go!

 Tryin to blow!
 If you my man you could understand!

Hey yo what happened to the love soldier? It never crossed my mind
That you would doubt my love inside and test my pride
I divide, anything that I got
With my M.O.P. staff -- WE ALL THAT WE HAVE!
To the First Family loyalty, is no game
We them type of niggas that, money won't change
We all aim, for the big picture
But to me it don't mean shit if your dogs ain't witcha
I sacrifice my main arteries -- WHY NIGGA?!
Ain't nobody never loved me, like my niggas
See my business is my friendship and my friendship is my business
Can I get a witness?! (Preach on nigga!)
Hey yo we went through all out wars, half-assed tours
Travelled 'cross this land with heavy contraband
(See you my man!) And you ain't never got to
Second guess or question the love of William Danze (Sho' nuff!)
I am invaluable, to my niggas
As an old rusty ass thirty-two -- BETTER THAN NOTHIN!
Think of William when they start bustin, I hold you down

(The real question is—) What's real?
(Try your best to diagnose—) What's real
(People all around, you got to recognize and witness)

I got soldiers that'll turn shit out, burn shit out
Do I come correctly when it's my turn? No doubt
I twisted trees in the cold with one hand wipin' my nose
Girls say that I'm fly 'cause they be likin' my clothes
But the clothes or the money can't make the man
When I apply my vicious grip, you can't take it, man
Face it and understand, there are no winnings for you
What I'm beginnin' to do, is bring an endin' to you and your crew
I sip a brew and at the same time drink the life out of you
I righteously come through, created in the likeness of who?
G-O-D, can sell a half a line for a G
Check ballistics, you won't be takin' mine from me
Oh boy, you p-noid, heard my lightnin' and thunder
Not Thor but frightening, type of stress I've been under
I'm the one-eyed Jack, I'm here to smack you back
In '83, I seen stacks, run your kicks, take a flick and act

(What's real?) Certified street poetry
In the game a long time, so you know it's me, nigga
(What's real?) Gang Starr, muthafucka, we live
All you fake niggas run and hide, we wanna know
(What's real?) It's Lil Dap in the place to be
We livin' proof, supa star, you see, we wanna know
(What's real?) The Foundation, yo, we presidential
Y'all ain't built for what we been through

Underground, I might as well record in the sewer
Notorious lord of the war tourin' Aruba
Before I was born I'd of warned you and showed you the Ruger
I'ma shoot four through your fedora, destroy your medulla
I could get these niggas X'd quick as sendin' a text
For disrespect, shit'll be simple as orderin' an Uber
I don't know what's quicker to change, them figures or fame
But I guarantee you don't nothin' move more than the moolah
All these rappers really cut out to do is squash the beef and dip
Y'all need to cut out the diva shit
Every time a nigga like Fever Nina come out the dealership
The streets hear the sound of that Preem droppin' the needle skip
Like Kane walkin' in ""The Symphony""
Abel is my brother who all he offers is infamy
I bust Magnums, either strategize or duck faster
I send his whole group home like Melachi the Nutcracker
Preem blowin' weed, he a master on the courts
I'm a student with the rap that's spewin' passion on the chorus
While the smoke is in the air, feel like voodoo's on the floor
'Cause we got the actual ashes of Guru on the boards
He's sittin' right inside an urn in the session
Lookin' down from Heaven to Gang Starr's current progression
Earnin' successes, his legacy get treated like four themes
Movin' forward then let his children eat off the proceeds

(What's real?) Certified street poetry
In the game a long time, so you know it's me, nigga
(What's real?) Gang Starr, muthafucka, we live
All you fake niggas run and hide, we wanna know

Fake MC's, they always act hard
But won't walk the street without they bodyguard
I hate fake MC's, they always act hard
But won't walk the street without they bodyguard

MC's are laid out like stiffs in the morgue
Praise the Lord you're in awe when I'm grippin' my mic cord
Rhymes I rip with swift execution
One verse could coerce your girl to prostitution
The Guru is now the brother that you're fearin'
Beware when I'm making hits with Premier n'
Rolling to a spot near you, lyrics tear through
Chrome to your dome, you better watch your rearview
Niggas been held back too long, we're coming up
In the streets we roam alone so watch me running up
I'm summing up a mad posse of warriors
Night crusaders able to break down barriers
And bringing faces of death, putting MC's to rest
Until there's no fake chumps left
Run, step, yeah, bounce, nigga, bounce
My rhyme's a cargo when yours is just a quarter ounce

Mad brothers in every city, you can feel the tension
To stop the killing, wack MC's must die
Who am I? I'm the substance that'll make your third eye cry
Too potent, too high in intelligence quotient
When I unleash my speech I'll have you punk rappers open
I won't expose your names and your identities
You know you're phony, get the fuck from in front of me
Hardcore fans are fed up from your folklore
Lines strip you raw and infect you like cold sores
And I hope you're not the one that I'm after
Since the days of Adidas, I've been a true master

Fake MC's, they always act hard
But won't walk the street without they bodyguard
I hate fake MC's, they always act hard
But won't walk the street without they bodyguard
Fake MC's, they always act hard
But won't walk the street without they bodyguard
I hate fake MC's, they always act hard
But won't walk the street without they bodyguard

I've been around, punk, but yo, I still feel young
A few of my crew members like to pack guns
I'm high strung, but don't mistake me when I smile
I murder an entire rap chart with my freestyle
After the killing, just like Casper, I'm ghost
Fakes thought I was friendly, at their wakes I was host
Toast without a gun you'd be done
Throw up your hands, bitch, and now you know you stand to lose one
Choose one metaphor and then choose another
Wax that ass like a bully, have you calling your big brother
Although I'm five foot eight they call me sergeant
Got more hoes on my dick than you can fit in the garden
At Madison Square, I shot a fair one
So many niggas knew me that the kid wouldn't dare run
MC's pay cash to ensure their safety
They know they can't take me; the G-A-N-G, you crazy?
I be on them like a message from God
Knowledge of self while fake MCs play hard

But now like chicks they all be up on me
And me so horny, I hit 'em like a groupie
Snatch off my hat, wash my dick, and keep it moving
Showing and proving on a day to day basis
I rep New York and a million different places
State to state, country to country
My skills are legend in the style of poetry
I've paid my dues to this game, word to mother
East New York hops, it gets no rougher
Baby brother been puffing buddha and blunts since '85
Before the fake motherfuckers started perpetrating live, I've
Achieved mad props though niggas roll around in jeeps
I ride the A Train and get mad beeps
So when we bang bang boogie out jumps my boot knocks
Chicks comes in flocks when D.R.S. rocks, Glocks
Are not needed it's all done with the mind
I neutralize suckers because I'm alkaline
I could go on for days speaking 'bout my clout
So Lil Dap snatch the mic and choke the motherfucker out

No, you can't hide from jail and you can't hide from the street
Lyrics do get deep when you walk in the east
A unique sound from the underground made the brothers unite
I'm slapping pound to pound with real niggas, ai'ght?
Ain't nothing changed but the weather, rain, storm or whatever
You pour the forty on the ground for the brothers who ain't around
Break it down with the flow as I walk through the ghetto
A nigga said he couldn't do it 'til the shit hit the fan
Last year I was the man ripping up every jam
So it's your hobby, nothing serious 'til things get rough
I'm stepping rugged and tough, and bitches won't get enough
Of Lil Dap, what's that? Fuck around, you get slapped
Schizophrenic with rhyme plus we're well organized
Make the chicks say 'ow' and the brothers say 'ho'
You can't tell a motherfucker what to do with his life
Niggas tend to live trife, so I react with a mic
It's the end of the time so I got to gets mine
Ayo 'Ru, what's your function? Meet me at Broadway Junction
Before I start to get in it, better yet I just kick it
Ayo son, if you're with it Guru starts to flip it

Uh with my .38 five shot I bust a bumboclaat
He talks dumb a lot so him shall drop
I got the clout, all you pussy rappers be out
From the get go I let go shit to make you petro
Watching fly niggas show you how to rhyme asshole
You know the motherfucking situation
So get down, get down with the Gangstarr Foundation
Now I'mma touch on reality, chumps can't fuck with me
And all the honeys be loving me
My style be kicking crazy butt
Wannabes on their knees licking crazy butt
Your girl pays me but ain't no need to try and stop her
I'm Big Poppa steer your girl then I'll drop her
'Cause she be working on my nerves
And yo I got more game than the bitch got curves
I'm like Gambino, the slick head honcho
Ill kid ready to wreck mics pronto
And I know, I'll break your back with my rap like smack

It’z a Set Up,Moment of Truth,1998.0," scratched by DJ Premier

 While they devise our demise, we grow wise
 Upset the set up, the element of surprise
 IT'Z A SET UP
 It's time to upset the set up

Though they conspire, fake us to make us retire
With the burning desire we make it out of the crossfire
Thoughts are higher, elevated and focused
While the path is narrow, for those like us
Primo beats provoke us to meditate like Zen
With the will and the strength of a million men
While they introspect, where nothing is met
It's been that way for a while so much has come and then went
But I'm confident, a few, are due to redeem
Their respective kingdoms, with an abundance of cream
So if I were to scheme, it would be on a realer dream
Like formin' effective teams to filter the smokescreens
You totin' in jeans, don't even know the true enemy
A fan of Big and of Pac, and plus they both were friends to me
Past trivial pursuits like East and West coast feuds
Come against me on the mic, many and most will lose
Like most dudes, I love this hip-hop, and this rap stuff
But I don't like the shows where the ignorant act up
While some'll be rippin it, they be in the crowd wilin'
Flippin on kids, for the chains and medallions
Or the kid they don't like, from a beef from way back
And decide that's the night, perfect time for payback
It's wack for the group, plus the others who came
To see a fat ass show, instead there's bullets aflame

 While they devise our demise, we grow wise
 Upset the set up, the element of surprise
 IT'Z A SET UP
 It's time to upset the set up

Still waters run deep, this is leagues in depth
Quiet as kept they slept we crept
Society puts the squeeze on MC's like iron grips of death
From here on in peace and blessings, lord, cherish your breath
Gifted Un Rhyme U know how we do, stay true
Follow through lay down the law, cause it's probable and overdue
All systems overdue, my guns know me
I only hold a few my nigga for only a few hold me
Never forget the ones before me, my momma told me
Sacrifice for the ones behind me leadin the seeds
Blind leads, black on black, crime to me
Inclined to refine my creed I eat thinkin lead
Conceive to make the beast bleed, enhance thoughts
Like tossed trees, scorch the Earth three-fourths
Let my offspring feed all three, corpus delectis cost me
Lost and found on enemy ground, quoted although
They don't know how we get down at sound speed we breed
No more confined to blind greed and self destructive deeds
Heed my freedom war cry, of course I'm N.Y
Hug my peeps that died, the loved ones alive
Reinforce and fly high as I lie so shall I
From New I to Cali next plateau U.N.I.versal
Unleash the black reign
Show 'em who in control, electro-magnetic
Pull on the hole, ill as toters bang out
Til we sittin' on swole the strongest way to grow
The only way I know, Underground Railroad on track
No physical or mental chain can shackle that",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-itz-a-set-up-lyrics
The Mall,Moment of Truth,1998.0,"Make money money -- GO SHOPPIN!
Take money money -- GO SHOPPIN!
No matter what the weather, winter spring or fall
We'll be doin it... ""at the mall""

Yo, what the deal, cousin? Gave him a pound, now we huggin'
In the mall thuggin', buggin', spent a few hundred
Shorties must be lovin', shit, jigg to my Wallow's
They watch like Movado so I floss like a model
You ain't loungin', 'til you've been countin' by the thousands
Profilin', pushin' more weight than your medallion
We be wildin', lockin blocks down just like the Island
Dough pilin', we keeps it in the family like Italians
Ballin', cop some Charles Jordan and some Icebergs
Ice, herbs, nice curves, girlfriend with the white fur
Pushed up, feel her like some shots of Tequila
Said her man's a dealer, with all these bags from Antilla
He got to be, but you hot to me — you under lock and key?
Laid it down properly, this cat at Stern's watchin me
Moved on me sloppily, prepare for the fallout
With gats to blow the wall out, clear the mall out

Make money money -- GO SHOPPIN!
Take money money -- GO SHOPPIN!
No matter what the weather, winter spring or fall
We'll be doin it... ""at the mall""

Yo, don't be mad at me, I used to be
King Raggedy, fiends naggin' me — shit, I had to breathe
Gradually, rocked casually, Sha passed the leaf
Vaseline slick shit, green stick shit
Honey got some mean lipstick, my knot's this thick
And I cop the meanest shit, still rock Discus
But cops frisk us, the block whispers
Theft need to stop, how we cop
But you can Guess like them jeans you rock
But now I'm rollin' right, 'cause I had four faces
Fightin' four cases in them North Face and Dolomites
So with these here Isotoners, I'ma hold it tight
Shorty lookin' innocent there, in Benetton gear
Nuttin' innocent here, this Henderson gear
Give us a year, to really see clear, through these Cartiers
And do it party? Yeah is what I'll probably hear
Sharkskin is what I'll probably wear, designed by Pierre — trust me
And I'm lovely with it
Cop a 4.2 and get ugly with it, snuggly fitted, rugby hittin'
Fitted and my Coogi knitted, compliments on the doobie did it
Got the movie rented if your crew be with it, yo

Make money money -- GO SHOPPIN!
Take money money -- GO SHOPPIN!
No matter what the weather, winter spring or fall
We'll be doin it... ""at the mall""

Most times I'm casual, but easily I switch
To some fly shit, like some silk suits by Paul Smith
And purchase some kicks by Kenneth Cole
Cop a Hilfiger, or Polo goose, for when it's cold
Armani, and 
Gaultier
 specs cover my eyes
The definition of jiggy so you best to recognize
At the mall, I'm baggin' up, much more than gear
Victoria, be whisperin' mad Secrets in my ear
She wanted me to knock her in the back of Foot Locker
I chuckled as she kicked more game than soccer
Others try to copy, I see 'em when they mock me
Baseball cap bent, the fresh scent, Issey Miyake
All the way from Green Acres to the Beverly Center
Heads turn, and I'm the main concern when I enter
At Albee Square, niggas wouldn't even dare
With that fake thuggish ruggish when them Brooklyn kids be in there
Saw 
 sweet for my girl
Stylin', on the cell phone smilin', it's my world
Can't forget the Avirex, pocket for the royalty checks
My crew be showin' loyalty, plus utmost respect
Yo son, go pioneer them bimbos, while I get some Timbo's
Later on that night you'll find them nymphos
That's how it goes cause mad heads be in the mall
Let's breeze, we got a show, plus I got another phone call",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-the-mall-lyrics

""Yo I'm not new to this I'm true to this"" -] Apocalipse
""Word up!""
""From New York straight talk... America's best""

Yo, it doesn't make sense, for you to compete against
This New York vibe that gets your whole body tense
Calm down, listen to a brother who knows
Cause the rappers out here come up with mad different types of flows
Switch-up, change-up, yo pull the range up
So we can build on this shit, for real that's how we came up
Used to ride the subway trains back and forth
Now I push an E-Class, four-two-zero of course
Still material gains, make one more aware
Of all the madness and the civil unrest that's out here
I doubt there, is anyplace more complex
You can get lost in the sauce, New York'll have you vexed
Who's next to get served, herbs'll get knocked off
Burning flammable rappers, is how I get my rocks off
I pop your top off as if you were the bottle
Then I'll drain all your fluid, you're better off playing lotto
Bright lights, big city and the dark alleyways
New York we get the money all day everyday
""From New York straight talk, America's best""
""Yo I'm not new to this I'm true to this"" -] Apocalipse
""Word up!""
""From New York straight talk... America's best""

True 
if you can make it out here, you can make it anywhere
That means a lot of rappers, they should stay away from here
Cause we still care, about the total artform
Niggas could sell more records but they still can't flip a live forum
Plus everybody out here ain't talkin true shit either
Mad niggas is fakin jacks, I don't like them neither
But the competition keeps me on point
That's why I lamp in the studio composin fresh new joints
From the streets, Medina, Manhattan, Staten, P-Lawn
The struggle continues, everybody wants to be on
The rat race, makes this lifestyle fast paced
I've loved it since the days of fat shoelace
Screwface me all you want, but I'm used to it
I'll never give up rep in New York, I'm true to it
From forty-deuce to Queens, back to East New Yi
We takin no shorts, and plus we showin no pity
Bright lights, big city and the dark alleyways
New York, we get the money all day everyday
""From New York... straight talk...""
""Yo.. I'm.. not.. new.. to.. this""
""America's best"" ""Word up!""
""From New York straight talk, America's best""
""Yo I'm not new to this I'm true to this"" -] Apocalipse
""Word up!""
""From New York straight talk... America's best""

You get bent up, sent up creek, without a paddle
You wanna battle? Well I live in New York
So think twice blink twice now your Roley and Lincoln's gone
Don't come into this rap game if you don't belong
You won't be on but for a minute anyway
You're just a scavenger, you don't live this life everyday
Rap is regional, so you can check the demographics
Everybody represent where they live, cause shit is drastic
Confusion, while I'm givin rappers contusions
And people don't realize that real hip-hop is losing
They wanna shut us down, and I say, ""Shut up clown!""
Cause New York is too corrupt and too tough to lay down
And just quit, cause MC's out here kick serious lyrics
And I come to you, with my infinite spirit
Not takin nothin from your hood or your set
But GangStarr could be a threat, in New York we rep
That's where it comes from, that's why you're feelin it
So why supress it, I'd rather be revealin it
Bright lights, big city and dark alleyways
New York we get the money all day everyday

Tons o' guns everybody's getting strapped
Tons o' guns got to watch the way you act
Tons o' guns real easy to get
Tons o' guns bringing nothing but death
Tons o' guns are in the streets
Nowadays
It's big money and you know crime pays
Check your nearest overpopulated ghetto
They greet you with a pistol not trying to say hello
Mad kids packed 'cos the neighbourhood's like that
Want some shit that's fat catch a victim do a stick
Kids pulling triggers, niggas killing niggas
Five-o they sit and wait and tally death-toll figures
It's crazy there ain't no time to really chill
Jealous motherfuckers always wanna act ill
22's 25's 44's 45's
Mack elevens ak's taking mad lives
What the fuck you gonna do in a situation
It's like you need to have steel just to feel relaxation
Tons o' guns

""The thing they know best is where the gun is kept""

Tons o' guns you got we got they got
The state of affairs yo it's like mad chaos
I know a kid who just passed the other day
They shot him sixteen times so there he lay
You can pray for this shit to like cease
But until then a nigga's going to pack a piece
And yo the devil's got assasination squads
Want to kill niggas 'cos they're scared of god
They got camps where they train they learn to take aim
At a nigga like a piece of game
And I'm not seeing that, them days are gone
'cos now we got  to put them where they belong
So me a rude boy from and in a brooklyn
Fuck the bullshit pain and suffering
I'm coming off with a foolproof plan
As if each every lyric was worth a hundred grand
I stand in the face of hatred
Letting off mad shots making devils run naked
Tons o' guns

Tons o' guns everybody's getting strapped
Tons o' guns got to watch the way you act
Tons o' guns real easy to get
Tons o' guns bringing nothing but death
Tons o' guns but I don't glorify
'cos more guns will come and much more will die
Why, yo I don't know black
Some motherfuckers just be living like that
They like to feel the chrome in their hands
The shit makes them feel like little big man
Twelve years old catching wreck
'cos there ain't no supervision putting kids in check
People get wounded, others they perish
And what about the mother and the child she cherish
The city is wild up steps the wild child
Tension anger living in danger
What the fuck you gonna do in a situation

It's a long way to go when you don't know where you're going
You don't know where you're going when you're lost
It's a long way to go when you don't know where you're going
You don't know where you're going when you're lost

What you need is more direction and get yourself some protection
I thought by now that you have learned your lesson
I'm stressin' points and slammin' all the joints you call the real shit
Correct shit, you know the bust the way you feel shit daily
I still don't think you understand
You lose the game, we get more props than Dan Rather
And it don't matter 'cause when you flinch, you're weak
So I'mma step just to speak about the counterfeit, unlegit type of people
Those cellophane ones, the ones that you can see through
It's poetic justice 'cause I'm mad with a pact
So precise, my insight will take flight in the night
And in the daytime, 'cause I don't come up with corny rhymes
I'm too devoted to the concept of gettin' mine
So here's the deal like Shaquille O'Neal
If you don't know what you're doing, how the hell can you be real?

(scratching) How far must you go to gain respect? Um...
(scratching) How far must you go to gain respect? Um...

Now in '93, realistically you should be
Well aware of all the evils out there
It's like a jungle sometimes. You get the message
You got to rumble sometimes, it's gettin' hectic
Emotions run deep as times run out
Solutions, it's time to find some out
So according to me, suckers are barred
From obstructing my discussion 'cause I rhyme too hard
You take a wiff like a spliff here like some fresh air
I came to claim shit this year (this year)
Take a stroll down the walkway or hallway or runway
Fuck with us, kid, you'll pay
I slay and yo, I'm still on the expressway
I kick my essay,
 then you know we don't play
So pray down on your knees, G
'Cause it's the best way, yes, the best way, 'cause...

It's a long way to go when you don't know where you're going
You don't know where you're going when you're lost
It's a long way to go when you don't know where you're going
You don't know where you're going when you're lost

(scratching) How far must you go to gain respect? Umm
(scratching) How far must you go to gain respect? Umm

There's a large amount of wack crews. For them, I got bad news:
Time to pay your dues, you fools
I'm like express mail, with the script that hits
Like the third rail, when I shock the spot, it's hot
From the rays of the sun
Original one the prophet sent to become
A law giver, 'cause you shiver when I quiz ya
All about the real necessities of life
All about the game and all about the name
G to the A to the N to the G Starr
We know who we are, but do you know who you are?
(Richard Pryor: You go down there looking for justice, that's what you find: just us.)

Never taking shorts 'cause Brooklyn's the borough
Peace to Uptown, to Queens and the Bronx
Long Island and Jersey get as fly as they want
But I must tell ya, where we rest is no joke
So let me break it down to sections for you slow pokes
Fort Greene, Bed Stuy, Flatbush, Brownsville
Crown Heights and East New York will be down till
Medina takes respect for the styles we bring
'Cause in Brooklyn, we be into our own thing
Atlantic Terminals, Red Hook, Bushwick
Come to Brooklyn fronting, and you'll get mushed quick
We ain't just known for flipping and turning out parties
But also for the take no bullshit hotties
On the subject of blackness, well let me share this
Brooklyn is the home for cultural awareness
So in all fairness you can never compare this
Some good some bad, little hope for the weak
Dangerous streets and Coney Island Beach
All this included when you go for a tour
Some can get scandalous and outright raw
When you step, step correct and watch where you move
We pay dues so we ain't trying to lose
Here in Brooklyn, the home of the black and the beautiful
For a rough rap sound, ain't a place more suitable
Other cities claim this, and others claim that
But let me give some props to the place where we be at
B-R-double O-K-L-Y-N
I came here for a visit and ever since then
I've been incorporated with select personnel
Right here in Brooklyn, the place where we dwell

Brooklyn
Way out in Brooklyn
Those who live in Brooklyn know just what I'm talking

Peace to Boston, Philly, Connecticut, DC
All the East Coast cities are fly to me
Peace to everybody down south and out west
But for me, Brooklyn, New York is the best
Don't be afraid to venture over the bridge
Although you may run in to some wild ass kids
Take the J train, the D or the A if you dare
And the 2, 3, 4 or 5 also comes here
There's so much to see 'cause Brooklyn's historic
Fools act jealous but you have to ignore it
So I just lounge with the fat clientele

The Planet,Hard to Earn,1994.0,"Boom bash dash, I had to break, I had to getaway
Packed my bags, to leave for good, it was a Monday
Kissed my mother, gave my pops a pound
Then he hugged me, and then he turned around
I threw the duffelbag over my shoulder
It was time to get props kid, cause now I'm older
Time to fend for myself jack
So I'mma go for mine, and maybe never come back
Stopped at the lye spot before I hit the train station
Needed some boom for the mental relaxation
It took the last of my loot to make this move, troop
But I ain't even tryin to work in a suit
Plus my aunt's got a room that's for rent
As long as there's no hoes and I don't come home bent
So fuck the bullshit, I'm Audi
I'm on a mission, cause if I stay I'll go crazy
I'm gonna make it god damnit
Out in B-R-double-O-K-Lyn, The Planet
They never fake it just slam it
Out in B-R-O-O-K-Lyn, The Planet
Crash boom bang I used to hang at Four Corners
And all the spots in Beantown where niggas carry burners
But I was more turned on by the microphone
So one cold morning, I left home
Next I'm smokin blunts on Van Siclen
Or workin in a mail room Uptown, feelin sick and
Tired, of payin all these fucked up dues
I wasn't tryin to lose -- I refused
Had a chick Uptown, one in Queens and one in Jersey
Sometimes all you need to get by, is a girlie
But yo I still wasn't happy
I seen a lot of ill shit on my block, happen nightly
East New York is no joke kid
And peace to my man Hass doin his bid
I went to Flatbush to buy incense and weed
Stopped at the bookstands for somethin to read
That shit was rough cause my pockets was bare
And like the sayin goes, sometimes life ain't fair
But in my heart there ain't no quittin
So I stayed up late, to write some rhymes to some rhythms
Seconds away from just flippin
But fuckit I'll maintain, one day I'll be hittin
See I'mma make it god damnit
Out in B-R-double-O-K-Lyn, The Planet
I'll never fake it just slam it
There in B-R-O-O-K-Lyn, The Planet
And you can, walk the walk talk the talk but don't flaunt
Cause little shorty's scheamin on your rings and fronts
But don't sweat it, cause that's the life out here
A lot of niggas, be livin real trife out here
I got my own place in Bed-Stuy
Known to many others, as Do or Die
Malcolm X Boulevard and Gates Avenue
Smokin up the fat trey bags with the crew
Me and the niggas Troy and Squeaky
Used to twist Dutch Masters, we got nice weekly
I used to build with the brothers by the spot
They had to hustle but they still knew a lot
To get my haircut had to go to Fort Greene
On Myrtle Ave, to get a fade with the sides clean
Then to Fulton just to look around
Just to roam around, and find a chick to go Uptown
And check a movie or some shit like that
I couldn't spend much but yo my game was fat
I remember this one chick, she brought me a beeper
Then one week later, she got me some sneakers
But then I stepped, cause I found out about her rep
And I ain't goin out bein no bitch's pet
But anyway I used to lay up in the crib
Listening to Red and Marley, wishin I was on kid
Saved my dough, stayed on the down low
Lounged and drank 40s with Tommy, Hill and Gusmoe
And Lil' Dap used to come by strapped
Nice off a L cause we stayed like that
Sometimes I used to miss my moms
Gunshots in the twilight, people fightin every night
But I'mma be aight still
Cause I'mma keep writin shit and perfectin my skills
I'm gonna make it god damnit

I am effective here 'cause I select a clear
Method for all, suckers I maul, they fall and scrawl
Into the pit of purgatory
I go for glory, I'm takin' inventory
Countin' all the tough luck ducks while I narrate
Relate and equate, dictate and debate

I use sincerity, but still I bury the
Doubts and questions of all the skeptics

There's nothing so-so 'cause I know
Right about this minute, I'm in it, admit it I did it to you

The proper mission for us and yo, this is a must

Upon you the fact that, I use my tact at
Rhymin', cold climbin', and chill while I attract that

Tryin' to riff, so let me uplift and shift my gift

The brother who must live and give with much insight
Foresight to ignite, excite and delight
And you might gain from it or feel pain from it
Because I'm ultimate, and I'm about to let off
Knowledge, wisdom, understanding
Truth with couth, so won't you throw a hand
In the air, put up a peace sign and please find
That though we're feelin' good, we should, we could, we would
Stop! Think for a moment, okay?
And then sway while I convey that we must do away
With all the stress and the strife, God bless your life
Use kindness and never blindness
And you will find this perspective is best, check it out
These are the words that I manifest, I manifest

I convey that what I say will awaken you today
I be jockin' while I'm talkin', but any way
That you put it, I'll give you lyrics to live to
Righteousness rules, so I forgive you
This time for you are bein' very ignorant
That's insignificant, I guess you figured and
Hoped to be dope as me, I glee, you flee
Because the pressure's too much for you
I'm your professor, I got the touch to
Do more than the rest who fess and can't compete
I'm elite, I'll defeat, delete and mistreat
Make mincemeat of other fools 'cause I'm the brother who'll
Snatch up the funds and make lonely ones

Ain't no emotion when he pulls the trigger
Brief second of silence, then you see what he do to niggas
Pistols, rifles, grenades, whatever
He's a killin' machine, bought and paid for and clever
And way iller than the last nigga
Smoke a nigga in the club then dance right past niggas
Once in a while, there'll be one who'll stand out
Who's more than psycho, who'll take any man out
With a certain passion for sendin' bullets blastin'
A certain fashion to the way this nigga wax 'em
And this assassin gets mad satisfaction
From puttin' all this worthless scum out of action
A sense of pride in his skill
Looks in the mirror and salutes before he rides for the kill

Funded different type of weapons, he got plenty of them
If you pass him on the street or see him in his spot
He's always calm, cool, collected, very rarely is he not
Hit man, with ice in his veins
Does the job so precise they up the price with his name
Shadowy figure, never too loose with the lip
Forty-four long in his coat, deuce-deuce on his hip
Baby nine in his boots and his trunk is full
This nigga's on some shit and can't be fucked with, fool
In the grimy world of highly-paid hustlers
First they get goons to muscle ya, then get him to touch ya
You wouldn't wanna get in his way, nor his associates
Or a tombstone bearin' your name will be appropriate

Set up my offense, commence to kill
I'll be leading from beginning to end
And after I pound ya, you're gonna wanna make friends
And make amends for the silly, trash you were talking
Take a walk and your shots I'm swatting

You're weak, see, I'm rough hardcore
And even be down to give you a rematch
After I wax and tax that butt
When I slam the alley-oop, you can rally troops
But I'll play the awesome defense
I'll pick your pocket, and send you to the bench
With tears in your eyes as you realize the prize is for me
Yes all the money
Son, my form is too nice, my handle's precise
I'll take you right or go left
Because my game's so def, and now you're mine

1/2 & 1/2,Full Clip: A Decade of Gang Starr,1998.0,"Here comes the revolutionist, executionist
Flip a triple six into three nines, cause a crucifix
Each man holdin, no man foldin
Coast is clear and Premier's in the green tank rollin
Prepare, get on your post and stand clear
They wantin to shut us down but the home team's here
What? You act like you're sweet or something
This ain't no Desert Storm bullshit war, we all dumpin
CODENAME, Jamal Grinnage
Wit six clips of teflon, suited in camoflagued
Got kevlar helmets wit masses
Wearin MOPP gear in cause they try to infumigate us wit gases
MISSION--to seek and destroy
We were sent to get rid of you, make the situation critical
First Family will gradually, lift that ass up like gravity
And turn your body frame into a cavity
NFO--that's No Fair Ones
Watch me nine milly turn into a flare gun
Sparkin wit the same marksman
Known for gunnin and runnin and bombin
Wit the ?lyrics? squeeze of my gun barkin, YA HEARD!!
You know my family style
I'm goin out wit my gun in my hand like Big Mal
I ain't got nuttin to lose, so move on me if there's something to prove, fool
This is war
Chorus
""There's a war goin on outside no man is safe from"" 
""So what you gonna do since you know now""
""There's a war goin on outside"" ""It's impossible to stop"" 

This world's a twisted maze, but I got the swiftest blades
My swords they can slice and dice precise ways
Those who come against me, can get blazed, sprayed and laid
No trace, just a glimpse of my face, hittin the shade
You look up, there's a full moon in the sky
And all my would-be enemies, yeah they're soon to die
Livin in this warzone, we frequent fly at home
Many of us grow violent prone, ain't tryin to be dyin alone
So I'mma take the competition wit me, Lord forgive me
But a whole bunch, of blood-suckin punks, is out to get me
In a flash of a moment, I slash vital components
Tryin to scheme on me and my team bitch, you know we own this
We can scrap, wit guns, knives, chains and bats
Whatever baby, erase that ass quick fast off the map
Plus they better bring, medical attention after I swing my weapon
Won't be no recovery, no divine intervention
No prevention, from gettin hung in the streets where I'm from
'Nuff blood shed, this war's just begun
Chorus scratched and cut up 2x

How many predators out there that want me
That's how I stand off, NOW
I come to diminsh every one of you blood suckers
Hands off, lay em down NOW
ALL CULPRITS, be alarmed
First Officer Danze reportin for 'Nam
When I'm bringin the storm, I'm all in
Yes I done stepped in the chest of many men
THEN AGAIN, it's a part of my persona like post ups and marijuana
IIAAAH, scout's honor,  FIRE
From all angles, that's how we was trained
Either slay or be slain, it's in the game for my soul
To be as cold as the blood in my vein
Knowin my name, help niggas perform abnorm
FIRST FAMILY, let's get it on
Just keep in mind I'm a marksman, I'm sensitive about that there
So you better watch what you say to me, hear?
PLAY WIT EM fierce, know where to run
So I post and defend, forgive me Father I may sin
And thou shall remember the code of the street

Conspiracy,Daily Operation,1992.0,"You can't tell me life was meant to be like this
A black man in a world dominated by whiteness
Ever since the Declaration of Independence
We've been easily brainwashed by just one sentence
It goes: ""All men are created equal""
That's why corrupt governments kill innocent people
With chemical warfare they created crack and AIDS
Got the public thinking these were things that black folks made
And every time there's violence shown in the media
Usually it's a black thing so where are they leading ya?
To a world full of ignorance, hatred, and prejudice
TV and the news for years they have fed you this
Foolish notion that blacks are all criminals
Violent, low lifes, and then even animals
I'm telling the truth so some suckers are fearing me
But I must do my part to combat the conspiracy

The S.A.T. is not geared for the lower class
So why waste time even trying to pass
The educational system presumes you to fail
The next place is the corner then after that jail
You've got to understand that this has all been conspired
To put a strain on our brains so that the strong grow tired
It even exists when you go to your church
'Cause up on the wall a white Jesus lurks
They use your subconscious to control your will
They've done it for a while and developed the skill
To make you want to kill even your own brother man
Black against black you see it's part of their plan
They want to send us to war and they want to ban rap
What they really want to do is get rid of us blacks
Genocide is for real and I hope that you're hearing me
You must be aware to combat the conspiracy

Even in this rap game all that glitters ain't gold
Now that rap is big business the snakes got bold
They give you wack contracts and try to make you go pop
'Cause they have no regard for real hip-hop
They'll compare you to others and say: ""but yo, he sells""
And you know in your heart that he's weak as hell
So you say: ""I ain't doing that corny stuff""
But they tell ya that your chart positions will go up
Sometimes they front big time and make you many promises
And when they break 'em that's when your mama says
""Son you're making records but that guy seems shady""
It could be too late and your career could be played, G
I hope you listen to the things that I'm sharing, see
We all have a job to combat the conspiracy",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-conspiracy-lyrics
All 4 Tha Ca$h,Full Clip: A Decade of Gang Starr,1999.0,"""Take the money never have to run"" (3X)
""Here's how it goes..""

All for the cash man, niggas'll be ready to blast man
Mad hoes, 'll be quick, to give up the ass man
Traitors, they'll be robbing your stash man
Don't wanna end up like the last man
If the price is right, niggas can get trife awright
They plot and they scheme, all day and all night
And they might even get elaborate enough
To plan the illest kind of crime, fuck the average stuff
Like this chick who was kickin it, with this baller
Pretendin that she loved him, only really loved dollars
Holla'd at his man so they could, rendezvous
Said to his man, ""Forget him, I'm fond of you""
So after the screw, she put him down with her plan
The utmost betrayal, this nigga's down with her man
But the sex changed everything, they conspired to snake him
Talked about the best time, and best way, they could take him
While in bed, she told him just where her man kept his dough
She said, ""Yo, tonight he's bout to cop some blow
And I know, there's at least, 50 grand to show
Bring a gat, wear a mask, and come through the window
I'll leave it open for you, he won't never know
So run in, grab the money, later on, you and I can flow
If we do this shit right, he won't fight
Break out with the cash and stay your ass out of sight""
So the nigga sat back, but little did he know
He was about to ruin his life over a silly ho
And really though, the whole shit went wrong
Cause when he came through the window and pulled out it was on
Money they was gon' rob was high, on some shit
Dukes with the mask, told him, ""Run your shit""
He said, ""Fuck that shit!"" So they tussled n shit
Then BLAOW, the burner spit, and the chick's man got hit
He died, his man had no loyalty, she's locked up as an accessory
His man's doin life, what a tragedy
All for the cash man..

Check the Technique,Step in the Arena,1991.0,"You puny protozoa,
 you're so minute you didn't know the
Gang has been watchin' but instead of just squashin' you
I'm scoopin' you up out of the muck you wallow in
Like a chief chemist,
 other scientists are followin'
Plannin' to examine you on a Petri dish
Sticking you and frickin' you just a teenie bit
I'm clever with science, but never relyin'
On false words from cowards who forever be tryin'
Insisting they come off, I let 'em get some off
Then come back with drum tracks their ears could get numb off
Blockbustin', like makin' love I'll never stop thrustin'
Into your system, so just listen
I'm like a neurosurgeon, operatin' with a purer version
I write prescriptions of words that fit in
The dope gets prescribed 
as I kick it live
'Cause it's more than a style, it's conceptual genius
My effect on the scene is to project that I mean this
You deadbeat, wait until you see my next feat
I get respect for the rep when I speak
Check the technique

Check the technique
Check the technique
Check the technique
Check the technique, see if you can follow it

I'm rushing you like a defensive end
 as I recommend
That you comprehend, I could stomp you in
A battle, contest, or war, what will occur
Will be the forfeiture of your immature
Insecure for sure, meek, weak visions of grandeur
To rudely awaken you, I then'll be breakin' you
Taxin' without askin', attractin' a snake in you
Makin' you succumb to the drums of Gang Starr
By far we are truly gifted ones, son
But if you were to speculate or estimate us losin'
You'll be dyin', tryin' to face the fate of your delusions
'Cause miscalculation is all you're statin'
So I'm chumpin', puntin' punks just like footballs
'Cause I wanna put y'all back in the mess hall
To clean up the slop, and stop all the bullcrap
Your rap's crazy wack, so don't try to pull that
You're lackin' the vernacular, I'm slappin' ya and cappin' ya
And closin' your jaw, 'cause you can't mess with Gang Starr
The Guru and Premier always dope with the blessed beats
Dance your ass off, Hobbes, check the technique

Check the technique
Check the technique
Check the technique
Check the technique

""Bon voyage"", ""Sayonara"", ""Arrivederci""
Your ass gets busted, doodoo mustard, you tried to work me
You irked me, because you copy and falsify
And I don't care how many step up, 'cause you all could try
To wish and fish for a style, here's a fishing rod
These rhymes are hittin' hard, constantly I'm gettin' large
Inevitably, I readily kick a slew
Of lyrics so deep, so don't sleep, but just peep me
Puttin' methods on records and spinning for each millisecond
33 RPMs displays the art of men
And as my rhymin' builds you see my time it's chill...
And then I look upon weak ones
I'm teachin' each one so they become redone
Essays are relayed to twist you up like French braids
Or tied up like corn braids, 'cause I got a strong rage
Force like police raids to never be delayed
I once was the least paid but I made the grade
'Cause this ain't a slave sale and I ain't the same stale
Rapper, no, I'm not a phony microphonist with no class or
No type of real appeal or real talent
And it makes me violent, man
To see all of these peewee bee MC wannabes
Making G's 'cause some dumb companies
Have lots of money but no idea of what is wack and what is dope
So check out what the Guru wrote
'Cause I will prevail, give you tales as I unveil
Have enough brain cells so I can stay paid well
Now I'm in the driver's seat, and rockin' the liver beats
Bouncin' and boomin' and blastin' you to the next seat

Soliloquy of Chaos,Daily Operation,1992.0,"Five carloads deep, time to go to a show
Got massive crew and we're ready to roll so
I grab my gear, hop in the whip and ride
Premier, he's got the fly dope system inside
But my shit cranks too and we've got mad tapes
Of all the underground groups with the lyrics and bass
Off into the New York night we go
Dre Large got the camera, Biggest Gord's got three rolls of film
So we can take the macked out photos
Tommy Hill, The Damaja and my man Guzmo
Corey and Smurf and Lil Dap's got a forty
My man Gary and Shiz and the Nutcracker Shorty
Mike Rhone, chilling like Capone
Robinhood known as Mel with the clientele
Mo, JT, Mega, and can't forget Black
Big Rob and Sincere, yes the posse's fat
Outloud pulls up plus there's Sid and O.C
Big Mel from Strong I and H.L. the one and only
O Delicious, Eli, Bazz and Eon
And the aroma of the blunts has me thinking beyond
And to the rest of the crew, you know the bond is strong
And you know who's who, so let me not prolong
For this was a night to remember
I had on the beige Timbs with the two tone leather
So we get to the jam, the gig, the venue
Then we circled around and then drove into
The front, the place was packed, the line was long
I was bobbing my head 'cause the music was on
I turned it down then I peeped to my right
I saw this kid and his girl having a fight
Another kid walked up, mushed the kid in his face
And then the kid pulled out, bust him, and laid him to waste
A riot broke out, girls screaming and scheming crews
Started buck wilding, trying to snatch kid's jewels
After that 5-0 came and turned the party out
Then an ambulance came to take the body out
And we didn't even get all the equipment out
And we didn't even get to turn the place out
This can happen often and it's really fucked up
So I'll ask you to your face, homeboy what's up?
Did you come to see my show or to the stupid nigga playoffs?
Killing you and killing me, it's the soliloquy of chaos

Chaos x2

And if you live in the cities where the streets reek warfare
People getting nowhere but you goin' for yours there
You'll find it doesn't pay to front or play the role
You could get stole or maybe beat with a pole
Then you'll wanna retaliate, regroup and come back
So you set the brothers up for a sneak attack
Whether you'll die or kill them, it's another brother dead
But I know you'll never get that through your head
'Cause we're misled and misfed facts, we're way off
Killing you and killing me, it's the soliloquy of chaos

Lovesick,Step in the Arena,1991.0,"Strangely enough I've been struck
Affected by her smile, and yo, her style is worthwhile
And knowing that I'm deep like a river, I feel I should give her
Things that those others can't deliver
Contrary to what I had wished, it seems that I've been dissed
But hey, I don't want to miss this
Wonderful opportunity, my boys, they try schoolin' me
But see I know what I want
Someone who'll be there for the whole nine, this honey is so fine
But now she's hung up the line
Upset because I told her I'm busy, she made like a grizzly
And started chewin' my head off
Screamin' that I spend more time with friends
And also, she said I ruined her weekend
I said ""I know the stuff we had planned but please understand
Right now I'm loungin' with my man""
I guess I didn't realize I'd hurt her, she said I had the nerve to
Just neglect her like that
Then she started bringing up past things and she kept asking
How come our love isn't lasting?
I said, ""Hey baby, please calm down 'cause I'm still around
And it's for you that my heart pounds
Can I call you later on? You say I treat you wrong?
But why you flippin' on me?""
She said something else and then click
Left me alone on the phone with the tone
And now I'm Lovesick

Love... sick, sick, sick, sick

Relationships can grip with the pain
Arguments in the crib, in the streets, on the train
I'm crazy fed but then still
When she ain't there I feel sad, I feel ill
Frowning 'cause I'm down in the dumps
The other night I took her out, so she could shake her rump
But after we were there for a few, some girls that I knew
Stepped up and asked me to come to
A party they were havin' at their house
I looked at my girl, and yo, she started walkin' out
I said ""Hey love, just wait for a second, and won't you just check it?
It's all a part of makin' records
Those were just some friends in the business
No need to get angry, so listen up while I kick this
And what about the things we discussed about havin' trust?
What's all this attitude stuff?
Now hon, you know that I wouldn't play you
But time after time, you let your jealousy sway you
Hey, don't you turn your back like that, come on, this is wack
You're heated up like a thermostat""
Then she stepped off in a whirlwind
And I don't know when or if I'm gonna see her again
I could've sworn she was the right one to pick
But now... man, I'm just Lovesick",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-lovesick-lyrics

Out here, life's a gamble, people scramble for dollars

And you could catch it, some royal heat from the snub
Since the streets is watchin' niggas might see us often
We told you rap cats we would keep it poppin'
See all I got is a lot of bad news for y'all
You're gonna need more than a lot of tattoos on y'all
You got an army, you still ain't got no wins against us
You're gonna need more than doo rags and Timb's against us
And fuck your goons cause we always get what we're after
We bought you this book of torture, this one is Capture

""Put your money in the bank, and hold rank""
""Give a nigga pain"" - Big Shug
""Listen to a brother who knows"" - Guru
""It's the militia"" - Freddie Foxxx

There's one ripped out the frame, felony act
Everybody get the fuck up, welcome me back
I'm the unseen hand that controls 200 niggas
Pouring wild on the street out of unseen vans
I'm the law of the land, the rawness of man
That'll show up on stage, puffin' on contraband
Capture, duct tape wrapped ya, slapped ya
Served up my Venus and Serenas, cocked back
Clapped ya - to Internet emcees I'm virus
I'm a warrior, niggas screamin' ""Bumpy shot Cyrus""
I'm checked in to every hotel that you lay in
Niggas come to my suite to pick up heat
Y'all know who wrote the bible in rap, for keepin it real
Y'all know who buck fifty your face, I'm keepin it Seal
It's capture, get out the truck, I'm keepin' your wheels
Clapped ya
, cause you've got a gun you never conceal
I leave my hardcore demeanor in every rap arena
And underground club that I play in
I spit raw verses that y'all ain't sayin'
Cause your soul was bought for what they payin'
You wanna have Bumpy's heart you got to have Bumpy's chest
I'll bust right 'till I find just Bumpy left
I'll bust mics 'till I have just enough breath
To take your heart, it's thug grand death

Word to Joe Frazier, got ta do what pays ya
Give a nigga pain, like dysplasia
But close your hips in, nigga you can't win
I walk around, with a scowl and a grin
Parties try to rock me, chicks try to clock me
Niggas try to block me, but they can't stop me
I'm a bad man, understand where I come from
Treatin niggas dumb, as I drink my rum
I'm a mad man, I get respect with the Tec
Put punks in check, Shug's on the set
I'm the one with the game, the twelve round
CRACK to the concrete, from the underground
I'm a bad nigga, how do you figure to take me
You cannot break me, so don't mistake me
For your brother, I'm not a punk motherfucker see
I did my time, and now I'm FREE
I'm a dope one, ready to rip and wreck shop
I will not stop, I won't be dropped by the cops
I'm bad, understand me with the game I kick
I got crazy bitches like a Trojan on my dick

Yo Hobb we got more rep than Lucky Luciano
Suckers we wet to the sound of the dope piano
This is something you can't handle, here's one example
I got your head as a trophy up on the mantle
Each and every sect we wreck, the crowd's electrified
Mystified, you get dissed, when you try, you die
Fish niggas, they get fried upon my skillet
I kill it, fuck it, my shit is on hit
And hittin you blaow (BLAOW) so what you wanna do now?
You stepped up, I whacked ya, you crept up, I smacked ya
Got infinite length, with the strength of a real master
If you don't bow down now you'll get plowed down now

Swing my left jab first, and then come in with the right

That's you and you and you, and oh yeah you
You can't get with this or take me down
I'm always laughin HA HA cause you punks are clowns
Since I'm passin emcees, with my skill
I'm up on the hill, and I force them dudes to chill
Rippin up shit as I do, because I'm violent

Jeru the Damaja

Yo this is your host with the most
The grand-high exalted, never faulted
Known as Guru, sticking it to you
And this your co-host with the co-most
The mystic majestic, left right, left kick
Jeru the Damaja
Ayo, sup?
Yo, wassup, son?
I heard some crabs all in it, talking about how you drink 40's and this and this and that
What?
Tell me how you feel about that
Yeah, whatever, whatever
Ayo, Premier speed up this track and I'ma drop the latest facts

As I deliver rhymes with ease and walk around with my head up
I'm dead up serious so don't be getting too curious
Motherfuckers always wanna know what makes me tick
I'll pull a phrase out quick cuz I'm dipped and I'm slick
You thought that I would slip cuz you seen me drinking 40's
It shocked you, then you told your friends you saw me
Well say what you want cuz all of mine is intact
In fact I'll have you open like a hooker's gap
I like to catch a buzz cuz I get into the beats more
MC's are washed up like dead fish on the seashore
Save the talk cuz you know I walk that walk
Hitting city to city but I make my home in New York
I know the time with this rap shit cuz they got it all backwards
They need to take a hint or catch my microphone imprint
Straight to the dome through the skull to the tissue
Call me Guru I'll diss you if you're pressing the issue
Not my style to be sweatin' all the stupid ass rumors
I take it as a compliment and fuck you too
If you're scheming on the chance to put a stain on my name
Don't even think about it cuz ain't no shame in my game

No shame in my game

Stick to the subject I ain't afraid to be real
A lot of MC's fake hard just to gain appeal
I like some gangster rap, don't like the prankster crap
So I get past all that by kicking straight up facts
There ain't no reason to shoot unless you got beef
If you pull out and you don't use it than you may catch grief
Toolies and techs ain't toys but kids got 'em today
And if they're ready to spray best get the fuck out the way
I try keeping my sanity by thinking of better times
If I write clever rhymes then maybe I'll climb
But what the hell's success if the mess ain't changing
50's still corrupt stupid gangs still bangin'
Stick up kids still stickin' nasty hookers still trickin'
All the pimps still pimpin' and all the crackheads trippin'
While the dealers still sellin' so I'll refrain from the yellin'
And the preachin' cuz who the fuck would I reach man
Niggas don't wanna stop that, they wanna live fat
Who'd wanna clean up their act when the papes come in stacks
They live for the minute and they're all wrapped up in it
It's an unfortunate state for many it's too late
Now death stalks the streets and it's right at your gate
So bug, lose your mind but I ain't goin' insane
I'll kick the fly lyrics cuz ain't no shame in my game


Life's a bitch so who are we to judge each other
I know I got faults I ain't the only motherfucker
Stuff I heard about you wasn't too cool you know
Like how you smoke wools and that your girl's a ho
But I don't listen to shit unless the story's legit
Knuckleheads need to quit cuz they be riding the dilsnick
But I'll be taking care of business regardless
And when it comes to rhyming you know I'm hitting hardest
So you can kick dirt but in the end you'll feel pain
You little sucker, there ain't no shame in my game",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-no-shame-in-my-game-lyrics
Mostly Tha Voice,Hard to Earn,1994.0,"It's mostly tha voice, that gets you up
It's mostly tha voice, that makes you buck
A lot of rappers got flavor, and some got skills
But if your voice ain't dope then you need to 

Up steps one, and he gets done
Then up steps another, he gets smothered
That's word to mother, or should I say moms
I drop bombs, scorchin niggas like napalm
Sucka, boy, get off my shit
Get off my dick so what I make butter hits
You better change your behavior, battling Gangstarr
No religion could save ya
My religion is rap, R-A-P
R-E-A-L-I-T-Y, G
Cause when I rock street kids rejoice
I got mad rhymes, still it's mostly the voice

It's mostly tha voice, that gets you up
It's mostly tha voice, that makes you buck
A lot of rappers got flavor, and some got skills
But if your voice ain't dope then you need to 
So when you think you know the whole you don't even know the half
You're not a threat to myself, and neither to my staff
Not the type to really dance too much, although I used to
Rather bust a fresh line, and get loose to
The blunted ill types of beats Premier makes
Makes your girl's rear shake, let me set it straight

It's mostly tha voice, that gets you up
It's mostly tha voice, that makes you buck
A lot of rappers got flavor, and some got skills
But if your voice ain't dope then you need to 

Some rappers use hooks to their shit
But if you took that shit out
And you took all the music out
What would remain? The voice no doubt
Bless my soul I control
When in pimp mode
My bank roll expands
I invest in my man
I plan, to keep rap real
So if your shit ain't fat then kneel
You squeal, feeling pain from my oral flex
What about oral sex, which chick's next
To open wide and get a chunk from a real brother
Yeah, some real funk from a real brother
They get sprung and most of them don't recover
But I don't diss em I just talk to em
Cause the sound, of my voice, it does a lot to them
So you and, the niggas right there
Be aware, like SWV, I'm right here
Waitin to correct your ass
And if you don't follow now I'll disrespect your ass
More Vicious than Sid, do a crime with no bid
I tell a bitch that I didn't when you know that I did
Take a trip to a land a-far
Then come back, and people still know Gangstarr
See I'm the ladies choice
Cause I got crazy styles, still

It's mostly tha voice, that gets you up
It's mostly tha voice, that makes you buck
A lot of rappers got flavor, and some got skills
But if your voice ain't dope then you need to 

Oh shit Shug, whattup
Just loungin, about to go do this shit in the studio
[Oh yeah, you just let me get on that shit
You always said I could get on, you need to let me get on that]

From what I see it's systematic how we push to addicts
Demographics make the street life hell or drastic
In the hood we see oppressive genocide
Cause if it's on it's on, you know at least 10 men'll ride
But on the other side, corruption runs deep
I'm aware of the conspiracies, discussion is brief
They're building more prisons, spendin less on schools

Association breed assimilation
Let me tell you what happened
I'm driving the other night, these two faggots pull me over
Talkin bout I got a broken taillight
They got a broken headlight
They shake me down, they tellin me
That they gon' come and see me tomorrow and have somethin for them

So now I got somethin for them

Who's the real criminals, take a look behind the scenes
Corruption and greed is commonplace routine
Guess it pays in many ways to have a few schemes
Shit, I know model citizens that ain't squeaky clean
You got dirty politicians, dirty judges and dirty cops
Everyone's on the take, the hood's filled with dirty blocks
How we gonna save the community, they worse than us
It's like a curse for us, police be the first to bust
Think about it, that RICO shits no fuckin joke
For them the evidence'll vanish in a puff of smoke
I been observant, I'll never be subservient
I guess you get what you deserve in this
From project hallways to courthouse hallways
Some prevail, most see jail, this happens always

I want more power, I'm gainin more troops
I'm gaining more respect cause I want more juice

Jazz Thing,Full Clip: A Decade of Gang Starr,1990.0,"""I would like to play a, little tune I just composed not so long ago""
""Ms. Billie, Ms. Billie, Ms. Billie Holiday""
 
""Byrd?""  
""The music called jazz""

Its roots are in the sounds of the African
Or should I say the mother, bringin' us back again
From the drummin' on the Congo
We came with a strong flow and continue to grow
Feet move to the beat of the ?t'balo?
Now, dig the story and follow
For then it landed, on American soil
Through the sweat, the blood and the toil
Hear ""Praise the Lord,"" shouted on chain gangs
Pain they felt, but it helped them to maintain
Scott Joplin's rags, Bessie Smith's blues
St. Louis blues, they were all the news
Ringin' smooth, in all the listeners' ears
Fulfillin' the needs, and plantin' the seeds of a jazz thing
King Oliver's group was a train comin' through
To Chicago, bringin' the New Orleans groove
And when Satchmo blew, the audience knew
Basin Street Blues was no whorehouse tune
It was music, great to dance to
Great to romance to, with a lot to say to you
Relayin' a message, revealin' the essence of a jazz thing


In the 40's came be-bop, the first be-bop
The real be-bop, so let me talk
About Diz' and Bird, givin' the word
Definin' how a beat could be so complete
Playin' with ferocity, thinkin' with velocity
About ornithology, or anthropology
And even Epistrophy, and this is real history
Thelonious Monk, a melodious thunk
No mistakes were made with the notes he played
His conception, was recondite
A star glowin' bright among dim lights
The critics did cite that he sounded alright
And Charlie Mingus, such nimble fingers
Droppin' the bass all over the place
And Max Roach, cymbals sockin'
Bass drum talkin', snare drum rockin'
Restructurin' the metaphysics of a jazz thing
John Coltrane, a Man Supreme
He was the cream, he was the wise one
The impression of Afro Blue
And of the promise that was not kept
He was a Giant Step
And there was Ornette Coleman, he was another soul man
The original invisible, playin' great music
I wonder why the bankers couldn't use it
Now, listen, see
The real mystery is how music history
Created by Whiteman or any other white man
That pretended he originated
And contended that he innovated a jazz thing
(Of course, we know who can really blow)
Scheamin' on the meanin' of a jazz thing

And this music ain't dead, so don't be misled
By those who said that jazz is on its deathbed
'Cause when Betty Carter sings a song
Ain't nuttin' goin' on but simply good music
And you won't refuse it
She's takin' her time, makin' the nuances rhyme
Sonny Rollins, tenor saxophone
With a big old tone, recitin' poems
With notes as words, and haven't you heard
(NEXT STOP BUTTER, RIGHT PAST OLEO)
Now there's young cats blowin'
And more and more people, yes, they will be knowin'
Jazz ain't the past, this music's gonna last
And as the facts unfold, remember who foretold
The 90's, will be the decade of a jazz thing

A jazz thing",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-jazz-thing-lyrics

Cause suckers be thinkin that shit is sweet
Niggas be thinkin that rap niggas ain't real, haha
Yeah well that's aight, that's aight
Let 'em think what they want

Yo I'm steady at it, them deadly habits
I pray for the best outcome son, but my dome's already shattered
By the shit that's occurred
Drivin home tipsy from the club, puffin herb, vision blurred
Thinkin bout them niggas who caught the drop
Who I gotta stop, who he caught, and who still gotta get popped
Stash box, feelin like Fish in ""King of New York""
Wifey do her thing for the God, she don't be bringin me pork
Cause there's enough deadly shit a brother be facin
Up in V.I.P., niggas drinks they be lacin
Got a nigga sweatin pacin, not ready to fall the fuck up
But ready to pull out, and back 'em all the fuck out
And my guardian angel, is always there to protect
And my supreme nature, keeps all them savages in check
How the hell did everything get so twisted
They say be careful what you pray for, so I guess now it's this shit

They will never know - what I do to get by
And them many times I almost died
They will never know - all the reasons why I flip
And now I gotta keep an extra clip
They will never know - what this stress is like
And why I'm on point, ready to fight
They will never know - all the pressure and pain
Don't give a fuck if they think less of me mayne

Deadly habits, they could be a number of things
Everybody got 'em, some people do ugly things
Excessive behaviour, it can get the best of you
Trust me, I'm a lot like the rest of you
I got issues, that haven't been resolved
You know like, money people owe me while they out havin a ball
(Mmm) Guess they too got deadly habits
Got me on a mission, to go and merk, each and every faggot
Manager's coked up, A&R's all doped up
Old school style, have 'em gagged up and roped up
Those deadly habits have me losin my cool
But yo the Son can't chill, so I'mma be abusin them fools
Pull the plug on 'em, pull the rug on 'em
Have 'em callin up, all their closest thug friends
Them niggas can get it too
This GangStarr shit is too deep, to even get into
So fuck you!


Fuck you wanna do, we way past 7:30
Be easy, too many brothers seem to go to heaven early
It's hell in these streets, but soon I'm on a hot streak
Who's in the hot seat, who had a felony beef
Yo I beat cases, with different attorneys
And I laughed at the racist DA's, who were wishin to burn me
My mom caught a heart attack, around the same time
News articles were published, around the same time
This depressed me more, but I stayed in tact
And that last corny chick I was with, she got played in fact
I know niggas that did dumb time, and dumb crimes
I fuck with real niggas, and never cowards with dumb minds
This country's got us in a fix

I'm down with dis, I founded this
So you should recognize the true authentic sound of this
The golden voice, holdin toys
But not playin, Guru and Preem', we like the golden boys
The chain and star, I'm angry pah
Cause you fucks ain't wanna give us what we aimin for
You stupid son, I shoot my gun
From the heart fool, you know that's where this music from
Protect your dome, respect the throne
This is Guru and Premier, and you can bet it's on

Flip the Script,Daily Operation,1992.0,"*Laughter*
Check this shit out

Brave is the knave who steps up to be slayed
By the one who forgave him for his first mistakes
He'd best behave, or I'ma send him a wave
Of some shocking volts, he doesn't know what he's talkin 'bout
He's kickin a bunch of crap so I'll be the judge of that
The boy lacks artistry and still he tries hard to be
An entertainer, instead he's a waste of
My time and your time so I'll kick the pure rhymes
Whenever you're looking for rap that's exceptional
And credible, straight to the G's you better go
'Cause Gang Starr's known to be prone to be
Masters of streetwise poetry and turntable wizardry
And it'll be a cold day in hell
When you hear that the Guru or Premier ever fell
Suckas get sales, but they fail in the long run
The kid who went gold, yo, that was the wrong one
The spotlight tonight is all on me
'Cause I'm the Guru, of the G-A-N-G
Taking out scrubs 'cause they rub me the wrong way
And I'll say, that they've still got a long way
To go, to show they can flow like a real pro
So gimme that loot and catch the boot from my steel toe
I'm changing the scenery and makin' 'em uncomfortable
Most MC's ain't really got no pull
Watch me stifle em quick with the gift and the wit
Make em quit all that riff as I flip the script

Like this yall (This Yall)
This yall (This Yall)
Du-du-du-du du-du-du-du
This yall

You know I flip, yes I flip the script
You know I flip, yes I flip, check it out
Fool listen, I know that you've been missing all this and
So my rhymes are gonna gleam, and glisten
Like a gem, and if you are the fake MC type
I'll shine so bright that I'll be blinding your eyesight
Your capabilities fall short
So I'ma treat you like a dwarf on a basketball court
Still you try to rap and even claim you got new styles
But rolling your tongue's been played out for a while
And you don't sound fly so why are you doing that?
You had a dope track but you're wack and you ruined that
I couldn't make out what you were saying
Your diction Is jumbled whereas me I'm conveying
Clear thoughts, to a crowd that's most critical
Booty duck rappers like you are just pitiful
I bet you couldn't name more than one pioneer
'Cause you didn't pay dues and you got on outta nowhere
But that's OK cause I'm peeping your card
And if rap was my house you'd be sweepin the yard
As I recline I'll find more chores to give ya
Like moppin the floors or maybe fetchin my slippers
So don't even trip or run off with the lip
'Cause as soon as you slip you know I'll flip the script


You know I flip, yes I flip the script
You know I flip, yes I flip the script
You know as I kick a bit flip the script without a skip
Butter roll MC's can get dissed like this
You'll never got none son I'll become troublesome
You rap like a simpleton and I hate scum
I can easily deflect your threats 'cause they're idle
My recital will break you down just like a fight til
The end cause I can take ten at a time
Give em all a fair shot to see if any can rhyme
Even if one is decent, I'll still get props
I'll kick the slick lines until the last one drops
As my powerful skills are unveiled, I'm tippin the scales
And weighing much more than your tall tales
Stop the exaggeration perpetration observe
And make a simple notation
Nobody, nowhere, no way, or no how
Is taking me out 'cause I can throw so you know now
Can you feel it, I bust the real raps
So lay off, stay off while I steal that
So-called title that you gave yourself
But you really ain't jack so yo you played yourself
And now you look from a distance as you sweat my tip
You know I'll whip you swift when I flip the script",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-flip-the-script-lyrics

The emotions that one goes through, over a loss of a loved one
Or friend then, knowing the cost of rebuilding and carrying on
It gets so damn hard in this modern day Babylon
And disease runs rampant, so many men carry arm
So many have a lonely painful road to travel on
Mothers losing sons, improper use of guns
Children go astray because their parents were abusive ones
I used to run with the illest guys
Through the realest eyes
I seen the realest and the illest die
The cycle continues, so many times the good ones
The young ones
So many misunderstood ones
Remembering their faces and voices
And when the wise man said
Life is full of choices
Some get caught up, others are innocent victims
All I know is they were close to us, and that we miss them

2 Deep,Daily Operation,1992.0,"I'm too deep, and yes much too complicated
My lines when stated are quite often underrated
So consider it a privilege to hear this
The weak-minded opinions could never come near this
For my outlook on life is a profound view
While the suckers act down thinking that they sound new
Only a few sound true
Me and the crew know who
'Cause see, me and the fellas have been waiting for a while now
Giving you the time to get your whack ass style down
You punks pop junk as if life is a fantasy
Knowing that hard is something you can't be
So you front but you could never call my bluff
You'll catch hell kid, you'll get dealt with

I never sleep, I always peep, rhymes creep
I'm too deep, I'm too deep

I forgive you, psych! I'm takin' your life
'Cause you continue to disrespect so I'ma get trife
But then again I think I'll spare ya
'Cause I know that all it takes is one rhyme just to scare ya
See, I'm the holder of the key
Don't ask me if I'm Muslim, don't say nothin' to me
I said I was raised like one, son, I had two cousins
They pushed me to find myself or else they knew I wasn't
Gonna make it and then end up a statistic
My life was twisted, I almost missed it
The chance, yes, the chance to make you feel good
I used to steal goods and fake my parents out real good
But now I got K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E of self 'cause I'm me
And the nation of Islam has my support
'Cause they try to reeducate ones who are lost
And the Five-Percent Nation takes other steps
To get through to the brothers on the corners with the reps
And in the prisons, givin' the brothers new visions
Of how we can gain wealth and gain self-esteem and dream
Of a total different scene, I dress clean, stand lean
Say what I mean and I'm out
Like a scout on a new route exhibiting clout

I never sleep, I always peep, rhymes creep
I'm too deep, I'm too deep

For right now, yo, my religion is rhymin'
Perfect timing, test the flow and climb in
Ansaar, Sunnite, Shiite, Jihad
All must regard that times are hard
Unite or perish is the message that I cherish
That goes for my people of all religions
If we're all black why have so many divisions?
Superficial factors are drawing us apart
Don't let it happen, let's put some respect back in
So before I act I think 'cause it's a brink of destruction
World corruption, what's up son, your gun is just one
And I just might have one or two or maybe even three or four
Plus an army of about 100 or more
But violence is never my first choice
I come in peace to release the effect of my voice

I never sleep, I always peep, rhymes creep
I'm too deep, I'm too deep",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-2-deep-lyrics
Put Up or Shut Up,The Ownerz,2003.0,"Stupid, you know it's time to sit and think, before we hit the brink
Lockerroom, at a prize fight, before he hit the ring
Like when I tell these corporate leeches they can't get a thing
Or when I tell relentless rappers they had better sing
The position that anyone holds could be up to grabs
I'm waitin up the ave to see if anyone folds
Since I was twenty-one years old and legal
I knew the difference between gimmicky gangsters and powerful people
I'm the reason, why the game is flipped
I'm the reason, why your aim is missed
I'm the reason why you're mad I only sprained my wrist
The reason my mindframe is trained in this
You like gunfire? Better acquire the taste
Cuz youf walk aroun' with full pounds by dem waist
Deface property, they be laced properly
Rules are rules, fools are fools, I react logically
Ain't no way, so come, make my day

Always talkin bout your dough and your wealth and fame
Youse a lame (Get out of here - put up or shut up!)
You got hot beats and kids that can spit mad fire?
Youse a liar! (That's whack - put up or shut up!)


Aiyyo I've seen the toughest of tough guys, the roughest of guys
Get reduced of their juice against the wall like small fries
All rise, it's time to do the damn thing

Crazy degrees of difficulties
Remain mackin chicks, O.G. shit, the ten prixs(?)
Please, you know my peoples want a lot, the corner's hot
We gettin love on y'all block
And that's gangsta, but a lot of shit ain't
Believe me it ain't easy like you sleazy niggas think
Uneasy niggas blink, when I step to the stage
And don't flinch, don't move a inch, I'm bout to empty the gauge
I've witnessed the bad shit, sickness and sadness
Always dreamed about what I would do, if I had shit
Drop jewels infinite for the blind deaf and dumb
Down with M.O.P. and Bumpy plus I just left Krumb

But I'm back.. ha, fresh out of the max
And I'm gettin at you cats
Aiyyo popped out the beast, met The Ownerz with the lease
Soldifyin contracts over dope beats
Learned a whole lot up in these streets
Like when to talk, when to spark, and when not to speak
I do the one before a gun come out
Plus y'all don't really wanna see Krumb dumb out
A ghetto doctrine to watch every pistol pop
And then while you watchin examine all options
Young bodies in the coffin more often
It stay the same from Brooklyn to Boston
Every interstate, more youth with the inner hate
Deep in the struggle, puttin food on they dinner plate
Hungry W.O.L.V.E.S. that roll thick in packs
And pray on you cats with the gangstafied raps
Extortion, only gettin left with a portion
Pullin out tools on them fools who be flossin",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-put-up-or-shut-up-lyrics

So I'mma flex my text just like a, major takeover
Chumps pass the mic over
Growin' more and more nervous when I serve this ass whoopin
Comin' straight out of Brooklyn, baldhead from the old school
Born to rule with more class than Billy Dee
To a pussy MC, you know a wuss MC
I'm like his worst nightmare when I'm on my killing spree
Pick the vic, who will it be?
Your vote may hold the key
It's up to you, tell us true
Who'll be herb of the day?
And when you fake, you break. When suckers choose, they lose
I'm like lethal, to you and your people
It's like an outrage, when punks step on stage
With the weak show, weak flow, and still make dough
So I'mma take dough from em, and then son em
Teach em how to really get biz like this
Me and my gang's gonna swarm

It takes at least, two to tango, so you can get strangled
From any angle, as I get buck on ducks
All the sexy girlies wanna push up close to
The man with the most who don't flaunt his ego
Some motherfuckers ain't as gifted
Not everyone can move the crowd and uplift it
I'm swift with the shit like a bullet's trajectory
So don't stand next to me
It's like a, warm sensation when my shells hit
You were wrong, you know what you did, so you fell quick
To the pavement, no signs of body movement
See I knew it, yo I had to do it
And it's cool to duel but don't slip up fool
Cause I'mma leave you dead and stinkin like a cesspool
And all the chicks know what's goin on
Cause baby, there ain't no sunshine when I'm gone
And you can beg for me to stay and parlay
But sorry, I gots to go, got bills to pay
See by nature I'm godly
When I touch the mic, it's never too hard for me
To let out, a mass amount of mad clout
Huh, me and my Gang's gonna swarm... Brainstorm

I'm gonna get ya
You might be bigger than me, so I'mma wet ya
Coming to your house to douse it with the
Molotov cocktail, I won't fail
Burn out your eyeballs, and leave a note in braille
So what the fuck you gonna do?
Yea I know I used to act relaxed but now I'm cuckoo
Come into my darkest, deepest thoughts
We fought I won, and now you're caught and bein' tortured
Water pellets dripped upon your forehead
But you can't move, because you're tied up

Industry or street? Fake or real?
Cold or hot? Truth or trash?
War or peace? Longevity or cash?

Here’s one for SPIN, Billboard, and Rolling Stone
Hip Hop is so organic, it’ll grow on its own
We watch 'em throw money at it with clout and power
But after a while, things faded out and went sour
Somebody lost their shirt, execs got fired
Some artist went berserk, took mad drugs and got wired
Hundreds of thousands, up to millions in promo
All wasted on garbage, now, that was a no-no
Oh no, what's gonna happen now to these fools?
These self-centered pricks were showered, proud of 'em too
Never that, 'cause I am the renegade realist
Street visionary, the end of days idealist
People often ask, ""What's the key to longevity""
How I'm so consistent and bring the heat incredibly
Intelligence is vital and always stay hood
'Cause this is our culture, and we need to make good

Business or art? Fist or steel?

You hear the tickin' and the tockin' on the digital watch
Yeah, time is money, and they don't find it funny
They'll show up where you live, make your environment bloody, buddy
They'll kick in the door, tell you, ""Get on the floor""
They bust a .9 and bust some rhymes, you like, ""Gimme some more""
Askin' you where your heart is, but you an artist
You was never as hard as you said you was
Maybe lyin', wasn't the smartest decision you ever made
'Cause this business ain't regulated
If you beefin' over beats in these streets, you'll never make it
Now you singin' to cops, that's your favorite tune, nigga
They ain't got Yelp reviews for goons, nigga

You couldn't tarnish my rep, so you crept away
Just behave and be a good son -- or else

Herb niggas are assed out, y'all get tooken
Or taken, and that's word to all rude bwoy Jamaican

And knees hurt, next you feel em bucklin
The huge pussy look on your face reveals the sucker
Inside of ya, because I checked the way you're ridin the

Never be able to touch GangStarr

We used to get blazed I know he's got a fat sack
Let's go upstairs grab a chair and unwind
So the la la can enhance our minds
The system booming let the bass increase
I find a seat so I can peep the chic
Ladies and maybe get my homeboys some ass
So all you gotta do is take like two pulls and pass


Even in the morning like the flavor of juice
A blunt adds spice and a blunt can spruce
Up your day but I'm not advertising, just telling of an aspect a part of our lives
And around the way there ain't no shame in our game
'Cause the fame is no thing, we get together and hang
And since you know I got dash and class
Then I'm after you so take two pulls and pass

I sit and write a rhyme, when I'm done get blunted x2
Get blunted x16",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-take-two-and-pass-lyrics

On you half-ass rappers, you ain't earnin' it, pa
So come to my class, then I can son you real fast
Just 'cause you comin' with cash, you still a wannabe ass
I get chicks state to state, offer me face from the gate
'Cause the sound of my voice makes their juices marinate
As opposed to those with mediocre prose
Wet you from head to toe, and watch you soak in your clothes

Whether wrong or right, a lot of people fight

Pull the rug from a brother?
Catch a slug from the toolie of a gun-lovin' brother
Violence, wylin', whatever, they know
The more rappers come, the quicker they go
This underground is mine, might even see me in a hoop'
Switch to a droptop coupe, why you cock blockin', dukes?
Baldhead Slick, I represent my clique
I got my little man loadin' the ammo, this shit is sick

Time for me to twist off a vocal fist off
Into your domepiece, Homepeace, I heard your chick wants to bone me
I get, wild like rugby, 
respected like Bugsy
Don't even ask me, cause I'm livin lovely
Born to succeed, foes bleed, true indeed
The oral combat will romp that, you're one of my seeds
When I first, busted on the scene
Nigga, you knew I had more than a gangsta lean
I mean my lean is gangsta though so check it
I'll stick an MC for his spot and sign in blood on his wack record
Boo-ya-ka, to your face as I ruin ya
Clown ya, dumbfound ya, while I'm screwin the
Fuck out cha girl as she steps into my world
I'm not the tallest, but that ass I'll polish
And if the hooker runs her mouth she gets cut off
But then you'll sweat her, cause like my leather you're butter soft
Your style stinks kid, ya garbage
And if you keep talkin shit, I'mma make ya pay homage
Cause the G to the U to the R-U, came too far to
Let you slide through, rhymes will scar you
And who the fuck are you anyway?
I catch more wreck in a minute than if you rhyme for ten days
Throw the cash in the pot
You betta dash nigga, cause I'm blowin up the spot

Unable to conquer the Gang, I ain't mad at cha

Keepin it real, no playin niggas or chrome
I'm way past the kid shit, brothers already did shit
You want some props? Yo dog, here's a biscuit
I'm a smooth nigga and my groove's bigga, move nigga
And we don't care who's wit cha, got the picture?
And you don't wanna hear the burners go pop
Gang Starr motherfucker, what, blowin up the spot
""I'm bout to blow the fuck up""

I go from one format then switch to the next
Reflex sets the pitch vocals rip through projects
Crazy shouts are heard all around
Cause the GangStarr sound carries more weight per pound
I got some brand new Timbs, so emcees sing new hymns
You betta repent, come correct, represent
Or get stomped, smacked and slapped, cap peeled back
I got you open, and now you cling to my sac
Get off, hands off, stay off, you're way off
You rookie motherfuckers it's the finals not the playoffs
I'll break you up into particles, to small pieces
Because your brain is miniscule
You little fool, come learn the tools of the trade
I made the rules so go to school and get played

Form of Intellect,Step in the Arena,1991.0,"Intelligent but not yet equivalent

Tell me, do you have a clue of what to do?
Can you groove to this smooth tune? You must presume
It's important for you to follow this creation
And hey son, life is more than having fun
So run and get some help with the problems that you face
Take a taste of the bass, put your perspective in place
Get real deep, so you can keep involved
Revolve and solve, so you can make the calls
Like a supervisor, he who is wiser than the others
'Cause they need someone to advise them to discover
Things that they don't know so the papers I will check
Then they'll start to grow to this form of intellect

Individual with intellect

When the road is too steep, do you have the stamina
First album took us two weeks, since then we have been plannin'
An exclusive attraction conducive to your satisfaction
Those of you lackin', we will put you back in your slot
So you can think and get a grip of
Yourself by yourself, and then you'll get a sip of
A gift that's equipped with the script that shocks
You can take a walk on God
With your mouth wide open, hoping you can find a
Way to display similar actions in a kind of mockery
'Cause you don't realize the cost to be
Creative genius please, I'm too clean to play
Glance per chance, watch Gang Starr perfect
And dance your pants like champs, to this form of intellect

Man with intellect

Valuable solutions we invent here
Break and remake the cupcakes to show we've been sent here
To serve you so swallow this and bite it
And why bring ignorance when we're inviting
You to get advancement, while you're on the dance tip
And don't you know the transcript will make you shake hips
Or chill at will, and with skill you'll learn some etiquette
Better get the subject or be last at the predicate
And get a set of headphones and speakers
As lyrical lessons manifest I will keep you
Abreast of the best in this rap mess
Oversaturated market full of wackness
I'm gifted, unlimited rhymes, universal
The Guru, nursing you with a verse spilled
Don't choke, and don't turn blue in a frenzy
Premier's severe, on the steel wheels he lends me
Spontaneous cuts, but not mainly just that
It's the scratching format, exact with maddening accuracy
Craftily, on the side or in back of me
Nastily, as if his name was Dick Dastardly
Original so get it yo the Gang gets respect
The chain and the star is a symbol, of this form of intellect

Positivity,No More Mr. Nice Guy,1989.0,"Now is the chance to advance and get an outlook
Create the circumstance, because I doubt books
Can relay, words this way, so I'll portray
A new image, and let's begin as
Members who pledge to, look up ahead to
A beautiful world, though we've been led to
Believe it will not be and, we still are seein'
Agreein' there'll be peace, the wealth will increase
And we'll prosper, you know like flourishin'
The rhyme I toss ya, it will be nourisihin'
I must bring, ideals for better living see
Because I do believe in positivity

Weak is the clown, much weaker is the fool
I'll overrule to duel and to school
For reasons that are so deep, I don't need no cheap
People to identify, I just say hi and bye
Since I'm an optimist, I'll turn and walk with this
Tape playing loudly, inside my headphones
MC's that crowd me, turn into headstones
Because I don't have time for, powerless minds or
Suckers who suck, because I find more
Interesting topics, you can not stop it
I drop it and rock it I shock it, that's how I'm livin' B
I like to live my life with positivity
""Positive but never negative""
* DJ Premier cuts and scratches *

Havin' nothin' to lose, so much to gain
Bein' grateful for my darker skin, I take you for a spin
And then begin to groove and sooth and move your whole
Crew, the Guru, and truth I wanna give to you
So watch as I break through to your dome
Cause I'm prone to give a message, then back home
Is where I'm goin', still knowin', my life's right
And that days to come, will be fun
I'll achieve, I'll receive, and I'll be livin' free
Me and my DJ Premier with positivity... positivity! Yeah
""Positive but never negative""

So if you're generatin positivity out there
You know that's the move
Yo me and Premier, we always got positivity

Run around the streets cold strapped like an alley rat
But now I'm gettin' much props like a fat cat
A young mack, but I don't think I'm all that
I just can't sweat another brother's bozack
So what the fuck, y'all, movin' on up
Gonna swim in big bucks, like Scrooge McDuck
And if ya don't like it and you wanna step up
Then open your mouth, and suck my nuts
Melachi the Nutcracker, I'm always gettin blacker
Fatter, I bust a fat rhyme to make your head shatter

Strictly, we keep it in the best perspective
Cause nowadays it's more than simply live and let live
A sedative, that's what these headcases need
Them rats'll get trapped soon as they taste the cheese
Black M. Casey fan, just pay us and scram
Watch us drop a new supply to up the daily demand
Phony critics wanna retract shit, once I spit again
And since we didn't finish the job, you gettin hit again


You fuck, you didn't listen when I told you before
When it comes to dope tracks, we be holding the raw
Do something stupid, and you'll be left holding your jaw
Put you punks on blast for not knowing the law
Don't deny yourself, learn to apply yourself
Or end up by yourself, I multiply the wealth
I got the titles, deeds, licenses and policies
Complete ownership, Don Gurizzu they call me
Primo said that we should just, lock it all down
See the bigger picture, so we can profit all around
Now everybody's riding the dick, once I spit again
And since we didn't finish the job, you gettin hit again


I be the owner of this style, owner of this talk, owner of this art
Peep the gully way that I walk
Many say that I rock, others hate but they jock
Now we racin the clock, po-po casin the spot
Call me greedy cause I feel like taking a lot
Vindication, cause they be fabricating a lot
From Cali to Canarsie, penthouse to the lobby
Roxbury to NC, Century Club to envy
Bout to take over the action, you know it's 'bout to happen
Cause our shit be hitting, and yours is plain ol'fashioned

So many rappers couldn't handle showbiz
While I'm steady rockin', so you know what it is
So many rappers made this their dream

So many one-hit wonders, it's like a spin of the wheel
You know I stay consistent and get it in for real
So many rappers wanna rock like this
But they got no stamina and they don't talk like this
Plus I've learned to avoid the traps
I truly love this shit, that's word to MTV Raps

Some'll go for popularity, to a little, then to none
Some'll get jacked 'cause they floss too much
Others'll leave the game 'cause they lost too much
Some got bodied before they were totally on
It's like when keepin' it real goes totally wrong

Others are brainwashed by their unlikely success

Many had major deals, big money and all that
On 106 & Park, in magazines and all that
So many had all that, so how did they fall flat?
That's why my motto has always been to just fall back
And watch the whole circus go by, I'm that guy
As soon as I appear on the scene, nigga, it's shy
So many pranksters with so many gimmicks
Wonder where they're at now, probably somewhere lookin' timid
It's all madness, there's too many to count
Everybody and their mom wanna rap, no doubt
Many come out with a bang, and their own new slang
Then end up back in the hood without a goddamn thing
Some make noise, they hit the top of the charts

The Meaning of the Name,Step in the Arena,1991.0,"The meaning of the name Gang Starr? Well, I'll tell you
It means how far my mind can excel to a greater type of thought
Brought by the things that I've been taught
In relation to things that I rebel to
Divine and combine with a sense of confidence
Accomplishments are achieved on floppy disc
But slopiness, I could never tolerate it
Not the Guru nor Premier, you don't know how long we've waited
While other groups have faded just like haircuts
We use sheer guts to open the ear ducts
Of your brain to expose every vain
'Cause you sound plain, insane, and mundane, it's a shame
You've got no beats, so you get no seats
At this table, you ain't stable with the mic cable
Cain and Abel, jealous brothers
And I knew some girls who were overzealous lovers
But back to the act of developing the Gang Starr track
It means that nothing can be wack
The music is picked right, the mic is gripped tight
The lyrics I kick right to a beat like Kryptonite
Power, not withstood by any mortal or immortal
To make you get on the floor 'til
Another dope jam we slam with precision
Bringing beams of light like the colors in a prism
Or reflections, through a spectrum
And all the soft silly suckers I'mma wet them
In other words destroy, boy, and then claim my fame...
This is the meaning of the name
(DJ Premier cuts ""what does it all mean?"")

Gang Starr, it means a lot to me
It means I'm free to bust rhymes sporadically
Gang represents my boys or a posse
So just back up off me
And the Starr symbolizes the power
Making the suckers and weak brothers cower
We got strong, intelligent minds with a street sense
Crazy offense, and stupid defense
Now, have I made myself clear?
Or do I have to call on DJ Premier?
For he and I make up the songs that you long for
Meanwhile ducks just knock on the wrong door
Waiting for a call or for the doors to open
'Cause they're hoping that they'll get chosen
But to be chosen is a divine gift
You better get a job quick
See, you can't rhyme and all your beats are weak
You oughta take a peak and check out the technique
Seek, and you shall find
Gang Starr stands for mastermind
Simple and plain and yo this ain't no game lame...

""Now what you hear is not a test""

Well goodness gracious, let me just take this
Time out to pull a rhyme out, and update this
For you and yours, simply because
Some MCs have luck but suck
So I pluck 'em like feathers on the back of a chicken
'Cause I'm mad like a pit when my man says, ""sic 'em""
Positive is the mindstate, but it could still mean that
I will kick a ill, malicious like mean rap
Suckers they forced me to knock 'em all out and
They think they know things like what I'm about and
They try to analyze, criticize, scandalize
The outcome is death, don't ask me to sympathize
Realize that I'm not to be played with
I'll flip so fast you won't know I'm the same kid
I'm tired and fed with all the weak stuff said
All the phony-baloney that went out like Pro-Keds
You've got no leads, so you shoot blanks
It's me the crowd thanks as I step to the top ranks
Bankin' my money, and investin' it wisely
Snatchin' up chumps when they try to sneak by me
I'm the dominant one, call me the prominent one
And as I'm speakin' I'll be bombin' the dumb
Deaf and blind 'cause I was born with a sharp mind
Eatin' MCs with ease like it's lunchtime
Or crunchtime, when they get done without warning
I'll bust that butt from nighttime 'til morning
Your song's boring, and so I'm scoring
Much points 'cause when it's time to throw joints
I cause havoc, the mic I grab is like savage
I invade the stage, and make you get off
The force is like a .38 blowin' your head off
And that's just in case you might be wearin' a vest
'Cause you're simply a pest in this mess, I suggest you
""Take a rest""
""If this meaning doesn't manifest, put it to rest""
""If this meaning doesn't manifest, put it to rest""

Don't ever sleep son, peep one or two of these lines here
Arranged by a great brain, delivering rhymes clear
And concise with a nice dope voice and
Killin' the fakes like a taste of some poison
Punks are thinkin' they're all of that, their voices are all flat
They're findin' their names in a wack rapper's almanac
Me follow that hollow crap, no way Jose
I'll seek out a better sound to somethin' Premier plays
Days will go by, and soon you'll know why
MCs like me will rise like the Enterprise
Starship, headin' straight for the target
Destination, a place where no perpetration
Is permitted, the Guru is with it to explain
How some MCs are scared to ride on a 4 train
Or any other train in the city for that matter
Playin' a role that they stole like a batter
But I know they ain't so I'll paint the real picture
My vocals go solo and like a bolo I'll hit ya
Square in your face, I'll crack the ribs in your chest
'Cause you thought your off-brand jam was the best
You fessed 'cause you guessed people would be impressed
I'm gonna bust that bubble on the double
""Take a rest""


Sit back and reflect, ponder and chill out
Rhymes like daggers make blood spill out
But you can't blame me for bringin' disaster
With all these ducks claimin' that they're the masters
Only thing they mastered is how to get wacker
As I roll uphill they roll downhill faster
Now they're wondering how they lost their touch
Wanna buy my rhymes but mine cost too much
I'm the innovative one, call me the creative one
And I won't stop 'til the job is done
All the slobs just run when I come to get some
'Cause they know better than to challenge this go-getter
They get bust, you can trust 'cause I won't let a
Booty-ass rapper get wins against me?
I guarantee that I won't act friendly
'Cause crabs have a nerve and deserve to get whipped on
Their girls get kissed on while they get flipped on
I slaughter and slay or slap 'em up quick
'Cause the lyrics they kick make me seriously sick
No substance, no value, but nevertheless
They're gettin' daytime play but I still say they should ""take a rest""

"Nice Girl, Wrong Place",The Ownerz,2003.0,"You're just a nice girl, in the wrong place
Just a nice nice girl girl, in the wrong place

What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
You wanna take my chips, I wanna take you on trips
So you can help me, get my money
Go ahead, try it for me here's the story of my honey
I'm the Owner and I'll do more than bone you
Maybe help you advance, like Prince did Apollonia
You looking right I see you hooking tonight
But something about you, got me pushing up tight
Do that dance like Aphrodite cause you mighty
You might be the chick that make me trip just slightly
Ya eyes glisten, your breasts, ass and thighs is hittin
If it ain't love, then this thug is just smitten
I feel ya aura like I'm reading ya horo-
-scope, and I hope that I can see you tomorrow
Remembering your face like this, my Henney chase like this
What you doing in a place like this?

You're just a nice girl, in the wrong place
And I think I'm diggin you in a major way
You're just a nice girl, in the wrong place
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Whatcha doin in a place like this?

What's a nice girl like you doing here like this?
Busting your heels like this, I know you feel like shit
And you feel like calling the quits, but you need that dough
Paying for school, I can see that yo
You're intelligent, similar to Angelou
I'm understanding you, I got big plans for you
Your whole awaistance got you going places
You chasing money, ain't no funny faces
You're/Your shit serious, niggas is delirious
I like your little outfit, I like the way you're wearin it
You say your last man was too jealous
You're too young to settle down, girl I'll let you tell it
You're not a video chick, not a groupie bitch
Just an ambitious young woman with juicy lips
Remembering your face like this, my Henney chase like this
What you doing in a place like this

You're just a nice girl, in the wrong place
And I think I'm diggin you in a major way
You're just a nice girl, in the wrong place

Whatcha doin in a place like this?

What's a nice lady doing in place so shady?
Your innocent stare and derriere so crazy
Conversation stimulating, you witty
You got me debating on, taking you with me
I'm in the back drinking Yak, with you on my lap
Give me a dance cause, this is my track
You holdin it down for your whole fam
You wasn't happy with your last old man
Ma, you're doing things your way
You're making your own pay
Gotta have a business of your own one day
Hon it ain't nothing to it, I wanna see you do it
I'll tell you one thing, your last man blew it
A perfect blend of, beauty and brains
It's my duty to explain what you do to me and
Remembering your face like this, my Henney chase like this
What you doing in a place like this?

The Illest Brother,Daily Operation,1992.0,"Gotta be the illest brother to claim respect
It takes the illest brother just to get respect
Got to be the illest brother when it's time to get wreck
Got to be the illest brother when I get my mic check

I'm one of the illest brothers known to man
But if you don't understand, see I'm a grown man
And I stand 5'8"" and 3 quarters
Giving orders to my squadron 'cause I'm like the sergeant
Or general but let me keep this minimal
I used to hang with kids who like to live trife with a knife
Cutting kids for fun and pulling out much guns
And like riflery champs fellas start to get amped
Dead bodies lay stamped to the pavement so I gave it some thought
Remembering the brothers who are gone now
I will make a strong vow to make things right
Ignite the mic, get hype and all that
Suckers try to menace but they always fall flat
To the ground as I astound come around
I'll put you down about the brothers who think they're boss
Think they're getting large but in the end they pay the cost
Of their lives and that ain't the way to go out
Even take their boys with 'em 'cause they know their boys will go out
But when it comes to facing some time
They're like crying like weeping, wanna call mom Dukes
But mom Dukes is fed, fed up with the shit you did
She knows that you shot and she knows that you cripple kids
But who's to judge when you're trying to survive
The one who moves first might be the one to stay alive
So when you think you're hard and dominating the set
Just remember the illest brother claims respect!

Like I said I'm an ill kid, so never dare test me
They wanna arrest me 'cause I'm causing a frenzy
Fake gangsters come and fake gangsters go
Real gangsters chill 'cause real gangsters know
That quietly you stalk your prey on the down low
'cause too much talk will get you beef on the street
And brothers in the city have to live this way
It may cause dismay but I'ma tell it anyway
Yo guns are easy to get and like a puppet
Some young kid is gonna be the subject
Of internal oppression an example of hard times
'Cause to make it out the trap in your mind it's a hard climb
But even if you change and come right and exact
There's another brother scheming so just watch your back
I know a brother who thought he had it all
But little did he know he was bound for a downfall
He'd pick up the heater and go stick somebody
He wouldn't give a damn if he killed somebody
'Cause if somebody would get in the way of him getting loot
There'd be no hesitation he'd just shoot
It's like The Good, The Bad and The Ugly
Except it's reality and you don't see it on TV
Brothers keep dying in the streets 'cause the streets are designed
To keep you from having peace of mind
I know an old man, he's got a rifle to stifle
Any young punk, he hides it under his bunk
And I know a kid who's been to jail and
He told me that the system had failed him
So now he's out the joint and he's like flippin' on kids
And the people in his neighborhood are flippin' their wigs
But you gotta check the move 'cause there's a reason
A method to the madness and you know what I'm meaning
'Cause rather than being the herb, vic, or chump
You can be just like my man cold holding the pump
But living like that you take a chance with your life
But some things in life, sometimes, will make you uptight
I'm like an avalanche of knowledge pounding down all fools
All fakes, all snakes and ones who try to break the rules
And regulations stipulations made by the Gang Starr
You try to flex muscle but you know you can't hang high
You're making me vexed but yeah you can go next
Just remember the illest brother claims respect


Yo money don't front, you know you blew your chance
And now it's my turn so I'ma take command
'Cause I'm like the one who's got all the juice
I always get loose I got the balls to reduce
Your crew very easily, I got more ammo
I'm like the ill kid, the psycho man, yo
'Cause now I'm past the point and I ain't gonna return
And when it comes to your destruction I ain't really concerned
About the consequences 'cause I'm living day to day
So who are you to comment about me and my ways
I get my attitude from living and I never forget
You got to be the illest brother just to claim respect!",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-the-illest-brother-lyrics
Beyond Comprehension,Step in the Arena,1991.0,"Expanding the depth of your brainpower
Ours is a better gift, not to be bragging nor lollygagging
I can see dimensions of sound and light around my mic
Transmitting lyrics like teletype
Reacting to a beat in a whisper
And like a transistor, I'm sounding dope when I'm crisper
The shortest length between two points is a straight line
I've gotta take mine, I heard it through the grapevine
That some can't find hype lines (hype lines...)
And so I'm smothering, over my prey I am hovering
Suckers I'm shoving at the same time covering
You with the blanket of some language that's distinguished
How swift can I get? You ask and I'll tell
For I can excel real well like a gazelle
Past your head, I'm grabbin' abstract thought
Like some gain glory, while others get no part
I feel for the hurt ones, the victims of wrong deeds
Awareness is key, our people have strong needs
Science, math, history, theology
Philosophy, psychology, English and biology
Et cetera, and all of these have a purpose
But genocide makes me nervous
So many questions, many opinions to mention
And damn... this jam's beyond comprehension

Like planets in orbit, we ride the life cycle
Some take a rifle on the street 'cause it seems neat
Whatever turns you on I guess, that's why vests are in season
I'll do my show then I'm leavin'
I'd rather be blastin' dope sounds on the other side of town
Than be there when they close the place down
But anyway, everyday, there's another way
For a person to just flip, so a brother may
Simply go buckwild, get crazy and mad
I know the struggle my father had
Poetry it comes from within, and will always win
Hold captive bodies from end to end
And at a party, I'll survey then slay with the quickness
Displaying the fitness
Easing the mind and relieving the tension
And singing my own song, that's beyond comprehension",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-beyond-comprehension-lyrics

Misled by the lies that they pump in their heads
The money and the fame that they're hoping to find
Will never come close to the scope of my rhyme
Now, some have been successful but really
And yo, these MC's are clearly not nearly
Up to this level, or should I say caliber
It's just some hype that the company's selling ya
'Cause they'll take a dud talkin' crud and they'll push him
But in the next year, someone new will just squish him
'Cause when you sell out to appeal to the masses
You have to go back and enroll in some classes
So cash in your check 'cause it's the last one you get

So jet to the rear and you better just follow

Here and gone in a flash
Some made cash while other suckers go broke real fast
Some never make any money but still they act funny
Like they're thinking they're running
Things, wearing rings and medallions
Than listen to their rhymes, one would rather take Valiums
'Cause, swiftness and skills they are lacking
So I send 'em packing, they should have know not to tax in
And smashing all of their vocals to smithereens
Watching them collecting themselves is a bitter scene
But some find happiness while others find sorrow

Out the window every night, deadly intentions man
Cocked back and ready to fire, hit man for hire
And fuck politicians, nothin but liars
As I build my cream, with self esteem
But drink the water from the streams, of gangsta lean
To keep food on my plate, stick a mac to your face
So I never have to fall off, so you can never underrate
Force pressure, is the techniques of real men
So when you slam the doors, we still get in

Bust your grill with skill as we build and fulfil
I drop the wisdom to quiz them, with precision we drill
We're not the wannabe downs 'cause we're born to be down
We're moving on with the sound, see we're gonna be around
For a long time, I kick the strong rhymes
You're empty-handed and stranded
'Cause you were standing in the wrong line
This is not the fake, it's for sure, pure, authentic
The gift is hitting home on your dome because we meant it
You'll need a graffiti, don't heed and you'll be bleeding
We'll rip you, and ship you back 'cause you're impeding
The progress, and I guess that you should be told now
Lo and behold how the scroll I unfold now
Knowledge, wisdom, peace are what I'm true to
In the rear is Premier, and I'm the Guru

I sound greater because I'm head of the committee
I chill in New York City, I'm witty, so get me
To Brooklyn, so I can ill and peace no joke
You slow poke, you'll go broke, your rhymes ain't all that dope
Just take a backseat with all your wack beats
This is the one phase of my rage and onstage I slap beats
You're fool to try to steal this, I will reveal this
Like a prophet I'll drop it, Premier will start to seal
This coffin to be chewing, you soft and you'll be doing
A dance with some ants in the ground, you clowns be chewing
But you could never get with the talents we've been blessed with
So many different ways to phrase
You shouldn't mess with the Guru

So here's the verdict, 'cause all you suckers know you're booty
You're played out, you'll fade out, I doubt that you can do me
We ain't having no gabbing, when I be grabbing and jabbing
In your ear like a spear prepare your body for bagging
'Cause you've been preparing to move, you'll be certain to lose
Open your eyes up, wise up while I work with the groove
To teach your next school, who'll be the next fool?
That I can stomp down with compound nouns but like a pest
You'll come back with dumb raps, then like a tech inside
I'll take you out your misery, you ought to step aside
Your weak rap, you speak that yang so I'mma clue you

You the need for, you all to feed your
Minds and souls, so you can lead your-self
To peace, I got a real objective here
I am effective here, 'cause I select a clear
Method for all, suckers I maul, they fall and crawl
Into the pit of purgatory
I go for glory, I'm taking inventory
Countin' all the tough luck ducks while I narrate
Relate and equate, dictate and debate
My fate is to be, cold makin' history
I use sincerity, but I still bury the
Doubts and questions, of all the skeptics
I'm kickin clout and, I'll leave you vexed
It's just true, there's nothing so-so 'cause I know
Right about to spin it, I'm in it, admit it, I did it to you
'Cause this is what I'm into
So chill while I instill that we all must fulfill
The proper mission for us, and yo, this is a must

I suggest you take a rest for the words I manifest
They will scold you and mold you, while I impress upon
You the fact that, I use my tact at
Rhymin' for climbin', and chill while I attract that
Girl you're with, I got a sincere quality

Foresight to ignite, excite and delight
And you might gain from it, or feel pain from it
Because I'm ultimate, and I'm about to let off
Knowledgem wisdom, understanding
Truth with proof, so won't you throw a hand in the air
Put up a peace sign and be fine
And though we're feeling good, we should, we could, we would
Stop, think for a moment, OK?
And then sway while I convey that we must do away
With all the stress and the strife, so God bless your life
Use kindness, and never blindness
And you will find that this perspective is best, check it out

Have you jockin' while I'm talkin', but anyway

For you are being very ignorant
That's insignificant, I guess you figured and
Hoped to be, dope as me, I G, you flee
Because the pressure's too much for you
I'm your professor, I got the touch to
Do more than the rest who fess and can't compete
I'm elite, I'll defeat, delete and mistreat

The names have been changed to protect the innocent
Each step is intricate, I rep magnificent
Knew this kid named Ronnie, used to make cash with Caesar
They made a lot of money back in the 80's crack fever
Caesar was an overachiever, a kingpin and 18-and-a-half
He got knocked and left Ronnie to watch the team and the stash
Plus his crib, his jewels, his whip and his girl
And Ronnie's self-interests had him livin' in a different world
He rocked Caesar's chains, he pushed Caesar's Range
Smokin' mad wools all day, with Caesar's change
Not to mention he pushed up on Caesar's wifey
A move like that my man, extremely sheisty
It all got back to Caesar in the bing
They found Ronnie's body in the playground by the swings
Anyone can get it, for sure it don't matter dawg
Especially when a nigga tries commitin' sabotage

""There ain't nobody to trust""
""It's got me ready.. ready.. ready.. ready.. ready to bust""
""It's like sabotage, there ain't nobody to trust""
""""It's like sabotage""

I'm knowin' where the power be, I'm schemin' to get even
Dissension can occur from within one's ranks
The chain can be weakened, by just one link
Pricks be galavantin' from one crew to the next
Musical click-ass niggas catch two to the chest
My usual guess is that they choose to digress
Disillusioned by greed, causin' you to distress
Just do what's best, clean house, leave out
Them punks can't touch what they can't peep out
See I'm a raw nigga, and like my pops I'm a lawgiver
Can't throw a wrench in my game, I'm a boss figure
Take you under my wing, it don't matter God
Dead you if you try to commit, sabotage
Rise for me now, kneel for me now
Time to pass judgment, can't feel for you now
Lay in your bed, accept your fate
Try to clean it up, accept you're late
From the streets to the industry, peep the chemistry
It's GangStarr shit, makin' a livin' see
We put it on and when it's war it's war
Sabotage'll have me dumpin' the four {*gunshots richochet*}

Intro (The First Step),Hard to Earn,1994.0,"It’s about time to catch motherfuckers sleepin’
Wake the fuck up
Yo, all you kids wanna get on and shit
Just remember this, this shit ain’t easy
If you ain’t got it, you ain’t got it motherfucker
Suckas be commin’ up to me on some bullshit
Talkin’ about they wanna freestyle and shit
Breath stinkin’ like a motherfucker
Spittin’ and shit
Other motherfuckers wanna stand next to me and just hang out
I never did that shit when I went to get on
All I did was give a motherfucker a pound or compliment
And I was out. Told him my name. Peace",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-intro-the-first-step-lyrics
Jazz Music,No More Mr. Nice Guy,1989.0,"The music started in the hearts and drums from another land
Played for everyone by sons of the motherland
Sendin' out a message of peace to everybody and
Came across the oceans in chains and shame
Easing the pain, and it was without name
Until some men in New Orleans on Rampart Street
Put out the sounds, and then they gave it a beat
I'm talkin' 'bout Jelly Roll, King, and Satch
I'm talkin' 'bout the music that had no match
Yes the music, and it was born down there
We're gonna use it, so make the horn sound clear
It's jazz music, jazz music

Yo, the music that pops, and the other cats made
It stayed 'cause people love when they played
To the North, it took a riverboat shuffle
To the big cities with lots of hustle and bustle
To Chicago, and to the Apple too
This was a scene that our forefathers knew
Go get your crew, I know they'll get into
The jazz music, jazz music

The music called jazz had the razzmatazz
It had the flavor, and a lot of pizazz
The big band beat was very neat and unique
The swing was king, it made you tap your feet
There was Benny and Duke and of course the Count Basie
The melody was smooth and yes, very tasty
There was Hap, The Prez, and Lady Day and
Dizzy Bird and Miles, they were all playin'
They brought it to the people of the foreign lands
Back across the oceans and the desert sands
Where it echoes in the distant sounds of drums
And it rises with the sun on days begun
This is the music that we give tribute to
They gave it to us, that's why we give it to you
The jazz music, the jazz music",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-jazz-music-lyrics
Bring It Back Here,One of the Best Yet,2019.0,"Raps will be actin' ill
And that's exactly how I feel, shoutout to Guru

Don't base my whole life on loot, but money sure helps
I keep it tight like army boots to ensure wealth
I meet suckers every day that rhyme, they say they rhyme
Most of them corny as hell, won't get paid a dime
A lot of these punks, they all sound the same
They all sound lame, fakin' like they down with the game
Against me, they fail
I'm like the black Frankie Ale
I leave 'em slumped, and their bodies dumped over the rail
Show me respect, then cut me a fat check
You little niggas are like virgins, you haven't had ass yet
Wet behind the years while I've been spittin' darts for years
Don't make me embarrass you in front of your so-called peers
The fools gassed you in the first place, dirt face
Cocksucker, thought you had wins, got stuck in the worst place

When I met this nigga, him and Guru, right? (Mhm)
It probably— What was that, '87, '88? ('88)
'88, I was 16, 17 years old
I was gettin' money in Baltimore, I'm from the Bronx (Okay)
So I respected niggas from outta town coming to another town tryin' to get money (Aight)
Feel me? So that's what clicked me with Gang Starr
I thought Guru, God bless him, was my little man
That nigga was ten years older than me
I'm from outside (Okay)
And I thought that, you know
I come from the era where rappers wasn't really
Uh, admired the way they are now
You feel me? (Right) Them niggas was entertainers to us (Mhm)
We was fuckin' with niggas who threw stones at the penitentiary (Right)
Alright, so, when I got with Gang Starr, it was like

I'm like a one man task force here
And once again, brains on bend as I go half with Premier
Here, I give you the mic, sike
This is my stage kid, you'll feel my rage kid tonight
Who's gangsta, who's flossin, who's thuggin, who's boss man
I'm here to get respect from L.A. from Boston
My celly rings often cuz I got the goods
MC's ride the wood, any beef I got the hoods
Now come come now, what the heck were you thinkin
Feel the dum dum's now, leavin you numb while you leakin
I'm speakin, just to let you rap pro's know
Ain't no gimmicks, no phony image, cuz I'm a natural

The natural, the actual, the factual
The classical, the radical
You wanna act tough, we ain't mad at you
It's just that we are here to adjust your phony attitude
Gang Starr, we holdin it down just like a gat'll do

So natural, chicks in VIP come downstairs
Rush me in pairs, shouldn't have brought them around here
The rules say don't check the pimp, check the ho
Check the flow, I'm all up in the trap catchin the bankroll
My steel shank holds one in the chamber like Antonio
'Course I'm a stand-up guy, but you don't know me though
I'm righteous, but I might just unvail my portfolio

It's the black 
General Custer

Touch ya, cuz you had nerve to try and conjure
A way to surpass the master, but now I bombed ya

Paragraphs, portraying my viewpoint
So stay attentive, cause this is a new joint
From the G-A-N-G with the info
Lyrical elements emerge from the intro
Forming a poetic mass over pathetic trash
Other writers are outclassed
Surpassed by the words and the wit
Rhymes fit and hit cause that's how we designed it
Page for page, we are the new age
Dope in the videos and dope when we're on stage
Commanding respect with my ink pen while suckers are sinking
As I'm keeping them thinking
Narrating phrases of value, and I can see now you
Relate to what I create
From back in the days of my youth, I've looked for the truth
And yo my rhymes are the real proof
New heights and new realms have been reached
By use of my speech along with one of Premier's beats
So listen and we'll show you the best way
And then sway, as I read my S-A
(DJ Premier cuts and scratches again)

Worshipful words giving insight, so just be observant
So you can get this right
My oratory gift is abundant
, so dazzling to minds
That you should come get
A glimpse of the one who puts wimps out of work
The script is a mess and they dress like they're jerks
Beyond them, is where I'll be dwellin
The Guru will tell em, why their records ain't sellin
Placin my fingers on the tool, I runaway all fools
When I'm dispersin a verse
Think of an enjoyable moment, then boogie your body
Cause this party I own it
The origin of this is on paper
Vibes will ascend from my mind to each line
I go with the flow as I show expertise
The powers increase as my voice hits the streets
Then gripping your soul with authority
I pour these rhymes in a cup so drink up
And then I might bring another round
Watch the sound pound from the floor to the ground
And keep aware, cause we'll show you the best way

What You Want This Time?,Step in the Arena,1991.0,"Who's this? Juanita? Fatima? Solika? Oh, it's Freda?
Look, I have a question, just what is it that you need
A man, a lover, maybe someone to talk to?
Or could it be you're schemin'? Oh, not you!
Well listen, I got this phone installed for business
And who gave you our number? Seriously, what is this?
The new fad? Now you wanna kick it to a rapper
DJ or dancer? Well I don't have the
Time for no stunts, no hookers and no games
Our name and our fame is for the long way we came
The struggle, the hassle, the hustle, the fight
And you're asking me if you can see me tonight?
Don't you know the Guru's not the type to be out skeezin'
The reason is because I do believe in
Havin' the right to choose the one I want
And if I had a girl, why would I front?
You're only gonna get your feelings hurt, miss
And truthfully I really don't wanna have to diss
My music means everything to me, it's my life
So make like a camper, and go take a hike
You can't mess with my mind, and don't tie up my line
You called yesterday, so what you want this time?

Ayo Premier (Yeah?) Who's that knockin' at the door?
(Yo man, it's Vicky) Vicky? Are you sure?
The one from down the block who was actin' all hot
She stops me all the time and says she likes me a lot?
How does she know where we live, I didn't tell her
And word is bond, duke, I'm not the fella
No matter what I say this young lady's persistent
For instance, she watches me from a distance
And if I walk by and I forget to say hi
She pushes up on me and rubs me with her thigh
I told her I was taken, but she doesn't care
Ayo, do me a favor, tell her I'm not here
Forget it, I think she heard my voice already
You can let her in, but I'm tryna cook spaghetti

Hardcore Composer,Daily Operation,1992.0,"Now I got you looking stiff you numbskull, you're at a standstill
Still faking that you're hard with your rhymes and got no hand skills
So I'll easily drop you and stop you from rhyming
Send you home to moms all bruised up and crying
Then if you want you can go call your people
You're gonna need a mob against me 'cause I'm lethal
Not that I'm a violent brother, no to the contrary
My vocals carry, and then I bury
MC's in holes that they dug for themselves
Couldn't be themselves so they sold themselves
To a company exec who doesn't have respect
For real rap music, so he wants to get
An MC that starts out street to crossover
But not me, 'cause I'm the hardcore composer

You ain't a writer nor a fighter you're just a biter
I think you need to save all that because in spite of
The reputation that you think you have
The crew already knows that you're really a crab
So I'll grab the mic with haste and send you out of this place
And back to trace my flow but don't waste your time bro
It only takes a minute a second for me to switch
And rearrange real quick
'Cause I can kick plenty styles, rhymes stretch many miles
I'm the authentic yes the lyric unloader
The truth exposer, the hardcore composer

All you delirious curious suckers
You better act like you've been known I mack
And hold my own with a mic just to stagger
A bragger, retire a liar and very easily
I'm passin' by ya 'cause you didn't want to give the credit
Where it was due, yeah it was you, uh-huh it was you
And your crummy corny ass crew
So we shall enforce that you lost and plus you oughta
Find another type of life and yes another source of income
And here's some advice you can't rap this nice
I broke ya over and over I told ya
I would mold ya why?  Because I'm bound
To give original sound and as your ears pound
Bringing pleasure and pain
And brains start to gain from musical measures
Forming stanzas combining
Providing answers to mystical questions never typical inventions
Developed by my Gifted Unlimited mind
Suckers wanna talk but they mimic the rhyme, 'cause they're eager to find the secret behind
The way that I stomp all comp
Just like a Timberland it's the Guru and Premier
It's them again droppin' fly tracks
And taking things over and never selling out

About the way they slayed this one or that one

Who tried to match the panache of the Guru
Received a curse that was much worse than voodoo

To be involved with solvin all the problems
With the way that the sound has gone down
So I frown at the scene where you be takin it
And like the winds of change, I'll be breakin it up
Shakin it up, clearing it out, airing it out
And bearing the clout on my chest
Like a crest that rests on a tidal wave
Only the good I'll save when I plunge
And engulf the ones who aren't sons
Who converse with us should make friends
Yo, I recommend that you get back there
And sit back there, contemplate, calculate
And concentrate on these rhymes
That I picked to stick to your mind
And then I'll raise you straight to the next phase
'Cause I will amaze with much force
And like the power that comes from the source
Which is greater and stronger, of course
If you didn't know, I will tell you
That all the blind no-minds I give Hell to
And if you comprehend what is said
Then you'll be stayin two steps ahead

With the mic, cause I never liked fabrications
Wack creations that lack authenticity

Fiends who do would just yield
And at the foot of my bed, I have kneeled
Thus revealed as a gift I have nurtured
And I hurt ya if you're not knowin
That the musical need is now growin
And like a man obsessed, I must
Go all out, show all out, blow all out
Throw all out, get on out of my path
Cause I laugh at the ones with no gas
I surpass the class to get geesed
Like the way the ballistic's released
And I won't cease til I cap them
Or slap the saps with my rappin
Continue on with my journey
All the negative ones don't concern me
My eyes are wise, I got cause to live
Positive, have to give, every way
Every day of my life, so I fight for the right
And get hype, so heed what I feed
And get fed, then you'll be livin two steps ahead

It's me instead of you, with the lyrics you fear it
So get near it, and then you'll hear it clear
And concise, cause I paid the price to be
Talking here, rocking there, shocking here
Stop and stare, then compare if you wish
Because the others fess, I insist
So I will assist you to blend with this
Bend with this, tend with this, fend with this
As I ascend with my orals
You define and defy with high morals
And at the spot I will stop to throw darts
At the ones who proclaim with no aim
Cause they don't hold the fame, they're on mine
And since I'm well inclined and divine
I will have to ask you to come in
Move along with the tongue and the drummin
Progress and let the blessings be read
And you'll be staying two steps ahead

Played out, out of style, out of rhymes
He's out his mind

Living by the gun or by the rifle

Made away, but foolishly we go astray

Gotta Get Over (Taking Loot),Full Clip: A Decade of Gang Starr,1992.0,"Shit, it ain't go hold me back, I gotta go all out to get mine
A tech nine might come in handy for the next time
I'm frustrated, chumps are making me mad
Don't seem to understand that I'm just that bad
Too gold, too bold, too fly for them to stop
The man to respect cause I'm ripping up blocks
I gotta get the dough, gotta run the show
I'm flipping like a kilo, stash a million or so
Go for what you feel and deal wit this
Cause I'm dangerous, I come real wit this
And packing and strapping, it goes along wit the rapping
By any means necessary, you can't get buried
I may come wit a smile but I've been known to get crazy wild
So when you scheme, yo, I scheme too
And I've been out here and yes, I've seen you
I know your face, I know your name and all your people kid
I've got mad connections, so won't do a bid
I make the moves, I'm never faking
Cause the loot is for the taking
The loot is for the taking
Mad murderer stalk in the night when you walk
Feelings of stone to the bone, I'm a rock
No regrets for doing shit I had to do
I was hard headed and yea, I still am too
But you know I got things under control
So you should slow your roll that's my advice to you bro
A street veteran, sometimes I'm trife as a juvenile
I'll beep your style, you can't fuck wit the golden child
That's why you're riffing but you know you're just ass kissing
You wanna meet'cha maker, I'm a take ya
Or else let the man command
Cause I'll be ready to get you open, ain't no joking, I jam
So if you wanna know who's really boss
Then try your game, lamb, and end up taking a big loss
If I don't get my way, you're history
To you, I'm a mystery, you never understand me
I came to grab the tapes and be out
I came to get what's due to me cause I got clout
I make the moves, I'm never faking
Cause the loot is for the taking
The loot is for the taking
I'm sinister, I'm selling no wolf tickets here
Rolling correct to get my point across clear
Sights in the city make me bitter
And I ain't taking no shit from no sucker nigga
I move swift, always looking for the money to make
I need the cash flow, I got a lot at stake
And I could never go out like a crab
So shut the hell up and put the money in a big bag
Hand it over smooth like
I need fat dough, I got things to do tonight
I'm always on my job, ain't no time to be caught short
And those outta line, pay a fine or get knocked off

Here is the reason you should listen and learn
Cause quick schemes and fast living can kill ya
I know how the excitement and danger can thrill ya
But take it from somebody who knows
Cause after all the highs, you're gonna feel all the lows
This is why knowledge of self is essential
Cause if you don't have it, you may simply go mental
See, life is not a thing to be toyed wit

I'll spit on your style, shit on your crew with a smile
Fucks no, you ain't wild, we've been in your file
You fantasy ruffneck, go bluff with your tec
But you'd better show respect or blood will drip like sweat
Check yourself because now there's doo doo in your pants

Got to get the dough, got to run the show  (Repeat 4x)
""Doe in Advance"" is the name of this tune
You know what's up hops, GangStarr's in the room
Soon you'll feel the boom of masterpiece from the East
Nuff respect to where you're from, just don't act dumb
We drop the shit that's classic, you can't surpass it
We lasted, and now we run shit, you bastard
I'm like an ambush, moving on you quick
Got more depth than shallow rappers cause my game is thick
A thousand MC's in a week I subtract
Cause the market's oversaturated with scrub acts
Who wants to try next, and who wants to die next?
I'm vexed with motherfuckers, whose dome should I fly next?
Up from the alley, now the riches I acquire
Cats are coming by the wire, rhymes are chariots of fire
Call me the don, call me the man, or call me sir
But never forget this nigga knows the score
For cometition, yo there's no fucking chance
My troop is popping through clocking dough in advance
Got to get the dough, got to run the show  (Repeat 4x)",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-doe-in-advance-lyrics

'Cause, yo, the struggle is tough
And we must learn to live through it
Pleasure and pain, pain and pleasure
Gotta maintain a balance to obtain the treasure
Not really preaching or teaching but just reaching
Out to a brother or sister who is keeping the faith
And trying hard to get it straight
The time is crucial so I think we must congregate
Let's have a meeting of the minds
Before we all fall and get left far behind
Finding a way is important
Map out a plan, take a stand, you can work it
The future's all in your hands and
So of yourself, yeah, you should be demanding
We're all responsible for whatever outcome

Equations or phrases, 'cause I begun some
Exploratory digging, I'm thinking big and
I'm taking all your words, 'cause your site is blurred
And you're selfish, and rather immature
I've always felt this, that's why I'm giving more
I am sure that you find that I'm the Guru
With this particular style I'm running to you

Keen is my site, and keen is my brain
I campaign to gain my domain
And vocalizing techniques, emcees are deadbeats
And drop to the ground then, I stomp 'em down with sound
I'm a pacifist, but they won't last with this
Dope beat combined with lyrical energy
You can rewind this, play this again and see
Just how I kick the rhymes that hit ya
Snug in your mug, while I depict a
Scene that is hype and I'm title swipin'
If you're loungin' I'll take the mic and
Show you how it goes in, I'll leave you frozen

I'm crafty, so how you gonna outlast me?
With your bogus crap, you're gonna have to note this
While I rap, and then I quiz you like a teacher
Give a speech to you while I impeach the
Ones with the crowns and, my voice resounds and
Take it from me, then you will see, I got the G
The Keith double-E, I got the know-how
And I will show how the hip-hop will grow now

And slide glide to the hoop and scoop you like

Hold up I gotta flex to the stage, then engage
And do the knowledge, then backstage is where I'm headed
Don't sweat it, sit down clown and just let it be

Cause and Effect,No More Mr. Nice Guy,1989.0,"You ain't livin' right punk, I'll have to school you
Not rule you, but I'll say, yo, you fool yourself
When you try to deny and defy written laws
This means your cause has lost
Think about it, take the time, and even ponder longer
Then let your mind start to wander
Go black and track the facts about all of your mistakes
It only takes to one to make fate
Pick up your life, clean up your act, and get a legal plan
You can or be an evil man
Caught, and then you claim you're not responsible
The choice was yours, when the fun's gone you will realize
That you don't get somethin' for nothin', why you bluffin'?
Others even brothers are stuffin' their pockets
With honest cash, they'll laugh, so don't knock it
Jock it, 'cause the Guru must stop it
I'll jab you, smack you, crack -- you're demolished
You must acknowledge -- life is like a college in itself
Get a degree in reality
Or you will be upon it like a lawn you'll be walked on
Gone, never to see or be the same again
Friend, 'cause the time you spend
Bringin' down yourself, bringin' down the pace
Bringin' down your friends, bringin' down the race
Will have your life in a wreck
And homeboy life is cause and effect


Exactly what you put in boy, you will get out of it
The energy released comes back, there is no doubt of it
So when you thrive to connive and contrive foolish deeds
This means you'll bleed from greed
Dig the rhyme and dig the thought of what'll happen
You're nappin', you're gonna fall off the map 'n'
Lie out, and cry out, why? You got the short end of the stick
'Cause you ain't too quick to run tricks
Open your mind, widen your sight, get out of your rut
Move, and get the lead out of your butt
'Cause you can't live without a plan to get freshed chump
And you shouldn't stand to let
Anything sway you from the path you know is truthful
Chill, because you know the chosen youth will
Take over, and control the whole so don't blow it
Know it, 'cause the Guru must show it
I'll teach you, reachin' each so you're enlightened
Emcees are frightened, by what I write in my songs
'Cause I express what I manifest
While some of you fall down to the ground with breakdowns
Never to see or be the same again
Friend, because the time you spend
Bringin' down yourself, bringin' down the pace
Bringin' down your friends, bringin' down the race
Will have your life in a wreck
And homeboy life is cause and effect


You're still playin' games lame, I'll have to end you
Straight to the gate of fate, so you can claim your doom
Will you decay as you pay in repentance
I light my sentence like incense
Breathe in, expel your fears as you marvel
Heed what I feed, you won't starve, you'll make it
But if you don't, you will be finished
You'll dissapear, you will diminish
Never to see or be the same again
Friend, because the time you spend
Bringin' down yourself, bringin' down the pace
Bringin' down your friends, bringin' down the race
Will leave you bugged and upset
'Cause homeboy life is cause and effect
Cause and effect!

Much Too Much (Mack a Mil),Daily Operation,1992.0,"Other MCs in the place know I'm much too much
And I'll bust 'em all up without even cussing
All wannabe's are never ever gonna be nothin'
Gang Starr's in the house and we're crushing
So suckers better be up on their P's and Q's and
Competition come against me and you're losing
I'll use a simple style just to catch you snoozing
Wake up wake up kid read the news and
Take heed 'cause you need to see how battles are won
When a real man displays how it must be done
And I snuff bum MCs and keep the cashflow comin'
And never had no problems getting women
I'm like a catalyst causin' a chain reaction
Dopest vocalist and now the main attraction
Things turn gold at my slightest touch
That's why the people say that I'm much too much

I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much

Check the G-U-R-U, yes, the brother who's progressing
If beats are cake I'm frosting, if salad I'm dressing
Never stressing or guessing or messing around man
Just turn up the system so the beat can be pounding
Blasting out your radio my vocals surrounding
Take a trip uptown and come back down and
Kick it with the fellas I call my crew so
I'm gettin' kinda fat like a big huge sumo
I figure that I'm due and it's true 'cause you know
A rapper this nice oughta clock mad dough
Not the stuff from the baker but the loot yo the paper
I set up shop and drop gems and catch 'em later
'Cause I'm like keeping it moving, improving steadily
Pumping kinda loud in your Blazer or Cherokee
Doesn't matter what you drive, automatic or clutch
Just pop in my tape 'cause I'm much too much

I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
Yeah, I'm much too much
I'm much too much
'Cause I'm much too much
I'm much too much

I walk in the room unload a boom that's like sonic
My slick voice to the beat is symphonic
To a biting MC my lines are toxic and chronic
My mystical style is like harmonic
I've rarely had a difficulty slaying MCs
'Cause the ones who were toughest still begged on their knees
And I wreck the set with the greatest of ease
And you know I'm swift like the breeze
I'll never understand why a wack rapper tries and
Convinces himself that his image is so fly and
That's the type of crap you know I'm ain't buying
Chumps lack the beats and their rhymes don't apply and
That's why I've come into your life today
Just to make you sweat in my unique way
I'm controlling all action dissing MC ducks
That's why everybody knows that I'm much too much

I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much

Your mother: she's crying, your dad's upset, and
You keep denying; you don't know yet
That the things that you do affect them, too
And you're much too selfish, you know that is true
You're impressing your friends cause you thought it was cool
You robbed an old lady in the back of the school
To be down with the rest, you want it so much
But someone killed the lady, now you're in a clutch
Situation, explanation, too much making the (?)

He enjoyed the high but he wasn't for real

He could never leave the white brother alone
He lost a lot of money because of abuse
His wife tried to help him but it was no use
So she got scared, planned to move away
He pulled the knife and told that she must stay
She grabbed the kid and ran to a friend's next door
And he went back in town to get high some more
He kept blowing dough 'till there was none left
His life was the high that he thought was def
Now he has to go in for therapy
Now he has no wife and no baby
You see, the mother took the kid to carry on alone
Without any father, no man, no home
Yeah, they do okay, but one thing is true

They reject others without losing their cause

I'll take you out while I talk about some ugly
Things taking place, within the rap race
I'm well aware, so is Premier, I got a taste
Of the bitterness, cause I'm the Guru I'm not with the rest of
Those who rose by scandalous means
I'll intervene and you can't handle the scene
Cause you're bugged, by all the drugs and payola
The gameplan, I will smartly take over
I'm bolder, I'm wiser, I got the eyes to
Observe all the MC's perping a move
And after the circus, I'm certain to prove
That a man, traveling with wisdom book in hand
Will stand, longer than any king of merely one land
And after the war is sort and peace
The Gang will be the dealers of the dope beats
Always, in hallways we're lurking
Working, like an army of surgeons
To cut up your butt up, so what up you can't team
Shake and don't mistake, the mystical chance and
Glance, at the brothers with the stunned look
And at the stake is where we're gonna burn crooks
When though they bite but can't fight the mighties
Prepare your head for flight, say ""Goodnighty""
Most likely, I be saying the truth
Cause Gang Starr means ""funky"" and here is the proof

They're tight, a brother's like the wack type
Who underrate the record but check it a second
If the G the U the R the U is somebody new

I wouldn't try to do what I would die to do
I'm not despising you, but use your eyes just to see
Envision how it'll be
Cause now it'll be me, on a rhyme spree
Going far, large, wide, so let us take a ride
Inside, of transcendentalism
I'm on a mission, you're in a mental prison
Getting nuff respect and more selective and effective
So respect this, I insist you be swift and catch the movement
As I shoo the tenderonies, don't be phony
Take some time to spend to know me
Cause I'm complex, decking MC's while I quiz them
The real deal I reveal so feel the wisdom
And strength, cause I can go the whole length
Just like a preacher preaching the truth
Gang Starr means ""funky"" and here is the proof
*DJ Premier in deep concentration once again*
This beat is thumping, and I'm a keep you jumping
I'll pull your card, I'm hitting harder put the chumps
In a daze, like a maze they can't get out of
And as they try they can't deny I got the clout of
The Bossman, and in a battle you'll be tossed and
Turned, to learn more gracious ways
You must behave, or I'm a take this phrase like an icepick
And I might pick you off
You're soft, let's see how quick you frost
In a meat freezer, we'll seize you then sqeeze ya
Head to get rid of the lies you believe
And after this process your eyes will recieve
The glowing light, brighter than any ever in your sight
So hype, that you will gain the sense to wanna act right
In spite, of all your faults before
The Gang, will be the ones to make you seek your
Knowledge, it all is a blessing
Addressing, things about which you're guessing
So hear it, get near it, compare it to others
Think and take a drink, I'm a lyrical brother
I'd love ya, to be all you can be
If you're a man, you should be manly
Not sissy-like, and not so decietful
Because the Gang may hang you or keep you
As prisoners, for not believing the truth

Like seven hoodlums in a jeep, I creep up on ya
Brooklyn to California, I embalm phony performers
'Cause they're actors like Leonardo DiCaprio
Don't make me wanna put down this mic, walk up, slap you, yo
And tap you, yo, and take you out of your misery
Don't ever front or go for these bitches, thinkin' you dissin' me

New York niggas, universal, unique
And ain't nothin' sweet, in these streets we gotta eat
New York niggas, every borough is thorough
Makin' moves today and once again, son, tomorrow
New York niggas, universal, unique
And ain't nothin' sweet, in these streets we gotta eat
New York niggas, goin' out for the loot
And most won't hesitate to cock and shoot

Yo, yo, I cut deeper, you're much weaker, I crush speakers
See 'nuff heaters, yeah, in New Yitty
That's where it's grimy and gritty, word to Frank Nitti
Got strippers showin' their titties, bourgeois hoes actin' saditty
And very spot got its own ghetto
Liquor stores on all the corners, plus drugs, guns with ammo
No examples set for thugs in the projects
Only examples they get is how to unload the Tec
Out for respect, props and doe to collect
The root of it all, ya'll, is you need loot to boil
If my back's against the wall, yo, I'ma bang you until you fall, yo
Slang, slash, a buck 50, niggas is shifty
Gonna have to send more of your goons out to get me
How could you compare this here with that weak shit there?
Word to my man Sincere, we'll make you travel in fear
Like apparitions, I appear and disappear
New York in the house, so suckas play the fuckin' rear


Pay attention or get placed on suspension
Situations you gon' face beyond your comprehension
You'll be like, ""Why is all these niggas after me?""
Way up shits creek (Ha!), that's where your ass will be
Actually, you brought this shit all on yourself
Now, niggas is schemin' all on your wealth
Future health is in danger simply 'cause anger
Got niggas lookin' to hang ya or straight rearrange ya
You better hold your head, your better hide your bread
'Cause these niggas ain't playin', they're leavin' all victims dead
They labeled you as their next target
See, you was frontin', actin' like you was the hardest
Regardless, you know them niggas is hungry, yo
And ain't shit funny, yo, they want respect and money, yo

New York City in the house",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-new-york-niggaz-lyrics

It was fucked up when we was commin’ up
But it’s mad crazy for the babies right now
And it’s like, yo, you got, pssh man, mass confusion
You got motherfuckin’ rats in a maze and shit

Word is life man. But um
All I gotta do is have the mentality to fight mentality, man
Fuck tryin’, man. Because, boom

On some, on some serious shit

Code of the Streets (Radio Version),Code of the Streets,UnKnown,"Take this for example young brothers want rep
Cause in the life they're living you can't half step
It starts with the young ones doing crime for fun
And if you ain't down you'll get played out son
So let's get a car you know a fly whip
Get a dent pull a screwdriver and be off quick
With a dope ride yeah and a rowdy crew
We can bag us a Benz and an Audi too
Even a jeep or a van goddamn we're getting ours, yo
Take a trip up the strip, and be like stars so
It doesn't matter if the cops be scoping
They can't do jack, that's why a young brother's open
To do anything, anywhere, anyplace
Buckwild in another court case
It's the code of the streets
They might say we're a menace to society
But at the same time I say ""Why is it me?""
Am I the target, for destruction?
What about the system, and total corruption?
I can't work at no fast-food joint
I got some talent, so don't you get my point?
I'll organize some brothers and get some crazy loot
Selling D-R-U-G-S and clocking dollars, troop
Cause the phat dough, yo, that suits me fine
I gotta have it so I can leave behind
The mad poverty, never having always needing
If a sucker steps up, then I leave him bleeding
I gotta get mine, I can't take no shorts
And while I'm selling, here's a flash report
Organized crime, they get theirs on the down low
Here's the ticket, wanna bet on a horse show?
You gotta be a pro, do what you know
When you're dealing with the code of the streets
Nine times out of ten I win, with the skills I be weilding
Got the tec one dealing, let me express my feelings
Guru has never been one to play a big shot
It's just the styles I got that keep my mic hot
Anf fuck turning my back to the street scene
It gives me energy, so Imma keep fiends
Coming, just to get what I'm selling
Maybe criminal or felon dropping gems on your melon
So keep abreast to the GangStarr conquest
Underground ruffnecks, pounds of respect
I've never been afraid to let loose my speech
My brothers know I kick the code of the streets",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-code-of-the-streets-radio-version-lyrics
Much Too Much,Daily Operation,1992.0,"Other MCs in the place know I'm much too much
And I'll bust 'em all up without even cussing
All wannabe's are never ever gonna be nothin'
Gang Starr's in the house and we're crushing
So suckers better be up on their P's and Q's and
Competition come against me and you're losing
I'll use a simple style just to catch you snoozing
Wake up wake up kid read the news and
Take heed 'cause you need to see how battles are won
When a real man displays how it must be done
And I snuff bum MCs and keep the cash flow comin'
And never had no problems getting women
I'm like a catalyst causin' a chain reaction
Dopest vocalist and now the main attraction
Things turn gold at my slightest touch
That's why the people say that I'm much too much

I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much

Check the G-U-R-U, yes, the brother who's progressing
If beats are cake I'm frosting, if salad I'm dressing
Never stressing or guessing or messing around man
Just turn up the system so the beat can be pounding
Blasting out your radio my vocals surrounding
Take a trip uptown and come back down and
Kick it with the fellas I call my crew so
I'm gettin' kinda fat like a big huge sumo
I figure that I'm due and it's true 'cause you know
A rapper this nice oughta clock mad dough
Not the stuff from the baker but the loot yo the paper
I set up shop and drop gems and catch 'em later
'Cause I'm like keeping it moving, improving steadily
Pumping kinda loud in your Blazer or Cherokee
Doesn't matter what you drive, automatic or clutch
Just pop in my tape 'cause I'm much too much

I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
Yeah, I'm much too much
I'm much too much
'Cause I'm much too much
I'm much too much

I walk in the room unload a boom that's like sonic
My slick voice to the beat is symphonic
To a biting MC my lines are toxic and chronic
My mystical style is like harmonic
I've rarely had a difficulty slaying MCs
'Cause the ones who were toughest still begged on their knees
And I wreck the set with the greatest of ease
And you know I'm swift like the breeze
I'll never understand why a wack rapper tries and
Convinces himself that his image is so fly and
That's the type of crap you know I'm ain't buying
Chumps lack the beats and their rhymes don't apply and
That's why I've come into your life today
Just to make you sweat in my unique way
I'm controlling all action dissing MC ducks
That's why everybody knows that I'm much too much

I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
'Cause I'm much too much

""A special guest"" ""It's the militia... It's the militia""

This is a conquest, so I suggest you take a rest
Or keep a breath, but definitely keep a vest on that chest
Rymes I'm packin, just like a thug at a car-jackin'
Shoot off your hat when I start cappin, this is no actin
G-A-N-G, S-T-A double R
And you don't want no trouble up in here, baby pa
From the late-night drama, of the New York streets
To the hoods of LA, real niggas likin Primo's beats
Put suckers on glass, send em, back to class
And kick hot shit, so we can stack the Johnny Cash
I brought the God, Rakim, lyrically gunning you wanna dash?
I got Dub C, from South C, what you doubt me?
Travellin through warzones with my infrared microphone
In the year One Mill, destroying, enemies chromozones
Words burn through flesh, leavin nothing but skeletal
You best pay resepect to the legends, boy I'm tellin you, Militia

Makin a move, makin a move, who's that nigga thats makin a move?
It's the Shadiest rhymin'-back, actin' a motherfucking fool
Four-four packers, my jackets ?hittin the tag? saggin, baggin
Foot on my rag, mess up a bag, leavin my enemies in bodybags
You niggas was crackin, what y'all thought it wasn't gon' happen?
Dub C and my East Coast sisters gettin together rappin
Gun-clappin, chump smackin, kiss the ring of your highness
Look while I'm in New York City
Walkin with two of the Brooklyn's finest
My two affiliates from the East we all bang
But if y'all don't mind, this is still Westside Connec' Gang
Dress-code the same, just new pieces on my neck
East Coast brownies, house shoes, and hair nets
Y'all can't see this, so peep the sister G is pushin a Six
As I freak this, caviar GangStarr Militia remix
It's Dub C the jankiest loc', I'm runnin this here
With the Guru and New York's hardest, DJ Premier, Militia


Yo, it's The Master, mister, Musical Massacre
Passion for disaster, paragraph ambassador
R get the red carpet, just call me on
Corner the market like the mic's last name was Corleone
The facade killer, come through your city like Godzilla
Think of the sickest thing you ever seen, Ra's iller
My vision's vicious, suspect suspicious
Plans is ambitious, my motive's malicious
No interferin, if you ain't down, you got to swearin
And these cats they ain't carin, habitat awarin
Crack appearin, from out the track that I'm hearin
It's either that, or I'm going back to racketeering
Yo, you should see me, I got a crew like Mussolini
But Kool as Moe Dee, my flow be, smooth and easy
For turnin ?area centers? to wilers, you get the picture?

Gotta Get Over,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Shit, it ain't go hold me back, I gotta go all out to get mine
A tech nine might come in handy for the next time
I'm frustrated, chumps are making me mad
Don't seem to understand that I'm just that bad
Too gold, too bold, too fly for them to stop
The man to respect 'cause I'm ripping up blocks
I gotta get the dough, gotta run the show
I'm flipping like a kilo, stash a million or so
Go for what you feel and deal wit this
'Cause I'm dangerous, I come real wit this
And packing and strapping, it goes along wit the rapping
By any means necessary, you can't get buried
I may come wit a smile but I've been known to get crazy wild
So when you scheme, yo, I scheme too
And I've been out here and yes, I've seen you
I know your face, I know your name and all your people kid
I've got mad connections, so won't do a bid
I make the moves, I'm never faking
'Cause the loot is for the taking
The loot is for the taking
Mad murderer stalk in the night when you walk
Feelings of stone to the bone, I'm a rock
No regrets for doing shit I had to do
I was hard headed and yea, I still am too
But you know I got things under control
So you should slow your roll that's my advice to you bro
A street veteran, sometimes I'm trife as a juvenile
I'll beep your style, you can't fuck wit the golden child
That's why you're riffing but you know you're just ass kissing
You wanna meet'cha maker, I'm a take ya
Or else let the man command
'Cause I'll be ready to get you open, ain't no joking, I jam
So if you wanna know who's really boss
Then try your game, lamb, and end up taking a big loss
If I don't get my way, you're history
To you, I'm a mystery, you never understand me
I came to grab the tapes and be out
I came to get what's due to me 'cause I got clout
I make the moves, I'm never faking
'Cause the loot is for the taking
The loot is for the taking
I'm sinister, I'm selling no wolf tickets here
Rolling correct to get my point across clear
Sights in the city make me bitter
And I ain't taking no shit from no sucker nigga
I move swift, always looking for the money to make
I need the cash flow, I got a lot at stake
And I could never go out like a crab
So shut the hell up and put the money in a big bag
Hand it over smooth like
I need fat dough, I got things to do tonight
I'm always on my job, ain't no time to be caught short
And those outta line, pay a fine or get knocked off
It's my turn to clock the duckets
Being broke, nah, I can't fuck wit it
I'm making moves, never faking
'Cause the loot is for the taking
The loot is for the taking",https://genius.com/Gang-starr-gotta-get-over-lyrics

""rappresenta!""

Uno dei più importanti e il più pulito
E sono ancora diabolico quando lo faccio
L'ho fatto per eoni, gli straccioni farebbero meglio a capirlo
Visione eccellente, abilità da rapper fuori dal comune
Sto per fare qualche dead president attirando milioni di donne;
I soldi, sai, fanno comportare la gente in modo divertente, yo
Appena qualche negro si mette in luce, diventa un coglione, yo
Prodotti e pupazzi e pedoni, vengono usati
Quando un negro vero fa un passo avanti, viene rispettato
Effetto maggiore nel settore, sono il correttore
Vivo e diretto, oscillo il mic come uno scettro
Supremo esaltato (nel senso passivo della parola, ndr) , leader universale
Discendente di re e regine, il supervisore
Il grande signore, il meglio del meglio, la crème de la crème
Ho speso anni a costruire coi miei gatti nelle strade, loro sono i miei uomini
Ancora una volta Gang Starr ce l'ha fatta;
Ricordi i troppi gioielli dei giorni passati? Dovresti rispolverarli
Checka, il terreno è caldo sotto i nsotri piedi
E allora ascoltiamo nuovi beat per tenere il cypher completo
Se voi ragazzini state nel quartiere tutto il giorno
O state fumando marijuana in un corridoio oscuro
O se siete a scuola, o in biblioteca
Ovunque sei, ragazzo, renditi conto che la tua essenza
È divina, figliolo, e falla splendere, figliolo
E noi rifiniamo, figliolo, ayo, questa merda ti colpirà la mente figliolo
Noi siamo regalità
(Rit)

Ovunque io vada
Qualunque cosa scelga, scelgo io di farla
Devo stare fuori da tutto il resto
Qualunque cosa faccia, ovunque io vada
Voglio portare nient'altro che il meglio
Qualunque cosa scelga, scelgo io di farla
Devo solo stare fuori da tutto il resto

E tutte le ragazze vogliono spogliarmi
I miei tesori mi ungono con olio, amico
Dopo il lavoro mi fa le feste e mi tratta come un re
Lavora con me, si dona a me, al mio fianco
Non mi ama per l'erba, la mia fama o la mia auto
Un sacco di donne, là fuori, sembrano adorabili
Ma non hanno controllo sulla loro vita, dentro sono brutte
Bella a Bugsy, e a Red Alert
Sway & Tech, e Funkmaster Flex per farti muovere la testa
Le donne impazziscono quando ci vedono nel posto
K-Ci, JoJo e Preemo per arrampicarsi fino in cima...
E a tutti gli innamorati là fuori che rompono cuori
Mentre noi prendiamo parte a questa arte dell'hip hop:
Ascoltate, il modo migliore non sempre è quello veloce
E già, il modo migliore non sempre è fare i bastardi
Ti aprirò sempre la porta per farti passare
Tesoro, perchè tu sei regalità
