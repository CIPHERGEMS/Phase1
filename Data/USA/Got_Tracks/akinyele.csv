Put It In Your Mouth,Aktapuss,1996,"My baby left me
Left me sad and blue
I didn't know what to do...
Without my baby baby baby baby
And then I met his best friend
And he took me to his house
And I said... I said...
(what you said baby)
Here let me tell you what I said

Put it in my mouth
(She said put it in her mouth)
I said my motherfuckin' mouth
(I mean her motherfuckin' mouth)
Put it in my mouth
(She said put it in her mouth)
My motherfuckin mouth
(I mean her motherfuckin' mouth)
Put it in my mouth
(She said put it in her mouth)
My motherfuckin' mouth
(I mean her motherfuckin' mouth)

You wanna go down, why not?
I be like Herbie and Hand-you-a-Cock
And tell you that my name is Ak'
Get on your knees, make like the breeze begin to blow
But don't give me no Ralph Lauren grin
 
if you're not down to go low (deep in my mouth)
I'm all about mouth-fuckin
Only if you down for dick suckin
If not, B.J. and the Bear...keep truckin
And fuck chapsticks
I'm comin ashy as hell, wit chapped dicks
For your chapped ass lips (down in my mouth)
Creamin your teeth like dentists as I'm rubbin them
With an erection like injections, fuck it I be druggin them
Numbing up your tonsils, like Anbesol anesthetic
Cummin down your throat like chloraseptic (take it out my mouth)
No time for apologin.. girlfriend if you..
Swallowin', garglin'
I'm givin' bitches permanent beards
Put your lips here and catch these damn facial hairs
In your mouth

Put it in my mouth
(Put it in your mouth)
I said my motherfuckin' mouth
(I said your motherfuckin' mouth)
And you can just eat me out
(Or I can just eat you out)
You can eat me out
(Yeah, what's that all about)

Well, you can lick it, you can sip it, you can taste it
I'm talkin' every drip-drop, don't you waste it
Baby, slurp it up, it's enough to fill your cup
It's finger-lickin' good
, and I wish a nigga would
Go down kinda slow or even fast
I'm always sprung once I feel your tongue in the crack of my ass
Just eatin' me - nigga
Goin out like that boy you pack such a tasty treat
And you can eat me out

But put it in your mouth
(Put it in your mouth)
I said your motherfuckin' mouth
(I said your motherfuckin' mouth)
And you could just eat me out
You can eat me out

What do ya choose to lick
Pussy or dicks?
People throughout the world
Man it's your pick
What do ya choose to lick
Pussy or dicks?
People throughout the world
Yeah, it's your pick
What do you wanna lick
Pussy or dicks?
People throughout the world
It's your pick

Put it in your mouth
I said your motherfuckin' mouth
Put it in my mouth
Put it in my mouth
Put it in my mouth
I said my motherfuckin' mouth
Just put it in my mouth
My motherfuckin' mouth
And you can just eat me out
In my mouth, put it in my mouth
Baby baby in my mouth
Let me go down

Pussy Makes the World Go Round,Aktapuss,1996,"(Akinyele) (2x)
It's just a typical Akinyele song (2x)
About love

Pussy it makes the world go round (2x)
You could have a son or a daughter if you fuck me down
Cause pussy makes the world go round

Pussy makes the world go
Pussy makes the world go round round

Ha ha
I know mad guys
Who in love with their wives
Call them pussy cats
Cause they survive getting stabbed
With about 9 lives
For all 9 wives
Went with 5 guys
Lying between your thighs
You realize
This motherfucker siamese
Squinting his when he talk as if he was Chinese
But then he started purring like the Guyanese
Until one day niggas around the way dissed his main squeeze
She came upstairs bitching
Who listen
Niggas infront there feeling was straight dissing
Throwing hints when I'm walking by blowing kisses
He was like what shit skip the ripping
Get the smith and weesun
Add the clip in
When I said started spitting
Even hitting
Motherfuckers who was down with him
Blood everywhere
Until the gay niggas on his team still compare
In the vaseline
Cause they put them in and dissapear
Yo buck buck buck
Pull his dirty ass up
Then seeing the police
Sir-reens flashed up
The adrenaline make them surrender start bagging them up
Bloody vision
Living in prison started grabbing his nuts
Told the cops it's his dick that hey all could suck
He started backing them up
Waving his gat
Like he clapping them up
That's when to g's
Came from behind trees
And robbed that
Instead he loaded and cocked back
He said fuck that
Turn his hat from his front to his back
Laid his index
Like windex and squeezed on the gat
Immediately he started stumbling back
Cause the SWAT team repeatedly laid his ass flat
As he laid on his back
Girl rushed to his side picked him up off the floor put him on her lap
Got blood on her dress
]From the open flesh
Of the bullet wounds left in his chest
Cardiac arrest
She said uh uh don't go
What about little Kada
As she stretched him out on the tar
Tried to give him mouth to mouth CPR
But he just lay there stiff
She grabbed his hand
And placed it about her heart on top of her breast
With blood this is for the love of her sex
This is all for the love of her sex(4x)",https://genius.com/Akinyele-pussy-makes-the-world-go-round-lyrics
Butt Naked,Aktapuss,1996,"(I got a lady that's with me
From Astoria Projects
Y'all must be crazy)

Alright, fuck it, I'm ready
Come on
(Come on)
Looking back in time
Through the corners of my mind
I see you standing there
(Standing theeere...)
Baby, how much I miss you
How much I want to kiss you
Run my fingers through your hair
(Yeah, yeeeah...)

Let's get butt naked and fuck
(What the hell y'all wanna do?)
Forget the party
Let's have a orgee
(What the hell y'all wanna do?) (2x)

I fiend to hear the fly lady singin my shit
My dream's like Martin Luther to be the King of this shit
Makin g's and parlay, plus goin on vacations
Overseas, like them dudes who play for the CBA
You can catch I, on the streets of N.Y
On some caterpillar shit, dressin butter, lookin fly
Money bulgin out my pocket, cause it just can't fit
Movin like outfielders, cause I'm carryin knits
Even with suits on, or boots on
Gees give me the pee for free like a Luke song
Akafella drop dead, holdin dough up in my paws
While y'all make a little bit of bread like croutons
It's on
Let's get butt naked and fuck
(What the hell y'all wanna do?)
Yo, forget the party
Let's have a orgee
(What the hell y'all wanna do?)
All the ladies sing along, sing

We don't have to get butt naked
(Just take it off, just take it off)
But if you wake it, I'mma let you taste it
(Just take it off, just take it off)
We'll never have to get butt naked
(Just take it off, just take it off)
But if you wake it, I'mma let you taste it
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?

As I combine all of my love in you girls
Heel up, wheel up, 
gobble my nuts like squirrels
Powerful impact - boom! - in the pussy
Grabbin, screamin, she starts to push me
But I just kept on lovin
All in a sudden I started comin
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!
This girl was hairy like that man Sasqwash
Ugh-ugh-ugh, that's all that we said
Man, ugh, pardon me, ugh - back on the bed
As I turned her over, I said ""I beg your pardon""
Tried to stick in in her butt, the girl kept on fartin
Pfrr-pf-pf-pfrr - like the human beatbox
Pumpin that ass up just like Reebocks
As I turned her over, I said ""I beg your pardon""
Try to put it in her mouth, but the girl kept on maulin
Rrraw, rrraw, like Captain Caveman
My dick on her breast, and her chest just caved in
Let's get butt naked and fuck
(What the hell y'all wanna do?)
Yo, forget the party
Let's have a orgee
(What the hell y'all wanna do?)

We don't have to get butt naked
(Just take it off, just take it off)
But if you wake it, I'mma let you taste it
(Just take it off, just take it off)
We'll never have to get butt naked
(Just take it off, just take it off)
But if you wake it, I'mma let you taste it

Look at the pillow and bow down
Keep your feet flat on the ground

Giving you multiple or-gas-ums
Pass me some

Who Ak?

Yeah, he came to London
I took him around and shit
He was nice
I was gonna fuck him, yeah I really was gonna fuck him
But I didn't
I went to fuck him though
I was gonna give him some of this pussy but he started talking some of this
Wild shit
He said...

Oh yes you will...Be lickin my dick toniiiite
:Oh no I motherfucking won't

I was layin in tha bed like 'gimme some head'
She said:'when it come to dat Ak, I'm on you dead'
'I don't suck dills'
I was lookin at that chick like 'bitch ill'
What the fuck's the deal
Do you really feel if you don't begin to kneel you have sex appeal
Well I feel:
Oh yes you will...be lickin my dick toniiiite

My zipper went zip
I put my pants to my hips
She put her thumbs up like the father said ---
I was like 'shit, i dislike her'
She got her thumbs in the air like a hitch hiker
Ready to fight her
But instead I chill
I looked her in tha grill and said
Oh yes you will...be lickin my dick toniiiite 
Oh no I motherfucking won't

Ha, yo
I picked my ?condesending? booker
I put my nuts by your chin so when you look up
I'll be on top of you doin Bobby Brown push-ups
When you give me head lift your toosh up
When I said what I said 'you should have seen when her whole face pushed up'
She said 'huh,what,ill'
Oh yes you will...be lickin my dick toniiiite

No I won't 
Yes I don't 
No I won't 
Yes I don't 
Oh yes you will...be lickin my dick toniiiite


I no I motherfucking won't

You would swear that she want it from the way she kiss my stomach 
I couldn't wait to start cummin from it
Imagine if she doin it like she gettin blunted
You know, French kissin, puttin her tongue on it
And then she stopped
And I was like 'doggone it'
Stop actin scared like my house haunted
Oh yes you will...be lickin my dick toniiiite

I said 'boo, do me and I do you'
She said 'OK, go first, then I do you'
Well I do

And you do

 If this is true 
Oh yes you will...be lickin my dick toniiiite
Oh no I motherfucking won't
Lickin a dick or lickin a clit
If we do it together, we on some 69 shit
Lickin a dick or lickin a clit
I know mad chicks who ACT like they don't lick DICK
Lickin a dick or lickin a clit 
If I had to pick
Oh yes you will...be lickin my dick toniiiite
No I won't 
Yes I don't

We used to conversate and shit
For a little bit
You told me about the guys you hit
You said I probably lied about the girls
In the world that I said I done hit
But I let it pass
With a simple laugh
Cause it was the beginning
So I stay smiling and grinning
Even when you joke and said my wrinkled sweater reminded you of
Fucking crushed linen (yo, your shirt is wrinkled like crushed linen Ha ha)
Anyway, ha ha ha ha ha
Hard to find that funny
So I said yo bitch would you fuck me for money
Na na na I ain't said that I ain't said that chill chill
This is what I said
Hey listen yo
Every time I try to set it off
You be like no
Quick and call the kid up every time you broke
Talking about some nigga played you out
Slapped you in your mouth
And if I see him you want me to react like pulling on
Risking mafia as I watch some kid's blood spill
Why you run around town talking about (yo nigga I get you killed)
Girl don't get me wrong
I'm not no duck and shit
Before I make moves like I got to at least fuck and shit
Bust a nut and shit
In your gut and shit
Fuck you down
Turn you around

Coochie,Aktapuss,1996,"Chorus (4x)
My coochie is soo juuicy, yeah
This right here is for all the girls
Who I used to talk to who didn't amount to be shit in life
You know what im sayin? All the girls who used to call
Their man on me when I was in front of the building
Just tryin' to get their numbers
Try'na put my seed up in 'em, you know..
All the girls who gave me a wrong number
When I just asked them for their fuckin' phone number
Tryin' to call 'em and hook up for a date and all that shit...
All the girls who left me in restaurants eatin'...
Talkin 'bout they gonna use the phone
And left me with the fuckin bill....
HA! It was all a dream, I used to read Playboy magazine
Niggas gettin' their dick licked with whipped cream
Women from all places, no matter what their race is
Mami wanna put punani where your face is
I said ""Ha, Whut?"" Put my face by her trap
Smoke weed, bamboo, lick her in her private spot
Way back before niggas even started smokin' crack
They used to act, proooo black
Remember Brand Nubian, 'One for all'?
Who ever thought Akinyele would get paid for grabbin' his balls
Now I'm in the strip bar, big rap star
Time to get laid, which one of y'all girls wanna get paid?
The lieu..tenant, sit behind windows tinted
Remember when I used to push cars that was rented
Now I cop the drop top, made thier hearts stop
Drive another block , they be like ""yo, that was Ak!""
Huah! I stay away from the A-I-D
Pack condoms like guns cuz thats the way I be
One love to the late great Eazy-E
Larry Flynt, Hugh Heffner, and Ron Jeremy
Huah! I get pussy you know how I do
Call the crib last four numbers, ten-eighty-two
What the fuck??
My coochie is soo juuiicy, yeah (4x)
I can take the girl from the local streets
And take her to Cancun and fuck her on the beach
And Im far from cheap, I make sure all my niggas get laid
Open your legs girl, make some way, Hey-ay!
Around the way they used to diss me, girls never kiss me
Now they writing letters how they miss me
I never thought that hard work could pay off and shit
I was too used to jerkin' off and shit
Now the hunnies play me close, like the butter play the toast
When I'm grabbin 'em, I'll be baggin' them like a Coach
Condos in Queens, head blown for weeks
Feelin' up the cheeks of the 'put it in ya mouth' freaks
Raw sex is what I fear, so I pack condoms when it comes to this here
I hump bitch! A bunch of bitchs grabbed the family jewels
Considered a fool cuz I get more ass than a mule
Stereotype of a perverted nigga misunderstood....and its still all good
Chorus (9x)
Yea this for all the girls when I used to call they house
They see my number on the caller ID
And they never pick up the phone..fuck you...
This for all the girls when I call 'em
They answer their phone like ""Hello"" and when I say
""Its Ak"" they act like their fuckin 'sleep..
Yeah fuck you...
This is dedicated to the Notorious B.I.G

How Do You Feel,Aktapuss,1996,"Hook - (Christine McLean)
How do you feel now taht you know you cheated on me
Was she as good goody goody good as can be
How do you feel knowing that I know
And how do you feel cause I'm out the door
And how do you feel knowing that I cheated on you to
(Christine McLean)
And did she get you open with a 69
Doggystyle that's from the back and from behind
Now did she do you well
Did she go down low
Did she take it fast or did she take it slow
See my guy he did me and he did me well
He kissed my lips
He touched my tits and then my panties fell
With some cherry jello and the cool whip cream
I feel man dick go up inside of me
Hook
(Christine McLean)
Now did she get you open with a second round
On the bed the chair or maybe on the ground
Was it as good as good as you though it'd be
Did the skinny amateur even compare to me
When my guy got finished with his love and flow
He showed me many many things that you didn't know
And by the time we reached found 44
It took his time laid me down and we made love some more
Hook
(Akinyele)
Ha now I didn't even mean to cheat on your pussy
I found another lady who said she'd fuck me for free
And I didn't even like have to eat her out
The first thing she put this dick up in her mouth
Now I'm not saying that I was loving the chick
I was a little astonished from the way she ws sucking the dick
Do get me wrong later on I'll probably be fucking the chick
Get on some Donald shit
Then start ducking the chick
Now the motherfucking moral of the story is
You cheat on me I'll cheat on you that's just how it is
My new sweetie she know I don't come speedy
Before she give me long head like Nefertiti
Now what we do with me and you don't go tell he or she
Keep it to yourself like Monica Lewinsky
So we don't blow trial
Or get caught up
When we cheating in the night cause we get hard up
Keep the guards up
When you creeping through
Cause all the bitches that cheat this song's for you
And all the niggas that cheat this song's for you
And everybody that cheat's this song's for you
It goes

Down South,Aktapuss,1996,"(Akinyele) - Hook
You I'm from New York
And connected with my down south niggas
Here this year
My nigga rap bone came to tear the club up
Yo my nigga chock came to tear the club up
My nigga joelle came to tear the club up
And this shit here should get all the thugs up
It's for (the money makers)
What (the booty shakers)
Yea (my real niggas)
And fuck who (the playa haters)
Yea (the move fakers)
Ha (the immitaters)
Yo this is for who (the money makers)
Yea (the booty shakers)
Ha (my real niggas)
Yo and fuck who (the playa haters)
Yea (the move fakers)
And the motherfucking (immitaters)
(Rap Bone)
Now where I'm from these niggas dobn't pimp they pro
Nautica shirts game hats
And nice sweats
And litle niggas got through the mall like packs of wild animals
Anticipating the showdown
In my town
Pretty (?) bitches get fucked
Then they stock just drop
They rpops go bankrupt
So tell me who's pimping heartless
From Jacksonville to Charlotte
I got some (?) goddesses
On our twenty, many
A late lonely night
We coming back from some hype shit
Like FreakNik
Possibly Daytona
Chilling with hook dogs
Smelling the aroma
Drinking wine, from 1989
I'm blinding in the dinette set
And let the sunlight shine
Making vows to remain for ill and tight
Throughout all space and time
So from here to 19 ninety something
My word is as money
I hate to hear my real niggas hungry
So I'm going to represent with my shit
And hit the public
All types of angles
Strangling niggas
With electric car wire
And calling out the frauds like we fucking on fire
Hook
(Chock)
Now most chicks get they back blown
When I let my act roll
Conference on a track phone
I chock and rap bone
Joelle will pack chrome
All through your back zone
And I'm no thug
But will still aim at your black dome
And bust you
In a honda Or if I need to Augusta
You bet we going to get crunk
We pressure in a trunk
When I catch second hand from your dank whenyou flame your skunk
Then take all your bank in the game we tunk
I'm drunk, I guzzle VS, in a bubble GS
All chrome double BS
So on top look like a brother with DS
Down Syndrome
But if you want to find me come around wisdom
How do I say this calmly
You a clown kid son
And you need a check up so go get a papshmere
And if stripped to my wear
I'd have two gats bare
Only a few cats clear
On how I do that there
(Joelle)
I wreck yous down like molecules
When I play them fools
I'm just that little nast nigga
With the ladies sneaking on the jewels
The voice is calm
But my words are strong
Like hurricanes
I might spit
A little cum shit
But it won't stop me from doing my thang
I maintain
When I slangs
]From my native land
Upstate South Cleve West Anderson
It's unexpected
They expect it just the same
Just get in line
Like Carolina's in the (??)
We can't be wrong
Growing up down here
You didn't worry about no ride or no high priced gear
You got to boogy say boogy
Rode in like a champ
Wearing fake gold chain and no shirt is how we pimp
On all sides
The north south east and the west
To niggas got keys got pain got fresh
Fresh went to dope
And dope went to fat
Next thing you know the fools are busting all the gats
Except the parts
So you had to deal before dark
Smoking weed in the club
They don't dance they just just party
Drinking cold malt liquor
Country ass niggas
Booty shaking
Shake
To make them asses move quicker
I picture that
We dirty like floor mats
Ride in the sports coupes big jeeps fly
Hook
(Akinyele)
I go down south to bust a nut
On a down south slut
Look her in the face and tell her girl I want to FUUUUUCK
She be like SHIIIIIIT
There Ak-nel go with that New York DIIIIIIICK
Here take a LIIICK
I beginning grinning
Cause I'm ready to hit it up

Point to the light

I going to go flick it up
I'm gorilla like king kong
While you niggas is little monkeys like Mighty Joe Young
Out of town I know crackers with correct ID
In other words I95 is where you find me
And buy guns from me
In exchange for crack
Road maps
Got me transporting gats
]From the north
And the south tackle that
Bringing it back
To my New York money makers
Who smoke a lot and get high like sky scrapers
Down south i know girls who straight want to rape us
My niggas Rap Bone and Chock here to tape us
My nigga Joelle got some bitches flying in from Jamaica
I got some girls in LA who play like the lakers

Because Hoes R Us
Everywhere we go mad love they show us
Even girls who don't know us
Want to suck our dicks for us

Knocking niggas out the box like skullies
Taking hoes directly to the telly
Make them scream my name two times like Pelle Pelle
Then I put her on they belly
Play it cool like Fonzerelli
]From New York to L.A
Will they
Sell they
Body to me to escape poverty
Before I started boning chicks
I used to watch the porno flicks
Every night I would fuck that same Yoko Ono chick
Anything to get wet
I guess I was just young sad and blue
Like the Lissette cassette
The world made me like this
Girls very rare gave me a kiss
Pulling my dick out only to piss
Now the tables switched and turned
And niggas straight like a perm
Bank I earn
No time to learn
One girl give me all of them
I'll have a ball with them
And when we do change the numbers so they don't call again
We probably see them at the mall again
Or the dance hall again
Fuck it if they wit it we could do it all again
You're a true baller when
They treat you like a king like Soloman
Fuck them like you (?)
Who pussy who pussy

Well you're shit out of luck cause this bitch ain't free

Niggas is pussy like cat litter
Who would ever consider this pepto bismol drinking nigga
Bring a ruckas and I'll start shitting on you motherfuckers

They running through your ass like a laxative Huh
I could get drastic
Like Rupaul swing that dry dick
I get aggy when I hit
I get you boombastic
Cause Akinyele only give you boom back shit
Original incredible lyrical hook for years
But y'all wasn't trying to hear
Like you hear them through (?) ears
I kick it loud and clear
Make you whisper like those motherfucking temptations is out
Hey yea
I end careers
By the pier like pliers
This mic get iced once I cream niggas like Breyers
Paper weight fires
Play them both sides of the fence like barbed wires
But I will make your whole entire empire retire
Once I'm dressed in army atire
All you hear is repeated gun fire
Leaving your chest heated like clunky dryers

Leave you in lakes like Ricky
Think that I was distributing whisky

The rhyme chief maker, hittin punch lines
Like a rapper who slammed his sister loose leaf paper
It don't get no better than this
I got that medicine
For rock veterans
I'm bad to the bone like skeletons
Or some dracula shit
Biting mics turning niggas into vampires
Cause they can't get no light huh
Kid can't you tell
That it's the Aki-NYELE
I be holding this shit down like a bucket ina well
Jammed like hell
And plus I rock your dome without stones
The black stallion
Pack the certified chrome to make you think I'm Italian
From the way that I roam
I drunk and stuck the microphones like BOOOO
Niggas think it's dial tones
And start looking for Miss Jones
You clones
Are soft like foam
I like rap superstars out of their twilight ass zone

Watch me throwing Adolph Hitler signs cause y'all cannot see
Get it Nazi

Cause I walk holdin my balls like the Globetrotters

You think you can hang with Ak? Ha, come the fuck on

I put rappers and singers in they place

Bomb yo' ass like Pearl Harbor

You want harder? I'll, straight, slaughter your daughter
Make your Dame Dash like Shawn Carter
Fuckin jet like a charter
You want harder? I dress harder
I wear a baseball bat cause I'm a troublemaker real starter
Niggas is fish like tartar, you want harder?
I, go to Atlanta bust yo' ass like the martyr/Mardi
Twentyfive to life for four bodies, fourth quarter
You want harder? There's no harder
I'm the hardest, rap artist, yo regardless shit
If you a gold or platinum artist
My mac-10 stick men like the +Midnight Marauders+
Get it? Stic men, album cover, ""Midnight Marauders""

Stay Wild,Live at the Barbecue - Unreleased Hits,2004,"Yo, yo, yo
This is the noise that you make when you runnin with a wild crew
(I recognize realize) Real niggas stay wild
Havin sex with latex and still gettin burnt through
(I recognize realize) Real niggas stay wild
Holdin tec-9's, German Luger 22's pointed at you
(I recognize realize) Real niggas stay wild

Once again I return, leavin you hooked like worms
To burn punk rappers like some type of sick dick sperm
They say Ak is, so obnoxious
I sew motherfuckers like Osh Koshes
And insert cock in bitches crotches
Blaze by phony niggas like fiber optics
Life goes out to BJ known as Sueve
I'm the hottest shit on the streets
Ever since the tar dried upon the pavement
Yes, yes! The rhythm, the rebel
Huh, without a pause, I run through Ju-Ju-and-Ju
Like a holocaust with no remorse
The blue collar boss, known at the {?}
Punk rappers attack us like Lee patches tryin to rip us off
Ready to come, fiend for this loot, but nevertheless
Us niggas stayin wearin a vest, like a three piece suit
So you can shoot, or either Shoop like, Salt-N-Pepa
See that girl group Nuttin' Nyce, they know I'm down for whateva
Wheneva, whereva, howeva, Ripley believe it or not
There's no days never (never.. never..)
My slant mouth muzzle as I guzzle on a 40 ounce
A puzzle cause they still can't, put it together
It's the thug that kills, I take your face, out the freezer
And show you heaters that'll defrost your ice grill
I'm +Ill+, +Al Skratch+, like Mills and his WB
Is +Real+ in my +World+ and I'm not talkin no, MTV
I'm talkin bout, Akinyele
The grown woman getter
I keep fly girl birds on my shoulder sweater like beretta
It's all about cheddar
I make more cheese than mozzarella
So when you see me on the street you better say ""Hi Akafella""
Huh, you know I mastered this shit
I put my signatures on spatulas in case I gotta flip the script
Walkin the streets, with my Lefrak crew soundin like..

(I recognize realize) Real niggas stay wild
This is the sound that you say when you runnin with the wild crew
(I recognize realize) Real niggas stay wild
For the niggas havin sex with latex and still gettin burnt through
(I recognize realize) Real niggas stay wild
Tec-9's, German Lu's, 22's
(I recognize realize) Real niggas stay wild
Aimed at you.. aimed at you..
(I recognize realize) Real niggas stay wild
Aimed at you.. yes, yes, yes, yes, check it
Rob Swift.. Rob Swift.. Rob Swift.. Rob Swift!

Check it, turn it down
Forget all that five minute long song and not sayin nuttin
It only take us but two minutes and some odd seconds

With eight bitches and a pie pizza filled with anchilates
And all ya'll girls can have a slice on me
Cause tonight me and my people we fucking for free

You know how it is on these streets tryin' to make a million
If I was talkin square biz I'd be out sellin' Cicilians

The Robbery Song,Put It In Your Mouth EP,1996,"Hook
Niggas know we do robberies, we ain't running up in no crib for 2 G's
We want about 50 Thou and 4 Ki's
And maybe after that we just might breath
But if you think it can't happen, nigga please
We put you on your knees, like you was praying
We ain't playing
It's the O-FFI-CIAL, O-RIG-INAL, SEASON-AL, motherfucking CRIMI-NALS
You know the format, ringing your bell, standing on your doormat
'Who Is It?"" Thats your sentence
Looking through the peephole with your eyes squinching
Too late, we kicked the door off the hinges
I heard you selling stacks of crack getting mad-tracked
Thats why we in your place, throwing your face in the carpet
With the rug rats, where the drugs at, FUCK THAT!
I represent broke niggas who ain't no joke nigga
Bullets rolled in Bamboo cause we here to smoke niggas
And fuck them uppercuts, like we here to fight you up
Man, we hang you from a chandalier and light you up
We like free delivery cause we take niggas out
Leaving you cracking like Daffy with duct tape on your mouth
And roping you with strings and tessles squeezing your blood vessel
Leaving your ass tied up like pretzels
Ak to the Inye to the Le, rolling with real G's
Doing these official robberies Yes!
Hook
I'm on some Mike Tyson ex-wife shit kid
Thats how I'm living
Cause when I start robbing, you'd better start giving
How else you think the money's supposed to come thats why
When I need bread I grab the toaster and stick niggas for they crumbs
I extort as you get stuck for bucks
Whether its in airplanes or airports cause I don't give a flying fuck
I drop it like an incinerator was the topic
Cause I'll be damned if you ain't
I'll empty in your pockets
Shake you like Gelatin, and for all you good semaritans playing hero
Akinyele put one in your belly
And leave your stomachs looking like the number 0
As a rob like work cause I need mad dinero
Cream, like Vaseline put you in Intensive Care
With the Tech 9 backing you up like spines
Taking your materialistic things like rings
Like your ho, your doe, gold and diamonds
I turned this art into art-tillery
With guns that bark to keep them from killing me
On point, like a sword cause I always stay on board
Ready to clap a stinking victim like a fucking applause
Anywhere, anyplace
Even if you got condoms in your wallet
That don't mean your money's safe
So act like you not having it when I start grabbing it
Guns in your face (gibberish) like you talk Arabic
Holding a Mac that I pimp like a mack
But some of you macks, never find a Mac
Ever since you lost that job at McDonalds
But I know that I'll Mork your ass like Nanu-Nanu
By putting one shell in your head like a rhino
Or I'll do to 2 to your head
Before I damn wanted to let you know that you ain't who's hot
And you niggas not making it home in the fucking morning

I take it day by day, strivin to live like the Romans
Instead of shoppin at Lomans I wanna roam the globe wearin robes
Fuck, designer clothes and them minor hoes
I got my beer{?} back up against the wall like vaginals
Tryin to go straight, instead I go diagonal
Which path to go, which path to walk
When I was young I used to push my niggas through the park
And past marked shoppin carts, lettin guns spark
Desert Eagles and I'm not talkin bout motherfuckin hawks
Makin money, gettin dough that was my style
I wanted to blow, like some juve, who didn't make it home from trial
Meanwhile I profile with two, guns that I'm holdin in
Seperate hands, like I'm in the dancehall, bo-gglin
I know that's when I had visions of, livin in prison
No time to ask questions, no time to start quizzin
Talkin bout - IT'S HIM, IT'S HIM, IT'S HIM, IT'S HIM

Gunnin and sunnin, niggas like students
I realized the world was in my hand ever since
I rubbed my fingertips, on my jeans and got the blueprints
Now I'm changin my, government, name like Prince
Y'all can't see me, as if I was dressed in tints
Bein invincible, that's the Joe Clark principle
I'm livin proof like alcohol with Dr. {?}
Too sensible, what you expect when this un+Usual Suspect+
Leave the mic crippled and bent, like Verbal Kint
I still represent niggas like legal aid
Front on me you take a loss, all day, every day
Better yet, 
catch a couple of L's like Cool J
The Ak still rip, even if I don't do that
EH, EHHH, EHHH, EH-EHH type shit - see me no make no joke

The Bomb,Vagina Diner,1993,"It's the bomb, baby
The bomb, baby
With no ifs, no ands, no buts, and no maybes

I walk through the projects with stress in my hands
A bad young man from the Lefrak lands
They say I got an attitude, that's rude
Because I walked over Elvis' grave in some blue suede shoes
PUNK, I got some some stuff that'll bust through your pest LUMP
Clearing cells CHUMP, you know the Ak shit BUMP
But every now and then they say (he's wack)
But deep down in your heart
You and them dudes from Ripley's don't believe that
Everyone's down with the Ak brother
Every place I go people be like UDDA UDDA, UDDA
Trying to get the slang down pat, using verbs and syllables, shit
But I'll flip the style like half a brick
So give me space like NASA, one deep like a bachelor
I turn shit over without a spatula
You know how it goes by now, word to God
Lyrics are so hard they'll be Kevin Costner's bodyguard
Move over Whitney Houston, I'm not losing
By the way woman, yo, my name's not Susan
It's the Akinyel', I rock well and with more clientele
Than a guy with long caps of crack to sell
I take poetry and start illin' with it
Homicide police be looking for me from the way I be killing and shit
You niggas can't push along, with the Ak song
Because this shit here's the bomb!
Chorus

I catch wreck like an automatic tec
Ripping rhymes as if it was written with Gilletes
Rapping over slamming tracks
My hand's compared to a drug called crack
Because it don't take much to get your ass smacked
So you can save bullshit
Word is bond get your shoehorn
Because I got a style that fit
See Akinyele be cold cuttin' brothers up like a DELI
Keeping my cool like Arthur FONZARELLI
I kick more black ass than Jim KELLY
Nowadays ain't shit that they could TELL ME
They give me mines from state to state
And gettin' so much props, my occupation should be real estates
So now it's time to face up
But if you play your jaw like a sneaker yo it's bound to get laced up
For the MC's that LOST IT
I'll treat your wack rhymes like a frisbee, watch the Ak TOSS IT
Selling out it what ya CAUSED IT
Charlie Angel rapper make like Farrah
And get rinsed down the FAUCET
'cause I'm coming at 'em
So save them devilish tricks for Eve if you don't know me from Adam
My lyrics are hotter than summer school
My image, far from an air conditioner because I never blow my cool
No thumbs up, nor a COLLAR
I won't scream or HOLLER
I make MC's sit they five DOLLAR ass down
'cause all they do is scream and speak in tongues
RAH RAH RAH, but I bust your motherfuckin' lungs
Burning up charts with the rhymes I spark
Cardiologist to words 'cause it comes from the heart
Brain is on steroids, keeping the lyrics strong
Huh, this shit here is called the bomb!
Chorus

I treat the mic like glass, 'cause I slash
Thirsty rappers' ass on a Friday night without no hockey mask
I make Jason meet his doom
I hit him with the bass from the room that goes
Ba-do-doom-do-do-DOOM
You can't fuck with it 'cause I'm a little too exquisite
For y'all snake-ass lizards
Check my style right before you freestyle
My style's hostile, Teddy Ted heard it he said ""Oooh child""
I'm quick to damage you amateurs some of you pros
Know on the downlow that I'll assassinate your character
To think that you can get with this
With all them dreams you fuck around and put Freddy out of business
Because I'm a rapper's worst nightmare
Bringing tears for fears, I'm more bad news than the BEARS
Say a lot for success, I won't DARE
I'm not Shadoe Stevens so I cease to be just another Hollywood
SQUARE
I rope 'em like a lasso, you'd better dash yo
Don't stand around and be another Denis Leary asshole
You'll get chopped like vegetables
I leave plenty many hanging like testicles, huh
Doing what I have to
To get room to breathe even if it means knocking out your asthma
This Ak flow ain't no fad
I be smoking niggas like cigarettes because they style is just a fucking drag
I done blew up the World Trade and Vietnam
Huh, because this shit here is the bomb!

I'm not the type of guy to run up and down and break out in a sweat
I just make the words sound hip
I leave it up to Jane Fonda, to take care of that physical fit shit
Nothin' wrong with bein overWEIGHT, everything's STRAIGHT
So long as my pockets stay in SHAPE
I never participated in gym
I hated the thought, to even have to take a loss to begin
They say health brings you longevity
But I'm not one for that extra-curriculum activity
You might see the Ak, with a baseball hat
Won't see me on no field with no baseball bat
In case some nigga head, got to get cracked
Other than that, I don't plan to run track
Picture me joggin' for miles.. HA!
Come on kid, that's just not my style
I just talk to girls on the horn
You won't see the Ak upstairs, puttin' no butter on his corns
Another athlete bites the dust
Another nigga from Egypt, make Egyptian Musk

I get ghost before the homicide come
But that's a different subject; that's called games of death
When your man play Russian roulette while upset
He can't handle it, he wants to stop it
He grabs the hammer and cock it, but that's a whole different topic
I just throw my voice on plastic
You won't see me wrasslin' in no arena, gettin my ass kicked
Or better yet boxin' in, some ring with gloves
Talkin about pssh-pssh, losin oxygen
You know the whole blase-BLASAH, the Ak SAGA
I'm quick, to run your shit like a JOGGER
Huh! I don't carry no stop clock
I knock the J off of Jock, so you can just call me Ak
Yeah, it's just that simple son
On my spare time, I be rackin' bitches up, at the Wimbledon

Shoulder pads and helmet, yeah right
Talkin' that Hut One, Hut Two, Hut Three, Hike: psych

I got all my life to live
And I got so much love to give
But I gotta survive, and make papes outta state
I'm ready to make papes outta state

Ak to the Nel to the LE, I'm tryin hard as hell
To pick my future before my future picks me
Twenty-one years of AGE, not with minimum WAGE
Don't ever seem like I'mma get paid rhymin on the STAGE
College, I always dreamt of tryin it; the only problem here
I don't seem to meet financial aid requirements
Locked writin rhymes in the crib -- when would I get out?
Seems like I'm pushin yo a hip-hop bid
At home the vibes don't feel right
My parents keep lookin at me as if I'm some type of parasite
My moms separated from her spouse
The oldest of two kids, it's my job to play man of the house
That means gettin off my ASS, makin immediate CASH
That broke shit, save it for an orthopedic CAST
I get road maps, learned the interstate
Shit I'm headed out state to make papes; man
Chorus

I'm ready to get up on a scam trip
The I-95 outta state to make the damn loot flip!
First I need a crackhead with a credit card
So he can head uptown and purchase me a rented car
Just make sure that it's black
And take off the rearview mirror cause it ain't no lookin back
I'm goin one deep, in the driver's seat
Throwin out the vegetarian book cause I'm ready for beef
I got a three-hundred and fifty-seven, faren-degrees-heit
Of HEAT, better known as a burner on the STREET
Cool, I got the keys to the CAR
Accelerate on the gas, and have the rubber burn up
On the TAR, I'm out to get money real FAR
I hear my moms voice, {singing} ""I'm wishin on a star!!""
But I got to go far ma! {sing} ""But I could wonder where you are!""
On the streets just DELIVERIN, packages
So I can just relax and get some type of LIVIN
Think that it is when it ISN'T
Easy to see a family, suffer from povery, as bein GIVEN
Man, like heck, and when I get back
I'mma rip up them welfare checks
I got a new nine to five mom, so don't wait up late
My job's located outta state
Chorus

I reached my destiny and my goal
I done flashed right past the dumb-ass highway patrol
If everything goes well I'm in it to win it
I'm tryin to find a hotel so I can rest up for a minute
A round of crackheads gonna show me -- neighborhood clowns
Fear me up and down cause they really don't know me
But all my hits, I see them scopin out the clip
They wanna get open, I can let shit rip!
Whatever is broke got to be fixed, twenty dimes and nicks
Step into my house made of bricks
My man gave me work, home on credit
You think that I'm comin back? Tch, black he can forget it
Cause I got moves to MAKE, no time to be FAKE
Bad enough gotta watch out for a SNAKE called JAKE
Money nonstop, kept in the hush
At twelve o'clock, I'mma catch, huh, the midnight rush
And watch the dough flow like water
I'm not Taco Bell but hell I'mma make a run for the border
I feel odd, like a extraterrestrial left alone
A calling card number, so I could phone home
To let my people know my mission went great
On my great escape to outta state

You wanna play Biz Mark AGAIN
And tell him I'm just a FRIEND
So buy me Newports, cause as I smoke
All I do is think about you and child support
But I don't got papes, I got money
Sticking up and messing up when I went outta state
So you can stop all that FIENDIN'
With your damn SCHEMIN'
You're Christopher Williams cause you must be DREAMIN'
Wake up and escape
And while you're at it, why don't you throw away your Jodeci tapes
Cause you can be forever my lady
But I ain't with no baby
Ah, ah, no ifs ands or maybes
I ain't old enough and ain't trying to hear it
So don't steal my youth cause I'm still young in spirit
That belly blows up, it's gonna be trouble
I'mma have to play like a pin and come pop that bubble
Find Chucky if you want child's play
I'll give your ass a hanger and drop you off in an alleyway
This is a diary of a black man
By making no alimony payments due to no wedding bands
So axe that talk about MARRAGE
Miss, you must of misunderstood
I want you to have a MISCARRAGE
I'm fed up, and sorry that I've done it
I'm ready to set her up
And have my little man kick her in the stomach
Or punch my fist through that naval
Cause I'll be damned if this be the hand that rocks the cradle
Or push her down a flight of steps
I don't care or give a heck
About the people under the stairs
I'm all about a home made ABORTION
My name's not Pat, so don't Say Jack, black
This ain't the damn Wheel of FORTUNE
I don't want no pause or no PORTION
Next time woman you should proceed with CAUTION
It ain't all about boy and girl
A half hour past the Cosby Show
Cause you, it's a whole different world
And yo, that's how live I am
Use a diaphragm, I get it off your chest like a mammogram
Oh brother, word to mother
Just cause I talk this shit don't get me wrong
Yo, I still luh hur
I luh hur (repeat 5X)
Nobody tell her, because I luh hur
I luh hur (repeat 8X)",https://genius.com/Akinyele-i-luh-hur-lyrics
Checkmate,Vagina Diner,1993,"FUCK THORWING JOINTS !!!
I throw incinerators at rappers that talk garbage about the Ak
They don't know me from a tree in the forest
My name's not summer, so I don't sweat it
Most y'all niggas know I cut ya like cheese that's cheddared
I been around the world like Lisa Stansfield's tour bus
Tearin' niggas up from here to West Bubblefuck
So don't front like you don't know what my name is
Before I start diving up in that ass like Greg Louganis
That's not my number one AIM IS
You take my style of speech
And live like Robin Leach and seek the lifestyle
Of rich and FAMOUS
I dare another rapper try to TAME THIS
I hit you in the ANUS
Once I reach for the damn STAINLESS Steel
This ain't the pretty boy feel sex-appeal
It's Ak, a.k.a. the real deal
I make punk rappers stutter, y-yoyoy-yoyoy-yoyo
I bring out the Das EFX in a motherfucker
I'm living larger than a mansion, you hear me?
You fear me
You're just a Little House on the Prairie
Leave 'fore Hurricane Ak come blowin' in
All you motherfuckers best to breeze like the wind
Check the news forecast
I place a Con Edison sticker on your butt
If you're light in the ass
Close your eyes, and concentrate it's time to recognize
The Ak keep brothers on checkmate

Check over there, and then check over here
Just lend me your ear, c'mon listen

Nigga you just can't defeat me
Child abusers walk around, knowing they just can't beat me
So don't try to take the winner's belt
Ay yo, this ain't April first so don't dare fool yourself
It don't get no liver, I'm hitting harder than a chastiser
I flip rhymes like saliva, pounding on your BRAIN
With the sick shit I'm SAYING
I got more GAME than a panhandler on the TRAIN
Huh, it's rare if I don't catch props
I'm the Ak I tear that ass out the frame like a benzie box
You know the rules if you ain't rough
Stay on the hush
And get played like Sunday school shoes and get scuffed
I put heads to bed like newlyweds
Sing your rap eulogy
Cause now you're good as dead
Hit the deck, once I round it off like a Tec
I play you like a game of chess and keep your ass in check
Checkmate

Check all around, and then check for them clowns
Check the fuckin' real sound, break down

In English, MCs can't last
Similar to a car crash, I got rap in a smash
Whenever you wanna get loose and hang out
Remember I done turned enough troops into The Last Boy Scout
Think it's lies? Then come try
Otherwise make like a librarian and keep your ass quiet
I'm out to catch the winner's cup
All you number one contenders just got knocked to the runner's up
What nigga what? I'm blowin up the spot with dynamite
Rhymes by the Ak
Airports: they amazed of me
Shit cause I fly so much heads, I have my own travel agency
Raps are fat like SUMO, slammin' like JUDO
I won't get abused like members of MENUDO
I got the art down pat, pass the courderoy
This bad boy about to start to slack
Fuck how ""I could just kill a maaaan""
I'm slick and puttin' brothers out with these N-word Niggahands
Ten fingers of death, grippin' microphones
Holdin' my own, sparkin' rhymes up like rhinestones
Rippin' up challengers
Creating a mess on stage out of comedian rappers like Gallagher
My mind is filthier than a HAMPER
Dirty like a CAMPER
On top of that, I've been through more shit than PAMPERS
Fake is what I ain't
Picasso the Great don't know me from a can of paint
Listen to how the soundwaves vibrate
You can't relate, I got your whole brain on checkmate

Rob Swift is his name, with Akineyle in the game
You're best to maintain, as we aim for your brain
As we aim for your brain (3x)",https://genius.com/Akinyele-checkmate-lyrics

Verse One:
Yo, y'all know what's about to happen
When I proceed to give you what you need and the Ak start rappin
I throw rhymes like children throwin balls on project bricks
In other words I be kickin that old off the wall shit

My name itself bring more Heartbeats than Robert Townsend
I hurdle over rappers like a stallion
Carry it back with more Fame than Debbie Allen, nigga
Chorus
Verse Three:
My lyrics'll reign real bright so dim the lights and it won't get DULLER
It doesn't take Rosie Perez to see my living COLOR
I rain over heads just like an UMBRELLA
So strong that baby's boosted and I'm FULLER

Throw and kneel, but you're still, MC's I be BREAKIN
Ak saniTATION
I leave skid marks on the concrete streets
From all the brothers that I be scrapin
Chorus
Verse Four:
Permanent scars as I sabotage
My style's so milky I should get down with Haagen-Daaz
More heatwave than a do rag does to a CAESAR

Once the hip-hop strangeler
I throw your whole rap on a coat rack kid and just hang it up
Chorus
Verse Five:
So step to the AK-ER, the hip-HOPPER
And get your ass kicked like a game of SOCCER
Skills are fatter than a grease spot
Cuz I love to rock that nasty home-cooked hip-hop
I watch girls check it, I make bitches wanna jump butt-naked
Like the Doo Doo Brown record
But now I peep on low and they have to stop
When they hear my name, the motherfuckin Ak",https://genius.com/Akinyele-ak-ha-ha-ak-hoo-hoo-lyrics
Dear Diary,Vagina Diner,1993,"My vocals sound dynamic when it's placed on track
Me wack? Your local mechanic couldn't even fix his mouth to say that
I'll make a rapper change his occupation
And have him selling hot dogs if he ain't saying nathan'
I wait for challengers to pick a day to beef
I'm not a calendar-
I'll knock your ass to the middle of next week (next week)
Leaving you OUTDATED, I'm R-RATED
Niggas on my dick was to fall off if I was to get CASTRATED
No need to explain
I'm doper than heroin, so just take my name in vain
You can't follow the Ak's footmarks
I'll throw your raps in a shoebox and let the bullshit WALK!
I straighten up those who be slacking up
In other words I'm not a film director
So don't come over here acting up
You know just who I AM
This ain't the DAMN Macho MAN Wrestling PROGRAM
Over here you get SLAMMED on the premises
Remeber this, the name Akenyele it don't rhyme with Genesis
I'm not the one to get played
This ain't the arcade
Pull over here and you'll find your fingers in the yellow page
You can't hang with the kid
My lrics are so bad they're only taught in school 600
So all you rappers keep eyeing me
But just admire me
And write this shit in your diary
Dear, dear diary (I kicked it plain and simple)
Write it in your book, kid
Dear, dear diary (I kicked it plain and simple)
Put it on your pages
Dear, dear diary (I kicked it plain and simple)
Write it in your book, kid
Dear, dear diary...check it out
Yo Rob Swift! (Rob Swift gets business) x4
All you got to do is just set it
Better yet act like you want it and see if you don't get it
I walk over rappers like doormats
Save all that Nino Brown chat for all them other New Jacks
In your CITY, with your whole damn COMMITTEE
Your butt-ass rhymes are all SHITTY
So don't riff cause I'm in a class by myself
Make like a ventriloquist, talk that shit someplace else
Lyrics you pick are all simple
And all like swift to come out your face like a dam pimple
But just so you can't follow this
My rhymes penetrate to the skin just like a dermatologist
Best to head to the CLINIC
Cause Akenyele's style about to spread like an EPIDEMIC
I don't talk past the speed LIMIT
One style's a GIMMICK
I won't change up because I'm not a SCHIZOPHRENIC
Pushing a wooden box
6 foot 6 is what you catch if you step to the Ak
I kill a rapper's better one sec
If he ever play me like an accident and think he can catch wreck
Shit (sheee...)
Once I COMBINE ya, here's another REMINDER
Niggas can get stomped down to CHINA
In other words get that ass kicked
I'll send your wack baby-ass raps right back to pediactrics
Play the back before you get smacked
Ask like a Lumberjack, I come from the projects of Lefrack
AK to the NEL
Don't give a HELL who you wanna TELL
Not an intercom but my name rings BELLS
So all you rappers c'mon, if you want to start trying me
But write this shit in your diary",https://genius.com/Akinyele-dear-diary-lyrics
No Exit,Vagina Diner,1993,"I wanna get out this relationship
But I'm scared that my man will flip
He always swears how he's gonna kill me
And fill me with the bullets from his clip

I met her in Queens
Her personality was erotic
She asked me where I come from
And I just replied ""the projects""
Love at first sight as she was staring
Checking me up and down
Yeah, at the gear that I was wearing
I had an North Face jacket, Polo shirt
Diamond on my hand
Stonewashed pants tucked inside of some Timberlands
Her eyes just stayed on my face
She threw her hand on my hip
And felt the four-fifth on my waist
Yo, my name is Ak the hard rock from the block
That shot a cop with a Glock
Cause he tried to make the money stop!
She didn't speak, she didn't START, she didn't TALK
All of the sudden let's take a WALK through the PARK
But it was dark, she didn't bother
She probably thought I was trying to play her out
Like a Central Park jogger
But that's not my style, that's what I'm telling ya
Give me your number and I'll probably call you up on my cellular
At night we spoke for hours and hours and hours and hours
Hot convo turned into cold showers
Monogamy, yo, increased to pornography
Miss Astrologist because she looked like a star to me
But I be dressing sharper than the brothers with Farrakahan
Throwing a lucky charm without a leprachaun's arm
Out on the streets, stealing and sticking up
I try to make her look appealing
I went out and started tricking bucks
I got her all dressed up, she used to look messed up
Now all of her friends can't wait to be next up
I need to get her thoughts fixed up
Her brain fell into a blender, she got the stuff all mixed up
She caught me talking about a quits
But that's that old bullshit
It's ain't over til I say it's over, miss
So if you wanna catch a fit, you catch a melon split
Once you in, there ain't no exit


I talk a good game of pain
Put it in your ear and let it rain
Benadryl can't stop the migrane
Once my voice touch your brain
So you can talk that fast slang dialect
But I got a tec to keep you in check
Other words make you come correct
Think that to stop giving the loving
You must be smoking pesticide
Because you're damn sure bugging
After one hit, you're ready to split
What, are you test crashing cars?
That's that ol' dum-dum shit
You don't flatter me tring to sign off
You best to take the batteries out your watch
If you want some time off
I write my name on your street curb
So you can scratch my letters ,girl
If you wanna mark my words
I got the Calamine BESIDE ME
In case you wanna TRY ME
And break out on my ass like poison IVY
You better take it or ease, roll up you sleeves
Be prepared to go all out like New Year's Eve
Trying to take my dough like a Swaggart
Girl, I have to bag ya
Fall on your head like Niagara
Shit, you're bound to catch it, once I start to flex it
Ay yo, bum bitch, there ain't no exit",https://genius.com/Akinyele-no-exit-lyrics
30 Days,Vagina Diner,1993,"I never did time, committed mad crime
Only paid rhymes, but now niggas drop dimes
Harmonizin on a homicide rap
Singin in the precinct, tryin to catch an R&B contract
Now they hit me with a one to THREE, personal-LY
Conspira-CY, it don't mean shit to ME
The time will go fast, because I'm true blue
On the DL, back home, I got a stash for Ma Duke
I stack razor blades in my shoe
Niggas threaten to kill the Ak, if I ever come through
And I'm doin 30 more days, in this steel cage
Locked down with men that go both ways
But gays ain't gon' grease me
My razor blade say O.P.P., niggas in P.C. gon' know me
I'm not the everyday herb
Actions speak louder than words, so step to the verb
Fuck a pro-noun, I get down for my crown
Pass the three-pound, show it to King Clown, and watch him lounge
You know the whole PHASE
I'm about to go through the government's MAZE
In about 30 days
You know my name, no shame in my game
Best to fly the kid champagne from Spain
About to go in, to push a BID, for wrongs I done DID
Goin away party at the CRIB
Me and my friends gonna get together
I didn't think jail could ever, I learned to never say never
But now we just gonna party.. party..
Shit, fiesta.. for-ever..
Gun ? up on my floor
All my peeps know they got to keep they damn guns at the door
Don't wanna get hit, with a bullet, meanin a year time in jail
If you can't, comprehend, with the slang friend
All you do, don't act like nuts
It don't make no sense for the whole crew, to get locked up
Bad enough I have to go in yo
But when the shit hit the fan, debris' gotta blow
Windy days, but ain't nothin changed but the weather
While I'm locked down, the thugs'll write me no love letters
That's for queers, couple of years
Later gator, but hold all them crocodile tears
Because it ain't like I'm dyin
You see I'm not marked for death, so stop the bloodclot cryin
This ain't The Wizard of Oz where I can tap my heels and go for it
I take it slow, cause I'll be home before you know it
I'm comin through like X-rays
In approximately, the next 30 days
But if you think I'm tryin to skip town
You best to purchase a hearing aid and ask yourself how that sound
I'm not tryin to jump bail, cause that's the dough
That I'mma use to flip up the new connects, that I meet in jail
Politicians they all know dis
Every now and then they visit a snitch, who helped em get rich
Yeah part of the government's plan
Lock down the man who stack grands, put him in the hand of Uncle Sam
This the stuff, you can't trust for 30 days
I'm on a bus with niggas that fuss over tight handcuffs
And while I'm inside, I take in stride
Livin in prison, stool pigeons know that time don't fly
Days go by, night gets darker, but I'm a New York
Whalin on your ass like Orca
Not the Avon Lady, stay up out my face
It only take a shoelace, for a nigga to catch a new case
You get done in different ways
I'm headed for the cage
Within the next 30 days

Worldwide,Vagina Diner,1993,"Yeah yeah yeah
We got my man Extra P in the house
But me and my man Akinyele
You know we goin Worldwide this tour
Cause yo you know how that go
We gon' get together y'all, word up
That's how we gon' bring it to you
We gon' go all around the world
Get this money, and do what we got to do
Word up, my man Rhasaan in the house
We gon' bring it to y'all like this, word up
Just give it to em Ak.. UHH

I been in and out all areas
And all you true hip-hop fans, you know the Ak's takin care of ya
Slap your ass with real rap
I keep it underground, like subways, so I can stay on track
I'm not a carpenter, but I'll cut the rug
Think you can hang with Ak? Ha, that's your brain on drugs
Smack fire out your ass like a flag from _Backdraft_
Didn't peep the movie, you don't know the half
Schoolin MC's until they start learnin
We don't gotta be Mississippi to watch the Ak start Burning
I kick that shit that's known to hit
So much rap lines, you might fuck around and hang clothes on it
But yo it ain't no THING in it, your static-free rhymes
That you kick, need to be kicked, cause it doesn't got no CLING in it
Then you turn around and start SINGIN it
Hard Akinyele be brought, so I'm here to start BRINGIN it
First cannibalistic rhymer, eatin bitch niggas
By the statistics, like, Jeffery Dahmer's
Huh, scrapin you like a SCULPTURE, murder you for the VULTURE
My dozen dirty, my brains be donated to agri-CULTURE
So come on and face it, my skills are like medicine nigga
You just don't wanna taste it
You best to slide to the side, another corner of the map
Cause this here is worldwide
Worldwide -- yeah yeah (repeat 4X)

Put them tired rhymes to bed, and loosen up your laces
Your shoes are too tight, and now it's goin to your HEAD
Me you feel you can pull with
Remember that I'm not a matador, so get off that bull-shit
I put rappers and singers in they place
A real rudebwoy with the raz', I write it all over your face
Leavin you bloodier than a MaxiPad
Crayola crayons, they'd have to Color Me Badd
So play like a midget and FORGET it
Cause I put oil to the fire, like an arsonist
When it comes time to SET it
I get more run than an ATHLETIC
Sharp as a hyper-DERMIC
Lyrics are flavored up like a dia-BETIC
I recoups, and they try to step to this
Nowadays I probably have as much kids as Jerry Lewis
My rhymes drip like a RAZOR, punch like Joe FRAZIER
I don't sell shoes, because I don't believe in FAVORS
Ducks better break North, before I start
Baggin that ass, like a motherfuckin washcloth
Winnin battles cause I'm a hip-hop soldier
Act like you know, and fuck what your girl told ya
No bluff, for years I've been IN THIS
A nine to five employee don't got shit on me
Cause I done stepped to nuff rapper BUSINESS
Beggin for for-GIVENESS
Channel 7 news and people from Jehovah done WITNESSED
The whole Akinyele vibe
You know what I'm sayin kid, this here is worldwide
Worldwide -- yeah yeah (repeat 4X)

Ak not catchin wreck, come the fuck on
Ring the alarm, I drop bombs like the Guard in Vietnam
I kick that shit, niggas dream to write
My brain so hot that it ignites, but you can't see the light
Fast rappers can't speed by this, you better slow down
Because I'm puttin the brakes on your ass like Midas
Nope, it don't matter what type of slang you drop
I give you rope and you still can't hang with the Ak
For years I put ears through therapy
Watch a episode of Cheers before you come try the beer with me
I graduated from lobbies, bangin on walls for a hobby
I battle anybody, even a dead body
I got rhymes that would attack ya
So you better watch your back, or fuckin hire a chiropractor
Ain't nuthin change from BEFORE, slap niggas with mani-CURES
Stomp you down, after a pedi-CURE
Here's another lesson, I'm not a quiz
So that talk about me not gettin biz that's out of the question
It's a Ak, jam, god damn don't get slammed
You catch the backhand, word to my dead man
You best to rest if you want peace
Cause like a hooker from up the street, I'm down for beef
I'm hotter than a sauna again the drama is rugged
Word to Sinead O'Connor, I be tearin shit up
Cause I sprayin immaculate, like a Mac-11..
* impossible to make out the rest of the verse with voiceovers *
I take you to London Worldwide
I take you to Europe Worldwide
Come back to Queens Worldwide
I take you to Russia Worldwide
I take it to the North pole Worldwide
I bring it back to Queens
I give it to em Worldwide
I take it to the West Indies
I give it to em Worldwide
I take you to India
I give it to em Worldwide
I bring it back to Queens

My girl is pregnant, I'm ready to start splitting
All around the town on the down low was the girl that I was hitting
Everyone knows I used to luh huh
I don't want this pregnant talk to get back to my mother
Shit! I just can't believe it
I thought me and this lady had came to a mutual agreement
But I was dead wrong, her trick was evil and I'll
All along girlfriend I though you was still on the pill
Step to the G-Y-N
The gynecologist, miss, so we can put this to an end
You'll need some dough, I'll probably lend
You wanna play Biz Mark again
And tell him I'm just a friend
So buy me Newports, cause as I smoke
All I do is think about you and child support
But I don't got papes, I got money
Sticking up and messing up when I went outta state
So you can stop all that fiendin'
With your damn schemin'
You're Christopher Williams cause you must be dreamin'
Wake up and escape
And while you're at it why don't you throw away your Jodeci tapes
Cause you can be forever my lady, but I ain't with no baby
Ah, ah, no ifs ands or maybes
I ain't old enough and ain't trying to hear it
So don't steal my youth cause I'm still young in spirit
That belly blows up, it's gonna be trouble
Imma have to play like a pin and come pop that bubble
Find Chucky if you want child's play
I'll give your ass a hanging and drop you off in an alleyway
This is a diary of a black man
By making no alimony payments due to no wedding bands
So ax that talk about marrage
Miss, you must of misunderstood, I want you to have a miscarrage
I'm fed up, and sorry that I've done it
I'm ready to set her up and have my little man kick her in the stomach
Or punch my fist through that naval
Cause I'll be damned if this be the hand that rocks the cradle
Or push her down a flight of steps
I don't care or give a heck
About the people under the stairs
I'm all about a home made abortment
My name's not Pat, so don't send Jack Black
This ain't the damn Wheel of fortune
I don't want no pause or no portion
Next time woman you should proceed with caution
It ain't all about boy and girl
A half hour past the Cosby Show
Cause you, it's a whole different world
And yom that's how live I am
Use a diaphragm, I get it off your chest like a mammogram
Oh brother, word to mother
Just cause I talk this shit don't get me wrong
Yo, I still luh hur
