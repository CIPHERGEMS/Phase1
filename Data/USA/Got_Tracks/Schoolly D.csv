P.S.K. What Does It Mean?,Schoolly D,1984.0,"(The official adventures of...)

PSK
 we're making that green
People always say, ""What the hell does that mean?""
P for the people who can't understand
How one homeboy became a man
S for the way we scream and shout
One by one I'm knocking you out
K for the way my DJ cutting
Other MC's, man you ain't saying nothing
Rocking on to the break of dawn
I think Code Money, your time is on


Driving in my car down the avenue
Towing on a j, sipping on some brew
Turned around, see the fly young lady
Pull to the curb and park my Mercedes
Said ""Fly lady, now you're looking real nice
Sweeter than honey, sugar and spice""
Told her my name was MC Schoolly D
All about making that cash money
She said, ""Schoolly D, I know your game
Heard about you in the hall of fame""
I said, ""Mama, mama, I tell you no lies
'Cause all I wanna do is to get you high
And uh - lay you down and do the body rock""
Took a walk to the corner, got into the car
Took a little trip to a fancy bar
Copped some brew, some j, some coke
Tell you now, brother, this ain't no joke
She got me to the crib, she laid me on the bed
I fucked her from my toes to the top of my head
I finally realized the girl was a whore
Gave her ten dollars, she asked me for some more


Clinton Road one Saturday night
Towing on a cheeba I was feeling alright
Then my homie-homie called me on the phone
His name is Chief Keith, but we call him Bone
Told me 'bout this party on the Southside
Copped my pistol, jumped into the ride
Got at the bar, copped some flack
Copped some cheeba-cheeba, it wasn't wack
Got to the place, and who did I see
A sucker-ass nigga trying to sound like me
Put my pistol up against his head
And said, ""You sucker-ass nigga I should shoot you dead""
A thought ran across my educated mind
Said, man, Schoolly D ain't doing no time
Grabbed the microphone and I started to talk
Sucker-ass nigga, man, he started to walk",https://genius.com/Schoolly-d-psk-what-does-it-mean-lyrics

MC Schoolly D, and I’m on the beatbox
I've never had a party that I didn't rock
And every baby girl thinks she's gettin' the world
I've never made a tune that wasn't too cool
Never been stopped next to T O P
For him to try to fuck with MC Schoolly D
2 Dolla bitches, they on my riches
Suckah MC's taken out with the dishes
Rhymes so delicious, raps so vicious
Buy me a wife to do my dishes

Based on fact, not based fictitious

We do it from the front, and we do it from the back

And the only thing you'll doin'
But the only thing you'll get is burn, baby burn

Can't run hack cuz she gave herself some more

Put my head under the bar and she made me wanna call
Reachin' in my pocket, and pulled out my gun
Shot her pimp in the head, motherfuckah fell dead
But now she's in jail with a ten year bail

Saturday Night,Saturday Night - The Album,UnKnown,"It was Saturday night and I was feeling kinda sporty
Went to the bar copped me a 40
Got kinda high and uh kinda drunk
So I kicked the ass of this little punk
Forgot my key and had to ring my bell
My momma came down, she said, ""Who the hell?""
Wait momma, wait, it's me your little son
Before I knew it my mom pulled a gun
""I know who you are, but who the hell is that?""
I turned around man, this bitch was fat
I really don't know how she got into the car
I must have picked her up when I left the bar
You know I'm horny homie man I wanted to chill
But you know how mothers are, she wanted to ill
So I said, ""Hey baby is you on the pill?
'Cause, tonight I wanna be your lover
Just one thing, I forgot to buy a rubber""
Wait a little while then we snuck upstairs
Step by step with a hint of fear
We got into my room, bitch started to scream
Momma busted in what a fucked up scene
Shirt ripped off, drawers down to my knees
Wait momma, wait momma, wait, wait, please
Put back your gun, put down your broom
My mom fucked up the room
The bitch jumped up with no respect
I had to put the big, big bitch in check
I said, ""You come a little closer and you will get shot""
""I'm sober anyway, I don't need no cock""

Oh yeah
Them wild Saturday nights man, you know what I mean?
They wild and shit man, they wild man
You know
Yeah man let me tell you about another Saturday night experience I had

It was Saturday night and I was feeling kinda funny
Gold around my neck, pockets full of money
Went to the corner, man and who did I see?
But this super bad bitch looking back at me
I said, ""Fly lady man, you got a big butt""
This bitch turned around, all she said was, ""What?""
I said, ""My name is Schoolly baby, uh what is yours?""
Before I knew it up come my boys
Noisy as hell and drunk as shit
Saying, ""Yo Schoolly School, what time is it?""
Looked a little closer and I knew it was a gag
What I thought was a girl was nothing but a fag

Aw man, you know what I mean
You know what I mean
Wild Saturday Nights man
You know I got something else to say man
I got something to say everybody
It’s like this

Everybody rapping but they don't know how
Shoulda seen the boy rapping to the cow
He rapped so hard that the nigga saw smoke
He lit up his cheeba and they both took a toke
The cow got high and the boy got by
Don't come in my face and ask me why
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah it's that cheeba cheeba making 'em feel like that
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Some call it Cheeba, some call it weed
It's the killer, it's the thriller, it's the thing that you need
Said Cheeba Cheeba y’all
Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet
Smoking a J and scratching the itch
Along came a spider and sat down beside her
And said, ""Yo, what's up with that, bitch?""
But then down the road came Mary and her lambs
Smoking a Lacy in each and every hand
The poor little spider, he couldn't score any
They was two dollar bitches and he only had a penny
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Let me tell you a little tale about Peter the Pimp
Sucker MC, trying to cop a limp
Rode around town in a couple of cars
Got gagged by the man trying to stick up a bar
The judge said, ""Boy, what was on your mind?""
He said, ""I had some Cheeba Cheeba, cocaine and some wine.""
The judge said, ""Boy, relax and have a beer
You won't be doing shit for the next ten years.""
Cheeba Cheeba ya’ll
Yeah, it’s that Cheeba Cheeba
Cheeba Cheeba y’all
Some call it Cheeba, some call it weed
It’s the killer, it’s the thriller, it’s the thing that you need
Cheeba Cheeba ya’ll

Yeah, you know
Me and my man Code Money
My man M&M
We just chilling, you know what I mean
My name happens to be Schoolly D, if you didn’t guess by now

He laughed so hard he wanted to die
I said you suckin dick, she jumped inside
Took the girl for a ride out in the park

Get in the back and get your knees dirty

Get back and say something funny

Way, way down, in the ghetto Tee
The badass pimp stepped on the signifying rapper's feet
And the rapper said, Nigga can't you see
You're standin on my motherfucking feet?
The badass pimp said, Sure I ain't heard a cocksucking word you said
You say some more, I'll be standin on your motherfucking head
Yeah that's what he said
Cause every day, when the sun go down
The badass pimp come and kick that rappers ass all over ghetto town
But the rapper got wise, started using his wit
And said man, I'm gettin tired of this kick-ass shit
So early, early early the very next day
The rapper said, mister pimp, mister pimp I got something to say
There's this mean, big bad faggot comin your way
He talk about you so bad, turn my hair gray

And your other brother, he's a faggot
And your little sister Loo
She's so low she sucked the dick of a little maggot

The badass pimp was mad
Jumped up in a hell of a rage
Hopped in his Caddy and loaded his 12 guage
Caught up with the faggot on 55th and Vine
Said you faggot, it's gonna be your ass or mine
The faggot looked at the pimp, and saw fear in his eyes
Said motherfucker, you better go fuck with somebody your own damn size
The pimp made his move, and thought he was fast
The faggot side-stepped him and kicked him in his ass
They fought all that night, and all the next day
That faggot kicked that pimp's ass in a hell of a way
Me myself I don't know how he survived
Came back to the projects more dead than alive
And the rapper, standin up on one of those tall ass project buildings
He said, DAMN somethin smells
He said, mister badass pimp look live you've been through hell
As I told one of my hoes before you left

Got an office downtown, with secretary brown

Joe had this girl, Sally the hoe

Joe had to say no; they was too damn po'
Sally kinda callied, dillied and a-dallied

Picked her up off the floor, threw her out the door
Said ""Now bitch, come back no more""

I Don’t Like Rock And Roll,Schoolly D,1984,"(Intro)
Yo yo, man, whassup, man?
Whassup man, this ain't Prince? this ain't Prince?
It's Schoolly D., man, we rap!
Code Money man, say whassup man?

Rock and roll living is a thing of the past
And all you long haired faggots can kiss my ass
Started out rhymin' with DJ Lynn
You fucked it all up when you let Michael in
I'd rather be a gay and down at the dock
Then with some long haired tutti frutti running amuck
Because rock and roll is all illusion
Comes to no basic conclusion
Rap like jazz is not all fusion
DJ, 1200's you know he's using
I don't
I don't
Looking at my Gucci if you looking at yours
Five two Parkside in my tour of force
Hang out all night, keep girls real tight
Sippin' Coqui 900, make me feel all right
Met my main man Ski, looking for a fight
Till I get on the mic, make everything right
Girl in my face, boy giving me static
Sat by my side, 38 automatic
B-boy stance, Filas on my feet
Hang downtown on Market Street
So when the B-boys comin', we're comin' hard
So all you long haired freaks better be on guard
All you rock and roll lovers, we're knocking you out
Because that is what rap's all about
I don't
I don't
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Chillin' one day, I met a girl named Reeba
Took her on the Ave, copped her some cheeba
Got real high as you will know
Thinking to myself I want to rock this ho
Didn't like rock and roll, said she loved rap
So I told her: ""Fly freak, sit upon my lap""
But I went too fast, gave me a slap
But I looked into her face, gave her this rap
When I rock a party, know I'll kill a microphone
You can call me MC, you can call me Al Capone
Came into the party, checked out my bass
But you rock and roll lovers, get a gun in your face
Cause I came into the party with my speakers on
Rock microphones, all night long
Dance to the beat, because you know who's in charge
No other MC's got this kind of song
I don't
I don't
Def and mighty, rap all nighty
Chill out hard with my homeboy Tidy
The beat ain't righty, for you and ladi
We mean you ladi will have to party
Not a rock and roller, but a mic controller
I get bad, watch her and bone her
The bitch ain't stroller, chill right, roll her
You left your girl, but you know I stole her
I don't
I don't
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""

Shockin' everybody, I'm a hell of a man
Rockin' everybody, walkin' down the street
Shockin' everybody, 'cause it sounds so neat
First name's Schoolly, and my last name's D
Got all the fly people hangin' at my feet
Sucka ass niggas, in the place

Rockin' everybody, 'cause I know that I can
Shockin' everybody, I'm a hell of a man
Rockin' by my side, is MC Pimp

Chillin' in the back with a B-Boy stance

Sucka ass niggas, your time is through
Sittin' one day, out and chillin' a while
Watchin' re-runs of Gilligan's Isle
Just one thing I'd like to know
Is that bitch Ginger a hoe
Saw her beach, so far out, shit
Suckin' off the vessel's dick
Did she got with Mr. Howell
Got with the Skipper for a long long while
If there is no circumstance
My DJ will make you dance
Call him Code or call him Lance

Stop illin', while i'm chillin'
Came here tonight to do some MC killin'
Rhymes so def, they reach the ceilin'
I know you're gettin high, but i'm not drug dealin'
The beat from the drum machine you're feelin'
I know you're gettin' ready, waitin' and illin'
Just wait a little longer 'cause i'm still chill chillin'
If there is no circumstance
My DJ will make you dance
Call him Code or call him lance
But i'm in the back with the B-Boy stance

2-1, 2-1, 2-1, 2
Sucka ass niggas, your time is through
The only reason why, you on my tip
Is because I make a lot of money, you dollar bitch
I need a fly girl that's so so pretty
Chillin' out hard in the big big city
Don't smoke no cheeba, don't do no coke
Don't need a fly girl strung out on dope
What I need is a fly girl full of romance
Your more favorite doll ,nothin' but a chance
Why my DJ make you dance
I'm in the back in the B-Boy stance",https://genius.com/Schoolly-d-free-style-rapping-lyrics

Went downtown jump the train
12 o’clock in New York
No cab, had to walk
Downtown Latin Quarter
Got inside drunk some water
Stepped on stage started to talk
Said yo yo what up New York
Danced all around act so silly
Homie in the crowd said must be from Philly
Code was cuttin’ I was grabbing my dick
Thought to my self I'm tired as shit
Jump off stage ran outside
Grab Code Money jumped a ride
Turn left no homie turn right
Straight back to the after midnight
Got to the place people was cheering
Girls threw panties that they was wearing
Fellas in the back they was leering
My fat gold chain they was staring
I wasn't caring you faggots
I ain't fearing
Calm down cool and chill
Crack another forty smoke some kill
Woke up early Sunday morn
Jump out of bed Fila's on
Thought about the hangover
Kissed the dog called my mom Rover
Went to the kitchen Cap’n Crunch
Turn on the tube the Brady Bunch
Instead of a house they live in a palace
Jan was fucking Mike and Mike was fucking Alice
My little eyes opened up wide
The thing in my pants started to rise
Sat down on the couch to cool and chill
Crack me a forty roll some kill
I was smoking I was toking
My mom said boy you must be joking
Threw me outside it was raining I was soaking
That weed so damn provoking
Yeah!! So I crack another forty
Smoke some kill

You don't dig what I'm sayin, then fuck you
Cause sellin drugs only job that a nigga got
Sellin caine to the kids in the parkin lot
Some niggas live, some niggas gotta get dropped
You say 'damn' - my man, you don't understand
How could you be so cold to a brotherman?
Don't come around here teachin and preachin
Because a nigga like me you ain't reachin
Cause all I care about is sellin my yayo
Makin money like a nigga make mayo
Toke on weed, sippin on my Olde E
All the crackheads all on my wee-wee
Rollin hard in a rag-top Volvo
911 on my ass, I'mma roll on
You don't understand where a brother comin from
That's why young black men always on the run
You either gangbang, or you get hanged
Kill another nigga, it ain't no thang
(Gangster Boogie)

Pull a 8 on a nigga, say 'fuck you'
Then pull away in my BMW
Cause on the street you gotta be a little meaner
But that's how my pockets get greener
Runnin shit, gotta be a little candid
Some time you be a little a bandit
Sellin dope out of my crackhouse
You either kick game, or you get gamed
(You don't know the pain)
(Kick that shit)

Yo muthafucka, it's time to get rolled on
Strolled on, you better get a hold on
How the fuck you expect me to get back
If I never had to pull on my git-gat?
Because to me it ain't nothin but a killin
That's how a nigga be feelin
I call a homie on the mobile (dialing)
What up, my nigga, it's about that time
Grab the Uzi, the eight and the nine
When a nigga be rollin on the ave
Sometime it gonna be a blood bath
But when I'm comin, no playin, no jokin
I let the Uzi and nine be smokin
Alright now, back to my tale, yo
Spot the nigga on the corner sellin yayo
Pull up, ""Yo, what up, gee?""
He didn't see my nigga in the backseat
All I heard was ""Please don't shoot!""
(shots) grabbed the caine and the loot
(It's like that, and that's the way it is)
(So damn) (tough)
Now a nigga on the top of the world, see
I got the women, the dope and the jewelry
I'm livin large in a fat-ass crib
Don't give a damn about the shit I just did
Then I heard a knock-knock at my door
Said ""Oh shit!"" - I hit the floor
One of my homies on the ave was a big snitch
I said ""Oh shit!"" - jumped through the window

Fuck it, some nigga was dyin

Her mama mad cause she gave up
Took her to church every week, it couldn't save her
I got a daughter and a son
Before he say daddy, little nigga might say gun
I sit back, I blow a kiss to my mother
Even though she old, the nigga still love her
But I never knew my daddy
Nah, all I knew was some nigga in a Caddy
Stopped by every year by Christmas
Talkin that bullshit he missed us
I don't look like my granny or my mammy
I look like a muthafucka named Sammy
My mother musta been a young slut
Always talkin about the days when she had a big fat butt
You gotta do what you gotta do what you gotta do
Yo, I drink a brew
I sit back and start thinkin
Damn, should a nigga be smokin and drinkin?


Wake up in the morning 'bout a quarter after six
Nikes on my feet, Jimmy hat on my dick
Sis on the corner, tryin to sling rock

My destination I crusade, don't question what I'm doin
To keep the brothers hype and leave the suckers boo-hooin
To sway away the sayers that's frontin on what I'm sayin
Or trippin, even flippin and knowin I ain't playin
And playin, yeah buddy, that's the word
Describin all the games bein played in the rock world
I would like to do it, liked to tell you, my man
But we're in America, I might get banned

A super star who you now gaze
So understand i'm just a man, who paid his dues now you're my fan

You're acting like school you motherfucking fool
I ain't looking rougher and you are still a tool

Blast some Afro-Sheen and I combed my head
Spread some Ultrabrite and I brushed my teeth
Grabbed some Perry Ellis and I washed my feet
Slipped down the banister like I was insane
Grabbed my Gucci watch and my fly gold chain
Opened up the door and I ran outside
Laced me some cheeba, jumped into my ride
Drove to the corner, I see my homeboy Lynn
Cruisin' 'round the corner to the Parkside Inn
Jumped out the car, ran into the bar
'Bout 6 or 7 steps because it wasn't too far
Got inside, copped a 40 of brew
""Yo, Schoolly-School man what you gonna do?""
Looked all around, met me a girlie
A big fat booty and a fly Jheri-curli
Asked her could she do me and she said it's too early

I'm on your back, got you runnin like a rabbit
I'm in your veins like a cocaine habit
And let you know that I'm never gonna stop
Until a sucker get dropped

Do, and everything that I wanna

And everything that I do is illegal
Another brother, but the brother was an eagle
Run, run, run, run, run, you better run fast

Alright sucker, you want the real deal?
Here it is, at the tip of the cold steel
Shoot a punk and a shoe-shine nigga
Shoot em all what Schoolly D figure
Line em up, put your finger on the trigger
Sit back and take a little swigger
And let a rhyme intoxicate your mind
Like a cheeba and a forty of wine

Gotta sell a little lleyo
Because a brother didn't have enough knowledge
Didn't know because he didn't go to college
I'm gettin tired of the suckers on my back
Because I'm black, hard with a dope rap

Jump fast out the startin block

Gunshots on the neighborhood
Are the sounds of brothers hard up to no good
Feel the pain of a bullet wound
For suckers tryin to slip and trip, time to meet their doom
Like the sounds of a battle cry
Either run, soft sucker, or get caught, do or die
Flee, it's the reality
Cause I see another weak comp, it's so violent, see
Brothers dyin over property
Dope, money, women and ki's
So now the time is at hand
You can sit down, be a punk or be a man

Your Worst Nightmare,How a Blackman Feels,1991.0,"Yo man
Yo man, what's up?
What's your worst nightmare?
Is this it?
Yo hus, I like the Eight Ball jacket
Yeah yo, it's dope, give it up, sucker
Nah man... nah man
(Gunshots)
Your worst nightmare is a young gangbanger (3X)
(Funkyeeee... yeah)
I said peace to a brother and then I shot him
I pulled away, I know that I got him
Then I rolled up the cheeba-cheeba
That's all a brother like me really needed
Why I did it, or really why I done it?
I don't know why, but the game, I run it
Thinkin way back how the story was told
Gettin (funkeeee) when I was 12 years old
I didn't give a damn about tyin no thether
All I needed was the nine millimeter
All my homies has been some thugs
To make a little money we sold a little drugs
PSK, just makin that big green
A rough brother at the age of 16
But nowadays I'm a dope rap singer
Your worst nightmare is a young gangbanger
(Funkyeeee... yeah)
Your worst nightmare is a young gangbanger (4X)
A shoe-shine nigga I never will be
When you gonna ever let a brother be free?
What up with that (funkeeee) that I see
When I turn on my TV?
Cause if you think a young brother really care
About a brother livin in Bel Air
Hell no, I'm straight from the ghetto
Smoke a little weed just to stay a little mellow
A Asiatic blackman, you understand
Because I'm rich you think that I'm a dopeman
I hear your laughter everytime that I say that
But you won't laugh when I pull on the git-gat
You rather see me pickin yo cotton
Than a young blackman clickin and clockin
G's, cause I'm a dope rap singer
Your worst nightmare a young gangbanger

Your worst nightmare is a young gangbanger (4X)

(Hey yeah)

Listen up, hard teachin go down from the wild side
School didn't do it, so what, gotta try
Crime - in this game yourself that's all you got
If you're soft, hard, the most times end up smooth shot
So now you're deep, you're down
Clear the line one time to trip and slip
And when you slip you're slidin right to a grave
You shoulda learned at school cause the drugs made you a slave

Turn up the microphone in my hand

You came to the party, see the look on your face
I'm standing on stage and I'm in your place
You say I tried to diss you and I stole your style
But the days you was rockin' I still a little child
What's up man, stop frontin'
What is, is; what ain't, ain't nuttin'
I'm rockin' to the break of dawn baby
Standing on stage might go a little crazy
Me and Cold Money just housing the joint

One, two, three, hit me!
Thank you, for lettin' me, be myself again 
Thank you, for lettin' me, be myself again

Way down on the ave, jumped into the ride
 need, you come inside
Walked through the door, dance on the floor
Five-two in the place it's gonna be war
Standin' on stage and ya beg for more
Gonna do all the things that you do adore
Gonna rap on the mic 'til my throat is sore
My man Cold Money got guts galore
Two years ago he wasn't

Suckers in the back you know that I'm slayin'
No racism, it's just rhythm
People only dance to just what you give them
What I'm given, I am driven
To make you dance or make you listen
So girl don't give me respect
Because I got a gold chain around my neck
I'm not a toy, don't call me boy
You're in my way, you will be destroyed
I'm rockin' to the break of dawn baby

I don't like rock N roll I never did
Didn't even like when I was a little kid
You's a longhaired freak
Seven days a week
Making money in leather
I make money in sneaks

Rather hear rap cause rock is handling

Rising to the top boy, while you are sinking
No brain subject, what are you thinking?
Thinking real hard and you can be like school
And make a lot of money and be real cool
I can make some rap records and make a lot of fans
People come around and shake my hand
But you can't, you won't, you're nothing but a punk

Sitting in the lincoln stinking, thinking

About the five two groups, so proud, so bold
Five MC's with mics in their hands
Rhyming disco lyn and glourious gram

Bringing bitch motherfuckers down to their knees

America was raised on the blood of the black slave

Talking about where you're going and where you're from

You're living in the street like a motherfucking animal
Because you're black they think it's understandable
Can't you see america is sick
I'll pull a gat on your ass real quickly
So don't you think that i'll ever be hesitant
To pull a gat on the motherfucking president
I wanna get him, lynch him up like a nigga

Microphone living is a thing of the past
And all you long haired faggots can kiss my ass
Started out rhymin' with DJ Lynn
You fucked it all up when you let Michael in
I'd rather be a day in land of the dog
Then with some long haired tutti frutti running a mock
Because rock and roll is all illusion
Comes to no basic conclusion
Rap like jazz is not all fusion
DJ, 1200's you know he's using
I don't
I don't
Looking at my Gucci if you looking at yours
Five two point size in my court of force
Hang out all night, keep girls real tight
Sippin' coqui 900, make me feel allright
Met my main man Ski, looking for a bike
Till I get on the mic, make everything right
Girl in my face, boy giving me static
Sat by my side, 38 automatic
B-boy stands, she lies on a beat
Hang downtown on a market street
So when the B-boys comin', we're comin' hard
So all you long haired freaks better be on guard
All you rock and roll lovers, we're knocking you out
Because that is what rap's all about
I don't

Took her on the Ave, conquered some cheever
Got real high as you will know
Thinking to myself while I rocked her so
Didn't like microphone, said she loved rap
So I told her: ""Fly freak, sit upon my lap""
But I went too fast, gave me a slap
But I looked into her face, gave her this rap
When I rock a party, there is still a microphone
You can call me MC, you can call me on the phone
Came into the party, checked out my face
But you rock and roll lovers, get a girl in your face
Cause I came into the party with my sneakers on
Right microphones, all night long
Dance to the beat, because you know who's in charge
No other MC's got this kind of song
I don't
I don't
Def been mighty, rap all nighty
Chill out hard with my homeboy Tidy
The beat ain't righty, for you and ladi
We mean you ladi will have to party
Not a rock and roller, but a mic controller
I get bad, watch her and bone her
The bitch ain't stroller, chill right, roll her
You left your girl, but you know I stole her
I don't
I don't
