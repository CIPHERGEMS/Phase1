Photosynthesis,Bucket List Project,2016.0,"Got it, I got it, oh
Say what you're looking for, 'cause I got it, yeah, ayy
I got it, I got it, oh
I got it, yeah

Oh yes I made it alive, Lake Shore Drive, headed to paradise
In this moment of mine, I can't recognize
Or see that the glare is bright
And what you compromise, I almost died
I doubt the water is red as mine

Ayy, how you lonely in a room with God?
Never slow up, not even a pit stop
Praying my niggas'll never get caught
Overcame it all, like I'm some big shot
Was taught to be a man, up to the wrist watch
To the collar shirt tucked, with the front pocket
Part of adolescence when they go blossom
When your stars align, I hope there's no comet
So far it's...
Oh yes, I made it alive, on the West Side
Still at my momma house
The kids on my conscience now
'Cause the youth dying and it's just more common now
Common ground, stuck through it all like we Carmelo
Comin' down, high off of life, arrive unannounced
Summonin', numbin' the pain of when I'm in doubt, 
high school
My head in the clouds, like I learned about

Oh yes I made it alive, Lake Shore Drive, headed to paradise
In this moment of mine, I can't recognize
Or see that the glare is bright
And what you compromise, I almost die
I doubt the water is red as mine

What are you looking for?
I got it (I got it)
I got it (I got it)
All the things you adore
I got it (I got it)
I got it (I got it)

Runnin' through my city like a tour bus
Hopin' one day I can have a tour bus
I can see the planets from my window sill
And I tend to tell what is honest
I don't wanna fight no one, no contest
I just wanna undress my conscience
I just met a killer that's bent in his ways
Try to raise a family with minimum wage, what can I say?
Besides the demons, it's reality for the people that we love
And we are the ones that will team up and tee up the party
Dead end the school, bet that they'll show up real tardy
The audience awfully ready and rowdy
I meant it if I said it, you get in writing
Got into a science, but write with the lightning
Like soil, I'm grounded, the seed has just sprouted

Oh yes I made it alive, Lake Shore Drive, headed to paradise
In this moment of mine, I can't recognize
Or see that the glare is bright
And what you compromise, I almost die
I doubt the water is red as mine

What are you looking for?
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
All, the things you adore
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
Show what you want, show what you want
Show what you want, show what you want

I just wanna be the plug so my people can eat
I just wanna play soccer on rooftops in Tokyo
I just wanna find somewhere I don't gotta put a face on for people no mo'

BUSY / SIRENS,CARE FOR ME,2018.0,"I'm so alone, but all of my friends
But all of my friends got some shit to do
Yeah, all 'em got plans
I call 'em, I'm bad at texting
They never cross me like bad pedestrians
I've been this awkward since adolescence
I don't know how long I had depression
Never no peer-pressure
I'm tryna' get my little pecker off in some girl
I call my BFF, that ain't no secret kept
I fucked then told my cousin
I'm broke, I wasn't buzzin'
I tried to hit a few years, she wasn't budgin'
I'm bogus, left my girl for some shawty
Surely deservin' of all this lonely
""You sad? Tell me, how are you sad?
You got all of these friends, you got all of these fans""
I ain't trust nobody new since 2012, I ain't let nobody in
Jesus got killed for our sins, Walter got killed for a coat
I'm tryna cope, but it's a part of me gone
In this packed room I'm alone

I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
Ohhh, ohhh

I'm so alone, just me and my girl
She leave me for work, then leave me for school
She finally home, I leave her for tour
FaceTime me nudity, yeah, all of this new to me, yeah
All of the infidelity when I was 17 been catchin' up
It still feel like she'll catch me cheatin'
Niggas askin' me how tour was
Knowin' I been home like two months
And I seen your ass like two times
Save the small-talk like two dimes
No time, social interaction
Had female friends I found attractive
I tried to fuck but I am no savage
Now we don't speak, we just walk past
If my past could talk
It'd probably reply to the missed calls after all
Cause the friendships that I can't recall
Done turned my heart into camouflage
While the guys I used to play basketball with
Doin' shit that I can't endorse now
With the Lord now, when it pours down
Was alone then, still alone now

I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
Ohhh, ohhh


I'm barely here, how I ain't present?
Yeah, I drift for a second, forgot to reply to your message
But all these years
I been the same in your presence (I'm still here)
Countin' the seconds before I reply to your message
My biggest fear (is that I have to say goodbye another time)
Is that I have to say goodbye another time
(Not like this, not like this, not like this)
So I skip town on our moment, hopefully prolonging this
I don't need nobody new to miss (not like this)
I want you to know

Ridin' through the city
I'm young, I'm black, I'm guilty
I know one time wanna kill me
They don't know me but they fear me
15 years old with the sticky
They gon' blame it on the marijuana
Hands behind your head
And they won't let up out they lead
But if I move thats disrespect
But if they shoot then that's just that?
And if I run then that look bad?
Drawing they gun right off their hip
I'm probably deservin'
'Cause I know they serve and protect
But they think I'm servin'
Or they think my cellphone's a weapon
Heard that the robber wore a black mask
I fit the description, a.k.a. ""nigga""
What is the difference? It's an enigma
We so divided, I'm from Division
Clutch that purse cause of my dreadlocks
Cross that street cause I'm with my friends
Curse every song in hip-hop
Keep telling yourself it's all fair

PROM / KING,CARE FOR ME,2018.0,"This remind me of before we had insomnia
Sleepin' peacefully, never needed a pile of drugs
Everybody was college-bound, no dollar amounts
In God we trust, senior year my prom ain't had no party bus
My cousin hit me on Facebook like, ""What shorty you takin'?""
I'm lyin', I'm playin', I'm sayin', ""I got one to take""
And I'm waitin' on her response, wrote her a three-page letter
It's three days later, never hit me back, she broke my heart
So now he IM'ing me shit like, ""Yo, is shorty bad?""
I pretend not to be depressed, she never wrote me back
I hit him back like ""Yo, well fuck her, it's on to the next""
I wrote that message thinkin' I'm awkward, prolly never have sex
You know in high school, 16, you prolly late
My cousin hit me back, ""Don't trip, bro, I got you a date""
So he sent me this link to some girl I had never seen
He said to call and tell her ""Walter sent you, you with me""
I think about it for a minute like what's his intentions?
I mean we never really got along or used to kick it
In fact if I remember vividly, he picked on me
He used to beat me up and take my sneakers every family visit
I'm skeptical to let her know I'm Walter' little cousin
What if this shit all a joke? Then again, what if it wasn't?
Would I really risk the chance of me potentially fucking
On some stranger daughter 'cause I barely know if I can trust him?
Prolly not
I finally called her, tell her ""Walter sent me, my name Tahj""
She asked me what's the color scheme that we gon' wear to prom
I'm actin' like I'm not excited, tryna play it off
""So what's the car we're takin'?"" Worst come worst, her mom can take us
I'll call Walt to thank him, he said ""Don't trip and just wear black""
He said she cool and they go back, if any problems, hit him back
I never had to, but now, we in tune
He Facebook messaged me like, ""Sorry, not to be a nuisance""
But he like 30 dollars short on all his prom suit shit
I'm like, ""I got you, cuz, that's the least that I could do""
He tell me send him the addy and he'll slide after school
I'm like, ""Okay, bet,"" never knew where he stayed at
He walked down the street hella surprised
""This where y'all place at?
Uncle Carl, Auntie Deborah, my cousin Rena?""
And I'm surprised too, my family knew, kept this a secret
Me and cuz stay down the street, living different lives
Every day he on the bus, me, I get a ride
I gave him 30 on the porch, he never went inside
He tells me, ""Thank you,"" then he walked back home with a smile
He tryna hide it but I see his dimple
I'm thinkin', ""Damn, that transaction was simple""
I'm talking shit, I know he hoop, I'm like, ""Ay, where the rim, bro?""
He like, ""Tomorrow if you free, you prolly weak as shit though""
I know my brother not
So all three of us went to the park and ran some niggas off the court
I'm hella passive, I was passin', I ain't have to score
The next day the prom, I couldn't sleep, I stayed up
My granddad gave me a condom then walked away, didn't say nun'
She hopped out of her car and said that her name was Jada
My heart's racin', I'm focused, I'm tryna keep it playa
Gave her the croissant or corsage or whatever the fuck
My mom handed me, and said, ""Now put it on her hand, Malik""
Family ties, my grandfather taught me how to tie up a tie
'Cause my dad lived in NY
That's prolly why I was shy, so self-conscious
Took pictures on the porch and then we headed for the prom and
Walter went on prom the same day, but to a different place
So he text me like, ""Cuz, this the spot, let's meet up later
And bring Jada through,"" prom flashed, I kept it cool
We show up to the function where she brought a change of clothes
I'm lookin' around like, ""Damn, I don't know nobody""
We at this party out west, and Jada left to get dressed
I fake like I'm sendin' text, some stranger get really close
I swear that I hear his breath then he put a knife to my neck
Gave me the run down like, ""Jada my sister
And if you hit her, fuck her, make her miss ya, I'ma kill ya""
At this point, I'm just exhausted wonderin' where the fuck's Walter
He shows up like 30 minutes after our altercation
I never mentioned it to him, he kinda overprotective
And I know if I tell him, that he'll beat this nigga's skull in
Turn his body a skeleton, and our night'll end terrible
I exhale and say, ""Fuck it"", and I just chose to let it go


Fuck with you boy
Said you're used to getting everything your way
This not how that happens this time
She tryna fuck with you boy

Walt went to St. Louis, had a full ride for his hoopin'
Him and his coach got into it, now he back home doin' music, ayy
I was at Columbia, a damn-near straight-A student
I had one B in a hip-hop class, I thought that shit was stupid
He transferred to Robert Morris, always living down the street
My class let out at 2:40 and his class let out at 3:00
Mama asked me where the hell I been at, where the hell I be
""I'm with Walter, mom, I'm safe,"" I keep walkin' in here late
I might fall off in your bae, I get girls now, I get laid
I get caught up, I blame Walter, I'm a product of my age
He talk to every girl downtown Chicago, wingman, I cannot fly though
He was in Cal white Impala, he was that nigga in the party
Awfully popular for someone that they barely mention
Plus we from the part of city that they barely mention
Just logged into Twitter and somehow we was barely mentioned
We signed our names on the open mic list and then they skipped us
And then they skipped us again like a week later
Like, obviously, this fuckin' host can't read the paper
Hella intimidatin', a big guy, didn't have to flex
So Walter walked to the host and said, ""This the name you callin' next""
Bullied our way to the stage and then overstayed our welcome
An apple never get too far from the tree that it fell from
Just like my father, tryna do music and hope I make it
Walter joined me for the journey said the city waitin'
PIVOT

Walter invincible, dodged death like a mad magician
More times than a mathematician
I'm in L.A. working on Bucket List Project
I get a call and get a fishy feeling
Normally, Walt joke on the phone, this time he over-serious
My heart dropped and I'm like, ""Yo, what is it?""
He say he with T-Y on the highway and some niggas just tried to kill him
Emptied the clip on the car but somehow they didn't hit him
Sometimes, I fucking hate Chicago 'cause I hate this feeling
Innocent niggas get shot at in the broad day, the A.M.
I asked him for a play-by-play of how their whole day went
He say he went to XSport and they ran a full court
And I cannot retort without thinking that this can't be the reason
""So what else you do? What about Ty? Is he still cool?
Where you on your way from and where you on your way to?""
He say he just left a dinner at a friend crib and that's it
He say, ""Ty don't do shit but smoke, honestly, Saba, that's it""
Give him sympathy, another case of mistaken identity
The news prolly gon' run this as two gangs from different streets
Police questioning him like he just shot at a trooper
My boy walked away unharmed and we did Lollapalooza, yeah
Six months pass by, every day we celebrate, every day a better day
I just dropped Bucket List, Walt about to drop a tape
Everything goin' perfect, couldn't paint a better way
PIVOT Gang is on the way
We just sold out Lincoln Hall, then I went to talk to Sway
I got back home and got back on it
'Cause Walt was doing two-a-days
Sendin' me links to songs that he made
Kid Cudi, we are not riding no waves, ayy
Grandma made his plate, we played 2K, that's just a day before
Fatimah got a show tomorrow, he text me, ""Ay, we in that hoe""
I went to the barbershop the first thing the next morning
Then I got up with LEGIT, we supposed to do some recording
Ten minutes into the session, I got a call from a number
That I don't got saved, but I answer anyways
She says, ""Hello, Malik, have you or Squeak
Talked to my son today? He was just on the train""
We got in the car but we didn't know where to drive to
Fuck it, wherever you are, my nigga, we'll come and find you...

Just another day in the ghetto
Oh, the streets bring sorrow
Can't get up today with their schedule
I just hope I make it 'til tomorrow
I just hope I make it 'til tomorrow
I just hope I make it 'til tomorrow
I just hope I make it 'til tomorrow",https://genius.com/Saba-prom-king-lyrics

I know 'Pac was 25, I know Jesus 33

They want a barcode on my wrist (barcode on my wrist)
To auction off the kids
That don't fit their description of a utopia (black)

Tell me it'll be okay, tell me happier days
Tell me that she my bae, that I won't be alone
Tell 'em I'll be okay when he ask, ""How's my day?""
Tell 'em that we the same, tell em' that we not safe

I got my grandaddy soul, I'm at war, that's on my mind
I seen Walter body cold, wish I could switch it with mine
I'm not worried 'bout no rap shit, distractions or waste-of-times
I still go to social functions even though I'm so anti—
No, I'm no Rihanna, the court gonna throw it like Donovan
Down a bit, I just been modelin' my whole career
As if 'Pac was here, studio monitors shakin'
I raise the apartments, I'm Bono with profit
I made what I made in allotted
Amount of time, the same amount of time you was watchin'
So stop comparing me to people; no, I am not them
A lot of people dream until they shit'll get—*gunshot*

Really she usin' me, but it's cool, we use each other
I'm in love with contemplatin' 'bout the pressure
Conversations 'bout depression
Confrontation cause we care too much about each other
We know it ain't permanent but temporary
Releasin' your Issa Rae, insecure
Collect them like Pikachu, Venusaur
We go 'til you done or my penis sore
Sleep with the TV on then we don't speak no more

I still'll keep in my back pocket

I wanted you more since I found out you heartless
Harborin' feelins' for niggas who hurt you
Know you on the surface but not on a personal level
I play the game of hearts, missin' piece, we ain't a part
Depend on me until I'm bored
I return your heart as quick I return your call
Tables turn quicker cause after a weekend I miss ya
I don't want you but I'm conflicted
I know that back and forth yo-yo shit over with
But you gon' take me back, I'm gon' convince ya
Pain ain't never looked so temptin'
Lonely never looked so distant, we just gon' ignore the tension
You know we both not shit, I know that shit toxic

Hear her speak, see her weep, made me feel big
Cry on me, she down me, treat me like shit
Second time, round two, what I learned
She wasn't mine, that wasn't love, I wasn't hers
I'm not hurt, anymore, took some time
Found a girl, now I'm hers, and she mine
And she make, me feel whole, heal me
And it's, mutual, and we still in love

Yeah, interview, interview, interview, cut
Someone just bled out because they got (Cut!)

No, I ain't leave in vain, but I know we with God

FIGHTER,CARE FOR ME,2018.0,"Me and E-Guy just fought 'cause his family wouldn't stop talkin'
We neighbors who argued often, I run, I jog to him
Toss a jab and I caught him, he threw a left, ain't connect
'Cause I ducked when I came back up, I seen his sister talkin' trash
Like, ""Touch my brother, I'm beatin' yo' ass""
(""Touch my brother, I'm beatin' yo' ass, nigga!"")
So I fucked her brother up to see what she about, yeah
Walked away and then we noticed that his teeth was out, yeah
She ain't do shit, she just mad we got to see her pout
So me and Cell, we just fought, I was walkin' and then he jawed me
I dropped to the floor while calling for help in front of my grandmother's house
The next hit, he punched me my mouth, I can't believe I'm on the ground
'Cause I tried to hit him, I gambled, I'm ugly cryin' in public
I'm like, ""When I get you back, you gon' wish that you never touched me""
Somehow I never could touch him, our brothers broke the shit up
And I walked the rest of the day with my head down
Funny how gettin' your ass beat'll spread 'round, yeah

But I don't wanna fight no more
'Cause I'm not a fighter, I won't no more
But I don't wanna fight no more
'Cause I'm not a fighter, I won't no more

So me and E-Guy, we scrap again
Jacob jumped in, I'm handicapped
Manny watched from across the street
Then he ran up and hopped on me
Three on one, they teamin' up but me, I never think to run
They circling around
Got me surrounded like police or somethin' (Woop-woop!)
So it's bad enough they already jumpin' me
Then I see Cell comin', I'm prayin', ""Please don't fuck with me""
(""Please leave me the fuck alone"")
It's not fair and I think he agree
So instead of fighting with them, he came and teamed up with me
Me and Grandpa ain't talked since I stopped attendin' the college
He called me, said I'm a scholar, I should be gettin' my doctorate
""Or, shit, at least in the army, instead you chose to hip-hopper
I know how this is gon' end 'cause I went through this with yo' father""
Me and my girl just fought 'cause I talked before she could talk
She was tellin' a story, I cut her off with some shit
Not 'bout the same topic, so she just stopped in the middle
Before the plot hit, the rest of the car ride silent
Like ""You always do this,"" like, ""You don't value my thoughts
Either that or you too damn stupid to realize
That if you don't hear me out then I'ma feel muted
You say that you care, well show it, I'm not askin' a lot
I know you think you listenin' but you just waitin' to talk""
My fault

But I don't wanna fight no more
'Cause I'm not a fighter, I won't no more
But I don't wanna fight no more
'Cause I'm not a fighter, I won't no more

It's harder to love myself when all these people compliment me
Somehow it just remind me what I don't got
But these folks don't care to know
They think you rollin' in the dough
Not realizin' your next meal is a 4-for-$4
Still feeling the guilt that Walt never thought to call
Fightin' myself to get out of bed
I'm fightin' myself to get out of bed
Fightin' myself

I don't wanna fight no more
'Cause I'm not a fighter

Yeah, me and all my niggas dropped out
Then we drove to Texas, slept at Waffle House
Kicked out of the hotel, we all broke
We don't got no mattress, sleep on yo' floor
Me and grandpa ain't spoke since I dropped out
Made sure on my first tour, stop at his house
I sleep on the hotel, not your floor
He tell me that he proud of his boy
I'm not a janitor no more at Homan Square
Saved up for a round trip, LAX
I just learned it's no risk, no reward
I slept on the floor at Port Authority
Me and all my niggas dropped tears
Heart been on the floor for a whole year
We all broke (we all broke)
We all broke",https://genius.com/Saba-fighter-lyrics

Coulda been traffickin'

But I would rather do better than my uncle had it
My head to the sky like a Jesse White backflip
Slept on the palette
Promised my mama I'd turn it to palace
My granny house was right by Wallace’s Catfish
Corner but lo and behold when it's below zero
And you watch your best friend hit the corner, uh
And now I no longer even know him
Used to hoop daily, we thought we was Jordan
He went on to high school but dropped out a junior
I went on to college, he went on a shooter
He went on to juvie, I went out on tour, ayy
Bicycle with the juice in the wheel, if you was a real nigga
We wouldn’t have to hear ya keep proving yourself
'Cause who really cares 'bout
What side or block you're reppin'
Your whereabouts will keep you seperate
All lost some niggas to some weapons
That's why I’m walking like I’m welcome, ayy

Just to pour it on the curb, uh

Shout the kids claiming Chiraq

Ayy, and I'm from the part of the city
That they don't be talkin' about, ayy
I gave the Westside a new meaning
I took it to the Europeans
The police took my nigga freedom
I probably be in there with him
'Cause honestly I think just like all my niggas
And honestly I should’ve reached out to Twista
Like, ""Ayy bro, I got one, I need you on this one""
Austin, Division, ironic that that's the divide
Below the poverty line
My mother was on the Southside
Z-Money told me hit his line
I caught the bus off of Pine
I say my words double time
Knock on wood, I have not ever been robbed
But a few niggas tried on the train
On my way to school a couple times

Westside nigga go cray, yeah, ayyy
Westside nigga go cray
Westside nigga go cray
Westside nigga go cray

Ugh, and I’m from a part of the city
I was sittin' on my front porch when I saw my first titty
Proud to throw the Westside up
When I was five watching Pac dissing Biggie
Whole fit off of Madison
Eatin' Uncle Remus, fuck a Whole Foods
Shorty used to act like Stone Cold
Flipping niggas off crackin' cold brews
Westside prep was my old school
The block was hot like Suzanne Somers
Seen someone that got hit with a shotty
Walk a block while he shitted his body
Cops came started liftin' his body
I went back to watchin' NickToons
Watch your back when it's mid June
You can always be my big spoon
Know you in the hood when you see the poles
With the blue lights
Steady flashin' like cheerleader clothes
I remember letters in the first grade 'cause of GDs and fours
Mama speaking in code tryna get a job at the store
Never gonna get it like En Vogue
All my Westside niggas go

On my bucket list, I want ten million dollars in my bank account
And I want to fuck ten bitches at the same time

The police pullin' a pulley, you'll fall for it you silly
Putty you outta shape, fuck runnin', you'll catch a case

It's rarity in my realness, yeah I'm a fine, diamond in the rough type
Rough type, 
roughhouse in a roadhouse like rugby
Lovely, when you hit a lick, little kick like Chun-Li
Funny, kids that I hoop with all in county
Counting, black bodies hunt 'em down look like bounties
Bound to, be on the block a little while longer
They your homies, this what home is
What don't kill ya make ya stronger
Call Obama, Jesus, Yeezus
He can save Chicago from the demons
And the deacons when it's the end

my phone line
Forever open for prayer, the fallen soldiers ain't fell
They in my pen,
 
and I do thank God
They say preach like Cooley High
From beginnin' to end, that's Alpha and Omega
My city the same ghost that made Lupe cry
Soon's you loosen up your grip, you lost then lose your life
I loosen a dread from every time
I gotta wash the cigarette smoke from outta my head
Like, ""How I'm not dead?""
Going on 20 soon, they say I changed, that's a fitting room
I'm still the same kid that didn't speak when we were in the school
I just got a mic now, I turned to a real nigga
I just knocked the white down, and fuck who you think I sound like
I'm a legend in the making like the director's cut
Of 
I Am Legend
 and I'm fed up with the fuck comparison
These niggas don't got the truth that y'all want, do they?
Think I'm lying? Then plan a trip to Chicago today
I was 15, they was fucking with me
There's no logic in love, but there's no love in the streets

It's not safe outside when they want your neck

They sold, they sold...

They sold prison the way they pipeline,
 
systematically lifeline
Erase all niggas, they so bulletproof from the law
Law abiding citizen shot, Willie Lynch do crack now
Made the new letters shiny, now we pray King Kunta
I hope the grave don't find me

I do my E&J kindly
I do my time when it's timely
Sometimes, the Bible tastes like marmalade
My momma still sipping
Politician owe Donald Duck a quacking-new kitchen
They kept the melting pot inside the slave plot—watch
They gentrified your neighborhood, no need for cops—watch
Look at the yoga pants, coffee shops and yogurt stands
Consumerism, holy land
And on the other hand, my momma land

It look like funeral home, church, church, liquor store
Corner store, dread-head, deadly—...

Flipped it on em, 
I swanton bombed
And she say that she saw me on prime time
Stock going up draft combine
I don't wanna hear about the bullshit, I could write a full book
How you only keep it real sometimes
Sometimes I wonder what my life would be like if I didn't try
To take my whole life and put it in writing
Put it on wax to play while you drive
I was on the bus with it
Just went to Manhattan on a bus ticket
Y'all still did everything but listen
Now they tryna sign like a petition, submission
How I got the game in a choke hold

Want my albums posthumous, no fraudulent
Gas like flatulence, hoe I feel fabulous
I'm fathering all these styles I hit, then they copy it
You know I ain't worried bout that though (about that though)

Fresh linen, lining flicking like Teanna Trump, damn, ayy
A town stomp Fuck Trump, chunk
St. Lou taught me never front, stunt

Snakes and a python, run with your head cut
Hand on the bible
Stage with the light show, bed with the bedbugs
Check if the mic on
For the check that I sign on, tell me what I'm worth
Sleep when it's bedtime
Gave up the airtime, whole city graveyard

Most of these dudes played varsity ball
Now, most of these dogs in jail or they gone
Yeah, and most of me dogs call most women hoes
While most of the youth play most of the songs

Album got a deadline
Blog with a headline, always ahead line
Dapped in the Alpine
Whole city bedtime, most of us flatline
Most of us die young
Niggas been starvin', all of us diet
Ball with a ballpoint
Lie to the All-Knowing like he not all-knowing

Most of these dude don't wanna be thugs
But most of these news call most of us thugs
And most of these shooters be the boys in the blue
And most of these doors don't open and close

Ay, most these niggas starve for so long, get a plate and
Forget to thank God, they forgot to say grace, hey
Most people, they only want to be seen, hey

Life not some sitcom
Streamin' on Hulu, there's no one to the rescue
No one to defend you
They know that I've been through
What most of 'em been through

Most of the youth in love with a gun
'Cause most of the young don't wanna be young
And most of these dogs don't love anymore

I woke up this morning feeling just like I'm a star
No I don't drink but I might buy the bar
Like shots on me because I ain't get shot
That's on my soul, Diana Ross
I am on my pivot like I am Ross
I am a force to be reckoned
Like a western film, might pull up on a horse
This is the part where the party is over
But you and your friends know you will not go home
This for my niggas who went and got fired
Just 'cause they desire to grow their hair long
I just said peace to the past like ""so long""
I don't smoke weed yet they passing the bong
Chiefin' the reefer just like Cheech and Chong
This for the teachers who told me that songs won't go a long way
But I'm a long way from home because of it, ayy
Look at this love that I'm covered in, ayy
Built from the ground up, a architect
I present just like a scientist
I'm in this, I give just 'cause I am blood, yeah
Opposite of what they government
I protect people that show me their love, yeah

So just stay right here
Love me from the mountain to the grave right here
Ain't no way it's ever gonna change right here, yeah

Look at all the love around me
Look at all the love around me

I said I pivot like my name was Ross
Pivot, Diana Taurasi
Pivot like Moss, he all squeak
I'm with a army, audience applause
Ain't been the same since Walt's autopsy
I just wish that I could call him, tell him 'bout tour
Tell him how shit not the same like before
Tell him how labels knockin' at the door
Tell him about how my face in The Source or somethin'
Call upon the Lord to come my Autumn
Though I'll never get to see the day
That my daughter come, ignore the dumb
Shit that come with the territory, share the story, all of 'em
Even with the little twist like Oliver all of the time
I told the block y'all should open your eyes
I come from nothing but drugs and the crime
I sung out, oh yes I made it alive
Shouts to the fans and they gave me some time, yeah
Look at the love that I'm covered in
Kept it a hundred, I coveted
This is all real, ain't no supplement
Own all my masters and publishing
Head to Korea, they fuck with it

So just stay right here
Love me from the mountain to the grave right here
Ain't no way it's ever gonna change right here, yeah

Look at all the love around me
Look at all the love around me
Look at all the love around me

Look at all of the love around me, astounding
How niggas still found the time to hate my county
Been cookin' niggas that look like me
We all got bounties on our heads and business is bountiful
My niggas accounted for
Two accountants to run my checks and balances
I never bank on balance though
We stay good with the handy work
But if I can't see a callous that can't be worth a dime
They say that a dollar'll make you rich
But that fake shit can't be worth the time
I got a eight to my face when I have the time
Smoking these days just to pass the time
Smoking sometimes just to stare in your face
Or just to stare in the mirror, I'm scared of standing in place
Even the slowest of paces
Keeping you on the move, it behooves you
All this mindless behavior we're used to
I kick it like Bruce Lee, I be like the water I'm deep in this shit
I'm a young Fela Kuti whippin' a hooptie, we smoked out
Boys at the corner store loc'd out
We stop at the corner store anyway
Look at all of the love around me

So just stay right here
Love me from the mountain to the grave right here
Ain't no way it's ever gonna change right here, yeah

Heritage, cotton seed, I could be lotta things
Lottery winner, this album autobiography
I feel like Socrates, hypothesis: opposites attract
Squares around the block again
Turn a obstacle obsolete
I believe I can fly, ""R Kelly,"" awkwardly
Ain't really popular, prolly 'cause they all doubted
But I was up while they slept
While they said I wouldn't amount to much, I was hit
I knew that if i ain’t older, I turn a obstacle obsolete
Up the street where they bang, I ain't hang
Out the jam, wop da bam
I'll pretend all our friends still alive
Still apply for the fall, cap and gown, for the fail
Furthermore, first of all, curtain call, shirt and tie
I'm a pallbearer, turn a obstacle course to a parquet
Weigh out a horse in a carriage, that wasn't in your inheritance
Splittin' parts as we jumpin' off of the porch again
Portuguese, we don't speaks it but poetry, hopelessly hope
The Lord'll see when our dreams get torn apart
On the tar, left the kid, on your mark
Joan of Arc, genocide, second time, Noah's Ark
Now you're dead, no one saw

When I'm dead, and I'm gone
Would you smile 'cause you know
Where I've been and gone?
When you're dead and you're gone
Would I smile 'cause I know where you've been?
When I'm dead, and I'm gone
Would you smile 'cause you know
Where I've been, and gone?
When you're dead, and you're gone
Would I smile?

Monday to Monday,UnKnown,2017.0,"Honestly I think that 24/7 a understatement to my day to day
If ain't no way then imma make way
Naysayers say it ain't no way
I ain't never listen
Kept em at a distance
This is for the ones who ain't afraid
And this is more than some paper chase
I wonder who else can say the same
Never worried bout what they attain
If I'm living then I really can't complain
Can't contain who you really are
I know my true colors like this ain't a stain
Hustle hard like a MMA hit
Innovative
Didn't do it all in a day spent
But if they did we ain't hating
Look, I go double or nothing I'm just here to gamble
On my grind like my name was Kareem Campbell
Built it from the ground up like I just went camping
My name should be hand in hand with Thor's hammer
Remember when I couldn't afford dinner
Losing weight I'm getting more thinner
Saw it coming like a lesson planner
All the glitz and glamor critically acclimated I grew it on my own my organic
Now my agent say we tour planning
World renown like Michael or Janet
Got it out the ground like growing granite
Gracious I can't take a day for granted
Never looking down and never panicked
Only kept my thought on being great
And that's what I attracted like a magnet

I hustle from Monday to Monday
Knew that I would get it some day
Got me feeling like Lebron James
Wasting time bet that's what some say
Remember when they didn't want me
I knew I was on to something
10 to 10 what my alarm say
A.K.A. Monday to Monday

I'ma put mom in a castle
Got it out the ground like gravel
Coming back around like a lasso
Micro, macro
I'ma put mom in a castle
Got it out the ground like gravel
Coming back around like a lasso
Macro, macro

Like a vision board I see with clarity
I hustle like my name was Gary V
For more than the wealth and prosperity
Accountants was talking bout equity
I'm Triple H giving a pedigree
That mean that I'm special my specialty
I put in the work till I'm dirt in the earth
Or moving furniture to Beverly
I cannot stress it I just let it be
I want it all I am not settling
I'm on the move like I was settling
Failed a few but I ain't sweating it
They say success is like the best revenge
I can't kick it with no pessimist
Know it's my time that ain't tentative
Monday - Monday talking 10 to 10

I hustle from Monday to Monday
Knew that I would get it some day
Got me feeling like Lebron James
Wasting time bet that's what some say
Remember when they didn't want me
I knew I was on to something
10 to 10 what my alarm say
A.K.A. Monday to Monday

Niggas aching for clout, I know
Niggas who run in yo' house, without stakin' it out

I just envisioned the count, then I go get that amount

Is that it's somebody I probably knew

Labels keep tryin' to sign me, they do not have the amount yet
See I come from a place
Where them niggas don't usually amount to shit
Boarded up houses across from the suburbs
That's causing a feud like the north and southern
A fight for the slavery re-cost society
Got 'em runnin' in your mother's house (How?)
'Cause they under your covers, there's no one to cover
That's pointin' they guns as they're runnin' for cover
The news ain't gon' cover, there's nothin' to govern
When niggas keep fighting and killing each other
To deal with each other for dealin' to others
Dealin' with the facts, make a nigga wonder
Who gon' have my back when the storm thunder?
He gon' take the white, cook and make it butter
Ain't no thinking twice, he don't ever stutter
Money in his sight, runnin' to them numbers
That's the finish line, right before he crosses blue and red lights
Central booking cover 25 to life
Something like his cousin, that's the way of life

I've been on Adderall too long cause it's feelin' like the same day
Hourglass, sand will pass, that look like the same grain
What's your timezone, is your time gone without living?

Who do you wanna be like?
Who do you picture me like?
What will I be when I grow up?
Cause I never wanted to be like them
These niggas never seen me shine nah
And I'm sorry for the me time ya'll
I just had to get my mind right

All the kids I graduated with waiting for my major hit
Disregard my shows until I main event
Till I stadium I'mma stay working Stayin' in
Fuck Imma go out for?

Feelin' like the motherfuckin' GOAT and I'm about to milk the game

And I know it make it bleed, if I wrote it, I been on it nigga

I've been on Adderall too long cause it's feelin' like the same day

California,Bucket List Project,2016.0,"See the horizon from the road, and hope that we drove...the right direction

But I know that my bucket gon' make it to California, California
Hmmm mm mm Cali, Cali

What does love look like in the 22nd century? Merely a memory
I intervene cause I tend to be a lil' more optimistic than the wildest child or the most imaginative
I sip the tea after my opinion
They Pistol Pete, dishin' out assistance
Government aid, what does it take
To break the mold, ay I hate the po'
Like the base is low, but I'm out the park
Like the acre gone
Saba with the sabre sword
Focusin' on what we can't afford
In the scheme of things, guess it just ain't important
Who wasn't broke for a moment or three
Start staining like, ""oh it was free""
Then stop for a moment of peace
And plus they would call the police if you kept showin' ya face
I said I stopped dreamin', instead I decided to chase
And I ain't look back, that's how you turn to stone
My first friend up in high school was a Stone
He said come and join, I ain't come along
Not cause I'm high and mighty, just cause I knew right from wrong
Somewhere I belong, looked but I didn't find
But instead of getting discouraged I got my city behind
Now I'm feelin' worldwide, next stop NY
Next month LA, then back West Side
You change when a friend dies, new man since I lost Kobe
He got out of prison then called my phone like, ""where COMFORTZone?""
And since then I lost touch, but this year I'm gettin' it back
I finally feel like myself, what I've been on, don't even ask
They ask me ""why the Bucket List?""
You know the bucket list, I finally climbed the rock, made it to the top of the precipice
I came from the pessimism of inner city as it is
Accident prone youth, adult say don't take a chance
But we never listen, we went and did it, they vision impaired
So what do you fear, and why are you scared?
Why are you scared?
Why are you scared?

See the horizon from the road, and hope that we drove...the right direction
'Cause I don't wanna slow...down for no gas

Yo yo yo what up? This is Lupe Fiasco

One of 'em is uh, wantin' to win the Nobel Prize, for somethin'. Uhhhh, I also want...yeah that's it, I just wanna win the Nobel Prize
Yeah!


House, in a gated neighborhood, not the hood, in the hills

Look at what you done started?
Lookin' at how you've gone, gone

American Hypnosis,Bucket List Project,2016.0,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ahem!
Huh, ah, ah

Ah, American hypnotize, been sad since about '09
Was scared of shit in my mind, now I smile in my pic's online
Isolation taught me patience 'bout the way to go
Had to learn my mama depression wasn't my own
Had to feel the pressures of the pessimism
Trying to convince me that realism was a better vision
Never been accepted in the ghetto, but I'm on Division
And I'm livin', inability to be myself in a room full of niggas
Focused on hittin stains and gettin' bitches
I don't speak, I'm silent as a mouse by my own house
With a bit of bitterness, worried about fittin' in
And my uncle in the pen taught me how to be a man
But he failed to mention why he did what he did
Why my dad had to dip 'fore I learned how to tie my sneakers?
While my mama boyfriend think he hiding the fact he sell reefer
We was kids, that ain't mean we was stupid
First time I'd seen a gun, thinking if he'd shoot it
Shotgun in my mama mouth, please don't do it
She ran home naked and came right to us
And I go to school the next day like ain't shit happen, excelled in great grades and they ain't matter
Standardized tests educate data
You love the hype shit, but they ain't Saba
You ain't seen addicts until my family
Granny lost her brother, her other brother, her daddy
You wonder why I don't drink, wonder why I don't smoke
Wonder why I don't live, wonder why I'm so gray
Wonder what's a fun night, waiting for the punchlines
Want the beat quantized, you should play some other shit
Nigga, we was traumatized, you talkin' 'bout the government?
Had to get my ass whooped, fight's how we settle it
I wish I didn't have to be famous to be important
I used to wish that my parents could keep it cordial
I hated my life until I played the piano
They raided my best friend, he red-handed
Scene of this shit like a scene of a movie
Meanwhile, I'm the kid in the private schooling
Wearing my glasses, playing my computer
Drawing cartoons, was a straight-A student
On a scholarship and I hated that
Left the hood, somehow I made it back

Back to life, back to reality
Will my life, ever belong to me?
Hypothesize the definition of free
Realize this dream wasn't meant to be

Hey, boss, how ya doin'? It's Pops, here's my bucket list; it's pretty short. I want us to go see Vatican City, I wanna go see Mecca, I wanna visit Israel, I wanna visit Morocco, I wanna see the Egyptian pyramids, the Mayan pyramids in South America. But most importantly, what I'm saying is that I want us to all do this together. I'm proud of you, man. Peace

Look, I tell 'em to keep it low
I put all my people on
Fuck, whoever be opposed
I'm in a deeper zone than on my last one
Run all of it backwards, you punt
I chose to go for it was in the corridor
Now I'm on choruses (uh), I can never fold
I'm 'bout my coin like the laundry tho'
I get my paper then adios
Youngin' with bars like the Audy home
Saba but well known like sabido
Sober but got off a addy doe
I tell the truth on like every song
I drop a classic that's Abbey Road
You can add 'em up
Two under my belt like I'm fat as fuck
You begging for help like you had enough
We really not into that acting tough
I'm really myself in this, I'm like a out west philanthropist
I write my songs with no cannabis
I'm in the Bay bitch I'm tapping in
I coulda made what you made if I signed
I'm a independent young black men
I'm at yo' head, that's a CAT scan
Not here to kick it, no Jack Chan
Random shout-out to my black fans
Listening to it and yelling out, ""Pivot""
I'm partially studious, partially ignorant
I'm not here for the 15 minutes
All my team is winnin', I'ma need a minute

Yeah this nigga must've lost his fucking head, nigga
Where it go? Where it go? Where it go? Where it go? Oh
Since high school, I lost all my fuckin' friends, nigga
Where they go? Where they go?

Not to be cocky but it's a reason they copy me
Copy machine epson, they salty they seasoning
How many times must I do something completely
Out of the seemingly simple, you seen it boy, y'all done seen me
Funny thought y'all was competing
I Petey Pablo my block though, I raise it up like it raised me
I'm talking cluckers and killers we come from customers daily
I Barnes and Noble these pages, my boy from Noble he famous
Half of my boys is on papers, the other half on them stages
Yeah I'm sick as the stage IV, take back the mixing you paid for
You should return all your beats to who made 'em
Because that was not what they made for
I take my words and I wage war, I'm the best out I can assure
I can guarantee it, I just let it be it
I just say less while they say more
I stand my ground like on a fort, winning because I am a sore-
Loser, I maneuver like commuters
The water prolly bluer in the sewer
They want you to drink it like a brewer
You just blew ya chance like you were Bueller
And ya interest, perfect attendance
Was on the bus but now I'm on the tour

Yeah this nigga must've lost his fucking head, nigga

Burnout,COMFORTZone,2014.0,"My granddad adamant about Adam and evil
How after the show in the back, it's a Katt Stacks dyin' to meet you
I wanna rap with the Beatles, I just wanna rap like the Beatles
On the road to success caught a detour, picture me touring in England
I got stranded in Englewood outside of this chick's house
And since then, I ain't ever really been south
Bench-press bird shit, chess nerd, kiss-ass
You're distanced from the rest of the world; it's hardly normal
I only party formal
I'm on mute with no remote, so I don't talk much
And the land is lawless like they theme music on cassette
Yellow tapes, say caution, caucus, I owe a lot to it, though
Seen a guy on a bus ride, he'll probably die doin' dope
Seen a group of girls and they were calling on the Lord
Like, ""May He be with you""
In Armageddon, I'ma be a nigga with a sword
Like Mace Windu
Bullet went through they window, like that was a close call so
What if it's your fault?
Do—Do—Don't let them catch you sleep and doze off, ahh

Hey, Universe, don't come at me with your bullshit
Your nonsense, your issues, can't handle it
These problems keep me up at night
But in the end they're just problems, and everybody got some, right?
Shut up, shut up, don't nobody want to hear that
Shut up, shut up, don't nobody want to hear that
I'm right here, we burn up
Pull the windows down and roll out

Crashin' cars like burnout, I got burnout
So I dropped out—see? I turned out okay
On the Holy Bible, told a lie to teachers in the twelfth grade
On my entrance essay, I just want to live, find a college to attend
Get a pup and picket fence, stop the choosing and just pick
In my head, I keep a pic with a fist on the end
I got homies in the low, a mama on a hundred-and-something
I'm hella out West though, where the buses stop runnin' early
I used to run home; I was scared to walk, people bled at dark
It's funny, we play with chalk and then lay in chalk
Foreshadow the shadows, it's more cattle for tattles
It's beef or snakes with the rattle, they tryna dethrone your castle
I call it like a sportscaster with stats on tally and tackles
I told this lie for a white whore who thinks I'm a statistic
Bitch, you hate your job
So fuck your condescending, I got common sense
You got passed up like a close call
Don't let them catch you sleep and doze off, ahh

Hey, Universe, don't come at me with your bullshit
Your nonsense, your issues, can't handle it

If my past could talk
It'd probably reply to the missed calls after all

Outside looking in like fences
I see my city in a light that glistens

Artist came together and then work the hardest

I was bumping 
Food & Liquor
Listening to Lupe
I was grinding, touchè
That was at the open mic
Them was every Tuesday
Now we on the road

But currently earning
And they were touring the nation

For my time until I realized that I gotta make it

Keep pushing it forward
Young pioneers and my peers and the poets
We bringing it back home right where it started

I was just riding the bus
Spoke out for the dream
Instead biting my tongue

With your guy but that beside the point
The fruits of the labor, papaya
One day we'll split the pie up and maybe enjoy (Aw)
Your brown skin turns blue, under the moon
You know I don’t smoke, but you'd fire the joint
I just want to chill (Chill), with you
I ain't got shit to do, I was hopin’ you'd join (Aw)

Money that don't mean nothing (Mean nothing)
Money that don't mean nothing (Mean nothing)

I said that just my baby babe
While the clock go tick, flavor flav
Back when they offered me pay to play
Like, look at this long way we came
Some of the greatest turn Jay and Dame
And they split when the seasons change
But I know it won't be that way
If ever I see the day you by my side like a edible
I see you in my peripheral
Heart beat I don't need no stethoscope
I'm tellin' you shit I ain’t never told no one
I know you know me very well
""In love"" you barely feel, before most times I’m fairly sure
We'll end up in fairy tale
Tutorial, you’ll show me how
How can I not be with you?
Slide in the AM, kick it
Pinch me, I must be dreamin' still
If we gon' chill, I'm bending that corner, I’m spinnin' that wheel
You gon' come out when I text you, ""I'm here""
Your boyfriend mad, now you here with the bill

Temporary,UnKnown,2015.0,"Castles turn into debris I feel like I've been here before
Shorty took five and lived through it that's more like a miracle
They gon' try to take you down when you get to your pinnacle
Some niggas will fall but some just stay up like the spiritual
You empty handed with a temper tantrum
If God is greed then by all means
Trade a silver lining for a silver dollar
You'll get in proper with an Impala
With ten toddlers niggas couldn't stay grounded
There's no humping on this side of town
It feel like ego gon' turn to C4
And melt this bitch down
I'll probably die an reappear as poor but more important
Got the people like a porter
Step in port authority woke up and found my soul
Now watch him probably pour it
I heard I write like a poet
Kobe said imma go on tour
Rest in peace my nigga
How we taking shit for granted
When this life is barely even yours
And now you vagabond
Funny they tagged along
Back when you had it all
You knocked on heaven's door
And asked them to spare change
They only sparing love
You probably run away
Everything's temporary

And money so temporary
And poor is so temporary
And new friends so temporary
And so is the cemetery
And money so temporary
And poor is so temporary
And new friends so temporary
And so is the cemetery

Everything is temporary
Who are you to judge me now
Even when I'm low and weary
I'll get up again somehow
Fuck you and your opinions
Fuck you and your opinions

So many dollars I ran for
Low to my due from my landlord
Chasing my problems with shots of the vodka
Like what am I gonna do?
Cause I'm only human they look at my bruises
And hit me with captions
If only you niggas knew how much I put into
Making it happen
You be the one in awe
I think about it all sometimes
Down on my luck I've had more than enough
But it's not the end of life
Cause everything, everything
Everything, everything


Everything is temporary
Who are you to judge me now
Even when I'm low and weary
I'll get up again somehow
Fuck you and your opinions
Fuck you and your opinions

Back against the wall like 
Getting off the floor like an ollie
Left you to pursue the dream I'm sorry
Looking at the TV ain't you sorry
I remember being hungry on the Blue Line
On my way to do recording
Who'd of thought you'd eat when you was starving
I'm just starting
But already I'm ready to call it quits
Then make the same record drop all them hits
If that's what it's taking to make a name
Then consider my new shit anonymous
Y'all know what time it is why do they try
Not to let us to live up to potential
My nigga we've been through a lot and I sent you
A prayer my Lord and my Savior
Let's celebrate every day that we brave",https://genius.com/Saba-temporary-lyrics

Westside raised me I should get that shit tatted
President off a write ins they not even on the ballot
Spreading love like rotation I just pass it like in Cali
I been running rap so long damn my foot got a callus (Saba)
City cold think you need a coat but you really need a vest
Speak on if you blessed I'm coming for your heart like skeeting on your chest
Speak and need a technician upper deck
Tell em live and let listen never deaf
It's too many signs immma get it, on the road to success
Find a living limit pushing lemon pepper chicken
Linen thrift shop, keep it simple
Not expensive synonym of being broke is
I'm just getting by, but barely living
And these niggas wanna bite and burn Billy
And these labels call you how come 
But these niggas shady niggas shifty
You'll be gone in a year like you signed to Diddy
It is not a biggy it is natural
Niggas with me off a pack of loud
Split a bliggy down the middy
Got me high off contact feeling dizzy
Dizzy Gillespie, Galactic the pepsi you cap in the pep
Keep  her has on the rapper ain't rapping
I happen to hate em' I wrap em' in plastic
And pack em' a  to Alaska frostbitten
Good riddance, Good riddance, I drop good writ-tens

Hard work to the drug dealers

Drop a tape and they lovin' it

Animal beats so I Dr. Doolittle them
My pseudonym is GYM
I stay working it out
Killing the fear and the doubt
People keep dying we keep buying the liquor just to pour it out
The earth is a drunk just spinning around
I'm bout to make skeletons come out the ground
Grabbing that life you can be living and never get right
If you looking down how you put up a fight?
Pick your head up never let up never said once it was gon' be easy
Cause a nigga with attitude a lil less scary than a man on a mission
With a real humble heart and a humble smile
And I'm painting this clear like a radiant child
Same old same old, but who could blame tho they know we don't know so educate
Just think about thinking pre-meditate then we don't have to let things escalate
Just move on up, elevate
I heard blacks got magic all in they blood
That's why they quick to shed it
Trying to fertilize they dust
And grow an empire off us
I'm bout to inspire an entire generation to combust
We are engine number 9 or number 6 what's the difference?
CoCo Loco motor movement too much into mangy music
With guitar and sunsets playing light tricks all up on our head rest
Headed out west for a remix revolution
I'm so poor that I swear peace and compassion at war
Who don't need sheep, no Basedgod but ain't it I
Buzz got the worlds eye Lil B

Trade a lifelong girl for a thot

Marathon, that's 4K
Some niggas sold they self for just 4K
I trade a 401K for an AK
And bet I'm not hungry the next day
They told my little homie ""Crime pay""

And he got scolded the next day
He on parole for the next few
He older with the same case
Earned his stripes like he signed with Adidas
Trade a W9 for a .9 millimeter
All my niggas did time, and got beat up
But I was never street enough to grow up and be a thug
Because I went to school everyday
I went to school everyday
Learned shit don't matter, niggas shoot everyday
I had a 3.9 that shit didn't matter

How all them niggas get rich? (rich)
It seems like everybody trying to get a hold of me
But little do they know I'm barely holding like rosary
Before I'll be the success story I'm supposed to be
I'll probably end up on the news just so I eat
If I commit a crime would you love me still?
A refill if I'm empty, drugs hella temptin'
My girl just left me, told her I'm empty
Tell her I’m pimpin', her friend look temptin'

'Cause I ain't go no job
Young nigga, I ain't got no job
I trade a 401k for a AK
Cause when my vitals stop
The grind don't stop
The grind won't stop 'cause when my vitals stop
Mind on plot, so I don't talk
Trade a lifelong girl for a thot, yap

It's niggas trading shots over blocks
I'd rather trade blocks for some stock

Our tummy growlin', they money pilin',

Some of them doubtin', I don't
But it's funny how if it's money 'round then I loan
They closed the school that you went to
And told you that it's rent due, left potholes where you carpool
And caca on that carpet, Chi kids love startin' shit

How learning different?
Burnin' bridges to earn a livin'
Raise your blood pressure, no tourniquet
But expect you can turn the cheek
Major turn of events when you turn eighteen
They kicked you out of your middle school, said your work was pitiful
Mama's loan didn't get approved
So you got a gun, lookin' just like them
Cause whether cap and gown or cappin' down ya called scum

Why they call us scum, from the city slums why

They been speakin' about the evils of the Windy Coast

Know a dab will do ya too much
Sab' will school ya not even gasin' him up
Each track hit harder than a Mack or a truck
You don't hear me though, my music too up, aquatic with the flow
Change seats, change cuts, this upholstery  too much for a degenerate
Too much mixin' with the likes of 
Purple rain yo' broad
Take the game cause the player ain't do it
Schools closin', got the lady into it

Every time I hit the scene they say dark be the trend
Oblivious to the fact black have skin

Too many losses got me focused on wins

On my second bowl of cereal, second semester
Me and my classmates all on separate sections
City on the rise from decadent anthems
Funny they wanna see us all rot just
Drown out the ant farm, used to rock Phat Farm
Used to watch Cat Dog, now you a rap star
Cause the vocab was tough, head in the lap with a with a 4' doubled up
From a mile away, still know that it's us
Clearly  enough
And I started hating this song while writin' it
She came to my crib and she leave with bites and shit
I can't even sleep in my bed
I still got degrees on my head
The temperature hot
I can't even leave, come out here one day go for 10 bucks a pop while my niggas get shot around here
Pound it, pound it, nigga show love to the coldest on the crow's nest

Treat my homies to a case
Like how you innocent in inner city
They scared of you like Insidious city kid

And all we do is sing songs I see ya'll
Cause the funeral love the young brother who doesn't know better
But where is the hater that stay down when they actin' up in the first place
Worst case scenario we make it out alive and uninjured
Then that'll be news forreal because we not statistics
And it took eighteen years but he finally not scared to talk his shit
Still O.C. with it can't seem to control his fuckin' temper
And rap is just fuckin' templates, I can capture a couple pictures

All of the emotion that I felt
You hate me, then you hatin' on yourself
My hand around her waist I'm like a belt
Wealth so hard to get, keep it anonymous
'Cause once the public figures out, targets ain’t hard to hit

To be so fortunate

I’m tired of motherfuckers hitting me up like, ""You never hit me up""
Well, that's what's up
People be focused up on the accolades
People you call your friends get to actin' up
It's sad as fuck, never satisfied
People that I looked up to I'm passin' by

You never hear a nigga say that Saba lied
Since a pacifier and the crib, I was mad inspired as a kid

Took her to a restaurant, now she is undressin'

You know, have you ever seen them niggers with them big rusty ass hands, the kind of hand you can strike a match in the middle of it? Right. They come out at the bell beating themself up. Right, (ding, boom, boom… ) I’m saying, well, he don’t give a fuck about me!

Uh, look, I'm ridin' like I fell in love
Down Roosevelt like Eleanor
We out the hood it's better for us
A private school in the suburbs
The quiet kid, he know his scores
Do he even have vocal cords?
They wanted me to speak up more
And I took this shit overboard
Worn like the mileage high, turned to a violent guy
I walk up in this bitch like y'all know my name but it's funny
'Cause I used to be kind of shy
Like, remember when Jenai said hi, and I would just walk past her
I got a lot to say but not a lot of space so I talked faster
Now I'm far from the silent, feelin' less lost and misguided
College course is horse shit, no offense and I'm still undecided
On the fence like I was just here for the ride
I'm not up for election but could probably suffice as a write in
So quiet, because rejection like my biggest fear
My only phobia was growin' up and watchin' no one care
My character embarrassed, that it´s hard to just be myself
My cellphone went from zero contacts to 'bout a million in a year

If it’s flawed, it falls
If it's real, it won't
Just look at the stars, and know
Love is found, when it's lost
If it’s flawed, it falls
If it's real, it won't
Just look at the stars, and know
Love is found, when it's lost
When it's lost

All I can be is myself
All I can do is me, R.I.P. to my stealth
Invisible but not invincible
Penetrable mental words like projectiles
How many of them went through
Went too far without talkin'
Talk about some shit you've been through instead of Bentleys and bent knees
That's a pet peeve I have when a rapper act like they can't breathe
They not alive but one dimensional, he went to the bank and withdrew his soul
But my soul is what I give you
Like Cassius duckin' the draft, now the fight is over hopefully I can win
At war with yourself when you look in that mirror you realize who you been fightin'
My father told me I'm 'bout to take it over, been recordin' since 10
Years old, not PM
These songs, these hymns
My life literally on wax from wacker to back out west though
Only nigga from the block that dream of different success
You think that he accept himself just cause he made acceptance speech?
I'm out my comfort zone, I found myself, now accept me for me

If it’s flawed, it falls
If it's real, it won't
Just look at the stars, and know
Love is found, when it's lost
If it’s flawed, it falls
If it's real, it won't
Just look at the stars, and know
Love is found, when it's lost
When it's lost

When it's lost
When it's lost
When it's lost
Just look at the stars, and know
Love is found, when it's lost
When it's lost
When it's lost
When it's lost
When it's lost


Fake girls callin' me by my real name
Real people fuck with me cause I feel pain
Am I insane
For thinkin' that it's possible for me to blow up and I ain't deal 'cane?
I'm from the same street that fo' nem on,  grew up on
That corner like they foundation is more like a cornerstone
Well wishes like a quarter thrown, even if it's sorta wrong
I'm 'bout to take it back like the waiter got your order wrong, crack epidemic
Fast forward thirty years, rap epidemic
Fashion and linen, fast bitten rhythm
I'm from the D, that's division, they put my nigga in prison
He wrote me every month and told me I'mma get it
I don't need your opinion, you don't gotta believe in me
There's niggas that'll bleed for me, the same go equally
Black ops lurkin' like COD
And white cops wanna kill me
Only cause I'm a black boy
The only rap boy that spit facts and I factoid
They kill niggas for their Concords
Me, I'm just tryin' to go on tour
My niggas comin' up with me out in carpool
To Toronto to something you all know
To something that you all know

You must got your finger pricked on a spindle
Friends call me L'z, but you can call me Vincenzo
Minus the Uzi and kitchen I'm on a mission 'til it's
Breakfast at Wimbledon, turkey sausage and French toast
With all my niggas, I swear I tell 'em we this close
You need a dollar I got ya, spot ya like Glenn Close
I'm twenty two with dreams of payin' off them Benz notes
They pulled me over, L'z suspended, damn, I didn't know
Didn't matter, cuffed to a banister, finger prints on a scanner
Most niggas that talk about shootin' dudes is actors
To keep it real you probably hard as chutes & ladders
My next shit a brick of piff, you smell it through the plastic
Sonnin' all you bastards, and you gon' meet the parents like a male nurse
Cause when it come to these sixteens I'm well versed
Few thousand fans in one room, we send that bitch to the moon
Remind me to let you know if the hammer fell first, they probably yell church
But I might show up to the function in a tinted Hummer
With a Zoe Saldana, just left Benihanas
Might cut her off right after summer, I don't really want her
Keep it a hundred, she just a prima doma that's on a scholarship
Say she do this as often as the apocalypse
I told her save that shit to a floppy disk
Girl save that shit to a floppy disk

Say where-where-where you are
Is a reflection of where we start

Oh how lovely it'd be to take you for a ride

I went for a trip paid for by my allowance
I'm loud as a mouse then out the house
And I'm out on the town and I swear
I whip like I'm Kunta
That whip like too crucial

Kinda raw plus I got that soul like a commodore
Ayy, commandeer, I'm 'bout to take this shit back
Ayy, at yo' head you 'bout to get your wig snatched
Ayy, what they do for cash look like fear factor
Ayy, but I ride 'round, surround 'em like I'm clear plastic
Rack it up, rack it up
I just got paid at the show, this shit addin' up
Thinking of packin' up
Like I could retire right now and they had enough
I had my managers, I tell 'em we should go U.S. to Canada
They hit me back like ""Saba, consider it booked in the calendar""
Shout out the analysts
Shout out the critics who wait for the beat to drop
Shout out TheNeedleDrop

Bro, I’m out man, ya'll niggas trippin’

Ah, ah, yeah
You can’t get paid in a earth this big
You’re worthless, kid

I was taught to love the enemy that’s word sworn like a first born
And that grass grow from a dirt lawn
When daddy said he was leavin’, did it hurt mom?
Wait, wait who the fuck is this new nigga on her arm?
They call him shorty I’m a shorty damn near his height
You get outta the car you hitchhike, you ain’t ridin’ with us
You can die my nigga, I don’t care if I’m 5 my nigga
But everybody like you except me and you trynna accept me
Shit it would be easy if you bribed a nigga
Cartoons on Massasoit turned to a vantage point
I just wanna see the world rotate
First time I saw the moon shine never stayed up so late
And we watched in a box while jumpin' in the bed in our socks
He pulls in the garage and he yells for Taj to come out
I, look around and go downstairs, ‘cause even if I don’t wanna go I know that my momma wouldn’t allow it
Guess we ridin’ around then
He took me to the store and told me that he got me
And then I started pickin’ out shit, glass cut, inside Gold
And a sphere so it rolls, it looked like a bunch of globes

We're all formless
Shapeless, flowin’
Foreign orbit
Starlight, sparkle
Ancient fossil
Flaws with marbles

I guess I get to see the world rotate after all
The big one is my shooter, like he had to ball
Shorty is the man to me now, but we had it all
In front of El Grand he made a nigga take his jacket off
You owe him money, better have it all
‘Cause you comin' with half, let's just say that that's something he won’t have at all
For salary, people hustle like Cassidy
I just got a new Casio and a karaoke machine
Now he ain't have the law, but he just know the system
I line my marbles up and I can see the solar system
They think I’m playin’ in the dirt, how naïve
Got into my first fight, and he lost his front teeth
Shorty taught me a cool handshake and I thought we made it up
Got to high school and realized we was just shakin' up
I see my reflection when I look into the heavens
Marbles in my pocket while the sun is settin', settin'

We're all formless
Shapeless, flowin’
Foreign, orbit
Starlight, sparkle
Ancient fossil
Flaws with marbles

You can’t get paid in this earth this big
You’re worthless, kid
Time to take action, affirmative
No more games like refurbishin', uh
I’m only 9 but I’m turnin’ 10
Bump, some alternative like
I ain't never heard of this, shorty let me burn the disk
Keepin' his head above water like he learned to swim
Of course that's when they tried to murder him
But I’m gracious, he took three, one grazed him
With his blood up on the pavement, he ain’t fried he just bakin’
Never seemed like such a cake walk the walk
Makes his way to a car, he go to pick up my mom
Like heaven can wait
When you this big planets start look like marbles
Just pray they don't use the sun as a shooter

Magazines, the faster things leave quickly as they came
Leave as quickly as they came

What a shame that it couldn’t last

They booked my best friend, now he at county
She dumped her boyfriend and then she found me

Yet you’re still going on

And we can be forever as long as the sky is lit
And even in the dark we ultraviolet
The finer things in life, we’re trying to find them
That pot of gold, we dying to find it
I’m from the Go, we dying to die

Might say some things I can’t in front of my granny, ah
Boston grad, but only yield to the Grammys, ah
College scholarship from anonymous
Getting 15 credits then I dropped some shit
I dropped my songs more than dropping homework
Made some new friends, no longer a loner


I need a lawn and a balcony
Forbes watching my salary
And a chick with a bit of aphrodisiality
The grass is green, garden of eden speaking
Guardians guard me from the evils
I’ll be, cause she know
That I’m cautious, I’ll keep her
As closely as a kid
Croak if Imma sling her

Lead her, never lead her on

When love is in a new state each night
And all our exes white

For when that signature for talents
Exchanged for business in your palace

Scrambling and people screaming, we look out the window

And I needed advice, fuck that I needed a christ

Boy this shit can get ugly, no not a catfish
But I been slaying niggas like I'm a dragon
Boy you wouldn't be hip hop with a medallion on
Oh you mad that I'm stylin' on
Standing on my own ground like I went and put the towel down
King shit, nigga bow down
Fuck around be labeled as the GOAT
I be down but the label gotta go
Niggas out like they made it by the mold
I can't vouch for what these niggas on, but what they don't know
I been working by the boatload
Since I was in basement, Kobe had the colt .45
Undertaker had the choke-hold
We was in the basement just like, mankind
All I know is that I told y'all
So when this shit happen don't act, surprised
I feel like I've been here before
That's why I say long live to my niggas, that died
Bettin' on me like I'm pinchin' pennies
I can't give a fuck 'bout yo fix and fifty

Figured it out
Niggas been here for a minute' then get figured out
Then they not here for the summer, that's like a drought
That's when the birds'll fly south
I flip the bird on the track
The type to bring murderous back, look
I heard hip-hop was dead, it appeared to be that
But the crib is just where I do surgery at, yeah
That's
A lot of nay say, my Mama bay-bay
Could probably be, whateva they say
When I'm with Daedae, it sound amazing
Yeah
You don't like me say names, they like to gang-bang
If they with me, but not like the same lames
Who for no reason, be screamin' gang-gang

Get familiar, Joseph Chilliams kill ya
Yes he can, like Bob builder
Firearm wielder, with a pen in my hand

Perform voodoo with diction
The one that flew over the cuckoo’s nest like chickens
Am I sensing resentment? Well stop watching the lifetime channel
Cause this here is primetime ammo
Like Janet, and the tit seen around the planet
Get to know, like Bobby Brown and blow
Everybody knows, like I’m in the garden growing vegetables
Cause it shows, like I bruise easily

So who’s that? You got a hunch or two?
I’m back like the hunchback after 300 lose (spartans)

Pissing on everything in the water coming through

Bombing bodies at parties for nothing, just because it’s fun to you
So turn up, turn up
Ain’t no telling where you turn up, on the furniture or furnace
Burn ya, iron and scorch and abort this mission

Radio station switching, please do not play that here man
I bet they pay to see me, remake a pay for CD's
Like screw your internet and your cable, push it to the max like beta

Sat up in the back of the cab rollin' a fat spliff

Closed circle, better watch the cash that you arrived with
Zoned out, vibing to this beat homie created

Desire to run rap off principles
See more blinded eyelids, open up
See more coming up, got Rakeshe on my seesaw
We are destined for greatness
Heard hard work and dedication gets places
I’ve been nothing but dedicated
Facing 'em, finna rise up like facelifts
Fourth grader, scared in his own basement
I’m making beats, the class talking bout spaceships
Paper airplanes, beebee guns and guess
These are my days of recording on cassette
But now fubu’s gone, and I got buku pumps
All my jerseys worn, in Jersey I performed
Not bad for a little nigga like myself though
I’m like a stalker, I just follow where success go
Set goals, make it happen
Best goal, make it rappin'
Nothing in my pockets but lint, I guess I’m fastin'
But they don’t chant my name and they don’t call me Hov
Like what good is being the best if people don’t hardly notice
More than a song, I’m surrounded by wrong, right
And sometimes I feel like they don’t feel what I write
Maybe the will they next day like a long night
Call it a hangover, 'bout to take the game over

It seems to me you’re kind of an icon
For someone who
I don’t really give a fuck, when you get right down to it
But the prosperity led to greed and possessiveness
For someone who can see the um bad things going on but not let it sort of harden your heart
I don’t care what happens to my um my species because I think this species has squandered great gifts
Namely, and especially, the gift of this mind
So I pulled away emotionally and I said you know what fuck 'em
Let 'em do what they want to do, I’m gonna enjoy this shit as a spectator

Cold hitta, prolly go shirtless in cold weather
Stack money, rhyme, elevate, that's my vendetta
I'm sleep catch z's every fall like 6 letters

Look, take a dive in the lyrical rap
The rat pack
Get cheese never get trapped
I'm a threat so they back back
Flow nasty the whole world resemble Kat Stacks
Professor of this ish
School you boys like back packs
Open doors full of bars
Valet parking the car
Scurry and fu** a broad
Pop a pill to f-loss
Holy presence of God
The messiah the great Allah
Watch em resemble me
Lost in the knowledge you see
This the type of flow you need to mop
Lyrics they will never stop
While you're drinking on that peach Ciroc
I'm finding my peace with Pac
Apocalypse is hot the block is hot
Lil Weez I spit a flow I bet you freeze
I got the honey's because I beeess
The hottest MC to ever achieve
The things I believe
And I got red eyes chasing the green
The green is the leaf
Hearing me speak the sighs of relief
The lyrics the beat
Put me in the mood to start a killing spree
F*** a empty stomach
I'm starving I'm tryna eat
Got an entree full of rappers
It's time to begin a feast
Why the labels signing rappers who can't even stay on beat?
Like that
And it's sickening killer flows of delivery crack
And I'm shittening
Oops I meant to say shittin' with gnats
Boys bickering
But I remain a mystery
Like Scooby Doo
So I do me, you should do you too
Boys clueless foolish and stupid like Boo Boo the fool

Swear I'm going in Like a two time felon I'm under rated but that's

How much she love the the tape I never hate I just mediate The sound
Track to my life got no skips I just let it play I'm tryna own it They
Tryna clone on it If they would've asked me nicely I would of loaned
It Instead I ain't gon give them a chance Better watch what you say to
This young Avalanche I stay on track like a Nike fuel band So many
Gigs I need more data man Ya plan A only work when u don't got a back
Up plan I fall down, and I get back up man

Man I swear
I can jump off of a building
Leap over rooftops
Glide over ceilings
While sealing my soul in a pyramid
King tuts descendent
Sending a note
Through a time portal
Nailed to the sail of a boat
If my album was for sale
Will it fail? Will it float?
Like parades, out of space
In this game but I'm close
To the rim, like Dwayne or some spokes
Holy water for my sins
Jesus chain for the rope
Church roof as stool
Play the fool, it's a joke
Leap of faith on face
I'm deranged and I know
That the day will approach
That I'll slip & I'll fall
Hollow tips hit his jaw
Call em lacy duvalle
Hold up, wait..
Let me pause..
Play, sipping re(d) wine
Spitting four words
Moving forward
On demand, like a order
Not an Hors d'oeuvre
Homie I can do this all day
Lantern to a lamppost
Where ya damn coat?
Wear ya damn coat, cause the camp cold
You just damn dirt in a compost
This a calm post, let ya mom know
Ya saddam know, we the bomb
Oh, where the congos?
I'm the king, where did kong go?
You a console, game boy
Getting controlled by the council
Count bread, but I lack toast
Bussing lactose on her back slow
Bitch I'm lazlo, lead the camp like a masco-
Oww, a mascot
Basquiat mixed with Van Gogh
Tryna tango to merengue
Been a sensei, since the tenth grade
Tummy empty, I'm an MC


There were clones wanna bes like a copying machine
I'm me like wayne before you bought the carter 3
Copying then They paste I control alt delete
Authoring
Opportunity will call let it ring
Let it go
Let my people go Moses when I sing
When I see
People scared to be they self
I'm just me
Setting by example when it's ample y'all following
Tryna trend
Finals mvp I'm just tryna win
I had a dream that I had a run in with the law
The same dream I was in a magazine
Hoping I don't mess it all up
Never been wack Look my catalog up
Never pitched crack but the adderall plug
Looking out for me like nanny or cub
I been in the game but I just made dub
All them boy lie and they shit made up
What is ya problem
Kept this shit 100 like change for a dollar
Pimping this game got a cane and a collar
Best rapper living bitch I'm Wayne on the carter
Smooth young nigga and it came from my father
Bitch I'm from Austin
Westside cautious
Approach with
Roaches
Smoking
Wrote this on off day
And still sound better than most shit
Oh shit
Gottem in check like coaches
That's Nothing but the truth
True so help me god
I'm aite
But I see it differently since Relly died
Really I
Never cared much about fitting in with y'all
When it all
Comes down to it I can do it on my own
Wrote a song
For the free I might sell it for the fin
Put it on iTunes
Putting on for the fam
I'm just chilling with my dogs
Like its Jake like I'm fin
Tryna tell the whole story
From the start til the end",https://genius.com/Saba-footaction-family-cypher-lyrics
The Heir,The Ozymandias EP,2011,"Listening to 
Asking it who am I
Only time will tell like a cuckoo clock
Write letters to the mob enforcer
And I just want to be moved to god but still I
Ambitiously move like Diddy
Suburb through the city, I hustle like Nipsey
Keep it 100, I’m 100 and 50
So in every case Imma chase like Vinny
My head I’m bout to let em in
David, cosign this like letter head, paper
Vocab sharp and the pen is that razor
Still RA

And to you the main topic
Or you shine like the Arctic
I need you to be cautious
Cause they rhymes is toxic
Toxic, toxic
And when you the main attraction around the world like an atlas
Run rap till the capless
It’s up to you to kill the whackness, whackness
Hey, hey

Say this is gon get em pissed, flow is epitome
Truant so fill him in, with a pen
Like outlining, y’all was in the crib I was out rhyming
I’m ahead of my time, it’s
Cause I am hip hop’s heir
This halo, call it whack rap slayer
Got em running away like Roy Ayers
This real time like I’m Bill Meyers


I say I’m going on a trip with no destination
I just need something that’ll get me farther than where space end
The sky is the limit, I’m a few steps past it
And impossible is nothing I believe like a catholic
Put your hands through the holes in my wrists
I want you to feel what I see
Look through my vision and you’ll
And understand the tongues that I speak in",https://genius.com/Saba-the-heir-lyrics
