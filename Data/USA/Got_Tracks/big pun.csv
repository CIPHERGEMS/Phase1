Stretch & Bobbito Freestyle (’95),UnKnown,1995,"Skip the talk, pull ya guns out
That's when the bitch comes out
The dark, from ya heart
I'll slit ya throat and pull ya tongue out
Fuckin with the best, I'll burn ya flesh 'til there's less than teeth
Dump ya bones in Western Beef
Peace, hope ya rest in grief
Left the wreath on ya grave and autographed it
Big Dawg slaughters pastors during mass
I don't support their masters
Meaning God, I'm hittin hard as hell
Niggas be givin the law an L
When I get finished i'm larger then life but harder to kill
Still I will remain the pain inflicter
Givin ya hell to reign the victor
Comin to get ya, playin the game the same as Hitler
You picked the wrong nigga to fuck with
Talkin that tough shit
You couldn't have been a bigger faggot if ya sucked dick
Duck quick and catch a hundred in ya temples
If ya blunted, test the mentals
And be found drowned with just cement shoes
BITCH!

Brothers are rappin like Iraqi soldiers
Actin like they crackin boulders
Wouldn't pack a cap gun or attack a blowfish
Always talkin shit
Players that rather balk than pitch
And often counterfeit
Kings of New York on Mr. Walken's dick
You make me sick to my stomach
You don't really want it
Riffin like you sniffin coke to scare me
But you barely blunted
You really done it, now you got me mad
Boricuas be like: ""Papi's bad""
Makin fakers khaki when I'm droppin math
Stop the laugh, that shit was Buttafuoco
Niggas run like Pun's the Cuco
You gon' tell your putos how I blew, you puto
You don't ever wanna clash again with Big Dawg
The master and one of the last rappers ",https://genius.com/Big-pun-stretch-and-bobbito-freestyle-95-lyrics
I’m Not A Player,Capital Punishment,1997,"You're my darlin' darlin' baby
You're my darlin' darlin' love
You're my darlin' darlin' baby
I said you're everything I ever hoped for in a woman
And as long as I may live
Ooh, you're...

Yo, I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
Jump on top of my dick and work them hips until I bust a shot
It doesn't stop, I'm only beginnin', I'm bonin' your women
While you home all alone, I'm blowin' up in 'em
Sendin' them back to you, mad at you
Don't catch a motherfuckin' attitude
I'm just showin' you how this rapper do
Capital Punishment, when I'm up in it, suckin' it
Bustin' it out—nice blouse, let me unbutton it
You're fuckin' with King Papi Chulo when knockin' culo
Pop your mulos out the socket tryin' to ride with the sumo
You know my rise is high, word, I be drillin' 'em
Bitches be tryin' to ride, but the curve be killin' 'em
Fillin' 'em with the cash, my cheese premium unleaded
Come get it, first work the tongue, then let the Pun hit it
Split it in half, watch the gat, baby, take a bath
Be good, I might put away the wood and give you the mustache

You're my darlin' darlin' baby
I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' love
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' baby..""
I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' love
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot

I bang a stranger in my torture chamber
Feed the locas chocha pinga
While I force my finger where my bolas linger
I bring the pain like Method when I flex and flip the coochie
Puerto Rican to the core, but no Boriquas eat the pussy
'Scuse me for bein' blunt, but I've been eatin' cunts
Since pimps was pushin' pink Caddies with the fish tank pumps
Bumpin' and grindin', simultaneously grindin'
Climbin' up the walls, with my balls bangin' off your hymen
I'm a diamond in the rough, (ugh) bustin' in your face
Taste the sweetness of my dick, rip your fetus out of place
Yo, bitches already know the repertoire
Step in my car, let's start the ménage à trois, like Escobar
By far, I'm the best at all sex positions, forget the kissin'
I'm skippin' the tongue-twistin', TS Tradition

You're my darlin' darlin' baby
I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' love
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' baby..""
I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' love
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot

Some chick in back of me, bought me a daiquiri
Told me meet her in back of Zachary's
'Cause she heard I was packin' meat
I bagged the freak and hit the telly
Got the Phillies, lifted her belly
And ""Put it in Her Mouth,"" like Akinyele
Far from ugly but they used to say I'm too chubby
But since the money the honeys got nothin' but love for me
So rub my tummy and make a wish, I'll make you rich
Take your kids to the flicks, come back and fix your favorite dish
(Not!) You crazy bitch, I ain't with that, I'ma hit that
Split back to the shack where my other chicks at
Now can you dig that? I'm the mack, doin' my thing
Pullin' your strings, makin' you feel like you in a dream
It's the king of the Hip-Hop Quotables, givin' you multiples
Just by the tone of my voice in the vocal booth
I notice you doin' your thing with your crew
Is it aight if I come down there and sing to you?

You're my darlin' darlin' baby
I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' love
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' baby..""
I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' love

Twinz (Deep Cover ’98),Capital Punishment,1998,"Ready for war, Joe, how you wanna blow they spot?
I know these dirty cops that'll get us in if we murder some wop
Hop in your Hummer, the Punisher's ready
Meet me at Vito's with Noodles
We'll do this dude while he's slurpin' spaghetti
Everybody kiss the fuckin' floor
Joey Crack, buck 'em all
If they move – Noodles, shoot that fuckin' whore!
Dead in the middle of Little Italy, little did we know
That we riddled two middlemen who didn't do diddily

It'll be a cold day in Hell the day I take an L
Make no mistake for real, I wouldn't hesitate to kill
I'm still the fat one that you love to hate
Catch you at your mother's wake
Smack you, then I whack you with my snub tre eight

I rub your face off the Earth and curse your family children
Like Amityville,
 
I drill the nerves in your cavity fillin'
Insanity's buildin' a pavilion in my civilian
The cannon be the anarchy that humanity's dealin'
A villain without remorse, who's willin' to out your boss
Forever, and take all the cheddar like child support
[Verse 4: Fat Joe & 
Big Pun
]
I support Pun in anything he does, anything he loves
My brother from another mother, sent from the above
A thug nigga just like me, one of the best—might be
Even better, leavin' niggas kneelin' on they right knee
Spike Lee couldn't paint a better picture
You small change, I'm blowin' out your brains, gettin' richer
Hit ya with the MAC, smack your bitch, nigga what?
You gettin' stuck, my trigger finger's itchy as a fuck
Truck jewels, cruisin' in the Land, bumpin' Cash Rules
Last crew to want it caught a hundred tryin' to pass through
That's true! (
So who the next to get it?
)
TS the best that did it
(
Get it off your chest, kid, admit it, and it's…
)
[Chorus: Fat Joe & 
Big Pun
]
Yeah, and you don't stop!
Twenty shot Glock with the cop killers, fill 'em to the top
Yeah, and you don't stop!
Joey cracks the rock, and Big Pun keeps the guns cocked
Yeah, and you don't stop!
We'll make it hot, nigga, what?
Bring it, I blow your whole spot
Yeah, and you don't stop!
It's still one-eight-seven on an undercover cop

Fuck the police, I squeeze first, make 'em eat dirt
Take 'em feet first through the morgue
Then lodge 'em in the deep earth
The street's cursed, the first amendment's culturally biased
Supposed to supply us with rights
Tonight I hold my rosary tight as I can
I'm one man against the world, just me and my girl
Black Pearl Latina mas fina but keeps it real
You know the deal, we steal from the rich and keep it
Peep it, it's no secret
Watch me and Joe go back and forth and freak it

Creep with me, as I cruise in my Bimmer
All the kids in the ghetto call me Don Cartagena
Kickin' ass as I blast off heat
And you never see me talk to police
Though you should know that I really don't care
Pull you by the hair, slit your throat
And I'll leave you right there,
 so beware
It's rare that niggas want beef,
 Big Pun speak
And let these motherfuckers know how we run the streets

Fuck peace
, I run the streets deep with no compassion
Puerto Ricans known for slashin'
Catchin' niggas while they sleepin', no relaxin'
Keep your eyes open, sharp reflexes
Three TECs in the Jeep Lexus, just in case police test us
Street professors, Terror Squad, ghetto scholars
Full-a-clips mob
, inflicts the fear of God
When the metal hollers
Better acknowledge or get knocked down
Until I'm locked and shot down
Heather B. couldn't make me put my Glock down

We lock towns like rounds in the chamber
Boogie Down major like Nine, I bust mine
Every time, plus I'm the crime boss of New York
Where we taught to walk the walk, all my niggas carry chalk
And stalk our prey like a predator
Whoever want it, go and get it
Set it, baby, and I'ma bury ya
So remember the Squad that I'm reppin'
I fill a clip of my weapon
And punish niggas 'til it's Armageddon
[Chorus: Fat Joe & 
(Big Pun)
]
Yeah, and you don't stop!
Twenty shot Glock with the cop killers, fill 'em to the top
Yeah, and you don't stop!
Joey cracks the rock, and Big Pun keeps the guns cocked
Yeah, and you don't stop!
We'll make it hot, nigga, what?
Bring it, I blow your whole spot
Yeah, and you don't stop!

Still Not a Player,Capital Punishment,1998,"I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
But Big Punisher, still got what you're lookin' for
For my thug niggas, for my thug niggas
Uptown, baby, uptown
Don't wanna be, don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
But you know Big Pun and Joe still down by law
Who's down to fuck tonight?

I'm still not a player, but you still a hater
Elevator to the top, hah, see you later
I'm gone, Penthouse suite, Penthouse freaks
In-house beats, French comtesse, 10 thou' piece
Rent-out lease with an option to buy
Coppin' a 5-0 Benz for when I'm not far up in the sky
Puffin' the lye from my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my kiko
From Queens nicknamed Perico
We go back like PA's and wearin' PJ's
Now we reach the peakage, runnin' trains for three days
Who want to ride it? Won't cost you a dollar
Whether soft or harder, of course you still gonna holla
Mama, I'm big, huh? I'll rip my prick through your hooters
I'm sick, you couldn't measure my dick with six rulers
Hold up, Chula, I'm all about gettin' loot
But I knock that boot if you out to get koofed

I don't wanna be a player no more

I love from butter pecan to blackberry molass'
I don't discriminate, I regulate every shade of the ass
Long as you show class and pass my test
Fat ass and breasts, highly intelligent bachelorettes
That's the best, I won't settle for less
I want a ghetto brunette with unforgettable sex
I lay your head on my chest, and feel my heartbeat
We can park the Jeep
Pump Mobb Deep and just spark the leaf
It's hard to creep since I found Joe
Every pretty, round, brown ho wanna go down low
But this Boogie Down professional, I'ma let you know
Once I put the blows, get your clothes, ‘cause you got to go
I could go downstairs, little brown hairs everywhere
You nasty, Twin, I don't care
'Round here they call me Big Pun, if you with the big guns
Thick tongue, known to make the chicks come

In the hot tub, poppin' bubbly
Rubbin' your spot, love
Got you screamin', ""Punish me!""
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked
When I stick it even Luke be like
""Don't stop, get it, get it!""
In the hot tub, poppin' bubbly

Beware,Capital Punishment,1998,"I gave you fair warning, beware
I gave you fair warning, beware

Yo! What you thought, Pun's shit was weak? Now you can't sleep
Gotta keep your eyes open wide and hide your face from the streets
I'm like the beast with a warrant, far from a law man
Gave you fair warnin', now you on the stairs, fallin'
I'm callin' out any rapper that I doubt, smack him in the mouth
Throw him in the yoke—boom—then I knock him out
No doubt, Freddie Foxxx files
Twenty-shot auto Glock, blaow! Benny Blanc Puerto Rock style
With a twist of black and I'm proud, twist your cap and I'm out
Sleep with the fish-dips for yappin' too loud
What's happenin' now? Niggas is hard as hell but they Gargamels
Pickin' on the smallest victim gives 'em heart to kill
My squad is real and holds it down, the hardest regardless
Besides of the largest
We polish the floor with the rawest hardcore artists
Flawless victory, ya niggas can't do shit to me
Physically, lyrically, hypothetically, realistically
I'm the epitome of catchin' wreck
Catch you when you cash your cheque
Smash you when you pass, then jack you for your fuckin' 'Lex
Nothin' less than the best if the Squad did it
Hard-headed niggas better beware and fear like God said it

I gave you fair warning, beware
I gave you fair warning, beware
I gave you fair warning, beware
I gave you fair warning, beware

Ayo, I warned you, now all niggas could do is mourn you
I'm born to kill and still thrilled to put it on you
There's no regrets, remorse only results in loneliness
Only the strong survive and strive through life as warriors
All of us die, some of us kill, even massacre
Who wanna try? Punisher will if you ask for it
I'm hazardous for your health and Hell's your next stop
For real, my shit's cocked, the world has just stopped
I'm not the one you should be underestimatin'
Come test your fate and I guarantee I'll be under investigation
You can't handle the whole, I'll slam you on your skull
Or we can go blow for blow like Evander and Bowe
You never know; however, though, I still hold the title
When all my rivals have chance to dance with Mr. Homicidal
Hand on the Bible, I swear to defend my crown
I've been around since forever and never let it touch the ground
Don't fuck around and catch a rude awakenin'
My crew's basically waitin' patiently
For you to move your patrons in
Then we'll surround you, form Desert Storm and pound you
Look around you, Terror Squad's everywhere, like Soundview
The Boogie Down do it like nobody, who are we?
The foundation, you're facin' a whole army

I gave you fair warning, beware
I gave you fair warning, beware

Yeah, yeah, yeah! What's up now, partner?
Know I'm sayin'? Think this just some rap shit?
We do this shit for real
Terror Squad, nigga
Fuckin' shoot the place up
Motherfuckers know the time
This motherfuckin' rap game

You Ain’t a Killer,Capital Punishment,1998,"The harsh realities of life have taken toll
Even Jesus Christ forsake my soul
Please tell me what price to pay to make it whole
Take control, I'm makin' dough but not enough to blow
JO's, they lust my flows,
 but ayo, I don't trust a soul
That's all I know or need to, these evil streets'll meet you
Halfway and eat you alive tryin' to survive illegal
I'll leave you lost, mount you on a cross
Whip you like a horse, sacrifice your life to a higher force
Then I'll stomp your corpse
It's the Bronx of course, recognize the accent
One of the last livin' still-in-action general assassins
Catchin' any wreck, blastin' any TEC, smashin' any chest
Passin' any test; Charles Manson in the flesh
Any last requests before you meet your maker?
Sow what you reap or wake up
Shakin' up a storm, like Anita Baker
I'll take you straight to Hell and fill your heart with hate
Incarcerate your fate in Satan's fiery lake, then I lock the gate
Make no mistake, this shit as real as Joe
We follow the killer's code
When we come for you, tell me: where will you go?
Nowhere to run, hide, I'll find you and silence your screams
And even if you kill me, I'll still be in your fuckin' dreams

You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death
Won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak
It ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat

You've made a grave mistake
Shouldn't have come here, you changed your fate
Your brains'll make their debut on the table
When I raise the stakes
The pain is great, but only for a second
It starts strong, then lessens
Just when you restin', the Armaggedon sets in
Left him with so much stress (
T.S.
)
Blessed him with no regrets, yes
Welcome to Hell, son, the threshold of death
Face the serpent, I blaze your person
You get laced for certain, leavin' Jakes no trace to work from
Close the case like curtains
I'm hurtin' heads severely, really tryin' to bring the pain
There's nothin' more satisfyin'
Than when you cryin', screamin' my name
It's not a game, it's Purple Rain, floods of bloodstains
Big Pun's my thug's name
Bustin' my guns, that's my love thang
I'll slit your jug' vein and snatch your Adam's Apple
John Madden-tackle your corpse
To hoist it on a cross at the tabernacle
That'll have to hurt, I'll work your body 'til it burst
Then curse tu vida like a Brujería verse
I'm worse than anything you ever been through
Sick in the head and mental
Essentially meant to be the sole threat against you
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan, when I'm the rhymin' abomination

You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death
Won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak
It ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat
You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death
Won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak
It ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat

It's hard to analyze which guys are spies; be advised, people
We recognize who lies, it's all in the eyes, chico
We read 'em and see 'em for what they are
D's in undercover cars
Takin' my picture like I'm a fuckin' star
I'm up to par, my game is in a smash
With half a million in the stash
Passport with the gats, first name and last
Ask anybody if my men are rowdy
Give me the mini-shottie
I'll body a nigga for a penny probably
I'm obligated to anything if it's crime-related
If it shine, I'll take it; still in my prime and I finally made it
I hate the fact that I'm the last edition
Properly a stats magician
Could've went to college and been a mathematician
Bad decisions kept me out the game
Now I'm strictly out for cream
Doin' things to fiends I doubt you'll ever dream
My team's the meanest thing you ever seen
Measured by the Heaven's kings
Down to the Devil's mezzanine
I've never screamed so loud, I'm proud to be alive
Most heads die by 25 or catch a quick three-to-five
So be advised: the street's full of surprises
It's not what crew's the livest
One that survive, it's who's the wisest

You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death
Won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak
It ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat
You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death
Won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak
It ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat
You ain't a killer...",https://genius.com/Big-pun-you-aint-a-killer-lyrics
Super Lyrical,Capital Punishment,1998,"Ayo, my murderous rap verbal attack is actual fact
Tactical tracks match perfectly with graphical stats
Half of you lack the magical dap of tragical rap
That tackles your back and shackles and laughs at you
That's a mathematical madness I'm on
The savage, the strong
The marriage and bond of havoc and song
This massacre's on, as if Picasso laced you
There's lots of hateful skeletons locked
In the closet of my castle of Grayskull
I'm possum at grade school
That's why I have to debate you
My raps are like Cable, slashing your facial
That's how a master degrades you, I'm battling Jesus
If he passes through my label I'm snatching his halo
God, I'll trade you, if you send my father back as an angel
Language is fatal and it's hypnotizing
I'm only emphasizing
I'm still all about business and enterprising
I'm super lyrical, with brain-booster chemicals
That's used up tentacles inside of my mental projectable

Lyrically, I'm supposed to represent
Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically, I'm-I'm supposed to represent

Black Thought, the super lyricist, your arch-nemesis
Still with the Punisher, that's my accomplice
Stressing to emcees how they don't really want this
Electrifying shit his excellency Thought spit
These cats, they sentimental such with a gentle touch
Dancing double dutch and all saying nothing much
My sound wave lifting your chin up, like uppercuts
Newfound ways of ripping shit up, I develop
Your squad chest swell up, still you're mini-ay-ture to me
Nature-ally I bring the extremity
Musically intense with the globe in suspense
Contemplating where the world traveler been since
The Roots bless you with a strong record, long like a epic
Immerse you in some old next shit, ill poetic
Thought from Illadelph, somethin' like nothing else
My talk stomp like elephants upon every elf, 'cause what?

Lyrically, I'm supposed to represent
Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically, I'm supposed to represent
You will lose, I must break you
Lyrically, I'm supposed to represent
Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically, I'm-I'm-I'm, I'm supposed to represent

Ayo, peace Roots, East Coast niggas reppin' the streets most
With heat, toast, and keep close more Phillies than Pete Rose
These those niggas that'll lift your mentals
Lyrics'll twist your temples into pretzels
Like the Triumph instrumental
My instrumental's the Renaissance, no resem-ba-lance
To nothing you come across, lyrical holocaust
The crowd pleaser, emcees freeze then catch seizure
They praise the Lord of rap thesis, true believers
Just call me Baby Jesus, 'cause lately niggas be praising me
Just for the way I blaze the beat crazily, tape to CD lasery
It pays to be amazingly flavory
Gaze into my rhymes that basically hypnotize you occasionally
Occasionally as I focus on my next opus
The way it's all fucked up and emcees is hopeless
I'll leave your head wrecked as I erect sculptures
My thought's just a fortress
Approach this ferocious up-closeness

Lyrically, I'm supposed to represent
Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically, I'm-I'm-I'm, I'm supposed to represent

The Dream Shatterer,Capital Punishment,1998,"Ayo, I shatter dreams like Jordan, assault and batter your team
Your squadron'll be barred from rap like Adam and Eve from the garden
I'm carvin' my initials on your forehead
So every night before bed you see the BP shine off the boardhead
Reverse that,
 
I curse at the first wack nigga with the worst rap
'Cause he ain't worth jack
Hit him with a thousand pounds of pressure per slap
Make his whole body jerk back
Watch the Earth crack, hand him his purse back
I'm the first Latin rapper to baffle your skull
Master the flow, niggas be swearin' I'm blacker than coal
Like Nat King,
 
I be rappin' in tongues, packin' the ones
Magnums, cannons and Gatling guns
It's Big Pun, the one and only son of Tony Montana
You ain't promised mañana in the rotten manzana
Come on, pana, we need more rhymers
Feel the marijuana, snake bite, anaconda
A man of honor wouldn't wanna try to match my persona
Sometimes rhymin' I blow my own mind, like Nirvana
Comma, 
and go the whole nine like Madonna
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar

When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination

I'm pure adrenaline, uncut, straight to the gut, medicine
Raw cure for pain
, 
I coat your brain like polyurethane
Simple and plain, I'll explain it in layman terms
If you came to learn how to make fire, I'ma make it burn
Higher and hotter than lava, the scholar adviser
As smart as MacGyver could put honor inside the heart of a liar
Involved in a life of crime, fuck it, I like the shine
Up in the white and lime, comes with the pipe design
Plushed out (no doubt), both pockets about to bust out
If you not in it for the spinach, GET THE FUCK OUT!
Take a hike, we can even battle to make it right
Go 'head, lace the mic, you finished, SAY GOODNIGHT!
Head-to-head in the street, I'll leave you dead in your feet
Settlin' beef, I'll even let you rhyme to the ""Benjamins"" beat
But it won't matter, your dreams still gon' shatter
It's a long ladder to climb, and mine is on the stagger
So get outta town, 'fore I hit you with the 
loudest sound
You ever heard; 
Desert Bird, player, you outta bounds

When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination

You know the Pun'll diss you, if your whole steez is unofficial
I'll come and get you and let the Desert Eez tongue-kiss you
With one pistol and two clips, I'll make your crew do flips
Like acrobatics, I'm charismatic, my gat is magic
It makes rappers disappear, 
whisper in your ear, crystal clear
""Come here, let me kiss your tears!""
Everything you fear is here, you ain't got to search further
The first murder's the worst, now I thirst further
For reverse, birth
, every verse hurts, 
every curse word's
Already more offendin' than Eddie Murph's worst
I thirst for blood like a vampire
Any man claimin' his game's tighter IS A GODDAMN LIAR!!!
I set 'em on fire, retire your train of thought
Drain a quart of blood out ya brain and leave ya insane in the dark
The King of New York, lays his crown in the Boogie Down
And sprays the town with the MAC—hoodie down
I'm no joke, I'll soak your face with a sweeper
Die in disgrace or face your death through the speaker

When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination",https://genius.com/Big-pun-the-dream-shatterer-lyrics
Capital Punishment,Capital Punishment,1998,"It's mine, it's all mine you understand
At least me and my peoples
Can you dig that?
21st century, thought I'd never see it
Right around the corner, baby
Ours for the takin'
Yo

I've seen child blossom to man
Some withered and turned to murderers
Led astray by the liars death glorifiers observin' us
Watching us close, marketing host is here to purchase
Purposely overtaxin' the earnings
Nervous, burnin' down the churches
They're scared of us, rather beware than dare to trust
Throw us in jail, million dollar bail, left there to rust
Let's call in order, give ourselves a chance to enhance broader
Advance to where minorities are the majority voter
Holdin' my own, I'm livin' alone in this cold world
My sister just bought a home without a loan, you go girl
She's an exception, some people can leap to the impression
See, me myself, I start flippin' and fall victim to deep depression
I'm stressin' the issue here, so we can gross the fiscal year
Tired of gettin' fired and hired as a pistol-eer
There's no longevity livin' off negativity
Fuck it, I'd rather sell reefer than do pizza delivery
That's how the city be, everybody gettin' they hustle on
Judge singin' death penalty like it's his favorite fuckin' song
Word is bond, takin' my life you know they lovin' it
God, F the government and it's fuckin' capital punishment

Capital punishment, given by the government
System so organized they get to you and who you runnin' with
Can't live alone, watch for the spies and tapped phones
Totin' the llello for life, the rightful heir to the throne
We come from Kings and Queens, people with dreams, Gods and Earths
For what it's worth, we benefit the Earth with infinite worth
First it's turnin' tables, open our own labels
Disable the Republicans, then reverse capital punishment

I've seen it all up close, shit out the movies you'd be buggin'
My cousin Chuchi, barely a juve', lost it and turned on the oven
He wasn't playin', blew out the flame and started inhalin'
Baring a secret too deep to keep on the street for sharin'
Wearin' the virus, Acquired Immune Deficiency
Dishin' his dick in every thick promiscuous fish in the sea
Listen to me, shit is rough in the ghetto
You bluff, blow your head off, fuck a snuff, we bust lead off
Get off your high horse or die off like an extinction
Boriquans are like Mohicans, The Last of the Po'Ricans
We need some unity, fuck all the Jeeps and jewelry
The maturity, keeps me six feet, above obscurity
The streets are deadly and everybody's a desperado
I guess tomorrow ain't promised unless you're Amish and death's your motto
Like Zorro, I mark my territory with a symbol
Not with a Z, but a P, 'cause Punishment's what I resemble
I lend you this if it expands yours, for you and yours
A real man can't fall, he stands tall
The Man's claws are diggin' in my back,
 
I'm tryin' to hit him back
Time to counteract, where my niggas at?

Capital punishment, given by the government
System so organized they get to you and who you runnin' with
Can't live alone, watch for the spies and tapped phones

For what it's worth, we benefit the Earth with infinite worth
First it's turnin' tables, open our own labels
Disable the Republicans, then reverse capital punishment

You like that, it's Pun and Prospect
We hold nines, own more treasure than gold mines, makin' progress
With Don Juan's, there's rules to be made, crews to be sprayed
Dues to be paid, nothin' y'all can do to behave
We laid in the slums, made a cake out of crumbs
Even though the government, tryin' to take out our sons
Rudy Gulliani trying to blind me, but I see reality
Was raised with the street mentality
My strategy's why my battery never die
The ghetto kept me wise, so I would never fall to the lies
It's no surprise, but do or die if you want the glamour
Yeah, I want the glamour, laid up with cheese and trees in Atlanta
While Cuban's smoked out like Ronald Isley with Havanas
The hammer in the palm, never shaky, calm handlers
This renegade blow through barricades like grenades
I turn the sun to shade, then the night back to day
Like the twenty-four hour rotation
I know the location, it's just a little in-for-mation
From the Squad, bringing the Terror for the nine-era
And let it rain on your fine leather, nigga, what?",https://genius.com/Big-pun-capital-punishment-lyrics
Boomerang,Capital Punishment,1998,"Niggas is flossing a lot, time to start extorting the block
Just a portion of the prod' off the top for my Porsche and my yacht
Something for the cops to keep 'em blind, so we can grind
With peace of mind, turn the key and shine without being dimed
Time to expand, New York to Chicago, Colorado
You know my motto, clock G's and rock keys like Drago
Pablo Escobar and Dom Pérignon
We're buying out the bar and Don Juanin' and every woman's Chandonin'
Long donging 'em down like Sean Michaels does 'em
I'm like a psycho fucking
Sucking the butt like liposuction
Up and down with the tongue twister
C'mon on sister Big Pun's Mr. ""cock and squeeze"" like a gun tester
Crushing sister's backs with the demon snap, hit you from the back
Close your eyes relax, let me feed the cat
Living fat, true mack, niggas was catching feelings
Dealing with a smaller deck, just wasn't as mass appealing
I started feeling funny, niggas coming short with money
I called my son he, told me chill he'd be over in twenty
Punny what's the deal, niggas wanna kill me
He said it's real, they jealous and tired of seeing me Willie silly
Had more to claim, niggas throwing shit in the game
Gave my wife some pictures with me and bitches running the train
It's like a dream, I called my team and started flipping
Lock the clip in started lifting niggas off the ground like a magician
I skipped town, be back around when things quiet down
I lost it all for now but it'll take more to hold me down
(""Top of the world ma! Ha ha, top of the world!"")

Yo, this is the bad time - boomerang, bring it all back
Flashback, live and prosper, eat well and get fat
I was Pop Dula, popular to the masses
I miss the E-Classes, rocking game with death glasses
Rock bottom struck and threw my world off its axis
Boomerang - plan to come back like Bronx rap
Storm like the Redcoats through anything in my path
First you shine like sterling, then you broke like brick in Berlin

Now should I slit my wrists, go for it all or call it quits
Picture me taking my life, leaving my wife and my daughter shit
Wish I could slip back, and switch the memories
Lift the felonies from my record and respected my enemies
Live like the Kennedies, above the law
Fuck 'em all, I'm coming for the rich thieving 'em even if I wasn't poor
I seen it all like I said before
The streets are for men at war and the beasts are the predators
I shed it all first and be the primary source
Of course, I bury any adversary trying to floss
Just because, the reason I leave 'em lost in the sauce
Teeing off like we up North just for being soft
A beaten horse like a slave getting minimum wage
Feeling the gauge, front page, these are the last days
Cash pays, and rules - the root of all evil
Shooting amigos for loot and perico polluting our people
Moving kilos like it's all good through every ghetto
I ain't judging, but bugging how we fall so many levels
The devils got us by the balls
That's why the law allows the drugs to overflood, knowing we gonna buy it all
It's time to call a world order where every girl's your daughter
And priceless as ices and pearls fresh out the water
I'm gonna get mine, either from crime, or through the Bible
Whichever way, it better pay, I'm feeling suicidal

Yo, this is the bad time - boomerang, bring it all back
Flashback, live and prosper, eat well and get fat
I was Pop Dula, popular to the masses
I miss the E-Classes, rocking game with death glasses
Rock bottom struck and threw my world off its axis

Punish Me,Capital Punishment,1998,"I was the luckiest man on Earth, my wisdom was worth
Any purse but had a curse that hurt worse than giving birth
My first verse explains some of the games she was playing
I'm blaming myself 'cause in my wealth was where her pain would haven
Behaving like a money-hungry hooker, funny how the money took her
From a average honey to a stunning looker
I look back and reminisce how we used to kiss
And smash hips in the GS I bought her last Christ'
She got too big for her britches but The Bridge is Over
Not the one in Queens, I mean the one she dreaming wasn't sober
Told her how I felt, gassed me when she cried for help
Supplied the guilt trip and I was whipped without a fucking belt
I felt stupid Cupid struck me with a poison arrow
Should have drowned you when I found you crushing in my boy's Camaro
I didn't bother but you probably find your lover dead
You robbed me of my honor, you ain't shit like my mother said

Come back come back come back come back to me
Punisher punish me
I've been so bad, so bad
Won't you come back, please

Nah baby, I'm not gonna be able to do it, you blew it
Threw it all the way 'cause you was stupid, girl why'd you do it?
I mighta knew it by the way you gave me your baby
Then left a day before I ever saw the son that God made me
It's hard maybe we can make amends, be friends
We're only hurting all of us for certain by forsaking him
Just take it in, don't even say a word, observe the way you were
Preserved, these words so you won't play the herb
Ever again, never pretend that he doesn't have a father
I'm always there and you don't wanna bother
I honor my word on my father's grave, guide him through his hardest age
So he can thrive and survive in these modern days
I wanna raise my little man but you keep resisting
I'm insisting you chill for real before you come up missing
Listen, I don't wanna fight I'd rather do what's right
A boy needs a father that's the most important part of his life

Come back come back come back come back to me
Punisher punish me
I've been so bad, so bad
Won't you come back (come back baby)
Come back come back come back come back to me
Punisher punish me
I've been so bad, so bad
Won't you come back, please

I gave you everything, love letters and sweaters with leather seams
Feathered wings and rings with emeralds right out of Geraldine's
Several dreams of cream fulfilled, the green Deville
Cadillac to mack, matter fact redeemed to bill
I mean for real, I ain't playing mami
How you wanna stay Armani fresh, giving the next nigga my punani?
You want me back 'cause he hit it wrong, now you wanna get it on
With the Long Don, word is bond my shit is strong
(Come back) Girl don't even start again, I beg your pardon
And get your hands off my six-button Cardigan
This ain't no love lost between us far as I'm concerned
Please leave, cut that busted weave I've been dying to burn
Go buy a perm, try and earn some respect
It's better to have loved and lost than to live with regret

Come back (come back baby)... to, me
I want you to

Come back come back come back come back to me
Punisher punish me
I've been so bad, so bad
Won't you come back
Come back come back come back come back to me
Punisher punish me
I've been so bad, so bad
Won't you come back

To me, yeah yeah
Alright, don't go, no
Ohhhhhahahaooahhoahhohhh, hmmmmmm ohh hmmm hmm
Yeahhhhhhhhh, take my hand, and punish me
Hmm, been so bad, come punish me, yeahh
Take my hand, and punish me, ohhh
Been so bad, come punish me, oh, oh, oh",https://genius.com/Big-pun-punish-me-lyrics

Give you a red shirt with the wet hat to match
Burst macs like it's Hamburger Hill for real
It's Red Dawn when the Mobb get it on
My outfit

We move gambit through the overcrowded
Forthwith, pull out long fifths, extended clips
Point the nozzle and shift your back disc

Slit your snake tongue, make one false maneuver - you a mystery
Unsolved, the mob that revolves automatically involved
Musclebound sounds surround commercial thugs
Rock 
turtledove Bowery suits
 and purple gloves
Me and you can have some fun, make it a blast
You couldn't take the impact with steel shoulder pads
Blood for blood, 
veteran covered in mud
Wounded in the midst of war,
 still tradin' slugs, gettin' major love
Way above you newcomers
I come thunderin' with the heat of two summers
When I enter the zone, 
move mountains with the presence alone
Before the words
 rip through the microphone

Foil your plans, boil your grams, take your shine
Fold all your hands, spoil your mans, make him mine
Take all you made, call you gay on Hot 97
Drop by your dwellin', got the nueve right behind your melon
Ain't no tellin' when the bullet's behind the trigger
I do it to live niggas and Pulitzer Prize winners
You wouldn't survive, nigga, if I chose you
Froze you from ear to ear, showin' your whole vocal

Glamour Life,Capital Punishment,1998,"[Intro: Cuban Link & 
Big Pun
]
(
Uh
) Glamour life style baby (
dum dum dum dum
), bottle the rocks (
yeah yeah
)
Freeze the ice, 100 mil kid, 
money, money, money, mo'
Platinum status, (word word, yeah, what up?, what up?)
Stick around

Yo, I plan to live a life a-glamour
Like my man Tony Montana
Stand and pose in front of cameras
With my golden silk pajamas on
Smoking havanas, drinking Don P
Thinking beyond deeper than Gandhi,
 while I'm in the Diamante
Counting my G's, I'm out to be a millionaire
Dipped in gear, flickin' hundred dollar bills in the air
Oh yeah, Cuban Link is into getting Benjamins
Cause if doesn't make dollars, then it doesn't make sense
I represent, I meant to be the king of New York
Went from living in tenements to a penthouse resort
I'm the Latino, that'll take you to war like Al Pacino
Even DeNiro know not to gamble in my 
Casino
Vino on the rocks, lobster dinners with mobsters
I got shit locked from Prospect Ave' to the tropics
Sitting on top of the world like the sun
A living legend from the Bronx, second to none, unless it's Pun

It's the glamour life, blow up the kids and the wife
Players who ain't half as nice swear to, but they sacrifice
Bottle the rock, freeze the ice, stash the dope and rice
And get ready for the glamour life
[Verse 2: Triple Seis & 
(Big Pun)
]
Ripped off from the Infiniti
Dump the body an' the shottie down the lake, leaving no identity
Just the memory, a casualty as I casually make move on my rivalries
All eyes I be, on the quest for loot
Pushing a Lexus coupe, to pursuit them troops, against the big-joker
Sipping alimoca, playing poker with some chocha
Heard an approacher, must be fam, or the hammer have to smoke Pun
(Get the motherfucking guns)
Since now I've become the one wanted for a lump sum of G's
Dirty rats pack gats for cheese
Bullets of breeze at light speed
Taking your pretty wife life and sacrificing your seeds
Indeed, we let him bleed for 50 G's
Ship his body to the states, filled with 50 ki's
Please, no remorse for your two face
As I assemble my rifle out the motherfucking suitcase
You about to take who's place? Not Seis...
Your body'll be laced, and left without a trace

The glamour life, the glamour life, yo
It's the glamour life, blow up the kids and the wife
Players who ain't half as nice swear to, but they sacrifice
Bottle the rock, freeze the ice, stash the dope and rice
And get ready for the glamour life

Yo, it's the motherfucking Don Cartagena
The leader, Terror Squad cleaner
Leave your family crying for you like Argentina,
 Mira
Street dreamer like Nas
, my entourage is thick
Camouflaged in this bitch, so God forbid you start some shit
My squad's equipped with an arsenal of ammunition
Hollow tips an', cop killers with the carved initialin'
Accounts in Switzerland for rainy days
Nigga I'm staying paid, you's a joke
Always broke with your lazy ways
Anyway, back to the subject, in the bub-Lex
In the back seat, having rough sex
I love this glamorous life I live, having the ice and shit
Think twice, I give Christ your kids
I live life for gifts, keep the five burning while the tires turning
I blaze an L and seek a higher learning
Kaiser's learnin' everything illegally
We could be friend for years, cross me once that’s thievery

The glamour life, blow up the kids and the wife
Players who ain't half as nice swear to, but they sacrifice
Bottle the rock, freeze the ice, stash the dope and rice
And get ready for the glamour life

Yo, the dough, the rap, the audience, party heavy 'til the 40's in
Ill 
like the Yakuza run the Orient
Take all the rent, an old man wept the path his daughter went
Dicks with the Fallopian, wide as auditorium
She fuck for dough for opium, 
prostitute emporium
500 Benz, 500 friends sell Cambodian
8 cups of vodka, 4 cups of juice for sodium
Money, money, sweet as the smell of 
magnolia
It gets you 
dime bitches spitting image of Apollonia
Now how can I go broke, 
pumping twenties of coke
Plus songs I wrote, 
milkin' dumb honies I poke
The young blood sat on the bench in 
Vant Courtland
, slingin'
Singing how he trying to get cash for Jordans
Another cat toss his Beamer to get the insurance
Currency's gonna murder me... it's never enough
Breakin' my ass gettin' it, just as fast as I spend the stuff
Calling Uncle Sam's bluff dun, taxes don't bite us, bite us....

My life... yo, it's the glamour life, blow up the kids and the wife
Players who ain't half as nice swear to, but they sacrifice
Bottle the rock, freeze the ice, stash the dope and rice
And get ready for the glamour life

The glamour life, play precise, defense is tight
I'm out to settle the score, let's do it right
Enough for looking at grave, it's paying back tonight
Yo Twin pass the lye, pass the light
The glamour life, this life I live is trife as shit
Least my wife and kid got somewhere nice to live
I used to live in the gutter, me and my mother
Now she's fifty years old, pushing a hummer
The glamour life, hand me a knife I'll slice and dice
Men or Mice, send them to Christ in the after life
Pass the mic down the line, let them hear it
Let them fear it, send it screaming to the Holy Spirit

Glamour life, the glamour life, the glamour life
It's the glamour life, yo it's the glamour, it's the glamour life
The glamour life, the glamour life, the glamour life
Cock the hammer, 
end
 his motherfucking life, bitch",https://genius.com/Big-pun-glamour-life-lyrics

From rappin' on the corner to possibly goin' platinum

Yo, I'll be ready to ride and I'll be ready to die

Ay-yo, my word is bond
Long as I'm alive, I'mma put it on
Coulda gone to jake, shit, thug nigga 'til I'm gone
Weight of the Bronx, I'm flippin
Five boroughs thoroughly reppin'
Let's unite the city and step to the world as a weapon
'Cause everybody's checkin' for Pun, second to none
'Cause Latins goin' platinum was destined to come
The inevitable, heavenly, better than whatever you do
We eligible, TS is incredibly credible
For the revenue, we gettin' you open with lyrical dope
And these breaths that are potent is like an injectional dose
And it never quits
Take it from TS's top terrorist
Rapper slash hijacker, bombin' tracks ever since
I was young, I wasn't always Big Pun
It wasn't always this fun, ay-yo, I rose from the slums
I had to pay my due, lay a few
But I ain't sayin' who, stayin' true to the game
No names,
 playin' it cool, just me and the crew
Holdin' it down long as we round
We gonna keep sockin' it to you, like Homey D. Clown
Goin' down like 'Pac, ready to ride or die, nigga

Ay-yo, ain't nothin' changed, I'm still the same
The way you remembered me, since the centipede
Harder, big blacker, back in the 70's
Try to remember me from my aggressive will
The way I kept it real is more important than any record deal
I used to chill on the block with Cuban and Seis
I still do, but now it's in the blue convertible eight-- fifty
My true niggas'll always be wit' me
The shifty kiss me, tell me they miss me, then try to diss me
'Cause I'm a rispy, crispy for life, sixtie's the price
Another fifty for the Cuban twisted in ice
Niggas is sheist, but I psych 'em out
Though they like to doubt
I make 'em all believers, once I let the Tyson out
'Cause I can vouch for only a few, only the crew
From the old school, I consider loyally true
I morally grew from a fool to a scholar
Follow the rules on how to spot a plotter
That's cool for a dollar
I wanna holla at my peeps that's reppin' the streets
Wrestlin' the beast of chest, restin' in peace
Blessin' my seeds and watchin' over us
'Til I die, I'll align the souls with mine and shine for all of us

Out for the fast cash, level advance
Takin' a chance,
 I've only got one, my hundred shot
Tommy shotguns my judge, jury and Johnny Cochran

Movin' on the stash, first we get the cash
For the fast money, I smash the niggas' shit like a crash dummy
Ask money where the safe, anybody move gettin' laced
Look at my face and I'ma shoot the place

Ayo the plot thickens, I'm pickin' the locks in the back entrance
Payin' attention, not tryin' to get knocked and catch a fat sentence
Not to mention these kids is mafioso with lots of dough so
They got the popo locked with a Don ""The Rock"" Muraco chokehold
 (oh oh)
Their security system's linear laser protection
No sweat, I brought the miniature mirrors for reflectin'
Inspectin' the vault for weapon's assault, second of course
It's poison, it sprays, boiled and baked in Epsom salt
Reppin' New York is the cat burglar, the fat murderer
Slippin' the clip in the MAC, inserterer
Hurtin' your pockets, droppin' your stock to zero profit
Holdin' heroes hostage and mansions for ransom like De Niro mob flicks
Back to the topic at hand, the grand prize
The safe flies open, the shine almost blinded my eyes
I cracked the code, enough ice to make you laugh at gold
Passed the dough to Cuban, started movin' for the back, let's go
That's when I heard the sirens, hopin' that my ears was lyin'
Knew we was dyin' when I saw the guard we tortured cryin'
Pointin' at the building screamin', ""I can see them, kill 'em!""
Snipers was willing but couldn't, there's too many civilians
Still inside, nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
Cuban said, ""Fuck it, we die, we die busting our guns""

Oye castigador, saca el fucking cañon
Vamos pa la guerra, vamos señarlo!
A castigarlos!

Movin' on the stash, first we get the cash
For the fast money, I smash the niggas' shit like a crash dummy
Ask money where the safe, anybody move gettin' laced
Look at my face and I'ma shoot the place
Movin' on the stash, first we get the cash
For the fast money, I smash the niggas' shit like a crash dummy
Ask money where the safe, anybody move gettin' laced
Look at my face and I'ma shoot the place

Ayo it's time to pay, and I ain't trying to give my shine away
Let's show these pigs how much we give a fuck about the brighter day
I cock the Eagle, Cuban drew the Glock, it was diesel
Said, ""See you in Hell coppers"" and started poppin' like it was legal
We need a plan, if we can make it to the van
Missile launchers there with the grenade pistol I bought from Uncle Dan
Me and my man are runnin' out of ammo, 
I got about a handful of Black Rhinos
 and 
two Rambos strapped to my ankles
I trampled over one of the bodies, I grabbed the steel
Threw the bitch over my shoulder and used her butt as a shield
I filled the clip with the little bit of bullets remaining
Cuban said, ""Move your fat ass faster motherfucker, they gaining""
I gave him the case, told him, ""Go 'head, save yourself
Blaze a L in my memory, tell the family I gave 'em Hell""
For real, that's when I heard the tires screechin'
Peeped and it was Joe the God with twenty Terror Squad niggas reachin'

Parental Discretion,Capital Punishment,1998,"Ayo, I'm hard to talk to
I
f you live, I probably fought you
Stalked you where you walked to at night
Caught you then tried to extort you
New York niggas is trigger happy, 
got Pataki scared
This town ain't big enough for both of us and I ain't goin' nowhere!
There it is, plain and simple
Like Jigga, my game is mental
While slow niggas better know I blow their brains out they temples
I'm into black magical torture
Romantic, dramatical author
Compatible with the average New Yorker
A fast talker, like Tony when he gassed Sosa
The masked enforcer, 
out for the cash and the cho-cha
Smash the coca, bottle it up, watch the fiends gobble it up
If I roll up, you do what? Swallow the stuff
I don't give a fuck anymore
I'm only twenty-four years old and I've already broken every law
I'm horrorcore, this is for the heads
Runnin' up in your crib, now if you still hidin' under the bed

Parental discretion advised, cover your eyes
Little kids -- get out of here! This shit's is homicide!
Drugs and money, this ain't no Bugs Bunny!
Little girls too; this ain't for you, it's for the thugs honey

Ayo, my shit's the truth, 150 proof, no question
Parental discretion advised, keep out the eyes of the youth
It's too explicit, bullshit! I challenge the statistics
Violence existed before our music was even suggested
Arrested on sight, it's like there's no rights
That's why I rhyme so aggressive and bring every message to life
I fight the power,
 spite the power the 90 percent
Keep 10 and feed Twin half for personal reasons
The seasons change, things re-arrange, but I stay the same
I play the game for the wealth, until I've made myself a name
So blame it all on the gangster rapper, 
thanks to Joey Crack
For the chance to do it my way like Frank Sinatra
I ain't an actor so it's all facts, strictly raw rap
Totally intended for yours dressed in all black
With the ski mask or the pantyhose
Makin' cameos
 in liquor store cameras with the twin Calicos

Parental discretion advised, cover your eyes
Little kids -- get out of here! This shit's is homicide!
Drugs and money, this ain't no Bugs Bunny!
Little girls too; this ain't for you, it's for the thugs honey
Parental discretion advised, cover your eyes
Little kids -- get out of here! This shit's is homicide!
Drugs and money, this ain't no Bugs Bunny!
Little girls too; this ain't for you, it's for the thugs honey

So forget the boom
One look, you shook -- you know I'm stickin' you
Liftin' you off the ground, look down -- that's where I'm puttin' you
Look in my eyes and remember me, how does it feel mentally
Havin' the enemy be the last thing you ever see?
The recipe is death and I'm the chef, fricasseein' your flesh
Be my guest, but I ain't cleanin' the mess
Me and TS,
 we testin' niggas faith just to see they face
Expression when destined to states, that death be in the case
I'm in the state of grace, in the hated race, by the pagan face
Couldn't fight us, made a virus, gave us AIDS
I paint the wake 'cause they ain't get me yet
Wet me or reflect me yet
I know they comin', they just tryin' to let me sweat
I recollect when I was just a boy, eatin' Chips Ahoy!
Wasn't allowed to raise my voice, now I'm makin' noise
No more toys, strictly MACs and missiles
Shorties with forties
 packin' pistols
Catchin' bodies makes you official
So they say, I pray there's a better way
My kids don't do as I do, they do as I say, 'cause daddy don't play

Parental discretion advised, cover your eyes
Little kids -- get out of here! This shit's is homicide!
Drugs and money, this ain't no Bugs Bunny!
Little girls too; this ain't for you, it's for the thugs honey
Parental discretion advised, cover your eyes
Little kids -- get out of here! This shit's is homicide!
Drugs and money, this ain't no Bugs Bunny!
Little girls too; this ain't for you, it's for the thugs honey

Word is bond
One thing about MCs is that we don't conceal the truth
We present real pictures about the positive and the negative
So don't blame the hip-hop
When your seed is learnin' the real life from us
Do your duty at home and raise your child in the house
Parents, you don't do your job
We gonna put your children to bed at nine o'clock
Past your bedtime
You get your ass in bed, you ain't 'posed to be hearin' this shit

Yo, wanna rumble with the Pun, huh
*blows raspberry* Shit on the whole industry
Who puff more Owls than Pun?
 Pile on more styles than Pun?
Who the only one with over a thousand guns?
Running up in niggas cribs like I paid the bill
Make you squeal the combination to the safe for wealth
I lace your grill with the firestarter
Hit your wife with the sawed off in the shower, power-drive ya daugther
I'm all about the fundamentals like Pun and pencil
A piece of paper, a decent caper and someone to strafe you
My mental's compatible with the radicals
My odyssey type qualities allow me to poli' with animals
Niggas is cannibals and the ghetto's the jungle
Where you either bet all your bundles or struggle or live civil and humble
My niggas'll rumble with any man for a Benny Fran'
Try to imagine what they can fathom for twenty grand
Niggas'll slice you and dice you into a thousand pieces
We pound out weak shit into the ground Uptown
Up in the Boogie Down we just wallow in jean, pile on the green
Surrounded in green like flowers in Spring
But now I'm a King, so it's more than money
All the honies used to call me Punny
'Cause my fam was always hungry
But now we rolling lovely and you feel worse
Want my money, let your steel burst
'Cause I'd rather see you in Hell first

Huh, I'm Uptown making moves just like Castro

Yo, yo, yo keep the lights, keep the camera, all I want is the action
The battle's on, where I roam in composition
A hardcore crowd waiting to see if I break
Like your first time in jail when you got fucked by an inmate
It'll never happen, I'm on balance like a Libra
And if I get murdered, 
Don't Cry For Me Argentina
Pour me a cup of vodka, bury me next to my father
In three days, I'll rise like Christ and still sober
Now my eyes open in my hands I got the Gatling
I'm looking for the guy that sent me to say hi to Satan
Fists of fury,
 
you wouldn't like me when I'm angry
I turn Mr. Roger's Neighborhood topsy turvy
Foes and enemies meaning the same in the dictionary
This ain't Pictionary, all you see is the cemetery
Bodies from World War I and II is there
You don't want a third war, that's nuclear warfare
So Big Pun, count the stacks, make it fast
Illegal money turns legal now we running a laundromat
Your hunchbacked and wack rap is packed in your backpack
You're better off in D.C. with the mayor smoking crack
This ain't a diss, Wyclef bomb threat
Run out of the building or get blast in your Guess
TEC for TEC or we can go text for text, oh
I forgot, you don't read so take this hole in your chest - blaow!
Hide the blood, give you the gun, run and hide
So when the DT shows up, he thought it was a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide...

To whom it may concern, fuck you
I tear the cushion out the turnbuckle
And pow above you on your face until it turn purple
I hurt you and make shit messy like Kevin Nash
I'm big and sexy, but I relent your ass, bitch test me
Police arrest me on a daily basis, X's on scary faces
To them we all look the same like a pair of races
Instead of races, and where the slaves?
Still searching for better days
Don't feel sorry for me, that's the little things
Don't be afraid kid I know it's hard
Just remember to roll with God
And try not to kill yourself, like Owen Hart
No disrespect I know you miss a bet
But it's just some shit I rhyme about nigga so don't flip on some wrestler shit
Cause I'm a lover and a fighter
A punisher, a rider, Big Punisher one of the last survivors
So pass the highest levels, still ignoring the humble
Won't avoid me in the jungle cause my niggas roar when they rumble

We gonna break, rumble, crash, brawl
Make the crowd roar 'til they askin for more
We gonna break, rumble, crash, brawl
Terror Squad, we gonna take 'em to war
We gonna break, rumble, crash, brawl
Make the crowd roar 'til they askin for more
We gonna break, rumble, crash, brawl
Terror Squad, we gonna take 'em to war

They call me Joe the God
A true warrior like Owen Hart
Smash the face off your neck, rip you to broken parts
You niggas know the squad
Over-flood your whole facade
Just like a scene straight out of Noah's Ark
So who's next for the death flock
Give me your best shot
Hit you with some shit that leave your breath stopped
Respect Crack, I'm the best that done it
One of the the lest confront it
It seems like none of these wrestlers want it
I'm like Hollywood without the Hogan
I'm like Conan without the slogan
Don't make me bust you open
I'll leave you frozen from the cheek down
Hang you up beat down
Then spit in your face, how the cheeks now?
We can meet now, or save it for the full brawl
However you want, I never front, I'm all yours
And the God know the Coliseum
Watch me hop off the Mausoleum
And drop so hard, y'all can barely see him

We gonna break, rumble, crash, brawl
Make the crowd roar 'til they askin for more
We gonna break, rumble, crash, brawl
Terror Squad, we gonna take 'em to war
We gonna break, rumble, crash, brawl
Make the crowd roar 'til they askin for more
We gonna break, rumble, crash, brawl

Aww shit.. smooth it out
Where my chick tonight? Thug style
Knock em out Pun!
I pull your motherfuckin plug like a thug's supposed ta
Hold a loaded toast, who want the pistol smoke
Cause I'll initial on my shoulder holster
You know the culture when it's East coast, we run the streets most
Who want beef? Turn your peeps into meatloaf
You know the steez, when it's murder in third degrees
We reserve the breeze, and move with the wind like birds and bees
Word to G's, Christ I'm nice, g'head roll the dice
You know the price, your kid and your crib, like I'm +Poltergeist+
I'm cold as ice, control your life with the mic
And then take your crown, break you down like liquid nitrogen
Invite your men, I strike your chin while you rappin
If you're on some thug shit, fill my clip and start clappin
Make your heart flatten, stop actin retarded
All you flea hearted villains, build your rhythm over restart it
The streets are God and heavenly, where the vinyls doubles
Forty-fives and shovels ready in the five livest boroughs

Yo, I'm a thug to the heart, bugged from the start ever since a child
I've been livin wild, chillin with illest crowds
Splittin thous' on my connect in the street
Twenty-percent protection, expected at the end of the week
Never we sleep, a thug doesn't rest
Cause a wise man said, it was a cousin of death
If it wasn't the stress, it was one to your chest
There's many ways to die, in the slums when you stressed
But not me, Big P, cause I'm the son of the devil
Run up in your cribbo and suffocate your son with a pillow
You know I'm comin to kill you when you hear the heavy breathin
Give you a wedgie deep in your deep end with a butcher machete greetin
Thinkin of Madison Square, I'll battle you there
Carry you clear 'cross the planet just to challenge you here
Embarass you where it hurts, and sandwich you in a hearse
God sent you with a curse, that's why your parachute didn't work
Dead in the dirt (yup) with the bugs and the mice
That's the price, frontin like a thug for life

Yo, me and my man are plannin to handle these two broads
Thought he was Rambo a vandal his brand a Lambor' Countache
With ammo that scrambled his brains and luxury ducats
Harder with somethin hard to sharpen
In the driver's box of the glove compartment
Rotten lowdown dirty sheisty kind of conniver
Ex nine-to-fiver, ready to die as long as I'm the driver
Supplyin buyers of flyers in bundles stacked dope
Humble prices on ices twice as nice as crumbled crack coke
I hope it lasts long, word bond, I bring my brothers with me

Got the Glizzy locked in the stizzy
Pop the clizzy, going sixty down a one-wizzy
Drunk pissy, tryin' to cruise through the avenue
While my peoples is poppin' bottles up in Sue's Rendevous
Fuck that! Spun the U-ey, lost a hubcap
It's back to the shack, came back in a ""What's that?""
Straight from Paris, checkin' Gaby's new baby carriage
Perry Ellis, auburn cherry reddish
Fresh out the dealer, got the TEC for the squealers
Wear a vest for the killers, nothin' less, ‘cause it's realer
In the Big Apple, where it's quick to get your shit tackled
Enemies spit at you, best friends kidnap you
Trust no one; got beef, bust yo' gun
You don't need no one talking 'bout that you owe him
I'ma go for dolo; Scarface without Manolo
One deep, I be solo, bustin' heat, throwin' bolos, it's hard

And it's so hard, yeah
Niggas wanna be like Pun
But they don't bust they guns
And it's so hard
Niggas wanna fuck my wife
Nggas wanna take my life

I ain't goin' nowhere

Get your own! Your own, ya heard?

Rollin' with the Squad, we like Gods
Catch us at the bar-de-bar-de-bars, strip bars in Miami
Almost came home with the Grammy
Next year, bringing home three for the family

Poppin' shit like a Nazi, iced out like DeBiase
Fuck that! Liberace, fo'-X Versace, somebody stop me!
Never that! SKEE-YU! Where my niggas at?
Uptown, uptown, you know you feelin' that
Cash rule, hardcore you can dance to
That old Biggie give me, One More Chance
Take a glance and I'm off with yours
With both hands take off my drawers
And jerk me like the Source Awards

Niggas wanna be like Pun
But they don't bust they guns
And it's so hard
Niggas wanna fuck my wife
Nggas wanna take my life

What you say your name was again?
And I know you from where? Elementary school?
I don't know you, man!
Money, not you again, go that way!

Yeah, you ain't fucking my wife, takin' my life
And if you just hatin', just walk on by
All you haters just walk on by
See, me and Big Pun be rollin'

That chose to be the dumb nigga at the party
Too much Bacardi started speakin' dumb
Then you tried to snuff Joe, must have been Puerto Rican rum
That's the hardcore, two years a sophomore
Takes years to earn a pair of Terror Squad balls
So get lost or take one, bones I break them
Pigs are bacon, so get fried if they come
You see that? I'm like G. Rap, 'Pac, Master P
All balled up with a twist of Marc Anthony
Recognize me I'm the one that's cockin' the auto
Tony Sunshine please canten el coro

Pronto llegara, el dia de mi suerte
Te lo juro por mi gente
Te juro que un dia llegara
And we won't stop
We always knew we'd make it
Even though you player hated
We still made it to the top
 It ain't over
 I thought you ain't like the beat
 Te digo que no se ha acabado

La tierra del Borinquen donde nacido yo
Aha aha aha aha..
Es un jardin florido de magico primor
Aha aha aha aha aha aha aha...
Un cielo siempre nitido, que sirve de dosel
Y dan arrullos placidos, las olas a sus pies

Pronto llegara, el dia de mi suerte
Te lo juro por mi gente
Te juro que un dia llegara
And we won't stop
We always knew we'd make it
Even though you player hated
We still made it to the top

Leather Face,Yeeeah Baby,2000,"What I gotta do let y'all niggas know
I am THE. NICEST. EVER!
Hardcore.. Commercial... What you wanna do?
You wanna wile up, you wanna dance?
Don't matter to me, I got it all locked down baby

It's not a game it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall
When I bring the chain with the saw
Bring the pain to your door like death was knockin'
Unless you got my ends 
I'ma make you twins with the Headless Horseman
Hell extortion, sell your soul, live your dreams
Don't pay the cost then {*bam bam*}
Say hello to the guillotine
A killer fiends for blood
Screams of thugs like
Fiends for drugs
I don't need no love
Give me your fear, money, respect, beer, honeys and sex
We're here
I'll bend them checks for years, hungry and stressed
You fuckin' with Chris - fuck Pun - dead the wrath for later
Get your calculator, the head decapitator's back forever
Can't count how many heads I had to sever
Half the niggas I keep
I put em back together
That's the terror, cut open your girl
And make a truss out her flesh, like Buffalo Bill
You fuckin' with reel to reel, rap axe maniac
Sound bwoy killer
Hack hack chain-react
Two for one - double the death, same price
What would Big say?
""Huh, you know that ain't right""

It's not a game pah (Now the leg huh?)
We're gettin paid hah (Now the leg huh?)
It's still T-Squad (Now the leg huh?)
What you came for
Surgery, with a chainsaw

Word to Pac and BIG
My Glock so big it can rock a bridge
Drop the midsection like the top of your wig
Ain't no bullshittin, getting the full treatment
Special two heated missiles, 'til your crew's leaving witchu
I rip you in half - blast that ass through a glass window
Laugh a little (HA HA) and dash in the S-Class limo
That's how we do it in the South Boogie
Where tough rough rookies get snuffed out, for talking loud to me
Why should I even consider your crew
Shit on your crew
Get rid of your crew, what I'm fitting to do
I split you in two, leave you impaired when I blast the shotty
Rip it like dope and leave you there with half your body
We Rowdy like Roddy
, probably robbing your stash
Catch a body like Charlie up North
Stashing knives up my ass
Surviving the task, we the last ones left
Blast them tecs with clips, fast as vets that spit
Add some tips for any, bastard bitch, pappin shit
Watch me rep til the casket from the bassinet, biatch!
Ahora tu!

My Turn,Yeeeah Baby,2000,"Psssh.. it's my turn, y'knahmean?
Get this motherfuckin money y'know?
Shit..
Yeah I went double, y'know?
Niggas is goin' triple-five-ten platinum
Can't do what I do
This is my game, this is me
(T. Squaders) Y'know?

Yo it's my turn, I demand my respect
Give me my burn, or get slammed in your neck
'Cause it's my turn, I'mma reach to the top
Gimme my burn, I'mma speak with the Glock
'Cause it's my turn, don't make me turn your wig
Gimme my burn, don't make me burn yo' crib
I'mma rhyme it right, and keep the ghetto in a trance
But when the time is right, me and the devil gon' dance

Fuck you and yours, make way I'm comin' through the door
And screw the law, breakin' the rules ain't nothin' new at all
I'm true to all the shit that I done, check the clip in my gun
Respect the clique that I'm from, or get lifted or somethin'
Dunn, you just a small fry, fuckin' with the fall guy
Big Pun, the Honorable, all rise
Sky's the limit, nothin' less if my guys is in it
For the right price, even Christ could get it
Fast life we live it, all my memories are vivid
I remember only minutes, that's how I mentally get rid of all the enemies
The spirits that definitely mimic my every melody
And lyric which so heavenly rhythmic
In magic do I build, but math do be equally compatible
And secretively battle you to reach my peak in equilateral
I'm from the streets deep in the barrio ain't no Mario Brothers
Official Bronx niggas, quick to body yo' mother (ouch)

Yo it's my turn, I demand my respect
Give me my burn, or get slammed in your neck
'Cause it's my turn, I'mma reach to the top
Gimme my burn, I'mma speak with the Glock

Gimme my burn, don't make me burn yo' crib
I'mma rhyme it right, and keep the ghetto in a trance
But when the time is right, me and the devil gon' dance

Jesus H. Christ, how many times I gotta pay the price?
You scared of death I'll make you twice as afraid of life
I bring sight to the game for every night you complained
You couldn't see the light, I was bright in your brain
Ignitin' the flame, keepin' your third lit
Speak and observe with the mind
What are blind sleep til they worth shit
I'm earth wind and fire, the first one to fire
Reppin T. Squad since birth 'til I retire
I wire your jaw, wire the walls with plastique explosives
And riot the halls at the malls where all the crackers moms live
Keep flappin yo' gibs and I'mma come back with those kids
From the back of the bridge
I think two hand touch means tackle the bitch
I rap for the chips, but I'm truly assassin
Four hundred pounds, six feet tall, brutally handsome
That's the pro, got beef with Pun, you gots to go
Mafia style, tear you a new ass-a-hole
Flash your dough, but you too cool for the captain
'Cause I don't give a fuck if I was quadruply platinum
And to the 50 Cent rapper, very funny, get your nut off
'Cause in real life, you don't know
I'll blow your motherfuckin' head off (ooh yeah)

That's my motherfuckin word, you understand?
Thought we was a fuckin' joke? Shit
Terror Squad nigga, you don't know me
You don't know my name, don't say it, you understand?
Told you before I ain't no motherfuckin' rapper understand?
Shit, I don't make no songs about rappers I don't like
If I'mma make a song it's gon' be how I beat yo' motherfuckin ass understand? That'll be the name of the motherfucker

Puff lye with my niggas til I'm high with my niggas

Yeah baby! Ayo it's off with his head
Slap the shit out the Devil and tear his horns off his head
Ayo it's almost over, few months we all gon' know Jehovah
Til then I'mma keep the steel in the shoulder holster

But if my nigga got beef, we goin together tonight
Cause I'mma ride for my niggas, die for my niggas
Puff lye with my niggas til I'm high with my niggas
What you say Twin?

Ayo it's off with his head
Left a body stiff and dead with the infrared
It's hard to survive, disarm a whole part of this tribe
We taking niggas lives, so what? They tryin take mine

So either call the cops, or bust a shot - nigga uhh
Cause I'mma ride for my niggas, die for my niggas
Puff lye with my niggas til I'm high with my niggas
Hold me down Pros'

Aiyyo it's off with his head
Put that nigga to sleep and make a coffin his bed
I come from rough times where niggas bust 9's and be like fuck rhymes
And puff dimes, living on front lines, and lust crimes
You better trust mines, I'm down for the cause
Gimme a round of applause and hear the sound of the 4's
Cause I'mma ride for my niggas, die for my niggas
Puff lye with my niggas til I'm high with my niggas
What the deal kid?

Aiyyo it's off with his head
Cock the lead redecorate the crib burgandy red
Aiyyo I never front, I want whatever nigga to stomp
Whoever want it gonna get lift with the pump

Got the whole left side of my face twitchin and stuff
Cause I'mma ride for my niggas, die for my niggas
Puff lye with my niggas til I'm high with my niggas
Take us home Dunn

Aiyyo it's off with his head
He ain't really want it so he lost it instead

I'm as wicked as Hitler first born
Cause of me, lot of old ladies purse gone
""Kill Niggas Softly"" but not with her song
Matter of fact I kill em viciously, brutally
Strip them clowns down to nudity
Shove the chrome where they doodoo be
It's a stick up, don't try to get brave
Don't even chance it Duke
I want y'all motherfuckers strippin like you dance for loot
Don't stop, give it give it - or you gon' get it get it
Get your fuckin Yankee fitted splitted when I spit it spit it
Y'all faggot rappers funny as Saturday Night Live
Creep through in a white 5 and snipe five
Y'all got some trife wives
Show me where y'all re' at, where the ki' at
Sleep eat shit and pee at, park your 3 at
Spark like Vietnam, tell your mom through the intercom
""UPS ma'am sign here,"" send a bomb
Leave that bitch - roasted and toasted like a chestnut
And if I run out of milk, for cereals, I leave her breasts cut
Got this pitbull and I feed him fresh guts - sick em Cujo!
Steal your bitch and dick the culo
Slam yo' ass and I don't know a lick of judo
Fly to P.R. - stick Menudo
Come back, cop a 6 with two-do'
Cop a brick from you know who, Julio Crew
From Washington Heights in jail I had niggas washin my Nike's
Now I'm squashin the mic, extortionist type
Harsh with a knife
I'm flossin yo' ice on some Bronx shit tonight
Chorus

Cannibalism is livin in my metabolism
Givin em spasms and aneurisms at baby baptisms
That's all my thugs thinkin bout, drinkin your blood
Boriquans love flooded rugs bloody and bloated mugs
Even the reverend can get a severing when I'm beheading
The Armageddon is deading demons, Jesus in heaven
Goin back to spiritual ritual times
What you gon' find - shiftings of Satan in critical bind
Nevermind, I do that often, I've risen often
Bust out my coffin, I'm a livin abortion
Battled the Devil and deaded his demons
Trained other beings to be in his different levels of Hell
Still screamin
Seein bodies bloody and babies bloated corroded
Know the Chinese exploded
Know they run with Gotti who know it (check it)
I never run I never ran, the fattest motherfuckin man
I roll with Cuban makin junk to jams
That's all I'm knowin and I'm never kneed
All on your soul I feed, I'm lettin punk motherfuckers bleed
Fuckin with me, better hide yo' seed
Better think twice, before you ride on me
Cause I'mma lift your weight
Then I'm droppin you in the incinerator
Then I'm hittin the hospital and poppin two in the incubator
That's how we do it pana, hardcore, no more goo-goo ga-ga
Oh I'm sorry pa-pa, was you the da-da?

Look at me now, brother
Do you like fruit?
Well, I'm chewin your girls nipples
How do you like them apples, asshole?

I'm laughing at you
I'm laughing at you now
You told me I was ugly
I was scared to crack a smile

I'm Laughing at you now

I'm laughing at you

600 Benz, 20 inch rims, house on the hill, 
hittin' mad skin
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
It was all a scheme I used to load the teck with the magazine
So I was mean but I still had a scheme
17 years young everything seemed fun
Still considered a veteran cause I feared none
Pun's from the street where there ain't no rules
But carried heat cause he ain't no fool
Ain't no room for dollars in negative digits
So debted followers and got rid of the quitters
That never forget us cause we've been down since the
Genesis 200 horse power to 400 Pegasus
The messages don't sleep till its over
Next thing you know shorty seven feet
Tippin' over I'm still in the water drownin'
Knights and murder till the immortal terror squad
Threw me a life preserver now im ice forever
Stomach bustin' out the white carrera
Life is better now niggas wanna rhyme together
¡Ay qué será! What can I do but take you to strive
¡Ay qué hago! I hope the streets don't take me alive
You wasted your life and refused the struggle while
I aim for the sky pay dues and bubbles I WIN!


Now it's not funny cause I'm hot and got a pot of money
A lot of hunnies around (Don't stop do the brown for me)
My every wish is her command call her bitch she understands
I reminisce how she used to dis me and my man
Check part of the plan she told my son I wasn't the man
I ain't gonna to stop till I got a heart in my hand
I can silence the lamb but couldn't silence her cause
She was as wild as a man with a bottle of liquor
I'm not going to hit her I'm gonna debt her tonight
Double platinum now shes one in the tribe well in the ride now
Well in a fly gettin' high now no more whiteout send the cubans
To provide now it's my world I demand my respect
Give me your girl or get slapped in your neck
Ain't nothin' change im still humble and modest
And im always proud to admit I came straight from the projects

better it there
And no innocent bystanders to get hit with a spare

Like I really care who you paid to rap on your track

Soon as you spoke, I already smoked you with two jabs
My game is tight - you wanna play, just name your price
Fame to ice, your brains your life, the game is sheist
And I'm the trifest on the field
Even in school I was nominated the most likeliest to kill
This bastard steal,

And I'mma blast ya til your whole click respeta

Don't surrender - you ain't got a chance

Ms. Martin,Yeeeah Baby,2000,"Yeah, sometimes you gotta fool 'em
Sometimes you gotta send a woman to do a man's job, knahmean
In this case, my girl hit like a grown motherfuckin' man
Y'all niggas better lay low
Catch you where it hurt, knahmean
Blow your balls off nigga

Where my girl at, quick to bust the MAC, better believe that
She always got my back, nigga twirl that
About to blaze a sack, where the weed at
She don't know how to act, 'cause that's my girl black
With that monster rap, better believe that
You know the Bronx is back, she represent that
'Cause Terror Squad got her back, some say heed that
My niggas love to scrap

I inhale the deepest, cock back and bust rhymes at your speakers
I'm troubled, shoot out the air bubbles in your sneakers
The type to cop a Range along with all the features
Then take the back streets to avoid the leeches
A pregnant bitch talk shit, I'ma destroy her fetus
Her dead baby popped this pussy, and his boys can't beat us
Straight strong armin', bombardin', and bogardin'
Remy don't write her own rhymes, nigga, I beg your pardon
It's Ms. Martin I done broke night in the studio writin'
While fraud broads don't get no publishin, still be bitin'
They kill me lyin, like they the ones doin the scribin'
When you can hear the ghostwriter, all up in they rhymin'
I flows like water, got this drizzle with little C
Catch me with Pun eatin Skittles in the middle of Little Italy
Y'all don't know diddly, I spit hot and drop shit
Every time I kick a rhyme, Pun I burn my lip
Take another pull, bust another shot, y'all can't stop me
Come through in a jail suit, and the new Beef and Broccoli's
Doin it, If I'm havin a good time and you ruin it
I seen a nice casket that'll look good with you in it
New improved shit, the year start with a two shit
Next millennium, sell a million, Clue shit
Exclusive, to tell the truth, y'all useless
'Cause I'm a dime that could rhyme you still on the deuce list

Where my girl at, quick to bust the MAC, better believe that
She always got my back, nigga twirl that
About to blaze a sack, where the weed at
She don't know how to act, 'cause that's my girl black
With that monster rap, better believe that
You know the Bronx is back, she represent that
'Cause Terror Squad got her back, some say heed that
My niggas love to scrap

Remy Martin, dash, reminisce, slash
Remy, cash like a check in a stash
Me without rhymes is like a flynt with no flash
Stripper with no ass, car with no gas
Tryna go fast, I love to hear the guns go blast
I love the sounds of the shells fallin' down
Love to smoke weed, stay blowin' trees, fuck liquor
When shit get thick, I love to hear my bitches raise his clique up
You sick, but I'm sicker, plus our guns is bigger
If you really wanna kill us, do it nigga pull the trigga
How you figure, you could really come and take what's mine
And all I gotta do is send a little letter to Rah
He'll send the troops out, my brother don't hesitate to pull a tool out
And I'm his little sis, so he taught me the same shit
Quick to flip, but your name should be prickless
'Cause every time you open your mouth, you suckin' my dick
Talkin' shit, as if you a soldier,nigga
When you a no cash, low class, doja nigga
Y'all rock rocks, we bling bling boulders, nigga
Look over your shoulder I'm in the Rover, it's over, nigga
Inhale, cock back and bust, just because
I know none of y'all busters is touchin' us
I got the thoroughest thugs and, baby reminisces
That don't give a fuck, with a aim that never misses
Hugs and kisses never, just slugs and stitches
Thugs and bitches forever, check the mugshot pictures
Fuck the weather, I still got my tan Timbs on
Just copped the pink mink, and winter been gone
I been on this thug shit y'all can't seem to fuck with
My shit is hot dogs, to top it off, still spittin' mustard
No fair, 'cause I don't care I go to war wit a musket
Just give me some Oreos, a jar of 'dro and two dutches
'Cause Pun be the nicest motherfucker on the market
Now he got the nicest bitch, what, Remy Martin

Where my girl at, quick to bust the MAC, better believe that
She always got my back, nigga twirl that
About to blaze a sack, where the weed at
She don't know how to act, 'cause that's my girl black
With that monster rap, better believe that

You Was Wrong,Yeeeah Baby,2000,"What?
T-S nigga
Y'all don't know?

Aiyyo its on, I see how niggas didn't learn
You is wrong, thought the fire didn't burn
Its on, me and Pun ain't from the Bronx
You's wrong, nigga we can get it on

Aiyyo, guns we toss 'em, and bodies we auction
To his family we tell 'em he owed us a fortune
Gimme forty-thou, you can have your child, you don't know
What I had to go through, to clap this clown
Check my background
The last nigga to see you bleed
Tthe last nigga to see you breathe
The last nigga you wish you shoulda believed
And Drag move quick, blend right in the wall like a brick
The only thing you see before I blow off ya shit is my wrist
'Cuz my hand the gun is covered in
Not this range, when I pump this pistol, its very rare I miss
It's damn near on your lips
Y'all keep talkin like y'all teflon with no weap-ons
Nigga I'm pumpin my raw, I ain't thugging no more
Nowadays niggas run upstairs, open they drawer
My circumstance, you ain't got that chance
Mines in my draw, you get it?
Thats means y'all walks for two dicks, so don't be stupid
And make me use one, unless you not a bitch

Aiyyo it's on, you thought I was wack
You was wrong, album double plat
Yo it's on, stop talkin shit
You was wrong, get off my dick

How dare you doubt or deny Big Pun, the undoubtable
The only rapper that'll pull out a gun and slap the shit outta you
You can't tell me nothing, I'll clonk you and stomp out ya belly button
I'm too violent for this rap shit, I should be out somehwere killin somethin'
Too quick to blast, some niggas talk shit and dash
But I really will KICK YOUR ASS
Juggernaut, I don't care if you a thug or not
I'll get Jamaican on ya ass, rudeboy, what the bumbaclot?
On your mark get ready, run, I'm sparkin' everyone
Don't wanna get locked? Stand back and watch
Where you from?
How dare you come and try to shit where I eat
Fuck you nigga, literally
Dick in your cheeks, you rich in the street
But I'm still gon' hit cha'll niggas
Because up north you be tossin' salads with maple syrup
I know you hate to hear it, but everybody know this one
Why you always gotta be right nigga?
Why can't you ever be wrong?

Now it's on, from the Bronx where its at
You was wrong, me and Pun brought it back
Now it's on, stay on with the gat
You was wrong, it's the Don, Joey Crack

Who the fuck want beef with Joe Crack
Make your body fold back
Lift his soul with the chrome mack
I don't chat on the phone, 'cuz the phone tapped
You heard there's money on the block, we control that
I got the work in the pot where that stove at
Cook it up 'till it's rock, get my dough back
You niggas so wack, tryna compete
I blind you with heat, I'm the reason crime on the street
I die for my peeps, keep an open eye when I sleep
Let you slide when I coulda put five in your Jeep
Who's liver than me? I ain't know you really want it
I'm like Christ, niggas beg for they life when they see me comin
Ain't nodoby gonna stop my shine, you out'cho mind
Don't make me have to cock my nine, pop ya spine
Neva did believe in the Don's
Since ninety-two I've been proving that y'all niggas was wrong

Aiyyo, it's on, though I'd stay on the block
You was wrong, now Remi on the rock
So it's on, thought I wasn't gonna drop
You was wrong, I was right all along

I told these niggas, that I was the sickest bitch
And everytime you spit, I'mma spit some sicker shit
Ridicoulous, I reminisce and blaze the track
Type of shit make a nigga wanna play it back
Y'all hatin' that, but I'mma make 'em all believers
Fuck hot, I'mma come and straight drop a fever
Cop a heater, turn around and pop your leader
And for the followers, I'mma leave their heads hollower
Make your wig twisted as if I was Oliver
Layin' in a hospital, hooked up the monitors
Thats for the game, y'all lames just came to first
'Cuz I ain't neva heard a bitch straight flame a verse
I blame the church, how God let you lie like that
Who scribed you for, 'cuz you ain't never rhymed like that
How the fuck you gon' tell me that chick is tight
She ain't 'aight 'cuz she don't write, you wrong",https://genius.com/Big-pun-you-was-wrong-lyrics
The Creation (Intro),Yeeeah Baby,2000,"(Laughing)
As the full eclipse approaches

Big Daddy Kane
Kool G Rap
Rakim the Master
Eddie Murphy

Cause he's a funny muthafucka
Michael Jackson

Because he has money
Fuckin' dickhead

The strength of a black man

Brave in the Heart,Endangered Species,2001,"I'll battle you all, from the charts to ghetto stars
Face Triple Seis: the God of War like Mars
That leave MC's smashed by my Squad
It's odd y'all never seen relish, but always seem jealous
Of my extreme fellas, rockin' the Beamer sweaters
The ones who paid with their life
I rock for 40 days and 40 nights
And every verse is tight
Better than before: rough, rugged, and raw
Chainsaw metaphor that leave your brain sore
This ain't a game, I'll leave you maimed
Allow me to explain
I thrive on the pain while robbin' your chain
Nawmean, do him and the fiend, grab his wallet
Leave a trail, blazin' like Rasheed Wallace
What's today's knowledge?
Hold your heat like The Peacemaker
I walk the same streets the police take us
Livin' on the corner so won't speak it out my mouth
Respect and got the money, son, that's all that it's about
No doubt, silence of code, violence of mode
Under control, can tell my real niggas really roll
On the low, tryin' to blow trees
And for no reas' we hit a nigga up for mo' cheese
Better relate and start to think, or be the missing link
I got my Hustle on like Larry Flynt

We brave in the heart, playin' a part, amazingly smart
Razor-sharp, futuristic raps: state of the art
Takin' New York cats past the stars, first it was Nasty Nas
Now watch me turn a Apple into Macintosh
Computer chip locomotion flow, la cosa nostra dough
Hold your toaster low; business, never personal
Just some words to know if you run the streets
Come in peace or leave in pieces
Even Jesus was killed by the polices
They crucified him, now they inject us with juice to fry 'em
Depends on the state; If death is my fate, then cool, I'm dyin'
If that's my destiny, it's meant to be
Just remember to bury the motherfucker that bent me right next to me Aight, crew? (no doubt Pun)
Aight then, let's fight then
I'm hypened, comin' with the thunder and the lightnin'
Invitin' the comp, ice on the arm
Nights when I storm, snipin' your moms right from the Bronx
Mic in the palm, it's the ghetto god
I rip a nigga's heart out his frame
While I scream: 
""Terror Squad!""
Be larger than life, my initials carved in my wife
She said she’d starve if I die, understand I’m a god in her eyes
The father of Christ, sure to be immortal
Guzzlin' beer bottles by the dozen
With Devin: that's mi hermano

We will be here, forever – KRS
We brave in the heart, 
p-p-p-playin' a part
Amazingly smart
Remember Pun
, that's the ghetto God

You ain't understand how I push your wig back quick
A little quiet nigga wouldn't think I did that shit
I'm from where the guns love to introduce theyself
Reduce your health, little bulletproofs get felt
Who mind ready, for this big dog who hold a 9 steady
I'm John Blazin when you see the arms razin'
Shit, crime heavy already
I keep it sharper than the long 'chette
Far from a snitch nigga who call Teddy
I click triggers: how you more ready?
Switch quicker than Marbury
I'm a cherry, you a strawberry
If you lost that, mean I'm on top of the whip
You plottin' to flip, fuck around and get shot in the lip
You stop with the quick and never make another move
Even your mother lose
I hurt up your pops to pay your brother dues

We will be here, forever – KRS
We brave in the heart, 
p-p-p-playin' a part
Amazingly smart
Remember Pun
, that's the ghetto God

Make way for scrill', I don't play, I spray for real
Blow your top with the Glock—that's my favorite kill
Blaze your crib with like thirty shots
I'm already hot, but my last one is with some dirty cops
I play the streets with toast, 'cause the thieves is close
Want to keep your post? Then don't beef with Joe
Still niggas think I won't bring the heat out
That's like sayin' Puff ain't never beat up Steve Stoute
Truth first, Terror Squad: shoot first
War with me and you guaranteed to leave the Earth
I'm dressed to kill, my niggas rep for real
Joe Crack's back like I never had a deal
Hungry and shit, it don't get more lovely than this
Blow a hole through your ribs just for runnin' your lips
The street's a trip: either you deep or you sleep with the fish
I keep a fifth for them niggas that's seekin' to flip",https://genius.com/Big-pun-brave-in-the-heart-lyrics
How We Roll,Endangered Species,2001,"Something, I want to tell you
There's something I've been, thinking, that your, crew should know
Big Pun be the largest thang
Straight out of the projects, mang
And that's how we roll.. roll..

You know I'm well known like Al Capone, fully blown like Ton' Montana
In a zone, sittin on chrome, stoned sippin' on cham-pagna
Rollin ganja up in Bible paper, see how high the lye can take us
Through the eyes of Christ, John, Elijah, Jacob
I make the kind of green a hustler dream, bustin' out the custard cream Viper
Custom piped up with the mustard seams
Clustered green Fort Knox and hard deemer medallion
Mockin' God, even Italians see my battalion propped abroad
I got the Squad over-qualified, pullin' over Karl Kani
Range Rover tilted, three-wheelted hydraulic slide
Sparkin' lye in the clouds and reppin' my housin'
Like the Wu do in Shaolin

Ooohooo baby there's, something, I want to tell you
There's something I've been, thinking, that your, crew should know
Big Pun be the largest thang
Straight out of the projects
And that's how we roll.. roll..

I keep my Desert Eagle cocked back in my tuxedo with my top hat
What you broke motherfuckers know about that?
Lookin' fat in Marc and Pelle leather like Fonzarelli
Sparkin Phillies with the Gods like Makaveli
On the celly (blown Benz, chrome rims)
Shinin' like the (stone gems) on my (gold rings)
I got it sewn Twinz, I can't begin to tell you the story
That soared me from livin' poorly to a modern day Cinderfella
I've been a killer and a drug dealer, a bugged nigga
But now I'm like Puffy 'cause money's thicker than blood player
I'm still a threat but now I think before I flip
Call my connects together and figure which cleaner's the best for the hit
I get the job done, Pun's handlin' business
Candlelight dinners, havin' a toast with the most glamorous bitches
My road to riches was no Christmas
Now we blessed with gold Lazaruses so expensive my whole family's religious

Ooohooo baby there's, something, I want to tell you
There's something I've been, thinking, that your, crew should know
Big Pun be the largest thang
Straight out of the projects
And that's how we roll.. roll..

Aiyo I want it all you can call me greedy and superficial
Long as my crew's official and pulls they pistols soon as I whistle
I'm tryna triple a million and split it three ways
Joe the God, Full-A-Clips and myself, that'll be the day
I need a way to get it already got the ambition
Start the ignition, watch for the NARCs in the marked Expedition
I'm on a mission which requires a higher position
Desire and vision keeps the fire inside of me glistenin'
I'm infinite like math, so I'm gonna last
But you wanna laugh all day, bullshit and sittin' on your ass
I'm all about cash and the power
A stash with the powder that lasts like hittin' ass for an hour
Let's get it locked, I want a watch with baguetted rocks
So I can clock hoes with the glow that never stops
Forget the cops, we got Deserts and Glocks too
Ready to rock whoever tryna stop our cheddar from stockin' forever

Ooohooo baby there's, something, I want to tell you
There's something I've been, thinking, that your, crew should know
Big Pun be the largest thang
Straight out of the projects
And that's how we roll.. roll..

Wishful Thinking,Endangered Species,2001," What would you do if you could do the unbelievable
 Once you rule the world every girl will want to be with you
 First I get the money then I get the power
 B-Real love to kill, eliminatin' the cops

Thinkin' of takin' a plane
To take a flight out to the red light
And smuggle ten pounds of weed
Make it home tonight
Be the number one smuggler in the area
Got enough weight to fill up an aircraft carrier
Herb slanger, Hasila Incorporated
State to state and overseas gettin' faded
The Buddha king had seen the green proton
I'm bringing it on right back home to Don
Many different strains of herb in my brain
I'm slippin' through customs in my hydro plane
Skunk and the one Chocolate Thai bud
Niggas, let's get high in the sky, hit the blunts
And the bongs fill up the lungs, niggas don't stop
Fools get sprung when they get to smoke up the crops
I give props for all the soldiers in the war
Yo, what would you do if the world was yours

 What would you do if you could do the unbelievable
 Once you rule the world every girl would want to be with you
 First I get the money then I get the power
 Joey crack twistin' caps, enemies I devour

It was only a dream, 16 battin' Beamers and Benz's
Lying pendants with diamonds ill as lacin' in a face with a vengeance
Having blocks on in the livest parts dome
My mankind with crime is how you shine if you can't rhyme
Dime droppers will give your fad time if you sleep
But my mistake will be mastering heat on city streets
And in the east I be known as Don Cartegena
Claimin' the throne like Calderon in this heron arena
Lacin' the china with Menida
This felony repeater will be a leader
Like a preacher but so much deeper
Peep the shit that I be on, sippin' Don
Until I'm drunk with a million in my trunk like Nicky Barnes
Come on, I be the top extortionist
Adopt a dozen foster kids right out the motherfuckin' orphanage
Yea, I do it for the youth, I'm livin' proof
All my peeps on the streets know I speak the truth

 What would you do if you could do the unbelievable
 Once you rule the world every girl would want to be with you
 First you get the money then you get the power
 G Rap bustin' the gats and slangin' last by the hour

No doubt, I be the crime story of all ghetto territories
Soldiers at war be blowin' up niggas like Glory
With pharmaceutical lavatories
Majored in chemistry, PhD in streetology
Degree in drug industry
Combinin' H₂O with matter from crack batter
Residue molecules scatter
Launchin' rockets to make the pocket fatter
Mind brighter than Einstein's for crime
G equals the MC that ain't near the square, son I gets mine
But yo the kill will fill with force fields and shields
And holy steel, a nigga keep it real, you know the deal
If the stakes ain't too high for me to grab it
I gots to have it, stack all the cabbage
From conducting a drug traffic
Police'll chain me and tryna find a new plot to frame me in
They rein me in so I resort to evil thoughts like Damien
Display my fury to the DA and the jury
One hundred grand, the judge's hammer slams, I'm a free man

 What would you do if you could do the unbelievable
 Once you rule the world every girl would want to be with you
 First you get the money then you get the power
 Big Pun's the same son, bustin' my guns for the dollars

Yo, I walk on water, spit fire and shit Häagen-Dazs
Idolize no man like Conan and stand beside the gods
Be larger than life, twice as nice as your idol
Pump you with pride, then guide you straight to hell like the Bible
I'm liable to start manipulatin' minds, infiltrate and climb
Out the pitfalls of life, entice with nickle plated nine
It seems every time I dream I'm in a nightmare
I fiend to live in a world where mothers and queens of men would fight fair
 Hell Yea!
I wish I could, I wish I could
Never forget this whole damn world ain't shit, not just the hood
Yo, I'd change my life, make my wife forget the tears from the pain and physical abuse
Give her back her best years
Grab my chest hairs, pound my fist on the hard cement
Spark the scent, and cloud the sky to my heart's content
Repent if thou shall be forgiven
How could we be proud to live in a world
Which condemns man, child, and woman?
Child and woman",https://genius.com/Big-pun-wishful-thinking-lyrics

Yeah, yeah, work it out
Work it out dawg, work it out now
Uhh, y'all motherfuckers, big dawgs in the house what?
Terror Squad what? Terror Squad what?
I ain't a rapper, I just bust a lot, off the top
What, yo, yo

The penalty is death, especially when I'm mentally stressed
My enemies hang with me 'til I eventually flip
I never reject an offer to battle
Slap a coffin on the saddle
And rattle like a wooden horse to el barrio
Niggas talk but they babble cause they ain't sayin' nothin'
If ain't blazin' somethin with the MAC I'm in the shack bakin' muffins
Fake the funk and get your rump roast
One dose of the toast'll make you jump if you come close
Pun spoke, ain't no more debatin; my squad been waitin'
For the perfect time to give you what you all been waitin'
An orgi-nation of veterans built
With genuine skills to pay the heat, gas, and the rest of the bills
Invest in the real, don't get left in the hills
My tec and my steel turn your whole crew into vegatables
We blessed with the will to never surrender
'Cause my every agenda's in and out
Unseen like I entered the ninja

It's my world girl, either love it or leave
If you was my girl, you'd be thuggin' the weave
Suckin' the blow pop, with a ring in your tongue
Baby don't stop, that's how you bring it to Pun
If this is my world, I'd be Tony the man
Call me The Godfather, controllin' the fam'
Runnin' the whole coast, I'd be a mafia king
Nothin but the finest diamonds in my watch and my rings

Stupid.. gimme yours
You be lookin' bunny rabbit
Give your pants bunny rabbits, what you know about that?
I ain't about to pop you stupid
Fuck the small talk, niggas know Pun keep the fo' cocked
Don't walk too fast, might pass through the wrong block
Don't stop, keep it movin', the streets'll ruin
The average man, faster than, the motherfuckin' teamsters union
We doin' dirt cause we gotta, five dolla a hour
Three kids and my motherfuckin' big mama
My Sig Sauer got different plans, God knows I'm just a man
So hide your wrist if it's glistenin
Listen man, we just niggas tryin' to work it out
Listen friend, strictly biz it's nothin personal
We thirsty now and I ain't drinkin' out of plastic cups
Platinum plus (Thorough) crystal glasses with the fancy cuts
Fancy us, livin' life lavish
Drippin' ice cabbage, livin' in the six, with some white bad bitch
Tight package I gotta pass
I'm from the ghetto nigga, I like a lot of ass

It's my world girl, either love it or leave
If you was my girl, you'd be thuggin' the weave
Suckin' the blow pop, with a ring in your tongue
Baby don't stop, that's how you bring it to Pun
If this is my world, I'd be Tony the man
Call me The Godfather, controllin' the fam'
Runnin' the whole coast, I'd be a mafia king
Nothin but the finest diamonds in my watch and my rings

Word life T. Squad holdin' it down, y'knahmean?
Gettin' this money by any means baby
Let me get the fuck up outta here, 'fore I break somethin'",https://genius.com/Big-pun-my-world-lyrics
Mamma,Endangered Species,2001,"Mamma.. I don't understand
Why he had to fuck with me, now I gotta kill this man
I said mamma.. now I'm on the run
Dear ma-mmahhhhhhh.. what have I done?

Somebody save me, I think I just killed somebody baby
Shoulda chilled but money was really tryin to play me
Couldn't hold it no more so I showed him the four
Duke was dissin my girl like she was hoein on tour
And knowin I'm raw, money tried to play fly
""I said whassup to the bitch; why she couldn't say hi?""
That ain't right! I had to put him in his place
Remember them hollows I bought for three bottles?
I put 'em in his face
I didn't have to disgrace myself, I hate myself
AHORA A TU *BLAH BLAH* Brace yourself
Thats the law the streets are like basketball
Sometimes you shoot, sometimes you pass it off
Can't always take a shot, make one mistake you upstate for what?
Too much hate, time to break the lock
I hate the cops so I ain't tryin to see 'em
I love a brother doin triple life but I ain't tryin to be him
That's why I be on the low, and keep my feet in the row
Cause they're tellin me as far as felonies
You get life for three in a row
Then whadday'know? Last week at the flicks
I had to kill somebody, for steppin on my kicks (STUPID)


I can murder half the world laugh while the other side hate me
But hurt one hair on my mamma head and I'ma, cry like a baby
She my heart and soul; what Jimi Hendrix was to rock'n'roll
Made me believe I could achieve the impossible
Now you know one of my weaknesses, but Punisher keeps it glizz
So don't pull out cause when I pop oh what a relief it is
Send you where Jesus is - hold up, that's the gas chamber
Think before you put on that ski-mask and blast a stranger
Relax the anger, don't be so hard on yourself
That's how you'll end up twelve years old;
Bein charged as an adult
Terror Squad is here to help so you can learn from our mistakes
Cause power just makes you reject destiny and devour your fate
How many hours I waste, tryin to figure the shit
Until I finally realized, we're just niggas and spics
That's what they feel, what can I do but just stay real?
Keep somethin in the stash in case I gotta make bail
Cause ain't no brothers, runnin shit in the system
You goin straight to jail if you colored and fit the description
.. fuck you talkin about? I live here
This is my buildin nigga; fuck you nigga!
That's my daughter right there playin.. fuck off me!
Get the fuck off!


I don't have much time so I'm only gonna ask you once
To please forgive me mamma; I love you and I'm sorry I broke your heart
But I ask you to do me a favor and take care of my daughters
And raise them to be good respectable woman, like their mother
God bless her soul
And raise my son to be a good man, a better man than me
And for this I give you my soul, I love you


Heyyyy ma-ma-ma-mma..
I just killed a man..
Ma-mmaaaa.. what am I to do?",https://genius.com/Big-pun-mamma-lyrics
Classic Verses (Drop it Heavy and Fantastic 4),Endangered Species,2001,"*  -- from the Show & A.G. ""Full Scale EP""
*  -- from the DJ Clue CD ""The Professional""

Yo, my squad is honored like Elijah Muhammad
But I'm God-retarded, ain't no righteousness in this heart of violence
Hard as diamond but I'm in the ruff, listen up
If you ever see me with the Feds you can bet it's in the cuffs
Ain't no snitch in us, bitch in us
Unofficial-ness, everything we outside you wish you was
Official thugs in the drug profession
Drug connections, drug addictions
Still seein the judge for drug possession
The four-D's, all these is more reas'
To either get big, or leave and let live
We the best there is T.S., ain't nobody else
We probably Dove, cause we all way on top of the shelf
I'm lockin your wealth with the master keys, freeze
Don't try to breeze, or I'mma squeeze and blast the back of your knees
Just pass the cheese, please don't test the toaster
My tech'll roast ya body faster than Ferrari's Testarossa
You're gettin closer to death, Reaper's got a hold on your breath
You goin straight to hell as you sell your soul for your flesh
You was posin a threat, now you froze in the bed
Minute ago, you was poppin shit, holdin ya dick
Now what's the problem, you ain't nuttin like you said on your album
I thought you was wildin bustin your guns and runnin the island
You was't violent, you was silent tryin to get college credits
How pathetic, did it to get out of the calisthenics
I'm +Dianetics+ combined with lyrics
My matureness is my insurance
Kill my appearance, I'm a shinin spirit
You gotta fear it, cause every last gem is poison
You gotta cheer it, you can't win you better join em
I'm head-annointin niggas like the Holy Gospel
I'm the only vato loco to smoke you with fire-blowin nostrils
Watch for the toast, when you see it, you better draw yours
Warlords, callin The Giant, it's all yours

Fuck all y'all non-believers; I roll with God, the Squad and T.S
Out with the B.S. we platinum, they even doubted Jesus
Niggas is 85%, I'm 400 solid
Brain-bolic with knowledge, cock-diesel scholars
Holdin it down, walkin around with gold by the pound
Frozen and drowned with diamond boulders all in the crown
Talk of the town, soakin you down wit toast 'til you drown
Ghost you and pound your corpse with a force that'll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns, I'm on the serious tip
You keep playin.. and I get furious quick
And now I take you for a walk through the ghetto
Either spark your metal or get outlined in chalk by the devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit, I used to clap shit
Now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a mac in back of the Acura
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
It's like that, but don't think I won't counter act
My niggas is strapped and quick to lay a bitch on his back
I'm swift with the mac, quicker than Kung Fu
With the reflexes of a cat, and the speed of a mongoose",https://genius.com/Big-pun-classic-verses-drop-it-heavy-and-fantastic-4-lyrics
How We Roll ’98,Endangered Species,2001,"{*dice being shook up and thrown, i.e. ""Tumblin Dice""*}

You know I'm well known like Al Capone, fully blown like Ton' Montana
In a zone, sittin on chrome, stoned sippin on cham-pagna
Rollin ganja up in bible papers, see how high the lye can take us
Through the eyes of Christ, John, Elijah, Jacob
I make the kind of green a hustler dream
Bustin out the custard cream Viper
Custom piped up with the mustard seams
Clustered green Fort Knox and hard (?) medallions
Mockin God even Italians see my batallion pull out the broad
I got the +Squad+ over-qualified, pullin over Karl Kani
Range Rover tilted, three-wheelted hydraulic slide
Sparkin lye in the clouds and reppin my housin
Like the Wu do in Shaolin

There's something I want to tell you (I want to tell you)
There's something I think your crew should know
Big Pun is the largest (so large) we straight out of the projects
That's how we roll.. (that's how we roll..)

I keep my Desert Eagle cocked back in my tuxedo with my top hat
What you broke motherfuckers know about that?
Lookin fat in Marc and Pelle leather like Fonzarelli
Sparkin Phillies with the Gods like Makaveli
On the celly blown Benz, chrome rims
Shinin like the stone gems on my gold rings
I got it sewn Twinz, I can't begin to tell you the story
That soared me from livin poorly to a modern day Cinderfella
I've been a killer and a drug dealer, a bugged nigga
But now I'm like Puffy cause money's thicker than blood player
I'm still a threat but now I think before I flip
Call my connects together
And figure which cleaner's the best for the hit
I get the job done, Pun's handlin business
Candlelight dinners, havin a toast with the most glamorous bitches
My road to riches was no Christmas
Now we blessed with gold Lazaruses
So expensive my whole family's religious


Aiyyo I want it all you can call me greedy and superficial
Long as my crew's official and pulls they pistols soon as I whistle
I'm tryin to triple a million and split it three ways
Joe the God, Full Eclipse, and myself - that'll be the day
I need a way to get it already got the ambition
Start the ignition, watch for the NARCs in the marked Expedition
I'm on a mission which requires a higher position
Desire and vision keeps the fire inside of me glistenin
I'm infinite like math, so I'm gonna last
But you wanna laugh all day, bullshit and sittin on your ass
I'm all about cash and the power
A stash with the power that lasts like hittin ass for an hour
Let's get it locked, I want a watch with baguetted rocks
So I can clock hoes with the glow that never stops
Forget the cops, we got Deserts and Glocks too
Ready to rock whoever tryin to stop our cheddar from stockin forever
 - 2X (*with variations*)

Straight out the PJ's Twinz, Soundview!
Castle Hill, can't forget Bronx River
Lil Villes.. huh, the Forest Projects, Eden Wald
Bronxdale, the Bronx baby straight out the PJ's

The Dream Shatterer (Original),Endangered Species,2001,"Aiyyo I shatter dreams like Jordan, assault and batter your team
Your squadron'll be barred from rap like Adam & Eve from the garden
I'm carvin my initials on your forehead
So every night before bed you see the ""BP"" shine off the board head
Reverse that, I curse at the first wack nigga with the worst rap
Cause he ain't worth jack
Hit him with a thousand pounds of pressure per slap
Make his whole body jerk back, watch the earth crack
Hand him his purse back
I'm the first Latin rapper to baffle your skull
Master the flow, niggas be swearin I'm blacker than coal
Like Nat King, I be rappin and tounge's packin
The ones, magnums, cannons and gatling guns
It's Big Pun! The one and only son of Tony... Montana
You ain't promised manana in the rotten manzana
C'mon pana we be mob rhymers
Feel the marijuana, snake bite, anaconda
A man of honour wouldn't wanna try to match my persona
Sometimes rhymin I blow my own mind like Nirvana
Comma, and go the whole nine like Madonna
Go try to find another rhymer with my kinda grammar

When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin like you Satan when I'm the rhymin abomination


I'm pure adrenaline, uncut, straight to the gut, medicine
Raw cure for pain I coat your brain like polyurethane
Simple and plain, I'll explain it in layman terms
If you came to learn how to make fire, I'mma make it burn!
Higher and hotter than lava this scholar advisor is smart as MacGyver
To put honor inside the heart of a liar
Involved in a life of crime (crime!) fuck it I like the shine (shine!) Up in the white and lime (lime!) Comes with the pipe design
Plushed out! (No doubt!) Both pockets about to bust out
If you not in it for the spinach, GET THE FUCK OUT!
Take a hike, we can even battle to make it right
Go 'head lace the mic, you finished? Say good night
Head to head in the street, I'll leave you dead in your feet
Settlin beef, I'll even let you rhyme to the Benjamin beat
But it won't matter, you dreams still gon' shatter
It's a long ladder to climb, and mine is known to stagger
So get outta town, 'fore I hit you with the loudest sound
You ever heard; desert bird player you outta bounds
 - 3X

You know the Pun'll diss you if your whole steez is unofficial
I'll come and get you and let the desert eez tounge kiss you
With one pistol and two clips, I'll make your crew do flips
Like acrobatics, I'm charismatic, my gat is magic
It makes rappers disappear, whipser in your ear
Crystal clear, come here, let me kiss your tears
Everything you fear is here, you ain't got to search further
The first murder's the worst, now I thirst further
For reverse birth, every verse hurts, every curse word's
Already more offending than Eddie Murph's worst
I thirst for blood like a vampire
Any man claimin his game's tighter - IS A GOD DAMN LIAR!
I set him on fire, retire your train of thought
Drain a quart of blood out your brain and leave you insane in the dark
The king of New York! Lays his crown in the Boogie Down
And sprays the town, with a Mac hoodied down
I'm no joke! I soak your face with a sweeper
Die in disgrace, or face your death through the speaker

Ring rattlin microphone fiend spline splatterer
King of the throne, bringin it home five nights
Up in The Source - five mics
Whippin a Porsche - high price
Pumpin the 9-7, rhyme heaven her voice is mindbendin
Imaginin Angie nuttin but panties and my 911

Bitch don't try to play me, because you not a player

Don't slip into some shit you and your click can't really handle
I ain't havin it, get the cash out the cabinet
Before I stab the bastard baby in the bassonet

A new rapper by the name of Big Punisher recently signed to Loud Records, records his debut album this year

Rapper Big Punisher informed us of what we can expect to be his album, and gave us a definition of his own early age, and forming his own crew Full-A-Clips. He was able to get noticed from his newly found partner in crime, Fat Joe

Pun celebrated the release of his highly anticipated album last week, remaining in the top 20 of the Billboard charts for two exciting weeks

...becoming the first Latin rap solo artist to sell a million records...

...the rapper said he owes it all to the Bronx... performed at the opening of the Oscar De La Hoya-Felix Trinidad fight

...and Hip-Hop's heavyweight received a nomination

...explained in a recent interview his passion for the art of Hip-Hop

Latin artist Big Pun... weight loss camp at Duke University earlier this week... is currently working on a sophomore album

Christopher Rios, also known as Big Pun, was pronounced dead at 3:53 pm on Monday

That's the way the ball bounces, ya know what I mean?
Ya know, but we'll have our day, ya know
And we, we'll keep it going for now",https://genius.com/Big-pun-intro-words-from-big-pun-spoken-word-lyrics

Resurrection,DJ Soul Tribute,2010,"I'd rather be a dead man
And go out of this world as a man
That stood for something
Than to bow down like a dog

I know you heard the stories
Pun's a killer
On a search for glory
The Heavens cursing on me
That's why I'm stuck in purgatory
Niggas bore me with rough raps
My shit is truly for the cats that bust gats
Where's the noise, where my thugs at?
Where my dogs at?
Where my love at?
Where my squad at?
Where my motherfucking nigga Joe the God at?
Ready for combat, being long-strapped, long gat
Now disarm that, physically, making contact
We the wrong cats, you don't bark at
Better spark that, walk that, lock that
Trigger pump, cock back, park that, pop that
Right where the heart at
Take the Glock, like make sure I don't pop that
You don't want that

Feel you spinal rapture when I rip through your vinyl

Lyrically Fit,Bronx Legends Never Die,2014,"Yo, yo, Elaquaz Gates speaking
Y’all know me
Once again, we definitely do not need no hooks
(Word up)
No hooks
This is the TWIsMer symphony
‘Til infinity!
Yeah!
What you want?
Yeah, check it, check it
Something like this, check it

Yo, why you rhyming like you killing niggas
You ain’t never feel a trigger
Screaming that you real, but you’re still beginners
I make examples out you ample rappers
Smack you, make you trample backwards
Catch you falling flat then strap you back in Pampers
That’s a sample just to let you know
Test me and invest in souls
Especially on some flesh meats that was left on skulls
Those opposing, holding grudges, will be holding crutches
Motherfuckers blasting me, that’s blasphemy, I’m old to roughage
Who’s the toughest? As rough as they come, I’ll snuff ‘em
Any one of you bluffing, my name ain’t Punisher for nothing
Keep huffing and puffing, I’ll blow your face in
When me and Seis and my ace in the hole lyrical assassin be Triple Seis-ing
Chasing po-po out of puerto town, loco ‘til I part the ground
In my coffin tossed into the lost and found
Down in deep beneath the weather in my leather job
Six feet forever, half-asleep— Bronx niggas never die

I be the awesome maker, off the coffin breaker, awesome order shaker
Work invader, Jordans flossing off then I’m the chocha taster
Clique vodka knickerbocker, wicked boxer, sickest monster
March, Scala uppercut them thick sponsors you dick-chompers
Incredible, Tennessee’s dragging blood in the pedigree
Immortalizing everyone, beat you down for like centuries
Impressing me? Barely, your life is not necessary
I’m Peter Pan to you fairies, nefarious action bearing
Criminal, lyrically I’m parallel yet minimal
Keep on talking shit, I’ll put your body with the minerals
Grow a tree, known to be explosive, ain’t no holding me
Fifty thousand blunts and you could count ‘em as my potency
Ocean-deep inside your mom’s esophagus
Gargle it and hawk up spit
Shut up, little nigga, give your moms a kiss
Pitiful, and we never stumble on the lyrical
Even if we stutter, we will still sh-sh-shit on you

You know exactly what you dealing with, a captivating lyricist
Who get it in with a pen or extended clip, killin’ it
Like children in the city of God, we rock Timberlands
While chilling on villainous blocks, you not built for this
Infinite skill is genuine, realism
Apparently I give you a clear picture
So you understand I’m not playing with you, better ask somebody
Go by my men who show me love, loyalty, and respect
Or your family crying as you lying
That’s my word I’m standing by
The red dot on your head will leave you absentminded
For acting live, the man who’s wiser advances higher
If you think life’s a bitch, the passion’s dying
You lack the fire to satisfy, the smasher-riders
Thinking they can see me are merely blinded by their denial
It’s a clear reminder, there’s levels, I continue rising
You and your feelings are for women, I have the finest

My caliber’s incredible, Shaq is a regular
Hunting down your sector or moving like the Predator
Camouflage injecter-a, rhyme rector-a
Front-line connector of drastic measure-a
Round One recommender-a in the splendor of
In my crib I create, send your ass upstate
I’m remarkable, remake, you remind, I retake
I was born this great, you reenact your fate
Fool, niggas in the boroughs better activate
Expeditiously, Shaq will get loose on brakes
Twenty-four hours, seven days a week
My God, tell me what y’all know about me
I blow up your block like a M-80
A blockbuster, whether or not my style’s gutter
Niggas talking shit, damn, y’all can’t fade me
You the past, bro, gone like the ‘80s

Break it down, Shaq, a few of these emo got that back black
From Brooklyn to Orlando, we play, top-of-the-stacking ‘em
We racking ‘em, tray two on the knapsack, click-clacking ‘em
With caliber, having a good time getting back at ‘em
TWIsM, get wism, recognize the O’Nealism
Soul survivor, I strive, more beats is what I give ‘em
I live ‘em, eat, swallow, and breathe one, heard you need one

Terror Squad niggas who want it
Even the biggest dogs acknowledge
Payin how much? We obviously gain dollars
Let's mananas without your everyday (?)
We make ballers take cowards of the top give me eight hours
I turn your powder into rocks, check the scenery
Glass table, mad cocaine debris, and bring a key
When you hang with me everything is free
It's my treat, my suite all expenses paid
All my friends can stay, cause this break is on emancipate
Nuthin more, it's on me butt galore, and head nut your balls
I'm makin money for these fuckin whores
Nice and raw keep it rugged fuck the bullshit
Skribble said it's all love as long as it's the new shit

Must be the music
(Turnin them on)
Must be the new shit
(From Cuban and Pun)
That's how we do it
(Big Pop is my shit)
Must be the new shit
(They'll never stop it)

Yo it's the lyrical fly guy, that drive by your block in the Benz
I be hittin skins while I'm givin all my friends high fives
I get live and tie your legs to my brass bed
Relax, get comfortable, then hump you through the mattress
Cause at this I'm a professional, the best in the world
That's why I got so many girls on my testicals
I like em flexible so be able to stretch
And sex gets incredible when the Cuban's on the set, I bet
I'll make you sweat like heat my Technics
Cause we from freak over feet on any day of the week
I keep a hicky, chicks pick me because they love the chinky
I kick a (?), I got them wrapped around my pinky, like Biggie
I'm ""Unbelievable"" this Cubanito keeps a full tank of diesl fuel
Just in case you need to go that extra mile
In sex I'm Wilder than Gene
And in between the sheets, im a show you just what I mean


I walk into the fuck-in Tunnel
 (I ain't a player)
Bitches on my dick and wan-na dance (C'mon)
I remember when it wasn't like that (Hold it up Pun)
You call me blimp but now it's baby fat, must be the music


We'll keep ya hot till the, day light
We'll keep ya movin all through the night",https://genius.com/Big-pun-must-be-the-music-lyrics
"Sex, Money & Drugs",Slam: The Soundtrack,UnKnown,"Whoahhh yes (Next)
Honey yes yes (Big Pun)
Intro/Chorus: Big Pun and Next
(Sex)     Sex money and drugs
(Money)   Where I rest it's all about whips honeys and thugs
(& Drugs) See me run with the Playboy Bunnies up in the clubs
But I only trust the homies that know me now show me love
(Sex)     For my thugs what?  Sex money and drugs
(Money)   Where I rest it's all about whips honeys and thugs
(& Drugs) See me run with the Playboy Bunnies up in the clubs
But I only trust the homies that know me now show me love

Let's Talk About Sex, quiet as kept, we all X-rated
The flesh make it hard to resist, I can't take it
But I'm only human, on a quest to find a horny woman
Lonely enough to ball with me, Seis, Tone and Cuban
We run trains like Amtraks, orally remove your Tampax
To show you how a real man acts
I ain't embarassed, but I ain't ready for no baby carriage
Especially if the date is average and I ain't a savage
We be at it like jackrabbits, I'm a Kraftmatic
So catch your breath, if you asthmatic
Let me backstab it with my magic wand, ask your moms
If Long Dong can fuck with Don Juan it's on
Got my jaw right on top of your spine, relaxin your mind
I'm top of the line so it's not gonna slime
It's not just a rhyme precious, it's my pleasure
It's just another day in the hood for me and my niggas
My niggas
Chorus

Aiyyo I want it all, you could call me greedy or superficial
Long as my crew's official and pulls they pistols soon as I whistle
I'm tryin to triple a million and split it three ways
Joe the God, full eclipsin myself, that'll be the day
I need a way to get it already got the ambition
Start the ignition watch for the NARCs in the marked expedition
I'm on a mission which requires a higher position
Desire efficient used the fire inside of me glistenin
And I'm infinite like math so I'm gonna last
Whatchu wanna laugh all day, bullshittin sittin on your ass
I'm all about the cash and the power, I stash with the powder
The dash like hittin ass for an hour, let's get it locked
I want a watch with baguetted rocks
So I can clock hoes with the glow that never stops
Forget the cops, we got digits and Glocks too
Ready to rock, whoever tryin to stop my cheddar from stockin forever
Chorus

It's hard holdin on, singin the words to the same song
Remainin strong through the storm but the rain is long
The pain is gone only when I sleep
But even then when I'm in it deep I dream that I'm bein beat
I seen the beast take life and say he had a knife
The truth was, he had a wife who never even had a fight
It's paradise for some and hell for others, they tell us
They love us long as we kill our brothers and stay out the suburbs
These motherfuckers think we dumb and blind, but there come
A time in life when I gotta fight for what is mine
So I'ma shine summertime hard, feel me rhyme God
Alter your light table like a tripod, it's type hard
So you need to listen, if you puffin weed or sniffin
Motherfuckers always gonna treat you different
Play your position, don't get caught up in the game
Cause snortin cocaine, is like feedin pork to the brain
Get it together

Quiet On Tha Set,Straight Outta Compton: N.W.A 10th Anniversary Tribute ,UnKnown," Terror Squad!!

This is goin' out to the mothafuckin' punks and broke ass tricks
Don't Tryin' to come up in here
Up in here pumpin' that shit, I will straight blast you
You better break yourself mothafucker
Shit!! punk ass tricks, bitch
Take it hard ---] Eazy-E
Yo, kick it ---] Eazy-E

Ruthless, plenty of that and much more
So at the party, Terror is controllin' the floor
That you step up and do your dance routine
It ain't a dream my man, you're in a gangster scene
With a villain, doin' damage on a 24 track
With confusion to finish my conclusion
Arhytomatic rhymes from a Radio cat
You can't take what I got
Cause I'll be takin' it right back
Ruthless gangster ---] MC Ren
Cold killin, you wanna know what it means?
Definition... Villain ---] MC Ren
With the stupid dope rhymes
And once you hear one line, you can tell it's mine
With a baseball cap that's black that I'm wearin'
And a look that keeps you all starin'
And wonderin, why I'm invincible
But when you hear my rhyme, it's convincible
I don't take no shorts, while I'm constructin' the ground
That makes you movin' around, from the hell of the sound
Girls drool on me like a dyin'

Pun, tell them what you do when your ass start rhymin'

I go to the party, I hip and hop the spot
I don't know what it is, but the girls kept knock the aspirin'
Like they're on fire and
Their so-called boy friends with them are retirin'
And for this reason I'm a walkin' threat
So when I step on the stage, I want quiet on the set


Now to get started with my musical profession
A gangster feelin' in mind is in session
The way that I'm referrin to this, makes you move your butt
But don't stand in a daze, you should know what's up
Anyway, I keep the clappin' along
Cause nothin' bad could go wrong because this track is so strong
I'm like throw you the.. you can ask for anythin' more
When the Terror Squad is cold rockin' the floor
Like stupid, actin' like a retard
Waitin' for a bumrush, gettin' to the good part
It tips me so with temptation
Writin' my lyrics with hyped information
This is just a section of my creation
So don't say shit with finesse fination
Just look at the center of the stage where the spotlight shines
It's mine, unpredictable, keepin' you extremely enjoyed
It's irresistable, meanin' that you can't avoid
And while I'm on stage, feel forward to sweat
Whenever I rip it up, I want quiet on the set

Yeah, what?, what?
Terror Squad, Terror Squad
Yeah

Now I can be loud as hell, you think I will? Never
Ssssht, quiet on the set ---] Eazy-E
Yeah, I like that better ---] MC Ren
Word ---] Dr. Dre
That's what I can do, I think I earned respect
And if I didn't from you, that's what I expect
Cause if it ain't rough, it ain't me, it ain't me ---] Eazy-E
So who really cares how you want me to be?
See, I'm just me, standin' at the top of the pile
And doin' soft known tunes, just ain't my style
And this concludes our program
Of how The Terror Squad makes the Ruthless Jam
Now first, we take an average Gun
Give it to Pun, and the boy gets dumb
It's no secret, that I sit alone at night
Pick up the pad and the pen and begin to write
And lay down the lyrics that's promised to play
Hear everybody says:

Check it in, check it out
Put it in, take it out
Make it out, yeah, Terror Squad baby
What?, what?, what?

Yeah, now Cuban Link is here workin' like super glue
No matter what I do, I'm always thinkin' of you
Cause I'm the pusher, supplyin' the fix
And this jam's so dope, it don't need a remix
But I'm makin' obstacles, an enemy traps
To catch any Emcee, with the weak-ass raps
Crucifyin' their data, cause you're usin' my name
The definition is pain, but that's the thing of the game
If they tried to retreat, I catch them one at a time
Cause they're comittin a crime, but still promotin' a rhymes
So, you're in the back of me, just listen and learn
Because you'll all get a chance, or maybe a turn
My sideman wants to give a preview
So at my next concert, I wanna see you there
Not sittin' in a chair, standin' on both feet with your hands in the air
Now I'm about to get out, but I'll be back
But next time expect the more funkier track
Deep down for your enjoyment, to hear more percussion
With lyrics that's smooth, to start some discussion
To prove that I'm hype, now, you know that's a bet
So continue to dance, Cuban blew up the set

I don't wanna be a playa no more
I'm not a playa I just crush a lot
But Big Punisher, still got what you're lookin' for
For my thugs (I don't wanna be), for my thugs (I don't wanna be a playa no more)
I don't wanna be a playa no more
I'm not a playa I just crush a lot
But you know Big Punisher still down by law
Who's down to crush a lot

Hey yo, I'm still not a player but you still a hater
Elevator to the top hah, see you later, I'm gone
Penthouse suite, Penthouse freaks
In house beach, French countess, ten thou piece
Rent-out lease, with a option to buy
Coppin' a five-oh Benz for when I'm not, far up in the sky
Puffin' the lye, from my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my kiko from Queens, nicknamed Perico
We go back like PA's and wearin PJ's
Now we reach the peakage, runnin trains for three days
Who wanna ride it won't cost you a dollar
Whether soft or harder of course you still gonna holla
My, my, I'm big huh, I rip my through your hooters
I'm sick, you couldn't measure my  with six rulers
Hold up, chula, I'm all about getting' loot
But I knock that boot, if you out to get HOOF

But you know Big Punisher still down by law
Who's down to crush tonight

I love from butter pecan to blackberry molass'
I don't discriminate, I regulate every shade of the
Long as you show class, and pass my test
Fat and breasts, highly intelligent bachlorettes
That's the best, I won't settle for less
I wanna ghetto brunette, with unforgettable sex
I lay your head on my chest, come feel my heartbeat
We can park the Jeep, pump Mobb Deep and just spark the leaf
It's hard to creep since I found Joe
Every pretty round brown wanna go down low
But this Boogie Down pro-fessional, I'm let you know
Once I put the blows, get your clothes, 'cause you got to go
I could go downstairs, little brown hairs everywhere
""You nasty Twin!"" I don't care
Round here they call me Big Pun, if you with the big guns
Thick tongue, known to make a chick (come)

(In the) hot tub, poppin bubb-ly
Rubbin your spot love, got you screamin Punish me
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked
When I even Luke be like ""Don't stop, get it get it""
(In the) hot tub, poppin bubb-ly
Rubbin your spot love, got you screamin Punish me
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked
When I even Luke be like ""Don't stop, get it get it""

Any stupid ass can blast a foe
And let me know who man enough to go toe to toe
Somebody let me know
Who's not afraid to go blow for blow
And show how real niggas really roll

Yo
Niggas know not to front
I can knock a chump out the box
And just stomp
 fuck a Glock or pump
So pop the trunk and grab your .38
Ill snap your fucking vertebrae
And match your early date to the pearly gates
My murder rate is phenomenal
What I'mma do
Is crush your abdominals
Save the talk for Donahue
This I promise you
Big Punisher gotta keep it real
A puerto rock gorilla blowin' spots like godzilla
A crowd thrilla' in the rap arena
The Bob Jab and weaver
That keeps niggas on their toes like ballerinas

I""ll bag ya team up in a hundred heftys
If you wanna come and test me
Son forget the guns and knuckle up against me
Ill fuck you up like Dempsey but without the gloves
Spit out the double edge﻿ and wet ya motherfucking mug
Wit blood
Im rough and rugged
I shine like a nugget
Im the last motherfucker that you ever wanna fuck wit
Up it
Or get stuck by the Cuban Link
I do my thing bringing it back and forth like a boomerang
You can't hang
So think again before you start rappin'
We make it happen
Two Latin thugs too tough to flatten

Fuck the clappin' lets get to scrappin'
Grapplin' on the floor
Niggas thinking they hardcore till I lock the door
Figure four
!
Break ya ankles
Shank ya face make you scream thank you
Hang you off the roof naked just to make an example
Handle ya business
In this game there ain't too many winners
Any nigga can render your existence if his aim is better
Hold ya fort down whether with or without the four pound
New York down for whatever
What up twin

I never back down
I hold my ground and pound a body like Muhammad Ali
Papi we can lock up﻿ in the lobby
I be
Bobbin and weaving leaving niggas out of breath
Then I dig in they chest with my 5 fingers of death
TS bringing it live from the boogie
My crew be too deep
Our biggest pussy will make sushi out chok and suki
So for the rookies who be talking in riddles
How many hits it'll take
Before I break through your middle?

You too little
I'm cock diesel with evil intent
Leave you with dents bent off the fear that your people repent
Set it
Lets get it on like Marvin I'm starving to fight
Gem Starring em slice like an orator carve with a knife
Im deadly
Niggas already dread me in every scary area beware of the jaw burier
Big dog's the terrier
Tearing the ears off of artists
That's mostly cartilage
No bullshitting
You rip em right off just pull em hard enough
Rolling with us
You must be ready for death hit you with so many rights
You going beg for a left

Let's go toe to toe
Any stupid ass can blast a foe
And let me know who man enough to go toe to toe

Legendary Cypher,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Fake, lyrically handsome, call collect a king's ransom
Jams I write soon become the ghetto anthem
Way out like Bruce Wayne's mansion, move like a phantom
You'll talk about me to your grandsons
Cats who claiming they hard be mad fags
So I run through 'em like flood water through sandbags
Competition is mad, what I got, they can't have
Sinking they ship, like Moby Dick to Ahab
Son I'm way past the minimum, entering millennium
My raps will hold a gat to your back like Palestinians
Ancient Abyssinia, sure to hold the Gideon
Official b-boy gentlemen, long term, never the interim
Born inside the winter wind, day after December 10
These simpletons they mentioned in the synonym for feminine
Sweeter than some cinnamon, the Danish rings by Entenmann's
Rush up on adrenaline, they get they asses sent to them
Gentlemen you got a tenement, well then assemble it!
Leave your unit trembling like herds of moving elephant
Intelligent embellishment, follow for your element
From Flatbush settlement, skin possesses melanin
Hotter than tales of crack peddling, making em WOOP
Like blue gelatin, swing like Duke Ellington
Broader than Barrington Levy, believe me
The hot Apache red who burn down your chief teepee
You see me?

Yo, niggas don't know so I gotta flip
It seem they've forgotten how dark it could get
Barks like a pit scratch when I hit
We both know you pussy but you stay talking shit
What I'mma have to do dog, run up in yo mess
Catch you while you comfortable put one up in yo chest
One up in yo vest, of course they the hollows
You goin' away today, you just lost tomorrow
I'mma go platinum (nah) you gots to be kiddin' WHY
Make it double platinum, no bullshittin'
And I'mma stay flippin' flows, rippin' shows
Strippin' ho's, gettin dough let me go
And niggas know, who the best is
The dog, DMX is the rest is or might as well be helpless
I wreck this cause when I wreck shit
I might snatch a niggas necklace
Then go from like midnight to breakfast

Yo, yo, my Alma mater is the rooftop, back in '85
With summer cookouts to crack lookouts
Mega-hookers with pocketbooks out
The corner's where we hung out, my uncle that was strung out
Beef during the drought and all the guns that we brung out
Niggas hustle for cloud, Brownsville street type bouts
Blackouts, ultra-lootin', door to door army recruitin'
Drug lords continue shootin' in weathers, and come Novembers
Sleep in red snow, where niggas bled so, the spot control
Gold-chains with diamond-links makes product in kitchen sinks
Think tanks matching to banks, stuck up bitches actin' stank
Gun-play without provisions, went on twenty-type collisions
Weed spots getting took when po-nine run the jooks
Crooked beats crooks be lurkin' hurtin'
To catch a body workin' to say they perks when
It's a nigga head they burstin' first and last
I'll lock your block then smack that ass
Cum-laude and street-wise, slide fast

Alright, I'm in fascination with the shorter words, turn to audible
Put a little more to it try to blow through
See it's like the way you think and I've been made to endure
I floored rap like  
Gangs, straightaways moving out of buckets, some change
Paralyzed while I hit you like Colombian King
And I'm soaring, killing words they couldn't explain
Spark flames, so it burn slow, feeling me every bit
As much as Dutch know though, a ransom, my thumbs crush
My motivation lands where the guns bust
I know myself and the law we might trust
Mic like a cold-brush, goin' front porch to the street
Movin' through this life of speed
Tryna square and exonerate, they're here to eat
Besides that, dude you got me feeling the beat
It's like this, freestyle off of the cap
With my nigga Big Pun, cause he bust mad raps
That's DMX, we rock this shit, no doubt
With my nigga Canibus, let me show you how
Now we get down to the specifics, the Heineken
I be grabbing up the mic before we rhyme again
What time again? Don't talk to brainless such
People around the way tell me that I smoke too much
I'm rolling in the Dutch, that's the thing I do
While I'm chilling with my niggas from the Q.U
The zoo niggas ride, we like gorillas and such
While we ripping you through cause we just too much
Freestyle off the top of my brain, I maintain
Showing the motherfucking stress in the game
Still I wouldn't break, the flow fast, Speedy McSlow
Geronimo, I get the dough nigga, what?

I shatter dreams like Jordan, assault and batter your team
Your squadron'll be barred from rap
Like Adam and Eve from the garden
I'm carving my initials on your forehead
So every night before bed you see the BP shine
Off the board-head, reverse that, I curse at the first whack
Nigga with the worst rap cause he ain't worth jack
Hit him with a thousand pounds of pressure per slap
Make his whole body jerk back, watch the Earth crack
Hand him his purse back
I'm the first Latin rapper to baffle your skull
Master the flow, niggas be swearin' I'm blacker than coal
Like Nat King, I be rapping and tongues packing the ones
Magnums, cannons and Gatling guns
It's Big Pun, the one and only son of Tony Montana
You ain't promised mañana in the rotten manzana
C'mon pana, we need more rhymers
Feel the marijuana snake bite; anaconda
A man of honor wouldn't wanna try to match my persona
Sometimes rhymin' I blow my own mind like Nirvana
Comma and go the whole nine like Madonna
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
I'm pure adrenaline uncut, straight to the gut medicine
Raw cure for pain, I coat your brain like polyurethane
Simple and plain I'll explain it in layman terms
If you came to learn how to make fire, I'mma make it burn
Higher and hotter than lava, the scholar adviser
As smart as MacGyver can put honor inside the heart of a liar
Involved in a life of crime, fuck it I like the shine
Up in the white and lime, clutch with the pipe design
Plushed out, both pockets about to bust out
If you not in it for the spinach, get the fuck out
Take a hike, we can even battle to make it right
Go 'head, lace the mic, you finished, say goodnight
Head-to-head in the street, I'll leave you dead in your feet
Settling beef, I'll even let you rhyme to the Benjamin beat
But it won't matter, your dreams still gon' shatter
It's a long ladder to climb and mine is on stagger
So get outta town, 'fore I hit you with the loudest sound
You ever heard, desert bird player, you outta bounds
You could ramble out the mouth, like you Rambo
But you slouch, if we battled you'd be out
Without a shadow of a doubt and that's the ugly truth
Killers walk with muddy boots
Once my dogs cut me loose, that's a bullet in your bubbly-goose
Fuck is you talkin' like you crazy? Barkin' like you wady
I'll have you crawlin, walking like a baby
Don't try to play me cause I'm not a playa
Aiyyo I shot the place up and pass the heat off like a hot potata
I'm 'bout to make a million dollars but still I'm rowdy
So I hope I'm rap and rhyming before I have to kill somebody
That's how it is in the stone jungle if you known to own a bundle
Guaranteed a nigga gon mug you
And no one love you when you broke as shit
Focus kid, commercials don't lie, curse you to die
Coke is it, rob your life away, that's a big price to pay
Forgetting to teach his kid how to ride his bike today stupid

Let the world know the truth, you don't want me to shine
You studied my rhyme, then you laid your vocals after mine
That's a bitch move, somethin that a homosexual rapper would do
So when you say that you platinum, you only dropping clues
I studied your background, read the book that you wrote
Researched your footnotes about how you used to sniff coke
Fronting like a drug-free role model, you disgust me
I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently
You walk around showing off your body ‘cause it sells
Plus to avoid the fact that you ain't got skills
Mad at me ‘cause I kick that shit real niggas feel
While ninety-nine percent of your fans wear high heels
From Ice-T to Kool Moe Dee to Jay-Z
Now you want to fuck with me? Nigga you crazy
You dripping with wack juice, and you can't get it off
You better be prepared to finish what you start
Give me the respect that I deserve or I'mma take it by force
Blast you with a fourty-five colt, make you somersault
Shock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts
Before you wanted a war, now you wanna talk
It's about who strikes the hardest, not who strikes first
That's why I laugh when I hear that wack ass verse
That shit was the worst rhyme I ever heard in my life
‘Cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March ninth
God bless his soul rest in peace, kid
It's because of him now at least I know what beef is
It's not what I would call this, see this is something different
A faggot nigga tryna make a livin' off of dissin'
Somebody that he gotta know is better than him
But he feeling himself ‘cause he got more cheddar than him
Well let me tell you something: you might got more cash then me
But you ain't got the skills to eat a nigga's ass like me
And if you really want to show off, we can get it on
Live in front of the cameras on your own sitcom
I'll let you kick a verse... fuck it, I'll let you kick 'em all
I'll even wait for the studio audience to applaud
Clap, clap, now watch me rip the tat from your arm
Stick you in the groin, kick you in your Vanguard award
Stacks a Vanguard award
In front of your mom, your first, second and third-born
Make your wife get on the horn, call Minister Farrakhan
So he could persuade me to squash it, I say ""Naw, he started it
He forgot what a hardcore artist is""
A hardcore artist is a dangerous man, such as myself
Trained to run twenty miles in soft sand
On or off land, programmed to kick hundreds of bars off-hand
From a lost and forgotten land
You done did it, man, you done spitted some wack shit
And probably thought that because it's been a minute I'll forget it?
Fuck that! ‘Cause like Common and Cube, I see the bitch in you
And I'mma make the world see it too
Straight-up and down

Canibus and the Punisher
The ultimate executioner's dream
Swinging the guillotine
Cause whenever the head is severed from the human body with a sharp enough weapon
The brain remains conscious for ten seconds
Long enough for me to give you one last message
And when you get to Hell, you can tell Lucifer I said it
Don't ever get it confused
Fuckin' with Canibus the human Rubik's Cube like you got something to prove
Yo, whoever grabs the mic after me will get booed
Get everything in the club thrown at you and your crew
From Moet bottles, to bar stools, fruits, and foods
You got a album out? You get hit with your CD, too
Runnin' outside lyin', cryin', denyin'
That you ain't The Gay Rapper but you got fucked by him
What's the difference? Y'all niggas still ain't in lyrical fitness
Too busy mixin' your bidness with your bitches
While I be in the lab composing forbidden scriptures
So wicked, I got Satan ejaculating all over his fingers
Like Dirk Diggler in the middle of Boogie Nights
Sniffin' white, living the hype, he ruined his life
But I'm a MC of a different type, yeah, that's right
So make sure your grip is tight or I'ma snatch your mic
Word up, like that",https://genius.com/Big-pun-legendary-cypher-lyrics
Hot 97 freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Ay-yo my murderous rap verbal attack is actual fact
Tactical tracks match perfectly with graphical stats
Half of you lack the magical dap of tragical rap
That tackles you back and shackles and laughs at you
That's, mathematical madness I'm on, the savage, the strong
The marriage, a bond of havoc and song
This massacre's on as if Picasso laced you
There's lotsa hateful skeletons locked
In the closet of my castle of Grayskull
I'm possum at grade school, that's how I have to debate you
Raps are like cables, snatchin' you fatal
That's how master degrades you
I'm battlin' Jesus (hay-soo) if he passes through my label
Snatchin' his halo
God I pray that you send my father back as an angel
Language is fatal and it's hypnotizin'
I'm only emphasizin', I'm still all about business and enterprisin'
I'm super lyrical, a brain boosts the chemicals
That's used contenicals inside of my mental projectable

Just call me Baby Jesus cuz lately niggas is praisin' me
Just for the way I blaze to be crazily, tape to CD lasery
It pays to be amazingly flavery
Gaze Into my eyes that basically hypnotize you occasionally
Plus I'm hard to talk to, if you live I probably thought you stalked you
Where you walked to at night, caught you then tried to extort you
New York niggas is trigger happy, Pataki scared
This town ain't big enough for both of us (And we ain't Goin' Nowhere)
There it is, plain and simple like Jigga my game is mental
While slow niggas better know I blow their brains out they temples
I'm into black magical torture romantic dramatical author
Compatible with the average New Yorker
A fast talker, like Tony when gas whores I'm the masked enforcer
Out for the cash and the cho-cha
Smash the coca, bottle it up watch the fiends gobble it up
If I roll up, you do what? Swallow the stuff
I don't give a fuck any more, I'm only twenty-four years old
And I've already broken every law
I'm horrorcore, this is for the heads
Runnin' up in your crib, knot if you still hot in under the bed

Ay-yo I shatter dreams like Jordan, assault and batter your team
Your squadron'll be barred from rap like Adam & Eve from the garden
I'm carvin' my initials on your forehead
So every night before bed you see the ""BP"" shine off the (board head)
Reverse that, I curse at the first wack nigga with the worst rap
Cuz he ain't worth jack
Hit 'em with a thousand pounds of pressure per slap
Make his whole body jerk back, watch the earth crack
Hand him his purse back
I'm the first Latin rapper to baffle your skull
Master the flow, niggas be swearin' I'm blacker than coal
Like Nat King, I be rappin' and tongue's packin'
The ones, magnums, cannons and gatlin' guns
It's Big Pun! The one and only son of Tony, Montana
You ain't promised manana in the rotten manzana
C'mon-pana we need more rhymers
Feel the marijuana snake bite anaconda
I'm in Ivana with wine-a, try to match my persona
Sometimes rhymin' I blow my own mind like Nirvana
Comma, and go the whole nine like Madonna
Go try to find another rhymer with my kinda gramma",https://genius.com/Big-pun-hot-97-freestyle-lyrics
Rhyme for Rhyme,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Enter my world of doom, consume fear and feel the panic
I ram a lightning bolt between the earth and the moon and curl the planets
I'm bell Atlantic with lyrics expanding for galaxies
Battle me mathematically, I'm giving your wisdom a cavity
Rapidly flowing, controlling the time, jump over the line
I'm blowing your mind, with just a flow of the rhyme
I'm Hogan in his prime, too strong and fast, niggas' could bomb and blast
C'mon, you still be on your ass
I'm satisfaction guaranteed, spit fiction like Quentin Tarantine
Kick you in your baddest dream, shit you haven't seen
I have to be perfectly honest
We should have an anniversary to acknowledge, the way I work the Ebonics
I verbally vomit on novice niggas' that try to kid us with garbage lyrics
My style delivers, outside the outer limits
I'm like the pyramids cause every point is precise, now you know me for life
3 pound Cuban studded with ice

Yo as d.e.a predicted, I'm in my PJ's waving a biscuit
Cops raided my lab, and enslaved my mistress
When I speak, you listenin'. The way I rhyme I leave precision
Until your mind freak your mic out in each position
The 5 40 out piped out with deep dishes
Check the flow, never test it yo
I manifest it like drug connects pitch and blow
Destined for greatness, check they way my necklace glow
Fake niggas' hate this. You think something sweet about me?

Yo, yo, yo, yo...
Yo, yo...

It's hard to explain how my squad can harbor the strain
Of being the largest name in rap, since the almighty Kane
Acknowledge the fame
My college terrain was the rugged streets from Harlem to Queens
Back to the Bronx who fathered the dream
That Started this thing called rap, where I reign supreme
, my team
Regardless of that, I've seen things as far as a crack
That'll make the hardest largest artist heart just collapse
I'm part of all that that's why it's so hard to go back
And start it from scratch
I'm locked and I'm trapped in a giant cage
Tryin to savor these few dyin days
I have left, to the form of flesh
Should I lie in my grave?
I'm tryin to persuade, my mind to try to be brave
And not give death the satisfaction of seein me dyin afraid
That's why I rise from the grave singing church songs like
I was Je-sus Christ ba-rum-pum-pum-pum

Whatcha gon' do when Pun comes?
Knockin' at ya front door
And he wants waaaaaaaaaaar.. ooooh (holy shit) yeah
He ain't a rapper he'll kill you

Till my last breath I'll have death before dishonor
(come on) and welcome drama (yeah)
Wit open arms and a code of honor
My hole persona equals that of gods
Definin' matters hard and more before you even had a job
I'll stab and rob if I have to
Fuck it i'll blast you, tell the devil it was Pun if he ask you
And let him know how we be deadin' um'
Show 'em my emblem, the tombstone, the throne, 
every millennium
A child is born that can perform at a level beyond
The expected 4 minute 30 second song
We reign supreme, my team be all up in ya dream
Wit the ""kill anything"" grill, chillin' beside the guilotine
Executioner style, black suit and a smile
Who's next to get they neck hacked loose in the crowd, move from the aisle
Don't make me have to prove that I'm wild
Word to Cuban, my crew killers, y'all niggas shoot in the clouds
(Who's in the house)
Punisher's straight from hell. Who's in the house

And Pun's got a big nine, respect crime

The shit I'm on is wrong but it lasts long
Pull a fast one, then Pun'll wake up
With the stash gone
I'm mad strong and my cream is fast
Smoke the greenest grass, my bitch got the meanest ass
And a taste legit, I don't have to waste a whole case of Crist'
All it takes is my pretty face and my gangsta wit
Lace the click 'cause we all share
It's all fair like love and war, thug galore with the long hair
Big Pun, Pun the name that makes the kids run
Like spelling murder reverse it deliver redrum
Come one, come all, if you wanna brawl
I'm the mighty Thor clotheslining motherfuckers
Like Steven Seagal, 'cause all you gonna get
Is your ass kicked or up in a casket
That's it, that's it

Punisher bash it, at last it's, rappers that really blast shit
Cats getting Big Willie niggas like Billy Bathgate
Up in Jimmy's Cafe, having caviar
Cracking Cristal at the bar, smoking cigars, living large
We rob and steal, run with the mob, doing jobs for bills
I'm hard to kill for real nigga guard your grill
I like to chill, spark an L and get high
I'm one hell of a guy, fly pelican fly
Whattup Duke-o, you know, politicking papi chuco
I'm out here, watching for Jake, getting this loot though

Swerving like a A.K.A. in Beirut yo
Squeezing, out of automatic M3's and
Please, you ain't seen no thugs like these
I can tell you lots of things that'll make you believe
In Corona yo it's better to take than to receive
Your career's on life support and I'ma pull the plug
And have every thug shooting that Beatnut drug
In they blood, no escaping this
Niggas is going over their favorite shit to be taping this
(For what?)
World premier, loud and clear
Lye and beer, get the dough, blow up the show
Disappear, jump in the Cavalier
Feeling marvelous, street pharmacist, twist arboles
For pleasure, bring your territory sever
Keep my workers under pressure got 'em saying fuck Lester
But that's aight Duke-o, my heart nowadays too cold
Don't give a fuck where you been what you done
Where you go, you know, peep this favorite
In black shades like a secret, agent
We're night thieves, roll up on you sleeves
We light trees, bust these and stack cheese
It's off the hook this year
Making mad money off the books this year, ain't nothing
But crooks in here
Getting mad money off the books this year

Making mad money off the books this year, ain't nothing

Ya'll are made of shit I'm the thug's ingredients
And for my niggas I peel like fucked up paint jobs
Cover your block and put holes in you like old blankets
Fuck a bitch use a sock and wipe my nut what?
Run in your spot and use a Glock to get my cut what?
Smack you in public and embarrass you slut what?
Put you on punishment the same way I do to my son
And the only bullets by my stomach be the clip from my gun
And when my gun busts it's over so close the curtains
My silencer's like ch, ch, ch like birds was chirping

Busting out that custard cream

King of medallions Monty Guard
Even Italians see my battalion prop the broad

Range Rover tilted three wilted hydraulic slide
Spark the Live in the crowd ripping trough housings

Go ask my pre school, even talk to my old principal
He'd tell you how you I used to pack a no. 2 pencil
Stabbin' students, grabbin' teachers, catholics, preachers
In the school staircase, cuttin' class, passin' my reefer
In my own class, operation return, they tried to say
I was incompetent, not able to learn
The table turned now, got my own label to earn
Like that nigga said in, Dead Presidents, money to burn
Queensbridge, pay homage, respect nas is the vet
Acknowledge the rep, polish baguettes, niggas is dissin' that
I'm just the best, puttin' all violence to rest
Between Latin Kings the blood Los sangres, blood in Spanish
So many thugs vanish, unite the system
To fight with inner street wisdom, to help teach a prison
My crew puff lye, anyone test the Pun must die
Just give me one try, now you know you done fucked up right?'
Hah, you ain't got no wins in my casa
Que te pasa, you ain't even in my clasa

I'm Terror Squad beta kappa everybody's favorite rapper

The same nigga who known to blow out your brain mineral
I reign subliminal inside your visual
Try to supply your physical with my spiritual side of this lyrical
I'll appear in your dreams, like Freddie do, no kidding you
Even if I stuttered I would still shit on you
Soon as I chitter chatter you shitter shatter, I'm the kid
Out of Bronx, that'll stomp you to death like it didn't matter

Better believe that, whenever I see y'all I'ma test ya
Only 'cause I know that fagots respect pressure

'Kiss ain't the cops, but I lock niggas up
You could meet me in my cell I soak and sock niggas up
Far as the flow go, you could let your dough show
Put your money on the table, we could battle on cable

Fuck around with Jason, that shorty from The Lox, John Blazin
My son cool out don't beef yo, throw the tool out

Let's run these niggas, kidnap they work, make 'em move out
Crushed hash, hands is like glass, keep the heat
In the dash, did some dirt for some work, caught a gash
The flicker blocker, wicked sneaker rocker footwear
Strike me out God, stackin' up joints, rack 'em like Footlocker
This is raw, raw like fuck kid, represent
Here to Crenshaw, hold my words stronger than a Benz stall
Relentless, the anthology consolidated
With the quickness, dress up in the wig and blouse, killer sickness

Beat the bogus squad brains that connect put on the older God

If you ever see me with the Feds you can bet it's in the cuffs
Ain't no snitch in us, bitch in us
Unofficialness, everything we outside you wish you was
Official thugs in the drug profession
Drug connections, drug addictions
Still seein' the judge for drug possession
The four-D's, all these is more reas'
To either get big or leave and let live
We the best there is T.S., ain't nobody else
We probably Dove 'cause we all way on top of the shelf

Don't try to breeze or I'ma squeeze
And blast the back of your knees
Just pass the cheese, please don't test the toaster
My tech'll roast ya body faster than Ferrari's Testarossa
You're gettin' closer to death
Reaper's got a hold on your breath
You goin' straight to hell as you sell your soul for your flesh
You was posin' a threat, now you froze in the bed
Minute ago, you was poppin' shit, holdin' ya dick
Now what's the problem, you ain't nuttin'
Like you said on your album
I thought you was wildin', bustin'
Your guns and runnin' the island
You was't violent, you was silent
Tryin' to get college credits
How pathetic, did it to get out of the calisthetics?
I'm Dianetics combined with lyrics
My matureness is my insurance
Kill my appearance, I'm a shinin' spirit

You gotta cheer it, you can't win you better join 'em

Brain-bolic with knowledge, cock-diesel scholars
Holdin' it down, walkin' around with gold by the pound
Frozen and drowned with diamond boulders all in the crown
Talk of the town, soakin' you down wit toast 'til you drown
Ghost you and pound your corpse with a force that'll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns, I'm on the serious tip
You keep playin' and I get furious quick
And now I take you for a walk through the ghetto
Either spark your metal or get outlined in chalk by the devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit, I used to clap shit
Now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a mac in back of the Acura
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
It's like that, but don't think I won't counter act

Future Flavas Freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Aiyyo it's such a shame All these dick riders trying to corrupt the game  But what it bring, nothing but pain And one in your fuckin brain Ain't nuttin changed since the album I'm still whylin I'm still violent I've been waiting for this moment Like Phil Collins, for all my life I've been trifer than trifer Hyper than hype, when fighting to fight It's like, tonight is the night And I ain't even trying to let a nigga slide I've been dyin to get a gat I dared to try now prepare to die I rush your crib like Jehovah's Witness, blow up any Soldiers, infants, hold up, did you notice my heroic entrance? I'm so relentless in this field of rap, everything is real in fact Fully backed by bullies who be peeling caps I sack the rapper like linebacker, play my rhyme backwards You can hear the Devil speak his mind with fine graphics Things get drastic, Express for my plastic I pack clips, between my nuts and my fat dick",https://genius.com/Big-pun-future-flavas-freestyle-lyrics

If Jakes chase me - I'm cuttin off trucks, pressin my LUCK
