Mistadobalina,I Wish My Brother George Was Here ,1991.0,"Ahh, I know I'm drunk now
Ladies and gentlemen, I for-I forgot my
My favorite man, sittin' over there
His name is...

Mista Dobalina, Mista Bob Dobalina
Mista Bob Dobalina, won't you quit?
You really make me sick with ya fraudulent behavior
You're gonna make me flip and then an army couldn't save ya
Why don't you behave ya little rugrat?
Take a little tip from the tabloid, because I know I'm not paranoid
When I say I saw ya tryin' to mock me
Now you and your crew are on a mission tryin' to hawk me
But it isn't happenin' ya fraudulent foes
You used to front big time now I suppose
That everything's cool since the style of apparel you adopted
You used to make fun of but now you wanna rock it
So you gotta kick it with the homies
But D-E-L is already hip to your cronies
Me and CM-PX thought about this and never have we seen a
Brother who could hover Mista, Mista, Mista Dobalina

Ooh, ooh, Mista Dobalina, you thought ya could manipulate
You thought you could fool me, ooh, ooh, Mista Dobalina
Teacher used to put me on a stump
And then he schooled me

Friends can be fraudulent, just you wait and see
First he was my moneygrip then he stole my honeydip
Mista Dobalina is a serpent, don't you agree?
The little two-tima resembles Aunt Jemima
With jeans and a dirty white hoodie
Seems like he wouldn't be a snake or would he?
Disguises come in all sizes and shapes
Notice the facade of the snakes
They all catch the vapes, even though last year they was GQ
Took a lot of time before the D-E-L could see through
The mask, all I had to do was ask Hemperor and Kwamé
And my man responded they would bomb a
Fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules
The way ya on my dick must really hurt ya knees
You need to take heed and quit being such a groupie
Ever since I did a little show in Guadeloupee
I neva saw a groupie like you
But what is funny is ya wanted to be down with my crew
But D-E-L is not down with any clowns or jesters
So I would suggest that you try to impress Uncle Fester, Dobalina
Because ya don't impress me Dobalina
The style of dress is not the key Dobalina
It's all in the mind and the heart, so you should start
By remembering ya gotta pay a fee Dobalina

If You Must,Both Sides of the Brain,2000.0,"It's important to practice good hygiene
At least if you wanna run with my team
I'm 'bout to get into some shit that I've seen
This fool's breath hummin' so bad it'll melt your ice cream
They say don't say nothing if you can't say nice things
Sittin' too close to him on BART, like my eyes sting
I try to be subtle, hand him a stick of gum
I was a victim of breath on hum
Running his yap about what sets he from
Gotta get some gum, gotta gets him some
He turned it down, his teeth was brown
Excruciating, foreign, it was a new sensation
I had to ask the dope to pass the soap
'Cause his coat had the stench of crustaceans
Or bathrooms in a bus station
He had a can of Olde E and some raisins
Amazing... head to toe B.O
He didn't know, used to the fragrance
'Cause as the days went without bathing
He felt manly and not like a maiden
He had one dread, and fungus
Said he worked on peoples' toilets with plungers
Girls, not the guy you would want to tongue ya
So guys take your cue from this little number

You gotta wash your ass, if you must
You gotta wash your hair, if you must
You gotta brush your teeth, if you must
Or else you'll be funky
You gotta wash your ass, if you must
You gotta wash your hair, if you must
You gotta brush your teeth, if you must
Or else you'll be funky
*scratching* ""To wash up""

Now in class you need total concentration
But there's kids in the back holding conversations
Crackin' on each other, and neither were poster boys
Both of 'em smell like the type that soap avoid
Coast enjoyed a leave of absence
One's fool's feet smelled like it struck some matchsticks
Brimstone, girls would never bring him home
I was laughin', then his friend raised his tone
And said, ""Bud, you earled all over yourself,"" yeah
I go so deep on your ass, you'll be submerged
Like you need to do in water 'cause you smell like a turd
Wanna cap? Get some courage, your feet smell lurid
Go look it up, and while you're at it, get a cup
And squeeze the sweat out your sweatshirt and drink it or gargle
You get our vote for most stinkiest
That nigga started thinkin' of shit, said I was frail
I said he was stale
Underarms is ripe
Undergarments tight, about to leap out your holey sweats
And we holdin' bets, and after this I'm gonna collect
Nigga check, yourself
Respect yourself
And wash your mothafuckin body 'fore your sweatshirt melt
Like radioactive, no lady find you attractive
The funk got you captive
You don't need a map, bitch

You gotta wash your ass, if you must
You gotta wash your hair, if you must
You gotta brush your teeth, if you must
Or else you'll be funky
*scratching* ""To wash up""
You gotta wash your ass, if you must
You gotta wash your hair, if you must
You gotta brush your teeth, if you must
Or else you'll be funky

Burnt,The Best of... (The Elektra Years): B-Boy Handbook,1993,"Mista, twista, getcha
Every single time and I rhyme like I know so I flow
With the gifted tongue and the cryptic brung
New phrases into the mazes
Play this
Two times a day with the day-o
Day-ay-ayo and the daylight come
I plum forgot what a wack rhyme was
Because I buzz like a bee in the ears of my peers
So they know, and I know, we all know, day-o
Daylight come and me wanna go home
Cool
No tool, no Smith and Wesson
Just an opposite so I can pop a bit of
Shit on the mic when I get on the mic
""B-b-b-bam!"" I ricochet a bit on the mic
And I like it, just like the girl on 
Ahonetwo
D-E-L will C-R-U-S-H anyone who
Makes advances when I'm incognito
Veto is the answer when I prance upon your skull like a Frito
Finito, but I ain't finished
'Til I let the flipside ride 'til the rhythm is diminished

I would if I could but I ain't 'cause I cain't
Time for me to lay down the law. Who's raw?
You saw the views from the shoes of the writer
Stronger than a Cisco, and you're like a cider; watery
Try to win the lottery before you try to slaughter me
Because I'm not the G
To be stepped to, kept you, on your toes
As my rep grew, I leapt through, negative foes
So you better get flows to counteract what we’ve done
Received one good 'cause I’m armed like a sleeve, son
Plead dumb and step back, as I wreck shop
Collect respect, props and deck the next prop, artist
The hardest is the one who don’t pass out
If Tyson’s last name was Rophone, I’d knock his ass out
The bigger the better, the better the bigger is
Whenever you figure this, nigga is, gettin’ his
Be real and don’t kill, with flaws the ill cause
Just answer to the boss
And that’s when ya lost
Keep on losin', I'm usin' many tactics
I yearn to earn more green than Saint Patrick
And I make backs if you get caught frontin'
Never bought a Newport but I puff a blunt'n

I needs no sugar crisp to get swift
So what with two syllables exemplifies the gift? Tajai
I sense those who try to scale my ladder
Bladders release upon your porch if you don’t cease
I respond with beats and will distraction
When I see one fatter than Rerun, so What’s Happening?
It’s not where you’re from, it’s just how you come
Correct, respect the roughneck 'cause 'nuff get
Bucked and tucked into their beds like “nighty, nighty""
Deft of the membrane, none left 'cause I am a righty
Fight these, you’ll catch volleys for your follies and mistakes
I stick fakes with shanks, so no thanks
Wack shit, your attempts to rap are ineffectual
I get in butt styles like a hard-up homosexual
Not for sex when you’re at the intersection, of damage
Sandwich knuckles are what your luck pulls
Bad ones, catch one or two, rather a few
A slew for soft ass phonies plus your cronies
Try me, you’ll catch my Vans in your hiney
That’s if my bat grip slips though I doubt it
Pout if you want to, covertly to find me
But I See’s more than them Candies, nothing gets by me
So play the tracks, 
and you’ll go out like Betamax
Next to Tajai 'cause I kicks the greater tracks

Sce-beep-boop
Bob your head to this, mischievous, soul societal
Idle chatter never slips off the lips of this writer
Might not be the greater innovator of the rhyme scheme
My style is the Visine to get your eyes opening
This Raggedy Andy gets dandy like a lion in the meadow
While the teapots blow off steam like a kettle
You're hip-to-the-hop I kick; I trip the light fantastic
Gettin' into the groove better than a phonographic
The vandal with the vocals making the locals go insane
The regal rhymer speaks sustenance for the brain
Get frisky with the phrases as you praise us like divinity
The one of liberated soul controls for infinity
Got style by the square mile, cats got a vibe child
Hieroglyphics will uplift the rhythms for the meanwhile
Articulate my lingo as I mingle in my medium of speech
And peace to prop prophets as I ponder and teach
A smidgen of religion to the fraudulent
Listen, pay attention, I’m the master of this convention
Kick the wicked-and-wiley-styley while you’re 
stuttering just like Smiley
Skipping shingles of your shattered dreams, too bad it seems you tried me
The wise and wordy wizard pays a visit to your subconscious
Crush your wonderland, extinguish all the nonsense
Optimistic, stylistic, mystic myth, I’m swift
Like Mercury, mercy me, I'll surely shoot the gift

People call me souped just because I'm living fat
People call me nasty: it's because I eat the cat
And I swing a bat to level heads, leavin' devils dead
Never said never ‘cause a clever head's better
Dreads locked on the top of my crop, never flaky
If this was a field then Bo Jackson couldn’t shake me
Bake me, Betty Crocker’s oven isn’t hot enough
If you wanna spread the skins then I got a lotta stuff
Not a bluff, got a tough guy thinkin' twice
Why step? 'Cause a fly rep, I kepts, my step ladder
I had a fatter spliff I was hittin’ on
Now it’s just a smidgen, like a pigeon, I’ll be shittin' on
Sittin' on a futon, slippin' my Timb boots on
I’m the type of brotha that ya have to get ya troops on
Oops, I'm sorry 'cause I didn't mean to diss you
I could hook a ho and make her blow like I was tissue
Mary had a little lamb, Adam got a lotta dough
Need help with your garden? Skyline got a lotta hoes
Yo, I didn't mean hoes, yo, I meant women
If she got the pool, I got the trunks; let's go swimming
Dip, dip, dive 'cause I'm live
Liver than five or ten of the men on my jock, you don't stop
Here a pimp, there a pimp, everywhere a pimp pimp

Press Rewind,Both Sides of the Brain,2000.0,"Check my comprehensive catalog of crafts
I'm daft
I battle all like I don't have it all
Avant-garde
Battlestar Galactica
Got rhymes per capita
I'm shining through the aperture
But I'm not gonna bust no caps for ya (nah)
That's another genre
I'm the black bomber
Track charmer
Sack burner
Distract burdens
If it ain't that urgent
Nerve prints
Word sentinel invisible infidel interstellar
Hella clever
Endeavors immeasurable
With only heaven to go incredible
Melodramatic wit tales from the tablet
You fail cause you average
Regardless of your sales and your status
You extra baggage
I bamboozle like I'm mobbin' in a Landcruiser
Down MacArthur
Artistic archer
Autistic misfit
You'll get the sickness
When I spit the wickedness
And split cha wig like Kid Icarus
Leave you headless like Ichabod
I infuriated, tick you off
Stick to Pop
Hip-Hop's too difficult
To me, it's a cult
Lyrics lacerated, slit cha throat
Beat cha brain down like Piscopo when sniffin' coke
I don't know, Diff'rent Strokes
So respect me 'fore I whip out ol' Betsy
Surgically remove you from my testes
Purposely improve you just to see who the best be
But sold up sexy
Take a poll and know the prestige
What?
Large lefty (Yeah)
I automate
Animate
My soul sanitation like I gotta canvas painting

Go ahead, try symbiosis
But most rap artist don't have any focus
Think they flippin' chips
Try penny brokers
Kipsco or pennyloafers
Get my album I'll show you how it's done
Del-atrocious
Hella atrocious wit vocals
My throat holds verbal choke holds
Poke holes in ya scrolls
My goals are not rifles
I flow scrimmage like the Micronauts
You might go pop and I might grow crops
Go get the gestapo
You riskin' a pot full of gold
Pull a zodiac sign to halftime
Reenact rhymes from a past life over flashlights
Man, you don't know the half
Dash right to the phonograph
Blow your balderdash
Coordinates confirm
Subordinates will learn
My ordinance is stern so supportin' my firm
Is the only way in this lonely age where you going crazed
Your style is sold and paid for cause I made more
Water emcees like on bay shore
Bullets graze doors (Where)
In Oakland where they lay law
Del is going AWOL with napalm
Eight bombs taped to my arms like the town crier
Now miser
Strider
Spit exciter
Ripping plywood
Forget beef cakin' lyrical cheapskates
Try Del and win the sweepstakes
What I make is so hot, it's seethin'
Off the deep end
Stop your breathin'
Caught cha sleeping
Now you're peaking like you've eaten
A hundred microdots wreck your equinox
Delete every piece of props
Leave your perforated
Curb your hatred
Deserve your matrix in the Word Olympics
Completely furnished wit burners like Ted Turner
I broadcast the classics
Fabu-lass, fa-tastic

Corner Story,Future Development,1997.0,"We 'bout to roll to the corner me and my crew
We 'bout to roll to the corner and get us some brew
We 'bout to roll to the corner and some swishers too
So we can roll a fat blunt and get perved
Another fine day in this land I live
Oakland where they don't give a shit and that's it
You know I'm sellin dank and split the profit 50/50
With this other brother who went in half with me
Now, first before we burst the move
We gotta sooth our nerves with the liquor
Then we don't bicker
We'll be relaxed ask your mama
This shit is like a war zone
Streets is hot like the Bahamas
But we will stay away from the drama
I'm wearin' my snipe, my arctic jacket with the wool like a llama
But then we had to pause like a comma
Cause someone got stuck and bucked and family was outside with trauma
We heard the shots from inside and whenever gats go off
I hit the deck and hide
And if po-po said they got there on time they lied
But you gotta give them credit they try
I see a mother cry and I'm wondering why
And my man said fuck it ain't nothin' we can do
But to continue our mission down the block for the brew
And we out (yeah, yeah)

On our way we 'bout half way there
Children runnin' everywhere like they just don't care
The Muslim Bakery is like right between
And if I pass by with beer they will look at me mean
So I ducks in and gets my Final Call now
Cause still my brain gotta be well endowed and proud
The ambulances signals and glances
So let's hurry up and don't take no chances
Niggas step to us trying to rap like we got all the answers
In front of the store trying to work that sleight of hand
The panhandlers, they not no amateurs
Daily reminders of how I gotta find a way to come up
It sums up life along with the kids and a wife
But anyway, we pass the local grocery store
And you can be sure the meats and the produce ain't good no more
Some of it is from days before
I want it fresh and the clerk ain't my race so he stress
They doin me in my community - fuck it, we there
Ain't enough for a 6 pack so we had to share
A nice little stroll through the April spring air
We hide our shit so the Nation don't see it there",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-corner-story-lyrics
Catch a Bad One,No Need for Alarm ,1993.0,"People havin memory loss, they don't remember I'm the boss
You're claustraphobic, when I close in
In on your men and your faculty, you wack'll be
Out my face, you must be basin if you think
That you could tackle the triumphant, I pump it, the volume
Increase as you mieces get sliced to pieces
Please listen to my album
Even if you're white like talcum and unpaid get'cha stayin
Tuned with my tune and I presume and see doom, designated
To anyone who stated
A word against me, I serve an MC, simply
Put like my foot up your anus, ya Shamus
Tryin to get over, I'mma go for mine
You know the time now that I'm older I'm gonna
Rip niggas heads with the said salutations
Introducing Del and his bid for boostin tales
Of my adventures, attempt to try
And you will limp or die, whichever I choose, you lose
Crews get ashamed cause we blame 'em for bitin
You might win, if you start writin, and stop fightin
No time for games
I rearrange my vocals in your heaphones
I hold 'til I get a answer
Acknowledge and abolish all the wack records
Hieroglyphics, you know, repected

Who caught the harm? You bought the farm
If you're a friend, there's no need for alarm

I get juiced when I let loose a little of my cleverness
Open up my follicles with no mousse
Choose your weapon, you kept steppin
You're swept in a hurricane, Del'll blow your brain
So your next generations of youth will be facin the truth
And the truth is I'll leave you with the loose tooth
Gums get split if you bit
I'll extract the truth out your ass like I'm standin in the pulpit
Or a lie detector wrecked ya sector, when you're standing
I can swing, branding, expanding, on what I'm handing
To the people, cause we will, and you can't say
A damn thing about it, if you doubt it
You're already outta line, so let me remind your behind
About the switch which I used to bruise your bottom
That little nigga tried to cut, I caught him
He didn't think that I would see that
So be that, and be off the D cause we rap
We sap the strength and lap the length around the whole course of time
And still got the time to unwind


Weak MC's make me earl
Hurl as your world is crushed because I gotta make you hush
You gotta be eliminated, the way I demonstrate it
You hate it, but still I am the greatest
Like a boxer, I'mma knock your socks off
Nowhere to run to, exits are blocked off
Steadily I'm dissin men, I hope you're listenin
Brothers like my flow
Others ride my jock like a bicycle, but I'm psycho
Fools try to play me like Tyco, gotsta pull the rifle
Daisy, graze the ass with the bee-bee
It comes speedy, sign the peace treaty
Or you'll be needin
Medical attention when I leave you bleedin
Throw a monkey wrench in your program
Crammed up your ass and it's just too bad, son
Catch a bad one

Who caught the harm? You bought the farm
If you're a friend, there's no need for alarm
Who caught the harm? You bought the farm
If you're a foe I'm gonna break your fuckin arm!

Proto Culture,Both Sides of the Brain,2000.0,"Let me tell you about the Proto Culture

We've had enough of the lackluster-trust us
We get the kind of games you can't rent at Blockbuster
KU: Game related, raise it bit by bit
Yo D, link up the cable we'll go hit for hit
Phantasma plasma particle beam means I have ya
On the run-the rendered effects hot like magnas

I play games by Capcom with a power glove strapped on
On any platform, I don't spend my dough on Phat Farm
Video games, I got many to play
Before my life expires; fufill my desires

Mastering your hardest boss
Shattering all stars across
Ain't hard to cross the finish line
Floatin' on Daytona
Wex, Gex or Klonoa, we get 'em all at cost
RPG, Platform we transform like Macross

Rival schools, Batsu
Purchase you ought to
It came with one free CD, it's like I bought two
I hope they make part II for Dreamcast
Cause games I've seen in mags, you won't believe they have!

Getting callouses turning over asteroids
Graviton bombs destroyed
Getting moms annoyed
Now I'm hacking Nightmare Creatures
Features splatter 'cross the screen
Get more clean each year

I remember my homie Ed Coats had the most
A Colecovision-every week I'd visit
Playing Donkey Kong Jr., Venture, Roc'n Rope
Games I thought was dope
While my moms was watching soaps

I'm on the next level
I got a double barrel shotgun in the Doom world
Waiting on the next devil
Armor's low-check the arsenal
Rupture the main conductor playin Disruptor

I remember Ninja Gaiden
Finish it finally
With Ramone wouldn't answer the phone
This was before getting blown
I own the first Nintendo Power
With the maps of Zelda Help me conquer in an hour

Hey KU you know my SEGA collection is massive
Got all the past hits and classics
Herzog Zwei now Panzer Zwei
Originality that made me a fan today

It's Pandemonium-it's like Toys R Us
Flippin the next Saturn game brings out the boys in us
It's poisonous
Taking out the boys in blue in Grand Theft Auto
Snatch a Rolls Royce to use

Yeah, I'll admit it Playstation improved
Come visit Feudal Japan with me and Tenchu
Bushido Blade 2 with sword play so accurate
Mega Man Legends but I had to buy a map for it

I'll fence Hyo to get a Neo-Geo
For Samurai 64 in full rendered splendor
Rival counter and enter my swords in his innards
My joint was playing Leonardo wuppin' on Splinter

I gotta get Xenogears-that's the type of game that relieves my fears
Get it from overseas to here
I gotta get Psychic Force
Authentic arcade that I can endorse
They got me liking imports

I'll need to be at the next E3
What's the next CD I need to see
Me and D signing checks
Let's float overseas, mingle with game companies
Giving tips to Capcom and Sega-can't front on these

To anyone who knew me better
Know I chose Saturn first Cause it's 2-D heaven
Bernie Stolar dropped the ball with the RAM cartridge
X-men Vs. Streetfighter could've expanded the market

Marvel Vs. Capcom-beyond fathom
Tell the truth, Playstation ain't ready to have 'em
Come on I'll bring the onslaught
Alpha and Omega
Khaos Unique brought to you by SEGA

Skull and Crossbones,Both Sides of the Brain,2000.0,"(scratched:)
I never drink and drive
'Coz I might spill my drink

Give me the keys, I'm OK
Quit tellin' me I'm drunk, I only had five Hurricanes
Quit bein' such a Puritan, I'm a mega turrican
Wakin' up and it's all a blur again
If I'm alive...
If I'm alive...
If I'm alive...
If I'm still alive...
Red Skull more like skull and crossbones
Took my driver's test straight pilin' over the cones
It ain't funny so don't you dare chuckle
Drivin' hella drunk without my beltbuckle
Fuck you, I'm OK
That's what they all say
Already got a suspended license
Smokin' weed in my ride and lightin' incense
Not knowin' it could be gone in an instant
Pistons pumpin', slumpin'
Over the steering wheel
So many drunk drivers on the road
It's killing fields
Who gives a fuck?
If I get caught all I get
Is a slap on the wrist
My license tooken is a bitch
But I still drive with a D.U.I
Crash, see my passenger fly
Through the windshield
It's hard to see you die
Heads crushed, necks severed from the shards
That's what happens playing with a wild card
How do you feel on trial for killin' your girl?
Nineteen years old, the end of the world
Don't know what to do
Pop's is gonna' kill you
Twelve gauge shotgun to your grill smooth
Got you in a predicament
If I'm drivin' drunk I've got a sickness
Some fool's is shiftless
Like me, gifted
Student GPA: four point oh
Blood alcohol level past that though
(scratched:)
I never drink and drive
'Cuz I might spill my drink

Three o'clock, time to go
One more line of coke with cognac
But my cognitive skills ain't on the shit
What now Sherlock?
Key to the lock
My friend's is tellin' me to stop
Damn near down the block
I found the cops in the bushes peekin'
Plus it's the weekend and I'm off the deep end
I roll through an alley way, can't see
Getting antsy I hop on the interstate but it's late
Cops patrol but I don't give a fuck though
I swerve to the right and get stuck in a mudhole
Check the rearview, the coast is clear
Tryin' to focus here but I can't
Drunk as hell, bust a rail
Now I'm sailin' off the cliff
High off the spliff, plus a fifth
I bust my shit
Now I'm rollin' down the side like a suicide
What will my family do if I die?
Tension builds, I went through hills and trees
Stopped by a redwood first thing broke was knees
I feel pain then a split second later
Car burst into flames, they won't know my name
They'll have to check my dental records
My body is charred
Burnt to a crisp soon as the car flipped the crash
That's my ass, a thing of the past
Already dead by the impact of airbags
(scratched:)
I never drink and drive
'Cuz I might spill my drink
If I'm alive...
If I'm alive, If I'm still alive...
If I'm alive...
If I'm alive, If I'm still alive...

BM’s,Both Sides of the Brain,2000.0,"Ahh
First day off probation, no wastin' time
Just like ancient times, and 
take a dime and roll it
Blaze it with no fear
After havin' to take piss tests for a whole year
Smokin' with a cold beer makes me kinda think
Why I don't like to drink heavily, cause what my P.O. was tellin' me
'You can't smoke and even eat poppy seeds
But you can buy liquor, and drink all you need'
It's callin' me, I used to drink Heineken's
Now it's 'bout 5 or 10, plus wine and gin
Hennessy, finishing the last drop
To the liquor store was a cash crop
Drive right past the grass spot
Doin' the dumbest shit I ever did in my life
Riskin' my life
Resistin' arrest
It's in my flesh
Probably smell funny
And there go Del's money
Fast forward to 1998
I smash more herb than those old day's
With a whole J to the face
Nah, I'm still feelin' gettin' drunk more than weed
But now we back in Amster-D, got some grams for me
Chocolate Thai and Purple Haze
And blocks of hash that make the J's last for days
Rollin' up so phat, circumference stuffed with major chronic
We can put a wager on it
When we first got out here in Europe it was everywhere
Even at the gas station, I was down in the mat
A fast pace, when I thought 'This shit ain't helpin' nothin'
When I can get elevated straight puffin' nothin''

(Scratching) Straight puffin' nothin'...
(Scratching) Straight puffin' nothin'...
(Scratching) Straight puffin' nothin'...
The smokin' sessions was the best in the world
Plus the price was right, affordable, so more to use
So fat they deserve the Kodak
And no tax so I'm savin'
Not misbehavin'
That's a risk we takin', we ain't talkin' bout that
We in the outback, smokin' till my mouth's black, how's that?
I never fucked up a show being blowed
I sorta didn't get it crunk
When I was drunk
Slow that liquor down boy, hit this BM, Bob Marley
A tribute
Cause it's probably as fat as it was he rolled
When he strolled
Down the same cobble stone streets
With his own beats
Another generation, a different time zone
With his mind blown, thinkin' up divine poems
Blessed by the father and it gets him farther
It's a father of spiritualities, since it all affects the Karma
I used the herb for good purposes
Some people are sure to diss, but up in Amsterdam they nurture it
And I can't forget about Crystania
This kid is brainia
Try to sell hard drugs there then they claimin' ya
Life, they only deal with real shit
All the bomb and hash you want to deal it
And all's well, they don't even sell it for much
And the cops don't really touch, cause it ain't slangin' dust
I'm writin' this, right now under the influence
But if you'd just torch those that say I shouldn't do this
Bob Marley'd out, at least 'til I'm back by the lake
But I might roll 1 or 2 for old times sake...

Dark Skin Girls,I Wish My Brother George Was Here ,1991.0,"As simple as it sounds, is as simple as it ought to be
Light skin girls lack the dark skin quality
Ya don't understand? You want an explanation?
Well let D-E-L release the frustration
As I see it, every single day
Light skin girls ain't satisfied unless they get their way, always
Plus they act stuck up
They all add up to one great big fuck up
They try to play suck up when they want somethin'
Then always leave a brother with nothin'
Ya think ya look better cause ya skin's a little bit lighter?
You're thinkin' you're my type like I was a typewriter?
No, ya think ya all of that and all of this
But you ain't really shit without a makeup kit
See, ya might be light but ya ugly to me
Black is beautiful, to me, that's beauty
×2
Dark skin girls are better than light skin
Light skin girls ain't better than dark skin
 I disagree homeboy

Now, lets get to the problems
And see if there's a way to solve them
Problem #1, has got to be the attitude
Which is usually vain, selfish and rude
Personality, with her nose stuck up
So don't try talkin' to her or walkin' with her
To class cause it's out of the question
Cause you bein' dark is the wrong complexion
For her. She wish she was light, though
I mean lighter than light, or as close to white as possible
But I fight to stay a brother
You see, green and dark skin sisters are the color
This don't apply to all the girls with light skin
Just the ones with their heads up their rear end
Cause if it did, static would occur
Dark skin cuties is what I prefer
Now, look at her, her vision is a blur
Cause contact lenses only let ya see Benzes
Plus she would fuss and cuss if I tried to talk to her
Cause I'm a man who rides the bus
I get frustrated, well, lets say I used to
Now a dark and lovely is who I give juice to
So come on, step to Del if ya with this
This is the facts, so brothers don't forget this
×2

I can't understand you light skin wenches
Ya think ya all that cause ya have long extensions?
Your hair was natural now ya got played out braids
You woulda looked better with a fade
Dark skin girls are so fly, so honest, so sweet
That's the type of girl I wanna meet
Complete, not phony or a fake like you are
See, Del is bolder, I tap you on the shoulder
And say, ""Hey lighty, could you tap that sister for me?""
But you love Mr. Loveable so you'll just ignore me
So find another tip that you can hop upon
To get with me ya need some sun and some Coppertone
You'll take a white boyfriend before a black one
That's why Del has to stand and attack one
Next time you see a girl darker than you
No disrespect when you met her, cause the girl looked better than you

El-P

Ayo, what' up, El-P?
Yo, what' up, Del-phonic?
Nothin', man; I was on the bus the other day, man
Tryin' to listen to my Walkman
This motherfucker all in my face
Tryin' to holla at me and shit
I'm like, ""Man, dude, you just a offspring.""

I'm very interplanetary and vary with various experiments
Gregarious with verbals for your merriment
What El-P tell me to use, the beat di-ffuse
You lose and get played like a MOOG
I'm rude revolting leave you molting
No thing - compares to my compadres
We'll take it to Broadway
It's beautiful the execution flawless
You all wet, soggy groggy when you saw me
But I never tire whenever I adjust my thrust
Females blush I bring the California gold rush
Your flow sucks, your stamina can't endure
I manicure your lavender amateur landed words
You haven't heard? Cannabis analyst
Add a twist to my manuscripts
I'l have you sent to the showers
Me and El-P, is superpowers like the US and USSR
Blow you like the Deathstar
Leave your chest scarred like Sagat
My plot proliferates, hits you like barbituates
In a twist of fate and splits your face
It's the great DelTron-Z
, 
soundbombing
Run to mommy, I'm airin out your dirty laundry
I'm shooting then executing you're aiming from mainstream
Your brain tingles, strangles your lame jingles
Bingo I bring flows that attack like wild dingoes
Can't be pigeonholed, anything goes gringo

Here we go - up jumps the outcast, sever the connection
My mostly overconfident acquaintances pull numbers
To the anti-potients and fear that I drip sick in
And rise out of my shell to teach sick or bedridden emcees
Til they fear living
Blockin the cocks that bust shots, spittin smitten bitches
Til the day of the locust,
 kitchen cutlery cuts
DMX 16 crossfade with a strange lust
Dr. Strangelove, born in the back of the train, fameless shame
Shared with acne pick brain pit
Tried to capture the moment of subtle death
Destro magnet spit - action fit into capsules
Slipped in the dirty waterway speaker cabinets
Maximum b-boy axiom stabbin shit
Intellectual women find that my rhyme style relaxes them
And wonder if I fuck to the same wildstyle pattern
It's autobahn pipe bomb glass fragment shatter
To break new jacks at after parties for actin actual
Factor X into your formula for fresh thoughts
With a Megalon wingspan that bulge from the back of the text radical
Radio time tracks flatten your flattery
The tradition excuse used by biters; ambiguously homo
Knotted tights and colored underwear
That's wrapped around the brittle legs of
Things without weapons - I'm grief diseased brethren
Swim in a sea of shit and malt liquor, feed on Excedrin
Radiate through tenements; emcees bleed estrogen!
Chorus: Del and El-P
Watch insanity increase
Break it up piece by piece
Never weak in the least
Think you better see a priest
(Mortality, don't battle me, it's costly
We the raw breed all of y'all is just the offspring)
 Yo Del gimme that shit again

Tomahawking your tom-tom club
You tried to holler at me at my show, lookin like you on drugs
You love the Del I'll thug you, bumpin Juvenile
Thinkin you in style, packin like you movin now
I move top speed, scott free with cock-D
Knock-kneed delivery that scorches you like Lockheed
Dr. Decibel, my deliverance is questionable
But as far as this session goes I'm wreckin skulls
Better check your pulse, we visionaries with this
Scarin the shit outta record labels next to fatal
Right beside homocide bonafied bewilderment
Militant diligence like I'm buildin pyramids
Peel your cap reveal your lack of flavor
Track your pager plus your celly
Piss on your Pele Pele, catch you comin out of belly
Dumbin out daily, tell me, what was your rationale
Think of matchin Del I disconect your PacTell
My mobile code words, showboat with no hope
For any rhyme you kick or any beat you load up
Leave you catatonic off a bag of chronic, skanless with anthems
Stomp your little cadence out at random

Ran-random, ran-random
El and Del-aphonic known to go off on a tantrum
Now you know..
For the backpackers, for the computer hackers
For the misplaced famous, for all the video gamers
For the derranged krylon stain makers
For the ungry hungry ass verbal brain rapists

Too expensive, it's too expensive
Too expensive, you know what?
Time is of the essence
Whacha say now? Whacha say, whacha say now?
You know what? Time is of the essence

My vast knowledge of rhyme is past college
Blast, demolish, polish off all enemies
I can't fall in this rap game, I got acrophobia
Plus half these rappers out here are fucking dead like necrophilia
You know the thing, chocolate like Ovaltine
Comin down on the mic like eggs from ovaries
Monarchal metaphor, malevolent with settlements
Maniacal when Hiero flow, unstoppable and chock full
Of funk. The freak, so fuck the foreplay
Del has been ordained to terrorize your brain
The diagnosis, the show biz is bogus
My lyrics lash out, like I was throwin stones in a glass house
Rappers pass out, ass out
And anyone left on the scene who has doubts
Y'all fools ain't got no nuts I'm doin donuts
Slow up whoever show up, I'm too robust
So what? I'm invincible invisible lyrics
Original origin unknown from here on in
Uncommon dominating hip hop
Permiating every portal with mortals
More flows Heaven scent, microphone etiquette
And lyrics up for your goblin and kill the novice
I write bad subjects like the Hobbit
And on to the next phase before you try to rob it
You know, D-E-L, yeah!

""Time is too expensive""
Too expensive, it's too expensive
Too expensive, you know what?
Time is of the essence
Whacha say now? Whacha say, whacha say now?
You know what? Time is of the essence

Supreme MC's reach out when I'm on top
Catch altitude sickness not to use fitness
In front of witnesses get with this fetch the funk
While I test the skunk, see I will caress the blunt
Come step through the flames of Hades or remain a lady
Rhymes infectious as rabies -- Deltron, hell on earth
Prevailing curtailing, you're shattered with data
Directed, my method, hectic, try and dissect it
Next shit, hydrauling we're calling you out
I rap with accuracy - I'm sick of fools actin
Like they blacker than me - y' know, usually bourgeoi'
We a new breed of MC remedy
For inner street jerks who wanna flirt with our sound
But ain't really down, silly clowns Barnum and Bailey rejects
Press eject on defects (yeah)
These threats delivered signed and sealed by the Delmeister
German for master, burnin the blasphemous
Whatever you ask of us gets fullfilled
Non-linear, you couldn't find a flow friendlier
Or even similar with beats that knock
Those who cock block transport 'em to the chop shop
Operation X cause we often facin death
And fake ass players are lost and wastin breath

""Time is too expensive""
Too expensive, it's too expensive
Too expensive, you know what?
Time is of the essence
Whacha say now? Whacha say, whacha say now?
You know what? Time is of the essence

Lyrical master, turnin mic sessions to disaster areas
I'll wax your derriere
Disable MC's with fatal degrees and flows
Flamboyant flamin fools like mesquite, let's eat
These barbeques are for you
We are the few the proud the Hieroglyphics
Microphone moguls with code words and hand signals
For negros, spanish for black
I'll vanish your raps, at the borderline
Where you can order rhymes
Never monochromatic, y'all know the habits of Del
Talented, creating lyrical Gallaghers
Highest caliber, hip hop puritan
Throw my voice like shuriken, or ventriloquists
Until it sit in your cerebrum, I need them
Through the medium of music, too sick
The ratio is glaciar, Gigantor
My flow is lighter fluid, you'll need a higher druid
Magicians and Mages, to curb my primal rages
My styles all over the place, disease contagious
And treacherous (what?) like Mussolini (uh-huh)
But cooler than Fonzarelli eating fusilli
With roots in hip-hop goin back to Whodini
Who see me, no eyes, your style is corny like bow ties
No fries, keep that shake for a keep sake
As well as patened Del hysteria
Malaria area, 88 bait for bitin MC's
They're bitin to see, see that's like a likin disease
My time is up, I take my mic and I leave",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-time-is-too-expensive-lyrics
What Is a Booty?,I Wish My Brother George Was Here ,1991.0,"What is a booty and how will I know if I’m shaking it?
What is the funk and how will I know if I’m faking it?
Cause it don’t tick it don’t mean it don’t tock
The hands don’t stop when the cuckoo leave the clock
There’s nothing harder to stop than that who’s time has come to pass
Del the Funky Homosapien says
On behalf of my behind I feel it is my duty to my booty
That I come in ahead of the class when it comes to butts
Old mother hubbard went to the cupboard to give the poor dog a bone
But when she bent over, Rover drove her, the dog had a bone of his own
He did the loose booty
Del the Funky Homosapien, yeah he’s nasty, he's nasty

I've returned from the meadow with a fellow named X
Two turntables and a spark upon his set
Wet behind the ears from the tears of my peers
Rap is outta control that's what we fear
So we collapse any actual threats
With the new batch of catchy little quirks
And it works like a charm as I bomb and alarm any listeners
Coming through crisper on your transistors
So we can eliminate the frauds
Filled with pride as the audience applauds
Might sound odd to the average Joe Shmoe
The new school passed ya ass like Flo Jo, dodo
Me and CM-PX both construct
Like Kid Creole and the Coconuts
As we drop the bomb with a blast
And now all the natives ask...
What is a booty and how do I know if I'm shaking it?
What is the funk and how will I know if I’m faking it?
Booty do your duty
Somebody say 
a tail is nothing but a long booty
Funk’em just to see the look on they face
Funk’em, just to see the look on they face
Motherfunk’em, just to see the look on they face
Funk’em, just to see the look on they face
Motherfunk’em, just to see the look on they face
Funk’em, just to see the look on they face
Motherfunk’em, just to see the look on they face
Funk’em, just to see the look on they face
Motherfunk’em, just to see the look on they face
Funk’em, just to see the look on they face
Motherfunk’em, just to see the look on they face
Funk’em, just to see the look on they face

You were shoplifting

Emcees be past tense
Didn't make the draft pick
Come get ya ass kicked
You awful
And slothful

Hit cha with shit that's uncalled-for
Leave ya jaw broke
Tryna simulate

You rhyme purely functional
Merely fills the gap

Bring forth a rhyme like childbirth

Tearin' out the whereabouts of lyrics
Somethin' you don't care about
I eviscerate your mental state
Into strips of steak
I'mma situate barbituates to get you baked
Your effeminate image is far from intimidating
Cause my style you're imitating
That's as sin as Satan
Your corny insubordinate rhymes are like a porno flick
Compared to Edgar Allan, you spread your talent thin
You gotta problem with balancing
Ya equilibrium is givin' up
Ya symmetry is imagery
Your videos are pretty dull
Big budget
But my poetry you covet
Mega-destructive
You can't fuck with

This artform is truly endangered
So I change it, never doing the same shit
I'll make a profit off of oxygen
Phenomenon wit no homonyms
Hit 'em wit a sonic boom
Eradicate ya nom de plume
Procure of insert a word wit hypodermic earnest
And leave ya burnin' like a furnace

Liftin' crime rates
Shiftin' earth plates

Grils was yucky
Clear 'round & get slapped like a puck-y

In class, and give a spank
A banka full of fun
At recess, and be fresh.'
OK, I'll try it
And die if she does
But she did
And turned around and socked me like Rocky
I feel like a heel for real
But now I'm older
And told ya to keel over
Cause now it's different
No innocence
And women sprints the way
You sway to the forces of evil
And we will bust that ass fast and quickly

Try and rob another
And I'll rub ya the wrong way

Mack you & attack you

Freakin' & kissin'

Lets turn the sands in the hourglass
And your power lasts less & guess
& take a gander
I slander ya name & spread propaganda
And I demand ya ta stop
Hop on a train before pain'll
Be ya middle name
In the game of love & happiness
Yes, I caressed ya flesh
But if you test
Ya caught out there without a vest
Mess around and you can rest
I found a new boo boo
Baby, maybe I can crave the
One that saves thee
Reputation, ya'll lets face it

The Wacky World of Rapid Transit,I Wish My Brother George Was Here ,1991.0,"Fresh from the meadow with a mellow attitude
I was plannin' to pursue another quest for the bus
I had to go to San Fran, it's something that I can't stand
It's beggin' for a ride with ma dukes makes a fuss
I don't like fussin' so I ask 
my older cousin
Could he maybe find time to give the D-E-L a lift
He said it is impossible because he has a roster full of plans for the day
I had to go and sift through pennies in my jeans
To many it may seem that the public transportation really isn't keen
And I agree with the theory
Because it's 3:30 and the bus was due at 2:35
I iron my 
Girbauds
 so I can wait with pride
I waited at the bus stop feeling kinda high
From a spliff that I smoked, I riffed and provoked
A little scene when the bus arrived late like a joke
With a corny punchline, and it was only lunchtime
The bus should've been here, the driver had much time
To get is act together, no matter what the weather
Now I'm sittin' at the bus stop waitin' like forever

When oh when is the bus gonna come
I'm getting sick and tired of the wait
When oh when is the bus gonna come
Well here comes a pack of about 4 teens
Lookin' real mean with hoodies and jeans
And bad attitudes and I wasn't in the mood
For no head on collision with the hoods
Try to use my transfer but it's no good
Would these rough lookin' kids get busy with the youngsta
Amongst the many who must catch rapid transit to get through the city
I'm not certain
But if I go sit in the back it's curtains
Kids wanna ride the back, what kinda shit is that?
Nowadays niggas can't wait to hit the back
Let me stand in the front with the elderly
So those other cats won't raise hell with me

Oh golly gee, not another day on the 46A
I should've caught the 46B
Cause dukes takes the mass scene and group through the trees
And shoots the breeze with the ladies
Look at that around the way girl. Yeah, I see her
More crack than a drug dealer
A kid sits by me with a gang of afro sheen on
I'm not Joe Clark and I would hate for him to lean on
My shoulder and try to hold a conversation
Cause I don't have the patience
When oh when is the bus gonna reach its destination
Question over space and time, wastin' time
Word up, I can't take this line of nitwits
I'm about to have a fit quick
Cause this trip here is making me car sick
Check out the brother with the loaded .38
Braggin' to his buddies about the money that he makes
Sellin' crack viles like pancakes
To baseheads just like the one
That's sittin by the window starvin' for a fix
He spent his last 80 cents on fare
He raises up and lets me get in his chair
Then I sit and take a snooze
But I still lose
Cause I cruise right past my stop
Had to get off and walk 15 blocks",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-the-wacky-world-of-rapid-transit-lyrics

Sounds like you're sharing flows with Treach
Let's come to grips youse a drip
Arrogant son of a bitch, none of us is rich
This is my stitch in time, enrichin' minds
And twistin' backs witcha simplistic raps
I let a little bit of my lyrics leak and lather
At my mouth like a mad dog
And seek and gather your neck and bite
I just dissect the mic
And correct the tykes so don't be sassy
You won't be lasting, chastising that's why things
Swing in my favor - watch your behavior!

I cannot stand a WACK M.C

In fact, you are wack and far beyond dope, be gone—NOPE!
You gets no respect, I pose a threat
'Cause you're wack and weak, in fact you tried to freak
""Groove Me"", it was used before
You need to choose a more appealing sample
I seal and stamp fools like mail, you're quite stale
You might fail and I know you're paranoid
Beware, avoid Funky Homosapien
Monkeys I will make of men
Take 'em into custody your style is rus-ty!
Plus we, hate R&B, 'cause that shit is sorry
That shit's for saps, just admit your raps
Don't cut the mustard, don't get flustered
'Cause ya, skill is null and void
And your skull is void, empty
Senseless, defenseless, I rinse this
Plague away with typhoons and you die soon
Why swoon when you hear a ballad, is what I tell a broad
'Cause L a fraud, he ain't hella hard
I used to look up, now I wanna cook up
Your brain like bass and maintain ya space

Get off me, I'm not your softie
But you will cough for your breath and phlegm, death to them
And silly broads, I fuck 'em and I chuck 'em (why?)
In the river, without a liver
And I donate to science, cause I'm a giver
The mysterious clearly busts brains with my brawn
Ask Sean, Cassidy about how I trash MC's

Wrong Place,No Need for Alarm ,1993.0,"I writes rhymes for rehearsal
But first, chill, I gotta little story to tell ya
How I almost caught a... bad one
Add one to the list of 2,001 stupid things to do
I had crew when they stepped at a party
Hardly even known I own a Smith & Wesson but it's restin' at home
In a shoe box, they see crews jock
So they wanna step and take the rep I got
I said, ""Wait a second"", check inside my coat for a shank
They must be imaginin' that I'm money in the bank
They'll get spanked
'Cause I'm not the nigga
I got bigger brothers waiting in the bushes to mush kids
I talk when I wanna talk, never silence
Violence erupts when I clown ya, catch a beat down ya
'Cause I never back away from niggas
Even if you gotta pistol, I dare ya pull the trigger
But that's suicide, either you must die or I must so why bust me
'Cause I'm guilty of being in the wrong place at the wrong time
Comin' at ya in the wrong state of mind
I'm, out in a hurry, a pow and a flurry
Of bullets come speedin' by, I needn't die
I gotta make tracks and take back my words
I eat 'em 'cause everybody knows I didn't beat 'em...

At people cause they tend to get offended
And then the heat will
Be on my ass I got class
Never out of line, 'cause
I'm standing here without a nine
Pistols I wish will not blast me
Task be, circlin' corners lookin' for Warners
You know, the Brothers, me and you
We didn't do shit but we get hassled because we crew
And we rollin'
This is my car, it isn't stolen
I hope you catch a slug, straight in your colon
When ya walkin' the beat
I bet ya gotta sheet hangin' up in ya closet
Fuck this law shit
But there's two laws to follow, you know
There is the laws of the city and the laws of the ghetto
I go to clubs with a smile on my face
Just in case niggas look and wanna wild in the place
'Cause of jealousy, well, it's me, only me
Niggas walkin' in poppin' shit, that's who the phonies be
Peep it one night and you'll see it it's quite clear
Since we all know now that's why we're
Never in the wrong place at the wrong time!

Damn, I hate cops!
I need to bust they chops
Always gettin' props for the niggas they pop
Peep, I smoke weed get weeded
'Cause I need it to calm my nerves before a pig get bleeded
I got busted for less than a gram of hash
They wanna cram my ass in the slammer
Punk po-po
Bringin' back hash from Amsterdam is a no-no
I didn't know they would catch me
Punk mutt fetch me
Stretched me out at Customs, gotta bust 'em
I can't call it
They found it in my wallet
Now Customs got me and I just can't stall it
I wish they would leave me alone
Dog lookin' at me like 'feed me a bone'
He might bite me, very likely
They had to strike me with a fine or time
I said “Fine!”
Mines was 500 bones
For a gram of hash, my mind was blown
Come back to Michigan, so we can bitch again
Federal offense, now I better go and convince the judge...

And she wanna know can you solve it...

Mistadobalina is a jack-ass, much like a donkey
And 
I'mma pin the tale on the funky
Has anybody seen Del's head swell?
Cause I get paid well, kickin' much tail
Drink me a forty as I ride my rhinoceros
You don't like it? Well you gots to kiss
Where the sun don't shine, something like my behind
I lose a fan but I'mma be fine
Dr. Feelgood, didn't think I still could
Make funk real good
Take it then I looped it
Make you say - 
Gloryhallastoopid
The Motorbooty make you shake your rump
To the brand new D-Funk
Take a chunk cause I'm much like a hunk
To the dark skinned girls with funk in they trunk
Coming from around the way
It's Del better known as Dr. Bombay

Dr. Bombay
He don't stop and he don't play
Every time I try to catch him he's always running away
(sing it, sing it, sing it)
Dr. Bombay
Could you find time and could you stay
Cause the funk is guaranteed to make my day
(It's, so, funky)

Large as a black woman's gluteus maximus
And the question everybody's asking us
""Where'd you get your funk from?""
A brother named George and some 151's
So Let's Take It To the Stage you suckers
I jam, and Mistadobalina eats Smuckers
Back in the house with the crew Hieroglyphics
Now you know everything is terrific
Funk in the 1990's that's ironic
So grab you a sack of that chronic
Down with Da Lench Mob
 straight from the ghetto
But I'm under the sun in the meadow
Me and this Amazon sittin' on my lap
Butt so big when she walk it clap
Doin' the hoochie coochie in the forest
Y'all know who I am so girls sing the chorus

He don't stop and he don't play
Every time I try to catch him he's always running away

Watch your wife, cause if your spouse calls
Del's gonna damn sure make a house call (hello?)
You peeped out my drawers on your fence
I'm a dog, so you might see paw prints (woof)
(Whattup Doc?) Wait, it ain't cool to jock
Cause you're real far from a ballerina
So ohhh ohhh, Mistadobalina
Freeze, and get up off your knees
Everything that Dr. Bombay say
Is guaranteed to make your day
So ""oops"" upside your head
I like Club Med hangin' out with the dreads
And girl if you ain't got a germ
I won't hesitate to pull out my Funky Worm
But if you ain't down with Delvon
Cancel your appointment and please get the hell on (see-ya)
Cause I won't have fraudulent foes
Under my nose, if you won't eighty-six the clothes
Get out the way, so I can save the day
Cause I'm Dr. Bombay

He don't stop and he don't play
Every time I try to catch him he's always running away

It's D-E-L tha Funkee Homosapien to the rescue
I'm solo and threw 
a bolo and left two
Dancers back on 
Soul Train
And ya know Soul Train get the phat doodie stain
Now what ya gonna do with the board with no talent
Using step 1 and step 2 to keep the show valid
Let's have a vote and try to register our ballots
And realize a Hammer's just a mallet
Toss him like a salad cause he ain't truly gifted
Now the party's lifted by the crew Hieroglyphics
Golly-wolly, not another 
Elvis and Priscilla
Ice is cool, but I can't stand Vanilla
Because he takes a style and tries to mock it
Ain't nothin' personal, G, but I'm kinda into chocolate
It's all about the black, and it's like that
And I'm so laid back cause I smoked a phat sack
Plus I'm almost through & done 
with a whole 40-dog of Olde English 800
Now I peep ya concept
Ya think ya got a rep?
Dance all day, while I'm pissin' on your steps


No Del is not a mean fellow
Just because I wanna turn your dance shoes yellow
See I'm rather mellow, some call it lazy
Me and myself and I ain't with the daisies
Cause I'm no goddamn flower
And every single dancer in circumference receives a golden shower
I'm here to insult
The Hip hop John Travolta
Ya think ya all that but really you're shorter than a midget
I don't fidget
With the ballet
 Fuck a dancer  Because that's what my pals say
And brothers don't shake ya rumps
Wearin' biker shorts is like chokin' on ya nuts
Because ya might end up with a cramp or a hernia
And that's much worse, than a fine girl burnin' ya
Plus it ain't fly for you to have your behind
Blasted all out like a feline
See I'm givin' you advice, make ya think twice
Cause dance groups don't last past Minute Rice
So change ya concept
Acquire some skills on the mic while I'm pissin' on your steps

Money for Sex,I Wish My Brother George Was Here ,1991.0,"Let the buyer beware
And prepare for the scare of 1991, yo
Brothers get dumb without no remorse, yo
Gas they hand and then they thrown off course, yo
I coulda told ya so, I'm no dummy
Girls out there will act funny for the money
If ya rollin' in dough, she'll treasure ya
Instead of a pager she carries a cash register
It's cool for the fool who just happens
To be a crack dealer or rappin'
Back in the day it wasn't no problem
Cause it was okay, to just have a job then
But, nowadays ya gotta have the status
But, natives ain't goin' for the madness
Hey, they're barely outta their teens
16 and 17 year olds livin' like queens
Cause, honey trips without the checks
And ayo, money trips without the sex
So next is somethin' that natives don't need
Headaches and heartaches and I refuse to partake
In money for sex in any form or fashion
All ya hopes and dreams I'm like smashin'
And I know otha brothas know how I feel
So you can step cause (it ain't no big deal)

""Money for sex, money for sex, ring it up...""

Where, oh where did the good girls go?
It seems all that's left in the meadow is hoes
Not the kinda ho that you use in your garden
Yes the kinda ho that'll make your dick harden
But it's more than a dolla for a holla
And more than a thousand for a peak up her blouse, and
More than a million if ya have children
Cause nowadays girls wanna make like a killin'
So babies come in handy
And they'll just eat up your dough like candy, give her some Brandy
And let her roll around in the Benz
And she'll give up the crotch and brag to all her friends
Thinkin' they can play me like a field trip
That's why I slugged my honey dip
Cause that's more than I can stand and I'm the man who sets it right again
Bust they in the lip and the bitch will never bite again
You ain't gettin' with my Nubian brothers
Cause before you even hit them covers
I warned 'em
Told 'em what was up before you bitches even swarmed him
Cause they'll be next
If I didn't hip my brothers to the sex
So you can try to rob and steal
But we were right on ya heels because (it ain't no big deal)


You say crack sellers are swell fellas
Takin' you to school in his 5.0
Like I don't know that your boyfriend is paid
Ya musta told me 18 times, the other day
Bamboo earrings and gold teeth
And I know you must be givin' up the whole piece
He's just payin' for the sex
And I know you prostitutes is playin' with the sex
So who's next? Don't think that you can play the Homosapien
Cause I got plenty of friends
That's like waiting in the trenches
And I know your intentions
You wanna be down with a rapper
So you clap your
Thighs around my legs like a sandwich, but I'm not famished
Your schemes and plots are outlandish
Tan is the color of my skin, but
False is the color of your grin
So you can't win. This ain't no joke
And honey dip you can quote
Note for note
And squeal like a billygoat
And tell your friends that Del is stuck up
But in reality you fucked up
Now nubians ain't givin' money for the sex
And ayo, Nubians ain't givin' money for the sex
You stuck out in the cold
Like a mole on my asshole
Cause brothers ain't givin' up another red cent for the sex
Now, don't you look foolish?
Ya gold diggin' ass looks ghoulish
Pale as a ghost cause ya post high like a man is a big wheel

From the man whose mind is not even in this dimension

Heed, my flow's symphonic, hypnotic, psychotic
Never semiotic but doper than narcotics
A few a y'all caught it on my first release
But now my power's increased, enhanced
Del meets the fans halfway, and slap a rapper in his chops
The temperature drops, you get pneumonia
Or maybe exposed to radiation by plutonium
Some say rap's an idiom, get the A-S-R-S-P
And then a medium, the best of both worlds
Brilliantly engineered, lyrics dement your fear
Del is now in the clear, I was in prison
But now free to be everything that I envision
Abandon the plan and the uninspired
And the haters that cater to their needs agree
It's bizarre, by far anarchy no control
No soul, the whole fucking planet's gonna fold
Unless we administer, since, as we enter the
Twenty-first century even your worst enemy
Gotta get it together, mentally and systematically
When niggas think I'm a smart-ass, it makes em mad at me
Why, cause I try my best to eliminate ignorance
Not letting my brain burn out like cigarettes
There's bigger threats besides thieves or your pet peeves
But what's right in your face is what nobody believes

Del, what you got up your sleeve?
If it was up to me
I would pass the baton cause it's tough to lead
But still I drop facts here and there so I can up the seed

I myself depend on skills and my energy
It's maddening, at every single gathering
Of young black youth it's got to be some niggas badgering
Averaging out to be bout three out a G
How motherfuckers build stereotypes, cause it's all they see
I take glee in the fact that I'm me
Not a follower, a dollar wouldn't make me sell my soul
Del is old-school compared to your subterfuge
I got the same code of ethics Jungle Brothers use
Now every nigga wanna be crime related
Can't rhyme creative and they're made of self-hatred
That's why they overstep boundaries that's sacred
From the street to the corporate scene they all mean business
Self for self, phony doesn't work
Your soul holds no weight when you let the devil lurk
Fighting evildoers I been evil myself
But I'm still a black man with experience, under my belt
I may be young, but my soul is old
Living in the ice ages where a nigga's soul is cold
Don't give a fuck about your life or his
But if you get a gat for protection, who lives?
Comin up ain't the same as pullin everybody else down
But try telling that to niggers that are spellbound
They'll probably say that you talk too much
They gotta think too much
So just be careful who you trust

Listen, I can twist men into pretzels, my jet skills can outrun
'Cause it's fun, I'm not done
One or even two could even try, It's not a even try
I'll leave 'em cleavin', why did you do it?
I'mma school kids and tease 'em and please 'em
For the treason, that's the reason I'mma squeeze 'em
Make 'em tell and make 'em dwell, they're not dead
I got lead, but I won't use it, I'll refuse it 'cause they're losin'
I'll be merciful, I won't hurt the skull, with the hollow tip
I'll make sure they follow tips, that I tell 'em
I won't spell 'em, out
, they'll shout, in horror
'Cause they saw a metamorphis, I'mma force kids out the galaxy
So, now ask me, don't try to go around because I know the sound
They're not stealthy, I'm dope, the opposers
I make sure you chose the straight and narrow
Prepare though, and be careful

Of trash 'cause it doesn't smash or last, they got cash, but now
How are you gonna survive because you strive to gamble?
You're in shambles and I'm glad I could add flavor
I'm the savior, misbehavior can catch hell, none can match Del
Unless they stress, fresh, I'm nonetheless and take a guess
The one that make 'em go run back and tell they crew
That Del is true, he tell a new way to say whatever's clever
I'm gonna sever necks of those who don't respect the rap legacy
Because I egg MC's on the late night
They got away writin' clever raps
'Cause with that bullshit it sounds like they never rapped
In they life, I got a knife that is lyrical
And Del is causin' fear and still has potential (potential)
They didn't learn, now the money's gonna burn

The Me and Ple is down to do battle
Cause when the sun shines they gots to follow (they gots to follow)

A knows much about the undeceivable shadow
The enemies laughing at you while you acting like an asshole
Extreme darkness makes my people seem heartless
They got me more frustrated then a fiend spark less
You see the enemy is a scheme artist
Right now they be the smartest
Cause your only concern is if you seem the hardest
But you seem retarded, the black man is in panic
You got people saying that God, but acting Satanic
I know god knows
You think you are because you got hoes
Your brainwashed watching to many talk shows
I bet you got flows
But it results in evil
When the only way to be equal or come up is insulting people
The shadow got us realding we think we building
To busy talking shit, or fucking hoes to raise our children
You’ll be amazed when the curtain raises (yeah)
It’ll make you give praises, or say this “who gone save us?”
I’ll remain patient, meditating while they got you waiting
Go to a camp of concentration, I ain’t faking
Man we like the brand new Jews
But the new Hitler’s too big for you to get in your view
For twenty two years, I done battled with the shadow
When my people act so shady, but I’ll still got you back bro
____because you black bro
And if you ever let that go
I'mma see at the rouge upon the plateau


I waltzing down the block wit my nigga A-Plus
You know what's up, soaking up rays and vapors
All the sudden it seems like the beams was shrouded by a eclipse
But this happens frequent, some niggas was rolling secretive
They wanted to beat the living shit out of us
If we wasn't talking bout giving it up
Like applause down to the drawls
They said they’d sit by the shadow we better not tattle
____? the sky got brighter
My eye got tighter me and Ple started talking bout
Why we got bitters, fronters, and other antagonist
And whenever we speak they treat us like we were evangelist
No, we’re merely analysts, observing whats occurring like
Who’s doing the serving, keeping our people from flourishing
We mourn about nourishing, who’s deserving teaching courage
Cause the earth's being engulfed and what they teaching is murders
Homicide ___ on HBO’s the ratio
Its so unbalanced
And we know this was established back in the
I always learned to beware of sinners
And those that praise pestilence
Even if it’s your next of kin

I take it on my journeys to the mystic place
So I can dis the facial value of your ballyhoo
See, my style is rather passive but I can get aggressive
Brothers get done when they try to be impressive
Cause I do not impress easily, D-E-L is eager to be
The founder of the fragrance and watch the vagrants
Scatter like rats in the sewer as we do 'em like two secret agents

In the region of the forest where the march hare dwells
I sit and write scriptures by the old wishing well
Collect all my notes and sail a boat back to Berkeley
Tribes feel my vibe cause my style is rather earthly
Some say it's whack but I ain't trying to hear it
As long as what I do contains my soul and my spirit
It's cool, I use this as a rule of thumb
I take a dip into the pool of radiance until the fool was done
Slidin' on the floor like a fat ignoramus
Ya sold 8 million but ya still don't entertain us
Cause you're fraudulent, I have no time for a jester
Go take your place beside Uncle Fester
Cause you are an uncle too, you are an Uncle Tom
And D-E-L and Hieroglyphics gonna drop the bomb

Yeah...under the sun, under the sun, under the sun
We gonna take it light
Yeah...under the sun, under the sun, under the sun
We gonna take it light
Yeah...under the sun, under the sun, under the sun
Yeah

D-E-L, the 18 year old dwella of the meadow
It sure in the hell beats living in the ghetto
Things are peaceful and everything's settle
With a good night's snooze on a bed of rose petals
I wake up in the morning feeling happy and refreshed
Before I make my journeys I must eat and get dressed
A pair of blue jeans and a shirt with greenish hues
Greener than the grass that was caught between my shoes
When I trample through the forest with my brother 
CM-PX
The kinky haired nubian there with a human
My hair gets notty without the proper grooming
The whole metamorphosis resembles flowers blooming
In the shadows, deep within the trenches of the sea
Free as Leah, a head of hair like a tree
Cause I'm a love child, follow me now children
Cause I'm a love child, I love to see the children smile at my antics
Foes get frantic and nervous and panic
Even as I venture past the planet called Earth
Born from the womb of the nebula
Deeper in the meadow where my actions are irregula'
I bug out and tell my maid to take the rug out
And dust it, and proceed to throw the thugs out of the pasture
As I recline on a hippo
Write the funky speech and watch my profits seem to triple and quadruple
Teaching all the pupils proper scruples in the meadow

Yeah...under the sun, under the sun, under the sun
We gonna take it light
Yeah...under the sun, under the sun, under the sun
We gonna take it light
Yeah...under the sun, under the sun, under the sun
We gonna take it light
Yeah...under the sun, under the sun, under the sun
Yeah

How ya doin'?
How ya livin'?, in the meadow, in the meadow
How ya livin'?
How ya feelin'?
How ya doin'?
Hey...ah yeah",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-sunny-meadowz-lyrics
Stay On Your Toes,Both Sides of the Brain,2000.0,"Check it out
It's a revolution in your head I'm boosting
Like I read the future
My execution
Used as a stimulant to get you into it
Show you my sentiments
Mental leasing the flicks
Don't hate, felicitate
Whenever you get the break
It's always a risk you take
Doing a different take
Big mistake rappers make
The cake they want it now
So they copy who's the hottest now they sounding funny style
I know you're hungry pal, me too
I need food
But I don't redo what he do
I'm lethal
Like jimson root
Go ahead, attempt to shoot
Invincible
It's flawless like a dentist's tooth
Oblivious to all this ignorance
They need to get a grip
Don't be an idiot
In a high state, I transmigrate
To a fly take
Make you wanna get your life straight
I'mma introduce the places that I ventured to
I get cha proof of a hip-hop institute
It's the truth
I'm just being hospitable
Sittin' bull
The chief I seek the hidden jewels
Some just complain about the status of rap
They say it's average in fact
They wish the eighties was back
I say everything's everything
Nothing stays the same
And yet, it is the same, just given a different name
Money's all that matter to you? You sniffing 'caine
You need to uplift your brain, forget the fame
You say you get power, if you get money
How you get those if you just a dummy?

Just stay on your toes man
In this world that's just how it goes man
In Oakland, gotta get with the program
With flows I wanna control the whole land
You just gotta stay on your toes man
In this world that's just how it goes man
In Oakland, gotta get with the program
With flows I wanna control the whole land
And keep growin'

Nowadays I hear the same crap
Complain ""rap is trendy"" not to give anybody with a name dap
When did that start?
It sound childish
You went to college but I think you need some extra mileage
Underground cats disrespect who they don't listen to
If you looked at my CD rack you'd probably diss me to
That's so weak
Don't speak when a niggarole creep
Or I'm finna go deep
I heard a MC in a cipher straight lying
Damn near crying, talking 'bout ""real Hip-Hop's dying""
That's some dumb shit!
That's what I was thinking (Uh-huh)
But I didn't say nothing to him cause I knew that I been drinking
He must be blind as hell
Hip-Hop is alive and well
He ain't got the mind to tell
I rhyme with Del
Drink Guiness combined with Ale
Never been inclined to fail, applyin' the skill
I be tryin' to build with the close-minded
But they so blinded I get upset and they get clothes-lined
Don't hate on nobody
Stay on your toes
Even if he got platinum or gold on him
Stay on your toes
Underground to Commercial cat
Stay on your toes
I know them or I ain't heard of that
Stay on your toes
From backpacks and licorice sticks
To black macs with ammunition and clips
Man I can get with this shit
Yeah, it's all the same
Some of y'all call it game
Say it's either for the props or the fame and all the change

Why Ya Wanna Get Funkee Wit Me?,Future Development,1997,"A new day was dawning
Yes one more morning
Just stretching and yawning
Picked up my belongings
And call my crew
See what we all can do
Let's go to the mall
The one with the waterfall
And take your father's car
Although it ain't that far
They got a whole bazaar
Of fly girls up the par
Yeah sounds like a plan
I need a new Walkman
We pass the popcorn stand
And see what we can land
In the land no less
I spot a cutie with Guess
And I had on sweats
She looked unimpressed
I said ""Damn you fine""
But nothing 'bout her behind
I said ""Do you have the time, to sit back and chitchat?""
She said ""No
You look like a hobo
And with that camouflage shit looking like G I Joe""
I said ""I'm not that broke
And I can buy you a Coke""
She said ""This must be a joke""
I swear it hurt till she soaked, and shook me off
Like a moth
I said ""What's the deal with the clothing as long as it's cloth?""

Why you wanna get funky wit me?
Slow ya roll a little
Damn you crazy
Girl, why you wanna get funky wit me?
Slow ya roll a little
Damn you crazy
Girl, why you wanna get funky wit me?
Slow ya roll a little

Ok she too stuck up
I didn't catch so what?
My partners busting their gut
Getting me straight stuck, on anger
Let her go
Why sweat her so?
Oh fuck you guys
Let's fuck with some fries
At Quick Stop
Where the chicks pop, up
Let's pop at them
Nigga like a magnum
Next destination
Stop at the gas station
My heart started racing
Saw this cutie who way thin
I stalk like Jason
With no authorization
I looked her in her face and asked her how her day went
And her digits
She said ""what is this?
It's none of your business""
I'm shorter than a midget
I fidget
Shit, she asked ""why are you nervous?""
I said ""your curves just amaze, they glaze my eyes over""
I told ya
She said ""Are you sober?""
Venomous like a cobra
""Don't you know that I'm older, than you
And your crew
You do what little boys do
You couldn't deal with this""
Then she sealed it with a kiss, yeah
I felt dissed, and my crew is steady laughing
And when I turn around they act like nothing had happened
Ahhhhhhh hahahahaha
Burn Del, Burn Del
That fool got clowned again man
Shot shot down
Oh here he come, Ok we out Del

She said ""You're Del!"" I said ""I know
The one on vinyl""
And then she hit a high note
""Y'all is Hiero
And where's Pep Lover?""
I said he on the other side of town
But her partner had a frown
2 out a 3's cool, it ain't bad
She must not know how to add
She tripping and things
Each finger got rings
We 'bout to bounce like springs
But she like ""Where my chicken wings?
Cutie like can you sign
This one time?
So you can be on my mind
To remind?""
I said fine
Tripping partner like ""Who he?
He ain't no one""

Ahonetwo, ahonetwo, I, I like it
Ahonetwo, ahonetwo, I""
I like to introduce myself, I like it

I'm chocolate like a bar but my name is not Roseanne
My skin has a pigment, reminiscent of a tan
I plan to grow dreads but first a nappy fro
The longer the hair, the easier to scare a foe
It grows from my head until it covers up my face
People look and stare when I walk into the place
This is just a taste from the Funky Human Being
Ain't no misbehavin', ain't no use for ravin'
Surrounded by the people who would stab me in the back
My skin is really brown even though it's labeled black
Sometimes I wear a cap, and sometimes I wear bandanas
Forbidden in L.A. but I wore one in Atlanta
I chiseled up a sculpture to complement my culture
Thoughts of silly Nubians is prone to give me ulcers
Hangin' with the brothers who are tribal in their ways
For this is how I like to spend my days, and it pays
To steal a groovy sample form the archives
Use my mental staff to eliminate apartheid
Still gather papes like my man Malcom Forbes
Ponderin' my life as I look into my orbs

Ahonetwo, ahonetwo, I, I like it
Ahonetwo, ahonetwo, I, I like it
Ahonetwo, ahonetwo, I
Ahonetwo, ahonetwo, I, I like it
Ahonetwo, ahonetwo, I, I like it
Ahonetwo, ahonetwo, I, I like it
Ahonetwo, ahonetwo, I
Ahonetwo, ahonetwo, I, I like it

I love the shade of green like my brother Billy Bixby
I utilize a sample that I salvaged from the 60's cause I'm picky
My meal must appeal to me like Morris
Far too many fraudulent opponents in the forest
I fall into the Gap when I need to purchase clothes
Easy on the fads cause the posers always pose
I suppose they will bite, they'll try not to show it
I came very plain and then feelin' rather loaded
I ditched all the beads cause my needs seem to differ
Me and CM-P are like the Gil and the Skipper
He will use his clippers to give himself a fade
I give my fro a sheen with a smidgen of Pomade
I laid in the shade and I greeted mixel place
With a rhythm and a rhyme and he said that it's a twist
From the ordinary everyday continual assumption that R&B and Rap makes a winner
Guess who's comin' through for dinner
A native-like brother with the passive little style
That most certainly will smother
Suicidal rhymes with apocalyptic tunes
I will drink a seltzer while you dabble with the booze
And giggle when I see ya liver shrivel to a prune
I'm the Funky Human Being not a monkey or a coon
Assume that the style is Funkadelic in the 90's
Del is livin' phat as I leave a foe behind me

Ahonetwo, ahonetwo, I, I like it
Ahonetwo, ahonetwo, I, I like it
Ahonetwo, ahonetwo, I

Eye Examination,The Best of... (The Elektra Years): B-Boy Handbook,1993,"Artist: Del the Funky Homosapien
Album: Dr. Bombay 12""
Song: Eye Examination
I never had real friends 'til now
I never had to steal ends cause that's foul
I walk the streets with the baseball bat feelin' secure
But I try not to incite fights that's immature
Actions that come back to haunt
I work hard to get the things that I want and never flaunt
Never post where the most guys post high
I keep my focus towards the ground
And I pound
Any brother who's my ace to my face
Even if he snakes on the unda' I try not to wonda'
Strainin' my brain wit' mental anguish
Strange, it's rather eerie
Clearly
Just a whim
I adjust the hymn
Deal with the dealers and the squealers and the jockeys
I can take the fizz out the carbonated copies
Imprints are made in the sand as I walk
Dim hints reveal rather grand as I talk
Small individuals seem larger
When they take charge of
Their antics
Makin' them gigantic
So you never suspect their neck bein' strained
So many situated thoughts in the brain
Heavy weight gain, so I weight train
'Cause to me the weight gain is a great gain
And I hate sane individuals close they nose to new aromas
I got the smellin' salts that are prone ta'
Clear the nasal, daze you
Probably make a raise to a new level
And see the true devil's
Any color ya wish because the devil takes any shape
Any form
Any swarm
Ride over your dish like a picnic
I think the sick shit
I had my wrist slit
Like a suicide
But I survived
And you can too
Plan to
Live a full life free of anxieties
While you're at it try to keep an eye on me

The man with meditation skills
Wastin' spills, lyrical liquid
Fillin' streams
Wit' dreams
And I will cream whoever seems wicked
Oral floral arrangements
Is strange since
You don't have the comprehension
I will stomp and lynch them
I'm not the one promotin' gun totin'
'Cause I contain within my brain these computations just as potent
The mental torturer of course you will acknowledge me
Cause Mr. Twister places pictures, mental fixtures of photography
Shitty little bitties never get their clitties licked
But I don't think they'll resist
Mr. Twister
When I flex my verbal techs
Exit
Mental anorexic
I don't cater to the imbecile so you can bet this
Is a brain buster
Pain thruster
Strain twister
Overwhelming pressure between the temples when I touch the microphone
I might condone
The usage of abuse if it is convenient
I slant and lean it
Like a lever when I leave ya mutilated
By my enunciated cleaver
I survived the ither and the either
Now let me take a breather
(PAUSE)
From my own little world
Little girls, little boys
Stay free of hurries
Free of worries
That's the riddle poised for posterity
Where are we
Goin' from here
As a ho
And I don't know
And that's the biggest feeaaar
When I'm slippin' into daaarknesss
Now I'm askin' can I spark this?

Hey this, is phat
Weigh this

For the mind, and for the soul
That's how I roll
Now I hold

Depended on it
I'm doin' ya bond it
My non gets warts it
And I'm apart from wackness
I'm separated
Did you like how I spiked the ball
Despite ya all
You could come bite a small portion
There's more in the vault
Halt, have a malt

I sustain phatter blends

Waitin' for you phucking imitations

Myself, when I'm making my wealth

I'm tellin' you that Del is truth
Appelin' through your arteries
You scar your knees
Bowing, praising, 
now when I phase in
Like Kitty Pryde
City wide
Confer to kick the rumor
Him admit he lies
The truth will set you free
When I uproot MCs
Execute MCs
I do my best to mute MCs
All it takes is intelligence
I'm great with embellishments
They need a savior
So Del is sent...

""Yeah, the truth, the truth, the nothing but the truth, I tell it to
The youth, propelling with the proof, in the puudin', wouldn't you
Like to know?, Oh, no you didn't, my flow is never quittin', and

And then niggas don't matter
A lot a rappers try frontin' on me
Bet they ain't got nuttin' on me
And ain't no way that buck can harm me
I turn the mouths of MCs into molecules
Niggas locked onto me like my follicles
I swallow fools with no regurgitation
We hurt ya face, men
When ya placed in my path


I bust asses
Ya slow like molasses
As this continues
Then you know the fastest
Computing, looting, I gets the root of things
Bitches with problems
I leave ya jaw numb
I slap hoes
My rap flows along
With the flow of the song
As I flow on the bong
I use Jedi mind tricks
To find tricks
Bind tricks, tie them up
Then I try and phuck then they die
And what do I care?
I dare hoes
And prepare flows cause I never spare those lives
Who strives
With knives & slice
I parylize ya twice
With fear
Del is nice to your ears
Snupe:
Not the hardest, artists going far
Jack off from Jupiter
Because I'm shooting for the stars
I'm a mack
Never come wack
Gimme a 30 second snippit
I'll rip it
Because the shit gets deeper
Creep ya ass as the floor rocks
We got the beat hittin' hard like four cops
Shorts out my last record
I write my rhymes nekkid
Let me give you a tip
I'm on the balls
So just expect it
My rep gets phatter thinkin' about those kids
They tried to step and got phucked like they momma did
By the Mr. Mostskill
I did ya ho, still
She's askin' for waxin' cause she heard a ho squeal
Hoes I'm, getting more plays than Showtime
The demon got ya screamin' with no shine
No time for regular run of the the mill
I'm packin' with steel boy soldiers
Never No More, the Souls told ya",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-no-more-worries-lyrics
Sleepin on My Couch,I Wish My Brother George Was Here ,1991.0,"Get your lazy butt up off my couch
Get your lazy butt up off
Get your lazy butt up off
Get your lazy butt up off my couch

It seems nowadays friends step to me bogus
And end up on my couch at night without notice
It's cool to have a friend over every now and then but I gotta have my space
And I don't wanna see their face
Like every single day of the week, talk is cheap
You betta find yourself another place to sleep
It ain't my fault that ya moms got fed up
And now you wanna come to my crib and wet my bed up
You better find a job so you can get an apartment
And you can save your crocodile tears don't even start with
The sob stories. I got enough from the other seven brothas in the den playin' Genesis
Damn I can't win at this
Seems like I'm gonna have to flip
And tell those other brothas that they're gonna have to skip
I've had it up to here with these lazy cats
They keep sleepin' on my couch and I'm tired of that

Get your lazy butt up off my couch
Get your lazy butt up off
Get your lazy butt up off
Get your lazy butt up off my couch

People come to my house and kinda wonder where the squadron's at
They're not gone, they're just down at the laundrymat
Because they wear the same pairs of clothing
I'm taking up crazy patience just holding
My temper
I'm about to start charging rent for
Every single brother that kicked it with my mother eating biscuits on Saturday morning like a family
The minute they step it's like moms is crazy mad at me
Cause they're in my mother's room watching television
I feel like giving 'em the boot and say the hell with 'em
But if I give 'em the boot I'm not a friend though
Even though my room smells like dime bags of indo
But I can't pretend like I haven't been peepin' it
Even mom knows that my brothas been sleepin' on
My couch for weeks. So your speeches fall flat
They keep sleepin' on my couch and I'm tired of that

Get your lazy butt up off my couch
Get your lazy butt up off
Get your lazy butt up off
Get your lazy butt up off my couch

Maybe this was just my upbringing perhaps
But I was taught that I shouldn't take seven day naps
At other brothas' cribs like I don't have a home
Brothas on my couch so much there's like foam
Coming out the seams and a pair of jeans
Is missing from my closet, I wonder why I even bother being friendly
They're running my ass like the Indy 5000
They went and wrinkled my mother's blouse
When they snuck downstairs for a midnight snack
And ate the last slice of bread and a box of apple jacks
Then they hit the sack with the stereo blastin'
And even little Tyson is fed up, so I'm askin'
You all to jet, before I get upset
And throw each and every one of you bums out on your back
My house is a mess, so step ya little pest
Who was sleepin' on my couch cause I'm tired of that

Get your lazy butt up off my couch
Get your lazy butt up off
Get your lazy butt up off
Get your lazy butt up off my couch",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-sleepin-on-my-couch-lyrics

To the rescue, extradition process
To get you all stressed, step onto my office
That's what you call fresh, it's more like some soft breasts
If I stopped cess, I probably would cough less
Test it, just to see if ya'll rested
I'm blessin' the beat just like if I was the best man
Yo, you miss it in ya' public school district
Get a book and do the physics, yo' I got a cool image
Like Hendrix, my kindred, y'all fuck up to my index
Bench press rappers doing sets with my Syntax
Ain't nothin' new motherfucker, man I been black
Impact, remember Malcolm X wore a pimp hat
You paper chasin' when you make it then you spit that
That your whole life shoulda never even been rap
Wannabe gangster fool around and get your friend capped
Talkin' hella shit my brother trying to buy a ten sack
Man, just call me amphibious
Submerging so deep yanking curtains on these idiots
Walking 'round oblivious more than annoying
Everywhere I turn a black life is destroyed
And times getting tough gotta sign for unemployment
Walkin' round the town all 'noid and bent
Out of posture from sixteen blunts, a pint of vodka
Intoxicated some of y'all call it faded
With my headphones slammin' playin Iron Maiden
Sleepin' in the lobby in the Days Inn

Right on schedule gold medalist rebellious (Who?)

Comin' up with new words like you must be a lummox
Wanna infiltrate my crew when you know you'll go nuts
Lactose intolerant your bowels'll blow up
Catastrophic so deep can't locate with metal detectors
Listen more than once, you'll need several inspections
I'm sicker than a beef recall
Reiterate the fact with flows that free-fall
Reintroduction the classic material, that last with imperial
Props and Pop Will Eat Itself
Hotter than coals, tread and your feet'll melt
Like plastic I castrate contenders
With a crew that got more power than the West Coast Avengers
Sit and let your ears swim in the splendor

To the text I toggle and tilt
Best taste is bottlin' milk
The model of filth
Who's the nastiest?
Who would ever ask me this?

Before you take half a step
Eager like a bachelorette
With a lack of respect
Like a youth packin a tech
The whole attraction is death
Plethoras electra to bisto
Come to my creep show
To logic is lethal
I repo ya flow
Recucitate
Reanimate
So now it's a candidate
Most likely to laminate
In other words who wanna get served?

Child birth the rhyme and leave stretch marks
Etch art with text darts

Sale of ale and all the bomb you want
There's no counterpart
Take my rhyme around the park
And piss on you like a hound to bark
Down to spark blee's and all
Unbelievable
I see through walls
With evil galls
I feed 'em balls
Agent of derangement
Entertainment tainted
Wit insane
It's flagrant
Foul fragile famous cadence
You'll never make it to day break
Save face
You just a grey space
I lay waste
Rated with frangrance rancid
I can't miss it
Enhanced mits allow me to advance quick
With antics you tamper with your trustees
I bust these as rapidly as slush freeze
You must need parental guidance
Your mental's out of alignment
My mind set is the finest
The pen let you jack off too often
While you sleepin' she contaminate your sperm and offspring
I offset any threat to my nature
Face you with eight flares and a saber
Pave ya till I hit paved dirt
While you blaze dirt
I flame the greenest bomb
Fool, I better never see your palm
You peeping tom
I'ma need the force of my whole crew to keep me calm
I sneak a bomb to your mesa
Disgraced ya
Waste ya
Leave a stain the size of Asia

Who is the two like the Blues Brothers?
Yeah, who does it?
Me and you, kid, we bruise dozens
And hundreds of kids havin' fun with the wiz
That's me and...
Unicron, the inhuman on the mic...yikes!
Zoinks! I zaps saps who can't rap
They sound like beginners
I slam then I pin ya (Slam)
Send ya to the hospital, I gots the flow
No nigga dare step
You'll get your hair swept
Off the floor when I clip ya
Button ya lip ya
Even if the record skips, I still rip
(Damn, that nigga ripped that!)
Toe the rivers, equip ya punk posse
Ya got lots to see, days to come
Before you raise from dumb to smarter
Rippin' apart a poser
Bend 'em inside out like yoga
I'm a nice person on the inside
But men hide when you and your friend die
But a hand to the strangler (The strangler)
The Benihana chopper
And we oughta pop ya and crop ya
'Cause we're sick of that shit (Sick of it!)
I'm about to have a fit and split ya head
And kick ya bitch in the tits
They're tender, mixin' niggas brains like a blender
I kick rhymes like these to injure
And end ya, off ya
Never comin' softer
This is not the best I can offer (Not the best)
I'mma save some for later
You ain't greater
Than the man with a plan and the brand that is name
And I hate ya

I'm the youngsta with the swift tongue
Or the kid that lives up the street over Jon's beat
I make rappers eat turds and hay
It doesn't matter what version you play, I will still slay
A crowd of rhymers, and Del, how'd I find ya?
That one summer years ago I shoulda signed ya
Just a quick reminder for those who find a...
Problem with me, I'll put you on 'noid like a TNT timer
And there's only 20 seconds
Now I'm 16 and yes fiend to wreck shit (Wreck it)
I throw temper tantrums, that's my anthem
I'm not very big
But if you fuck with me, you'll be like Jerry's Kids
Fucked up and that's tough luck
Unicron has never backed down from a tough fuck (Never)
That's what lubricated Trojans are for
'Cause I know when the core hits the tip, I got the dip
Flippin' and sippin' on my nipples
And I will have a fit, too
'Cause I get excited when I ride it
Fun while it lasted
Cas, did you like
When I did a song, back in the day with the Del-a-ray? (That's me!)
Get a patna, I'm glad you got the chance
To enhance the Jive roster
I'm a foster kid but Del hooked me

Style Police,Both Sides of the Brain,2000.0,"I think it’s time to get the zap board
The rap lord has disembarked to restore the missing parts
For all ya’ll, stiffer than starch
You know the pictorial symbol
Portable nimble brain waves got my grimy chains jiggling
I’m burning at Higher Learning like Singleton
Single out simpletons with stylings such as Intercon
It’s the bomb let’s get it on
Mr. Bombay to you
Slay a crew You never paid your dues
You’re testimony phony bologna
And boney with only a wooden leg to stand on
Like a pregnant panda in the wilderness and I’m the wildebeest
And I see you still a thief with my style in the grill of your teeth
Diligently apealing with speech with militant beats
In and of leaks to let my feet miss the freeze
Mysterious blistering like the gold on Mr T Handicap your voyeurism destroy your vision
Massive with gashes no defended forms step in the swarm of bees leave with hives
Rhymes conceive with knives of flesh
While you're wild as exile
My text styles spookier than x-files
You fruity like a pedophile
After the battle cries thats when I metabolize
While you fantasize I antagonize like replacement killers ease your filler
Ridiculous, meticulous
Fry you like a chicken breast
Fuck your smith n wesson
Pull you out of the oven get the dressing
With possession
Question all directions
While you still a suck petulance
Stuck dwelling in the past
(x2)
Pull over, get out of the car (You’re under arrest)
Slowly put your hands behind your head legs crossed(You’re under arrest)
I do it till I feel fine
Real rhyme, still time
Stop frame, drop change
Rock brain, stock exchange
Mock my name
There’s not a lot to gain from that
When I’m up to bat its like you trying to duck a gat
You commonplace
I shift time and space
Leave your mind erased like the year 2000 and data replaces the faces
Cause there is no oasis
I wield your locations
A military pack of black tornadoes
I Fernando Slam you on an anvil
Scrape you with a breakthrough
Lacerate your plastic face acquired though plastic surgery
I leave your flow burgundy and crimson limbs and arteries
Down in the chart MC’s
As I’m sipping margaritas its a part of the feature from the particle preacher
Universal ubiquity when you sit with me and chat
You will get to see a fat flow that fried your brain cells like formaldehyde or alkaline
Check the words now combined
Leave you with powder burns
Deltron Z has now returned
My dogmatic songs average rap artists
I’m an author who augments my solstice to the tip with my groove essentials
I’m coming in a hydrofoil spreading hydroponics
While you chasing the dragon
Like you're facing a magnet
My brain is digital playing with analog controllers
Force movement in increments with instruments

Soopa Feen,Both Sides of the Brain,2000.0,"Haha, yeah
It's Soopa Feen back in the house, baby
Yeah, bitch
Yeah
Yeah, Soopa Feen in the house
Gimme some crack, fool
I ain't no bitch(?) I'm Soopa Feen
I'm the greatest superhero in the universe
Listen to me, fool
Listen to me, I'm Soopa Feen
Chillin
Chillin up in this bitch
Leaping over tall buildings in a single bound
Hey, how much you want for that?
Trade you these shoes (x2)
I'll trade you these shoes
Bitch I'll steal that shit from you
Nigga, I'm Soopa Feen

Soopa Feen he used to gleam and glow
Before he became a fiend for blow
Unredeemable
I seen him go insane
Straight from cocaine graduated to no brain
He went from Polo’s to no name
Pawned everything even his gold chain
Now his skin is dingy
He be singeing his lips on a glass tube and pass on food
His ass all glued to the seat of his pants
Got cuts and hella pus on his feet and hands
Completely entranced, Give this nigga a face wipe
Before he meet his contact, Commissioner Base Pipe for new assignments
Cause he said it don’t taste right
He used to cop that hop
So his face might look familiar to some
And now your boy’s plumb dumb
Running around the slums
Sticking out his tongue at young females
He sees trails, he thinks they’re aliens
He starts bellin’ in the precinct, his feet stink
They throw him in the clink
Cause he 5150

Shit, It's a place to sleep
Beggars can't be picky, you motherfucker
I don't give a fuck if it is in jail
I'll be on the concrete floor
The greatest in the universe
Where my faulty folks at?
Faultor, baby
Come on, Faultor my faulty shiesty folks, come on
You know I need my crack
You get your amphetamines smoked up
We out

He got his Garfield and Odie beach towel for a cape
And safety pin he use to clean the screen
(Feen: I was a fiend before I became a teen)
Now he’s a vigilante on Delancey
Then ran to Chancellor looking for his counselor
(His trusty sidekick Faultor) for an ounce or a sack at least
(Feen: (?) the streets and then it's back to sleep)
Well actually he got the master keys
More practices in the crack cave where they got a factory
Soopa Feen is skinny can slide through small areas for quick getaways
While Faultor pull the Derringer
That’s his ace
Shiesty as fuck
His specialty is gafflin' niggas, extorting their bucks
His best power, the invisible gank
If in your wallet there isn’t no bank
He contacts Soopa Feen with telepathy
Saying (Feen: You need crack man? I need some amphetamines)
He’s faster than a speed trip
Stronger than a nigga on ‘ron
He think he a superhero
Pshh, He just gone

Bitch I ain't gone, yo mama gone
I'm Soopa Feen
I got all my fact-tilities
All my utilities, bitch
I ain't home when I wear this cape cause I be flying
Sky high, sky high motherfucker

He can’t really fly but he uses a harness
To leap tall buildings in his undergarments
His teeth are tarnished
He was banished from Berkely
Now he’s up in North Oakland looking really perky
Never think he’s jerky
But he really is
He plays with the neighborhood kids with fizz
Coming out the side of his mouth
Sometimes he hides in the house devisin' new routes
So he could be up out if he see po-po
If they stalkin' while he jaywalkin' looking very awkward
He don’t stay far from the corner where they slang 'caine
He got the mega migraine sort of like his spider sense
That he can’t fight against
Me I’d rather light a spliff
That’s as high as I can get
But Soopa Feen is super human
He got the crystal lungs from the planet base with cream
Will get you sprung
And niggas wanna beat your ass for all the shit you done
But you fight crime in your own special way
When you in the holding tank and other fiends won’t let you get your way
You never catch a case cause you're slick
Pipe beams projecting, but you’re never caught with shit

You know why I'm never caught with shit?
Cause I'm Soopa Feen, bitch
I get out real quick, fool
Just like a trapdoor
I don't need your commentary
Quit talking to me you (?) and show me some respect
Nigga, I'm god(?) the third
Hey, I really need something though
I got a PlayStation
A PlayStation nigga
You wanna buy it? 50 bones
PlayStation, nigga
Play-stee
That's yo language, nigga
Play-stee, right?
Motherfucker, buy my shit
I'm Soopa Feen (x2)
You can't hold me back, boy
You can't hold me back
The greatest ever(?)
I'll fault yo ass
You gotta do this man
Young Soopa feen
Really old though, but I'm young, younger, too
I be doin it back in your days
Back, back before you was doin your shit

Niggas cut! You know the skit
Del ultimate
Rapper international, with that rational style
I get the, shit off my consciousness and
Pull out the compasses
I'm on some shit you ain't around, in the town, clown!
Rebound!
Go get on your intercom and call
Your weakass crew so I can call protocol
I don't give a shit, I wants to get lit (""yeah!"")
Split the Philly roll that bitch!
And it better hits correct and right
Make sure po-po out of sight
Or they gonna have us locked up tonight, sike!
We in the cut with the best bomb available
Peelt out laughin' in a trail of smoke
Oaktown, where niggas get down in more ways than one
It don't stop till the raising sun
Mentally unstable with the rhymes that rock yo' cradle
The author of fatal flows that liquidate emcees
Then I scoop 'em with a ladle
I stay ill and psyched
Outta my mind with mics but gotta be in before sunlight
Emcees approach me with chains of garlic
But their brains are targets
Then I dump off the carcass
A lot of niggas fuss just 'cuz we the best for us
Niggas faker with they raps than the Snuffleluffagus
Lifts and bends, I recommend
Before I make blood suspend
When I check that chin
It's common knowledge Mr. Del demolish (""You ain't know?"")
Taking you back to the days of cornbread and collards, come on!

Yeah!
I perceive more than the average madness
Niggas get the giggles when they find my shit is pivotal
The radical, hip-hop fanatical who do what's natural
Actual fact, no tact, you'll get intercepted!
Kept it away, from emcees 'cuz they
Wouldn't know what to do wit' it
Pursuing it don't mean you gonna catch it
I slay willing women backwards on the mattress
At this access got niggas yackin'
I'm crackin' safes and niggas actin' fake
I got the date to arrange your weight
About spent every cent on the bomb
Fuck being calm, I'm like a shell-shocked vet from 'Nam
So turn to Psalms, get your palms off my dick
Before I go sick and make yo' ass hit the bricks
I used to stay on 57th the resident bussed to havin' it 
To stay out late at night 'cuz none of these niggas is Heaven-sent
I'm bent, puffin' killer-Cali hit the vent
I lend my voice to tracks, as we's the instrument
A Public Service Announcement on how I house shit
I hope your blouse fit, bitch, you fight with fists
But if I ask you ""Let's battle"" you might resist
I wax that ass on Pay-Per-View and invite Tha Liks
The steel-cage grudge-match where there's no escape
I'll peel that cap like bananas to apes
Oh yeah! them niggas, it figures
The masterminds behind the rhymes you claim were yours
We lick off with rhymes like Nas and make your brains stain the floors
At last we clash under the overpass

Del: Damn, we've been waiting here for hella long, since 12
Opio: I'm tellin' you, man, they don't wanna see me on the mic

Now this first shit, is about me...

When it's time for me to recline
I listen to rhymes and beats in the waves of the spine
To the brain
Relievin' pain & anguish
The stangest arrays make me sway and make my day brighta
The hip hop invita
Write arrive a little soona
Check the soles on my Pumas
My attitude is miserable
Cause in my mind I'm sayin' here's a fool I don't like
I won't strike his ass in the face
I'm blastin' the bass in my headphones
A fool don't have to get his head flown
Why waste time with rhymes?
I get straight to the point
Like I HATE when funk's in the joint
When hip hop is playin'
Threatenin' to spray men
Don't threaten me
Or you won't be able to see
When I gouge ya eyes out
I despise doubt
On your part
Like I won't stab you in your heart
My flow is drastic
Serious, sarcastic
My motto is
""Fuuck with me & get your ass kicked.""
And that's the key to understandin' me
And if they cool then the foot is what you'll be brandin', B
Yeah...

Check it ooout (check it ooout)
Check it ooout (check it ooout)
This shit is fat (check it ooout)
You know you like it (check it ooout)
Now peep this shit (check it ooout)
Yo, peep this shit (check it ooout)
Yo, this is for the homies (check it ooout)
This is your shit, your shit so you can be cognitive(check it ooout)
If you can rap
Yeah...

I love to peep a rhyme
First of all I'm seein' if my man can keep the time
If he go off beat, and it's on purpose
He gotta come back on beat
Or the effort is worthless
I like ot hear a cool flow
But if it's identical to another, he a fool for it
Ya gotta build
Upon skills
And all that copy that most popular rapper shit can get killed
I like a nigga who is quick-witted
Cause it make me feel like I do, when I come from where my dick split it
And I admit it, it's a joy
When I hear a nigga avoid the wack and make 'em paranoid
I loves niggas who talk shit
Cause that's my department
I got somethin' for anyone who starts shit
Cause I'm relentless
With a sentence
A jail sentence, after I beat you senseless
I like niggas when they add rhymes, mad rhymes
Then I laugh at niggas who fell off but had rhymes
Just some descriptions of what I like to listen to
With my Bruce Banner scanner point of view...

Peep! Yo peep that shit that nigga talkin' about Bruce Banner (check it ooout)
Fuckin', Incredible Hulk shit (check it ooout)
Peep that shit (check it ooout)
Yo check it out (check it ooout)
Check that shit out (check it ooout)
Yo check it out (check it ooout)
Yo, peep this last shit (check it ooout)
Everybody about to know this shit (check it ooout)

She makes some money
For puttin' other niggas down
You nuthin' but a clown
You can't write
And you're not bright
You fail to notice the dopeness
Cause you have no insight
You need to quit
You ain't shit
You need to get a lesson, in hip hop detection
And you're next in my list to jack
It's a fact not fiction
Bitch, stop ya bitchin'
You write articles
I'mma rip apart ya skull
Cause ya dull
Not entertainin'
I'mma put ya brain in orbit
Cause I'm morbid
Thinkin' a new ways to kill ya
And yo
I feel ya
Ya too critical
And ain't got a bit a pull
Just admit it fool
Before we get rid of you
A rolling stone gathers no moss
And now who will pay the cost
And afterwards get lost
Hit the dirt, before you get hurt
I eat stupid bitches like you and a rhyme for dessert
I bet you never get no dick
You make me so sick
So my pistol is loaded...

Hey you check what this ho did?
Yeah I checked that bitch, I checked that bitch

No, you can't come in, heh, you can't come here
Yeah, the key don't work no more, hee-hee
You fucking around, yeah you smarter than me
You smarter than me, hee-hee

I don't know, who now, how do it feel since you
No longer have connections, with me, you dumb and
Hungry and famished, you must be, your plan is vaulted
You don't wanna play a game, it only works when you young and beautiful
Now you should know - how neither of these herbs gassin' you
That would have you boosting clothes
Left you hanging, dry and stupid though
So know it's your turn to play with Cupid's bow
Your brain's looping slow, you stupid ho
Yeah, you should know, but the foolish don't
You don't get too close, cause you know the truth will show
Vulnerability, see, is something I went through before

Yeah, yeah... I seen this movie before, it's weak
The plotline is very thin
Yeah, it lacks substance, very predictible
I give it a thumbs down, I give it a thumbs down

See, I studied psychology since a young'n
So I spot every move, you make
I may not see it clearly through all the sweet talk
You got beef, walk, yeah I love you, but not like that
You try to stop my act, with your high for looting, childhood retribution
It won't rest til you get, your licks in
Vixen Victoria's Secret stories, you keep within
Your witch's brew, for due -- you
Fancy as a, not too shroud, denial you choose
But your eyes on the glue, to your inner most
And, when I'm host to your bizarre sideshow, they expose for you

Yeah, cause remember the wicked witch
When she looked in the mirror, and then the mirror just shattered and shit
Cause she was so ugly and shit, but ugly on the inside though
See you don't dig me, when I'm saying that
You gotta feel me, when I say, that that's the wicked witch

You seem lost so why would you try deviating
From what would seem to be, the clear choice to making
Such a situation, such as this, now wake up
I play pops for a few, but you gotta do what I say
But you gutter babe, through and through, you ain't have enough yet
Pushing pussy for product, having a good time is what you call it
All of it, washed away the memoirs of an alcoholic
Now you out for my wallet, and give me a hard time too
Just to show me a thing or two, about, how low the low be
Well don't get cold feet, when you discover I hold heat
To melt that cold heart, that's so weak

You know... it ain't nothing but a thang
See, um, if you start, um, doing something stupid around here
I'mma come out there and I will beat a bitch ass
I will beat a bitch down to the ground
And, I might have to get some paper though
Cuz, since you already out here fucking up and shit
Youknowhatimean, but, you ain't nothing though really
That's you though, you know? That's not me",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-fragments-lyrics
Love is worth,Future Development,1997,"Okay

You got to know what your love is worth
Baby boy you got to know what your love is worth
Baby girl you got to know what your love is worth
Everybody got to know what their love is worth

Yeah, you got to know what your love is worth
As soon as a child is born and discovers earth
It's a part of life, so don't get fucked in the end
If someone's a lost cause, they'll be summoned up to start again
Example, you a woman, in a relationship
It seems like everything you do makes him flip
It ain't physical violence, or nothing like that
But the love that you show he doesn't show back
But it started when you first met
You looked incredible to him, he wanted to get his thirst wet
(yeah, I bet)
He wanted to be down like Brandy
At first his overbearing persona was so manly (ooooh)
But now you're thinkin' most of the time, ""he can't stand me""
He lost trust in you when he saw you with Randy (haha)
But then you find out he feel good about Candy (About Candy)
You thinkin' this relationship is really demanding
Everyone makes mistakes and that's true
But from the beginning did he really love you?
To him you a bitch, he told his boys he dug you out
And nowadays he don't even hug you (doubts)
And I'm sure it do more than bug you
You wonder how you get attracted to these
With a mackin disease, with a tactic to please
But once you settle down you're entrapped in a squeeze
Like a boa constrictor and he know when he gets ya
You got to know what your love is worth
That way you don't waste it on the world goin berserk
Yeah
 - repeat 2X
You got to know what your love is worth
Baby boy you got to know what your love is worth
Baby girl you got to know what your love is worth
Everybody got to know what their love is worth
(guys talking)

Now put yourself in the shoes of this guy
You fall in love with this girl and you don't know why (why dude?)
Cause you don't feel the same but you give it a try
Eyes wide, like you a child in a candy store
Even though you the one she couldn't stand before
Cause you was houndin' her, surroundin' her (damn) with confusion
You used to be friends, but now the friendship is losin'
Cause you visualize the romance, she like ""no hands off""
She don't wanna fuck with no man, ""not even a slow dance?""
You tried to kiss her and she even agrees
But that don't mean you 'bout to be Adam and Eve
In the Garden of Eden, but maybe for the evening
You say she leading you on, but you just added pressure
Of course she like you, you're friends don't try to test her
She says she likes you as a friend, not a lover or wife
So get a life, let her live hers and find another
Don't let her smash her ego, cause we know you're great
Let it be her mistake, yeah
Don't waste your time bro cause you know
If she don't appreciate what he do for her
Then tell me why he should wait around

You got to know what your love is worth
Baby boy you got to know what your love is worth
Baby girl you got to know what your love is worth
Everybody got to know what their love is worth",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-love-is-worth-lyrics
Hoodz Come in Dozens,I Wish My Brother George Was Here ,1991.0,"60's Frat Rock
Yet the economy was collapsing
And there's been a wave of minor bombings against Ameri...
Gang violence is escalating, in such a manner I think, the
The mere violence itself has become part of, of the gang life
Part of the thrill

Thieves in the night, stick you in the alleyways
They might cause fright, they stick you up for Bally suede shoes
And in the news, and even on Geraldo
You can choose who will lose a pair of shoes (Yup) word
The ones with the Reebok Pumps get their rumps rearranged
For their change now their down in the dumps (Yup)
You spent two yards, to sport em on the first day of school
And like a fool, you went out like the worst way
They pulled out a tool, and asked you to remove them
Quickly, I told em not to do it and they hit me (What?) in the mouth
With the nine, I thought they was like kinfolk (punk)
I never thought crime would elevate up the Twin Oaks way
But hey, everybody is a victim
Hoodz come in dozens, the magic word is (stick em)
When they spot you and they got you and you can't deal with em
All because you spent two G's on your Boomin System
Loud enough for the whole block to hear
But now they caught you at the light and you're drownin in your tears
(Punk you better raise your ass up out this car)
(Come out off the car punk 'fore your ass gets blasted)
It never was your fault that your shit was expensive
You shoulda bought a vault, and now I gotta mention that
Hoodz come in dozens, read it in the papers
Seems like everyone caught a little vapors
You can't escape em, so don't even plan it
Gangsta Boogie fever has taken over planet Earth
Now your life is worth a pair of Jordans?
Now I wear Vans and my fans think I'm poor
When I walk down the block, with money in my sock and shoe
I hate you Mista Gangsta, cause everyone is mocking you
Now I can't get no rest because you pests keep
Killing little children like their sneakers are worth a million
Bucks, it really is a bummer
Someone tried to get me for a coat last summer
(Your coat, check it in punk, hahah) Damn
Hoodz come in dozens so watch your back
Cause they all on the attack and you'll never know
When they'll show up, but when they do
You better throw up your hands like a fan and surrender
Nigga don't be a pretender
You ain't the Hulk G
Give up the cash and all the big bulky jewelry
(All of it) (In broad daylight?) That's the plan kid
They don't even care if it's candid
Because passerbys mind they own beeswax
So they like steppin' to you like yo I'll take these, black
Give up your cash and your jewels without a argument
Otherwise you'll catch one between the eyes (bang)
Don't play hero, cause hero plus a bullet equals zero
Give up your dough and cheerio old chap
You didn't get a cap busted in your temple
See, it's just that simple

Remember that hoodz come in dozens
(You're god damn right)
Hoodz come in dozens
(like thieves in the night)
Hoodz come in dozens

Undisputed Champs,The Best of... (The Elektra Years): B-Boy Handbook,1993,"A'ight, hold up, hold up
Now introducing, up front, my man Pep Love

My introduction, it's such an unbelievable pleasure
For you to treasure, and much needed to
Make it phat though, on another plateau
You've been needin' to get in the groove, I do it natural
As we get Jazzy with classy shit
To make them hard ass rappers wanna blast me (buck buck)
'Cause I exemplify a pimpified mack
In actin like the shit nigga
Mashin' rappers with a passion
When I get Tip and Tribe flashin' lyrics
I smash your spirits
Like a big disappointment
But this here shit will surprise ya, devise a plan
A pipsqueak, shit's weak 'cause the size of the man
So if you wanna measure up then press your luck
'Cause when I'm in the cut man there ain't no catchin' up
I bet ya never heard a nigga with a vigorous flow
Figure this bro gettin' ate like a clitoris? No
I never could'a seen it
I rip a rapper's balls off
To make him scream when its convenient
Hear ye, hear ye
Clearly we're the
Undisputed ones that you get mad at when you hear me
Pompous comp just barely even registered on the meter
'Cause we the niggas that they checkin' for
Me and you or, you and him, ruinin' them
Doin' men in when I'm cuein' him in
On the one

Yeah, two... three, four

Now niggas know I got lyrics out the anal
And any move that you make could be fatal
The poet that shows it: and some of y'all niggas know it when ya
Grab the mic and you can't recite (you're weak)
Yo that gets me irate when ya can't debate
But wait- Now ya niggas think that I'm ya runnin' mate?
Naw, fuck that, 'cause when I grab the baton I'm gone (Zoom)
All around the track like a runnin' maniac (Damn)
You're babblin', you're babblin', son; what the fuck?
Anybody can grab the gun and go buck (Psshewww)
But can you grab the mic and kick ill shit? (Like)
Stun 'em with the verbs, instead of using clips
Check it: I flip styles by the dozen
I could even do things that you thought I was but I wasn't
You MC's are slipping into rigor mortis
Give it up please and just support this
I got styles that are legendary, even in the clink
Poetic reality, what the fuck you think?
'Cause I'm down with the D-E-L
So what the hell?

I never come from the temple of simple rappers
Your rap's poor, I'm on track, I lap yours
Collapse yours, elapse forever
You're never gonna get better bitin', my friend
But I lend a hand helping
MC's yelping like puppies (Arf! Arf!)
Their rhymes are supple
My rhymes are roughed up
Like a duffel bag, mags on my wheels squeal
Peel out towards your head while others bust lead, that's dead
I beat your head in the resin when the pipe hits the buds in my chamber
My rhymes are never tamer
Perpetrators I'ma hurt ya later/after
On the path of danger
I got fangs not bangs
Like a bitch which I use to puncture
With punctuation and mutation
Racin' like my thoughts
Bust shots to scatter
And my latter lets me elevate
Over MC's that are hella fake
My reaction to your rappin' is laughin'
Has-beens are askin' to get their ass kicked
'Cause you're plastic
I'm bringing lyrical lacerations
That you're tastin
Painful I maim foes metaphorically
Historically used the hip hop
To make your neck pop, nod in awe
When I kick the modern style

Q-Tip

The undisputed ones that you get mad at

Don’t Forget the Bass,Future Development,1997,"I'm ready for action, packing provisions of visions
Verbally, every word will be enhanced
With the bass that'll put you in a trance
Some dance, come take a chance
Del won't do you wrong
I've been in the rap game too long to falter
I rock like Gibraltar
Make you kneel to the butt like an altar
We prove the groove is improved, when you add water
Caught em with vibration that soothes your back like massages
Before you can park your car in garages
It'll be just for riders, listening to 'ROCK THE BELLS'
You can barely hear the vocals
Mixing is important, getting the public into chokeholds
Hip hop hopefuls will do well to know this
It ain't about who's the dopest
It's who gets the fan's focus upon you
When they feel what the song do
I think I'm onto something, when I got my shit pumping
I remember, when they were satisfied with just lyrics
Now, if the music 's flat
I can barely stand to hear it
And my rhymes are impeccable and you can't dissect my flow
With music sounding like it's out of tin cans
Just wretch the whole vibe and strive for perfection
Why you think they call this a profession? Hey

Can't forget the bass, the bottom got em crawling to the wall man
We got cassettes, CD's and LP's
DJ's for days, whatever you do
Give it your all, cause that's what pays

I just love when I can hear the bump pleading to the walls
In the halls, coming from the record stores in the malls
A beat with balls, I like that
It bites back and strikes back
At niggas who are wack, cuz
Back in the day when hip hop was just developing
Was back in the day
We should be relishing in experience
All you newcomers better be leery cause
Hieroglyphics got the bump
And it ain't mysterious


This don't apply to the niggas who sell out
And fell out their fan base
Trying to chase the big bucks
It sucks, I know, when your heroes wanna appear to hoes
Supermacho! And watch the whole role and image of a mic champion
To the fam base it simply can't be done
Cuz they're your folks when you don't get the prop shit
Cause they know you got the top shit and in it only for profit
But since we on the topic, let me drop it
We need to stop this segregation of hip hop
Talking 'bout fuck the east coast, and fuck the west
He's sold out, cause someone either sings a toast in the chorus
What is real hip hop then? Only the shit you listen to
Everything else pretending, I'm sending a message to my fan base
Fuck this is hip hop and this is rap, it came from the same place
And there's a place for everything including hieroglyphics
And we gonna come with it, as long as y'all with it
Cause the fan base is like a legion
For one cause, we want the dope shit cause
The other got flossed ??? Now
I'm a fan who likes a lot of different things
I differentiate with music just to spread my wings
I always do my best, that's why the fans love me
Not some contrived shit, so I can be bubbly
We all got some preferences, that's just how it goes
But when you see there's an effort being made, don't turn up your nose
Turn up the bass, race to go and buy it
Some of y'all love it - don't you, don't deny it",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-dont-forget-the-bass-lyrics

He ain't with it man..

Yo man, don't pay no attention to him man, he's kinda weird you know, but alright..
""Oh yeah""

Del made a pact to be well natural
Back from the wishing well to sell actual
Funk from the fungus grown in the trench
It's getting kinda heavy so I gotta pinch an inch
And it's a cinch
To let my hair grow like a plant
Eliminate the fat gold chains and the diaper pants
Trade 'em for a pair of Girbauds
Never make friends with the fraudulent foes
Yes I suppose that I'm fat from the supper
Skinny from the many that try to eat plenty
Now I got to flip on a copper like a penny
Vice versa
Quench your thirst with
A swig of grapefruit juice straight from the thermos
Hock your jewels, and you can drop your tools
And make a move that can turn us in the right direction
Show your affection, as I correct men
Who try to pull the wool over third eye
Comin' fly with Mr. Greenjeans
It's a bird eye view of the Meadow
As I greet the many people that I meet with a ""Hello""
""How do you do, my compadre?"" ""What up Kwame?""
Back to the Meadow so I can show I'm a
Smooth black brother that is gifted
And if you try to lift this, yes I got a witness
Nicknamed the Emperor
This wasn't meant for ya'
Ya little crumbsnatcher!


See what I mean man?
Damn!

I wish my brother George was here..

Help Me Out,Beats & Lyrics (Industry Hip Hop Compilation: Issue One),UnKnown,"Back, Del impetuous
Tempestuous
Bust flows impervious
Under fire like asbestos
All MCs grip my testicles
Let them go
No, 
I spread your flow like metal pull
Utensils such as scalpels
Over your Adam's Apple
To make you alto
Doggin' MCs and feed 'em Alpo
Your plan backfires to my satires
Got your flow sittin' on flat tires
My roguish rhymes rip through your lip when you bite
Like a lightnin' bolt, for a volt of molten mic
Hazardous to the average
Volt and death strike
To your neck right
On target
Bull's eye
Then deflected off your neck with such velocity
It's sets the hip hop hostage free
In the terminal burnin' all MC's brains
Accelerated agents got you walkin' on canes
I'll be brief like Hanes
Mundane MCs get caned to retain my title
The vital organ donor
To cut through the bologna
My escapades let you wave through the masquerade
Rain with disaster man out in your play book
Cause they took
The funk merged with hate
And then regurgitate
This concludes part of what causes murder rates to bubble
Meanwhile I take the shuttle to this girls crib so we can cuddle
And listen to my subtle rebuttals to butthole
Hook:
Words and phrases I prefer to play with
What occurs when I made it
Is never outdated
Help me out (x2)
Verse 2:
I stifle your mic hold your grips slips don't bet all your chips
Thrown away all your tips for thinkin'
That's dangerous
Leave that to the big boys
Sicker than Sig Freud
Peep, you wanna live forever but take too many chances
You with many can get a piece of Eastside Oakland folks
When provokin' spoken dialects of broken English
That distinguish us from y'all
We cause shots at all spots on the globe
And disrobe your mode of mediocrity like Socrates
My Egyptian inscription's shiftin'
Brain cells with sick afflictions
Suckas must be simpin'
Hop like Lipton
You'll get the microphone when I'm though if then
I formed a rapport with my siblings
The sort of thing that keep the crew tight
Even in it's new life
You think you're able to label the Hiero sound?
You still haven't found a comparable variable
I aim my flows they close in like smart bombs
Bury ya, restricted areas
Me and my playmates, we talented hip-hop paladins
Paddling the charlatans
Knowing what we are to them
Makes us try hard to win
We attend the track promptly
Rappers wanna chomp me
They empty
I'm mega morph with mega force don't fort deceit the beat
It's a treat
A peak at the war on the weak
Hook
Verse 3:
Del carelessly cavorting
Over more things than tracks
Your skulls perhaps
Spinal taps, vinyl lapse over each other you'll discover
Soon enough how tough it is to scruff them bids
At auctions I'm lost in madness
Lackadaisical but coming back to fade you all
I don't make music for the teeny boppers
The coppers and proper bourgeois
Y'all can lose me
Or find me but keep in mind we
Underground when you get offended
As you often do when you newcomers
Check the rap scene for a few summers
Then when it change you shift lanes
But first you mergin'
First you was a virgin splurgin' money on P.E
Then with N.W.A
But too much trouble to play
Mom on your ass turn that trash down
Your little brother getting' bright ideas in the background
He use to war Hush Puppies
Now he and his homies is dust junkies sellin' crack cross country
Use to be a momma's boy
Now you a grown man with no plan
All alone in the 
land of the free and the home of the brave
Free to be your own mental slave
Del has to have a word with you
Because you deserve to do what you want to
But mistakes come back to haunt you

Stress the world, stress the world....
I offer the maximum that you call for
Who better to get a crowd to go bloww!
Del, champion of true I do what the others can't do
So when ya come to, recognize I despise weak
I'm at my peak I seek more
Than the boredom that you are accustomed to
The connoisseur I love hip-hop more
Than I did as a kid so I gotta get rid
Of those who pose, case closed
I'm dynamic with panic and that's exactly how I planned it

You better peep cuz the price steep for those who sleep
I pile my rhymes by the heap on cassettes, Lp's, cd's and 12 inches
Perform the shit and get the girl like pinches
With good intentions, the key word is redemption
For those who try to shit on my crown let's get down
Plastic ass rappers get smashed like crackers
First I shalack ya and hit ya with the lacquer
Then I go to marijuana class to study cultivation
So I can make the USA a better nation
Get smoked, mellow out, vibe fuck the stress
While I kill MC's that say ""he's relentless.""
Past you at last due to technological enhancements on my part the art advances
My rhymes are ravishing, ravaging the hip-hop surface
To get to the underground for pounds and purchase
Merciless, as soon as I insert the disc
Into the SP to make the world stress me
Let's be upfront and real
What's up with this rap regurgitation that appeal to the masses?
I got pure plain funk hold the Mayo
Like the formulation of ice crystals make the suns halo a rainbow
Painful to MC's at large I barge and bulldoze them all when I charge
Personally responsible, behind all the hoopla
Haven't crossed the board, get the troubleshoota

Stress the world...( make the world stress me)
Stress the world...( make the world stress me)
Stress the world...( make the world stress me)
Let's be upfront and real
Mathematically correct, collect wreck on the daily
This ain't a Prince project put out on Paisley Park
Deep dark funk to dunk your face in
Fully animated in a time when hip-hop's contaminated
Wit corny niggas talkin' gibberish they make me feverish
I merely pull this lever which
Enables me to unveil tails of Del in action
Smoked to fullest, project my voice like bullets
I deflect you sect. I check the scanner
Damn you're persistent, I stand wit my fist clenched
Tightly around the microphone like a scepter
With rhymes average MC's can't see like a specter
The inspector with the nectar, sharp like a Black and Decker
I twist a nigga neck like chubby checker
Respect the Hieroglyphic insignia
You know it means murda with lyrics unhearda
Stamina, stamina. And wit a new flow to boot
Don't try to execute my patter-ns
I took hella notes while battlin'
Dismantlin' opponents alone
With my trusty verbs leavin' MC's disturbed
Everybody on my block know I rock
To MC's I'm hella cocky
So I keep my rhymes cocked in position
And if you actually listen to what I'm sayin'
You'll see you can't resist 'em
They're succulent and if you don't like them fuck you then
Anybody with taste see it's a delicacy
Not a mere  Hors d'oeuvre or haven't you heard
And it's totally take-out about a million served like that
Absolutely a beauty to crush the shit that's booty
Cuz I figures it's my duty

Do you copy Del? It seems we've lost radio contact
Descend for warp speed so you can recieve transmission""
Each rap is texture-mapped to perfection
A 3-D world for you to step in
I leave MC's stranded on asteroids
Floatin through the void of space
Del the black man, African back again
Crackin windshields, so I can heal your souls
When you feel my flows
A wild beast when I piece together beats like puzzles
MCs feel muzzled like dobermans
Its over when you try to duplicate
And then your tooth'll ache for tryin to sink your teeth in
Meetin your maker, Del the caretaker here to break your life
Away from you 
faker the Tammy Faye Baker
I shake your brain up like 
Quaker Oats
For tryin to memorize my maniacal quotes (nuh-unh)
The funk coats your eardrums, Oaklands where we're from
The deviant, workin feverishly but easily
Eagerly awaiting your arrival
Hide all you cowards
You're powerless I'm live and in technicolor and tumorous
You're humorous, my rhymes are numerous
I'm too elaborate in my habitat
With words that hit your skull like a battle ax (imagine that)
I'm actually destined cause I'm actual perfection
Equals natural selection with rhymes as my secret weapon
This involvement in my newest installment
Is dissolved in the chains on your brains like solvent
I can't call it, all it means is my genes
Comes from supreme beings, ancestors ya can't step ta

Old technology shit, why is this soundin garbage?""
To many fans and not enough artists
Niggas frontin heartless like they packin ultra cartriges
You ain't gonna smoke me, you smoke weed
I've seen some sick characters and they ain't scared a ya
The true soldiers who will unload on your intersect
Not me I'm into 
Tex and Mex
Giant robos and ponos, and road shows
I like to blow dough on the latest, not the status quo though
More pull than yo-yo duncan
Puttin passion in my rappin like a tongue kiss and right on by the hundreds
With no bass the foundation crumbles
Like niggas bumble they whole life over rumbles
Scandals, sure you got hand skills
But unless you gonna be a boxer who's gonna offer
Your hand scrill? (Nobody) I used to program computers
Now I make maneuvers on the mic to screw ya
On the ole, how it goes how the flow for the uninitiated
Plus on the side, get my own life sitiated
You know writin lyrics in between lines
Play some Samurai Spirits, oops
Drop funky like defecation, poop
Leavin ya mute moose, speechless
Niggas blackin out like an eclipse
No defense for your pretense
Which is just a feat to proposal
Towards your disposal
Del flow solo, fully mobilized the wise words
So niggas can get the total
Perception, perfection destined for greatness
Etched in your consciousness, metaphorically monstrous

They're never there for me when I need a little boost
Because of who you are, they can get a little juice
Then they like to seemingly leans up on your shoulders
Otherwise he's steppin on toes gettin over
Flappin his molars talkin 'bout he owe you
And every time he smoke, he don't show you no love
And be the first fool with his lips on the blunt
If he persists to front I'mma commenced to dump
Be careful when you make a little something that's yours
Cause a lot of these predators want yours to be theirs
Or at least own a share just by bein there
I be on some hermit skit, and fools think I'm square now
There's an interesting way to look at it
I look at them as bein fake, the way they took advantage
Speaking on the crooks of the planet, who claim they got game

Don’t Forget,No Need for Alarm ,1993.0,"Don't forget your niggas, my rep gets bigger
And figures on my checks, flex
Like Hercules, when I flirt with ease
Use a lingo that'll bring more.. hoes
Front and center, enter this blissful twist full of fun, for my niggas
Here's another one
You get a hand shake, and take a copy of the Q&A
We're doin' a service, and who are they?
Questions and answers, and we can sure
Capture the spirits in your soul cause the man's pure
And furious cause curiosity killed the cat
Why fill the gat with lead, then leave a nigga dead?
What if you was that nigga?
Don't sweat me, cause if I was that nigga I would pull that trigger
Protect yourself but don't project yourself into trouble
Cause, you'll perish, there is
Some things I never forget, police sweats when we out posted like marionettes
We jet, unless them hands be empty
They lookin' for niggas, yeah? They not allowed to pin me

Don't forget your niggas... (Niggas!)

Don't forget your niggas, even if they low down niggas
Cause I sho' found niggas
Down on they luck, here's a pound, and a buck, and you better not spend it on no booze
Choose what is more important, I'm a nigga who will  shit
Before it starts... we score with heart
Artistic values, and I'll use a portion of the brain other niggas is ignorin'
You're snorin'
What's up my niggas? Hi niggas, I figures
I'm the nigga who can bring a rhythm to your soul
Plain and simple, then pull other tricks out my sleeve and leave unseen
Clean and slicklike
Niggas need to get they shit right, 'fore they step to Hieroglyphics it might
Prove fatal, so move, wait'll I'm done
I use fun and fabrications for your imagination...
Wastin', spillin', blood when I'm illin'
Depressed cause I take it out on others, not the brothers
Just wreckin' ex-ecutives, and I bet you give
Up your cash, when I leave you with the gash in your ass
Cause I had no heart when it started, now I departed and I'm back again, give me ends
'Fore I bust into your office squeezin' triggers
Because you, because you
Cause you forgot us NIGGAS (Niggas!)


Now peep, I new that was large
That nigga used to rap good, now I'm askin' him
Perhaps, could you tell me how you fell off?
Yeah, you was well off... But now the real niggas think you're soft
Cause we beat rhymes, you can't keep up with the times
It seems you have styles combined... From other fools
And you'll discover who'll be a real nigga
You were the man, you supposed to shield niggas!
When you say you will, you don't display your skill
And still, you throw your niggas outdoors
Scores of years ago you was bros
Now you got a little dough
And yeah you tryna play him like a hoe
Well I don't think so, he ain't a puppet
Enough with that shit, take that job
Stuff it
Up your ass, just gimme enough for gas
I'm roughin', I can last, and get my own fuckin' cash
Well that's that, and what do you get for that?
""Ooh, you dirty rat!""
How could you forget the fool that was down witcha in school?

Signature Slogans,Both Sides of the Brain,2000.0,"Del, my main brain function is gang busting
I aim dunking scrumptious gumption despite you assumptions
I like lumping up dumb cuts with abundance
Rhyme reservoirs that glitter like a gun bust (bloaw)
Obnoxious to coppers and fake Hip-Hoppers
They bite my steez and try to doctor my cross-words
For the highest offer I plot the Oxford
Poetical posture that gotcha, like the shocker
Nocturnal burning herbals, playing Turbo Graphics
Federal reserve your cabbage, you don't deserve to have it
Curb your habit, a fictional farce and fairy tales
I know you very well, and rise to the top like Ariel
Periscope's up when I loc' up
Landmine logistics, the digits ain't listed
I flood cupboards with natural disorder
Cause when I hit the doja, I switch over
I sent cobras amongst your rosebuds
No buzz, not even from 500 pounds of Folgers
Go get you a pass, you sniffing the ass
Pay attention in class, cause if you do that
You might...

Get it in focus, didn't you know this
This mission is hopeless, pitiful poets didn't get no wins
My signature slogans splitting ya open
Hittin' the dosha, told you that you'd better listen closer
...Focus your mind

My rhyme quality quantum armed when gone to lunch
And you can come along with us
My syllables savvy; Gravity's entrapped in
Cabins with brain seizures, so pack your aspirin
Burn baby burn your chapped and blackened
Like charcoal but our soul subtracts the saccharin
And cheesy packaging, we be trafficking
The contraband on a plantation after we break in
Nothing can awaken, shaken your mind
With blatant basement bombshells that keep strafing
Have faith in Me and Paul
The weed I freeze the remedial and eat 'em like a Peter Paul
Beat em all fair and square, prepare for static
I'm char-is-matic, from hair to fabric
Avid aviator when I'm facing Vader, with divine sacks
I leave your mind and your spine tapped
Face the music, embrace the true sense
Of pain, when I stomp your brain and leave shoe prints
If you hot, then I'm the coolant
I rule with ironclad mandibles, they trap you in a pencil


When I'm upon the track, it's a common fact, I'm bombing that
Smash it like a pomegranate, better call in management
Tandem mist of cannabis, random sniffs get you rambling
The ambulance will handle that, examine facts
Ferociously, you spoke to me like you close to me
Like you folks with me, who you 'sposed to be?
Next thing I know you'll try to dose my weed
Toast to me, cause I broke the speed barrier
Repairing it is arrogance on your part
Sure start the core operation, it's hard to face him
Cause bars away from an incarceration
I ain't into operations that ain't making me
Cake up cheese, give or take a G
Feel the nature's breeze on my naked knees but for leisure
Do not disturb, I'll kick you keister
Unleash the beast wars, take three-fourths
When I leap forth, I resort to G Force
You better creep soft, watch where your feet walk
Or profile meets chalk by the see-saws
Retard, coincidentally, simply raw
Fill out this entry form
So we can get beyond the nifty song you dissed me on
Now you the new contestant on my truth confessions
Teach the youth a lesson they're not used to getting

Shut your ass up, 'fore I slap the lips off your motherfuckin face
Man, you got a big ass mouth!
You know what?

Fools is hella talkative, saying how I walk and live
Always trying to start the kid, wishin that we all can give
A small interview, just a subterfuge
Wanna hook up with you so they can say 'whatchu do'
Get your own life, live your own legacy
Why you wanna spread my rees, talking 'bout my girls pregnancy
Professor, I guess you never learned your lesson
When you saw me out drinkin at the bar
You said I was sexin this other ho
Chuck D, what a brother know
About my beeswax, runnin off with your feedback
Who I smoked weed with? Who I smoked crack with? (false)
How I sexed every girl you know without no prophylactic
Fool, I'll be in the house and that's it
On the rap tip or studyin, unlike you
You quite new, no game
I understand you a youngster, wanna be hustler
Undercover buster
Can't believe I trusted ya - but that goes to show
How fools fold getting jelly off the dough, yo!

Ain't got no idea where Teren's been
I should take it to pugilism so
I can fuse your vision with some realness
Instead of these fake phony stories you be glorifyin
Don't you know that many more are dyin?
From the fatal disease, called runnin them choppers
In front of females, or on front of the coppers
You only do this shit cause you be wanting your propers
Somebody's gonna get steamed and run up and pop ya
You exercise your choppers really, choo choo choo
You exercise your choppers off some brand new news
Your molars bite, your canines tear, whether it's false or true
You exercise your choppers like some gossipin fool
You know what?
You get your little notices from bumpin your gums
When you should be concentratin on lumpin your sums
Got to show your little ass when company comes
Cause We From The Crew That You Wanna Be From

Same Ol’ Thing,I Wish My Brother George Was Here ,1991.0,"The same ol' thing (All over the world)
The same ol' thing (Got to get wit' it)
The same ol' thing (MCs out there got...)
The same ol' thing (So let me tell ya 'bout it)

MCs keep comin' with the same ol' thing
With the same ol' swing, with the same ol' ending
The same ol' climax 'cause many have no vertebrae
Yo, but D-E-L and Hieroglyphics have to murder a
Fraudulent foe real quick and get them off of our dicks
Show the public that they ass ain't slick
They lack skills, and they can only thrill ya by dance steps
I coulda iced Vanilla but I haven't got the chance yet
But that's okay 'cause he was dissed on Soul Train
He got booed because his rhymes are so lame
He ain't the only one, he's far from it
There's more on Earth and they're all gonna plummet
Like falling stars because a brother's in charge
I'mma stomp mud holes in they ass like they was El DeBarge
Then charge to the front of the class
Suckers everywhere like broken glass, yo
But I'mma keep troopin' through the Meadow with the fellow
Named X and a pillow, to sock the pussy willows
While I get dough as I grow as a rhymer
And they can keep showin' their teeth like Aunt Jemima
It's the same ol' thing...

The same ol' thing (All over the world)
The same ol' thing (Got to get wit' it)
The same ol' thing (MCs out there got...)
The same ol' thing (And it's gettin' kinda ancient)
The same ol' thing (All over the world)
The same ol' thing (Got to get wit' it)
The same ol' thing (MCs out there got...)
The same ol' thing

I'm in your face with force to eliminate monotonous
Braggin' and boastin', so most will end up profitless
'Cause they ain't got a foot to stand on
And I'mma leave the stage bloodier than a tampon
I can't get no rest because of gang of little pests
Will step and try to test me with the same ol' thing
I wish it would stop but more than likely it will not
'Cause too many MCs got the same ol' thing
So I change and rearrange rhyme patterns
Keep ya mind scatterin', occur in solar system
And I still dissed 'em
The ones with the crumbs on they lips
Talkin' about Sucka MCs that don't exist
And I get the gist so don't play me like a imbecile
Thinkin' that ya large, but ya small as a thimble
Plus I get mental over funky tracks
And you still talkin' Sucka MC's? That shit is wack
If I ever dissed an MC it was one with a name
So don't tell me he was one in the same
Because I know better, I flow better than the average Joe
I use my Nubian stick to overthrow
That same ol' thing...

The same ol' thing (All over the world)
The same ol' thing (Got to get wit' it)
The same ol' thing (MCs out there got...)
The same ol' thing (And it's gettin' kinda ancient)
The same ol' thing (All over the world)
The same ol' thing (Got to get wit' it)
The same ol' thing (MCs out there got...)
The same ol' thing

MCs out there got the same ol' thing, got the same ol' game
And trip, some got the same ol' name
Like Rockmaster This, Mighty Kingathat
Damn, who died and left you the Wolfman, Jack?
But the Boogiemen are irregular
Spectacular, Dracula, and plus we're gettin' clever
I never had the urge to ass a tag to my title
And I won't add a (rah) or a (huh) at the end of my recital
Hip hop hibbit
I never say a rhyme like that 'cause I can take my time and give it
Thought
So I went and bought
A pen and pad
Now I'm makin' MCs real mad
Like Young MC goin' out like Sugar Hill
Add a new beat, new rhyme, (huh) bogus still
And even if we are in the same gang it ain't no need
For all MC's to have the same ol' thing...

The same ol' thing (All over the world)
The same ol' thing (Got to get wit' it)
The same ol' thing (MCs out there got...)
The same ol' thing (And it's gettin' mighty ancient)
The same ol' thing (All over the world)
The same ol' thing (Got to get wit' it)
The same ol' thing (MCs out there got...)

Town to Town,Future Development,1997,"They say that nice guys finish last, but I'm the leader
Drinkin liters of Seagrams with the heathens
Misbehaving, break the buds from the shavings
Collectin scratch for my savings before the day ends
Cravings for music, collaborate at a rate
Faster than the speed of sound to go thataway
No replicas, step to us, I guess the job was left to us
To kick the phonics that kept you buzzed
And perkin, workin words, distributin herbs
To niggas livin in 'burbs cause they too petro
To come to the ghetto
Mind you, all we do is find you, wave and gave you a sack
Come back but watch 50, they try to lift me
Off the tracks but we ain't offerin crack, just bomb
No need for alarm or bad karma, but arm yourself
Move in stealth, wealth is accumulated
Pockets are aluminated
I make the shit I think hit even though some assume you hate it
I pass judgment when the fuzz lit, take a shit
Just another skit comin from the pit of Babylon
But powerful like Alvatron
From the Decepticons
Music is magical like a leprechaun
Kept you on point in many different sectors
On Elektra, make you remember Medgar Evers and James Evers
My skills sent from the heavens
I wish they sold Maddog at 7-11
I remember when niggas wore Thriller jackets
And Starter jackets and harder tactics
Had been adopted and most of y'all mocked it
But put a sock in it (* gagging sound *) for a minute
I provide the funk and y'all rock with it
As I spit it, admit it, oh shit

It's Del the Funky Homosapien
Goin from town to town to town and just makin friends
Reach out and shaking hands
With the public and they love it

No technical difficulties or faultiness, you salt me with
That plain-Jane-no-game-insane-to-the-brain
Don't need cocaine fuckin with the A
The A-Pluster plus the A from way back in the day
For mind expansion enhancing thoughts
I'm raw with savagery, the majesty of all in vision
Wait, but isn't this a good way to start?
Developin art to cart scrill to kill Satan
Plans for gettin Daytons are past tense
Stack ends so I won't be a has-been (You know it)
The question you been askin: Is Del that masked man?
Rollin through our cities just rippin major venues
Like Whitney Houston like when I went to Houston
My father is from Texas, so next bust a rhyme for times
I felt it was no hope, but no factors you formulate
Made me foster hatred and made me wanna make it
When I'm in the Bay niggas say (Del, how you doin, man?)
I ain't no rap star that act hard, can't speak
I leak lyrics, freak lyrics, secrete lyrics
From my spirits
Tyranny for all who hear of me
Bomb in a bong, my feet in a thong
On a beach with a biatch named Bonbon
Called her on the Intercong, enter John Owens
Better known as Casual to y'all not knowin
About flowin, cause your rhymes are all stolen
Another dip on the strip cause task force patrollin
But rollin blunts too fat to measure
Mexico's national treasure for pleasure
Resurrect tracks like this from my childhood
Before it was such a wild hood
Knock on wood


My beats are meaty
Let's call a peace treaty
And stick to it
I'm quick to do it, are you?
So much funk you can't kick it with my crew
Other than when it's time to get blue?
(Shame on you)
I want me a girl that's intelligent
Doin shit and ain't too belligerent
Picture it, chillin backyard barbecue
Not trippin off what niggas are to you
Jealousy, well let's see
It's a lot of that in Oakland
It started when niggas started smokin
And snortin hop, fuck pop
I want the melodies
But not the weak topics you are selling me
Del is free of confinements
My mind bendin fragile and frazzled
I choose to stay underground like Fraggles
In battles I'm sure to win
While you smoke bud I drink gin
It sinks in while everyone else act on it
I macked on it but not too far from redrum
Don't push me, I'm not a pussy
I wish we could gather at a function, drink some lager
And just bust hymns of funk and flav
Cause the slaves that are our ancestors
Would feel blessed if we did that
Before we hear rap
Now it's American children syntax
Ever since it been on wax
And that's the facts, believe it, don't mislead it
And don't do the shit if you don't need it
And that's real, you might not be but I am

Your neighbors lose some sleep (I wanna thank you)...""
I wanna thank you

I'll heist your jewels & tolls & leave ya fooled

My ends that I got last year will probably still get resooped
I know yall're sick'n tired of these weakassniggas makin' records
So just check what I delivers
I send shivers down ya spine
I'm incline to bind and put together clever conversation
Cause I'm dope without the leather
Whether or not, my spot is never taken
Or forever breakin' on new rhymers
They flock around, wanna be down & two timers
I will design a flow that will remind ya
Dumbasshoes and a path go
Go to a spot where I know that the grass's sold

Dispose of your flows
The ones that you chose
Don't compare
Where is your other shit?
When I discover it
I'm shovin that shit
Right back in your mouth
And start with another kick
Good riddance
Suds of blood like the Red Sea splashes
When I smash kids
Ashes and cremations
We wait in
The torture chamber
Of course you blame a
Brother like Del for murder
Word up, on a mission
It's in my heart
Rippin fools apart
You dart and dash
But I'll remove your heart fast
With my bare hands
Stashed it into their plans
I'd like to see it pulsate in my palm
Squeeze it, squish it
Eat it with a biscuit
For breakfast
You're next if
You step with
Your bright ideas
I might apply years
Of rhymin
Til the time when
I blind men
With a flash of light
I'll blast you right
In the corneas
I'm warnin ya's
So take heed to that
Before you bleed, in fact
I'm keepin niggas outta my head
Outta my head
Instead
They bled
They dead

Niggas get defeated (defeated!)""
I wanna push and shove
Take off the kid gloves
Tearin the terrorist

Holds a dagger
Stick it in your stomach and drag your
Insides across the ground

At the police station
I'm patient
I won't get you yet
So no sweat
You're no threat
I bet I can belt your brain
When my scalpel felt your brain
You convulsed
No pulse
We lost him
Cost him his life
Phukkin around
It's too easy to buck 'em down
Let 'em drown
Face down in a toilet
Take his brain and boil it
Watchin who I tell cuz they'll spoil it
They might reveal
My anger is real
Keep your lips sealed
Or yo might be the next to keel over
Or Murderous
Refer to us
When you feel the need
To bleed your chicken feed
Yeah, plead for mercy
Before I burst free
I'm blood thirsty
When it comes to who disturbs me
I make your life complicated
Emcees get ground and grated
While they waited
In the lobby
It's my hobby
It'll prob'ly be me
Who sees your knees

Miles to Go,No Need for Alarm ,1993.0,"This is the intro
I dent foes
And bend them and upchuck
Send ya outta luck phukk
That shit is nasty
I blast the mc's who try to sneak past me
I'm dastardly
I scare 'em
Dare 'em to maneuver
I'm smoother
I will prove to all your boys that I do the
Psychotic plot if it's necessary
Yes it's very down pat
Now I'm tellin' brothers brown black lighter
Fight for ya righta
I incite riots if they try that shit that happen in the 60's
I ain'ts the whimpee
I simply flip the whip that holds my flow
So no foes will know
What motivates me
I show no race see
(see) it's higher
Conspiring on mc's who tire me with wackness
Using metaphors breaking backs if it comes to that
Cause I'm the one who raps
Fillin' gaps in the space
Perhaps there's a space for me in the world of rap
Your girl's on my lap
She's on the dilznick
I kill shit
The negative feels the musical sedative
And I'm ahead of them
[Chorus: ""I'm goin' tha extra mile, and I bet you smile cause tha
Texture's wild, yeahh. . .(Repeat X2)""]
I only give a little ittle blurb
If I prefer to confuse
Now were you enthused
Just by the way I play with syllables
And still I do work
Cause I pursue jerks
'til they know I'm berserk
Quick with my quirk like Dirk the Daring
You can spare me the tears I ain't caring
Just preparing for Armageddon
Ya head in
A guillotine
Is sure to thrill a mean
Motivation short erasin', placed in a casket
Drastic
You'll get ya ass kicked being placid
Ask if I rips suddenly
I say what in the hell is you speaking
Neva change my strange
Way that I come about shit
But you doubt it
Wanna dis the D-E then you see me and you shout if
I would come to you and screw you
You new crew
And you got the bitch with the mad voodoo
Over niggas
Because you know the vigor
That I use to abuse hoes
And foes
So get a
Whiff of the splif that I'm puffin'
Ya wanna step to me in the club
But I dubs

Cyberpunks,UnKnown,UnKnown,"""It is the year 2387
Man has relieved an overcrowded Earth
By the establishment of planetary colonies
In other star systems of the milky way galaxy
The most successful of these colonies
Is on Maris, a planet so Earthlike, that many call it Earth 2""
(CHORUS)(2x)
Cyberpunks, MegaDel, 
ultra violences when I adjust
Future phenomenon, you need to try it once
MegaDel Cyberpunk technology such as cyberbots
Check the rhymes I concocked, private stock
While you jock I set a ultra security
For MC intelligents who wanna murder me
It's like the third degree
The way I question my sanity
I work on cybernetics as a form of vanity
To protect my circuitry I stay under the canopy
I send the special ships to finish my fantasy
To become a bionic commando, monitor scandals
Solar panels reflect, energy enters me
MC's energy in the 21st century
Soling temper release, fusable alloys like musical cowboys
Super bomb raps, capable of alien contact
With rhyme pacts, create galactic soundtracks
Profound facts to word classify invoke for several decades
By the C.I.A. or now pedal death codes on the internet
The center's flesh, I smoke a pinner of bless and can't remember next
Transmission control, you better listen to your soul
When your carbon base creatures connects with technology
Brand new species, devoid of ecology
Totally electronic they monitor and follow me
(CHORUS)
Escape the cold flu, still down with kung fu
Back then they hung you, but now they fun chew
I touch the escape key, a blue light envelopes me
Covers me with energy and sucks me in the screen
I met Tron, he said don't let out about the cyber universe
Because you the first human to discover us
Neon lasers with colorful photons
I felt like voltron my hands turned to silver
Probably woulda killed ya, I just lost my sanity
My brain was enhanced with super intelligence
Shoot the elements, we stowed with a charged beam
Victory was our theme, packed more silicon than sardines
Transformed into a plane like 
star screens
Cyberpunk, rockin' the mic with auto targeting
5th element, the strength of six elephants
It was miraculous the way they pashed me in
Equipped with electric grenades
Testin' my phaser, I melted some glaciers, wow this great stuff
Powered with voltage, a technofile armed with explosives
Missiles, a crystalizer
To freeze MC's and then shatter them with super bases
Around relentless pound against the ground
Like an asteroid, a metal bohemive
More than you can dream of, a 
morval team
 of
Both sides of the brain
Transmuted to my physical form to ride the train
My eyes had a neon green glow, I seen foes
Instruments self destruction, made for huntin'
(CHORUS)
Controllin' cyberspace like a girl's private place
With a chassity belt, I has to be felt
Futuristic crucifixing super diction
With computer victims, terminated through the symptoms
To virus', sophisticated and bizaare
Enthrawling, I even serve smart drinks at the bar
Bonzai, mechanical tenticles hard times
For small fry who tried to hog the mic
You saw the light, took all the stripes
Stop the spying theives
That I percieve when my optics turn lime green
In this industrial environment, there's certain requirements
The mental training that helps you see the Leviathon
I'm pilotin' a giant mecha in my private sector
My invisible forcefields of course yields
The inner sanctum, better do the interface
Master programmers create aircrafts that look like dinner plates
The Zentraedi mobbed me
I did concert on their planet for 5 G's
Space the last frontier
Another make you pass on beer, we hellucinagetics with speed

If You Must (LP version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"It's important to practice good hygiene
At least if you wanna run with my team
I'm bout to get into some shit that I've seen
This fool's breath, I mean so bad it'll melt your ice cream
They say don't say nothing if you can't say nice things
Sittin too close to him it burned(?) like my eyes sting
I try to be subtle, hand him a stick of gum
I was a victim of breath on him
Running his yap about what sets he from
Gotta get some gum gotta get him some
He turned it down, his teeth was brown
Excruciating for him and it was a new sensation
I had to ask the dope to pass the soap
Cuz his toe had the sniff of crustaceans
Or bathrooms in a bus station
He had a can of Olde E and some raisins
Amazing... head to toe B.O
He didn't know, used to the fragrance
Just as the days went without bathing
He felt manly and not like a maiden
He had one dread, and fungus
Said he worked on peoples' toilets with plungers
Girls let the guy you were with the tongue ya
So guys take your cue from this num-ba(number)

You gotta wash your ass, if you must
You gotta wash your hair, if you must
You gotta brush your teeth, if you must
Or else you'll be funkyyyyyyyy
Now at class you need total concentration
But there's kids in the back holdin conversations
Crackin on each other, and neither were poster boys
Both of em smell like the type that soap avoids
Coast and Joy, they leave their absence
One's fool's feet smelled like it struck some matchsticks
Brimstone, girls would never bring him home
I was laughin, then his friend raised his tone
And said, ""Bud you rolled all over yourself"" ""yeaaa""
I'll go so deep on your ass, you'll be submerged
Like you need to deal with water cuz you smell like a turd
Wanna cap get some courage, your feet smell lurid
Well look it up
And while you're at it, get a cup
And squeeze the sweat out your sweatshirt and drink it or gargle
You get our vote for most stinkiest
That nigga started thinkin of shit, said I was frail
I said he was stale
Underarms is ripe
Undergarments hype, about to leap out your holy sweats
And we holdin bets, and after this I'm gonna collect
Nigga check, yourself
Respect yourself
And wash your mothafuckin body 'fore your sweatshirt melt
Like radioactive, no lady find you attractive
The funk got you captive
You don't need a map bitch

Del’s Nightmare,Future Development,1997,"Let me tell you a little story about the slave master
Use a whip on your ass so you behave faster
You got chains on your neck, and the man's respect
You'll work all damn day, but you will never see a check
In the field. Cotton you yield. Your skin peels off your back
From the crack of the whip. It won't heal
Ya wish you had a shield cause he wields iron
So when you act up, he smokes ya and keeps firing
And it's tiring. Forget about recreation
One wrong move and it's death you're facing
White motha fuckaz got the ball and chain
On your leg, and in the form of religion on your brain
They say, ""You the devil."" You say, ""Who the devil?!?!""
Some of us was house niggers. Some of us was rebels
Some tried to get along the best they could
And didn't nobody use the phrase, ""It's all good!""
Would you? They got you living like a shrew
They throw you pig lips and chicken gizzards. Then you make a stew
They give us a white Jesus to appease us
We talk among ourselves and hope that nobody sees us
They had our brothers beating us. Called us cretins plus monkeys
They just junkies mistreating us
The master said, ""If you don't whip 'em, you're dead!""
It was fucking with his head, but he beat us instead
And we bled. Red blood flowing like a flood
Then he'd rape your mother. Stick her face in the mud
They were ruthless! If you tried to front, you'd be toothless
Some tried to run even though it seemed useless
Virginity was torn. Soon babies was born that was half white
And now his skin is kind of light
You think you're special, because they let you
Oversee the carnage? But I bet you
Will get hung, even if you stick out your tongue
Cause they pull out the shank and stick it right through your lung
Now it's 96 and white people say, ""Forget it
It's all in the past."" And some even regret it
Cause they think we'll set it. Now my missions to get federal
So I can raise a black family with our true devils
And you know how that goes

The slave master watching over you
Always trying to tell you what the fuck to do!
The slave master watching over you
But ain't nothing gonna stop me and my crew!

This is for you kids trying to get signed
Just a little something you should keep in mind:
The labels are slave masters. Artists are slaves
Don't get too raunchy. They want you to behave
You get signed. You're thinking, ""This is great!""
But wait You never knew what was at stake
Creative control they withhold, you sell your soul
When you sign on the dotted line hoping to go gold
But you'll never see that, not without promotion
The label'll just throw your shit out, and got it floatin'
You think your shit is potent, but ain't nobody buying it
If they ain't never heard of it, ain't nobody trying it
If they ain't never heard of it, 'your record' they murder it
You can complain. But they are not concerned a bit
Cause when they signed you, they thought you'd make a hit
Cause of who you was affiliated with, and all that bullshit
Frustrations. All these rules and regulations
Just so you can have your shit heard by the nation, and be patient
Cause by the time they find a lead release, your shit is ancient
You think they're working your album? You're mistaken
And if you flop, you get dropped
Cause you ain't the star. You didn't go pop
Just straight up hip-hop. Time to get a mop
Cause without no promotion, of course sales drop (damn)
Peep the break down: If tapes cost 10
You'll probably only get to see a dollar in the end
That you cannot spend. Cause your budget gets recouped
So you never get cash unless your record is ""Shoop.""
You better hope you get shows, which will not happen
If you don't have a record that's the main attraction
Even if you sell a million, you'll get burned
Cause they keep half your cash just in case of returns
For a while, you wonder why rappers don't smile
Cause to them, you're not an artist. You're just another file
Another nigga used to make another buck
They don't give a fuck. And if your shit don't blow up, tough
But the star gets both promotion and devotion
From the whole fucking staff. At you, they laugh
The star probably don't know that he the house nigga
Thinking he bigger cause he the, pick of the litter
These labels think backwards
They push the acts that need it the least
So they can get all the money they can when it's released
They take you to a restaurant for a feast
And then expect you to pick up the check?
That's why I give props to niggas who is independent
Cause they make they own money, plus decide how to spend it
Splendid. And let's end it
And don't get offended

In and Out,No Need for Alarm ,1993.0,"Fun, even funner
I'm the gunner sub-machine gun
It don't seem right, that they don't get my theme right
They don't know me
So we move forward
More words & phrases
My style amazes
Come into the scene with the means to rip shit
My brain's power packed with the proper equipment
So step
I come inta the area to bury ya
I compose the flows
Makin' people merrier
Never the less, I sever the flesh
With a razor
Reserve the major beef
I'mma slay ya, hey
You never came across a person like me
I never instigate
First come strike me
Then I'll flip
And rip clothing, and I'm loathing
MCs who front like I don't know things
Uh uh
Check again
I get wreck again
On the down low
Because you sound slow
Retarded MCs get neglected
& check it
Anytime I hafta show a foe
I'mma flex it
Then I exit
With my records & my next shit
Prepared, so be scared
I strike unexpected
I write rhymes in sections
Testin' my slang
I bang MCs with these
& make 'em hang
Dangle, what's ya angle?
When I strangle and choke
I hold Bennedicts by their throat
Until they sing notes like a canary
Fairy, or genies
We slipped out
They never seen me bust his face
I like bass when it hums
And that sums up my properties for the dum-dums
Someone need to check him
Deck him
Slam him
And put him in the bushes
So 'shush' kids
No one needs to know
I'll proceed & go into
And then tell ya what I've been through

""In one ear, right out the other
Go tell ya sister, go tell ya mother
In one ear, right out the other
Go tell ya father, go tell ya brother
In one ear, right out the other.""
I would feel comfortable
If your front would go elsewhere
Or disappear
Hear my specific style that's speaking
Creeking, making noises in the nightime
When I write rhymes
I look out my window
It's a bright day
And I might display my skills in the hills
Or, in a different neighborhood
Cause my flavor could
Be the best, so lets test this
Yes, bitch
I saw you posted at the pool table
I could never talk to you
But now a fool's able
With the best of luck
And, hey, how do you impress a duck?
By pullin' out a wad of bucks
Shucks
I need to stop this
I plop this, played this
I murder MCs
& leave their pens inkless
Do you think this is a twist
A turn, I insist
To burn those foes who haven't learned
To keep they mouths closed
Guiness Stout flows
Through your intestines, when life is depressin'
I built my foundation using patients

Some had to state it...",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-in-and-out-lyrics

And think about it a second
Before I even touch the mic and that's without a suggestion
Start countin your blessings
I'm clownin you peasants who be doubtin my message
Your style's not impressive
I'm using my time wisely, nothing can slide by me
Fools try me then at the end be like ""why me?""
Why not?
I can see your blind spot
Birds try to jock, they can go find the flock
Time is on the clock but not a second to watch
Got a plot synchronized on the dot ready-or-not

Keep it to yourself or your health will be lessened
Depleting like an energy bar cause you be stressin

Now picture it physical evidence gone I'll be acquitted
Gettin funky with the linguistics that's tradition
Infliction of pain on perpetrators, wishin
To slip in my position but nah, good riddance
If you didn't chip in you can't get a bit of this
Deliberate backstabbing that's shit's ridiculous

Yeah bitch I'mma rhyme forever
X marks the spot now go find the treasure
Funk fatality battle me? You catchin a blizzard
I got allergies affected by you wack ass niggas
Let me go and get bread spit hot lead, spread the gospel
Topple you fools that wanna pop so much shit
Fuck it time for me to flush it
Do the people justice rock my production
Hoes be lustin no you can't touch him
Follow his instructions, no he ain't fuckin'
Indestructible walk into the session

I'll enlist him
Work with the system
It's a big country
Ain't nobody's flunky
Be cool, don't lose control
Cause a fool will scold someone else before himself
There ain't no need to be hurt
Proceed to be alert
The seed is in the dirt
When you ain't got nowhere else to look you're gonna find 'em there

Time together
Maybe climb together

Still don't doubt or pout

From wonderin'
Where did ya come from then
Ask your moms to drop the bomb

Makes ya fist tense

He displayed some faulty shit
Wish I woulda caught the bitch
I stuck to talkin shit
Instead of setting off the apocalypse
Out in the O they try to play you like Kermit
Out in the O they'll smoke your ass like sherm sticks
Definitely something to be concerned with
You can't trust these niggas and it's time that I learn this
This nigga that I went to school with
Asked me for five bills, what you gonna do with
That? 'Bout to give you a whole five dollar bill
Of the shit had been real
It wouldn'ta been a big deal
But faultiness strikes, he said
""Let's take a hike up the block
And I'll give you the five out my sock""
I give him two, my homie gave him three
We was both wonderin what the fuck this gonna be
He took us over to a project building
I was bent off Cisco thinkin (* snorting, sneezing *)
He said ""Wait here,"" and I started yellin
He didn't make clear his intentions while he bailin
Del infuriated, lost it, I drew the line, he crossed it
It's time to burn his ass like I was caustic
I was screamin, beamin, this lady came out her apartment
And said, ""Bounce if you're here to start shit
Little boy,"" she was like
""Some shit happened out here last night
Get the fuck out cause it won't be no fight""
This other nigga came out and said, ""Don't shout
Yo money gone, take this if you still wanna pout about
It,"" He opened his hand and I was shocked
In it was a crack rock
I said, ""What the fuck I'm s'posed to do with this, eat it?""
I said, ,""Keep that shit,"" and then the lady said, ""Beat it""
""He told you your money gone, so get your ass on""
I just did it cause I wasn't alone

No power over themselves, blindness
Don't take it as a diss, take it as an act of kindness
We wanna be in front while you fools is behind us
Are you gonna live your whole life with blinders on your eyelids?
Pretty boys fakin like they grinders
(""Dude, that ain't me, dude"")

You bite somebody's style, it's invitin like a child
You cling to it; I hear it, hmmm
It's got a ring to it - if that's your thing do it
At least you claim you ain't down with that hiphop shoobeedoobee
Which is fine cause my click say you booty
You a white kid, your mom said I'm a mooley
Now you talking 'bout pass the doobie and the toolie
Got your raps and your gat pointed at yours truly
Talking 'bout you gonna school me, who me?
Here's a little jewel like a ruby
Since you talkin like you knew me
Playing a role that's straight out a movie
Acting unruly, and your neighbors call SOO-WEEE
To the pigs then they fling you in the brig
Leave gang bangin to the real gat holders
Or real black soldiers who you don't know of
Who don't show love with all you sun and your thun
Cause they know where you from
You from Oakland, you rich and you ain't from the slums
Your pops is a politician
So why bein a criminal is your three wishes
Used up, do what comes naturally
Quit playing a role that don't even have to be
You slippin

""Dude, I ain't slippin, man I'm from the town too
Man I'm from the Oakland hills dude
That's East Oakland, blood. You don't even know, man.""
""Man, you trippin man.""
""I ain't trippin dude
Why you trying to step to me like, you know, you somethin man?""
""Yap, yap, yap, yap.""
""What up? Whatever dude, whatever.""
""All in my ear with that yappin, man. You trippin.""
""I'll keep at it to! Wassup?""
""What!?  You gonna get hard?
What you talkin about fool?""
""Hey, you never know.""
(chorus)
Followers, dick swallowers
No power over themselves, blindness
Don't take it as a diss, take it as an act of kindness
We wanna be in front while you fools is behind us
Are you gonna live your whole life with blinders on your eyelids?

Slave Master,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Let me tell you a little story about the slave master
Use a whip on your ass so you behave faster
You got chains on your neck, and the Man's respect
You'll work all damn day, but you will never see a check
In the field. Cotton you yield. Your skin peels off your back
From the crack of the whip. It won't heal
Ya wish you had a shield cause he wields iron
So when you act up, he smokes ya and keeps firing
And it's tiring
Forget about recreation
One wrong move and it's death you're facing
White motha fuckaz got the ball and chain
On your leg, and in the form of religion on your brain
They say, ""You the devil.""
You say, ""Who the devil?!?!""
Some of us was house niggers. Some of us was rebels
Some tried to get along the best they could
And didn't nobody use the phrase, ""It's all good!""
Would you? They got you living like a shrew
They throw you pig lips and chicken gizzards. Then you make a stew
They give us a white Jesus to appease us
We talk among ourselves and hope nobody sees us
They had our brothers beating us. Called us createns plus monkeys
They just junkies mistreating us
The master said, ""If you don't whip 'em, you're dead!""
It was fucking with his head, but he beat us instead
And we bled
Red blood flowing like a flood
Then he'd rape your mother. Stick her face in the mud
They were ruthless! If you tried to front, you'd be toothless
Some tried to run even though it seemed useless
Virginity was torn. Soon babies was born that was half white
And now his skin is kind of light
You think you're special, because they let you
Oversee the carnage? But I bet you
Will get hung, even if you stick out your tounge
Cause they pull out the shank and stick it right through you're lung
Now it's 96 and white people say, ""Forget it
It's all in the past."" And some even regret it
Cause they think we'll set it
Now my missions to get federal
So I can raise a black family with a true devils
And you know how that goes
(Chorus 2x)
The slave master watching over you
Always trying to tell you what the fuck to do!
The slave master watching over you
But ain't nothing gonna stop me and my crew!
This is for you kids trying to get signed
Just a little something you should keep in mind:
The labels are slave masters. Artists are slaves
Don't get too raunchy. They want you to behave
You get signed. You're thinking, ""This is great!""
But wait You never knew what was at stake
Creative control they withold
You sell your soul when you sign on the dotted line hoping to go gold
But you'll never see that, not without promotion
The label'll just throw your shit out, and got it floatin'
You think your shit is potent, but ain't nobody buying it
If they ain't never heard of it, ain't nobody trying it
If they ain't never heard of it 'your record' they murder it
You can complain. But they are not concerned a bit
Cause when they signed you, they thought you'd make a hit
Cause of who you were affiliated with, and all that bullshit
Frustrations. All these rules and regulations
Just so you can have your shit heard by the nation
And be patient
Cause by the time they find a lead release, your shit is ancient
You think they're working your album? You're mistaken
And if you flop, you get dropped
Cause you ain't the star. You didn't go pop
Just straight up hip-hop. Time to get a mop
Cause without no promotion, of course sales drop
Peep the break down: If tapes cost ($)10
You'll probaably only get to see a dollar in the end
That you cannot spend. Cause your budget gets recouped
So you never get cash unless your record is ""Shoop.""
You better hope you get shows, which will not happen
If you don't have a record that's the main attraction
Even if you sell a million, you'll get burned
Cause they keep half your cash just in case of returns
For a while, you wonder why rappers don't smile
Cause to them, you're not an artist. You're just another file
Another nigga used to make another buck
They don't give a fuck. And if your shit don't blow up, tough
But the star gets both promotion and devotion
From the whole fucking staff. At you, they laugh
The star probably don't know that he the house nigga
Thinking he bigger cause he's the, pick of the litter
These lebels think backwards. They push the acts that need it the least
So they can get all the money they can when it's released
They take you to a restarant for a feast
And then expect you to pck up the check?
That's why I give props to niggas who is independent:
Cause they make they own money, plus decide how to spend it
Splendid.And lets end it
And don't get offended
(Chorus 2x)
The slave master watching over you
Always trying to tell you what the fuck to do
The slave master watching over you
But ain't nothing gonna stop me and my crew

Del
Flexin' the futuristic style
That will devistate minds
As I find more elaborate metaphors
So meditate
Think for a second as I becken
Abstract thoughts brought to the surface
Watch as I burst this
Rhyme flow
I design slow moving tempos so the simple minded foes find my flows
Moving at the speed of light
I need a tight
Sample so I can dismantle your cranium
Play me dumb if you want imbecile
I can pick your brain
Like a grain of sand
In an hour glass when its filled
To capacity Cassidy
Hop-a-long to the song that is strong
I'm the massive bee
With a twelve foot stinger and I wring you're little wet towel
Cause I'm getting foul when I'm meddled with
I settle this
Violence I silence
MC's who continue
When you know you will fail
Slow snail as I salt ya
Then watch ya shrivel up and sizzle cause I'm hard like Gilbralta
You're butter-soft so you can park it out ya little chauffeur
Cause I go for the esaphogus when I choke ya
Broke ya skeletin ya fail again
And I'm the victa
You can pick the time and the place
So you can get a taste of medecin for your medulla cause I school a
Ferris Beulla cuttin class cause your style is butt 'n' ass;
I pass one to A+
And I say hush child
Cause your plush style
Is unstable as a slush pile
You ain't down with the program
You snow man
Me the Homosapien is funky like your toe jam
So damn enlightenin I'm frightenin allota men
Open up your shutters let the sunshine in
Simple Simon rhymin' on the airwaves
So scare slays to the rhythm
So I give 'em more than a fair trade
Verbal blades
Slice humans
To ribbons cause they're fibbin' so you'll be assumin'
That I'm the dopest
I focus on the vibes that I conjure
Clean up the stains in your brain when I launder
Now feast upon
The thoughts like a mental plum
Maybe you might learn something before I'm done
Spit out the pits and hit the flows in the nose
Del lets your sub-conscious be exposed
Where it like a bullet proof vest upon your chest
Even the best hollow tip bullet couldn't make an impression
Cause this lesson
Is invulnerable
Never dwell on the hellish aspects
Have fun until you perish
Cherish your lifetime
This is why I write rhymes
To illuminate the ones with the tight minds
Sign on the dotted line
Spottin fine shelter
Step to me wrong and I'mma belt ya
Eye for an Eye
But you're eye shouldn't cry over spilled milk
Feel guilt when you know you're wrong
Never sing the song like you know it better than anyone else's
Cause that's selfish
Learn to admit mistakes
Just sit and takes a load off your back
Don't this acoustic bass on this track
Pack a wallop
All up in your face cause I'm the bold kid
Check out the illogical styles that I molded
Silly-putty syllables
That still will pull uplifting
The masses the higher plateaus of hip-hop listening
Villain: ""My red, white and blue foe- I have no desire to kill you, not
Now, not when I can make
You suffer all the more by slaying the one you call the Falcon.""

Games Begin,Future Development,1997,"Come on and let the games begin
Cause the games begin when you're coolin with your friends
And the friends to the end that don't pretend
So have fun, have fun, have fun while it lasts

It's time to max, relax, ask anybody
You got off work, you know your boss is a jerk
Whether you a clerk or a rapper like me
We all need to kick back and be carefree
See, no plead-bargainin, no haboring
Negative attitudes when you're out with your dudes
Damn, it feels good when the weekend comes
Done finished the homework, you're out with the bums
Clownin, you're all down in whatever goes
You throw on a tape and hear a nigga kick his flows
Cruise down the strip and pop at some hoes
Y'all still havin fun no matter what scenario you chose
Even on a solo with hoes, take off your clothes
But not without the condoms cause that's ( ? )
Those wake up the next day call your partners
Pitch in four or ten and start the festivities
No fuckin worries when you're livin free of stress
That's why we only smoke bomb, fuck sess
Y'all feel the best when y'all say let's act a fool
Cause it's June and it's cool cause we out of school

Come on and let the games begin
Cause the games begin when you're coolin with your friends
And the friends to the end that don't pretend
So have fun, have fun, have fun while it lasts

Your friends are your friends like no matter what
Other fools get cut from your team
It seems like they dream of gettin next to you
But all they really do is pester you
Cause they marks, always wanna start funk when you with em
Cause when he got beef with a nigga he thinks y'all'll get him
Now he rollin with yo crew, but with no crew
He wouldn't be poppin doodoo
His ass would be through, but now he drug you into it
And yes, all your boys
And now you gotta kill the noise
He destroys the whole vibe by frontin
Tryin to be hard
But he just Napoleon Bonaparte
A little nigga tryin to take command
Thinkin he the man
But fuckin with him y'all'll all kick the can
I can't stand a fake
I kick it with my real niggas come spring break
That's the ones I look out for, never doubt your pals
Fuck them gals and don't ever let em separate you
Your friends ( ? ) when that bitch hates you
And I say

Come on and let the games begin
Cause the games begin when you're coolin with your friends
And the friends to the end that don't pretend
So have fun, have fun, have fun while it lasts

Now when you got business to attend
Take care of that and afterwards fuck with your friends
Don't put shit off till tomorrow
Do it right now 'fore you fuck with your pals
That's the down period, rest and relaxation
At the nigga Plus' house, let's go to Nations
And get fits, when life is the pits
You know I check my friends, make sure they legit
Whether it's freestylin you know we smilin
Niggas pilin up with the gin in a cup
Or a blunt and Olde English so niggas can get fiendish
Playin NBA Jams and just like the beats we slam and dunk
Callin niggas punks but we just poppin junk
Playin dozens, cause we like cousins
And brothers, I wouldn't have it any other way
You know what they say, all work and no play

This fool's breath forments so bad it'll melt your ice cream
They say don't say nothing if you can't say nice things
Sittin' too close and hear my boy like my eye sting
I tired to be subtle, hand him a stick of gum
I was a victim of breath on the
Running his yap about what sets he from
Gotta get some gum, gotta gets him some
He turned it down, his teeth was brown
Excruciating, boring, it was a new sensation
I had to ask the dope to pass the soap
Cuz his toe had the stench of crustaceans
Or bathrooms in the bus station
He had a can of oh he had some raisins
Amazin'
Head to toe BO, he didn't know
Used to the fragrance
Just as the days went without bathin'
He felt manly and not like a maiden
He had one dread and fungus
Said he worked on people's toilets with plungers
Girls thought the guy (music change) we were with the tongue, yo
So guys take your queue from this little number

You gotta wash your hair, if you must
You gotta brush your teeth, if you must

To, to, to wash up

But there's kids in the back holding conversations
Crackin' on each other and neither were poster boys
Both of 'em smelled like the type that soap avoid
Coast enjoyed a leave of absence
One fool's feet smelled like it struck some matchsticks
Brimstone
Girls would never bring him home
I was laughin' and his friend raised his tone and said:
(different voice) Bud, you rolled all over yourself
Yeah, I know some people n your *ss would be submerged
Like you need to do in water cuz you smell like a turd
Want a cap, get some courage your feet smell lurid
But look it up and while you at it get a cup
And squeeze the sweat out your sweatshirt and drink it or gargle
You get our vote for most stinkiest
That n*gga started thinking the shit
Said I was frail, I said he was stale
Under arms is right, undergarments might
Bout the leap out your holy sweats
Then we hold him messin' after this I'm gonna collect
N*gga check yourself, respect yourself
And watch your motherf*ckin' body 'fore your sweatshirt melt
And ready your act of no lady find you attractive
The funk got you captive
You don't need a map, b*tch

While some walk around like gimmie you owe me
Not kidding
I mean totally lost in self denial, full of bologna
So mean, always mad and loathing
Everything surrounding just soaking everybody energy up like protein
Gossiping lots of them don’t even know me
Posing fraudulating whole scenes for the viewing pleasure of those with no things to occupy themselves and keep them growing but y’all know me
I see no need to stifle yo thing especially if we homies

I told her please you chose me

I ain’t buying it

Went from daddy to ignoring me
Went from ignoring me to ordering me
Uhm went from that to trying to throw with me
Now you gotta go, you can hold the streets
And your momma said no, she know more than me
So you can't go home and sleep
And D ain’t giving up dough to freak
And you know that

Mista, twista, get ya
Every single time
And I rhyme like I know
So I flow
With tha gifted tongue
An encryptic brung
New phrases into the mazes
Play this
Two times a day with a dayo
Day, eh eh yo and the daylight come
I plum forgot what a wack rhyme was
Because I buzz like a bee
In the ears of my peers
So they know and I know
We all know dayo-
Day light come and me wanna go home-
Cool
No tool
No Smith and Wesson
Just an opposite
So I can pop a bit
Of shit on the mic when I get on the mic
""p-p-p-p-ping!""
I ricochet a bit on the mic
And I like it-
Just like the Gulf or World War II
D-E-L will C-R-U and sage anyone who
Makes advances when I'm incognito gweedo
Is the answer when I prance up on ya skull like a frito
Finito
But I ain't finished
Till I let the flip side ride
Till the rhythm is diminished
Casual:
I would if I could
But I ain't cause I cain't
Time for me to lay down the law
Who's raw?
You saw the blues from the shoes of the writer
Stronger than a cisco
In ya like a cider
Watery-
Try to win the lottery before you try to slaughter me
Because I'm not the G
To be stepped to
Kept you
On ya tons
As my rep grew
I let through
Negative foes
So you better get flows to counteract what we've done
Proceed one good
Cause I'm armed like a sleeve son
Plead dumb and step back
As I rep
Shop collect
Respect drops
In debt the next prop

Is answer to the gods
And that's when you lost
Keep on losing

And I make backs if you get caught frontin'
Never bought a Newport but I puff a blunt'n

I needs no sugar crisp
To get swift
So what with two syllables exemplifies the gift

Bladders release upon your porch if you don't cease
I respond with minimal distraction
When I see one
Fatter than re-run
So what's happennin'?
It's not where you from
It's just how you come
Correct
Respect the rough neck
Is not gettin' bucked
And tucked into their beds like nighty nighty
Theft of the membrane
None left cause I'm a righty
Fight these-
You'll catch vollies for your follies
And mistakes
I stick fakes wit shanks
So no thanks
Wack shit
Your attemps to rap are innaffectual
Like gettin' butt styles
Like the heart of homosexual
Not for sex
When you rap the intersection
Of damage
Sandwiched knuckles
And what your luck pulls
Bad ones
Catch one or two
Rather a view
A slew for soft ass phonies
Bust your cronies
Try me
You'll catch my Vans in your hinee
That's if my backgrip slips
Though I doubt it
Pout if you want to
Convert me to filey
But I seize more than them candies
Nothing gets by me
So play the tracks
And you'll go out like ""later max""
Next to Tajai cause I kicks the greater stacks
Opio
Ske-beep-boom
Bob your head to this
Mischievous
Soul socidle
Idle chatter never slips
Off the lips
Of this writer
Might not be a greater innovater of the rhyme scheme
My style is the visine
To get your eyes opening
This raggedy andy gets dandy like a lion in the meadow
While the teapots blow off steam like a kettle
You hip to the hop
I kick
I trip the life fantastic
Gettin' into the grooves that'll bend the phonographics
The vandal with the vocals
Making the locals go insane
The regal rhymer speeks substinance for the brain
Get frisky with the phrases as you praise this life divinity
The one of liberated soul
Controls for infinity
Got styles by the square mile
Cat's got a frightened child
Hieroglyphics will uplift the rhythms for the meanwhile
Articulate my lingo as I mingle in my medium of speech
And peace to pop prophets as I piner and teach
A smidgen of religion to the fraudulent
Listen
Pay attention
I'm the master of this convention
Kick the wickity wiley stylee
While you sutterin' just like smilee
Skippin shingles of your shattered dreams
Too bad it seems you try me
The wise and wordy wizard
Pays a visit
To your subconscience
Quest to run the land
Distinguish all the nonsense
Optimistic, stylistic, mystic myth
I'm swift like Mercury
Mercy me
I surely shoot the gift
A-Plus
People call me soup just because I'm livin' fat
People call me nasty: it's because I eat the cat
And I swing a bat to level heads
Leaving devils dead
Never said never
Cause of clever heads
Better dreadlocks
On the top of my crop
Never flaky
If this was a field then Bo Jackson couldn't shake me
Bake me
Betty Crocker's oven isn't hot enough
If you wanna spread the skins
Then I got alot of stuff
Not a bluff
Not a tough guy
Thinkin twice
Why step?
Here's a fly rep
I kept my step ladder
I had a fatter spliff I was hittin' on
Now it's just a smidgen like a pidgeon I be shittin' on
Sittin on a futon...
Slippin' lots of boots on
I'm the type of brotha that ya have to get ya troops on
Oops I'm sorry cause I didn't mean to dis you
I could hook a hoe and make her blow like I was tissue
Mary had a little lamb
Adam got a lot of dough
Need help with your garden?
Scholar got a lotta hoes
Yo-I didn't mean hoes
Yo I meant women
If she got the pool, I got the trunks
Let's go swimming
Dip dip dive
Cause I'm live
Liver then
Five or ten
Of the men
On my jock
You don't stop
Here a pimp
There a pimp
Everywhere a pimp pimp
This A-plus grades the quiz-
So there it is",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-burnt-feat-the-hyrogliphics-remastered-version-lyrics
King of Fighters,Funk Man (The Stimulus Package),2009.0,"{Ladies and gentlemen, rap fans of all ages
Tonight we have a literal state of pandemonium
As Sir DzL, aka 
Joe Higashi
, makes his way to the ring
As you can see
You can almost taste the electricity in the air, ladies and gentlemen}
{The challenger had better live up to the trash
He was talking at the press conference two nights ago
Or it looks like he'll be leaving the ring fingerless
After Higashi's signature scissor kick
Oh, this is gonna be a good one, rap fans}
I'm back with the tiger kick
Joe Higashi, all team activist of spit swivel grip
Crippling blows within editions of flows
It's a gala of gargantuan proportions
The greatest show in stereo
The weary ol' drag you been hearin' is dead
We playin' funk at the burial grounds and it's a merry ol' sound
And a jolly good time when we body fools with rhymes
Smell the burnin' flesh when the words of death
Bring eternal rest or internal stress
Beef or chicken, either way the meat is sickened
Bacteria, we here in your kitchen
Fools hearin' but they clearly don't listen
Until they sittin' in a twister on they way to Oz
And that's when I'mma holla at y'all
'Cause you gon' need the wizard's expertise
If you expect to leave
Sir Di, the midnight savior spittin' my flavor
Gettin' my paper, neighbor
To catch a tiger, you have to try a little harder
I already commandeered you cargo
Sir D-Z, 
the blue meanie
, few see me
A new species like ET
I'm too pretty
I can't let you hit me
I'm the greatest of all time
Sir DzL, King Of Fighters
Bring on your bigmouths, bring on your writers
They gon' be workin' overtime catchin' arthritis
Bring whoever do ya hooks, bring your choirs
Bring on your phony thugs, they all liars
Makes no difference to Di, I'm on fire
Funky with it, go ahead, touch me
I'm beggin' you, come try to rush me
You weak kid, soon as the beat kick
You already in deep shit, may as well eat it
Put your money where your mouth is
In other words, you are what you eat so bon appétit
So long to competition, they can't conquer
Or defeat or compete, I stomp out they teeth
All 32, metaphorically with words I use
Physical? I ain't finna get into that right now
Keepin' on the right route, promote restraint
Power in the pictures you paint
Go ahead, wear your stunnas at night
All the better you don't see me comin' with the right
Then it's the flash of light
From the Polaroid captured right
In your brain, then it's beddie bye
Thought you could chump me like I'm just any guy
Off the street and got comfy
Underestimated, now you on the other extreme
And got me under investigation
To see why Di ain't nothin' to play with
Nathan, no leads
Only thing he gon' see is me punchin' bags
Beats danglin' like cuts and slabs
Joggin' in place doin' rhythm repetitions
That'll have you jaw fall out your face
You got a mouth that's out a shape, you loud and fake
Stick around and wait for me to drown you in poundin' bass
A boomin' system causin' you to listen
Like you in prison
Now you lay down by my feet
Pray the Lord you get up in a week
Sir DzL, King Of Fighters
Bring on your bigmouths, bring on your writers
They gon' be workin' overtime catchin' arthritis
Bring whoever do ya hooks, bring your choirs
Bring on your phony thugs, they all liars
Makes no difference to Di, I'm on fire
Funky with it, go ahead, touch me
I'm beggin' you, come try to rush me
Each fool tryin' to reach through
Is gon' need new fingers when the guillotine sweep through
Tissue and bone with a scissor kick to the dome
Lifted you as if you were floatin', fight officially over
And if it ain't, you gon' wish it was over
As I issue a 
cobra clutch
 shuttin' your motor
Skills down like a computer crash, takin' you to the task
Rhymes ricochetin' all through your ass
The movement is black
Already told you it's been proven with fact
How I do it like a student of rap
Musically adapt to any nuisance or trap
Produced by crackpots
Thinkin' that they have a shot
If they can just put DzL on freeze
But cease
I'm Joe Higashi with flow karate
Wrestling gators is a old hobby
Now I battle cobras and eat poison ivy
Shit, jalapenos on the open highway
Which hit like a meteor eatin' your established mind state
How can I lose? My standards are too high
For fools to view, punchin' my kneecaps
With the weak raps that you so proud of not writin' down
I don't care who like it
Obviously style is not a part of the criteria or they not hearin' it
It's disposable and holds no real substance
So as soon as you step in the ring, it's self destruction
Sir DzL, the championship belt you wanted
I'm meltin', fuck it
Bottoms up, it's just a puddle in a bucket
A pot of slush
Yeah
Fuck the material shit
He can't beat me
He ain't got the spirit for this
Plus he ugly and his mouth too big
But this gon' be nationwide
Publicly publicized
You betta hope I knock you out
So you ain't gotta go through the hostile rounds
My tiger kick'll make your eyeballs flip
My hurricane uppercut'll send you to Oz
And while you there, you can ask the wizard
If he can give you a job
They call me Joe Higashi
You can catch my flow on 
Hitachi
Wide screen, you gon' see how I lean with it
And roll with it
Ol' nigga, they gon' be mad
Oh, it's over that quick? I bought 4 tickets
So I'm gonna give you the whoopin'
You been sayin' I couldn't
Soon as they strike the bell
You gon' lose all sight and smell
You already deaf 'cause your music sucks
So only thing left is your sense of touch
No, sucker, you lost your sense of taste long ago
And I can tell at that ugly ass getup you wore to the show
I'm too pretty, I can't let you hit me
I'm the greatest of all time",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-king-of-fighters-lyrics
The Land of Funk,Funk Man (The Stimulus Package),2009,"We off to the land of funk
Where you can damn near do anything you want
But take it easy, don't splurge the funk
You got the urge to funk, you gotta make it last
It's a stone gas, I'm the sworn protector of the nectar
I got the juice to get you in the sector
Right on, right here
Come on, let's go while we in the clear
I triumph over chumps and turkeys
And obvious squares who work hard to try to jerk me
First see self then others, be translucent
D did it, maybe they can't do it
Wastin' some good funk, gimme that shit
I'm taxin' you, bitch, at 75%
Next time, keep it like you want it
Instead of just wipin' your ass with it
And then you feel haunted when it's gone
In a song, I define the whole parameter, draw the diameter
Cross the county line, now you're found behind funk frontiers
You punk Negros don't want none here
Au contrair, one snare get my flow beyond air
Land, sea, water and fire to the ether world or deeper still
With a peek through the veil
Frolic with the knowledge that the slumpasaurus exists
Just twist your knob to funk and get a whiff
Smell that, inhale that, it's in the foliage
I'm showin' you the way 'cause lots of fools don't be knowin' this, jeah
{Okay, now you gotta get ready for this part
(What part?)
This one part here, now it start takin' you into this, like ill twist, dig it?
(Okay, okay, I dig)
Okay we gone, keep movin' through right here
(It's, it's creepy)
{Quit whinin', we almost there, Foo
(This is weird, I feel strange)
You're supposed to dig it, just a bar maybe left
Okay, okay, jump, here it is, let's go
Who are you? We don't know who you are
Who told you 'bout our scene? You better start talkin' fast
Don't make no sudden moves, we aimin' our funk at you
I know you must be spies for the barbarians from outside
We're going to funk with you, too late, sucker
We off to the land of funk
Where you can damn near do anything you want
But take it easy, don't splurge the funk
You got the urge to funk, you gotta make it last
It's a stone gas, I'm the sworn protector of the nectar
I got the juice to get you in the sector
Right on, right here
Come on, let's go while we in the clear
What a predicament, you gone and slipped up
In a simple mix up but get stuck in the funk
And we gotta funk you up one time
And you gonna tell us what the funk be on your mind
Outside jive jesters always question the healing properties of funk
But wanna still walk with a chunk
You must be dumb to think you gettin' away scot-free
I got the lock and key
I preserve the funk for future generations
Let 'em know it's the nucleus of new sensations
Best to know where you come from
'Cause you may have to go back, Kojack
But now you didn't know that
I know you need a hearing aid
Here, take a face full of funk and you can clearly taste
The difference in a taste test with the fake mess
Perpetrating musical skill
Got people so confused due to overkill
I'm a little older still, I got a secret
Funk keep me beneath the feces
Underground, on some deep shit
Stress free on the case and then I beat it
Without the sequined glove, peep the love
In each base throb, I take my job
Serious but it's fun to funk
I only came to give you what you want
Even if you don't know that you want it yet
You already peeped game, you just ain't applied it
A-plus my guidance counselor, not my sidekick
Provided a new form of funk that'll pry open your eyelids
Compound 7, now try this special ingredient
But don't be greedy, bitch
Or we gon' funk you up and that's immediate
All rise, fall in line
Everybody chime in on time
Funk is continuous, funkin' is a function
I will honor the the funk
The funk is fragile, handle the funk with care
It's dynamite, it's outta sight
We interplanetary funkin'
Light years away from squares and turkeys
Funk is a form of communication
Funk is power self generated
Funk'll keep the lights on
P, G and E ain't got nothin' on D
P, G and E ain't got nothin' on D
Okay, we funkin', willin' and able
To funk in the world wide funk federation

Remains / Don’t speak upon my acts and ways / When your dumb
Ass can’t hack half the pace / Huh you a public speaker / Can’t
Say shit to you without it leaking / A meeting of the minds /You
Like to sling mud till the enemy is blind / Huh, you got the worse
Cavities spreading peoples business like you eat dirt sandwiches

Down, I’ll tell you
Del will do that and mo’ but if you not sure homeboy, let me tell
You
You know you phony / Talking about me when you know the story
/ Conversation ancient territory / You at a loss of words whenever
Thoughts is heard / It isn’t true seeing something you thought you
Heard / You need to concentrate just to drop a turd / Tell the other
Half of your body / To wipe the other ass cheek after you potty /
You masking probably / I probably did this and that you never
Saw me / Try mastering your ABC’s and you can graduate
Kindergarten while you’re in your teens / Ha, ha, ha, now you
Wilding in the streets / Lying about niggas so now you in a beef /
We allowin’ you to eat / So chill cause you can’t eat without your

That I be saying / But nah, you can speak for yourself / And 80
Others that you seeking to tell / Everything about can’t wait to
Bring it out, cause it’ll sting your mouth / But have a mind of your
Own / Don’t give away pieces to others / Or you gonna to find
Yourself in shit that’s deeper than cover / The station you
Listening on is misinformed / You think you getting warm on a
Distant farm / The shit that you spit is wrong, its fabrication / You
Have a fascination for inaccurate data / You don’t need a head
Just a hand in the rotator / Yeah, that’s a fact, its a fact that it’s
Made up

Bubble Pop,Eleventh Hour,2008.0,"This goes out to my peoples who I love a lot
Del with another hot joint named ""Bubble Pop ""
It's just me commentating
On helium heads who be hating, I'm deflating
Building a rep from game innovation
Still in effect they feel penetration
Peeling them back like a tall seal in a crack
Mind state kind of militant black
So, I'm willing to back whatever I say with acts
While suckas play favorites or play the back
Lick ass for a scheme to get past go
But I'ma let them stroll down the golden road
And you know they hate it when they find out
The bricks is gold and plated
I told you ancient ass niggas
You can't even hold your weight in proportion
And wait, there's more son
Cause niggas really don't care if you a thug they or not
This is Del and the jam is the ""Bubble Pop""
(Chorus)
Why do you think that you are all that? Cause you ain't
Why do you think that you are all that? Cause you ain't
Why do you think that you are all that? Cause you ain't, motherfucka
Yeah that's the way is goes
Diesel from the the land of the Raiders holmes
You played yourself trying to fade the Del
Fonica any lyric that you comment on
Cause niggas will say damn, you kinda dumb
I'm too sly and cunning 100 miles and running
On diesel power So see you cowards
I'm pleasing thousands but you ain't leaving housing
Stop the evil frowning
Ask your people to teach you countenance
While I create beats to keep you bouncing
With aftershocks that eat through mountains
Since the 70's my pedigree get cheddar cheese
When I used to read Jets and Ebony's
I bet I reach even the hardest g's
Cause my artistry ain't to hard to see
Stay far from me D love the bop
D-Bo wanna see your bubble pop
(Chorus)
Why do you think that you are all that? You ain't
Why do you think that you are all that? You ain't
Why do you think that you are all that? You ain't, motherfucka
Yeah, I go coo coo for afro puffs
In blue jeans with a massive ass be stuffed
I come to see lovely honey's that's what's up
Not you money hungry hoes who be fast as fuck
You're ass is stuck in la la land
The next morning talking about how dry I am
Tell people I'm mean, damn right I am
But what you like so bad is that I'm like your dad
A hoe will compromise
Themselves for pleasures they want at the time
Do anything for anybody
Now you tell me who's really sorry
You used to have an appealing body
Till you let niggas ride the wheels off the trolley
You probably feel that you're still not a harlot
You see me and then you feel all retarded
Hoes will sell your love for knots
A dub what, get yo bubble popped, bitch

Why do you think that you are all that? You ain't (Repeat 4x)

Hold Your Hand,Eleventh Hour,2008.0,"Full of cobras, yolla, dosia stands
Soldiers roll as hoes come to hold your hand
What they told ya is bogus, motive scams
Payola for motorolas and coco plants
Ask the bitch why you attracted to a older man
If you play you better know your hand
They be po-po fans, loco in the cabeza
Possessive, no questions
Hoe sexes for yo necklace
Self esteem low, pimps get the green dough
Extreme show of gratitude for slapping you
I’ma rapper with actual facts for you
Look at that, that’s what crack will do, zappin fools
Make the most attractive boo turn transient
Lost in the ambience pantiless, scantily dressed
She like give me a kiss, for pimps
With a pantry of flesh for your cash but it can’t be a check

Niggas be so damn slow man, I told them man
No one’s gonna hold your hand
I don’t know why niggas be so damn slow man
I told them man
No one’s gonna hold your hand
I don’t why niggas be so damn slow man, I told them man
No one’s gonna hold yo hand
I don’t know why niggas be so damn slow man
I ain’t mesmerized by a pleasure promise with lies
It won’t twist my brain if a bitch complain
I’ma analyze wisely the situations
See if shit you saying is warranted
If so, I’ll more than give my all to correct any flaws
But if you in denial, bye hoe
I can’t hold your hand, you’re too old for that
I don’t know them cats, should I order straps?
She’ll be blowing sacks
But you owe’m scratch and it's extra weed
And niggas trying to threaten me
Why they sweating me?
I even let them eat, now they wanna catch me sleep
Fat chance, now my hands is holding
Ammo loaded slamming voltage to shock
Einstein's when the fine line is crossed
A blind mind with thoughts too real to concoct

Transportation to your ego / Skribble it till you skitzo or whatever /
I pop a tissue soft, keep ahead of the weather / Magic mountain
Got my head right / Step light, pop pure not a pesticide in sight /
Certified organic like I’m melanin right / You panic in a scurry /
Drop dead from the scurvy / Now I’m looking at somebody with
Grief / With omega threes and sixes,nines can’t divide we / Del do

With my own words send you further backwards/ Tractor beams
Catcha backhand the pastor / That’s blasphemous well who the
Hell asked you / Mecca’s whole directive is to hand down the
Chapter / I’m flying off the rafters / Silencers and magnums /No
Not handguns markers for taggin / Barnstorming your coordinates
Like dragons / Fuck who your fam is / They famish from famine / I
Love to see that / I’m off the meat rack / I kick my feet back and
Listen to the beat slap / Mecca got your teeth wrapped around her
Kneecap / Trying to beat that / Rocks beat scissors, scissors
Beats paper, paper beat rock / We got you in the box, like a fiend
In detox / Rebelling against the empire like the Ewoks
Mecca
I got them under the lights to drop heat / That night she quietly
Stole the great ease and the crowd was pleased / Still reeling
From the shock we brought / Preserve love for the art / Poured
Love from the heart / Eyes stole in the shocked crowd
Del
You know our plot ties in with the rockslide / Stopping Apartheid /
Freedom will reign in the brain with unity / Funk will flow through
The veins / Then bring the change and arrange this passing for
Forever raising the bar / Praising Allah first / Hit you with a raw
Verse doing yard work / Seeing how it all works / The time has
Come for the rising sun / Don’t look any further / Cause I’m the
One, and we the 2 / I got you tight as what / You got me?

Mecca - Yes, I got you tight as what, you got me?
Del - Yo, I got you tight as what, you got me?
Mecca - Yes, I got you tight as what, you got me?

Crazy Del Song; Operator,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Artist: Del the Funky Homosapien
Album: Hiero Oldies Vol. 1
Song: Crazy Del Song; Operator
(Scratching, random dialogue)
I seek souls like mines
So my mind finds inner peace
And then a beast
Could never devour
My powers arrive
From survivors of this holocaust
Please be hopeful
Never thinkin' all is lost
In my sector
Specter
Slidin'
Collidin' with my lifestyle
So I fight while they threaten me
Sweatin' me -
Well I'm quite mild
The world makes me gnarly
But an introvert not hardly
I deal with it
I feel a bit
Under the weather
I need to pull my pieces back together
Fallin' apart, stallin' a heart of sincerity
Since there will be another stoplight
And its not right
So I might go insane of this brain
Of mine
Maintain a line that has been tame
Before the tempest
I'm looking to my better interests
I never tried to post or tried to impress
Anyone
So why do I got to suffer
Every single day it seems the way of the world is rougher
And then you wonder why I love to hallucinate
Because I never ever thought I would get used to hate
So I imbedded my time within my mind
And rhymin'
Was the only way I kept from bein' confined
To quarters
Sure there's good times and bad
But the bad time's are overwhelming
And how the hell things
Get out of hand I ask you
You have to give an answer;
Eating at my brain like it was cancer
Worryin'
Hurryin'
My thought processes
I got offices
Imbedded in my skull
A million secretaries actin' scary
When they type 200 words per minute
It just occurred to me I'm in it
Cause I'm the boss
The head honcho
At least to this mutiny
The whole idea is cute to me
So I entertain it
And let my brain get
Deeper and deeper
Until it vibrates like a beeper
And I can't maintain it
So what's the verdict?
It's D.E.L. the visionary and I come with the absurd shit

If I had not one friend I would be gooooone
Way in outer space singin' one sooooong:
'Zippety doo dah, zippety day
My oh my what a wonderful day
When my mind's dusted'
Thrusted
Out beyond the stars, I'm the satellite
Transmittin, fit in situations that'll rattle tikes -
Scare 'em
Dare 'em to go farther
So then I go father
Burnin' my brain out with mental lava
Scalding
All things
Rearrange so I never socialize
When you feel my eyes
The dilated pupils
I violated scruples
Cause I told myself I'd never do it again
But now I grin
Laugh on the inside
Men tried to strap me
In a straight jacket
When I laugh and I'm happy
For two hours straight
These powers hate me
And they make me wanna cower
But lately I've been feeling like a tower
Tall and sturdy
Wordy, though I never say a word
Cause when I say a word
Before it's like they never heard
Nothing ever changes except within my cerebellum
So I'll never tell 'em
Never tell 'em
Never tell 'em
I'll tell it to my soul over and over
Even though I'm locked within a room with padded walls
I'm never sober
Inspections
Injections
Keep me confined
To my inner thoughts
And this is how I lost my mind",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-crazy-del-song-operator-lyrics
Raw Sewage,Eleventh Hour,2008.0,"Salutations, now you're facing
A real nigga D-E-L , I don't feel bigger
Up here on stage man, i keep it real witcha
I'm here to entertain ya'll, let's play ball
I stay raw as coke; flawless flows
A novice can't recall why his jaw is broke
Trying to borrow quotes
That's his problem folks; we all adults
Let's see how long he floats
Against the barrage of assaults dislodge his throat
Send death charges to carve his boat
In the cart to Oakland to all my folks
Del apart from most
He hard with jokes
Target scoped and I don't care how far he go
And the bitch is a party ho
Ain't hardly no debutante she give head for ones
You said I read you wrong and your head get stomped
(Zac Hendrix cuts)

Yo, D that stands for dangerous
Never rearrange my stuff to sell units
Niggas do it then you can't come back again
Del is busy mastering all the styles of black music
Cause I'm attracted to it
Then add rap to it through hip hop movement
Get ya groovin' spit raw sewage
Miss ya'll foolish hoes
Live my life on cruise control
Stay level headed
Plus, I got the devil's legend
So, I'm scopin' the scene
Like metal detection, dental infection
Alized erection keep shitting perspective
So, I don't misinterpret a word sent to my auditory canal
My memory works like storing a file
Always supporting my pals
And that's more important than thousands of dollars
Or drowning in sorrow if I'm around tomorrow
There's a chance to advance
To the spot that I feel is proper to stop at
Examine my work understand I how I work
Make sure my structure's solid
Which is up to knowledge, education
Charlatan's have no patience, show irrational behavior
Getting trapped with paper and thats the danger",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-raw-sewage-lyrics
Funk ’Em,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I'm looking at the clock on the wall
And the time's not pausing or stopping at all
I ain't trying to be pompous at all
When I say that my goals I can accomplish 'em all
Sometimes I gotta walk through the fog
The fog representing those who want you to fall
My success might make them feel small
Saying that its real far that ain't real at all
Little by little it'll build a foundation
Tied and bound together by sound basics
So Del's never found walking 'round hatin'
That would be a waste of time
While I'm watching others make it
I ain't in a rush for no dollars
I'm doing this to deliver ya'll a dope product
But always dudes who don't believe
Talking bout its not supposed to be

Mutha funk 'em
Just to see that look on they face
Funk 'em just to see the look on they face (x4)
They call me the funky homosapien
Cause I walk around with zero patience in
The whole earth's surface, population
Cause a lot of these cats won't stop the hating
One of my homies had dreams of doing what he do
But his folks said he couldn't do it
Took it as a joke told him that it's stupid
It got to my man now he through with it
Yo, I will be the one that will give support
Cause everybody got somethin' that they livin' for
I told em tell those fools that it isn't yours
And what you got to show for it sitting on the corner?
Constructive criticism, I'm all for it
But hateful statements are not important

If I feel the funk, I'm funking em back
A lot of cats feel that its nothing to rap
Production is nothin' but stuff from the past
Well here's a little somethin' to get in that ass
What I do is a continuation
Of all the great music that blacks was making
Always goes to what say is nathan
Turn right around with an adaptation
Silly, we can recognize the real from faking
Robots won't stop we gon' make it
Next time someone says your dreams are balderdash
Say you got somethin' for they ass
And when it all unfold in fact
Just remember I told you that",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-funk-em-lyrics

Choppers / Don’t act like it’s a game, nigga ask yo poppa / Yo D

Flip just like laredos / The blip cannot locate the flow sick with
Conversational / Motivational mantras thats undebatable / But on

And I know they don’t approve of my ability to bend’em them with
Hostility intended / When handgun’s extended they like damn son
Ripped it / Like quite wicked like getting kicked in the testicular /
Blow to the senses, hitting harder than vehicular manslaughter /

But if one of y'all feel it
I'm chillin'
Dzl. Do it
That's what it is
Nothing big
Get back
Whatever you give
I'm better with this
Young wiz
How my tongue spit
But I let the bums live
Let 'em scrounge
Rebound
Whatever fall down
When I ain't around
Out painting the town
Making the rounds
Haters your loud
Mouth will get you straight beat down
Making the street to where brothers can't even eat now;
That's a cheap foul
My secret vow
Is to beat the style
Into the hard heads who aren't impressed
Who you know come hard as this?
But hard to hit
You relegated to the bargain bin
What parts of this
Game you don't seem to get?
Don't even sweat
We could go through the alphabet
Z through A
Till it's deeply engraved
And maybe you could even get paid
But you don't hear me though

Got game from Ice Cube
But really he's a nice dude
Thanks to sir Jinx
Cuz he the one who had the right tools
To light the fuse
When I took the mike and went kaBOOM!
Duck down
Structures crumble to the ground
When I touch down
Ain't much cluckers could say now
Rap is my playground
Straight from the bay
My sound represents every color from beige to brown
It's weighted down
So it's hard to snatch
You carbon copy cats is barred from rap
Guard your hat
'cause there she blows
When my nefarious flows
Go where music rarely goes
Stereo
Balance both sides of the fence
Pretty much on as live as it gets
When I'm in the midst
Dzl
You don't deserve
Nothing less than my
Potent words
Read it on paper so you
Know for sure
No BS you see I got it sewn like a seamstress
You typical fool
This is old news
You already know
You got that when you rolled through
Shut up!
Learn how to learn before you start trying to take terms, sucka!
You diamond head sucker, you

I'm building, I'm Dzl
I drill it in your grill
Till you feel it
Appealing
To the realists in society
It feel like it's one out of a million
But if one of y'all feel it
I'm chillin'
Swerving through the bay with the top down
Keep the urban view
It take a bit of courage to avoid the holes
Employ your goals
'cause lost souls talk monkey wrenches
When you're comfy sitting
Humpty Dumpty didn't
So he cracked up;
Couldn't quite get it
Back together he was backed up
Couldn't get on top of his business
That was piled up
And the miserable
The ones who did it the dude
Just smile like ""Isn't he cute?""
Watch your step
'cause they showed out to cross your rep
That's game
And it won't cost you zip

I'm checkin' under my underarms
Lemme take a good whiff, lemme see if I stank
I don't need deodorant
In the mode, I spit, I'm the global event
Told them this but they don't know when to quit
So I blow 'em to bits, smell
It's the African funk, fresh from the motherland
Better than the other brands on the other hand
You be the judge, tell me how you feel about it
I got a buzz, it is what it is and it do what it does

No, you ain't, shut up
D, please tell me the reason why
You know I can't even lie, I gotta habit, I need my fix
Please assist me in this mix up, please, please
Okay, slow down, start from the beginning
Well, Del, I know you been peeping game and how it unfold
You understand how this dumb old record industry
Pimp artists for platinum
They don't want gold, so continue
Well, we the listeners feel
That this shit is really outta bounds
How that sound? They think we sheep
And put out the weakest mothersuckers with a beat
I smell, I peep, okay, I'm findin' for the crack
You need to bring it back
It's good as done, stick your nose in this
No, Holmes, go ahead, get a bigger whiff
Damn, that's ridiculous
What kind is that? I call it primal rap
Take the funk then apply it to tracks
Not like these hip hop versions of Spinal Tap
They caricatures, beware of the curse, what curse?
Man you know the spell that they put you under
You won't be able to smell, it's sorta like sportin' a halo in hell
Feelin' out of place and your halo melt
You can cop some of this while they on sale
Directly from me, not Rapidshare links
Funk is everywhere but this is a rare thing
Okay, that's what's up, I'm 'bout to tell fools
Nobody do it like Del do
What's that?
Nobody do it like Del do
Nobody do it like Del do
I need a hearing aid

You're smellin' yourself
I get down so far that I'm musty and funky
And that's good luck that'll come my way
So don't trip while I take a whiff and get
High off my own supply
Oops, I went against rule number one
But if I'm the dope in question I know
When to measure out the accurate dosage of flows
To kick so none of these posers get their chosen pick
I walk around with a odor and scent
Let the funk ferment, so burn the incense
But it doesn't matter if you can't stand it
Funk spread all over the planet expanding
Make the globe move 'cause you know you gotta hustle
Life is too funky to fake it, hustle
Gotta put twice the effort just to make it, hustle
People want the real, no imitation
And most you cats is mediocre
Your raps be insulting the culture
And where do we go from here?

Follow your nose because the nose always knows
Follow your nose because the nose always knows

He about to get tazered, probably hustling about peddling his struggle rap
Hoping that I'm a buddy and I don't twist his cap
If you act like a bitch then you a bitch in fact
Sir Dzl, I ain't tripping, you know it's a wrap
 beat down the web master
Acting like he cosigning this dead bastard
I want answers, boy, you better have some
That's what I told him with my clutches as I slapped him
""I don't know what you talking about"", he flabbergasted
Certain ways about him, man, I just know I had to bash him
You like sitting back collecting off of other's work
He said, ""nah, you got it wrong, I'm all for in the service""
Yeah, you service yourself like masturbation
So all the vicious acts of nature shall remain nameless

Take me to your leader, I wanna see him x8
This the part when we wild out x3

Now with little control he held hostage
Wondering how high he'd be accosted
With the rampage, damn, ain't no answers yet?
You better get to yapping, yeah, his as was pet
Before he was acting like the gang God
A swine who gank, that's his day job
You take trust and freak it 'til none remains
You've been handling the shorties wrapped up in this game
Pretty soon he had an entourage
They running around with hopes, but doing his job
He kicking back thinking that he Russell Simmons
Taking money off the top, yeah, I peeped them skimmin'
Wrecking the upside, but let them see
I'mma let this stretch as far as his greed
Pulled a hater move, that was blatant
Thinking I won't do shit, but now his ass is taped up

Okay, Mr.Smartass, we gon' see what's so goddamn funny, okay? ""Please.. I don't know"". Man, you making me wanna smoke your ass, nigga. I think you need some more of this.

So glossy, ain't no wrinkles
Make chucks maneuver quick, but they think slow
Sir Dzl, customers putting down
When I knock the structure over with the ruckus
Funks the order of the show, my pleasure
Apply pressure, collect dollars for the effort
I kick the stuff that matters with no slack
Hitting punks with twice the steel  format
I'm bad, but terrific
That's why I keep shitting on my funk exhibition
Please brothers with quality entertainment
Straight from the nuggets, you gon' love the innovation

Cool in demand, stay busy, I love the buzz
Fools with the hokey pokey rhymes in their songs
I ain't hating, but my matrix be a step beyond
Dips quiet like avoiding the scene
While stars hit the news flash doing stupid things
Stay in tune with these, see what the future brings
Blast and zap and sting all underlings
And tow these flows, oh I'm gonna OD
Overkill road and skill, they can't coach me
Kick the slick talking, walk with a pitchfork

The Pearly Gates

Flashlights report the lies
Just like life flash before your eyes
Touch right
Through to the soul
Illusions exposed
Right here on a reel
In the theater of real occurence
Your in a box with the top popped open
Like the soldiers in a trojan
Unexpected
One direction
Can't go both ways

Every known play in your soundtrack
Is based around fact
How you get down and act
The end of the cinema
Into the darkness
The usher escort ya to ya fortune
Morphin' into the final solution
Might be gruesome

Your vision gets clear and translucent
Witnessing your own video revolution


IPictures moving fast
Quicktime
Format more than I ask
The big time
Transmit the past
And it's a glance
Here on a reel in the theater of real appearance
I'm in a place where the space makes
Way for wars like Obi-Wan and Vader
Play for a private screening
I've been dreaming
That's what my mind thinks
All my hygiene's broadcasted
It's trapped with my issues
And whatever script I choose
Sound is magnified, amplified
Forcing the subject discovering a new adjustment
Something for my understanding
It might be expanding
Depending on the programming
I spot my ways of abandon
Witnessing my own parade on the planet",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-video-tapez-lyrics

Really don't make no sense to me (You don't know nothing!)
The way that you act and misbehave
Really don't make no sense to me (And you think you ?)
The way you front and perpetrate
Really don't make no sense to me (And why you stay frontin')
You act like a bitch and instigate
And it don't make no sense to me (You don't want nothing!)

I just don't understand it
I sit and try to figure it out
Why you got such a belligerent mouth
You like a pigeon that sit in the house
Waiting for a monthly check
Talking about she want respect
You can't get none, when you playing the victim
Self-crucifixion
My vision will play out as it was intended
I give a fuck about, who offended!
You should be goody-goody
It could be worse than that
When you launch your personal attacks
Take your sambo off when you greet me
You ten feet beneath me
Thinking you gonna impeach me
Then wave the white flag
The treaty will never get signed
Your twisted mind ain't really as sick as mine
My X-factor
Stress hackers trying to get passed it
Blast it!
Confounded by my terrorist announcements
Drown 'em in a lake of tears
Take their fears and humanize them
Brutalize them, do the right thing
Quit acting like you the mic king
Or get hit by the verbal Viking
Hurling lightning
Serving ice cream
To fiends is pure excitement


I'm the courageous cadet
Penetrating your set
With the ways of a vet
Reign of the tech-nique
It's bleak for pipsqueaks
From here to Mozambique
They know that's deep
With flows that freak syllables
Like a silly ho, with no game
Take over your whole brain
No pain, no gain
So you gonna suffer fucking with the cadence crusher
You hate to love it, but you love to hate it
Wanna see me underrated forever
It's better if I get no cheddar, for you!
But it's bad for me
You download my whole discography and never bought a CD
Feeling froggishly, your jaw get beat
With a battle ram
With the speed and the force of an avalanche
What Del do, surely overwhelm you
When I'm at the helm the realm is Bellevue
You're like Scooby Doo in World War II
The mystery is solved
To get to see it all
Awesome!

Maybe or maybe not
What the Boogieman got in store, who knows?
I know, wouldn't you like to know?
Stick around, you might learn something inside the show

Dz, bet you when I strike King Kong bleed
Cut the sway and wear my heart on each sleeve
Evacuating move with swift sleepness
While these other bozos hit you with the cheapest
I'm nothing similar, of course y'all know that
So charge from the styles, your earthquakes be my throwbacks
Mercy, boy, don't cross me
I'm here to make you boogie on down, stop being bossy
But you get accosted, tossed up like a hoe
You flossing with your whole paycheck like a doe doe
Understand the fade, you could tweet those
Process burn, you learn as the beat goes
I throw a flash tank, gas it with no shame
Your whole brain took over with gold game

It's the Boogieman, peep all the goodies I have
It's the Boogieman, fools wanna boogie, go 
Maybe or maybe not
What the Boogieman got in store, who knows?

Wouldn't you like to know, huh? You big mouth bitches out here, you think you don't fear nothing. Come on, man, be real. Boogieman'll get your ass especially. You stupid ass bitches

Form your investigation under your bed
Behind the covers you'll open up the covers
Daytime comes, it's time to boat
Can't let you nosy fools find me, time to go
The Boogieman been misinterpreted for centuries
Talk about me like a dog with a fictional speech
I'm something which you will need to put the blame on, hang on
I'm not finished, I say shame on fools who wanna make up fictitious characters
To make their children go to bed, it's so hilarious
Somewhere between the Candy Man and Freddy Kruger
But the Boogieman is the OG, you always use him
On a 5 year old, won't mind, he do what he told
So they peep game and watch you go on keep playing
I think I'm finna stay a while, I kinda like it here
Cause the Boogieman is real, sucker, I'm your fear

Círculo da Vida,3rd World Vision,2015.0,"É o círculo da vida, é o círculo da vida
É o círculo da vida, é o círculo da vida

Se a vida é missão, se a vida é um teste
Tamo tudo junto nesse globo terrestre
Mesmo sem querer a gente se encontra
Pois no círculo da vida não existe ponta
Eu sigo no compasso, da música e do traço
Deste novo ciclo de tempo e espaço
Quem se acha isolado desse círculo sagrado
Tá redondamente enganado

É o círculo da vida, é o círculo da vida
(Aqui se faz, aqui se paga, na dívida da vida)
É o círculo da vida, é o círculo da vida
(Pra quem hoje tá de boa, mas viveu vida sofrida)

Na rua eu sou mito pros clãs do esquisito
Enquanto toca o apito da pele em que habito
Dedico essa pro Helcio Milito
Que encaixa como peça fácil, acredito
Na lista de Lendas do som sem esquecer
Sorongo, seu amigo, digo a você
Tamo sempre a mercê de um tiro ou AVC
Então bora agradecer mais um amanhecer

É o círculo da vida, é o círculo da vida
(Degusta a cada instante como um prato de comida)
É o círculo da vida, é o círculo da vida
(Impossível saber o que acontece em seguida)

Me levanto do chão, recobro a minha visão, tá claro?
Desanuviando a mente me chega o recado
Aceito a queda, isso faz parte da missão eu sei
Sair ileso tá fora de questão
O coração no comando e mente na copilotagem
Vitórias e aprendizados conquistados na passagem
Com ou sem massagem, goste você ou não
Ela será vivida sem segunda opção

É o círculo da vida, é o círculo da vida
(É bom você saber, não é passagem só de ida)
É o círculo da vida, é o círculo da vida
(Ouvir a sua intuição é sempre uma boa pedida)

Quando a vida dá limão eu espremo na cachaça
Faço caipirinha pra rir dessa desgraça
Se o coração tá cheio de boa intenção
Você vai sair ileso do mais forte furacão
Bem vindo à alegria, bem vindo à dor
Minha banca segue sempre no caminho inovador
Seja como for, fora da caixinha
É foda quando falo dá até um frio na espinha

É o círculo da vida, é o círculo da vida
(Da hora da chegada até a porta de partida)
É o círculo da vida, é o círculo da vida
(Cada risada e lágrima escorrida)

Fervente desde a hora do ventre
Acordado nos passos da hora vigente
Na frente o panorama tá quente
Avenida acesa, elétrica e urgente
Desembaraçando os laços que o universo deu
No pulso do rio pra se lembrar do que não se esqueceu
E tudo vai e volta, de repente muda
Rodando a esquina outro caminho nasceu

É o círculo da vida, é o círculo da vida
(Esquina do infinito, da chegada e da partida)
É o círculo da vida, é o círculo da vida
(Cinema panorama, Lóki, maravilha)

No gingado chega bem Brasil
A rima é sex appeal, tão perfect, tio
My fat pocket, viu, oitenta cheque de mil
No mic check não peque, moleque wack sumiu
Caneta obesa, minha palavra pesa sobre a mesa
Minha palavra é reza com nobreza
Minha palavra preza por destreza
Bacana

É o círculo da vida, é o círculo da vida
(um rio de rimas, sample e batida)
É o círculo da vida, é o círculo da vida
(E nesse labirinto encontre a saída)

A hora é agora, começa a expedição
A jornada rumo ao nosso destino
Se testa minha paciência, você não
Vai se divertir: sem chance, menino
De escapar da batida - isso é só
Minha criação, não sou exorcista
Nem mesmo estranho, tampouco um esquimó
Mas me mantenho na minha própria pista""

É o círculo da vida, é o círculo da vida

And They Thought That Was Hell,Funk Man (The Stimulus Package),2009,"Hip hop, an asylum
Run by inmates, who be wilin'
So I'm comin' with a heavier dose
This medication is safe for you slowpokes
Don't choke, just swallow it, follow it
With this funk flow poured from the bottle, kid
Some of y'all don't mind if you die in the spotlight
Long as you shine you be crossing the line
And you out of your mind
They very own personal Dr. Frankenstien
And the monster is right in front of your face
You can't figure it out, you figure it's me
Cuz I stay way ahead of you dweebs
My regiment be the strictest rituals
Habitual funk for competition, it's critical
Get exposed in the expose
Soon as you step on stage, get fragged with grenades
Average a day of raps per capita
Slappin ya, you just a passenger that be tagging along
You averagin' on some other shit you think is nice
Well think twice
Life is too short to be a shorty
Is the story of the glorious trail
The metamorphosis of Del
Livin' large, the niggas in charge of the game
Like a caretaker, a shareholder with a rare aura
Everybody think they hip connected
Through the world-wide web with microchips
Cellphones radiate the mic I spit into
Sending feedback so please just leave that
Thing where you came from
I'm-a leave your brain numb
You ain't gonna need it after feeling the invasion
Ceiling's gonna cave in
Vibrations bounce and drill into the pavement
I'm thrilling you with entertainment
Yo, I never gave anybody hell
I just told them what's up
And they thought that was hell
D-E-L and I'm back from hell
Trapped in hell where I learned to master self
Have you in a spell
With the magical raps that I tell
Caught in a rapture relax with yourself
Funk'll fill you with a passion that'll push you past it
And leave them tricky bastards in hell
H-E-double hockey sticks
I know I'm hot so hop off my dick
Talkin' shit at a mile a minute
You can tell a lieutenant to fuck the speed limit
You know when it's on once you smell that fire and brimstone
I'm at the endzone
I find most of this bullshit pushed as entertainment
Very educational as soon as they make a home and try to take control
I just pick up a book and read
Cuz I can't believe
None of the crap they put on TV
Satellite vision
Hell if I listen to a motherfucker who whole mission
Is to get into my brain
Sit and find blame with anything I got goin'
They plot is more important
All I gotta say is 'so what?'
Reality TV is so far from that
Motherfuckers be washed up and try to come back
-----wax indicated madness
Imitation of the fatness that is now public access
At this moment in time
You are frozen in time
I am holding you with rhyme flow
Patterns that average adults say is thought provoking
He talks like he's brought up from Oakland
And hold notions back
Till I find the quotient
I feel like a Vulcan amongst trollkins
No comprehende
If they got the sense from they sensei
They sensei he been gay
And that's what me and my friends say
H-E-double hockey sticks
I know I'm hot so hop off my dick
Talkin' shit at a mile a minute
You can tell a lieutenant to fuck the speed limit
You know when it's on once you smell that fire and brimstone
I'm at the endzone
Ladies and gentlemen
I present to you the finest
Your Highness
Sir Diesel
Your knight in funky armor
I'ma put you in the mood to funk
Funk'll have you feeling the groove
Yeah the groove is on me
On the house
I'm buying at the bar
Try me out
You know them other dudes is butt
Straight ass crack
Now you asking for your money back
This one's on me, on the house
Let me see something
Show me what it's all about
Hey, I never gave anybody hell
I just told them what's up
And they thought that was hell
D-E-L and I'm back from hell
Trapped in hell where I learned to master self
Sweat pouring on my shirt
The air conditioners don't work",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-and-they-thought-that-was-hell-lyrics
Mothership Connection,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Well, all right, Starchild
Citizens of the universe, recording angels
We have returned to claim the pyramids
Partying on the mothership
I am the mothership connection
Gettin' down in 3D, light year groovin'
All right, hear any noise
Like nobody but me and the boys
Gettin' down, hit it fellas
If you hear any noise
It's just me and the boys
Hit me, you gotta hit the band
All right, all right, Starchild here

Well, okay, y'all been blessed
With the finesse of one of the truest and the best
Zac Hendrix is the name, coincidental as shit
It kinda figures with funky presidential, then Del
That is I, the funky human looming on the scene
What you got there sewing in the pot?
Well, we got the p-funk gumbo
Something for the new and old funk and soul

Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip
And come on up to the mothership

Get on board and make sure you got your funk on brother
You fake the funk, I see your nose there throbbing

Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip
And come on up to the mothership

I know you wanna perform a single line
One at a time
You will get to see the glory
But the process is the best part of the story
Quit rushing, shit
Zac Hendrix is your selector tonight, your humbo homes
Sir Dzl, knight in funky armor
No need for alarm, we ain't here to harm ya
Just want to let y'all know that funk is what it's all about, aight

Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip
And come on up to the mothership
Loose booty, doin' the bump
Hustle on over here
If you hear any noise
It's just me and the boys
Hit me, you gotta hit the band
Ain't nothing but a party, y'all
Face it even your memory banks
Have forgotten this funk
Mothership connection
Home of the p-funk, the bomb
If you hear any noise
It's just me and the boys
Hit me, you gotta hit the band
Doin' it in 3D
Let me put on my sunglasses here
So I can see what I'm doing
When you hear seats rumble
You will hear your conscience grumble
Hit me, you gotta hit the band
You have overcome for I am here
Swing low, time to move on
Light years in time, ahead of our time
Free your mind and come fly
With me, it's hip on the mothership groovin'
Swing down, sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down, sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down, sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down, sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down, sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride

Running off at the mouth
I talk about niggas who play a game and they hoes the same
Tricks and dicks quickies, pick me please
Saying anything a bitch believe
Dream merchants no reimbursements
Life goes on
So I write those songs that I’ll flow on
Roll one to grow on
So on and so on cold and so wrong
Just don’t be long

Weak niggas feed on
Once I hit this bump betcha get chumped
Trying to shortchange me, insane D

Now back to the people, I’m attracted to equal all sorts of evil
Cause D will make evil take a sleep pill
Dive into my creepshow it’s illegal
Drug paraphernalia, ice pirates, coochie tyrants, pimpin’ at its finest
Hoes in denial, shows for survival

But fools think I’m lying tho
I’m inside at home trying to leave these hoes alone
She said I’m so and so blowing on a dosia cone
She thinks I’m large
Shit that’s mine, she thinks is ours
While I’m asleep, she sleep with johns in my garage
It’s not a thang, I never bought a ring
You know positive thangs is not all I sang
I’ma, I’ma, give to you raw like O.D.B
I’ma, I’ma, hit you in the jaw like O.P.D with this, this, this

Sidestep your funny talk
The bum-rush ain't ever gonna stop
Watch your ass belly-flop
Dummies trying to tell me what I should do
When they barely cop
Enough for their basic needs
Trying to hate on me
Pump your brakes before I make you bleed
My ?commentation? gets different denominations
For the breadbasket
The shit's classic, on some jet black shit
Passing you the wildcard
Anything's possible when I drop a flow
Your whole style fraud
I apply hard pressure
To make you foolish dudes fess up

Broke with nowhere to go now
Rodeo clowns trying to evade the bull
After acting like they taking it by the horns
You can't ride the ?

Once you hit the ground, get stomped
Into human juice you stupid dufus
Having you running like mucous
Pursuit is, swift and challenging
Throw off your balancing
Vertigo
Hurt your flow

I'm coming for the money bag
Punishing your ugly ass
Not giving a damn where the fuck we at
Call the authorities
You all disorderlies
All will be handled accordingly
And who ain't supporting me
Fine! They small time
Complaining about nickels and dimes
? in the ass?
Ridiculous to ask
Why you asinine
The absolute last in line
?Nonessential? moron that's monumental
All you got is what your momma get you
But I'm out to break the bank
Ain't gonna be nothing left
When I take the tank
Out for a Sunday cruise
Crush your crews
Flows'll ? in ?
Busted through
Then puss will ooze
Whoever you entrusted to
Get a couple, too
Just to prove
Don't interrupt the dude
The feud that ensues
Will leave you subdued, abused
Roll then you lose
Come up with a blank
With nothing to thank
You better tuck in your ?chain?

Plots devious plans in Satan’s name / Cause they can’t take the
Game / Cause they fake and lame /Come break these changes
It’s psychological not mythological/ Bitch get a job for real / Not
Hoeing or dick blowing / You can tell me where you going / D
Know, no need to be holding a grudge / From the start of niggas
Showing some love / Plus at the end / Everybody will be closing
Their mug / We all pause, so I know I’ma scrub / Get up get the
Dirt of my shoulder blades / You got to fail to succeed so no one
Is safe / Yes, you gotta risk it, it’s the mother of invention I’m
Butter with diction / What a fucking whiz kid / Taught by the best, I
Flip it with finesse / I’m different from the rest / We all gotta step to
The batter’s box / So, it matters not / What a chatterbox blab
About / We don’t even know without a doubt /Man, come on fool
Chorus(sample)
Yeah, yeah sure you do/ I heard that you going on about with a
Whole bunch of doubt / Now rolling about without knowledge of
Self / is gonna get you in a situation / Whooped with a belt / you
Coulnd’t excel / Do it again, first time you get your hands on the
Sticks /
You ain’t gonna be the shit / That’s why there’s practicing
Doctors, practicing mathematicians and authors all for the skrill /
Man chill / Man you ain’t for real / You ain’t moving until I peel
Back some bills / Fool you still open pills / Be a part of it instead
Of being slick like an eel, silly?

Som do Marvin bem suave em um drive in
O dinheiro é a chave quando as portas travam
Faz até com que as suas pernas também abram

A milha que trilha na trilha a milhão
Nesse free assim trazem pilhas de cifrão
Caso te seduza, te usa e te lambuza
E te abusa pra que conduza a sua ilusão
Me encobre seu cheiro podre com um perfume da Givanchy
E as cáries do seu sorriso com um dente que é de Ruby

Dinheiro paga a pista e os meganha
Dinheiro em montanhas céu arranha, emana

Delta Time,Iller Than Most,UnKnown,"Okay, first off, don't expect no deep shit
The world got enough tribulations, we tryna beat it
We with the honors, but that's on the daily
Grind right now, flows composed to entertain the mind
Even so I'm still not an imbecile
Anything I say is meant to lift you to the pinnacle
At the same instance smack suckers down
Verbally, honestly I don't know why they fuck around
Delta time, previous business
Suckers being tempted to crawl off into it
They better chill cause I roll with a tight troop
Forget their rap hits, obviously hot poop
Yo, I'm flipping the steering, grand exposure in real time
As I juxtapose hoses, stupid dough, more so, they can't repeat it
In the telephone booth with broke boots, you sleeping

*Snoring noises*
Wake your ass up, wake your ass up. Wake your punk ass up

Delta time, smell my rhyme
Diesel do it easily, they sell them shine

I could do sixteens or I could do monologues
Similar to Rudy Ray Moore spitting rhymes galore
Rappers ain't that sharp, test their IQ
Stats say they quick to catch a case for trying to bite fools
Plagiarism, say it isn't
They created those flows, but something looks forced
 while Diesel belittle 'em
Hardcore, I see the gap between the illusion doors
The tune serious, it spark your curiosity
You ain't a boss if you ain't got employees so stop it please
You mocking me, you oath, you ain't never been flame, boy
On my rugged hardcore like my star flow
Too edgy, too heavy, booth Betty
Fuck the jibber, danger action, dude ready
Power yearning, doors down, they forced out
America's slang that's funkified from its source pound

Just get it from the source, stop fucking with these imitators. I mean, really. It's a look. Terrible. Terrible look. Oh my God. Why squander, you roach? I got you",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-delta-time-lyrics
Simple Satisfaction,Funk Man (The Stimulus Package),2009,"I'mma keep it alive, the funk
With this 'lil special device, the funk
It works for me, what's that, the funk
Lemme flip the switch and get it started, the funk
Try to go against the funk, you're finished
You gone substitute, you're finished
DZL, funk from the beginning to the 9th inning
And my team is winning, homeboy, you're finished
Sir D, dirty wordsmith, poetry perfect
So serious with the lip service
Somebody get him a mop
Properly sop up this mess left by the previous guests
Yes, that's an order from the lord of the funk continuum
Any fool disagree, send me 'em, I'll attend to 'em
Quick, fast, leave his ass, pickin' through the trash
Lightning bolt voltage, extra watts
Add pressure to your box, tell it to stop
But Del is a rock, unmovable juggernaut
Astronaut but on the asphalt with my rap vault
Now open to the public for observation
Admiration of how we used to play it
Daze and amaze with flow
Any engagement is like a wedding reception
Hope you get a reception
Don't miss out on this fresh cut, jeah
Tried to told you
I visualize with mind of Minolta, definin' the culture
Move with it, groove with it, body and soul connect
We 'bout to perfect the action
For simple satisfaction
That come from sayin' that we did it
You ain't with it then don't, I don't care
You just miss the boat
Hitler? Nope, DZL, leader of the funk people
And I'mma see you 'cause funk or die
That was the promise so
Deep but wear my heartbeat on my sleeve
Let it vibrate the signal leads
To the thing you need to cling to, to believe
I'mma tell you that it's real, I had to feel
Not in the sense of sensual touch
But you can tell the difference when you gettin' the rush
Not drugs, not to fuck of your buzz
But this came before the additives
Nigga, I'm bad and big, come test it
Words leave you heard, no further suggestions
Swerve to a session in less than half an hour
I got a pad with paragraphs of power, now you're devoured
You ain't allowed to talk 'cause you foul and false
Mouthin' off like a child of God
But you get beat down with freestyles
'Cause you're cheap style
Don't even need to be out, believe me it's wild
Uncontrollable, foldin' you like a bank roll
Jeah, takin' control, I'm back with Zac
Crackin' your wig back with that counter-attack
For that counterfeit bought over the counter shit
I got thousands of scripts from down in the pit
Deep underground where the system crank
Causin' earthquakes, you heard it reverberate
I'm sure that you can relate
If you're funky there's no further debate
Move with it, groove with it
On ya mark and get set, go
'Del the funky homosapien' once again
Sometimes from the end to the beginning
If you can smell the fragrance, tell them dunces
Don't say shit, you must be out your mind
Crazy like a bag of sprayed weed
They way out your league, better leave it to the big boys
Jeah, deep in the land of funk, funk or die
That was the promise so
Deep in the land of funk",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-simple-satisfaction-lyrics

Who want it?
It's diesel, I'm staring at the stooge who responded
Bruised consciousness is all he gon' get

Swing with the author with the authorization to
Get farther than the witch doctor
'Cause this doctor be totally free for operations
Because he ain't got no patience
Say something bitch so I can slap half ya face backwards

Why don't more practice something pertinent

And so far I can see
A lot of suckers eat junk food

Just the bland tactics be having me spasm
See the fans' reaction, they tearing they tickets up
They want a refund, they can't stand it
I'm the executor, whatever bitch test that is extra stupid
The next intruder getting electrocuted
Five hundred thousand volts like they ass just dived
In the moat with a portable heater
Then get back at you for ignoring her speeches
About the order of proceedings
She said she swore that she was leaving
So leave then, I see you still here
Baby you move like a slug
Actually moving just can't perceive it
Give me a reason, you know I'm beasting

Warning,3rd World Vision,2015.0,"I tried to give him a warning
I think he too caught up
On shit that don't matter

Yo I used to run around with Kevin
I said used to cause Kevin would leave me headsick
Dude just had a loser mentality
So he would always do stuff to try to challenge me
Back in eight grade I brushed it off
But he still doing this shit, what the fuck is wrong?
I can't trust him at all, he hit below the belt
Plus he overindulgent cause he don't know himself
He told me go to hell and got overzealous
Once I started making records, I could tell that he was jealous

I tried to give him a warning
I think he too caught up
On shit that don't matter

He used to put himself on front street
Out in public playing around like he punking me
Knowing damn well that ain't how you talk to fools
That's when I caught the clues, he must be all confused
He the type that be, uhh... lying to kick it
With no place to go, he always tryna to visit
He got the mind of a midget, tryna act profound
I had to pull him to the side, tell him ""slow down""
In case you didn't know pal, that ain't attractive
Realize before someone actually slap ya

I tried to give him a warning
I think he too caught up
On shit that don't matter

Homeboy act like he always had a plan
Soon as we hit the club, there go the avalanche
He ask a chick, uh, if he could have a dance
If she says no, he says ""fuck it"" and grabs her hands
He the type to, uhh... buy Gucci sneakers
Living with mom, but not cause he choose to be there
He be scared, don't even leave the house
But when he's with me, he got the nerve to speak with his mouth
About KP and say what he need to do
I say ""you need to be cool, 'fore someone ether you""

I tried to give him a warning
I think he too caught up
On shit that don't matter

Yeah well, this is the end of the saga
Cause when your pretend partner wanna holla, don't bother
He just wanna be down with the beat movement
That mean he so pro? But no, cause he's stupid
I've had close calls with us both against the wall
With the police just checking our balls
I'm not the one to say that he's a lost cause
But he be acting like a rockstar and he ain't a star
I tried to give him a look and tell him obey
Before you catch a fade, but he didn't listen, no way
Guess where he going today? He 'bout to go away
To the big house, dig what I was spitting about?

Hardcore Punks Can’t Take It,Funk Man (The Stimulus Package),2009,"Yeah man, half these motherfuckas, man, is wack, man
Half these, as a matter of fact, like, like, like
3/4 of y'all motherfuckas is wack, that's real
Ain't saying shit, I don't even give a fuck, man
Shit's hardcore, man, punks can't take it
Y'all, I keep it hardcore and punks can't take it
I got that shit passed down to me by foul situations
Dealin', give a fuck how you clowns be feelin'
I can't sleep sound without thousands peelin'
Like potatoes
How my day goes
Straight to work, innovate flows, renovate tones
Penetrate domes when they ain't knowin'
Illiteracy, all time high
It's bigger than me, I just wade through the hate juice
It ain't cool but shit that's what'll make you
Come through with a breakthrough
The adversity, work it with the need to express
Dump off the excess and zone inside my headset
And give way game like midway engraved in the caverns
Where the funk is imagined and conjured
Creating a monster
It won't be long till the drama spill
I got a stronger will
Go beyond the field because I wanna
Honor, shield my personal armor
From my mentality that you piranhas long to conquer
But this time we gonna have some fish fry
Twist time so it benefit mine
Yeah, in the nick of time
Nickel slick rhymes
Shift sides to the flip side
Soak a motherfucka, let 'em drip dry
Can't take it
I can't even believe this shit, you motherfuckas
You know how it feels
Some, some, some
Sometimes I feel the place is disgraceful
And no reason in particular
Pictures of the past life I was stuck in
Inducted in the ruckus, a lot of destructive motherfuckas
Some was G's for real and some was busters
Some were corrupted and couldn't be trusted
I wasn't above it, I wasn't a thug but a knuckle-head buggin'
And fuckin' shit up for nothin'
Hip Hop appeared like a storybook fantasy
A lot of fools capped on me
When I rapped for free in front of the whole faculty
After recess, jealous dummies wanted to scrap with me
I caught a few blows, I fucked some fools up
Now they comin' to school with they tools tucked
You know they pride, can never leave it at a few cuts
And bruises signifying that they was losers
I'm like, please tell me who was the winner then?
Chasin' me with knives with they bigger friends
And family members and none of them fools was badly injured
I remember
I laid low 'til could stray from home
I had to stay in the safe zone
Told myself, I'm gonna make it with these great flows
I make, those bozo's chose they fate, I used to know
Those who would hold the weight
I never turned up my nose
But always wanted to know they were straight
Closed casket, no joke, so is the wake
And half of them know they fake, tryna show some strength
It use to feel like there's no escape
I was broke, no dates, all the hoes would fake
All the bro's on the block tell me that the flow was dope
So there's hope, just hold that rope and don't let go
'Cause some of them lost they grip
Habitual liars always tryna start some shit
Hell, don't be a target, be smart and swift
Mind my business but remember you was a part of this
I never forgot and put it in the bars I spit
So all you crabs in the bucket, get off my dick
'Fore your ass get served in a match of words

Rattlesnakes who believe you immortal
Told ya’ll pulling ya ho card before you
Bogart and overflow I’ll assure you
There is two sides, you hide foolish pride
Every time you high side and storm through
Watch it; that's the topic I’m talking
You thoughtless so you walk with no caution
Stop it cause you pop shit so often
It's toxic, just like a jock-itch: obnoxious
Think you God’s gift but you not a bit
Like your comments
You not the bomb, drop it
When you start your engines, I’m cringing
Then intentionally I don’t listen
I hear you just the same
I just distance all of my conscious thought or attention
Your lip service serves no purpose
Ain’t even real it's just your invention
 X 2
No nonsense it’s straight up and down
This is how it is, the way it goes down
It don’t slow down get on the boat now
Nothing to doubt, it’s straight up and down
Thats how I’m calling it, top to bottom it's my attitude
You can't fuck around

You need to try heed the procedure
And stop trying to leap ahead like you the leader
Or you the boss because you ain’t either
You off the meter, please take a breather
Think you foxy but see I see
So you wanna mock me but it’s all theatre
You don’t know so don’t throw me
In that bag of average hokey pokies
No need soon as you try and okey dokey
Don’t be shocked to find yourself
Both feet touching clouds your back on the ground
You’re much too proud
Your whole style is revolting
Insulting you clown my intelligence
As if things you say have any relevance
Just because you say it with eloquence
That’s just game, it’s stanking, i'm smelling it
You are not the truth
You a author feeling inadequate adding your embellishments


Game peep game
So ain’t nothing going over my head
You may as well notice it's all in your head
You show it with boldness
Even though I know you think I don’t know this
You got weak game
Everything you speak change tune
As soon as you say it, that ‘s bogus
Don’t trip you see that way is low risk
I say there’s no gold without no risk
Oh shit, but you know this you
Just think you so slick you can just go over it
What do it take to finally wake you up
Feel this and bet you it’s sobering

Son, I remember him, yeah, he the medicine
But he don't heal 'em, his funk put an end to it
Personal prescription is poisonous and venomous
Young adrenaline, D-E-L, you did it again, you did it again
Yo, peep the transition from here to there
Man, you understand pimpin' shit's different
Now peep the conversation between me and you
And about clockin' paper which means
Makin' one worthy of the cream 'cause nobody passin' it out
'Fore elastic came out
Yeah, your ass is out, if you don't dig
Concentrate the effort 'cause the shit's big
You won't live very long fuckin' around
There's somethin' about puttin' my foot in front of the other
Start struttin', I'm mean with it, lean with it
Like I'm really something to see
I smell bad, yeah, the funk is on me and you gon' to get some
Keep up the friction
'Til a spark lights dry grass and fry yo ass, fire sign DZL, Leo
Some say I'm egotistical but that's 'cause they below
Here, throw on these spectacles and see what D know
Peep why my concentration deep like Preemo
Don't get mad 'cause you missed the bus
Blame it on luck and miss the next one pulling up
Hopefully, you will utilize it
Knowledge, groundbreaking thoughts I process
Get me outta nonsense, leavin' most foxes astonished
I'll box with the Ebonics
Talk like weed and chronic if it had human capabilities
I break it down like segments on a centipede
I'mma blowin' steam and diggin' the scene
D, he know these things, he like to roll with kings
And crusaders who probably stole your rings
Slid them off your fingertips
That's how it will go on the low, you never know
So flossin' is just not a option
Don't even wanna or feel the need to parade
What I made in front of the people who made me DZL
And you know if you fake, they gonna see you
In a minute though, I got an endless flow
Pinned up on the wall like centerfolds
I sit enclosed
In a sound lab with profound task I undergo
'Cause I'm coming close to the knowledge I need
To get on some next shit and now I gotta lead
And take work, damn it, I know it all seems hella easy and fun
But those be the wack ones
See some action for years, they maybe crackin'
Poppin', but they don't last too often
Longevity means you survive
Short sightedness ain't insured for the flight
Secruity tight, he gotta stay on the ground
He hatin' like a child but I'm on my way now
Fuck 'em, let the motherfucka hop Greyhound
Maybe he can hang around the rim for a rebound
Can't even see style, much too forward
Plus too boring for a feeble mind dormant
Evil, I know it but, shit, it's kind of funny though
Motherfuckas laugh at my expense on another show
Or another channel but I control this
Particular network with a different direction
You alive but not actively growing
So insulting me, the impact below 3
Negative 26, the funniest shit 'cause I'm real with it
Tellin' you there's money to get
Keep running your lips
You gonna see it's comin' up in a bit
Hold up, hold up
Hey Del
What's up?
Yeah, you're just like sand, man, I knew it, man, what's happening?
I have a feelin' you'll be slidin' back in
My man, you back on the scene, never lack esteem
That's what I mean
My man, yeah, introduce yourself to these suckers drivin' around
So that they pay more attention to you
Opportunity is my name
Pursuin' me should be your main game
You should stick to me, a well known operative
, it's all good though
There's so many possibilities that come to me
Shit
I figure why not peel off some for free?
But, Big, I don't hang around, you understand that?
I just came to town for a minute
It was a favorable time, I admit it
But when I gotta split, I gotta split
This might be your only chance, you get?
I know you think I'm blowin' smoke up yo ass
But you broke, I got pockets overflowin' with cash
If you diggin' yourself like you seem to be, ah, diggin' mine for cash
You are, you know you gotta a shot at makin' the moment last
So let's see if you dig right here, right now, I got a new lease
Yeah, that's what you need, you know what you need though
Keep on jivin', I gotta split, man
But young DZL, I'mma catch you later, aight?

My introduction:
It's such an unbelievable pleasure
For you to treasure;
And much needed too
Make it phat though
On another plateau-
You begining to begining to groove;
I do it natural
As we get Jazzy with classy shit
To make them hard ass rappers wanna blast me (buck buck)
Cause I exemplify a typified mac
In actin like the shit nigga
Mashin rappers with a passion
When I get Tip and Tribe flashion lyrics
I smash your spirits
Like a big disappointment
But this here shit will surprise ya
Devise a plan:
The pipsqueaks get tweaked
Cause of the size of demand
So if you wanna measure up
Then press your luck
Cause when I'm in the cut
Man there ain't no catchin up
I bet ya never heard a nigga with a bigga this flow
Bigga this bro
Gettin ate like a clitoris?
No
I never could'a seen it-
I rip a rapper's balls off
To make him scream when its convenient
Hear ye hear ye
Clearly we're the
Undisputed ones that you get mad at when you hear me
Pompous comp. just barely even registered on the meter
Cause we the niggas that they checkin for
Me and you or, you and him
Ruinin' them
Doin men in
When I'm cluing them in
On the one

Ya two... three, four

Now niggas know I got lyrics out the anal
And any move that you make could be fatal
The poet that shows it:
And some of y'all niggas know it when ya
Grab the mic and you can't recite
Yo that gets me irate when ya can't debate
But wait- Now ya niggas think that I'm ya runnin' mate?
Naw phukk that, cause when I grab the baton I'm gone (zoom)
All around the track like a runnin maniac (damn)
You babblin your babblin son; what the phukk?
Anybody here rap that doesn't go buck?
But can you grab the mic and kick ill shit? (like)
Stun'em with the verbs, instead of using clips
Check it: I flip styles by the dozen;
I-could-even-(too fast) that I was but I wasn't
You MC's are slipping into rigor mortis
Give it up please
And just support this;
I got styles that are legendary
Even in the clink
Lyrically I'm like
What the phukk you think?
Cause I'm down with the D-E-L
So what the hell?

(Haha!)
I never come from the temple a simple rap
Cause your raps poor
I'm on track
I lap yours
Collapse yours
Elapse forever
You're never gonna get better bitin' my friend
But I lend a hand helping
MC's yelping like puppies (Arf! Arf!)
Their rhymes are simple
My rhymes are roughed up
Like a duffle bag
Mags on my wheels squeal
Peel out towards your head
While others bust lead
That's dead
I beat your head in the resin when the pipe hits the buds in my
Chamber
My rhymes are never tamer
Perpetrators I'ma hurt ya later/after
On the path of danger
I got fangs not bangs
Like a bitch which I use to puncture
With punctuation-
And mutation
Racin' like my thoughts
Bust shots to scatter
And my latter lets me elevate
Over MC's that are hella fake
My reaction to your rappin' is laughin
It has been for askin they get their ass kicked
Cause they're plastic
I'm bringing lyrical lacerations
That you're tastin
Painful I mame foes
Metaphorically
Historically used the hip hop
To make your neck pop
Naw the eyes cause I kick the modern style
(Modern style, haha!)

The undisputed ones that you get mad at
The undisputed ones that you get mad at
The undisputed ones that you get mad at

They say the same shit to me
While I'm on tour and far out they reach
How's the streets? I often wonder
'Cause they sittin' on that same milk crate
I understand why they feel hate
It hurts when you set straight
Quit talkin', start watchin'
My name is Sir DzL, I'm not them other options
I got it goin' on and poppin'
Too Short proved you could do it, no problem
Ice Cube, Sir Jinx really stirred the drinks
I'm talkin' 'bout that path
Back then with wax on a phonograph
I'll plant you now and dig you up later
You need to quit hatin', conduct an investigation
West civilization got somethin' to add to the equation
And that ain't no Jim Crow shit
That you can't drink from my water fountain, bullshit
I gots love for all the cats rappin'
Wherever they makin' it happen, it's all action
And that's what's happenin' literally
I just peep some niggas think that they can shit on a beat
By the most popular producer out circa
When you unearthed that worthless waste
Take that auto tune off, leave the gimmicks at home
You ain't foolin' nobody, dumb nigga, it's on
Let me spit somethin' for 'em
Let the homie twist somethin' for 'em
Them Cali buds, ah, ha, now he feel the Cali love
Go 'head, shit, it's on the house
Now relax and peep Cali got somethin' for the drought
See this
Straight from the big bad west coast, let's go
Straight from the big bad west coast, let's go
Straight from the big bad west coast, let's go
Straight from the big bad west coast, let's go
Yo, don't get me wrong, I salute the Bronx
I would never dare to do this art and dilute the content
Ever since I heard the phonics
Reminded me of Richard Pryor
That's the only rapper that I could mention
Prior to that, what Melle Mel was rappin' about?
I could see that from the back of my house
And that was before crack was out
Niggas just was freebasin'
But I was mesmerized by complete phrases
Poignant statements that if written out on paper
You haters couldn't say shit
It was crazy 'cause flavor appealed to the days I seen
Growin' up as a child in the '70s
Y'all don't know nothin' 'bout that
Motherfuckers, be glad to hop out the shack
And upgrade like the Jeffersons
Now motherfuckers act like the ghetto is the best it is
And that's ain't a hater statement
If you love it then save it, it is what you make it
And basically it's down to the basics
Survival of the fittest and the quick witted
Makes no difference, the distance apart
My whole fuckin' family from the south now
I wish you would start
I got peeps in the east too
All my kin in South Central, I see you
My cousin Tigre' used to babysit me
Encouraged my rappin' and would watch MTV with me
Motherfuckers had curls and you thought it was all palm trees
'Cause you couldn't see
The media back then didn't even come with camera men
Where gang violence was crackin' in full effect
You thought niggas was surfers
Never got close enough to see where the dirt was
In Oakland, I knew where the turfs was
My parents had a plan though
And I'm part of the plan, I am hope
Dig that, sucker
More substance in my bars
Than most you niggas on the mic can absorb
Sir DzL, the overlord of funk, on the one
Showin' West Side support and love
Let's work together like the 70's
So we can all shine incredibly
Straight from the big bad west coast, let's go
Straight from the big bad west coast, let's go
Straight from the big bad west coast, let's go

Fit Like A Glove,Funk Man (The Stimulus Package),2009,"Jeah
I got that shit
I got that shit that
Really work and it fit
Like a glove
And i be speadin the love
I ain't stingy
Niggas just gotta get wit me
Perfect fit
Try it on for size
You gone work it
Put it on
Flaunt it on purpose
Make it your own
Take it and grow
Haters don't know
We tried to tell em this shit
100s of years ago
Ok all you mugs lissen up
We got a few fools out here
Poppin shit about us
I know you heard
Same ol' backwards shit
By now i know u probably used to it
I got news fo them tho
Hustlin baby
End of discussion
Handle it
On the goodfoot
Movin forward
All u niggas who be
So full 'o shit
I just ignore u
Comin up wit
Cures for ills
Mysterious fields that
Be hoverin
I peep and discover them
The consequences as
The song commences
Dumb defenseless
Sons of bitches shouldn't tempt this
In an instant
I will away offences
To distances that render
Them inneffectual
Flow is impeccable
Checkin hoes
Disrespectin foes
Who don't need no label
Call em joe shmoe
I don't need no label
Make my own dough
U wanna get in on this
Funk then compromise
Seein as i'm on the rise
The industry's demise
I had the foresight to
Notice in development
Sir DzL
He never settle fo less
Ghetto express
Delivery like federal express
Keep the harmony
Within confusing boundaries
That's my specialty
Illusions surrounding me
Just be comedy
Outdated special fx
Cuttin edge in 1936
Most of all i see be
Straight up fiction
Depictions of mofos
Playin the victim
Way too privileged
Who be hatin like bitches
Way too suspisious
Need to take ur position
Out my way mofo
Movin thru
You get an ""F"" for fired
I got it from here jack
Your idea of discipline
About as dumb as it gets
Your mind shallow
That ain't as deep as it gets
The flow's heat when i spit?
Roast mofos plus the
Beat to a crisp
Ain't no secret to this
Sir DzL the
Reaper my bitch
Ain't no sequel to this
Get off my dick and
Make ur own sequence of hits
I be deep in the abyss
Frequently pissed
Because u underestimate
How i be freakin the gift
Completely in bliss
Walk around souped like Cambell's
Can't tell
Or accept
I got it goin on
F ur test
I walk around
Expecially vexed
Ready to rep
Because i know you petty and pet
As in petro
Throw u in the death hold
Flexin flows
Press more than you can tow
You go ahead attribute
My triumph with flukes
Shit again right in yo grill
There's the proof
Jeah
You can't hear me tho
I got an eerie flow i know
It spook ya
Bitch it's the future
Get used to it
DzL he here to stay
Drill funk in yo ear
Give you an earache
Fear make you tremble
Backstab yo own kinfolk
That's how you know that the
End is close
Sir DzL
I'm a win the vote
Cause i give em hope
And your whole intent is to
Pimp a hoe
You gotta be fuckin kiddin
I will slap the shit outta you mofo
Get the fuck outta here
I see u think you're
Superior in every corridor
Where attributes and faculties
Kick it
But you weak
That's the most accurate description
And no you don't hear me
What i'm sayin ain't nearly near
What it appears to be
Handle it
Sir DzL
Comin to you live
Like a telephone wire layin
Out in the street
Zzzzt! watch out
Here to serve the community
With true flow fluidly
Ain't nothin new to me

Militant,Iller Than Most,UnKnown,"Okay, deliberately rhyme great
I never dumb down, you won't get it or job right
Either or form covers all the bases
Flows terrorist, forming words I'm saying
Leaving the future, rocket firmly
They shouldn't understand the bird in on the journey
And it ain't no crooked caper
The previous antidote is good to the vapor
Mr.Bentley, put my foot on a hater
Riding on their neck bone
Pressure on their stepping stone
My trying? I'm fly like airliners
Tuned in, peeped all you hilarious items
Turn on the Ritz, background living from the glitz
Fools fade, they can't play, they on the fritz
What I spit is the tits, they ain't the shit
Anarchy, I don't care, burn down the bitch

What I gotta do to get this shit cracking?
The militant mind state

Okay, my antic speech gigantic, titantic
No abracadabra, real action
Street savvy, sweet like cavi
What don't give you make you stronger, but it's magne
School of chrome, the rules are known better
Know your limits, can't be froze or 
Rhyme words  many with sun tans
Target display dynamics, they learned to run fast
Brothers will know what son of the sleeve won't leave
Apple sauce make your brain catapult, white chalk
It ain't nonsense, greater be the consequence
Haters be anonymous falling into a bottomless pit
Got a problem with it? I'll shut your enterprise
 inside until the bench inside
Come wandering out, quantum targeting found
Your sound's harmless, everything you honor
Nod your head to the king, let the Moet glow
Rep your wack ass style deep in the death zone
Yeah, rep your wack ass style deep in the death zone",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-militant-lyrics

Bitin Ain’t Samplin,Iller Than Most,UnKnown,"The fortress ain't open to big mouths
Keep in mind this is my house
My sanctuary
Bionic mind waves, you facing every
Time my mic is exposed, don't leave a trace of any
Rapper fries, sweep 'em up, chastised, keep it up
I'mma show you it don't pay to bluff
Sir Diesel off the cuff, off the chain
On your grain, on the game, bomb on lame
Individuals, sent you off, thank you so dandy
I'mma slam these flows, kill the fantasy
 shout 'til you explode
Shooken hands, close struggle to dispel the throne
Numbing the words, necessary usage
Keep yapping, I'm guaranteed to render useless
I satisfy like water to plants
Father over the stands, forecast the avalanche

Bitin' ain't samplin', you got that twisted
You bite 'til you bleed, really, you ain't that gifted

Five week grinders with blinders
Tunnel vision 'til son done with it
Tongue twisted if I sign a permission slip
To myself with a trip, otherwise I flip
Surreal analogy so rattle the
Status quo, batteries that make your batter flow
Like lemonade, but with a bitter taste
In a bit of rage, but that's okay, shit's beginner stage
Try to write bullshit on my dinner plate?
You won't get away with that, my pilot penetrate
Enemy lines, send 'em around, first class
First glass with extreme focus like Logan
Before he joined X-Men
Stop them from texting while they driving
Keep your eyes away, you riding
That's my word, you representer, get the form
So mislead, the luxury drown the morgue
And you know this",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-bitin-aint-samplin-lyrics
Frosty Face,3rd World Vision,2015.0,"One moment at a time, I'm holding on to life
But still I aim high roll it down the pipeline
Cruisin the cosmos, God spoke, check my mind
Light speed breakin all the laws subpeona me
When out my comfort zone santos tickle ear phones
Flows native droppin missiles on your thought-wave
Repetition repetition, it's hindering the mission
Make way, I campaign to hit 'em and then
I give 'em frosty face for the salty stank
While laughing and clapping in the purple rain
Satisfaction gained, smackin' on sugar canes
Belotto straight swinging by my ankle range
Hear the audible gleam, it's the laudible team
Beatintel giving clean cuts you need some
Sixty frames defeat 'em, santos complete them
Chaser sun bather banking cheddar for my forever

I'm rising yes, I'm climbing space
Align the stars and I fight with bars
I'm icin hard, yea that's the case
The facts remain, I wax the lane
But I'm glad you came, relax your frame
I'm rising yes, I'm climbing space
Align the stars and I fight with bars
I'm icin hard, yes that's the case

Floaty I direct the flows
Transmit emotional
Ultramag when I speed past
Truth is in the root stash
But no it's not enough
Replenish the surplus, it's time to conduct
From stratosphere to gats out here
Pass you like a draft of air
Been here before, yeah we been here before

You think you just going to eat everybody food
And scrape off the neck bone filer
Oh I got to pay for oxygen now
Well well what have we here, dimentia
The devil's alive don't let him enter
Diesel with new beats solo
Drenched in color I hover over bozos
Take No-Doze you need to be aware of this
Wordsmith terrorist, terror rip
Errors get corrected
Swear to god if fools don't start checking theyself
I'ma jump on some next shit
Fireworks tie a jerk to the railroad tracks
Just like Penelope pitstop
Forget me being caught by the anthill mob
Feel the throb of the rhythm portayal
Frequency lay low, you people see Day-Glo
Color when I toss the flow
Not a closed book
These are rhymes you would want to know
Boundaries I love to clown the weak
Minds of ignoramuses when they be playing with my patience
When you know that the doc ain't got no patients
I'ma schedule a personal arrangement
Believe that partner
Think first you can't beat that mantra

Take 10 paces turn around and aim
You take 5 and then you throw some shit in the game
Take 10 paces and aim
I take 2 and I'ma try to topple your brain

Your trophies need polish
They always seem to be tarnished
Nostalgia be your counterpoint for argument
Pardon my french you niggas stink
Think how you think but I'm tell you what I think
I'm a genius that's why ya'll ain't peaked yet
The beat is disturbing your readout read deep shit
Executive process musically clearly discussing versatile ingenuity
Examine everybody, weigh the possibilities
I'm dope and great fuck your image it's not real to me
The underwhelming scope be the concept
Plus you lie all the time even when you honest

Sir Diesel, night to the folk table
Bump haters who on payroll
Know they gone, stay rope
Dance to that, tailgating and get shook hard
Put my soul inside, you know it's good heart
Fuck the phantoms, they can't swim
Funk apples from outer space, we slamming
Down your neck bone, rep for the throne, that's mine
Only a personal goal that bursts through your soul
Whole anatomy, move to the calamity
Agi tragedy persist upon the faculty of backwards beats
Trying to chase the trail wagon
Chase their trail wagon, circular
Worst of all tried to bag on me while I bask the beat
Flow hard, smooth transition like a sports car
Relax, ghetto barbarian is in
Pepe Le Pew can't do what I did

So robust, flows I disgust
No one told us, I know this shit scrub

Delta time catch swollen sideburns, been order
I don't feel mad fooled, disclosure
Diesel, hold your tongue or face apathy
Cast iron faculty, bag down debauchery and depravity
Our cake flows, they wave at me
Prove they got ADD, they ain't fading me
Fuck nostalgia, we doing it right now
Convos fly around, lights out, quiet sound
Yup, quiet sounds, freak the oxymorons
In the proximity, then I toss the chorus on
You boring, pa, let me freak the foundation
Twist it with some futuristic flavor, leave the ground shaking
Oh yo, don't try to fandangle

Go Against the Grain,Funk Man (The Stimulus Package),2009,"My time is short, my thoughts are lazer
Precise and accurate master any phase of
Modern technology, concerning audio fidelity
Finally settling you meddling foes who ain't never in vogue
You just better let go before I get in your dome
And just set up a home to rest
DZL, he only promote the best
Lockin' up to blow the set
Sky high, nice try, nigga
I roll with vets who never stray away
From the flavor, taste some
Oopsie, I threw in some razor blades, ace of spades
I lay naysayers to waste
Prey for grace but act like you want it first
'Cause see me, I'm not at all concerned
Really though you need a hearing aid
'Cause you don't hear me though
Slap you in your earlobe
With funk till you fear it though
My time, priceless, my rhyme, niceness
I got something for you and I think you gone like it
Funk in the fashion, something to blast
In your vast envelope of space and keep a hold of the faith
Build strength to hold the weight
You go against the grain, you get told to your face
Like, eh, dude, I ain't here to grade you
But you way due for a learnin'
Once I drip some funk in your ear
You gone feel that burnin' in your sternum
That's how you know, you ain't fast, you slow
Gimme that, you can't have it no more
You just a victim of circumstance, so fuckin' what?
Everybody got the same story, it's classical
That's the whole balance of the challenge of gettin' there
First you gotta get by the status quo
Assholes with nothin' to do but fuckin' with you
My time is spent on comin' up
With a new way to touch on the truth
Trust in the Lord who dominate over
More than your millions afford
All aboard, you comin' whether you wanna or not
And it's gonna get hot, I saved you a spot
Funk in the first degree on me, have a big helpin'
If you repel it then you start meltin'
'Cause you all jealous
Greedy fuckin' car dealers
A big hoax, no, I don't feel you folks
But I smell you just the same
Nothing's changed, you play games
But your stench I can pick up a mile away
I'm stylin' on fakes who imitate to get a plate
But as you can see you ain't finer
Get a taste of nothin' but the funk, so say your grace
As I invade your space and gauge your weight
I'm real heavy, feel every, nerve ending, bending
Antennas up and catchin' what you sendin'
Focus my attention on gettin' it and keepin' it
Defeat the stress with some funk to digest
Conductin' dialect, just like a symphony
Pimp epiphany when hoes try to trick on me
Ce la vie, they gone be all they can be
Banshees that keep me on my toes, dancing
And I'm light on my feet, Bigfoot, quick and nimble
Your head is thick, you simple
You know who I'm talkin' to, all of you
Ain't nothing wrong, just stay cool
This only phase two of everybody
Play the fool, your move, fool
And hurry up, I ain't got all day
And you gotta move now, you playin' the game
You stay in the game, Jack
Bitch out now and you get sent back
And you miss a turn, now you get to sit and burn
Now you really hot

In your vast envelope of space and keep a hold of the faith

I got something for you and I think you gone like it
Funk in the fashion, something to blast

And now ya dreams are shattered,but its all about what seemed to have mattered
And ya easily flattered and now your trapped in a hole

Acontecendo de verdade? Hum... Quase nenhum
Mesmo assim eu sigo em frente, não paro de sonhar
Sonhar não custa nada, ainda eu posso parcelar

Mas os moleque tão falando que o seu flow é mó quadrado
Mas os moleque tão falando que cê rima engraçado
Os moleque tão falando que você tá ultrapassado (Como é que é?)
Os moleque tão falando que cê vive de passado

Do que adianta ter talento sem ter conhecimento
Fazendo por fazer sem saber o que ta fazendo
Eu não entendo, ninguém pesquisa
Quem pavimentou o chão que você pisa?
O rap é minha vida, o beat me alimenta
A rima é meu trampo, o mic a ferramenta
Cês falam uma pá, depois sai com a cara inchada
Bando de picareta que não constrói nada

Os moleque tão falando que agora é diferente
Os moleque tão falando que o rap é mais pra frente
Os moleque tão falando de pulseira e de corrente
Os moleque tão falando ""Fama é o suficiente!""

Putos, comédias, embalos, trouxas
Enche o peito, mas faz rima nas coxas
O rap não tem regra, então faça o que te inspira
Mas quem é de verdade sabe quem é de mentira
Eu queria falar de amor, eu queria falar de festa
Mas esse rap é pros malucos que me testa
O rap tá em casa, cê tá sobre o mesmo teto
Não zoa o barraco, respeito o arquiteto

Mas os moleque tão falando que você não tem noção
Os moleque tão falando que você é vacilão
Os moleque tão querendo que se foda a tradição
Os moleque nem sabe quem é esse tal de Espião

Aí tio, ou melhor, sobrinho
Minha caminhada é longa, esse é um só caminho
Velho que nem whisky, rima destilada
Beba dessa fonte, segura essa ressaca
Cê fala pra caraio, cheio de intriga
Quem ganha com isso no meio dessa briga?
Abri meu apetite, agora tô com fome
Quem são esses moleques? Agora eu quero os nome

Os moleque é (véio)... hehe... aqueles lá
Os moleque que (cadê?)... nem sei falar
É os cara que (hã?)... daqui de perto

No kin to haters, grow big in layers
Grow big with labor, throw lasers
Rotators, De La Soul, say it
Don't ask for favors, they doing what they gave ya
They'll do you a favor, if they like your style
If you're worth your while, and do it all with a smile
Oh, you wanna be foul? You wanna step on toes?
You wanna go down the, treacherous road?
You hoping that it gets exposed?
Well, sorry to tell you, it always do, fool
But life continues just without you
Sorry fool, do it how you want it done to you
Though we all make mistakes, I do too
So keep that in consideration, it's true

And that's heavy

My raps is heavy
Dropping facts real heavy
As long as you let me

Sometimes you heavy
Somethings too heavy

Ain't nothing I can do about that, they got a problem
Ain't mine though, go figure it out and holler

My ID has flicked the switch, mixed the clique
You can't predict, I make the stick super slick like a pimp
Psychologist, rhymeologist right in his prime, I'm Parliament-Funkadelic braintelic
Started from the cellar but I ain't one of those relics
I'm among the stellar that's literal, critical thought brought me this far
I faced two bricks and tar, sadistic bars
May twist your lid off, escort a team that makes you feel like you're
Lord supreme, I support your dream
War screen, but your words gotta mean something
I see they whole team fronting on the scene stunting
Doing tricks which do me, it don't mean nothing
Cause I keep it simple, I don't need nothing
But food and shelter, music that melt your
Heart exterior. Get to what it really was
Feel me just a tad, you're brother's bad, meaning good
Sometimes I be in the hood
Let em know success you can see in the hood
And it ain't about money it's about if you did what you could",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-heavy-101-lyrics
Land of Immediate Rap Hits,Iller Than Most,UnKnown,"So far so good
Jumped out the wood panel like an X-Man
See if anyone could handle the best tan
Thieves I'm attempt degree silver belt
With iller modulating robotics watch 'em marching
With arms ready, A.I. smart and ready
Navigating through the darkness embedding
Heavy artillery is left for me, air assault
Flows hit the snare across the ass
And pause the ads as far as fads
That's them other fools
That utter rules and regulations but never face 'em
They damn self and felt as though they flow may dominate
The fold when I rhyme a phrase feeling some kind of way
Sitting scratching they head trying to figure out what I was saying
It's like they brain dead
Free your mind and the ass must follow
I'ma leap in time they caught in a pothole

Lost in the land of immediate rap hits
Here today and gone tomorrow
Cash, clothes, cars and money (x7)

I need to find a way out of this crazy land
Feels like a Lost in Space episode
With Diesel forced to play an extra role
Special guest star maybe, it could boost up ratings
We pop out of suspended animation
Mr. Smith colored us we ain't gonna make it
Busters just play they lame game of Simon Says
Cash out quick at the end
But I think quicker than him
I leave his ass trapped on a doom ship
With no BMI or Ascap
Furious creatures stare like they barely was teething
They never heard nobody flow like how I was speaking
Yeah from a foreign universe
Guess I always was true the first self
Fuck everyone else
Up on the bandwagon like a rescue ship
The guidance system failed doing that test tube shit
Soon as I rap explosives go off",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-land-of-immediate-rap-hits-lyrics

I sustain phatter blends of words heard, stampede

And nothing but the truth, I tell it to the youth
Propelling with the proof in the puddin'
Wouldn't you like to know? Oh, no you didn't
My flows never quittin' and that's the truth

A closed casket, the most massive fluff

Sever your crew with micro laser surgery
I get Adam split up like atoms like the Molecule Man
Now all of you stand like a congregation on the basement

Wrecking the Upside,Iller Than Most,UnKnown,"Frankly I don't understand why you hate me
If I'm that bad don't think about me
Only time I think about haters
Is when it's time to get that paper
And express myself
My sports is tuned more than nation wide
You watch hot, is that why so much hate is inside
Because you weak and you can't help it
And want to blame others 'cause you so damn selfish
I'll make you evacuate for months like LSD
Rip Van Winkle you come back guessing
Word force alphabetical rampage
Type raw cuts the scars issue a band-aid
Here prices run pretty high so don't try it
Anything in here you touch you break you buy it
I see a mouth spread sounds that carry far
You clam up you hide out but I feel something very odd

You wrecking the upside
Smoking the vibe
And sliding it on the downside

Huh, some victory
You ain't living in luxury
You keep trying to fuck with me
The situation cuts deep
For you, for me I couldn't give a shit
On my radar your ass not even a blip on it
So you tippy toe, expend hella force
Hella work just a little roast beef with the blow torch
I never see you in the street but I know you around
'Cause you do little bitch shit when I'm out of town
Feel dread can't live with the raw terror
You search for sleep, you can't 'cause your head hurt
Ow and that's fitting to stay pounding
'Cause you fucking up the game with your charades and prowling
You don't want nobody too engaged in violence

Esse é o esquema
Esquema nosso é dizer

Na considera, eu disse, na consideração
Buscando a liberdade na verdade do seu coração
Essa peneira na vida é rotineira
A sua identidade vai do seu poder de reação
Vou caminhando, seguindo a luz da lua
Vem sempre o sol, que vem depois da chuva
Vejo, no chão, essa cruz que não é sua
Depois do vento, a vida continua

Pra quem se recusa a viver na roda do rato
Pra quem enxerga o que acontece, de fato
Comida, pra vitrola, é disco no prato
Mas a música segue salvando, independente do formato
Seja no estilo braçal ou no trabalho mental
Cada um na sua área, cada um no seu quintal
Livre, se ajudando, como o pó do pólen
Disseminado na alma do ser humano (?)
Cada pedaço de chão, cada pedaço da (?)
Cada pequena missão que seja realizada
Cada surpresa da vida, cada carta marcada
Nessa caminhada
Caiu? Levanta, filho
Caiu? Levanta, filha
Cair faz parte, levante-se, é hora de... Para, para!
Mas, se é hora de seguir, avante!

Na considera, eu disse, na consideração
Buscando a liberdade na verdade do seu coração

Yo, touch the cusp of the funk, your fingertips do the walking
You seen in all my offerings, it's lingering when I'm talking
KP, no nonsense, I clean my house
Every room free of doubt
Outsiders keep out
Speak about yourself when you diss the nature
Of the game situation, something strange, it is in danger
I'm in my chamber that's fully designed for me
By me, why feed into the high society
Lifestyle, liken a lot to logic in limbo
I'm attuned to attitudes
Attack, they make amends for it
Processor, don't test it, no effort, I go get it
Roll wretched, dome checkers, sole reflection, on the record
Soul got no direction, it be a free for all
Seasons gone by, they still trying to please them all?
Huh, freezer thaw out just like neanderthals
No higher calling, they may as well dissolve

Dells Nightmare,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Let me tell you a little story about the slave master
Use a whip on your ass so you behave faster
You got chains on your neck, and the Man's respect
You'll work all damn day, but you will never see a check
In the field. Cotton you yield. Your skin peels off your back
From the crack of the whip. It won't heal
Ya wish you had a shield 'cause he wields iron
So when you act up, he smokes ya and keeps firing
And it's tiring
Forget about recreation
One wrong move and it's death you're facing
White motha fuckaz got the ball and chain
On your leg, and in the form of religion on your brain
They say, ""You the devil.""
You say, ""Who the devil?!?!""
Some of us was house niggers. Some of us was rebels
Some tried to get along the best they could
And didn't nobody use the phrase, ""It's all good!""
Would you? They got you living like a shrew
They throw you pig lips and chicken gizzards. Then you make a stew
They give us a white Jesus to appease us
We talk among ourselves and hope nobody sees us
They had our brothers beating us. Called us createns plus monkeys
They just junkies mistreating us
The master said, ""If you don't whip 'em, you're dead!""
It was fucking with his head, but he beat us instead
And we bled
Red blood flowing like a flood
Then he'd rape your mother. Stick her face in the mud
They were ruthless! If you tried to front, you'd be toothless
Some tried to run even though it seemed useless
Virginity was torn. Soon babies was born that was half white
And now his skin is kind of light
You think you're special, because they let you
Oversee the carnage? But I bet you
Will get hung, even if you stick out your tounge
'Cause they pull out the shank and stick it right through you're lung
Now it's 96 and white people say, ""Forget it
It's all in the past."" And some even regret it
'Cause they think we'll set it
Now my missions to get federal
So I can raise a black family with a true devils
And you know how that goes
(Chorus 2x)
The slave master watching over you
Always trying to tell you what the fuck to do!
The slave master watching over you
But ain't nothing gonna stop me and my crew!
This is for you kids trying to get signed
Just a little something you should keep in mind:
The labels are slave masters. Artists are slaves
Don't get too raunchy. They want you to behave
You get signed. You're thinking, ""This is great!""
But wait You never knew what was at stake
Creative control they withold
You sell your soul when you sign on the dotted line hoping to go gold
But you'll never see that, not without promotion
The label'll just throw your shit out, and got it floatin'
You think your shit is potent, but ain't nobody buying it
If they ain't never heard of it, ain't nobody trying it
If they ain't never heard of it 'your record' they murder it
You can complain. But they are not concerned a bit
'Cause when they signed you, they thought you'd make a hit
'cause of who you were affiliated with, and all that bullshit
Frustrations. All these rules and regulations
Just so you can have your shit heard by the nation
And be patient
'Cause by the time they find a lead release, your shit is ancient
You think they're working your album? You're mistaken
And if you flop, you get dropped
'Cause you ain't the star. You didn't go pop
Just straight up hip-hop. Time to get a mop
'Cause without no promotion, of course sales drop
Peep the break down: If tapes cost ($)10
You'll probaably only get to see a dollar in the end
That you cannot spend. Cause your budget gets recouped
So you never get cash unless your record is ""Shoop.""
You better hope you get shows, which will not happen
If you don't have a record that's the main attraction
Even if you sell a million, you'll get burned
Cause they keep half your cash just in case of returns
For a while, you wonder why rappers don't smile
'cause to them, you're not an artist. You're just another file
Another nigga used to make another buck
They don't give a fuck. And if your shit don't blow up, tough
But the star gets both promotion and devotion
From the whole fucking staff. At you, they laugh
The star probably don't know that he the house nigga
Thinking he bigger cause he's the, pick of the litter
These lebels think backwards. They push the acts that need it the least
So they can get all the money they can when it's released
They take you to a restarant for a feast
And then expect you to pck up the check?
That's why I give props to niggas who is independent:
'Cause they make they own money, plus decide how to spend it
Splendid.And lets end it
And don't get offended
(Chorus 2x)
The slave master watching over you
Always trying to tell you what the fuck to do
The slave master watching over you
But ain't nothing gonna stop me and my crew

When you place
Ya hands on her ass
In class, and give a spank
A banka full of fun
At recess, and be fresh.'
OK, I'll try it
And die if she does
But she did
And turned around and socked me like Rocky
I feel like a heel for real
But now I'm older
And told ya to keel over
Cause now it's different
No innocence
And women sprints the way
You sway to the forces of evil
And we will bust that ass fast and quickly

Now it's when they shit's come bobbin' brothers
Try and rob another
And I'll rub ya the wrong way

Mack you & attack you

Ya crew is on a mission
Every weekend
Freakin' & kissin'

Lets turn the sands in the hourglass
And your power lasts less & guess
& take a gander
I slander ya name & spread propaganda
And I demand ya ta stop
Hop on a train before pain'll
Be ya middle name
In the game of love & happiness
Yes, I caressed ya flesh
But if you test
Ya caught out there without a vest
Mess around and you can rest
I found a new boo boo

They might cause fright, they stick you up for Bally suede shoes
And in the news, and even on Geraldo
You can choose who will lose a pair of shoes (Yup!) word
The ones with the Reebok Pumps get their rumps rearranged
For their change now their down in the dumps (Yup)
You sprint two yards, to sport em on the first day of school
And like a fool, you went out like the worst way
They pulled out a tool, and asked you to remove them
Quickly, I told em not to do it and they hit me (What?) in the mouth
With the nine, I thought they was like kinfolk (punk)
I never thought crime would elevate up to Twin Oaks what
But hey, everybody is a victim
Hoodz come in dozens, the magic word is (stick em)
When they spot you and they got you and you can't deal with em
All because you spent two G's on your Boomin System
Loud enough for the whole block to hear
But now they caught you at the light and you're drownin in your tears
(Punk you better raise your ass up out this car)
(Come off the car punk 'fore your ass gets blast)
And never was your fault that your shit was expensive
You shoulda bought a vault, and now I gotta mention that
Hoodz come in dozens, read it in the papers
Seems like everyone caught a little vapors
You can't escape em, so don't even plan it
Gangsta Boogie fever has taken over planet Earth
Now your life is worth a pair of Jordan's?
Now I wear Vans and my fans think I'm poor
When I walk down the block, with money in my sock and shoe
I hate you Mista Gangsta, cause everyone is mocking you
Now I can't get no rest because your pests keep
Killing little children like their speakers are worth a million
Plus, it really is a bummer
Someone tried to get me for a coat last summer
(Your coat, check it in punk, hahah!) Damn
Hoodz come in dozens so watch your back
Cause they all on the attack and you'll never know
When they'll show up, but when they do
You better throw up your hands like a fan and surrender
Nigga don't be a pretender
You ain't the Hulk G
Give up the cash and all the big bulky jewelry
(All of it) *In what, daylight?* That's the plan kid
They don't even care if it's Candid
Because passerbys mind they own beeswax
So they like steppin to you like yo I'll take these blacks
Give up your cash and your jewels without a argumnet
Otherwise you'll catch one between the eyes (bang!)
Don't play hero, cause hero plus a bullet equals zero
Give up your dough and cheerio old chap
You didn't get a cap busted in your temple
See, it's just that simple
Remember that hoodz come in dozens
(You're god damn right)
Hoodz come in dozens
(like thieves in the night)
Hoodz come in dozens
(punks runnin out of sight)

Fragments - 2118741,UnKnown,UnKnown,"What up, G, what up G? Why you knockin' on the door?
No, you can't come in, heh, you can't come here
Yeah, the key don't work no more, yeeh
You fucking around, yeah you smarter than me
You smarter than me, hee-hee
I don't know, who now, how do it feels since you
No longer have connections, with me, you dumb in
Hungry and found this, you must be, your plan is vaulted
You don't wanna play a game, it only works when you young and beautiful
Now you should know - how neither of these herbs gassin' you
That would have you boosting clothes
Left you hanging, dry and stupid though
So know it's your turn, to play what you give for
Your brain's looping slow, you stupid hoe
Yeah, you should know, but the foolish don't
You don't get too close, cause you know the truth will show
Runner ability, see, is something I went through before

Yeah, yeah... I seen this movie before, it's weak
The plotline is very thin
Yeah, it lacks substance, very predictible
I give it a thumbs down, I give it a thumbs down
See, I studied psychology since a young'n
So I spot every move, you make
I may not see it clearly through all the street talk
You got beef, walk, yeah I love you, but not like that
You try to stop my act, with your high for looting, childhood retribution
It won't rest til you get, your licks in
Vixen Victoria's Secret stories, you keep within
Your witch's brew, for due -- you
Fancy as a, not too shroud, denial you choose
But your eyes on the glue, to your inner most
And, when I'm host to your bizarre sideshow, then expose for you

Yeah, cause remember the wicked witch
When she looked in the mirror, and then the mirror just shattered and shit
Cause she was so ugly and shit... but ugly in the inside though
See you don't dig me, when I'm saying that
You gotta feel me, when I say, that that's the wicked witch
You seem lost so why would you try deviating
From what would seem to be, the clear choice to making
Such a situation, such as this, now wake up
I play possible with you, but you gotta do what I say
But you gutter babe, through and through, you ain't have enough yet
Pushing pussy for product, having a good time is what you call it
All of it, washed away the mourns of an alcoholic
Now you out for my wallet, and give me a hard time too
Just to show me a thing or two, about, how low the low be
Well don't get cold feet, when you discover I hold heat
To melt that cold heart, that's so weak

You know... it ain't nothing but a thang
See, um, if you start, um, doing something stupid around here
I'mma come out there and I will beat a bitch ass
I will beat a bitch down to the ground
And, I might have to get some paper though
Cuz, since you out here already fucking other shit
Youknowhatimean, but, you ain't nothing though really
That's you though, you know?",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-fragments-2118741-lyrics
No More Worries - 1535170,UnKnown,UnKnown,"A-Plus:
You don't have to worry any longer. . 
Yo wait a damn, minute
Listen to the way the man spin it
Even with improper diction
I split in & gets ends
I'm lettin' suckas know
I'm fin ta buck a bro
The nigga figga he can dust a pro-
Fessional, I test a fool
I get a tool
And beat him wit it
He didn't see me wit it
And this is what I'ma do
Tie the crime to you
Niggas need to find a new rhyme to do
I remember when I used to grind a few
Indo sacks at my wack Sr. High School
But I told the Dean 'Bye fool.'
I graduated
He was a man I hated
And I'm glad I made it
Hie-ro
I know
You know
Fools know, that my crew's so
Phat, and niggas try to jack
Then I know they got my back
A-Plus must bust the wack
Casual:
I'm fed up with the wackness and this weak shit
So peep the style and learn how to freak shit
I hope, ya, learn how ta cope
By the time you peep this shit here
I'll be three times doper
Yeah, this is for the trendy G's
To ya bitches, & High School enemies
All the hoes
Shoot me to the left & shit
Cause my financial state was on defecit
But I
Really didn't trip
Now I'm livin' phatter
And then niggas don't matter
A lot a rappers try frontin' on me
Bet they ain't got nuttin' on me
And ain't no way that buck can harm me
I turn the mouths of MCs into molecules
Niggas locked onto me like my follicles
I swallow fools with no regurgitaion
We hurt ya face, men
When ya placed in my path

Del:
I bust asses
Ya slow like molasses
As this continues
Then you know the fastest
Computing, looting, I gets the root of things
Bitches with problems
I leave ya jaw numb
I slap hoes
My rap flows along
With the flow of the song
As I flow on the bong
I use Jedi mind tricks
To find tricks
Bind tricks, tie them up
Then I try and phuck then they die
And what do I care?
I dare hoes
And prepare flows cause I never spare those lives
Who strives
With knives & slice
I parylize ya twice
With fear
Del is nice to your ears
Snupe:
Not of hardest, artists going far
Jack off from Jupiter
Because I'm shooting for the stars
I'm a mack
Never come wack
Gimme a 30 second snippit
I'll rip it
Because the shit gets deeper
Creep ya ass as the floor rocks
We got the beat hittin' hard like four cops
Shorts out my last record
I write my rhymes nekkid
Let me give you a tip
I'm on the balls
So just expect it
My rep gets phatter thinkin' about those kids
They tried to step and got phucked like they momma did
By the Mr. Mostskill
I did ya hoe, still
She's askin' for waxin' and taxin' cause she heard a hoe squeal
Hoes I'm, getting more plays than Showtime
The demon got ya screamin' with no shine
No time for regular run of the the mill
I'm packin' with steel boy soldiers
Never no more the soul soldier",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-no-more-worries-1535170-lyrics

Up front, introducing my man Pep Love
(Pep Love)
My introduction:
It's such an unbelievable pleasure
For you to treasure;
And much needed too
Make it phat though
On another plateau-
You begining to begining to groove;
I do it natural
As we get Jazzy with classy shit
To make them hard ass rappers wanna blast me (buck buck)
Cause I exemplify a typified mac
In actin like the shit nigga
Mashin rappers with a passion
When I get Tip and Tribe flashion lyrics
I smash your spirits
Like a big disappointment
But this here shit will surprise ya
Devise a plan:
The pipsqueaks get tweaked
Cause of the size of demand
So if you wanna measure up
Then press your luck
Cause when I'm in the cut
Man there ain't no catchin up
I bet ya never heard a nigga with a bigga this flow
Bigga this bro
Gettin ate like a clitoris?
No
I never could'a seen it-
I rip a rapper's balls off
To make him scream when its convenient
Hear ye hear ye
Clearly we're the
Undisputed ones that you get mad at when you hear me
Pompous comp. just barely even registered on the meter
Cause we the niggas that they checkin for
Me and you or, you and him
Ruinin' them
Doin men in
When I'm cluing them in
On the one
(Del)
Ya two... three, four
(Q-Tip)
Now niggas know I got lyrics out the anal
And any move that you make could be fatal
The poet that shows it:
And some of y'all niggas know it when ya
Grab the mic and you can't recite
Yo that gets me irate when ya can't debate
But wait- Now ya niggas think that I'm ya runnin' mate?
Naw phukk that, 'cause when I grab the baton I'm gone (zoom)
All around the track like a runnin maniac (damn)
You babblin your babblin son; what the phukk?
Anybody here rap that doesn't go buck?
But can you grab the mic and kick ill shit? (like)
Stun'em with the verbs, instead of using clips
Check it: I flip styles by the dozen;
I-could-even-(too fast) that I was but I wasn't
You MC's are slipping into rigor mortis
Give it up please
And just support this;
I got styles that are legendary
Even in the clink
Lyrically I'm like
What the phukk you think?
Cause I'm down with the D-E-L
So what the hell?
(Del)
(Haha!)
I never come from the temple a simple rap
Cause your raps poor
I'm on track
I lap yours
Collapse yours
Elapse forever
You're never gonna get better bitin' my friend
But I lend a hand helping
MC's yelping like puppies (Arf! Arf!)
Their rhymes are simple
My rhymes are roughed up
Like a duffle bag
Mags on my wheels squeal
Peel out towards your head
While others bust lead
That's dead
I beat your head in the resin when the pipe hits the buds in my
Chamber
My rhymes are never tamer
Perpetrators I'ma hurt ya later/after
On the path of danger
I got fangs not bangs
Like a bitch which I use to puncture
With punctuation-
And mutation
Racin' like my thoughts
Bust shots to scatter
And my latter lets me elevate
Over MC's that are hella fake
My reaction to your rappin' is laughin
It has been for askin they get their ass kicked
Cause they're plastic
I'm bringing lyrical lacerations
That you're tastin
Painful I mame foes
Metaphorically
Historically used the hip hop
To make your neck pop
Naw the eyes cause I kick the modern style
(Modern style, haha!)
(Cut:)
The undisputed ones that you get mad at
The undisputed ones that you get mad at
The undisputed ones that you get mad at
When you . . . grab the mike and you can't recite",https://genius.com/Del-the-funky-homosapien-undisputed-champs-1560469-lyrics
