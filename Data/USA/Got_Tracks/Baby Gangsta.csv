Fuck Big Boy,True Story,1995,"I'm back again, reppin' and I got my four ten

Now the heat is on I'm comin' to get'cha
Went through the 17th and couldn't even find ya
Come to find out, that you were fat mouthin' and you'z a ho
The only time you seen the 17th is at a show
Jealous muthafuckas wanna be like me
I represent that 3, the capital T-E-C
You bitches better keep my name out'cha mouth
Before I get a bag of that fire and wait outside your house
Nigga, I catch a drain, ain't no motive, ain't no blame on what I do ya Cuz I'mma fuck over you
Now what's up? Cuz I don't think you ready to see no blood
Fuck all that asshole and leave ya fuckin' head swollen
I hit like floods, better yet, I stick like mud
Them bitches P-N-C, I leave'em in a pool of blood
Partners-N-Crime, y'all some bitches, y'all some snitches
You stupid clown, Chuck got'cha riches

Partners you bet not do no crime
Get no time and go to JAIL
Cuz in that two man cell, best believe you gone get NAILED
Mystikal you'z a ho, it's time I Iet'cha know
Y'all ain't ready for Local five, got a boot camp fulla hoes
I'm gat totin', ready to leave your heart open
Bullets floatin', hot nine chambers smokin'
Uptown, ya bound to get y'all wig split
Y'all represent a 17th set that don't even exist
Now that's a shame, you reppin' just to get a name
You can't survive in this game cuz you niggas lame
I'm ready to take it to some ""G"" shit, street shit
Where caps get peeled, and wigs bound to get split
I'm off Valence, ain't no doubt this B.G. ain't real
I'm bout to *hic* hiccup some bullets out my fuckin' steel
Peel, make niggas kneel, bow down
]From this clown that's gonna put you six in the ground
It's time a nigga put Big Boy where the fuck they belong
Rollin' wit Tec-9 snortin' dope best believe it's on

Partners-N-Crime you ain't nothin' but bitches
Lick on the nuts and suck the dick

Big Boy know, they ain't nothin' but hoes

You can jump up on this dick, like a morphodyke, BIATCH!


Say ""Ah ha, Ah ha"", yeah you thought it was funny
When you tried to rap, hunt, stunt, front, on Ca$h Money
You must have been jealous of that title that we holdin'
Try to rep on that Local 580
You must have been too loaded, too loaded, too loaded
They tried to pull a lil' stunt, on that Local 580
Wanna be Pimp Daddy, Lil' Slim, and Baby
They put that whole CMR all up in they rap
They had us on they first tape and they proceed to sweat
So let's show them wannabes what we made of nigga
Try to knock a B.G., I'mma spray a nigga
Swear to God you was hard, but you don't want none of me
Cuz I'm a little-bitty killa off Amelia East
So put two and fall, see I ain't with that boy
Cuz all I do is grab my 9 and break a nigga off
Somethin' proper, I will make you droppa
I'mma baby gangsta, not no P-poppa
This is dedicated to niggas that be fakin'
Tryed to rock the crowd for the turf but couldn't make it
It was complicated so how you gonna rock them?
While they was busy doin' the Hike and Eddie Bow'n
I'mma stand my ground even though you try to bring me down
Cuz I'mma Ca$h Money clown from that Uptown, and I'm bout it
Nigga you know you not bout it
Come around my way I'mma have to get ROWDY

Damn, I hate a busta bitch talkin' shit
But when drama time come they scared to do it
Throw them thangs talkin' hard in the Mic
Say it in my face, be a man, and let's fight
Take it to the street with a real baby G
I'mma show ya I came bust caps send ya six feet
I ain't bout none of that playin' or assholin'
Nigga I'm splittin' wigs, leavin' heads swollen
Mystikal slippin' and on the pavement you get laid
Light up through ya ho, I'mma grab you by them dookey braids
Put'cha head down, cuz I heard about'cha
In Desert Storm, Uncle Sam got that mouth up out'cha
So let me get that out'cha bitch
I'mma run in your shit, cuz I'm a 13th nigga and I'm bout it",https://genius.com/Bg-baby-gangsta-fuck-big-boy-lyrics

Do what'cha gotta do mane
Say what'cha gotta say Wayne

The rhymes you are about to hear are true

This some true shit

Shoulda killed you bitches when we heard that song
Tipped it on, talkin' bout 6th & Baronne
When the fuckin' lights on up early in the mornin'
All that muthafuckin' creepin'
Pissin' on the set when a nigga Dee, sleepin'

You know you can't survive
You was creepin' through that third, you must don't know it's do or die
Now that nigga on my list
A P-poppin' bitch no disresp

P-poppin', P-Poppin', P-Poppin' bitch no disrespect to the tenth
But there's a pussy in your face and they can suck and dick
Ridin' and slidin' with all that workin' and twerkin'
You can't be no ""G"", cuz a ""G"" not down wit jerkin'
Them niggas always comin' with that play
You want some real drama, why don't you bring that shit our way?
Cuz I'm a Baby Gangsta down for that street funk
Stuntin' in a concert, take it to the fuckin' trunk
Talkin' all that bullshit, talkin' all that shit on wax
Talkin' all that yak-yak, but I'ma split your Kool-Aid pack bitch
I got my pistol close at hand, this for the REAL
Real pussies in the can

The rhymes you are about to hear are true
This some true shit

Chuck fuckin' them niggas at niggggggggggght
They doin' bad and slangin' rhymes at the same time, ain't lyin'!
Now this nigga is a muthafuckin' dick beater
Heard at Corn(?) he was a muthafuckin' cheerleader
Fuckin' wit a B.G., best believe you will get served
I'ma leavin' ya muthafuckin' thinking cap on the curb
Chuck got some mail?  Cuz oh yes, I'm comin' to get'cha
And if I don't get 20 G's I'ma split'cha
I'm a murderer, server, nigga come try to test
Had to put'em to rest, no vest but one to the chest
But uh, you know you done fucked up don't cha?
Like Yella said, you mad cuz Ca$h Money didn't want'cha
Let's move across that water strapped with that A.K
They got some wannabe crips, wanna bang, go to L.A
Now you can claim, the East, North, West, or South
Mystikal fool, you can pump this dick right in your mouth
Them niggas be rappin', very much trippin'
Talkin' all that nonsense, slippin' talkin' bout they be crippin'
But it's like this, watch out before you get bucked
I'm tellin' coward ass niggas to raise up, raise up, raise up

At first he was a cheerleader now he ain't that nigga to fuck wit
That goes to show you studio yeah that nigga buck quick
You duck sick when I catch'cha, you best to start to runnin'
Cuz I'm comin', start duckin', cuz I'm bustin', and pluckin'
Fuck it
Chuck, you big trick, you hoe bitch
Puttin' stank hoes in apartments and shit
And ummm, them niggas who help you get the money you straight FUCK EM
When check time come, they gets nothin', you pluck em
And y'all hoes for lettin' him take it
Hard rolled and fake it
Niggas best to look like skatin'
Now back to this muthafuckin' Mystikal bitch
You wanna jump on a nigga like a morphodyke come jump on the dick
That's enough of this hoe shit on the real
If you don't spit ""G"" shit with skillz you can't pay bills I make mils
I close the shop for them niggas wanna shine
Sign on my nine when I put it on your mind into your spine
Don't whine, niggas can't handle me not hard
I'm the bitch who came to fuck up the party
When I catch'cha I'ma kill ya don't worry
This is another part of that fuckin' true story

Down for My Stacks,True Story,1995,"First Verse: {B.G.}
Ya see I'm not takin' no fuckin' shorts nigga come with it all
Yeah you got to stand tall and have yo back against the wall
Nigga let yo nuts hang it's that iron you got to slang
If some fuckin' drama jump act a fool with yo bank
Buck! Buck! with yo chrome blood gushin' from they dome
Got the company can't be safe carry 'em to they fuckin' drape
You ask for one simple favor come with all my fuckin' cash
Couldn't hunt two quarter front so I had to bust that ass
You went and got all my dope then you stuck like Chuck
Like Slim said don't take no loses that you can't make up
Verse Two: {E. Vicious}
See I don't want my 98 fuck with 99
I want all my fuckin' money but bitch you got to die
Nigga
Verse Three: {B.G.}
The game ain't the same you can't be lame
You got to be a true thug ain't let yo fuckin' nuts hang
A nigga like me want all my heat or I have to split yo wig
Stank bitch can suck my dick motherfuck a pussy pig
I straight handle my business and I strap my gat
Down Baby and Slim them old school gee's
Down for my stacks
Chorus: {E. Vicious}
I'm down for my motherfuckin' stacks

Verse Four: {E. Vicious}
It's some fucked up shit with all this fuckin' killin'
But I just sit back stack I'm steady hustlin' and chillin'
Watchin' niggas kill niggas over doppin' bitches
And these so called gangsters turned snitches
But I don't get involved with that dumb shit
I want the bitches, the riches and the power to run shit
So dog ass hoes don't even step to me
If you don't suck dick or pay bills you ain't no help to me
Top notch hustler I'm buryin' busters six feet under
Yeah I'm that nigga wonder and I ain't takin' shit
]From this crackers and jackers I'm on the come up
So bitches you can run up
Peep this situation about this bitch that I know
Never gave my play but heard me on the radio
She wants to know what I've been doin' all the time
You stupid bitch I know you heard I've been writin' rhymes
I'm the same nigga you wouldn't fuck with a year ago
Now I'm doin' shows makin' a little cash flow
Sport Girbauds walkin' like I got a attitude
You ain't know the Vicious on the come up move
Verse Five: {Baby}
My niggas gave me love my niggas gave me dubs
My niggas watch me come up from a motherfuckin' scrub
Verse Six: {E. Vicious}
So it's gonna be like that me and my niggas

Motherfuckin' brother I call 'em freaks under cover
See I can give a fuck about these dog ass hoes
Black I'm down for my motherfuckin' stacks
Verse Seven: {Mr. Ivan}
You know it's all about money bitch
Smokin' on that chronic gettin' buzzed out
Drinkin' on that gin and juice a blunt hangin' from my mouth
I sold crack from the time I was a juvenile
The money hungry nigga that wouldn't avoid a fuckin' p nile
Get out of jail I went to ballin' on they dog ass
Started sellin' hats I went to countin' bundles of cash
Got out of jail again caught myself a felony
I knew I should have listened to what the fuck my mama was tellin' me
Then seven months of fuck school and den I rolled out
Started missin' money so that's why the fuck I moved out
Cuz I'm a baby gangster fightin' to survive
When I close my eyes I got to make sure it's passed twenty-five
I'm on the map now to teach you'll a lesson
I'm bustin' caps, cops try'na take my Smith n Wesson man
Blok Boom on that ass again introduce you to a lil' friend
I swore to crack that I was gonna be gettin' paid fast
Gettin' paid cash then I blast nigga

Get on My Feet,True Story,1995,"Damn, it's hard, a baby gangsta is strugglin
The 9-5 done hit, it's time for me to start hustlin
I gotta get my serve on, them hoes look at me bad
My day 'bout to come, so I'ma bust out on they dog ass
I started wit a fifth and dime rock
Mook had gave me 20 for 10, I had two nines 'cause I pop
I made 20 dollars, best believe I went back
I turned my life of doin bad to a life a slangin crack
Now I got a job of pushin rocks up on the block
Plus that drama on my side is a fully loaded Glock
Half on sellin slabs, I went and scored a fuckin 8-ball
Nigga gotta stand tall, sort of like a brick wall
Meet me at V.L., it was a real madd clique
I whipped out a knot, them dog hoes got on my dick
Tryin to fuckin break me, them hoes used to hate me
I cleaned myself up, now them hoes cannot take me
87, Troy sat me down and they skooled me
They said don't tell my bid-ness 'cause a nigga would try to do me
This fuckin Baby Gangsta comin up in the streets
I'm on a come-up bitch, tryin to get on my feet
2x
I'm tryin to get on my feet, I'm a real baby gangsta
Bitch, you stop my come-up, then I'm gonna have to gank ya

The bid-ness flowin smooth like water
I got some fuckin clientele and it's worth three quarters
My mom fount one, but I was still on the road
I slipped in the game, they always said the game was cold
I was slangin them fuckin rocks, I made three G's at the most
Then I got caught slippin, he did it easy, one of my jokes
Now Slim and L.T. still keep the shit tight
But when my nigga come ??? everythings gon' be alright
Man, it's like this, the set is kinda pain
I'm like the fuckin Geto Boys livin in the fast lane
Mail, steady stackin
Them hoes a nigga mackin
And you know I'm straight up packin for niggas tryin to jack me
Now the fuckin law is gettin hot on the set
I'm playin it on the cool, gotta put away my tech
I'm chillin at house, bitch got my number when they fiendin
They call me all night, them motherfuckers be tweekin
Yes I'm on the block bitch, I sold a quarter-bird
Now have you fuckin heard, I'ma get it on my fuckin serve
A fuckin Baby Gangsta comin up in the streets
I'm on a come-up bitch, tryin to get on my feet
2x

Like Pac, I'm in so much pain
I'm broke, I'm slangin in the rain
14, strugglin, pocket full of crack-cocaine
Tryin to come up off a bill
You know I got them hustlin skills
The nigga from that V.L., Baby Gangsta, yes, you know I'm real
Down for the jack move, nigga like me is savage
Don't let me catch you slippin, I'll kill you wiz, I gots to have it
When I bust my 17, you know I'm gonna get ya
Split ya when ya holler, I know I hit ya
Yes, I know I'm fast, so I hit a nigga stash
When I hit this nigga stash, turn his stash into cash
I wanna stand real tall, have a bird for my own
When I have a bird for my own, gots to get my hustle on
So I'm on the block wit crack, you know I strap my fuckin gat
False move will get you kilt, rat-tat-tat-tat
So get back wit the gat, nigga don't move
I'ma take wit ya to the head
Make sure yo bitch ass dead
Then from the scene a nigga fled
I'ma real nigga, trill nigga, always pack a steel trigga
If you ever play me I'ma plug 'cause I'm a thug nigga
Youngster from the ghetto man, I ain't got nothin
I got a gat and a set of nuts, tryin to come up on somethin
So if you slippin on my hood black, I gots to creep

Hood Took Me Under,True Story,1995,"I got another gang story to tell
Peep, about how a black nigga was born in hell
And right then and there it's no hope
Cause a nigga can't escape the gangs and the dope
Damn! And when its black on black, that makes it shitty
Can't survive in the Compton city
And fool thats bet
Cause when you grow up in the hood, you gots ta claim a set
Geah, Its not that you want to but you have to
Don't be a mark, cause niggas might laugh you
Straight off the mutherfuckin block
Can't deal with bustas so they asses get clocked
Geah, who gives a fuck about another
Only got love for my fuckin gang brothers
Geah but I'm young so nobody would wonder
That the hood would take me under
(scratching: always strapped and eager to peel a cap
The hood done took me under.)
Now I'm a few ages older
Got hair on my nuts and I'm a little bit bolder
And puttin in work, I has to do my fuckin part
I'm down for the hood and its planted in the heart
Fool. At school slappin on the girls asses
Fuck the white education so I skip a lot of classes
Cause ain't no teaching a nigga white reality
Teach me the mutherfuckin gang mentality
Pop pop pop, drops the sucker
If he's from another hood I gots ta shoot the mutherfucker
Geah I'm in it to win it and can't quit
Fool, and ready die for this shit
One times can't fade the gang tuff
Puttin my foot in your ass to make times rough
I'm the neighbourhood terror but I never wondered
That the hood would take me under
Chorus:
+(police is hot, so I'm watching my back...)
I guess I'll watch my back cause niggas jivin'
Times heard this brother pulled a 187
Who I thought was my homie dropped the dime
So I gotta peel his cap with the nine
Fool, so if its on then its on, fuck ya G
Because how the odds are looking, its either him or me
So I loads up the strap and I step
Cause my brain cells are dead and all I think is death
Revenge. That's what its all about
See the sucker, take the mutherfucker out
Stare the fool down with the eye contact
He try to swing so I draw on him with the gatt
Blast was the sound that one times heard uh
Nigga 25 to live for the murder
Was it worth it I've always wondered
Maybe if the hood didn't take me under
Geah, this going out to all the niggas
It's going out to my niggas
Its going out to all the niggas

When you comin' to get me I got the four four
When you come to down me playa please don't miss
Cuz that don't do nothin' but get my trigga finga pissed
If I live I live, if I die it's cool
Cuz I know for sure when I was here that I was a fool
If you gone drill me come on and drill me
It's all good cuz I got some people to see
While I'm here I'm gettin' full all the time gettin' blunted
My company on the move we bought the benz 500
A.K.'s and Glocks, in the back the Lexus jeeps
Havin' big baller parties every other week
This is the clique nigga 2-2-6
Black Connection nigga again the code is 2-2-6
Droppin' dope hits, takin' a nigga bitch
While you're on that flight, I'm bustin' nuts in your wife
All assault rifles, the weapons that's on my team
S.K's, A.K's, M-1's and car beams
Fulfillin' dreams, goin' to the top nigga
Don't playa hate cuz we'll still hit'cha block nigga
Baby Gangsta ain't nothin' nice
A young nigga trigga happy that'll put it in your life
I ain't right, represent Uptown to the fullest
Finger on the trigga and I'm ready to pull it

Got my finger on the trigga, what'cha gone do?
What'cha gone do? Nigga that's All On U

Got my finger on the trigga, what'cha gone do?
Uptown on the way, Bitch so let us through
Got my finger on the trigga, what'cha gone do?
Downtown get out the way cuz that's All On U
You could, take it how you wanna, bring it how you feel
My niggas is conscienceless and we kill or be killed
Fuck doin' drive-bys man we do a pull up
The nigga on the passenger side automatically die
From several gunshot wounds to the head
On the scene he dead Chopper City niggas fled
Won't you listen to Ziggy get your car doors bullet proof
It's rainin' choppers so get a bullet proof roof too
You got yay? I don't know it nigga
Nine-six you gettin' nabbed so you best not show it nigga
Cuz that's when you blow it nigga
Your door get kicked in, we want your yay
High powered AK, false move and your face no trace

If you stingy gettin' plucked nigga that's All On U
Chorus
Street shit is what I'm into
You got it I'm comin' to get you
Don't hesitate nigga or the B.G. gone have to split you

If you playin' with me then them fifty shots gone stop ya
No bullshittin' nigga my dream is to make a mil
Paper chasin' ain't no fakin' playa haters get killed
Young trill Baby Gangsta into pimpin' them hoes
But before I trick the hoes my money goes to my nose
And fat opthimals, T-shirts and Girbauds
Solja Reeboks straight stickin' to the G-code
Uptown is the home of the car-jackers
Robbers, gangsta rappers, headsplitters and kidnappers
Better than seed, is the way I shop for that D
Not the 17th, the real niggas in that 3
Play wit em, hard head niggas they split em
Raw dope they sell it, I get it I can tell it
How it go, back up or get banged nigga
Street smarts the game nigga
Gotta let em hang nigga
Pussy nigga got beef wit the night creepers
Me, brotha and Diesel ridin' with them street sweepers
Old nigga wanna slang, without a clique?
He don't wanna share, so we gone ride on that bitch
We bout to turn your block to a war zone
I'm warning you to bring the little kids in they home
Cuz when we spin the bin bullets just get to spit
I gave you fair warning so if you hit you hit
Cuz I ain't slackin' when I do what I gotta do

Retaliation,Chopper City,1996,"First Verse: 
Scraped my elbow jumpin' the fence
Creepin' through the grass camoflauged lookin' for them
Cowards, non-believers, contradictors, I'm comin' to get ya
You try to frame me without the picture
Shit, I'm obligated, to be a Juvenile for life
It don't change robbin' shit in this game
I know you heard about that 7th ward, 9th and the rest
But who's down to knock a head off and wear a vest?
Take a flight through that Nolia and then see who represent
Not with them thugs ridin' wearin' them black reebok tennis
Niggas fifteen, sixteen, seventeen
Slangin' iron from that Josephine through that Melphanine
And would do almost anything to prove himself relentless
Like, a murder job and forgettin' the consequences
Hustlin' through the brick walls avoidin' the feds
Pushin' the dope steady duckin' blue eyes and curly heads
And he got caught and then start, runnin' with yo peers
Got swole and been home and now you back out chea
And that boyd that cha shot, brothas hangin' on the block
You don't know him but he know ya look you bout to get got
BOW!!!!!!  Laid out in cold blood on the Ave
Here comes the paramedics media and crime lab
Understand this is all he know and it's all he see
Which is why they known to be a Juvenile just like me
Would'ja see that my words were a little bit cold a little bit trife
Down with Tec Mafia Juvenile fa life
Chorus: 
Niggas.......they comin' to get'cha
You betta watch ya back before they muthafuckin' split cha (3x)
Second Verse: 
Ain't that cold?  I heard a nigga, downed my nigga
My partna just paged me and say they found my nigga
It's a bust back thang can't be no hoes
I got a hundred rounds plus for my Calico
Fa sho we get's busy, and leave that ass fonky
Full of that monkey and its time to act a donkey
I'ma go get in my all black fit, when I come just sit
Cuz if ya sit cha hit, if ya split cha split
If you die, you die
Take it ten for one, wave bye-bye wave bye-bye
You done took mine, I'ma take yearn
This is what'cha earn, chopper bullets burn
S.K. trigga clicker, the blunt-smoker lighter flipper
Paper chaser for six figures bout my issue
I'm get to split cha, get cha if you in my way
I'ma deal wit'cha, muthafucka take a picture
I'll wax that ass then tax on my yay
Today if play I lay with the A.K
To spray and lay down the snaps I get down
Niggas can't touch what me and Bun puttin' down
Now down and pump round and distribute kees
You sleep six feet I tear down the whole street
Wear down the family they grieve because ya flat
Bust ya head up leave ya deader yo blood redder
I done fucked ya set down nigga hut
Nigga what keep ya mouth shut retalitation is a must
Chorus
Third Verse: 
Dead ass nigga don't fail, no yellin', hit the door it never fail
Shippin' his ass off to Hell, still the killas left behind him
Can't find him cuz the nine flatlined him
Now Mister, murda master for the lastin'
Niggas tryed to swerve it past her, turned into a nervous bastard
The blaster the Cash Money clique'll shoot em up
And me all we had to do was boot em up
He got the buck now who the fuck want it?
I can't see it happen, clips be clappin'
Cappin' you til' you see through Bitch go ask B3 too how we do
Cuz me, you to one equals people
Retaliation also known as the sequel
It's X-rated, cuz the clique's made ten and now you throw the bitch
Like I got no fuckin' sense, and I don't so take that
A dead ass nigga can't talk, wave or blink back
Click!  Snapshot, to me your rap's not
That hot like a fat rock off a crack spot
In the back got a stable
That's able to crack a bitch with a conference table
Then choke her wit a jumper cable
A Chiefer that stay reefer mo blunted
One time a hoed stunted
We beat that bitch and right now no more frontin'
Niggas actin' all shitty, gettin' no pity
Cuz my niggas actin' pretty showin' many from our city

Bust a nut and I'm up, I'm the type that fuck and duck

Keep my nina for self protection

Just in case a reppin ass nigga wanna start reppin

I'm bout money and that's all we wanna see
And if ya creep nigga watch out for the B.G
Chopper City posse nigga, and we roll deep
4 deep in the black on black Caprice

Stop ya from walkin with the Calico, stop ya hoes
]From playin wit me, my nine stayin wit me
Niggas in banged up cars wit battle scars
With shit bags attached to they drawers
Take this time to pause
For the not so lucky
Weak like a sick puppy
Fools that lost they name in the game 'cause they wouldn't up it
Big money, heavy weight, make no mistake
Triple beam wit da lean, the man wit da cake
Shake don't stir my drank, nigga you ain't
Gon' get out alive without spendin five on somethin
If ya wanna keep ya heart pumpin

So Much Death,Chopper City,1996,"Verse 1
Every day I sit and wonder why I lost my daddy so young
Just reminence think how me and him had so much fun
Teach me man to man things bout the game
Let me know always let em hang be bout my change
Never thought death come closee to home I was wrong
Never that my daddy was going away I was wrong
Him and my momma went through they little stages
Always fight threw em out and made him walk the streets
But it was alright
Cause I knew he would be back tommorrow with the sorrow
She would take the frown away let him stay
All he wanted me to do was to be cool stay in school
But the dude that I hanged with rearranged the whole attitude
When he died I start hustlin' to get paid
I did the opposite I know you turnin' in your grave
When I pray I know you hear me at night
It ain't right but I ain't white
And all I got is the street life
I know you lookin' down sayin' you ain't raise me this way
Don't be mad we'll talk about when I come one day
Untill we meet I'll keep your name on the streets
From son to dad I love you rest in peace
Chorus
So much death up on the city streets
Untill we meet my soldiers rest in peace
Verse 2
I never understood life and how I got here
I just live and try to learn till it's my time to disappear
And see really where my homies at on the other side
Is there a heaven or a hell or is it all a lie
Make believe I ain't gone belive till I see
Is there really a heaven for a true G'
If it is I know 
Sterling
 made it, 
Pimp
 made it
My daddy made it, they was real but got player hated
Pimp your gone but your spirit ain't my nigga
You remembered as a legend couldn't nobody out rock it
You made that style that these rookies tryin' to imitate
They fake as fake I'm here to put them in they place
The one only pimp one gone stop tryin' to be him
And I got a Glock with seventeen for that dog pimp
Ester did Hec cause she took Kin I'm took her
When you get that he gone stomp you
And when I get there we gone jump you
Otis from the thirteenth bit the dust
It's a must we strap up and retaliate in a rush
Bust flush that beef like shit
Spend that bin just hit and hit till start the click
Sterling lived a soldier died a soldier
Had respect for knockin' heads clean off the shoulder
]From the magnolia
All the players from that U.P.T
1,2,3 that truth to the game rest in peace
Chorus
So much death up on the city streets
Untill we meet my soldiers rest in peace
Verse 3
Pay attention to this song
Once your gone your gone
It ain't no comin' back once your home your home
Every day I hit the door my momma preachin' to me
Doogie stop runin' the streets son do it for me
She know I'm bout money strictly about ballin'
The life your livin' I hope your daddy ain't callin'
That things I go throught I think restin' is best
I'm chillin' while I'm in flesh but I'll be happy when I rest
I got people to see, people to meet, people to greet
Just peep what the other world got for me
Is it joy like they see or nothing at all
I'm ball till I fall with my back against the wall
Chillin' on the block till the man come get me
Mark hold us a chillin' spot cause I bringin' blunts with me

Niggas N Trouble,Chopper City,1996,"Yeah, yeah, big Mac and the B.G. nigga
You can't see me
It's like that for '96 y'all
U.P.T. connect
Keepin' it real
Give a nigga respect
It's like that

Feel the wrath of a soldier, the Crescent City Jesus
I pack a tre-deuce, got a army 'bout the size of Beruit
We hit 'em
Rugged even if it's unplugged for thug lifers
We be the niggas leavin' slugs in ya crime cipher
Got the town locked with underground stock
Around clock workers to serve us
Responsible for many murders
I left your town with all the gold pieces
Shoot the sheriff to assure my family's convict releases
Payin' witnesses to hold they breath
Non-cooperation is only death, and no this ain't a phony Tec
I'm in a limo full of blow niggas
But I'm never high 'cause a leader gotta be up on his toes nigga
A trail of cops is followin' we start to swallowin' the evidentials
Keep supplier's name confidential
Crooked cops started buckin' at us
We made a turn to a dead end, but froze 'cause the cops had us
I grab the Tec and started buckin' back
'Cause I'd rather take half the force out before they pump a slug in Mac
The head shot took me under
I fell on my back, the last see is his pale face and his badge number

Came in the clear, slide it in, cock it back
Plot it out, I put me an extra one in
That's eighteen in the nine, I'm ready to discharge
That's eighteen for that ass, tryin' to play hard
Got the fat bullets, with the dent in the front
They get sent when you hunt when I bend from the blunt
Nigga don't let me get that first draw, and I'm up close
I'ma shoot'cha in the jaw first, then get some more
You know I bust heads, gotta jack it like a London Fog
I got the bulldog sendin' niggas to the mall
I send death threats, and then I fulfill 'em
Two hoes think they'll survive the trial bein' a witness but I'ma kill 'em
My nine milli' is the nigga on side of me
Hollow points is for devils that wanna follow me
Try to swallow me under Providence Memorial Park
I'm too smart to be caught, 'bout to snort what I just bought
Take a ride
With the chopper lookin' for the robber on the other side
I'm so high, and the motto Uptown is do or die
Let's make it happen, take it to action
Fuck rappin' I'm cappin', fuck yappin', gimme no dappin'
Pull out the strapin' and start bustin'
Show me you bout buckin' or duckin'
'Cause I'm sendin' 17 slugs I'ma thug
All about sellin' drugs, nigga you get plugged
Get out the way, of the race, it's a big paper chase
You get the taste of the choppa strikin' you in the face
Get out the way on the double, I bust ya bubble
I'm behind the trigga, so niggas in trouble

T-Shirts and white caprices, my Daddy used to call him Jonny
I never thought the snake muthafuckas would be behind me
They took a shot nearly blind me
My eyes rolled like a zombie, my life started seemin' timely
I can't believe it, Officer Friendly, he put a slug in lil' McKinley
I'll be a memory, but I ain't havin' it
Fightin' for my life, the people grabbin' it
Just enough strength to pull the trigga once more
I hit his cabbage and he dropped like the Valujet
I heard a nigga say he wasn't dead yet
They shouldn'ta have never said that
My life came back, like some supernatural shit
I stood up, and took the bullets they was hittin' me with
Grab the dead cocked Glock out the holster
Pointed at the rest of them and said muthafucka I'm a soldier
You can't kill me
They said we'll see
I said nigga feel me, and hit em with the nine milli', ya heard me?
I took my vest off, and threw it on the pavement
You never see the Mac's assassination, nigga it's like that

Get out the way or get caught up in serious gun slangin'
'Cause the shit that I'm bringin' leave a busta brains hangin'
'CauseI ain't half steppin', when I come for the chop
I clock, meal, and rob, Black Connection is the mob
That I'm married to, TRU to life real niggas
Young niggas comin' down wit shit you could feel nigga
Peel niggas wig off, soft nigga play hard
But I see through you muthafucka I pull ya card
Representin' I war and die for this rap game
It's the only thing I know besides hustlin', so I do my thang
Done crossed the line with niggas I thugged with
We run blood out'cha body, nigga we thugs, shit
So give us respect because we comin' direct
Totin' Tecs through projects that leave a nigga wet
Baby Gangsta gat packer, watch my back for the jacker
Then Blacka tryin' to attack and release the ratta-tatta
Leavin' lifeless? No, never
I reverse the game in a double, I bubble

Hard times got a nigga in all black
I'm gonna jack for that silver pack where it's at
I need a hit nigga
I can't quit nigga
Get in my way and your shit get split nigga
Uptown is a cage for monkeys and killers
Got to be realah around all these guerrilas
But it's cool I'm a young thug nigga
Rough like a rug nigga ain't scared to plug nigga
I was turned out at an early age
On V.L. not afraid the rocks and the twelth gauge
Raised like a slave caught up in that thirteenth cage
On that dust ready bust
Plus blunts got a nigga don't give a fuck
I hope you got your vest on
If you don't when the K blast you won't have your chest on
Nigga now you get your rest on
Brains blown gettin' a yellow tape zone
Motherfucker

What the fuck is it Uptown keepin' me doing bad
Is it the silver packs Is it the nickel bags?
What the fuck is it Uptown keepin' me doing bad
Is it the twenty sacks ? Is it the silver packs?
What the fuck is it Uptown keepin' me doing bad
Is it the dime bags? Is it the nickel bags?
What the fuck is it Uptown keepin' me doing bad
Is the silver packs? Is it the twenty sacks?
Verse 2
All I wanted was to be comfortable with a lot of mil
(million)
And I'm risking going to jail and gettin' left stale
I'm gettin' tired of this all day block shit
Cock Glock with this rock after rock shit
Could it be me servin' for twenty
2-5, 11-5, or the muthafuckin' even 5
And I'm servin' 4 and a half to 28
And I might front it if you come straight it and not late
Try to play me I'm gonna bust your muthafuckin' grape
I ain't gonna be stingy with the yah because I ain't fake
But now all I got is the nikel piece now
Struggling with it tryin' to get on my feet now
I'm on a hunt for some A-K funk
Double barrel pump full of that skunk ready to pop the trunk
Over this nigga they got a contract
I gots to have that give me the mad mask in the all black
Muthafucker

What the fuck is it keepin' me Uptown doing bad?
Is it the silver packs or is it the nickel bags?
What the fuck is it keepin' me Uptown doing bad?
Is it the twenty sacks or is it the silver packs?
What the fuck is it keepin' me Uptown doing bad?
Is it the dime bags or is it the nickel bags?
What the fuck is it keepin' me Uptown doing bad?
Is it the silver packs or is it the twenty sacks?
Verse 3
My pockets empty and I'm loaded that just don't match
Two and two together that's why where the fuck I'm at
On my ass tryin' to make a power move
Servin niggas two birds of flour it's sour but it's a come up fool
I'm on that dope it ain't no secret but that shit ain't shive
How am I stay high stay shive and get mine
I can't do it so I gotta try to kick the habit
Or that million I want I might not never have it
So I got to try to keep my muthafuckin' nose close
Or I'm gonna end up drove with no hoes
It's all about the fuckin' feddy, the mil
The eight, and the seven grams that sale on the scale
I can not fail to hit the top of the charts
Young with heart I survive off street smarts
Play with me clips slide in the K
Play whit me I'll spin your bin every day
I refuse to lose I paid dues to jump
I'm on a come up I I got the twelth gauge on pump
Busted heads clips thrown my way
Bustin' heads to let you know I don' t play
I'm out to have things I spit rhymes to get down
Hands clap when I get down doing bad Uptown

What the fuck is it keepin' me Uptown doing bad?
Is it the dime bags or is it the nickel bags?
What the fuck is it keepin' me Uptown doing bad?

Waaaahh
I know a lotta people waitin' to hear my side of the story
Ok imma get to you
I know is a lotta talk about the hot boyz reunion
You know this gonna be the biggest thing since the beatles
You already know
But before all that imma get something off my chest
So listen, listen...

Imma take this time and tell my homie what's on my mind
Go swallow the pride put the eagle to the side
We both was young and raw
This was in '93
You study in ? I study in LV
Now we while rappin' we while rhymmin' in they given time
Sometimes I stay in your crib sometimes you stay by mine
You stay in 17 i stay in other line
Next thing you know we was being race in down to trive
After that you did it rappin' pull you out the group
Then i was force to step up and do it for me and you
Streets wanted wonderin' what they gon' done with us
Cause i dropped Chopper City and they only wanna be one of us
You went to school i was in the streets being tall
Rabbit pass and ? ? change your heart
Clique got short
They started to fall apart
Baby clear house he was fresh in a baby show
I was out the hood ain't no where a nigga to be on the charts
I wrote about what a saw yellow tape and white ? (murder)
You been my lil' nigga more like a lil brother
You always be my brother from another mother
You know the talk we have when you met me in a show
We sit here my homie and kick this on this old folk
I'm still the same nigga
I'm still the same dude
But I unapreciate niggas me to ain't from me to me and you
I remember the Hot Boyz when it nothin' has stopped us
I never told you but i'm proud on everything you accomplished
Baby you know we was riders you always say you got us
I have no choice but to leave because Baby you broke your promise
But this is right now and that was back then
Oh we was Hot Boyz but now we are some ""hot mints""
The streets want us again the world want us again
Juvie i love you can't wait to Turk come home from pen
Even go for by 6  they want it to do 10
We miss em in the hood and they miss em in the bricks
Fresh i love you for life man i love you to death
This other producers cool but to me you the best
Rest In Peace to the sister
? sister too
Me and Tamara grow up together i miss her too
This time I open my mouth i promise to tell the truth
Streets always asks what happen but if they only knew
You want the real Imma get you the real
No cut all raw imma tell it how it is
Nigga Juvie my dog Wayne my dog
Turk be home in a minute in the steel my dog
You want the real Imma get you the real
No cut all raw imma tell it how it is
Nigga Fresh my dog and Slim my dog
Ain't never gonna be a group like the fuckin' Hot Boyz

Bitch ya must be crazy, tryin to glaze me
Wanna rep, lets see ya play me
Ya get left under daisies ho, if ya tryin to fade me
My old ho, I had to ex the bitch, she got grazed
When a nigga sprayed, so get on ya way, good day
I ain't no good, I'ma dog anyway that's bout pimpin and livin
Gots too much game to be slippin
No trickin, just dickin, pussy, I gots to have it
But before I get money, I supply my fuckin habit
B.G. jockin? Never, bitch you can't handle
Have fakes and they done, the bitch gets ass broke
That's how it is, all my hoes get bounced
I knock the pussy out, then I shoot straight for the mouth
It's no doubt, I gets dirty, say bitch, how you figga?
Call me a real ass, dog ass, dick servin nigga
2x
I don't give a fuck about a ho, cause da bitch ain't shit
A ho 'gon be a ho, a bitch 'gon be a bitch
Stay above da ho, don't love da ho
If ya a thug, when it's over, you'll shove da ho

Nigga kill dat conversation bout yo ho you say I fucked
She tryin to duck
But I fucked and nigga what
You trippin on my set and you disrespectin
Nigga better steppin fo' I leave dat ass wet and
You upsettin my fuckin nerve, I relent, that chopper leave you wet and
Knock yo shit loose in a second
Pussy protectin, I fuck baby mamas in this section
Concert reckin, Bill Board chartin wit Black Connection
In affect and chopper totin, put ya coke in
Them niggas from China bringin it in on a boat and
I snort that dopeman, but I ain't broke man, I thought you knew that
I dress in black, who dat, gon' do dat
Knock yo crew flat off the top, I get high and shoot back
Knock yo crew flat off the top, don't know why I do that
Tryin to get my loot fat, then I take it to the street
Interrupt my paper chasin then I'll take ya to the street
Ain't no fakin, nigga I'm erasin playa hatin
Rapin ya for ya life
Tryin to earn OG stripes
You hoes know you be feelin me
Trill nigga, real as can be
Yo ??? get spilled nigga
Cash Money Records representin to tha finish
Beef we winnin, cause we stay spinnin a binn and
No laughin no grinnin, no he-he, no bullshittin
Respect my mind, I'll put ya life to a endin
I don't like these messages through these hoes you be sendin
Approach me bitch, we both supposed to be men and
I got the Mac-10 and the Mac-9 and nigga try me
Drama to Cash Money, Hot Boyz, that's a hobby


I ain't lovin no mans daughter, I fuck a ho and ride
I stay high til I die, I lay dat pipe down then bye
You could try to get some snaps, but it ain't no haps
I fuck white, black, Hispanic and japs
My dick is made of iron, once it's rock, it's on
Hit a bag of that bomb, break ya off then bring ya home
BG and L.T. be teamin up and trainin
I toss a ho, he toss a ho, Cash Money, weed, and drainin
Stay in line ho, get ya mind right bitch
Keep ya mouth shut, get smart, nigga off in ya shit
That's how real niggas play it
All these rookies can't take it
Ya'll outdated, CMB can't be faded
Take it how ya wanna, bring it how ya feel
Hardest Hot comin, ho I represent the real
Bat a bitch up, Smack a bitch up
Get buck, try to rush me, I'll back a bitch up
Serve coke by the pound, B.G. get down
V.L. locked up, he'll touch down
My motherfuckin round
Uptown is where I'm from, V.L. is where we be
A.K.s is what we pack, the title is B.G
Head bussin niggas, examples we settin
All these fake niggas threatin
Lettin these hoes disrespect 'em

Money makin' is my thing
A mill is what I'm tryin' to reach
Good shit to my peeps is what the fuck I preach
Baby Gangsta is my title
Al Kapone is my idile
To protect and serve
I roll with my assault rifle
Jack niggas for nothin' less than a quarter key
Take hits on buster niggas..... startin' at five G's
Oh, I'm the young nigga dressed in black on black
With Glocks to mack in the hoop in 'dis black on black
Spillin' brains ain't nothin but a thang to me
Sellin cane and fame ain't nothin but a thang to me
When you see the B.G
I run wit' all real niggas
Valence and Magnolias
It list nothing but trill niggas
And we get ill, tryin' pay the bills, nigga
Use the skills to hustlin to make a mill nigga
For information w'ere beachin' to make you squeel nigga
Don't spill, we use the index finger to kill nigga
How u feel gettin caught up in my paper chase
Ya' feel the deal gettin caught up in my paper chase
Go out the way 'for my pockets to be nice and fat
I tote that K 'for my pockets to be nice and fat
Picture a nigga from uptown wit' a million
Actin' bad, buyin' motherfuckin' buildins
Get out the way or give your cash to me
You see, I bring heat backed up by B.G
Young niggas gettin busy
Totin' K's like it ain't nothin'
Uptown niggas buckin' like it ain't nothin'
Baby given coke to the young soldiers
I told ya we takin' over
Knockin' heads off shoulders
Think you boulder cause you older, but I'm colder
With the trigger I'll run all over ya'
Niggas talkin' yat and stuff
Wan' be rough, but I'mma see if you can back it up
Wan' be tough
Let's take to a triller level
Let's get iller like a guerilla
On the killer level
Just fuck wit' me that's all I'm wishin'
I'mma dust ya'
Because I know you're softer than whoopie cushion
I be dishin' clips in and out like a ??? cat
Come from the back in black
Ready t-t-to attack-tack
I'll leave 'ya flat, nigga

I'm tryin' to be cool in this game
This shits nothin' nice
Play wit' niggas 'dese days

But I say fuck 'em all

Five feet eight inches tall
My back against the wall
All I do is fuck hoes
I got dreams to make a mill
Like them niggas in the nolia
The hustlin' skills pays my bills
But still keep my hand on my Glock just in case
Niggas try'na plot seventeen shots gonna stop
The many tracks and that's a fact
Leavin' niggas on they back
Bitches play goin' get smacked
Espicially if I don't disrespect you
And you disrespect me
I'mma have to show 'ya

Livin' uptown you got's to flight
Be down to take a life

Young ballers stay shop
Hip ringers and chip phones
Hoes on my bone

Lil' Gang be my click
Back to this gangsta shit
I'm movin' six tryin' to get rich
Do my dirt in the bricks
Not where I lay my head at
Small baller beleive that

Dressed in black
Two gats a Glock and mac
You got's to play it like that
When you serving 'dem sacs

That's how Ca$h Money Hot Boy$ play it
That's how Uptown Hot Boy$ play it
We gone lay it down

Washington and Freret on Sunday, they buck, jumpin
Niggas on seventeen stuntin', the second line's comin'
The Hot Girls out, the Hot Boy$ out
We in top of the line cars, Uptown boys out
For sixteen, I'm ridin' flyer than ya Daddy
I play a different car everyday, ya Daddy in the caddy
The fuckin' feds snatched me
Picture they thought they had me
The B.G. shinin' so hard them dicksuckers tryin' to harass me
But they let me go, cause we way ahead and smarter
Keys come from overseas in a submarine under water
Still 'gon ride the Legend Monday, ride the Lex Tuesday
Ride the Benz Wednesday
Under the seat is the uzi
Ride the Camaro Thursday, Nine two nine Friday, Saturday
50 shots set it off for niggas tryin to carjack me
Sunday I lay on Washington-uh with a fifth sippin' wine Holmes
All week I gotta get my shine on

Get your shine on, get your shine on
All day long, I'ma get mine on
Get your shine on, get your shine on
All day long Baby get his shine on

Seven days a week, I'ma get mine on
Get your shine on, get your shine on
You niggas need to know, the World is mine Holmes

Now all these cars, and all these broads
Nigga, I'm bout to get my shine on
Now I'm in Club Whispers wit a $10,000 bar tab
Hoes think I'm jokin', stupid hoes wanna laugh
I'm bout to lay my stunt down before I leave this bitch
And one of you other niggas hoes gone suck my dick
Now every car I ride in got chrome on it homie
Got a mouth full of gold, to show Uptown soul
Plug hoes And make more money independent, than a major nigga done went gold
I got a million dollar rang wit a 2 million dollar mouthpiece
And quick to lay a bitch on these satin silk sheets
Now nigga, Rufus Playin in the Lexus, Gangsta got a Q-5
If anyone of you broads know Baby know I like to ride fly
B.G. got a nine two nine, Mannie Fresh got a Camero and a seven thirty-five Now me Baby, big body Benz Expedition, my black cat and my Lexus my friend Now I could change a car for everyday of the week And have a matching bitch in the passenger seat
Seven hundred Gs stashed away for my son
So when he grow up he can have a lil fun
I'm still sellin keys, stackin Gs on the D.L
I stashed a million under the barber shop on V.L
Nigga I ain't no rapper, I'm a game spitter
Ten Gs a show On behalf of Penalty, Ca$h Money, Tommy Boy, Warner Brothers nigga


Can you fuck more bitches
Than the sea got fishes?
Can you do more hoes, than the Feds got snitches?
I ride Lexus land wit the TV playin
Gettin head, fuck a Fed with the phone in my hand
Nigga's gone shine, what you see is mine
Rolexes, went to Texas, Motorola, Alpine
Woodgrain Hummer, hoodrat plumber
Hot Boys got toys, number one stunters
I know you bitches can't stand me
Lexus wit da candy
Blowin on blunts, sippin on Brandy
Now that's a good call Papa cleaner than ya ever saw
929 wit the mirror bro Tint it up, juice and Gin it up, send it up
To Texas, get the wood with the good weed, bend it up

I like to look good, be sharp, on my side keep my iron on
Playa haters wanna steal ya when ya get your shine on
But fuck that, I'ma get mine on
Chrome on the 929 wit my Primeco phone on

It ain't no secret, I'll bust ya dome Holmes
B and Slim give me a 20 G loan
So I could get my roll on
I know my niggas ain't gone tell me hold on
They let me write the Cash Money check, they sign it
I cash it, I spend it
It's all good, we ride fly
Benz, Lex, Expedition
No doing bad, fulfillin dreams and wishes
Payin all my college hoes tuition

  Wuz happenin' (Wuz happenin')
B.G. 'bout to run it
  B.Geezy in here
  Ya ever wonder...how they be broke--
( Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful) --and loaded?
( Run it to 'em )
Put two and two together ( Think, nigga)
Ya gotta maintain ( Ya got to maintain)
Ya either gon'...have things ( Have things )
And be sober, or be loaded with nothin'
( For sho' )
Off top ( Run that there )

I live rough - I done had enough of doin' bad
If I can recall, all my life, I've been on my ass
Unlock a bitch, and his wards are the graveyard
And in my ward, you can't help but to come apart
And all my boys got beef on the fuckin' block
And they draw heat from them niggas, plus we duckin' cops
I try to clock 'cause that's all I know and slingin'
But I got my Glock 'cause ain't no hangin' there if you ain't bangin'
Gunshots be ringin', but I bump and bust 'til I let 'em know
I ain't no ho, and I ain't 'bout to start bein' no ho
I smoke herb tryin' to calm my motherfuckin' nerves
But I'm stressed, and so (???)'ll leave ya on the curb
I asked a nigga that I know to front a quarter bird
But I smoked dope again - he said that's what he heard
Now that's jeopardizin', that nigga brains blown away
Niggas playa-hatin' - What kinda shit is that to say?
Fuckin'-up my pay, better get a nigga straight (??)
In a hurry
I'll have your mommy black eyes blurry
You better worry if you're dippin' your nose in mine
Got these hoes in line, now these niggas gotta get in line
I can't mind dyin', where I'm from, I live by the iron
On the block of Valence and Magnolia, it's hard times
(Hook )
I be loaded, thinkin' of Range Rovers
Maybe I could get a Range Rover if I stay my ass sober
I be loaded, thinkin' of condos
Now, maybe I could get a condo if I keep my nose closed

Maybe I could get a Range Rover if I stay my ass sober
I be loaded, thinkin' of condos
Maybe I could get a condo if I keep my nose closed
I be loaded, thinkin' of Range Rovers
Maybe I could get a Range Rover if I stay my ass sober

I want it - I'm pickin' your lock, comin' through blastin'
Gotta feed the animal - this bitch gots to have it
Where I'm from, there's no jive and you must be a survivor
Niggas ain't relyin' on no nine-to-fiver
Ruckus, beef, the ghetto is all I know
Hunger, no feast is all a young nigga know
Blow, get tore down, get a stressed nigga through
And this K will slow you down - any vest it will go through
My hood is tainted-up, it's full of pollution
Snortin' was last year - now a motherfucker shootin'
Stickin' they arm up, not givin' a fuck
Tryin' to jack the armored truck, not givin' a fuck
Around my way, it's a residential project
We all thuggin', so just look around and see who die next
Man, I'm out the Melph - What am I supposed to do?
Stand alone, gotta watch these niggas close to you
I'm rappin', now I'm makin' money - I can't duck my niggas
Get vacated, don't come around to say fuck my niggas (Enough of that)
The same niggas that'll drown in that water for me
Slow down, and'll spank a nigga daughter for me
We still clique - everything you break, you can't fix
We caught up in the mix, but V.L. still the shit
I represent mine in every motherfuckin' rhyme
You can't stop crimes 'cause Uptown is hard times

I be loaded, thinkin' of Range Rovers
Maybe I could get a Range Rover if I stay my ass sober

Maybe I could get a Range Rover if I stay my ass sober
I be loaded, thinkin' of condos

That heroin hit my block; opened it like a earthquake
Niggas graduatin' on they fifteenth birthday
Some snortin', and some spikin' it
That shit be cut heavy, and them niggas still be likin' it
That (???), that shit is still sweet
But you gon' get your money's worth in that Saint T
Or on Philip and C., or atop that CP3
But the B.G....workin' on kickin' that D
Now, can I...collect my gain? Stack my change?
Can I...maintain and do this rap thing?
Yo, can I...kick it?

Yes, you can

Well, I'm gon' kick it - You bitches understand?
I'ma get my n's deep and...buy me a truck
Get high, get up instead of walkin' with that duck
I'ma let mine hang - let the Desert Eagle sing
Let it be known all over, it's a Uptown thang
Fulfill my wishes...with my hand on my nine
Push that big Expedition and get through hard times, nigga

Ready for combat
Fifty shots in my gak leave a bitch nigga wet
Flat wit a bars head what you know about that

Wear a vest you could do that
I got some bullets comin' through that
Two clips taped together full off hollow tips
The Glock nine automatic freeze the beef with the wimps
I fuck wit' ballers and pimps ask Suga Slim and B-3
Fresh ordered twenty keys turned them over to me
Hot Boys and I'm gonna put in that UPT
For shittie, get wit' me, og's falls for halves

I got my AK nigga, and I'm quick to blast it
Game tight like elastic
Wit a block ??? murder jack it
Eraser, Baby Gangsta, V.L. nigga
I'm on a trail to Hell, before I go I want 6 figgas
Uptown is where you catch me doin' dirt, gun slangin
Nuts hangin, for sho, play me short and I'm bangin
I ain't no ho, my heart don't pump water, it pump liquor
Watch your step, I'll hit ya, I promise I'll split ya
Click-Clack, everything I pack got hollow slugs
I'm the definition of a thug
My whole click sellin drugs
Ain't no love, if ya outside the CMB
We risin, drivin Lexus and big body
Got them whole thangs for ten a key, niggas think we tellin tales
But on the real, we got whole thangs for half a sell
F.B.I. tryin to nail, but our click covered up smooth
Whatever you do, or how you do, it's all on you
Hot Boy, 16, playin wit G's
This rap game is the life, nigga ya wouldn't believe
What I go through and what I see, it's amazin
On the slick, thirty six ounces, top twenty, I'm calculatin
Hoes catchin masturbation, shit's a trip
But I'm bout moola, fetti, cheese, green, my grip
Nigga don't slip, cause i got 10 clips and I flip for it
Nigga believe I'll rip a nigga shit for it

In my city it's a struggle, you hustle to live large
But you step or get stepped on, times is hard
Shit get real, head get bust, blood spill
It's bout havin thangs, that's why I want a mill (2x)

Nigga don't you trip cause I done came up on a lick
And I'm servin thirty gram ounces for six
I got the block sewed up now, come to me
I'll take ya to B., he went down to ten a key
We got coke floatin through that U.P.T
Glock totin, locin, in the GS3 bubble
In the Lexus 450 Cruiser, block bruiser, nigga don't let the age fool ya
Head bussa, Hot Boy, young baller
The AK I pack is used for manslaughter
My mind is to be respected, or ya neck come off
Cause Uptown, there's no hesitation to set it off
Load it up, release safety, and bust
Retaliation is a must, I don't give a fuck
I'm checkmatin niggas, that's on the real, so wuz happenin
I'm full of that dope, scratchin, and I'm bout that action
Is you bout that action, if not, clear a path
I'm mad, I jacked a nigga and an ounce is all he had
That's sad, you stun'n, jepardisin ya wig
Doin' that petty hustlin, ain't comin up on shit
What's the reason, bein on the block all day
You ain't got nowhere to lay, that nickel and dime pay
You'll do better grabbin a K., bein ready to spray
Make a muthafucka day, nigga be ready to spray


Spark the beef up like a lighter, i'm a gangsta rap writer
Everytime I spit, I get tighter and tighter
Keep it real when I flow, hollow points I throw
Quick to chop a nigga down like a fuckin lawnmow
Playin a flow over the limit, in this music business
Come wit shit, ya gotta listen, til the fuckin song finished
Young menace, sport girbauds and reebok tennis
Nigga know if I got beef, I spin a bin, spinnin
Can't calm me down, cause I'm from Uptown
Call me, it's war wit an army, wit tommy guns
Wit drums, a hundred plus shots comin from 'em
I don't give a fuck, if I did 'em, then I done 'em
Take notes, bitches always try to be close
Silent when you got money, but naughty when ya broke
Bustas wanna be ya boys when they know ya got coke
I stand alone all the time, bitch niggas catch a poke
I hustle hard for what I want, if I don't then I'm a broke nigga
Wit no money on my block then you a joke nigga
I rap now, I put aside that coke nigga
But if I gotta, I grab my ducht tape and my rope nigga

My gun clap in it start spinnin' and take many
Plenty of slugs hit you

Fourteen year old black master million dollar flapper
Watch me set it off wit' my sawed off jumpin
As I be when I be pumpin
Frontin' gets you nothin'
Runtin' catch a slug from the M-what'n
You ain't bout natin'
Playa hater leave you bloody

But ya' still hear me
Four steps comin' quickly
Can you feel me
Better kill me before you get done in
It's real dog
But I got that red mark so when you come in
Slugs somethin', seventeen up in the clip
I keeps extra hollow tips for the crum rip
Should of chop-chop stop yo' whole block
Let's get funky, you want me, I thinks not
So much black clothing you may think its a black-out
All the lights go out
That's when all yo fright come out
Bloody streaks to the UPT where you lays on
I praise on, think you plays on, it's stays gone
The things you lay on
I can't even pay on
You got it, better hide it
If you wanna keep it safe on
I roam to the top
That's my spot, my place
Jumpin' out a suitcase
Slugs chase to yo' face, a


Ah, ah, ah, ha
Now as I re-enter this scent and get into you
These three dots, I plot and spot, then I shoot
I keep a chopper under the medium Hilfiger
I throw back punks, comin' out trunks to kill niggas
I spill niggas, on the real nigga I gets dirty
Bury em in unknown area where it's deserted
I know you heard it
But you lie and deny it
But you can't hide
It's written all over yo' face you easy to find
Niggas front, scars all over they chest be starting to shine
Like that Presidential Rolex reflex a million nine
Gimme 'dat, all 'dat, and all black, that's my atire
A tru rider, gettin' higher off uptown fire
Remember me, tha little G never died
Took one to the chest but the little G never died

I'mma certified killer, million dollar nigga
Any kind of gun trigger, clicker, playa hater nigga flipper
Tangerie and juice sipper, disrespectin bitch flipper
I'm bout drama off the top
You know that's on the foreal-a
I get's loaded low down by a monkey
So call me donkey
Nigga think lame
He would want to know I gets funky
Beef kicked in a night parade
Uptown was deep
'Nother group rollin out, bookoom be standin' on feet
Now you know I run with ignorant niggas
All of 'em wild
Thousands of people out
Fuck that sprayin' the crowd
Ain't no time for doin' backin down
From trigga play
Gotta closet of K's
Ready to do it anyday
Write grant after tenth
Black grant I was tenths
That's for Al and lil' Duga'
Four deep in each in spinnin' in
So twerk it up
Handle yo' business
Shoot or get shot

Round My Way,It’s All On U Vol. 1,1997,"UPT baby, this how we do around my way
Niggas struggle, they struggle and they hustle
But you can't knock the hustle, feel this
Nigga, I be comin wit dat drama that you can't even duck
Buck, buck, off the top, nigga you can't even duck
Baby Gangsta, heart stopper, car stopper
I tote this chopper, I'm quick to stop ya
You heard that I'll drop ya
I'm runnin wit some killas, we'll break it on down
Yo click think they an organization, we'll take it on down
Uptown in '97, it's the place to be
They packin M-11's nigga and 223
Erase faces all day, AKs get sprayed
That's how it be goin down around my way
V.L., UPT, The ward? 13th
I represent no matter what, respect or check me
Let me live through round 1, and it's all on you
I retaliate, you think the statue of liberty fall on you
Valence snort so much 'til they nose get sore
It's time to graduate, bags ain't doin the job no mo'
Now a needle and some dope, tap dat green vein
Smoke blunts sometime, it's all about that bank
My heart don't pump lemonade, it pump battery juice
Make me pump the trigga finga up when I'm after you
Now I strap a big dick by the Girbaud sign
You heard I'm fuckin yo bitch, so you grabbin yo 9
Movin up like you got it on yo mind
Flexin up for that pussy, you must don't mind dyin
I leave ya folks cryin, you won't take out the policy
It's 50 G, it's accidental so it increase to hundred G
And when it come, proper
I'm louder, popper
Around my way

Nigga, you must be real in the UPT
You would wanna be packin that steel in the UPT
I know you heard that them youngstas creep in the UPT
Niggas be leavin them white sheets in the UPT

My block is hot wit killas, ATF be hittin
Niggas slangin and snortin, if we spittin we splittin
I put G's on the map, leave brains in laps
I hit da stage with drama, startin niggas to scrap
See my hood straight thugged out
You in my hood slippin, nigga you get drugged out
Ya body layin there, but ya spirit is shoved out
On V.L., it's hell when the coke drought, you assed out
When you hear my name, nigga, you hear my street, nigga
When you hear my street, nigga, you think six feet deep
You think six feet deep cause you know I kill
You spot me comin up the block, I'm in black wit a sparkle grill
You see, we tote macks, Glocks, and choppers
Playin wit them hoes, nigga slip we got ya
Rest in Peace, Hooley Hoo, 13 'til death
Thug 'til he die, now my nigga at rest
Runnin ounces by the half, birds by the half
Whatever you want we have, chumps we got it on the half
My people Big Stan, Uptown open shop
Funky Fades and Trimmings, 10 dollars a whop
If you real you make it, fake yo ass get shookin
Fo' you can look, you hit bitch, yo life get tookin
If you think, stay put, or feel the fire from the K
If you ain't from Uptown, stay from round my way

Nigga, you must be real in the UPT
You would wanna be packin that steel in the UPT
I know you heard that them youngstas creep in the UPT
Niggas be leavin them white sheets in the UPT

Around my way nigga hustle, from crooked cops we fled
Niggas struggle to support they habit, gotta keep that monkey fed
Catchin cases every week, misdemeanors and felonies
Playin hatin is a disease, gotta beware of jealousy
If you ball then you hated on
If you do bad dats what bitch niggas done waited on
Caveman, dats my nigga bitch
Mook brother Pete we on Valence cause we all in the click
Man Pookie took a fall, this ho tryin to rott ya
Nigga I got ya, just stay click tight wit all the partnas
I'ma watch ya, Hooley Hoo nigga did 'em foul
I had to watch 'em get pulled out from under a fuckin house
He didn't diserve it
Joe Casey is an old G
I take his advice, he one of the old G's on Valence street
Funk and Clarence upstate, but hey gon' touch down
Soon as ya thinkin, think hustlin down uptown
Ya think we ain't, Lil Baby just hit the street
]From that 13th, took a lil cake, now the nigga see what I see
He down wit me
My nigga Pete just got 2 years, he gon' survive
But Lil Popeye lookin at 5, that ain't shy
Nigga gon' bring noise like a drummer
Everybody gettin outta jail, it's gon' be a hot summer
Better dare yo thinkin and be ready to spray

Lettin' 'em hang, I represent bangity-bang
I gettin' off into shit you can not handle
I'm settin' it off in this bitch, thinkin' of scandals
'Bout my paper, 5 figures and up with the red beam
Dealers and thugs on my team with many 14's
Hittin' your home up, hittin' at everything movin'
Lookin' and losin', startin' chaos and confusion
I'm bruisin' your whole family, dress 'em up in dark colors
Then come to your funeral in two Hummers
That's me, Baby Gangsta, spark in the day
Come out the funeral home, you get hit at walkin' away
I'm in to grow, legend with rights, I don't been enticed
To greab the K and let it spray, put an end to a nigga life
My nigga TD gettin' high wit' me
Out that 13, straped up he ride or die wit' me
I was in the 'Nolia, lookin' for that killa guerilla
I know my nigga gangsta got it on wild willa
Uptown consist of drug dealers, and thugs
For the junkies got no love
It's like this, play pussy you catch a slug
Drug though the mud, once it's dead it's done
Hand on my gun cause I don't give a muthafuck
I'm a head buh-uh-busta, I never truh-uh-trust a bitch
Make sure I gotta silent 4-5, if this nigga snitch
Get me in the fix, and I can't snitch out the mix
Just gimme tree lives, double them so I got six
Ain't that some shit, wanna see me assed outta luck
Bet I ain't trippin', cause I don't give a muthatfuck

I be catchin' a nigga corner, rippin' through a nigga street
Hot Boys they ride with me, like a preist, five deep
Windows tinted, clips extened, drum lettin'
Bustin' lead 'n, real 'n, Hot Boy$ don't forget it
Leave every porch wet 'n, brains all over the step 'n
Disrespectin' the whole neighborhood block wettin'
Step in, the section, uh-of the Hot Boy$
Full of the 'dro, and ride and chop you whole spot boy
Better watch boy, where you be at cause I'm a hit at, three flat
You want beef, I'mma beef at, make it hot, I'mma crease that
Camoflauge to the 'Boks, pop off clips in the Glocks
Make sure all choppers cocked, start a quake, shake the whole block
Take the tip of the jo, kick down the front door
Run from front to back bustin', Terry cut his wife throat
I'mma play it how it go, hold a black connect sho'
We went to school for this, we spend bins like a pro
Go chill with the Joe, Say wodie let's get loaded
Blow a pound with my round, 50 shot'll get me toted
I'mma wet your bin, hit your house, unlock ten
Boy you can't win I let chopper bullets spin

Don't fuck with bitch niggas, 226 bout the real
Them niggas who paper chase, go in the dark and pack that steal
You ain't hear about the young thugs
The Hot Boys, that's who the are
Run that shit blow for blow, hoes be bout catchin' that nut
Nigga don't think cause we young, we ain't ridin' or dyin' too
Down with black connection to the finish, we bout killin' niggas too
Spend your bin quickly, make you suffer, die slowly
You hit enough, I'm about to down, play the scenery
Big ol' Expedition's, do some dirt in it tonight
Five choppers for who lost, kill a nigga, we just might
Bitch niggas get left flat, like a flat rat in the street
Abunch of young head spliters, like K.C. and Big G
Fuck the police, cause we spray them too
Pop the cop or go down, cause we ain't down with that crew
Get caught up in the crossfire, best believe It's All On U
+Ohh, it ain't my fault+, I done what I had to do
Give a fuck about no nigga, that nigga don't give a fuck about me
Any chance he get he gon' take it, try to sweep me off my feet
That's why I keep my eyes wide, nigga cross that line they gon' die
Leave your families clueless, and questionin' why
4-4 bull dogs bark loud, chopper moves crowds
Innocent bystanders watch out, them lil thugs act wild

I'm a ride or die-er, smoke nothin' but that fire-ya
Keep all my hoes cause I'm a liar
Neighborhood uh-hotter that a toaster, ridin' MoMo's
And I'll roast a deal what's on my old poster
If I pull it out my holster
You sopposed'a, respect a nigga like me
I'm gettin' closer and closer to the T-O-P
I'm H-O-T, bitches say I'm a D-O-G
I'm on surveilance all day be the S-P-D's
In my heart I feel, fuck the police
Cause in they heart they feel, fuck it
Try to keep a nigga off the street
Who? Not I, nigga, the trillest B.G
Lots'a money, and the best attourney speak for me
And I speak and represent for the U.P.T
I creep, and get bent with VL Street
I' slang heat, any day, noise I bring
Feel I can't be bat any day, I'm a Hot Boy, I let 'em hang
Far as they can, cause I'm a thug to the fullest
Pistol in my hand, trigga I pull it 'til there's no more bullets
I ain't the one to be repped on
Who whole block get stepped on
If they outside, when I'm ride, I'mma ride 'til there's no more gas
I'mma ride 'til I put you on your muthafuckin' back
I'm in all black, behind the skuh-uh-skimask
It ain't no way that you could last
I'm comin' like the task force, I blast with full force
I'm sorry if your grandparents on the porch
They All 'N

Even if I don't get no taller
I'mma always be a CMB baller, smokin' blunts in the hallway
I'm skinny yeah, weighin' 'bout 155
But believe I could tote a chopper, believe bitches could die
Now play with the man, full of that dope with a K in his hand
Don't want hear what'cha sayin' just don't be here when I sprayin'
How you gon' do it, we could handle that no secret
Boy, I'll put some change on you head take you off the street quick
Look, I got a Mack-90 that won't quit
I got clique foll of some njiggaz bout that funk shit
So what you want, get you dome split
You home hit, jeopardized
Niggas spendin' a bin in camoflauge
I'mma top knot shot caller, from the clique CMB Ballers
Fuckin' niggas daughters, got my shit sittin' on Brawlers
I'm mad boy, with this clique I'mma act a ass boy
It's cash boy, I don't think you could last boy
I'm bout to pull some out the hall type shit
Some Steven Seagal type shit
Some *cgghh* knife shit
Don't think you niggas feelin' that 226
Behind me the crucifix, chop or get chopped, split or get split
Doogie, Lil Wayne, Lil Turk, Lil Terius, better tell 'em

I'm on my game ready to be releasin and rearrange
Ya fuckin brain
Carry shit that holds 50 plus
Out the clip these bullets rush, leave ya fuckin head bust
Wuz up, I freeze beef like a deep freezer
Ya talk noise, where ya stand nigga is where I leave ya
Believe in me and my clique, hit ya block erasin
Leave ya thoughts wastin, I run a hundred miles paper chasin
I'm 'bout drama, foolishness, whatever start the trigga play
I had to spank a nigga believin what a bitch say
Like K.C., I don't play
Spin a nigga bin everyday
A hundred round drum on the K
Leave ya set a straight disaster
Ya got birds? I smash ya
Refuse, I leave that ass, know that I'm nasty
No clues, I can't be caught
I can't be found, it's all on you
I stop ya heart from beatin, down to the dirty-do
I leave a nigga flesh hangin from his chest
Cause the best that he dressed
Couldn't fuck with the Smith & Wess
B.G., Black Connection 226 start static
Comin out a nigga attic leavin holes in ya carriage
I ride all night 'til I catch a bitch
And when I catch, I auto matic wet ya bitch

It's that nigga off the block, call me the hood mack
Disguised in red bandana strapped wit the chrome and black mack
Check, while you be the playa hater, I be the bitch fader
Bullets graze ya, nigga I tried to erase ya
Pick the casket, dump the Glock in the basket
I stroll slow, a tisket, a tasket
I brings enough of ??? heat then I bring my boys
To destroy, chop ya down like a clown
UPTOWN!!!
That is my destination
And murderin motherfuckers is my occupation
You'd rather face the nation than to fuck wit me
I keep a chopper, I'm a fool out that wild TC
Good bye, better yet I'll see ya later
I'm smooth with the steel and wit the hands I'm like Frazier
Okey doke yo bitch ass, then I take the cash and blast
Never get caught, my trade mark is the black mask
226 tattoed on my over my heart
This here mark means that I was down from the start
Releasin them cop killers and body peelers
I got ya, you bitch
Now it's time for me to drop ya

Head shots stop, complete
50 shots when our choppers scream
Havin trouble this evenin
Leavin the scene not breathin
Me and the Hot Boyz ride
Cheif and gettin high
Beef and niggas die when me and the Hot Boyz ride
Girlfriend under the seat, driver side of the Hummer
Here comes the chopper drummer faster than a track runner
Don't play the hard road cause the hard road will get you left
On your way to the crossroads, no tomorrow for yourself
Wettin your whole set and where I think ya be at
Attackin your old hood and where ya people sleep at
React, pure D-donkey, 'bout gettin funky
Turk throw me the junk keep more ammo than an army
Clips that's all extended leave you bended, rear ended
SK's be sendin, slugs can't be defended
There goes the arrival, chopper spits five more
Screamin lets start the war cause we 'bout survival
I gets loose, chopper, blast drastically, tragically
Bloody, bloody bodies lie upon the ground raggedy
You turn around I got that red light beamin bright
You full of fright cause you know you might die tonight
I gets tool it's, I'm ruthless, do more shootin this
'Bout gettin foolish, lose it, chopper, ready to shoot it
The head buster, Apple and Eagle, B.G., still a sinner
I got his body stank behind the Carrollton shoppin center

Baby, gimme the keys, gimme the G's, gimme the weed, gimme the Mac-10
Let me see what's happenin, to me these niggas lackin
Some tellin me felonies was commited, some was acquitted
My destiny is to live not in jeopardy, to the death of me
I provide knowledge that spread like a virus
This a street orientation, you can't learn this in college
You be fuckin around wit the keys if you ain't rollin shit up
I wish you niggas wit me, I would be sewin shit up
Look, hide out in the cut
Peep out Shot, Corey and Buck
In an Expedition truck
And brain fucked up from that dust
Nigga, who trippin?
I ain't trippin, you trippin
When I slap that clip in
You shittin like stool pigeons
That's my bitches, that's my riches, that's my niggas
That's my yayyo, that's my scale
That's my sale, that's my clientele
This my block, this my rocks
This my shop, this my Glock
This my connection with the mob
That's my partna black Saab
This my people, that's my people
That's hot rimmed Regal
Ask my lawyer, I do it legal
That's my credit card from Segal's
This my cigar, this my weed
This my Newport, this my reefer
That's my old Alma Mater
That's my uncle drinkin that bottle

Okay, I'm from that 3 and I don't give a fuck
Nigga, I say murda, murda, what the fuck is up?
Nigga better duck when I come around that bend, I'm 'bout that drama
With the dirty 30, nose dirty
And I'm from that 3 and I be gat totin
I feel ya body full of lead
Put you to bed
And now another that done came up, fuck
I plot and make sure that I don't miss the hit
I got you up in Ochsner, I got ya, I hurt ya
Now I'm up in ya rest area, finish ya
I come with a bouquet of flowers
Within the bouquet of flowers is a 9 nickel plated to devour

Clean Up Man,It’s All On U Vol. 2,1997,"Aw.....I'm comin' through the fog
Dressed in black
Knock Yo muthafuckin' head off
Bitch nigga stop playin' wit me

Spark it up make it happen, grab your piece
You deceased, fuckin' with me, oh it's pure beef
Tragedy, homicide, battle me out there
Nothin' in between but air, bitch I don't play fair
I come through like an Amtrak, what'cha gone do?
Got a strap but it's on safety, mine ready to let loose
I hit'cha spot, niggas scatter
I ratta-tatta, whatever it don't matter
Hollows come out like blat-blatta
Gotta shop across town, applied it so they doomed
Soon as it hit Noon I'm blastin' off in the room
First thing flinch I go boom
With the sweeper I sweep like a broom
Creep like the Grim Reaper leavin' everything wound
When the Moon come out, that's when the snakes come out
The fakes go in, you got it, hide out in the drought
You leave a gap open I'm squeezin' it cuz I'm scopin', hopin'
I can catch a nigga with some birds just locin'
So I can uh-abuse the bitch
Misuse the bitch, refuse me then his family gone lose the bitch
I'm colder than ice, I'm smoother than sand
Baby Gangsta headbusta just a clean up man

On dangerous grounds, with the K off in my hand
Ready for me to blast I'ma clean up man
On dangerous grounds, with the K off in my hand
Ready for me to blast I'ma clean up man
On dangerous grounds, with the K off in my hand
Ready for me to blast I'ma clean up man

B.G., Hot Boy, leave ya dick in the dirt
Ride with Juvey, Lil' Wayne, and Turk
Puttin' faces on shirts
You know tuh-uh-together, we acts a ass
Fifty shots, out each clip we blast
Full of that trash, out the St. T
We mash on the gas
Hangin' out the window, hit the heat
Apply pressure to yo head nigga
And little bullets take red from yo head nigga
Should have watched your mouth and not said what you said nigga
But uhn-uhn-uhn, now that nigga's dead, nigga
It's All On U
If you got beef, would you freeze, ha nigga?
Grab the ass kicker and hit the enemy block nigga?
If you got beef would you squash it and eat it?
Make a nigga bleed, or think it's cool and now you eatin' it?
If you got beef would you try to sleep on it?
If it's with me you ain't thinkin' cuz I'll creep homie
If you got beef  better squeeze trigga nigga
Kill it no matter what even if it takes four weeks nigga


I come hard enough, ya feelin' me?
Fa shiggedy
Bitch niggas gone get they wiggadys splitti, splitti
You done pissed these niggas off from Chopper City
In each and every K we tote, they got fifty
So bring it on however you wanna bring it on
Yo block explode like a bomb
I'm dangerous and armed
The B.G. Get it How I live til' I'm gone
I'ma H.B., and gotta get my shine on
So when the gangsta situation's starin' at you
Nigga look the other way or do what'cha gotta do
I'm quick to leave all the choices on you
Gotta trigga happy clique ask questions after they shoot
The people in blue can't even take the scene I leave
If ten niggas on the block, then ten niggas I leave
Now Frank Minyard got work for three weeks
That's how the U.P.T. play it if we got beef
I'm stompin' on dangerous grounds, K in my hand
I ain't bout playin', call me the clean up man
Call me the clean up man, on dangerous grounds with the K off in my hand",https://genius.com/Bg-baby-gangsta-clean-up-man-lyrics
Ride or Die,It’s All On U Vol. 2,1997,"Uptown is my home, thats where I do my dirt
I either hurt or get hurt
It's me or you on that shirt
Can't let no nigga fix me
Can't let no nigga get me
I'mma draw and hit first, I can't let no nigga split me
Had my momma upset
Nigga, leave my ho pussy wet
I'm goin out with a fight, my chopper bullets eject
I gets blowed and start
Ready to unload at war
No witnesses
You can't get on the stand and say you saw nothin bout nothin
Keep it shut or you dead
If you can't hush, open your mouth and you'll get ten in your head
That's how I play it nigga, I'll blackmail you wit your own life
It ain't right, disrespect you die on site
That ain't no might, that's a fact
You can believe that
Instead disrespect, I promise to be back
And clear the corner, you can't run, dont try
I'm high, bout mine ready to ride or die bitch

Load it up with black gats and macs
Pay attention to gun blastin
And fake buster harassin
Smashin, dashin up yo street wit all the lights out
Two choppers cocked ready to knot
And chop up yo block
Lock all doors and keep windows closed
Cause we done rolled before
So stay on the floor
We ride deep in the all black camaro
Sittin on mo's
And we rolls tokin on fat optimos
You chose to test those uptown boys
You done got on a straight ride and can't get off
Lets all get a stolen car
And roll through they ward
When it's dark
We spark, pull up then draw
You done falled in war
Got in a big brawl
Thought hard but you wrong
So you still get scarred
Y'all boys done played wit some all out kill niggas
Shuffle ‘em like cards, cut the deck then deal niggas
Still niggas for testin these big lil niggas
Still niggas for messin with these real trill niggas
Young niggas, chopper totin big gun niggas
Front nigga and live your life on the run nigga
Stunt nigga and get plugged, drug through the mud
Puddles of blood flood
You can't swim so you done
Niggas start to look
And see the all black crook
Some booked, some get high
Some hot on one foot
Spots gettin took, whole bodies gettin dropped
Niggas hop, jock, and flock
When I hit they block
(Chorus)
So ride or die bitch
Chop or get chopped ho
B.G., split or get split
Play the game how it go(4x)

Why is you sayin them words, bo janglin, why dont you show yo face
Would you dust me or somthin, you must know you gonna catch a case
I'm a straight head bust ya
Seperate and destruct ya
Dont wanna have no Juvey wanna make a ghost or few
What am I'm supposed to back down or somthin cause you got a lil click
All that frownin and reppin shit
Gone get ya down in a devil ditch
Never miss, I be drivin niggas wit cleverness
Momma used to say this
""Use your mind and stay rich""
Pops used to say ""boy dont let them niggas see your weakness""
If a fool get outta line with you knock him off his feet quick
Why is you showin yo teeth you dont speak
Stay on your side of the street, you can't be mobb'n with me
I can't have no bitches followin me
Gotta Mac-10 and you ain't even bust back
And your boy got hit in the back
What type of nigga is that?
(Hook)
That's why I stay in all black
Get the Mac and go back
You done fucked wit C-M-R-ah
They'll be no tommorrow(2x)
(Chorus)

Get you a chopper and tote it
Dont just buy it to have it
Nigga have it to use it
Better grab it and shoot it
Better know one thing nigga will do it to you
Before you do it to them to survive, gotta be true
Nigga think just cause we squashed that beef, thats it
You might be thinkin like me, I think forgive and dont forget
I gotta trick under my sleeve
Ridin four deep wit artillary
Me and Tootie, Papa, and Cleeve
It's an unsolved mystery
I'm a fly til I got ya, yo peoples eyes watery
I hit a artery
Bein real to CMB, it's a part of me
Cross me I charge you wit some flamin hot heat
Two twenty-three blazed all in yo chest
Brain waves you dazed up
You see death stare you straight in your face
Get waked up cause I left ya stretch for the hurse
I take no chance for you to ride, nigga I ride first

I’m Tryin,It’s All On U Vol. 2,1997,"I'm tryin' to do right
But I'm surrounded by wrong
Avoid the all night flight
And still make it on my own
I'm tryin' be cool
Do what I gotta do
But playa haters all over
So I roll with my crew
I'm tryin' stay over
And just stay my ass in school
Ain't many choices to choose
And this rap game I can't refuse
I wanna win don't want to be the one to loose
My pistol my only friend
Cause busters try to bring the blues
Leavin brains with no clues
Spin the ben in black clothes
They tryin' ta' take my only life
Leave my folks on the front row
Bury me in providence
Heavy weight that rose
They wanna steal the B.G
Now tell me Alton
Ain't that cold
What can I do
Now what can I do to get out the game
What can I do
Now what can I do to make change
Every other day around my way niggas dyin'
Hours flyin I want to go straight boy I'm tryin'
-Chorus- (Juvenile)
I'm tryin' to shake the monkey off of me
Lord please let me go where I needs to be
Ball 'till I fall it's a poor family
Fo' sho' I know the future got a lot of stuff for me
Verse Two: B.G
I'm tryin' to get my mail straight
Sell cd's and tapes
I don't want to be jail bait
Niggas want to kill me
And increase the hell rate
They almost got me
But I slip the spot it was too late
I wanna be a role model for my lil' brother
And buy a fifteen room manison for my mother
Settle down wit' a solid ho
And drop a tight seed
So I can raise another uptown B.G
Just like me
I'mma give 'em what I wish had, a dad
He goin' be smart and bad nigga
Throwin' up a solga rag
This world is kurupted
The police is crooked
My boy was runnin with a BB gun
His young life they took it
The judges is rotten
Everyday it get's colder
They throwin' away the key
Sendin' the soldiers to angoula
My round slangin' that yola
With they hand on that iron
To keep my mind right
Beleive nigga I'm tryin'
-Chorus-
Verse Three: Lil' Wayne
I'm tryin' to be a man at fourteen
Choppin iron at fourteen'
Nigga that tells my only way
(B.G.: Look where you stand at fourteen)
A lil' bity something
Whuckin, representin' partners
Ain't to good in my neighborhood
Uptowns my partner
I ain't lie I'm tryin
To go the right way
But the night flight way
Just ain't the right way
I wan' be a gangsta but also wan' live
So I choose to be a uptown HotBoy hard to kill
Sittin' behind the cruiser wheel
Can't even see me I'm so lil'
And you expect me to give this
Just to switch to positive
As hard as I'm tryin' do it I just can't make a shape
School I'm tryin' go through it but I just can't make a shape
Gettin' in beef that resultin' into serious gun slangin
Do good I want yeah but on half I just keep hangin'
I'm lookin for a change but change ain't lookin for me
Will I remain a B.G
Or a A student
We'll see

Keep a pocket full of money, bank roll on fat

Plus I got the change
Disrespect and puttin change on ya brain (playa)
Three of the finest bitches in the city on my team
Big body Expedition wit the gangsta lean
I wanna see all my homies get on they feet
For L.T., a G, with that gangsta lean (playboy)
So I can see all my homies ball in the U.P.T

Bat a bitch quick, that's the modo I follow
Toss a bitch through the click, that's the modo I follow
If you real, hold a ho life in the palm of ya hand
If you can't control a ho to me ya ain't no man
Bitch, stay in line like the vice grip in the middle of the street
Any little thing I make ya taste, any little thing ya get beat
You gon' respect the B.G., or I'll punch ya in your nose
You gon' respect the B.G., or I'll whip ya out your clothes
C-M-R-ah gon' ride
No other thing gon' fly
Expedition and Mercedes cause a nigga like to shine
We in front and not behind, not on bottom, on top
Not on the side of nothin, hoes get flipped and flopped
My nigga ??? pimp a bitch, he a soldier for real
My nigga ??? whip a bitch, yeah he hard to kill
Uptown bout theirs', nigga I'm bout mine
Dogg hoes I share and I make 'em stay in line


Never let these hoes take you away from yo ends
Drive high, ride fly, buy the big body Benz
And pass by they house, blow yo horn and laugh
When she come to the door say ""you hoe!"" and stare
To the next muthafucka that hated on you
Your baby mama full of drama, tell that bitch it's through
Cause when ya ain't got nothin these hoes don't want you around
And when you work to get paid, these hoes act like clowns
So what could you do to satisfy ungrate
Buy a car, treat her like a star, yet the ho still hate
Cause it's yo skills to pay the bills, nigga ride
Respect or eject, cause these hoes are tired
I'm on a mission to make. a million plus
Have platinum on the wall and ride the tour bus
Money over bitches, believin that for sho
Cash Money and the power, stay in line hoe


Beat these bitches, stomp these hoes

Plan Went Sour,It’s All On U Vol. 2,1997,"Picture, I'm always plannin kaperz tryin to come up on cheese
But my kaperz goin sour for the Lil' B.G., peep me

I was born a loser, a stank pussy abuser
Murders I'm accused cause I'm a AK user
Struggle for my stat to be phattest on knots
Pack Glocks wit 17, keep a nigga off my block, it's hot
Cause it's bumpin, got nothin but dope traffic
Six figgas what I'm after, can't be play'n and laugh'n
Young wit good sense, bent behind the tents
In front of this baller house that I'm 'bout to go in
I got it mapped up, it's planned all out
I demand you denied, them lights goin all out
I done scoped for 3 weeks, been broke for 3 weeks
Hope inside they got a bird of coke and 10 G
The niggas in the project come in black like always
Invisible wit the mack, it's dark in the hallways
Creepin so slow, cause it's on the second flo'
I gets up there, they got a crack in the front do'
I push it wit ease
Nigga freeze
Get on yo knees
No keys, no G's
I find dead bodies
Two wit head shots, one nigga still breathin, he bleedin heavily
I'm leavin amazed G
Get back to the car, tryin to get far as I can
Nigga planned what I planned, my gun shakin in my hand
It's one way goin gettin money and the power
Gotta think again cause my plan went sour
2x
That's cold, I'm tryin to hold money and the power
Everything I do goes sour, hour after hour
I don't wanna sale flour, I want a office in a tower
Sittin on G's wit 30 keys of powder

I lay back and think again, tryin to come up on cheese
Do what I gotta do, nigga it's all on me
Just like it's all on you to chose right from wrong
Might be a power move to go in this nigga home
I'mma handle my biz, plan it out and shit
Ain't killin no kids, but I'mma split his wig
If I have to spank his bitch, I'mma spank the ho
Get off the motherfuckin flo' and take me to the coke
Now where the stash at, where the cash at, where the grass at
Look at this chopper in my hand, I'mma blast that, pass that
Green shit wit Ben Franklin on it
I'll spill you nigga, ain't no need for thankin on it
I gots to have it, up it busta, real fast
Fo' I get to the point, fuck it buster, and I'll blast
You play with fire get burned, fuck wit B.G. get burnt
I'mma hustla 'til death, be trill to my last brat
I let my nuts hang, I'm bout money and the power
Thinkin again cause my plan went sour
That's cold, man that's cold
My plan went sour
2x

I planned this and I done planned that
But every time it go sour, I can't stand that
I want money and the power in my hand black
I'mma end up leavin the game, what the fuck is that?
I done kidnapped, I done jacked, I done slung the mack
And everytime the kaper over, I bring nothin back
I have no paper and I'm sober I ain't havin that
Any high-roller got what I want, then I'm grabbin that
All I got is my rap folder tryin to make a mill
But they got niggas even colder tryin to make a mill
I just be real and hope B.G. hit the jack pot
Put on the spot, every tape we drop, hit the store hot
We got a plan and we clique tight on the rise, I come out Juvey ride
Hot Boyz come out, we all ride
I'm 'bout mine and ya know to progress, gotta struggle
Do what I gotta do, gotta rap hustle
Ya playa hate, I pluck ya, fuck ya, hoes jock ya mail
You know I gotta duck, but I'm tryin to bring up tape sales
Cause I got a plan, I got a plan to go platinum
Holdin my dick, G's and a strap in my hand
 3x

Nigga, respect that
All these niggas puttin on they black mask
Dressin up to get dey cash, ya heard me
Don't go in that kaper if it ain't planned right
Cause it ain't gon' come out right
You ain't gon' come out wit no mail
Make sure you got it down pat
I done been through it
And I ain't bring nothin back
But I'm bringin this shit to the fuckin distribution people
And they sendin some shit back, ya heard me

I ain't nothin,' but seventeen years old
Want to fullfill my dream have a million records sold
But niggas hatin on me everyday and that's cold
I keep my four-four and I ain't gon' let it go
My money can't fold no more it's in stacks
My nose is close now I see that ain't where it's at

My wrist done elevated to rolex with the bezel
I'm young but bout nice things off top
Don't fuck wit' what I worked hard for cause i'll hit yo' block
I ride in big bodies
I sleep in big beds
Always wear boks (reeboks) and bauds always gon' bust a head

Keep my finger on the trigga.. gotta think on the next nigga

Raised up thugged out, keep the fuckin gauge out
Hoe shit done played out ya whole posse laid out
Birds and money that's all that excite me
Fuck bitches I'm bout money that's all that entice me
President lover, undercover, ain't another like me
You get a ki half price from Columbia fuckin with B
Believe it's just in me to be a real soldier
Gats I load, slip you dont value what's on ya shoulder
Now I done told ya -- the streets is real all the time
Gotta survive the game nigga I'ma die for mine
I ain't lyin.. I do what the fuck I gotta do
Shoot who I gotta shoot if ya outside my crew

Tryna get on my feet I creep you sleep six feet deep

Fuck all that assholin nigga lets beef
Remember I'm the one that said 'take it to the streets'
Twerk somthin, handle up nigga, shake somthin
Got a K with a drum -- and I'm ready to spray somthin
Lay it down.. make the wrong move.. checkmate
Think again.. you sendin peace messages, it's too late
Tryin to recuperate.. after we left ya in the dust
Big Boy can't fuck with us retaliation is a must
Baby Gangsta, grim reaper, death bringer
Assault rifle banger.. got a itchy trigger finger
I let em hang-a....what you niggas say you gon do me,do it man
Underestimate in this war you gon lose it man
Got a AR... 15 I mean

Bust open the 911, let me take my hit

Lights out like the eclipse, rookies tryin to battle us
Cockin and be bout poppin nigga its time to hanlde up

All these.. jive niggas wan rep on me
Knowin they ain't bout to step cross Martin Luther King
All these other initials besides U.P.T, and H.B. --
Don't mean nothin to the B.G
I'm ready to get down and dirty bout my place in this biz
Let a nigga take me down after all this time? Shiiiit
I'm a uptown shiner, bout takin what's mine-a
Used to spin bins in camerys and pathfinders
That's just to remind you, niggas that tryin to
Fade lil doogie slip nigga ill down you
Me and my rounds come through set trippin
Gettin it how we live and, takin respect ain't given

Come at me sideways I hook up with Juv, Turk, and Wayne
You can't explain, you wanna be hard don't whine
I click-clats it back and let you tell it to my nine
Sendin' messages, say I'ma bitch you'll leave me wet
I can't believe you believe I take death threats
You're wrong Wootay, you're absolutely wrong
Now it's on Wootay, your seventeen damagin' health
That's another spankin' completed under my belt
Your Mom in black on the floor her seein' that her son done been left
Brains cooked like a chef, too late for Doctors to help
It's All On U, you brought that issue on yourself
Think you could know me, got kicked off the shelf
I hustle with muscle just to increase my wealth
Nigga say what's up to Satan, B.G. ain't bout no fakin'
I handle mine with no debatin', stop underestimatin'

Bling Bling,Chopper City in the Ghetto,1999,"Nigga I got these hoes iced up enough
While my lil' B.G.'s on the bus puttin' out cigarette butts
But me, personally, playboy I don't give a fuck
And I'mma always show love to my cut
Hit the club, light the bitch up
The Cash Money motto is to drink 'til we throw up
Nigga point the ho out, guaranteed I can fuck
Woadie, I'm tattooed and balled up
Medallion iced up, Rolex bezelled up
And my pinky ring is platinum plus
Earrings be trillion cut and my grill be slugged up
My heart filled with anger cause nigga I don't give a fuck
Stack my cheese up, cause one day I'ma give this street life up
Beef I don't discuss, a nigga outta line gon' get his motherfuckin' head bust
Cash Money Millionaires plus
Don't touch sum'in nigga you can't fuck
Twenty inches TV is a must
By the year two thousand I'm gut out my bus

Verse 2
: Lil' Turk]
A lil' nigga seventeen playin' with six figures
Got so much ice you can skate on a nigga
When you see Cash Money you know we stay flossin'
Catch ya girl down bad ya know we straight tossin'
I ain't seen a clique yet that can stunt like mine
I ain't seen a Maro that can run like mine
1999, and it's our turn to shine
Fifty or better on our wrist and they all blind
Pourin' vodka 'til I die drank 'til I faint
'Til a nigga tell me I need another drank
My nigga Baby told me work nigga trick to them hoes
Nigga Baby told me work nigga better than treatin' yo nose
I'm the freak of the clique
Keep it on the tuck
So I creep on a bitch and I play it the raw
Never sleep with a bitch, keep it real with my niggas
Never weep for a bitch, never weep for a bitch nigga

Bling bling, every time I come around your city
Bling bling, pinky ring worth about fifty

Candy-coated helicopter with the leather cover
If ya suckin' not fuckin' take off the rubber
Then toss that bitch nigga cause I don't love her
Balla, Manny bought a private plane
Then turned around and sold that bitch to Juve and Wayne
They put thirty-inch Lorinsers on that thing man
I know you niggas out there just don't understand

I'm a 1999 driver, I'm a uptown Third Ward, Magnolia T.C. rider
Ol' ignorant ass always stuntin'
Big ballin' ass nigga you can see him when he comin'
Booted up, diamond up, golds be shinnin' up
Muthafuckas be blindin' up
Niggas at the second line be sayin, I'll be damned
Up in they best fits sayin', Juve got me again

If it cost less than twenty it don't look right on me
I stay flossed out all through the week
My money long if you don't know I'm the B.G
I be fuckin niggas bitches all in they home
Niggas be like, ""Look at that Benz on all that chrome""
Diamonds worn by everybody thats in my click
Man I got the price of a mansion 'round my neck and wrist
My nigga Baby gettin' a special built machine
A Mercedes Benz Wagon 700 V14
I know you niggas can't believe that
I can't wait to see ya haters face when ya see that
Man look at that
Niggas wear shades just to stand on side of me
Hoes say take that chain off boy ya blindin' me

It's cut throat, you gotta play it raw

Gettin' killed, ain't no thang, in the N.O
Some people live, some people get smoked
Life trap, get crossed up by them dog hoes
Like shit, get masked out over dog hoes
Really doe
Bullet holes be so big
Innocent bystanders get hit, even little kids
Niggas be lookin', like they at a shootin' range
Don't give a fuck who they hittin', they just do they thang
Bullets be coastin' like birds in a flock
Hit yo block with camouflage nigga gone get got
A hundred shots flippin', you can get away
Gettin' chopped, losin' they life, by the A.K
Everyday, niggas at war, niggas dyin'
That's yo ass if you don't have it on yo waist line
Kickin' in doors, playin' by no rules realah
Like B.G. whatever you do its all on you realah

It musta been meant for me ta be rich
If only my dead niggas could of lived to see this
I appreciate what the lord gave to me
But I don't appreciate is how these niggas be hatin' me
What is it? is it the car? is it the jewels?
Is it the shoes?
Or do you want to see what a nigga gone do?
I know a nigga plottin' up ta jack me or nab me
Thats why when I ride on my lap be the strap piece
Don't try ta jam me one tha one-way dawg
Look, cus you ain't gettin' away without no gunplay fall
You gone be in a hospital a.k.a. we never close
In a morgue with a tag on yo toes

Quick ta strap up and ride play the blunt and lets go

Outside ya complex duckin', waitin' ta blast
I'll kick yo ass if too many questions
And I'll catch a nigga cut with two S.K.s
Yall fake like two large silicon breasts
What you forgot? head bussers leave bloody messes
I leave dreadlocks in ya tennis
Duck, boys better lay it down when I'm spittin'
Put it like this, in the primetime of the night you can try ta come in
But cha can't go and split it, ha ha, get it
Better watch and ya mentionin', fluid ya mouth
Better rearrange ya system
Yall niggas want beef look, and what?

Mark Nell L.T. and me made niggas lay on they face
We was about that gunplay and on the grind
We was on a paper chase we wanted ta shine
Gotta get it how you live where the fuck I'm from
Gotta keep it on the real where the fuck I'm from
Growin' up in the streets best believe its dangerous
They lock us up but the jail ain't changin' us
You'll make it how i live if you don't mind dyin'
Growin' up in my shoes best believe was hard times nigga
(Chorus) 2x
Hard times got a nigga in all black
I'm goin' jack for that silver pack where its at
Hard times got the B.G. drove nigga
Hard times got me duckin' them white folks nigga
Its a hard time comin' up where I'm from like a twister spinnin'
Don't get caught in it
Its drastic drama its everyday life whoa
Jackin' is a way of livin 'if you ain't on the right road
I move fast my people say I need ta slow down
Close ya nose or ya gonna go down
I'm beefin' with different sets I'm duckin' them white folks
Playin' my hoes close
They tied up like a rope
I'm slangin' tryin' ta make a million and chill
Buy a ten story buildin' and a football field
Diamonds round my neck and wrist plenty golds in my grill
Niggas gone get holes in they head if they don't keep it real
My mama cryin' cuz she think I'mma get my head bust
But I tell her growin' up with no daddy is rough
Welfare ain't enough
And I wanna shine
So I'm goin get mine nigga and get out these hard times whoa
(Chorus) 2x
Me and my niggas buyin' cars don't give a fuck what its costin'
Neighborhood superstar Hot Boy$ bout flossin'
Crossin any of us get that ass put in a coffin
You don't hear we loss a shoot-out very often

And when we get there believe we closin' shop

Cause  it be shows all seven days of the week

Nigga I been hustlin since twelve I done made it
Rappin off nuthin but Mannie (Mannie Fresh) Beats
He the greatest, but wait hold up, you ain't heard the latest
Million dollar contract a 150 pages, Not minimum
We makin maximum wages
Let me tell u about bayou classic how we played it
We hit Canal (Canal Street) so deep click  so strong
Every vehicle we rode in was on chrome
The Hummer sound had em' jumpin in the SuperDome
We got so much money we gave the bank a credit loan
We go shopping and spend 50 G's at the mall
But that don't hurt cause Cash Money gone still ball
Nigga Until We Fall

I ain't even gotta tell u how Cash Money Roll!
I ain't even gotta tell u we ballin outta control!

It's 98,  my money stack  it don't  fold
I'm a livin legend, havin fire weed sessions
Hide your bitch cause I will have in my possession
I'm top notch, it ain't no secret I'm hot
You can spot,  my Rolex watch from down the block
I don't talk shit if I ain't  able to prove it
My wrist spark bitch, Especially in the dark bitch
I'm a young nigga, tru 2 da game nigga
Far from dumb And play'n with a little change nigga
Fuck with me I put a little over your brain nigga
But fuck that I ride and let my chopper rang nigga
Since 97' I got a lil bigger and taller
Chasing 6 figures, I'm the Cash Money Baller

You know I got a lil HotGirl to be
That's my world dawg she lookin just like me
I'm straight out all the old money from my old habit

I got my lil girl a Lexus for when she grow up

And six weeks for me and my clique to post up

Thug’n,Chopper City in the Ghetto,1999,"I be thug'n and it ain't no secret
I run game so when it's ran on me I can peep it
My mind frame set on stacking six figures plus
I let 'em hang so when shit gets real heads get bust
I ain't the one that gets caught up and see an early grave
Being all the way true to the game is how I was raised
Niggas I came up under got nothing but street ways
Niggas I came up under tote nothing but AK's
They sat me down schooled me where at an early age
So off top I lay it down when I feel played
Meet Lil fat Kenny, Faire and my dog Schraie
When  I catch you down bad, where you stand is where you lay
I don't plan for the future, I live day for day
Cross my path I'll execute cha, respect what I say
VL niggas play it raw, you could trust that
I got the key in the car me and Baby got the Glock and map
We thugged out
Chorus: repeat 2X
I be thugging and it ain't no secret
I run game so when it rains on me I can peep it
I represent to the fullest what you bout I'm bout
Freedom or jail I'm always gonna be thugged out, thugged out

Lil Geezy be thugging to the fullest
Stay strapped, so when drama kickin' ready to pull it
You want beef with my niggas, look here bring it on
I'm bout that dome checkin, and I'm gone let it be known
I'm a roam, through your hood when I see you duck
Whoevers on the block gets two cause I drop my nuts
Realism is in my nature thats how its gotta be
I'm a fire that can't be put out ain't no stopping me
They dont call B.G. a Hot Boy for nothing
I'm bout gangster shit, and hoes know I'm working with something
I was chillin in Timbermen with my dogs thugging
Some niggas buckin
But alot of niggas button
The UPT is where I stunt, nigga thats my hometown
And everybody knows that on Sunday it be going down
So until I die I'ma be about that street shit
I'm bout mine
And I ain't the one you wanna beef with
I'm thugged out
Chorus: repeat 2X

Look my block hot the law sleep every other day
We beefin off top, we creep every other day
My dog Malcolm on a charge, he gets parole up in May
He told me where he left the Glock, K ????
I run with niggas thats bout drama, well lets get funky
Slip I duct tape your momma, my dogs are donkeys
We bout  are business, so you better act like you know
Play possum, so its a must we play you like a fuckin' hoe
I'm true to the game, play it exactly how it goes
I lay my rep down with the Benz off the showroom floor
I'm swimming in a pool of hundreds
Lil Dougie be thuggin, but Lil Dougie got beacoup money
Niggas know my click had the crowd buckin'

Is a naked chick next to me?
I've been taking ecstasy
Drinking Hennessy
Is a naked chick next to me?

I'm in the club seein' all kind of colors and shit
On the dance floor, openin' up rubbers and shit
And I'm tongue kissin' with somebody else bitch
And I hear voices sayin', ""You can have that trick!""
Hallucinatin', trippin' - freakin' out
Passin' out on the floor and I'm speakin' out
Who the motherfuck took my motherfuckin' lighter?
And look at that bitch over there - don't she look like a spider?
I guess a playa like me better sit down beside her
I know what you did last summer
, bitch - slut - liar
(I see dead people!)
(You need to quit!)
Bartender, give me a Big Mac combo and a Jeri Curl kit
(Yo, man, what are you on? You're actin' kind of strange
You're a real party animal like that cat Rick James.)
Well, give me a Hennessy and one of them pills
And point me to the strippers buck naked in high-heels
What? What?
(Ecstasy!)

I've been popping ecstasy
Drinking Hennessy
Is a naked chick next to me?
I've been taking ecstasy
Drinking Hennessy
WE LOVE IT!!

I'm in the club sayin', ""Who's that bitch...
Runnin' 'round the club, wanna suck my dick?""
Look like a nigga in here cookin' a brick
I must've been drinkin' too much of this shit
These hoes lookin' better than Lorenzo kits
It's hot as a motherfucker in this bitch
I'm 'bout to take my shirt off and drive a bitch
I bought the bar when I walked in this bitch
I should've put my car in front of this bitch
I still got that four-four in this bitch
Hennessy, X, Mo', Dos', and a trick
Rusty and Juvy, y'all can have that shit
The bitch couldn't dance right front of the clique
Now the ho sayin' we owe a hundred and six
I'll give this ho a stack if she suck my dick
Man, pull the car around and let me get out this bitch
(""Help! H-Help! Help!"")
(Ecstasy!)

I've been popping ecstasy
Drinking Hennessy
Is a naked chick next to me?
I've been taking ecstasy
Drinking Hennessy
(BEOTCH!!!)

I'm in the club - full of that Cris', I'm done
Just popped a pill, now I'm ready to fuck
I'm staggerin' through this motherfucker - I've had enough
I'm askin' every ho I pass, ""Bitch, what's up?""
Somebody gon' leave with me and break bread
I'm so high right now I'll pay for some head
I spot one of my old freaks from uptown
Bingo - I know for sure it's goin' down
I still got a half a pill I let her pop
We blazed - by the time we hit the 'tel she hot
Ready to drop her drawers, ready to be freaked
Ready to suck on them balls, ready to chew that meat
On the slick, she scaring me to something I never seen
She wilding, clean the fuck out acting like a beast
I wish I would've been knew cause how they act off Hennessy
I would've been feeding all my hoes the ecstasy (Ecstasy!)
Uh-huh
I've been doin' this

I've been popping ecstasy

Is a naked chick next to me?

Drinking Hennessy

I'm a tiger, I'm a lion, I'm a bear, I'm a panther
If you ballin' I'mma be the one that's gonna snatch ya
I'm a fool, when I'm beefin I give niggas the blues
Don't think twice, first mind tell me do what I gotta do
So I gather up my clique, load up the fucking iron
Gas up the creep mobile, jump in that bitch and ride
When I catch ya I'mma do ya, I'mma smoke ya, I'mma kill ya
I'mma spank ya, I'mma whack ya, Geezy gone deal witcha
I don't play, I don't asshole B.G. don't lollygag
I get these pussy niggas ready for their body bag
I'mma a clown but I ain't the type that play with ya child
I'm the type that go chicka-blowe chicka blowe
Ya heard me, watch out when that thang in my hand
I'mma an untamed animal, straight a clean up man
Chorus 2X: 
I'mma animal in the jungle so you better beware
It ain't nothing but guerillas, lion, tigers, and bears
I'mma game red-nosed pit ready to scratch
Got you running like a bitch tryin to avoid the attack

I ain't no rabbit, I ain't no rat
I'mma a soldier that will give you hell
I ain't cat, I ain't no turtle get in beef and hide in a shell
I ain't no mutt, I ain't no monkie, far from being a duck
Believe me I can swim so come in that water, try your luck
You gonna drown, guarantee you go under you won't come up
I'm from Uptown and Uptown niggas don't give a fuck
My hood is a jungle full of niggas live that wild life
Picture a untamed guerilla with a K(AK) he nothing nice
So you know you get in his way, you lose your life
So reverse that, get in front of me, you lose your life
I'm like a alligator crocodile, quietly I lay
Then slip, get comfortable, I'll strike and kill a prey
Take the life out em', stand there and watch him stop breathing
Watch him fade into the other world, but one day I'll see him
But for now FUCK em', see ya when I see ya nigga
I know at this moment I wouldn't wanna be ya nigga
(Chorus)
I'm a lil' creeper, quick like a cheetah, so better (?????)
When I tell you freeze, when I was down for my heater
People say I'm dangerous, I need a leash and a collar
Cuz I'm like a ROCK (rocwilder) but much more wilder
If You got it, and I want it, I'll duct tape ya
Gotta a lock like a pit bull, get a hold of you and shake ya
Ain't now way You gone stomp at me, I feel you trying to play me
I'm like Mike when I bite, I give ya bitch ass Rabies
From tree to tree, block to block I be hanging
Nuts swanging, thuggin, fuck it I'm looking mangy
I gives a fuck, I live wild life like jungle animals
Catch Us gettin how we live on Discovery Channel
You gotta be a snake that creep and know how to survive
Pussy cats got nine lives, dogs like me got one life
So we gotta manage it
We feel threatened by anything we gotta handle it
We living scandalous

My clique made it known: we 'bout havin' things
Sport diamonds, so I know you gon' let us bling

They say I'm wrong, but I know you gon' let me do what I do
If I got it, I ain't gon' hide it - I show mine
I know you gon' respect it, I know you gon' let me shine
I know you ain't gon' step, I know you know I tote iron
Quick to bust, and I know you don' wan' die
You see eight Bentleys comin' on a late Sunday
I know you know that's Cash Money Millionaires comin'
We be layin' it down - don't give a fuck, nigga
We're from uptown, so I know you gon' let us stunt, nigga

You don't, get wetted - I know you gotta respect it
You don't want Geezy bringin' drama to your set'n'
I know you don't want sis, Mom, and daughter in black dresses

Don't be mad, I know you gon' let me be a hot boy

Say I changed - I'm rich, I know you gon' let me be good

If this nigga die, then a lot of niggas gon' die
If my momma cry, then a lot of mommas gon' cry

(?????) - fuck it
Someone gotta handle that
Checkmate, nigga

Nigga done crept down and put ten in my dog
He the only son, so you know his mom's goin' off
I wouldn't be a true nigga if I let this slide
Gotta saddle up - I gotta strap up and ride
My nigga momma gon' cry, then your momma gon' cry
One less in my clique, one in your clique gon' die
It's the game - you forgot it's eye for a eye
Body for body, so you gon' respect my mind
You done started somethin' I'ma take real far
Everyday is shootouts - you done started guerrilla war
It got me hurtin' to see my dog people in grief
So it's law I bring the same pain to your peeps
I'm dressed to kill: black-hooded, black souljas and 'Bauds
When I spot ya I'ma let the stop on the SK unfold
When you hear that: chukah-blauw!! chukah-blauw!!
I'm tellin' you it's too late to run now

If this nigga die, then a lot of niggas gon' die
If my momma cry, then a lot of mommas gon' cry
If this nigga die, then a lot of niggas gon' die
If my momma cry, then a lot of mommas gon' cry
If this nigga die, then a lot of niggas gon' die
If my momma cry, then a lot of mommas gon' cry
If this nigga die, there's gon' be consequences and repercussions - believe that

In the streets I gotta have that mind frame ""fuck it""
Gotta keep my nuts dropped - can't be fearin' nothin'
When you're thuggin', nigga always into somethin'
When you're hustlin', never know when nigga gon' say, ""Up it.""
My dog had a deal planned with some new connect
Barely knew 'em, and trust 'em - ain't wear his vest
He got there thinkin' the deal was gon' go sweet
They already had it planned to keep the money and ki's
They hit him up: two to the head, two to the chest, two to the neck
And left him there to meet his death
I feel guilty lettin' him go solo
Even though he told me, ""Chill"", I still should've rolled
So now I'm in some beef with niggas I barely know
I met 'em once, but I use to fuck one of they ho
I hit her up for some info and broke her off proper
Go to they hideout and release that chopper

If this nigga die, then a lot of niggas gon' die
If my momma cry, then a lot of mommas gon' cry
If this nigga die, then a lot of niggas gon' die
If my momma cry, then a lot of mommas gon' cry
If this nigga die, then a lot of niggas gon' die
If my momma cry, then a lot of mommas gon' cry
If this nigga die, then a lot of niggas gon' die -
Consequences and repercussions

This stank bitch that I grew up with in the hood
My nigga jocked her - I warned him that she was no good
But fuck me - he heard the pussy was the shit
He went, got caught up, got pussy-whipped
Every night he sleepin' by this stank bitch
And I told him she threw crosses and she'll set him up for shit
But he ain't listen, he tell me mind my biz
Now some niggas went there, took him out there and split his wig
I ain't know that's where he start to stash his yay
He knew better to keep work where his head gon' lay
But fuck that, I gotta put some iron on her
Gotta release all seventeen out the nine on her
One of my hoes saw her shakin' ass in the club
She hurried up, went to the phone and hit me up
I spinned 'round, saw her, and straight cut loose
Jive ho, this from him through me straight to you

If this nigga die, then a lot of niggas gon' die
If my momma cry, then a lot of mommas gon' cry
If this nigga die, then a lot of niggas gon' die
If my momma cry, then a lot of mommas gon' cry
If this nigga die, then a lot of niggas gon' die
If my momma cry, then a lot of mommas gon' cry

Besides that, sweetie, I'm just keepin' it real
Puttin' up with these crackers in this hot-ass field
But you know I'm a soldier - nigga try me, I'll spank him
But fuck all I said, it feel good to be the Baby Gangsta
Tell Moms I asked about her since she say I don't holla
And when I touch down, me and her gonna get us a bottle
Shorty, I've been hearin' that you've been wilin' out
Everyday of the week, and you tear the club doors down
What's happenin' with you, wodie? You doin' that cause we bound?
You doin' that cause for this lil' town I'm not around?
Don't get the game twisted - girl, better not try your luck
You know I ain't the one, you know quickly I'll fuck ya up
I'll be home next week - now I'ma keep it on the low

That minute that I had had done turned into a second
Got a day and a wake-up left, and I'll be steppin'
Straight through them iron gates - puttin' all this behind me
Come in the hood on V.L. - that's where you'll find me
Hoppin' out the limo, poppin' bottles - it's gravy
I know what it mean when I get that phone call from Baby
Let's go to the Mercedes, lock and cock somethin'
A hard-top six, or a drop six, that'll be lovely
My shorty think she got six more months to play
Can't wait to see that dick-look on her face
Right now I'm with the fellas, I'll go and see her later
Cause she tried to be a slick playa
But I ain't trippin' - it's cool, gotta respect me
Long as she don't get outta line in my presence
She still my shorty - gon' be my ho
Can't forget she was there everyday of my (?)

Now it's about that time I go fuck up her dome
Cause she have no idea that this hot boy home
It ain't been a day, and I'm already on chrome
I'm tryin' to imagin' her face, and how long
That it's gonna be when I hit the porch
And put my soulja Ree's through her front door
When she still think that she can have fun
And run with her girls for six more months
I'm cruisin' down the block slow, I pull up
Jumped out, said, ""What's up?"" She laid up there and threw up
""What's wrong? Don't act like you don't miss your nigga.""
She said, ""I do - I'm shocked.""
""Come here and kiss your nigga
I had to surprise ya because you piss your nigga off
You don't respect me pussy-poppin' on nobody wall

The lil pimp hopped out wrist lookin like a skittles blimp
Do not introduce me to your chic, that'll get her flip
I'ma try not to mention that I'm rich, but it'll slip
I really whipped the Z doin' a hundred and thirty
Come back doin 25 in a hunter Excursion
Open mouth and it'll beam like the sun is emergin
When I'm out, women scream like they thumbin a virgin
Hummers be swervin like I'm passin y'all in speeding go-carts
She think she look like a basketball season score chart
Hotter than a damn blow torch, you see me sizzlin
When your freak be missin, I got her twerkin n she be whistlin
Piece be glistenin every time it get a light reaction
Despite the braggin my chest brighter than Michael Jackson
BMW motorcycle drag racing dawg
That playas raw call'em ""Lil Wayne the Don""

B.Geezy let them niggas have it

I come through in somethin new, hoes hollerin' ""Look at him!""

Park the whip crooked, grab the heat, jump out
Everybody lookin and sayin ""damn he iced out""
The chain I got on costs more than your dream house (Damn!)

Say whodi look at your bitch - she drooling from the mouth (Eww!)
Wanna ride wit lil' B.G. and wildout
Don't trip, let her come dip wit me dawg
I share them lips wit Weezy 'til she get locked jaws
I'm a fool wit it, niggas know but don't want admit it

Cross the line I draw for ya - it's a killin (killin)

Nigga don't think I changed, I grew up doin good
Still: fuck, chill, and get my hair cut in the hood
Never forget where I come from, I'm too real
Never for get the days I had to get it how I live
But it's better now; I'm on another level now
I got cheddar now; I got my shit together now
I'm livin swell nigga, I'm givin hoes hell nigga
My broad is in order, I refuse to fail nigga
Benzos, Beamers, and Bentleys
Man I'm ballin, go to a dice game wit a hundred G's
Lose it - laugh about it - nigga like me don't miss it
Make a phone call get my bitch to come bring me 50
Shoot that, it's all gravy, I get that there from Baby
When I struggle niggas love me - now they can't take me

Every hood we think they be in we dippin'
Even through people, all through people yard

We ridin' all night, finally got lucky
We saw 'em chillin' back, turned on the block hustlin'
Hit the lights, park, jumped out, walked
Crept down on 'em, let them AK's bark

Went down the alley, went under the house, I went behind him
Caught him, then I ch-chopped him up

First time you're caught off your game, you drop, dog
I'm true to the game - ho, play for keeps
Pull up with the passenger drivin' way in the back seat
I don't give a fuck, never did, been real
Since I was young been seein' cats get killed
When it get dark better be able to run quick
Cause after that, that chopper gonna talk shit

I'm on a mission to leave they family grievin'
Cut my dog life short, now I gotta teach 'em
I'ma (?) and send work to (??)

Told me if I feel played do what I gotta do
Nowadays I don't play with that K in my hand

Uptown where I'm from - V.L. my stumpin' ground
Get outta line, I empty a drum at ya, clown
I'm a dog, dog - I'm tellin' ya I'm raw, dog

Remember I was seven, put my hands on my first weapon
Daddy taught me how to pop a clip in a Mack-11
Ever since that, I fell in love with guns
Saved my allowance for a month and got me one
My cousin taught me how to shoot a nine, and it was on
Nigga made me feel played, I had to upset his home

I up that AK-47 and start to sling it

When you see me, all you gon' see is ""flucka-flucka-flame!!""
Brains on the ground - yellow tape all around
People sayin', ""That had to be a nigga from uptown.""
When I'm lose, I'm lose - when I'm strapped, I'ma use it
Cause I ain't gon' have that in my hand and don't shoot it
I'ma abuse it - bust hollows like Cupid bust arrows
I only put hollow tips in my barrel

What’s That Smell,Checkmate,2000,"Ohhh
Man, somethin' stank
Ooohh
You smell that?
I don't know what that is
Killin' is like a hobby: somethin' that B.G. do for fun
It don't help to run - I'll empty 'em all out the drum
When it come down to one-eight-seven I don't play
When it come down to you or me, it won't be me
Got quick hands, call me ""Quick Draw"", I'll draw first
Hit ya, loosen up your head, watch your shit burst
Been about gun-play, puttin' bustas on T-shirts
Creepin' down the one-way lettin' that AK work
Ain't too many niggas I beef with still here
Might could count a few rollin' 'round in a wheelchair
Nigga know my background - so, cowards, stay your distance
Know if you get into it with me you get splitted
Know you could cause your momma or sister to come up missin'
It could be broad daylight - I'll walk up and twist 'em
I don't give a motherfuck - act like ya know
If not, then ask the police for my M.O
(Hook-4x )
 God damn!!! What's that smell?
  That's that nigga who will never get well

I'll make sure that a nigga is cooked and well-done
Stand over the bitch - give it to him one by one
I gotcha down bad, I'ma leave ya, cousin
No matter what time it is, I'ma leave ya, cousin
A nigga won't go in that ocean for ya - bring it on
Do or die, nigga - you or me gon' be gone
I ain't scared at all - my nuts hang low, wodie
Try sizin me up, that ass gotta go, wodie
Six under the dirt
Is where you'll be fuckin' with this nigga: Turk
I'll knock your head off, put your back in your chest
Play the same twitch straight to the project
Just chill - sit back and lay low
Stay on my p's and q's - keep the four-four
You know how it go: give bitch-niggas hell
And I'll make sure they'll never get well
(Hook )
 God damn!!! ( They hollerin') What's that smell?
  That's that nigga who will never get well
 God damn!!! What's that smell?
  That's that nigga who will never get well
 God damn!!! ( They hollerin') What's that smell?
  That's that nigga who will never get well
 God damn!!! ( They hollerin') What's that smell?
  That's that nigga who will never get well

I got bad nerves - don't make me click if I do
What happen after I finish with you is on you
I warned you - you can't never say I didn't
Brains painted on the ground when I stop spittin'
""To society I'm a menace"" is what the judge said to me
Trippin' 'cause I keep a automatic that's fully
Finger stay on the trigger - see my enemy, I'm pullin'
Bitch-nigga say he feel me, laughed at me, say I wouldn't
You know Geezy couldn't let that slide by
I do walk-up's, never drive-by's
Grab a nigga by his head, whisper to him 'fore I do him
""Why,"" I said, ""you're here, wodie?"" - execute him
That there raw, huh - I know, nigga
Geezy ain't no ho, nigga
Been cutthroat, been playin' the game how it go, nigga
So if you like livin', mind your own business
Or you gonna be traced in white chalk, ya here me
(Hook )
 God damn!!! What's that smell?
  That's that nigga who will never get well
 God damn!!! ( They hollerin') What's that smell?
  That's that nigga who will never get well
 God damn!!! ( They hollerin') What's that smell?
  That's that nigga who will never get well
 God damn!!! ( They hollerin') What's that smell?
  That's that nigga who will never get well

Never get well
He'll never get well (Damn, that stank!)
Never get well
Where that shit comin' from? Man, that stank!
Hell, you see, man, where that shit comin' from?
That shit stank
I think that's comin' from under the house over there
Oh no no, that shit comin from that trunk of that car we just walked by
I don't know where that shit comin' from
I know that shit stank",https://genius.com/Bg-baby-gangsta-whats-that-smell-lyrics
Bounce With Me,Checkmate,2000,"I fuck with them junkies, killers, and car jackers
Niggas who stalk niggas with work and kidnap 'em
Them ballers with T's, stunnas and head bustas
Niggas who pimp platinum Benzes and bubble-eye Hummers
If you're ballin', then ball - you're shinin', keep shinin'
You're grindin' at the top when you get out, man, keep grindin'
See me, B.G. - original H.B
Was taught comin' up motherfuck the police
I keep it real with the real - that's all I know, nigga
Comin' up 'round my way you couldn't be a ho, nigga
Ask Baby and Slim, they saw B.G. grow, nigga
They witnessed me slingin' that llello, my nigga
Had work and I knew it - I come in your door, nigga
Tie your family up - they all got on the floor, nigga
By all means, whatever it takes to get green
I do cause I wanna bling - I wanna bling bling
(Hook )
I got to bounce, nigga
Bounce like you just flipped two chickens, nigga

I'm on probation, got me, I can't smoke no blunts
A dirty urine 'll have me baggin' up thirty-six months
Just touched down, so I gots to lay low and be cool
But I keep that heat with me because these niggas is fools
I do this for my street niggas, my thugged out
Go-and-drop-off-a-ki niggas, stackin'-that-cheese niggas
Straight-'bout-beef niggas
Dressin'-in-black-shootin'-up-the-whole-street niggas
This is for my niggas
I ain't nothin' but a lil' young Cash Money thug
Only thing I was taught comin' up was guns and drugs
So my thoughts is fucked up - I'm on some other shit
Like if-I-can't-get-you-I-kidnap-your-mother shit
Or duct-tape-your-brother shit, and turn yourself in
Turn on the weed eater and swept him 'til I get my n's
I've been affiliated with killers all my life
That's how I am cause all my role models weren't right, so-
(-Hook )

It's on if it's on - I'll ride or die, don't give a fuck
Drama: I love it - I'm trigga happy, can't get enough
The streets is my home - that's all I know
I hustle to beat ya outshinin' - drive off the showroom floor
Baby, Beatrice, my nigga, Bryan, and Bubba
Taught me how to rep - taught me how to be a lil' stunna
He told me don't worry 'bout nothin', get my grind on
Let my paper stack, let it be known I got my grind on
Gotta have platinum chain, platinum watch, platinum ring
It's the year 2G - a nigga like me gotta have things
Ain't no nigga gon' cross me cause I'm made
No busta gon' stop my bounce or attempt to stop my bling
If you really try me then I bring out my choppy
Cause I know if I hold 'em right then that nigga got me
From the east, to the west, up north, and down south, nigga
Got twenty 'round your neck, poke your chest out and bounce, nigga
From the east, to the west, up north, and down south, nigga
Got twenties on your whip, poke your chest out and bounce, nigga

Got twenty on your wrist, throw your hand out and bounce, nigga

Bitch-ass nigga, catch your cut
We got this shit, wodie

Back where I started on my set in black (Uh-huh)
Hopped out the passenger side of my 'Lac (Then what?)
Under my nuts was two ounces of crack (Yeah?)
My lil' nigga, Geezy, say he needed a stack (For sure)
Fronted my lil' wodie a ounce of crack
The bricks look the same, but them youngsters be strapped
From snortin' dope smokin' momo's, and jackin'
Old folks scared that's why they be snappin' (What?)
Callin the law, look-a-who'n and rattin'
I told the young nigga to learn to mack
Pop in a Too $hort tape

""Born to Mack""

We hard-headed head bustas
We don't give a fuck - untamed motherfuckers
Jumped off the porch as a young motherfucker (What?)
My momma's dead (what)
My daddy's dead (What?)
My brother's a dope fiend, I'm duckin' the Fed (You lyin')
Word got around that a nigga was paid (Yeah?)
Supplied the whole uptown - word was said (Yeah?)
With quarters and halves (Yeah?), chickens and bricks (Yeah?)
Bundles of dope and ounces and shit
We drive Bentley's and Jags (What?),Corvettes and bikes (What?)
Two Mercedes Wagons with kits and lights (What?)

Twenty-inch momo's with a-thousand a bet (For sure)

Well, this the one, lil' daddy: fuck that bitch (Fuck her)

They want to be with a nigga when your money come right (for real?)
When shit get bad, them hoes clean outta sight (For real?)

Baby got the bitch, and he put her in a movie
Triple-X rated (Huh?)
Joe Casey say, ""The bitch ate it.""

Big Tymers don't trust hoes

Twenty's on Bentley's, and Prowlers, and Jaguars
Cadillac's, and Benzes, and Beamer's, and fast cars
Houses and mansions with marble and mink floors
Movie-screen TV's with automatic glass doors
Hoes say they love me, but friendships don't last, though
We rich but we fucked up from shit with the last hoes
The dollar ain't on the chest, the body is still tatted
Ride or die for CMR - get outta line, get battered
Lil' Wheezy more platted
Baby more platted
Big Tymers, Hot Boys, and them sharks - they all gatted
My watch thirty karats - Suga Don the grand-daddy
Rappers, while you're hatin' your car, we now have it
(?) we move packages, (?) jack it
Man stood and rest in piece - head bustas was his jackin'
Dog, when I grow up, I want to be just like me:
A millionaire, bobbin' his head to a Mannie Fresh beat
And I swear under my shirt, June Miami heat
Around my neck with some fingers'll last 'til January

Problems,Checkmate,2000,"I've got problems
In my fucking house
Bitch would you please
Get the fuck out

Trust these hoes, they all slick
I found out, they ain't shit
Almost was played by my main bitch
Ohh Boy, she tried to pull 1 off quick
I'm paperchasing, trying to get rich
On a 60 day tour with my clique
She hit me while I'm on the road and was like
Bae shit bad can moms spend a few nights?
I say Yeah, when its cool
But now, check what this hoe do
Slickly moving momma in my house
Cause picture the whole wild she put out
Now dat ain't even the half of it
With moms come 2 neices, 2 nephews, 2 cousins
They don' got comfortable in my shit
Children dont flush the toilet after they piss
Bitches, piles, kids, jumping and playing
Breaking lamps, wasting food and leaving stains
Mom laying in my lazy boy
Kids jamming tapes in my VCR
Flicking my TV like a light switch
God can only stop me from killing this bitch
I'm on the way back to my crib
I pull up, ""this can't be where I live""
I jump out ready, to start fucking
I'm pissed off, mad and disgusted
Bitch tryna give me a excuse
It ain't nothing you can say or do
You ask could Mom stay cause it was bad...
You ain't said nothing bout cha whole fam
Look at my shit, it's fucked up
And it smell like a project cut
You ain't had the decency to clean up
You, ya ma, and children, can pack up
Please hurry before I go off
And mess around in here and catch a charge
You don showed me, you ain't shit
You showed me, a bitch gon be a bitch
Look what you don caused in my house
Before you get pistol whipped, Bitch get out!


Here's another fucked up episode
My cousin came to visit from Chicago
I ain't seen em' since we was young bucks
I turned thug, he's a wannabe but a busta
So why he down visiting, he staying wit me
I put him under surveilence learned him in a week
He don't put 100% in his hygiene
He lied and stopped bout what he doing be in the streetz
He eating, he shitting, he sleeping, all for free
He ain't cleaning behind his self, he think it's the double tree
I'm almost to the point to ask him
Whats happening? But I know, he get smart, I'ma slap him
Now I gotta leave him by his self for the weekend
I gotta fly to handle business in Cleaveland
I jet and this nigga go through my phone numbers
Call em', tell him I got him a surprise party, come over
So happen that I'm finished a day early
And decide to fly back home and check on this bitch
I get down, fucked up my shit packed like a nightclub
Sofa's ripped, tape is broke and it's full of weed smokers
Nigga got it coming, every tooth in his mouth
I'ma knock-out, I can't believe what he did to my house


Look at this shit, Getcha lil stankin' ass kids
Ya know what im saying? Your uncle over there wearing my T-shirt
That motherfucker like what, he must be like 54' inches or something like that and I just wear a 1X, and we got Tyrone and lil Tyronisha, Thats ignorant like a Mother fucker to name that lil girl Tyronisha, and Clarence and Uncle ray, Yo lil brothers and all that shit let em' get the fuck up outta here, fucking up everything...Ya know what im saying?

Huh (Huh)
What (What - what)

Look
If I had the world, dog, I'd make hustlin' good
And if I could I'd put work every hustler's hood

I can't lie - this world is scary to me
I carry two gats - you won't hear nobody buryin' me

None of my people would have to pay tax or bills
Even all the new niggas oughtta average a mill

If I could change the score, we'd never hustle no more
And every bizite that I lizight 'll be like ""whoa""

And the police would be for here only for the old folks
So if we have a problem, we strap up and hold court

If I could change it - man, if the world was mine
Nobody'd have to take nothin' cause we'd all shine

If I ruled the world, nigga wouldn't have no beef
It'll be a decline in the murder rate on the streets

If the world was mine we wouldn't need no killers
We'll put A/C in these project windows


If I could change the world
I'd make it much better for you and me
I'd erase these hard times we had, yeah
And we'd ball 'til we fall - can you feel that?
Yeeeeeaaaaahhhhh

Come on, let's do this shit - yo, my party don't quit
And every record Cash Money put out 'll be a hit

I'd dig a ditch for the hatas, put 'em deeper with that
And I could murder a nigga and wouldn't spend a week in the pen

Man, we'd all have houses, a half-a-block
We'd all be on chrome in a Benz drop-top

All the women would be big, fine with a cute face
And the children would be the kind that stay in they place

If the world was mine I'd unite my peeps
My mom and my dad would be in this world with me

But if a nigga still trip, you can hit him with Glock
And just to keep it real I'll bring back Biggie and Pac

Man, we'd all get along - we'll be a family
That's just how it'll be if this world was for me

If I ruled the world, wouldn't be no politics
Blacks would have a lot of shit - that Bentley and that Prowler shit



More blunts to smoke up on the streets with peace
Without a worry on our mind, not duckin' police

If we could go back in time, you could have what's mine
That's for shig my nig - we ain't gotta slang that iron

Play the block all day without runnin' and duckin'
And everybody drugs raw - they don't cut it with nothin'

It ain't mine - I just gotta get it how I live
Can't question God on what He made a biz what it is

If I ruled the world, my family wouldn't fight
Everything in order - everybody all right

If the world was mine I'll still be grindin'
I'll flip big blocks for Bria and Bryan

And if you move a hundred bricks, you get a Benz for free
Oh yeah, and Beyonce'll have twins for me

Man, if this world was for the lil' B.G
Everybody'd be straight, everybody'd live sweet - uh-huh

You'll never catch me broke on my ass
You would catch me gettin' head in a Jag
Won't see me jockin' a hoodrat ho
Would see me browsin' on a Benz show floor
Never no more see me on a block with rocks
Stuffed in my 'Bauds: see two plastic Glocks
You won't see me with this ride I rented or stole
Only when I'm in it if it's a two-triple-o
That's the new life for lil' B.G
Bubbles and Hummers, Burbans with TV's
Beamers and 'Lacs, bikes, Tahoe's and Volvo's

You'd see me pimpin' a Bentley, blunted out
In a Benz on my way to the line, stunted out
Hoes see me comin', they runnin' out
To the street to hop in the passenger seat to give me mouth
You know it's very often you'd see
Out in the streets, nigga flossin' like B.G
When I do it, I do it like no one else
Chain fuck their vision up - got 'em hollerin' ""help""
So you know it gotta be nice, gotta be bright
Nothin' less than ten karats 'll stop blue ice
Baguettes 'round the end - all in the middle: flooded
It's princess-cutted - can't do nothin' but love it
That's a example for ""Hater, don't give me my props""
Can't be 'round that type cause he'll baller block
Fuck with me, your head missin' - the bitch gone
Body alone

Neck worth twenty, wrists worth forty, ears worth ten
But to me that ain't nothin' to spend
Car worth eighty, inside worth 'bout thirty
Can't put it on the street 'til buttons on her feet
But the gear don't change: still wear Ree's, 
still wear 'Bauds
Still wear T's - you know how it go
Now check this out: crib plushed out, worth about a mill
One on the water, one on the hill
Game don't change - still hustle to maintain
Ten stacks a month of bills to contain
Now, I'm ""Bling Bling Slim"" - you know him
Keep work stashed in all four of my rims
Two pearl Glocks: one in my hand, one taped to the dash
Cause I gotta ride like that
Stay schemin' on paper, and more paper
Cause I wanna be - gotta be - number-one bling-blinger

Nigga know I hate his guts, so he don't cross my path
Cause he know I've been survivin' all of the wars I had
Bitch-nigga called hisself killin' my dog
But he didn't, though, so I'm tyin' up him and his broad
Betta say somethin', and it betta be what I wanna hear
I'm listenin' - scary bitches started shittin' and pissin'
You might see him on a milk carton, dog - he still missin'
Somebody might catch him up on a hook when they fishin'
Look, I've been itchin' to get bitches, money, and jewels
I know some nigga's got a package - I'ma run with the fool
Through the years older playaz told me to keep my head strong
Cause niggas is followers, and some of 'em led wrong
But if I bust a cap in 'em, I will be dead wrong
They don't know what's happenin', and I ain't gonna say it to 'em
Cause bitches be catchin' conversation inspectin'
And fuck up and give them people some bad information

Now point the nigga out if he wan' do it with me
Step to the front of the line, let me see who you be
Air and opportunity - that ain't nothin' to me
Look, I got somethin' I'm totin' that'll cut you in three
(""One! Two! Three! Kick it!"")

You'se a certified clown in my eyes
That's the reason why half of your hood got shit bags on your side
You talk a good game, but you a ho when they ride
Nigga don't have to look for you - they know you inside
You probly got your tail in your ass, your thumb in your mouth
Protected custody so you don't come in your house
Motherfucker, where all the shit you said you was 'bout?
Let you tell it - you been 'bout bustin' heads in the south

Can't be fuckin' with no lame, fake
Ain't even gon' watch your back, nigga
Get popped - can't handle the pressure and rat, nigga
Take the whole clique down runnin' his lips
Can't come back in the bricks now, he'll get flipped
It's a cold game, but I don't give a fuck, my nigga
I feel threatened by anybody, I'ma bust that nigga up my nigga
Then go get a mill, fuck my bitch -
I take this game to heart, unless niggas disagree


I'm a lil' man - stand my ground no matter what
Glock glued to my hand - there's no one you can trust
Niggas turned on they own nigga behind Geez
If I think they won't turn on me, I'm outta luck
So I roll first - cock and shoot first
Gotta stay over the head to duck a T-shirt
You want beef? You want war? You want me?
Nothin' between us but air and opportunity
Don't talk 'bout what you gon' do - do it, nigga
Cause you're wastin' your breath - go 'head, prove it, nigga

Time's money - I ain't got time to waste
But on the straight with me bein' real
To let others' niggas know I don't fake - ya gotta get killed
Oh, bitch-nigga playin' with a rich nigga like me
Ya wind up six feet, clown


Step up!
Wherever the fuck you is, nigga
Don't throw a motherfuckin' brick
And hide your hand like a ol' pussy-ass, nigga

Come out to the light, nigga - let me see who you is
You wan' do me somethin' or harm my kids, nigga, show your face
Make it known you're beefin' with me
Know wh'I'm sayin'
Ol' scary-ass nigga gon' hide
Come out here, playa - catch me all over New Orleans, nigga
On the block, in the hood, wherever
B.G., nigga, always on V.L
We gon' keep it real - know wh'I'm sayin'

He Used 2 Be a Man,Checkmate,2000,"Oh you gonna be trippin' bout this busta ass nigga

When he was on the streets he used to jack niggas
Ran around the project toting the mac nigga
He had niggas tip had em breaking him off
He had niggas clearing the block when it got dark
Now everybody thought that this nigga was real
But anybody holding a gun can kill
If niggas was on the block they ran when he came
He used to walk on the set and rob the dice game
This nigga was a dog out here in that world
Now he got to the pen and turned the girl
He walking like a bitch this nigga here twistin'
The bitch even sittin' down now when he pissin'
He hugged up with a man on the wall tongue kissin'
He family fucked up they don't even go visit
Now that's the difference between jail and the streets
With a gun you a killa
Without it you're a thrilla

When you was on the streets you was a solja
And then you got fucked when you went to Angola
You hit the fucking wall with all that mouthin' off
And then you showed fear when you got round them big dogs
When you was on the streets you was a solja
And got turned out when you went to Angola
You hit the fucking wall with all that mouthin' off
And showed your true colors when you got round them big dogs

This nigga used to catch ballas slippin' and jack em
This nigga used to catch bad bitches and mack em
He used to serve niggas work out of town and tax em
He used to take hits walk up on niggas and wack em
This nigga here name used to carry weight
Nigga passed with they head down couldn't look in his face
This nigga used to act a fool with a .44
Now he in the pen getting' shot in his go go
I had a feeling without that strap he was a hoe
Now it came out he done got that lifetime Joe
Damn that's somethin' niggas is a trip
They don't open they lip if they ain't got a full clip
Shit never changed doing the same thang
On the streets ya bout it
In that place you're a jing-a-ling
With a gat you a man nowadays your with out it
You needed to be bout it
Cause you soft than soap powder


When you walking up the street with that heat ya creepin'
When you walking down the walk that pink ya sweppin'
When ya standin' over a nigga with that k you a dog
When you getting' that dick from the back you're a broad
You was a man puttin' niggas under white sheets
Now that g-string up your ass you the beauty of the week
Nigga told ya that out that here doing that crime
Take it like a man you get popped then you get that time
You sayin' that you cool and you can handle it
Before you got upstate you barely ate in the parish
You ain't got a gun now ain't even got a knife
You had two charges whodi fuck a fight
You can't take a ass whooping ya weaker than weak
Now ya getting your ass rubbed down with grease
You're a clown nobody feels sorry on the block
Ya got get it how ya live in that cell block

My wodies who slangin' rocks after rocks
My Big Tymers with the whole and quarter things
My hot girls who bring work on a airplane
My street-smart thugs who know how to think
And throw the Feds off and put 'em on a train
Can't forget thugs who be shinin', doin' they thing

U Know How We Do,Checkmate,2000,"(Gibberish noises)
Look, look, look
I pass with the top off like my car was named Lil' Kim
The lil pimp hopped out wrist lookin like a skittles blimp
Do not introduce me to your chic, that'll get her flip
I'ma try not to mention that I'm rich, but it'll slip
I really whipped the Z doin' a hundred and thirty
Come back doin 25 in a hunter Excursion
Open mouth and it'll beam like the sun is emergin
When I'm out, women scream like they thumbin a virgin
Hummers be swervin like I'm passin y'all in speeding go-carts
She think she look like a basketball season score chart
Hotter than a damn blow torch, you see me sizzlin
When your freak be missin, I got her twurkin n she be whistlin
Piece be glistenin every time it get a light reaction
Despite the braggin my chest brighter than Michael Jackson
BMW motorcycle drag racing dawg
That playas raw call'em ""Lil' Wayne the Don""

When we come through you know how we do, dog
(shoo, shoo) up the insterstate with the roof off
We be shinin in diamonds very blue, dog
Just the life in the ice'll make ya cool off

Damn, I like to rep, I like to shine, I like to look good

B.Geezy let them niggas know

I come through in somethin new, hoes hollerin' ""Look at him!""
That be the Hot Boy they call ""Bling Bling Slim""
Park the whip crooked, grab the heat, jump out
Everybody lookin and sayin ""damn he iced out""
The chain I got on costs more than your dream house
Presidential Roley, don't even want talk about
Say whodi look at your bitch - she drooling from the mouth
Wanna ride wit lil' B.G. and wildout
Don't trip, let her come dip wit me dawg
I share them lips wit Weezy 'til she get locked jaws
I'm a fool wit it, niggas know but don't want admit it
It's cool, long as you respect me, I'm chillin
Cross the line I draw for ya - it's a killin
It's gonna be click, clack blucka, blucka brain spillin
Until then I'm reppin, Stuntin flossed out
You see me if you up north and I'm down south

Nigga don't think I changed, I grew up doin good
Still: fuck, chill, and get my hair cut in the hood
Never forget where I come from, I'm too real
Never for get the days I had to get it how I live
But it's better now; I'm on another level now
I got cheddar now; I got my shit together now
I'm livin swell nigga, I'm givin hoes hell nigga
My broad is in order, I refuse to fail nigga
Benzos, Beamers, and Bentleys
Man I'm ballin, go to a dice game wit a hundred G's
Lose it - laugh about it - nigga like me don't miss it
Make a phone call get my bitch to come bring me 50
True that, it's all gravy, I get that there from Baby
When I struggle niggas love me - now they can't take me
But as long as they don't fuck wit me - I don't worry bout'em
But if they fuck wit me - you gone have to worry bout'em

And my lil' king, ya heard me
Lil' Christopher and lil' Christiane, ya know
Look man (mumbling)
My two fa-shiggity, ya understand
And everything else is like
They all, ya know, impossible, ya heard me
I love my children ya heard me
My children love me, yes they do
I could never be no dead-beat, ya understand
Never be no part time, never, never, believe that
Look

Now my son
He ain't three years yet
Ooo he could walk and he could talk a lil' bit
But I bet when he get to that stage I'll tell him
Don't be like daddy, fuck up, become a young convicted felon
Go to school, get an education, say no to drugs
Still be a smart hot boy and lil' thug
Fuck bitches, be 'bout money and duck snitches
Don't let nothing come between you and your riches
Respect momma, listen to everything that she says
It's guaranteed to pay off on judgement day
Believe as long as I breathe, uh, I'm here for you
To tell the truth I dont want you to go through what I went through
My daddy got killed, on me when I was twelve
Fell victim to the game and gave grandma hell
Back forth in jail, stealing cars and shit
Smoking 'gars and shit, bothering by the laws and shit
But uh, believe I'll teach you another route
Watch how good everything turn out

For lil' Christopher, I'll go out my way
And for Christiane, I'll go out my way
For my son and my daughter, I'll go out my way
I'll give my life for 'em both any time, any day
For my lil' nigga, I'll go out my way
And for my lil' princess, I'll go out my way
For my son and my daughter, I'll go out my way
I'll give my life for 'em both, any time, any day

Now my daughter
She so pretty and so smart
I'll take her to the park, she ride her Barbie car
She say daddy I love ya
I say I love you too
I miss my lil' angel, tell me whatcha wanna do
We can go see a movie, go to Chucky E. Cheese
Anything and anywhere ya wanna go, that's on me
Always count on me, if not, then wait for it
Dont let a nigga make ya take off ya skirt for it
Dont let a nigga make ya take off ya shirt for it
Don't do nothing you'll end up getting your feelings hurt for it
This just game
And it's coming from me to you
I'll never tell you nothing wrong
This here from me to you
It ain't nothing you can't have in this world

Look, I'ma get in the game you heard me
Women, over here come listen, tell em
If you ain't been with a nigga, its too late
In the game, for a nigga to be making a bitch feel lead
You'll wanna get it right, and when you get it right
You'll wanna keep it right, look
A real nigga is hard to come by, believe it

Girl I can't believe you, how you gon
Turn around and bite the hand that feeds you
The way I break my back, good as I treat you
I keep saying this, I'ma really have to seat you
I'd hate to see the outcome, if I leave you
But its cause I wanna be, its not because I need you
You don't wanna be careful, why should I try to keep you
Nigga gon fuck, then he gone in a week or two
Them same hoes you be repping to, believe it or not, the same hoes
Behind your back, run and tell me, each and everything you do
You better wake up, and pay attention
Realize your partnas wanna ask you out, to get to yo position
I guarantee they got they man cuffed, if he say no that mean no
They can't go there, ain't gon huff and puff
That's a done deal, you better keep it real
You better, realize who pay your bills

Them hoes be acting up
They gon make a nigga bat em up
I'm sorry bitch, but I done had enough
Man I'ma leave this bitch in handcuffs
I say you hoes be acting up
You gon make a nigga bat you up
I'm sorry bitch, but we done had enough
We gon fuck around, and leave this bitch in handcuffs

Now see this what I'm talking bout, you out here running round
With them knuckle head, fucking give head hoes
Bring em to your house, then walk around in they bad clothes
You sneaking to the club with em, when I be on the map, that's cold
But its cool, cause my mama never raised no fool
We was in school, you had a nigga when I played on you
I shoulda seen it, but I was too caught up on the grind
In the blind, you knew I stayed with other shit on my mind
But all it did was take time, to show me the light
No I can't put this one behind, so you can go head and kite
So tell them hoes that there, and see what they say
They can't fuck you, but I can knock them off any day
So get your hand out my face, 'fore I bat you in yours
You should of, stayed in your place now the tables done turned
And everything I gave you, bitch I struggled to earn
Get your purse you gotta skate, you lucky you don't get burned


Girl don't play dumb, you know who made you
Everything you want you get, everything you got I gave you
I took you from hard times and saved you
In the best of everything I laced you
Made it where no one could fade you, sometimes I hate you
I love you to death, but the way you act
I know that's not the way, that Lil B.Gizzle raised you
I'm on the verge, about to shake you, don't forget
I'm a paid nigga getting sick of, you trying to be slicker
Tripping, trying to build fake cases, a house
Your clothes, your feature and supplied transportation
And that's how you gon do a nigga, mentally abuse a nigga
You gon regret trying to use a nigga, you this close from bout to lose this nigga
Man they got hoes all over the world, that wish they knew this nigga
See one time threw with you, I'm threw with you
Ain't nothing that I could do with you, but try to be cool with you

R.I.P.,Livin’ Legend,2003,"Wassup man
Look, this for my people
You heard me my dog
Man I miss my dog
My dog know I miss him to
But I feel it man
I feel them all in my heart
I know you right here, right with me
Man just riding on with his niggas
You heard me, I miss a lot of people
They know I miss them to
Look

Nigga took half for my heart
When they killed my dog
Ruined every last dream that we had to ball
Me and this nigga was like brothers
Since we was small
I needed anything he was the first I'd call
He was down the road with me
If I got in beef
By fucking them hoes with me
He was H-O-T
Kept it real and representing
Via-13 got a little girl
I treat like it's for me
And a lot of hoes conversation
It's B.G and L.T
Never had a friend like him
He never had a friend like me
Snorted half a grand of dope
On the flight together
Broke trying to make all night together
Now Lil' Ten gon' be a part
Of my life forever
Wish Lord wouldn't of took you to rest you
Look me and my dog broke bread together
Hot, fucking hoes in the same bed together

Of top, it's all gravy, you in six feet
Just remember I love you, so Rest In Peace
I still can't believe you left out here solo
I'm doing the damn thing for me and you both
Off top, it's all gravy, you in six fett
But remember I love you, so Rest In Peace
I still can't believe you left me out here solo
But I'm fucking hoes for me and you both

1997, November I had bad days in my life
It looked like that was the worst
Niggas shot my round like a dog
Left him for dead
Chest bust wide open
Non-stop he blead
Just the day before we talked about gettin sober
In the blink of an eye
My whodi life is over
I know there's a good reason
Why the good Lord chose you
I know when your at your real
Cause down here you was a soldier
Always said ""Doogie, you can't be faded""
Always said ""Doogie you gon' make it""
And I made It
I wish you were here to see
It's all gravy, I know you want me to let that be
Man I hate it
I know you don't want me to be weak
So when I sheine, you shine
It's off the T-O-P
You was the Livin' Legend in the UPT
Do me a favor you and my daddy look down on me


You should see I'm balling out of control
I just got a deal with Koch for six zeros
And I had to be heavenly baby and niggas was hoes
They wasn't playin the game
Hot Gold, it's over, it's cool
I'm a gangsta in the game I know the street rules
And I miss all my people that's resting in peace
And I miss all my people that's six feet deep
You heard me


Believe that
You know I'm holding it down ya heard me
Man I miss you with a passion dog
But I know where you at
You know what I'm sayin, that you holding down
And I know you got a place for me
And I know you done met my daddy ya heard me
And y'all done got the fahotion y'all know what I'm sayin
Ya'll just looking down and sayin
""Man that little nigga doing hid thing""
Cause I am doing my thing
And kiss my grandma for me ya heard me
Man do that for me dog
Kiss both of them for me ya heard me
I'm sayin man I'll see you when I get there
And I got to say Rest In Peace to all my dogs uptown ya heard me

Because if I forget some body

So it's a bunch of y'all man

So you know I'm bout to check that ass
Gotta check that ass

I know you trying to feel where I've been
Laid back, ducked off, paper chasing
Ducking, dodging the pen
On the road trying to make it shake
Rap hustlin' from state to state
I got cheddar to make
Also got cash for days
Pies to push, blocks to move
Coke to sell 36 ounces for 22
And I still got the block in me
Glock with me, feds post up watching me
Me and my clique got a shop
Bust the game wide open
Once it was down man you know we had to hold it
All of the sudden niggas head's start swelling
Money, fame, and power turn niggas heads to melons
Mo money, mo feddy, mo niggas got greedy
Knowing I'ma piece of the puzzle that's needed
How you gone not break bread with B. Geezy?
Break bread with B. Geezy
You don't want me to shine nigga

This is the club scene, where them ballas at
Chicken sweating you threatin', mo' getting VIP we setting
We taking care of the whole section, with liquor
Marijuana smoke in the back, where Gar be at
Big trucks on 22's, loud sounds with screens
Who up in there, that got them chickens fixing they hair
And getting naked full of Cristal, that's the lifestyle
So I hit the club, with a pocket full of Lifestyles
Ooh shorty getting wild, now put your hands in the air
While you do that dance, and let me get behind you
While you in front of my man, in front of your man
Chill gun on my waist, with a blunt in my hand
We spending a grand on Bubbly, round for round
That's how the Chopper City mob, get down
Hydro in the bottle, with the yellow wrapper
And you playas better, hold your broads
Cause these boys, will snatch her

Party's gon be bumping
Playas gon be stomping
Get your ass on the dance floor
And let Moet, and Cristal flow

I know you know of me, Sniper playa baby
I hold it down full of Mo' and Crown, it make the kid move
Quick, too much Vodka make me nervous bad
I'm popping bottles every hour, making Erkles mad
I left the scene, swerved past in a purple Jag
You heard of trap, ladies love me you perverted fags
I rock the house like it's church, yeah I love the Lord
Play with my team, Chopper City it's gon be murder mass you heard me
Know you love the way that gangstas play it, we drank and blazing
Till ancient ages, this ain't for babies
So ease your nerves, play your girl like she easing surf
Cause chill what's beneath my shirt, have you bleeding syrup
I ain't tripping if you need that work, Sniper pull up in a Viper
With a rifle, that'll mean your smirk
Flows make my people lean, and twerk
I hit the track and beat it up like Ike and Tina Turner, it's Chopper City man


Now y'all already know, Uptown in here
I got my seventeen rounds in ya, we blowing pounds in ya
And you know, where I'm found in here
Last week they had a body, left found in here
And with the drank getting smoked, the bottles is popping
We ain't even make it to the party, and girls jocking
It's Hakizzle, you know the name girl
Just write your number down, and I'll give you a ring girl
I don't mean, to snatch your chicks playa
But the bar need chips playa, look at my wrist playa
The hood call me, Young Neno
Cause I'm quick to snatch your senorita, or hit the block with a kilo
Calm down homeboy, you messing up my groove
Yeah iight you smoking, give me a Kool
We stunt round year, ride in convertibles
Them Chopper City dudes'll murder you, holla back Kizzle


Me and my click at the scene, straight tearing it down
Ball till we fall, believe we laying it down
The party off the hook, when Chopper City arrive
Thugging popping bottles, until the sun rise
It's going down, it's going dizzle, it's going diggity
We from Uptown, off the hizzle off the higgity
I know you feeling me fa shiggity, Baby Gizzle
Baby Geezie, Baby Gangsta popping pistols
I'll flip you, straight switch you four nickel
With me, I won't miss you I got the pistol
Hoes jocking niggas hating, can't take us
Can't fade us, we ball just like the Lakers
I'm off the hinges, off the chain respect the game
The number one Hot Boy, ain't nothing changed
I'm thugged out getting twisted, bucking hard
Tearing the roof off, the party jumping hard

Don’t Talk to Me,Life After Cash Money,2004,"Boy, I fell off like a bad bag of dope, Ya heard me
Ain't nobody wanna holla
I done shook back like a 4 and a half heart
Now everybody wanna holla
If you ain't keep it real, I don't wanna holla
Chorus:
Don't talk to me, Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me, Now that I'm back on my feet
Don't talk to me, Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me, When you see me in the streets
Don't talk to me, Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me, Act like you don't know me
Don't talk to me, Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me, I don't wanna holla
Verse 1:
You know how it is when you ballin, everybody wanna holla
But the day you fall off, you lose most of your partners
Niggas be acting funny, Hoes, they wanna duck ya
Used to sweat you hard, now they ain't wanna fuck ya
You screening all your calls, don't wanna answer the phone
You ain't working with nothing, they wantcha to leave em alone
You ain't working with nothing, they sayin they ain't home
You sayin to yourself, Boy that ho wrong
I'ma get chu, Wait til I get my shit straight I'mma fix you
I got a 
K beg for ya
, I done bounced back, I'm here to clear my name up
And while I'm doin that, I'm bout to fuck the game up
A year ago, I was fucking my veins up
Now I'm on the grind just getting my change up
The tables done turned, Now everybody wanna talk
If you ain't keep it real, I don't wanna talk
Chorus
Verse 2:
When I was on my ass, Niggas was acting funny
Niggas Shoo-Shooing and look what the dope done him
Niggas done me bad, I couldn't get nothing
Now they see me shining and holla ""What Up Cousin?""
Ain't nothing, better get the fuck on 'fore I sneak ya
Only real niggas can holla at me for a feature
Bitch niggas, I ain't fucking with y'all kind
So don't attempt to holla and waste my time (Nope)
I don't want cha number (Nope), I don't wanna be your friend (Nope)
I don't want your tracks, I fuck with Medicine Men (Yep)
I don't want no crap, Don't you grin in my face
Cause I know its fake, Make me spit in your face
I'm back now, Chopper City's on the move
And I feel like Ludacris, Bitch you better move
Get out the way, While I'm walking through
If you ain't real, I dont wanna talk to you

Ooh they got these niggas
Be getting busted with like five, ten bricks

Be home in about 3 years
You know something ain't right with that

Don't talk to me, Ya done got an early release
Don't talk to me, Don't talk to me

Don't talk to me, Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me, I don't wanna holla
Verse 3:
Man I ain't lying, the game done got flakey
You don't know who is who, the game done got shady
Niggas play hard, get popped and start faking
Get off the deal of rap, They hop up and take it
Look up next week, Ya shops getting raided
Scared to go to the pen, they know they can't make it
Calling me collect, I'm hanging up in they face
Trying to talk in codes, I know 
the call being traced
I ain't the one to play, I know you can't be trusted (No)
Everybody know you got half the city busted (Yeah)
Boy you down bad, you playing the game raw
I thought you was a G, you ain't as real as I thought (Ooh)
You went against the code, You disrespected game
You lost your ghetto pass going against the grain

My Life,Life After Cash Money,2004,"(B.G. Talking)

I was born 1980 September 3rd
Thats the day checks come out and vics gets served
So you know I got the blood of a hustla in my vain
My daddy had 3 brother that all gave me some game
They was raised in the projects I was born in the hood
I was raised on the block my mom did what she could
Always got what I need sometimes I got a lil mo
But I grew up watching g's on the set gettin dough
I made b's n c's up in to 5th grade
It went to d's n f's cuz I didn't want to behave
I was the class clown Christopher raise hell
I show my dick to them hoes and I get expelled
Yeah I get punished I was supposed to be inside
I snuck out the back round the school fo lunch time
The police spotted me id break out and run
Make em run behind me that was my way of having fun
Somewhere in 87 might of been 88
I knew of Baby and Slim we was from round the same way
They moved a lot of weight but I ain't gone tell it all *shhh*
I'm a cut this part short cause my mom's was involved...
(B.G. Talking)

You can put it together it was what it wasn't
Not cakes to be baked, but she had cakes in the oven
She told me if I touch it that id fuck it up
If I knew what I know now i would of took it n cut it up
92 roll round thats when it got real
My daddy got set up kidnapped robbed and killed
Cash Money Records was started that same year
Thats when my thuggin started I was gettin it how I live
My moma needed help I was outta control
The streets took me under I was on a dead end row
The hood barber stand knew Baby and hit him up
Told him I had skills he needed to peep me up
He did that snatch me him Slim and Fresh was feelin me
Took me to studio from that we made history
(B.G. Talking)

In the mid east of that I was doin my thang
And I met this four foot hustla they called him Lil Wayne
That was my lil nigga called my lil brotha
Baby drew a cross between us but I still love him
Universal up to deal we went to get mills
Thats when nigga decided to not keep it real
I had a idea I didn't want to believe it
I wouldn't thought of it in a million years he'll do that to Geezy
I had a dope habit
That monkey was on my back
So he turned his back but look how I shookback
You know how it go you get up when you fall
The streets all over they rooted for the underdog
I got Kizzle I got Snipe I got Gar on my team
And I got click of niggas ready for war on my team
From Detroit to Atlanta Texas and Nashville

I?m the underdawg so they doubt a nigga
But the streets bout a nigga
I?m a uptown big dawg and everone baby left hangin
I?m comin back to getchall
And we gone do it like real niggas do
Not one maybach ten lac's comin through
We all got bitches on 24's spinnin
Thats how it?s goin down when a real nigga get it
Thats why they holdin back and they won't break bread
Cuz they already now how B.Gizzle gone play it
I?m a go in the hood bring em another route

I?m off the block so I?m a hold it down
I?m gonna pump this white I?m gonna bump this brown
I?m gonna get it out the mud I?m gonna stand my ground
Nigga play me once I ain't backin down
Nigga fucked me once think he fuck in me again
I might aswell go to jail and be a punk then
I got connects in Detroit Michigan
You coke price fucked up see yo boy and I?m fixin it

I?m a hustler baby said he fired me
But that wasn't nothin cuz the streets hired me

(man Juve thats my dawg but I ain't rockin like that)

I done had a one on one with Lil Wayne

I done had a one on one with Lil Turk
I told him kick that dope and we can make shit work
I done had a one on one with Juve to
I told him handle his business and holla when he through
Nigga know I?m a hotboy for life
But I ain't goin back ain't no matter the price
I dont need no nigga nigga need me
I?ll jack him for I let him birdfeed me
I?m a fool with that pistol better ask around
If I?m broke I make niggas pay draft Uptown
I had coke make a fiend catch a cab Uptown
I told him on V.L. on the ave Uptown
It's 2004 if you real then you know

We rolling nigga, I'm rolling like this here, Come on

Rollin in my cadillac

Niggas be booting up, Hoes they wanna ride
Only way if thats gonna happen is you jack me off while I drive

Feety gonna hold me down with the tracks you feel and vibe
Yeah I used to get loaded, I got nothing to hide
But look at me now, I'm focused, you can tell I try
You can even tell the way I lean when I drive
It's a new day, new time, I got money on my mind
Best cup your hoe, I take it she fine
You know she fuck, cum one of a kind
I'm a gangsta, I keep it peed on my side
I'm a gangsta, If I see it and want it, I buy it
Cowards be ego-driven, Swallow their pride
Either way it go, I'm do me and get mine, I'ma roll


I got money now, I ain't hurt nigga
You want a verse, I get mad, not work with you
If you got street money, then the price different
You in the major league, you know you gonna taxed quickly
B Gizzle back nigga, the hood still love me
Go to the club, me and my dawgs still pop up late
Go the mall and these hoes still wanna touch me
Can't help it, I'm thuggin, its just the streets love me
It's too late for Baby to try to reach out and touch me
Judge had to make that bust up my fucking money
I was druggin hard, Nigga thought it was funny
Now I think its funny, I just say I did it, done it
Now I'm up and running, Geezy don't forget
Nothing fuckin with Chopper City, this is our year
Dawg we settin rules and we breaking grounds
If you real, then you know how we getting down, Better roll with me


When I was 17, I was considered a grown man
Single mom did that, shit ain't turn out bad
I was 15 in 95, with a '94 Grand AM
Shoulda seen when I got that 19 9 and hit the ave
I was sixteen by the time I was 18
Had a firebird, a lex and some bling bling
Doing my thing, living my dream by 19
Came through, Benz Jeep on dubs with TVs
Niggas hated on me, Hail these nuts wished that I fall
I'm a hell of a hustler, its in my nature to ball
It's a trade I got to get money and stand tall
Niggas who hated yesterday, make 'em hate more tomorrow
Fuck all y'all, I'ma do me, do you
You want beef, fake beef, fake I'ma be true
Every year I'm bustin heads, pullin out something new
Fucking the game up everytime I come through, better roll",https://genius.com/Bg-baby-gangsta-rolling-in-my-cadillac-lyrics

I be doing my thang (doing my thang)
You know that I be doing my thang (doing my thang)
Can't stop B Gizzle
Verse 1:
You know my pimp game tight, mack game official
Streets still the same so I stay packing a pistol
Code never changed, Always keep your heater with you
Never know when a heater in the cut trying to get you
Cruise through the hood on dubs in the winter
Dub deuces in the summer, I'm hellafied nigga
26s on my hummer, get my shine on nigga
I can do it like that cause I get my grind on nigga
And I hustle however I gotta whenever I want
Where ever I'm at, weed, dope, pills, or crack
I be getting connected, making the moves
And plugging my click so let a real G do what he do
Cause I'ma do it if you want me to do it or not
I think its best you let me if you don't wanna get shot
I think its best you respect me if you don't wanna get shot
If you test me, the results is I wet up your block
Chorus x2
Verse 2:
Get in touch with me if you ain't know where the yay at?
Keep 50 bricks laced in the trunk of the maybach
I don't give out my number cause niggas rat, I don't play that
Never give a fed something that have to cause the playback
Have me where all my niggas from back in the day at
On the conspiracy, asking myself why did I say that?
I know better, I can sniff a snitch out
Just as quick as I can bat a bitch and pull my dick out
Just as quick as I can open shop and move a brick out
I change route, I feel that vibe, I'm good at scoping shit out
Good at duct-taping those hoe niggas who open their mouth
Informers informing their people that the cope out the drought
Fuck with a nigga money, that ain't how it go in the south
That how the fuck you get caught up and ain't a way out
I think its best you respect me if you don't wanna get shot
If you test me, the results is I wet up your block
Chorus x2
Verse 3:
Money in the mission I'm on, No lying
I ain't fifty but I'ma get rich or die trying

Gotta hope who'll hit the train drive back or fly
My city on lock when its wet and its dry
Gotta connect like the internet, I stays online
Gotta benz on chromes so wet, stay on shine
My nigga get on your game cause I stays on mine
Nigga who played games, I spray K's and Nine's
It's chopper city and we ready to ride or die
I think its best you respect me if you don't wanna get shot
You test me, the results is I wet up your block

This Lil' B Gizzle, Ya Heard Me
At any given time it could happen
So I'm here, you know I gotta make it happen, Look
Verse 1:
I'm a street nigga, I live my life on the edge
And the last on the streets gotta know how to play
Niggas don't play fair, they be telling the feds
All a nigga business where he drive, where he stay at
Thats fucked up, thats cold, thats sour
Keeping it real is the code I follow
I honor the street code, don't rat, don't snitch
Get popped, be a man and take ya lick
I done backed out, I done gave the game up
The life I was living dawg, I had the change up
Eventually, I would end up banged up, stressed out
Uptown somewhere with my brains bust
I ain't rocking like that, Nigga I'm trying to live
I ain't trying to get killed, Trying to get these mills
Trying to fuck these hoes, do these shows
And cop my whole click benz 5 double 0 (benz 5 double 0)
Chorus x2:
I could be dead tomorrow but I'm alive right now (right now)
I could be loaded tomorrow but I'm not right now (right now)
I was living yesterday but I could die right now (right now)
It's my year and my time so I'm gonna shine right now (right now)
Verse 2:
Nigga thought I was gone and I never stopped druggin
When I first left it alone, nigga thought I was stuntin
Almost a year strong and I ain't done nothin
Still get my grind on cause nigga I love hustlin
Addicted to gettin hoes and gettin this money
Addicted to slangin dick cause Gizzle love fucking
Need to go to rehab cause I love head bustin
But I love the streets, I'm always be thuggin
If you a game stashed nigga, you gotta know how I'm coming
You gotta know if you want drama, nigga then its comin
Cowards hatin on me, even much on my block
They don't want to see they only nigga on top
I won't let they worry me, They know how I'll let Juvi rock
They know if they get out of line, I'ma make it hot
I'ma make it stressful, I'ma make it hard
They can't hang nowhere from the 3rd to the 9th ward (3rd to the 9th ward)

I could be dirty tomorrow but I'm not right now
I could be hurtin tomorrow but I'm shot right now

I keep shows every week cause I'm hot right now
I could get caught tomorrow but I'm out right now
I ain't fucking with nothing, it's a drought right now
I'm up on my game, cause I'm living right now
This all about Geezy and Chopper City right now (right now)

It's Lil B. Gizzle ya heard me
One of New Orleans finest
And if you walk with me for a minute in New Orleans
I'ma show you how we do it

Look, me and my clique all ex-drug addicts
And we got big money spending habits
All got trucks and cars made by caddy
And all got a bad girl that call us daddy
You should see us, the weekend would buy you classic
We on Canel Street holdin' up traffic
Hollerin' at girls white, black, and hispanic
From southern and grambblin'
Tryin to make it happen
We coming through big trucks sound knockin'
Girls in the middle of the street p-poppin'
That's how we do it, where we do it
We don't play with it
You got a K, you play
We got a K we spray with it
That's how we roll deep down in the boot
We quick to shoot, but strictly bout getting loop
Rest in peace to Souja Slim cause he was a fool
Walk with me through New Orleans
And ima show you how we do

Put chrome on everythang we own
Uptown to downtown getting our grind on
Now won't you walk with me, walk the walk with me, walk the walk with me
Walk the walk with me
Come on
Second line, super sundays and DJ's
And even Petey Pablo and before Beyonce now won't you bounce for me, bounce
The bounce for me, bounce the bounce for me, bounce the bounce for me
Come on

All day on Monday it must be on the grind
Cause that night is going down round the bottom line
Tuesday night pop a pill and go catch a screaser
Shoot cross the river
Go holla at Juve at Club Caesar
Wednesday I gotta see the girl shake
You bring it off, they take it off at the Show Case
Thursday night they 50 deep with they crew
Uptown and downtown in the House of Blues
Friday you don't know what to expect
Why Wayne had me bump in that Key West
Saturday don't forget your strap or your vest
Cause anything liable to happen at the Duplex
Sunday morning, on the lake parking lot pimpin'
Sunday night it's going down at three sixty
Rest in peace to Souja Slim cause he was a fool
Walk with me through New Orleans
I'ma show you how we do

Put chrome on everythang we own
Uptown to downtown getting our grind on
Now won't you walk with me, walk the walk with me, walk the walk with me
Walk the walk with me

Second line, super sundays and DJ's
And even Petey Pablo and before Beyonce now won't you bounce for me, bounce
The bounce for me, bounce the bounce for me, bounce the bounce for me
Come on

It ain't no secret New Orleans is full of guerillas
It ain't no secret New Orleans is full of some killas
It ain't no secret Chopper City in the door
It ain't no secret I'm backed up by Cutt Throat
It ain't no secret I ain't a rookie, I'm a pro
It ain't no secret it ain't bout Cash Money no more
If you real than you know from that git go
It's alwayz been Chopper City in the Ghetto
Now VL where you at throw your hands up
Magnolia where you at throw your hands up
Melphamine and Josephine throw your hands up
For C Murder Calio throw your hands up

Stop the violence everybody put your gats up

Walk with me through New Orleans

Shoot to the East Coast, hit up my New York Jet
She take it like a Giant once I get the pussy wet
I double back, you know I got a St. Louis Ram
I'm up there all the time, 'cause she breaking off Pam
Can't forget my Chi-Town Bear
My Detroit Lion a fool, I stays up there
Next order, me, I got a Mississippi Charger
Take a ride all the time, that mountain like water
And I had me an Oakland Raider
She ain't act right, so I had to shake her
And she was screaming

""My neck (My neck)

Now vouch for me, yeah, vouch for me
And after that, put my dick back in your mouth for me
Scream ""Ouch!"" for me, you know my worth
If you can't take dick, don't stand in line first
I need mines with a small waist and nice hips
Independent, good credit that could buy me a whip
I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
And if I go to jail, I'll bet she'll wait for it
She'll have that pussy and shake for it
I'm a dick thrower, and when she back I'll have her screaming

I could hop out on any step in any hood
Niggas know me and will come up and wanna fuck with me bad
A click of niggas with choppers in black with ski masks
I'm a coach so I play the sideline
Let Kizzle go and snipe at these niggas that out of line
I'm a hot boy, people know whats happening with me
Took the chrome of all my whips and put 'em on factory
I could do that, shit real round here
Ask a nigga, all that stuntin get you killed round here
Park the Benz, hop in the crown vict
Behind a little more tenth, think I'm the law, I spin a little bit
I just blend in with the rest of the traffic
You don't know its me thats in the camoflauge caddy
It's 2004, Chopper City in this bitch
Fuckin the game up on some real nigga shit

Earrings worth 10, bitch the whip cost 100
100 in the case, 17 in the Glock
Two million where I stay, 20 bricks on the block

Frame thrower, A Uptown Lane Roaster
A 100% real nigga, look me up and down
Located in Chopper City, G'd Up in Soulja Town

Fuck pushing 10 whips, I spin in the wide track
Bitches still get side-tracked
Ain't got my ass out, ride class course, they pass out
Been tossin brizzles with Gizzle before vehicle
Actually factory got me with a whole faculty
I got dubs but I thug and play hubcaps
They love trap but don't need to tell
And the bullets sell and your body in hell
And shot 'em villians and pulled off alot
In big bodies, no ceilings, three wheelers
Thats how I'm peelin but I'm still the pigeon from runnin straight

Low, Low, 4-Door, Something tinted up on factory
I'm Lo Pro, foul, dicksuckers no longer be harassin me
Niggas actually trippin thinking a nigga
Can't tell the difference between them adapter kits
And the set of sprewells, man they slippin
I'm on factory, with 20 stacks on me
With 40 cal, I ain't worried bout nobody jacking me
But people hacking me, they just be passing me
I just got my package from the west right back to the east

Yeah, You pullin up at the light
Your rims looking good
You got them spinners
But when your hoe asks you to take her out
You can't even afford I-Hop
You pullin up at the club
Jumping out with brand new shirts on
And she say gimme some money
You can't even keep your phone on
Nigga we on factory behind them old 10s
With 20 stacks in our pocket nigga
This Ziggler the Wiggler baby
And we kicking the door open for some real niggas

Post up ciggerette hangin from my lip
Glock in my pocket you see it I extended the clip
No joke-nigga no game
Dogg it's all real with me it's no playin
I walk it how I talk it, I play it how it go
Only three words I tell them people is ""I-Don't-Know""
You say you 'bout this, you say you 'bout that
I heard nigga bust at you and you ain't bust back
You say you so this, you say you so that
I did an investigation nigga you ain't sold jack what's that?


Man I sleep with the tigers, I eat with the bears
However you want it believe that I can take it there
It's real in the field dogg, kill or be killed homes
Pop or get popped up-walk or get walked on
Steal or get stole dogg-pimp or get pimped nigga
Shake or get shook dogg...flip or get flipped nigga
Step or get stepped on pop or get popped up
Watch what you say on the phone will get you locked up
Shoot or get shot dogg, do or get done nigga
If you a man always stand and never run nigga
That's how I play it man Gizzle a G

Same Ol’ Shit,"The Heart of Tha Streetz, Vol. 1",2005,"What's happening (what's happening)
You know it's real in the field (real, really real)
You know it's real in the hood (all the way)
It's just real in the ghetto
From my block to your block (my block to your block)
From my set to your set (my set to your set)
It be the same ol' shit
Nation wide
Look

Everyday seems like the same ol' shit
Eight years waking up to the same ol' bitch
Only thing, hang with the same ol' clique
Chopper City and we bought to train till the end
Slim got killed, you gone see him in the bricks
Nigga gotta jacking leave his brains in a ditch
Every morning dope fiends looking for a fix
They sick, fuck it they'll use they dog fit
Everywhere a nigga breaking the same ol' laws
All ending up behind the same ol' bars
If they third time getting caught for the same charge
It's they second time getting popped by Serge
Me and mah niggas making' the same ol' wish
To be like Pac, and fuck with Smith bitch
Nigga mouth always be the reason the Feds hit
Them soft niggas always be the first ones to snitch

Everywhere a nigga go
They do the same ol' shit
Everybody a nigga know
They do the same ol' shit
Every time I'm holding mah eyes
I see the same ol' shit
What's going to happen when nigga dies
The same ol' shit

Look
The same ol' that
Same ol' this
Everywhere in America, the same ol' shit
Brains get bust
Corpse get left in a ditch
Them laws role up, but nigga don't know shit
Mah neck of the woods, I was taught to never snitch
I swore to the Lord, I'll never stand on a bench
You want that work
I know who got the cheap price
When them killas move they be under the street lights
My lil' dog got shot
I'd been in a tight spots
Situations when I ain't know if I am die or not
So you don't gotta ask me why I act like I act
But if you hating' on me I'd be forced to react
I had shot Glock 9's
Been through hard times
Did enough shit in my life to make the headlines
Niggas mah age in the under ? line dog
Only way you could stop me if you press charges


It's the same ol' shit
Ounces for dro over six
But in the drought bought some 15 grams or 500 tech shit
Make her stack up a zip quick
Hits me with that jack shit
You bought going to war for yours I'm bought the same ol' shit
You takes one of mine we doing' the same ol' shit
Eye for eye and its ride or die and it's as real as its gone get
The dope game and the rap game, it's the same ol' shit
You closest daughter get cut though trying' to hit mah lick
Jail ain't going to stop a nigga from doing the same ol' shit
We get probation, come home and its back to the same shit
Get a strap and I'mma bang it
Get a package and slang it
When it's gone you going to replace it
And do the same ol' shit
No disrespect to the West, but we ain't on that gang shit
It'll be one nigga, one key in broad day to come bang shit
It'll be the same ol' hit
The same nigga that sent
When they try to get you before for killing his brother he ain't forget

Lot of niggas be bitches, talking the same ol' shit
How they reeling' when they going down, brain getting split
Grabbing, crying and dragging it be the same ol' lick
Trying to get lifted for chips, but it'll change so quick
Lot of hoes I be dicking and kicking, it'll be the same ol' shit
They only sucking and fucking me, but they name on the strip
Saying they pregnant after I hit, but the condom getting ripped
Swear to God I'm the father, get it all and get to come harder
When I was born my mother taught me bought the same ol' shit
Don't let know body step on your toes, your ain't know bitch
Hoes getting niggas caught up for the same ol' shit
Thinking what u you think is smarter and you ain't gone slip
Every nigga that's working, doing the same ol' shit
Flying with the same switch ? just in , same ol' bitch
Respect the code till I go, I'mma do the same ol' shit
Smoke weed and get high till I die, and it ain't gone quit


My niggas holla, but it's the same ol' shit
VL look out for me, nigga front me a brick
That's why I'm still riding with the same ol' clip
That's why I never left with the same ol' clique
Mah nigga get outta line, make me hang yo bitch
The only nigga that get ignorant and bring this shit
Since '95 I been rocking like this
Black bandanas, and taking them hits
Dog get at me still the same ol' nigga
My rap sheets, they just got a lil' bigger
An NOPD still harassing a nigga
And them Haitians still taxing a nigga
Them Chopper City Boyz running this year
Which one of you clowns would come in this hear
Every time I look around it's the same ol' Vic
Ain't nothing change in the hood, it's the same ol' shit",https://genius.com/Bg-baby-gangsta-same-ol-shit-lyrics

WHERE DEY AT? Gettin 2-way; WHERE DEY AT? In the who-ay
WHERE DEY AT? Talkin bad but it's still all goo-ey

Man I'm rollin with the gangsters, kick it with the G's
Hustle with the hustlers I'm ""The Heart of the Streetz""
Grind with the ballers, ball with the grinders
Keep it real with my clique so my whole team shiners
Ride with the riders, swim with the sharks
If I get caught I got nuttin to say to the law
I'm built to last, ever since them niggas killed my dad
Crackin a pen and pad is all I had
It's get it how you live with me
Busters don't know how to deal with me; it's all real with me
All the street niggas scared of me
All the hot girls love me they say ""Boy put that drill in me""
I come through, limo tint on the truck
I got a whole block spooked when I ride slow, puttin it up
Got straight, Seagram's gin in my cup
I ain't gon' do ya nuttin scary-ass nigga, what'cha heart beatin for?
What's your heart beatin for? (You SCARRRRRED)

I'm in the club, post up, way in the back
Got a bottle of gin and I snuck in with the mac
Got my fresh bows on, breeze on my feet
Hoes love when I'm thuggin in my fresh white tee
I'm 'bout whatever; Gizzle is a G
We could do it however, it don't matter to me
We can do it right here, we can take it outside
I'm young, but believe, I been 'bout mine
I just ride when it's time to ride
I grind when it's time to grind; slangin hot when it's time to bust
Slangin dick when it's time to fuck
I'm a Chopper City nigga, don't try your luck
You want beef? I ain't scared, nigga I'm everywhere

Niggas caught in the zone, they better watch it when I'm cockin my chrome
Cause at clubs, yeah I slip one in your dome, you better leave me alone
I ain't no bitch, I don't talk shit on the phone
I got somethin that just might follow you home, now ain't I dead-ass wrong
How could you react, if your brains are blown
I guess that fat bitch is singin her song; that bitch is singin her song
You busted wide, little boys ain't grown
Your mouth is heavy but your back ain't strong, and once again it's on
You must be smokin on that Cheech & Chong
Think you can handle with somethin this wrong; with somethin this wrong
Just write it in blood, or carve it in stone
Otherwise you don't want no problems with homes; don't want no problems with homes
You can't get rid of me, not even penitentiary
A friend of me, you need to be, I'm hotter than humidity
Without a mask, jack a nigga for his cash

U See Why,"The Heart of Tha Streetz, Vol. 1",2005,"Yeah...  See
Ya Know Chopper City got all they reasons
You know what I'm saying for doing the things they do
Know what I'm saying and Imma tell you like this here
If you ain't real know what I'm saying we really ain't
Got nothing in common know what I'm saying so its like this:

U see why I'm on the Block
U see why I gotta hustle
U see why I keeps my pistol
And keeps it real to the gristol
U see why I gets my paper
U see why I ain't got time for haters
U see why I do what I do and only fuck wit a few
Look...
I'ma hustla, all I can thank about is cheese
All I can thank about is getting g's mo g's mo g's
It looks like hatin' a disease
Cause tha mo money I get
The mo they they hatin' on me
So I peep thru muddy water
Spot dry land
Smiling all in my face
But bitch nigga you ain't my man
I understand why
God sent me on this ride
Cause he know that I'm a soilder
That can survive thru hard times
Man I keep it real
I just play the cards that I'm dealt
Most of time you see me I'm by myself
Cause niggas hate
They smile in ya face
They'll stab you in your back
Chopper City niggas
We don't be rockin' like that
If I'm wit ya I'm wit ya
If I'm against you I flip ya
If I get popped I don't snitch
I just take my hit
Imma Gangsta
The G-Code I was born wit it
And Imma ride wit it
You better believe
Until I die wit it

Look...
It Hard
Sometimes I get down on my knee
And ask tha Lord
Why I'm still living
And not did up behind bars
He tell me just chill
I got some in store for you
All the things I gave Cash Money
I got even more for you
That gets me excited
And calm my nerve down alot
I be wanting to go off
And murk some on the block
Then a picture of my so
Poof flash in front my eyes
Then reality kick in
Now who gone take care mine
I don't want him to lose daddy
Like I lose mine
Lose mine when I was 12
And I've been trouble every since
I've been thuggin' every since
I've been hustlin' every since
I've been touting big pistols
And headbussin' every since
Carry my back on
Hand me my other half
And us three together
Handle business affairs
I'm over due to get these meals huh
It's life with Chopper City
So you know that shit is real
Huh come on

I'ma gangsta
But I know long as God in my life
And I choose to put him first
Everything a be alright
So I keep my head up
Continue to pay my dues
Continue to keep it real
And just refuse to lose
I straight
Lead my click in the right direction
Keep 'em on point and focus
And let 'em know sky's the limit
Chase that money
Get that money
Stack that money
Then you good
Don't never get big headed
And turn your back on your hood
Imma man
My word is my bond
Even if I'm mad at you
I'll never let money and fame
Change my charactar
My daddy named me Christopher
The hood named me Gizzle

Always told me keep it real to the gristle",https://genius.com/Bg-baby-gangsta-u-see-why-lyrics

3 time loser but I still ride with it, ya heard me?

Well it's Geezy, the hottest of the hot
You can catch me posted in the middle of the block
Suited and booted, I'm bout it, ain't gotta prove it
I see it then I'ma do it, I up it then I'ma use it
And it's like that, don't think you gon' steal
A nigga off my team and my team ain't gon' strike back
We'll be right back, fuck you done it nigga
We treat beef like coke, we 2-for-1 a nigga
Them soldiers coming nigga, you hear 'em stumpin nigga
Your clips loaded about 100, it ain't no runnin nigga
You gon' get punished nigga, and your partners too
You in beef, so that mean they got it too
Now is they nuttin up, or they skettin out
You gon' see when that pressure come, they gon' rat you out
And once we find out, where ya layin at
That's when we come in 50 deep and scram that

I keep peeps that will always, ride with me
I got beef so I always, ride with that
When I creep I always, ride with that
When we meet then ya know I'ma be, poppin that

You know I sleep and I eat it
I'm in the streets it ain't easy
All year round, where I'm from it's murder season
I keep mine close, always in grabbing reach
I heard they got a few niggas talkin bout snatchin me, nabbin me
I ain't going for that, come with it, come get it
Last nigga tried, you know how it ended
Wig splitted, dun-diggidy, I'm bout this, I bang back
You ain't gotta wonder where them things at, they right here
I walk with em, ride with em, sleep with 'em
Fuck with me, I'ma show you I'm a fool when I creep with 'em
I'ma beast with em, Gizzle don't play, I'm a dog
AK's, Mack 11's, Tech 9's, got 'em all
Put your face on the wall, I'm lookin at that
Sayin how ya gon' let a nigga hit me from the back
You gotta think in the streets, don't trust nobody
If you ever caught hustlin, don't bust nobody


Don't start no shit, won't be no shit
When death come close your eyes, you won't see that shit
Fuckin with Choppa City, nigga it's gon' be that shit
We bout that trigger play, partner you could leave that shit
I'm a uptown nigga, I'ma be that there
Bitch made type nigga, can't be that there
When there's money coming in, I'ma be right there
C-Vannis, Magnolia, I'ma be right there
With the 40 on my hip, the chopper 'cross the street
The sniper on the roof, keepin a eye on me
I'm a product of the street, I get it how I live
It is what it is so I get it how I live
I'm bout that guerilla warfare, I cock the nine back
I told her ? round, I'm bout the dime bags

Any nigga wanna bring it to me - I'm a bring it back
They want be able to make no money where they slang that
'cause everyday I'm a be spendin where they hangin at
That AK 47 never stop when I'm bangin that
Oh yeah it's real homey, I don't be stuntin partna
Be on ya P's and Q's first time you slip I got ya
Put it on everything I'm a break you off proper
That's how we roll in the N.O. this the city of choppers
It ain't nothin to me beef is all that I know
Snatch niggas holdin onto they folks out they door

But most important I ain't no bitch...

Get Yo Mind Right,"The Heart of Tha Streetz, Vol. 2 (I Am What I Am)",2006,"(*talking*)
What's happ'ning, you see
There's a certain way, us hot boys want you hot girls to be
And it's a certain way, you hot girls want us too

I need a real man, someone to hold me
Give me his heart, and everything that I need
Buy me some Prada, Fendi or a Canary
Yeah baby, that's how I like my man to treat me
(now get your mind right, girl get yout mind right
I ain't none of them other dudes, get your mind right
Now get your mind right, girl get your mind right
Someone to put it in your life, get your mind right)

I want a hot girl, who know how to treat a nigga
If I go broke, she solid and won't leave a nigga
She keep it thorough, and ain't always in the streets
She know how to treat that meat, up in between the sheets
She hold me down, whether wrong or right
I ain't even gotta speak, she know just what daddy like
I know just what mami like, I know just what mami need
So she won't go nowhere else, I fuck her four times a week
I got her some bling-bling, nice whip nice pad
To show her I love her, when she trip I whoop's her ass
I'm a man you a woman baby, I'm running the show
You don't like it that's your issue, there go the do' you could go
I'm a soldier, I don't fuck with saditty bitches
I need a soldierette, I don't fuck with them silly bitches
Don't get me wrong, cause I like a good girl
But she gotta be half good, and half hood girl


If you need it you could get it, if you want it girl I got it
Ask somebody I'm the realest, you ain't know Gizzle the hottest
Let me see you work your body girl, drop it like it's hot
I know your pressure point, it won't be hard to find your spot
You start off at the bottom, then I'll let you get on top
Don't slow it down, cause I'm starting to like it a lot
I'm a fool, when it come to the streets
I heard about you baby girl, you a freak
Go 'head do what you do, put your mouth on the meat
If you don't catch it, I'mma warn you 'fore I'm fitting to skeet
I ain't gon do you that, it's all good I'm king of the hood
And hot girls call me, Dr. Good-Joog
All you gotta do is push, I got a nice stroke
If you don't believe, ask your girl she know
I'm a pro I'm a beast, I'm a dog I'm the shit
Hope you got good pussy, cause I got good dick

You gotta stay on top of it, you gotta stay on the grind
You can't let them hoes get in ya way (never ever, ever, ever...)
You know I mean you can play with 'em but to a certain extent

What I Need in my life seems so hard to find (so hard - so hard - so hard)
Gotta get up on my grind 'cause I'm runnin out of time (it's like I'm runnin out of time)
Well my momma always told me only the strong survive (only the strong survive)
And all the pain in my eyes, gotta make it out alive

Look I'm hard as they come and niggas know that
And if I fuck with a hoe and leave I can't go back
I'm too true to the game dogg I can't slip
My baby momma the only one got me pussy whipped
I got two's, and threes and they know how it go
Respect it or check it or they gotta hit the road
I chase money like niggas chase ass in the Pen
And I need a few mills before the years end
I pop my collar in the club, get my drank on
And in the winter man I gotta put the mink on
I'm a pimp I got my picks and chooses with 'em
I got too many already I don't know what to do with 'em
But I'm a keep my head up like a big dogg
Get this money, fuck these hoes and say fuck all y'all
I gotta heart I'm a man I can get serious
But I'm chasin money right now man I gotta get it


Niggas thought I was threw from that other click
Look how far I done came with this Chopper City shit
I gotta hold this shit down can't give it up
Slim will turn in his grave if I don't live it up
I put God first, family second, and money third
So my fourth option gotta be gettin off these birds
My momma give me all she could, I don't know
How the streets just came and grabbed me by the throat
But I'm in them now and I ain't turnin back
And I ain't turnin no corners without it on my lap
Nigga I'm in the trap you can ask anybody
You want beef I ain't trippin you can see me about it
I'm bout whatever partna believe what I say
If I get uncomfortable I'm a unload the K
My plans and dreams get bigga everyday
So every night I gotta get on my knees and pray",https://genius.com/Bg-baby-gangsta-what-i-need-lyrics

The camoflauge truck it's representin solider


Move out the way baby boy here I come
I'm the topical discussion like that boy Vince Young
I'm on the boulevard holdin'workin wood grain wheel
Top down, sun shinin on my ice tray grill
The car fresh out the wash no soap, just water
Turnin everybodies head with my remote control starter
I'm a head turner flippin in my old school dropper
Tippin down on 8 - 4's look, oh so proper
I'm flossin with my partner Memphis in that black on black
Wavin trunk down West Park to make the boppers attract
Them hoes don't know how to act - I'm hoggin lane in the Lac
And I'm a keep on ridin swangers till them hoes start to clack...baby


If you can get it, I got it...if you have it, I had it
From the Lex, to the Benz, from Denali, to Caddi
Ridin'fly no doubt twenty - fo's and up
I'm ridin slow cause purple kool aid in my cup
I'm a down south boy you know we shine
You workin with somethin you hear them hoes holla(waaahhh)
My pockets on swoll, my whip on beam
I started that shit so you know my wrist bling

Got diamonds from the bottom - to the top of my grill

Stop lyin', I'm a G you been heard about
Stop reppin', you a pussy, I been heard of you
You playin' with a gangsta, homie the nerve of you

You got a lot of nerve, they talkin' a lot. I heard
Only round your homies, when I'm round you know, not a word
I'm a heathen who fight for what he believe in
And I don't have no plans on leavin' 'til I get even
Salt and pepper, nigga I'm seasoned for any reason
The day you want somethin' with Juve, come on and see him
My G ain't gon' allow me to lose
I'm bustin' shots as soon as you make a move, ooh
I'm not a fan of fools, that's why I got attitude
Runnin' your mouth to me, I'ma try to get at a dude
Don't even have a tool, what is you tryna prove?
Gon' head and choose, ya die 'cause I'ma shoot

Anything I will commit it, just to show that I'm committed
Commit it then get acquitted, ay Gizzle let me get 'em
Gizzle let me get 'em, eat em up and shit 'em
And ain't no explanation for this damn insanity
I'm a monster like I'm part of the Addams Family
And some say I am old, but I'm new to a few
And I'm blessed achoo
I came to get me and I got you and I'm so me and I'm not you
And even if you get married, you couldn't do what I do
Now let me get high off my drug scandals
Life's a gamble

It feels good, I still get love in my hood
Haters still wishing they could
But they can't because
I'm still getting it, getting it, get getting it, getting it man

B.G. still the same old same old
Nothing change, play the game how the game go
Pants sag, white tee, and a Kangol
I ain't got to hustle, but I still hang low
A few hate, that's what I ride with that thing for
It's going down if they run up on that Range Rove
It's going down if they test a nigga man hood
Every ghetto in New Orleans I done ran through it
I done seen a lot, and I done, done a lot
When I was young I had dreams I run the block
When I was young yeah my momma used to fuss a lot
But now she proud because her son is living on the top


It feels good to be fortunate and give back
See the old lady walking, stop, and help her with her bags
Forget where I come from? Dog, never that
Every time I leave they asking me ""When you coming back?""
I say fuck it and I let the whole hood come
And now I got the whole hood on my tour bus
Uptown represent it till the end of time
Uptown, I done lost a lot a friends of mine
I'm on the grind so you know I'm out here getting mine
Like Curtis I'ma get rich or die trying
I fell a few times, I never gave up
Got up, got a pack, hit the hood, made up


You know me, I be everywhere the thugs be
Convicted felon, but be everywhere the guns be
I'm a gangster, the whole hood love me
You's a buster, I know you wish you was me
Man this life that I'm living dog is lovely
I'm like him, but you know you can't touch me
I appreciate what the hood done me
It made me a man, made me a O.G
It made me a man, made me a go getter
It showed me how to never be a broke nigga
I'll never be a quitter, always be a winner
I'm in the hood growing like a rainbow nigga

Feels good to be a gangster

I said damn it feels good to be a gangster

Tho mo' money for guns, the mo' homicide
The mo' pussies that run, the mo' I'mma ride
Cause since Poppa died, I was starin' eye to eye
With them gangstas, those niggas you idolize
I was young & blind cutting class wastin' time
Til' my nigga introduced me to that other side
He said listen you plan out what you wanna do
You out thinkin' you grown you got a lot to prove
Ain't nuttin' free in this world
You gotta take it fool, you wanna roll
Good here's a 22
You see them niggas right there
Shoot them
And ever since that day, I've been a shooter


Oh, I'm a baby gangsta, you name it I done it
You heard the hook nigga, I'm the definition of it
I came my own way, been wildin' since 13
Soon niggas get in line if you wanna mirk me
Let's take it to the streets
Where I started it
Where half the city wanted for murder charges there
I'm dressed in all black
Baseball hat
Gorilla Suit nigga that's what I call that
I never been a rat
And I don't fuck with the lame
I took lost bounce bitch and charged it to the game
Always been the same
I ain't never gon' change
When I'm in beef you know I gotta let my nuts hang
I come from down south, on them back streets
I bet you I'll wack a nigga before you wack me
Nigga go get  yeh fuck with me
You know a gangsta and a hustlah is all I'll ever be


Look I got killers around me
Drug dealers around me
Real talk don't bring no bird niggas around me
I get bullet proof love if thugs fuck with me
I act up because the goons run with me
A nigga play he gon' it cause I'mma headshot him
They say I move like Tut before the Feds got him
I'm a gang leader, in a white wife beater
Tattered black flagged up In a two seater
Bitches notice me by the scar, know its me
The four fifth in my coatsleeve, coatsleeve
I've been to jail before
That's what hell is dog
My niggas back and forth like it's a damn resort
This is for my niggas that grind and have pistols on them
Don't play with police we draw pistols on them
The game really fucked up
When they let crooks in

A straight Chattanooga nigga, that's what's up with me

The underdog biting nigga just to get attention
Maal The Pimp, that's a know you better start to mention (Why?)
I got some stories to tell, I'm gon' be here a minute
Come to my city, it's hell and you see how I'm living
Murder, dope, robbery, look it ain't all good
And niggas with that gang banging shit in all hoods
Yeah I was raised around it, guess that's my background
I speak the real so they respect me down in Chat-town
Back in my younger days, nigga I used to flag it up
Break it down on a styrofoam plate and bag it up
I go to any side of town, I can move like that
These niggas know what hood I'm from but I'm just cool like that
Man for the record it's official homie, you know me
I'm trying to put us on the map down in the 423
So how B.G. hear about Maal? (How?) I ain't got no deal
I ain't sold 100,000 so I must be real
The more I fuck with Chopper City, watch them checks get bigger
Big  yeah I got ya, that's on the west side nigga


I got a blunt full of weed and a trunk full of keys
Tell me how many you want, I can get you what you need

Hundred carrots on the arm, hundred carots on the charm

Bling Bling (Radio Version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Man I got these broads iceing it up
While my lil B.G.s on the bus puttin' out cigarette butts
But me personally playboy I done had bad luck
And I'm a always show love to my cut
Hit tha club light tha lights up
The Cash Money motto is to drank 'til you throw up
Point the broad out guaranteed I can pluck
Cause Wodie I'm tattooed and barred up
Medallion iced up
Rolex bezelled up
And my pinky ring is platinum plus
Earrings be trillion cut
And my grill be slugged up
My heart filled with anger lost, stranded as a youngster
Stack my chesse up
Cuz oneday I'm a give this street life up
Beef I don't discuss
Wodie outta line wodie gone get his head bust
Cash Money millionaires plus
Don't touch broad if you can't pluck the broad
Twenty inches with t.v.'s is a must
By the year two thousand Lil' Wayne gone tear this game up

Boss B, slow down in the Jag you lost me
You know how slow the new Rolls Royce be
The number one rapper, dippin low low
In a compressor sippin mo-mo
Spend a lotta cheddar, look
My click couldn't be betta
I'm married to C.M.R. baby
Love it or leave it
Drop tops when it's hot
Strech hummer's when it's not
Light up the whole block when
You glance at my watch
It's Wayne baby, thugged out won't change baby
I'll do your main lady, in a blue navigaty
That's game baby, you can call me a game shooter
But since I drive a bubble people call me Lex Luger
I pull up in a expedition they be like ah no,no,no he didn't
Tattoes and fast cars, Do you know who we are?
I'm Lil' Weezy puttin down for C.M.R

Bling bling
Everytime I come around yo city
Bling bling
Pinky ring worth about fifty
Bling bling
Everytime I buy a new ride
Bling bling
Lorenzos on Yokahama tires
Bling bling

It's the playa with tha Lex bubble
Candy coated helicopter with tha leather cover
If ya slirppin' not  take off the rubber
Then toss that broad cuz I don't love her
Balla, Manny bought a private plane
Then turned around and sold that thang to Juve and Wayne
They put 30 inch lorenzos on that thang man
You lil kids out there just don't understand

I'm a 1999 driver
I'm a uptown third ward Magnolia T.C. rider
Ole ignorant boy always stun'n
Big ballin' cahouney's you can see him when he comin'
Booted up Diamond up Golds be shinnin' up
All them diamonds be blindin' up
People at the second line be sayin' I be damn
Up in they best fits sayin' Juve got me damn


I be that playa with the ice on me
If it cost less than twenty it don't look right on me
I stay flossed out all through the week
My money long if you don't know I'm the B.G
I be dealin with your girl all in your home
Haters be like look at that benz on all that crome
Diamonds worn by everybody thats in my click
Man I got the price of a mansion 'round my neck and wrist
My Dawg Baby gettin' a special built machine
A mercedes benz seven hundred B 14
I know you haters can't believe that
I can't wait to see ya bustas face when ya see that

Baby Gangsta motherfucker -- fake nigga head bussa

Keep my finger on the trigga.. gotta think on the next nigga

Raised up thugged out, keep the fuckin gauge out
Ho shit done played out ya whole posse laid out
Birds and money that's all that excite me
Fuck bitches I'm bout money that's all that entice me
President lover, undercover, ain't another like me
You get a ki half price from Columbia fuckin with B
Believe it's just in me to be a real soldier
Gats I load, slip you dont value what's on ya shoulder
Now I done told ya -- the streets is real all the time
Gotta survive the game nigga I'mma die for mine
I ain't lyin.. I do what the fuck I gotta do
Shoot who I gotta shoot if ya outside my crew
Numbers 2-2-6, lotta buster playa hate it
Takin off like Delta cause Manny Fresh can't be faded
I'm a young nigga.. hard nigga.. street nigga
Tryna get on my feet I creep you sleep six feet deep

If I profit or not, as long as ya loaded then fuck it
Yo head is a banana, squeal and get peeled

Fuck all that assholin nigga lets beef
Remember I'm the one that said 'take it to the streets'
Twerk somthin, handle up nigga, shake somthin
Got a K with a drum -- and I'm ready to spray somthin
Lay it down.. make the wrong move.. checkmate
Think again.. you sendin peace messages, it's too late
Tryin to recuperate.. after we left ya in the dust
Big Boy can't fuck with us retaliation is a must
Baby Gangsta, grim reaper, death bringer
Assault rifle banger.. got a itchy trigger finger
I let em hang-a....what you niggas say you gon do me,do it man
Underestimate in this war you gon lose it man
Got a AR... 15 I mean

It's a bust-back thang nigga grab yo shit
I come behind limo tint with the optimo lit
Bust open the 911, let me take my hit
Y'all done started, you can't quit

Lights out like the eclipse, rookies tryin to battle us
Cockin and be bout poppin nigga its time to hanlde up
(Chorus)x2
(Verse 3)
All these.. jive niggas wan rep on me
Knowin they ain't bout to step cross Martin Luther King
All these other initials besides U.P.T, and H.B. --
Don't mean nothin to the B.G
I'm ready to get down and dirty bout my place in this biz
Let a nigga take me down after all this time? Shiiiit

"Jack Who, Take What",UnKnown,UnKnown,"(whoa, shit ain't gon' happ')
Look, I just come from outta town, nigga broke in my crib
Disrespect where I live, 20 g's up for who he is
He don't have the slightest mothafuckin' idea - who he dealin with
Ahh he don't know how real it get
He gonna get his wig split, looked over the bricks - got nothing
But I don't play nigga, try'na take mine from him
For him ta know I was gone - know I wasn't home
Somebody had ta be inorder that I know
Time ta go in the closet, with a ride or die fit
Black hood - Girbauds - ski mask and Reebok classics
It's spreading 'bout them 20's - somebody gonna talk
Give it 3 or 4 days for it ta come out the dark
Hoe what I told ya, niggas can't pull me ta the side
He ain't lying - I had the vibe, it was a pro-blem of mine
But for me, he showed, wasn't no love in him
So I ain't hesistate ta put them fuckin' slugs in him
(Hook 4x - )
Jack who, Take what, from who, not me
Slip and think you can sleep - after fuckin' with B.G

(Look, Look, Look)
Nigga know I got that work - so he plottin' and watchin'
Try'na see when I'm gone - so he can break in my house and
I'ma bake a cake for him, make him think I'm outta town
I know he here hustlin' I'm on my monkey talkin' loud
Tellin' my round not be there pick me up from the 'port
On my way ta Nashville, 10 bricks I'm gonna score
Prolly get a lil' dope, cuz that dope make more money
20 dollars for a bag, Half-a-gram for a 100
This nigga just don't know, I'm on top of my game
Shoulda kept it too himself but instead he told Elan
Better get that nigga Turk, so I got ta bust his brains
If I let that nigga slide, he gonna try ta do it again
Gatta handle mine, gatta get rid of him quik
Bust him up fast, throw him in the lake then split
Jack who, take what, from who, not me
Get a bullet in ya head leave that ass on the street
(Hook 4x - )
Jack who, Take what, from who, not me
Slip and think you can sleep - after fuckin' with Teke

(aight)
Okay let me explain, been sittin' on 5 bricks of cocaine
Since the drought came
Niggas be constantly blowing me up try'na cop thangs
But the prices remain 10
I don't change it or curve it - I just slang it and serve it
You see the game is got these niggas hurtin'
The money's nervous, so they try'na get at me for service - Let's make it happen
I'm only askin' for dime a ki' - 5 for half
Quarters go 3 - you do the rest of the math
And nigga offer me 55 so I figure he ballin'
But at my prices the average hustler with dough can afford
But I'ont know this ol' nigga so I'ma tax him 60 g. bandits
The extra 5 for shippin'-n-handlin'
When I met him, he in all black, talking 'bout he be back
Told me ta stay here while he get the stacks
Fuck is you ignorant
I cocked the Mag back quik, and knocked off his ligaments
Jack Wayne, not player thats ridiculous
(Hook 4x - )
Jack who, Take what, from who, not me
Slip and think you can sleep - after fuckin' with Weezy

I told Ris, when my life at night with this dope
I had a bitch, I kinda like ta bite
The bitch broke with my shit
Oh yeah - I'ma found out where she at
She ain't selling none of that, look I need ta get that back
I'ma pay my people, what I owe them, Cuz I know them
And shit a get real fast,and I might have ta show them
I ain't gon' let the bitch walk, like everthing is super either
She done change the i-den-tity and acting as two people
A smart bitch, but fucked up in the game
Cuz I found out her source, ta get enough of the same
Quickly, got the location and bust up his brains
Click on the 5 o'clock news, they ain't mention his name
Gatta, clear head - this for the time being
Cuz these bitches right around me
Be the ones that mind's sceaming
I sell brown ta you's frown nigga
Fuck how you feel - ain't no rules now nigga

Roll with Me by B.G.,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Oh yeah, Oh yeah
Oh yeah
See real niggas I can fuck with them, ya heard me? Bitch niggas I can't fuck with them Hoe niggas, niggas who do all that talkin' I can't fuck with them I ain't lying man them niggas be, ohh they put salt in the game, you heard me I swear to Jesus, Lord forgive me for swearing but look, look...

I'm 'bout whatever I'm always ready to flip a nigga
When I'm in beef never hesitate to get a nigga
'95 was when I first attempted to kill a nigga
So much happened since then I can't even remember nigga
I'm off the block when at anytime it can happen
Come off in the street if you think that I'm just rappin'
And I guarantee when you leave it won't be in an ambulance, I guarantee you'll leave zipped up in a body bag
I fuck with niggas on parole and probation
I fuck with niggas that appealed and still waitin'
The game hurtin' I swear that the streets need y'all
When I get right I'ma do what I can to reach y'all
I ain't gone lie these new niggas fuckin' the game up
They get popped, and wanna bring a nigga name up
I can't rock like that, oh no, I hit these (??) eaters they can't keep they mouth closed

Now if you 'bout your business
(you can roll with me)
If you done been convicted
(you can roll with me)
If you 'bout them bitches
(you can roll with me)
If you bust back when niggas is spittin'
(you can roll with me, roll with me)

I surround myself with nothin' other than real niggas
If they beefin', you best believe they gone kill niggas
Fuck them people, code on the streets is ""never squeal nigga""
I don't care if you got life and they up a deal nigga
I'ma take my lick like a man, I was taught that
I can't violate the street code, that's where my hearts at
So when they question me, there's nothin' they'll find out
I go head an cop out, so I can ride out
Get in there, post up, and hold it down like a G
Click-Clack with deputy's having 'em meeting my auntie
Bringin me grams of dro, and ounces of sticky green
A hustler gone hustle behind bars, like on the street
That's how its been with me, and that's how its gone be
That's why real niggas fuck with me, that's cause they feel me
And if you feel me, ain't got no hoe in ya
You got some gangsta in your blood, nigga I can roll with ya


Half of my click been all charged with homicide
More than half done all been part of a drive by
The rest of 'em is tweakin' unless some shots fly
And I also keep a 10-piece hot girl by my side
I call her Bonnie and she be callin' me Mr. Clyde
She'll take my charge she know I'm on paper for 5
So if I go back again then that's a wrap homie
And promise you that's somethin' she ain't gone have homie
I'm too important right now to be state property
That's why I chill I ain't no duck, I know they watchin' me
But they can watch me all they want, they wasting pictures on me
I been cut them niggas loose that I thought was snitchin' on me
Fuck around and tell my P.O. he got a brick on 'em
And then I'll turn around on an have to put a hit on 'em
That's the type who don't respect who code, nigga
Under pressure they fold, so I can't roll with ya!

Same Ol’ S*%#,UnKnown,UnKnown,"What's happening (what's happening)
You know it's real in the field (real, really real)
You know it's real in the hood (all the way)
It's just real in the ghetto
From my block to your block (my block to your block)
From my set to your set (my set to your set)
It be the same ol' shit
Nation wide
Look

Everyday seems like the same ol' shit
Eight years waking up to the same ol' bitch
Only thing, hang with the same ol' clique
Chopper City and we bought to train till the end
Slim got killed, you gone see him in the bricks
Nigga gotta jacking leave his brains in a ditch
Every morning dope fiends looking for a fix
They sick, fuck it they'll use they dog fit
Everywhere a nigga breaking the same ol' laws
All ending up behind the same ol' bars
If they third time getting caught for the same charge
It's they second time getting popped by Serge
Me and mah niggas making' the same ol' wish
To be like Pac, and fuck with Smith bitch
Nigga mouth always be the reason the Feds hit
Them soft niggas always be the first ones to snitch

Everywhere a nigga go
They do the same ol' shit
Everybody a nigga know
They do the same ol' shit
Every time I'm holding mah eyes
I see the same ol' shit
What's going to happen when nigga dies
The same ol' shit

Look
The same ol' that
Same ol' this
Everywhere in America, the same ol' shit
Brains get bust
Corpse get left in a ditch
Them laws role up, but nigga don't know shit
Mah neck of the woods, I was taught to never snitch
I swore to the Lord, I'll never stand on a bench
You want that work
I know who got the cheap price
When them killas move they be under the street lights
My lil' dog got shot
I'd been in a tight spots
Situations when I ain't know if I am die or not
So you don't gotta ask me why I act like I act
But if you hating' on me I'd be forced to react
I had shot Glock 9's
Been through hard times
Did enough shit in my life to make the headlines
Niggas mah age in the under ? line dog
Only way you could stop me if you press charges

It's the same ol' shit
Ounces for dro over six
But in the drought bought some 15 grams or 500 tech shit
Make her stack up a zip quick
Hits me with that jack shit
You bought going to war for yours I'm bought the same ol' shit
You takes one of mine we doing' the same ol' shit
Eye for eye and its ride or die and it's as real as its gone get
The dope game and the rap game, it's the same ol' shit
You closest daughter get cut though trying' to hit mah lick
Jail ain't going to stop a nigga from doing the same ol' shit
We get probation, come home and its back to the same shit
Get a strap and I'ma bang it
Get a package and slang it
When it's gone you going to replace it
And do the same ol' shit
No disrespect to the West, but we ain't on that gang shit
It'll be one nigga, one key in broad day to come bang shit
It'll be the same ol' hit
The same nigga that sent
When they try to get you before for killing his brother he ain't forget

Lot of niggas be bitches, talking the same ol' shit
How they reeling' when they going down, brain getting split
Grabbing, crying and dragging it be the same ol' lick
Trying to get lifted for chips, but it'll change so quick
Lot of hoes I be dicking and kicking, it'll be the same ol' shit
They only sucking and fucking me, but they name on the strip
Saying they pregnant after I hit, but the condom getting ripped
Swear to God I'm the father, get it all and get to come harder
When I was born my mother taught me bought the same ol' shit
Don't let know body step on your toes, your ain't know bitch
Hoes getting niggas caught up for the same ol' shit
Thinking what u you think is smarter and you ain't gone slip
Every nigga that's working, doing the same ol' shit
Flying with the same switch ? just in , same ol' bitch
Respect the code till I go, I'ma do the same ol' shit
Smoke weed and get high till I die, and it ain't gone quit

My niggas holla, but it's the same ol' shit
VL look out for me, nigga front me a brick
That's why I'm still riding with the same ol' clip
That's why I never left with the same ol' clique
Mah nigga get outta line, make me hang yo bitch
The only nigga that get ignorant and bring this shit
Since '95 I been rocking like this
Black bandanas, and taking them hits
Dog get at me still the same ol' nigga
My rap sheets, they just got a lil' bigger
An NOPD still harassing a nigga
And them Haitians still taxing a nigga
Them Chopper City Boyz running this year
Which one of you clowns would come in this hear
Every time I look around it's the same ol' Vic
Ain't nothing change in the hood, it's the same ol' shit",https://genius.com/Bg-baby-gangsta-same-ol-s-lyrics
Geezy Where You Been,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Ziggler the Wiggler talking with B.G.)

I been on the road movin coke and slangin raps
Traveling putting Chopper City on the map
I know I'm a get it with other niggas
I'm the underdawg so they doubt a nigga
But the streets bout a nigga
I'm a uptown big dawg and everone baby left hangin
I'm comin back to getchall
And we gone do it like real niggas do
Not one maybach ten lac's comin through
We all got bitches on 24's spinnin
Thats how it's goin down when a real nigga get it
Thats why they holdin back and they won't break bread
Cuz they already now how B.Gizzle gone play it
I'm a go in the hood bring em another route
All my niggas with bonds I'm a get em out
All my niggas with monkeys I help get em off they back
I done got ride of mine so we rockin like that nigga
 + (B.G.)
Geezy where you been man Geezy where you been
(man I been tryna make a dollar out off 15 cents)
I heard Juve went back now is you goin back
(you know Juve thats my dawg but I ain't rockin like that)
Geezy where you been man Geezy where you been
(man I been tryna make a dollar out off 15 cents)
Say Juve went back now is you goin back
(man Juve thats my dawg but I ain't rockin like that)

Man I know people who know people
That give me work on the strength
I dont even have to owe people
I know arabs that know arabs
They get work from overseas
I bring it on V.L. and on the ave
I'm off the block so I'm a hold it down
I'm gonna pump this white I'm gonna bump this brown
I'm gonna get it out the mud I'm gonna stand my ground
Nigga play me once I ain't backin down
Nigga fucked me once think he fuck in me again
I might aswell go to jail and be a punk then
I got connects in Detroit Michigan
You coke price fucked up see yo boy and I'm fixin it
I be all in Atlanta Georgia
I still be hollerin at them haitians down in Miami Florida
I'm a hustler baby said he fired me
But that wasn't nothin cuz the streets hired me
 + (B.G.)
Geezy where you been man Geezy where you been
(man I been tryna make a dollar out off 15 cents)
I heard Juve went back now is you goin back
(you know Juve thats my dawg but I ain't rockin like that)
Geezy where you been man Geezy where you been
(man I been tryna make a dollar out off 15 cents)
Say Juve went back now is you goin back
(man Juve thats my dawg but I ain't rockin like that)

I done had a one on one with Lil Wayne
Told him I got the game for him to do his own thing
I done had a one on one with Lil Turk
I told him kick that dope and we can make shit work
I done had a one on one with Juve to
I told him handle his business and holla when he through
Nigga know I'm a hotboy for life
But I ain't goin back ain't no matter the price
I dont need no nigga, nigga need me
I'll jack him for I let him birdfeed me
I'm a fool with that pistol better ask around
If I'm broke I make niggas pay draft Uptown
I had coke make a fiend catch a cab Uptown
I told him on V.L. on the ave Uptown
It's 2004 if you real then you know
The streets is all mine Chopper City in the do

I’m Try’n,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Verse One: B.G
I'm tryin' to do right
But I'm surrounded by wrong
Avoid the all night flight
And still make it on my own
I'm tryin' be cool
Do what I gotta do
But playa haters all over
So I roll with my crew
I'm tryin' stay over
And just stay my ass in school
Ain't many choices to choose
And this rap game I can't refuse
I wanna win don't want to be the one to loose
My pistol my only friend
Cause busters try to bring the blues
Leavin brains with no clues
Spin the ben in black clothes
They tryin' ta' take my only life
Leave my folks on the front row
Bury me in providence
Heavy weight that rose
They wanna steal the B.G
Now tell me Alton
Ain't that cold
What can I do
Now what can I do to get out the game
What can I do
Now what can I do to make change
Every other day around my way niggas dyin'
Hours flyin I want to go straight boy I'm tryin'
-Chorus- (Juvenile)
I'm tryin' to shake the monkey off of me
Lord please let me go where I needs to be
Ball 'till I fall it's a poor family
Fo' sho' I know the future got a lot of stuff for me
Verse Two: B.G
I'm tryin' to get my mail straight
Sell cd's and tapes
I don't want to be jail bait
Niggas want to kill me
And increase the hell rate
They almost got me
But I slip the spot it was too late
I wanna be a role model for my lil' brother
And buy a fifteen room manison for my mother
Settle down wit' a silent hoe
And drop a tight seed
So I can raise another uptown B.G
Just like me
I'ma give 'em but I wish had a dad
He goin' be smart and bad nigga
Throwin' up a solga rag
This world is kurupted
The police is crooked
My boy was runnin with a ??? gun
His young life they took it
This ??? is rotten
Everyday it get's colder
They throwin' away the key
Sendin' the soldiers to angoula
My round slangin' that yola
With they hand on that iron
To keep my mind right
Beleive nigga I'm tryin'
-Chorus-
Verse Three: Lil' Wayne
I'm tryin' to be a man at fourteen
Choppin iron at fourteen'
Nigga that tells my only way
(B.G.: Look where you stand at fourteen)
A lil' bity something
Whuckin, representin' partners
Ain't to good in my neighborhood
Uptowns my partner
I ain't lie i'm tryin
To go the right way
But the night flight way
Just ain't the right way
I wan' be a gangsta but also wan' live
So I choose to be a uptown HotBoy hard to kill
Sittin' behind the cruiser wheel
Can't even see me I'm so lil'
And you expect me to give this
Just to switch to positive
As hard as I'm tryin' do it I just can't make a shape
School I'm tryin' go through it but I just can't make a shape
Gettin' in beef that resultin' into serious gun slangin
Do good I want yeah but on half i just keep hangin'
I'm lookin for a change but change ain't lookin for me
Will I remain a B.G
Or a A student
We'll see
-Chorus- 2x",https://genius.com/Bg-baby-gangsta-im-tryn-lyrics
