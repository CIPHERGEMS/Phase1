Muslim Wedding,A3C Volume 1,2011,"Should have brought that wasabi
That horseradish
Cubed up
Fuckin' sniffin' that horseradish

Yo I'm the young Laird Hamilton
Hoppin' out the chopper
Scorin' like I'm Messi but this game is far from soccer
Giambi on the lenses and the juice is from the doctor
Jar still full of drugs
An 80s Caddy painted aqua
Take these and freeze they nose
Dick sucked by a seasoned pro
Info on the need to know
Motherfucker you don't need to know
Gimme trees to blow
I keep the caesar low
I want the head, the shoulders, and the knees and toes
From the hottest summer to the freezing snow
Mind higher then a bleeding nose
I'm Bobby Fischer
Check mate
You're like a Spanish Roasted Chicken
Break your chest plate
And yes I just ate
I keep that napkin near me
My favorite uncle went to summer camp for racketeering

Tossin' money like a Muslim Wedding
Sleep on satin bed sheets with the custom threading
Tossin' money like a Muslim Wedding
Sleep on satin bed sheets with the custom threading

This be that whore house visitor
Watch em' while they scissor
103 your Roosevelt
Fancy on the shoes and belt
Nasty pussy tuna melt
Stinky like a China street
You're bound to find me where the corporate and the grimy meet
Lay flat on designer sheet
She kept asking me to grind her grease
So I pound a freak like a pound of meat
Top dog cause I hound the street
I'm makin' poopy on your head cause this is easy
Old Italian men inside the kitchen making cheeses

Tossin' money like a Muslim Wedding
Sleep on satin bed sheets with the custom threading
Tossin' money like a Muslim Wedding
Sleep on satin bed sheets with the custom threading",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-muslim-wedding-lyrics
Shiraz,Bon Appetit..... Bitch!!!!!,2011,"We've been the best since I stepped in
Bring a hooker to the muthafuckin Jets Inn
In the sack, break her back like a Redskin
Need the dough like I'm trying to get the bread thin
Tree to make the head spin
Every season play the corner like I'm Revis
Light Caesar, heavy bearded like I'm Jesus
New York City, Queens borough be the backdrop
I bring it back to all the benches, need a blacktop
Big things, see me moving like a Sasquatch
Money, I'm in pursuit, cuchillo inside the boot
Bitches are on display, give brain inside the coupe
Shift gears, that's with the left
Which means I'm on the right, get paid
By any means, you hold it, say goodnight kid
Two fingers hold the potion when I'm smoking
Slow motion, snatch a snapper out the ocean
In my lungs go the drugs like the red chief
Red leaf lettuce blood money on the bench seat
12 courses laid up on the long table
Aged wine got me spinning like a dreidel
For fly women use a condom cause it's fatal
Hazel eyed bitched always blazing up the basil
The red razor cut the features in your facial
Creep in Corona,
 
bumping Fernando Villalona
Puffing cheeba in the street by the chimi corner
Tu no ta pa mi, muthafuckas are sloppy
Captain of the rap, you talking to papi
Up in Niagara Falls, make your wifey suck a
Bag of balls, it's sick, just like a Magic cough
Same person on camera or when the muthafuckin' camera off
Hash straight from the desert,
 can knock
A camel off, Sheep straight out of school
Let the hammers off. Off the boat shit
Whole cliques roll thick, no shit
Piss drunk and they smoke sticks
Not a word of English but
They hold the four-fifths
FILA jumpsuit, sandals, the whole shit
Young kids walking around, got the Desi in hand
Going ""Boom Shakalaka!"" like it's NBA Jam
Never speak to fuzz
Tap out the reefer, show him how
To use his sneakers, cuz
Roasted peppers, sweet tomatoes, heirloom
We on the beach, fresh Ceviche
We in Cancun,
 fly girly curly
Hair is getting read through
We in the shower give me head: shampoo
Swimming trunk, shoe accentuate the ankle
Eyes blue, put the children's money in the Banco
Giuseppe Franco,
 take the cash and tango
I'm straight stoned -sly, thank you
Bye, peace, one, fuck you",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-shiraz-lyrics
Imported Goods,Bon Appetit..... Bitch!!!!!,2011," Oh my god, this mothafuckin' sour is too good
I don’t even be fuckin' with that other shit

I need that shit that tastes like fuckin', fuckin' soap
Joy, Ajax. Shit… ayo, this is what I be doin' on that…

Orlando Magic warm-up suits and black Shaqs
'95: younger Bronson on the fast track
To blast gat, now I'm looking past that
I want the cash stack higher than the NASDAQ
I put the work in, the downtime I'm cooking lamb
A thousand Dutches in the air like it's a reefer jam
Aretha jam, you better R-E-S-P-E-C-T me
Or risk the forest where the motherfucking rest your team be
Peking duck, and large liver, goose carver
Swiss Bally's, smoke cigar just like a new father
You know the motto, jacket to the knee
I can't help if I'm a fiend, I had to tap into the beat, Lord
Spark a seance, cause everybody lifted
I'm like the strainer with the fucking powder being sifted up
This is Queens Day, alleys where the fiends play
Yo cuff the Guess on the construction, take it easy

This for my people making sales until they back hurt
See the beast on the creep, they let the Mac squirt
Bitch on the backs, that do the dippies on the bikes, and
Loud pipes and rocking leathers like a wild Viking
My man who just came home, and some are going up
Fiends up in the alley, sippin Balley fucking throwing up
Keep your mind straight, focus on the prize
Always diving into thighs, blowing smoke into the skies

Bronsonelli the problem, we got the party reeking
Never see us starving, all my people hardly speaking
When it's time, though, we form into a single file
Spray the fucking ballcourt without hitting a single child
Hop in the Beamer, Pigeon popping the nina
Getting top in a steamer, scoping rock in a Tina
Hooker, that type of looker eat the pussy from the back
Take the children to the school, baking cookies, serving packs all day
Know the verbal, is Oscar-winning
You cop a squat to piss in, only focused on them rocks that glisten
Suppositories in the ass of you, the green Fila with a Horsey how this motherfucking bastard do
Bet the crib that you ain't fucking with this grown man
I'll E. Honda a thousand, slap you with the whole hand
Sex a dime, herbally, a blessed time
Check the rhyme motherfucker, better recognize

This for my people making sales until they back hurt
See the beast on the creep, they let the Mac squirt
Bitch on the backs, that do the dippies on the bikes, and
Loud pipes and rocking leathers like a wild Viking
My man who just came home, and some are going up
Fiends up in the alley, sippin Balley fucking throwing up
Keep your mind straight, focus on the prize
Always diving into thighs, blowing smoke into the skies

The eyes slanted from the origami, I roll a quarter of the water
Near the border, where you oughta find me
The Tamborine Man pumping while the Tyson burning
Air Tech Challenge, clay court, checks balance
Stay endorsing that weak shit, my team spit
That mean shit, like stepping in some fiend's shit
Now you sick to your stomach because you stunted
Word got fronted, another motherfucking jerk confronted
Post pattern, Lonnie threw the loaf at 'em
Flushing, motherfucker, keep a toast up by the gold Saturn
Little doulas on the block we tell 'em ""go stab 'em""
Relieve him of his shoes, it's easier to toe tag 'em'
Carhartt sets and Horseys like the Preakness
Bronson love a freak bitch, dining on that Greek dish
That's the a-hole, all my people AWOL

Get Off My P.P.,Bon Appetit..... Bitch!!!!!,2011,"Lace up your Timbs, Queens, fresh off the blacktop
Off Broadway recital, fiends on the backlot
Back alley Bronson always cookin' up a mad plot
The shit that have us laid in Benzes with a glass top
Hash pot, stickin' out the dash spot
I'll leave a bitch in a vacant and let his ass rot
174 and autobahn is where the cash drop
Then take the paper, then distribute to the have-nots
I'm on the scene, 26, and I'm a manchild
Long machete, hopping out the van style
Whether fightin' or graffiti, got them hand styles
I'll wipe the floor up with your face like a ShamWow
Hands down, one motherfucker
260 combined, here to bring the ruckus
The bassline plus the words raise the crime rate
Bronsolini show 'em how to hold a 9 straight

Yo, get off the next man's P.P
Be original, kid, get off the P.P
Get off the shaft of my dick, get off the P.P
Yo, be original, kid, get off the P.P

Yo, the drugs are rolled up, the money fold up
I love my bitches big-body like an old truck
With their waists sliced thin just like the cold cuts
Been at the bottom of the sea, but then I rose up
Feet first, my voice is known to curl a honey's toes
Serve a pound of that, I'll leave 'em with a bloody nose
Smoke the hash, takin form just like it's putty, holmes
Hop in the Caddy, leave your body by a muddy road
A dirty rotten scoundrel like Steve Martin
Drugs so good, Fiend Weekly just three-starred 'em
I'm on the road, blow trees through East Harlem
Just put me in a cage in the basement, I'm retarded
German shift, twist, burn the bliss
I love it when the pussy tighter than a tourniquet
Copped the chicken, started cookin' and converted it
Dutch leaf, third of it, roll it up, murder it

Yo, get off the next man's P.P
Be original, kid, get off the P.P

T.K.O,Bon Appetit..... Bitch!!!!!,2011,"Ladies and gentlemen
Coming to the ring
At a whopping 273 pounds
Standing at 5'7 3 quarters and a half
Out of Flushing, Queens
It's.....

Fly in the winter like a flock of birdies, I never rocked a derby
You see the polo, U.S.A. right on the hockey jersey
Every step that I take mimicking no man
Precision flow man, motherfucker get with the program
Compare the lord to no man, moves I never fake em
Aura like Wagyu beef, you just a Steak-Umm
Paired with shiraz for the taste to serve at table side
My lyric through the vocal take my palette on a flavour ride
It's obvious I'm gonna do it, right outta Flushing
Percussion gushing after the session right to the luncheon
On my Scandinavian shit, serve up a puffin
Find a shorty, gargle her mouth and stuff her muffin
Duffin many blunts to the neck, what you expect?
I'm a vet show the respect, same shit your father get
Very humble, Jim Brown, never fumble
Know the purple in season and well then I'll take a bundle
We in the street like a hooker's feet
I'm known for cooking meat, cooking beats
And wildin' like I'm Booker T
Bronsolini walking like a cowboy
Sharp at the feet steel and got the alloy
Straight outta New York the bad liuetenient, Bronsolini
Team leathered down, the angel I like's in the pini
You oughta see me, uptown coppin' the chimi
Puffin the pudo, fuckin' some culo, Bronson the chulo
Jaws of white shark ready for the swimmin'
Haze and linen with razor vision make the blade decision
Peep the beeper, Lonnie do the street procedure
Legendary shit for how my brother heat the beaker
Exquisite beard lined up, that's for the ladies
Plus I'm bout to be in Turkey G'd up riding Mercedes
Know Hugginatti keep the ceaser wavy, Bronsolini with the seasoned gravy
Just add the cheese for flavi
Straight to the table cause it's best when I'm hot
Play me funny kick your nuts until your testicles pop
Exhale the doja, when it's full moon I lose composure
Lesson 1: cuddle your son. Brought to a closure
Dabble in truffles, Sauvignon blanc simmered in mussels
Nothing ever ripped from my neck during a tussle
A bolo young I'm Lecter with the muzzle
Injector of the deck I place the sectors in the puzzle",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-tko-lyrics
The Come Up,Bon Appetit..... Bitch!!!!!,2011,"2009 Action Bronson
Hey yo, you know we creeping on the come up
Outdoorsman shit, here we go

I've seen a fiend scrape the residue and sniff it off a razor
After party for politicians with loafers and a blazer
Skipping AAA I'm coasting straight up to the majors
Linen in every seat drinking wine and eating capers, square
Holding the ground prep the animal for sacrifice
Rub the body with plenty garlic and a classic spice
Holy Trinity, peppers onions celery
Every time I rap I'm on the verge to catch a felony
Standing in circles with my brothers puffin' product
Disturbers to the public call the coppers blew the spot up
Pulled us over a couple of 50's in the ankle socks
Most of it powder so it looks just like his ankle lock
I got the rap shit in the ankle lock
I got her screaming for submission trying to be up in the bank a lot
Currency’s the only logic, brother bag the work
Come up funny, I leave you open like a faggot's shirt
Hey yo, you know we creeping on the come up
Action Bronson 2009 shit
Hey yo, you know we creeping on the come up

You know the saga, knee length coat made of llama
Purple in the Parma, two ki's the Grana Padano
That’s for the cuisine, stracciatell Siciliana
Boom fakers be gettin' vapor dog you get with Anna
The wild fumes, beauty that the ground blooms
Ass fucking the diva leave her with the brown moon
It's now June, tops get lowered off of whips
Flower flip, we grow the mushrooms out the cattle shit
Peddle shiftin' with my eyes closed I'm feeling great
Fire kissing the roasted salmon on the cedar plank
Peep the plan get the money out the bordello
Five-seven the fattest ass, shorty played the cello
Charge a thousand for fifteen, the white collars
Got the manuva serving knowledge for the pipe scholars
Peace to Queens, she the queen of the life
Eating Pio Pio chicken, smothered beans in the rice
And we out

You know we creeping on the come up
You know we creeping on the come up",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-the-come-up-lyrics
Marijuana Bronson,Bon Appetit..... Bitch!!!!!,2011,"Marijuana Bronson
Yo, The land fertile I provide for the biz
Play possum with the pigs stuff a dime on the kid
Just scripted for the brothers holding knives on they bids
Gift basket full of figs, I'm sipping wine with the fizz
I got that pure smoke, gorgeous like a sushi plate
Five sticks of marijuana I hallucinate
The tan Timothy, jacket to my knee
Classic I'm a G, I'm the captain of the sea
See, It be those kids from queens in guess jeans
Pulling bread schemes smooth as jet streams that let the lead scream
We still rhyme fly words over percussion
Nine - five Style max out diamonds in Flushing
I'm still the man immoral Its hard to navigate through coral
Your bitch with the tits still give the slamming oral
Zero Fifty Six used to be the beeper code
You know the dope'll force a fiend into the sleeper hold
You mother fucker I got you

Ay yo, Mountains are capped with snow though it's the summer months
I'm working hard for that money laundered in other fronts
Forty blunts in the museum
Jerk chicken patties out the window cop the tyson out the coliseum
A Street Fighter with the Killer Instinct for Mortal Kombat
The title holder higher than a giant's shoulder
Lamb roasting over open fire
Full moon hallucinations giving in to all my souls desire
Lyrically, I'm Doctor Lector, You Doctor Seuss
I let him fall from off the roof and now I got the juice
I'm on that one way path headed for nowhere
Frozen nose hairs all I know, better be dro there
Pass the Thyme, chocking off the truest reefer
Lawrence Taylor in his prime with the smoother Caesar
Drinking ginger out the Yankee cup
The holy grail telling tale blowing cheeba eating tangy duck

Mother Fucker, Queens
These are the vividries of life that I'm expressing to you
Smoke salmon or coke famine your friend'll do you
Cause you make a little paper but you acting greedy
They'll cook ya momma in front of you just like hibachi Peaty
There's no Tahiti, forty five scrolls in graffiti
Beamers on BBs, the shit only seen on the TV
It really happened in the galaxy of Queens
Giving credit you indebted off the fallacies of fiends
I walk a road less traveled, push the foreign car
Often spark steel and known to play the gun guitar
The drugs sell by themselves you just a common factor
Real star is in the jar you the supporting actor
Blood thirsty so I'm howling at the moon
Puff a pound of boom, marijuana, she met a valid doom
We gotta get it cause we living for the minute
Keep the windows tinted, smoke in the whip, keepin it lemon scented",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-marijuana-bronson-lyrics

Razor sniff,
 
leave the pocket when you see the Blitz
You never know the type of pickle you in
Till you wake up in a cell and nuts will tickle your chin
It's Vinny Gorgeous with the sinister grin
And if it wasn't for the drugs I'd probably be in the gym
If I'm not up in the studio, I'm up in your wife
If you had a bigger package she'd be up in your life
In 93' I had to cop me the Flights, started plottin the heist
So I cop me a knife, these sneakers cost a hundred forty duke
I'm stoppin' your life, better yet I'll cut your cock off with the choppin device
You never know it could be you up on the table
Emergency rush in will pull your bladder through your navel
Special pants cover that feces bag, another man rockin that chain
And the piece he had, We kill the cow carve it for the proper preparations
Braise the leg sir the loin make the brisket Cajun
Rib eye prime prefer you leave the bone in,
 
the tomahawk chop is only meant for grown men
Zonin' sequin shirts with the stone gems
I'll never have it, duke—I'd rather let the chrome sin
Equip for the rip, you faggot pussies sit where you piss
These queens killers hit the strip with the sniff, bitch
Roll up the grass crazy willy man will stuff your ass
With a gerbil, serve your girl a custard mask
Crush the glass, dip my fist and step inside the ring
Inside the bing,pussy ran he tried to hide the thing
Come through to the courts, a hundred down from any spot
Dribble shoot, the penny drop just like a henny shot
You look astonished, face twisted like a Twizzler
My people laughin cause they know we goin sizzler
Purpose to life, prestige pussy plenty paper
Steam risin off Jacuzzi women different flavors
Whips are major, shits aggressive like a vicious saber
You trick the paper, tell your bitch that I'mma hit it later
Accurate palm strikes, on like disposition, John Stockton
I'm scoring and I'm also dishin
Magic long night pipe with no intermission
Put on the DL, Tommy John no more pitchin
This is Queens watch words, just like Persian
Jissepe Dishdo Automatic with the conversion
You never know might be the next to meet the surgeon
Split like a pig, and left you bleedin like a virgin
Inhaler of smoke the fine chronic conoisseur
We Bobba Ghanoush the tan colored pile of Raw
The humus and bread, olives from another land
And fuck a burger, i'd rather eat the mother lamb
I'm Royce Gracie the magician of submission, elegance in the kitchen
My ambition ain't to glisten, but yo, Fuck all the jewelery shit
Provide me with a sturdy whip, a package on the dirty bitch
Titty size a 36, 30 dicks what she takin in a single sittin
Silk and linin what I'm sportin when the Eagles winnin
Yo bet the oval, cause the corners are a little iffy
In a minute turn a macho man a little sissy
I'm never pissy, all the women wanna kiss the
Flushin grizzly, heavy but they never diss me

Mi hermano, got the jugo in the bottle
En el camino, burning rubber, hit the throttle
Life in the fast lane, licensed to flash change
Hyphen the last name, twice when the cash came
Currently I'm moving forward from some past pain
Spit the shit that have us hopping out of glass range
Watch when people get some money how their class change
Cop a crib right by the lake for twenty 
Carve initials in the grass, Edward Scissorhands the bushes
Lean on Tempur-Pedic, smoking seven different kushes

Pussy, pussy, pussy
We have black pussy
We have smelly pussy
We have yellow pussy

We back by old timers
And young up-and-comers
Plot in the winter then we storming all up in summer
Fuck the dime piece, I want a deuce or better
I mean the smoke dimes fine when they give a header
Gimme a nine or eight, with a cute face
Appreciate it, shoot game, and roll blue eights
I'm on the J train, BK hop off at Myrtle
I'm on one puff away from Dante's Inferno
But I don't want to burn, unless it's crystalized
Put one high, smoke the pain away, the morning time

Eyes are on the Zonda,
 eyes low from puffin ganja
My fuckin life is like a ghetto drama, sip the green tea
Polish off the metal cause we men of honor
You see the P, left side of the Cardigan sweaty
Well now you know that I'm a rocker like Marty Jannetty
The low shit, kill the pussy with the whole dick
Slicker than the oil on the marble with the flow shit
Hard bottoms cat's be clickin' like the horses do
We just dined, but I'm down to take your portion too
Smoke a few sticks, poke a few tricks
Shave the points off the game call it Blue chips
This ain't Shaq an penny action squeeze the Mac elevy
Tsunami lyric from the inner corner crack the levy
Snake the hash cause my skills tight pair the salmon with the dill right
Grab your hammer and hold your shield tight

My life is inches from death I blow the piff on the step
Spit the phlegm, hold my dick when I rap, plus the suede feet
Play the street, hear the music of the city lights flashin
With high fashion and some nice titties
Drug dealers sell the drugs are for realin
Angry mothers cuff there children when they walk in the buildin'
We stand tall, like the great wall i'll never fall
Disobey the law, summer spring and fall don't forget the winter
Before Splinter and the turtles, rock the lightweight
Lo' jacket with the man, hopin the hurdle vicious with verbal

Hit you hard like London Fletcher, leave you sleeping on the stretcher
Action Osama ain't the one to play games with
Ain't shit changed dick, I'm still the same with the same click, prick
Cross your legs when you sit down in the chair
My nuts are there, rape your mother live in despair
We'll take the candy out your daughters mouth
Order up a porterhouse, smoke a quarter ounce
Cores at the Norvin House, corner standing below three
Frozen cheeks, frozen feet
Niggas holding heat cause its a cold street
Heavy bearded blowing blunts the face, roll another blunt to chase
Roasted perfection perfectly done to taste
Old and new it's Nike zooted like a lunar flight
Been blowing Buddha right, I never eat the tuna, sike
Both fists are gloved up, you dumb fuck
Get left in dump trucks, when I commence the duck hunt
Two o'clock you hear the cannon pop, right outside the Spanish spot
Converted the drug den we call the cannon spot
Grab the money out the safe, shoot him in the waist
Just a little taste, before I finish off his face
Sports drop lightly breaded like a pork chop
Drug and gems, money stashed it in the floor spot
Barry Bronson shooting juice before the Mitchell Report
Never snitching in court, we blitzing the fort
All my niggas pitching for sport
Putting up Clemen numbers, four bitches shit in the bag
And now there's seven Hummers

Hey yo a fantasy crazy the form it is
Of a supreme being that has strange ways of gathering cream
Grade-A stopped of cop blocked hard rocks and
Get knocked by undercover narcs in the park after dark
Oil dripping, tire spinning free will showing that crime sells
Doing big deals with krills, eating high-priced meals
We still dipping police, flipping hashish
Causing moms great grief, when you hit them streets
Cause we have precise understanding of dismantling
Words you planning, you start to scrambling
Put your life to gambling, the black heart nigga
Who start shit no babe? departed
I know more than one word besides arson
I got intensity with my history
Blaze, haze more than the sun rays
Glow more the MICer with the Jerry-curl glaze
My passion is right there with fashion
I feel a fever
That's why I'm reaching like a baby that was teething
Saying it's time for me to start the eating
Science is teaching
You preaching prophecies of an untold road
That finally unfold that behold the truth of the real foes
ID's were known
My pat is on they toes
Shot fired, police scatter like crows
Full-body blow
React like a high women terrain like it's Halo
Blunts burn slow, I put pieces together like it's Lego
Before you say go, six niggas hit the floor like ""Yeyo!""
Dry up and crumble like it's Play-Doh

To have the whole team creamy like alfredo
The mozzarella, basil, oil, and tomato
The thirty year balsamic laid up on that table
Next to me, a cigarette of drugs lay
There in my lungs that's while i'm driving, never drunk, wait
In the taxi shorty blessing me with tongue play
Ditch the cab, gonna twist it up the one-way
She lost a shoe, I bounced - dipped on her
Just a victim of the cold world to get warmer
Then I dipped with my spic friend in a quick Honda
Pick up a package from Juan down at the ship harbor
Sell it off in the crib, making the shit marble
Mar-vel taking chugs out of the big bottle
Dick sucks disappears thanks to a thick model
Her ass is fat but the coconut is a bit hollow
No point in asking if the motherfucking bitch swallow
Absolut(e), like the shit that's in the clear bottle

Crew a bunch of dykes and some Puerto Rican strippers
From Ridgewood she did her thing just like a bitch should
But in the morning started burning, I can't piss good
I cleared that up though
Diver’s scallops, sear ‘em
Seven grams of fuzzy in the palm’ll be the serum
The Rocketeer, out in Switzerland we poppin’ there
Mulatto babies cause you know your boy's a chocolatier
Haze galore, going Asian on the carpet
Artichokes and lamb
From the land not from the market
Blunts rolled consecutively
Who every really thought this motha fucka destined to be?
This type of style on the mic
Get razzled, dazzled
Stretch you like pilate
Penetrate your flower then I split
Karate
The shotty Hollywood, I gave the bitch a nosejob
And fuck a new Benz I'd rather cop the old Saab
Velour down short set paired with the cream joints
Wine, I always swirl it and smell it
Make an esteemed choice
My cheese sauce always known to keep a fiend moist
I swear my words’ll have me hopping out the green Royce
Rolls and blunted, crispy chicken, aged cheddar

Peace to my people and the groupies let me jam the coochi
Tropical island destinations hopping out the coupé
My flow is Sexual Chocolate not outta Jackson Heights
But out of Flushing where we hitting hard like Quinton Jackson fights
Been on the rampage, you motha fuckas half as nice
Verbally jig you with the banger then I pass the knife
Right to my man because he always in position
To split you like it's division, deliver with the precsion
Of Eleven weapons posing by as Heaven beckons
You on that escalator up in under seven seconds

Yo why my marijuana always thinking crime shit?
Cause lambs delicious with the '87 wine dig
The whip feel good, we're shifting with the left hand
The leather glove and loafer matching with the vest and
I'm on a mission for dollars and I'm a dreamer
Doing drugs and fucking bitches with bottles inside the steamer

Night Court,Bon Appetit..... Bitch!!!!!,2011,"Behind door one:
There's three things: greed, fortune, and fame
Door two:
You might be happy but nobody know your name
Door three:
The bacon got you squatting naked by the razor fence
Door four:
You on the bench and got the drugs inside your favorite Tims
Cause on the road to riches, there ain't no time for getting sidetracked
Pump in the trunk if you frontin' punkin' you lie flat -
Down on the pavement
Diamond laser engraved it
Wasting all of my time and then wondering where my days went
I'm 26 but still I'm feeling like a senior
I'm only two years removed from leaning in the beamer now
Some friends ain't friends no more, I guess they jealous
Problems with baby mama constantly been like a relish to my
Neck fresh on the set live in the flesh
Rhymin the best
Yo,,Bronsolini fans see hymen and breast
Talking sushi grade
My flow is linen and the shoes are suede
The wooden cutting board is right where the prosciutto laid
That's for the first course
The core burst off and hail
We'll be in hell but nobody trying to see the cell
Tonight we living life until we say goodnight
Breathe on the mic my flow knock the knees of a knight
My time always the right time
I'm surfing getting wavy
Like Hawaiians on the pipeline, I'm never in my right mind
Zagat rated thirty foot decor
The food and service
Hey the blow is chopped up on the plate yo peace to Curtis
Never nervous cause I'm ready
Went from leaning in the German now we swerving in the Chevy
Artichokes cover spaghetti
Can't begin to fathom how I pair the words and form the sentences
Pierre Cardere described in bold print on the lenseses
One leaf, half of the dutch combat the cancer
Peace to Elton John cause in the jacket got the tiny dancer
Ready to tango
Extra clips inside the pouch just like the creature on the Kangol
Paint that precious shit like Van Gogh
Mango, that's for the lassi
I love when bitches sassy
Slutty nasty, and let me smash it in the taxi
Then I give her a german brunch
And now she turning stunts
Since 16 six times a day I'm burning blunts
I wanna live the life the twenty beamers gleaming shorty steaming rice
And then the fluff all burnt my penis shoot the semen twice in the face
Flyest of steaks, got my eyes on the papes
Rhyme butter lake you know my grading be prime on the steak
Aged to perfection, that's how I like the vino
We rolling ceelo
Throw like Marino
Cruise in the Regal
In overdrive like my libido
I'm stroking like I'm Michael Phelps into the pussy fetal
It's Bronsolino
Just light the dutch up
Leather loaf and mash the clutch up
We getting fucked up
I make the motherfucker beam a  up
Hellish capers and now I'm scoring more than Celtic Lakers
Kicking like Messi now we overlooking gorgeous acres
In my defense, it's like the '85 Bears
There's no jail tales
Poetry in motion like I'm Gale Sayers
Before Maguire took his first needle
Yo, we been looking fly and faucet fiends in corners in the bird fetal -
Positioning I know you hear me but not listening
We glistening I rock a jacket made for fishermen
The buccaneer for nutritional and a buck of deer
Create a hash vat and bake it off, cut a square
Ton of flair like Rick I hold the pick
And plus I smoke a stick of heavy marijuana when I pose for flick
Get off the dick because we busting now
And when we come we eating crepes, you know we order up a dozen now",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-night-court-lyrics

Got her drooling like a retard lapses (aaoaouu) now the shorty told me i should enter through her neck kid

Nasty girl come let me hit it Jay Steelz next nigga gotta get it
Smash that thrust thrust pass its all good about to throw my fist in her ass

Couple bastards running around, make this bitch go down

Imma fuck her to death,fuck her in the ass
Imm fuck her to death, I’m gonna take her up the ass one time Were gonna fuck her to death

Marijuana bake it blowing skama naked with a dominatrix
All her clothes designer(leather), everything finer

Slap her soft then pinch harder
Stick my arm in the rim like Vince Carter
Pull her hair and suck her titty ain't no fucking with me
When the game starting

She stay on E, lay on me, she gay for tree
All she want to do is pass me dro
I love a nasty hoe to lick up my pistachio(thats my nut)
I say I’m a chef to arouse a date
Im serving 2 things tube steak and trouser snake (that dick)
I want a bitch to hold a hammer yo
Right next to the work up in the camel toe (she wants that dick)
And when I’m fucking famished
She punch me in the mouth with a mouse knuckle sandwich
No cheese, no cheese, no cheese, no cheese, no cheese

She ain't a nasty girl she a dumb ass kid
She shit a brick when she seen me jizz
Blew it back like a gust of wind, tapped her jaw shit bust her chin
She gave me head and a piece of her mind
And she hating on the one Dontiva Divine uh
She knows its a waste of time but the memories bitter, taste the lime
She jerk me off with the fluid stroke and she use dish soap for the extra glide
That was back when my money could press rewind
Back when the stable had fresh behind
Genitals were at the barbarian prime
Tearing up butt i was on my grind
Now I’m looking for a brand new groupie
A nasty girl with a butt that could bouff me

Thats right baby,yeah you little bitch,you make that mouth,TRAMP

Wild barbarian open bitch like caesarean hold too much meat never vegetarian
Chicks miss the J-love the packing district
Beside him went mystic fuck so explicit
Orgasm wizard 6 flags roaring rapids
Ignoring Hiv just ask Magic
Always riding thoroughbred apple dub jockey
Dick slapstick Wayne Gretzky hockey
You know its big papi i slide in Dominicans
Keep ass on reservation Foxwood Indians

Light the Earth, like the sun, stars and moon would do
Undefeated like I'm Shula's group
Take a payoff like I'm shoe less soon to see me in the coolest suit
Crew astute, knowledge like a physicist
Secretly a Russian spy twisted by the pyramids
Is it my fault they feel me, more than they feel you?
And seems nobody does it like I do it, keep it real dude
I'm not religious feel like God given ability
Just play your part because your words hold no validity
I'm on a beach, lay oysters on the half shell
Words are like a canvas laced with oil color pastel
I'm in the world strong known to make the Southern moves
Cause every man is for themselves like Royal Rumble rules

They say Bronson got an ego, acting like he Regal
Thought he was my people, just let him go with his ego he on the road kid
Smoking weed to the neck, mother fuck him

Fry the flamingo when we dining, planters on the table
Booby shining the rarest diamonds studs around the navel
Hop out the whip both feet touch at the same time
Greenbacks consolidated with the grey nine
Red dawn cook up the fishes with the heads on
He fanned the Bronsonelli known for never folding bread wrong
Every bill facing the same direction
Shit on my feet, split up the middle
Desert wiley with the suede complexion
Fill the glass, toast the brew, smoke the basil soup
Cop and crash a hazel coup, take a nasal too
Yes indeed I smoke minoras with my people
I'm rolling up the trilogy before I light the fucking sequel
Peppers are grilled with the diploma, the smoker
The apple-wood chip thirty-eight enhancing the aroma
'95 Karl Kani on the vest set
Death threats will get your cut ripped and your chest wet

Exquisite lyric from the vocal so we hold it down
It's word wizardry the queens niggas hold the crown
Fresh out the ground got the hookers with the golden gowns
Profound sound, pound for pound we known the go around

My every move is major, incredible intrepid flow
Rep your soul's a spectacle, but's that's just true to nature
Now who's the crew to lace ya? Timeless, the Truth will amaze ya
Euphemisms be like euthanasia we through with the flavors
I read your blueprint watch you take the foolish steps
You don't deserve my cents if you was UNICEF
The Judas left the Southern sun and god for thirty pieces
All my thesis to the wisest recognize the dirty features
We working on getting work in
You hear the shotty bursting with Lonnie be lurking
Say your prayers like Donnie McClurkin
We fly to the grave site like kamikazes
And maintain the same brain frame as Hammurabi's
So paraprofessionals know I'm a be skeptical
Never handing out respect unless it's exceptional

On The Real,Bon Appetit..... Bitch!!!!!,2011,"Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue
Because you treat me like shit
I paid for the bed and never even slept in it
I paid for that crib and never stepped foot in
And now somebody else is eating all the pudding
Things change, now my dashboard wooden
All black Benz, like a young Doc Gooden
Dark shades, cause I'm stone crazy
Girl, we grown, stop playing on my phone, baby
All your childish attempts to make me angry fall short
Which only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing
Understandable, I'm shining brilliant with five Brazilians
There were times I used to hide my feelings
Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini
And motherfuckers can't see me
Wait 'til this chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy
Who would've thought I hit you right back?
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue
So many women wanna call me baby
And you wonder why the fuck that I ain't call you lately
Some would say that I'm the symbol for sex and uh
Others would hate, but I don't give 'em no breath
Go on a date, I'm at the crib with the chef and uh, that's me
And you could order whatever
The specialty is white snake and underwear sauce
You could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next
And I understand that's only cause I'm popular
I'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera
As Bocelli sings the celly rings
I gotta go, you'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king
I'm not exactly flawless, but I'm gorgeous, just like a horse is
I know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous
Still I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue
I hope you get a paper cut on your tongue
From a razor in a paper cup
I hope every soda you drink already shaken up
I hope your dreams dry like raisins in the baking sun
I hope your titties all saggy in your early 20's
I hope there's always snow in your driveway
I hope you never get off Fridays
And you work at a Friday's that's always busy on Fridays
I hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket
I hope it's Ben and Socrates poop all up in your kitchen
I hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck
And your headphones short, and your charger don't work
And you spill shit on your shirt
I hope your tears don't hurt, and I can smile in your face
Cut my losses, how Delilah changed my locks to a fade
I hope you happy, I hope you happy
I hope you ruined this shit for a reason, I hope you happy, igh
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?

Lose your data tryna stop me on the course to paper
Mustard loafer hopping out the gypsy cab
One dutch but I copped 150 bag
Thats for my neck just like a scarf in the winter
Plus i spit the type of shit to make you barf up your dinner
Bronson a winner, gorgonzola garlic agenda
Far from pretender shorty take the coat when i enter
The public defender, the man of the people nobody equal
My fam negotiating your life most of em hebrew
Black kosher posing with the black toaster
Me and Hugginatti dipping in the black cobra
American built ground up from ground up
Get ground up, duck never get found fuck
Sharp with the dressing Bronsonelli reek of street essence
Mean Jean holding down the scene and plus we green scented
Reinvented summertime we flee the benches
37 sour diesel blunts to feed the senses
Back to rocking old lives a pair of high 4’s
I eat the dinner of a winner often five course
I rhyme words baby mama say my mind lost
Cause all my garments stay embroided with a fine horse
One for the weed, two for the whip drive in the middle
Three we on the roof she play my penis like a fiddle
Four the tuna raw until i seer it
Five my name is golden though so people try to smear it
Hop up out the six, I’m in the mix, I rock the colorful kicks
I smoke the pure but still I’m quick to cop a bundle of nicks
Eating pussy cause i had to feed the hunger for fish
Time is money when i have it never fumble and shit
Until my suit from France, the bottom of the shoe just like a ball court
Leather so soft, four door porsche
Not the truck panamera and its roughed out
Sitting like a monster on the decker looking puffed out
I take juice my performance enhanced
Never failing any test i got the urine from gramps
94 i begged my mom to cop the Ewing from Champs
The same night dreamt of a bitch and her spewing my pants damn
One motherfucker galaxy of Queens rep
Clients waiting while the custard made a cream set
30 sets of dips fuck all that extra shit

Elegance on the mic corruption chaos man of Steel
The triple goose that we know, foie gras with every meal
A glass of red glass of white glass of pink
6 niggas one bitch and everybody smash and stink
Grab her neck, punch her back, nut one in her shoe
We all went sushi style hoping we don’t catch that flu
Storm the point and overturn thats how this bastard do
Believe in science fuck God ill kill the pastor too
While eating pasta dude, low level prostitute, for money big guns this motherfucker gots to shoot
Marinated for a week, roasted lamb legs
Its Queens nigga the herb smoke is a mandate
Red roses, brown leathers, and black guns
The green money and beige crack attract bums
Fiends fighting for that last wibble  left on the floor
Keeps me dipping in my sock in the back of the store
Flying niggas from overseas to do the hit
Back on the plane the same day movie shit
Got the word they tried to hit me over petty matters
Next scene catch me swinging from the helli ladder
Empty your magazines, shotguns, and rocket launchers, hand grenades, handguns, and fire torches

Two girls, one boy, want her to birth that

Caught up in the young love, kissing and the holding
Sharing lo mein, hit the A train to Rockaway
Plus she only lived a block away
Damn I miss her

This summer love happened underneath the boardwalk
Souls in tune so there's never need for small talk
She held my heart, and no, she'd never leave my side
Through the years, through the struggle
Was a thing of pride

Slush puppies, cocoa, mango, cherry
Mexicans on Roosevelt
Pounding down the Chevy
Go to 1-6-1, to watch the Yankees play
Years later and I'm dealing with the family court shit

And bleu cheese, 
caramel complexion's on two knees
Or two skis, carving up the Alps is what this dude needs

Live fast and eat the big tuna like Billy Parcells
No more child's play kid you with the big boys

 keep the switchblade

Just a taste of the life like a September call up
Johnnie Walker in our tall cup, getting torn up

Never sniff that blanco, that's word to OJ's Bronco
Cop a Dutch and break it open, overfill it
I'm rollin' in the car, it may be shaky, never spill it, though
Cause when I rhyme, I feel possessed by El Espirito
Encounters of a Third Kind, X-Rays on the visual
Ginger ale and hot sauce, two things I live by
I'm such a chill guy, but fuck around and, yes, you will die
Green DeVille, right, green drugs, but hold the serum
Rub the things together, then you clear 'em, flatline
The prosciutto, olives from Tunisia
Drums are hittin' hard because they chopped up like a cleaver
And yes I'm smokin' all the reefer
The night creeper
I love the pussy really tight, that's with a light Caesar
Can it be that I'm the Golden Child, the chosen one
The piggies saying freeze, but every time they did I chose to run
Takin' that attachment on the nozzle like a soldier's gun
Hide behind the boulder, silver bullet through you shoulder, son
Crack the pepper over thin crust that's handmade
I'm stayin' strapped just like the Air Raid
Yo, take a taste of my nuts
Know they sweet just like the candy
Dick is the same color as Band-Aid, understand me?
I built this building, they came and then I conquered
Two hour flights to Heathrow up in the Concorde
Fermented grapes up in my glass that bear the same name
I'm working hard because that's what I need to maintain
Killer Queens is on the rise, so understand me
Ain't never stoppin' 'til there's a Grammy in a room for my family
Also known as a den
Post and toast with Lauren
Posing for pictures, kicking scriptures that form up a phlegm

Uh, let me take a little break fam
I'm fucking straight out of surgery, man
I need a little break
When I come back in, I'mma come back in hard, though
I promise you that
(Look at my motherfucking shoulders, son)

Yo
I'm diving in like Louganis
I'm aiming right for that anus
Trying to give her a payment to rent the pussy like Avis
Peace to Shaevitz & Shaevitz
My rhymes are seasoned for flavor
Fuck with shorties that's in shape, they got the V like they're Vader
Ah ha, Animal Style, flippin' like a flipjack
You heard the cat rap, like animal's fear from a rat, got
Ankle length, that's suede, the jacket
Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke
Do the Chatatimmy Shimmy like a crackhead
No one compare to me, lampin' with my tangerine
I'm fiend out, so I'm bangin' on the tambourine
Yo, bring the drugs and call me when you on the corner
And I'mma send the doja down in case they run up on ya
Your style is celibate, I'm elegant, trust
My style is liver and I'm ivory like a elephant tusk
Swirl the wine inside the glass that got the delicate musk
Shoe be pointy at the toe, closin' down the show
Poison be the flow, got the boysenberry blow
Finish on the women
That mean the bitch from Finland
Her tits are bonkers
Chilling in her chanclas
Rollers in her hair, I'm running through it, Larry Csonka

Bronsolino
You don't even know who fucking Larry Csonka is, man
Get the fuck off my wee-wee
Pussy",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-larry-csonka-lyrics
Ronnie Coleman,Dr. Lecter,2011,"When I’m alone
Smoking weed, sitting by the window in my home
Often thinking why the fuck is it I’m not in Rome
If I had a little motivation, money, and a hot body
I see it now, Bronson, the heart-throbby
No more pigging out, binging on the late night
No more sneaking juice in the syringe to get the game tight
No more pack of hot dogs on my neck right by the fade right
40 pounds to go and then you hookers getting laid right
I’m eating salad but I’m leaving off the croutons
'Cause ever since a youth your dog's huskier than UConn
Savings on the cookies, mommy clipping out the coupons
Passing out from over-eating, sleeping on the futon
Lock the refrigerator, there’s no controlling me
Steak and chocolate got they muthafuckin hold on me
Ain’t trying to be laid in a box, roses on me
Bronsolino running 5 miles for the glory

Lets go, 20 more to go baby boy
Yo you want that V by the crotch right?
Yeah lets go (I want it)
Gimme some pushups
Gimme some dips (I can’t no more)
Let me get some jumping jacks (Gimme a sandwich!)
Yeah you want that steak dinner don’t you? (AAAAH)
Your gonna work that sandwich off now (I need marshmallows!)
Yeah lets fuckin go
20 more miles, lets go you fat fuck
(AH MARSHMALLOWS, GIVE IT TO ME)
You motherfucker, you, fuck you!

From philly cheesesteaks, lobsters on the barbeque
I’m getting twisted eating chicken with a prostitute
An hour later eat the burger with my drug dealer
Then add the butter to the fudge to make the fudge realer
Every five minutes look in the fridges as if magic happened
Sneak a cookie, rip the bag, and fix the plastic wrapping
I don’t want know one to know that I took it
Cause I'm an over-eater (Ay yo ock, ay yo ock, fry the mayonnaise for me, man)
Life is a smorgasbord to me and I’ma over do it
I wanna wear Italian clothing but it just don’t cut it
Not the type that show the package with the crystal studded
The shit they model in Milan that’s looking crispy custom
5 and 6 bitches, lickin’ my dick twitches
Serve up a facial, Mister Belding, bitches dismiss ‘em
For now I’ll take what I can get till this shit switches
Whatever fuck you stupid bitch
Peace to the Drums of Heaven
Peace to beef ribs
Extended lunch time I eat enough for three kids
Go on a diet, then fall off because I’m weak kid
Since I was young I’m eatin’ candy on the sneak tip
My day is based upon fine drugs, cholesterol
Though at my height and weight im probably still the best at ball
I’m tatted up, I have no shame to show the chest at all
I bet I have your lady humming on my testicles

Yeah, Bronsolino
Bout to be fuckin, summer time in the winter

The Madness,Dr. Lecter,2011,"Ayo, you ready? Yeah, I'm ready right, the fast life
Getting twisted almost every night, my mind is deeper
Than the voice featured on Barry White, I'm not the marry type
I make her sit in vinegar to get the candy tight
I’m flattered at all the chatter and comparisons
To the great, soon to see me right on Madison
Bally sneakers trying to stay up out the vat of sins
I tout the tacky shit I'm like a wild Iraqi
Outdoors with my sport vest, leather on the shoulder
Hold the rifle in place, knife in your face
I’m out the world just like a lightning in space
The ice sculptures on the table going nice with the plates of grapes

This is madness, certified madness
Rapping like a bandit, serving my advantage
Singlehandedly slam you to the canvas
Marijuana leaves are getting wrapped just like a bandage

Fuck the love, I want the money and the pussy
Brazilian bitches, names tatted on their tushie
You're a man dressed as a woman, call him Tootsie
I'm in the corner with a hooker playing footsie
Phone in my hands at all times like I'm a pimp, fuck shrimp
We eat steak, wine and cheese plate
Bronsonline the name is ringing out in each state
Play it cool or taste the weapon, time to meet fate
My feet slide just like a hockey player
Eating yakitori, getting hammered in the sake lair
Sucky sucky, happy ending shower
Wifey making dinner, I’ll be home about an hour
Crush the sour, dutches from the Netherlands
My rolling skills is undefeated yo you’ll never win
I bring the devil in, Bronson known for his benevolence
Polo fitted with a leather grip


I wash my dick in the sink right when I wake up
Twisted from the night before raw inside a frightening whore
Hop in the whip and go for breakfast
Fried eggs and prime steak that's straight from out of Texas
Damn I’m living reckless, smoking all day just like the brisket
My beard is golden brown just like a biscuit
Everyday I’m thinking should I risk it, add another number to statistics
Or use the breast milk to eat my Crispix
I’ll feed her coke for a dick suck
Put a fucking roman candle up in this bitch butt
Now it’s on the computer, got the pussy moister than Bermuda
Pop a hole right through her throat, that’s no joke cause I’mma shoot her

Yeah, damn, yo, fuck
Yo, three verses ain't enough anymore these days man? Fuck

This shit is rawer than a tuna on a plate for eighty dollars
Or the sex that I be having though I hate my baby momma
It’s always drama, she got too much time on her hands
Watching Tyra steady planning a plot on your man
My eyes are open like an owl though
Animosity, trying to get the paper, sour dough
But if I die before the hour go
Just place the Ballys on my feet and smoke my body like a pharaoh ho
Egyptian fixtures, patties by the colliseum
Guns from Russia, I turn 'em to a ballerina
Cop the work then they bagging coke
Transporting interstate, Carolina to Tobacco Road
To the knee or to the ankle where the jacket go
Master flow work now so I got cash to blow
When I’m older, leather on a rugby shoulder
I’m top dogging if I’m lying may they slump me over",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-the-madness-lyrics

""Two hundred thirty-one pounds, Barry Horowitz!!""

Yeah, the Chocolatier
Bronsalinio... yeah
To the back with the hat, lean back in the 'llac
Crack the window, hear the soldier styles and that in back
Ain't no ""Cat in the Hat,"" just a cat that can rap
This is Bronson - representing Flushing, Queens on the map
Yeah - heavyweight primate with a Harvard mind
Blunts filled with the citrus mixed with orange lime
Pussy drip when the thought of Action come to mind
Born to ride, winter spring summer shine
Bonafide, eyes wide, run and hide
You don't want the revolution to be televised
Terrorfied from the Arab mountain death camps
With the iron burning hot, give you chest stamps
Phone calls with the cloth over the mouthpiece
With or without leaf, burn about an ounce chief
To the neck like a razor for the stubble
Raised inside the struggle, blazin in the huddle yeah
Dig a hole, throw the lamb in it
Left the slippers in the sand motherfuckers couldn't stand in it
(""Someone took the words to my song"") {*ding ding ding*}
It's Barry Horowitz rap, I pat myself on the back
Don't fake the funk on a nasty dunk, Shaq I attack
Close the window to your soul, weed inside my lungs burn
These old suckers gettin placed into a young urn
Specialized like the little bus
Use my chubby little finger first to stimulate the clitoris
King Kong ain't got shit on us
I'm out here gettin it for real while you motherfuckers filibust'
Weed in my finger flicker, I'm on a solo mission
Started at pole position, eyes on the long division
As it burn my thumb, I roll another one
Quite persistant, that's why they call me my mother's son
Shoot the cold gift, leave your ho stiff
Make your ho sniff Hootie and the Blowfish
Obey the coke king
Cause every motherfucker in rockin loaded, I'm on that old shit!

Moonstruck,Dr. Lecter,2011,"Awww yeah! We in the motherfuckin' place tonight!
Show's about to start guys, everybody get to your seats
Bronsolinio's comin' to the stage
Mmm, knew about the local things what they all talkin' about

Step in the door, Bronsolini, the mayor
The kush replayer, 80's bushy pussy gushy slayer
I'm a star and I'mma prove it
Saw me in the foreign car, shorty had a movement
Comin to your town, lockin' it down, rockin' it out
I'm on fire there's no stoppin' it now, it's tournament edition
Shorty on the arm an ornament for fishin'
Brussels eatin' breakfast in the Orient for chicken, listen
Know my mother wanna see me win
Slide the crack inside the slot you put your CD in
Give a couple bucks, let me live, puff a dutch
Cause ain't no motherfucker playin' me in Suckerpunch
It's my time, no more standin' in line
Now it's time to eat, paired up with the rarest of wine
Hair red just like the meat, never careless with mine
Play your part and stay sharp daddy, cherish your crime

Aiyyo, you couldn't wait to hear this fly shit
Shorty open up your thighs quick, smoke the pussy like a Thai stick
My style is lovin' in the island by Dubai dick
I leave my socks right on the floor cause this is my shit
Intoxicatin' aroma, drugs rolled in a diploma
Beautiful wine, we in Sonoma yo
The cheese plate, fish a pike out the lake
Take a dyke on a date, she let me pipe cause I'm an ape
White limey, maneuver at night, fuck assumption
Bronsolin' bring the truth to the light, that we the best
And ain't no motherfucker tellin' me different
Most talent and I practice, ain't no shock that I'm winnin'
Double-layered linens
Known for sinnin' in cinnamon women in tinted renteds
Cinderella pendants, the Lord flow tremendous
All I got is myself so fuck a co-defendant
Struck ass stripper, she tried to play me yo the whore's demented

Bronsolinio, Amuse Bouche
Just a little fuckin' taste of that mouth bitch",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-moonstruck-lyrics
Bag of Money,Dr. Lecter,2011,"""Where's the fucking money, shitheaddddddddd???!!!""

Yo, fucking Paulie TRYBE, man
Get your muthafucking hand out her asshole
We gotta go, fam, we gotta go, kid
Yo, get the whip, get the whip!

I'll take 21st Century poets that's for a thousand
Curly hair or Nubian women get me aroused
To the point I wanna gamble it all
I was smashing from the back
She put her hands on the wall
She couldn't take the thrust
Only lust like a fiend for the dust
Or the pizza from Pezzi, perfect
Want to sleep with the crust
Or the 740 Alpina, leather seats is a must
And my shorty holding a nina
Rolling green in a duuuuuuuuuutch!
Bronsolini, organically I rise to paper
In the purest form, lyrically derived from nature
Like the Amazon, put your cameras on
Watch this muthafucka turn into an animal!
Light stubble, rock the muzzle like Hannibal
Jump off the top of the boat into a cannonball
Hoes with gold teeth, we off the coast of Greece
In under 3 seconds, muthafucka load the piece
Kid, the bag of money coming with me
You muthafucka
The bag of money coming with me
Yeah, the bag of money's coming with me
Muthafucka you

Surprise! Lauren is in the house
I eat fowl birds and keep a hen inside my mouth
Always extra, guest featuring with Dr. Lecter
Like Bald Head Slick, I hold my mic like a scepter
Rest in peace, Guru, son I rep Q-U
Chains on chunk
They looking at me like ""who you?!""
These handmade Cubans probably fucking up my posture
Pesto sauce properly drizzled upon my pasta
No imposter, son I'm authentic
Around drugs so much, I'm probably raw scented
Bag of money dips, triceps is all dented
Precise painting pictures
Think about life and then I pen it
Nike Air extraordinaire, it’s a cold world, prepare
That’s what it is, dad
Winterize your vehicle
I love kicks like Action Bronson loves a reefer pull
Peace to good, bad girls that let us both sleep with you
The bag of bitches coming with me
Word up, son, all the bitches coming with me
Yeah, yo, the bag of bitches coming with me
We go raw son, all the bitches coming with me!
We making babies tonight, nigga
Yeah, smoke what you want, sniff what you want
You wanna have five daddies, you ever have five daddies before?

Ayo, 2010, got ‘em buzzing like a beeper
Round table discussion
Conference in Geneva
Leaders at the table, poly over nasal
Forty seven minutes since the time I lit the basil
My rhymes are carte blanche
Liver than the Oscars
Extra virgin olive oil drizzled on the pasta
Fry the bacon, make it sizzle for the chazers
Honor in this thing of ours
Living like the mobsters
Compliments go to the chef and that’s the real
My crew of goonies in the joint
We need some extra veal
You know the Caddy got an extra wheel
And if I’m ever in a pickle, I can hand a fucking Tek to Steele
Take aim and knock an apple off your head
And I’m a play like Polamalu
You get tackled for the bread
We’re running in your crib
Your shorty shackled to the bed
Money laying on the Persian
Leaking plasma from the lead
And it’s on!

The bag of money’s coming with me, muthafucka
(It’s all coming with us, nahimean?
Outdoorsmen!)
Queens, kid, the bag of money’s coming with me
Uptown connection, you fucking pussy
(Word up, man, It’s all marvel
Ya’ll niggas know everything is marvel)
Bronsonlini, Bronsolovski, Team Facelift
(Everything we drink, everything we smoke
Everything we buy, everything we sell
It’s all marvel!)

Paulie TRYBE, Paulie Walnuts

Buddy Guy,Dr. Lecter,2011,"Stoned on the stoop, got the box pumpin' Billy Joel
I'm Mickey Mantle while you motherfuckers semi-pro
Neck to colon how a slice from the machete go
Shoot your gun and throw confetti cause I'm ready ho!
Look in my eyes, you can tell that I'm a stand-up
Call me the teacher, wanna talk just put your hands up
We eat the lamb, duck, goose, beef or chicken
Two seater shiftin' with the smooth Cedar Strippin'
My facial hair is light red just like a ball of fire
Golden sound, blow the town, 'lo attire
Brown haze leather swampy like the Everglades
I'll switch a style so that I'm ready when the era change
First pressed virgin oil from the Greek Border
Spit the shit that have me laid up with the sheik's daughter
Three quarter on the Bally jacket to the knee
Lights flashin' when I'm rappin', tappin' tree
That smoke lingers son it shine through the curtain
Cracked pepper motherfucker I'mma grinder for certain
So never in your life come with scared business here
Fuck around never found bitch, disappear

Time after time I'm a winner
Seasoned in the barrel, harvest in the winter
Far from a beginner, keep an extra cartridge in the denim
Twisted off of Manischewitz, Harlem in a rental
The hash tanner than Connie, gorgeous
360 is the ways and the caesar's huggin' knotty flosses
Never stop until we hoppin out of grimey Porsches
One night shorty needin' over 9 abortions
I'm the whole shit, one you wanna roll with
When in canoe waving the ganja like a glow stick
Number one, numero uno with the flow shit
Your style is tired and limp just like an old dick
Bitch

Roman sculptures, all of my students hold a diploma
Stairs to the bath, garage door, behold the Lotus
Finest tuna right out the sea straight off the boat this
Hurricane rap spit tap low, rock a toga
Bronsonelli chef de cuisine I flex the two seam
Inject the vein with marijuana I'm a true fiend
Up-to-the-minute, all the weapons we invented
That's hidden inside the rented, the window tinted ten the percentage
Sacrificin' the lamb for the nutrition
""Criminology 101"" hard cover, newest edition
Nuclear fission is heavy weighty top the division
Lots of provisions collosal status stoppin' collisions
Too beaucoup, fresher than a lake trout
Barbecue the venison, pair it with a great stout
Peace I'm out kid, a motherfucker pace out
Every time I take that motherfuckin' weapon from my waist out",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-buddy-guy-lyrics
Beautiful Music,Dr. Lecter,2011,"I'm not your normal kind of rap singer
In the building where the subtle scent of crack linger
Fiends smoking off the foil
I only smoke shit from out the soil
Virgin oil, 
the name Bronson, no Arroyo
Barbecues get thrown with EBT Cards
Land and sea, the air, 3 stars
Till gold plates get made right on arrival
The Amarone got me spinning like a gyro
Take the high road, poppy seeds from Cairo
Aaron Rodgers style: I'm here to take the title
Rock a mask, dawg, 'cause every word is viral
To leave you like a wet noodle, paralyze your spinal
(Smoke this motherfucking weed real quick, hold on
I'mma get back to you in a minute)

""Darling, let me lay besi—
Darling, let me lay besi—
Darling let me lay beside you
Kiss my burning lips about you""

Dennis Byrd shit,
 china doll
Leave your fur split, dig your pockets
Then she'll kill your earth
Even if she's seven days away from giving birth
Ruthless, she'll catch you for your leather and your purse
Lamb roasting over wood-fire, extend the olive branch
Since the 90s I've been rocking hundred-dollar pants
Fifty-dollar drugs linger in my sock
Put the lighter to the plastic, that's the sealant for the top
'Cause we coming from the heights, you know I copped the puro
Tried to put it in the pussy, slid it in the culo
Damn, that's the wrong route
Now I gotta knee her in the stomach so it falls out
Take a deep breath
Ancient knowledge like the crocs up in the Nile
Alabaster tiles in the kitchen cause I'm wyling
Tryna cop a chain that say you styling
Only chain of interest in the water made of islands


Wild world that we living in
I smoke drug got the subtle hint a cinnamon
My mind twisted from the Absinthe
You can thank Flushing for my accent
So much more than rapping
You fucking with the captain
Action Jeter
Salmon on the cedar
You ain't do the job, and then they calling a reliever
Me, Dennis Eckersley
Rhyme flavor like my grandma's book of recipes
I'm 'bout that equity
Large stocks, a palm Glock, bomb box
Long beards, knee draped in sports drop
Loafer pressing on the pedal
Extra heavy doggie cause my leg is made of metal
Often tangle with the devil
Shapeshifter, shaking with strange hands
Bronsolini fresher than Maine clams
Making money every day, it's been the motherfucking game plan
Remain tan during the winter laid in beige sand",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-beautiful-music-lyrics
Chuck Person,Dr. Lecter,2011,"And when I find out who did it, it won't be quick and quiet like it was with you
It'll be loud and nasty. My kind of kill
And when his eyes go dead the hell I send him to will seem like heaven after what I've done to him

Yo
Time on my hands
Running fast like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Hit the Jackie Rob
Cop the Hershey
Spark the bark for the ride back to the Galaxy
Back, back, down, forward, kick
That's a fatality
For Liu Kang, turn to a dragon then a raven
Ain't no professor that can fuck with this verbatim
Your style is prenatal
I got the hand that rock the cradle
Fully auto mac under the table
Jewish platters, kreplach soups and sable
If you ain't stable, don't hang around cause I enable
Drug use, dick sucks from a fiend
Rib eye steaks that still on a bone
Me and my team shine
Like hologram fishscale right off the Greek coast
Toast to greats with bubbles
Three states, three cases, no traces
I'm the ace to shovels
So sick, muthafucka cover face with muzzles (Yeah!)
Flushing, Queens, twenty seven years strong
Where you think you're gonna run to when the tears gone
And reality set just like the sun do
Ain't trying to have my babies raised up in the slum, true!

C'mon, you son of a bitch
Damn, he's slick

No love for snitch niggas trying to serenade the precinct
Singing about granulated onions that ain't used for seasoning
My mind is off, this life gave me a different type of reasoning
I'm so New York that I could rep it from a different region
Slay heffers, Ottomanelli's got 'em in telly's
We eat good, Turkish cuisine, Ottoman belly's
We sit in whips and our whips sit on Pirelli's
While we're getting dick sucks, my whole team is Akinyele's
Put in their mouth, let 'em give 'em second chances
I'm known for finger banging bitches giving table dances
Open my flip book, see me posted in the sickest stances
Glorious garments, you could get some style by taking glances
Red snapper, taken apart, put back together
Plated on some bok choy, fine fish platters forever (Yo!)
Same routine, another day, a new endeavor
I usually rock a power piece under a Polo leather

I write left, think right, need the box tight
Mind blowing dome cause I always eat the box right
Make believers out of haters, haters out of homies
Bring my fam to the top so I ain't lonely
I'm with the team, cuisine like we celebrating
Contemplate the takeover when we delegating
Get it shaking like a dancer at Perfections
Catch us in a European coupe, it's never rented, kid
Been getting it, circle full of amateurs
See great rappers smoking seeded up cannabis
Fucking embarrassment, we cooler than a Vick's rub
You the type to trick it all night at a strip club
I'm the type to bag a stripper out front
Take her back, line a twenty up and get my shit sucked (Yeah!)
That's what you do when you flyer than Goldblum
Purple label loafers, paying homage to the old school

I'm from Brooklyn, the reason why I walk with a bop
Same reason I don't fuck with the cops
My borough is thorough, if any nigga try to tell me it's not
I'll leave his face bloodied up, all covered in knots
We break bread at the table with made niggas and sip wine
And graduate from little niggas, now we living big time
I'm in a state of mind like Nas in his prime
That real New York talk, home of gritty and grime
Check it, I got the cleanup, Bronsonelli's batting leadoff
Your mother's mouth is the place where I drop my seeds off
Hop in the Lamborghini, middle finger speed off
D's are getting P'd off, they're present, drop the weed off
I'm like a cross between Stoudemire and Carmelo
Half these New York whack rappers are soft as Jell-O
Since a little nigga, always been a fly fellow
Went from dark brown skin into a high yellow",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-chuck-person-lyrics
Suede,Dr. Lecter,2011,"Exhale the fucking essence, absorb me
Peace to Lonnie Londell
Everything is mar-vel
Kid, on this side we shine like the sun
Though the night brisk on the night shift
Peep the tight lips
Cause muthafucking loyalty is priceless
Fly bitch blow me harder than a vuvuzelo
My mood is mellow
Catch me hopping out the Cougar, yellow
Brew the Bustelo, Brosonlino
Smooth as Othello in convertible Z3's bruising the pedal
Chief of command, it's hard for you to try to see me
Your team ain't ready to win a war like Mussolini
Harsh as a Russian winter
Still we dining at Lupa right there on Bleecker and Thompson
Eating a custom dinner
Wine served, about a third of the glass filled
Premium rap skills, lounging in the Catskills
Let me end this with a kiss from my bitch
One love, Bronsonlino, signing off
Who better than this, kid?

Luxury sports apparel is what I rock to cover feet
I feel like everyday is Thanksgiving
That's how we usually eat
Rep the street, my flow is heat
Queens made me complete
When we outside deep
It's like a Double L retreat
You know my status, everything's mar-vel
Hard shell shots will tear you up
Now you scar well
Bizarre hell, I'll take you there
Never fear nothing, not me
Shellfish specialist, I'll eat it if it's from the sea
Action Bronson is in the building
So it smells like half a key
He's usually smoking marijuana in a jacket past his knee
Yeah, we live this, still crispest
Back to business, fuck bitches
Most of ya'll were living blind until I hit the light switches
Peace to my dress code and my way of life
Super trife, slay your wife
Ask about the way Lauren can lay the pipe
Never duplicated, wordplay is custom made
Niggas know my steez
Catch me in Queens covered in suede (word up!)

The fine fabric delegates
And Peter Pan Posse
This the finale, Youtube is where the fans watch me
High definition, Lo religion
Loving Scottie Pippen's
Switched it from Jordan Dream Team
It hurt the slutty women
Love to collab, I used to dabble in a couple of things
Facelift the Team, Outdoors, where the Mens will be
Cop Killer Queens, the Upper East, we need a gallery
We unscripted, real drama, never no fallacies
I might party like a rock star for a couple of days
A couple strays tag along taking bumps of K
I keep a Buddha, little liquor, make me triple stack
Ideal wifey, small titties and a lot of ass
They call me Shaz, before it was my government
Unholy convenant, could never get enough of it

So pay attention when this rich bong's broken in half
And don't get left behind to choke on my gas
Ginger ale, juggle, Gen Pop, pockets intact
Prime king in the booth
I got it like that
But wait, audible react
Don't get caught in the trap
Real recognize real
And see it's part of the act
I break hearts, surround sound
With the sermon I spit
And leave behind a trail of permanent drips
In a room full of douchebags burning their lips
And bugging out about the right amount of water to mix
The freebase specialist, I dug him a ditch
Struggling with that addiction's a son of a bitch, fucko
I'll give you something to fix, get sober
You'll understand when you're older
The rap Al Bundy got the handicapped boner
Hot breath and the ice cold shoulder
So, give me room so my set can breathe
I'm from the Up East, plus I got connects in Queens
So how you want it?

Spread the wealth through fly poems

Keep it tight like close homies
And never known to flip like a Solid Gold Cody
Known to keep it scummy like a Sunday at Jones Beach
Known to keep it bummy like a Sunday at Centre Street
Known for having fun, blacking out, that's the motto

US Weekly with the centerfold

A thousand tapes sold

Her landing strip is red like hair that's on Tatanka
I'm steady diving in chocolate like Willy Wonka
I take a knee and shoot a duck in the air
Five minutes, I'm making stuffing filled with truffles and pears
I'm lapping ""Go,"" while you only move a couple of squares
But still take out some time to do some drugs in the stairs
""Freeze! Lay on your stomach,"" what the popo said
My team selling the patties, getting cocoa bread
Babylon, them have to catch me, burn up on the irie!
Never die, I'ma give it to you my way!
Yo, peace to the chicken spot, peace to patty spot
Peace to the types of spot that Veggie Castle dready spot
The dollar van, the Wallabe and Reggie spot
And if a coward wanna rump I give him seven shots

 I'm in the corner puffing Marley
Got the knife inside the boot, hoping they don't shoot
Cuz I don't want to hurt nobody, Ow

Ay, ya no wan' rump with the senior
Who lean like he mixed Jamaican rum and tequila
Trail a load of hoes from Kingston and Montego
Keep dick hard like Rottweiler Mandingo

Pass dutchie towards San Fransisco

Soak your body, cause its begging for a loving touch
Light the candle, and ima light another Dutch
Then we slip into a place that's only you & me
Put it deep, like the bottom of the bluest sea
You too young to be locked down, truancy
Always got ya hair down, rockin your jewelry

No more playing the sidelines (Yeah)

Albanian style: rock leathers in the sand
I’ll shoot my cousin for nothing: dominant man
Go visit fam with no problems - on some normal shit
Straight from Skopje, Macedonia, the floral lit

Watch it mix, turn white like the Duchess' daughter

Destination back of your throat - cup of soda
Uh. This is Bam Bam Bigelow

Figaro
My uniform Carhartt sweats and Gore-tex athletic horses on my chest and on my short sets
The Leslie Nielsen of the weed and the words
This is Action Bronsolinni, 33 and the 3rd, kid
Naked gun, the serial is scratched off
Armed like Rocket in his prime, blast off

On and on, push it through, we won
Never stop till the day we there
On and on, push it through, we won
Never stop till the day we there

Push your seat back. The Ricky Henderson of rap
Jets hat, underneath a little blubber lie the 6 pack
Summer time I cop the musket with the kick back
Then sit back, stand up, eyes low, hit that
This happens continuously throughout the night
Now my eyes are like diamonds, that’s looking blue-ish in the light
Like a prism, shooting out hope, honor, and optimism
Never stop it till we're coastal on the aqua mission
Reach my hand in the water and grab a tuna
Silhouette you see reflection of light, right off the Mezzaluna
That’s a half moon, wavy like my man’s fade
The European carry-all. Color: tan, suede
Handmade, hand blades, carve up your features, I’m a creature
Section 39 - I’m in the bleachers
Fiends get washed up like turtles on the beaches
It’s mating season make the verbal for your speakers

Still drinking vintage out the bottle with the cheese plate
The Derek Harper with the low Caesar, flow fever
More than likely digging in your ho's beaver
Drug smoke to my neck just like a turkey
Dough dirty, make your brother do a curtsy. no mercy, Van Buren cop Hershey
Square Tyson and I’m in the mountains eating rare bison
Clam chowder, you ain't fucking with this man-power

Better move on bitch, or else it's on, trick
I'm en fuego, I ain't even in my zone yet
I spit the shit to make your motherfuckin' dome sweat
Queens-bred, no Packer but a cheesehead
Fat ass, fucking pussy until she’s dead
Suede foot, looking like an Indian
Cuisine straight from the Caribbean
Long jackets, made from an amphibian
Bag of money, split with my committee and
Break it down, vision on the dollars
Dip in the impalas, chilling with my scholars

I am not illiterate
Not, not!
Not even a little bit!

Nothing, nothing like an idiot!

Call me John Bon Journo, hopping out the Volvo
Ratchet on the leg, dipping from the po-po!
Since a youth I've been labeled as a loco
I sell it but I never laced the nasal with the coco
Urban hippie, muffle with the green thumbs
Seven grams a purple to my neck'll leave my feet numb
Scoop a bitch, Portuguese sweet buns
Serve a dick like an elephant that's three tons
Her pussy whistle like my father out the window
Remind us that it's dinner time I’m lighting up the Indo
And when I go inside I think I might just play Nintendo
Call a Shortie from the heights have her play with my colembo
Uh, just let me catch my little breath an shit you won’t accept a kid
Cause your destiny is for deficit
Me, you see I spit like epileptic shit
That's two options; it's either you fear me or you respect the kid

Mind like Watson, Fluent in the nuance
Van Damme Bronson, Alligator shoe on
Spin kick to the dick I'm eating dim sum
Right up in the tea room
You don't want to rerun!
Moon struck, splatter your platoon up
Hard times, drugs out the balloon
Beauty like a butterfly, flying out cocoon
Urban love and central village right by the lagoon
Uh, that’s my grandfather, add a little cream of tartar
Make the grams harder
Now your Shortie hold me tighter than the dance partner
Pull the viper out my pants on her
Honey hit the tune I’ll let it dance on her

Fridge is filled with snapple
Southern coast of France
Tart fennel with the apple
The feet are purple cause I'm stepping on the grapes
Consensual the rape
I got the presence of the greats

We grip grains
Switch lanes
Been fucking since the fifth grade
I never rock the ring or necklace with a bitch name
A thick frame
Flawless victory my dick game
Is Mortal Kombat, 
you still a shorty shit stain
My drug, blood, beauty, origami cranes
Perfection like an Asian's math
Neat like an Irish drink
You know that Bronson like a swimmer cause I dive in pink
You sooner see me out in Africa with tiger mink
We make your father curtsy
Cut off his manhood
Come through in Beamers
Interior leather tan wood
The shoes are suede
Off the reservation - redfoot
These stripper bitches in my bed
They give me head good

Kick boxer, double impact
Kick it like a Van Damme foot

Above the law and hard to kill
G-g-guard your grill
Catch me hoppin' out the hard De Ville
Hammers are pointing my direction to the top
The loafers show off my ankle
Getting shifty in the drop
Kid, twist up the pot
Through my nostrils to the atmosphere
No middle man
You deal directly with the captain here

So motherfucker come on cause its

Here's a toast to the fact that I'm a man and I can stand alone;
And all my suits are made by hand in Rome
Ricotta stuff the cannellon'
I'm in the garden smoking roses;
Deliver like Malone, I'm talkin' Moses
Part the ocean
, spark the potion, diamonds in the rough
We shine 'em up, make a necklace, dive up in the muff
Then wash my dick, straight to breakfast, hop up in the truck
Got more flavor than some Dr. Pepper,
 hottest stepping struts!
And the streets paved with concrete
I'm known to smoke the same shit that makes the lawn green
Gaze at the moon right off the shore, dream—
But me no worry got a strong team
Just like my Knick's '94 team—we winnin' though!
Go 80 layers on the Baklava
That's hand made by my nana,
 peace to Antigona
The whole shkup,
 
Bill Clinton Boulevard
Since a youth Bronsolini known to put it on

Already mentioned with the people I respect up in the rap shit
Couple of months you probably see me with an actress
Getting my ass licked, while she driving never crashed it
Smoking on that shit, fantastic
A little breezy off the coast as the sun set
Gallop on beach on the horse cause we young vets
Limited edition, signature inscription
Certificate of authenticity, I'm on a mission
Queens representative, dismember your genitals
Now you got a pussy, fuckin with the general
Bas Rutten, I'm ass bootin', I'm past shootin'
Display fast movements,
 know that cash rules
Drug clothes and I ain't talking 'bout a bento box
Penetrate your mind, spice it with the mental lox
Fundamental Soundgarden verbal Black Hole
Son at the flicks getting sucked in the back row

Lungs filled, smokey like the pork shoulder
Lash out, one second in the fourth quarter
Triple penetrate,
 pussy meat I renovate
Fuck 'em like a dog and leave 'em twisted like my mental state
Off the deep end, snorkel in a river
I take it back to Walkman's and tape decks
In Great Neck, having great sex
I didn't even have a hair on my face yet!
My feet were always classic though
Pinky up, classy flow
If you know me, you know never to pass me blow
Straight shitting on these songs so the grass can grow
'Til we sitting in the garden, smoking
Listening to Marvin go
I treat the shit just like a title fight, you sparring
Sooner dip Ferrari, sexin models straight from Holland
Lamb encrusted fennel pollen

2nd Avenue, cruising in a beamer
Holding ninas, my feets are featured in a Fila shoe
Time to get mine, never see me standing in a breadline
Never bedtime cause I'm a headline
From here to Portugal, kick it like Ronaldo
Mustache like Geraldo
Let the money pile, ho
Yay high
I'm on fire like a gay guy
But pause that
Raw rap, break your thorax
Long, White dick inserted in your whore's back
I'm fucking hookers straight from Kazakhstan- Borat

I'm a Chameleon, yeah, huh uh
Chameleon?
Uh Huh!, yeah!
I'm talking about the beat goes on, yeah
And the beat goes on, yeah
And the beat goes on

I smell the ocean cause I'm near the coast
Queens breakfast
In the streets you could hear the toast pop
Probably over some butter
In a penthouse, but I rose from the gutter
Where's my money?
Cut a finger, send it home to your mother
Bring your visors back
Skin fades, beards with Giambi lenses
Big Walkmans, yellow ones, the Sports shit
Bow to my portrait
Thousands of horses
That laid under the hood that's in the back of the Porsche
War stories from my people that survived 'em
Bitches sucking dick that's on arrival
Paralyze your spinal cord
For smoking drugs, I'm on the honor roll
Don't get arrested
Stuffed the rest in her punana hole
This shit is wunderbar
Hard top, 740 German
'94, copping soccer cleats out of Herman's
Laying in the grass
Out the basket, eating grapes
Shorty throwing signs that she wet below the waist
Swinging like beyond wall, geishas in the corner
Bronson like a spy, giving facials in the sauna
Snap my fingers, waiters come
Smoking with the lazy lung
Every kind of drug is on deck like a Navy gun
War stance, one call will make a broad dance
And then the pussy coming right up out your whore's pants
No romance, it's straight brutal
Body sumo, biting bitches like I'm Cujo
The lane switcher, the grain gripper
The soft, leather seat sitter
Head while I'm on the shitter

Primobolan in my hemoglobin,

Rocking all white silk, shorts just stop at the knee
Stay saucy like a pasta, with the broccoli, who's stopping me?
You gotta be out of your mind, I'm an anomaly
Salt and pepper beard, distinguished look just like I'm Connery
Escape the rocks, see me rollin' through the furnace
If I make it to the top, it's cause this motherfucker earned it
Well since I'm high, straight polenta from the pot
On some bad lieutenant shit, show me how you suck a cock
Hoppin' out the 97 Cadillac d'Elegance
Pocket full of Mozza,
 catch me fucking with some lesbians

Man fuck that Bronson, don't even say something to these faggots, you already know what time it is, we fuck around and fuck their fathers, up

I love chocolate just like Colagaro,
 
from Flushing out to Kosovo
My family pedigree picnics with Berettas
Filas on the slippers, windbreaker pants and sweaters
Very clever, ancient blood line gettin' cheddar
Cobblestone the streets, shifting manual in Benzes
Neighbor with the hoxha, him and all his shit offends
So we gather up the lamb, he sacrifice it properly
Stuff and twist with cabbage leaves, smoke exotically
Control the whip with one hand, listen to Hendrix
Loaded 45 chrome, tucked by the appendix
Every sentence like the Machu Picchu descendants
When I rhyme, I'm always on time, perfect attendance
I'm living splendid, blowing sticky in a rented
The olive oil virgin, first press, it's never blended, kid
I'm straight raw like Carpaccio
I'm just a heartthrob straight off the screen, just like DiCaprio

Fuck your feedback, respect the moustache
You're like a 40 dolla holla from Guadalajara
Respect the moustache
Motherfuckers ain't promised tomorrow

Roll the drugs just like I'm Morimoto,
 hold my nuts in my hand
That's when I pose for photo, 
doggy I'm often dolo
Cause I'm an only child, plus I love the silence
Just me and my thoughts,
 one hand grip the hooptie wheel
Soon you'll see me in the Coupe Deville
Eating stupid veal, steady aimin', shoot to kill
Walk with a cane, but no I'm not a pimp
P-P-Pinkie in the air, martini glasses full of shrimp, pussy

Yeah, straight fuckin' fly shit, shout out to my men Statik Selektah, Action Bronson, and shout out to your moms man, that made me the fuckin' man I am today. And a real fuckin' shout out to P.O.

I'm chilling in the park with several warrants on the bench
Suspended license, Over four years, that's three cars after
Cause I'm like a mush, everything is a disaster
Put 'em in the bathroom, cause that'll be the answer
Let 'em know I'm sick and every flow is like a cancer
Catch a rooster, cut his fucking nuts off
Serve 'em for a hundred dollars, sesame and plum sauce
Try to dip the bill, the Mexicans'll let the guns off
Or cut you with a pleasure similar to getting nuts off
Your whore told me that your putz soft
Plus she caught you in the basement with a tranny getting sucked off
Wheres your morals? Your genitals are floral
Like it in the back just like a fucking epidural
Me, I'm like a caveman, raised from out the mountains
Oriental bathhouses, laying on the couches
Cop a rub-and-tug until I'm spraying like a fountain
Take a hundred out my pocket, lay it on the counter
Peace, arrivederci, bouncing towards the exit
Asian lady crying because I left her fucking legs split
Dookie blunt of regs 'til I'm pookie in the face
Queens, the kid's a star like a Mookie on the base
The flows water, like rafting on the Congo
Take a hit of drugs and I'm passing like I'm Rondo
Motherfuckers sweeter than when Omar kisses 'Naldo
Get it straight sick, so I simmer up the caldo, de pollo

In the moonlight, with my Nubian queen

Cause we eating like some animals to say the least
Bronsolin' bust a nut right in your favorite niece
Smoke in my lungs when I'm driving on the FDR
Steering with my knees, and I'm rolling, almost wrecked the car
Squatting twelve plates, all I do is set the bar
Call your father, your a doula coulda stacked the bar
Making dough, baking bread just like the French
Hustle until we're living right, sleeping on the benches
Swinging for the fences, helicopter chauffeur
Cyclops catch you with the lasers and the lenses
Arnold Palmer on the graphic in the beverage
Everything I do myself, I'm using that for leverage
About to rape the game 'til this motherfucker hemorrhage
Moat around the crib and garages full of Benzes

First time I saw that ass, boo, it swallowed up my heart, damn
Plus you were gorgeous, I played it cool though
Slipped me the number told me utilize it
Only thing I thought about was your pussy, how I'ma brutalize it
Size six in the sneakers, smoking reefer
Was the daily routine, gave her call one day
Told me meet you up at forty deuce, I didn't hesitate to say 'yes'
Threw on the sweatsuit, hopped in the Beamer
Top down, twenty below, 
she gave me butterflies
Had her father light complexion and her mother's eyes
Thunder thighs, I'm trying to make some babies with her
We grew closer, connected at the hip
She started flipping over little shit
Became a bigger problem, and she pregnant, what I'ma do?
I went the coward route---what a fucking jerk
I hated myself for years and thought I made up
All the pent up anger in a while, and tell me straight up
Do you love me? Then what's the next step?
It's either 'yes' or 'no' before you take your next breath
Remember the days you held me on your chest?
I listened to your heart, gentle kisses on your breast
You said I was your king, or was it just a show?
But we don't even talk, so I guess I'll never know
How does a love so strong just fall to pieces?
I believe in science and she believe in Jesus

As I sit here and smoke this fucking drugs to the neck
Just be pondering on that shit man
Expands the mind
Yeah
Yo

I free my mind, want to travel in time
To a place where the world moves slowly, I'm feeling lonely
No one to hold me, no one to console me
My drug use out of control, I hit the road
Leaving behind all the memories of yore
Not of drinking, but it had me sipping Hennessey for sure
My daily thoughts are 'what's the penalty for raw?'
When I should be making money singing records on a tour
But I'm stuck in a room, living with mommy
Telling bitches not to scream so loud, serving salami
I won't stop until I'm laying in Ferrari
Long removed from the days of playing Sega and Atari
Failure's not an option, success is imminent
Not trying to have my baby raised up in the tenement
Take a hit of haze, the vision right in front of you
Hard work 'til I'm set like the sun'll do

This green plant has infested my mind
Over years I've invested my time, not to mention paper
Now I'm looking for a comeback, a gamebreaker
Stomp the ground, do a dance--the rainmaker

So now I'm smoking, and I'm stuck in a daze
Hear the music of the waves, silent stuck in a cave
Searching for daylight, I promise that I'll change
Before I see the grave, never that--fingers crossed
Every day it seems I'm talking to the wall more
Hallucinations, bugging, digging up the floorboards
Set me free to a life without anxiety
Every day I'm moving further from sobriety
No one helped me when my life was in a spiral
Now I'm something like a pyro, I'm on fire
'Lo attire, 
choking victims with a short wire
Situations for the money cause the dough dire
Kids are hungry and they need an education
But mommy needs a leather jacket, 47 bracelets
Facelift, don't forget about the basics
Don't ever trust a fucking fake bitch
Understand me?

Her face is weathered like the rain that fall in April
And in her pants she got a loaf of bread
You know the yeast she never go to bed
She rather dope or head
I just don't get it cause Mercedes was a honey
All the ballers wanna fuck her buy her mink and give her money
Her facials disappearin' and her nose is always runny

Pudzianowski, known to let the guns loose
Everybody smoking cigarettes in jump suits
Kosovo to the basement of your building
Terrible dentistry, gold in every filling
Cut ‘em a deal bet they let you bring the crills in(?)
No English, kill mad kitchen knives concealed in
The staircase is where we earn the degree
The lawsuits on the fine flesh feeding the fiend
Light Caesar-covered skull
Eyes are like the ocean blue
Stay fly, rock outfits that’s emotional
Nice shirt, crazy hat, mean jacket
Orange drugs if you’re reppin’ for the team clappin’
With the capillaries, big gun, Tackleberry
Tell the preacher at the chapel get the casket ready
Two seven’s hit the third one on the river
Chicken liver dinner have your Jewish mother sitting shiva
‘Cause the kid was a putz
Hit the clutch, spin the tires ‘til they smoke disappear into the dust, uh
Dive in the muff break the pussy like an Asian cookie
You the type to shave your face to make your anus bushy
Tie a knot in your shirt right by your stomach
You make me wanna vomit, steady getting blunted
The diesel sweet and sour, the blunt vanilla
Twist it to perfection, gentle hands, still a guerrilla
I’m at the villa, ’97 D’elegance
The Pelican Brief, you rapping with irrelevance
Hard to kill, call me Mason Storm
Your basic elevate my skills to the type of shit that Gracie’s on
Omaplata, guard your nose, Haloti Ngata
Total knocker, seldom sipping Stoli Vodka
Making maneuvers for myself out on a late night
The year been great right? Trying to get the plate right
‘Cause I’m a hunter like a great white
And a performer, never stage fright
I’m outta Flushing, Queens
Shoot your gun if you love the smell of money
Love the taste of good weed, vintage in your tummy
Love a bitch with good puss diggin’ in her bunny
Peace to gettin’ money, peace to gettin’ money
Yeah, Flushing, Queens. Outdoorsmen shit
Yeah, Action Statik Selektah shit

Keep Off the Grass,Well Done,2011,"All these faking motherfuckers never true to they craft
My style it give you boost just like a shoe to that ass
Smoke the drug, got the the Krug and in the glass
Nice socks, switch foot, Asian hooker and she fluent in math
James Brown shoes, the H-town groove
Big body slide through it like the Greyhound move
Ain't no rocking me to sleep, baby, you ain't that smooth
You want a sucker and I ain't that dude
I'm 'bout the money
Know when you hear me always hit you with the raw rhythm
You look confused and out of focus; autism
Ain't no developmental problems on this, I kid
Just big whips and chicks with big lips and thick thighs
My people flip pies, and quick to flick knives
Take the laziest shorty and take a quick dive
Paint a struggle how my motherfucking clique rides
Quit babysitting hit this spliff before the shit dies
Bitch


I'm looking crispy like a chicken cutlet
One wish is, get rich before I kick the bucket
Know that Bronson's eating supper
Hoping the gun don't jam like Smuckers
Weed inside the Mason jar, leaning like racing car
Papa Shango, the monster in your mother's bed
Blunt of regs, and some lead turn the gutter red
740 AC Schnitzer, with butter left
11 dollars worth of bounty on your brothers head
You know the scent YSL and some good smoke
I'm on the top she on the bottom like footnote
Jet hat cover my head
New Yorker born and raised, so I'm repping 'til I'm dead
Galaxy of Queens most diverse in the world
Live in my borough
Albanian father ran into my Jewish mother
Swept her feet probably laid her on the blueish cover

The Stick Up,Well Done,2011,"The tangible goods, that's all I'm interested in
Bronsolini and I'm better than the best of them
With the power invested in me, '93 on the vest with the ski
The watch spin perpetually, time for compensation
Babies need shoes, Bronson keep pounds of weed only three brews
Long jackets, curly hair like I'm Hebrew
Fabric with the green ink had been the root of evil
Gotta get it on the late night, sun rise
Ain't never trynna see the look of sorrow in my son's eyes
What about a refill of the ganja when the blunt dies
New Yorker Mangold see me playing on the front lines
Two sixty, five-eight, the beard gumbo
Three pointers in the park for a clean hundo
Cream Caddies, hookers in the back of it
Spectacular shit, the resume immaculate

Better have my money
Quit the bullshit, it's a stick up
Better have my money
Quit the bullshit, it's a stick up

Yo, vicious chowder
Asian bitches sniffin' powder
Bronsolene catch me creepin' at the sicko hour
992 is scripted on the balance
Got talent, but all we really love is valence
Laid in the palace like a sultan
Polo on my back cover the Carhartt king
And that's for certain, hung like a curtain
Pussies get the drapes
Motherfucker know you in the Planet of the Apes shit
Dusty bottles from a cellar in a foreign land
Dr. Lecter, digging in your sister's rectum
Sweetbreads and capers, Martusciello to evade the danger
But I really wanna taste the paper
Golden bars from the treasury, spit cleverly
I'll leave it neverly, lappin' in the Beverly

Ayo Queens get the money
Ain't trying to see central booking, Oh shit
Dough boy in New York City
New York is still the same
Out there on the Queens Ave

Playing the mirrors like a diva cause I'm paranoid
And plus I'm smoking drugs, you're just a token thug
Fuck around your words will lay you in a woven rug
I'm Middle Eastern, Iron Sheik with the cobra clutch
We see the lights so I force them into chasing me
Early morning money like the people in the bakery
Fancy drapery, rep the family faithfully
Criminal minded, do it tastefully
Shorty catching cases, couple priors open
Serve fiends same shit Richard Pryor smokin'
My speech be concrete lying, defeat a web
And even if you were a basket couldn't see the bread
We want the Caesar salad table-side
The waiter toss it get the flavor right
The shorty with me got the piercing in the naval
Seven bitches with me and I'm 'bout to give 'em anal
Yes I love my freedom cause I'm able


Coming from Queens we get fly on different calibers
Heinous with the stainless, plus we Shameless like the Gallaghers
Black, e-b-i-t so we ain't looking at no calendars
Gliding like Islanders
Pistols equipped with silencers
Load 'em, point 'em at challengers, be triple beam balancers
I'm feeling claustrophobic with success surrounding us
And fuck a groupie cause we been have bitches hounding us
Way before this thing called rap came into play
I change my rugbys and the pussy I fuck like every day
Sex, money and yay, sip the Henessey for energy
We giants, dropping science, if you're smart pick up the chemistry
Repping for New York heavily, getting my money steadily
Meyhem Lauren and Bronsolinyo that's the recipe
Dun, it's destined we won, my legacy spun
A lot of people in the right direction, despite aggression
Divine prevention bag ounces by eye with perfection


They tried to bag me for the blunt, I had the bundle by the grundle
I'm running on the humble, acrobatic tumble
Oh shit, the floor exercise a perfect ten
Marisol, we make her swallow drugs then she birthing twins
Then fly no propeller, street bread my a capella
Vintage raps from out the cellar, Madagascar vanilla
Where color kicks match your buy work
And then we batch it
From Queens I was just in my teens, holdin' the ratchet
I slice the garlic with the razor, somewhere out in Asia
When it come to paper, family, everything is major
The North American elk behind the oven door
We're trying to find a common ground, is it love or war?
Remain extravagant we known to floss objects inanimate
Shining but never arrogant, from 40 Park to Feroget
Rocking the finest ??? designers ???

Queens, New York
Flushing shit
(We backkkk againnnnn)
That's right
Yo
Sour smoke out the nasal
The Pad Thai noodle topped off with basil
Sistine Chapel rapper, I'm here to blaze you
Pop off material, get laid up n sprayed up just like arterial
Clementine nine, dripping venereal
Linguine linguistics that left my verbal lesson saucy
Send a message, leave you sleeping next to headless horsey
Play the plaintiff, I'mma slide off to prior engagements
Let you die in the basement/Toast wine from the time of the ancient-
Turkish warriors,
 
cobblestones in Macedonia
Albanians in Shkup...never living by the book
We fill the jails in France, Uzes and Italy
Never do dirt on our own land
That shit's forbidden, G
Hoxha singing from the top of the Xhamia
Pickled peppers at the picnic table
Feta cheese, perfect Flia
Straight outta Dukagjin
One of the illest places
No one's smiling
There's only drunken men with killer faces

I'm known for simmering the mean gravy
Gleam crazy, my mind's hazy
New York made me
The most official, to holster pistol
Trim the fat, scrape the gristle
Meyhem Lauren will make your family miss you
I'll gladly press the trigger button
If you press an issue
Whether it's beef or beats
I try to make a casket fit you
We'll fuck you up then fuck you up
And then come back to get you
And do that two more times
We call that shit a triple triple
My flow is typhoon rap, it's deeper than an ocean ripple
Our hollow tips will hit you
Leave you with an altered nipple
Slumped over saying ""Lord, please have mercy""
Or play the G, now we made hot flames burst me
Queens veteran, dressed like tennis men
Back block medicine, slap chop venison
Knock, knock, let us in
My whole clique's equipped to shoot though
My army got more fucking arms than a can of pulpo

Brownsville's Jesus, white and blue Adidas
Got more knowledge than them Poor Righteous Teachers
Clarence Smith, Stan Smith, 13X's
Some will overstand but common men never receive the message
Concepts like I'm Frank Butcher
Neighborhood pusher, 62's through ya sub woofer
Unca nunca for the pitbulls with red noses
Wet bogies dipped in shit to stop bodies from decomposing
Cool, calm and collected
Keep my composure
All my business in black and white like negative exposures
Keep a Polaroid for the posers
A picture's worth a thousand words
So lock and load up
You don't know me from a hole in a commode, bruh
I am the shit, just ask your bitch
I bet she know, yup
It's St. Maffew
Truffles in that duffle
Princess in the catsuit

This is dope fiend rap
Have a nigga leaning sideways
Frankie Blue Eye shit
I do it my way
Legendary, scary, February Valentine murder
Ike Turner, gun butt with a nice burner
Bluey spot guzzler
Long Island Tea sipper
Mind of a killer
Trenchcoat Mafia nigga
Hollow point slinger
Smile while I'm flipping fingers
Angels and demons
Mellowed out, Stylistic singer
Corner store postup
Backstreet wanderer
Butter your toast up
Tight pussy conqueror
Smart aleck, talk back, type of nigga
Fuck you
Disrespect your mother, your brother
Father and son, too (everybody!)
Long live the music cause it's part of my blood
But how long can I stay breathing
Only God is my judge

Glammer, glitters and gold
Every legend repping my era
Carries part of my soul

Old Gold twisted like the cap that's on the bottle
Mash on the throttle, swish, shoot expose the ankle
Swiss chocolate lay up in the bed like a blanket
Ready to smang it, smash it and bang it
No more fruit punch in the crib so I guess I'll have to Tang it
Young Bronson, blade runner, Rutger Hauer
Sticky fingers cause that's what I use to crush the sour
Suede shoe like the natives in the teepee
22's drop Z3, get off the peepee

Blow a kiss to my dick, wash my body with the sponge
Feed me Fla-vor-ices, put the chronic in my lungs
Tailor me a leather suit, on some Jodeci shit
Bi-coastal man, we both will﻿ be rich

Leave the party with your daughter (little Debra)
In the morning do karate in the water
Hear sounds of samurais
Rockin shorts in the winter don’t fuck with splinters (rats)
Roll with sinners — A bunch of winners, catered lunch and dinners
Why my drug jar look so empty?
Drop a hook and then I’ll probably cop an M3
Long knife ('chete), that’s in the event
Somebody try to get me then to Heaven they’ll be sent
Oh, off the strength, caviar and Porsche taste
All the beans are gettin' Boston baked
On thin ice, I skate across the lake
With the CCM tacks, my feet are like Cassius
Smoke premium cabbage

Blow a kiss to my dick, wash my body with the sponge
Feed me Fla-vor-ices, put the chronic in my lungs
Tailor me a leather suit, on some Jodeci shit
Bi-coastal man, we both will﻿ be rich

Yo we 80,000 shopping malls but we ain't browsin'
Poppin' hood in Transco Towers
Prowler prowling Gucci towels and bathroom vials
Nouns, owls, Aston Martins
Sparkin' one in valet parkin', loan sharkin'
Hopin' that my days-don’t-get-darkened
Cheetah skin outside the parka
Propaganda propels us – ostrich feathers

Surgical procedures
Ben Johnson
You already know

Sign my name with the feather
, tap dance under the full moon
Smoke and drinking liquor for the fam that left us too soon
Just keep it truckin'
, searching all the nooks and crannies
No english muffin, streets are filled with crooks and trannies
Bam bam got a shooter like Lagassee
Emerald green paper that I split up with my posse
One hand driving, 3 gram smoking
2 fiend sucking, tea bag soaking
Strength of a retard the drugs are even stronger
Shorty loved the longitude, 
dealer bring a quarter through
Over fishing make the snapper less affordable
I hate when stupid bitches ask me questions that's rhetorical
Like ""do you want to have sex?"", well bitch, it's obvious
Her name was Jeta
 from the former Yugoslavia
She grew a bush like a baby plant
Still I ate it, just think of it as bucatin' and razor clams
Smuggle cheeses in a baby bag
And then I serve at a private tasting
I got no time for wasting
Just dick is placed in the slit no type of conversation
And prime rib from LaFrieda carved at the blablablabla
Fuck, fucked my last word up cause I don't give a shit man
I meant to say prime rib carved at the fucking carving station but yo

Yo my mind is locked up, my conscious rocked up
In an alley with a fiend getting his cock sucked
Plus she wearing a wedding dress a special day
She said she finally met a… Fuck
Yo, my mind is locked up, my conscious rocked up
In an alley with a fiend getting his cock sucked
And she wearing a wedding dress, a special day
She said she finally met a man to take her breath away
Well naturally I'm jealous, because I'm lonely
At times my only friends in life are drugs and the cannoli
My dad was right I shoulda listened when he told me
A walking contradiction wounds inflicted on me solely
Pain within running deeper than the ocean floor
Ocean-Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh yo
Pain within running deeper than the ocean floor
Ocean avenue, the family straight from Kosovo
That was years ago mum look how your son has bloomed
I hum a tune and then I'm hotter than the sun in June
And I'm just living my life but feel I'm drifting
Demons on the doorstep, lungs that feel constricted
Or maybe I should see a shrink and get prescripted
Or take the hand of God but shit I think i'll keep my distance
I think I'm frightened and I didn't even know it
But yo, that was a thought and I'm subconsciously a poet
It's perfect timing and I hope that I don't blow it
I pop the bottle of the moet, yo here's to me


Late nights I'm trying to stay up out of the orange skips
Great white sharks
, the .38 with tarnished tip
27 years I never met an honest bitch
Slice their faces like Kitana and shit
Through my nasal blow the smoke
Basil on the boat
Hookers on the half shell, hundred dollar pants
Wind breaker jacket flapping like a falcon from a westward wind

We never ride Civics, the Mont Blanc scripted lyrics
It's like avant garde to the critics

Bitch, please, picture me in Sicily
The hard bottoms gators is slippery
I just had an epiphany
And now I'm shittin' on your whole steez ridiculously
45. fire at ya attire, to break your armor up like fine china
Fly designer hoes diggin for gold like a 49er

Bank robbers, bang 38's to taste cobbler

Skin would glisten like reflections off the blueish Jag
She had a Jewish dad, and a Jamaican maid
Started hanging with strippers and dropping the zippers
And selling the pussy for paper to play
Crusty feet like she hiking for days and live in the mountains
At the park she piss in the fountain, shit on the Michigan towel
She quick to split up an owl
She loves some dick in her bowels
Dabble in crystal, polish the pistol, powder her sniffles with flour
Straight flieshman
In the private part of her pussy pocket
Randomly pussy farting
Sold at the hookers auction
Left as a crooked orphan
Wrapped in the sports section
Box score, fake black rubber cock in the top drawer, what

Make this fucking bitch sit in vinegar
Apple cider baths
Sit in the vinegar

PS

Yo, so many unfamiliar faces that have come and gone
You're a constant, fucked you in the school closet
We were young then, experimental periods
Laid a towel cause I fucked you on your period
Stole my mothers car crashed it by the Burger King
Young love, but we thought it was eternity
Raw sex – never thought about paternity
But now this cunt is trying to murder me
Abusing me physically and verbally
Said my dick was too small
I went and got the surgery, just to show it off
This ain't real shit, baby, I'm just going off
Clear the mind, fuck it, so I wrote a song
Night life, I'm destined for the bright lights
Knife fights at the bar with some white dykes
She hold me down, break a bottle on the bitch head
.25 out the pussy and it spits lead
We always end up in a situation
She throwing diapers out the window at me
Called the cops said I beat her face
Beat the case, now I shiver at a sweet embrace

I rap now, bitches sucking like a vacuum
On the bed, stay bent like a smack spoon
Bubble butt thicker than the double dutch
In the van, leave her tied up in bumblefuck

Cold, tired and I mean it
I thought we'd grow to old farts in Phoenix
Well now you see me 'lo scarves and a ski knit
But I've been here since the beginning, like a prefix
But I'mma to do what I gotta do
Trying to make this french dough like a Pâte à Choux
Over your head, after sex shorty hold me in bed
Smoking Ethiopian red
The son rose, a single teardrop fallopians bled
Nowadays you catch the hooker sniffing coke in the shed
It's a damn shame I'm just chilling eating lamb brain

Nobody high as me
Green Timbs, in Vegas I'm like Steve Wynn
At the same time, fellatio from three twins
Those are triplets; I've been wilding since the Rabbi snipped it
Then they laughed, and ate brisket, fuck!

Had little daddy hide the heater in the restroom
Guns drawn like my bath by my lady friend
Mesothelioma money: drop Mercedes-Benz
And I ain't never left, you know I'm still here

Bite a bitch like George Whipple in the stair case
Long as she got big nipples and a tan face

I'm burning bitches from the TV like a CD
I'm trynna live the life in 3D
So you could nibble on my pee-pee
We out in Fiji

From having money on my mind to having money in my pocket
Bone marrow roasted
Spread it on the rosemary bread, lightly toasted
Drizzle with the vinaigrette
Stuffed Dutches and it's pulling like a cigarette

Leather jacket, knee length
Peace to people getting money in the 80's with the freebase
First time, you get a free taste
That's the start of a career chase, I'm eating cheese plate
Skirt steak shaved straight up off the diaphragm
Muay Thai title fights out in Thailand
I spit the fly shit, accompanied by fly bank

Dos en el morning, rocking sweatpants ya know what up
Slowly approaching animals in motion
Pussy safari, twenty for a lay
Ten for a BJ, but free for some free base
Before I purchase, I wanna peek at the turkey
Make sure that its perky so it won’t turn my dick to jerky
Open the door, soon as she sat down, she took a bump
She caught the rush, then made a hooker grunt
Let’s talk about me, I’m always on the road
Got a little dick, many of the secrets I behold
Name is dano born in the Bronx, half Puerto Rican
Drive a truck hooked on dope cook a soul

'Cause we're coming from Queens, every platter is Zagat rated
Caramelized up, 
bulls are getting castrated
Hold up hold up someone pass the weed to me
Fuck a routine I'm switching up the scenery
Boats with decks strictly using throats for sex
Yoga stretch, open pussy like a sofa bed
Key lime spear fishing off the Yucatan
Grab a barracuda higher than a parachuter
Pair of shooters: Anthony and Harper
Caciocavalli dog, I'm sharper than the archer
I'm an artisan down for bi-partisan
'Cause everyone getting paid, see me with the freshest fade
Charles Oakley,
 gecko belts and durangos
I fuck good and make big seeds like a mango
NFL ready, sculpted for the clay court
Simple spaghetti shifting in the gray sport
Suck my dick bitch real good
Mother fuck a kid, Action Bronsolino suck my balls

No disrespect ma, I'm tryna eat the pussy
Lift your legs over you head so I can taste the tushy
King Thrust is what they call me at the hooker house
260 pounds of pressure right in a hookers mouth
5'7"" with the ass of of a horse
Put it in from behind its the salad I toss
She ride me like a maniac
Best believe the bitch a brainiac
She known to keep a fresh shaven cat
Milk chocolate and her eyes like the sun
Keep a loaded 22 inside her thighs and her buns
Her pussy lips are tight just like the box of a nun
She'll have a fiend itchy and scratchy for rock in the slums
Boosting in the boostiere
I give my favorite Goose away just to get a closer look at how the juices spray
Fucking tired can't go no more
My raps are marinated days ahead
Jalapeno cream cheese on the raisin bread
That's for breakfast
I've got a death wish
 you never catch Bronsolino in a necklace
I'm on the block like tetris
Caddy green Northstar engine
Pecan pie seats Lord I'm a legend

Early nineties Tom Selleck with the moustache
Your eyes are blind to the diamond in the rough

West Palm Beach betting on a dog race
Bitch with me big titties and a small waist
Pistol noise, shiftin' in a Hitler toy
Kick shit, young Ruud van Nistelrooy
Eating brisket, chilling at the bris
Knuckles like I punch walls metal in the fist
Smoking seven kinds of pepper and shit
Veteran shit, give Melissa Etheridge a dick
Stroke pussy like a cat lover
My kids are mixed that means they got a black Mother
And their Father's a G
Strictly Oolong on the tea, the shirt straight from '93, man with the ski
Peace to lo-lives Brooklyn, smart crew Queens
Sharp tooth fiends in the chartreuse jeans
Old Girbaud shit, pockets in the front
Waist 33, odd sizes out of Marshalls

Rockaway smelling like Georgi
Ready for orgies, slightly retarded
Breading the porgy

Keep the Dodge, I want the '87 Saab in gray

Stuff a shorty like the man a gut
Light tan on the shoe like banana nut
Strong odor off the weed like your grandma's butt
No attempt to disrespect, but my grandma blunt

From the farm right to the table
Aired straight right to the plate I doubt you could relate
Figs at the peak of their ripeness
Money off this music, motherfucker I like this

Scent of garbage make me sick, getting head in the rental
Got the lamb rack, pan-roasted, laced it with fennel
Little yogurt that been drizzled over might be a winner
Come and see me, Nona hand-makes the fettucini
Halla makes the baklava - getting paper kahskaval
Lahmacun Salad-smoking savage out of Sarasota

Shorts, that's my steez when I'm stepping
Strolling down the streets like the westerns

Spinning like a wild maneuver, wilding at the ho down
Hold ground, stand firm, you little sissies got a chance
Now it's time to give a man burn

Guaranteed you're gonna lose just like the Brooklyn brawler
Mister Wonderful in short-sets, Cortex
Gore-tex the bottom of the feet in case the floor wet
Floral scented, hand-crafted on the mother earth
Kinda strange, things been funny since my brother's birth
Shaking hands as if the money connect
Blow a ransom on the yacht, have a seed in Quebec
Respect my exquisite mystique, pretty petite

Far from elementary but we do this for the children

Made a deal with Lucifer, said, ""give me the universe"" (Every Single Planet)
It hurts kind of like losing your first love

Throwing hand grenades at paddywagons in passing
Old fashioned soul grabber snorting all the coke up

Listening to Lionel Richie, fuckin with the lights on
Rice on the table, have us going all night long (Again, and again, and again)
Rooftops, sippin on some red wine
Start to realize I've been trippin, shit its just fine

Rocking fabrics, sport the big beard like I’m Arabic

Throw it on the grill, I'm cooking in a suit
Same shit that's on the grill gave me leather for the boot
If they make me take the stand then I'm lying through my teeth though
Ask to swear to God but in that I don't believe though
My man Stevie Mo playing safety for Toledo
Hustle 'til my fingers staying cheesy like a cheeto
Shorty on the bed pleasuring my pee pee
Smart crew TCN, lyrical graffiti
Drug roll precise, like a hooker with the dice
Butcher with the knife, you get tooken for your life
So much to say it's so little time and shitty
Killer Queens the borough, New York be the city
Coming crazy out your mouth will get your split up like a philly
Running through the maze like I'm Willie, you gotta feel me

I’m moving forward cause nothing's gonna be the same
Eyes blurry from the smoke, I can't see the lane
Swerving heavy, bottle in my lap
I'm looking for a problem so I'm modeling the gat
Somebody save me, cause I don't wanna go to jail
I'd rather be up in the mansion for the polo sale
But I'm here, stuck inside my thoughts
I'm tryna have a bag of money stuffed inside my shorts

My life is like a movie, Blizzard with the shottie
Hookah house on Roosie chilling in the lobby
Yes I'm living gnarly, the 40 ounce of Barley
Open up cigars and fill 'em with a bunch of Marley
Double cut porterhouse straight from Luger's
Ruger for intruders hand to hand made by the duelers
Ginger ale in Knicks glasses, your style is piss mothafucka
Time to flip the mattress, kick it swift as Cassius
My mind is stronger than Mariusz Pudzianows
Obvious to see I'm a star straight off the couch
You rapping with a blouse, 
you get slapped up side the mouth
By the Zangief look-a-like,
 Bronson always cooking right
Spray the vinegar to tighten up a yummy
Smoking got me squinting like the sky is high and sunny
Attachment on the nozzle make the iron fire funny
Never stop until my body diving in a pile of money


I'm always smoking like a gunshot
You know the fuzzy light green, call it Dunlop,
 
flow nun's twat
Many hours, one man standing, one spot
From the morning to the mothafuckin' sun drop
Cause I'm one with the Earth, eyes red
Mothafucka I've been blunted since birth, age 9
Mom dukes kept the gun in the purse, next to the hair spray
Fuck tomorrow, money coming in the fast way",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-not-enough-words-lyrics

And If there’s anything left after that I’ll cop 
a six
How you think I got the art displayed on the dinner plates?
First course was from the Finger Lakes
Last course cinnamon ginger cake
She gave me head during the Laker game
I got her tatted, trying to erase her name
No, I caught her cheating, her pussy didn’t feel the same
She was probably with 
one of the Broncos
Or LeBron
 so I blew her car up
Soon as she try to start it up, nah
I can’t talk about that though…

My past life I was a Rabbi
Now I live the fast life
Drugs on standby in the circle by the campfire
Telling stories of yesteryear
Pull out the pocket mirror just to check my hair
Hit it with the comb again
The rap Dennis the Menace with Dennis Rodman's in Venice, inventive
She took a bump and started dancing like Elaine Benes
The big chain sway like I’m playing tennis
One man team, about to win the pennant
Now you can tell by my pendant that I’m protected
Direct descendent in the blue and orange Lexus 
watching ‘Se7en'
Land in 
Dublin
Pull me in the room and ask if its resin
I said no they sent me on my way with blessings

I trained a dolphin to let the slammer off like Dolph Lundgren

You’ll get your cow something
I’m rare like a fucking Asian playing hockey
My ocean view is due to Papi
Bitches call me Rodney
Bought my bitch a present hope I don’t spoil it
‘What is it baby?’
Face to face toilets
Toyota with the spoiler Ace of Base boiling
I play ball like Billy Hoyle
Now I need a Sidney Dean to help me start this brothel in the Philippines
I stay in Flushing like I’m Dillon Gee
You ain't gotta open up the comic book to figure who the villain be
It’s me doing perfect dives in the Sicilian sea
You know I like my bitch with a Brazilian V
Bumping Bobby Brown
Cry when I’m not around
She always hold it down pound under the seat
In that all white Jeep
Sleep, that’s if you wanna
I be schwitzing in the sauna

Come in the crib every night, and I kiss my daughter

Yeah...through the eyes of a G
Through the eyes of a G, see me in the all white Eclipse
A husband pay me 10 stacks to fuck his bitch
Hand up her ass like a Muppet baby, it's crazy
While she do a buck-eighty in a mustard Mercedes
I move the mustard from Russia to Haiti
Forty-fives will kiss your neck like the touch from a lady
Fuck with my lunch and then the pump leaves you under the daisies
You know your bitch is just another cocksucker with rabies
I'm signing autographs in Spanish, I live with Michael Jackson's anguish
Hop in the Vanquish and vanish off the manor in a strange manner
Aim the hammer at your dame's bladder, like it ain't matter
I smoke 'til I got down syndrome
Tan gators, brown linen
Multi-color money, seven different kinds of cheeses
My silhouette resembles Jesus in all seasons
Take a ginger shot, doing concentration curls with the cinderblocks
Doing squats, hope the ox don't drop out
Don't make me have to slap the fire out your pop's mouth
It's me...uh

A-B, utilize what you and I use to see
To move forward
Cause I get bored with niggas talking 'bout
Who they used to be, what they used to do
My homie headed to court, not for a 2-on-2
Ironically, I'll have you know we do it for the sport
Or at least to keep a little gold in this uniform
I'm abnormal like a unicorn that you could get on
Cows jump over moons when my nouns and verbs move
Etiquette of a veteran, still getting checks
You get a F for your efforts, we never trade techs
I tried to keep the peace but now I gotta keep the piece
I speak in synchronistic frequency with triggers squeezing
And one day I'll drop to my knee and repent to Jesus
'Til then I'm humping my lust demons for no reason

My dad was right when he said I was a deranged fuck

Saddam Hussein guns
Held by nuns who do drugs while beige hard bottoms slide on the new rug

Bench pressin' a fiend
Ain't shit changed still loitering

Ok, Ok
I'm relyin' on Viacom to keep my lights and fire on
Made a deal with Lucifer, said, ""give me the universe"" (Every Single Planet)
It hurts kind of like losing your first love
I saw the bright lights and started doing the worst drugs
Now, I'm backtracking and hash rappin' with Action
Throwing hand grenades at paddywagons in passing
Old fashioned soul grabber snorting all the coke up
The type of shit to turn a World War into a Polka
Polo'd up, the double RL icon
Steppin' out the limo, tuxedos made of python
Listening to Lionel Richie, fuckin with the lights on
Rice on the table, have us going all night long (Again, and again, and again)
Rooftops, sippin on some red wine
Start to realize I've been trippin, shit its just fine

If I look just like the mother fucking bodyguard
Baby hair curls on my forehead, leave your whore dead
Hop out that four times, four door and draw lead

And I need more head from some bitches straight from Morehead
State your business cause I'm busy tanning naked

Call my homie, tell him meet me down in Lido Beach for lunch
Plácido Polanco crib, his bitch was black
She started purring, I kissed the cat
Aristocrat, wrist dancing like a disco bass
In the holster, same shit color as Sisqo's hair
635 slammed like a suplex
Cheat off a Chinese kid just like a school test
I'm on the hunt for loot, jump out the chunky coupe
Hold on, wait till it thunder, here's the gun to shoot
Beige leather to the calf, where my math at?
You gonna babysit my joint? Then pussy pass that

I'm getting paper regardless, I'm never facing no charges
I got your honor under the armpit
The gavel slam and I walk
Hammer dances on the porch, downtown gallivanting with a horse
Two different drugs to choose, I need the third thing
Oriental style shirt
Flapping in the wind like a bird's wing
I need that good green, ugh, motherfucker need that good green

I got the face like a grown lion, my people hold iron
Predict the weather by the wind like an old Mayan
Hold my son up, show him to the kingdom
While all his blood brothers became drug runners in England
Made in Queens, Handball courts and 40s
Shorties smoking blunts, spades in the corner
We moving white like David Spade in the sauna
All the money chronological, it look like callaloo

Stare in the mirror I'm a changed man
Never, I'm just executing my game plan
Shit, I'm crunching numbers just like a rain man
And got the gray Lamb, interior was beige sand
I snap the button on the driving gloves
Pointy shoe like Aladdin on the flyin rug
I probably die from drugs or while I'm fucking
Fuck it, as long as she suck dick
You see me with a bitch like Vanna White at the benefit for battered wives
Lightly battered yam, a squeeze of lemon over lamb
Staring at the crescent while I'm laying on my back
Smokin' drug, you know the potent one
Put a half ounce of the crystal in the asshole of a shih tzu
Twist your bitch too, like Brazilian jujitsu
When I marry, cop a shower room that shits two
Sell your pussy if I called and had my chips, boo
It's Bam Bam and I'm feeling like my time is here, to take the world over
Sit A.C. Slater style on your girl's shoulder, then have a cold soda
If you ain't with me roll over

My mind marinate in drug sauce
The private driver's name is Gustaf
The cuff links is like a slut's cough
So disgusting, english muffin
With the butter at the Yiddish luncheon
With my pimpish cousin
He sport the slick-back clean
And I inquired howd he get that
Paused and said a bitch is a bitch
I twist the spliff while I sit in the six
The classic LO sweaters sit on the prince
Thumbs in the belt loop, as i pose for the pic
My boyish element, I blessed your residence with elegance
Turning entire rooms into elephants
Stepped in the building
The doorman resemble Marcus Garvey
Ferrari cake at the party
Wheeled in by Steve Harvey
He had the freshest line in the building
He stunted on mine, it was my party
And he tarnished my shine  got mad and had him escorted out
""Vincent, get 'im outta my sight""
And Missy Elliot had started a fight
Busta Rhymes was on a molly
From afar you thought it was Kane, but it was Body
Catch a chokeslam if you try to try me
Monday night catch me wilin' at the bingo house
Just left the dog show, you know I brought Ringo out
He won a ribbon, brandished it on the side of his coat
I went outside and I was offered a smoke, I declined politely
I rock the Jordan sole that's kinda icy
My drug of choice you know is kinda pricey

Mass from Ireland, give you a casket to lie up in
While an Asian man play the violin
He was taught from age 2, never miss a note
Brought his sister in the bathroom to shit the coke out
I cop the Audi with the poke out
700 thousand dollars at the smokehouse
Drugs in my lungs…ah, fuck

Fast money 'til we die, peep the resume
Hang-glide into the boat, get my cheddar notes
Keep the shotty in the leather coat
Motherfucker, better know
Fast money 'til we die, peep the resume
Hang-glide into the boat, get my cheddar notes
Keep the shotty in the leather coat
Motherfucker, better know

Many nights I shot dice in the drug den
My raps permeate from a thug's pen, and love when
I think about my purpose in life, keep soft mouths slurping precise
These bitches love us
We named Pit Bulls after hard liquor (Hennessy!)
Turn the knife in the wound, make it scar thicker
Shit, we still wear jean shorts
Veteran, playing these mean sports
What up Dab?
This ain't boom bap, homie it's doom rap
And your career shit couldn't compare with
Bronsoline and Laurenivici, write fly rhymes and sky dive from Mount Fiji
That's word to my parachute
Old money still flows, last chapter loot
Firearms and novelty beverages
Keep drama riddled with hemorrhages
We good though",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-jackson-and-travolta-lyrics
It’s Me,Blue Chips 2,2013,"Fucking wax man
What is this doing to us?

Heading towards a magical path
Rhyming over African jazz
Put the drug inside the crack of my ass
Do a squat then it falls out
Set it off, tell my whore, ""Wear the mall out
Cop whatever, put it on the mastercard
Come home so I can fuck you really fast and hard""
(Yo who the fuck you with?) Oh, I'm with that bastard Jon
In the Porsche and the seats are made of mastodon
He had an accident and now he got a plastic arm
Got paid, got his mom a nail salon
Got laid, he can choose 'em from a catalogue
Russian, Taiwanese, whatever
They say I'm looking Siamese in leather
Little red devil on the dresser
Writing red pencil on the letter
Thin slices of the cheddar
Fold it up make my life better
We had the lunch at Osteria Morini
I had the calf's brain
Half glass of Cabernet on the PATH train
New year they still love me for my past fame
Like a soccer player call me by my last name
A young Zinedine Zidane
In Flushing Meadow Park drinking hennessy with mom
You might catch me out in Tennessee with wine
Won't even dine unless the ice sculpture centerpiece a swan

Fly away
Shit, won't even dine
Unless the ice sculpture centerpiece a swan",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-its-me-lyrics
In The City,Blue Chips 2,2013,"In the city of big dream and bright lights
What you see is what you get so motherfucker look twice
Hard times, just tryna get by
I remember a night when I was tryna get high
So much stress

New at the game but I learn quick
Everything I purchase I've earned it
You can catch me in suburban swervin'
Window half down think I'm German
Hit the tree's now I'm bent, use febreeze for the scent
Hide the G's in a vent so you see the boy wiggle the keys to the Benz
One and only, Bam Bam, Flushing, Queens represent
After we shoot we throw the tec out
, at least 10 stacks when I step out
Through explanations from the chefs mouth
No more stress


Tires screech for the iron I reach reclining the seat
Now you sleep, the shit is pure have you grinding your teeth
See a smile on ya face but you dying underneath
What it be? ain't nothing, stay stunting
Jewerly on the wave runner
Bronsolino smoother than some shea butter
Chillin by the mountains like a grey hummer
Ate dinner while they played the whispers
I had the fish it was the delicious, had hibiscus syrup
Trips to Europe, bitch I'm here cheer up
Have a beer, pull a chair up, there's some things we got to clear up
I'm the motherfucking man, dyke, big stack of money with the rubber band tight
Lie with the left, shake hands right

Make two farm fresh scrambled eggs with the grits
Classic club soda, splash with the twist, lime
Placed on my wrist: custom Swiss time
Hit the slopes, custom case for the smoke
Lifted up, flour for the cake getting sifted up
Make it fluffy... poof
Bring your fucking buttcheeks here... boof
Man, I fucking stand on my own, pockets getting thick like Luthor
Hundred dollars all it takes to get a kid to shoot ya
Dip to the Red Roof Inn, have a sandwich
At 7:30, on the Greyhound back to Kansas
My life is written, you sittin' while you pissin'
I'm only sittin' if I'm shittin'
And I'm shittin' often, I'm a boss
Smokin' while I'm coughin'
50 piece, a mummy that was laid inside the coffin
Extract the blood from the mosquito
In the amber, Deion Sanders on my feet inside the Regal
My shorty tan, last name Esposito
And gettin' money every day my destiny though
You could mistake me for a truck driver
On the strip, paying 30 for a muff diver
She had the red pussy hairs like a brush fire
Peace to Jamaican big girl, 'nuff iyah

Come back sit in the chair baby you're royal

Where them hammers get gripped
A fiend will suck your dick

Twin Porsches,

Shit on my chest, shoot colors like a care bear
All year see me tan, hopping out the van
You wasn’t there, now you tryna show face
Fuck around, be a cold case
Chrome skates on an old day
Remote control chains, 
promote dough for the veins
Poke chicks, hoes with vogue legs
Eat steaks off a gold plate, stoned, listening to Coldplay

Push the 635 to the finals

The finest vaginas demolished by my dick
One year from Queens to the top
Cream of the crop, serve a fiend out my sock
Five minutes till they lean like the drop
Now they spinning through the furnace like the scene from The Rock
Hide spinach like a doomsday prepper
Every Sunday in my Tuesday leather

My price cheaper, guaranteed

It's all for a profit

Lay in the tropics, my girl pussy red like a lobster
Orgies at Hofstra
My bank account is like a Polish doctor
My heart is cold, I sing a soldiers opera
My drugs as strong as Arnold
They found her dead in the gold Impala
Hanging backwards out the chopper
The room smell like Nag Champa
Most my crew a bunch of armed robbers


Yeah, I rhyme sick like I play with shit
I've driven every flavored whip there is to get
Feel like I dip that cigarette in wet stuff
I should be on that Sped Ed bus, layin' on the bed with a red head slut
These mother fuckers praying that I don't make it
I'm on the balcony stoned and naked playing Sega
Prince of Albania
No money, nothing to say to ya
I push the limo to the stadium
Game 7, Knicks-Heat
Me and Spike had to switch seats
Cause he kept spilling Henny all on my bitch feet
Expensive bracelets where my forearms and my fists meet
Down in Mexico eating chilis


No emotions, lotions on the bed sheets
I saw her walking cause I'm stalking on the dead streets
Trying to purchase where the shoulders and the head meet
She had a tight pink dress, her pussy was a weapon
Said she was a daughter of a Reverend
Well, thank god I don't believe in heaven
Butt cheeks sculpted like a horse's hind
Shit man, I think that I just crossed the line
Annual abortion time
Yeah, she got the tat straight from West 4th
Hereditary cancer almost took her breast off
And over 6 months she said she had a chest cough
Well I'm not a doctor, but I know that's not a good sign
Matter of time 'til she placed and laced in a wood pine
For years she was the hood slime
Now no longer having a good time
Under earth, she burst into a sudden birth
Oh shit, the facial of my cousin Murph
Strange occurrences, alignment with the sun and earth, yeah
As baby turtles break the sand just to figure out the meaning
Instinctively they heading towards the water cause they need it
Forever cycles stay the same, they feel it like a fiend's wrist
Mustard straight from Russia that they brought in on a steam ship
My mustache like a Colonel

But you were
Running the streets, letting the blam-blam work

And you wanna tell the feds about some shit and it hurts
Fuck it, so be it, you 'bout to know Jesus

Die happy, knowing that my family's straight

Have my apprentice put the stainless to a bastard's chest

Come...hold my dick while I take a piss

I need a wifey tongue longer than Kakey
Shoot the gun right when I whistle, plus she never will snake me
Do a split on my dick

mad butter
Golden brown
If I end up in the can then who gon' hold me down?
Probably no one
They like it when you hot, when you not
They tell you eat a cock off the springboard I dive into the drop
Gold watch, like I just retired
No socks in the loafer cause it's tacky
At least I'm not up in Pataki's
You catch me higher than a Shaq knee
See me swerving side to side like Mutombo finger
The bundle bringer,
 guns are subtle
Hear them clapping like the end of the huddle
I might be big as a bear, but nothing to cuddle
Hop in the shuttle, land in Russia, yo

No time for struggle 'cause we shining today, today
Look out the window see me flying away, away
No time for struggle 'cause we shining today, today

It's a proven fact money make the world go round

This nigga done got so scared he took a shit
Then I swerved in some low key wheels
And go about my business like it never happened, chill
For reals, pop a couple pills
Cup a drink, come to think about it I feels
Like turning up the rap, ignorant, loud

Hungry and angry and I'm savagery, but still
More your majesty, wipe out the cool t-shirt, vacuum it
And I'm gon' keep you rich, so chill
Or you can live with them faggots and stay away from real deal abbots
Death is our game plan, new playing bullets
Come in spray cans, write graffiti all on your vest
Lester, cousin Eve sleeve all greasy
He the best of it, put it right there, you get a check
Slang prostitution, it's prohibition
When we move shit, this is what some niggas suggest
I suggest war, and clout the fake niggas
They could move out, take no chance, you never know, ya'll

For real man, cause we ain't playing no games no more, no more homies
You sit around this, you sit around the best
With gold forks and all that, word up

Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin
Bite the eel by the dozen
 (Got to take it for the team)
Bite the eel by the dozen

Pump the bass in the trunk, shit rattled like a baby hand
Except this toy cost 80 grand
And I'm crazy tan, from all the places that I've been
Just from writing words with a pen
Tell the pilot ""Land the plane,"" 
on Roosevelt and Main
Put a jacuzzi on the seven train
And lay John Coltrane play with that cocaine face
I know your crabs from that Old Bay taste
The brass band was seven pieces, my bitch's name is Peaches
We got twin MAC-11s with the features
Shit you barely got sneaker money
So much dick in their mouths, that's why these motherfuckers speaking funny
You need to speak clearer dear, 'cause I can't hear ya
(I can't hear ya)
You need to speak clearer dear, 'cause I can't hear ya

The Magic Johnson of the game
These lames don't want to play with me
Smile on your face, but I really know you hatin' me
I know you mad, cause I'm sick, and it's plain to see
It's me

Long Time,What Goes Around ,2014,"(Another)
Shit got me creeping ‘round the block, yeah

From the bar to the penthouse, shit done changed
I’m a pro, I ain’t playing in no pick up games
You want your paper and I want mine on time
It’s funny, I’ve only been doing this shit since ‘09
That’s not a long time (another, another)
That’s not a long time
That’s not a long time

It starts off being for the love then it changes
Shaking hands with strangers, hopping in and out of Rangers
Arrangements with spa treatments in the Caymans
Soufflé served fresh out the oven, look amazing
Addiction to the finer things in life
No more Sizzler, no more Golden Corral
Even though Body loves that shit, it’s beneath us
Gum under my sneakers
I just came off tour, bought my mom a new knee
It’s a new day, motherfucker meet the new me
I’m so ahead of the game I’m playing 3K in a Kufi
You still acting like a groupie


Roll out of bed to cold marble floors in the summer
I need my bank account like a German phone number
Call Klaus, I want the Porsche loaded
Shit look like it’s doing aerobics, all white like Maury Povich
I wasn’t given this, I chose this
I’m eating well so I’m looking bloated
I’m on the plane, but I could have floated, uh
You know I’m golden, just like the hair on Hulk Hogan
The pure oil makes me cough like when the doctor checks my nuts for cancer
Hop in a Lancer like a dancer, I’m the answer
The many different questions Russian scientists don’t even know
I guess that you ain’t need to know


Yo, I’mma smoke what I wanna smoke
Drink what I wanna drink
Buttnaked in the Cherokee
You know I’m high ‘til they bury me
I’m staying high ‘til they bury me
Yo, I’mma smoke what I wanna smoke
Drink what I wanna drink
Buttnaked in the Cherokee
I’m staying high ‘til they bury me
Too high to die ‘til they bury me

The plane lift up, it's like that body, boy, chain lift up
Crimes committed with no hiccups
Ah! That thing thing, shred your stomach like sit-ups
You'll never sit up or shit from your butt
They say I'm crazy and deranged, but fuck, I can handle that
I crack the whip right from the camels back
My head is wrapped like Yasser Arafat
And I don't sleep no more, it's only fuckin' power naps

It's so easy to be looked over, I never look sober
Look through the eyes of a soldier, I look fly in a Rover
Lions and cobras, keep the iron in the toga
Send a message, leave you lying over
Bitches crushing on the kid so now they flying over

What, what, what...I don't fuck with this I'm done

My lawyer tackle the case like he play for the Ravens
So I stuff 'em with cheese like a Danish
Damn I crave paper, catch me later at the Laker game, I bet a grip
On the Knicks, Carmelo sweating on my kicks cause I'm court side
This time the good way, ""I'm a free man"" that's what I should say
Nobody holding me back except myself, that's what I feel like
Peeling a five, now I'm feeling the vibe, hand on the wheel, drugs in my eyes

Baby Blue,Mr. Wonderful,2015,"Heartbreak drowned sorrows in a large steak

Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

Because you treat me like shit
I paid for the bed and never even slept in it
I paid for that crib I never stepped foot in
And now somebody else is eating all the pudding
Things change, now my dashboard wooden
All black Benz, like a young Doc Gooden
Dark shades, cause I'm stone crazy
Girl, we grown, stop playing on my phone, baby
All your childish attempts to make me angry fall short
Which only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing
Understandable, I'm shining brilliant with five Brazilians
There were times I used to hide my feelings
Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini
And motherfuckers can't see me
Wait 'til this chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy
Who would've thought I hit you right back?

Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

So many women wanna call me baby
And you wonder why the fuck that I ain't call you lately
Some would say that I'm the symbol for sex and uh
Others would hate, but I don't give 'em no breath
Go on a date, I'm at the crib with the chef and uh, that's me
And you could order whatever
The specialty is white snake and underwear sauce
You could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next
And I understand that's only cause I'm popular
I'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera
As Bocelli sings the celly rings
I gotta go, you'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king
I'm not exactly flawless, but I'm gorgeous, just like a horse is
I know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous
Still I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish

Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

I hope you get a paper cut on your tongue
From a razor in a paper cup
I hope every soda you drink already shaken up
I hope your dreams dry like raisins in the baking sun
I hope your titties all saggy in your early 20's
I hope there's always snow in your driveway
I hope you never get off Fridays
And you work at a Friday's that's always busy on Fridays
I hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket
I hope it's Ben and Socrates poop all up in your kitchen
I hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck
And your headphones short, and your charger don't work
And you spill shit on your shirt
I hope your tears don't hurt, and I can smile in your face
Cut my losses, how Delilah changed my locks to a fade
I hope you happy, I hope you happy
I hope you ruined this shit for a reason, I hope you happy (igh!)

Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?

The cops chasin' Bronson in an all-white Ford
Shit, I'm on that all-night tour

I'm in a robe dancin' salsa on the top floor
You would swear I'm Puerto Rican, but I'm not, lord
Hot hoes every city that we go, singin'
""Heads high, kill 'em with it now!""

All my women play the flute
Saw me plate some melon and prosciutt'
Left handed, make the Fender cry
Count money with a reverend's smile, the Devil's eye
Half-Cherokee and Gemini, uh
Motherfuckers'll dump heat, from Jump Street
And turn your chest plate to lunch meat
I'm in a Humvee, lookin' like a young me
Now these motherfuckers all wanna be chubby
I switch the season, now the hair's curled
Tan skin, I need a bad girl
Cause James Brown said, ""It's A Man's World""
In a Transam' Twirl, the burner handle made of pearl
That's just ""Daddy's Little Girl""

You got the urge to suck the cock of Serge Ibaka
Pictures of naked rappers hangin' in your locker
You and your father never played catch, he taught you how to twerk
Since I've been on the Earth I've been lightin' up
And I've been all around the world twistin' dykes and purp
Shit, light the earth

Only in America
Just can't seem to get you off of my mind
Only in America
All that seems we're goin' nowhere
Only in America
And I just can't seem to get you off my mind
The best things in life are free

Galactic Love,Mr. Wonderful,2015,"Do me a favor, with that, light the candle
Is that the Hawaiian Rayman?
Aight I get the same one every single time, I don't understand this

At the piano with a glass of pinot
All red silk like I'm nino
Custom made shit, I weight 140 kilos
Sneeze on 100G's, hoes on their knees blow from Montego
The way my hair look you swear my name was Rodrigo
Lay low, if you can't do it then just say no
If you ain't built to play this game then you get halo'd
I put a lot of fiends in k-holes

Hello
Hi
What's up mama?
I just watched  perform
How do you feel about it?
They ain't you baby hahaha, you're better than all these shit heads

I'm just a bastard with a bad habit
Bad back in a black Volkswagen Rabbit
Shit I gotta have it
Black magic woman put a spell on me
Fuck around and win a spelling bee
I could walk under ladders, still win the lotto
Ten minutes flat, built a boat in a bottle
Roy Rogers bathroom, sniffin' coke with a model
Told her to Google me, shit I might paint the Cougar green
All this lechuga in my jeans
I still see Freddy Kruger in my dreams
Ain't nothin' moving but the cream
Shit, know I do it for team

I just wanna hear em announce your name, that's all I care about
How's your knee?
My knee is... It's not bad these past few days
You been alright?

That's all I care about
Took a meeting up at Paramount
Typecast as a romantic lead
I'm classically trained for drug dealing
But I wasn't good at drug dealing
So I flipped shit, rug, ceiling
Dry water, five daughters all stood 5'4""
Or got 5 quarters for the store

Fuck knows what I'm saying anymore mane, my mind is shot, been working so motherfuckin' hard
So I'm bout to light this motherfuckin' dab up

DId she find someone new?
I hope it's not true

It's gonna hurt, what she has to say

Hittin' up the witnesses so can't nobody say shit

No fucks are given ever cause I'm rotten to the core

Aah, cross the street when you see us by the store
I'm off the leash, dick hanging on the floor
Box cutters rolled up in the waistband of the 09's
You thought you had your little shit
Figured out, but no mas
My bitch will choke you out with strong thighs
Strong features in the face from the winny

What About the Rest of Us?,Southpaw (Music From And Inspired by the Motion Picture),2015,"Action

05' pounds in the Laredo, they gotta get there today though
Ain’t no time for tryna lay low, bay bro
If you can’t do it all you gotta do is say no
I’ll take it from there, Ace is on Grand ready to work it
Displayed a smirk like Mr. Perfect
Under the bridge, behind the van, in the cab, I made the drop off
Thank science that nothing popped off, since I was young, had a lust for foreign vehicles and things
My father wore the ring when he pushed me in the swing
Plus he pushed that red thing, I wanted to be like him so bad
Wear the same shoes that he stepped in, of course I need paper
I want to ride the one-seater like speed racer
In the Jetta smoking a one sheet in the green acres
Listening to bullshit music, thinking how I’m gonna do this

Uh, temptations real
Even though we feel we’ve been here before
Somebody help me
Lord have mercy
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
But what about the rest of us?
What about the rest of us?
Screaming, somebody help me
But what about the rest of us?
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy

I’m from a place called the jungle where the living is rough
It had me low for a while now I’m picking it up
Holding the spot straight sticking it ripping it up
I dropped 99 problems
, switching and not giving a fuck
So what you what you want? Got your bitch nigga gripping her butt
Her and my dick, taking pics nigga flicking it up
My click is wassup get buck if you want?
You end up dumped chump, in the pond lake in a truck in New York
There’s no ducking me, the Bada$$ time, but no fuckery
Won’t find a chick who got a dime or take a single buck from me
These hoes be loving me, I keep it so G
Respecting where I be nigga check your OG
My rap flow, imperial fad flows
Well here it go my, visions is linear when I’m ripping the video
It’s a lyrical miracle when I enter your stereo
The rarest breeds, sick like venereal diseases

Killing to live, fighting for something
Too bad we don’t know what it is

Trying to put stamps on my passport

A: Yo, yo, I got this, baby. I got this

Yo, spent your advance on one trip to Six Flags
With a handicapped class with your candy rap ass
Bitch, you singin' like Frankie Lymon
Fuck around, you might break your hymen
Then somebody's gonna have to clean the mess up
Like you fuckin' spilled ketchup
Fuckin' flawless from the neck up
If you want it, better step up
You don't wanna feel that brat-tat-tat-tat
Come through the fuckin' ball court with Salt-N-Pepa

Hoppin' out the rover, parrot on my shoulder
Just say, ""What up,"" I might acknowledge you
My shit is crazy, though appear to be a common dude
I only deal with people that invent shit
'Cause after rap there ain't no pension
And I'm just tryin' to be the next George Foreman
Inventin' new grills so Jadakiss could cook the base on it
I might take a shit in some expensive jeans
I got expensive habits
My kids are mixed like Lenny Kravitz
It's not me rappin', it's the parrot
And if I punch you in the face
You'll never eat a motherfuckin' sandwich!

Fuck being cordial, I'm laughin' while I'm dancin' in the ball room
Former king's head lay in the guillotine
Snap my fingers, chop that motherfucker for the village to see
Ain't no man walking iller than me
If you see me, better kneel on the knee
I'm like a one-in-a-million case
Brilliant face, crooked J tryna put me in the cage
Turn the page, bitch, I'm paid
I been around the world more than Carmen Sandiego
Raw meat thrown to lions under the table
Grown men breakin' bread while your face bled
Found him face down in the shed like a base head
Switch plates on the Civic, pivot
Exotic places that they rap about, I live it
Fat boy, I'm eatin' all the spinach
Hold up a second, baby, I ain't even finished, nah
I dropped 50 grand on my man's bail
Two hours later, he was tan as a potato
From a foreign land that once was occupied by NATO
Every line is nasal
We deal with more numbers than times tables
Bodies get found in the ground by neighbors
I'm in the bathroom reading the paper, laid up
Sharp blade cut, need a top, girly-girlies like it
The ones that go two ways, it's just my blue phase
Shit, dawg, yo
I'm in the bathroom reading the paper, laid up
Butt-naked in the Lamborghini
These motherfuckers can't see me
The Magic Johnson of the game, these lames don't want to play with me

The rifle to the peephole, free throw
Call me Baby Face, welcome to the creep show
Uh, my clique is so nuts
Big shit to lift you like a triple-toe lutz
In these streets, even a cripple gonna bust
Keep a thing that won't rust

Rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints

Flying from a tropical escape
""Did I do a perfect dive?"" is such a popular debate

Drunk-driving on a Thursday

Wood splash on the floor, that's for decor

Bought the drugs in front a A-Frame
Flashbacks of riding on the A-Train
Getting sucked between the cars by a Guatemalan

On the French boat, till I'm dead broke

Then I'm gripped up, hangin' off my shoulder, fuck the bullshit
November rain came the same day
My daughter taught me how to do the Nae Nae to Calle 13
Only compare me to Kevin Spacey

Do a world tour and scoop some dollars
Come home and hit the pool hall
I'm fishbowlin' new Impalas
Two Russian twins suck while I drive fast
It's me, man

I'm the one that takes the wolf head, wears it on my own head

You ain't gettin' no bread, you ain't gettin' no shows
You ain't gettin' no dough, you ain't gettin' no hoes

Skippin' school bitches, cookin' me food bitches
All my niggas down, we lookin' like Fu-Schnickens
Got a few tickets for bitches who truly digged us
College dormitories, fill 'em with smooth lyrics
Air Max 95s, grey sweats, true menace
Known as a Jonas, complex on the phoner
Simple individual, confident in the Lotus
Foreign ambitions, they go with my last wishes
As I open my eyes, surprised by seven figures
Baking soda required, decided drug dealin'
Residents is divided amongst the feds and children
Let him keep totin' drugs if he willin' to plead guilty
The star state witness, they'll hit you up for that selfie
Dro can only help me, Backwood and I'm healthy
I'm the label owner, I'm the only one can shelf me

I'm the type to look up continents and then explore a few
Splash Disaronno in the coffee

Every Gucci hoodie that's out, you couldn't style with me
Creamed spinach, vintage, tinted but still shine through
Easy 'fore we up in the spot, I might blind you

How we celebrate? Went to 125 and bought a red leather (Another fact)

He just sitting in the whip by himself bumping Janet
Rhythm Nation, living life without no limitations (Uh)
Tryna have enough money that'll fill the basement (Please)
And enough drugs to fill my face with
And enough to give the M6 a facelift (Damn)
Turn that motherfucker to a spaceship (Woo, yup)
All these women calling me Taye Diggs (Uh, woo, yup)

I no longer bite my nails down to the cuticles (No more)
My sex stories ain't suitable for listeners
Cause prisoners to wack off, aw man (Yo, chill, chill, chill, chill)
Enough of that soft shit, me by myself is like the four horsemen
You're just a poor sportsman, your sports car could be your coffin
The thought of revenge release endorphins
That make me feel just like I'm swimming with some dolphins (God damn)
Ring, ring for this I gotta call 'em baby, shit, I might retire
Spend the rest of my days down in New Orleans maybe
Money changed me for the better
So I brought it back and got the all black Jetta
With the header and the leather bra
Thinking back like ""Shit, dog, you really set the bar""
High as fuck 'bout to twist another
Too many people gone, damn, we miss our brothers
What the fuck is going on? A strange sense, ah
Something's going wrong, I can feel it in my fingers, man, shit
A strong scent lingers
Something's going wrong, I can feel it in my fingers
Like arthritis when it's raining, uh

Let it rain on me
Let it rain
Uh, it's me
On me

It only took me nine times to make a debut, tenth time's a charm, shit (True)
Now man’s on road, that means I'm hard
Charge whatever on the Visa card, half moon Caesar parts
A lot of motherfuckers blind, they couldn't see the art
War stories, throw 'em through a stack of tables
Wrap my body in a stack of Bibles ‘cause shit could get dangerous
Bam Bam splash off the turn buckle (Splash)
Now you no longer have to use your nerves or muscles
We'll see who loves me if I need a liver, shit
You feel defenseless in the presence of a stripper (Shit)
You cannot be trusted with the access to the money
I crash more Benzes than when they practice with the dummies
I make these bastards look funny, Bugs Bunny, pussy
I make these bastards look funny, Bugs Bunny (Bugs Bunny)
Uh, yeah, these motherfuckers must be crazy, ‘cause I ain't going nowhere
Until I'm called up to the stars, then I'll go there
Until then, I'm back here to live another life
But for now I'm asking ladies like ""What's up tonight?""
Baby, what's up tonight?
Yeah, what's up tonight?

G-Unit sneaker shit

Bronsolini is the name and when I rhyme its euphoria
To the death of me, motherfuckers seeking that serum
I got the recipe, soft shell crabs right out the Chesapeake
The devil's basil laying lovely in the plastic jar
Open it up from the aroma almost crashed that car
New York livin', linen shorts we too horse driven
And when we sitting down to dine at least there's two course swimming
Probably calamari, 
my young shooter I call him Gallinari
Still serve the Knicks, nibbles of parmigiani
Hand-craft the cheeses, aged inside the cave to thaw
Off to my tailor alterations for my days in court
Come to the park with my jump shot, got five bets
I'm on price
, deadly in the clutch with the precision of a shark bite
After that we split the paper up and spark the pepper flakes
Flying to the heights, 
Dominican buffet for pepper steaks
You know its Queensbridge you hear the flavour of my music
My brother Lonny manoeuvre huggin' knotties in the Buick, fluid
Close-knit, no shit just like a herringbone
And laid over the sweater of many brothers of 
My aura glistening, my shit's official in
And for my platter's three stars, the book of Michelin
Study Ju-Jitsu in, closets of crystalline

Under the palm tree, accent mimicking Connery

Back 2 The Future,The Program EP,UnKnown,"Yo all I need is just a snippet of the orchestra
But now we rockin' leathers and my team is dippin' porches
Trained in special forces
I remain the same
Model in the rugby, with the horses in it
I'm lookin' gorgeous on it
A light gallop
The suit is seersucker, like a scallop
Cop the land and over time you see the price pile up
My life style the dreams of money though it feels nostalgic
It's sunny skies and good karma that keeps the cheese surrounding

I'm known to kick it like I'm Ronaldinho
My rhymes are spicy as a jalapeño
'87 fine Yovino
Cash the drift
One leaf wrap up the reefer
Now the vision seems clear
Just like the cover on the beeper
010, 7:15, month of July
Shorty blowing on my dick
My eyes closed, smoke in the sky
Exhale right through my nose
North bound, headed for gods
First check, a quarter mil
Half that split with the squad, kid
(Bronson talking)
It's like, I don't even know which way to go no more man
Just reflecting on my life now
I gotta get with it
Yo
Deep reflection, smoking drug as the wind blow
Ash the $50 marijuana out the window
My golden aura shine, rising past the borderline
I crush the grape like a Greek to make the gorgeous wine
Open the Dutch and let tobacco fly through the wind
The saga begins
.38 plugs, vivid like photography lens
Soon to see me dip mahogany Benz
I'm in the quality, monogamy with all if my gems
That means I'm - true to it
The beat, I give the flu to it
Or maybe AIDS if I had it, cause I'm a fuckin' addict
I'm on the terrace drinkin' wine and eatin' fuckin' rabbit
To cleanse the palate, lemon segments tossed up in the salad
Spark the pepper, my mind is like a Harvard lecture
Bronsalini going Persian on the carpet texture
Ancient Roman on the architecture
Straight outta' motha fuckin' queens
My team, we got the heart to wet ya'
A Dutch master like Robben and Sneijder
Strike like a viper
The bottom of shoe tap like a type writer
Pipe slider, I'm a fuckin' ninja warrior
We do the drug and eat ćevapi in Astoria
I ride zebras all through the jungle
Take rock and never fumble
Shoot gun right from the waist
Slide piece to make it mumble
On the come through
Several grams are stuffed inside the grundle
Saw the goal line
Went airborne and did a tumble
And I landed on my feet for two G's
And pressed the sand
Wipe the sweat right off my brow
Next door dig up the lamb
That's been roasting over 7 hours
Bronsalini smoke the deadly sour
I'm fuckin' winning like I'm Kenny Powers",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-back-2-the-future-lyrics
Dance Song,The Program EP,UnKnown,"Verse 1
I'm in the party rock the short set
Spanish mommi in the corset
Go right to the bathroom to get the whore wet
Never raw sex, yes I wear the plastic honey
I'm magic Bronsonelli spending all the magic money
Keep on grinding my dick
We'll be on Facebook in 20 seconds holding knives in the flick
Shorty dancing with her tittes out
Staring at me with that pretty mouth
Yo I'm bound to dig the kitty out
Just take me back to the youth
The tommy hil guess g rock the 
gortex on the boot
Smelling like shoup, you see me flex in the coup
Guess I came a long way from 
smoking bless on the stoop
But still, never frontin little hookers with there hands out
Shorty pull your pants out, pour the water on it
Shake it off like a dog
The sour diesel fog all the fly ladies singing a song
It's bronson!!!
(Hook)
Verse 2
We got the liquor flowing heavy, piff holding steady
Shorty in the room sniffing the confetti
Well now she talking my ear off
Whisper in the ear mommi take you brassiere off and show a tit
I'm on the couch going in on a dance move
My team a bunch of criminal vandals
No sandals, high stakes, bitches hopping out the cake
Bending over, show me how the booty shake
She did a split, stop and pop it like cherokee
Moving one cheek at a time right to the melody
I wanna bite her on the back
Crumple dollar bills and throw em right up her crack
I'm going in, 
you peep the trim, snappy dappy dugout
Her pussy dripping yo I had to throw my rug out
Sunrise and the dicksucks and liquor pouring
Not a single motherfucker in my clique is snoring",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-dance-song-lyrics
Compliments To The Chef,Underground Airplay 2: The New York Renaissance ,UnKnown,"Compliments to the chef, the baby lamb was perfect
Now I smoke the drugs that got me feelin' like I'm surfin'
Dusk on the North Shore, hash on my person
Roll it to a snake then I wrap it like a turban
We in the jungle with the shaman
Tryna find these answers to these problems I've been ponderin'
Now these motherfuckers hollerin' with their lips puckered like collagen
Sell me the world, and my kids, put them in colleges
But daddy get it by himself on the reg
Stuffed zucchini flowers, mix ricotta with the egg
Chopped parsley, soft flakes, Himalayan mines
Meditation time help me penetrate the mind
December 2nd '83, I was created
My vision's wide of the human being jaded
It's just reality, dealt with on a daily basis
Big Body put the burner in these bitches faces

Oh, they're selling dreams out here in every corner store
Pawn 'em on the streets, I feel, they're selling me the world
But if it all goes up, it could all come down the same
So when I go where I go I remember where I came...
Remember where I came from

Yo, yo can lead a horse to water but you can't make 'em drink it
Two in the pink, two in the stink
Leather colored goulash, talks with Lou Dobbs, create some new jobs
In '87, saw my father in a blue Saab
Right seat sittin', left hand shiftin'
You know that every team needs a Paxson and a Pippen
Bronson rappin' like he on an acid tab trippin'
You changin' with the moon with a Maxi Pad drippin'
High-five love, 5'5, plump
Sell the pussy 'til the shit look like a Ty Cobb glove
Bring me back the money then I dip to Arizona
Put my balls in your mouth, bubble tea, tapioca
Smoked shark, speakin' in a Nordic slang
Baby blue eyes, important like an August rain
Clear water from the creek keep me nourished
Keep my head up, never discouraged, pussy bitch


Yeah... remember where I came from...
Remember where I came from...
Yeah... remember where I came from...
Remember where I came from...",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-compliments-to-the-chef-lyrics

You lifted the cards and showed your hand pussy

Take my nuts out your mouth

About to be a huge star and I'm still in Queens

Drugs infested my mind
But I'm destined to shine
Spit the shit to keep these motherfuckers pressing rewind
Thousands of pounds of pressure pressed on your spine
Live divine, free the mind, lead the blind, read the signs
Hands up like you stepping in the party
No you getting robbed, motherfucker, with the shotty
Said you pottyd
Make your body do an ollie
Then dig your shorty out cuz I geeked her up on molly
Have her eating dick, no need for seasoning
If seven dudes are in the room then she's pleasing them
Like a trooper. Hit her in the pooper. Throw her in the shower
Then I take her out to Lupa
I'm kinky, I'll hit it even if it's stinky
Put em in the shower, make the pussy brand new
Ran through. Give 'em money what I can't do
Stuff her lunchbox & burn her with the candle

To come and take this, find you in a basement naked

She took a sniff, now she dancin' like she Usher Raymond
See me swerving in the Lincoln with the Daytons
Seat colors Sanaa Lathan, kinda resembles fried bacon
I shoot at your crew, put the spoon inside the Tiramisu
As I sat there looking cute in a suit
Shit I made it cool
To be yourself again without nobody helpin' em
What is that velvet?
Yes it is baby, I'm a specialist
All these fuckin' demons that infest the kid
This be that shit that your grandfather's invested in
Dad's back, your new shit I had that
My new bitch is half black, Bimmer made the hatchback
I'm havin' flashbacks of razors in the ass crack
Hundred thousand dollars all in ones inside the trash bag
A bunch of fiends, I'm havin' lunch in Queens
A lot of hundreds in my Dungarees
I'm at the garden sittin' Indian style, that means I'm on the floor
My skin is shinin' like it's Armor All
Freak bitches like a carnival
Bitch I stay on the boat just like a barnacle
I don't talk to no sons so bring your father through
And I was born in December, paint the Impala blue
Bitch it's gettin' cold, huh

She sniff blow, did the heel toe
Off the wheel of the de Ville, then I peel slow
For real though, I'm trying to get Shaquille dough
Huh, I'm just trying to get Shaquille dough

Hang out the window of my sports car I'm listenin' to Prince
Bitch from Berlin is blowin' me behind the tints
Doves cried, then I let my nut fly in a sluts eye
Eyes still in the mirror lookin' for one time
When we were younger used to play in parks
Now my hunger got me drivin' European sharks
Lay in lofts, paint the hall a light Chilean moss
Shit I stay on the porch, lightin' a torch up like headlights on the Porsche
Tan coupin', work tanner than Cam Newton
Hand crafted Lands snoozin'
Susan, boufin' balloons in, shorty from Oahaxa
Husband back in México, cross this out his lock
Check came in it was $3500 just on the stomach
Imagine what we spent on weapons
And I have our bitch draped up in leopard
Joints filled up with pepper
I'm straight from Queens mother fucker, what you reppin'


My bitch gallop like a tan deer
Stealin' outfits? from the Tangiers
I been a man here so many damn years
You see that plane, it lands here
You see that drop, that's to drive me away, I'm wearin' cashmere
Pink champagne spillin' down the glass again
I swear just one more score baby we cashin' in
Me and money got a good rapport
I shot the cuban whore, papi met his maker in the humidor
Dove off the boat with the briefcase, no police chase
Then I went and had a cheesesteak from Ishkabibbles
Hit the sizzle, control the whip with one arm like Richard Kimble

Which mean my girl cried a hundred nights
Hundred groupie hoes I gave the pipe
But I still found time to get my paper right
Big money on it, tell ‘em go and count the pile
Man I swear to God this life is wild
You be creative and they take your style
Lot of bitches out here lame, they just in denial
We keep it cool but she hot as hell, we make it melt
She got me living with a feeling that I never felt
And every day we smoke the dopest dope that has been dealt
I had to leave because I’m getting booked just like a show
She told me I’m a learn that some people ain’t worth the help
And you show them the ropes, they go and hang they self
And I gotta listen to anything that Heather say

Pineapple, fried rice, and fish
Carve my niche, movement on the arms are Swiss

Jogging lightly in an Alfred Dunner, I'm on my second plate
Seedless grapes, Freyja with the Swedish face

Nasty, ashy, cigarette ashing, 'til my voice get raspy
Last week suspended
Last night kissed Va$htie
Parleyed with Ashley
Always in the hallway, so I never been classy
(Ha ha ha) Shut up
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
(Igh, igh, igh, igh!)
Acid acid, get it? Acid
Melts through plastic, I spit fired
Pad my palette, talkin' paper
If this was work, I'd get higher
Pardon my mishaps, burp and get murdered
Fart and get bitch-slapped, like bourbon mixed with jack
Lickety-split, Look it! He slipped on a shell
From peelin' banana splits back
Give me my Kit-Kat
Don't break me off shit, batch, fack is you mean bitch?
Zan with that lean bitch, zan with that lean bitch
Zen with that chakra
I eat it like Idi Amin, Ya Kna Wha Mean
Hit me back when that mean shit
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
(Igh, igh, igh, igh!)
Introducin', It's Bronsonlino
With my hair slicked back, I look like Rick Pitino
3 Japanese dykes in my El Camino
Lettin' trees blow, oh
I rep the East Coast, I got a team of hoes like Pat Summit
I look like Arnold Schwarzenegger in a black hummer (get to the chopper)
I splash summer like a fast brother
With a number on his back, ain't no fumblin', in fact, I'm
Back, acid in my hat
Shoot then pass the gat, it's at the bottom of the river in a plastic bag
My new shorty got a gymnastic back
87 emerald green on a classic jag
She had the cleft palate, I ordered chef's salad
She had the club foot, with that little arm
I couldn't help but laugh, she ordered Chicken Parm
I had the full Bulls warm-up with the Pippens on
Suck my motherfucking dick, it's the young Randy Velarde
Queens, baby
Blow me",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-nana-lyrics
The Illest,UnKnown,UnKnown,"The undisputed
Yo, higher learning
The tires burning
Niggas is rapidly swerving
A face looked familiar
But had to be certain
I popped a u-ey then I merged in
Matter was urgent
A dirty merchant, made him bleed like a virgin
Sent to the surgeon
Searching for them green berets
Trying to blow my dome off
Thrown off by decoys who dropped the maricon off
My Soviet niggas is ready for the Cold War
Machete you to confetti
And blow your brain to cole slaw
A roll call for my niggas that were nearly grazed
And for them early graves by them dudes that really blazed
And sing to your face with metal blades, serenades
I told you to look over your shoulder like Willie Mays
I come from where it's easiest to find anguish
Don't say a word
Speak with our hands like sign language
Divine language embedded into the rhyme patterns
So praise the savior that's saving you from the mind damage
And, oh well, the drugs'll sure to sell
But if you short a sale
They bout to pop you with the coppertop like Duracell
And all the swell kids that dropped out from outreach
Triple jab your cheek
Crack your teeth through the mouthpiece
These foul streets, meet your fate when the Tec releases
You'll be aight if you ain't playing chess with checker pieces
My nigga check the thesis

For hookers selling pussy that'll never see a dime
And snitch niggas singing to the cops, dropping lies
For piggies asking questions but my people turn to mimes
And verbal motion picture, cinematic with the rhymes
For yen up in the envelope, purple in the dutch
And bare knuckle boxing, sneaking weapons in the fight
For clutches being popped and dipping boys up on a bike
This the illest shit you heard in your life

Yo, ayo
Kinetic mind tricks
Live shit that power ships
Thought to message to the finger, lay the coward stiff
Foul kiss, bastard open bowel shit
Bleeding like Christina when I laid her on the towel shit
Sport the Filas, low cream, red and blue
Long jackets, smoking salad out the Jetta new
Whoever knew, we make it singing rap songs
From standing in a circle spitting verbal like a Mac strong
Went from a center for teens, to smoking sour like a surgeon
Swerving in the tunnel on the way to Queens
Knife in the Hansen, cloth over the phone for the ransom
Flow like a phantom
Bitches give me box cause I'm handsome
Roll down the window
Exhale, see flashing lights move
Dip the Babylon like a skater on the ice move
Alex Ovechkin
740, heavy flexing
Dirty Harriet on the body with the cherry Stetson
No not the Western
Hailing from the Eastern seaboard
That's word to me, you couldn't even see lord
Behind my eyes there lies a rugged man
Denominations in millions
Wrapped up in rubber band
Die with the gun in hand
Bronsonelli serve up a baby lamb smorgasbord
Big bosses, you peep the portraits in the corridor
Toke off a chalice
Switch to herbal ventilation
Misplacing families and shit through verbal devastation",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-the-illest-lyrics
Shiraz produced by action bronson,UnKnown,UnKnown,"We've been the best since I stepped in
Bring a hooker to the muthafuckin Jets Inn
In the sack, break her back like a Redskin
Need the dough like I'm trying to get the bread thin
Tree to make the head spin
Every season play the corner like I'm Revis
Light Caesar, heavy bearded like I'm Jesus
New York City, Queens borough be the backdrop
I bring it back to all the benches, need a blacktop
Big things, see me moving like a Sasquatch
Money, I'm in pursuit, cuchillo inside the boot
Bitches are on display, give brain
Inside the coupe. Shift gears, that's with the left
Which means I'm on the right, get paid
By any means, you hold it, say goodnight kid
Two fingers hold the potion when I'm smoking
Slow motion, snatch a snapper out the ocean
In my lungs go the drugs like the red chief
Red leaf lettuce blood money on the bench seat
12 courses laid up on the long table
Aged wine got me spinning like a dreidel
For fly women use a condom cause it's fatal
Hazel eyed bitched always blazing up the basil
The red razor cut the features in your facial
Creep in na, bumping Fernando Villalona
Puffing cheeba in the street by the chimi corner
Tu ne tappa me, muthafuckas are sloppy
Captain of the rap, you talking to papi
Up in Niagara Falls, make your wifey suck a
Bag of balls, it's sick, just like a Magic cough
Same person on camera or when the muthafuckin' camera off
Hash straight from the desert, can knock
A camel off, Sheep straight out of school
Let the hammers off. Off the boat shit
Whole cliques roll thick, no shit
Piss drunk and they smoke sticks
Not a word of English but
They hold the four-fifths
FILA jumpsuit, sandals, the whole shit
Young kids walking around, got the Desi in hand
Going ""Boom Shakalaka!"" like it's NBA Jam
Never speak to fuzz
Tap out the reefer, show him how
To use his sneakers, cuz
Roasted peppers, sweet tomatoes, heirloom
We on the beach, fresh Ceviche
We in Cancun, fly girly curly
Hair is getting read through
We in the shower give me head: shampoo
Swimming trunk, shoe accentuate the ankle
Eyes blue, put the children's money in the Banco
Giuseppe Franco, take the cash and tango
I'm straight stoned -sly, thank you

Compliments 2 the Chef (feat. Lauriana Mae),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Compliments to the chef, the baby lamb was perfect
Now I smoke the drugs that got me feelin’ like I’m surfin’
Dusk on the North Shore, hash on my person
Roll it to a snake then I wrap it like a turban
We in the jungle with the shaman
Tryna find these answers to these problems I’ve been ponderin’
Now these motherfuckers hollerin’ with their lips puckered like colagen
Sell me the world, and my kids, put them in colleges
But daddy get it by himself on the reg
Stuffed zucchini flowers, mix ricotta with the egg
Chopped parsley, soft flakes, Himalayan minds
Meditation time helps me penetrate the mind
December 2nd, ’83 I was created
My vision’s wider, the human being’s jaded
It’s just reality, dealt with on a daily basis
Big Body put the burner in these bitches faces

Oh, they’re selling dreams out here
In every corner store
Pawn ‘em on the streets, I feel
They’re selling me the world
But if it all goes up, it could all come down the same
So when I go where I go I remember where I came…
Remember where I came from

Yo, yo can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink it
Two in the pink, two in the stink
Leather-coloured goulash, talks with Lou Dobbs, create some new jobs
In ’87 I saw my father in a blue Saab
Right seat sittin’, left hand shiftin’
You know that every team needs a Paxton and a Pippen
Bronson rappin’ like he on an acid tab trippin’
You changin’ with the moon with a Maxi Pad drippin’
High-five love – 5’5, plump
Sell the pussy ’til the shit look like a Ty Cobb glove
Bring me back the money then I dip to Arizona
Put my balls in your mouth, bubble tea, tapioca
Smoke shark, speakin’ in a Nordic slang
Baby blue eyes, important like an August rain
Clear water from the creek keep me nourished
Keep my head up, never discouraged, pussy bitch


Yeah… remember where I came from…
Remember where I came from…
Yeah… remember where I came from…
Remember where I came from…",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-compliments-2-the-chef-feat-lauriana-mae-lyrics
Industry Shakedown Cypher,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yo, yo, my man Troy, he used to jump over his own foot
Jump into a spin and give a grin that left them hoes shook
At that time, my jeans were baggy with the hoody
Back on Main Street, the maxi-single, copped it at the Goody
Up in the room, writing graffiti for hours
Dreams of being in a tower with Nia Long in the shower
Sucking my dicky like a pacifer
Now it's 2009, pussy, so pass the fire
They get the bastard higher
5'6"", 260, I'm a destroyer
Got it with class, Dali paintings inside the foyer
To keep it all kosher, I'm strictly Jewish on the lawyer
When it comes to my freedom, I can't trust it to a goyim
Yo, I can't leave it up to a goyim

Yo, yo, Bermuda Triangle beat black out
Black Hole flow deep, can't see back out
So once you in, you in
Niggas speaking clout or reroute
And keep your heaters out the pouch
Once you see what we're about
No doubt
The organs make a nigga feel it in his organ
Honor the slogan saying we're never gonna soften
Single momma's put into the coffin kind of often
Conducting business dirty, then turn you into an orphan
It's simple as that, detonate your own system
The accurate aim, contacts it won't miss him
The poem shift him off his feet
But the chrome lift him
For talking out the side of their mouth like a stroke victim
And four fifth him
And bounce with the knot up in the sock
And trade your four chrome rims for four cinder blocks
The mic maestro, precise knife flow
Why debate? Just bite the bait, nigga
You might strike gold
Nigga, what

I run with old school New York shooters like Greg Anthony
Second hand gun smoke can't cancer me
It's all good then
I'mma keep the same friends
Classic timepiece, hopping out a strange Benz
With dame, duckets, yeah, young cool mill
Stacks copped the salmon skin, silver DeVille
My mind's sick but my dress code's ill
Sneakers got AIDS, they need more than a pill
Self employed, shirts have Typhoid
Beefs annoy, don't get destroyed (what!)
By this New York menace
Cock Glocks, pop shots, turn your face to a blemish
I does this, once a back block apprentice
My work will numb a nigga's mouth like a dentist
Go and ask OG's how we rock
My rhymes come back, I don't re-rock
He hot, correct, if it's Meyhem Lauren
Flow like a 9, work like a 10
Shoe size a 12, main chick a 8
Side bitch a 7 but her pussy is great
Get it straight, outsmart you and stomp you
Intelligent ape
I'm a G you're a fake like a planned mistake
Lobster claw in my paw, other hand on steak
Polo Blue, Hennessy, yeah you smell me
My gun game's meaner than Leona Helmsley
Rhymes are crimes, 9's, AK's
An unused tech in the box that just sprays
.38's more special than Mavado
Medallion money, we call that helado
If my ? special, my .44 is like a brand new king conquistador
Mutha, yo, yo, ayo

700 dollar bottle of that Montrachet
Far and away, extraordinary bar display
Gil Grissom, look beyond the Solar System
Draw it all into a square until you find what's missing
Take your time cause patience is your best friend
Simmering at the importance of it sets in
Prep your area, sterilize your work tools
Foul living, never seen up on the church stools
I'm still sporting my shorts until the dead of winter
The charismatic, the dope addict, The Shredder, Splinter
Roll the magic, feeling like I'm cuffed in the water
How the fuck I manage, roll in the quarter, slaughter
Many cattle, many times for pleasure
Modeling the skin while I'm searching for the treasure
Keep astute, sink your body deep into the coupe
Or they’ll soon to find you asleep in that suit
Shoot, the Big Dipper
The golden candy Caddy tipper
Close my eyes
Back in time trying to murder Hitler
My mind and rhymes aligned with the solar signs
Dinosaurs being, something, barrels holding wine
Layers of cake, fiends up in Okeechobee Lake
Freshwater pike be on a player plate",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-industry-shakedown-cypher-lyrics
Pitchfork Selector Freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I'm eating sushi off a black hooker
Crushing numbers in the math booklet
She had the panties with the pussy cut out
Jewish holiday, she bake the bread
Then she twist my hash, I get her high, take her straight to bed
I'm diving in, I'm riding in that V-12 twin turbo on the Gaza Strip
Rocking Iversons with the ivory wheel
No practice, I'm classic, you bastards
I front-flip in limo windows, sip the limoncello
Somersault into a dismount off the uneven bars, then throw my hands straight up
Fuck around, sprain my ankle with the next maneuver
I'm one in a million, played the pavilion
Fuck around in the razor, get displayed to your children
We hire Asians for killings, ready, able, and willing
Getting paid in the building
It's me, on the ice cream truck

Night Court Produced Don Producci,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Behind door one:
There's three things: greed, fortune and fame
Door two:
You might be happy but nobody know your name
Door three:
The bacon got you squatting naked by the razor fence
Door four:
You on the bench and got the drugs inside your favourite Tims
Cause on the road to riches, there ain't no time for getting sidetracked
Pump in the trunk if you frontin' punkin' you lie flat -
Down on the pavement
Diamond laser engraved it
Wasting all of my time and then wondering where my days went
I'm 26 but still I'm feeling like a senior
I'm only two years removed from leaning in the beamer now
Some friends ain't friends no more, I guess they jealous
Problems with baby mama constantly been like a relish to my
Neck fresh on the set live in the flesh
Rhymin the best
Yo bronsolini fans see hymen and breast
Talking sushi grade
My flow is linen and the shoes are suede
The wooden cutting board is right where the prosciutto laid
That's for the first course
The core burst off and hail
We'll be in hell but nobody trying to see the cell
Tonight we living life until we say goodnight
Breathe on the mic my flow knock the knees of a knight
My time always the right time
I'm surfing getting wavy
Like hawaiians on the pipeline, I'm never in my right mind
Zagat rated thirty foot decor
The food and service
Hey the blow is chopped up on the plate yo peace to Curtis
Never nervous cause I'm ready
Went from leaning in the German now we swerving in the Chevy
Artichokes cover spaghetti
Can't begin to fathom how I pair the words and form the sentences
Pierre Cardere described in bold print on the lenseses
One leaf, half of the dutch combat the cancer
Peace to Elton John cause in the jacket got the tiny dancer
Ready to tango
Extra clips inside the pouch just like the creature on the Kangol
Paint that precious shit like Van Gogh
Mango, that's for the lassi
I love when bitches sassy
Slutty nasty, and let me smash it in the taxi
Then I give her a german brunch
And now she turning stunts
Since 16 six times a day I'm burning blunts
I wanna live the life the twenty beamers gleaming shorty steaming rice
And then the fluff all burnt my penis shoot the semen twice in the face
Flyest of steaks, got my eyes on the papes
Rhyme butter lake you know my grading be prime on the steak
Aged to perfection, that's how I like the veno
We rolling ceelo
Throw like Marino
Cruise in the Regal
In overdrive like my libido
I'm stroking like I'm Michael Phelps into the pussy fetal
It's Bronsolino
Just like the dutch up
Leather loaf and mash the clutch up
We getting fucked up
I make the motherfucker beam a  up
Hellish capers and now I'm scoring more than Celtic Lakers
Kicking like Messi now we overlooking gorgeous acres
In my defence it's like the '85 Bears
There's no jail tales
Poetry emotion like I'm Gale Sayers
Before Maguire took his first needle
Yo we been looking fly and faucet fiends in corners in the bird fetal -
Positioning I know you hear me but not listening
We glistening I rock a jacket made for fishermen
The buccaneer for nutritional and a buck of deer
Create a hash vat and bake it off, cut a square
Tonne of flair like Rick I hold the pick
And plus I smoke a stick of heavy marijuana when I pose for flick
Get off the dick because we busting now
And when we come we eating crepes, you know we order up a dozen now",https://genius.com/Action-bronson-night-court-produced-don-producci-lyrics
