The Gas Face,The Cactus Album,1989,"Ayo, man, my labelmate, Don Newkirk
Man, step to 'em

Thanks, Serch!
And now... for the Prime Minister...
Sinister... Pete... N-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hice!
Nice, Nice, Nice

Kick 'em in the grill, Pete!

Gas—past tense, made facially
3rd Bass'll express, KMD
Three blind mice on sight
Zev Lover, gave it the first light
A grin shows a trick up a sleeve (HUAHAH)
What a tangled web they weave
Deceivers, stupefied through fable
Say Let's Make a Deal at the dinner table
Put you on tour, put your record on wax (""Trust me!"")
Sign your life on the X
You exit, x-off, but what you really get:
A box of Newports, and Puma sweats (""Damn!"")
Tex feeds and frowns upon Emis
To give up Gas Face he drinks from a Thermos
Sub Roc cut at you with a clipper
Gas Face given, I beg to differ

Pete that was real def, man, but I gotta get serious now
Ayo, Don, step to 'em again

Everybody... MC Serch!

Black cat is bad luck, bad guys wear black
Musta been a white guy who started all that
(Make the Gas Face!) For those little white lies
My expression to the mountainous blue eyes
Then form a face, and shake my skull cap
Dismiss the myth, that evil is not black
But opposite spectrum, this done by red man
With horns on his head, laid down the ill plan
Got all his helpers, said, ""Make it snappy!
Tell all the people that their hair can't be nappy!""
Blonde and blue-eyed, or dark-skinned heffer, G
A disease, created by leprosy
Don't speak of bleach, bend them to right
Say it was night WAY before the light
Put aside spooks, Serch leaves a trace
I've set em correct with the effect of the Gas Face

Next up, Don?

A special appearance by KMD's Zev Love X!

A Gas Face can either be a smile or a smirk
When appears, a monkey wrench to work one's clockwork
Perkin his brim to the rim of my cup
Don't tempt me, you're empty, so fill'er up!
Is I'm talkin coffee or cocoa, is you loco?
Cash or credit for unleaded at Sunoco
KMD and 3rd Bass is just ace in the hole
I mean soul, so make the Gas Face (HUAHAHA)
Damn, if looks could kill
You look like host was a ghost from your grill
But still, what's the new fed, to recollect
To our passing phase to facades to '80-deca
For my label reads Hood, street might have a tattoo
Don't pick any card or no rabbit from my hat
Never a magician if I ever tricked em
""Oh shit!"" Another Gas Face victim

There it is, yo fellas man
Why don't you step to the mic man?

That's how I kicks it, for 80-deca

Ayo, good lookin' out Don, man, peace
Punji, yo, who gets the Gas Face?
Little Vic for the Gas Face
Tony Dick, gets the Gas Face
No Gas Faces for Plugs One Two and Three
 No Gas Face for Professor Prince Pa-paul!
My friend Tina gets the big Gas Face
 No Gas Face for DJ Subroc
No Gas Face for KMD
 Hammer, shut the fuck up! Gas Face! AHUAHAUAH!
WHAHAHAOAHH
What do we think about Hammer? HAOWAHWOHAHBHABHAHBHAHBBHB
G.Y.P
Get Yours Posse does not get the Gas Face
But P. W. Botha gets a Gas Face
 WHOAHBLBLAHBHA-WHOO!
Dante Ross gets the Gas Face
Yo stop dissin Dante on records y'all!
 Elroy.. Elroy.. Elroy Cohen, gets the Gas Face!
HAHAhahahahahaha, that's all..",https://genius.com/3rd-bass-the-gas-face-lyrics
Pop Goes the Weasel,Derelicts of Dialect,1991,"Antoine, Antoine's got something here
Ro-roll that window
We have to turn around because I want to shoot you
Park the limousine, in front of the swamp
Then I want to shoot you dauncing on the limousine
With the swamp in the background
It looks like you're in the jungle, okay?
Let's all sing, Pop Goes the Weasel!

Pop goes the, pop goes the windin of the weasel
I see the empty pocket needs a refill

I got a squad with a list of complainers
I should have started RAPE:
Rappers Against Phony Entertainers
So we can make it known that we won't get swayed
It's ninety-one son, so somethin's gotta change

Gettin paid to peddle sneakers and soda pop (pop pop pop)
Pop goes the weasel as drawers drop (drop drop dop)
Why not take your top ten pop hit
Vic the music and make senseless ryhmes fit

I guess it's the fact that you can't be artistic
Intricate raps, becomin' so simplistic
I gotta strong mind it doesn't have to be spoon-fed
And I can read what doesn't have to be read

So some stay illiterate and feeble, legally licked
You go the ways of the weasel (the weasel)

Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop goes the weasel,
 'cuz the weasel goes pop
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop goes the weasel,
 'cuz the weasel goes pop

Hip-hop, got turned into hit pop
The second a record was number one on the pop charts
For those that get on heart that gotta in the ghetto
Let no one forget about the hard part
Now in ninety-one we got a new brand, a new band
Lookin like the same old Klan
Same old theives that skeez so we gotta make sure
That real rap has got to endure

Why score all my points in one period
Appearin in complex structure like a pyramid
The paper for the media presence
Ya learn lesson from the face of false legend
Stop vexin on the skills, ya ain't originate
The thin ice you skate upon will break and set ya straight
Ate up on the plate, now who's diesel
Not the weasel, not the weasel, pop goes the weasel

Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop goes the weasel,
 'cuz the weasel goes pop
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop goes the weasel,
 'cuz the weasel goes pop
 Ya stole somebody's record then ya looped it, ya looped it
 Ya boosted the record then ya looped it, ya looped it
 Aiyyo, I came from Cali, and they hooped it, they hooped it
 But now you're getting sued kinda stoopid

Boosted tracks get slaps, ya got no haps
To reach all four corners of the map
For kids in Kansas.. to those who speak Spanish
Doin crazy damage so the wack gets banished
Can't manage the truth until you buy a way
Ya ain't quick so ya switch off the exit from my highway
To rest but a crook, had to take a second look
Ever heard of a chef who can't cook?
But the Minister Prime can lay laws
Hey yo, Pete Nice, rip the mic and go for yours

Goes for mine, I goes for mine
Find the Prime won't eat the green eggs and swine
On line like the Serch, in the hoody with the woody
Get a disc or tape, at Sam Goody
Why'd ya run through the doors some left open?
Ropin off the scenes of the crime smokin
I got pub and 
I'mma nut like a SCUD
 see
Blowin up, like I'm throwin up a beef patty
Sell-outs run a bout like the measles
No cures, cause pop goes the weasels

Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop goes the weasel,
 'cuz the weasel goes pop
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel

Steppin’ To The A.M.,The Cactus Album,1989,"*sound of clocks ringing*

Ready in the intro, cue up the Serch-lite
Point us to the center stage (I'll grab the first mic)
Projectin the voice with this mic that I'm cuffin
You ain't my nucka, SUCKER I'm snuffin
The word of the 3rd stands true, so no panickin
(Man verse man) you freeze up like a mannequin
Petrol, you let go, the wax for the new jacks
To dwell upon you're steppin on the trigger as the tune smacks
(Square in the butt) Pete gave me the cue
So I'mma put up or shut up until my jam is through
But for now I wanna freak em, so I'll embark
To spark your mission posse, til way past dark
(Don't park there's no standin) or I'll play the five-oh
You don't stop movin until the Serch says so
To keep the tribe open, shootin out to play em
Three the hard way'll keep you steppin' to the A.M

(At the sound of the tone, the time will be 1 A.M.)

My mind has a question, I respond
To a silver domed microphone (one step beyond)
Straight to eighty-eight to the curves of the 90's
I'm universal, I set a line free
Behind me, the three the hard way, the jackpot
(Awaitin Satan's, tryin to take cheap shots)
We groove crowds, the three stand proud
The brothers round the way sit down and say
(How'd you do this?) Ludicrous rhythm of rhyme
Anticipate like a bottle of Heinz.. KETCHUP
(No catch up!) Cause you fell behind
I'm steppin to the A.M. -- dickin down swine
Pete Nice skims over lyrics, I pick em
Strong and long, you're wrong, I stick em
(He's the law with the sword) with my cable swingin
(Like _The Pit or the Pendulum_) Pete Nice bringin
The sunrise with no lies, legitimate (and you despise)
Envy this MC's magnitude (so realize)
The MC emceed (The DJ deejayed em)
Until the next time I keep you steppin' to the A.M


No weight on the felt plate, deep bass below rise
Needle torture groove, move the record til the wack stride
(Schoolin the swine on the strength of my vocab)
Bet you wonder you're a goner
(You're thinkin that you had)
Lyrics to the A.M. but the house needs a swinger
You st-st-st-st-stutter, but I'm a stinger
(My rhymes so potent, I wrote em and it's evident)
You're just a stunt, seekin a settlement
The lyrical line (The article original)
Afflict like a convict, I ain't no criminal
Schemin on a cable or slobbin the knob
You played me like a foul ball
(How you livin Hobbes?!?!!)
Now groove into the A.M., the master spoon feedin
Out a jumper, you're bumpin a freak while I'm G'n
Peter let the record spin (Serch'll get a second wind)
MOTIVATE THE CROWD, til it's steppin' to the A.M


I slide swiftly, keep a brother steppin
(loungin, strength in my throat)
Sweatin as you get hit with the rhythm
My lines sustain like a crane, so uplift them
(slow and smooth) Flowin like fluid
The mass did worship the lyrics the three did
(amid all crisis) Drop it like a guillotine
(You're moist) fearing the voice of the rhyme fiend
Scene is zipped, Pete Nice is your worst dream
Fulfilled your illed I thrilled (I heard a LOUD scream)
My mind is cued, so I run down a menu
That downgrades the weak as my lyrics tend to
(the needs of a shaker, sweatin to the point of exhaust)
So listen to the mission horse
Blinded by the science, my mind starts flexin
Sexin down females to the A.M., perplexin
A complex reflex (you wonder if we slumber)
The three don't sleep (Aiyyo Pete Nice take em under!)
Steppin to the A.M., I'm steppin to the mic
To snatch up and smash up the club until daylight!",https://genius.com/3rd-bass-steppin-to-the-am-lyrics
Sons of 3rd Bass,The Cactus Album,1989,"""Here's my advice to all amateurs plannnnnnnning to give a performace:
Speak up, and keep the act moving""

Servin the role, a sole step-child
Talk of C.C. or keep sleepin
While wakin up to noise of 3rd B-A-S-S, Bass
Success is butter for Serch's space
Spoken slang gets played like the lottery
Your lyrics are incorrect, so you step to me
Lookin for the key to release that first piece
Three times two is six, Pete is one-three
I'm the other half, known as the other trey
Tourin to wild screams, the Third Son's born
Swarm to the lyrics cause Serch is your father
Screaming ""Hey Ladies,"" why bother?
* DJ Richie Rich cuts ""
How can you be so stupid?
"" *

Sons, slim ones flee from the 3rd
Words, spoken, a silver spoon stuck in the throat
Young useless, lyrically careless
Rhyme revolves around modes of mindless
If everyone spoke of stick-up, it's pick of a Beast'
Prone to a lick of a waste
Taste the flav' of the original
Orphaned trio, abandoned by lyrical
Through us, the echelon exposed with the roll with no soul
Counterfeit style, born sworn and sold
Out with high voice distorted
If a Beast' to wish play fetus, I'd have him ABORTED
* DJ Richie Rich cuts ""How can you be so stupid?"" *

Put to bed, three kids to a third track
Cap the front and grip, when they heard that
The crew from the L.Q. stepped to the Club Mars
Shook the Beast' and soon to be dubbed stars
Starring roles stone-faced from the brothers
Ludicrous whining, meaning when the others
Stand by em, while they take the fall
The Beast' now lives in the Capitol
Record wrecks sets, Def Jam a true wrecker
The label is nothing but MC Black'n'Decker
Three boys buggin to the A.M
You step to the Serch and I slay ‘em!
* DJ Richie Rich cuts ""How can you be so stupid?"" *

Negative mind, paid as snakes who can't rhyme
Play the dude? It's sucker time
I stand I take a bust in my nut
And gave birth to three bastard sons
A record label, a King to 4th letter
Passin phases, non-legitimate trendsetters
Pop figures, who figured they'd get paid
Exploitin art the black man made
Played out hardcore flaws, step to stage
Your biggest fan, nine years of age
Broke out cause the swindler took your ducat
No talent on the tune, you might as well SUCK IT
* DJ Richie Rich cuts ""How can you be so stupid?"" *
 Yo Serch, you know about that slum I'm speakin on?
 Word is bond Pete, school em!
 You know about that silver spoon havin
Buckshot acne showin, L.A. weak-ass sellout
Non-legitimate, tip-doggin, Jethro pseudo intellectual
Dust-smokin, 
pretty boy playwrite posin'
Folks wiggin, whinin annoyin Def Jam reject devil
White bread no money havin slum village people clonin
Step children!
 Sam Sever, serve the rest
Yo Sam, sc-hool em!
""
He is stupid, but he knows that he is stupid
And that, almost makes him smart.. let's listen

Wordz of Wizdom,The Cactus Album,1989,"""And so, my fellow Americans
Ask not.. what your country can do for you
Ask what you can do for your country""
President John F. Kennedy
""And now, back to New York""

Heart as, hard as, Chinese arithmetic
Avante garder, not a heretic
Figure out a right rhyme, stick it in my cranium
Pete Nice, elemental like uranium
Throwin joints, blowin like a cool breeze
Swimmin in, I lift on juice, I wax MC's
These hoes go frontin on my Jimmy
I smack em on the back, sit em down, say
""Gimme some rhythm"" (Rhythm!) Baby loosen up my collar
I'll lay you out, like a funeral parlor
Ready willin, fillin, killin for a Billin, Top
I never stop, with Serch and Sam drillin it
Soul in the Hole, MC's workin
Kickin it, vickin, the suckers who be jerkin
Me and my posse are hardcore, you want some more
Reason that I'm squeezin your girl (You never please her!)
So I pleased, then I threw her in the gutter
Cut her off, my wisdom wiser so I muster
Rows of all opposed, lows conquer all
Those who pose as dope I say nope, I wear def clothes
Dapper like Dan from, three the hard one
Never stigmatize as a rapper or I'll slap ya
You're stung from my tongue as you run from the drum
(Diggy drum) Three the hard way, wordz of wizdom
""This time there was three""
""One two.."" ""Three the hard way!""
""This time there was three""
""One two.."" ""Three the hard way!""

A branch of the hip-hop tip grills your dome
You're toe ingrown low showin you ain't got nobody home
Prone to the microphone, light up, and take out
Make out your will Bill, three is gonna break out
The stylee, me and P-E-T-E
Embark on a mission that's deadly, break out the ammo
Ay, yo, Sammo, hook up the beat
And I'll lay the plan OH man
You just got taken, I took a head out
Attack on the back of the six of the Guinness Stout
Usin abusin, those of the past tense
Funning gunning, but I'm summing up the nonsense
Three, the hard way, cards laid are OK
Gettin up and settin up, just for a payday
The minister, sinister (I ain't no devil!)
Not a snake slithering scoundrel Sam level
This track to SMACK, the smile off a doubter
The brother's, another MC who's about
Frontin like he's buntin, deceivin the delinquent
Rappers on track, bustin out a medium
For those opposed, who manifest a diss
Pete tell em: ""Manifest THIS!""
Not righteous, but might just, make you wanna listen
Yo I'm Elvis with the wordz of wizdom
""This time there was three""
""One two.."" ""Three the hard way!""
""This time there was three""
""One two.."" ""Three the hard way!""

A ludicrous buddhist, Brutus when I do this
So true to this, perpetrators view this
Style, empirical, lyrical, it's critical
Three the hard way, boy you need medical attention
I'm like a surgeon in my left hand
Hold a microphone like a scalpel so you understand
Wordz of wisdom, woven like a spider
Bitch on my tip, I get busy and I ride her
Uptown, then I drown her like a psycho-pathic
Cause I'm graphic on the mic I never let go
Light skinner eat dinner like a soul man
Prove with the rhyme I'm down, Sam's hands
Transform strong (too strong) as a good pitch
Switch up the wizdom, it's a word which
Kicks out the Benzi in a frenzy it sends me
Up the Bronx River back to Brooklyn apprehends me
Like a d-tech bustin my man in the projects
I'll send you up North, I ain't gettin' respect
Prejudicial, your style artificial
As live as limb that's attached to a cripple
It's simple (so simple) eliminate you like Gotti
I chill in Bed-Stuy and drive a Mazzeratti
With the body of a freak on my side, how am I livin?
(How ya livin?) Larger than large, with the wordz of wizdom

Hyper-selective, Serch is attracting
Females who focus on the future, not slacking
Rhythmic it's too quick, feel it, I let it flow
Sam Sever seas'll submerge, so let it go
Throughout, or put out, lyrics like a d-valve
Speak up, a deeper meaning as I leak out
And seek out, a three the hard way endeavor
Pete Nice, Serch, produced by Sam Sever
Livin in my shoes boy, this is not Shoe Town
A showdown for Motown, it's a new sound
Lyrics that lick, the tick off a timepiece
Foamin at the mouth punk, you need a leash
What are you sick?? I'm a slick stupid scientist
Rhymin that you can't comprehend (but you're buyin this)
Record I'm wreckin, my homeboys are breakin
Hopin that you're copin, no slopin, I'm not takin no shorts
Cause I'm playin the high post
Ask any girl in the place, who's the fly most
Brother with a cover, shootin to my cribbo
The tease wants a please, girl screamin ditto
So I did this, I needed the bed rest
Hangin with the bangin on the strength, there's no contest
Physically or lyrically, it's my kingdom
Stingin em and bringin em the wordz of wizdom
""This time there was three""
""One two.."" ""Three the hard way!""
""This time there was three""
""One two.."" ""Three the hard way!""

Shammo.. hook up the def mix!
Hahahahahahaha...
Ahh, ahhahaha hahahahah tch tch tch

Brooklyn-Queens,The Cactus Album,1989,"* Daddy Rich scratches ""Brooklyn!"" *
* 3 bars of drum beats *
* Daddy Rich scratches ""Brooklyn!"" *

Real cool.. cause Brooklyn's cool!
Friday June the last day of school
Girls steppin to the mall to swing
Settin up dollars for their summer fling
Cars on the avenue create gridlock
And there's girls like MAD at the bus stop
Not waitin on the bus, but waitin on the cash flow
Fellas are laughin, gassin the past ho
Girl steps to me and pushes issue
""That knot you got, is that money or tissue?""
Feelin on the bulge, thinkin it's her own
I tell her that it's money and she should move on
She says she's pure from her legs to her thighs
And we should talk over some chinese and fries
I tell her to step, but hey that's the scene
Cause she ain't nothin.. but a Brooklyn Queen

""We are looking for 'Brooklyn'..
We are looking for the.."" Brooklyn-Queens!

State the rhyme, borough of Brooklyn
Otherwise known as Crooklyn
Freaks fortify flesh with gold
Ears hang trunk, in a slave hold
Walk past, don't get the time of day
Played like suede, on a summer sway
Conversated, till I made her laugh
Said, ""I'm Pete Nice.. you want my autograph?""
Oval Office closed as she heard this
She said, ""From 3rd Bass? I could do this""
Listen closely, slowly took a swig of intoxicants
Cause the Brooklyn Queen's a gold digger


Squared away.. with my digits and tonight's plans
When I feel a crab grab my right hand
Slapped her on the back, tried to calm her
Asking her, ""What's the reason for the drama?""
Her next move was straight out of textbook
""Haven't we met before?"" Giving me a sex look
Yo Wisdom, your lyrics are in bad taste
So I'm forced to give you nothing but the Gas Face
You better go, for hoppin on the cab or bus
Cause you're downtown and you're simply too fabulous
But get this, ain't this a humdinger?
She stepped to a retard sportin' a four-finger ring
Somewhere in the skin tight jeans
I'm gonna scoop the best of the Brooklyn-Queens


Last exit to Brooklyn I enter
Carefully the Queen holds my scepter
Gettin' numb like a Derelict on scotch
I'm Dick Lewis, cause baby I'm watchin' you
Scheme on a brother for a knot
To choose between the have and the have-not
Do you doubt the shade of vanilla?
I'll play Elvis and you play Priscilla
Oh he's no hero, better yet Billy Dee
Advertise cheap liquor for a fee
A Brooklyn Queen, rushes Russell Simmons
That's like Tyson rushin' Givens

* Daddy Rich scratches ""Brooklyn!"" repeatedly over drum beat *
* 3rd Bass says 'Brooklyn-Queens' (3X) *
 Who's on Prince Paul's cactus?
'Brooklyn-Queens'
 Hahaha, yeah check it out

The Cactus,The Cactus Album,1989,"3rd Bass deals with the first place
Of where your mind is
The kind of stuff that you want to smoke blunts with
Take pictures, like Allen Funt would
Snapshots get the crack hot
Good to get it, but don't sweat it
Cause if you pursue she'll chalk the cue
And boom, stroke the 8 ball
Stick and run and were having fun
Prickin' my cactus like I'm shooting my gun
Quickly 'til it explodes and I unload
The cactus

I stand for lust of quenchin'
Gee sit on cactus and rotate
Enough time to clock a digit
Ass so large it won't quit
So I step to kick to
The Oval Office in my intro
Throwin' low bass to the third line
A girl on mines a prop
So I found loops to hold
And then a boomin' butt to go
To go lo solo readily
It's the cactus behind door 3

The smart villain, chillin' like Gilligan
Out on an island
Fishin' with my string and bamboo
Caught somethin' in a see thru nighty
Might be a little tasty
A 300 pound white girl
No one to see this, boom, I dropped my fluid like a chemist
She's contained and I'm a lame brain
But doing the wild thing
Kicked the fat thing off of my swing
Larger than Jim Backus
It's the cactus

No boots your money spent
Last call for toxicants
One move to reach a throttle
Eyesight is through a goggle
I trips to the hype type
Good-looking in the dark light
It's appetizing to conversate
To a fossil pushing 58
All bags and her butt sags
In the desert no price tag
A household tool and a stank ho
The Cactus turned Hammer's mother out

There it is, RIF Productions has brought forth the cactus
Forget what you have heard, forget what you might have seen
'Cuz this is the new thing to swing upon in 80-deca
Sam Sever got the cactus
Pete Nice got the cactus
Tayshaun got the cactus
MC Serch got the cactus
Russell Simmons got the cactus
KMD got the cactus
(?) got the cactus
Ahmed and Otis got the cactus
Big Craig got a BIG ol' cactus!

Dante, he got a little itty bitty baby cactus!
...but he can still use it, ha ha ha haaa!

Product of the Environment,The Cactus Album,1989,"Alright coming up now another request (this one)
This time from the boys down at Anna's Pizza Paradise
A new arrangement of a great oldie in rhythm and blues
Verse One: Pete Nice (Prime Minister)
In the heart of the city you was born and bred
You grew up smart or you wound up dead
Things moved fast, but you knew the scoop
And your savior was a rhyme and a beat and a rap group
A modern day production of the city street
You said I didn't have it that I couldn't compete
So the sleeper did sleep but the sleeper shoulda woke up
Now you're in my sight, the buddha sess you smoke up
That's the element you carry your rhymes on
That style of rhyme won't let you live long
Cause a strong song to you is what I sent
Cause I'm a product, of the environment
Chorus:
There it is, black and white (2X)
Verse Two: MC Serch
On the streets of Far Rockaway Queens
Seagirt Boulevard, Beach 17
Redfern Houses where no MC would ever go
Is where I did my very first show
Had the crowd had the rhymes going, I never fess
(His reward, was almost a bullet in his chest)
And on that stage, is where I first learned
Stick out my chest to be a kid and get burned
You're so foolish, but I think you knew this
That on the the microphone punk I can do this
And doing this, is what life meant
Cause I'm a product, of the environment
Chorus
Verse Three: MC Serch, Pete Nice
Back in the days when kids were mack daddies
Striped Lee jeans
, playboys and Caddies
Long Beach, the M.O.K. center
He almost caught a bad one when he tried to enter
Our way
Bang!
Bum rush the back door
Then scatter, onto the dance floor
Me and my boys, skeezin the cuties
Never had static, cuz everybody knew me
Local DJ's, tearin up the wax
And out the corner, some kid gets taxed
After the party, crack open a forty
Vicked it from the store yo the man never caught me
Went up to the arcade, cranked the bass
And then the five-oh chased us from the place
Hop on the railroad, play the conductor
Everywhere I went, I always tucked a
Marker in my jacket to tag where I went
Cause we were just products, of the environment
Chorus
Verse Four: MC Serch, Pete Nice
I wanna tell you something that gets me kind of mad
...it's about my dear old dad
He's tired, and worn, and works a nine to five
Clockin thirty G's a year to survive
But I know kids who in a month or so
Make that money selling the llello
Pushin a drug, I can't understand
Destroyin a life with a buck in the hand
Play rotten slum chain, local street hero
But if you ask Serch, you're just a bunch of zeroes
Too bad cause when you're older, you won't have a cent
Cause you're a product, of the environment
Chorus
Verse Five: Pete Nice
You hear it in the strength of my voice and in my rhythm
Now you know, how I was livin
It happened to me, like it happened to Serch
Prime Minister Pete Nice'll kick the verse
In Bed-Stuy with my boy, Kiwai Height
The K to A Kingston, Wednesday night
To the Empire, show slammin
Open for Dana, crew flammin
Mouth open wide, or listening
Dumb dope with a forty in my system
Unprotected but respected for my own self
Cause of talent, no shade, or nothin else
A time of tension, racially fenced in
I came off (and all the brothers blessed him)
I left more than a mark, I left a dent
Cause I'm a product, of the environment
Outro: K.M.D. and Serch
Aiyyo Serch, skin is just a color of the mind and the soul
And a brother ain't a brother if his heart is cold, youknwhatI'msayin fellas?
Word
And I think we need a positive Kause in a Much Damaged society
Word up man nubians killin nubians, brothers just don't understand
Word maybe it's some of that crime that's stoppin the growin
The drug pollution and all needs to calm down
Word man, cause that's what we need, we need Griff Productions
We need a K.M.D. man to uplift the race and bring Kause in the beginning
And a Posse called Get Yours
There it is, to all y'all bigots who want us to bend
We're just products of the environment, peace!!
Hopefully...

""Guide you out of triple stage darkness"" -] Rakim, +I Ain't No Joke+
And Chuck D saying ""Follow the now!"" *
""Prime Minister!""

Black zone darkness, void as snakepit
So I'ma spit a lyric at the packed lip
Sit stunned I drum lyrics in your egg case
Space filled, darkness a blank face
Recognize unknown throne at deep depths
A Prime Minister incites a slow death
Of a rational thought through the physical
Triple Stage Darkness, first stage lyrical
Sight to see, a piece of the Serch-light
Truth is loose, lips slips to Twilight Zones
Prone to blurry vision
I'm 20/20 and your in-tune is in prison
Switchin from this track, move back in motion
Unaware of your own evolution
Regress through the tunnels and flee light
Illumination, the first stage, my birthright
* DJ Richie Rich cuts
""Guide you out of triple stage darkness"" -] Rakim, +I Ain't No Joke+
And Chuck D saying ""Follow the now!"" *

Deaf, dumb and blind, the 3rd Bass find
You move further away from the swine
As I rhyme in effects your slide into tape decks
Light black in your face, what do you do next?
The question posed -- you're livin in delirium
Serch speakin in a spasm, can't you see him?
But you can't see the light's dim, it's growin darker
Cut off from the knowledge, un-smarter
Depart from the norm, completing a born to born
From opportunity, comes a thunderstorm
That sets in, tricked by the trickster
The only way out is DJ Nite, or Prime Minister
You follow, but attention span is minimal B
Now you're lost, never thought of intellectually
The 3rd's word, guide you as we spark this
Cause you're blind in the second stage of darkness
* DJ Richie Rich cuts

As I move, I soothe like stimuli
Not professor of hype, ask why
Some fable'll hold true to written word
Over lessons of life, the 3rd of Bass
Face up, step to a devil
Not takin, but remain invisible
Men judge by passin a mountain
Called Caucus, and ignorants are mouthin

Fallacy, the great wall, fell in disgrace
How can hatred uplift a race?
Not a dribbler or watermelon picker
Givin you the Gas Face, as I'm dickin ya
DOWN DOWN DOWN, but up from Sa-tan
Knowledge is a child with a mind and a crayon
Brilliance in difference, tracin true sight
Third stage knowledge, brought forth a new light

Herbalz in Your Mouth,Derelicts of Dialect,1991,"Don't drink the milk (why?) IT'S SPOILED!

Eyes slow to open, alarm clock's broken
I'm steppin out the bed but ain't a booty line spoken
Stick a 40 to my lips, I sips and I guzzle
A 40-dog ""Breakfast of Champs"" it ain't a puzzle
Grips on my feet and step out my rest
I meet MC Dope Incredible and DJ Fresh
They got a demo; fiendin for my headphones
So I throw it my system but it's so-so
I said, ""The weebles wobble, but I dabble in verbals
The movies that you're makin get the herbalz""
This ain't a Prince Paul loop from The Turtles
It's just 3rd Bass givin y'all the herbalz
Herbalz in your mouth (there it is, there it is)
Everybody say herbalz in your mouth (There it is, there it is!)
Everybody say herbalz in your mouth (There it is, there it is!)
 Hold up! Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down
Herbalz in your mouth (say WHAT?)
Everybody say herbalz in your mouth (there it is, there it is)
From the North and to the South (there it is, there it is)
 Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down

Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down
But them herbalz, they bobble and you see them all around
Them 501 blues can't hide the red apple
When I'm in a bodega, buyin some Snapple Orange Iced-Tea
Skins are playin nicety behind me
Scatterbrain no-name do you mind G?
Spot the profile and slips in the Serch zone
And wants a description of the bone -- hold up
Wants a description of the bone?!
Play AT&T and check the three on your telephone
D-E-F, then I left to break South
And left a herbal in her mouth
Herbalz in your mouth (there it is, there it is)
Herbalz in your mouth (there it is, there it is)
Everybody say herbalz in your mouth (There it is!)
 Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down!

Herbalz.. HERBALZ! Ha ha ha
Herbalz..
 Weebles to the weebles to the wobbles - to the herbalz
 I don't drink milk when it curdles
 Cause then it's too pasty, French like pastry
 It's like gettin caught boostin at Macy's
 True indeed, Cogswell Cogs, and Sprockets at Spacely's
 I make like George, and Jet-i-son safely
 to my rest and not a Tribe but I'm Quest'n
You got bad breath, then take a Certs with Retsin
Dribble dribble drabble say what, I beg your pardon
Quincy ain't convinced me, got my own ""Secret Gardens""
 So now we boomin out the speakers and amps (true)
Buggin your nuts like the PMS cramps
Some falsified but I gots bones to pick
The only nine you ever seen was in arithmetic
Herbalz given, how you livin?
 Yo I ain't played like a pseudo
 Herbalz in your mouth, and mine are macanudo

Got herbalz, where they at?
Got herbalz..
Herbalz in your mouth yo where they at they in your mouth

Never had a wasted mind, had the time
Erectin' rhyme, I cause gifted lines
The flows I knows puts the papers in pockets
Swings of things, observed in my sockets
In ten spot I got stacks of LP wax
Couderoy slacks, loops and sales tax
On the racks but my label is Derelict
Spic-n-Span I slam, it's balls you lick
Ill missions, but doin' us ain't even simple
Stereotype the rhymer as a criminal
Subliminal I put a noose on the necks
The sinister signs of my rhymes is sex

""Menace to the neighborhood""
""Menace to the neighborhood""
""Menace to the neighborhood""
""Menace to the neighborhood""

Smooth, set-up so slick
As I set to move, all the great masses
Asses bounce to track that is all in
I'm droppin' my quarter, I'm placin' my call in
To my crew that's down with the street trends
Play around and you'll fall off the deep end
I heard your hooker she likes to do knee-bends
But I got a girl, so I called up three friends
And they called three friends (and I called three friends)
And so on, and so on, and so on..
So go on my path, and try to follow
But not step for step, 'cause I like to sidestep
You'll get swept like a broom and you'll make room for daddy
White boy in New York and I can't get a cab, G
So take me to my rest so I guess I'll get wrecked
'Cause I'm a derelict of dialect

""Menace to the neighborhood""
""Menace to the neighborhood""

Dialect spoken, in sectional lesson
The less you know, the more you gotta guess on
I press on point, some sweat my jizznoint
Playin' themselves with the fingers the point
I speak slow, I carry a fat stick
Get your kneepads and reapply your chapstick
Step to this, as the Derelict reanimates
No jim hat as my mouth ejaculates
I stays mumble, I speaks jumble
Phonetics on phonograph'll prime your petrol
Retroactive, my knot scale is tipped off
I rip the head off, the Derelict stepped off
And left to show this, to those who typecast
Ill the rhyme-ass trickster or outcast
Of intellect, I wreck shit with my own sect
The ace in the hole, I'm the Derelict of Dialect

""Menace to the neighborhood""
""Menace to the neighborhood""

3rd Bass, but not a bass for slidin'
Foundation, for a nation who's mind is
In motion, goin' in fluid
Who did you just distrust? It's Serch and I crush this
Mental need for oppression
Oppressed and all vexed and just placed a suggestion
Lesson or loss enforce those in
A spot who got your head frozen
Defrost the eye and spy on the serpent
On act two, he tried to close curtain
But intermission I glimpsed and I clock more
Derelicts watch act three and the encore

Try to gel
 Yeah dat
 So you know we gotta we gotta rip this
 Serch let's go kick that shit G
Drop it right here
 Right here, like an asshole
 One two
 One two, ya don't stop

Grooves get kicked as Serch tries to flip like coins
Pain, like the foot to groins
3 Strikes but I didn't gel the head yet
Why you still vexed over things I haven't even said yet
Yo Pete, put you part-time like temps
Scale like a fence, put you in the past tense
You tried speedin but you ain't fast enough to chase me
So what I did this, ?? bring the kit to Ben Casey
And don't waste time
Dopest tracks, so why you gonna waste rhymes?
I absorb like a sponge in the bozack
I'm trifle, get the rifle, or I step back and crack slugs
And my crew give pounds and hugs
Tugs on my shirt, let me know that I'm still pro-fessional
And at the end of the session, you'll know
That the 3rd'll disturb the verb with the noun
Shift the sound, so GET UP AND GET DOWN, 
Serch'll never stand still
Try to flam I'll be like Claude Van Damme and just kick em in the grill

Missin the points of ?? spliffs
If you wanna gamble, let it flow
I ain't Al Jolson and Sambo
Low like a buddhist sniffin ? tree
But that booty fat bass it ain't movin me
To be or not to be on, your FM
Step to the AM, the gimmicks, I'll play em
I say em while I'm takin 40 swigs
A Chinaman eats with two twigs
Called your numbed, 9-7-0 PISS
Goodfella, you can tell you're on my hitlist
For this I stick like a splinter
Play ya like a sphincter cause my title's Minister
Serch said kick em, 
I gas em and trick em
Rhymes like ??, now Chubb, stick em

Jump jump with the man with the plan
, Chubb Rock
You know, 
a judo, a chop chop chop
From stereo monarch rationalize the grammar
It's like that and ah.. and ih.. ih.. if I stammer
Or sa-st-stutter, english found in the gutter
Or the sewer, while I talk like Pete Puma
How many lumps do you want inside your coffee?
Isn't about time, isn't about time, you stepped off me?
Yo Chubb - are you the best, are you the one
That ?? large chest, well, nevertheless my
Finger won't do the walkin through cleavage
I got a girl of my own, she's at home
Chubb is not conceited, I'm convinced of the fact
Vanilla sold seven million copies of some shit that was wack
He can wrap, his lips around a big black cock
He needs no more press, let me stop
Cherry crusaders, clean clairvoyany concepts
Claiming critical conversations that came in..to view
Of 3rd Bass mixed with Chubb Rock until
We kick the motherfucker in his, umm

The light goes up, my mic blows up, the silence is now sound
Hearin and fearin, the momentum of the stutter step
Shook to the left, because the brother slept
Crept into his ego, so he caught a bad one
Switched my next flip, he thought he had some grip
But my grip, is when my fingers curl around the mic
I know what it's like, a dog eat dog world
But I'm a carnivore, out on the parquet floor
Whether ballin, or callin out a sucker who is lookin for
Static, me grab it every chance I get
One on one I'll never run and shoot the high off the net
This position isn't switchin, pitchin out a blind pass
Hindsight, my mind's right, time run through the hourglass
Serch is my name, the game and my goal
3rd Bass settin soul in the hole
Yo man, why don't you give me the pole man?
Why are you freezin me out?
Yo man, cause you can't play, you ain't got no handle
Got your socks up to your knees like Michael Raines

Drip liquid, pick up a park pill
Enduce a hand over freeform with this skill
Spills are spun, a crossover breaks legs
Sugar brother the pavement says
Schemin' on suicide to play post I slash
First step... I shook ya ass
Step to wayside, ain't no weak side
Bassline I'm never givin, on the flipside
Grass to a mic like a hand palm rubber
Roll off a finger, you're gum, I rubbed ya
Sweep like a Knickerbocker, the 3rd stops ya
And after dark, I play the part of boot knocker
Twenty-four seven, always out to get some
Slap her on the concrete, bleed til the hand's numb
A way of life found, a rim stuck to a pole
An asphalt jungle, soul in the hole
Yo man, I got next!
Next? You ain't got next man
Yo go over there in the corner, with Michael Raines
And take a couple of tokes of the pipes man
YouknowhatI'msayin?

Point is in effect, callin for a play out
Lay out the plan, but your scammin for a way out
Figure of speech, spoken wise for a drum, three on one
Tchk! You know the outcome!
Point up the joints up, straight up for an uproar soarin
Then you execute the score, then you fade away
This fade has been played
Gave the gift swift, you just got self-made
Execute performance, the 3rd step upon this
Me and Pete, complete, like sex endurance
Tip on the rim you reverse and rehearse
Coachin but you're slouchin, you can't be first
You want the rock? But you don't got the handle
I drop the French, cause Serch grilled your mantle
Face intense, you're sellin your soul
Just for the action of soul in the hole

Pavement bounce off metal meets human flesh
Slum onside stagnate you got next
Each day evident, parks brothers throw down
One on one, it boils down to showdown
Spins reverb, soothe he goes a rip slip
By his larceny, or petty theft
Spectators move, lips into motion
Pop shit, get hit, the sewer then becomes an ocean
Water runs, springs and I let it fly
Slide a weak side, into vein
Try to terminate silk textures, of the fingertips
Three bases covered, as I dip
Deeper into repoitoire, the Minister an innovator
Take a sphere and a mic and I'll step later

Portrait of the Artist as a Hood,Derelicts of Dialect,1991,"Today I'm prepared to bring specific charges
Against certain members working in an industry
That reaches into every household in the country

Hoods is up so skills is up
It's a stick-up, so why'd you interrupt?
So such bust material cerebral
I'm eatin' cereal with spoons, sippin' Cepacol
Daddy-O slipped me some cause my breath stank
White gold, but no accounts in Swiss banks
Think tanks once rolled on the city streets
I used to meet your moms between the sheets
Universe is versus hoods prospectus
True flam, flammin' words on wax discus
So they dismiss this as vulgarity
And once laughed and pointed at the university
Some perk without skills and push a pen
I send surreal scenes where you never been
Looked out, gave you three strikes, you struck out
Pop shit with the 3rd, knock your fronts out
Blew your blunts out you wings stuck up your ass
Gassed you up then slap you with my staff
I seen your skins like to go to the motels
But your ass won't know to the hotels
Cause a lip is zipped, I paint pictures
A portrait, a self far from tipsters
My discussion of impression ain't ignorance
So don't label the hoods on appearances
You never thought that a gangster could talk sense
But this artifice flipped, your beans is spent
Took your papes out your pocket and just stood out
The focus, the portrait of the artist as a hoods-up

Portrait painted back in the days
Young strays, posted at the L.Q. on Fridays
Waitin' for Dice to give the go ahead
Hawkin' 50 cent, puttin' heads to bed
For a herringbone hear the tone of the Audio Two
Milk was chillin' as I chilled in the back room
Listening to Snaps pushed by Scoob and Scrap
Union Square, to tear up the KRS tracks
Torn up by the Kent, the Clark Dark
As the brothers try to spark
We knocked boots, and the boots got knocked
Three A.M. and it was off to The Rooftop
Hip-Hop Starski, the Masters of Ceremony
Ka-ka-cracked out, was hookin' property
Five A.M. it was the S&S
A hundred and forty-fifth street, down on Lennox
Starchild made all the hoes squeal
For a dollar crackheads Armor-Alled your wheels
Whippin' home in the sunshine, fun time
But now you can't find
Clubs like this that kept the music in the street
And pop rap couldn't get a dime to eat
Yo, they're makin' mills, but what about the hood?
A parking lot, where the Latin Quarter stood!
A landmark marked in the cranium
But now I bring it back in front of packed stadiums
Picture painted with the goals and the good
The portrait of an artist as a hood

 Yo Pete man, yo where the hoods at Pete?
 Yo the hoods is in Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx
Money-makin Strong Island
 Yo can't forget Newark New Jersey
Philly, D.C
 From Detroit to Mobile Alabama
Memphis Tennesse Cleveland
 Yo, money-makin Miami, Chicago
East St. Louis got crazy hoods
 Oakland Compton Watts wearin the hoods
 Yo true indeed, Louisville
Boostin Houston got CRAZY hoods
 New Orleans, Seattle
 North Carolina cannot forget about Atlanta
Shockmaster Glen Boyd got crazy hoods
Listenin to his program
 And the hoods are holdin their joint
And they're out

French Toast,Derelicts of Dialect,1991,"All around the country cost to cost
People say what you like most
I don't want to brag I don't want to bost
I always tellum I like toast
Yeah toast
Yeah toast
I get up in the morning about 6 am
Have a lil jelly have a lil jam
Take a peace of bread in the slot
Push down the leaver and the whires get hot
You get toast
Yeah toast
Yeah toast
Now there's no seekret to toasting perfection
There is a dile on the side and you make your selection
Push to the dark or the ligth and then
If it pops to soon just press down again
Make toast
Yeah toast
Ungh toast
When the first cave man drove in from the drags
Didn't know what would go with the bakon and the eggs
Must have been a genus got it in his head
Plug the toaster in to the wall buy a bag of bread

Oval Office,The Cactus Album,1989,"""This recording, is a collection
Of unintended indiscretions before a microphone""
""Oh who locked the door?""
""A hard man is good to find.""
""Open the door!""
""The principles.. of friction""
	This feeling's a function, so step to this
	Ain't the average boys who do this
	Door is opened, to office summoned
 Yo Pete I think you're in there man! (""I'm coming!"")
	Reception warm, not a handshake
My hands shook, barrier's about to break
	She was seated, legs long and slammin
	Oval office opened, so let's begin!
Push my point across, firmly
	Core proposal
	Prime Minister serve me, surely (""Surely! Nyuk nyuk nyuk"")
I serve you with motion
And doors open wider, coast in
	Secretary said, ""Put Serch on line two..
Yo, put him on hold!""
""That towel was related to my husband!"" (repeat 4X)
*  - speaking in background *
Aiyyo Pete man, let me in man
I'm here to get retarded yo, so step off
Nah I'm not holdin the door to come in
Yo, yo move your, move your elbow!
Move your elbow, yo, you're not dickin on me
Your boy look like the Great Pumpkin
You're frontin like you play the Pumpkin
Move your elbow, because I'm IN THERE!
	The meeting rotates
	Mockneck or cactus?
""They got my head boss..""
	She attacked us!
	With a treaty for disarmament
	We signed
	Figured there's no harm in it (""Oh alright alright alright.."")
So I disarmed
	And I poured the Scotch
And asked the Prime Minister, mind if I watch?
(""Oh my goodness!"")
	Yeah, I reckon
You keep minutes, I'll let you get seconds
Then the summit rose, I get vetoed
Presidential pardon, let me G yo!
	Lunch became filet of soul/sole with tongue
	The Oval Office work is never done!
	Never done!
""That towel was related to my husband!"" (repeat 2X)
*  -  speaking in background *
Aiyyo I'm serious man, did you have sex?
Nah man
It was you that did it!
Filet of sole on the Oval Office
On a peanut butter leg
Yo..
She got down to my knees and it spread!
""That towel was related to my husband!"" (repeat 2X)
	G'in, seein, have you playin it like a diplomat
The Oval Office ain't nothin but a boot magnet
	Close to close, but Pete freaked it anyway
	Serch said
	Prime, let's do the three the hard way!
	And knockin like we're knockin
	BOOTS!
The office flooded with the sex check suits
Deploy missiles of the MX variety
	Spoken spasm of invasion inside of me
	I release my rebels, the onslaught ceased
* woman moaning ""uhhh, uhhh, uhhh, uhhh"" *
And in the Oval Office
	Finally peace!
Motions carried out, played it like Presidents
	What's the Oval Office?
	Our permanent residence!
	Meeting of the mind, as well as the pelvis
	Aiyyo Bush!
	We're outtie like Elvis!
Aiyyo Serch you're in there man
You're finally in there, for the first time man!
""Victims of these classic boners..""
Yo move that thick body of yours
Move that thick white body!
""Victims of these classic boners..""

Yes, yes -- WOOOOOODIEE!
I've got the woody!
I've got the woodie -- and I'm gonna get the head
""Victims of these classic boners..""
I can feel it!  You gotta understand see
""Victims of these classic boners..""
Gotta understand the subject of the topic
There's too much butt-waxin, no --
There's too much vaseline usage
There's too much KY jelly
Cause I've got the WOOOOODIEE!
I have the woody man, I have
Yo let me tell you somethin man, you're a GIRLIE MAN
You're a flabber man, I am a muscle man
I think you are my auntie
Cause I am the man who is in the Oval Office
You're just a GIRLIE FLABBER MAN, you hamster man
I'm a great man, you're a flabber man
Uhh, aiyyo yo you know what I heard?
I heard Rob never got the wood
I heard Rob is frontin like the Great Pumpin on the woodie
And I heard Seth Lover?  He got the WRONG woodie
He needs the positive... WOOOODIEEEE!
Aiyyo I'm goin home man; I'm goin home to tell my mother (BOOTS!)

Microphone Techniques..
Please check it out..

Get up everybody, it's time to sway OK
Greg Nice is on the mic with no delay
Get up everybody, it's time to sway OK
Greg Nice is on the mic with no delay
She, said, her name was Lola
I, said, yo Lola, swolla
Soave Bolla, Ayatollah
Saudi Arabia, Coca-Cola
My Rolex watch is ran by solar
Get down, peep my mic technique
Let's freak let's freak let's freak to the beat
Checks get cashed, at the end of the weak
C'mon, Deck the Halls with skins and party
Gainin' weight cause I do eat hearty
When I wanna get tipsy I drink Bacardi
Greg Nice, I'm outta here, ghost!
""I'm on the microphone.."" (5X)

Uncle Fester, the bald head jester
Not me, the Minister, the mic molester
Five-oh arrest a G, doin' ill deeds
Took a ho to pull out the weeds
Droppin G, the case court is to hobos
Kickin' the bobo, chewin' on a Rolo
Ain't a Volvo with no paid promos
Sippin' cocoa and rollin' up momos
Fee-fie-foe-fum and 808 drums
The buns ain't mack 'cause your breath hums
No Funky Drummer loops of past summers
But you can't stop the +Humrush+ hummers
Like Roto Rooter layin pipes like a plumber
Nice and Smooth 'cause Three's a prime number
I go brick church buildin' when I'm sleepin'
So flip off my tip, I rip the mic techniquein'
""I'm on the microphone.."" (6X)

I praise the Lord that I'm no longer a vandal
Kiss my daughter goodnight, then I light a white candle
And sit back and meditate
Evaluate, appreciate
'Cause I didn't have to be here, on wax
Unveiling a truth with proof of all facts
'Cause in my life I see the life of many others
Various shades of colors, sisters brothers
And once my soul leaves my bodily shell
I believe to receive a new veil
Of some conscious subconscious abode
Chose by few on the positive road
A man is judged by the goodness of his heart
So who's to say who's dumb and who's smart?
Aiyyo Serch (Whattup?) I came to hear you speak
Get on the mic and flaunt your microphone technique
""I'm on the microphone.."" (7X)

Watch me shine til it's time for sundown
I had a scuffle with a kid it only went one round
I got a girl so there's no need to sex a ho
But I gas em up just like they're at Texaco
Ring goes my phone, so I pick it up and say, ""Whattup?""
Somebody's flippin', so I tell him to shut up
Would use the F word, but Ice Cube got the copyright
So I'll make it +Funky For You+ with Greg Nice
And his partner Smooth B
Watch the Superbowl, just for Bud Bowl III
Then I watch Living Color, cause ""Homey don't play dat""
Money like my honey in my crib and it'll stay that way
The equality variety
You don't like it then you're gonna join the Dead Poet's Society
Try to flip on what this quartet speaks
And Serch will disperse, the microphone techniques
* discussion by the crew over the beat until the end *",https://genius.com/3rd-bass-microphone-techniques-lyrics
Monte Hall,The Cactus Album,1989,"""This place has everything, Come on...""

Tight fit, dim lit spot, is where I'm movin to
Sweaty but these slow tracks start soothin you
Light-skinned, steps into the picture
Program is fixed, the mix will let you get your
Hand around waist, face drippin from moisture
Strokin the neck, you suspect that she'll voice her
Approval, whippin and flippin your pelvis
Brothers step in, step off, you get selfish
Yours for the take-home, so she can take up space
At your place, but then you start to wake up
Groove goes to fade, introductions are made
Love my name is Serch, step for some shade
In the dancehall
""This place has everything..""
""This place has everything..""

Soulfully smooth, she slithered to a solo
Spot to drop her bass and I'll follow
Fiend on a focus, I spoke this figure of speech
Supposed to sway those who seek
Such wisdom, wildly workin towards a woman
Therefore she's drawn, to the other man's
Intentions of a G, tryin to stump me
Announced presence in the house of Mr. Puffy
Smoke filled the tight-packed system
A rack of skirt, kit for a victim
A three-stage pleasure on a principle
As I step and drop a syllable (yyyyo!)
A syllabus spoken by the 3rd on sss-swooin
A female, to impale, push-up, smooth and
Turn to spurn desire -- that all?
Another episode in the dancehall
""This place has everything..""
""This place has everything..""

Step to the A.M., playin a song slow
Low tempo kicks lyrics to those who show
A need to step to a def 3rd Bass man
A wink of eye, the smile of a face and I'm
D-O-W-N to send shockwaves
Up the spine, while the clock saves
Just enough ticks to lick neck to your lips
Mouth to mouth, palm upon hips
Sigh in pleasure, measures the heat up
Nibble my neck, the affection I eat up
Dine like a diner, hot enough to simmer
Jam comes to a close, come give a
Number of seven in regard to the residents
Told the mob that I slobbed and showed evidence
Lipstick on the grill, a digit to call
Another lovestruck, stuck to the wall
Of the dancehall
""This place has everything..""
""This place has everything..""

Steppin over heads that swayed
You move over and the record's played
Swayed over smoothly, soothin a listener
Undergoes wanted death of a dancer
To twist over you rises your liquor
Slight panic on a dancehall picture
Motion flows, scene gets hectic
Freakin bones like an epileptic
Melody moves scenario to chaos
Pursue principles and then you shoot livest
So-called, it's boots that rise and fall
Steppin to the A.M., in the dancehall
""This place has everything..""
""This place has everything..""
""This place has everything.."" *echoes*
""This place has everything.."" *echoes*

Green Eggs and Swine,Derelicts of Dialect,1991,"You do not dig them, so you say
TRY THEM! TRY THEM and you may
Try them and you may, I say..

Slave drivers on your dollar bills that builds upon your ignorance
Significant, you never beat one-two one-two semblence
Since I ain't supposed, no boastin
I'm keepin soaps in my mouth like coke stem
For the silence of the swine, sittin slick on my slim chews
Liquor on the lamp, sippin booze as a cow moves
Lose my head over speak of a censor
Morse code but Three had no family credenza
Friends of mine align swine on the backstab
Grabbin greedy, now it's Rikers or rehab
My walkin stick just flips, it's a stick up
Misdirected like Charlie Babbitt, mixed up
Three-fifths, three-fifths, like this
He used to roll, a man with three-fifths, a man without his soul
So is this equal or blowin up your ass
Smoke sticks who got your vote and rather slit your throat
""Try them.."" ""Bacon souflee!""
""No I ain't gonna eat none of that""
""Try them.."" ""Bacon souflee!""
""No I ain't gonna eat none of that""
""Try them.."" ""Bacon souflee!""
""No I ain't gonna eat none of that""
""Try them..""

No no no, green eggs and swine
But they keep edgin to my plate, I step back and say
""Thanks, cause I just ate,"" not that I would eat it
Even if I was hungry -- all the ills of the streets
That could have done me in I stay clear of all the evil all the envy
And ex-homeboys who used to be friendly
Pretend to be down, but changin real fast
So heed the word, heed the word of my FOOT up your ass
Kickin a bone out, castin a stone out
Makin water ripple but got nothin the middle
So now you sit there, makin big waves
Talkin about my ancestors used to be from caves
It's time to wake up, bake the cake, and turn the page
For now is the birth, the birth of the mind age
We you and me -- all in a new time zone
And give you somethin much better to dine on
""Try them.."" ""Bacon souflee!""
""No I ain't gonna eat none of that""
""Try them.."" ""Bacon souflee!""
""No I ain't gonna eat none of that""
{I will not eat them with Prince Paul
I will not eat them with Low Rawls
I do not like green eggs and swine
I do not like those 3rd Bass rhymes}

My loops and loops and rhymes you never censor
I'm scramblin eggs on your family credenza
Attend to your owns or you're blown to bits
You're eatin green eggs while I'm swallowin the grits
You sits on your bony ass I'm passin on the rhythm, I give em
Gassin me, you try to geez I'll SWING em
Like a 40 ounce the choice is constitutional solutions
Arrest in domes of ignorannce full
I'm dickin down swine, I stick my neck out
Give a slap here, and shorty'll put your head out
Five G's explicitly you see the story tells
You put a sticker on my record and my record sells
Sam I am not, with the not but Sam Sever is
So the critics all think they know what clever is
I never seen you 40'd up at the corners Pops
So what a Senator knowin about hip-hop?

""No I ain't gonna eat none of that""
""Try them.."" ""Bacon souflee!""

""No I ain't gonna eat none of that""

Freedom of speech that is spoken in loose lips
To those who appreciate large tips, tippin the scale
Slum is in favor of the man who can't stand the live flavor
Bob's a jerk and he worked for the ex-friend
Not X-Clan, but wax get taxed even if it's bland
Branded for educated street credentials
And can't talk about life's bare essentials
Put it to plate, cause the plate they won't deny it
But won't give you a chance, or even a place to buy it
Cry for freedom, but music's not free, it's choking
Could never could ever could say what needs to be spoken
Put this out, before I depart
Before I hit the Killdrews, he started with the arts
I got much much better things, to do with my time
Than to worry about the green eggs and swine ""Try them..""

Here is a new hit, that some people don't get
Takin' it lightly, oh no that won't sit
With the Serchlite and the mic set to thrill ya
’Cause you ain't never seen this shade of vanilla
Drill like a sergeant and then I dismiss ya
You're calling En Vogue to hold on while I diss ya
Passing like Strickland ’cause I start to quicken
The pace, 3rd Bass, punk, you start picking
Up where we left off cause you shoulda stepped off
Instead of breaking out your sorry 
Slither like a snake, but here is a fact too
White poisonous snakes they can be black too
So don't boost the flex I know the deal
’Cause I've been around the world like that girl Lisa Stansfield
Next time you diss I just might say
Play like Johnny Gill cause you don't rub me the right way

Vic your ducks then vex like voodoo

I'm minister mini-stereo and sinister
Pumpin' macanudo like finster
MC's for moving crowds, you're milking cows
Grab the sack, sucking through your foolish mouth
Folks find me on a frenzy on a Prime one
Ripping hats off the jimmy gets the job done

Slurping shaft of a brother who has craft
Though he deals the 360 and not have

Gets like your S-curl is a mans look
Took the first pitch for a strike and ya try to switch
To goes through, the call from Richie Rich
Throw a hard slide inside to a lame brain
3 strikes, 5 Gs, end of ballgame

Boosting boots and suits for gym use
Talk or true it seems your seams are lose
Crank your pot, what I got is devious
A derelict, tongue slipped mischievous
Hose your ho like a hook and ladder hose
Scratched my ass and blew my nose
False prophets play venom seller
The cave dweller drops lyrics a capella
I can tell her to dance to that ill dance
Playing Major Nelson, but wearing those genie pants

Word To The Third,Derelicts of Dialect,1989,"Verse 1 MC Serch
In the heat of the night I step swift
Jettin to the spot that got the most gift
A who to do sittin in my drum loop
Pistol loaded and I'm ready to shoot
See my gun is my tongue and it runs like a track star
Not much happening but I got a fast car
E-x double vex and we're strong like sex
Cut the corner hit the next left
Reside to the westside a hole in the ground
Not paradise but a nice boomin sound
Party packed with nuff heads
Some black, some white some hood and some dreads
Surround the club, with the dub that swayed em
The remixed version of Steppin to the A.M
Played the club like a crumb to the curb
And this kid greased my palm and said word to the third
Verse 2 Pete Nice
You can flip my lip I throw joints out
Out the box I stop some for some doubt
Took you out last album I was steppin
Now your clickin on my gold disc and flippin
On the third fly is fingers and Kev swab
Seven signs on the walls your your head bobs
Mouths will move to this you ain't through with this
This ain't a suicide so why'd you grip your wrist
I take a listen to the lyrics I formed up
Slidin in the green hornet as I warm it up
Cause the third is like a lyric dispenser
For hire like Spencer but my trigger fingers tenser
My sixth sense getting loopy as a Soloflex
Turn to soupy and ask which duck is next
Hookin phrases clauses nouns and verbs
Steppin off set it off it's word to the third
Verse 3 MC Serch
P-E-T-E and me now step to the back
Tracks are stacked the party dumb packed
The sweat off my brow is glistening
And in the dance hall not one kid missing
A step while the non step don't step
They chill on the side or reside to the left
A mack daddy makin a move smooth
Whisper sweet nothings or something to soothe
The savage beast at least get the number to the residence
While you flash mad presidents
Crazy grants a few Jacksons
Grip got traction to show that your maxin
But she ain't down with the bum rush
And she better pick up moves off a lint brush
So you got played word to Herb
Don't slip money grip it's called word to the third
Verse 4 Pete Nice
As you move and your following the Serch-lite
Writing music up and fixin up the mix right
Some tight on the pockets and the being
I see em jettin from the 3 and deep fleein
Keyin up like a master lock picker
Figure that I stop cause I'm out quicker
Not Mr. Rogers I'm rollin with Mr. hood
Menace and doom not a friendly neighborhood
As a crew it ain't only me myself
Just the third knocking fiction off the shelf
Make your moves on 33 1/3
Daddy rich cuttin records of spoken words
Rollin up like this cause I'm pissed
You Serch what's the word oh yeah there it is
Or is it just a figure of speech Herb

No Master Plan No Master Race,Derelicts of Dialect,1991,"Set to decide, who's on the inside track
But you slack and so another dive
And you lounge - but who's shoes would you be in?
Wake up, it's time to respect the Nubian
Flag of a people, fightin every day
For their own say, so children can go out to play
And stray from the tyranny, while blood is drippin B
I ain't no flapjack, don't bother flippin me
I stick to this, so say this while you're grazin
Original man's a black man, said by a caucasian
Watchin a culture be stolen from Asia
Whether minor or major, science I swayed y'all
With lingo, some people don't think so
When do you stop sayin - that's the way things go?
Time to manifest the quest that's hard to digest
The companies are frontin Pete, why don't they divest
And invest in freedom, but they scheme on a brother
Stealin trunk jewelry that's MILES undercover
So discover as a people, we have to take our place
There is no master plan because there is no master race
""No ghetto, no master race.."" (3X)
""Let both sides, unite, in peace..""

Science for seasons, years and days
A preacher follows his prejudice, the drummer plays
Off the evils of men, love bones and flesh
A brother's keeper keeps puttin peace to rest
Question props and the prophets agreed, ya heed
Dust to dust, herbs yieldin seeds of
Creation of cultures to street sound
You get run around but I run the booty down
No master plan, the masses all struggle
Slug movements bungle, our serpent is subtle
Hatred born in diversity of culture spoke
Ignorance got the last straw, the camel's broke
Change up wisdom wise and stick to tools
One called slavemaster's son by a poor fool
I ain't the hypocrite fit with the two-face
There's no master plan, there's no master race
""No ghetto, no master race.."" (3X)
""Let both sides, unite, in peace..""

The creators creations are put to side
You see one wants greed and then slide
Into that all-about-me frame of mind
And keep the truth away from the blind
You gotta find out who is who and who built this place
I play spy and try to destroy the race
We go the wrong way, the wrong play master
The same people that got the +Gas Face+ last year
Tears shed as another head gets put to bed
Paradise is a paradox, the devil's ridin sleds
Over skulls, that dulls all the truth
It's the reason why we need to raise the roof
To look to the heavens as the master's one plan
We stand to help the birth, of just one man
The master's plan, the master's race shackled to a shelf
In a book that you need to find for yourself
I stand accused, but never abuse the Sunday
Cause when I'm gone I'll only go one way
""No ghetto, no master race.."" (3X)
""Let both sides, unite, in peace..""

I ain't a master, no I'm not superior
So why you tryin to play one as inferior
Fears in hearts of the ignorant belligerents
Ever since those convinced of lost innocence
Got off the tip slippin sticks and stones
Homes are broken or fractured like bones
Who holds your soul as the master your dollar spent
Evidence of dictators gone hellbent
In times of old the races vicked power many places
Seperate races in segregated spaces
Back in the day you turned your backs on
Deals in doom, so now the deally lays the cracks on
Sold more then sold forth from South to North
Swingin low on supremacy's corpse
Of course not steppin out of place is in place
Question those on the question of race
""No ghetto, no master race.."" (3X)
""Let both sides, unite, in peace..""
""Both sides begin anew the quest for peace..""
""No ghetto, no master race.."" (3X)

Problem Child,Derelicts of Dialect,1991,"Juveniles won't smile, vows are reckless
Sexless raceless souls unrespected
Hooligans and street urchins lurkin
Doin hoods, a neighborhood's worst person
Raises ? and the pushers and perverts
Butchers cut like cold cuts the mind works
Wise or weak on the weary and the wicked
Plagues a city street swell in evil-fitted
Man verse man, the haves against have-nots
House a kid for grips, leave him in his socks
Precedence of decadence is put out
Scramble hands full of merchandise he got out
Tooken taken a picture of figured strife
Subsisting on the minimal fruits of life
Attitudes are skewed from the right pile
Introduction of a character problem child
""Problem that I can't fix.."" (8X)

Kids makin bids cause they're products, so what?
You still get left with a donut
No such luck in the scam to make paper
Skiddin off the edge ya portrays a faker
Fakin the plans like the plans of mice and men
Lands a man a chance of one to ten
But the man ain't enough to legally drink
And guess what punk - your shit still stink!
Now you perp the role - the role of Frank Nitti
He ain't a hero cause he landed on the roof of a Chevy
So play the life of Untouchable
The fast life, the wrong life, and so much for
The criminal times but time rollin in reverse
I wanted to be older, before I saw a hearse
Take the weight off my boys who are buckwild
The life and death and times of a problem child
""Problem that I can't fix.."" (8X)

Problems problems of the Prodigal
End up on the page of periodicals
A pinnacle mess, movin blocks to sell blocks
Under locks and keys no G's clocked
He strays like a pig who don't fly straight
In the pen playin foul and third rate
Take a step back and meet your maker
See play your Maytag statistic on paper
Philosophy not of a giver he's a taker
Later words turn to dust he's the traitor
Sells you out for a quick fix dime drops
Got a chip on his shoulder without props
A bad seed leads himself the stray way
Puttin off evidence of Judgment Day
Judge not the culprit or pull the file
The life and death and times of a problem child
""Problem that I can't fix.."" (8X)

I step careful - into the next frame
Lame you're just a stunt playin a sex game
I start to wink, you think he's on your hightail
Frail you're shallow as you swallow up your bare sale
Tail stickin out like a bumper to a Maxima
Taxin a brother for a fee to get sex in a wetbed
Sheddin your gear like a snake does a skin
Begin to get slim as he's sexin you in
He moves deeper, asleep is what you thought he was
But he went bolo, so low you felt and that's because
The minute he got in and violated you and became ill;
Treated you just like a Flush'n'Fill
The next crisis, you're ice is clearin off your mind
Cause you're playin life from the CD of behind
Time to wake up can't you see that you're robbin wild
File this style as another of the problem child!

 Let me kick to you a fable bout my DJ Daddy Rich
 Born in Jamaica but had to make a switch
 So he packed up his 12's and he headed 'cross the sea
 Found a new rest on the road of Beverly
 That's Brooklyn
 Beatdowns, 40 dogs
 And the Brooklyn-Queens

Cool Daddy Rich is on the 1210 mix
Scratch needs a itch like a needle does a stitch

I switch up he flips up the wax with a mixer
Bookmakers step to the Father he's a fixer

Cool to the cut, shakin butts off the ledges
Came a longer way than Benson and Hedges

The measures and levels of rhythm and scratch peaks
Speaks with fingers, the master of Technics

Solo diesel Daddy now stands in front of you
Displayin the ills that build on the one and two

 We are collectin
 the papes
 of the drapes
 of the cuts he's selectin
 Yo Pete you got a question?
 Hmmmm, yeah I got one
Can anyone ever serve the Rich?
 Hmmmm, no not one
 To spin off, spin the twelve inches
 It's a brawl that'll call both teams off the benches
 Wenches that backed up, beggin for the number
 Those Brooklyn-Queens better get the Liquid Plumbr
 Like lumberjacks, swingin an axe
 Flexin the fader with the stomach in your back
 Set tracks aside for the performer
 Induce, and now I introduce the Rich former
{Daddy Rich continues to flex skills}
 True form be givin
 Yo, drive is drivin
 Got the jizz on your lip
 Aiyyo, how you livin?!
 All hailin the master on the outro
 Can anyone serve the Richie Rich?
 I DON'T THINK SO
{'That's my man throwin down'}

Wordz Of Wizdom (II),The Cactus Album,1989,"""And so, my fellow Americans
Ask not.. what your country can do for you
Ask what you can do for your country""
""And now, back to New York""

Heart as, hard as, Chinese arithmetic
Avante garder, not a heretic
Figure out a right rhyme, stick it in my cranium
Pete Nice, elemental like uranium
Throwin joints, blowin like a cool breeze
Swimmin in, I lift on juice, I wax MC's
These hoes go frontin on my Jimmy
I smack em on the back, sit em down, say
""Gimme some rhythm"" (Rhythm!) Baby loosen up my collar
I'll lay you out, like a funeral parlor
Ready willin, fillin, killin for a Billin, Top
I never stop, with Serch and Sam drillin it
Soul in the Hole, MC's workin
Kickin it, vickin, the suckers who be jerkin
Me and my posse are hardcore, you want some more
Reason that I'm squeezin your girl (You never please her!)
So I pleased, then I threw her in the gutter
Cut her off, my wisdom wiser so I muster
Rows of all opposed, lows conquer all
Those who pose as dope I say nope, I wear def clothes
Dapper like Dan from, three the hard one
Never stigmatize as a rapper or I'll slap ya
You're stung from my tongue as you run from the drum
(Diggy drum) Three the hard way, wordz of wizdom

""This time there was three""
""One two.."" ""Three the hard way!""
""This time there was three""
""One two.."" ""Three the hard way!""

A branch of the hip-hop tip grills your dome
You're toe ingrown low showin you ain't got nobody home
Prone to the microphone, light up, and take out
Make out your will Bill, three is gonna break out
The stylee, me and P-E-T-E
Embark on a mission that's deadly, break out the ammo
Aiyyo Sammo, hook up the beat
And I'll lay the plan, oh man
You just got taken, I took a head out
Attack on the back of the six of the Guinness Stout
Usin abusin, those of the past tense
Funning gunning, but I'm summing up the nonsense
Three, the hard way, cards laid are OK
Gettin up and settin up, just for a payday
The minister, sinister (I ain't no devil!)
Not a snake slithering scoundrel Sam level
This track to SMACK, the smile off a doubter
The brother's, another MC who's about
Frontin' like he's buntin', deceivin' the delinquent
Rappers on track, bustin out a medium
For those opposed, who manifest a diss
Pete tell em: ""Manifest THIS!""
Not righteous, but might just, make you wanna listen
Yo I'm Elvis with the wordz of wizdom

""This time there was three""
""One two.."" ""Three the hard way!""
""This time there was three""
""One two.."" ""Three the hard way!""

A ludicrous buddhist, Brutus when I do this
So true to this, perpetrators view this
Style, empirical, lyrical, it's critical (critical)
Three the hard way, boy you need medical attention
I'm like a surgeon in my left hand
Hold a microphone like a scalpel so you understand
Wordz of wisdom, woven like a spider
Bitch on my tip, I get busy and I ride her
Uptown, then I drown her like a psycho
Cause I'm graphic on the mic I never let go
Light skinner eat dinner like a soul man
Prove with the rhyme I'm down, Sam's hands
Transform strong (too strong) as a good pitch
Switch up the wisdom, it's a word which
Kicks out the Benzi in a frenzy it sends me
Up the Bronx River back to Brooklyn apprehends me
Like a D-tech bustin my man in the projects
I'll send you up North, I ain't gettin' respect
Prejudicial, your style artificial
As live as limb that's attached to a cripple
It's simple (so simple) eliminate you like Gotti
I chill in Bed-Stuy and drive a Mazzeratti
With the body of a freak on my side, how am I livin?
(How ya livin?) Larger than large, with the wordz of wizdom

""This time there was three""
""One two.."" ""Three the hard way!""
""This time there was three""
""One two.."" ""Three the hard way!""

Hyper-selective, Serch is attracting
Females who focus on the future, not slacking
Rhythmic it's too quick, feel it, I let it flow
Sam Sever seas'll submerge, so let it go
Throughout, or put out, lyrics like a d-valve
Speak up, a deeper meaning as I leak out
And seek out, a three the hard way endeavor
Pete Nice, Serch, produced by Sam Sever
Livin' in my shoes boy, this is not Shoe Town
A showdown for Motown, it's a new sound
Lyrics that lick, the tick off a timepiece
Foamin at the mouth punk, you need a leash
What are you sick? I'm a slick stupid scientist
Rhymin that you can't comprehend (but you're buyin this)
Record I'm wreckin', my homeboys are breakin'
Hopin that you're copin, no slopin, I'm not takin' no shorts
Cause I'm playin the high post
Ask any girl in the place, who's the fly most
Brother with a cover, shootin' to my cribbo
The tease wants a please, girl screamin' ditto
So I did this, I needed the bed rest
Hangin' with the bangin' on the strength, there's no contest
Physically or lyrically, it's my kingdom
Stingin em and bringin em the wordz of wizdom

""This time there was three""
""One two.."" ""Three the hard way!""
""This time there was three""
""One two.."" ""Three the hard way!""

""Three the hard way!""
""What does it all mean?""

No Static at All,Derelicts of Dialect,1991,"“No static at all...”

Beef not needed to waste one
'Cause trouble don't feed the bass drum
Some so feeble, so play the hoodlum
A humdrum liver in bedlam
Bet your last buck, you don't laugh to this
Your horse came last behind the cactus
Back so strong, you thought wrong a fallacy
The groove will whip and flip, 'cause it has to be
In there, like Belvedere in his underwear
On the new year, my dear, so make it clear
I'm gonna ask do you wanna live small?
Static? Nah troop, none at all

Why meddle in the middle of a ruckus
 sip slowly on Snapple in hand
Not these hands of mine holdin' clippers
Slip and clip your flat-top to Ceasar
Ease your ego, I go toe to toe
Throw my voice like I throw my yo-yo
And ho-ho-ho, on the mic, is life support
And toward a crumb static ain't my sport
I swing to this, Serch swings to that
And as you noticed, they always wear hats
Boots and loops produced by Prince Paul
Slaps ya skull, no static at all

Static mixed in, but it don't cling
To a fat rope dope Gucci link or an earring
Hand now gropin' for stabbin'
But the hand is used to get skins
Skim the cream, but it seems you still rise
For some who lives more, now life lifesize
All are lepers in my SwingDom
Groups and troops get friends and they bring them
In goes, props so pop til the mornin'
Home to the young, pop still snorin'
Wake up, you blockhead, and heed the call
Ay o, no static at all

I flip on kicks, my DJ tricks
The a.k.a code name Richie Rich
Daddy Rich
Daddy
Daddy Rich
D-d-d
Daddy Rich, you never watch him on TV?
Straight no takes, the iron had Eastbridge
Full on 1210's flippin' the beats
Some bust nuts, Daddy Rich bust cuts
Such transform over rhythms on dust
I rush this rhythm, hold like Mingus
I swing this joint, no static to sting this

A bitch's brew, who snappin' gyro

Scabs can't craft what only the fly knows

Got skins all in on schemin'

Scandalous hooks grab on to what's gleamin'

I'm seemin' vexed in my rhymin' texts

Opened up shop to chop off the hairnets

I put off punks like junk so sporadic

Stashed away like old drawers in my attic

Or drawers on my legs, figures what I says

Snack on Jolly Rancher or Orange Pez

Yep this ain't no collect call

So peace, yo Pete

No static at all!

Come in, to my cribbo, no reason you'll say ditto
No tea and crumpets, not servin' you no vittles
Little one sit, I'll kick to you a fable
So recline on the recliner put your feet up on the table
Sable is a fox that's used for coats
The sable is a fable cause you bought yourself a goat
Skin all in, so ease up on throttle
No role model and your life is out the bottle
The roll of the dice on the corner of the street
You get beat on 123rd street
Done by the system that ain't really sayin' nothin' new
Your kids flippin, so now what you gonna do?
Go home? Hell no, she don't want you there
Why need a man or even work when there's welfare?
Oh yeah, another scam, see?
The government's way to destroy the family
See life is a gamble, find the ball under the shell
Hell no, I kick two and make the dome swell
Son, that's the end I hear the doorbell ringin'
And if that's your pops, tell the man to just come in

Ask me why I wander on desert plains
I say the Cactus still grows without rain
Plain to see from my horse without a name
I set it off, still things ain't the same
A case of wasted life, inner city blues
Goods for hoods from the merchant of grooves
I move your butts but a question lingers
I look at my hands, I sees ten fingers
A finishin' touch, much on the Pete P
Hear the Three-R-D and the blind see
Why I flipped and why I ain't with the Klan
Which one you say all truth and
True indeed, y'all needs a speed knot
Knothead syndrome, sets off piano drops
{* Daddy Rich cuts and scratches *}
So I please, and step with Kool Poppa Sha
Scopin' every skin without a bra
On the streets, Kurious like Jorge
Why don't you make like Run and pause?
Flaws in characters, scrubs get done in
I swing it open y'all, so come in
