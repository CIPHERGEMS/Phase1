It Takes Two,It Takes Two,1988.0,"Right about now, you're about to be possessed by the sounds of emcee Rob Base and D.J. E-Z Rock

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight

I wanna rock right now
I'm Rob Base and I came to get down
I'm not internationally known
But I'm known to rock the microphone
Because I get stupid, I mean outrageous
Stay away from me if you're contagious
'Cause I'm the winner, no, not a loser
To be an M.C. is what I choose-a
Ladies love me, girls adore me
I mean even the ones who never saw me
Like the way that I rhyme at a show
The reason why, man, I don't know
So let's go, 'cause

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight

My name is Rob, I gotta real funky concept
Listen up, 'cause I'm gonna keep you in step
I got an idea
That I wanna share
You don't like it? So what, I don't care
I'm number one, the uno, I like comp
Bring all the suckers 'cause all them I'll stomp
Bold and black but I won't protect
All of my followers 'cause all I want is respect
I'm not a doctor, put them in rapture
A slick brother that can easy outfox ya
'Cause I'm Rob, the last name Base, yes
And on the mic, I'm known to be the freshest
So let's start, it shouldn't be too hard
I'm not a sucker so I don't need a bodyguard
I won't fess, wear a bulletproof vest
Don't smoke buddha, can't stand sess, yes

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight

The situation that the Base is in
I'm kinda stingy that's why I don't wanna lend
A funky rhyme to a foe or a good friend
But listen up 'cause I want you to comprehend
'Cause I'm the leader, the man superior
I take care of ya and then ya get wearier
So just sit, my rhymes are not counterfeit
The record sells which makes this one a hit
It won't hurt to listen to Red Alert
Take off your shirt
Make sure it don't hit the dirt
I like the kids; the guys, the girls
I want the ducats 'cause this is Rob Base's world
I'm on a mission, ya better just listen
To my rhymes 'cause I'm all about dissin'
'Cause

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight

I stand alone, don't need anyone
'Cause I'm Rob, just came to have fun
Don't need friends that act like foes
'Cause I'm Rob Base, the one who knows
About things that make ya get weary
Don't cheer me, just hear me
Out 'cause I got the clout, shout (Ho!)
Before I turn the party out
I won't stutter
Project my voice, speak clearly
So you can be my choice
On stage or on record
Go to the Wiz and select it
Take it off the rack, if it's wack put it back
I like the Whopper, fuck the Big Mac
If you want static, so let's go
So, throw up your hands
Go for what you know
Bro', I got an ego
Yo, talkin' to me? No, oh
'Cause Rob is in the front, EZ Rock is on the back-up
We're not soft, so you better just slack up
'Cause I'm cool, calm just like a breeze
Rock the mike with the help of EZ
Rock on the set, the music plays
Only cuts the records that I say

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight

All right, now, EZ Rock
Now, when I count to three
I want you to get busy
You ready now?
One, two, three, get loose now
It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a, it takes two to make a, it takes two to make a
It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a",https://genius.com/Rob-base-and-dj-e-z-rock-it-takes-two-lyrics
Joy And Pain,It Takes Two,1988,"Come on

Joy (Pump, pump, pump it up) and pain
(Come on, come on, here we go)
Like sunshine (What else? What else?) and rain
(Ah yeah, here we go)
Joy (Come on, come on, here we go) and pain
(Pump, pump, pump, pump it up)
Like sunshine (Yeah) and rain
Give it to 'em, Rob Base

Well, I'm the new kid, I'm just comin' up
A lot of rappers think that I can't tear it up
Well, I'ma show 'em and ignore 'em
And when they think I ain't lookin', I floor 'em
I mean take 'em out, I keep groovin'
A slick bassline keep the beat movin'
They can't take it, they just fake it
They wonder how the Rob Base make it
I get ill, you know the deal
'Cause this is how the Rob Base feels

Joy (Come on, come on, pump it up) and pain
(Pump it up, pump it up now)
Like sunshine (What else? Come on) and rain
(Here we go, here we go)
Joy (Pump it up, pump it up now) and pain
(Keep it goin', keep it goin')
Like sunshine (Yeah) and rain
(Pump it up, pump it up)
Give it to 'em, Rob Base

I keep smokin', hot like fire
You had your turn, now retire
Don't talk back, I'm not a new jack
'Cause I'm fresher than you, and you're wack
I keep tryin', I'm not lyin'
Up to number one is where I'm flyin'
I won't slow down 'cause I'm the new kid
With the devastatin' sound that hits
In the house where I used to practice
No one knew the Rob exists, but now
I'm gettin' greedy, don't lead me
The wrong way 'cause is just might, might, might
Bring me down, I'll have to fight to get back up
Move away 'cause I just won't slack up

Joy (Pump it up, pump it up) and pain
(Come on, come on, here we go)
Like sunshine (What else? What else?) and rain
(Keep it goin', keep it goin')
Joy (Yeah, yeah) and pain
(Pump it up, pump it up)
Like sunshine (What else?) and rain
Give it to 'em, Rob Base

Now, I go to shows to watch other MC's rock
And if they're good, I don't knock
The way they perform 'cause I like to see a good show
After that, go play ceelo, y'know
'Cause I'm a leader, no ,I'm not a follower
And MCs like you I swallow 'em
So don't look and try to judge me
Because you think that I'm another MC, well
I'm the new kid, I just moved around
But that don't mean I can't rip up the town
Me and my boys, we make noise
I hate MC's that think that we're toys
I'm hittin' harder than any other MC
Who try to come up and go against me

Joy (Pump it up, pump it up) and pain
(Keep it goin', keep it goin' now)
Like sunshine (What else? What else?) and rain
(Pump it up, pump it up now)
Joy (Keep it goin', keep it goin') and pain
(Yeah, keep it goin' now)
Like sunshine (Pump it up, pump it up) and rain
Let 'em have it, Rob Base, one time

Not from the old school or from the new
Applaud or boo, do what you want to
Talk to me then try to put me down
We used to be cool now we don't hang around
Used to be friends but now we're foes
Ask me why, man, no one knows
Maybe jealousy between you and me
Could be the fame, could be the money
I'm goin' for mine and I don't really care
'Cause the spotlight Rob Base don't share
I'm the headliner of this show
And you're just a kid and you need to grow because

Joy (Pump it up, pump it up) and pain
(Come on, come on, here we go)
Like sunshine (Keep it goin') and rain
Everybody sing along (Come on)
Joy (Pump it up, pump it up) and pain
(Here we go, here we go, come on)
Like sunshine (What else?) and rain
Give it to 'em, Rob Base
Everybody clap your hands now
Joy (Pump it up, pump it up) and pain
(Yeah, keep it goin' now)
Like sunshine (What else?) and rain
Listen to us sing now
Joy (Pump it up, pump it up) and pain
(Yeah, here we go)
Like sunshine (Pump it up, pump it up) and rain (Yeah)",https://genius.com/Rob-base-and-dj-e-z-rock-joy-and-pain-lyrics
Times Are Gettin’ Ill,It Takes Two,1988,"Artist: Rob Base and D.J. E-Z Rock
Album:  It Takes Two
Song:   Times Are Gettin' Ill
Chorus:
You got the time
Ta ta tata ta ta times are gettin' ill
Verse One:
Just last week I had a good thing goin
The money was flowin
I had a notion, I made a motion
To get a girl with love and devotion
I went to a disco...ordered a bottle of Cisco
Took a seat, and I looked around
Bobbin' my head to the sound
Of the D.J., OK, this is what I'm tryin' ta say
I heard a scream (AAAAAAH!)
Then a shot rang out (BOOOOOM...BOOOOOM)
That's when I got the hell out
Chorus
Verse Two:
Gettin ill, with the boys
Somebody yelled (KILL THAT NOISE!!!)
I didn't even front
Pulled out the brand new pump shotgun
He pulled first, that's when things got worse
I didn't wanna raaaaahd no hearse
So I pulled the trigger with a burst...of gunfire
He missed, I hit, and that's the end of it
Chorus
Verse Three:
There was this girl named Lisa
I was in love with her
This girl was superiuh
She had a Benz and a Audi
She was fly, but the girl was kinda rowdy
I couldn't understand, her plan
A girl like this didn't have a man
So I pushed up, and made my move
To the bass that was real smoove
I pulled her, and now I'm hangin' out...with huh
She offered me coke
I said no cuz I don't do dope
She got mad, started breakin
Started braggin bout the money she's makin
Off of sellin it, for the hell of it
To me it's not irrelevant
Chorus
Verse Four:
Sittin on a stoop with the rest of the crew
It was nothin' ta do
So we took a walk, through Central Park...it was dark
A car drove up, it was a Mercedes
Filled with a bunch of ladies
The driver was a guy, with a tie, the man was fly
He was a pimp, or a dope pusha
I could tell by the way he mushed uh
Girl in her face
She ran, he started to chase her
And beat her down, to the ground
While the other girls just stood around
We didn't like it...we got mad
He looked like he thought he was bad
Hopped in his car, and he drove away
This is what I'm tryin' ta say
I got the time
Ta ta tata ta ta times are gettin' ill",https://genius.com/Rob-base-and-dj-e-z-rock-times-are-gettin-ill-lyrics
Don’t Sleep on It,It Takes Two,1988,"Artist: Rob Base and D.J. E-Z Rock
Album: It Takes Two
Song: Don't Sleep on It
Emcees, tryin' ta play post, play me up close, brag and boast
Ya know
Things like that make me weary, but
I never let a rapper get near me, cuz
I'm Rob Base, pick up the pace
It takes more than beats to rock this place
It takes more than rhymes to rock this time
Rhyme for rhyme, the Base design
M.C.'s get mad, cuz I'm blowin' up
To every battle, the Base keeps showin' up
A fast tempo, a-with a hook
Don't judge a book by the way that the cover look
Cuz I'm mean, reign supreme
Wrote my first rhyme at the age of fifteen
I'm like a match, when struck I burn
Not concerned cuz I'm sure that ya won't learn
Now git up, and let's start
I wanna see which sucka got heart
I get fresh as I get older
Every time I rock I get bolder
So don't sleep, and say I'm wack
Cuz if ya do ya get backslap (backslap)
Chorus:
If it's not in your vision
Don't sleep on it
Don't sleep on it
Don't make a-no decision
TURN IT UP! (On the bass right now)
Drop your ego, and let me go
And just show what I know cuz I'm on the go
I rock smooth, bust a move, hit me
And the way I perform, you can't forget me
Clear off the smoke, this ain't a joke
The new kid on the block is like dope
Been here for a while, been all punishment
But now I'm on (I'mon), so let's start it
No I'm not retarded, or either crazy
I work hard, I'm not lazy
Rappers don't faze me, or eith-amaze me
Or either come up close and just graze me
Coolin', neva be a fool, and
Gimme just a little mo' time I be rulin
Tell it to the mack, cuz I'm on wax
But should I pay tac, or should I just act
To get a new job, yes, time is what I'm pressed for
Every time I perform ya want more so (so...)
Chorus
Aaaaaah, break it down, to get the dope sound
Then hang around with the posse from Uptown
On the Ave, they get cash
But I leave it alone cuz I'm a smash
On the mic, I think differently, a-from another or other MC who
Intervene, try to just rip up the Rob on the sneak tip
I get mad, they get sad, or either rag the had cuz I'm that bad
I'm not frontin', cuz this is my theory
You don't believe me, so just hear me
I rock harder, I rock longer
I do this cuz I gotta get stronger
A lotta rappers rhyme harder, and meaner
But I rhyme with the sound that's cleaner
""I ain't nuthin'"", that's what they say
Well OK if they wanna play that way
Cuz I'm Rob buttkickin' Base
What rapper's next to be erased?
On my list, I'm not known to diss
But I'll do it, so don't sleep on this, c'mon
Chorus
Hit it, admit it, ya did it, ya can't fit it
So forget it cuz I know you ain't wit' it
In the centre, I didn't rent her
Sat 'cha butt in the chair, got a splintuh!
Back in the days, amazed by the rap phrase
Rap today, to me it don't faaaaaaze me
I'm not another M.C., or angry by the way ya speak to me
Jealousy; what makes you wanna battle me
Dope beats; what makes you wanna idol me
It ain't nuthin' to me or E-Z
Cuz I'm the R, the O, the B, and he's E-Z
I bust a fee wherever it be, ya see
He or me, the E, the Z, the A, the B
Alphabet's from A to Z, ya see
I'm not tryin' to confuse your mind
I'm just tryin' to pump this plain old fresh rhyme
I stay calm, rap like a pro
I know ya know, so let's go, c'mon!
Chorus
Now E-Z Rock, you remember how we did it before
I want you to do it one more time, for ya mind
1-2-3, give it to 'em
If it's not (scratching)
Don't sleep on it, come on!
If it, if it, if it's not (scratching)
Don't sleep on it, come on!

Get On The Dance Floor,It Takes Two,1998.0,"Bassline!
Now, let's dance
Now, here we go, don't quit
Comin' from Rob is a new hit
A record that I created
For those of you who waited
In the disco, chillin'
Waitin' for Rob to get illin'
It's that time again
So friend, let the record spin
And I wanna move you
Let the beats just groove you
Clap your hands, don't front
'Cause this is what you want
Get on the dance floor!
Puerto Rican, black, white, Chinese
Come on, let's rock in peace
Get on the floor, get loose
Rock with the man with the juice
Okay, let's play
The records that I say
Get crazy, stomp your feet
Move to the funky beat
Of Rob and E-Z
With the help of the man behind me
This part I like
When the crowd get hype
Come on, here we go
As I rock the show
Get on the dance floor!
Break it down!
Come on! Move!
I got a witness, don't forget this
Count to three then hit this
Groove, that makes you move
I like the cuts to be smooth
I'm the innovator, now not later
Use the up and down, the cross-fader
On the mixer, rap as I fix her
You got a running nose, so get Vicks-a
Don't diss me, hit me, it only get me
Uptight, can I go get the posse
I'm like a star in the sky, I'm shining
Like a scientist I'm finding
A new chemical to get rid of you
It's not medicine, magic or voodoo
'Cause I'm rhyming, designing, timing
How long it gonna take to be climbing
To the top, make sure that I won't drop
'Cause I came to rock the spot
Get on the dance floor!
Keep dancin', don't stop it
With the beat like this, you can't top it
'Cause I made it to be hot
And soon it's gonna be on the top
The time is now, not later
Listen to the things I create-uh
I'm not buggin', and you know it
Do it now or you'll blow it
This is what I want you to do: move!
Get on the dance floor!
Move! Get on the dance floor!",https://genius.com/Rob-base-and-dj-e-z-rock-get-on-the-dance-floor-lyrics
