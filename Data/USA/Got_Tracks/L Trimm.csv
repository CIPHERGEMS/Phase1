Cars with the Boom,Grab It!,1988.0,"So many kinds, where can we start
We like them dumb and we like them smart
I like the ones with the pretty eyes
Well, I like all kinds of guys
Stop!
What happened?
How about the ones we especially like?
Which ones?
You know, the ones with the cars that go
(Boom)
I hear ya!
Hit it!

It was me and the posse with Bunny D
We were cruising in the Jags or the Lamborghinis
When lo and behold, there appeared a mirage
He was hooking up a car in his daddy's garage
We stopped short, did a double take
He was looking so fly I thought I wasn't awake
He was obviously hooking up bass I assumed
But then he turned the little button and the car went boom

We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny and we like the boom
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny and we like the boom

We like them short and we like them tall
We like them one and we like them all
They're always adding speakers when they find the room
'Cause they know we love the guys with the cars that go boom
And see my boyfriend really knows where it's at
He's got 50-inch woofers all along the back
He makes a comment on going to my room
But I'd rather stay out with his car that goes boom

We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny and we like the boom
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny and we like the boom

Now if your car ain't got it
Go out and get it
We like the boom
And don't you forget it
So turn down the treble
And flaunt your bass
So your car could be heard
Almost any place
Cause when you're in the street
You can't go far
Without hearing the boom
Pouring out your car
So if your speakers weak
Then please turn it off
Cause we like the cars
That sound so tough

We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny and we like the boom
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny and we like the boom

Everybody, just beep your horn if you hear us
Just beep your horn if you hear us
Just beep your horn
Now clap (Hit it!)
Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Beep! Come on, everybody! Beep! Beep!
Beep!",https://genius.com/Ltrimm-cars-with-the-boom-lyrics
Grab It,Grab It!,1988,"You say you wanna push it, but you're pushing us through
Girl, let's push you aside and show you what to do
You got to grab it
Grab it like you want it
Grab it
Grab it like you want it
You got to grab that thing when it's up in your face
Cause if you push it too far, he'll go another place
You got to grab it
Time, don't like it go
You best move fast
Cause you move too slow
Push it
No, hah!
You got to grab it
Grab it you want it
Grab it
Grab it like you want it
You got to grab it
Don't let it get away
You might not get the chance another day
So take a lesson and I hope you learn
That if you push it, it might not return
Break down
Oh, baby, babe!
Well, I'm Bunny D
And I'm Lady T
Whenever in the place, it call XTC
Cause the X is for excitement
The T is too damn much
The C is for that coola you wish you could touch
My name is Bunny, and this is not funny
If you come to my house, then I will get your money
My name is Tigra, I'm a funky fly skeezer
My smile is big, but my ego is bigger
Grab it
Grab it like you want it
Grab it
Grab it like you want it
Awesome, and them some
And we got what it takes
We are the real things, we are not fakes
Cause our rhymes are ours
They're not bought or paid
And like grandma's chicken soup
They are homemade
T is cause I'm tantilizing
I because I am inviting
G is for the girl in me
R is when I rock the beat
A is cause I'm simply awesome
B is cause I know you want some
U is cause you wish you got some
N is cause I'm nice
It's twice because I'm nasty
Y you don't need to know
D's cause I said so
Last time
Grab it
Grab it like you want it
Grab it
Grab it like you want it
You got to grab it
Don't let it get away
Cause you might not get a chance another day
So take a lesson, and I hope you learn
That if you push it, it might not return
Hit it
Yeah, word
So, baby
Grab it
Just grab it like you want it
Grab it
Oh, grab it like you want it
Grab it
Grab it like you want it
Grab it, grab
Grab it like you want it
Oh, I got it
Now what cha gonna do with it?
Hey, baby",https://genius.com/Ltrimm-grab-it-lyrics
Better Yet L’Trimm,Grab It!,1988,"Tigra and Bunny better yet L'Trimm
Two fly girls from the city
Well what other girls or what to be
I just do it like this...
Well I'm Bunny D and I'm Lady T
Raping on the mic subductively
One kiss for my lips
Will not get to your nips
But that is for your homeboys that we may tease
Tigra and Bunny better yet L'Trimm
(T-T-T-Tigra and Bunny)
Tigra and Bunny better yet L'Trimm
(L-L-L-Trimm)
Tigra and Bunny better yet L'Trimm
(T-T-T-Tigra and Bunny)
Tigra and Bunny better yet L'Trimm
(L-L-L-Trimm)
Well I am Tigra and I'm on the prowl
When I see a fine guy I lettin' so growl
But they don't effect my raping and they don't effect me
Because I'm strong and I'm bold on the M-I-C
Well I can't say that I'm honest cause I've never been but
Don't put me to the test cause you'll never win
You see I am Tigra the lady tiger
And when you see me I can never be finer so
Don't miss a step and take a dime
Because dissing me will be a waste of time
I got ten boys on my left and twenty men on my right
And I can play with their heads
They don't put up a fight
Because were...
Tigra and Bunny better yet L'Trimm

(L-L-L-Trimm)
Tigra and Bunny better yet L'Trimm
(T-T-T-Tigra and Bunny)
Tigra and Bunny better yet L'Trimm
(L-L-L-Trimm)
Cause we're sweet like sour, like sugar, and spice
And all the guys are on us like white on rice
Yes sweet like sugar, but tasty like spice
And when we walk through the door we know we look nice
We could be good and we could be bad
You only get the myth we already had
So forget the rest, we are the best
We captivate your mind even when were dressed
So all you stinky hoes just step aside
Cause we'll rob your man like Bonnie and Clyde
Tigra and Bunny better yet L'Trimm

Tigra and Bunny better yet L'Trimm
(L-L-L-Trimm)
Tigra and Bunny better yet L'Trimm

Tigra and Bunny better yet L'Trimm
(L-L-L-Trimm)
We are whipped, as you can see
So hit Bunny, bust a rhyme for me...
Well my name is Bunny and I'm so damn fine
I'm the kinda girl that will blow your mind
Cause with a wink of my eye I will make you see
All the voices of the Lady B
Yes I am Bunny D and I'm short and fine
I'll take your man and I'll still hang with mine
And if you keep dissing then I'll bust your rhyme
And if you keep talking then you will be mine
Cause Uhh, I'm not playing, this is true
My name is Bunny D and I'm here to rock you
I'm here to show you what I got
And let me tell you baby that's an awful lot
I know that you think that I look sophisticated
And believe me baby I'm not overrated
Cause a A-B-C-D-E-F-G
I know that you wish you can be with me
Hit it!
