Brooklyn Zoo,Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version,1995.0,"Shit. Word. I bust that nigga ass right now
Ain’t no–none of them niggas can’t fuck with me
What? Nigga you could never fuck with me, my nigga
I’ll fuck you up right now! What?! What?! What?!
Bust your motherfucking ass boy!
I ain't no motherfucking joke, you know who you talking to?
(Word up, bust that nigga ass, word up)
Ol' Dirty Bastard, you know what I’m sayin'?
I fuck you up right now
Yeah! What?! What?! What?!

I'm the one-man army, Ason
I never been tooken out, I keep MC's looking out
I drop science like Cosby dropping babies
Enough to make a nigga go crazy
In the G-Building, taking all types of medicines
Your ass thought you were better than
A-son, I keep planets in orbit
While I be coming with deeper and more shit
Enough to make you break and shake your ass
As I create rhymes good as a Tastykake makes
This style, I'm mastered in
Niggas catching headaches, what? What? You need Aspirin?
This type of pain, you couldn't even kill with Midol
Fuck around, get sprayed with Lysol
In your face like a can of mace, baby
Is it burning? Well, fuck it, now you're learning
How I don't even like your motherfucking profile
Give me my fucking shit: CH-CH-BLAOW!
Last seen and heard, no-one knows
You forget: niggas be quiet as kept
Now you know nothing
Before you knew a whole fucking lot
Your ass don't wanna get shot
A lot of MC's came to my showdown
And watched me put your fucking ass low down
As you can go, below zero
Without a doubt I never been tooken out
By a nigga, who couldn't figure
Yo by a nigga, who couldn't figure
Yo by a nigga, who couldn't figure (Brooklyn Zoo)
How to pull a fucking gun trigger
I said ""Get the fuck outta here!""
Nigga wanna get too close, to the utmost
But I got stacks that'll attack any wack host
Introducing
 - yo fuck that nigga's name
My Hip Hop drops on your head like rain
And when it rains it pours, cause my rhymes hardcore
That's why I give you more of the raw
Talent that I got will r-iz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Whoa-hoa-hoa! Let me like slow up with the flow
If I move too quick, oh, you just won't know
I'm homicidal when you enter the target
Nigga get up, act like a pig trying to hog shit
So I take yo ass out quick
The mics, I've had it my nigga, you can suck my dick
If you wanna step to my motherfucking rep
CH-CH-BLOAW! BLOAW! BLOAW! Blown to death
You got shot 'cause you knock knock knock
""Who's there?"" Another motherfucking hardrock
Slacking on your macking 'cause raw's what you lack
You wanna react? Bring it on back

Shame on you, when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard, Brooklyn Zoo!

Verse 1: Ol' Dirty Bastard

You give me your number, I'll call you up
You act like your pussy on interrupt
I don't have no trouble with you fucking me
But I have a little problem with you 
not
 fucking me
Baby, you know I'ma take care of you
‘Cause you say you got my baby, and I know it ain't true
Is it a good thing? No it's bad, bitch
For good or worse, makes you switch
So I walk on over with my Cristal
Bitch-ass niggas, put away your pist-als
Dirty won't be having it in this house
‘Cause, bitch, I'll cripple your style!
Now that you heard my charming voice
You couldn't get another nigga, coochie won't get moist
If you wanna look good and not be bummy
Girl, you better give me that money! Aow!

Hey, Dirty!
Baby, I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey!
Baby, I got your money

So I glanced at the girls, girls glanced at me
I whispered in their ear: ""Wanna be with me?""
You wanna look pretty though, in my video
Ol' Dirty on the hat and I let you all know
Just dance if you caught up in the holy ghost trance
If you stop I'ma put the killer ants in your pants
I'm the O-D-B as you can see
F.B.I., don't you be watching me
I don't want no problems, ‘cause 
I'll put you down
In the ground where you can not be found
I'm just Dirt Dog trying to make some money
So give me my streaks and give me my honey!
Radios play this all day, everyday
Recognize I'm a fool and you love me!
None of you, 
NUH
, better look at me funny
NUH, you know my name, now give me my money!

Hey, Dirty!
Baby, I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey!
Baby, I got your money

Sing it! Sing it, girls!
Just shake it right now!
If Dirty want his money
I think y'all should give him his money
That's how I like you, girl!

Nigga playing in the club like this all night
Bitches put your ass out, let me hold it tight
You looking at my wrist saying ""It's so nice!""
The price bitch is diamonds, shining disco light
Well, you better help me solve my problem
Or I'ma get this money and rob them
Lucky Dog when I won the Lotto
Ran up on my car for carrying Rollo
But hold on, you can call me Dirty
And then lift up your skirt
And you want some of this Dirty
God made Dirt and Dirt bust your ass
Stop annoying me! Yeah, I play my music loud
It takes the Bastard – Ol' Dirty – to move the crowd
They say, ""He had his dick in his mouth.""
Eddie Murphy taught me that back in the house
Now give me my money!

Hey, Dirty!
Baby, I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey!
Baby, I got your money

Hey, Dirty!
Baby, I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey!

Raw Hide,Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version,1995.0,"Yeah! I wanna let all y'all niggas know in here tonight
That this is that Wu-Tang shit
This that shit that's gonna get you high
See when you stimulate your own mind for one common cause
You see who's the real motherfuckers
See what you see is you what you see
(You nuh see it? Wu-Tang a-run tings!)
Be the original G
Rhymin' on timin' in the place to be
(Run blood claat tings!)
Ladies love seein' me!

You're a crossbreed, I'm a knowledge seed
I want action! That's what I need
I never put doubt on my mind
'Cause I know when I touch the mic it's the rhyme
See murder which is caused
When you fuck with the negative and positive charge
Then they came up out my garage
With the hit that's gonna be large
Tired of sittin' on my fuckin ass
Niggas I know be runnin' around with mad fuckin' cash
Who the fuck wanna be an emcee
If you can't get paid to be a fuckin' emcee?
I came out my momma pussy, I'm on welfare
Twenty-six years old – still on welfare
So I gotta get paid fully
Whether it's truthfully or untruthfully
With my Boston bloodthirsty posse
P-E-A-C-E

Move 'em in, move 'em in
Move 'em out, move 'em out
Stick it up {*whip sound*} raw hide!

Yeah, gotta come back to attack
Killin' niggas who said they got stacks, 'cause I don't give a fuck
{*inhales*} I wanna see blood, whether it's period blood
Or bustin' your fuckin face some blood!!
I'm goin' out my fuckin' mind!
Everytime I get around devils {*breathing hard*}
Let me calm down, you niggas better start runnin'
'Cause I'm comin', I'm dope like fuckin' heroin
Wu-Tang Bloodkin, a goblin, who come tough like lambskin
Imagine, gettin' shot up with Ol' Dirty insulin {*sucks air*}
You bound to catch AIDS or somethin'
Not sayin I got it, but nigga if I got it you got it!!
What!?

Yo, check the bulletproof fly shit, strong like Thai Stick
Then I'll remain to tear your frame while I freaks it
Like some fly new sneaks and shit
Now eat my shit, bitch tried to creep and got hit
Now regulate, and I'll be out to set up a date
Wu-Tang is bangin' like a Ron G tape
RZA pump the shit just like a shotty
Watch me run it like John Gotti
Collidin' on the track like gin and watty
Check the calendar, I warn any challenger
To step up {*whoosh*} feel the blast from the silencer

Move 'em in, move 'em in
Move 'em out, move 'em out
Stick it up {*whip sound*} raw hide!

Comin' soon to a theatre near you it be the Wu
Yeah, find yourself in the square and see it's true
Actual facts to snack on and chew
My positive energy sounds peace to you
A wise man killed one horse and made glue
Wicked women puttin' period blood in stew
Don't that make the stew witches brew?
I fear for the eighty-five that don't got a clue
How could he know what the fuck he never knew?
God-Cypher-Divine come to show and come to prove
A mystery god that's the work of Yacub
The Holy Ghost got you scared to death kid boo!!

Yeah, we always gotta keep it fly
Fly for you to feel what you wants to feel
See Wu-Tang'd like to thank, all the people across the country
All the people in America, all the people outside of America
For listenin' to our music
We gotta keep it fly for ya!
See this ain't somethin' new
That's just gonna come out of nowhere, no!
This is somethin' old! And dirty!
And dirty!

Protect Ya Neck II the Zoo,Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version,1995.0,"See let a nigga come through with that bullshit
Any time you pop that shit nigga
I'ma tell you you can suck a dick, you can suck a pussy
I know, it'll come to what? Say what?
Now I'ma let all you motherfuckers know
See them knows that this is something you can't fuck
Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
You from Queens nigga
I don't give a fuck, where you be motherfucker!
Where you reside... motherfucker!
How you live? How you seeeeeeee

Sort the stack outs, this one's the blackout
Three-fifty-seven to your mouth, blaow!!

Dirty, can you hear me? Rawness I’m inflicting
It's that G type slang that makes this real sickening
Ignite the styles, I got my hand upon the trigger
Starts from the smallest and hits the bigger nigga

Yo, straight out the lava by them hell fires
A known mental killer, born thriller, assassin of terror
A hot bloody fatal mixture of carbon and water
Homicidal manslaughter, death is the order
Start the mission, travel like the speed of wind
Through the valley of sin, I step to ville and murdered many men
Serving justice in my vicinity

(This is, Brooklyn, Zu!!)
Za-za-za, za-za-za
Zuh-za-zah, z-zz-zz-z-z-zz-zz-z-dah-duh-dnn-duh

I get down, I get down, I crack your fucking crown
Lay around and watch some real niggas break ground
I can't shop cause every bro blowing up the spot
Hit rocks and niggas know

Yo! Niggas grab the mic like the bites of a scorpion
Nervous, that's why the Zu brought me in
Now bring em forth, like the tortures at the courts
Before the case begin, first break me in
His brain! And make sure he can't maintain the calmness
Ya harmless, watch how I bomb this
Stage light now appears to be the Moon
Now your Posse is your fucking Platoon
Stale sound just flows through the air
I'm like a ninja, once I send ya cold stares
Then I get furious, imperious, the lyricist with the clearest rhyme
Erupt to deduct your fucking mind

Fuck shit up on the hurry-up
Known for burying ducks through more styles than a monk
Warning you chump, brain is out for lunch
Given the power punch, soon to be paid like Donald Trump
Never fall victim to no bitch
Jerked my dick, but still got more hoes than a pimp
And score more points than Shawn Kemp
Keeping powerfully strong like the center on the Knicks
Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut!!
Ol Dirty Bastard live and uncut
(Shame on a nigga who tried to run game on a...)

Got more props than the President
My hardcore represent
Blowing niggas back who never had this
Cause I'm gifted, so you can gift wrap the shit
I'm kicking and send it to your moms for Christmas
And tell her Shorty Shit Stain sent it
Soon to have more green than the Jolly Green Giant
Cause niggas rap styles just down, it's expired
You should've stayed home instead of picking up a microphone
But if you wanna run on up, like you tough
I call your bluff and blow you down with my hardcore stuff
I shine like twenty-four carat, niggas know...

Roll and stroll with the party scene
Nigga wanna know me as Mr. Clean
Wza-wza-wza-wza-Wu-Tang, flip the script and
Test my skill niggas, you're tripping
Drugged up from sniffing, you're the one who's riffing
I'm not Opie, save that old shit for Andy Griffith
Start to flip, slip cause you're slipping
While you sleep I be the God on point, with Scottie Pippen
As I jump on stage, flip rip a show
Strip and rip a ho, wayyy like Bo
Jackson while I'm still taxing maxing
Relaxing sitting back, silly attraction
Again and again when I rock the jam
Wanna see em up in the air, throw up your hand
Introducing one-man band in town
It's wild, more the style couldn't stand nigga
When the jump stepped to the center
Of the rhyme inventor, MCs' tormentor
You get dap slapped, across the MC map
Your ass that's your ass on a whore shot
Come on through I black and blue your whole crew
Then I get Rudy with the Hong Kong Phoo'
Ol Dirty Bastard, MC killer
Money maker, Brooklyn, Shaolin style
That I lay down like tile, then I get higher

Here comes the illlll, type ruffer
Style be untouched I'm leavin broken down grammars on the pen
Who who what? What brings it? Tighter than your anus
Chambers this name is for the deepest trainers
Keep it stainless, steel, on time it is the windmill
Deadly venom kills, at the last of the Sam's Mill
60 Second, nucleus, attack on your set
Hit you with the blast (yo close the door)
Shabazz!!

Snakes,Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version,1995.0,"Now number two, practiced the snake style
He was known as the snake spirit
He had the speed of a snake

Niggas is like serpents out there
Serpents will bite
Lay outside, and then they roll back into they holes
They slither, in the streets of Brooklyn, New York
Slither in the streets, of Manhattan
In the streets of Queens, streets of the Bronx
Streets of Staten Island
Wherever you see em they slither
Whoever... yo
Fearsome shit... check it out
Yo, yo

It broke me up when they pat me on my shoulder
Said stay strong 'cause his life is now over
I flash back to the heathens that he roll with
They shot him up and down nobody knows shit
My peers, little ears
Came up to me with a eye full of tears
Last night we was shootin' dice and gettin' nice
Kid rolled us, played us for our merchandise
We were in the hallway all day
Me, Steve and Little Ray
Probably at first they tried to rob me
Back me in the lobby, pull out the shotty
Then came Scotty, fragile body
My first impression, he returned from a party
He would just stagger, smellin' like Bacardi
The Dragon, braggin', how he was fuckin' mad hotties
Pressed on the elevator button, then all of a sudden
He licked off, about a dozen
Slugs from the cannon, that ripped through my cousin
Nobody was standing when the nigga started bustin'
Blood started to flood the floors by the elevator doors
That's the last thing that I saw
Damn, we planned to make grands and buy a home


Jagged edge, rock head hard as Stonehenge
Pledged whoever crossed his path get scrapped with a sledge..
..hammer, he didn't give a damn about the manner
And on the block he was called by the momma's
And the grandma's, 'indecent', 'heathen', 'juvenile delinquent'
His weekends was frequently locked inside the precinct
His most recent cape for catchin' papes
Was snatchin' up snakes on a roof butt-naked hang em off like drapes
Then ask what's the combination to the safe, with the brace
And those who didn't reply they fell straight to their face
Razor blade sharp who invades the dark
And raid more spots than Spays and NARCS iron heart like Tony Starks
A fierce lion, who never leave the crib without the iron
And on the block he be slingin' rocks and duckin' from the sirens
Greetin' niggas he loved with a pound, and a bear hug
Those who wanted life, they catch a slug from the snub
A Five Percent, who all knew was one to ten
He loved the Gods with his heart but his brain was filled with sin
And when he came through niggas be lookin' out
Hopin' he gets shot or tooken out, or locked the fuck up in Brooklyn House
In PC, on a liquid diet, but he was louder than a riot

Do the knowledge to a nigga named Trigga
Bad rudeboy from the land of Jamaica
With visions to venture, to the U.S
To receive the gold that he couldn't achieve
In his country, even though he sold mad weed
For the next man, who was the Don of the clan
Niggas actin like they got the block locked
Like I can't sling drug raps and eat food
But I be the rudest, bad boy steppin gun totin
Shots lash out like a violent explosion
At the nigga, who tries to stop my production
Intervene the scene and slow up the cream
None of that black, East New York, gun talk
Niggas I extort from Baltic to Boardwalk
Memories of injuries, wounds and burns
Walkin' through the streets of Medina I stand firm
'Cause I know this, which means I can hold mine down
Without a doubt, niggas who front, get snuffed out
Justice must be born there's no escape
'Cause a snake can't be reformed so why wait
Comin' in the name to proclaim your fame for protection
And you don't know no fuckin' lessons?

Bad, bad, Leroy Brown
Baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than the deep blue seaaaaa
Badder than you and meeeeee
Niggas comin through the trees like a salamander
Bitin' like a piranha
But I'm bitin' you back, like a black pantha, the style I'm ampin' the...
Fuck my name, who I be?
Fuck the game, it's all about the moneyyyy!
Owahhaerahh
Sometimes I get high with the Meth then I turn to the Killah Priest
When it comes TWELVE O'CLOCK!! I turn into the demon beast
Yo, yo fuck that shit!

YO! SHOW THESE MOTHERFUCKERS WHAT TIME IT IS
 Rawwrarrrah
Rahhwarwaahauh, rawwaroar!!
WHO's THE BAD-ASS? *rawharrah*
WHO's THE BAD-ASS?
 Rawwwaahrah

He was known as the snake spirit] YEAHhhhhh

Lyrics, never waitin, twelve days, penetrated
When I come with the ruffness, mad niggas try to rush this
Slip into my killings, then I slays and you're helpless
When I try to stay sick, it's Yakub grafted six
Calm for the kill, knowing the style that's ill
When I drop the greatest skills, brothers say, 'Buddah chill!!'

I don't need to rhyme no more, niggas know, yo!

My specialty from me to you is MC
Say what you wanna say, baby say
I flip the microphone-ah, any day
I'm mad swift because I got that gift of gab
Niggas get mad, your ass never had
This talent that I got will riz-zock the spot
MCs, you got paid a lot
You ever notice a black man damn mostly slams
When it come to the money, yo it ain't funny
It's what you gotta do what you got to do

C'mon, can I get a Wu-Tang

Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, it's on your brain

Blaow, then you won't step to me
Thinking is he really raw as he said he'd be
If I wasn't really raw, standing here on the floor
You'd be like, ""Booooo! He ain't hardcore!""
Niggas play like they live but won't survive
Jumpin up and down ticklin that jive when you ticklin gab

The Genius! Genius (The Genius)
The Genius, the Genius

I'll grab the mic and I'll damage ya
Crush your whole stamina
Here comes the medical examiner
One verse then you're out for the count
Bring the ammonia, make sure he sniffs the right amount
Wake him up and then ask him
Why did he attend this --
Competition to get ass kickin' so tremendous
Boy you know you shouldn't bother this
Leave me alone like the son said G or he'll be fatherless!
I got the asiatic flow mixed with disco
Roll up on the scene like the Count of Monte Cristo
And MCs start to vanish
I stepped up to a jet black kid, started speakin' Spanish!
Yo he wasn't from Panama
Asked him how he get so dark, the nigga said suntanama!
He responded so fast, he made me laugh
Ha-ha-ha, HARARRRH then I scared-his ass!
Kicked the hundred strongest rhymes
I brought out the punk in him
Caught him with a strong five deadly venom
Told him enter the Wu-Tang
Witness the Shaolin slang, that'll crush the shit you bring
And watch your ass take a big fall, why?!
My Main Source is like a friendly game of stickball
And as you step up to bat man and I play the riddler
Try to do me for a rhyme and I'll change to Hitler
Go out like a Nazi; you'll be wishin' your fuckin' ass stayed home and played Yahtzee!
Or watchin' Happy Days sweatin' Potsie
With Ralphie and Richie Cunningham, Joni and Chachi
Wu, who? Me gettin' wrecked so I'm through
Like a ten and a half foot gettin' in a seven shoe
Now picture that with a Minolta
Have your ass doin' some Night Fever shit like John Travolta
I come strong, I make knowledge born, I flip the script
And rock on from P.M. past the fucking Dawn
Pass the Hammer you're broke down, English grammar, what, what
Can't understand it here's the panorama
A complete view of how I defeat you
Should've stepped to those fuckin' kids who tried to beat you
Yeah, I bust that ass before
You ran to Texas and came back but forgot the chainsaw!
And when I perform a massacre
Better be coming with some motherfucking shit that's spectacular
Crush the personal vendetta, well you just better
Start stepping to your raggedy ass jetta
Put the pedal to the metal
You and your DJ change your name to Ma and Pa Kettle
As I pass the bone, kicks your every measure
It's not a Newport but it's still live with pleasure
C'mon don't be silly, just a bag of sensimilli
Rolled up in a Motown Philly
I used to write all the time when I smoked
Grab the mic, then I like kinda went for broke
With visually concepts strongest rhymes and biceps
Lyrically speakin', three to four rhymes a choke
Some think they be harmin' this, claimin' they be bombin' this
But they still remains anonymous
I pull strings like Jimi Hendrix
Rhyme on beats that go backs to the days of Eddie Kendricks
I teach the truth to the youth, I say, ""hey youth
Here's the truth, better start wearing bulletproof""
Arm yourself with a shield

Wastin’ Time (No More),UnKnown,2009.0,"Please pull the plug if the drugs are winning
Cause the high will keep your world spinning
Wasted time, thought about the high with fam
True the cash was there, and the stash was there
And I thought that Forever that the Wu was there
Wasted time, on hoes, pussy and clothes
I'm the Don of the rose, it's the life I chose
Baby Mamas are the worst, bitches don't even work
Yet the Coach bag matches with your hat and your skirt
So I slept for no reason, disappeared for seasons
Room may be padded, but damn, it's more easy
Beautiful girls tease me, they see the sleaze in me
But I'mma stay Dirty, accept the snake
No more will I waste the cake, no more will I run from Jake
No more will I make mistakes, no more will I waste the time

No more will you spit in my drink, no more will you poison me
I'mma climb real high, feel free with the thug inside
No more will I run and hide, wastin' time
No more will I taste the drugs, no more will I dodge the slugs
I'mma climb real high, feel free with the thug inside
No more will I run and hide, no more will I run and hide
No more will I waste the time

I walk on a dirty trail of cash and L's
Red Rose, 
you get high when I exhale
Jumped bail cause the judge promised my ass jail
West Coast couldn't hide me, the world's an audience
Passed out from the high like Martin Lawrence
Had me in the room next to Sarah Connor's
But my problem's much greater than any Terminator
Not one visit from fam, just letters from fans
Saying ""
Dirt keep ya head up and fuck getting wet up""
The Roc told me to sign on the dotted line
""
Welcome home, Russell Jones, you've been wasting time
Rocked up a little
, 
bling bling a little
Now every roach in the cracks wanna jump in the Ac
Every cat in the front gotta ride in the back
You freaks in the Ford, I ride a Cadillac
You freaks in the Ford, I ride a Cadillac

Hippa to Da Hoppa,Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version,1995.0,"My beats are slamming

My beats are slamming from the rugged programming
My man Bob Marley hey my man I'm jamming
You could never touch the stamina, while I'm ramming the
Hip-hop crowd makes me rrrah rrrah rrrah
Other MC's got flipped with the ease
Begging me for mercy, stop the music please
No cause I'm a pro, rap to the convo
Make a crowd say ho, at a strip show
Represent, my name is Ason keep calm
Rhyme's too smoky, funky like a stink bomb
Boom, blowing up niggas better than pulling the trigger
So you betta run for cover
Niggas better loosen they ass, felt the glass
A forty ounce bottle, yo yo yo money yo pass
Woooh-woooh-woooh, I sweat it live
Is he gonna live doc?, no the nigga dies
The max-imum of MC's are populating
The min-imum of those MC's are dominating
Now all and together now, to what what who
Rhymes come stinky like a girl's poo-poo

Hippa to da hoppa and you just don't stoppa (2x)

Ahh shit, here I go once again
Rhymes get shitty from the time that I spend
I come old like toe fungus mold
Ask my grand-pop pop duke gave my soul
Then I came with that old Al Green shit
Saaa-die, taught me the ballistic
I get you blurry in your eye with a high note
Down, to the Brownsville, oops you got smoked
The shit I'm dropping is stinking up your area
When I shoot it through like a messenger carrier
I keep my breath smelling like shit so I can get

Ah, Punch Call!
No no, remember when we used to say who could do this the longest
(ahhhhhhhhh) *repeated*
*breaks down*
Ahhhh!!!!!!!! ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!
All right, I'm about to put it
Goin down, down

I am the U-N-I, The Q-U-E, the G to the O-D
I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man called Unique G
Well, my name is known all over the world
To the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I go down in history
As the baddest brother that ever could be
You couldn't show me
Didn't know me
How to be a true MC
My advantage on the M-I-C is the slang
That I manifest so you could never hang
Obviously you know my name by now
I done thrown stupid parties all through your town
Dirt McGirt...that's my motherfucking name
Love to flirt...that's my motherfucking game
They said ""Who wanna be an MC?""
I am the original G-O-D
Making young ladies scream's my specialty
See my style, different from yours
Make young bitch wanna drop the drawers

Interlude: Icelene Jones

Fuck that bullshit Unique
You my motherfucking husband
I ain't got no motherfucking time for them bitches
You better come home with me
You better bring your motherfucking ass home tonight, motherfucker
I ain't got no motherfucking time for no bitches calling my motherfucking house with that bullshit
You got three fucking babies to take care of
Fuck that shit

Matter of fact, I gotta song for you all:
SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW
WHERE BLUEBIRDS FLY
SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW
WHY OH WHY
HEAR ME NOW!

Style funky, you know dat's me
Fear no evilllll whohoho one man army
Down for mine when I go on tour
Throw your hands in the air if you want more
Style is evil is like an wicked witch
With the mi-ca-phone spliggh! Funky as a bitch
Which is which, makes me nasty nasty
Next on the mic is the rappin NUH
You want some of the Ason's gun
Shoot the nigga, BLAAOW, reaches no one

Approach the school nine thirty, you're late
The time happy the solution was my date
Get in your class, walk to your chair
Pop is all you see and then occasionally stare
At the teacher, or students who were clockin' you
Lean back at this girl who kept clockin' you
Stimulated from a sensimilla blunt
Tell the young girl ""Baby, you're the one I want.""
She doesn't respond, pretends to ignore
So you say to yourself, it be her cold and sore mentally
Visualize the aim on the board
As how to buy pussy you cannot afford
This girl who, was slim and trim
Whispered in her friend’s ear quietly ‘I want HIM!'
I took out my books to write the notes for my class
But I Kept fantasizing my dick in that ass
So I turned around to arrange a date
Swinging episode, baby number one's gotta say it
She popped a gum, cold twist to come
I said ""Baby, how you feel?"", She said ""chill""
Then I said ""chill"", I just found my thrill
Wear it in the classroom, know I'm Blueberry Hill
Cause what I said just bottled her hate
She put her face on the chest, this is what the bitch said:
""Because of you I ain't hurting, but within my within my heart
Cause no, I'm not right to be flirtin, but our relationship has to start
You're the one that I'm clocking, time for you could stop mockin'
Don't want you to see me cry, this is why, this is why, this is why!""

I met a girl named Chandra, from way down yonder
The apple of my eye had a Snapple and some fries
Forgot the ketchup, that's when I pressed up
""I've been watching you mowing your lawn""
The thoughts were flowin', while I'm holding her palm
""Hey what's that on your menu?"", from there we continued
And talk about this and that we chit and chat
Sipped on the Coke then I stroked her back
As she giggled and I wiggled to the bra
She said ""nah!"", that's when I noticed her Pa
Big Tank, who did nothing but the spank
At parties, drink Bacardi and didn't think
Just act silly, with his brother Willy
Another hillbilly gettin' ill with the Philly
And moonshine, but it's a new time of day
On the stoop doing the Patty Duke
OK, it's like that old flip flaps through the shower caps
The platform shoes to Apple Jacks
Chub chub!!

Yo, you niggas, niggas be actin like
They be lovin' them, them them fancy bitches
I, I likes me a nasty bitch
Bitch that's willing to do anything at any given time
Bitch gotta be nasty cuz I'm a nasty nigga
I do anything baby, I wouldn't give a fuck what it was
I'll, ah, anything - I'm a nasty motherfucker girl

I'm just sittin' right, in my class at a quarter to ten right?
Waiting patiently for the class to begin right?, teacher says
""Open up your texts and read the first paragraph on oral sex!""
I said ""Oral sex!, what kind of class is this?!""
The girl next to me said ""what's wrong with you miss?
This is a lesson that makes you feel fine
Kinda ease your nerves and relax your mind!""
I said ""Don't try to use no hypnotic spell!""
She said ""Be my assistant, I'd sure rather tell!""
My knees buckled heart started to drop
My dick grew to a size that my nerves couldn't stop
I tried to run! She yelled out ""freeze!""
Pulled down my draws, dropped to her knees
Ripped off my draws as if she had claws
Broke the rules that defined sex laws
She responded quick, with a slick, welcoming kiss and a ice cream lick
Oh, I begged, I begged, ""Easy on my balls, they're fragile as eggs.""

Keystone capered, and Wu kept the rap fiends basted

It's not magic, gaming is the gadget
World classic big national high attracts dear graphics
Lampin in my own zone, my physical show
Inhale bones Tony stuck, for the diamond in Rome
He's convincin, labelled one man rap convention
The nigga that'll gun down, eighty frenchmen
Lead vocalist, music specialist, rap arsonist
I deal with sharpness plus spark the hardest individual
I plant crimes inside vocals
My rap's like my passport, my life's my proof
Hit the sun roof, be out like a wanderin dream
Shuttle, and get startled off the verbal hygiene, my nigga

Takin’ heads, takin’ necks. What the fuck they expect?
I don’t know! I don’t care! I won’t fall! I won’t stare

I don’t give a flying fuck about a chump
Cause his heart only pumps Kool-Aid

Rhymes is rugged like burnt buildings in Harlem
The Ol’ Dirty Bastard from the Temple of Shaolin
Dirty to the brain like drops of acid rain

And when you’re shaking my right hand, I’ll stab you with the left

Nuthin’ new in ninety-two, it’s time to go to work
Trills, watch them scream once I hop on the scene
They fear the return of the fatal flying guillotine
Mr. Milli, that means I’m also militant
Don’t wear no suit and tie, I’m no gentleman
Gettin’ laid, takin’ heads, that’s my hobby
Punch a brother in the face who call me Robbie
I be the RZA, call me that cuz-I
Never liked the name I received from my poppa

So I didn't get burnt one time I got burnt actually two times
When you really look at it

Shit that makes me high

Yo, we gonna bring it back, to Harlem World
Motherfuckin' jocks (British Knights)
Yo I remember when niggas was walking down the street
On Farmers, motherfuckers was wearin goose goose
Motherfuckers walking around with Brogans
(I was wearing 'em)
I'm sayin though

A gold tooth that was never shined
I'm sayin though
See cause tonight, is the night of all nights
Most people gather around
To hear the show, that is comin through your town
(I was playin' em)
See my name 
Is somethin, that you won't know
Unless you're dowwwwwwwwn, with the Brooklyn Zoo
(I was wearing 'em)
Other brothers come
But never come back
(Introducing)
So basically, what the Ol'-motherfuckin-Dirty Bastard is sayin'
Is that if you fuck around 
You're gonna get yo' ass fucked up
So don't fuck around just lay down

I remember (dnnah-dah, dnh, duh, dnh, dnnah-dah)
Not too long ago (dnnah-dah, dnh, duh, dnh, dnnah-dah)
I went to a city (dnnah-dah, dnh, duh, dnh, dnnah-dah)
And I saw a Wu-Tang show (dnnah-dah, dnh, duh, dnh, dnnah-dah)
Now I always wanted (dnnah-dah, dnh, duh, dnh, dnnah-dah)
To get, with, the band (dnnah-dah, dnh, duh, dnh, dnnah-dah)
But niggas was singin they own songs
Bein in they own worlds
So I guess I, I guess I, RARAARRRRAAHHH!!!
The terminology, the psychology
You still expect me to accept
Do what I say off the TDK...
With the button on record and the other on...
Thus I press pause for a serious cause
To respect an intellect with this gratifying
Now that I'm ready let the music begin
As I detect what I wrote with my...
Through the time that I spent, money that I lent
Rap records went up just about
Then became a new way to get paid
They said, ""rhymin' on the mic is the number one...""
Then a brother get the feeling that he want to play cool
You discombumberated diabolical fool
Hog-flesh MC, go play in the mud
Another 20th century, modern day
Cannibal, humanoid, underground (Dweller)
Chud broke loose from the god damn (Cellar)
Dope-fiend addict why you walk with
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
When the MCs came, to live out their name
Most rocked rhymes that was all the...
When I elevated, and mastered the time
You was stimulated from the high post
You got shot cause you knew you were rocked

You're not the king of the diss
Youse a queen of a bitch
You're like a homosexual
Your ass always switch
Niggas wake up in the morning
Your ugly-ass guise
Got slob around your mouth
Green cold in your eye
You can't smile your teeth too gritty
Can't even move, drawers too shitty
(you know what else) You're shaped like a thistle
The holes in your drawers when you fart them shits (whistle)
YOU DUCKIN SUCKIN MOTHERFUCKIN COLD-HEARTED FAGGOT
Sperm germ slimy worm DISINTEGRATED MAGGOT
Repeat your rhymes all the time like a FUCKIN parrot
Phony gold chains only rated two carats
You tell your friends that your home is like heaven
Livin in the gutter sewer seven pipe eleven
You wear your socks twelve days in a row
Turn them on the other side so the dirt won't show
Go to school, take a shit, don't wipe your ass
Blame it on another sucka nigga in your class
YOU WANNA BATTLE?
Is it the pork on your fork, or the swine on your mind
Make you rap against a brother with a weak-ass rhyme
Swine on your mind, pork on your fork
Make you imitate a brother in the state of New York
Chain on your BRAIN, that drove you inSANE
When you tried to CLAIM, for the talent and the FAME
Nothin to GAIN, yet and still you CAME
Suffer the PAIN, as I demolish your NAME
Not like Betty Crocker, baking cake in the OV
Sayin this is dedicated to the one I love
Not a swine or dove, from the heaven's up above
When I rap, people CLAP, so they push and they shove

Part two, for me and the cipher troop
With the Teflon lyrics that you can't get through
With the twenty-two automatic rap you pack, what?
You ain't hittin with that wack shit you kickin
Straight from the beginning, of the game
All the way to the ninth inning, I bring the pain
Dark like the midnight train on the track by the RZA
Diesel like Arnold Schwarzanegger

Ask you a question, test the Ason
Extra extra, read the drama and thennn another one

'86 was the year that it started
Crack hit the states, and my hood got to poppin'
Back then, you had to catch it with narcotics
Without a doubt, Brooklyn had the hardest projects
Nowadays, if a nigga say you got it
You be sitting in the county, with like 3 or 4 charges
Young when started, but I had a talent
To get this package up, cuz I took it as a challenge
The older niggas game me much as I can handle
Cop the eagle, started jackin' with the green New Balance shit
I'm feelin' clean, I was only thirteen
With the heavy starch, on my Bugle Boy Jeans
My name's spelled right on my four finger ring
It was Dirt then, cuz McGirt you ain't seen

Look here, more money, more problems, my ass
You'se a naive cat, if you still believe that, for real
That's a trick to try to keep you where you at
All content, while niggas ridin' Bentley's and Maybach
Think I'mma lay back, playa, forget it
First hundred G's, I see, nigga, I'm tryin' to flip it

Campaignin' while we all G off
Automatic mayors, now we ain't playin'
Wolves start scheemin', violate me in the rain
Get more respect, rob Marvin Gaye on 'em
Gold, black, beige on 'em, heavy gauge
Gettin' blazed, all that money, but he ain't even shaved

At four twenty, when niggas knew what time it was
A shot of Remy, in my system, I'm buzzed
Then baby, I ain't just a little off, I'm unplugged

Like every nigga that done time, I didn't do it

Leave ya head like a Shaolin monk with six dots
Hindu kush, twistin' a Sweet Swisher
In search for Bobby the Digital, bitch, not Bobby Fisher
Head full, with a Grey Goose and Redbull

Of dimepiece, model type bitches, who mind they own business
Blow my dick, like birthday cake wishes
My warrior's scornful, hard to respond to

Brooklyn Zu, shots will go right through you
Touch me in Cali, or the streets of Maui
In the two thousand six pitch black Audi

Aiyo all this shit is from the ghetto
Smoke Palmetto, sing like Peno
Carry the Heathrows, scared of police though
They tried to kill O. in prison yo!
Had me turned out, drunk is all about
I got this money pourin' out the stout
I'm a loud mouth, drunk party is out
Play this music on every route
Follow Dirty, I'm the WhiteOut
Catch bitches like trout, get drunk, won't stop
I'm gettin' this money, called gettin' honey
Streets of Brooklyn and ain't a damn thing funny
Have a day sunny, bitches put me in ya tummy
I'm the nigga on the cross burnin' about 20
Go me a bunny lookin' good and funny
All you niggas, is straight crash dummies


I was checkin' out my melody before The Blueprint
Felony, a nuisance, huggin' me and my two cents
Don't double the six takes, never did a mixtape
But rather a chick take but waste any weather we get cake
I let rats have it, fuck these rap faggots!
Everybody want the kid dead like Pat Garrett
I'm a goon, speak with a mellow tone
Rock yellow stones, gun longer than a broom!
Cuz felon on the ride is long due and soon
Out again like boom, government comin' soon
Anything less is uncivilized like a case mack
I'm a shooter used to stay jack, 
cooler than a Maybach
Arubu known to collect, twistin' up that haze black
And Backwood on that, good rap, I stay strapped
P.P., don't carry that weight
Nigga redhead, fuck with chicks if their head straight


Yeah you know what time it is
It's that new shit

You got that Louie Loco on the side of your purse
And those tight mint sixties, about to make me burst
I can't think, let me sink into your jugular
Come have a joint, with the thirsty love guzzler
From the darkside, baby, don't be afraid
You can't fight the thirst, nor escape the Blade
I've been scoping ya, hoping you be open to
Take a sip, of the potion cause it's overdue
It's not your ordinary, it's a special brew
In the heat of the night, I will rescue you

Dirty Dirty,Osirus,2005.0,"Two steps from the border line
Anything closer will kiss the nine
Think I'm out the game? You out of your mind
Cuz I stay on track, like transit line
Keep it nappy or braided up
Dirty in the cockpit, blazin' up
Stop frontin' when you made it up
Tellin' all my hoes, you can't spray it up
Hah, huggin' nuts like tighty whites
Still trickin' on hoes like Heidi Fleiss
You know why niggas don't give you much respect
Cuz they seen you gettin' slapped with the empty gat
Know Dirt, like bow know death
When I'm huntin' down, birds of rap
Hate Dog, cuz I ate your cat
And you can eat my ass and have a coke with that
Use a spoon, unless you want a fork
Pull my dick out, watch the room get dark
Stay high with the zombie walk
Gotta sit my ass down, like Rosa Parks

Dirty Dirty, you tell me how you do it
It look so easy, like there was nothin' to it
But they don't understand, about the Dirty M.C
It's the.... (Ohhhhhhhhhh), new track by ODB

They say dirt and sunshine make the flowers grow
I say, fuck a bitch raw and drive your nut on the floor
Call it what you want, you son of a ho
I was 5 percent til' white bitches came and dropped it down to four
3, 2, 1, I can lick the sun with my tongue
Pull it out and smack a nigga, just for thinkin' I'm done
Shut your trap, razor blade cut your wrap
Fat girls seen me comin', started tuckin' their flab
Rhymefest and Dirt Dog, gon' spark this
The day he got to heaven, track mud on the carpets
Hot like the hot potato, you niggas ain't macho
You hot as gazpacho
Go to the show, for hot dogs and nacho's
This me and Dirt Dog's style, it's not yours
[Chorus 2X}

What can make a ho, look more cuter
Hennessey shots, or smoke more Buddha?

I don't know Dirt, now she look like Zab Judah
Test my manhood, go get my dick ruler

Now you hungry, wanna eat right through her
But you better first track for a noter
Like does she have a best friend, or a daughter
Has she ever tried fuckin' under water

Down down with the fishes, deep sea dishes
I ain't a genie, bitch, I don't respect your wishes
This trick ain't fuckin' me though, god damn
Something very wrong, I don't understand

Misinterpetate, let me break it down
Two pulls make the your merry go round
Touch your toes, show me that rose
Butt naked, in a Wu-Tang pose
Wide open, girl, everything goes
Real freaky, when you powder that nose

Keep it and move, I sleep in the nude
I'm keepin' it rude, pull out my dick and pee in the food
On the way to the stars, don, where's the map?
We fuckin' there, and we gonna fuck back


Yeah, Dirt Dog, Rhymefest, you want it, man
Rest in peace, I know you heaven right now
Trackin' mud on the carpet, so, we gon' let ya
Do what you do it's the ohhhhhhh
Don't forget the crew, it's the Wuuuuuu
I thought you knew, it's the Ol' Dirt Dog
Rhymefest, yeah yeah, from now to 3000, man
What's rap with Dirty? What's the world without Dirt?
Just a bunch of fuckin' water, ohhhhhhhhh

Back in the Air,A Son Unique,UnKnown,"We used to sleep in the staircase, smoke weed in the staircase
Friday night got drunk, used to pee in the staircase
Hopin' a cop might slip, I'm never known to drop the clip
You copped the Fifth, nigga, I'll pop the fifth
I show no mercy, dunk like a bar of Hershey
Call my gun, 
Lil' Seymour, bitch, or Big Percy
A Dapper Dan fan, who will clap a man
For five grand of small bills, wrapped in a rubberband
Then lay up in a fat pair of titties, my bitch is so saditty
This is Dirt McGirt, ho, not P. Diddy
All we got in common is the money, the only thing I want is the money
You see my face on the wall of every precinct
Bitches keep your pussy decent, I'm juvenile delinquent
For guns that I creep with, they whisper, in secret
Only bitch that peepin', is the one that I sleep with, nih-huh!

Alotta niggas wanna dust me off
Bad bitches wanna suck me off
Rockafella dropped a million here
And Dirt McGirt back in the air
All my gangstas, where ya at?
Throw your guns up and make them clap
Tell me now, muthafuckas, you strapped?
And bitch betta have my money

Aiyo, the bitch better have your money and mine
Cuz if she don't, we both gon' double team that bitch from behind
And for them niggas outside screamin' that
'Somebody gotta die' shit, same dudes on the cop's dick
This is Tone, y'all niggas be frontin'
And most of y'all niggas don't got no guns
Borrowed your man's shit, how's that for a bum?
Dum-dums emptied out of pun son, so see man, see Ach' run
See spots over my Reebok's, cuz he got done
Cheap shots fell out his weak Glock and he got stung
My cheap gun is a gangsta's protein
Treat bitches with the utmost respect, like get 'em wetted
Tellin' to, drink the milk, boo, don't even wet it
This is Starky, I got a foot fetish, loot fetish
With the dust-head men, we got good credit


Notorious Glock buster, cap peelin', block hustler
Who slap hoes, who lack feelings
Black building, crack dealing, black villain
Had a taste for blood spillin', love stealin'
Any thing that twinkle bright to my eye sight
Many nights I used to stay up, at the twilight
And wonder to myself, if's there's a Heaven or Hell
Been alone in these streets, since eleven or twelve
On my own, I run buckwild in the West
A knucklehead nigga, used to sleep in my vest
Had no home, my Moms used to show me no lovin'
Burn the crib down, try'nna dry my shirt with the oven
Now I'm exiled, destined for penal
Hyperactive off the cocaine, got me senile
Back on the block, knowledge to build, knowledge to kill
Intent to put a dent in your grill with the steel",https://genius.com/Ol-dirty-bastard-back-in-the-air-lyrics

Don't even know it happens naturally
Especially when I'm playin with the chemistry

I'm like Big Ben with my middle finger up
Sidewalk hash, make thugs relax

Gotta rob a motherfucker when the day is slow

I rap, but still stick hoes for door knockers
And if she's persistent, block her, block her, block her

It's M.S.G., with Jay-Z, the show stopper
And this is for them gangsta dudes, know you boppin'
That take dough, and don't take shorts for no coppers

Do you want some licorice, do you want some candy?
I wanna drink something outta you, while you sip some Ginger Ale

Ol’ Dirty’s Back,Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version (25th Anniversary Remaster),1995.0,"Intro: Ol Dirty Bastard
Sup? Let's go
(Yo Snoop Dogg! Yo Dre! Yo Too $hort! E-40, and the motherfucking Click!)
Nuff respect to the West coast
(Duhhn duhhn duhhn)
Yo, Ol Dirty Bastard coming through
Know what I'm saying? I got the East coast locked the FUCK down
Hear my SHIT, nigga! (Dirty dirty dirty, Brooklyn!)
Verse One: 12 O'Clock
Shit is crazy real in the field
I watched niggas blood get spilled over five dollar bills
And major drug deals on the real
See a nigga get meals and his bitch get him killed
In this American dream to get some cream
You're ownin a Beem, and your face in magazines
12 O'Clock maintains in the game
Bring the Pain, to smokin' meth in Maine
It's not all about the fame, silly ass dames
Get a gold record and you change
And for the niggas sellin cocaine, you're too blame
Black people lives ain't the same
And that's the Tale in my Hood
Niggas is up to no good, you better watch em in them hoods
Verse Two: Ol Dirty Bastard
I always thought livin life was easy
Go to school, get a job, yo it couldn't be me
So instead, I played my bed
My momma got fed, and now a nigga livin with a dread
My best fuckin friend, knew him since ten
Nigga feed me CREAM, let me whip the Benz
Houses all over Texas, lightning gold Lexus
He had enough respect to dress this
Expensive Tim suits, girl wearin fly Gucci boots
Put me on like POOK!
Every morning that I awake
Ten G's in my fuckin face, combination to the safe!
Son run the state, carrying coke by the weight
Nigga put pounds in the weed gate
And it's ran by Ol Dirty
12 O'Clock, my little brother,
 he keeps it dirty
Dirty
[Fuck all that motherfucking drug selling shit
I wanna see some motherfucking lyrics
I wanna hear some motherfucking lyrics
What up nigga, what?]
Hahahahahahahahahahaha
I got you nigga
Verse Three: 12 O'Clock, Ol Dirty Bastard
I'll rip mics on site you know the type
New Jack, this is my City like Wesley Snipes
Go fly a kite or somethin, make some muffins
I come up bad in the town like Charles Bronson
Now set your speaker and I'll do you for that reason
12 is no joke I bring wreck through the seasons
Solomon, contend, many more but just when
That Joker act you can save for Jack Nicholson
One two and three, through your rap fatigue
In the MC world, is a minor league
What you speak, you swear it's unique
It's just a peek, physique, of an old antique
Don't expect a project, then it's bound to freeze
Your whole head is stuck and stiff
Next Siamese, I never liked rhymes
That's incomplete, then again obsolete
I shall repeat, there's an Easy Street
For niggas who earned, then learn your sojourn
Then you return, as an intelligent, positive, messanger
Not an experiment negative Lucifer
With a tittling gloss of crafted skin
Nothing like spring sauce, of the true origin
Who would score, the wizard of war
Came in best man was a god damn dinosaur
No more jungle-like living, from the Blue Lagoon
It's not an Animal House, National loon Lampoon
If you understand the what when
Why how, are you fellas who exempt
Or to disallow, a fresh MC, that will knock you down
I gets dizzy spellbound like a merry-go-round
While I'm freaking, shall I expose
You take a subject, and then you decompose...",https://genius.com/Ol-dirty-bastard-ol-dirtys-back-lyrics
Lift Ya Skirt,A Son Unique,UnKnown,"Turn it up!

One nigga, two nigga, three nigga, four
One of you niggas is about to get fucked up
It's the Ol' Dirt McGirt, live and uncut
Live and uncut, ready to bust a nut
Like when I first came home, I boned Simone
Fucked her so hard, pussy started to groan
Seven in the morn', woked up and yawned
The bitch scrambled my eggs, she wrote me a song
(Sing it!) It's all because of Dirt Dog
That the reason I took my skirt off
You went away -- now I'm back with (what?)
And this is where the bullshit stop
Plus these voices in my head, want me to go back
Pick up your guns, don't take your Prozac
Ritalin, Codelin, Zoloft, cocaine
Wu-Tang, nigga, it's the new John Coltrane (hahahaha)

Dirt Dog, Dirt Dog, you our man
If you can't do it, then no one can
(Mr. McGirt, gonna get you dirty
Lift up your skirt, I'm gonna get you dirty)
Dirt Dog, Dirt Dog, you our man
If you can't do it, then no one man
(It's the (what) in the house, gonna get you dirty
The Wu-Tang Clan gonna get you dirty)

I hopped on the scene, spit sixteen bars lean
Cross your face like a smear of Mabeline
Wet jeans, get rised, ecstatic clean
Is it cuz my sex feel like you on morphine
They-they think, I'm so much
I talk tough, burn your mouth and handcuffs
Makin' hits, I'm making paper, cake it up
Lookin' haters in the face, like 'nigga what?'
Now scream, how many of these muthafuckas respect me
Cuz I'm the only chick who freak any beat
So pack it up, with that O.D.B
Oh, it's a bad bitch...
Shame on a nigga, who, who tried, to run game
On a nigga, like a gold digger
I pull my trigger, I bet my gun bigger
Now how ya'll figure, that's how ya die quicker

Swear to God, we're the trouble, you imagine us
Cuz the news only exploit the bad in us
When, turn it down a little
Cuz the ground is startin' to crack a little

And touch me, tease me, feel me, caress me

A known mental killer, or thriller, assassin of terror
The hot bloody fatal mixture of carbonate water
Homicidal manslaughter, death is the order start the mission

Serving justice in my vicinity

Hit rocks and niggas know

Yo! Niggas grab the mic like the bites of a scorpion

Now bring em forth, like the tortures at the courts
Before the case begin, first break me in
His brain! And make sure he can't maintain the calmness
Ya harmless, watch how I bomb this
Stage like, mail, pre hands that be the move
Now your Posse is your fuckin Platoon
Stale cells, just flows through the air
I'm like a ninja, once I send ya down stairs
Then I get furious, imperious, the lyricist
With the cleverest rhyme
Erupt to deduct your fuckin mind

Fuck shit up on the hurry-up
Known for burying ducks through more styles than a monk
Warning you chump, brain is out for lunch
Given the power punch, soon to be paid like Donald Trump
Never fall victim to no bitch
Jerked my dick, but still got more hoes than a pimp
And score more points than Shawn Kemp
Keepin powerfully strong like the center on the Knicks
Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut!!

The nigga that'll gun down, eighty frenchmen
Lead vocalist, music specialist, rap arsonist
I deal with sharpness plus spark the hardest individual
I plant crimes inside vocals

Hit the sun roof, be out like a wanderin dream

Is a mixture of Arabic, Sanscrit, English, italics
I talk quick, y'all bitches can't comprehend my dick release spit
But love should I release hits
We travel through bodies like blood vessels
While y'all crab niggas try to wrestle to be on top of this pedestal

Internally inside of me like Tony Starks tee

For slang hall, vocabulary Igor, Frankenstein mind
Rewind for a minute while I dig down your track, stupid

Chaos, killa bee minds, high society blackness, spread the rumor

My lyrical marvel makin more cream than Carvel
Y'all niggas best to hold your weight like barbell
To my verbal swordsman school, students don't play truant
My most prudent pupil, rhyme under influence
Of alcohol and tobacco, mushrooms imported from Morocco
Bellies on the rocks and a twenty sack of choco
With forty tales and gold around the fist, bitch I carve
Lyrics on the paper so my family won't starve

I'm deep in the shit, I stay highly involved
Never in-conceited, never been beated
Been trapped in many wars but not yet retreated
My style you need it, I just write to read it
It's all fresh lyric, no nothing gets repeated
I came a long way and guess what, I succeeded
I conquer my opponent and feed him baby food
'Cause he's childish and illiterate and ye has been rude
To the father year me, O-R-I-G
Respond to the war with the Killa Bee law

Scavenger nigga, you's a shrimp
A full line of shit, my ear can't digest it
Stop drinking all that water, let's take it to the land
So I can Godzilla up your shit mister Tiny Tim man
Niggas be creeping up my beanstalk
When I start to come down on your fucking ass
You tried to chop shit on up
Played my shit like parks bitch, I'm that

Legendary microphone's weaponry
You secondary bitch ass fairies
Scary cats won't survive this verbal attack
You think you're slang can match
The Wu-Tang, emphatically now cypher
You fake crumbs, you should be stung on your tongue
While you young guns bunge, we plunge into the grunge
Deep into the dark dungeon, we come in one wind
Nine minds combine to form the wisest rhyme force to summon
I be the quoted mathematical combination
Unloading mysteries of life, you feel my solar wind blowing

Just then, I came on the stage like wind
Blew slang in your face and it touch your skin
You felt chilly, just like you smoked a bag of illy
You need a coat just to protect your throat
Two pairs of socks, kid I'm cold like ice rocks
Chap-lipped duds can't fuck with the chatterbox
Cherry heads felt the draft of the ox
Shaolin niggas all fuck with one block..
They forgot about the big Cappa slang murderer
Down with the union big street sling murderer
Terrorizing, move I'm tranquilizing
Fast getaway wit the slow speed driving
Two miles an hour, Cappa do it wit the power
Somebody blow something, cut fool in the tower",https://genius.com/Ol-dirty-bastard-96-recreation-demo-lyrics

Don't need muscle, cuz Barry got a gun
Nighttime, still blaze like sun
Book the residence, worry bout none
Chillin' with believer, drinkin' zero proof rum
Darker is better, cuz the dick's well done
Be a good girl, let you taste what I'm from
Baby, I'm the man, with the frame: well hung
Cuz a squirrel, is a squirrel til a squirrel get a nut
Get a butt, like an ashtray, point it out, I eat her
Til the 6, been callin', sayin, ""nah, I don't wanna meet her""
In the ass, to some Pendergrass, after smokin' grass
Fuck her fast like a rabbit, I'm a sex fiend addict

Seen it all, done it all, lick my balls with her tongue
Got my toes curled up, like I'm sayin' right on
If you wanna ride home, let me call you a cab
Cuz the next bitch coming, might be coming in the cab
Like licking, you can chill, if you ain't, you can escape
Cuz the friend's coming with her, and she can participate
After Mardi Gras, I meet 'em in titty bars
Take 'em home, and bend 'em, and fill 'em with Dirty long
Cock strong dick diesel, when I stand like an easel
Come sit on Mini Me, and put a smile on Dr. Evil
Got some sunshine, leavin' my girl behind
The kind of pussy that start up a conga line
Pussy callin', I be pickin' it up
Pussy robber, I be stickin' it up
When I leave the ringer off, I be missin' a nut
I be missin' a nut, I be missin' a nut

Yo, you get your friends, and I'mma get my friends
And we gonna smoke some shit, and we gonna do this shit

Just put spinners on a brand new Range
When I walk up in the party everything seem strange
Oooh, must be that Roc-A-Fella chain

That college girl over there, she give good brain
When I pull out my gun, it goes chitty bang bang
I love 'em fat bitches cuz they titty hang hang
When I'm trying to get some food stamps, to buy some champagne
When you in the senior cars, gonna make you switch lanes
Blame it on the muthafucking game


Now, come, get some, you little bum
I'm Dirt McGirt, still living in the slums
Yeah, that's where I'm from
And I got enough liquor, you can all get some
The Swizz Beatz drum, bang through your speaker
I don't want no bud, cuz that ain't no good reefer
Forget from the Dirt, though, I'm the grim reaper
And I might hit it once and pass to my man Peter
Adios see ya, would hate to be ya

Got enough Chambers, I can hit it going wild
Rims on my truck is bigger than a cow
Chpaow! Jewellery cost more than your house
If you cooking in your kitchen, get the fuck out
Make them scream and shout ""McGirt, get in the house""

Try to get loose, you juice as a youth
Not knowin' to yourself that you shall be frozen

To rock and shock beats, polite when I recite

Askin' me about my peers, where I been for all these years
Starin' at my car yeah, notice money round here
Please baby show your speed, nuff talk about me
Where you work? What's your hobby?
Married, or got kids to some bonnie
Famous for karate
What's your number, call you probably
Waited for a week ot two, didn't see what we gon' do
Came through, new car XL on them 22's
Knock and marry, straight to her I wanna hit it badly
Then she startin' barkin', said ""first we gotta get married""
I hate this bitch, all I wanna do is hit the nappy
Gassed her head up, tell her anything tha make her happy
Straight to the hotel, she suck dick and fuck well
Asked me for my house number, I gave her Ol' Dirty's cell

When I'm sippin' on the henny, make me wanna fuck
Wanna fuck, wanna fuck
When I'm thinkin' of them bitches I don't fall in
Love, fall in love, fall in love

Who used to be a meaty-bone puppy cow little mutt
Came to my house smellin' like trout
I said, ""Doggie doggie get the fuck out!!""
Let me tell you about the rash from the neck
It's enough to put the ring around the collar in check
She's nothin' but a bitch other known as a witch
With an irritating itch from trying to switch
Strung out ass, foggin' up glass
Tellin' all the niggas tell that the bitch first class
Smoke a bag of hash from all the shit she stashed
First she had to play the collar just to made that cash
Pull down her panties then scratch that rat
Tear up the whiff, that appear 
Tryna get slayed, got the Tabernacle Prayer
The only thing holy was her shitty underwear

When I'm sippin' on the henny, make me wanna fuck
Wanna fuck, wanna fuck

Buck Scotties still pimpin', stay puttin' long dick in
White pussy our commission, hit it while you when out fishin'
Dog I be fuckin' bitches, while you be duckin' stitches
And don't think cause I'm a mack I won't buck at bitches

Don’t U Know Part II (short version),Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version (25th Anniversary Remaster),1995,"Intro: Ol Dirty Bastard, Shorty Shit Stain
Yo, turn the-- drop the, drop the drums
Yeah, drop the drums
(I know all the time) Step up to the mic boo
(It be hard to use a Trojan) Yeah, let me hear you
(Cause your shit can't breath...)
(Sex is something that everybody needs) I know all the time fellas
It's hard to use a Trojan
(Everybody wants, everybody loves)      Cause your shit can't breathe
It's all closed in
(Sex is something that everybody needs) Put the beat on, put the beat on
(Everybody wants, everybody loves)
Chorus: Shorty Shit Stain
Sex is something that everybody needs
Everybody wants, everybody loves
(repeat 2X) - If you want it baby
If you want it babe
Better use a Trojan!
Verse One:
I know all the time fellas, be hard to use a Trojan
Cause your shit can't breathe, it feels all closed in
You wanna slip itoff, ohh baby I like it raw
But why i wanna hurt myself for?
I was walking down my block, say my block Munroe
Said peace to this girl, girl said hello
Well hell is low, and the lowest you can go
Is thirty-two degrees, below zero
So I started to rain on this young bitch brain
Causin her a great relief of physical pain
She said, ""Tit for tat, step off da bra strap
No diamonds, no gold, I can never get a rap.""
I said, ""So what?"", as I grabbed herbutt
Bitch smiled for a while but her  mouth kept shut
Bitch eighteen years old, just birthed a child
Young in the brain though her thoughts are wild
On welfare, but she don't care
She says, ""FTF is always there.""
FTF means face-to-face
Main, headquarters of your local place
Where, you collect your monthly pay
To support bad habits youse abuse everyday
There hasnever been a girl in my entire life
My girl, my next, ex or my wife
And never been one who tried to disrespect
I'm speakin bout the member of the opposite sex!
There's somethin that I gotta let out
But I don't want to be known as Ralph the Blabbermouth
Quiet as kept, she thought I was soft
But all I wanted to do, is knock her boots off
Just from obtaining the common sense
You can tell that the girl seemin rather quite dense
Other than dense she played slightly bold
But from the statement I made she could not uphold herself
She broke down, and she started to cry she said
""Oh!  I don't believe this guy!""
What what you gonna do?
May I diss her?  Yes you may
That girl's a slut, with a hole in her butt
Who used to be a meaty-bone puppy child little mutt
Came to my house smellin like trout
I said, ""Doggie doggie doggie, get out!!""
She did my dick, I mean she bit bad vicious
Dirt Megirt, deep dark and delicious
She's a doo-doo BUH
Alcoholic NUH
And her ass is tighter
Than a pair of vice GRIPS
Speaking of a TUH
I won't kiss, because they don't give milk
Them shit, kick, see uh
Let me tell you about the rash from the neck
It's enough to put the ring around the collar in check
She's nothin but a BUH
Otherknown as a WUH
With an irritating ITCH
From trying to SWITCH
Strung out ass, foggin up glass
Tell all the NUH that the pussy first class
Smoke a bag of hash with the money she stash
But she had to play the corner just to make that cash
Pulled down her panties and scratched that rash
Then rubbed it with that a pimp had slashed
Tryied to get saved at the Tabernacle Prayer
But the only thing holy was her shitty underwear
I will change a style, always I will fix
But you can not teach an old bag...
Outro:
Yo I ain't got to say no more Son
Yo word to God man
Only thing I'm saying man, is use a Trojan
KnowhatI'Msayin?  Fore real man
Cause it's on man

I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with the fat rugged stack
The heat is on, I'm about to blow up the spot
All I wanna see is fire cause I'm makin shit hot
Like the blow between Glocks, mad niggas I shot
Give a fuck on a cop, conversate with a lock
Down at the chop-chop, 600th and Rock
Crazy as a fox tryin to rob Fort Knox
The DeNiro-Al Pachino war
Tryin to score mad dough like a million or more
For the illegal war that's all I saw
It's all about that knot in ya
I'm alone, I roll with 6 niggas with stones
Every hour tap my phone with embezzlement stones
Get a loan from the stocks because of my pops
Fifty bills in the pocks, Wu-Gambino got props

I'm unstoppable, my six man team is unstoppable
Stickin my middle fuckin finger at you
Livin in America's fuckin fucked up
When I was young some say I had no sense
I rhymed all day until my throat got tense
And bought em by the cage from my lungs to my knees
In the winter I cough, all summer I sneeze
Ah-choo! Then I was sore, there was only one cure
Original rhymes wholesome in thought
Democratics are debatin wanna be the imitatin
But the knowledge that I'm givin positively stimulatin
I acknowledge any MC in a South Bronx town
South Proof Projects, did they really go down
Shit, I remember when I was 12 years old
I didn't know about frontin or playin a role
I thought I was slick, I fell harder than bricks
With my best lyrics and my uptown ticks
Prince start jackin in my baseball cap
I'm tellin many chit-chats step off my jockstrap
Approach this party other known as a jam
Lookin for my cousin Bam-Bam Sleepingham
From front to back the jam was packed
Over there some dance, over there I just macked
I looked around then I started to walk
Heard an older woman's voice and a silly slang talk
The kid was nice for payin the price
And give weak MCs beneficial advice
Yes, beneficial meaning good for more
Frontin cause with the mamas would have loved to explore
Studied MC and changed lyrics around
Before I became a member of the lost and sound
My words I strung, I bettered my voice
Rollin over people known to be top choice

And when it rains it pours, cause my rhymes hardcore
That's why I give you more of the raw
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Whoa-hoa-hoa! Let me like slow up with the flow
If I move too quick, oh, you just won't know
I'm homicidal when you enter the target

So I take yo *** out quick
The mics, I've had it my *****, you can suck my ****
If you wanna step to my mother******* rep
CH-CH-BLOAW! BLOAW! BLOAW! Blown to death
You got shot cause you knock knock knock
""Who's there?"" Another mother******* hardrock
Slacking on your macking cause raw's what you lack
You wanna react? Bring it on back

The Stomp Part II,A Son Unique,UnKnown,"Dirt, Dirt, Dirt...
Dirt, Dirt, Dirt...
That's what I'm talking about

Soon as she slurp the mic, here comes the herpes light
People at church be like, friends, at work be like
She is the thirsty type, a nigga McGirt be like
Look, it ain't workin' right, it will convert my life
Now she's an earthly type, pure, and worthy type
Catch her in early nights, smile with pearly whites
Sippin' Bacardi's like, she's back in perverted life
You know how these birds be like, that's why you can't treat them right
My brother he eats it right, cheat, and beat his wife
Ike and Tina fight, this Medina life
The crack and nina like, block and fiending like
Cop subpeona like, giants and beams of light

Stomp, stomp, stomp! (Dirt, Dirt, Dirt, that's what I'm talking 'bout)
Let, me, see/(Dirt, Dirt, Dirt), you, stomp, stomp, stomp!

Things ain't the same today, this is the game they play
Dirt, the name, they say, throwin' the blame my way
So they can change my face, take and claim my space
But I remain the ace, always maintain a space
Coke, the 'caine, the base, Henny without the chase
Then it come out to lace, pussy all in my face
You know where the Dirt be at, where the skirts be at
Money and work be at, pull and squirt the mac's
You fake aristocats, where your pistol at?
Weak ballistic caps, I'm firing missiles back

(That's what I'm talking 'bout)
Let, me, see/(Dirt, Dirt, Dirt), you, stomp, stomp, stomp! (Dirt, dirt, dirt)
Let, me, see/(Dirt, Dirt, Dirt), you, stomp, stomp, stomp!

Three years, I'm out the gate, waiting, my clients deflate
(What, what) chain plate, bitch, I'm goin' state to state
Bitch, I sniff them eights, muthafucka, make these papes
Watch that ho get raped, nigga, I'm going ape
This is part two, the Stomp, you niggas in the slump
Uzi's all in my trunk, nigga, you hear the thump
Fill you with holes and lumps, rocks all in my fronts
Cock and feel the Monk, pussy everyday of the month
Do what the fuck I want, bitches, you shake your rump
Niggas you ain't no comp, let me see you jump

Stomp, stomp, stomp! (Dirt, Dirt, Dirt, that's what I'm talking 'bout)
Let, me, see/(Dirt, Dirt, Dirt), you, stomp, stomp, stomp!
(Dirt, Dirt, Dirt, McGirt) get, the, fuck, off, your, ass, nig-ga!
Stomp, stomp, stomp! (That's what I'm talkin' bout!)
Let, me, see, you, stomp, stomp, stomp!
Get, the, fuck, off, your, ass, nig-ga!

Skrilla,Dirt McGirt (Bootleg),2004,"When you get that skrilla, nigga, act familiar
When you get that skrilla, nigga, act familiar

When you get that skrilla, nigga, act familiar
Own family will kill ya, damn it be a skrilla
Box of bullets in flavors, like Mike & Ike
Friday night, I'm in the bed, with a bitch and a dyke
Ol' Dirty, 7:30, got the thirty-thirty
Caught a mouscope, ain't aimin' at no birdie
My name plate, travel through the interstate
Glock in the stash box, my drop top ventilate
Permanent A.C., use to boost at Macy's
Smoke out Mr. Spacely, and still Dick Tracy
I blind dunk a base, make ya chest inflate
I'm at the herb gate, watch my money bake
Disrespect me, where I lay my head, my hammer spray
My cybertech nylon suit, reflect gamma ray
When I speak, ears open to the size of cymbal
Make you tremble, watch what the fuck my gun do


A moment to pray, a second to die
Take your hard ride with the bulletproof high
Nigga, check ya logic, Ol' Dirty's out the closet
I return you niggas for a five percent deposit
Beer belly, I chuckle like Kris Kringle
Put four grams of cocaine, crushed up in the single
Everyday is Saturday, everyday my gats play
When shit get bad, I'm looking for a badder way
Ol' Dirt McGirt, in concert the bomb burst
To set it off, shoot him in the arm, first
Let him off? Nah, kidnap his mom, first
Told you, when things get worst, nigga, things get worst
Cats be saddling, when the gats splattering
Ol' Dirt, caught one through the lower abdomen
Straight through the back, like the javelin

Shit (we coming, we coming!)

I'm the nigga walkin' through the Hill, with the gun out
Lookin' for the big mouth, showin' off in front of bitches
Talk about Dirt, leave you lumped up in stitches
Dig a lotta ditches, for you six feet spitters
Put the barrel in ya mouth, I'm the shell case shitter
Masquerade paid, stay on the front page
Playin' on streets, like streets was arcade
My hand's all sprayed, like Charles blades the gensu
Feel the lucy, and spark up the neptune
Resurrect them, to dawn on, protect 'em
Outside set up, guess who inject them
Walk through zoo, but no Zu, is Brooklyn
Heavy artillery, thug chains in Brooklyn
Strapped in the back of the Ac', Dirty rolls like that
That's a Crooklyn fact
, find Dirty
And you find where the cash is at, fuck y'all

Why ya'll always be talkin' shit (fuck y'all)
Everytime I hear you talkin' shit (fuck y'all)
And anytime I hear you talkin' shit
Will be the last thing that you be talkin', shit (fuck y'all)

Explosive rap game, like a Meth thing
Spit acid, the Ol' Dirty Bastard
Pull like coast, to toast it, while I'm acid
Ten stories up, penthouse, only us
Meanwhile I'mma strain, what I can't 
crush
Fresh, wild and bold like the Cold Crush
Purple haze keep a nigga with the robut (fuck y'all)
On the major when the bitch slap, giddy up
I'm an ass man, but I tear the titty up
Tear ya whole city up, bring it if you grittier
Dirty ain't so pretty,

Escalated, cuz I'm made of Baby Jesus

Come on baby let me you jump, let me see you body rhythm pump
Come on baby let me see you go, let me see you, like go, go, go

Aiyo, my timin' is so precise, gangsta all my life
I don't get robbed, I control the heist
Cold as ice, still nothing, this whole device
Life's a gamble, so I roll the dice
I camed up, still I'm up and coming
Auto start, put on my sneaks, truck is running
Bad broads, that's beyond Beyonce
Eatin' on my body like a dinner entree
What ya'll critics gonna say, don't even risk it
Forget Pillsbury, eat this Blah Blah biscuit
Ya'll watered down the game, man, like bar liquor
It's nothin' for me, I just buy the bar quicker
Oh my God, nigga, I'm in the house, and I'm rowdy
He been doin' this since five thousand on an Audi
Remember ""Danger!"" Yo, ya'll know Blah
This is grown under water, ya'll ain't even in my sonar

The east is in the house like (danger)
About to, turn it out like ""Oh My God"" (danger)
Put the barrel in your mouth like (danger)
I see the dipper through a blouse, it's ""Oh My God"" (danger)

And you know that I act a little crazy

Eazy-E lingo, doin' the dango, the vet' don't wear Kangol
I dare pump my shit, at the club, actin' strange, yo
Smack ya'll niggas in the face, yo
Got wiggas in the place, yo, block party in this motherfucker
I'm the only round actin' like sucka, sucka bitch ass pucker
So don't play this motherfucker, or watch you bird clucker
So don't let yourself break yourself
With the sip and tumble, that will take yourself
I move with that heat that smoke you in your head, man

Set up shop in Cali, then one in deli Dover

Hit this song to walk back in it, then it's gon' be white gold
Eatin' wild timing, ya'll know it's my title
I burn more bushes than Moses in the Bible
But hates gon' Holly, pimpin's gon' Broadway
So many pimps, broads don't know who to pay
But ya'll better have my dough

Sussudio,Urban Renewal: Featuring the Songs of Phil Collins,UnKnown,"Dirty?
Phil Collins
Ol' Dirty
Yeah, Su-su-ssudio
Sudioo

This recording is dirty and a-stinkin'
Funkier than Pepé Le Pew
So I was thinkin' about droppin' this single on the charts
Letting you know ""Hey! The kid has heart""
I never deny myself as being dope
But in my last jam, niggas slept on my notes
You thought that I was weak
Uhh, let me speak
My rhymes come funkier than your grandpa was weak
So listen, mister, don't you ever forget
The rhyme are dirty, you couldn't clean it with Comet
Or even Morax, some try Ajax
Only mix with the best, 48 tracks
Yo, I get down with Ason sound
Lyrics that be flowing from miiiiiles around
So let the music shut ya ass up
And feel the uppercut that would make you fall to your butt
What!
Chorus:

If he calls me, I'll be there
I'll come running anywhere
He's all I need all my life
Feels so good if I just say the word
Su-Su-ssudio
Just say the word, oooh
Su-Su-ssudio
Uh ohh

Let me continue verse number two
Style is wild, Dirty stinkin' like doo-doo
If you're hangin' around, you change your mind
If it's a bad influence, but yo it's my rhyme (my rhyme)
I sit down and I say to myself
Sell, yo, or you on the top, shelf
I drop this single for you to get a dose of
As I lay back like a pillow on a sofa
Gettin paid? Yeah, right, fully
My ass can be G one one one
You know me
My rhyme is sugar
Sweet as a honey bee
Tastes like a 40
Stinkin' like OE, yeah
Well I drink Old English
So I speak Old English
If not, I'd be dirty and stinking
And if not, well I guess I'm not
The A-S-O-N, my friend
You wouldn't understand

If he calls me, I'll be there
I'll come running, anywhere
He's all I need, all my life
Feels so good if I just say the word

Aww, man, come on, yea, yeah, yo

You doin' what you doin', let's get it
Starvin' and you robbin', and you catch a nigga slippin', best get 'em
Hit 'em where the good Lord split him
Introduce myself, go booth yourself
In the far left lane, and I'm, hydro planed
And I'm, slingin' my 'caine, don't care how you feel
Checkin' out the truck, check the wheels
Wanna get fucked, bitch kneel, let me splash in your grill
Who but me? Muthafuckin' right, get it right
Papi of this motherfuckin' thing, truck tight
Rollin' with my niggas, we ain't lookin' for no fights
Now pop one in your head, that's all she said
It's time to get head in my Mercedes-Benz
Chipped up and I ain't even talkin' bout my jams
Clipped up, so any nigga frontin', gettin' banned
Give 'em all ten in his chin, I'm all in

Move back, move back, you can't fuck with me, huh
I'm from the clique called N.I.B

Next up, I believe that's me
Meeno, get it right, no descrempancy
Always keep a weapon, see, run it ground
Worth of stones, nothin' less on me, why you stress on me
Niggas mad cause I stretch my D., ya'll dudes want my recipe?
Here's what ya'll do, hit the lab, write an album or two
Then I might let you sign my shoe, that's just how I do
Everybody sayin', boy too souped up
Nah, I'm just hot, plus Bentley Coup'd up
Who put, you too busy holdin' the stoupe up
Ya'll fault your broke, and not mine, stupe'a
I'm like Juve', I need it in my life
Got fifty birds flyin' in, later on tonight
Rock and I hustle, so I get paid twice
Life is a gamble boy, roll your dice


Who you know spit flows, get dough like I
In the L.A.B.'s, motherfucker, no lie
Hit the links I've seen, back in late '95
Had to wait for two nine, rockin' and clickin' on both sides
Of course we gon' ride, ride over the competition
The real has arrived, ya'll bitch niggas is finished
All I gotta do is Nextel tag my lieutenant
Your whole click will get toe tagged tagged in two minutes
This to them fools thinkin' they gon' catch the God slippin'
I'm always on point and I'm always packin' my weapon
You see me in the club, believe me, I got the tech in
I slipped the DJ a guard, you slipped it in with the records
Either you love it or hate it, but bet you gon' respect it
Rainbow glow, when the lights hit off the necklace
I'm what you can't be, young, black, rich, and wreckless
It's the god free, and L.A.B.'s, one two, check it


Remix! Huh, yeah, it's 101, what?
You know what it is when you hear that, Harlem
Fix ya face or smacked in it, Harlem
Harlem, right here, Harlem
You gon' stupid if you don't bounce to this man
You gonna only look like a hater, huh-huh
Lenox Ave. Boyz, what up, it's only right
They know what it is, man, remix

Move back, its no touchin' me, I'm from that place called NYC
H Dub to the death, and I don't give a fuck what party it is
I'm still in the club wearin' sweats (hah)
Milk ears with the money colored check
Ill two step, blowin' dubs with the best
Live life, most hated, with my Lenox Ave. Boyz
Remix, Move Back, with Grease providing all the noise
Huh, your home boy game so raw
And I ain't even gotta say my name no more
Haters wanna give my name to the law
But punchin' and kickin', to kick us all, they can blame you for
Might catch me in the 'Lac with Snaps
Or lightin' sticky green 'dro, with Wink and Meeno
You from the hood and you ain't no coward, well me neither
And before you step on my sneaker, I really think you need to (move back, move
Back)

This your boy to the dash
Same nigga, no talkin', just result to the mass
I stab niggas, throw the hawk in the trash
Peroxide my bullets, give the burners a bath
Three fifty Z, burnin' the Ave
I'm old school, I still got the fiends burnin' the glass
I pull the pump off my waist, and dumb in your face
I'm a little bit too hard for the radios to play
I still can spit eighty miles an hour in a verse
And my Coupe go eighty miles an hour in reverse
I let my tool go, ya'll niggas just studio killas
Nigga, I'mma killa in the studio
I got guns that'll hollow a wall
Point it to your jaw, make you swallow it all
Ya'll niggas want hardcore?
What the fuck you think the R, and Full Surface and D-Block is for?

They ask, who's that, that's P-Cardi
And what he in, what he in, he in a Fer-rari
You know I'm strapped, you know I'm strapped, I got the heat on me
And what I'm wearin', and what I'm wearin', a long Bigari
Thinkin' I'm Joe Clark, nigga, try to 'lean on me'
But if he is, like Biggie said, 'he gon' bleed'
Niggas ain't hard, niggas heart full of creatine
But go against that, green, I go against your, brain
And don't fuck with me and the kid, I've been a daddy all my life
No 'dro, we gon' blow that alley all day, say what
Act stupid, we gon' it crackin' here tonight
Greasin', Meen' on the front, with Snappy on my right
If rap don't work, nigga, we go to the kitchen
Those ain't hoes, so then you know we ain't pimpin'
I'm on, my toes, so nigga, no, I ain't slippin'
Too close, hold somethin', or now I know Cardy didn't

And if he know, what keep me little
Think you know, I think it later
See me, and my guns come to, just like a waiter
You up north, singin' just like Anita Baker
Make up your mind, then come and ready, feen to meet your maker
The man that laugh last, will surely laugh harder
Me have a gonna shut up and eat bars, and all of the prankster
With them and I for black gangster (huh, I'm from the clique called N.I.B.)

But drunk, when he hop inside, in the club gettin' tired
Bitches scatter all around me, ready to excite it
All these kittens got me flea bitten, eatin' out my mitten
I'm comin' off top, my moves are unwritten
Now slitter to the snake, in the spring time wither
But strong on my own, Wu-Tang, I'm forever
Women desirin', jobs is hiring
Money admiring, never keep tiring
Rhymin' ain't nothin', the easiest job ever
And I'm doing mine, holdin' it together
While money quadruple, from playin' the cripple
Drinkin' from a titty nipple, sippin' on ripple
Blunt keep on flippin', from keep gettin' dippin'
The mic I'm rippin', the record skippin'
The pussy drippin', the wet got me slippin'
The bitch I'm strippin', I'm platinum shippin'",https://genius.com/Ol-dirty-bastard-move-back-lyrics

Because of my momma and my daddy; they grew up cursin'
So please respect my style, please!

I'll grab the mic and now I damage you, cuts your whole stamina
Here comes the medical examiner
One verse then you're out for the count
Bring the ammonia make sure he sniffs the right amount
Wake you up and then I axe you
How did you intend this --
Competition to get an ass kickin' so tremendous
Oh!, you shouldn't bother this
Leave me alone like a son, he'll be fatherless!
I got the asiatic flow mixed with disco
Roll up on the scene like the Count of Monte Crisco
And MC's start to vanish
I rolled up into jet, black kid the nigga started speakin' spanish!
Yo!, he wasn't from Panama
I axed you how you get so fuckin', dark, you said
""suntanama!""
He'll be responded so fast, you made me laugh
Ha-ha-ha, HARARRRH scared his ass
Kick the hundred strongest rhymes
Then I brought out the punk in him
Caught him with a strong five deadly venom
Told him!, enter the Wu-Tang
Witness the Shaolin slang, that'll crush any shit you brang
I watch your ass take a big fall, why?!
My Main Source, is like a friendly game of stickball
And as you step up to batman, I play you the riddler
You try to jew me for a rhyme nigga, I'll change to Hitler
I go out like a Nazi, wish your fuckin' ass stayed, home and played (Yahtzee!)
Or watchin' Happy Days sweatin' Poxie
With Ralphie and Richie Cunningham, Joni and Chachi
Wu, who? Me gettin wreck talk to him
He's like a twelve and a half foot, gettin' in a seven shoe
Now picture that with a Minolta
I have your ass doin' some Night Fever shit like John Travolta
I come strong I make knowledge born, I flip the script
And rock on from P.M. , past the fucking Dawn
Pass the Hammer you're broke down, niggas grab my what what
You can't understand it, here's the panorama
A complete view, of how I defeat you
Shoulda stepped to those god damn kids who tried to beat you
Yeah I bust that ass before
You ran to Texas and came back but forgot the chainsaw!
And wanna perform a massacre
Better be coming with some motherfucking shit that's spectacular

Who get drunker than, N.O.R.E., on a Sunday
And on the way to Sunday school, intoxicated
See ah, lord forgive me, I'm a ex-coke flipper
And skipped on that good ol' bitch, she got a strip of these
Niggas is bitch-made, I got a switchblade
And I pack guns, shootin' niggas since the sixth grade
Mac Milli, Millitainment, it's La Familia, now
Guess it's niggas all in your rap, ain't gotta kill you now
Nore never slack off, I smoke a pack soft
And I run deep in this bitch, and let that mack off
Bing, Nore got a whole lotta bitches
Out of character, and eating out a whole lotta dishes
In my lifetime, sippin' on white wine, caveza
Nore ran twiz, get a whole lotta head
Ching, simple like uno, dos, tres, ah'
And I leave the crib, and grab the tech, cuz I'm the drastic


Oh shit! Oh shit!
Ya'll remember when me and Mariah
I'm back with the kid, spit fire
Dirt McGirt, I break up the earth
My ice is white and blue, like Papa Smurf
Stash niggas like crack, throw them under the earth
Then past the dirt pound, and ask 'em ""do it hurt, now?""
Ya'll gonna make me back the truck
To the Dash, O.D.B., that's what's up


Cuz we can do it like this",https://genius.com/Ol-dirty-bastard-dirty-and-grimey-lyrics
Don’t Hurt Me,A Son Unique,UnKnown,"Yo, stepping fresh out the clean, through the fog
I be that Ol' stinkin' Dirt McGirt dog, with a hurtin' for ya
That nigga liftin' ya skirt, learned it in the dark
Hurtin' bitches feelings on purpose, I'm a dog
Biting, no -- I don't bite, see
I just like to nibble on ya nipple, a little
It's not a riddle, or game, with dope
I just wanna stroke or poke, you in the right place
As if your pussy got a nice face
You need to stop fucking with lightweights
See my Roc chain is heavy, cock game, is ready
To shoot, oh bitch, go get cute
Cuz you can easily get treated like a prostitute
Please believe me, I like it raw, because I'm so freaky
Dirty, but a nigga still shining when you see me
You know that nigga, A, Son
Never been tooken out, Dame, good looking out
Hoes holla!

I'mma keep it real, don't hurt me
A nigga like me, love the ill punani, cuz I'm dirty
Please don't flirt with the Dirt McGirt
When I'm done, liftin' ya skirt, then this mic get hurt, u know
(Don't hurt me, Dirty) {Okay}
(I promise, I won't you, Dirty) {You sure?}
(Don't hurt me, again) {Okay} (Don't, don't, don't hurt me again)

Aiyo, my album gets crazy, but I'm still on the low
Your style is flashy, and you don't got no hoes
Don't front, I spit classics, you know how it go
On my leisure, Lisa give me so much throat
Well I need ya, bitch, betta have my dough
And Indonesia, in the Dutch, already rolled
Don't let 'em fool ya, tell you, Ol' Dirty's a joke
Somebody school her, tell her Ol' Dirty's a pro
First it's marriage.... then it's babies....
You know, Dirt love the babies.... (aiyo, bounce with me now)
It's game time, baby, ball with me now, I'm in your court, now
In your grand marquee, on tour with me now
With the Benz, laid back, in the hood with me now
Momma said she wanna go with me, cuz I make her feel good
When she go away with me, Ol' Dirty, nigga!

My niggas better raise it up, fruit punch in my cup, so what?
Ol' Dirty, I served my time, now I'm out and gonna have a good time
My new account is kinda different, cuz I'm 'ready spendin' all my dimes
What what, give me a check for 9, zero, zero, zero, zero
Count count 'em, muthafucka, this mine

Ahhhhh, a wiggle-wiggle, a wiggle-wiggle
Dirty...

I never will forget the way
Dame Dash, send a limo for me
(What what), signed me up for the team
VH1, caught me doing my thing
I had bitches in the limo actin' like they fucking rolling with king
Shopping sprees on Fifth Ave., backrubs, bubble baths
Ol' Dirty fucked, come, clean my ass
Now I'm straight, gotta spit for my chips
With nothing in my system that would get me incarcerated

When you rollin' up the L, pig it out
Pop the cork, respect, pour it out
White Horse in the house, roll it out
If it's goods on the wood, throw 'em out
I'll be there, pop, you can dig it out

Dirt Dog, want the red rug, roll it out
You saw the grip, and I ain't ashamed to pull it out
My fault, cuz you said you gonna bring it out
And you know it ain't comin', til I'm singin' out
Oh, don't stop ma, got my legs shakin' here, don't stop ma
You'se a real freak girl, gotta give you props
Cuz I feel the bam bam when my bed rock

Rollin' on your stair, bitch, pick her out
Out of control, and can't slut her out
Big girls, you can get it, no doubt
You jumpin' off, with the pretty little mouth
Don't expect to trip down south
Uh-uh, and relay in my baby mama house
Let's fuck, girl, time's running out
Mama be home at five, on the dot


Fuckin' up my party, bitch, throw 'em out
Out of control, my name, wide 'em out
Fill the arenas, the Roc, sell 'em out

Give It To Ya Raw (LP Version),Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version (25th Anniversary Remaster),1995,"Give it to ya raw!
Yo, it's that old school shit
About 12 years old

Let's get physical, operate your brain to function
I remember the Gods at the junction
Conjunction junction what's your function?
I summed it up as the Ason 'sumption
Known on the microphone as Crazy Crucial
Dipping low on an MC like you and doing you
Something, so step to the shit right now
Kicking on everything in my god damn town
Doing expression, a jam it to deadly
Daredevil doing, 'cause I am the U-N
I-Q-U-E funky fresh
Funky do he get hype?
You're motherfucking right I do
Ason, break it down sure anytime
A serious outstanding never end it clever in the rhyme
Break down your shit, wherever you come
There's no one who can fuck with Ason
I paralyze you make you realize who
Lost concern with my god damn crew
Quiet as kept when I start any fuckin riots
Even before you do in my nigga? Don't try it!
For you to get close enough to my style
You have to travel miles and miles and miles
To find a special rhyme like mines, you gotta look
At what you find in the Brooklyn Zoo
Raw exit, killing the beat with all your might
You love a hip hop song baby, I don't wanna be right
Wake up, what, what, losing  your head
Woke up on the wrong side of the bed
Juvenile faction of hard, you say you're living large
You're the head nigga in charge

I give it to ya raw!
I said I give it to ya raaaawww!!
I'm Ason baby, I'm the Ason baby
I'm Ason baby, I'm the Ason
I'm Ason baby, I'm the Ason
Givin it to ya raw baby
The raw deal, because

These lovely rhymes made by the one and only
I'm Ason, there's nothing phony about me
Steady of course so hard to handle whip it
Like a specialist I write my own music
Now I make ya dance, get drunk or act wild
Baby saying ""Hey hey I love your style""
Whether you're sober, known just to holder, Casanova
Get chopped with the lawn mower
So get busy as Ason perform
On and on ladies scream my name Ason
That means the Ason girls fanatic
Repeat it so much you get a throat infection
Yo I relieve the ones who believe
You're in the need of the God degree
That I build on with style and finesse
Keep MCs in check like a game of chess
So to the folks, come to my rehearsals
I look so good I should be on the commercials
On TV that tell original lie
Of the Ason most high
Who's your Jesus? Stop me and question
They'll never forget they can choke on position
Don't charge a cent of excellent
Add the ingredients of Ason's elements
Fire, water, cold earth wood
Yo do the knowledge because it is good
Enough to overstuff jumbo pack
Brother like Ason will never be attacked
A by a nigga couldn't figure how to pull the gun trigger
And I say yo get the fuck outta here!",https://genius.com/Ol-dirty-bastard-give-it-to-ya-raw-lp-version-lyrics

A Dirty for drama, get's worse
Who can make it happen like Dirt?, tell me

Standin' over bodies with a shovel
Standin' over bad, til my beef all settle
On another level, cuz I dance with the Devil
Then I slap a bitch in the eye, with the bezzle
Starin' at ice, so my nine stare back
Then I shoot first, so you won't shoot back
Criminal thoughts, sippin' on Similac
If I walk with a limp, then it's pimp tag scrap
On sundown, you gonna eat these rounds
Roll on the bitch ass, with the tops dropped down
Dirty stay focused on the bend, deep nigga
Then I will offend, who offend me, nigga


Who can make it happen like Dirt?
Bury motherfuckers like Dirt?
When the cavalry come, and you face these guns
Who can make it happen like Dirt?

One hand on the bible, on hand on your purse
Fuckin' the deacon's wife, like I'm Judas
Y'all thank God, while me and my stank, do this

We ran the train, like rush hour commuters
Pack a pussy, like porn stars, yea, ya'll

Met this bitch, by the name of Suzy
She was a bad bitch, she had a big ol' booty
She got me set up, when I went to the projects
Bad ass bitch, she was the one to holla at
Had another bitch by the name of Precilla
You know that bad bitch, she taste like vanilla
In my car, looking good like that
Getting money, making rushes, down with rats
Saying to myself, no one can defeat me
I got my dick out, come on bitch, feed me
Let shit out, go down the throat
Nigga like me, never miss a note
If rain, I got coke, so I can't soaked
Make a nigga go, I takes that dough
Get hot like Superfly
I'm the best at this shit and I don't know why


Girls with money, drippin' from your ass
I don't give a fuck, I'm smoking grass
You known me from down the block, I'm that good
Sold to your people in your neighborhood
Baby how you want, the period is yummy
The diamonds in my mouth, I'm eatin' gummy
The feet bitch, I'm not lookin' at the corn
The way you farted, smell like them horns
You got enough body, enough to start a fight
Your deep throat, me solo, say all night
I'm movin' on you, screwin' on you
Don't know what I'm doing on you
Ain't your man, but I know I'm chewing on you
You'll be best, when me and you leave the set
Got rubies, how did you get them neck?
How do you feel about that bitch, if the bitch is a fatty
Hit that bitch, now take it from me


If you ain't sweating, there's something wrong, girl
(I am....) Say it louder

Now bitch tell me right now, why you trying to kill me
As if that I like bitches like Eazy-E
You float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Knock that ho out like Muhammad Ali
Spin in my mouth, throw your knees to the floor
Squeel like a pig, I squeel like a whore
Squeel like a motherfucker, do on tour
69 girl, get on all fours
Winter, Spring, Summertime, Fall
When I walk down the street, do a man whore
Black blueberry bitch, stink, girls itch
Forget two G, I'm filthy man rich
Tuesday, Wednesday, I take off
Get it bitch, get it, my dick needs floor
I'm gonna get this CREAM, teen girl, hurt you, fuck laws

Link your cupid and fuck your brewin'
Flash the burgers on your crewin'

I got the amazing ability
I get on the mic so you can have a ball
I could fly through the air and stick to the wall
I could take a punch or get hit by a car
Could go to the nearest or farthest star
As a matter of fact it's what I won't talk about
Hoppin' and goin' out of his trace just to be in the house

I'm so pimped out about my big spendish
I got a 20, 6 Clock extra dickless (extra dickless)

And my flows comin' faster than a jet to Alaska

Light it up, let it cook, look in the mirror, as we crush
Don't worry about how it looks, put some money on my books
Only God can judge me now
That's when I heard the click clown
I was Christened ,I ain't with them, am I RZA
Let them whistles out them pistols
Let loose on them troops and then shake 'em like Cherok smoke
I slam dunk 'em like Shaq
I wanna be free, I'm not guilty, do you feel me?

OK, it's cute, it's squashed
Now, no though mane, lets have a back wash
Yeah you trippin', ""no I ain't"", yeah you is
That boy spittin', what's his name? 40, quarter, biatch

I stays in place, place stays in me
I'm a vision of truth, just a true MC
Love hiphop so much, mic won't untouched
Thugs grow unbust, bitch won't get fucked
Every 40 ounce cracked, every napsack packed

So please, dog, do you a favor, move from around me
Cuz I set my boundaries, you wanna know where I'm from
Ask Bust' where he found me, true B
Paper chasin', Franklin' raping
And for sure, I'm gonna make my statement

On the down low, like I'm ducking the warrant
Getting head in the back by the bathroom toilet
There's beauty all around, let me see the performance
She down for whatever, you know I'mm all for it

From coke to PCP, from Marie to Penelope
I'mma smoke this cocaine, like white boys smoke trees
Can I get that G, autograph me
I feel like a refugee how people run up on me
Pussy is powerful, it feels wonderful
It got me worshipful, money is plentiful
Niggas is full, and plus your bored
Any girl I pull is too wall for war
Power plug on, pussy turned on
I rocked it on, rap colored thong
Weight, I put on, strong like protons
I polly, then I'm gone, my style carries on
It's my party, holdin' too much hotty
Go and dance, and it's a robbery, actin' all snobbery
Real name: Moses, I pantyhose it
To all my hoes, industry, I sow's this


Where the aluminum bats'll give welts
And niggas wear ratchets in they belts
Nah, niggas wear ratchets like belts
Nah, it ain't good, but if you say the wrong thing
In my hood, might as well, say the casket just fell
Collapse from that smell, he dodgin' po-po
Niggas wanna act like they mafioso
All they see is me, when I spark the four-four
With a red dot, bigger than the Target logo
Dudes be superhuman, on some X-Men shit
With fast ways, you the only dead man to live
So act tough, til he see his best man give
Now he pro-black, on some X-Clan shit
For realer, I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge ain't sweet, when a muthafucka pussy
So get loud, get piped, get drunk, get live
Get tough, get hype, go ahead, get smacked, nigga",https://genius.com/Ol-dirty-bastard-danger-zone-lyrics

Yo East New York in this muthafucka, Blahzay Blah in this muthafucka
Brooklyn in this muthafucka, Dirt Dog in this muthafucka, it's on point
Come on baby let me jump, let me see you body rhythm pump
Come on baby let me see you go, let me see you, like go, go, go

Aiyo, my timin' is so precise, gangsta all my life
I don't get get robbed, I control the heist
Cold as ice, still mountin' this whole device
Life's a gamble, so I roll the dice
I tamed up, still I'm up and coming
Auto start, put on my sneaks, truck is running
Bad broads, that's beyond Beyonce
Eatin' on my body like a dinner at entree
What ya'll critics gonna say, don't even risk it
Forget Pillsbury, eat this Blah Blah biscuit
Ya'll watered down the game, man, like bar liquor
It's nothin' for me, I just buy the bar quicker
Oh my God, nigga, I'm in the house, and I'm rowdy
He been doin' this since five thousand on an Audi
Remember ""Danger!"" Yo, ya'll know Blah
This is grown under water, 
ya'll ain't even in my sonar

The east is in the house like (danger)
About to, turn it out like ""Oh My God"" (danger)
Put the barrel in your mouth like (danger)
I see the dipper through a blouse, it's ""Oh My God"" (danger)
Me and Dirty on the floor like (danger)
Me and Dirty pimpin' ho's like ""Oh My God""

So then you act like you love my little baby
And you know that I act a little crazy
Come on baby let me jump, let me see your body rhythm pump
Come on baby let me see you go, let me see you, like go, go, go
I'm on the streets lingo, spendin' the spingo
Eazy-E lingo, doin' the dango, the vet' don't wear Kangol
I dare pump my shit, at the club, actin' strange, yo
Smack ya'll niggas in the face, yo
Got wiggas in the place, yo, block party in this muthafucka
I'm the only round actin' like sucka, sucka bitch ass puffer
So don't play this muthafucka, or watch you bird clucker
So don't let yourself break yourself
With the sip and tumble, that will take yourself
I move with that heat that smoke you in your head, man
The shit war, time to take, man, take man


Come on baby let me jump, let me see your body rhythm pump
Come on baby let me see you go, let me see you, like go, go, go",https://genius.com/Ol-dirty-bastard-danger-2004-lyrics

Plea the ams radio tapes that he jammed
Golden chrome, desert eagle never left at home
Flip the track of the beat watch Bobby flip the metronome
High voltage, keep my seat in winsbro cultured
Kill enemies by mailin them the poison glue postage
I open and fold ya thought he fucked a ogre
I leave the cats the book of food stamps ????
The box of evil a fifty sack of that lethal
Adjust these boots and bloody cube steaks from keebu

What party can you go to
And I ain't there you bitches actin like they don't care

You bitches actin like you don't care
You bitches actin like you YO
Razor blade toenails cut holes inside tube socks
Golden platinum things unstainable
I chew rocks
Slipe wit type digital soup deflect bullets
Black hooded surrounded by forty acres of wooded
Land, like my cousin dusty dirty as dan
Fucked the daughter of the leader of the Ku Klux Klan
Tapes we dub pound you wit the ace of club
Climb your tree to a shub
Tongue kiss a lion and kidnap her cub
Passin it portrait
My bitch spread eagle wild orchid
Pussy so wet you could fuck it wit a soft tipped dick
Tickle the tonsil you could hear her coughin
I don't know if Dirt fucked Mariah, but I'm out to fuck Tyra
Starks might fuck Mya

I'm the pussy vampire

Yo I'm bent out three days two nights yo I'm spent out
One hell of a cruise New York got they hand out
Like I owe somethin, check they stance they frontin
I'm two seconds fromt wistin ya'll shit over nuttin
All a sudden ice grills kid you did a baby bid
In a minute almost hung yourself slit ya wrists
To the maximum hand me the forty I'll thrash and
Split out guests wit gash lemon goes throw his laz gone
Trama the block pro bar sledge slang ho
Runnin from to and sharles some rap and I might blow
World cup, some been blessed wit the Stanley
Yvonne lendl ordered lamb racket wit the cam key
Sideline maneuver, polish wax MC remover
Niggas wit long nails cuttin me leavin bruises
Candle lows tied a thousand an ya'll froze
Came home an dust that doo tryin to play me close
We've been peaked for years now Liz wants to choppin the kid
I might do magic make him disappear
Rearose that nigga Isotoner Coca-Cola holder snap the granola
Sprinkle ginko polish
Venom from a cobra lace in the come he brought older
Soaked through a strainer here's a doser
The King James version is paid just like Samsung
Wit effects that'll kill rogers double O seven
Hanna Barbera hops the opposite abandoned the deer
Fuck wit mics like Sonny and Cher
Or maybe captain entenail, connect and then blow the seal
Nice like mister whittendale your girl Chippendale
Shallah bridge all up in ya dog dial trench
When I snatched that shit was broke shoulda sent ya ass back
And where's the key to the hatchback pop that
Get in throw a bag full of mice and then respect that

Leave you in your pearl, put you on the porch, dancin'
And leave your brains on the back of a white shirt

Shotgun shells give your face a new shape
Nine shot, ten shot eleven shot, twelve
